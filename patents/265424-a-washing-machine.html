				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The present invention is related to method of washing clothes manually or powered by some autonomous means such as an electric motor by modifying the size and shape of the washing drums and providing some means of abrasion or brushing, attached to these drums. The product shown is a washing machine comprising of one or two concentric drums; for two drums, the outer one being of a different shape than the inner one, as well as its variants driven by a motor. The drum is rotated by the pedalling action by the user or by some autonomous means, resulting in production of froth and abrasion or brushing of clothes. This combined with the variation in shape of the drum(s) or variation in the gap between the two drums results in tumbling, pressing and mechanical dislodging of dirt from the clothes against the abrasive or brushing surfaces of the drum, providing superior washing and cleaning action.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Cleaning clothes by hand is a time consuming, tedious and exhausting job. Even though with the invention of washing machine washing clothes has become easier, the limitations with the current washing machines are that they cannot generally be operated without electricity and nearby source of water such as a running water tap or water pipe. The problem of washing clothes is still the same for the people who do not have a source of water in their homes or access to electricity. It is not advisable to bring the water from the water source for this purpose, since washing using the conventional washing machines require an excessive amount of water as compared to what is needed for drinking, cleaning utensils etc., and carrying so much water is difficult. Because of this, people in rural areas prefer to go to the water source to clean clothes. A problem with this is that in the process water at the source gets polluted with the detergent. Although there are other products available in the market for washing clothes without electricity, they are not portable and do not provide comparable degree of cleaning as in washing by hand.<br>
The objective of the present invention is primarily to provide aid in washing clothes for people who prefer to go to a water source such as canals, ponds, rivers etc to wash their clothes, to improve the quality of washing by changing the size and shape of the drum<br><br>
and use of aids for mechanical dislodging of dirt by abrasion or brushing action in the washing machine, and to enable these to happen with less effort (in manually powered variant) or no effort (in the autonomous variant).<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
One of the principle objects of the invention is to develop a washing machine.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to develop a method of operating washing machine.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to develop a method of assembling the washing machine.<br>

In still another embodiment the frame 3 comprises preferably V shaped supports 22 &amp; 23 upon which the drum assembly is mounted.<br>
In still another embodiment the external surface of drum assembly is coated with water proof sealant to protect from leakage.<br>
The primary object of the present invention is the combination of two drums of a washing machine which are different and unique and are responsible for improved quality of washing even at lower rotational speeds than conventional washing machines. The inner<br><br>
surface of the outer drum 1 and the outer surface of the inner drum 2 are covered with abrasive surface 11 &amp; 12 or washing brushes having same or different stiffness in different directions. In particular, we claim that if the stiffness of the brush is less in the direction in which the drum is rotated, this causes sufficient pressure on the clothes for cleaning while reducing the damaging effect. The proposed washing machine consists of two concentric or eccentric drums, having some difference in shapes so as to enable a variable gap between the two drums, such as the outer one being of one shape and the inner one being of another shape, and any other possible variants that may or may not enable variable gap between the drums. When the drums rotate in opposite direction, or one of the drums rotate while the other is stationary, the relative motion between the drums in some of the variants leads to variation of the gap between the two drums, which is responsible for the pressing action of the clothes. This pressing and relative motion enables clothes to be pressed and dragged against the abrasive surfaces such as brushes attached to the drums, causing mechanical dislodging of dirts action. It is also possible that both the drums are of same shape as shown in figure 5.<br>
Another claim of the present invention is that if the circular drum of the existing front loading washing machines is replaced by a drum of variable radii such as an elliptical drum, better tumbling action will take place resulting in improved quality of washing. The present invention, either one of the drums is rotated or both the drums are rotated in the opposite directions to provide better relative motion between the bristled surface of the drum and the clothes to be washed, resulting in better quality of washing. This invention covers not only two drums of variable gaps between them, but also all possible variants of them in which either one or both drums are powered, manually or autonomously, and in vertical, horizontal and in-between angles of the axis of rotation, for better quality of washing.<br>
To illustrate the above stated objects, in one variant of the present invention, the outer elliptical drum, inner circular drum, paddles 15 to topple the clothes, washing brushes are combined together to form the drum assembly which is responsible for improved quality of washing. Various other variants of the current invention that are possible are circular outer drum 1 and concentric or eccentric circular inner drum 2 figure 7, n-sided polygon<br><br>
outer drum 1 with a any arbitrary shaped concentric or eccentric inner drum 2 for the pressing action of the clothes figure 8, n-sided polygon outer drum 1 with a concentric or eccentric n-sided polygon inner drum 2, any arbitrary shaped outer drum 1 with a concentric or eccentric any arbitrary shaped inner drum 2 for the pressing action of the clothes, elliptical outer drum 1 with a concentric or eccentric elliptical inner drum 2.<br>
Another important feature of the present invention is its portability. The drum assembly is equipped with some means of supplying power for moving the drums, as well as some means of transporting the washing machine between places of residence and source of water. For instance in one variant, see figures 2 and 3, it is mounted over a lightweight frame 3 with a seat 13 having a back support 14 for improved comfort. The frame 3 is supported by two rear tires and a caster wheel 5 at the front for better manoeuvrability. Two hand grips are provided for better stability of the user. Note that this is but one variant of the present invention, which covers various three and four wheeled configurations potentially with the use of caster wheels 5 at the front or at the back and handles at the front or back for manoeuvrability as shown in figure 9-14.<br>
The present invention will be apparent in its features and structure from the detailed description of the preferred embodiment thereof in reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
General Limitations:<br>
1.	Cleaning clothes by hand is a time consuming, tedious and exhausting job.<br>
2.	Even though with the invention of washing machine washing clothes has become easier, the limitations with the current washing machines are that they cannot generally be operated without electricity and nearby source of water such as a running water tap or water pipe.<br>
3.	The problem of washing clothes is still the same for people who do not have a source of water in their homes or access to electricity.<br>
4.	Washing using conventional washing machines require an excessive amount of water as compared to what is needed for drinking, cleaning utensils etc., and carrying so<br><br>
much water is difficult and hence it is not advisable to bring the water from the water source for washing clothes.<br>
5.	Since people in rural areas prefer to go to the water source to clean clothes water at the source gets polluted with the detergent.<br>
6.	Although there are various other products available in the market for washing clothes without electricity, they are not portable and do not provide comparable degree of cleaning as in washing by hand.<br>
While the invention is susceptible of various modifications and alternative constructions, certain illustrated embodiments thereof have been shown in the drawings and will be described below in detail. It should be understood, however, that the invention is not limited to the specific form disclosed, but, on the contrary, the invention covers all modifications, alternative modifications, and equivalent falling within the spirit and scope of invention as defined in the claims.<br>
One variant of the present invention is shown in figures 1-3 with several other variants of the drum assembly as illustrated in figures 4-8.<br>
Referring to figure 1, a perspective assembly view of the drum of the first embodiment is shown. In this embodiment, elliptical outer drum 1 is fitted with bristles 12 and paddles 15. The inner circular drum is also fitted with bristles 11. The bristles are attached to the surface of the drums. In order to prevent the leakage, water proof silicon sealant is applied near the rivets from the outer side of the outer drum. A door 9 is provided on the outer drum for insertion and removal of clothes. The dimension of the drums can be variously modified to accommodate a variety of different requirements depending upon the dry clothes capacity of the washing machine.<br>
In this variant, the circular drum is fitted inside the elliptical drum, and both the drums are concentric. A door 9 is fitted on the outer drum 1 with hinge 10. Rubber Gasket 16 is provided between door 9 and outer drum 1 surface to avoid leakage. A bearing 30 is fitted on the inner side of the outer drum 1 on which inner drum 2 is mounted. Inner drum<br><br>
shaft 32 is fitted on inner drum 2 as shown in FIG. 1 to mount inner drum 2 on the bearing 29 in the acrylic sheet 8 shown in FIG 2.<br>
Referring now to figure 2, a perspective view of one variant of the complete washing machine is shown. The drum assembly is mounted over the frame 3 with the help of two V shaped supports 22 &amp; 23. The V shaped support 22 visible in figure 3 is mounted to the frame 3.<br>
In this variant, the front part of the frame 3 has pedals 18 mounted on a pedal rod 19 whose two ends are supported on bearings 33 fitted to frame 3. One end of the pedal rod 19 is fitted with sprocket 20 which is connected with the sprocket 21 on the shaft 31 of the outer drum. Caster wheel 5 equipped with a pulling rod 4 is provided at the front end of the frame 3 for easy manoeuvrability of the machine. Frame 3 is equipped with seat 13 and backrest 14 for the comfort of the user. The hand supports 34 are provided on both the sides of the seat 13 to assist the user in pedalling. The frame 3 is supported by two wheels 6 &amp;7 at the rear. These wheels 6 &amp; 7 will easily override the uneven terrain encountered in the rural areas. Acrylic sheet 8 is mounted to cover the open face on the outer drum 1 and to provide visibility of clothes while washing. The bearing 29 is mounted in the acrylic sheet 8 to support inner drum 2 as described before. A bearing 27 is mounted in left support 23 to support entire drum assembly and to allow free rotation. A chain 17 is mounted on front sprocket 20 and back sprocket 21 to transmit power. Pedals 18 are mounted on pedal rod 19 for pedalling the entire drum assembly through chain 17. Pedal grove 25 is mounted on the frame 3. Pedal rod 19 is supported on pedal grove 25 with the help of bearing 33. Caster wheel 5 bracket 26 is mounted on frame 3 to support caste wheel assembly 5. Soft cushion grip 35 is mounted on handle support 34 for better and comfortable grip. Soft cushion grip 36 is mounted on handle 4 for comfortable gripping while pulling the entire assembly.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 4-8, these are some of the variants of the drum assembly in which the outer circular, elliptical, n-sided polygonal or any arbitrary shape drum 37, 1, 48 may be mounted concentrically or eccentrically over an inner elliptical, circular, n-sided polygonal, or any arbitrary shaped drum 42, 2, 46. Similarly another variant of the drum<br><br>
assembly has only the outer drum, which can be of any shape such as circular, elliptical, polygonal, with washing bristles 11 fitted on the inner surface as depicted in FIG. 9. The washing bristles 38 &amp; 43 can be of any stiffness and the drums can rotate in any direction or for the sake of simplicity one may be held stationary while the other is rotated. Pedals 41 are fitted on outer drum of any shape in various configurations shown to create proper tumbling of clothes inside the outer drum.<br>
Figures 10 &amp; 11 illustrate some of the variants of the washing machine in case of the manually powered washing variety of the invention. These figures represent some alternative arrangements of the drum assembly and seating system. As shown in figure 9 the drum assembly and seating system are placed on either side of the frame 3 with pedalling system and transmission fitted in between them whereas in figure 10 the drum assembly is mounted exactly below the seating system to reduce the size of the frame 3.<br>
Referring to figures 12-14, these are some of the variants in which the arrangements of wheels 6 &amp; 7 differ on the frame 3 in case of manually powered washing drum. As shown in figure 12 that there are two wheels 6 &amp; 7 at the rear end and caster wheel 5 at the front end whereas in figure 13 there are two wheels 6 &amp; 7 at the back and two wheels at the front. Another variant in which all the four wheels are caster wheels 5 is depicted in figure 14.<br>
This machine can be utilized as a complete solution for taking clothes to the water source, washing the clothes and bringing the clothes back from the water source.<br>
An amount of liquid, usually water, together with a cleaning agent such as detergent is added to the drum for the washing process. To begin the washing process the user locks the door 9 and begins pedalling, in the case of the manually powered variant. Due to the pedalling action the drum rotates which results in production of froth, brushing and tumbling of clothes. This brushing and tumbling action drives water through the clothes and cleans the clothes by releasing soil from the dirty clothes into the water. The number of washing cycles depends upon the condition of the clothes used for washing. When the clothes have achieved the desired quality of cleanliness, they may be rinsed, removed<br><br>
from the drum, wrung out and dried. The drainage of dirty water from the drum takes place through the drain valve 24. Before carrying out the rinsing cycle the dirty water is removed and fresh water is added through the door 9. 50 litres of water i.e. about two buckets of water is sufficient for one washing or rinsing cycle for washing 5 kg of dry clothes, and typically takes 35- 40 minutes. This is a substantial improvement over the manual washing cycle, which for comparable quality requires about 200 litres of water and about 120 minutes of washing time, and conventional washing machines, which require approximately 200 litres of water and 65 minutes of washing time. It is to be noted that manual washing using similar brushes typically lead to a greater damage to clothes than if cleaned using our invention.<br>
While in this description the clothes are added first to the drum and then the liquid, it is to be understood that these steps can be taken in any order depending upon the necessities and preferences of the user of the device.<br>
As well as providing an autonomously powered means if necessary, this device provides the option of having a manual means of cleaning clothes in a way that reduces damage to the clothes and requires less time and less water than traditional hand washing methods. This machine is also designed in such a way that enables them to be economically affordable to a wider variety of people in rural areas.<br><br><br><br>
