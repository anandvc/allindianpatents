				<td>BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an arrangement in a spinning machine for condensing<br>
a fibre strand, comprising a condensing zone arranged downstream of a front roller pair<br>
of a drafting unit, also comprising an air-permeable transport belt which transports the<br>
fibre strand through the condensing zone, also comprising a sliding surface arranged to<br>
the condensing zone which sliding surface guides the transport belt, and also<br>
comprising a suction slit, bordered by two lateral edges, arranged in the sliding surface,<br>
which suction slit comprises a fibre guiding edge which positions the fibre strand<br>
transversely to the direction of motion of the transport belt, and which suction slit has<br>
a widened starting area for seizing the transversely traversing fibre strand.<br>
The purpose of the condensing zone arranged downstream of the drafting unit is to<br>
condense or bundle by means of lateral gathering of its lateral fibres the drafted, but<br>
still twist-free fibre strand, so that when the spinning twist is imparted, a so-called<br>
spinning triangle does not occur. The produced thread is then more tear-resistant, more<br>
even and less hairy. The transversing of the fibre strand serves to prevent the<br>
premature wear of the aprons and roller coatings which are part of the drafting unit.<br>
An arrangement of the above mentioned type is prior notorious use and is described in<br>
the older, but subsequently published German patent application 199 49 666.8. The<br>
known arrangement comprises a suction slit, which begins with a starting width, which<br>
seizes the not yet condensed fibre strand in its entire width and while in traverse<br>
motion. Directly after the fibre strand has been seized, the suction slit in the known<br>
arrangement in the form of a delta graduates to a narrower effective width into an<br>
overall transverse suction slit, whose fibre guiding edge continues an edge of the delta<br>
without any deflection. The not yet condensed fibre strand thus reaches, in an extreme<br>
position of the traverse motion, a lateral edge of the suction slit - at this point in delta<br>
form - which lateral edge is facing away from the actual fibre guiding edge. As the above<br>
mentioned lateral edge extends diagonally and, in relation to the direction of motion of<br>
the transport belt, in the opposite direction to the actual fibre guiding edge arranged<br>
downstream which serves the condensing process, the not yet condensed fibre strand is<br>
rolled in the area of the delta in another direction to the one later used in actual<br>
condensing at the fibre guiding edge. The twisting direction of the fibres changes<br>
during an extreme position of the traverse motion. This gives rise to erratic movement<br>
on the part of the fibres in the condensing zone and a periodical worsening of the yarn<br>
parameters.<br><br>
A similar disadvantage is shown in a non-generic arrangement according to<br>
German published patent application 44 26 278 A1, where a suction slit is<br>
arranged in the inside of a suction roller at a distance. The suction slit of a<br>
condensing zone begins with a relatively large initial width and tapers<br>
symmetrical in a delta-like way. The fibre strand is supposed to be disposed<br>
alternately on the right and on the left edge of the delta, whereby however, the<br>
disadvantage arises in that the fibre strand to be condensed is periodically<br>
rolled in in differing twisting directions.<br>
In German published patent application 196 23 824 an also non-generic<br>
arrangement is known, in which a suction slit is arranged on the inside of a<br>
suction roller, whereby only one lateral edge of the suction slit is designed as a<br>
fibre guiding edge. The fibre guiding edge only serves here, however, to permit<br>
two fibre strands traveling parallel at a relatively large distance to one another<br>
to run into two adjacent suction slits, and to reduce the distance of the then<br>
condensed fibre strands to one another, so that they are brought to an<br>
optimum distance from one another for the purpose of the spinning process.<br>
For this reason, the fibre guiding edge, which at the start is diagonal to the<br>
direction of motion of the suction roller, very soon graduates into a lateral edge<br>
parallel to the motion of direction, so that from this moment in time onwards<br>
the fibre strand is no longer positioned diagonally to the direction of motion of<br>
the suction roller. The order is such that in the case of an extreme position of<br>
the traverse motion, the relevant fibre guiding edge is touched by the fibre<br>
strand only over a very short distance.<br>
US 6,338,183 B1 discloses condensing arrangement for fibre strand<br>
downstream of a drafting unit of a spinning machine. The condensing zone<br>
comprises a stationary suction slit of transporting the fibre strand over it by an<br>
air permeable transporting element. The air stream is used for positioning the<br>
fibres of the fibre strands diagonally to the direction of the motion of the<br>
transport condensing the fibre strand.<br><br>
US 6,185,790 B1 discloses a condensing zone for condensing a drafted fibre<br>
strand arranged downstream of a drafting arrangement in a ring spinning<br>
machine.<br>
A perforated transport belt is provided for transporting the fibre strand over a<br>
suction slit of a sliding surface. The transport belt drives a nipping roller for<br>
limiting the condensing zone on its exists cites with he leaping point acting as<br>
a twist block. The nipping roller presses the fibre strands and the transport<br>
belt against the sliding surface of the condensing zone.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to avoid the rolling-in of the fibre strand<br>
in differing directions in an arrangement of the above mentioned type and to<br>
improve the quality of the yarn.<br>
This object has been achieved in accordance with the present invention in that<br>
only one lateral edge of the suction slit is designed as a fibre guiding edge,<br>
which, from the beginning, positions the fibre strand, despite its traverse<br>
movements, in the starting area up to the end of the suction slit, diagonally to<br>
the direction of motion of the transport belt.<br>
As only one lateral edge is designed as a fibre guiding edge, a change in the<br>
twisting direction during the condensing rolling in of the fibre strand is<br>
prevented. Furthermore, as the fibre strand, despite its traverse movements,<br>
reaches this one fibre guiding edge from the beginning at the widened starting<br>
area, the fibre guiding edge remains, despite the traverse movement, essentially<br>
constantly effective along its entire length. As the fibre strand is positioned<br>
diagonally to the direction of motion of the transport belt by the fibre guiding<br>
edge right up to the end of the suction slit, the fibre strand is prevented from<br>
any slight opening out again when it leaves the suction slit. Overall, each<br>
measure serves to improve the yarn parameters.<br><br>
In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, it is provided that the fibre guiding<br>
edge is more slanted in relation to the direction of motion of the transport belt in the<br>
widened starting area of the suction slit than in the remaining areas of the suction slit.<br>
How large the angle of the slant may be, must - depending on the delivery speed and<br>
the respective fibre material -m be ascertained by means of tests. The angle of the slant<br>
should not be so large that the fibre strand to be condensed can leave the fibre guiding<br>
edge and thus also the suction slit. The angle of the slant should be as large as<br>
permissible in order that the above mentioned widened starting area of the suction slit<br>
is as short as possible. As a result of a shorter starting area, constant ratios are<br>
maintained to as large an extent as possible during condensing in both extreme<br>
positions of the fibre strand to be condensed during traverse motion. The starting area<br>
of the suction slit should measure at maximum a quarter of the length of the suction<br>
slit.<br>
In practice it has been shown that the minimum slant of the fibre guiding edge<br>
downstream of the starting area measures an angle of between 3° and 20° to the<br>
direction of motion of the transport belt.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS.<br>
These and further objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become<br>
more readily apparent from the following detailed description thereof when taken in<br>
conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:<br>
Figure 1 is a partly intersectional arrangement for condensing a fire strand;<br>
Figure 2 is a view in the direction of the arrow II of Figure 1 of the condensing zone;<br>
Figures 3 and 4, greatly enlarged, show only the contour of a suction slit according to<br>
the present invention, without the respective transport belt, whereby an extreme<br>
position of the traversing fibre strand is shown by a dot-dash line.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Of a spinning machine, in particular a ring spinning machine, only the area of an<br>
arrangement 1 for condensing a drafted fibre strand 2 are shown in Figures 1 and 2. he<br>
arrangement 1 is located directly downstream of a drafting unit 3, of which only the<br>
front roller pair 4 as well as an apron roller pair 5, arranged upstream thereof in<br>
transport direction A, are shown. The apron roller pair 5 guides a bottom apron 6 and<br>
an upper apron 7. The front roller pair 4 comprises a driven front bottom cylinder 8 as<br>
well as a front pressure roller 9 which is flexibly pressed thereagainst. The front roller<br>
pair 4 defines thus a front nipping line 10, which forms the end of the drafting zone.<br><br>
In the drafting unit 3, a sliver or alternatively a roving 11 is drafted in transport direction A in a known<br>
way to the desired degree of fineness. This drafting is at an end at the front nipping line 10, and from<br>
this point onwards, a drafted, but still twist-free fibre strand 2 is produced. In order to avoid the known<br>
and disadvantageous spinning triangel during twisting, the fibre strand 2 is condensed directly<br>
downstream of the front nipping line 10 in a condensing zone 12.<br>
The arrangement 1 for the condensing process comprises an air-permeable transport belt 13, which can<br>
be designed as a close-meshed, thin woven belt of polyamide threads, which belt transports the fibre<br>
strand 2 to be condensed through the condensing zone 12. The arrangement 1 comprises further a<br>
suction channel 14, which is designed as a hollow profile which acts under low pressure and which<br>
can extend over a plurality of spinning stations. On its outer contour facing the condensing zone 12,<br>
the suction channel 14 is designed as a sliding surface 15 for guiding the transport belt 13.<br>
In this sliding surface 15 a suction slit 16 is located, which is arranged slightly slanted in relation to<br>
the direction of motion B of the transport belt 13, so that the suction slit 16 comprises a fibre guiding<br>
edge 17 for the fibre strand 2 to be condensed. The fibre strand 2 travels along this fibre guiding edge<br>
17 during condensing, whereby the fibres located in the fibre strand 2 are bundled or condensed<br>
transversely to the direction of motion B of the transport belt 13, and the fibre strand 2 is hereby<br>
somewhat rolled in.<br>
The suction channel 14 is connected to a low pressure source (not shown) via a low pressure conduit<br>
18, which is located at a distance from the suction slit 16. If the suction channel 14 extends over a<br>
plurality of spinning stations, only one low pressure conduit 18 per machine section is required.<br>
The condensing zone 12 is bordered on its exit side by a nipping roller 19, which presses the fibre<br>
strand 2 and the transport belt 13 onto the sliding surface 15 and hereby defines a delivery nipping line<br>
20, which acts in relation to the spinning twist to be imparted as a twist block. The nipping roller 19<br>
drives the transport belt 13 and is in turn driven via a transfer roller 21 by the front pressure roller 9.<br>
Downstream of the delivery nipping line 20, the produced thread 22 receives its spinning twist,<br>
whereby it is fed in delivery direction C to a twisting element (not shown), for example a ring spindle.<br>
The delivery nipping line 20 acts in relation to the spinning twist as a twist block, so that the spinning<br>
twist does not retroact back into the condensing zone 12.<br>
On the side facing away from the suction slit 16, the transport belt 13 is tensioned by means of a<br>
tensioning element 23 , which for example can be designed as a stationary rod or a guiding roller. The<br>
tensioning element 23 is so arranged that the transport belt 13 is disposed with a slight pressure on the<br><br>
front bottom cylinder 8. As the transport belt 13 and the front bottom cylinder 8 travel in opposite<br>
directions at the point of contact, the transport belt 13 is cleaned of any adhering fibre fly.<br>
As can be seen from Figure 2, the fibre strand 2 to be condensed is traversed according to the<br>
directions D and E of the double arrow. These traverse movements serve to prevent the bottom apron<br>
6, the upper apron 7 and the flexible coating of the front pressure roller 9 from premature wear. The<br>
traverse motion according to the directions D and E, however, makes it more difficult for the fibre<br>
strand 2 to be condensed to be reach the fibre guiding edge 17 reliably. Should the fibre strand 2 not<br>
reach the fibre guiding edge 17 during seizing by the suction slit 16, but rather instead reach the other<br>
lateral edge of the suction slit 16, as is the case in the above mentioned prior art, then a temporary and<br>
periodic rolling-in movement would take place in the fibre strand 2, said rolling-in movement going<br>
temporarily in the opposite direction to the desired rolling-in movement along the fibre guiding edge<br>
17, and as a result, lowering the yarn quality.<br>
For this reason, a particular embodiment of the suction slit 16 is provided, as is described below<br>
according to the Figures 3 and 4.<br>
In the enlarged depiction of the suction slit 16 according to Figures 3 and 4, two extreme positions of<br>
the fed, traversing fibre strand 2 are indicated by dot-dash lines. According to Figure 3, the fibre strand<br>
2 has reached its left extreme position and is beginning its traverse movement according to the arrow<br>
direction E. According to Figure 4, the traversing fibre strand 2 has reached its right extreme position<br>
and is begins its reverse movement according to the arrow direction D subsequently. The traverse lift<br>
measures overall approximately 5 to 6 mm, whereby in one minute, only a very few traverse<br>
movements take place.<br>
In the enlarged depiction of the suction slit 16 according to Figures 3 and 4, the two lateral edges 24<br>
and 25 bordering the suction slit 16 can be seen, whereby it now must be ensured, that during<br>
condensing, the fibre strand 2 reaches the fibre guiding edge 17 as soon as possible in spite of the<br>
traverse movements. At the same time, it must be ensured that the traversing fibre strand 2 is actually<br>
seized by the suction slit 16.<br>
The suction slit 16 has initially on its upstream side a starting area 26, which must be at least as wide<br>
as the traversing lift. In longitudinal direction of the suction slit 16, however, the starting area 26 must<br>
be as short as possible, preferably only a quarter of the length of the suction slit 16.<br>
In contrast to Figures 3 and 4, if the starting area 26 of the suction slit 16 were to extend not to the<br>
right, but, as in prior art, to the left, then the traversing fibre strand 2 could be also seized, but would,<br><br>
however, be disposed temporarily on a lateral edge of the suction slit 16 arranged opposite to the fibre<br>
guiding edge 17, which lateral edge extends diagonally in the opposite direction. This would result in a<br>
disadvantageous way to a rolling-in of the fibre strand 2 at intervals in an undesired twisting direction.<br>
For this reason, the starting area 26 of the suction slit 16 according to Figures 3 and 4 is so designed,<br>
in accordance with the present invention, that the angle of the diagonal position of the fibre guiding<br>
edge 17 in the entry area 26 is increased. As a result, the fibre strand 2 to be seized and condensed<br>
actually reaches the guiding edge 28 in the starting area 26 sooner or later, whereby the guiding edge<br>
28 increases the actual fibre guiding edge 17 towards the entry into the suction 16 and is hereby more<br>
slanted in relation to the direction of motion B of the transport belt 13 than the fibre guiding edge 17.<br>
The present invention ensures that the fibre strand 2 always reaches only the correct fibre guiding edge<br>
17, and as quickly as possibly after it has been siezed. The fibre guiding edge 17 has an angle a in<br>
relation to the direction of motion B of the transport belt 13, which angle a measures in practical<br>
embodiments between 3° and 20°. The fibre guiding edge 17 hereby extends to the end 27 of the<br>
suction slit 16, whereby the end 27 occurs at approximately the same place as the delivery nipping line<br>
20. This ensures that the condensed, and thus somewhat rolled in fibre strand 2 cannot fluff out again<br>
at the end 27 of the suction slit 16.<br>
If the slant of the guiding edge 28 were matched to a great extent to the angle a of the actual fibre<br>
guiding edge 17, then the starting area 26 would be enlarged as a result to such an extent that the fibre<br>
strand 2 in the extreme position as shown in Figure 3 would reach the fibre guiding edge 17 much too<br>
late, as in the arrangement according to the cited German published patent application 196 23 824. In<br>
its extreme positions, the fibre strand 2 would have one short path and one long path along the fibre<br>
guiding edge 17, which would result in periodically different yarn qualities. On the other hand, a<br>
starting area 26, which was too short, could result in the fibre strand 2 in its extreme position<br>
according to Figure 4, not travelling along the guiding edge 28 , but rather leaving same and thus the<br>
suction slit 16 under the action of the transport belt 13 in its direction of motion B. The optimum angle<br>
for the guiding edge 28 must in each case be ascertained by means of tests.<br><br>
