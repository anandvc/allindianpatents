"PROCESS FOR PRODUCING OPTICALLY ACTIVE p-AMINO ALCOHOLS"<br>
DAIICHI FINE CHEMICAL CO. LTD., a Japanese company of 530, Chokeiji, Takaoka-shi, Toyama 933-8511, Japan,<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br><br>
t	OBjlCIlIPTIQN<br><br>
^ALCOIIOL.G.<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to a process for producing<br>
optically active j3 -amino alcohols.  More particularly, it relates to a process for producing optically active<br>
j3- -amino alcohols which are of value as drugs or their<br>
intermediates.<br>
Background Art<br>
Ephedrines  have  been  used  for  purposes  of perspiration, antipyresis and cough soothing from the olden times,  and particularly,  d-pseudoephedrine is known    to    possess    anti-inflammatory    action. Pharmacological action such as vasoconstriction, blood pressure elevation, or perspiration is known for 1-ephedrine  and  it  is  used  in  therapy  as  a sympathomimetic agent.  1-Ephedrine is also used in the treatment of bronchial asthma.  Specifically, processes for  the  production  of  optically  active  j3 -amino alcohols, including optically active ephedrines, are useful  in  the  manufacture  of  drugs  and  their intermediates;  thus,  there is a need for efficient production processes.<br>
In the conventional process for, producing a j3 -amino alcohol with the desired optical'activity, there<br><br><br><br><br>
was used a process by which a racemic j3 -amino alcohol is obtained and then a specific optically active form is produced by optical resolution or asymmetric synthesis among others.<br>
However, since the racemic j3 -amino alcohol has two asymmetric carbons within its molecule, complicated steps had to be  followed to obtain the  specific optically active form.  For example, according to Ger, (East)  13683  (August  27,  1957),  optically  active phenylacetylcarbinol was produced from benzaldehyde by .fermentation   utilizing   yeast   and   erythro-1-2-methylamino-1-phenyl-l-propanol   (i.e.,   1-ephedrine) could be produced by reductively condensing methylamine to the optically active phenylacetylcarbinol.<br>
To obtain pseudoephedrine, the production is possible as described in US Patent No. 4,237,304: an oxazoline is formed from 1-ephedrine produced by the method described in Ger. (East) 13683 (August 27, 1957), using acetic anhydride, and then the oxazoline is hydrolyzed through inversion to the threo form (i.e., d-pseudoephedrine)-.<br>
As stated above, to produce pseudoephedrine with the desired optical activity, from 2-methylamino-l-phenyl-1-propanone, steps are necessary such that ephedrine in the optical active erythro form is once produced and then it is inverted to the threo    form.<br><br>
2-<br><br>
Hence, there arise problems that the number of steps grows and leads to complication and that the yields 1owe r.<br>
Furthermore, in the production of the pseudoephedrine while a substantial amount of diastereomers is produced as byproducts during the reduction of the starting ketone, the recovery of the diastereomers for their use as raw material is difficult, which is economically disadvantageous.<br>
In addition, according to the method as described in the publication of JP, 8-98697, A, it is possible to produce an optically active 2-amino-l-phenylethanol derivative from a 2-amino-l-phenylethanol compound having one asymmetric carbon atom within its molecule through the use of a specific microorganism. The present state of art is, however, that there has been no efficient process for producing a j3 -amino alcohol having two asymmetric carbon atoms. Disclosure of the Invention<br>
This invention has been made in view of the above-indicated  circumstances and it aims at producing a j3-amino alcohol having the desired optical activity from an enantiomeric mixture of an a -aminoketone compound or its salt in a high yield as well as in a highly selective  manner  with  a  simple  process  while<br>
3-<br><br>
sufficiently    preventing    the    generation    of diastereomeric byproducts.<br>
The present inventors repeated studies diligently to solve the above-stated problems; consequently, it was discovered that by utilizing specific-microorganisms only one enantiomer of the enantiomeric mixture of an a-aminoketone compound or its salt could be reduced to produce the only desired kind among . the corresponding four kinds of /3 -amino alcohols in a high yield as well as in a highly selective manner. This led to the completion of the present invention.<br>

The microorganisms to which<br><br><br>
IAM  accession  numbers  have  been  designated  are described in the "Catalogue of Strains, 1993" published by Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, the Cell &amp; Functional Polymer General Center, University of Tokyo  and  are  available  from  its  preservation facilities. Further, Rhodococcus  erythropolis  MAK-34 is a novel microorganism isolated from the nature and has been deposited with National Institute of Bioscience and Human-Technology, National Institute of Advanced Science and Technology, METI locating at 1-3, Higashi 1-Chome,  Tsukuba,  Ibaraki,  JAPAN  (postal code:  305-8566) as FERM BP-7451 (the date of original deposit: February 15, 2001) .<br>
For the microorganism used in this invention, there can be used any of wild-type strains, mutant strains and -recombinant strains derived by the techniques of cell .engineering such as cell fusion or by the techniques of genetic engineering such as gene manipulations insofar as it is a microorganism capable of acting on the enantiomeric mixture of a a -aminoketone compound of the general formula (I) and producing the corresponding optically active j3 -amino alcohol of the general formula (II).<br>
There are no particular limitations to the different conditions in the culturing of the microorganisms,  and the methods that are ordinarily<br><br>
33-<br><br>
used may be carried out, where bacteria, fungi, and yeast are cultured in suitable media, respectively. Normally, there may be used liquid media containing carbon sources, nitrogen sources and other nutrients. Any sources may be used for the carbon source of the medium as long as the microorganisms can utilize them. Specifically, there may be used sugars such as glucose,' fructose,  sucrose,  dextrin,  starch,  and  sorbitol; alcohols  such  as  methanol,  ethanol,  and glycerol; organic acids such as fumaric acid, citric acid, acetic acid, and propionic acid and their salts; hydrocarbons such as paraffin; and mixtures of the foregoing.   Any sources may be used for the nitrogen source of the medium as long as the microorganisms pan utilize them. Specifically, there may be used the ammonium salts of inorganic acids such as ammonium chloride,  ammonium sulfate, and ammonium' phosphate; the ammonium salts of organic acids such as ammonium fumarate and ammonium citrate;  the  salts  of nitric acid such as  sodium nitrate  and  potassium  nitrate;  nitrogen-containing inorganic or organic compounds such as beef extract, yeast extract, malt extract, and peptone; and mixtures of the foregoing.  Nutrition sources may also be added appropriately to the medium, which are used in the normal culturing, including inorganic salts, the salts of minute metals, and vitamins.   There may also be<br><br><br>
added to the medium, a substance for inducing the activity of a microorganism, a buffer substance effective to maintain pH, or the like.<br>
The substances for inducing the activity of a microorganism include an activity, inducer having the general formula (III) :<br>
/R6<br>
4/Y\/\	(IE)<br>
R4        V<br>
wherein R4 represents lower alkyl; Rs and R6 may be the same or different and each represents a hydrogen atom, lower alkyl, or acyl; Y represents C=0 or CH-OH.<br>
The lower alkyl and acyl groups include the ones<br>
previously defined respectively.   Specifically,  the<br>
preferred activity inducers include l-amino-2-propanol,<br>
l-amino-2-hydroxybutane,  l-acetylamino-2-propanol,  1-<br>
methylamino-2-propanol, l-amino-2-oxopropane, 2-amino-<br>
3-hydroxybutane, and the like.  When asymmetric carbons<br>
are present in these compounds, the compounds may be<br>
either of optically .active forms and racemates, and may<br>
appropriately be  selected.   The addition of these<br>
activity inducers to medium induces the activity of<br>
microorganisms  and  the  subsequent  generation  of<br>
optically active  j3 -amino alcohols to progress with<br>
higher efficiency as compared to the case with no such<br>
addition.    The  activity  inducers  may  be  used<br><br><br>
individually, or may be used as a mixture of plural inducers. The addition levels of such activity inducers are desirably 0.01 to 10 wt. % relative to medium.<br>
Culturing of microorganisms can be carried out under  the  conditions  suited  for  their  growth. Specifically, it can be done at the pH of medium being 3-10, preferably pH 4-9 and at a temperature of 0-50 C,  preferably  20-40  °  C.     The  culturing  of .S  microorganisms  can be carried out under aerobatic conditions or anaerobatic conditions.   The culturing time is preferably from 10 to 150 hours and should be appropriately   determined   for   the   respective tmicroorganisms.<br>
The reaction method in the- production of j3 -amino alcohols according to this invention is not particularly limited insofar as it is a method by which the microorganism acts on the enantiomeric mixture of the a-amino ketone compound having the general formula (I) or a mixture thereof to produce the corresponding<br>
optically active |3 — amino alcohol compound having the general formula (II). The reaction is allowed to start by mixing bacterial cells washed with buffer or water to a aqueous solution of the starting a-aminoketone.<br>
The reaction conditions can be selected, from the range within which the generation of the optically<br><br>
•25-<br><br>
active j3 -amino alcohol compound having the general formula  (II)  is  not  impaired.    The  quantity  of bacterial cell is preferably 1/100 to 1000 times, and more preferably 1/10 to 100 times that of racemic aminoketone.     The  concentration  of  the  racemic aminoketone that is a substrate is preferably from 0.01 to 20%, and more preferably from 0.1 to 10%.  Further, the pH of reaction solution is preferably from 5 to 9, and  more  preferably  from  6  to  8;  the  reaction temperature is preferably from 10 to 50 ° C, and more preferably from 20 to 40 ° C.   Still further,  the reaction time is preferably from 5. to 150 hours and it should be appropriately determined for the respective microorganisms.<br>
In  order  for  the  reaction  to  progress  more efficiently,  sugars  (e.g.,  glucose),  organic acids (e.g.,  acetic  acid),  and  energy  substances  (e.g., glycerol) may be added.  These may.be respectively used alone or may be used as a mixture thereof.  The level of addition is preferably 1/100 to 10 times that of substrate.  Coenzymes or the like may also be added. Coenzymes such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)  can be used alone or as a mixture of the<br>
27<br><br>
foregoing.  The level of addition is preferably from 1/1000 to 1/5 times that of the racemic aminoketone. In addition to these coenzymes coenzyme-regenerating enzymes such as glucose dehydrogenase may also be added; and the level of addition is preferably from 1/100 to 10 times that of the racemic aminoketone. Further, sugars (e.g., glucose), organic acids (e.g., acetic acid), and energy substances (e.g., glycerol), coenzymes,    coenzyme-regenerating   enzymes,    and substrates for the coenzyme-regenerating enzymes may respectively be combined for use.  These substances are naturally accumulated in bacterial cells, but where their addition as required can increase the reaction rate and yield, they may be appropriately selected.<br>
Furthermore, when a certain salt is added such that the reaction solution may. be as described above and the reaction solution is allowed to react under that condition, the racemization of the unreacted a -aminoketone isomer can be accelerated and its conversion to the enantiomer that serves as the substrate for microorganism can be progressed more efficiently. 'This tends to produce the objective amino alcohol in a high yield of 50% or more from the starting material.<br>
The salts for accelerating the racemization of the unreacted a  -aminoketones may be the salts of weak<br>
28<br><br>
acids such as acetate,  tartrate',, benzoate, citrate, malonate,   phosphate,   carbonate,   p-nitrophenolate, sulfite,  and borate.    Preferably,  there are used phosphates (e.g., sodium dihydrogenphosphate, potassium dihydrogenphosphate, and ammonium dihydrogenphosphate), carbonates    (e.g.,    sodium   carbonate,    sodium hydrogencarbonate,  potassium carbonate,  and ammonium carbonate), citrates (e.g., sodium citrate, potassium citrate, and ammonium citrate), for example.   These mixtures may also be used, and desirably, buffers with pH 6.0-8.0 are added to give final concentrations of from 0.01 to 1 M.   For example, in the case of a phosphate,  sodium  dihydrogenphosphate  and  sodium monohydrogenphosphate are desirably mixed at a ratio of from 9:1 to 5:95.<br>
The optically active a-amino alcohols produced by<br>
reaction   may   be   purified   by   conventional<br>
separation/purification means.   For example, directly<br>
from the reaction solution or after the bacterial cells<br>
are separated, optically active j3 -amino alcohols can<br>
be obtained by being subjected to normal purification<br>
methods such as membrane separation or extraction with<br>
an organic solvent  (e.g.,  toluene and chloroform),<br>
column  chromatography,   concentration  at  reduced<br>
pressure,    distillation,    recrystallization,    and<br>
crystallization.<br>
