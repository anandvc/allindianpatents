				<td>INHALATION KIT COMPRISING INHALABLE POWDER OF TIOTROPIUM<br>
The invention relates to a method for the administration of powdered preparations containing tiotropium by inhalation.<br>
Background to the invention Tiotropium bromide is known from European Patent Application EP 418 716 A1 and has the following chemical structure:<br>
(Structure Removed) <br>
Tiotropium bromide is a highly effective anticholinergic with a long-lasting activity which can be used to treat respiratory complaints, particularly COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and asthma. The term tiotropium refers to the free ammonium cation.<br>
For treating the abovementioned complaints, it is useful to administer the active substance by inhalation. In addition to the administration of broncholytically active compounds in the form of metered aerosols and inhalable solutions, the use of inhalable powders containing active substance is of particular importance.<br>
With active substances which have a particularly high efficacy, only small amounts of the active substance are needed per single dose to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. In such cases, the active substance has to be diluted with suitable excipients in order to prepare the inhalable powder. Because of the large amount of excipient, the properties of the inhalable powder are critically influenced by the choice of excipient. When choosing the excipient its particle size is particularly important. As a rule, the finer the excipient, the poorer its flow properties. However, good flow properties are a prerequisite for highly accurate metering when packing and dividing up the individual doses of preparation, e.g. when producing capsules for powder inhalation or when the patient is metering the individual dose before using a multi-dose inhaler. It has also been found that the particle size of the excipient has a considerable influence on the proportion of active substance in the inhalable powder<br>
which is delivered for inhalation. The term inhalable proportion of active substance refers to the particles of the inhalable powder which are conveyed deep into the branches of the lungs when inhaled with a breath. The particle size required for this is between 1 and 10 µm, preferably less than 5 µm.<br>
Finally, it has been found that the intended therapeutic effect upon the administration of a pharmaceutical composition via inhaltion can be decisively influenced by the inhalation device.<br>
Accordingly, the aim of the invention is to provide for a therapeutically efficient method for the administration of inhalable powders containing tiotropium. Another object of the invention is to provide for an inhalation kit comprising a tiotropium containing powder and an inhalation device, said kit being applicable in the method for administration mentioned before.<br>
Detailed description of the invention In the method according to the invention an inhalable powder containing tiotropium, preferably in an amount of 0.001 to 5 %, in admixture with a physiologically acceptable excipient is administered.<br>
Of particular interest for the method according to the invention is an inhalable powder containing 0.01 to 2 %, preferably 0.04 to 0.8 %, more preferably 0.08to 0.64 % tiotropium in admixture with a physiologically acceptable excipient is administered. More preferably in the method according to the invention an inhalable powder containing 0.1 to 0.4 % tiotropium in admixture with a physiologically acceptable excipient is administered.<br>
By tiotropium is meant the free ammonium cation. The counter-ion (anion) may be chloride, bromide, iodide, methanesulphonate, para-toluenesulphonate or methyl sulphate. Of these anions, the bromide is preferred.<br>
Accordingly, the method according to the present invention preferably relates to inhalable powders which contain tiotropium in form of tiotropium bromide in an amount of 0.0012 to 6.02 %, in admixture with a physiologically acceptable excipient. Of particular interest for the method according to the invention is an inhalable powder containing 0.012 to 2.41 %, preferably 0.048 to 0.96 %, more preferably 0.096 to 0.77 % tiotropium bromide In admixture with a physiologically acceptable excipient is administered.<br>
More preferably in the method according to the invention an inhalable powder containing 0.12 to 0.48 % tiotropium bromide in admixture with a physiologically acceptable excipient is administered.<br>
Tiotropium bromide is, depending on the choice of reaction conditions and solvents, obtainable in different crystalline modifications. Most preferred according to the invention are those powder preparations, that contain tiotropium in form of the crystalline tiotropium bromide monohydrate. Accordingly, the powdered preparations obtainable according to the invention preferably contain 0.0012 to 6.25 % crystalline tiotropium bromide monohydrate in admixture with a physiologically acceptable excipient is administered. Of particular interest for the method according to the invention is an inhalable powder containing 0.0125 to 2.5 %, preferably 0.05 to 1 %, more preferably 0.1 to 0.8 % crystalline tiotropium bromide monohydrate in admixture with a physiologically acceptable excipient is administered. More preferably in the method according to the invention an inhalable powder containing 0.12 to 0.5 % crystalline tiotropium bromide monohydrate in admixture with a physiologically acceptable excipient is administered.<br>
Examples of physiologically acceptable excipients which may be used to prepare the inhalable powders applicable according to the invention include, for example, monosaccharides (e.g. glucose or arabinose), disaccharides (e.g. lactose, saccharose, maltose), oligo- and polysaccharides (e.g. dextrane), polyalcohols (e.g. sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol), salts (e.g. sodium chloride, calcium carbonate) or mixtures of these excipients with one another. Preferably, mono- or disaccharides are used, while the use of lactose or glucose is preferred, particularly, but not exclusively, in the form of their hydrates, preferably in the form of their monohydrates.<br>
In the method according to the invention the average particle size of the physiologically acceptable excipient is preferably between 10 to 500 µm, more preferably between 15 to 200 µm, most preferably between 20 to 100µm. If not otherwise emphazised the term average particle size according to the invention is to be understood as the Mass Median Aerodynamic Diameter (MMAD). Methods for the determination thereof are known in the art.<br>
Besides the coarser particle fraction of the excipient mentioned hereinbefore, the excipient can optionally additionally contain a specifically added fraction of excipient of finer particle size. This finer particle size fraction is characterized by an average particle size of 1 to 9 Mm, preferably 2 to 8 ↨0m, more preferably 3 to 7 µm. If a finer particle fraction is present the proportion of finer excipient in the total amount of excipient is 1 to 20 %, preferably 3 to 15%, more preferably 5 to 10%.<br>
 When reference is made to a mixture within the scope of the present invention, this always means a mixture obtained by mixing together clearly defined components. Accordingly, when an excipient mixture of coarser and finer excipients is mentioned, this can only denote mixtures obtained by mixing a coarser excipient component with a finer excipient component.<br>
The percentages given within the scope of the present invention are always percent by weight.<br>
In the method according to the invention the inhalable powders mentioned hereinbefore may effeciently be adminstered using inhalers that are characterized by a specific flow resistance (R).<br>
The flow resistance of inhalers can be calculated via the following formula:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein	v is the volumetric flow rate (l/min),<br>
p is the pressure drop (kPa), and R is the flow resistance.<br>
In the method according to the invention the flow resistance R characterising the inhaler is in a range of about 0.01 - 0.1 √kPa min/l preferably in the range of about .0.02-0.06 -√kPa min/l.<br>
Accordingly, the invention relates to a method for the administration of an inhalable powder containing tiotropium, preferably in an amount of 0.001 to 5 %, in admixture with a physiologically acceptable excipient with ah average particle size of between 10 to 500 µm, and further characterized in that the said tiotropium containing powder is administered by an inhaler displaying a flow resistance of about 0.01 - 0.1 √kPa min/l.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention relates to a method for the treatment of airway diseases, particularly COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and asthma, characterized in that an inhalable powder containing tiotropium, preferably in an amount of 0.001 to 5 %, in admixture with a physiologically acceptable excipient with an average particle size of between 10 to 500 µm, is administered via inhalation by an inhaler displaying a flow resistance of about 0.01 - 0.1 √kPa .min/l.<br>
In another embodiment the invention relates to the use of an inhaler for the administration of a tiotropium containing inhalable powder via inhalation, characterised in that the inhalable powder contains tiotropium, preferably in an amount of 0.001 to 5 %, in admixture with a physiologically acceptable excipient with an average particle size of between 10 to 500 µm, and further characterized in that the said inhaler displays a flow resistance of about 0.01 - 0.1 √kPa min/l.<br>
In yet another embodiment the invention relates to an inhalation kit consisting of an inhaler displaying a flow resistance of about 0.01 - 0.1 √kPa min/I and an inhalable powder containing tiotropium, preferably in an amount of 0.001 to 5 %, in admixture with a physiologically acceptable excipient with an average particle size of between 10 to 500 µm.<br>
In another preferred embodiment according to the invention the inhaler described in Figure 1 is applied. For the administration of tiotropium containing powders by inhalation by means of the inhaler according to figure 1, it is required to fill appropriate amounts of the powder into capsules. Methods for filling powders into capsules are Known in the art.<br>
The inhaler according to figure 1 is characterised by a housing 1 containing two windows 2, a deck 3 in which there are air inlet ports and which is provided with a screen 5 secured via a screen housing 4, an inhalation chamber 6 connected to the deck 3 on which there is a push button 9 provided with two sharpened pins 7 and movable counter to a spring 8, a mouthpiece 12 which is connected to the housing 1, the deck 3 and a cover 11 via a spindle 10 to enable it to be flipped open or shut and three holes 13 with diameters below 1 mm in the central region around the capsule chamber 6 and underneath the screen housing 4 and screen 5. The main airflow enters the inhaler between deck 3 and base 1 near to the hinge. The deck has in this range a reduced width, which forms the entrance slit for the air. Then the flow reverses and enters the capsule chamber 6 through the inlet tube. The flow is then further conducted through the filter and filter holder to the mouthpiece. A small portion of the flow enters the device between mouthpiece and deck and flows then between filterholder and deck into the main stream. Due to production tolerances there is some uncertainty in this flow because of the actual width of the slit between filterholder and deck. In case of new or reworked tools the flow resistance of the inhaler may therefore be a little off the target value. To correct this deviation the deck has in the central region around the capsule chamber 6 and underneath the screen housing 4 and screen 5 three holes 13 with diameters below 1 mm. Through these holes 13 flows air from the base into the main air stream and<br>
 reduces such slightly the flow resistance of the inhaler. The actual diameter of these holes 13 can be chosen by proper inserts in the tools so that the mean flow resistance can be made equal to the target value.<br>

The following Examples serve to-illustrate the present invention further without restricting its scope to the embodiments provided hereinafter by way of example.<br>
Starting materials<br>
As a starting material for the synthesis of crysta;oma tropiumbromide monohydrate tiotropiumbromide obtained according to the of European patent application EP 418 716 A1 is be used.<br>
Preparation of crystalline tiotropium bromide 15.0 kg of tiotropium bromide as obtained to the methods disclosed in EP 418 716 A1 are added to 25.7 kg of able reaction vessel. The mixture is heated to 80-90°C and stirred temperature until a clear solution is -formed. Activated charcoal (0.8 kg)toned witt water, is suspended in 4.4 kg of water, this mixture is adried to the solution containing the tiotropium bromide and rinsed with 4.3 kg of water. The mixture thus obtained is stirred for at least 15 min at 80-90°C and then filtered through a heated filter into an apparatus which has been preheated to an outer temperature of 70°C . The filter is rinsed with 8.6 kg of water. The contents of the apparatus are cooled at 35°C every 20 minutes to a temperature of 20-25°C. The apparatus is further cooled to 10-15°C using cold water and crystallisation is completed by stirring for at least one hour. The crystals are isolated using a suction drier, the crystal slurry isolated is washed with 9 litres of cold water (10-15°C) and cold acetone (10-15°C). The crystals obtained are dried in a nitrogen current at 25°C over 2 hours. Yield : 13.4 kg of tiotropium bromide monohydrate (86 % of theory)<br>
The crystalline tiotropium bromide monohydrate thus obtained is micronised by known methods, to bring the active substance into the average particle size which meets the specifications according to the invention.<br>
The DSC diagram of crystalline tiotropium bromide monohydrate shows two characteristic signals. The first, relatively broad, endothermic signal between 50-120°C can be attributed to the dehydration of the tiotropium bromide monohydrate to produce the anhydrous form. The second, relatively sharp endothermic peak at 230 ± 5°C can be put down to the melting of the substance. These data were obtained using a Mettler DSC 821- and evaluated with the Mettler STAR software package. These data, like the other values given in the above Table, were obtained at a heating rate of 10 K/min.<br>
The crystalline tiotropium bromide monohydrate thus obtained was characterised by IR spectroscopy. The data was obtained using a Nicolet FTIR spectrometer and<br>
 evaluated with the Nicolet OMNIC software package, version 3.1. The measurement was carried out with 2.5umol of tiotropium bromide monohydrate in 300 mg of KBr. Table 1 shows some of the essential bands of the IR spectrum.<br>
Table 1: Attribution of specific bands<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
The crystalline tiotropium bromide monohydrate was characterised by X-ray structural analysis. The measurements of X-ray diffraction intensity were carried out on an AFC7R- 4-circuit diffractometer (Rigaku) using monochromatic copper Kα-radiation. The structural solution and refinement of the crystal structure were obtained by direct methods (SHELXS86 Program) and FMLQ-refinement (TeXsan Program). The X-ray structural analysis carried out showed that crystalline tiotropium bromide hydrate has a simple monoclinic cell with the following dimensions: a = 18.0774 A, b = 11.9711 A, c = 9.9321 A, ß = 102.691 °, V = 2096.96 A3.<br>
