				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to a method of patterning of metal contacts for solar cells<br>
and the solar cells produced thereby.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
In order to be able to satisfy the application-related demands for voltage ranges<br>
for 12 volts or higher voltages, it is necessary to connect solar cells in series<br>
Compared with the connection of discrete crystalline silicon wafers, thin-film solar<br>
cells offer a significant advantage, namely, the possibility of production by<br>
depositing large-area films onto substrates by spraying, evaporation, sputtering<br>
and chemical vapor deposition and plasma discharge processes. These films are<br>
then divided into individual solar cell areas and electrically connected.<br>
For the fabrication of a full module, an area of or the full substrate is initially<br>
completely coated with a film of transparent, electrically conductive material of tin<br>
oxide doped with fluorine or antimony, zinc oxide or indium oxide on tne top or<br>
which is added a second film with two or more layers of at least one semi<br>
conductive material, hereafter sections of these films are selectively removed to<br>
form on the substrate a plurality of regularly spaced photovoltaic cells.<br>
Subsequently applied is a large area covering film to serve as a second electrode<br>
layer. To permit the necessary series connection, this covering layer is<br>
interrupted in the direct neighborhood of those strips at which material has been<br>
selectively removed from the first electrode layer and from the semiconductor<br>
layers above it. Known method of achieving separation between individual areas<br>
referred to as "structuring or patterning" the layers-include, for example, material<br>
removal processes of a thermal, mechanical, laser scribing or those employing<br>
structuring bar or patterning" the layers-include, for example, material removal<br>
processes of a thermal mechanical, laser scribing or those employing structuring<br>
â€¢ bar or lift-off technology. However, such removal methods have considerable<br>
disadvantages. For instance, the formation of condensate on a cool point on the<br>
substrate when removing material by thermal means such as laser scribing;<br>
scattered flaked-off material and fissures in the remaining layer in the case of<br>
mechanical removal; and failure to totally remove all residues of said agent when<br>
removing material by chemical means in lift off technique.<br>
The present methods for patterning the second electrode in a thin film module<br>
provide lower yield due to remnants of the traces of the etched material or its<br>
modified form in the area between the strips and this results in poor yields.<br>
Further, screen-printing of a pattern is quite simple and the technique is suitable<br>
for providing high throughput. The printing may be done by a conducting paste<br>
such as silver paste, which can behave as a mask during the acid etching and<br>
can be left in place during lamination of the modules. This helps in protecting the<br>
underlined metal layer during further processes of edge sandblasting, soldering<br>
and lamination. However, a conductive paste is found to give poor yields due to<br>
shorting of the cells through defects of the films. Also silver paste is very<br>
expensive and is not economical to be used in terrestrial low efficiency solar<br>
cells.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to propose a method of patterning of<br>
metal contacts for solar cells, which gives high yields and better performance.<br>
,lt is a further object of this invention to propose a method of patterning of metal<br>
contacts for solar cells, which provides additional protection to the cell during<br>
outdoor deployment of the solar cells.<br>
Another object of this invention to propose a method of patterning of metal<br>
contacts for solar cells, which is cost effective and simple.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Thus according to this invention is provided a process for the production of<br>
amorphous silicon solar cell modules comprising the steps of depositing of a first<br>
electrode of a layer of transparent conducting oxide (TCO) on a substrate, screen<br>
printing grid line soft silver paste on the TCO layer, followed by laser scribing<br>
alongside the grid lines to obtain isolated cells, deposition of amorphous silicon<br>
cells on the surface of isolated cells followed by deposition of. a. second electrode<br>
or a metal layer on the entire surface, screen printing parallel strips silver paste<br>
or acid etch resist paste on the metal layer in a manner such that the parallel<br>
strips overlap with the grid line and leave small gaps there between, etching<br>
away the metal layer from the gaps followed by connecting the electrical contacts<br>
to end bus-bars.<br>
According to this invention is further provided an amorphous silicon solar cell<br>
module comprising a substrate;<br>
parallel strips of a first electrode of transparent conducting oxide (TCO) on the<br>
substrate;<br>
grid lines on the TCO layer;<br>
amorphous silicon cells deposited on TCO layer and the grid lines;<br>
a second electrode of a metal layer; disposed over the silicon cells and<br>
connected in series to the first electrode by said grid lines interposed between<br>
the first electrode and the amorphous silicon cells and,<br>
a layer of acid etch resist provided on the second electrode, leaving gaps there<br>
between and the second electrode being interrupted in gaps alongside the strips.<br>
In accordance with this invention a method for patterning of the second electrode<br>
is provided, which employs a chemical process for which the second electrode<br>
requires masking from etchants, which are usually acid or salts which remove<br>
deposited metal by metal displacement reaction such as ferric nitrate for silver<br>
layer etching.<br>
In the present invention, acid etch resist has been used as a masking material.<br>
The said material can be dispensed with screen-printing process in the required<br>
pattern usually parallel strips with desired pattern. The paste can be used on a<br>
thin second electrode layer where the said electrode layer can be 200-nano<br>
meter thick silver layer deposited by vacuum evaporation or sputtering.The<br>
paste can be left or removed on the second electrode after etching the metal<br>
layer from the in between space of the printed strips.<br>
The process essentially involves two-screen printing and one laser-scribing step<br>
for the cell patterning and integration. The first step involves cleaning of the<br>
glass, followed by TCO deposition, screen printing ot grid pattern will silver, laser<br>
scribing, silicon deposition by plasma CVD process and finally silver deposition<br>
by DC magnetron sputtering. This is then followed by screen printing of silver for<br>
masking the layer for patterning and interconnects or alternately printing by acid<br>
etch resist, etching of silver from in between spaces of strips and consequently<br>
soldering and lamination.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS:<br>
The invention will now be illustrated with the help of the accompanying drawings<br>
where<br>
Fig 1 shows the amorphous silicon solar cell module according to the invention.<br>
The module comprises a substrate ((1) usually made of glass, on which the TCO<br>
layer (2) is deposited. Grid lines 3 of silver paste are printed on the TCO layer (2)<br>
followed by laser scribing the TCO layer at positions (4) alongside the grid lines<br>
to lead to individual sub cells. Amorphous silicon cells (5) of single junction or<br>
double junction type are deposited on the grid lines (3) followed by sputter<br>
deposition of a metal layer, such as for example, a silver layer on the entire-<br>
surface. A layer (7) of acid etch resist is screen-printed on the metal layer,<br>
leaving small gaps (8) for metal etching. The metal is etched away from the gaps<br>
(8) leaving individual cells. The positive and negative contacts are taken from the<br>
end grid lines (bus bars).<br>
The solar module thus consists of series-connected solar sub cells. The solar<br>
sub cells consist of glass substrate as base for all the thin film solar strips and<br>
consist a first electrode of transparent conducting oxide and the second electrode<br>
of a metal such as silver as described herein before. The series connection<br>
between the sub cells is made through screen printed silver lines which are thick<br>
enough and have roughness so that the semi conducting layer is not able to offer<br>
resistance between the first and the second electrodes. The pattering of the<br>
Sencod electrode is done by masking it from the acidic etchants using acid etch<br>
resist. This resist has been found to provide better yields than using a conducting<br>
paste for masking and did not show environmental degradation in the<br>
performance of the modules even though it was not removed after the patterning.<br>
The invention will now be explained in greater detail with the help of the following<br>
non-limiting example<br>
Example:<br>
Double junction amorphous silicon solar modules were fabricated utilizing the<br>
acid etch resist for the patterning of the second electrode. Glass substrates of 1<br>
mm and 3mm thickness and 300 mm by 900 mm were cleaned in an online<br>
detergent scrubbing clean station. Layers of 70 to 150 nanometer thick of silicon<br>
dioxide and 600 to 800 nanometer thick layer of transparent conducting oxide<br>
such as fluorine doped tin oxide known as transparent conducting electrode,<br>
were deposited by chemical vapor deposition technique. The transparent<br>
conducting layer has a sheet resistance of less thar10 ohm/square and<br>
transmission of 78 to 82% with haze 4 to 15%. Parallel 400-micrometer wide<br>
lines of silver paste at a separation of 2 centimeter were screen printed and fired<br>
at 550 degree Celsius for 10 minutes. The transparent electrode was patterned<br>
alongside these lines by using a laser. A set of photovoltaic layers P,l, N,P,I,N of<br>
amorphous silicon where P layers are silicon carbide and N layer of first junction<br>
is microcrystalline nature. The second electrode of-Silver-metal with 150-to 400-<br>
nanometer thickness was deposited on the entire-area. 2 centimeter wide parallel<br>
strips of silver paste or acid etch resist paste were screen printed on the second<br>
electrode such that these overlap the screen-printed silver lines and leave a 500<br>
to 800 micrometer wide exposed area of this second electrode to be removed by<br>
etchant such as aqueous solution of ferric nitrate. After patterning of the second<br>
electrode, the electrical contacts were connected to the end bus bars and the<br>
module was laminated and packaged.<br>
These modules were tested under a solar simulator and yielded an efficiency of<br>
6.5 to 7% as produced. These modules were mounted in streetlights and other<br>
application and were found to stabilize at 5.0 to 5.5%.<br>
The solar cells patterned with acid etch resist provides better yields and<br>
performance than the modules patterned with silver paste. The modules<br>
patterned with acid etch resist do not show environmental degradation in the<br>
field.<br>
The acid etch resist provides additional protection from moisture. The acid resist<br>
need not be removed after patterning as it helps in protecting the solar cell while<br>
it is deployed in the field for solar power generation. The acid etch resist provides<br>
significant cost advantage over silver printed contact. The printing of the acid<br>
etch resist can be adopted for mass production of thin film modules using screen-<br>
printing.<br>
