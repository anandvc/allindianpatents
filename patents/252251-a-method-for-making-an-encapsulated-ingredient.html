				<td>ENCAPSULATED PARTICLES<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to the field of starch encapsulation. It relates to particles comprising encapsulated ingredients, methods for making them, compositions containing them and uses for such particles. Background of the Invention and Prior Art<br>
Encapsulating specific ingredients in a starch-based encapsulate is well known where it is desired to form a water-soluble barrier between the component and its environment. The encapsulation is usually to protect a sensitive ingredient from its environment, or vice versa. For example in some compositions such as detergent compositions, one or more components may be sensitive to the atmosphere and/or the detergent matrix and encapsulation can therefore be used to protect such components during storage, prior to entry into the wash water.<br>
Furthermore, most consumers have come to expect perfumed detergent products and to expect that fabrics and other items which have been laundered with these products also have a pleasing fragrance. However, some perfume ingredients are not stable on storage so that they need to be protected on storage as described above. In addition, for perfumes there is an additional factor that consumers do not like to be overwhelmed by strong perfume odours on opening the box or other container for detergent products. In order to provide sufficient odour on laundered fabrics, a relatively high amount of perfume is needed in a laundry product. Even then, since considerable dilution of the detergent occurs, there may be very limited fragrance on the laundered clothes. However, high loadings of perfume tend to make unacceptably strong odour for the detergent product itself. Encapsulation has therefore developed as a way of introducing more perfume into a product where it is desired that the product itself should not have a very strong odour.<br>
Other examples of such products are any product where a subtle odour and/or flavour is required in the neat product and a stronger odour and/or flavour on contact of the product with water, such as in flavoured foods, bar soaps, paper products for use in the home such as towels, fragranced dryer sheets, etc. Other applications of starch encapsulation include encapsulation of Pharmaceuticals and/or vitamins, where the encapsulation may be used to protect the pharmaceutical/vitamin and/or may be beneficial in making unpleasant-tasting drugs more palatable. The invention may also be used to encapsulate ingredients in the fields of personal care including hair care, papers products, animal care and household products. For example, other<br><br>
components besides perfumes suitable for encapsulation include silicone oils, waxes, hydrocarbons, higher fatty acids, essential oils, lipids, skin coolants, sunscreens, glycerine, catalysts, bleach particles, silicon dioxide particles, malodour reducing agents, antiperspirant actives, cationic polymers and mixtures thereof.<br>
Examples of starch encapsulation are disclosed for example in WO 99/ 55819, WO 01/40430, EP-A-858828, EP-A-1160311 and US 5955419. However, starch encapsulates such as those described in these applications are limited: relatively large amounts of starch have to be used for encapsulation and in addition, in the case of encapsulating oils such as perfume oils, some free oil is always present on the outside of the encapsulate particles.<br>
The present inventors have found that it is possible to alleviate these problems and to prepare an encapsulated ingredient using lower amounts of starch. The present invention provides the additional benefit that where the encapsulated material comprises free oil, this invention reduces the free oil on the outside of encapsulates. This is particularly beneficial in the encapsulation of perfume oils as it enables incorporation of higher levels of perfume into products such as detergent compositions without increasing the dry odour of the detergent composition. One other problem that may be associated with manufacture of starch encapsulates is related to the production of finely particulate material during manufacture. Since these materials are flammable, a build up of very fine particles may be explosive in the presence of oxygen and a source of ignition such as a spark. The present invention has surprisingly been found to have a considerable impact on reducing this problem. Definition of the Invention<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is provided a method for making an encapsulated ingredient comprising (a) preparing a mixture comprising starch, water, acid and ingredient for encapsulation, the acid being incorporated in the mixture in an amount sufficient to lower the pH of the starch-water mixture by at least 0.25 units; and (b) atomising and drying the mixture thereby forming encapsulated ingredient.<br>
In accordance with further aspects of this invention there are provided encapsulated ingredients obtainable by the out-lined process and products containing such encapsulated ingredients.<br>
All percentages, ratios and proportions herein are on a weight basis unless otherwise indicated. All documents cited are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
In the first step in the process of the present invention an aqueous mixture is prepared comprising starch, water, ingredient for encapsulation and acid. These ingredients may be added in any order, but usually the starch-water mixture is prepared first and subsequently,<br><br>
either sequentially or together, the acid and ingredient for encapsulation are added. When they are added sequentially, the acid may be added prior to the ingredient for encapsulation. Alternatively, the acid is added after the ingredient for encapsulation.<br>
The concentration of starch in the aqueous mixture may be from as low as 5 or 10 wt% to as high as 60 or even 75 wt%. Generally the concentration of starch in the mixture is from 20 to 50 wt%, more usually around 25 to 40 wt% in the aqueous mixture.<br>
If the concentration is very low, in order to make the encapsulated particles obtained in the present invention, the energy cost to the process is high because of the need to remove high levels of water. The limiting factor on the upper concentration limit is the need to be able to process the mixture. Higher levels of starch can be accommodated as long as the mixture can still be atomised and dried to make finished product encapsulates. Other additives may be incorporated to reduce viscosity of the starch/water mixture and improve ease of handling. Suitable examples include emulsifiers and plasticisers.<br>
Starches suitable for use in this first step can be made from raw starch, pregelatinized starch, modified starch derived from tubers, legumes, cereal and grains for example corn starch , wheat starch, rice starch, waxy corn starch, oat starch, cassava starch, waxy barley starch, waxy rice starch, sweet rice starch, amioca, potato starch, tapioca starch and mixtures thereof.<br>
Modified starches may be particularly suitable for use in the present invention, and these include hydrolyzed starch, acid thinned starch, starch having hydrophobic groups, such as starch esters of long chain hydrocarbons (C5 or greater), starch acetates, starch octenyl succinate and mixtures thereof. Starch esters, particularly starch octenyl succinates are especially preferred.<br>
The term "hydrolyzed starch" refers to oligosaccharide-type materials that are typically obtained by acid and/or enzymatic hydrolysis of starches, preferably corn starch. It may be preferred to include in the starch water-mixture, a starch ester. The hydrolyzed starches preferred, particularly for starch ester or mixture of starch esters, preferably have Dextrose Equivalent (DE) values of from 20 to 80, more preferably from 20 to 50, or even 25 to 38 DE. The DE value is a measure of the reducing equivalence of the hydrolyzed starch referenced to dextrose and expressed as a percent (on a dry basis). The higher the DE value, the more reducing sugars present. A method for determining DE values can be found in Standard Analytical Methods of the Member Companies of Corn Industries Research Foundation, 6th ed. Corn Refineries Association, Inc. Washington, DC 1980, D-52.<br>
Particularly preferred starches are those wherein the starch is gelatinised and the hydrophobic group comprises an alkyl, or an alkenyl group which contains at least five carbon atoms or an aralkyl or aralkenyl group which contains at least six carbon atoms. Preferred starches for use in the present invention are starch esters. These will typically have a degree of<br><br>
substitution in the range of from 0.01% to 10 %. The hydrocarbon part of the modifying ester should preferably be a C5 to a C]6 carbon chain. As stated above octenyl succinate is the preferred ester. Preferably, octenyl succinate (OSAN) substituted waxy corn starches of various types such as 1) waxy starch, acid thinned and OSAN substituted, (2) blend of corn syrup solids: waxy starch, OSAN substituted and dextrinized, 3) waxy starch: OSAN substituted and dextrinised, 4) blend of corn syrup solids or maltodextrins with waxy starch: acid thinned OSAN substituted then cooked and spray dried, 5) waxy starch: acid thinned OSAN substituted then cooked and spray dried; and 6) the high and low viscosities of the above modifications (based on the level of acid treatment) can also be used in the present invention.   Mixtures of these, particularly mixtures of the high and low viscosity modified starches are also suitable.<br>
Particularly preferred are the modified starches comprising a starch derivative containing a hydrophobic group or both a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic group which has been degraded by at least one enzyme capable of cleaving the 1,4 linkages of the starch molecule from the non-reducing ends to produce short chained saccharides to provide high oxidation resistance while maintaining substantially high molecular weight portions of the starch base. Such starches are described in EP-A- 922 449.<br>
The aqueous starch mixture may also include a plasticizer for the starch. Suitable examples include monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides and maltodextrins, such as glucose, sucrose, sorbitol, gum arabic, guar gums and maltodextrin.<br>
The acid used in the process of the invention may be any acid. Examples include sulphuric acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulphamic acid and phosphonic acid. However, carboxylic organic acids are more highly preferred, particularly preferred are the organic acids comprising more than one carboxylic acid group. Examples of suitable organic acids include citric acid, tartaric acid, maleic acid, malic acid, succinic acid, sebacic acid, adipic acid, itaconic acid, acetic acid and ascorbic acid, etc. Saturated acids are more usually used in the present invention. Particularly preferred is citric acid.<br>
The acid is added to lower the pH of the mixture. Generally the acid is added to lower the pH of the mixture by at least 0.25 pH units, preferably by at least 0.5 units, or even at least 1 or 1.5 or 2 pH units. At the concentrations used in this invention, preferred starches provide a pH with water of no greater than 4.0. Typically, acid is added to lower the pH of the starch-water mixture to a value of 3.5 or below, or even below 3 or even below pH 2.<br>
The ingredient for encapsulation may be any of the ingredients mentioned above as suitable for encapsulation, either alone or in combination with one another or with fillers, carriers and/or solvents. The invention is particularly aimed at encapsulation of flavour and/or perfume components and/or detergent active ingredients. It is particularly suitable for encapsulating<br><br>
ingredients comprising an oil component. The invention is also suitable for encapsulating such components present in microcapsules for example as disclosed in WO 2004/016234.<br>
Useful ingredients for encapsulation include materials selected from the group consisting of perfumes such as 3-(4-t-butylphenyl)-2-methyl propanal, 3-(4-t-butylphenyl)-propanal, 3-(4-isopropylphenyl)-2-methylpropanal, 3-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2-methylpropanal, and 2,6-dimethyl-5-heptenal, D-damascone, D-damascone, D-damascone, D-damascenone, 6,7-dihydro-l,l,2,3,3-pentamethyl-4(5H)-indanone, methyl-7,3-dihydro-2H-l,5-benzodioxepine-3-one, 2-[2-(4-methyl-3-cyclohexenyl-l-yl)propyl]cyclopentan-2-one, 2-sec-butylcyclohexanone, and D-dihydro ionone, linalool, ethyllinalool, tetrahydrolinalool, and dihydromyrcenol; silicone oils, waxes such as polyethylene waxes; hydrocarbons such as petrolatum; essential oils such as fish oils, jasmine, camphor, lavender; skin coolants such as menthol, methyl lactate; vitamins such as Vitamin A and E; sunscreens; glycerine; catalysts such as manganese catalysts or bleach catalysts; bleach particles such as perborates, percarbonates, peracids or bleach activators; silicon dioxide particles; antiperspirant actives; cationic polymers, such as ditallowoyl ethanol ester dimethyl ammonium chloride, and mixtures thereof. Suitable ingredients can be obtained from Givaudan of Mount Olive, New Jersey, USA, International Flavors &amp; Fragrances of South Brunswick, New Jersey, USA, or Quest of Naarden, Netherlands.<br>
Other examples of perfume materials that are suitable for encapsulating using the encapsulation method of the present invention are those described in WO99/55819 from page 3. Particularly preferred perfumes for encapsulation according to the present invention include the HIA perfumes mentioned in that patent application, particularly those having a boiling point determined at the normal standard pressure of about 760 mmHg of 275 °C or lower, an octanol/water partition coefficient P of about 2000 or higher and an odour detection thresholdof less than or equal 50 parts per billion (ppb). The preferred perfume ingredient have logP of 2 or higher.<br>
Following the formation of the aqueous mixture comprising starch, water, ingredient for encapsulation and acid, the mixture is mixed under high shear to form an emulsion or dispersion of ingredient for encapsulation in the aqueous starch solution. Where the ingredient for encapsulation is an oil, the mixing should be at sufficient shear and for sufficient time to result in oily droplets having a diameter no greater than 2mm, preferably no greater than 1,5mm and preferably no greater than 1 mm, as measured under a microscope.<br>
Any suitable technique may then be used for the final stage of processing where the aqueous mixture including acid and ingredient for encapsulation is atomised and dried. Suitable techniques include, but are not limited to those known in the art including spray drying, extrusion, spray chilling/crystallisation methods, fluid bed coating and the use of phase transfer catalysts to<br><br>
promote interfacial polymerization. Spray efficiencies may be increased by methods known in the art, such as by using high drying towers, lightly oiling the chamber walls, or using preconditioned air in which the moisture has been substantially removed.<br>
The activity (payload) of the finished encapsulated product can be above 40 wt%, or above 50 wt% or even above 60 wt% or above 62 wt% of the starch encapsulated active ingredient. When the encapsulated ingredient comprises an oily component, it has been found that in accordance with the present invention, these surprisingly high payloads are also associated with unusually low free oil on the outside of the encapsulate. Thus for an activity of a perfume oil such as orange oil of 60 wt%, in accordance with the present invention, the encapsulates may also have a free oil content (measurement method given below) of no more than 1%, preferably below 0.75, or even below 0.5 wt%.<br>
Measurement Method for Free Oil<br>
Ig of Starch Encapsulates comprising encapsulated oil component is placed in a 40 mL glass vial. Then 5 mL of Hexane and 5 mL of a solution of hexadecane in hexane [(0.3mg/mL)] are added into the same vial. The sample is shaken gently by hand for 2 min and let stand for 20 min to allow the particle to settle, an aliquot is taken for injection into the GC. In case the solution is not clear after the 20 min, the solution can be filtered [through a 0.45um PDVF disc]. The hexadecane solution is used as internal standard. The quantification is done by comparison with the response from a Reference solution of the encapsulated oil in hexane which also contains the internal standard. The Reference solution is prepared based on free oil expected so similar GC responses are obtained from samples and reference, [for levels of free oil 
The next stage is the formation of the encapsulates: the starch-water mixture is agitated and atomised in any conventional means, for example by being pumped to a spray drying tower and and being atomised for example from a spinning disc reactor. The sprayed droplets are then dried, encapsulates resulting.<br>
The residence time of the acid in the water-starch mixture prior to atomisation is generally at least 15 minutes and no more than 72 hours. More usually the residence time will be no more than 24 o 12 or even 1 hour.<br>
Other known methods of manufacturing the starch encapsulates of the present invention include but are not limited to, fluid bed agglomeration, extrusion, cooling/crystallisation methods and the use of phase transfer catalysts to promote interfacial polymerisation.<br>
11 may be preferred to incorporate into the mixture prior to the atomisation and drying stages, emulsification components or systems. Modified starches having emulsifying and emulsion stabilizing capacity such as starch esters, particularly octenyl succinates have the ability<br><br>
to entrap ingredients for encapsulation, particularly perfume oil droplets in the emulsion due to the hydrophobic character of the starch modifying agent. The ingredient for encapsulation such as perfume oils or flavourings remain trapped in the modified starch until contacted with water, for example on dissolution of a laundry detergent in wash solution, due to thermodynamic factors i.e. hydrophobic interaction and stabilization of the emulsion because of steric hindrance.<br>
Preferred starches are described in EP-A-922499, US 4977252, US5354559 and US 5935826.<br>
The encapsulated particles may contain perfumes or other ingredients suitable for incorporation into detergent compositions. The encapsulated particles are then added into detergents in an amount to provide the desired concentration of encapsulated component in the final detergent, for example at levels up to 50 wt% or higher depending on the encapsulated component. Generally, the encapsulated component will be a specialised ingredient usually added in small amounts, for example perfume or bleach components, particularly catalyst components. These will usually be present in amounts of from 0.01 wt% based on the detergent composition to 20 wt%, or from 0.05 to 10 wt% or from 0.05 to 3.0% or 0.05 to 1 wt%. the encapsulated particles preferably have a size of from about 1 micron to about 1000 microns. The particle size is controlled by the size of the suspensed particles in the mixture that is atomised and dried and the conditions of the atomising and drying stages.<br>

Examples<br>
The following are examples of the invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
Emulsion Preparation and Spray Drying to form Encapsulated Perfume Particles<br>
500g of HiCap 100 modified starch (supplied by National Starch &amp; Chemical) are dissolved into<br>
lOOOg of deionised water to produce a homogeneous solution. 40g of anhydrous citric acid is<br>
added to the starch solution and the mixture agitated for 10 minutes to dissolve the citric acid. At<br>
this point, 600g of perfume are added. High shear mixing is then carried out for 10 minutes at<br>
around 2000rpm using a ARD-Barico high shear mixer to produce an emulsion.<br>
The emulsion is then pumped into a spray drier using a peristaltic pump and then spray-dried in a Production Minor cocurrent spray dryer manufactured by Niro A/S. A rotary atomising disc type FS 1, also from Niro A/S, is used to atomise the slurry. The air inlet temperature in the spray drier is 200°C and the outlet temperature 90°C. The disc speed is set at 28,500 rpm. The tower is stabilized at these conditions by spraying water for 30 minutes before spray drying the emulsion. The dried particles are collected after particle/air separation in a cyclone. The particles produced had a mean particle size of 35 microns.<br>
The perfume particles produced are suitable for incorporating into the detergent compositions exemplified below. Levels of incorporation are generally from 0.01 to 10 wt% based on the total weight of the detergent composition.<br><br>
