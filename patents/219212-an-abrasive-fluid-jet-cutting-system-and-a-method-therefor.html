This invention relates to an Abrasive Fluid Jet Cutting System and a method there<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an abrasive fluid jet cutting system and in particular although not solely to a system for supplying a pressurized slurry from a pressurized abrasive slurry containing vessel to an abrasive-jet nozzle(s) to enable cutting or other abrasive-fluid jet machining operation to be carried out.<br>
Background and Prior Art<br>
Abrasive fluid jet systems in the art are used in many applications where precision -cutting is required An example of such an application is the singulation of substrates. One type of abrasive jet system utilizes abrasive that is stored and discharged under pressure from a pressure vessel to mix with the driving fluid immediately before the nozzle to form an abrasive slurry. Such mixing is achieved by a venturi effect The slurry is normally then accelerated through a nozzle to form an abrasive fluid jet tool for cutting substrates.<br>
Such existing systems require the separate and independent delivery of abrasive for each of the nozzles where a multi-nozzle cutting head is to be provided Such independent delivery requires independent control and increases the chances of one or more nozzles of the multi-nozzle cutting head operating in a less than ideal condition.<br>
An alternative configuration of mixing an abrasive with a fluid is for example shown in WO 95/29792. In the system of WO 95/29792, a pressure vessel is provided within which an abrasive and a fluid under pressure are able to mix prior to being delivered via a conduit to the nozzle.<br>
WO 00/52679 describes a fluid supply system having a high pressure fluid supply (31, 32) which provides fluid under pressure via an inlet (6) to an entrainment vessel (1) in which the fluid can take up another component such as an abrasive material. An outlet (51) from the vessel leads to a nozzle (54). A jet pump (61) has an outlet (64) which is connected via a valve (65) to the junction between the vessel discharge tube (51) and the<br><br>
system outlet (54). When the valve (65) is closed, pressurized fluid supplied to the high pressure inlet (62) of the jet pump (61) passes via the lower pressure inlet (63) of the jet pump, to the inlet (6) of the vessel (1), then through the vessel entraining the abrasive material, before flowing through the vessel discharge tube (51) to the nozzle (54). The valve (65) is opened to allow isolation valve (52) to be flushed and closed to stop the flow to the nozzle. This arrangement does not dilute the abrasive discharge by introducing a diluting flow near the lower end of the discharge tube, nor allow this diluting flow to flush the vessel discharge tube (51) when the abrasive discharge is stopped<br>
As increasingly higher liquid pressures are being used to take advantage of the increases in cutting power, liquid compressibility becomes an important factor. When it is required to stop discharging abrasive slurry and depressurise die abrasive slurry pressure vessel to pause the operational process or to facilitate abrasive recharge, as a result of the high pressures generated, there remains within the pressure vessel a volume of compressed fluid. With conventional state of the art systems, as die compressed volume is de-pressurised its only route of escape is through the discharge conduit, the inlet of which is positioned within slurry confinement Hence a volume of slurry continues to be discharged giving rise to problems with nozzle blockages. Such blockage comes about because the discharged slurry is under a lower than normal operational pressure and lacks sufficient momentum to settle in the delivery pipe or nozzle in a manner to avoid blockage.<br>
Such undesired discharge may for example occur if the slurry containment pressure vessel pressuring pump fails. Since the slurry in the pressure vessel is under high pressure and is compressed by the pump, upon failure of the pump the compressed slurry will expand and continue, for at least for a short period, to deliver the slurry through the delivery pipe to continue to discharge an abrasive slurry from the nozzle.<br>
In designing a solution it is important to avoid problems, including high wear rates and reliability concerns, brought about by the high pressures and the working medium itself which contains abrasives.<br><br>
It is an object of the present invention to mitigate the above disadvantages and to avoid nozzle blockage or to provide the public with a useful choice.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments of the Invention<br>
The present invention relies on the natural tendency for fluid to take the path of least resistance to enable compressed fluid volume to be released into a discharge conduit with the design being such that the discharge is absent of abrasive.<br>
With reference to Figure 1, which is a diagram, illustrating a first embodiment of the invention, there is provided a pressure vessel 11 which provides a compartment for retaining an abrasive slurry. An abrasive slurry is a mixture of an abrasive material which is entrained within a fluid such as for example water or a liquid composition containing water. The vessel 11 contains the abrasive slurry 2 above which a layer of liquid 4 is provided. This liquid 4 is the same liquid used to entrain the abrasive particles to provide the slurry but which above a certain level "L" in the vessel is not mixed with abrasive.<br>
A source of pressurised fluid 10 which incorporates a pressurizing pump feeds fluid to the vessel 11. Feeding of fluid from the source 10 is through delivery conduits 14 and 15.<br><br>
Conduit 15 is provided to deliver fluid to the uptake and delivery conduit 16 to thereby provide the appropriate dilution to the slurry being displaced through the opening 30. This dilution may be necessary to avoid blockage of the uptake and delivery conduit<br>
Conduit 14 is the main delivery and vessel pressurising conduit. In the configuration of the invention shown in figure 1, the conduit 14 has its outlet opening 24, defining a first opening in the vessel 11 within the fluid only region of the pressure vessel (i.e. above L)<br>
A hopper 17 feeds abrasive slurry 2 to the vessel 11 through conduit 19.<br>
A pressure relief conduit 21 is provided to be in fluid communication with the volume in vessel and be in flow contact with the fluid absent of abrasive. In the configuration of figure 1, the flow contact is provided via part of said delivery conduit 14. A fluid valve 13 controls the flow of fluid across pressure control conduit 21.<br>
In normal operation of the system the pump system delivers pressurised fluid to the vessel and this causes the displacement of abrasive slurry 2 via the inlet opening 30 of the slurry uptake and delivery conduit 16 to nozzle 12. The inlet opening is positioned below L and preferably near the bottom of the vessel 11.<br>
The pressure relief conduit 21 can be considered a by pass conduit to by pass the flow of volume of the vessel which contains abrasive. The control of the bypass is achieved by a fluid flow control valve 13 which is closable to close the conduit 21.<br>
In the configuration of Figure 1, the conduit 14 is connected to the top of the vessel 11 where there is no abrasive 2 present On depressurisation (when for example the fluid source 10 fails, is or is about to be turned off) the fluid valve 13 connecting conduit 21 to the delivery conduit 14 outside of the vessel is opened. The volume of the content inside the vessel 11 will remain compressed but will wish to expand. Two openings are available but such expansion will have a preference to discharge through conduit 21, instead of through the opening 30 of the delivery conduit 16. This is because expansion of the volume by displacement of slurry flow through the opening 30 of the conduit 16 whose internal diameter, length and most predominantly because of the density and viscosity of the slurry bed 2 leads to a higher flow resistances.<br><br>
On start-up and pressurisation of the system, fluid valve 13 will initially be open. The fluid will flow from source 10 into the vessel 11 through conduit 14. With fluid valve 13 open some of the fluid flow will enter conduit 21. Pressurization of the vessel will also occur but this is reduced because of the partial flow diversion. In the preferred form where the pressure relief conduit 21 is connected to the slurry uptake and delivery conduit 16 upstream of the second opening 30 (and preferably outside of said vessel) the combination of resistance of slurry flow up through the opening 30 and the fact that the flow of fluid through the conduit 21 and into the uptake and delivery conduit 16 creates a back pressure in that part of the uptake and delivery conduit towards the opening 30, no slurry will travel to the nozzle. Upon closing of the valve 13 there will then be sufficient mass flow into the slurry pressure vessel 11 to cause a displacement of abrasive into the inlet opening 30 of conduit 16.<br>
With valve 13 closed, the fluid flow from source 10 asters the vessel 11 through conduit 14 thus causing displacement of abrasive slurry into the inlet opening 30 of the uptake and delivery conduit 16 where it mixes with the main flow from conduit 15 and is carried to the nozzle through die uptake and delivery conduit 16 to the nozzle 12.<br>
Abrasive flow can also at any time be halted by opening valve 13. On de-pressurisation, fluid valve 13 is open to provide an alternative and preferred route through conduit 21 for the compressed fluid. Upon expansion of the contents in the vessel such expansion is via the relief conduit 21. Conduit 14 has its opening in the vessel above level L, which ensures that the abrasive slurry is not able to reach fluid valve 13 and it hence normally operates on clean water and with a minimal pressure differential hence its service lifetime will be generally higher than would otherwise be the case, hi addition the inner diameter of conduit 21 should be sufficiently large to ensure that the velocity of the escaping fluid is well below the settling velocity of the abrasive slurry 2 used In this way any abrasive particles in the vessel above Level "L" will further be prejudiced not to enter or travel along the conduit 14 and enter the conduit 21 through the fluid valve 13.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a second embodiment of the invention where a separate relief conduit 21 is provided.   Unlike the first embodiment shown in Figure 1, conduit 21 is not<br><br>
connected to conduit 15, and serves purely as a route of escape for the compressed volume in vessel 11. The second fluid valve 23 always operates on clean fluid, and the fluid valve 13 operates less frequently, i.e. only at pressurisation and depressurisation stages. As a result, wear on valve 13 is decreased. The provision of the second fluid valve 23 is preferred but not essential.<br>
In situation where a flow diversion is required when the pump pressurizing the source 10 fails, a loss in pressure in the conduit 14 or at the pump may be detected by a pressure sensor thereby automatically opening valve 13 to provide pressure relief within the vessel through the conduit 21. In situation where the flow of abrasive slurry is desired to be stopped but where the pump pressurising the source 10 continues to operate, the valve 13 may merely be opened and fluid may continue to flow into the vessel 11 through the conduit 14 and 15 (if this is not separately closed) but since the path of least resistance of the pressurised material within the vessel is through the conduit 21, water will enter and merely exit above L thereby ensuring only water will exhaust through the conduit 21 out towards the nozzle 12. This flow will continue as long as the pump pressurizing at the fluid source 10 continues to operate, the equilibrium of pressure of the compressed fluid is not reach and the valve 13 remains open.<br>
A diaphragm pump 18 is used to draw fluid 4 from conduit 20, which creates a pressure drop in vessel 11 which in turn draws in abrasive slurry 2 from hopper 17 to vessel 11. In the particular embodiment in Figure 2, with fluid valve 13 and second fluid valve 23 closed, the diaphragm pump 18 is used to withdraw fluid through conduit 20 from the vessel creating a vacuum to draw in abrasive slurry 2 from the hopper 17 through conduit 19.<br>
It would be appreciated that the system avoids fluid compressibility problems leading to unwanted discharging of abrasives to the nozzle at system pressurising and depressurizing states. By providing an alternative route of less resistance for expansion of the compressed fluid volume from within the vessel from a point where no abrasive is carried to the nozzle and so the invention helps prevent nozzle blockages.<br><br>
With reference to Figure 3, an opening submerged in the slurry. In this configuration a separate opening providedalternative configuration is shown wherein the delivery conduit is positioned to have the first  by the pressure relief conduit is required to be positioned above L. The provision of the first opening 24 near the second 30 is that better mixing of the abrasive with the water to form the slurry is achieved nearer the second opening.<br>
A further alternative is shown in figure 4 wherein the pressure relief conduit exhaust not into the uptake and delivery conduit but to a different location. This is a less preferred option in that the pressure from the fluid in the conduit 21 can not be used to provide a back pressure to fluid in the uptake and delivery conduit 16 and hence some slurry (during expansion in volume of the contents of the vessel) may travel into the uptake and delivery conduit through the opening<br>
The invention described herein is susceptible to variations, modifications and/or additions other than those specifically described and it is to be understood that the invention includes all such variations, modifications and/or additions which fall within die spirit and scope of the above description.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
