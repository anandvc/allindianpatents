				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a fused azepine derivatives<br>
The present invention relates to a class of novel chemical entities which act as agonists of the peptide hormone vasopiessin. They reduce urine output from the kidneys and so ,are useful in the treatment of certain human diseases characterized by polyuria. They are also useful in the control of urinary incontinence and bleeding disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
Vasopressin is a peptide hormone secreted by the posterior pituitary gland. It acts on the kidney to increase water retention and so reduce urine output. For this reason, vasopressin is alternatively known as "antidiuretic hormone". It also acts on the vasculature, where it produces a hypertensive effect. The ceiular receptors that mediate these two actions have been characterised and shown to be different. The antidiuretic action is mediated by the type-2 vasopressin receptor, commonly called the V2 receptor. Agents that can interact with the V2 receptor and activate it in the same way as vasopressin are caBed V2 receptor agonists (or simply V2 agonists). Such agents will have an antidiuretic action. If these agents interact selectively with the V2 receptor and not the other vasopressin receptor subtypes, then they wiH not have the hypertensive effect of vasopressin. This would be an important safety consideration and make such agents attractive for the treatment of human disease conditions characterised by polyuria (which is herein taken to mean excessive urine production).<br><br>
(Figuer Removed) In fact, such an agent is already in use in human therapy. Desmopressin (otherwise [1-desamino, D-Arg8]vasopressin, Minirin™, DDAVP™, Octostim™) is a peptide analogue of vasopressin which is selectively an agonist at the V2 receptor. It is used in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus, which is a condition that results from defective secretion of vasopressin. It is also employed in the control of nocturnal enuresis and may also be of use in the control of nocturia. However, desmopressin is not an ideal agent in all respects. Even the best current syntheses of the agent are lengthy, and desmopressin is not amenable to the most convenient of purification techniques such as crystallisation. Consequently, desmopressin is relatively expensive. It has a very low oral bioavailability, and there is some variability in this parameter.<br><br>
(Figuer Removed)Overall then, there is a recognised need for a selective vasopressin V2 receptor agonist that is easy to prepare and purify, and that has a high and predictable oral bioavailability. Such properties are most likely to be obtained with a non-peptide compound. Examples of such compounds are disclosed by Ogawa et a/, in International Patent Application PCT/JP96/03652 (WO97/22591), by Failli ef a/, in PCT/US98/15487 (WO99/06403), PCT/USOO/00885 (WOOO/46224), and PCT/USOO/00358 (WOOO/46227), by Dusza et a/, in PCT/US98/15495 (WO99/06409), and by Steffan and Faiili in PCT/USOO/00886 (WOOO/46225), and PCT/USOO/00658 (WOOO/46228). However the compounds disclosed in these documents are not ideal drug candidates. For example, some have only moderate selectivity for the V2 receptor and many have only very limited oral bioavailability, probably because they are poorly soluble in aqueous media. The present invention provides compounds that show a better combination of properties.<br>
The anti-diuretic action of desmopressin results in a decrease in the osmolarity of the blood, and this has been shown to be useful in the treatment and prophylaxis of sickle-cell disease. Besides its antidiuretic actions, desmopressin is used to increase the<br>
concentration in the blood of the coagulation proteins known as Faktor Vill and von WWebrand factor. In the clinical context, this mates desmopressin useful in the treatment of haemophilia A and von Willebrand's disease. Desmopressin has also been reported to show effects in the central nervous system. For example, it has been reported to be effective in the treatment of Tourette's disease and to be useful in the management of cocaine addiction. Similar applications would be open to the nonpeptide agonists of the present invention.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In a first aspect, the present invention comprises novel 4-(aminomethyl)benzamide and 6-(aminomethyl)nicotinamide derivatives according to general formulae I and 2.<br><br>
(Formula  Removed)<br>
In general formula 1, W represents either a nitrogen atom (N) or a substituted carbon atom (C-R4). The substituents R1 - R4 are each independently selected from hydrogen (H), fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl) and bromine (Br) atoms, and alkyl, trifluoromethyl (CF3), phenyl (Ph), hydroxyl (OH), alkoxy (0-alkyl), primary amino (NH2), monoalkylamino (NH-alkyl), dialkylamino (N(alkyl)2), nitro (NO2) and cyano (CN) groups. Alternatively, R2 and R3 together can be -CH=CH-CH=CH- such that together with the ring to which they are attached they form a naphthalene, isoquinoline or isoquinolin-3-one fused ring system. The relationship between the two general formulae above is dear when one considers the compound of general formula 1 in which W is nitrogen and R1 is hydroxyl. The resulting 2-hydroxypyridine can also exist as its 2-pyridone tautomer. In this tautomeric form the nitrogen atom is able to carry a substituent equivalent to R4, and such a compound is represented by general formula 2.<br>
The group G1 is a bicydic or tricyclic fused azepine derivative selected from general formulae 3 to 8. It is joined to the carbonyl group of the parent molecule (1 or 2) through the nitrogen atom of the azepine ring common to ail of 3 to 8, so as to form an amide bond.<br>
(Formula  Removed)<br><br>
In these formulae, A1, A4, A7 and A10 each represent an oxygen atom (-O-) or a methylene (-CH2-) or substituted imino (-NR5-) group. A2, A3, A9, A11, A13, A14 and A15 each represent a methine group («CH-) or a nitrogen atom (=N-). Where two or more of these occur in the same group, each is independent of the others. Thus, for example, in formula 3, A2 and A3 may both be nitrogen, both methine, or one may be methine and the other nitrogen. A5 and A6 are chosen together such that either A5 is a covalent bond and A6 is a sulphur atom (-S-), to give a thfophene ring, or A5 is a group -N=CH- and A6 is a covalent bond to give a pyridine ring. A8 and A12 each represent an imino group (-NH-), an N-methyl imino group (-NChV) or a sulphur atom (-S-). A16 and A17 may both represent a methylene group (-CHa-) or one of A16 and A17 may represent a methylene group while the other represents a hydroxymethylene group (-CH(OH)-), a difluoromethyiene group (-CF^), a substituted imino group (-NR5-), an oxygen atom (-O-), or an optionally oxidised sulphur atom (-S0a-), where a is zero, 1 or 2.<br>
The group R5 represents a hydrogen atom (H), an alkyl group, or a group -(CH2)bR6, where b is 1, 2, 3 or 4. The group R6 represents a group selected from phenyl, pyridyl, hydroxy (-OH), alkoxy (-O-akyl), primary amino (-NH2), mono- and dialkylamino (-NH-alkyl and N(alkyl)2), n'rtro (-NO2), carboxy (-CO2H) and cyano (-CN) groups.<br>

In general formula 9, Ar represents an aromatic group selected from phenyl, pyridyl,<br>
naphthyl  and   mono-  or  polysubstituted   phenyl  and   pyridyl  groups,   wherein   the<br>
substituents are selected from fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl) and bromine (Br) atoms and alkyl,<br>
hydroxy (-OH),  alkoxy  (-O-alkyl),  primary amino  (-NH2),  mono- and  dialkylamino<br>
(-NH-alkyl and N(alkyl)2), nitro (-NO2), carboxy (-COzH) and cyano (-CN) groups.<br>
The values of c, d and e are independently zero or 1, provided that d and e are not both<br>
zero.<br>
In general formula 10, D represents a covalent bond or an imino group (-NH-). The group R7 represents a hydrogen atom (H), an alkyl or alkenyl group, or a group -COR8, in which R8 represents a hydroxy (-OH), alkoxy (-O-alkyl), primary amino (-NHj&gt;) or mono- or dialkylamino (-NH-alkyl and N(alkyl)2) group, or a cyclic amino group selected from pyrrolidinyl (-N(CH2)4) and piperidinyl (-N(CH2)s)- The value of f is zero, 1, 2, 3 or 4.<br>
In general formula 11, E1 and E2 represent either two monovatent atoms or groups, which may be the same or different, or together they represent a divalent atom or group. When E1 and E2 represent monovalent atoms or groups, these may both simultaneously be hydrogen (H) or fluorine (F) atoms or methoxy (-OWIe) groups, or one may be a fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br) atom, or a hydroxy (-OH), alkoxy (-O-alkyl), benzyloxy (-OBn), phenoxy (-OPh), acetoxy (-OAc), azido (-N3), primary amino (-NH2), benzylamino (-NHBn) or acetamido (-NHAc) group and the other is a hydrogen atom (H). When E1 and E2 together represent a divalent atom or group, this may be an oxygen atom (=O) or an a.co-dioxa- or dithiapolymethylene group (-O(CH2)gO- or -S(CH2)gS-), in which the value of g is either 2 or 3.<br>
F1 and F2 may both represent a hydrogen (H) atom. Alternatively, they may together represent an oxygen (=O) or sulphur (=S) atom. L represents a group selected from hydroxy (-OH), alkoxy (-O-alkyl), primary amino (-NH2) and monoalkylamino (-NH-alkyl) groups and -NR9R10, wherein either R9 and R10 each represent alkyl groups which may be the same or different, or together they represent a polymethylene group (-(CH2)h-) in which h can be 3, 4 or 5, or -(CH2)2O(CH2)r.<br>
As used herein, the term "alkyl" includes saturated hydrocarbon residues, including linear, branched and cyclic groups, with up to six carbon atoms. Examples of alkyl groups include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, /7-butyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl, ferf-butyl, neopentyl and cyclohexyl groups.<br>

Certain compounds within the scope of the present invention may exist as tautomers. For example, when W is nitrogen and R1 or R2 is a hydroxy group, or when Ar is pyridyl further substrtuted by a hydroxy group, the resulting hydroxypyridine can exist as the pyridone tautomer. All such tautomers are considered to be within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Certain compounds of general formula 1 are capable of forming salts with acids or bases. For example, compounds containing one or more basic nitrogen atoms can form addition salts with mineral and organic acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, methanesulphonic acid, citric acid and benzole acid. Compounds containing acidic groups can form salts with bases. Examples of such salts include the sodium, potassium, calcium, triethylammonium and tetraethylammonium salts. Furthermore, compounds that have both acidic and basic groups can form internal salts (zwiterions). Insofar as these salts are pharmaceutically acceptable, they are included within the scope of the invention.<br>

The compounds act to reduce urine output, and so the method of the invention can be applied to all conditions in which elevated urine output is a contributory factor. The compounds also increase the production of the blood coagulation proteins known as Factor VIII and von Willebrand factor, and so the treatment of bleeding disorders can be undertaken.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the condition treated is central diabetes insipidus. This is a condition caused by an inability of the body to produce and secrete physiologically active vasopressin, with the result that water re-uptake is greatly reduced and large volumes of urine are produced.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the condition treated is nocturnal enuresis. This is defined as bladder emptying while the individual is sleeping. It is a condition that mainly affects children and a number of factors may be involved in its etiology.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the condition treated is nocturia. This is defined as production of sufficient urine during the night to require the individual to wake and empty his (or her) bladder. Again, this condition may be the result of a number of factors.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the condition treated is incontinence. This condition is characterised, in part, by reduced bladder capacity and control such that involuntary urination occurs unless the bladder is emptied frequently. Incontinence has been divided into two conditions, stress incontinence and urge incontinence. A number of etiological factors are thought to be involved. Treatment according to the invention is particularly useful for delaying the need for bladder emptying ("voiding postponement") in order to allow the incontinent subject a dry period of a few hours (such as up to four hours). Such voiding postponement may also be useful for the non-incontinent population, for example for people obliged to remain in meetings for extended periods.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the condition treated is haemophilia A or von Willebrand's disease. This is a condition in which Factor VIII or von Willebrand factor production is reduced and the individual suffers from prolonged bleeding.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the composition is administered prior to surgery (including dental surgery) to increase the coagulability of the blood and so reduce peri-operative blood loss.<br>
The administration of the compositions of the present invention will generally be under the | control of a physician.    The physician will determine the amount of composition to be administered and the dosing schedule, taking into account the patient's physical condition and the therapeutic goals.   For an adult diabetes insipidus patient, a typical dose might<br>
be between 50mg and 1g of the active compound per day, taken as a single tablet or as up to four tablets throughout the day. For routes of administration other than the oral route, the amount of compound will be reduced, since non-oral routes tend to be more efficient in terms of delivering therapeutic agents into the systemic circulation. For the treatment of von Willebrand's disease and haemophilia A, the amount of compound may need to be higher than for the treatment of diabetes insipidus.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be prepared using methods generally known in the art. The compounds of general formulae 1 and 2 can be considered to be composed of three linked fragments, G1, G2 and the central aromatic moiety (which will be referred to here as the "core"). Reagents corresponding to the three fragments will generally be prepared separately and then combined at a late stage in the synthesis.<br>
(Formula Removed)  <br>
Some instances of the various groups and substituents might be incompatible with this assembly and so will require the use of protecting groups. The use of protecting groups is well known in the art (see for example "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", T.W. Greene, Wiley-lnterscience, 1981). Particular groups that may require protection are amines (protected as amides or carbamates), alcohols (protected as esters or ethers) and carboxylic acids (protected as esters). For the purposes of this discussion, it will be assumed that such protecting groups as are necessary are in place.<br>
The three fragments can be combined according to two strategies to give the compounds of formulae 1 and 2. In the first, the fragments corresponding to G1 and the core are linked to give a fragment corresponding to core-G1, which is then combined with fragment G2. In the second, the fragments the fragments corresponding to the core and G2 are linked to give a fragment corresponding to G2-core, which is then combined with fragment G1 . The chemistry involved in the condensation of fragment G1 with the core fragment,<br>
and that involved in the condensation of the core fragment with fragment G2, will be the same whichever strategy is followed.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The synthesis of this fragment requires the formation of an amide bond between the two moieties. Reactions of this type are well known in the art. Most conveniently, an acid chloride corresponding to the core fragment may be allowed to react with the free secondary amino group of the G1 azepine ring. Such a reaction generally is performed in an aprotic solvent such as dichloromethane or dimethylformamide at or slightly below room temperature. A tertiary amine base such as triethylamine or dimethylaminopyridine is usually added. Alternatively, the carboxylic acid corresponding to the core fragment may be condensed with the secondary amino group using one of the many reagents that have been developed for the formation of amide bonds in the field of peptide chemistry. Examples of such reagents include DCC (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide), BOP ((benzotriazd-1-yloxy)tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate), PyBOP® ((benzotriazol-1-yloxy)tripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate), PyBroP® (bromotripyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate) and HBTU (O-(benzotriazoM-yl)-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate). Other reagents are also known. The details of the synthetic method will depend on the particular reagent selected, but will generaly involve the use of an aprotic solvent and. a tertiary amine base, as described above. Either the reagent is added to a mixture of the carboxylic acid and the azepine, or the carboxylic acid and the reagent are premixed to form a reactive intermediate (which is not isolated) to which is added the azepine.<br>
Formation of fragment Gz-core<br>
Depending on the nature of G2, the G2-core bond can be part of an amide or thioamide, a sulphonamide, a urea or thiourea, a sulphonylurea or sulphonytthiourea, or a cyanoamidine, cyanoguanidine or sulphonylcyanoguanidine. The chemistry involved in the preparation of the G2-core bond will be different for each of these.<br>
(i.a) Amides (G^ = 10,<br>
 (Formula Removed)<br><br><br><br>
These compounds can be formed by the reaction of a carboxylic acid or acid chloride corresponding to fragment G2 with the primary amino group of the core fragment. Conditions for the reaction will generally be similar to those described for the formation of the core-G1 bond, except that the primary amine is more reactive than the azepine nitrogen and so tower temperatures and shorter reaction times may be used.<br>
(i.b) Thioamides {G2 = 10, D = covalent bond, V = S}<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
These compounds can be formed by the reaction of a suitable thiocarbonyl compound such as a dithioester (RCS2R') with the primary amine in a manner analogous to that described for the corresponding amides above. Alternatively, they may be prepared from the corresponding amides (V = O) by reaction with Lawesson's reagent.<br>
(ii) Sulphonamides {G2 = 9, d = 1, e = zero}<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
These compounds are generally prepared by the reaction of the sulphonyl chloride corresponding to the G2 fragment with the primary amine of the core fragment. The reaction is generally performed under conditions similar to those described above for the reaction of a carboxylic acid chloride with the primary amine that gives the amides.<br>
(iii.a) Ureas {G2 = 9, d = zero, e = 1, V = O; G2 = 10, D = NH, V = O; G2 = 11, V = O&gt;<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
These compounds can be prepared by the reaction of an amine with an isocyanate or an equivalent thereof. Due to the symmetry of the urea functional group, there is the possibility to choose which component acts as the amine and which as the isocyanate. Most simply, when G2 is a group according to 9 or 10, the corresponding isocyanate is readily accessible. It can conveniently be reacted with the primary amine of the core<br><br>
fragment in an aprotic solvent without the need for additional reagents. When G2 is a group according to 11, the isocyanate is not available, and the carbamoyl chloride can be used in its place. The carbamoyl chloride is generally prepared immediately prior to use by treating the corresponding secondary amine with phosgene or an equivalent reagent such as diphogene or triphogene. Alternatively, the use of carbonyl diimidazole leads to the formation of a carbamoyl imidazole derivative that can be used in place of the carbamoyl chloride. The reaction of the carbamoyl chloride with the primary amine generally requires the addition of a tertiary arnine base to neutralise the hydrogen chloride formed.<br>
In some cases, it may be preferable to treat the primary amine corresponding to the core fragment with phosgene (or carbonyl diimidazole) to form an isocyanate that can subsequently be reacted with the primary or secondary amine corresponding to the G2 fragment.<br>
(iii.b) Thioureas {G^ = 9, d = zero, e = 1, V = S; G2 = 10, D = NH, V = S; G^ = 11, V = S}<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
These compounds can be prepared by methods analogous to those described above for the ureas, simply by using the corresponding isothiocyanate and thiophosgene compounds.<br>
(iv.a) Sulphonylureas {G2 = 9, d = 1, e = 1, V = O} (Formula Removed)<br><br>
These compounds can be prepared by the reaction of the primary amine corresponding to the core fragment with an appropriate sulphonyl isocyanate.   The reaction conditions<br>
are similar to those described above for the reaction of an amine with an isocyanate to prepare the ureas.<br>
(iv.b) Sulphonylthioureas {G2 = 9, d = 1, e = 1, V = S}<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
ion of the primary amine corresponding to the core fragment with an appropriate suiphonyl isothiocyanate.<br>
(v.a) Cyanoamidines {G2 = 10, D = covalent bond, V = N-CN} .S<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
These compounds can be prepared by the reaction of the primary amine of the core fragment with an N-cyanothioamide or an A/-cyanothioimidate corresponding to the G2 fragment.<br>
(v.b) Cyanoguanidines {G2 = 9, d = zero, e = 1, V = N-CN; G2 = 10, D = NH, V = N-CN;<br>
These compounds can be prepared by the reaction of the primary amine of the core fragment with a cyanothiourea corresponding to the G2 fragment in the presence of a carbodiimide.<br>
(v.c) Sulphonylcyanoguanidines{G* = 9,d = 1,e = 1,V = N-CN} (Formula Removed)<br><br>
These compounds can be prepared in an analogous manner by the reaction of the primary amine of the core fragment with an W-sulphonyt-Af-cyanothiourea corresponding to the G2 fragment in the presence of a carbodiimide.<br>
The reagents corresponding to the fragments are commerciatiy available, or they can be prepared by methods described in the literature. Particularly relevant leading references include the following.<br>

Example 191.<br>
Determination of V? receptor agonist activity in vitro<br>
Agonist activity was determined for all compounds and is reported as an ECso value, being that concentration of compound necessary to cause a half-maximal cellular activation. All the compounds had ECso values of 10jiM or less, and typical results are listed in Table R.<br>

Example 192.<br>
Determination of antidiuretic activity in vivo<br>
The Brattleboro rat is a recognised model for vasopressin deficiency (for a review see FD Grant, "Genetic models of vasopressin deficiency", Exp. Phvsiol. 85, 203S-209S, 2000). The animals do not secrete vasopressin and consequently produce large volumes of dilute urine. Compounds of the invention were administered to Brattleboro rats (0.1-10mg/kg p.o. in methylcellulose. Urine was collected hourly and volumes were compared with control animals. Animals had free access to food and water throughout the experiment. Representative results are given in Table S. Results for Desmopressin are given for comparison.<br>

Example 193.<br>
Pharmaceutical composition for tablet<br>
Tablets containing 100mg of the compound of Example 39 as the active agent are prepared from the following:<br><br>
Compound of Example 39	200. Og<br>
Corn starch	71.0g<br>
Hydroxypropylcellulose	18.0g<br>
Carboxymethylcellulose calcium	13.0g<br>
Magnesium stearate	3.0g<br>
Lactose	1 95.0g<br>
soo. Og<br>
The materials are blended and then pressed to give 2000 tablets of 250mg, each containing 100mg of the compound of Example 39.<br>
The foregoing Examples demonstrate that compounds within the scope of the invention are readily prepared using standard chemical techniques, and that these compounds have the biological properties that would be expected of V2 receptor agonists. in particular, the compounds are potent antidiuretics in an animal model of vasopressin deficiency. Thus it is clear that they may be useful in the treatment of human diseases that are currently treatable with Desmopressin, such as central diabetes insipidus, nocturnal enuresis and nocturia. It has further been suggested that antidiuretics such as Desmopressin may be useful in certain types of urinary incontinence. These arguments would also extend to the compounds of the present invention.<br>
Desmopressin is also used in the treatment of certain coagulation disorders. There is good evidence to suggest that this action is also mediated through the V2 receptor (see for example JE Kaufmann e. a/., "Vasopressin-induced von Willebrand factor secretion from endothelial cells involves V2 receptors and cAMP", J. Clin. Invest. 106, 107-116, 2000; A Bernat et at., "V2 receptor antagonism of DDAVP-induced release of hemostasis factors in conscious dogs", J. Pharmacol. EXD. Ther. 282, 597-602, 1997), and hence it would be expected that the compounds of the present invention should be useful pro-coagulants.<br>
