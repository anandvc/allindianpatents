				<td>METHOD FOR PACKAGING A MICROELECTRONIC DEVICE<br>
USING ON-DIE BOND PAD EXPANSION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates generally to microelectronic circuits and, more<br>
particularly, to structures and techniques for packaging such circuits.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
After a microelectronic circuit chip (i.e., a die) has been<br>
manufactured, the chip is typically packaged before it is sold to the public.<br>
The package provides both protection for the chip and a convenient and often<br>
standardized method for mounting the chip within an external system. The<br>
circuit package must include some means for providing electrical<br>
communication between the various terminals of the circuit chip and the<br>
exterior environment. Many different packaging technologies have been used<br>
in the past for providing his communication. The type of package that is<br>
used for a particular chip can have a significant impact on the performance of<br>
the completed device. Typically, in a high volume manufacturing<br>
environment, cost will te a primary concern in selecting a packaging<br>
technology. Performance is also a very important criterion. As circuits get<br>
smaller and faster, there is an ongoing need for innovative and cost effective<br>
packaging technologies.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In the following detailed description, reference is made to the<br>
accompanying drawings that show, by way of illustration, specific<br>
embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments<br>
are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice<br>
the invention. It is to be understood that the various embodiments of the<br>
invention, although different, are not necessarily mutually exclusive. For<br>
example, a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described herein in<br>
connection with one embodimert may be implemented within other<br>
embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. In<br>
addition, it is to be understood that the location or arrangement of individual<br>
elements within each disclosed embodiment may be modified without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The following detailed<br>
description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of<br>
the present invention is defined only by the appended claims, appropriately<br>
interpreted, along with the full range of equivalents to which the claims are<br>
entitled. In the drawings, like numerals refer to the same or similar<br>
functionality throughout the several views.<br>
The present nvention relates to techniques and structures for<br>
packaging microelectronic circuits using a build up process on the surface of<br>
a microelectronic die That is, one or more metallization layers are built up<br>
over the die as par of the packaging process to provide for electrical<br>
interconnection between the terminals of the die and the exterior environment<br>
(e.g., an exterior circuit board). During wafer-level processing, a number of<br>
expanded bond pads are formed over a passivation layer on the surface of a<br>
semiconductor wafer. Each expanded bond pad is conductively coupled,<br>
through a corresponding opening in the passivation layer, to an associated<br>
bond pad on an upper metal layer of the wafer. In a preferred approach, the<br><br>
expanded bond pads are significantly larger (at least in the plane of the<br>
passivation layer) than the bond pads on the upper layer of the wafer. After<br>
the expanded bond pads have been formed, the wafer is diced into individual<br>
microelectronic die that need to be packaged.<br>
In one packaging ipproach, each individual die is fixed within a<br>
package core to form a die/'core assembly. One or more metallization layers<br>
are then built up over the die/core assembly. Because each expanded bond<br>
pad is larger than the associated bond pad below the passivation layer, a<br>
significant increase in the package to die via alignment budget is achieved.<br>
Because the expanded pads are deposited at the wafer level, rather than at the<br>
package level, wafer leve processing and fab processing capabilities can be<br>
taken advantage of. It is believed that the use of such techniques can provide<br>
a significant cost benefit during the manufacturing process. The application<br>
of the expanded bond pads at the wafer processing level can also improve die<br>
sorting capabilities during manufacture as the surface area for sort probe<br>
contact is increased. The inventive techniques can be used in connection with<br>
a wide variety of microe ectronic circuit types including, for example, digital<br>
data processing devices and logic circuits. The techniques are particularly<br>
advantageous when used in connection with multiple chip modules.<br>
As is well known, semiconductor wafers are typically large disk like<br>
structures that can carry hundreds or even thousands of independent circuits.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "independent circuits" is used to refer to the<br>
individual circuits or systems on the wafer that will eventually be separated<br>
from one another during wafer dicing. During wafer-level processing, the<br>
wafer is processed in a known manner to develop a plurality of independent <br>
circuits (e.g.,- microprocessor circuits) distributed across an upper surface,<br>
thereof. Each of the independent circuits on the wafer will usually include<br>
multiple layers of internal circuitry. Bond pads are formed on the top of the<br>
wafer to provide an electrical interface to the internal circuitry. After wafer<br>
processing is complete, the wafer is typically cut up into separate circuit chips<br>
or dice.<br>
Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are a series of simplified diagrams<br>
illustrating a method lor fabricating a microelectronic die in accordance with<br>
one embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 1 is a cross sectional side view<br>
illustrating a portion of a wafer 10 after circuitry and associated bond pads 12<br>
have been formed thoreon. For ease of illustration, the individual circuitry<br>
layers are not shown in the figures herein. Boundary lines 14 are shown in<br><br>
Fig. 1 to indicate where the wafer 10 will eventually be cut to form an<br>
individual die. Thus, the region of the wafer 10 between the two boundary<br>
lines 14 corresponds to a single independent circuit. In Fig. 1, six bond pads<br>
12 are shown between the boundary lines 14. It should be appreciated, that<br>
the actual number of bond pads 12 used in a particular circuit will vary<br>
depending upon, for example, the complexity of the circuit. In one<br>
embodiment, the bond pads 12 on the wafer are relatively thin metal<br>
structures having thicknesses typically below 4 micrometers. The dimensions<br>
of these bond pads 12 are typically dictated by the minimum requirements for<br>
electrical test and assembly and the desire to minimize total area consumed to<br>
reduce die size (e.g., more dice per wafer).<br>
With reference to Fig. 2, a passivation layer 16 is next deposited on<br>
the upper surface of the wafer 10. Among other functions, the passivation<br>
layer 16 is used to protect the underlying circuitry from the surrounding<br>
environment. Typically, the passivation layer 16 will consist of a dielectric<br>
material such as, for example, silicon nitride. Other materials and/or<br>
combinations of materials are also possible. After the passivation layer 16<br>
has been deposited, openings 18 are. formed in the passivation layer 16 to<br>
expose at least part of the underlying bond pads 12, as illustrated in Fig. 3. In<br>
one approach, a mask (net shown) having the desired pattern of openings is<br>
first formed over the pass vation layer 16 and the openings 18 are then etched<br>
using the mask. The mask material will then typically be removed. Other<br>
techniques for forming the openings 18 in the passivation layer 16 are also<br>
known. After the openings 18 have been formed, the completed passivation<br>
layer 16 will preferably overlap and cover the bond pad edges to provide a<br>
moisture barrier.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 4, an adhesion layer 20 is next deposited on the<br>
wafer 10. The adhesion layer 20 is operative for enhancing the adhesion of<br>
subsequently deposited metal to the passivation material. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, a layer of titanium is sputter deposited on the wafer 10 to form<br>
the adhesion layer 20. Other materials (e.g., chromium, tungsten, tantalum,<br>
tantalum nitride, etc.) or alloys and other deposition processes can<br>
alternatively be used. With reference to Fig. 5, an optional seed layer 22 is<br>
next deposited on the wafer 10 to form an electrical connection to the edge of<br>
the wafer 10. The seed layer 22 also provides a protective barrier for the<br>
adhesion layer 20 and the metal below. In a preferred approach, copper is<br>
sputter deposited on the wafer 10 to form the seed layer 22. In at least one<br><br>
embodiment, a single layer is provided that acts as both the adhesion layer 20<br>
and the seed layer 22.<br>
After the seed layer 22 has been applied, a number of expanded bond<br>
pads 24 are formed on the wa fer 10, as shown in Fig. 6. The bond pad length,<br>
width, and pitch are defined by the lithographic or patterning processes used<br>
to produce the expanded bond pads, and are subject primarily to the<br>
limitations of these processes. The expanded bond pads 24 are preferably<br>
relatively thick structures (e.g., greater than 8 micrometers). They are<br>
therefore more compatible with the build up process than the relatively thin<br>
bond pads 12. Because the expanded bond pads 24 are deposited at the wafer<br>
level, wafer level processing and fab processing capabilities can be used to<br>
form the expanded pads 24. In a preferred approach, an alternative bump<br>
metallurgy (ABM) process is used to form the expanded bond pads 24. The<br>
process by which ABM is deposited on a wafer is analogous to that typically<br>
used in controlled collapse c lip connect (C4) processing. However, ABM is<br>
lead-free and can withstanc higher temperatures, while providing similar<br>
properties as C4 in this application (wafer level process that provides<br>
electrical connection over die bond pads for assembly, typically with a larger<br>
aspect ratio in length, width, and height relative to the original bond pad). In<br>
one embodiment, the ABM process is used to create relatively wide copper<br>
platforms above each of the bond pads 12 on the wafer 10.<br>
The expanded bond pads 24 will preferably be significantly larger in<br>
size in at least one dimension (e.g., length and/or width in a plane defined by<br>
the passivation layer 16) than the bond pad openings 18 in the passivation<br>
layer 16. As will be described in greater detail, this increase in size will<br>
typically improve the alignment budget for the vias associated within the first<br>
build up layer by a significant amount. In the illustrated embodiment, the<br>
expanded bond pads 24 are approximately twice the width (i.e., the dimension<br>
across the page) of the associated bond pad openings 18. Although not<br>
shown, the expanded pads 24 are also approximately twice the length (i.e., the<br>
dimension into the page) of the associated bond pad openings 18. Bond pad<br>
expansion ratios of up to 40 are believed possible in accordance with the<br>
present invention. The expanded bond pads 24 can be the same shape as the<br>
bond pads 12 or a different shape. In one approach, the expanded bond pads<br>
24 are made as large as is reliably possible within the capabilities of the<br>
particular on-wafer deposition process being used. The bond pad openings 18<br>
can also be made smaller to increase the alignment budget between each bond<br><br>
pad 12 and its associated expanded pad 24. One or more expanded bond pads<br>
24 can be formed that cover multiple underlying bond pads 12 as might be<br>
desired for certain circuit designs or due to limitations in the capability of<br>
other processing steps.<br>
After the expanded pads 24 have been formed, the seed layer 22 is<br>
removed from the regions between the expanded pads 24, typically by<br>
etching. In addition, the adhesion layer 20 is removed from the regions<br>
between the expanded pads 21. The deposited pad material acts as a mask to<br>
protect the adhesion material beneath the expanded pads 24. Therefore, the<br>
adhesion material remains at the interfacs between each expanded pad 24 and<br>
the underlying bond pad 12 and passivation layer 16 to enhance adhesion<br>
therebetween. As shown in Fig. 7, the wafer 10 is eventually cut up to form<br>
individual microelectronic circuit dice 26. As is well known, in a typical<br>
manufacturing environment, ship sorting procedures are performed before<br>
wafer dicing to group individual chips based on performance level and/or to<br>
determine whether each chip is functional. One advantage of depositing the<br>
expanded pads 24 during wafer level processing, therefore, is that they<br>
provide additional contact area for the probes that are used to test the<br>
individual die during sorting.<br>
After the wafer has been diced, each individual die 26 is packaged.<br>
Often, a chip manufacturer will deliver the separated dice to a packaging<br>
vendor to perform the packaging. As described above, in a preferred<br>
approach, each individual die 26 is packaged by building up one or more<br>
metal layers on a surface of the die 26. The die 26 is first mounted within an<br>
opening in a package core to form a die/core assembly. Metal layers are then<br>
built up over the die/core assembly to provide, among other things,<br>
conductive communication between the terminals of the die 26 and the leads<br>
or contacts of the package. Fig. 8 is a simplified top view illustrating a<br>
die/core assembly 34 in accc rdance with one embodiment of the present<br>
invention As shown, the die 26 is fixed within an opening 36 in a package<br>
core 30 using an encapsulation material 32 (e.g., plastics, resins, epoxies,<br>
elastomers, and the like). The die 26 is first positioned within the opening 36<br>
and the encapsulation material 32 is then flowed or injected into the gap<br>
between the die 26 and the cor 2 30 and allowed to harden. The package core<br>
30 can be formed from a wide variety of different materials. For example, the<br>
core material can include, bismaleimide triazine (BT), various resin-based<br>
materials, flame retarding glass/epoxy materials (e.g., FR4), polyimide-based<br><br>
materials, ceramic materials, metal materials (e.g., copper), and/or others.<br>
Figs. 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 are a series of diagrams illustrating a<br>
method for packaging a die 16 in accordance with one embodiment of the<br>
present invention. Fig. 9 is a cross sectional side view of the die/core<br>
assembly 34 of Fig. 8. As shown, the die 26 is fixed within the opening 36 in<br>
the package core 30 with the upper surface of the passivation layer 16 of the<br>
die 26 substantially flush with the upper surface of the package core 30 (and<br>
with the upper surface of the enoapsulation material 32). Other<br>
configurations for fixing the die 26 within the core 30 are also possible (e.g.,<br>
the upper surface of the passivation layer 16 can be raised with respect to the<br>
upper surface of the core 30, etc). The opening 36 can extend fully through<br>
the package core 30 (as shown in Fig. 9) or a full or partial floor portion can<br>
be provided within the opening 36.<br>
With reference to Fig. 10, a layer of dielectric material 38 is next<br>
deposited over the die/core assembly 34. The dielectric layer 38 can be<br>
formed from any of a variet) of different materials including, for example,<br>
glass particle filled epoxy resins (e.g., Ajinomoto Buildup Film (ABF)<br>
available from Ajinomoto), bisbenzocyclobutene (BCB) (available from<br>
Dow), polyimide, silicone rubber materials (e.g., DC6812 from<br>
DowCorning), various low-k dielectrics (e.g., SiLK from Dow Chemical),<br>
IPN (available from Ibiden), and others. After the dielectric layer 38 has been<br>
applied, a number of via holes 40 are formed through the dielectric layer 38 in<br>
locations corresponding to the expanded bond pads 24, as illustrated in Fig.<br>
11. Any available method can be used to form the via holes 40 including, for<br>
example, laser techniques, photolithography techniques using wet or dry<br>
etching, use of photoimagable dielectric materials, and others. Because the<br>
expanded bond pads 24 have been made selatively wide, the alignment budget<br>
for the via holes 40 is substantially larger than it would have been if the via<br>
holes 40 were required to align with the smaller bond pad openings 18 in the<br>
passivation layer 16. In fact in many cases the minimum via size may be<br>
larger than the desirgd size of the bond pad opening 18, requiring an unlanded<br>
via that increases the complexity of the via formation and filling process.<br>
When laser ablation is being used to form the via openings, it will typically be<br>
simpler to land the via (i.e., stop drilling) on the expanded bond pad rather<br>
than on the bond pad or on multiple different materials (i.e., the bond pad and<br>
the passivation as would be tHe case in an unlanded via). Significantly, if at<br>
this stage in the build up process a shift is made from package-by-package<br><br>
alignment to gang alignment of multiple packages within a panel, there will<br>
be an added constraint to the alignment budget resulting from die-to-die<br>
misalignment among the packages. The largest possible expansion of the<br>
bond pads will reduce this constraint as much as possible. In addition,<br>
because the expanded bond pads 24 are raised above the passivation layer 16,<br>
the expanded pads 24 make the surface of the die 26 appear much more like<br>
the topography typically encountered during the package build up process<br>
(i.e., more like the topography of the build up layers themselves). The<br>
material of the expanded be nd pads 24 can also be made more compatible<br>
with the material of the bui d up layers. In one embodiment, for example,<br>
both the expanded bond pad; 24 and the metallization of the build up layers<br>
are formed from copper.<br>
After the via holes 40 have been formed, a first build up metallization<br>
layer 42 is deposited over the dielectric ayer 38, as illustrated in Fig. 12. As<br>
shown, the first build up metallization layer 42 includes a number of<br>
conductive elements 44 that are each conductively coupled to an associated<br>
expanded bond pad 24 through a corresponding via hole 40. The first build<br>
up metallization layer 42 (and the other build up layers, if any) may be<br>
formed by any known technique, including but not limited to semi-additive<br>
plating and photo lithographic techniques. An exemplary semi-additive<br>
plating technique can involve depositing a seed layer, such as a sputter-<br>
deposited or electroless-deposited metal, on the dielectric layer 38. A resist<br>
layer is then patterned on the seed layer followed by electrolytic plating of a<br>
layer of metal, such a copper, on the seed layer exposed by open areas in the<br>
patterned resist layer. The patterned resist layer is stripped and portions of<br>
the seed layer not having the layer of metal plated thereon are etched away.<br>
Other methods of forming conductive elements 44 will be apparent to those<br>
skilled in the art. Another dielectric layer 46 and a second build up<br>
metallization layer 48 may hen be deposited, as illustrated in Fig. 13.<br>
Additional build up layers can also be applied. Eventually, a number of<br>
external package contacts or leads are formed to provide an interface to an<br>
external circuit.<br>
As described previously, in at least one embodiment, the principles of<br>
the present invention are used to fabricate a multi-chip module (MCM). Fig.<br>
14 is a simplified cross sectional side view of a multiple chip die/core<br>
assembly 50 that can be used to form an MCM in accordance with one<br>
embodiment of the present irvention. As shown, multiple dice 26, each<br><br>
having expanded pads 24 disposed thereon, are fixed within an opening 36 in<br>
a package core 30. In an alternative embodiment, the dice 26 are each fixed<br>
within a separate opening in the package core 30. More precise chip<br>
alignment may be required to align the dice 26 to one another before the<br>
encapsulation material 32 is added and allowed to harden. After the multiple<br>
chip die/core assembly 50 has been formed, the build up process can proceed<br>
substantially as described abc ve. For example, with reference to Fig. 15, a<br>
first dielectric layer 38 an be deposited and via holes 40 formed<br>
therethrough. A first build up layer 42 can then be applied over the first<br>
dielectric layer 38. Similarly, a second dielectric layer 46 can be deposited<br>
over the first build up layer 42 and via holes 52 can be formed therein. A<br>
second build up layer 48 can be deposited on the second dielectric layer 46.<br>
• Significantly, the build up layers 42, 48 can be used to provide inter-chip<br>
communication between the d ce 26 of the module. For example, as shown in<br>
Fig. 15, one or more traces 54 can be provided on the first build up layer 42 to<br>
provide communication between a bond pad 12 (or multiple bond pads 12)<br>
within one die and a bond pad 12 (or multiple bond pads 12) within another<br>
die.<br>
In addition to the abce, the inventive principles can also be used to<br>
fabricate multiple microelectronic devices on a single panel that is then cut up<br>
into individual packaged devices. The packaged devices can be either single-<br>
chip or multi-chip devices. A number of dice that each have expanded bond<br>
pads thereon are first fixed within corresponding openings in a panel. The<br>
panel forms the package core for each of the devices being fabricated. One or<br>
more build up metallization layers are then formed over the panel. The panel<br>
is then divided into multiple independent microelectronic devices.<br>
Fig. 16 is a flow chart illustrating a process for manufacturing a<br>
microelectronic die in accondance with one embodiment of the present<br>
invention. A semiconductor wafer is first provided that includes.a number of<br>
independent circuits distributed across an upper surface thereof (block 70).<br>
Each circuit has a number of bond pads on an upper surface of the wafer.<br>
Methods for preparing such wafers are well known in the art and, therefore,<br>
will not be described furthe herein. Typically, each of the independent<br>
circuits on the wafer will be identical with the others. Any of a wide range of<br>
different circuit types can be formed (e.g., digital processing devices, logic<br>
circuits, etc.). A passivation layer is next deposited on the upper surface of<br>
the wafer (block 72). Openings are then formed though the passivation layer<br><br>
to expose portions of the bond pads for each of the circuits (block 74).<br>
Expanded bond pads are then formed over some or all of the openings in the<br>
passivation layer which are then conductively coupled to the independent<br>
circuits below the passivat on layer (block 76). An adhesion layer and/or a<br>
seed layer may be applied over the passivation layer as part of the expanded<br>
pad formation to enhance metal adhesion to the passivation material. The<br>
wafer is then cut up into individual circuit dice to await packaging (block 78).<br>
The individual dice may be electrically tested before the wafer is cut.<br>
Fig. 17 is a flow chart illustrating a method for packaging a<br>
microelectronic die in acordance with one embodiment of the present<br>
invention. A microelectron c die is provided that has expanded bond pads<br>
disposed over openings in a )assivation layer thereof (block 80). Each of the<br>
expanded bond pads is conductively coupled to one or more associated bond<br>
pads of the die through corresponding openings in the passivation layer. The<br>
expanded bond pads each have dimensions that are larger than those of the<br>
associated bond pad opening; in the passivation layer. The microelectronic<br>
die with the expanded bond pads is then fixed within an opening in a package<br>
core to form a die/core assembly (block 82). A layer ofdielectric material is<br>
then deposited over the die/core assembly (block 84) and via holes are formed<br>
in the dielectric layer in local ions corresponding to the expanded bond pads<br>
(block 86) and potentially in other locations. A metallization pattern is then<br>
formed on the dielectric layer (block 881 that is conductively coupled to the<br>
expanded bond pads through he corresponding via holes. Further dielectric<br>
layers and metallization patterns can also be applied.<br>
Although Figs. 1-15 ilustrate various views and embodiments of the<br>
present invention, these figures are not meant to portray microelectronic<br>
assemblies in precise detail. For example, these figures are not typically to<br>
scale. Rather, these figures illustrate microelectronic assemblies in a manner<br>
that is believed to more clearly convey rhe concepts of the present invention.<br>
In addition, it should be appreciated that the present invention does not<br>
require a one to one correspondence between expanded pads and bond pads.<br>
For example, expanded pads may be provided for only a subset of the bond<br>
pads of the die or a single bond pad may cover multiple bond pad openings.<br>
Although the present invention has been described in conjunction with certain<br>
embodiments, it is to be understood that modifications and variations may be<br>
resorted to without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as<br>
those skilled in the art readi y understand. For example, it should be<br><br>
understood that various additional acts can be performed (e.g., intermediate<br>
cleaning and/or surface roughening acts) and structures created (e.g.,<br>
additional adhesion layers, etc.) during device fabrication in accordance with<br>
the present invention. Such modifications and variations are considered to be<br>
within the purview and scope of the invention and the appended claims.<br><br>
