				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>Downlink traffic channel data rate options and methods of indicating to a wireless terminal a utilized downlink data rate option are described. The downlink traffic channel rate option for a segment is conveyed using an assignment signal and/or a block in the downlink traffic channel segment which is not used for user data. Downlink segment assignment signals in some implementations allocate fewer bits for rate option indication than are required to uniquely identify each option, hi some implementations low rate options, e.g., using QPSK, are uniquely identified via assignment signals. Higher rate options, e.g., using QAMl 6 modulation, are conveyed via the distinct information block in the downlink traffic segment using a first coding/modulation method. Still higher rate options, e.g., using QAMl 6, QAM64, or QAM256, are conveyed via the information block in the segment using a second coding/modulation method which is applied to the rate option information.</td>

QUALCOMM FLARION TECHNOLOGIES, INC.<br>
an American company of BEDMINSTER ONE, 135 Route 202/206 South, Bedminster, New Jersey 07921, United States of America<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
WO 2007/015830<br><br><br><br>
PCT/US2006/027761<br><br>
METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR IMPLEMENTING AND USING AN IN-BAND RATE INDICATOR<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]     The present invention relates to methods and apparatus for indicating data rate option information while various exemplary embodiments are more particularly directed to indicating and using downlink data rate option information in a wireless communications system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]     In order to efficiently perform downlink traffic channel signaling in a wireless communications system, where a base station communicates with a plurality of wireless terminals, situated at different locations with different channel conditions and different levels of interference at any given time, it is beneficial to support a large number of data rate options for downlink traffic channel segments. Typically, in wireless communications systems supporting multiple downlink traffic channel data rate options which may change on a segment to segment basis, the data rate option for a given segment is uniquely identified in a field of an assignment signal corresponding to the downlink traffic channel segment. However, as the number of supported data rate options increases, the number of bits required to be dedicated in the assignment signal to uniquely indicate the assigned rate option increases, representing an undesirable increase in overhead.<br>
[0003]     In view of the above discussion, it would be beneficial if new methods and apparatus allowed for the supporting of a large number of downlink traffic channel data rate options, yet limiting the amount of overhead used to convey data rate information. Methods and apparatus that are flexible and that facilitate different coding and/or modulation techniques to convey the data rate option of a downlink traffic channel segment would be beneficial.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004]     The present invention relates to methods and apparatus for indicating data rate option information. Various methods and apparatus are directed to methods and apparatus for<br><br>
WO 2007/015830		PCT/US2006/027761<br>
indicating and using downlink data rate option information in a wireless communications system.<br>
[0005]     Some embodiments and features of the invention are directed to base station methods and apparatus. The features and embodiments of the invention include the subject matter of the pending claims.   Other features, embodiments and benefits of the invention are also discussed in the present application.<br>
[0006]    One particular exemplary embodiment is directed to a method of operating a base station which includes transmitting in a first portion of a first communications segment encoded data rate option information; and transmitting in a second portion of said first communications segment encoded user data. In some but not necessarily all embodiments the step of transmitting the encoded data rate option information includes modulating said encoded data rate option information using a first modulation method which is different from a modulation method used to modulate said encoded user data. The method may further include selecting a data rate option, prior to transmitting said first and second portions of said first communications segment, said data rate option corresponding to one of a plurality of different data rate option groupings, each of said different data rate option groupings corresponding to a different data rate option indicator encoding method, a first grouping in said plurality of groupings corresponding to a first data rate option indicator encoding method wherein the selected data rate option is indicated .in an assignment signal separate from the communications segment, a second grouping in said plurality of groupings corresponding to a second data rate option indicator encoding method in which data rate option information is included in the communications segment, said data rate option selected for said first communications segment being in said second grouping.<br>
[0007]     In some but not necessarily all embodiments, the first data rate option indicator method uniquely identifies the data rate option selected to be used to encode the user data in a communications segment. In some such embodiments when the first data rate option indicator uniquely identifies the data rate option selected to be used to encode the user data, the communications segment for which the option was selected intentionally does not include encoded data rate option information. At least in some embodiments this is done because the data rate option information provided outside the first segment is sufficient to allow decoding and recovery of the user data. The base station may determine the encoding method to be used for said encoded data rate option information based on the data rate option to be communicated,<br><br><br>
WO 2007/015830	PCT/US2006/027761<br>
e.g., with one method being used for some data rates and another method being used for different data rate options.<br>
[0008]    Additional steps and/or features may be included in various embodiments of the invention. Apparatus for implementing the methods of the invention are also described below and are within scope of the invention.<br>
[0009] Various exemplary embodiments and features which are used in some but not necessarily all systems implemented in accordance with the invention will now be discussed briefly.<br>
[0010]     Some embodiments indicate downlink data rate option information through the use of an.assignment signal and/or the combination of an assignment signal and information included in the communication segment which is assigned. Methods of indicating rate option information discussed below within a downlink segment, while generally discussed in the context of examples which use downlink assignment signals, can be used alone, e.g., without the use of assignment signals or information in assignment signals. Alternatively, as in the case of most examples, the methods of including rate option information in a downlink segment can be used in combination with the features of the invention which relate to downlink assignment signals.<br>
[0011]     In some but not necessarily all embodiments of the present invention, base stations support a large number of different downlink data rate options, e.g., 10 or more, available for use in a downlink traffic channel segment. The lower rate options correspond to lower data rates than the higher data rate options. At least some of the different data rate options use different coding rates and/or different modulation schemes for coding/modulating user data included in a downlink segment to which the rate option has been applied. In some embodiments, the lower data rate options, e.g., data rate options 0, 1, and 2, use QPSK modulation, while higher data rate options, e.g., data rate options 3-10, use QAM16, QAM64, or QAM256 modulation.<br>
[0012]     In various embodiments, downlink traffic channel segments are assigned by a<br>
base station though die use of assignment signals. Depending on the embodiment, each<br>
assignment signal may correspond to one or multiple segments being assigned. Thus, for each<br><br><br><br>
WO 2007/015830	PC T/US2006/027761<br>
assignment signal there is at least one corresponding downlink channel segment. In some embodiments, the base station can decide, e.g., when making a downlink segment assignment, the data rate option to be used when encoding, modulating and/or mapping user data into the segment being assigned. A variety of different methods of indicating to the wireless terminals or group of wireless terminals the data rate option being used can be supported in accordance with the invention. In some embodiments, the method of indicating the utilized data rate option is determined based on the selected data rate option to be used.<br>
[0013]    In accordance with one feature supported in some embodiments of the present invention, the assignment signal dedicates less bits to represent rate option information than the number of bits that would be required to uniquely identify each of the possible downlink data rate options that are supported by the base station for downlink traffic channel segments. In some such embodiments, for at least some low data rate options, assignment signal rate option information bits encoded into the segment assignment signal uniquely identify the data rate option of the downlink traffic channel segment to which the assignment signal corresponds. For other data rate options, e.g., higher data rate options, the assignment signal rate option information bits included in the assignment signal indicate that that the data rate option of the downlink traffic channel segment will be included in a special information block, e.g., a predetermined set of transmission units included in the downlink segment being assigned. The special information block normally does not include user data but may include, e.g., various control information in addition to the data rate option information. The transmission units in said special information block may be a contiguous set of transmission units, such as tone-symbols, located at the start of the downlink segment or may be distributed in a non-contiguous but known manner within the downlink segment.<br>
[0014]     In some particular embodiments, the special information block of a downlink traffic channel segment including a special information block, can have multiple formats and each format corresponds to a group of codes. For example, a first format may map 5 information bits including 1 rate option indicator bit to 32 coded bits, where the pattern of each of 16 bit pairs of coded bits may be 00 or 11; a second format may map 8 information bits including 3 rate option indicator bits to 32 coded bits, where the pattern of each of 16 bit pairs of coded bits may be 01 or 10. In some such embodiments, the coded bits of the special information block are mapped to QPSK modulation symbols.<br><br><br><br>
WO 2007/015830	PCT/US2006/027761<br>
[0015]    In some embodiments, three groupings of levels of downlink traffic channel user data/information data rate options exist: (i) a first lowest grouping where the special information block is not implemented in the downlink traffic channel segment and where the data rate option is uniquely indicated in the assignment signal, (ii) a second intermediate level grouping where the special information block is used, where a first number of information bits are coded into the special information block, and where the special information block includes one information bit dedicated to uniquely identifying two data rate options, (iii) a third higher level grouping where the special information block is used, where a second number of information bits are coded into the special information block, said second number being larger than said first number, and where the special information block includes three information bits dedicated to uniquely identifying at least six data rate options. In some such embodiments, for the first grouping the downlink traffic channel segment uses QPSK modulation; for the second grouping the downlink traffic channel segment uses QPSK for the special information block portion and QAM 16 for the user data coded block portion; for the third grouping the downlink traffic channel segment uses QPSK modulation for the special information block portion and one of QAM16, QAM64, and QAM256 for the user data coded block portion.<br>
[0016]    In accordance with a feature of various embodiments of the present invention, the base station does not specifically identify the format type of the special information block, but rather the grouping of codes allows a wireless terminal receiving the special information block to distinguish and identify the format type of received special information block. In some implementations, the wireless terminal, after having determined the format type of the special information block, will attempt to recover the information bit or bits of special information block which identify the data rate option used for the downlink traffic channel segment. Using a recovered data rate option value, the wireless terminal can properly interpret the received modulation symbol values corresponding to the coded user data, and attempt to recover the user data information bits which were encoded by the base station prior to transmission.<br>
[0017]     While various embodiments have been discussed in the summary above, it should be appreciated that not necessarily all embodiments include the same features and some of the features described above are not necessary but can be desirable in some embodiments. Numerous additional features, embodiments and benefits of the present invention are discussed in the detailed description which follows.<br><br><br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0033]     Figure 1 is a drawing of an exemplary communications system 100, implemented in accordance with the present invention and using methods of the present invention. System 100 includes apparatus and methods directed to improving downlink communications by supporting a plurality of different downlink data rate option options and communicating a selected downlink data rate for a given downlink traffic channel segment in an efficient manner in accordance with the present invention. Exemplary system 100 may be, e.g., an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) multiple access wireless communication system.<br>
System 100 includes a plurality of cells (cell 1 102, cell M 104). Each cell (cell 1 102, cell M<br><br><br>
WO 2007/015830	PCT/US2006/027761<br>
104) represents a wireless coverage area for a corresponding base station (BS 1 106, BS M 108), respectively. A plurality of wireless terminal (WTs) (WT 1 110, WT N 112, WT 1' 114, WT N' 116) are included in system 100. At least some of the WTs are mobile nodes (MNs); the MNs may move throughout the system 100 and establish wireless links with different BSs, the BS corresponding to the cell in which the WT is currently located. In Figure 1, (WT 1110, WT N 112) are coupled to BS 1 106 via wireless links (118,120), respectively; (WT 1' 114, WT N' 116) are coupled to BS M. 108 via wireless links (122,124), respectively.<br>
[0034]    The BSs (106,108) are coupled to network node 126 via network links (128, 130), respectively. Network node 126 is coupled to other network nodes, e.g., routers, other base stations, AAA server nodes, Home Agent nodes, etc. and/or the Internet via network link 132. Network links 128,130,132 may be, e.g., fiber optic links. Network node 126 and networks links 128,130,132 are part of abackhaul network linking various BSs in different cells together and providing connectivity so that a WT located in one cell can communicate with a peer node in a different cell.<br>
[0035]     System 100 is shown having cells with one sector per cell. The methods and apparatus of the present invention are also applicable in systems having more than one sector per cell, e.g., 2, 3, or more than 3 sectors per cell and in systems having different numbers of sectors per cell in different portions of the system. In addition, the methods and apparatus of the present invention are also applicable to many non-cellular wireless communications systems including at least one base station and one wireless terminal.<br>
[0036]     Figure 2 is a drawing of an exemplary base station 200, implemented in accordance with the present invention and using methods of the present invention. Exemplary BS 200 is sometimes referred to as an access node. BS 200 may be any of the BS (106, 108) of system 100 of Figure 1. Exemplary BS 200 includes a receiver 202, a transmitter 204, a processor 206, I/O interface 208, and memory 210 coupled together via a bus 212 over which the various elements may interchange data and information.<br>
[0037]     Receiver 202 is coupled to receive antenna 203 through which BS 200 may receive uplink signals from a plurality of wireless terminals. Receiver 202 includes a decoder 214 for decoding received encoded uplink signals.<br><br><br><br>
WO 2007/015830	PCT/US2006/027761<br>
[0038]    Transmitter 204 is coupled to transmit antenna 205 over which downlink signals are sent to a plurality of wireless terminals. Transmitter 204 includes an encoder 216 for encoding information prior to transmission. Downlink signals include assignments signals including assignments of downlink traffic channel segments. Said assignment signals include rate option information. Downlink signals also include downlink traffic channel segment signals. Some of the downlink traffic channel segments include a special information block including rate option information corresponding to the data rate used for user data in the downlink traffic channel segment.<br>
[0039]     I/O interface 208 couples the BS 200 to other network nodes, e.g., routers, other base stations, AAA server nodes, Home Agent nodes and/or the Internet. I/O interface 208 provides an interface to a backhaul network providing interconnectivity between nodes in different cells.<br>
[0040]    Memory 210 includes routines 218 and data/information 220. The processor 206, e.g., a CPU, executes the routines 218 and uses the data/information 220 in memory 210 to operate the BS 200 and implement methods of the present invention.<br>
[0041]    Routines 218 include communications routines 222 and base station control routines 224. The communications routines 222 implement various communications protocols used by BS 200.<br>
[0042]     The base station control routines 224 control the operation of BS 200 including receiver 202 operation, transmitter 204 operation, I/O interface 208 operation, and the implementation of methods of the present invention. Base station control routines 224 include a scheduling module 226, a downlink traffic channel segment rate option determination module 228, an assignment signal rate option encoding module 230, a downlink traffic channel segment encoding/modulation module 232, a downlink signaling module 238, and an uplink signaling module 240. The downlink traffic channel segment encoding/modulation module 232 includes a user data encoding/mapping module 238 and a special information block, including rate option info, encoding/mapping module 240. Special information block module 240 includes a first format module 242 and a second format module 244.<br><br><br><br>
WO 2007/015830	PCT/US2006/027761<br>
[0043]     The scheduling module 226, e.g., a scheduler, schedules uplink and downlink channel air link resources, e.g., segments, to wireless terminal users. Scheduler 226 operations include assigning downlink traffic channel segments to specific wireless terminals from a plurality of wireless terminal, in accordance with a scheduling policy. Different downlink traffic channel segments may have different characteristics, e.g., more tones for a shorter duration or fewer tones for a longer duration, and the scheduler may take these differences into consideration when deciding which downlink traffic segment should be assigned to which user. Scheduler 226 may assign a number of downlink traffic channel segments to a wireless terminal at a point in time based upon an estimate of the amount of data to be transmitted to the WT, priority levels, subscriber tier levels, latency consideration, estimates of channel conditions, e.g., using channel condition feedback reports, and/or estimates of interference levels, e.g., using feedback Information from the WTs such as beacon ratio report information. Each tone may be used to communicate a signal during an OFDM symbol transmission time period.<br>
[0044]    Downlink traffic channel segment rate option determination module 228 determines the rate option, e.g., in coordination with the scheduling operations, to be used for a downlink traffic channel segment from among a plurality of data rate options supported by the base stations for the downlink, where each data rate option corresponds to a coding rate and modulation scheme. For example, an exemplary system may support 11 different data rate options in the downlink, each one corresponding to a different number of MAC frames, a different number of information bits to be encoded in the downlink traffic channel segment, and a particular modulation constellation; different modulation constellations, e.g., QPSK, QAM16, QAM64, QAM256, are used to convey the coded bits of the user data for atleast some different rate options. For example, the lowest three data rate options may use QPSK, the next four highest QAM16, the next two highest QAM64, and the next two highest QAM256. In addition to determining the data rate option for the downlink traffic channel segment, module 228 controls flow of control to other modules based on the determined rate. For example, in some embodiments, for low data rate options, e.g., rate options 0,1, and 2 using QPSK, the special information block module is not called, since the special information block is not implemented.<br>
[0045]     Assignment signal rate option encoding module 230 encodes downlink traffic channel rate option information into assignment signals corresponding to downlink traffic channel segments. For some rate options, e.g., rate options 0, 1, or 2 using QPSK, the actual rate option is encoded into the assignment signal, while for some other rate options, e.g., rate<br><br><br>
WO 2007/015830	PCT/US2006/027761<br>
option 3-10, information, e.g., a bit pattern such as 11, is encoded into the assignment signal in the field designated for rate information, which indicates that the actual assigned rate option will be conveyed in a special information block which is part of the downlink traffic channel segment and that the rate option will be within a specified range, e.g., rate option 3-10.<br>
[0046]    Downlink traffic channel segment encoding/modulation module 232 performs encoding and modulation operation for the downlink traffic channel segments. User data encoding and mapping module 238 encodes the user data information bits into coded bits in accordance with the coding rate and code corresponding to the determined downlink traffic channel data rate option for the segment. User data and mapping module 238 also maps the coded bits to modulation symbol values in accordance with the modulation constellation corresponding to Redetermined data rate option for the downlink traffic channel segment. User data encoding/mapping module 238 also associates the modulation symbol values with tone-symbols of the segment. In some embodiments, for low data rate options, e.g., data rate options 0,1, 2, using QPSK, each of the tone-symbols of the segment, e.g., are allocated for modulation symbols values corresponding to the coded user data, while for higher data rate options, most of the tone-symbols of the segment, e.g., 656 out of 672, are allocated for modulation symbol values corresponding to the coded user data and a small number of the tone-symbols, e.g., 16 out of 672, are allocated to modulation symbols corresponding to a special information block.<br>
[0047]     Special information block, including rate option information, encoding/mapping module 240 performs encoding, mapping and modulation operations pertaining to the special information block of the downlink traffic channel segments. Special block module 240 supports two different operational formats and includes a first format module 242 and a second format module. The first format module 242 performs encoding mapping, and modulation operations pertaining to a first group of data rate options, e.g., rate options 3-4, while the second format module 244 performs encoding, mapping, and modulation operations pertaining to a second group of data rate options, e.g., data rate options 5-10, the data rates of the second group being higher than the data rates of the first group. For example, first format module 242 may encode a set of 5 information bits including one data rate bit into a set of 32 information bits; Reed-Muller based codes may be used, and the resulting set of coded bits may be 16 two bits pairs with each bit pair haying the value 00 or 11. The value of the one data rate bit may be used to specify whether rate option 3 or 4 is used for the user data portion of the downlink traffic channel segment. Continuing with the example, second format module 244 may encode a set of 8<br><br><br>

information bits including three data rate bit into a set of 32 information bits; Reed-Muller based codes may also be used, and the resulting set of coded bits may be 16 two bits pairs with each bit pair having the value 01 or 10. The value of the three data rate bits may be used to specify whether rate option 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 is used for the user data portion of the downlink traffic channel segment, e.g., with two possibilities being reserved, e.g., for future enhancements and/or the addition of additional rates. Module 242 or 244, maps the generated coded bits to modulation symbol values for a QPSK modulation constellation, e.g., the set of 32 coded bits to 16 modulation symbol values for the segment. Module 242 or 244 also associates the modulation symbol values with tone-symbol of the special information block of the downlink traffic channel segment.<br>
[0048]    In accordance with one feature of the some embodiments of the present invention, the coding rate of the first format module 242, e.g., 3 information bits-32 coded bits, is lower than the coding rate of the second format module 244, e.g., 5 info bits - 32 coded bits, and the data rate of the user information associated with use of first format module 242, e.g., data rate options 3 or 4 corresponding to 848 - 1056 info bits, is lower than the data rate of the user information associated with use of second format module 244, e.g., data rate options 5-10 corresponding to 1264 - 3760 information bits. In accordance with another feature of some embodiments of the present invention, the first format module 242 produces a set of modulation symbol values which are distinct from the set of modulation symbol values produced by the second format module. For example, first format module 242, when executed, may generate a set of 16 QPSK modulation symbol values using a first two of the four possible QPSK modulation symbol values in the set of four, the first two values representing two diagonally opposed quadrants in the complex plane. Similarly, the second format module 244, when executed, may generate a set of 16 QPSK modulation symbol values using a second two, the remaining two, of the four possible QPSK modulation symbol values for the QPSK constellation.<br>

[0080]     Downlink traffic channel assignment signaling information 396 includes information identifying fields and the significance of different possible values within the fields within assignments signals, e.g., information pertaining to a downlink traffic channel segment rate option sub-field in an assignment signal. For example, a 2 bit rate option sub-field in an assignment signal, corresponding to a downlink traffic channel segment, may convey three possible low level rate options, e.g., rate options 0, 1, 2 as indicated by bit pattern (00, 01, or 10) or may convey that one of a higher level rate options is used and that the actual assigned rate will be conveyed in a special information block as part of the downlink traffic channel segment, e.g., bit pattern (11) may convey that one of rate options (3-10) is used and that the actual rate is included in a special information block of the downlink traffic channel segment.<br>
[0081]    Downlink traffic channel rate option/decoding/demodulation information 394 includes information identifying the various downlink traffic channel data rate options supported by the base station, the number of MAC frames corresponding to each data rate option, the number of information bits corresponding to each data rate option, the codeword length and code used corresponding to each data rate option, the modulation constellation used corresponding to each data rate option, demodulation methods and decoding methods. Such information 394 is used in the demodulating and decoding operations performed.<br>
[0082]     Special information block information 397 includes 1st format data/information 398 and 2nd format data/information 399. First format data/information 398 includes information identifying which downlink traffic channel data rate options are associated with the first format for the special information block, the information bit fields of a 1st format special information block, the bit'size of each field, the interpretation given to the bit values in each field, the decoding method to use, e.g., including information bit recovery matrix, modulation symbols to coded bit mapping information, the demodulation scheme to use, etc. For example, the first format, may be associated with two downlink traffic channel rate options 3 and 4; a first format special information block may convey 5 information bit including a single bit rate option indicator which indicates either rate option 3 or 4, and a 4 bit transmission power indicator value, the coding may be based upon Reed-Muller codes and may result in 32 coded bits mapped to 16 QPSK modulation symbol values. Second format data/information 279 includes information identifying which downlink traffic channel data rate options are associated with the second format for the special information block, the information bit fields of a 2nd format special information block, the bit size of each field, the interpretation given to the bit values in<br><br><br>

each field, the decoding method to use, e.g., including information bit recovery matrix, modulation symbol to coded bit mapping information, the demodulation scheme to used, etc. For example, the second format, may be associated with six downlink traffic channel rate options 5-10 with 2 reserved designations; a second format special information block may convey 8 information bits including a three bit rate option indicator which indicates which rate option from the range of rate options 5-10 has been assigned, and a 5 bit transmission power indicator value, the coding may be based upon Reed-Muller codes and may result in 32 coded bits mapped to 16 QPSK modulation symbol values. First and second format data/information 398, 399 may each be associated with a different group of codes, e.g., such that possible QPSK modulation symbols values corresponding to a 1st format special information block are different, e.g., different quadrants in the complex plane, than modulation symbol values corresponding to a 2nd format special information block.<br>
[0083]    Base station identification information 395 includes information used to distinguish between different base station cells, sectors and/or frequencies used in the communications system. For example, different values of pilot tone signal slopes may be used in different adjacent cells in the system.<br>

Fifth column 410 lists the modulation constellation used (QPSK, QPSK, QPSK, QAM16, QAM16, QAM16, QAM16, QAM64, QAM64, QAM256, QAM256) which corresponds to each of the rate options (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), respectively. It should be noted that the codeword length for rate options using QPSK corresponds to 672 OFDM tone-symbols, while for rate options using QAM16, QAM64, or QAM256 modulation constellations, the codeword length corresponds to 656 OFDM tone-symbols.<br><br><br><br>

Each downlink traffic channel segment 600, 650 occupies air link resources of 672 OFDM tone-symbols, each OFDM tone-symbol represented by a small square box. Each tone-symbol can be used to convey a modulation symbol value. Exemplary segment 600 is representative of a downlink traffic channel segment using QPSK, e.g., rate options 0,1, 2.

By including portions of the special information block in different OFDM transmission time<br>
intervals within the downlink traffic channel segment, e.g., the first and last OFDM symbol<br>
transmission time intervals, the special information block may be made less susceptible to<br>
fading conditions, and the likelihood that the information conveyed by the special information<br>

[0094]    Figure 12 includes an exemplary special information block 1202 including 16 exemplary modulation symbols (SO, SI, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, S9, S10, Sll, SI 2, SI 3, SI 4, SI5). Table 1204 identifies that group A codes are used for a first type format to convey 5 information bits including 1 rate option indicator bit. Graph 1208, a graph of the complex plane, indicates that group A codes use QPSK modulation symbol values that may be in two designated quadrants, diagonally situated, of the four quadrants, as indicated by modulation symbol value 1210 and modulation symbol value 1214. Table 1206 identifies that group B codes are used for a second type format to convey 8 information bits including 3 rate option indicator bits. Graph 1216, a graph of the complex plane, indicates that group B codes use QPSK modulation symbol values that may be in two designated quadrants, diagonally situated, of the four quadrants, as indicated by modulation symbol value 1218 and modulation symbol value 1220. It should be noted that the two quadrants used for group A codes are different from the two quadrants used for type B codes.<br>
[0095]     In accordance with one feature of the present invention, a WT receiving a<br>
downlink traffic channel segment that is known, e.g., via the assignment signal, to include a<br>
special information block, can capture energy of the 16 modulation symbols of the special<br>
information segment, and identify which of the two possible diagonal lines the energy is being<br><br><br><br>
WO 2007/015830	PCT/US2006/027761<br>
accumulated along. This will identify the format used, then the coded bits of the special information block can be decoded and the original information bits including the rate option indicator bit or bits can be recovered.<br>
[0096]     In accordance with another feature of some embodiments of the present invention, the mobile node's decoding ability can be matched to the number of bits. If the mobile node, is unable to successfully decode the small code, associated with the special information block, the mobile node is unlikely to be able to decode the coded user information bits using QAM 16, QAM64, or QAM256 of the downlink traffic channel segment. In addition, in some embodiments, the special information block, when being encoded to convey a first number of information bits is matched with a first set of data rate options, while when being encoded to convey a second number of information bits is matched with a second set of data rate options, the first set of data rate options being lower than the second set of data rate options and the first number of information bits being lower than the second number of information bits. For example, consider an exemplary embodiment that uses 11 downlink traffic channel data rate options (6-10), with the lowest data rate option being data rate option 0, representing 1 frame of user data being communicated in the downlink traffic channel segment, and the highest data rate option 10, representing 18 frames of user data being communicated in the downlink traffic channel segment. In one such embodiment for the lowest set of data rate options (0-2) a special information block is not used, and a QPSK modulation constellation is used for the coded user data bits; for an intermediate level of data rate options (3-4) a special information block is used with 5 information bits including 1 data rate option bit, and a QAM 16 modulation constellation is used for coded user data bits; for a high level of data rate options (5-10) a special information block is used with 8 information bits including 3 information bits for conveying data rate options, and one of a QAM 16, QAM64, or QAM256 modulation constellation is used for coded user data bits, with the one of QAM16, QAM64 or QAM256 being a function of data rate option.<br>

Figure 14 and Figure 15, in combination, illustrate processing and mapping for an exemplary second format which obtains 32 coded bits from 8 information bits, including 3 rate indicator option bit, and maps the coded bits to 16 modulation symbols of the special information block. Information bit vector 1402 is multiplied by generation matrix (Gs,^) 1404 to generate a coded bit vector 1406, where each element of the vectors and matrix is either a 0 or 1. Information bit vector (b7b6bsb4l) 1408 can be information bit vector 1402, where each bit b7_... ,b4 is one of the 8 information bits, and three of the information bits, e.g., b7, be, bs, can be the rate option indicator bits. Generation matrix 1410, using Reed-Muller codes, can be generation matrix, 1404, and coded output bit vector (X15, Xi4,...,Xo) 1412 can be coded bit vector 1406. Block 1414 shows exemplary mapping of coded bit pairs from vector 1412 to 8 modulation symbols. Block 1416 illustrates that the modulation symbol So is designated the most significant modulation symbol and that each of the eight modulation symbol represents either the coded bit pair (1,0) or (0,1). Information bit vector 1502 is multiplied by generation matrix (Gs,^) 1504 to generate a coded bit vector 1506, where each element of the vectors and matrix is either a 0 or 1. Information bit vector (b3b2bibol) 1408 can be information bit vector 1402, where each bit b7&gt;... ,b4 is one of the 8 information bits. Generation matrix 1510, using Reed-Muller codes, can be generation matrix 1504, and coded output bit vector (Y15, Yi4,...,Y0) 1512 can be coded bit vector 1506. Block 1514 shows exemplary mapping of coded bit pairs from vector 1512 to 8 modulation symbols. Block 1516 illustrates that the modulation symbol SJ5 is designated the least significant<br><br><br>

modulation symbol and that each of the eight modulation symbol represents either the coded bit pair (1,0) or (0,1).<br>
[0099]     In some embodiments, the 3 coded rate option bits may be included in information bit vector 1508 rather than in information bit vector 1408; while in other embodiments, the three rate option indicator bits may be partitioned between information bit vector 1408 and 1508 with some rate option indicator bits included in each vector 1408,1508.<br>
[00100]     Consider that coded bit pattern (0,0) is mapped to represent as a QPSK modulation symbol in a first quadrant, e.g., with a value (1+i) in the complex plane, coded bit pattern (1,1) is mapped to represent a QPSK modulation symbol in a second, diagonally opposed, quadrant, e.g., with a value (-1-i) in the complex plane, coded bit pattern (1,0) is mapped to represent a QPSK modulation symbol in a third quadrant, e.g., with a value of (1, -i), and coded bit pattern (0,1) is mapped to represent a QPSK modulation symbol in a fourth, diagonally opposed to the third quadrant, quadrant, e.g., with a value (-1, i) in the complex plane. If the special information block in the first type format, each of the sixteen modulation symbol values will be in a first set of two, while if the special information block is of the second type format, each of the sixteen modulation symbols will be in a second set of two, said second set being mutually exclusive from said first set. A wireless terminal receiving the special information block modulation signals, can first determine which of the two sets the signals correspond to, can determine the corresponding format type used, and can decode the signals using the determined format type recovering the rate option being conveyed.<br>

step 1704. In step 1704, the base station determines a wireless terminal to be assigned for the<br>
downlink traffic channel segment and the rate option, e.g., a data rate option corresponding to<br>
coding rate information and modulation scheme, to use for the segment. In some embodiments,<br>
the base station may assign a downlink traffic channel segment to more than one user, e.g., as<br>
part of a multi-cast assignment or a broadcast. In some embodiments, where there is no user<br>
information to be transmitted for a particular downlink traffic channel segment, e.g., due to low<br>
system loading levels, the base station may leave the segment unassigned or transmit a dummy<br>
assignment signifying that the segment is unassigned, and subsequently not transmit for that<br><br><br><br>
WO 2007/015830	PCT/US2006/027761<br>
downlink traffic channel segment. The determination of which wireless terminal receives the assignment for the downlink traffic channel segment and the rate option of the segment may be determined in accordance with the policy rules of the base station's scheduler and may include using interference level information, e.g., derived, in part, from feedback reports such as beacon ratio reports received from the wireless terminals. Operation proceeds from step 1704 to step 1706.<br>
[00102]    In step 1706, the base station determines whether the determined rate option for the downlink traffic channel segment corresponds to QPSK modulation or to a different modulation scheme, e.g., one of QAM16, QAM64, QAM256. For example, the downlink traffic channel may support eleven different rate options, each rate option being associated with a coding rate and a modulation scheme, and rate options 0,1, and 2, the lowest three data rate options of the eleven, may use QPSK modulation. If the determination of step 1706, is that the determined rate option corresponds to QPSK modulation, then operation proceeds to step 1708; otherwise, operation proceeds to step 1710.<br>
[00103]    In step 1708, the base station encodes the rate option for the downlink traffic channel segment in the assignment signal corresponding to the downlink traffic channel segment, e.g., indicating rate option 0, 1, or 2. In some embodiments, there is fixed predetermined association linking assignment signals with downlink traffic channel segments with the downlink timing structure. Then, in step 1712 the base stations sends the assignment signal to the wireless terminal via downlink signaling. Operation proceeds from step 1712 to step 1714. In step 1714, the base station encodes user data for the downlink traffic channel segment using the coding rate corresponding to the determined rate option. Operation proceeds from step 1714 to step 1716. In step 1716, the base station maps coded bits from the operation of step 1714, into modulation symbol values using QPSK. Operation proceeds from step 1716 to step 1718. In step 1718, the base station is operated to associate modulation symbol values with tone-symbols of the traffic channel segment. Then, in step 1720, the base station is operated to transmit downlink traffic channel segment signals.<br>
[00104]     Returning to step 1706, if in step 1706 the determined rate option did not correspond to QPSK modulation, then operation proceeds from step 1706 to step 1710. For example, the downlink traffic may support eleven different rate options for the downlink traffic channel segment and the 8 highest data rate options, rate options 3-10, may correspond to non-<br><br>
WO 2007/015830	PCT/US2006/027761<br>
QPSK modulation. In step 1710, the base station is operated to encode information in the assignment signal, corresponding to the downlink traffic channel segment, indicating that the specific rate option value for the downlink traffic channel segment will be conveyed in a special information block of the downlink traffic channel segment. For example, the assignment signal can have a field including two bits associated with rate option information, and when the value of those two bits is a particular pattern, e.g., 11, that pattern signifies that the rate option value for the downlink traffic channel segment will be conveyed in a special information block of the segment, and that the rate option value will be within a range, e.g., 3-10. Operation proceeds from step 1710 to step 1722, where the base station is operated to send the assignment signal to the wireless terminal. Operation proceeds from step 1722 to step 1724.<br>
[00105]    In step 1724, the base station is operated to determine if the determined rate option corresponds to a first or second format. For example, exemplary rate options 3-10 may be partitioned to correspond to two different formats, used for the special information block. A first format may correspond to lower data rates, e.g., rate options 3-4 and a second format may correspond to higher data rate, e.g., rate options 5-10. If it is determined in step 1724 that the determined rate option corresponds to the first special block format, then operation proceeds to steps 1726 and 1728; while if it is determined in step 1724, that the determined rate option corresponds to the second special block format, then operation proceeds to steps 1730 and 1732.<br>
[00106]     In step 1726, the base station is operated to encode the user data for the downlink traffic channel segment using the coding rate corresponding to the determined rate option, e.g., one of rate options 3 or 4. Operation proceeds from 1726 to step 1734, where the base station is operated to map the coded bits from step 1726 into modulation symbol values in accordance with the determined rate option, e.g., using QAM16.<br>
[00107]     In step 1728, the base station is operated to code 5 information bits including one bit for rate option information into 32 coded bits using a first coding method, e.g., producing 16 coded bit pairs, with each coded bit pair being one of (00) or (11). In some embodiments, Reed-Muller codes are used in step 1728.<br>
[00108]     In step 1732, the base station is operated to encode the user data for the downlink traffic channel segment using the coding rate corresponding to the determined rate option, e.g.,<br>
one of rate options 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Operation proceeds from 1732 to step 1742, where the base<br><br><br><br>
WO 2007/015830	PCT/US2006/027761<br>
station is operated to map the coded bits from step 1732 into modulation symbol values in accordance with the determined rate option, e.g., using QAM16 corresponding to rate options 5-6, QAM64 corresponding to rate options 7-8, or QAM256 corresponding to rate options 9-10.<br>
[00109]     In step 1730, the base station is operated to code 8 information bits including three bits for rate option information into 32 coded bits using a second coding method, e.g., producing 16 coded bit pairs, with each coded bit pair being one of (10) or (01). In some embodiments, Reed-Muller codes are used in step 1730.<br>
[00110]     Operation proceeds from step 1728 or step 1730 to step 1738, where the base station is operated to map the 32 coded bits into modulation symbols using QPSK. Operation proceeds from step 1738 to step 1740, where the base station is operated to associate modulation symbol values with tone-symbols of the downlink traffic channel segment reserved for special block information.<br>
[00111] Operation proceeds from step 1734 or step 1742 to step 1736, where the base station is operated to associate modulation symbol values from steps 1734 or step 1742 with tone-symbols of the traffic channel segment reserved for the user data portion.<br>
[00112]     Operation proceeds from step 1740 and step 1736 to step 1720, where the base station is operated to transmit downlink traffic channel segment signals.<br>
[00113]     Downlink traffic channel segment assignment signals used in some but not necessarily all embodiments of the present invention have a fixed predetermined relationship in terms of transmission time and/or frequency to the traffic channel segment being assigned by the assignment signal. A downlink assignment signal in various embodiments of the invention may include a wireless terminal identifier that corresponds to an individual wireless terminal, a group of active wireless terminals, or a null group of wireless terminals where the null group is a wireless terminal group in which, in some embodiments, no active wireless terminals are assigned and which is used for segments which are not intended to carry data for an active terminal, e.g., segments which go unused. Thus, in the case of a multicast transmission, a WT group identifier may be included in the assignment signal and the members of the group would listen and use the assigned downlink traffic segment.<br><br><br><br>
WO 2007/015830	PCT/US2006/027761<br>
[00114]    Figure 18 is a drawing of a flowchart 1800 of an exemplary method of operating a wireless terminal in accordance with the present invention. The exemplary method starts in step 1802, where the wireless terminal is powered on and initialized. Operation proceeds from step 1802 to step 1804, where the wireless terminal receives a downlink traffic segment assignment signal. Operation proceeds from step 1804 to step 1806. In step 1806, the wireless terminal decodes received assignment signal information indicating the assigned wireless terminal or terminals corresponding to the assigned downlink traffic channel segment. The downlink traffic channel segment assignment may be a unicast assignment corresponding to a single WT or the downlink traffic channel segment assignment may be a multicast assignment corresponding to a group of WTs. Operation proceeds from step 1806 to step 1808.<br>
[00115]     In step 1808, the WT determines whether or not the received downlink traffic channel assignment is directed toward the WT. If in step 1808, the WT determines that the assignment is not directed toward itself, operation proceeds from step 1808 back to step 1804 where the WT receives additional downlink traffic channel segment assignment signals. However, if in step 1808, the WT determines that the assignment was directed to itself, then operation proceeds from step 1808 to step 1810 and step 1812.<br>
[00116]    In step 1810, the WT further decodes received assignment signal information indicating rate option information to obtain a data rate option indicator value or an indication that the data rate option indicator value is included in the corresponding downlink traffic channel segment. For example, the WT may support 11 downlink data rate options as shown in Figure 4, the assignment signal may include a rate option field of 2 bits where pattern 00 indicates data rate option 0, pattern 01 indicates data rate option 1, pattern 10 indicates data rate option 2, and pattern 11 indicates that the rate option will be indicated in the corresponding downlink traffic channel segment in a special information block portion and that the rate option will be one of rate options 3-10.<br>
[00117] In step 1812, the WT receives the traffic channel segment signals corresponding to the assigned segment obtaining received traffic channel segment signals 1814. The received traffic channel signals 1814 are used as input to steps 1820 and/or 1828.<br>
[00118]     Operation proceeds from step 1810 to step 1816. In step 1816, the WT determines if the decoded rate option information indicates a specific data rate option that is<br><br><br>
WO 2007/015830	PCT/US2006/027761<br>
being used in the downlink traffic channel segment. If the decoded, rate option infonnation does include a specific indicated data rate option, then operation proceeds to step 1818; otherwise operation proceeds to step 1820.<br>
[00119]     In step 1818, the WT determines from the indicated data rate option, one or more of a modulation method, coding rate and modulation symbol mapping for the downlink traffic channel segment. For example, data rate 0 may correspond to a QPSK modulation constellation, 224 information bits, 1344 coded bits, and each of the OFDM tone-symbols of the downlink traffic channel segment corresponding to mapped coded bits of user data; if data rate 1 may correspond to a QPSK modulation constellation, 432 infonnation bits, 1344 coded bits, and each of the OFDM tone-symbols of the downlink traffic channel segment corresponding to mapped coded bits of user data; data rate 2 may correspond to a QPSK modulation constellation, 640 information bits,1344 coded bits, and each of the OFDM tone-symbols of the downlink traffic channel segment corresponding to mapped coded bits of user data. For example, the downlink traffic channel segment may include 768 OFDM tone-symbols and each of the 768 OFDM tone-symbols may be used to convey QPSK modulation symbols of mapped coded user data bits for each of data rate options 0, 1, or 2. Operation proceeds from step 1818 to step 1828.<br>
[00120]     In step 1820, the wireless terminal decodes the special information block portion of the received traffic channel segment signals 1814 to obtain the data rate option used for the user data portion of the downlink traffic channel segment. For example in an exemplary system, the downlink traffic channel segment may include 768 OFDM tone-symbols, and when using data rate options 3-10, the downlink traffic channel segment is partitioned into a special information block of 16 tone-symbols and a user data block of 752 tone-symbols. Step 1820 includes sub-step 1822 and sub-step 1824. In sub-step 1822, the wireless terminal determines whether the recovered modulation symbols of the special information block belong to a first or a second set of codes. For example, the special information block may use QPSK modulation symbols and the first set of codes may use QPSK modulation symbols (0,0) and (1,1), while the second set of codes may use QPS modulation symbols (1,0) or (0,1). In sub-step 1824 the wireless terminal decodes the coded bits conveyed in the special information block according to a first format for the first set of codes or according to a second format for the second set of codes. For example, the first set of codes may correspond to a first format where 5 information bits including 1 rate option indicator bits are conveyed, e.g., indicating rate option 3 or data rate option 4 of Figure 4; while the second set of codes may correspond to a second format where 8<br><br><br>
WO 2007/015830	PCT/US2006/027761<br>
information bits including 3 rate indicator bits are conveyed, e.g., indicating one of rate option 5-10 of Figure 4. The WT having determined the set of codes in sub-step 1822, decodes according to the appropriate format in step 1824, recovering the data rate option indicator value. Operation proceeds from step 1820 to step 1826.<br>
[00121]    In step 1826, the WT determines, from the determined indicated data rate option, one or more of a modulation method, coding rate, and modulation symbol mapping for the downlink traffic channel segment. For example, consider that step 1824 determines one of data rate options 3-10 indicated in Figure 4, with its associated coding rate, modulation constellation, e.g., QAM16, QAM64 or QAM256, and mapping of coded user data bits to 752 tone-symbols of the downlink traffic channel segment. Operation proceeds from step 1826 to step 1828.<br>
[00122]    In step 1828, the WT recovers, e.g., via demodulation and decoding, the user data information bits communicated in the downlink traffic channel segment using the determined modulation symbol mapping information, modulation method information, and coding rate information obtained from either step 1818 or step 1826. Step 1828 includes the processing of received traffic channel signals 1814, e.g., those associated with user data. •<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
"METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR IMPLEMENTING AND USING AN IN-BAND RATE INDICATOR"<br>
Downlink traffic channel data rate options and methods of indicating to a wireless terminal a utilized downlink data rate option are described. The downlink traffic channel rate option for a segment is conveyed using an assignment signal and/or a block in the downlink traffic channel segment which is not used for user data. Downlink segment assignment signals in some implementations allocate fewer bits for rate option indication than are required to uniquely identify each option, hi some implementations low rate options, e.g., using QPSK, are uniquely identified via assignment signals. Higher rate options, e.g., using QAM1 6 modulation, are conveyed via the distinct information block in the downlink traffic segment using a first coding/modulation method. Still higher rate options, e.g., using QAM1 6, QAM64, or QAM256, are conveyed via the information block in the segment using a second coding/modulation method which is applied to the rate option information.<br></td>
