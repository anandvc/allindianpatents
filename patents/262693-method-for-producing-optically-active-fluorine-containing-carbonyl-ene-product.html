SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]    It is an object of the present invention to provide a lowcost<br>
production process of an optically active, fluorine-containing, carbonyl-ene<br>
product, which is an important intermediate of medicines and agricultural<br><br>
chemicals.    In the methods of Non-patent Publications 1-4, it has been<br>
necessary to use high-price asymmetric catalysts by about 5mol% in order to<br>
achieve high catalytic activity [satisfactory asymmetric induction and yield<br>
(conversion)].    How the amount of a high-price asymmetric catalyst used<br>
can be reduced is the key to produce an optically active, fluorine-containing,<br>
carbonyl-ene product with low cost.    It has been necessary to find out a<br>
reaction condition that can maintain high catalytic activity even if the<br>
amount of asymmetric catalyst used is reduced.    In Non-patent Publications<br>
1-4, studies for finding out such reaction condition have almost not been<br>
conducted.    Therefore, it has not been possible to produce an optically active,<br>
fluorine-containing, carbonyl-ene product with low cost.<br>
[0004]    As a result of an eager study to solve the above-mentioned task, the<br>
present inventors have found out that activity of asymmetric catalyst is<br>
greatly influenced by the type and the usage of the reaction solvent to be<br>
used.    With this, we have reached the present invention.    The invention of<br>
the present application includes the following three modes.<br>
[0005]    [Mode l: a mode of reacting in the absence of reaction solvent]<br>
The inventors have found out useful findings that, when a<br>
fluorine-containing orketoester represented by formula [l] is reacted with an<br>
alkene represented by formula [2] to synthesize an optically active,<br>
fluorine-containing, carbonyl-ene product represented by formula [3], it is<br>
possible to conduct the reaction with high optical purity and good yield in the<br>
presence of a transition metal complex having an optically active ligand and<br>
in the absence of reaction solvent (e.g., Examples 2 and 7-20).   We have also<br>
found out that, even if the amount of a high-price asymmetric catalyst used<br>
is greatly reduced, the optically active, fluorine-containing, carbonyl-ene<br>
product can be obtained with high optical purity and good yield (e.g.,<br>
Examples 10 and 14-15).<br>
[0006]    [Mode 2- a mode of reacting in a solvent that is low in relative<br>
dielectric constant]<br><br>
The inventors have found out that the optically active,<br>
fluorine-containing, carbonyl-ene product can be obtained with high optical<br>
purity and good yield, under a condition that the amount of a high-price<br>
asymmetric catalyst used has greatly been reduced, by using a reaction<br>
solvent that is relatively weak in coordination ability to metal complex and<br>
that is 5.0 or less in relative dielectric constant sr, particularly a hydrocarbon<br>
series reaction solvent, too (e.g., a comparison between Examples 1, 3, and<br>
21-28 and Comparative Examples 1-13).   Although toluene is cited as an<br>
unfavorable reaction solvent in Non-patent Publication 4, it has been found<br>
out to be a particularly preferable reaction solvent in a reaction between<br>
ethyl trifluoropyruvate and isobutene, which is a preferable example of the<br>
present invention.<br>
[0007]    [Mode 3^ a mode of reacting in a halogenated hydrocarbon-series<br>
solvent]<br>
The inventors have found out that the reaction can preferably be<br>
conducted, even if it is a halogenated hydrocarbon-series reaction solvent,<br>
which is relatively strong in coordination ability, by limiting its usage and by<br>
conducting the reaction under a high concentration condition (e.g., a<br>
comparison between Examples 4-6 and Comparative Examples 1-3 and 9).<br>
We have also found out that, even if the amount of a high-price asymmetric<br>
catalyst used is greatly reduced, the optically active, fluorine-containing,<br>
carbonyl-ene product can be obtained with high optical purity and good yield.<br>
[0008]    That is, the present invention includes the following first to eighth<br>
methods and provides a method for producing an optically active,<br>
fluorine-containing, carbonyl-ene product with low cost that is suitable for<br>
large-scale production.    The following first to third methods, the fourth to<br>
seventh methods, and the eighth method respectively correspond to the<br>
above-mentioned Mode 1, Mode 2, and Mode 3.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0017]    In the production method of the present invention, it is possible to<br>
not only solve the problem (high production cost due to the use of a<br>
high-price asymmetric catalyst in large amount) of Non-patent Publications<br>
1-4, but also reduce the usage of methylene chloride, which is limited in<br>
industrial use as a reaction solvent, (a reaction solvent frequently used in<br>
Non-patent Publications 1-4).   Alternatively, the reaction can also be<br>
conducted without using it at all.    Even under such condition, it is possible<br>
to produce the target product with high yield and high asymmetric yield, and<br>
there occurs no production of impurities that are difficult of separation.<br>
Particularly in the case of using no reaction solvent, it is possible to<br>
remarkably improve productivity of the reaction and operability of the<br>
post-treatment.<br>
[0018]    A method of the present invention for producing an optically active,<br>
fluorine-containing, carbonyl-ene product is explained in detail.    Firstly,<br>
matters common to Mode 1 to Mode 3 are explained.<br>
[0019]    As perfluoroalkyl group of fluorine-containing crketoester<br>
represented by formula [l], it is possible to cite one having a carbon atom<br>
number of 1-6.    One having a carbon atom number of 3 or greater can take a<br>
straight-chain or branch.    As alkyl group of fluorine-containing crketoester<br>
represented by formula [l], it is possible to cite one having a carbon atom<br>
number of 1-6.    One having a carbon atom number of 3 or greater can take a<br>
straight-chain or branch.<br>
[0020]    Of the fluorine-containing crketoester, one is preferable, in which Rf<br>
is a trifluoromethyl group, and R is a methyl group or ethyl group, and which<br><br>
can easily be produced and can industrially be used.    It is preferable for<br>
producing the optically active, fluorine-containing, carbonyl-ene product.<br>
[0021]   As alkyl groups of alkene represented by formula [2], it is possible to<br>
cite those having a carbon atom number of 1-6.    Those having a carbon atom<br>
number of 3 or greater can take a straight-chain or branch.   Two alkyl<br>
groups can also form by a covalent bond a cyclopentane ring, cyclohexane<br>
ring, cycloheptane ring, cyclopentene ring, cyclohexene ring, cycloheptene<br>
ring, or the like.<br>
[0022]   As substituted alkyl group of alkene represented by formula [2], a<br>
hydroxyl-group's protector or the like can substitute in the alkyl group.    As<br>
the protecting group of the hydroxyl group, it is possible to suitably use those<br>
mentioned in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third Edition, 1999,<br>
John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.    Of those, benzyl group and t-butyldiphenylsilyl<br>
group are preferable.<br>
[0023]    As aromatic ring group of alkene represented by formula [2], it is<br>
possible to cite aromatic hydrocarbon groups, such as phenyl group, and the<br>
like.<br>
[0024]    As substituted aromatic ring group of alkene represented by formula<br>
[2], a halogen atom, such as fluorine atom or chlorine atom, a lower alkyl<br>
group, such as methyl group, or the like can substitute in the aromatic ring<br>
group.   The aromatic ring group and the alkyl group can also form a<br>
covalent bond.<br>
[0025]    Of the alkene, 1,1-disubstituted olefin, which is high in reactivity, is<br>
preferable.    Isobutene is preferable, in view of importance of the obtained<br>
product as a medicine intermediate.    We have made it clear that the<br>
production method of the present invention is a single-step, very excellent<br>
method, in view of that a method for industrially producing optically active,<br>
trifluorocarbonyl-ene product represented by formula [6], particularly<br>
(R)-trifluorocarbonyl-ene product represented by formula [7], has been<br>
limited in conventional techniques to a two-step method of synthesizing the<br>
corresponding racemate and conducting optical resolution.<br><br>
[0026]   The usage of alkene represented by formula [2] is not particularly<br>
limited.    Normally, the use of 0.7moles or greater is enough, the use of<br>
0.8-10moles is preferable, and particularly the use of 0.9-7moles is more<br>
preferable, relative to lmole of fluorine-containing crketoester represented<br>
by formula [l].<br>
[0027]   As the transition metal complex having an optically active ligand, it<br>
is possible to cite a bivalent cationic complex represented by formula [8]<br>
[Chemical Formula 25]<br><br>
[in the formula, X—*—X represents the following optically active SEGPHOS<br>
derivative (chemical formula 26), optically active BINAP derivative<br>
(chemical formula 27), optically active BIPHEP derivative (chemical formula<br>
28), optically active P-Phos derivative (chemical formula 29), optically active<br>
PhanePhos derivative (chemical formula 30), optically active<br>
l,4-Et2-cyclo-C6H8-NUPHOS (chemical formula 31) or optically active BOX<br>
derivative (chemical formula 32), or the like, Y represents Ni, Pd, Pt or Cu,<br>
and Z represents SbF6, C1O4, BF4, OTf (Tfi CF3SO2), AsF6, PF6, or<br>
B(3,5-(CF3)2C6H3)4]<br>
[Chemical Formula 26]<br><br><br><br><br><br>
[in the formula, R represents a hydrogen atom, chlorine atom, bromine atom,<br>
iodine atom or trifluoromethyl group, and Me represents a methyl group] or<br>
the like.    Of these, the bivalent cationic complex is preferable, and<br>
particularly the bivalent cationic palladium complex is more preferable (As<br>
the optically active ligand, representative ones are cited, and it is possible to<br>
suitably use those mentioned in CATALYTIC ASYMMETRIC SYNTHESIS,<br>
Second Edition, 2000, Wiley-VCH, Inc.    As Z, SbF6, BF4, OTf, and<br><br>
B(3,5-(CF3)2C6H3)4 are preferable.    Particularly, SbF6, OTf, and<br>
B(3,5-(CF3)2CeH3)4 are more preferable).<br>
[0028]    These complexes can be prepared by publicly known methods (for<br>
example, Non-patent Publications 1-4, J. Am. Chem. Soc. (US), 1999, Vol.<br>
121, p. 686-699, nature (UK), 1997, Vol. 385, p. 613-615, etc.), and, besides<br>
an isolated complex (e.g., Reference Examples 1-21 isolated), the use without<br>
isolation following a previous preparation in the reaction system is also<br>
possible (e.g., Methods C to D-2 and F of Examples,' in situ).    As these<br>
complexes, it is also possible to use ones to which water or an organic solvent<br>
such as acetonitrile is coordinated (solvation) [since the usage of asymmetric<br>
catalyst is extremely small, the solvent coordinated to the complex can be<br>
neglected, and it is not treated (not converted) as reaction solvent].    As in<br>
situ complex, a bivalent cationic complex having a fluorine-containing<br>
crketoester as a ligand is preferable, which is represented by formula [10]<br>
[0029] [Chemical Formula 34]<br><br>
[in the formula, X-*-X, Y and Z represent the same ones as those of formula<br>
[8], Rf and R represent the same ones as those of formula [l]], which can<br>
easily be prepared by novel Method D, D"2 or F with no necessity of using<br><br>
reaction solvent at all, and which is extremely high in activity of asymmetric<br>
catalyst.<br>
[0030]    Furthermore, it is possible in some cases to use a cationic binuclear<br>
complex, too, which is represented by formula [11]<br>
[Chemical Formula 35]<br><br>
[in the formula, X-*—X, Y and Z represent the same ones as those of formula<br>
[8]], similar to the bivalent cationic complex represented by formula [8].<br>
[0031]    It is possible to suitably use stereochemistry [(R), (S), (R,R), (S,S),<br>
etc.] of the optically active ligand in accordance with stereochemistry of the<br>
target optically active, fluorine-containing, carbonyl-ene product.    In view of<br>
importance of the obtained product as a medicine intermediate,<br>
stereochemistry of the optically active ligand that gives a<br>
(R)-fluorine-containing carbonyl-ene product is preferable.    It suffices to<br>
suitably set optical purity of the optically active ligand in accordance with<br>
the target optical purity of the optically active, fluorine-containing<br>
carbonyl-ene product.    Normally, it suffices to use 95%ee (enantiomeric<br>
excess) or greater, the use of 97%ee or greater is preferable, and particularly<br>
the use of 99%ee or greater is more preferable.<br>
[0032]    Of these optically active ligands, BINAP derivatives are preferable,<br>
since both enantiomers can be obtained with the lowest price, and since<br>
activity upon converted into an asymmetric catalyst is also extremely high.<br>
BINAP and Tol-BINAP are preferable, and particularly BINAP is more<br>
preferable.<br>
[0033]    As the usage of the transition metal complex having an optically<br>
active ligand, it suffices to use 0.001 moles or less, the use of 0.0005 moles or<br><br>
less is preferable, and particularly the use of 0.0003 moles or less is more<br>
preferable, relative to 1 mole of fluorine-containing orketoester represented<br>
by formula [l], to gain the maximum of the effect of the present invention (to<br>
have a production with a cost as low as possible).    Of course, it is also<br>
possible to conduct it with a usage of more than 0.001 moles in no<br>
consideration of the production cost.    In Mode 2 in the present invention,<br>
however, 0.001 moles or less of the asymmetric catalyst (transition metal<br>
complex) is used relative to 1 mole of fluorine-containing crketoester<br>
represented by formula [1].<br>
[0034]    The reaction temperature is not particularly limited.    Normally, it<br>
suffices to conduct it in a range of-60 to +60°C.    It is preferable to conduct<br>
it in a range of-50 to +50°C.    Particularly, it is more preferable to conduct it<br>
in a range of-40 to +40°C.    Furthermore, in the reaction between ethyl<br>
trifluoropyruvate and isobutene, which is a preferable example of the<br>
present invention, sometimes the reaction proceeds, even if asymmetric<br>
catalyst does not exist, and there exists a reaction pathway to give a<br>
racemate (lowering optical purity of the target optically active<br>
trifluorocarbonyl-ene product), and sometimes isobutene remaining in the<br>
reaction-terminated liquid generates side reactions (lowering chemical<br>
purity of the target optically active trifluorocarbonyl-ene product).<br>
Therefore, in the present reaction, normally it suffices to conduct it in a<br>
range of-60 to +30°C.    It is preferable to conduct it in a range of-50 to<br>
+20°C.   Particularly, it is more preferable to conduct it in a range of-40 to<br>
+10°C.<br>
[0035]    The order of adding the raw material substrates, asymmetric<br>
catalyst, and the reaction solvent is not limited to [Method A] to [Method F]<br>
mentioned in Examples.    In the case of adding alkene at last that is one of<br>
the raw material substrates, it is possible to obtain an optically active<br>
fluorine-containing carbonyl-ene product with high optical purity by<br>
gradually adding it while controlling it to the above reaction temperature or<br>
lower.<br><br>
[0036]    The reaction time is not particularly limited.    Normally, it suffices<br>
to conduct it within 24 hours.    It depends on the raw material substrates,<br>
asymmetric catalyst, the reaction conditions, etc.    Therefore, it is preferable<br>
to monitor the condition of the reaction progress by analytical means such as<br>
gas chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, liquid chromatography, or<br>
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and judge the time when the raw<br>
material substrates have almost disappeared as being the end point.<br>
[0037]    Next, an explanation is conducted on each matter of Mode 1 to Mode<br>
3 of the present invention.<br>
[0038]    Firstly, Mode 1 is explained.    Mode 1 of the present invention is a<br>
method of conducting the target reaction in the absence of reaction solvent.<br>
[0039]    Herein, to conduct the reaction in the absence of reaction solvent<br>
means that the reaction solvent does substantially not exist in the reaction<br>
system (neat condition).    Specifically, it refers to a condition of the reaction<br>
solvent being less than 0.10L, relative to lmol of fluorine-containing<br>
crketoester represented by formula [l].    A condition of less than 0.05L is<br>
preferable, and particularly a condition of less than 0.01L is more preferable.<br>
More typically, it suffices to conduct the reaction without adding liquid<br>
compound from the outside of the system on one's own initiative, besides the<br>
reaction substrates and the transition metal complex.    It is the most<br>
preferable mode of Mode 1.<br>
[0040]    Due to that the reaction solvent does substantially not exist in the<br>
reaction system, not only productivity of the reaction improves remarkably,<br>
but also waste liquid derived from the reaction solvent is not discharged in<br>
the post-treatment.    Therefore, it is extremely advantageous from the<br>
viewpoint of reducing burden on the environment, too.    Thus, it is one of<br>
important findings of the present invention that the target reaction proceeds<br>
with high yield and high optical purity even in the absence of reaction<br>
solvent.<br>
[0041]    Furthermore, the inventors have found out that the reaction<br>
proceeds well by the existence of an asymmetric catalyst in an extremely<br><br>
small amount under such no solvent condition.    By these findings, it has<br>
become possible to conduct the target reaction of the present invention<br>
economically remarkably advantageously as compared with the past.<br>
i()()42]    In Mode 1, a method for producing optically active,<br>
trifluorocarbonyl'ene product represented by formula [6] by reacting ethyl<br>
trifluoropyruvate represented by formula [4] with isobutene represented by<br>
formula [5] in the presence of 0.0005 moles or less of a bivalent cationic<br>
transition metal complex having an optically active ligand relative to lmole<br>
of ethyl trifluoropyruvate represented by formula [4] and in the absence of<br>
reaction solvent is particularly preferable in terms of usefulness of the<br>
product, the raw material availability, that the reaction can preferably be<br>
conducted, etc.<br>
[0043]    In Mode 1, a method for producing (R)-trifluorocarbonyl'ene product<br>
represented by formula [7] by reacting ethyl trifluoropyruvate represented<br>
by formula [4] with isobutene represented by formula [5] in the presence of<br>
0.0003 moles or less of a bivalent cationic palladium complex having an<br>
optically active ligand relative to lmole of ethyl trifluoropyruvate<br>
represented by formula [4] and in the absence of reaction solvent is still more<br>
preferable due to that the reaction can be conducted still more economically<br>
advantageously, etc.<br>
[0044]    Next, Mode 2 is explained.    Mode 2 of the present invention is one<br>
in which the target reaction is conducted in the presence of a reaction solvent<br>
that is 5.0 or less in relative dielectric constant er.<br>
[0045]    Herein, as a reaction solvent that is 5.0 or less in relative dielectric<br>
constant Si•, it is possible to cite aliphatic hydrocarbon series such as<br>
npentane, n-hexane, cyclohexane, and n-heptane; aromatic hydrocarbon<br>
series such as benzene, toluene, xylene, and mesitylene; ethers such as<br>
diethyl ether, t.-butyl methyl ether, and 1,4-dioxane (however,<br>
tetrahydrofuran is excluded); etc [in the present invention, it refers to the<br>
value of relative dielectric constant s,- of the reaction solvent at around 20°C<br>
(20-25°C)].    Of these, hydrocarbon series is preferable, particularly aromatic<br><br>
hydrocarbon series is more preferable, and furthermore toluene is extremely<br>
preferable. These reaction solvents that are 5.0 or less in relative dielectric<br>
constant sr can be used alone or in combination.<br>
[0046]   The usage of the reaction solvent that is 5.0 or less in relative<br>
dielectric constant sr is not particularly limited.    Normally, it suffices to use<br>
3.0L or less, the use of 2.0L or less is preferable, and particularly the use of<br>
1.0L or less is more preferable, relative to 1 mole of fluorine-containing<br>
a-ketoester represented by formula [l].<br>
[0047]    To conduct the reaction in the presence of a reaction solvent<br>
(reaction solvent that is 5.0 or less in relative dielectric constant sr) refers to<br>
a condition in which 0.10L or greater is used relative to 1 mole of<br>
fluorine-containing crketoester represented by formula [l].<br>
[0048]    In Mode 2, it is also possible to use a mixed solvent prepared by<br>
combining a reaction solvent that is greater than 5.0 in relative dielectric<br>
constant sr and a reaction solvent that is 5.0 or less in relative dielectric<br>
constant sr-    In this case, substantially the same effect can be expected as<br>
that of the reacting in the presence of a reaction solvent that is 5.0 or less in<br>
relative dielectric constant sr, due to that coordination ability to metal<br>
complex, which is originally owned by a reaction solvent that is greater than<br>
5.0 in relative dielectric constant sr, is weakened.    For example, in case that<br>
a hydrocarbon-series reaction solvent is used in the same volume or more as<br>
that of a halogenated hydrocarbon-series reaction solvent, it is possible to<br>
obtain the target product with high optical purity and good yield by a small<br>
amount of asymmetric catalyst, even if the usage of the halogenated<br>
hydrocarbon-series reaction solvent is in 1.0L or more relative to 1 mole of<br>
fluorine-containing a-ketoester represented by formula [l].   Therefore, in<br>
the case of mentioning a reaction solvent that is 5.0 or less in relative<br>
dielectric constant sr in the present invention, there is also included a mixed<br>
solvent of a reaction solvent that is 5.0 or less in relative dielectric constant<br>
sr and a reaction solvent that is greater than 5.0 in relative dielectric<br><br>
constant sr, the mixed solvent being such that the former has been used in<br>
the same volume or more as that of the latter.<br>
[0049]    In Mode 2, a method for producing optically active<br>
fluorine-containing carbonyl-ene product represented by formula [3] by<br>
reacting fluorine-containing crketoester represented by formula [l] with<br>
alkene represented by formula [2] in the presence of 0.001 moles or less of a<br>
transition metal complex having an optically active ligand relative to 1 mole<br>
of fluorine-containing a-ketoester represented by formula [l] and in the<br>
presence of a hydrocarbon-series reaction solvent is preferable, since<br>
reactivity is good.<br>
[0050]    In Mode 2, a method for producing optically active<br>
trifluorocarbonyl-ene product represented by formula [6] by reacting ethyl<br>
trifluoropyruvate represented by formula [4] with isobutene represented by<br>
formula [5] in the presence of 0.0005 moles or less of a bivalent cationic<br>
transition metal complex having an optically active ligand relative to 1 mole<br>
of ethyl trifluoropyruvate represented by formula [4] and in the presence of<br>
an aromatic hydrocarbon-series reaction solvent is particularly preferable,<br>
due to usefulness of the product, the raw material availability, that<br>
reactivity is good, etc.<br>
[0051]    In Mode 2, a method for producing (R)-trifluorocarbonyl-ene product<br>
represented by formula [7] by reacting ethyl trifluoropyruvate represented<br>
by formula [4] with isobutene represented by formula [5] in the presence of<br>
0.0003 moles or less of a bivalent cationic palladium complex having an<br>
optically active ligand relative to 1 mole of ethyl trifluoropyruvate<br>
represented by formula [4] and in the presence of toluene as reaction solvent<br>
is still more preferable, due to usefulness of the product, the raw material<br>
availability, that reactivity is still better, etc.<br>
[0052]    Next, Mode 3 is explained.    Mode 3 is one in which the reaction is<br>
conducted in the presence of less than 1.0L of a halogenated<br>
hydrocarbon-series reaction solvent relative to 1 mole of fluorine-containing<br>
orketoester represented by formula [l].<br><br>
[0053]    Herein, as a halogenated hydrocarbon-series reaction solvent, it is<br>
possible to cite methylene chloride, chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane, etc.    Of<br>
these, methylene chloride and 1,2-dichloroethane are preferable, and<br>
particularly methylene chloride is more preferable.    These halogenated<br>
hydrocarbon-series reaction solvents can be used alone or in combination.<br>
of course, they can also be used in combination with a reaction solvent that<br>
is 5.0 or less in relative dielectric constant sr.<br>
[0054]    As the usage of a halogenated hydrocarbon-series reaction solvent,<br>
less than 1.0L is used, the use of less than 0.7L is preferable, and<br>
particularly the use of less than 0.5L is more preferable, relative to 1 mole of<br>
fluorine-containing orketoester represented by formula [l].<br>
[0055]    In the present invention, the reacting in the presence of a<br>
halogenated hydrocarbon-series reaction solvent refers to a condition in<br>
which the halogenated hydrocarbon-series reaction solvent is used in 0.10L<br>
or more relative to 1 mole of fluorine-containing a-ketoester represented by<br>
formula [l].<br>
[0056]    Next, the post-treatment step common to Mode 1 to Mode 3 is<br>
explained.<br>
[0057]    As the post-treatment, there is no particular limitation.    It is<br>
possible to obtain the target optically active fluorine-containing carbonyl-ene<br>
product represented by formula [3] by conducting normal operations on the<br>
reaction-terminated liquid.   According to need, the crude product can be<br>
purified to high purity by an operation such as activated carbon treatment,<br>
distillation, recrystallization, or column chromatography.    In a reaction<br>
between ethyl trifluoropyruvate and isobutene, which is a preferable<br>
example of the present invention, it is extremely important to control side<br>
reactions by removing under low temperature isobutene remaining in the<br>
reaction-terminated liquid to the outside of the system.    Therefore, in the<br>
present post-treatment, normally conducting in a range of -60 to +30°C is<br>
enough, conducting in a range of-50 to +20°C is preferable, and particularly<br>
conducting in a range of-40 to +10°C is more preferable.   As the removal to<br><br>
the outside of the system, there is no particular limitation.    There is<br>
preferable a method of removing it to the outside of the system by blowing<br>
inert gas such as nitrogen, argon or the like and accompanying it or a<br>
method of directly removing it from the reaction-terminated liquid under<br>
reduced pressure.    Furthermore, in the present post-treatment, after<br>
isobutene is removed from the reaction-terminated liquid by the above<br>
method to a make condition where no side reaction occurs, it is possible to<br>
continuously recover (reaction solvent can also be recovered in the case of<br>
using reaction solvent) the target product by fractional distillation (according<br>
to need, it can be conducted under reduced pressure).    Therefore, it is<br>
possible to remarkably improve operability of the post-treatment (an<br>
example of preferable post-treatments).    Furthermore, as a method of<br>
controlling side reactions of isobutene remaining in the reaction-terminated<br>
liquid, there is also effective a method of adding to the reaction-terminated<br>
liquid a reaction solvent that is greater than 5.0 in relative dielectric<br>
constant sr, such as dimethylsulfoxide, N,N- dime thy lformamide, acetonitrile,<br>
propionitrile, acetone, methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate or<br>
the like, a phosphine ligand such as triphenylphosphine,<br>
l,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane or the like, etc.<br>
[0058]    In the present invention, recovery and reuse of asymmetric catalyst<br>
are possible, and method of recovery and reuse is not particularly limited.<br>
There is preferable a method where, in the above-mentioned preferable<br>
examples of the post-treatment, asymmetric catalyst is recovered as a<br>
distillation residue, and then it is reused by adding again ethyl<br>
trifluoropyruvate and isobutene, or a method where asymmetric catalyst<br>
[according to need, which has been allowed to stand under cooling or to<br>
which a poor solvent (e.g., aliphatic hydrocarbon-series solvent or the like)<br>
has been added] precipitated from the reaction-terminated liquid is<br>
recovered by decantation, filtration or the like, and then it is reused similar<br>
to the above.    Particularly, the latter is more preferable, since it can be<br>
applied to the recovery of an asymmetric catalyst that is thermally unstable.<br><br>
In the case of the former, an asymmetric catalyst that is thermally unstable<br>
can also be recovered, under a condition that a relatively high activity is<br>
maintained, by conducting a distillation under reduced pressure by<br>
controlling the bath temperature at 70°C or lower (preferably 60°C or lower,<br>
and more preferably 50°C or lower).<br>
