				<td>PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION COMPRISING AN<br>
ANALGESIC PEPTIDE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to analgesic peptides and their derivatives.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Although pain is a crucially important physiological response, it also results<br>
in unnecessary suffering and agony. The control and relief of pain is an important<br>
branch of medicine. Pain may come about bom as a result of disease as well as a<br>
result of medical treatment such as chemotherapy. In either case, it is important to<br>
alleviate the pain as much as possible so as to enable the sufferer to function<br>
normally.<br>
Two neural pathways relating to pain act concurrently in the body: (1) a<br>
sensory pathway which senses tissue damage and subsequently produces a feeling<br>
of pain; (2) an analgesic pathway which reduces the feeling of pain and prevents<br>
the flow of information about the pain to the central nervous system (CNS), thus<br>
allowing the organism to maintain it's normal activity in spite of an injury.<br>
Anesthesia can be realized either by use of a drug which inhibits peripheral nerves<br>
that act as pain sensors or by enhancement of the natural analgesic system. Since<br>
these are different pathways, they are affected by different substances. For<br>
example, aspirin and lidocaine are active on the peripheral sensory pathway, while<br>
morphine and related substances are active on the analgesic system.<br>
The most efficient analgesics currently in use are morphine-related<br>
substances of opiatic origin. It's well known that the brain makes a variety of<br>
endogenic opiates, and this explains the powerful effect of these substances. Their<br><br>
action on neurons is medisted by specialized receptors. Signals regulated by these<br>
receptors prevent the flow of information from the peripheral pain neurons to the<br>
CNS. These CNS neurone are also sensitive to a variety of other chemical<br>
substances including catecholamtines (serotonin, noradrenalin etc,), neuroactive<br>
peptides (neurotensin) and inhibitory amino acids (glycin and GABA).<br>
U.S. 4,619,916 to Di Stazio discloses 13 new tripeptides of the formula<br>
pGLU-X-TRP, where pGLU is cyclized glutamic acid (pyroglutamic acid) and X<br>
may be GLY, VAL, GLU, ASP, SER, ALA, ASN, GLN, ILE, LEU, PRO, LYS and<br>
ARG. Also disclosed are a process for their preparation, pharmaceutical<br>
formulations containing them for oral or parenteral administration and their use as<br>
hypotensive and analgesic agents. Further disclosed are lower alkyi esters of the<br>
tryptophan residue, in particular methyl or ethyl esters, for use as protecting groups<br>
in the production of the peptides. The protecting groups are removed at the<br>
completion of the synthesis process. There is no disclosure of a topical<br>
WO 92/19254 discloses ?-substituted mono, di, tri, tetra and pentapeptides<br>
useful in treating obesity, anxiety, gastrointestinal ulcers, pain, stroke and<br>
inflammation. Peptides of the formula pGLU-X-TRP are not disclosed.<br>
The following tetrapeptides of the formula pGLU-X-TRP-Z appear in the<br>
literature:<br>
X=L-Ala; Z= L-LeuOH, L-LeuOCH3, L-LeuNH2, L-MetOH, L-MetOCH3,<br>
or L-MetNH2 (DE 3,340,208);<br>
X=Lys; Z=L-AlaOH or L-ProOH (Freer, R.J. and Stewart, J.M. (1971)<br>
Cienc. Cult 23(4):539-42; Francis, B. and Kaiser, I.I. (1993) Toxicon<br>
31(7):889-899);<br>
X=L-Pro; Z= L-ValNH2, L-MetOH, L-MetOCH3, L-MetNH2<br>

SUMMARY Of THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an analgesic<br>
pharmaceutical composition which may be administered topically.<br>
It is a further object of the motion to provide novel peptide derivatives.<br>
In a first aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical<br>
composition for topical administration comprising an analgesic effective amount of<br>
a peptide comprising L-amino acids of the formula(I):<br>
pGLU-X-Y-Z (I)<br>
Perhapes X is an amino acid selected from the group consisting of GLY,<br>
"YAI, GLU, ASP, SER, ALA, ASN, GLN, ILE, LEU, PRO, LYS and ARG,<br>
Y is TBP or THR,<br>
and Z is any L-amino acid, or Z is null,<br>
and wherein when Z is any L-amino acid, one but not both of Y and Z is<br>
TRP, and when Z is null, Y= TOP,<br>
or an analgesic effective amount of a peptide derivative in which an alkyi<br>
group is attached to an ammo acid of the peptide, and a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipient.<br>
It has now been discovered mat certain peptides may be used as an active<br>
ingredient in topical analgesic compositions.<br>
The active ingredient of the composition of the invention is a peptide of the<br>
formula (I). Examples of peptides according to the invention are tripeptides and<br>
tetrapeptides in which pGLU is the NH2 terminal ammo acid and TRP is at the third<br>
(Y) or fourth (Z) amino acid position. Examples of preferred peptides are<br>
pGLU-ASN-TOP-OH (pENW), pGLU-GLU-TRP-OH (pEEW),<br>
pGLU-ASN-TKP-THR-OH (pENWT), pGLU-ASN-THR-TRP-OH (pENTW), and<br>
pGLU-ASN-TOP-LYS-OH (pENWK).<br>
A peptide derivative according to the invention is one in which an alkyl<br>
chain has been attached to the peptide. This can be done by attaching a fatty acid to<br>
an amine group, for example to the ?-amine group of a lysine or arginine residue,<br>
thus obtaining an alkyl amide of the peptide, or to an hydroxyl group, thus<br><br>
obtaining an alkyl ester of the peptide. The alkyl chain may be attached to any of<br>
the amino adds of the peptide capable of reacting with the alkyl chain, as is well<br>
known to the skilled man of the art. The alkyl chain may be of any length, but is<br>
preferably of medium to long chain length, e.g. (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14<br>
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 or 30 carbons. Examples of<br>
peptide derivatives are pGLU-ASN-TRP-LYS(octaaoyl)-OH (pENWK-C8) and<br>
pGlu-Aan-Trp-O-octyl (pENW-C8).<br>
An "analgesic effective amount" is an amount of active ingredient capable<br>
of bringing about the desined pharmacological effect, i.e. the redaction or<br>
prevention or proud. This amount depends on a number of paramenters such as the<br>
exact composition of the active ingredient and carrier, the location of<br>
administration, the source of the pain, etc. The amount can be easily determined by<br>
the average skilled man of the art by carrying out a limited amount of dose response<br>
experiments, e.g. by applying a range of concentrations of a given formulation to a<br>
specified location on the body. Examples of concentrations that have been found to<br>
be effective include, but are not limited to, 0.0015-0.02 mg/g carrier.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the invention is formulated for topical<br>
administration. Such a composition would also comprise one or more<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients such as a mixture of Lanolin and<br>
Vaseline for topical use in an ointment, cream or salve. Other carriers for topical<br>
use are well known to the skilled man of the art and are included in the scope of the<br>
invention. Fragrance-emitting, stabilizers, colorants, thickening agents and other<br>
conventional substances may be included in the composition.<br>
The invention also provides a use of an analgesic effective amount of a<br>
peptide comprising L-amino acids of the formula (I):<br>
pGLU-X-Y-Z (I)<br>
wherein X is an ammo acid selected from the group consisting of GLY,<br>
VAL, GLU, ASP, SER, ALA, ASN, GLN, ILE, LEU, PRO, LYS and ARG,<br>
Y is TRP or THR,<br>
and Z is any L-amino add, or Z is null,<br><br>
and wherein when Z is any L-amino acid, one but not both of Y and Z is<br>
TRP, and when Z is null, Y=TRP,<br>
or of an analgesic effective amount of a peptide derivative in which an<br>
alkyl group is attached to an amino acid of the peptide, in the preparation of a<br>
topical pharmaceutical composition for the treatment or prevention of pain.<br>
A further aspect of the invention is a method of treating or preventing pain<br>
in a mammal comprising topically asministrating to the mammal an analgesic<br>
effective amount of a peptide comprising L-amino acids of the formula (I):<br>
pGLU-X-Y-Z (I)<br>
wheren X is an aminp acid salesmen open the group consisting of GLY,<br>
VAI, GLU, ASEER, ALA, ASN, GLN, ILE, LEU, PRO, LYS, and ARG<br>

TRP, and when Z is null, Y= TRP,<br>
or an analgesic effective amount of a peptide derivative in which an alkyl<br>
group is attached to an amino add of the peptide.<br>
The topical administration of the peptide may be in a conventional manner<br>
for topical compositions.<br>

TRP, and when Z is null, Y=TRP,<br>
or a derivative of the peptide in which an alkyl group is attached to an<br>
ammo acid, wherein the length of the alkyl is C4 or longer<br>
with the proviso that when Z is any L-amino acid, if X-ALA, Z is not LEU<br>
or MET, if X=LYS, Z is not ALA or PRO, and if X=PRO, Z is not VAL or MET,<br>
and with the further proviso that when Z is null, the peptide has the alkyl<br>
group attached to an amino acid thereof.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS<br>
METHODS AND MATERIALS<br>
Preparation of peptide and derivatives<br>
1. Synthesis of pGlu-Asn-Trp-Lys(OctanoyI)-OH<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the synthesis of the peptide was carried<br>
out manually by a stepwise 9-fluorenyhnethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) solid phase<br>
peptide synthesis (SPPS) procedure on Fmoc-Lys(Mtt)-Wang resin (loading of 0.25<br>
mmole on 1 g of preloaded resin).<br>
At the first step the Mtt (4-methyitrityl) protecting group was selectively<br>
removed by treatment with 1% TFA in DCM. Octanoic acid was attached to the<br>
free amino group (via an amide bond) by regular coupling procedure applying<br>
2-(1H-Benzotriazole-1 -yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexaflucrcphosphate<br>
(HBTU) reagent in the presence of N-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt). The same<br>
coupling method was applied for the attachment of other amino acids as well.<br>
Completion of the coupling step was detected by the Kaiser test (a few resin beads<br><br>
from the reaction are washed with ethanol and transferred into a small glass tube; 2<br>
drops of the following solutions are added: ninhydrin 5% in ethanol, phenol 80% in<br>
ethanol, potassium cyanide 0.00002M in pyridine; the sample is mixed and heated<br>
to 120°C for 4-6 minutes. A positive test is indicated by blue resin beads). The<br>
Fmoc group was then removed by 20% piperidine, and after washing of the resin<br>
the second ammo acid (Fmoc-Trp(Boc)) was introduced to restart another coupling<br>
step.<br>
These steps were repeated each time with an additional amino acid<br>
according to the peptide sequence. The amino acids used were Fmoc-N? protected.<br>
Trifunctional amino acids were side-chain protected as follows: Trp(Boc),<br>
Asn(Ert). Each Fmoc amino was activated in situ using HBTU/HOBt and<br>
subsequently coupled to the resin for 50 minutes. Diisopropylemylamine (DIEA)<br>
was used during coupling as an organic base. The Fmoc protecting group on the<br>
?-amine was then removed with 20% piperidine in N-memylpyrrolidone (NMP)<br>
for 20 min. Three equivalents of the activated amino acids were employed in the<br>
coupling reactions. The deprotection and coupling steps were repeated with the<br>
addition of each subsequent amino acid until the peptide synthesis was completed.<br>
The peptide-resin was washed with NMP, followed by DCM, and dried under<br>
vacuum.<br>
This peptide, prepared as described above, was cleaved from the resin using<br>
a 95% TEA, 5% triisopropylsilane (TIS) solution for 2 hours at room temperature.<br>
The product was precipitated by the addition of 10 volumes of ether, filtered and<br>
dried in vacuum. Typically, 150 mg of the peptide was obtained from 1 g of<br>
peptide-resin. It was identified by LC/MS (M+1 = 684.7).<br>
Purification<br>
The crude peptide was purified on a preparative RP-HPLC column<br>
(C18 5 µm Phenomenex Luna column, 10 mm I.D. x 25 cm). The chromatography<br>
was done under the following conditions: A=H2O/TFA 0.05%; B=ACN/TFA<br>
0.05%; ?=214 nm; flow = 5 ml/min. 50 mg peptide were loaded on the column. A<br>
gradient of 15% to 50% B at 45 min was used. Fractions of the main peak were<br><br>
collected and characterized by analytical HPLC. Best fractions were combined<br>
together and lyophilized to obtain the required product, which was &gt; 95% pure.<br>
2. Preparation of pGln-Asn-Trp-O-octyl<br>
Preparation of this peptide may also be carried out via a solution synthesis<br>
protocol containing following steps:<br>
a. Prepantioa of Boo-Trp-O-octyl (octyl ester of Boc-Trp)<br>
Boc-Trp (6.1 mmole), octanol (6.8 mmole), DMAP (0.74 g, 6.1 mmole), and<br>
dicyclohexylarbodiimide (DCC) (1.4 g, (6.8 mmole) are introduced to DCM (40<br>
ml) at 0°C. The mixture is stirred and the cooling bath is removed so that the<br>
temperature slowly rises to room temperature. The reaction is stirred overnight and<br>
then is filtered to remove the dicyclohexylurea (DCU). The solid is washed with<br>
DCM and the combined mother liqueur is adjusted to pH = 4-5 HCl (0.1 N). The<br>
organic phase is washed by water (3x30 ml), dried over MgSO4, filtered and<br>
evaporated to obtain crude product.<br>
b. Removal of Boc group<br>
Boc-Trp-O-octyl is dissolved in ether at room temperature. HCl (4N) in<br>
dioxane is introduced (4:1 molar excess) and the reaction mixture is stirred for ca 1<br>
h. Unprotected product precipitates as the HCl salt It is filtered, washed with ether<br>
and dried.<br>
c DCC/HOBt coupling procedure<br>
Boc protected ammo acid (142 mmole) in DCM (35 ml) is cooled to 0°C.<br>
HOBteH2O (12.9 mmole, 1.75 g) and DCC (15.5 mmote, 3.2g) are added to a<br>
reaction mixture and vigorously stirred for 1 h. Deprotected peptide (after removal<br>
of the Boc group) dissolved in DCM (20 ml) and TEA (18.1 mmole) is introduced<br>
and the mixture is stirred for an additional 30 min. at 0°C. The cooling bath is<br>
removed and the reaction is left overnight at room temperature.<br>
Products mixture is evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure and<br>
EtOAc (150 ml) is added. Insoluble particles (DCU) are removed by filtration and<br>
mother liquor is washed with brine (2x35 ml), NaHCO3 (5%; 2x35 ml), and water<br><br>
2x35 ml). The organic phase is dried over MgSO4, and evaporated under reduced<br>
pressure.<br>
At the end of the peptide synthesis (the last stage being the coupling of<br>
pGlu) a peptide is obtained as a crude product It is identified by LC/MS and<br>
purified similarly to the first peptide (pGlu-Asu-Trp-Lys(octanoyl)-OH).<br>
3. Purification from snake venom<br>
Some of the peptides of the invention may also be isolated from snake<br>
venom, including venom obtained from snakes of the Viperidae, Elapidae and<br>
Crotalidae families. For example, pENW may be purified from Naja melanoleuca<br>
venom on a Mono Q column using 20mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.0. The fraction<br>
which elutes from the Mono Q column at 12-18 minutes (with a peak at 143<br>
minutes) is further purified on HPLC as follows. The fraction is loaded onto an<br>
HPLC Spherisorb 5 column, 5µ, 250 x 4.6mm, phase Sep. S/N 142110, and eluted<br>
using a gradient of 20mM NH4Ac (pH 5.5) and AcN. In an alternate purification,<br>
me venom may be purified on the Mono Q column using 20mM ammonium acetate<br>
buffer, pH 6.9. The fraction with apeak at 17 minutes is further purified by HPLC<br>
as described above. NMR, HPLC and LC/MS analyses revealed the identity of the<br>
synthetic and natural peptides.<br>
Similarly, pENW, pEEW and pENTW or pENWT have been purified from<br>
Crotalus adamanteus venom, and pENW has been purified from V. palestinae<br>
venom.<br>
Assays<br>
1. Analgesic assay<br>
In each test, a few tens of hamsters of similar weight and age were used.<br>
The hamsters were divided into groups according to the number of samples to be<br>
tested. Ointment (50% Lanolin and 50% Vaseline) containing the tested substance<br>
was applied to the animal's fur on the back region. The fur was not removed sc as<br>
to ensure that no damage to the skin occurred. A control group of hamsters was<br>
treated with ointment without the fraction of the invention. Hamsters were treated<br>
by topical application for 6, 14, 21 or 28 consecutive days. The test for analgesity<br><br>
was conducted following the last application of the ointment. In an alternate<br>
protocol, analgesiry was tested following a single application of the ointment<br>
Subsequently to application of the ointment, the hamsters "clean"<br>
themselves by dispersing the ointment all over their body with their tongue and<br>
legs. Thus, some of the ointment is introduced into the oral cavity and possibly<br>
.also into the intestine of the hamsters.<br>
In a typical test, a constant amount of ointment with or without an analgesic<br>
substance is applied to each animal for a predetermined period of one or more days.<br>
Following this period, pain is induced by a subcutaneous injection of 0.5ml of 1N<br>
HC1/ 0.1kg body weight in the femur region. The hamsters respond to the HCl<br>
injection by touching the area of injection with the tongue, this being called a<br>
"lick". 20 minute after injection the hamster is observed for 60 min and the<br>
number of "licks" are counted. The number of "licks" serves as a quantitative<br>
indication of the HCl induced pain.<br>
The analgesic effect is determined by comparing the mean number of "licks"<br>
in control animals to the number in treated animals. The significance of the<br>
difference was determined using t-test statistics.<br>
Example 1<br>
0.6 mg of pENW, pENWK-C8 or pBNWGAT (a dimer of pENW) were<br>
dissolved in 5ml of DDW, mixed by an tritrasonic mixer for 2 minutes and then<br>
dissolved in 315gr of ointment The final peptide concentration was 0.002 mg/gr.<br>
6 applications were made over a period of 4 weeks. The test for analgesity<br>
was conducted 10 days following the last application of the ointment. The results<br>
are summarized in the following table:<br><br><br><br>
*- Mann-Whitney rank sum test<br>
It can be clearly seen that the topical application of the tripeptide had a<br>
significant effect on reducing the pain of the animals, and mat the tetrapeptide<br>
derivative was even more effective. The addition of 3 amino acids to the<br>
C-terminal of the tripeptide completely abolished its activity.<br>
Example 2<br>
Compositions at a concentration of 0.020 mg/g were prepared as in Example<br>
1 containing me following active ingredients: pENW, pEEW, or pENTW or<br>
pENWT. 6 applications were made over a period of 5 weeks. The results are<br>
summarized below:<br><br>
*-Dunn's method<br>
It can be seen that all of the assayed peptides have significant analgesic<br>
activity.<br>
Example 3<br>
A composition containing pENW-C8 at a concentration of 0.002 mg/g<br>
ointment was prepared as in Example 1. A single application was made to the<br>
animals, and analgesity was assayed 11, 23 and 48 days post-application. Ointment<br>
without an active substance was applied to the control animals.<br><br>
The results are summarized below:<br><br>
*-Duna's method<br>
The results indicate mat the analgesic effect builds over time, reaching a<br>
peak after around 23 days, and subsequently declines.<br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1. A pharmaceutical composition for topical<br>
administration comprising an analgesic effective<br>
amount of a peptide comprising L-amino acids of the<br>
formula (I):<br>

Y is TRP or THR,<br>
and Z is any L-amino acid, or Z is null<br>
and wherein when Z is any L-amino acid, one but not<br>
both of Y and Z is TRP, and when Z is null, Y=TRP and<br>
with the further proviso that when Z is null, a peptide<br>
has an alkyl group attached to an amino acid thereof,<br>
wherein said alkyl is selected from the group<br>
consisting of C4-C30,<br>

wherein said peptide is a tripeptide and Z is null.<br><br>
8. A peptide comprising L-amino acids of the formula (I):<br>
PGLU-X-Y-Z (I)<br>
wherein X is an amino acid selected from the group<br>
consisting of GLY, VAL, GLU, ASP, SER, ALA, ASN,<br>
GLN, ILE, LEU, PRO, LYS and ARG,<br>
Y is TRP or THR,<br>
and Z is any L-amino acid, or Z is null,<br>
and wherein when Z is any L-amino acid, one but not<br>
both of Y and Z is TRP, and when Z is null, Y=TRP,<br>
or a derivative of said peptide in which an alkyl group<br>
is attached to an amino acid, wherein the length of<br>
said alkyl is C4-C30, with the proviso that when Z is<br>
any L-amino acid, if X=ALA, Z is not LEU or MET, if<br>
X=LYS, Z is not ALA or PRO, and if X=PRO, Z is not<br>
VAL or MET<br>
and with the further proviso that when Z is null, said<br>
peptide has said alkyl group attached to an amino acid<br>
thereof.<br>
9. An alkyl ester as claimed in claim 8 wherein said alkyl<br>
is an octyl group (C8).<br><br>
10. A tetrapeptide as claimed in any of claims 9-11.<br>
11. A tripeptide as claimed in any of claims 9-11.<br>
12. A pharmaceutical composition for treatment or<br>
prevention of pain comprising an analgesic effective<br>
amount of a peptide as claimed in claim 9.<br>
13. A pharmaceutical composition for treatment or<br>
prevention of pain comprising an analgesic effective<br>
amount of an alkyl ester or amide of a peptide as<br>
claimed in claim 9.<br>
14. A pharmaceutical composition as claimed in claim 1<br>
wherein said peptide is pGlu-Asn-Trp-Thr, pGlu-Asn-<br>
Thr-Trp, or pGlu-Asn-Trp-Lys-C8.<br>
15. A peptide as claimed in claim 9 which is pGlu-Asn-<br>
Trp-Thr, pGlu-Asn-Thr-Trp, or pGlu-Asn-Trp-Lys-C8.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition for topical administration comprising<br>
an analgesic effective amount of a peptide comprising L-amino acids<br>
of the formula (I):<br>
PGLU-X-Y-Z (I)<br>
wherein X is an amino acid selected from the group consisting of<br>
GLY, VAL, GLU, ASP, SER, ALA, ASN, GLN, IUE, LEU, PRO, LYS and<br>
ARG, Y is TRP or THR, and Z is any L-amino acid, or Z is null, and<br>
wherein when Z is any L-amino acid, one but not both of Y and Z is<br>
TRP, and when Z is null, Y= TRP, or an analgesic effective amount of<br>
a peptide derivative in which an alkyl group is attached to an amino<br>
add of said peptide, wherein said alkyl is selected from the group<br>
consisting of C2-C30, and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.</td>
