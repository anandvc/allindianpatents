				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates in general to a lifting device with a load wheel with a load chain<br>
and a hand chain wheel with a hand chain, and more particularly to a lifting device<br>
wherein the hand chain wheel is covered with a cover which is supported for rotation<br>
about the hand chain wheel and has chain guide openings.<br>
Reference is made to Co-pending Application No. IN/PCT/2001/00810.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 3,030,076 discloses a lifting device in form of a hoist or pulley block with a<br>
separately guided load and a hand chain, wherein the hand chain wheel is covered with a<br>
one-piece hand chain wheel housing which surrounds the hand chain wheel. That hand<br>
chain wheel housing is supported for rotation about the hand chain wheel and has chain<br>
guide openings for feeding and withdrawing the hand chain.<br>
The rotatable arrangement of the hand chain wheel housing is intended to enable the<br>
chain guide openings to follow the pulling forces that act on the hand chain, so that the<br>
chain guide openings are approximately perpendicular to the pulling direction. The hand<br>
chain has then sufficient clearance for passing through the chain guide openings without<br>
friction. This arrangement advantageously reduces the friction losses and the pulling<br>
forces required for lifting a load.<br>
However, the design of this lifting device, in particular of the cover for the hand chain<br>
wheel, is relatively complex. In practice, the chain can jam or jump in spite of the fact<br>
that the hand chain wheel housing is able to rotate. This causes the hand chain wheel to<br>
jerk or slip and thereby also bangs in the hand chain and the load chain. Moreover, during<br>
operation of the hand chain wheel in certain applications, the chain can produce annoying<br>
noise.<br>
It would therefore be desirable to improve the design and functionality of a lifting device<br>
with a rotatably supported cover for the hand chain wheel.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, the cover is rotatably supported by a supporting<br>
metal sheet which is attached to a side plate of a housing that receives the load chain<br>
wheel. An outwardly oriented guide disposed on the cover engages with a slide ring on<br>
the supporting metal sheet. The slide ring has a central recess for the cover.<br>
The guide on the cover is preferably formed as a circumferential collar, which can be<br>
formed by an S-shaped edge of the cover edge .<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, the guide can be formed by an edge<br>
seam of the cover edge facing the side plate.<br>
The lifting device according to the invention is characterized by a functional cover for<br>
covering the hand chain wheel, wherein the cover is simple and reliably supported for<br>
rotation. The cover can be rotated by 360.degree. about the hand chain wheel and follows<br>
the pulling forces that act on the hand chain, so that the hand chain is always oriented<br>
along the pulling direction. The cover adjusts automatically according to the pulling<br>
direction of the hand chain. The lifting device of the invention can be operated from all<br>
directions, and the hand chain is no longer deflected on the chain guide openings. The<br>
hand chain can run smoothly and with only small friction losses perpendicular through<br>
the chain guide openings. The applied pulling force is thereby transferred to the hand<br>
chain wheel via the hand chain with low losses.<br>
Advantageously, the cover can also be assembled in a simple manner. The hand chain<br>
wheel can be covered using only a few lightweight components. The cover together with<br>
the supporting metal sheet is adjusted and secured on the side plate of the housing,<br>
preferably with screws.<br>
According to yet another embodiment of the invention, the slide ring is formed by an<br>
annular stamped portion of the supporting metal sheet, making fabrication of the device<br>
simple and economical.<br>
According to yet another embodiment of the invention, the passage of the hand chain<br>
through the chain guide opening can be supported by sliding blocks associated with the<br>
chain guide openings, in a particularly preferred embodiment of the lifting device of the<br>
invention, the sliding blocks are made of plastic and form a part of a one-piece shell body<br>
incorporated in the cover. The shell body is preferably made of polyamide.<br>
The shell body is placed in the cover and installed together with the cover. The shell body<br>
moves with the cover when the cover rotates. The sliding blocks reliably guide the hand<br>
chain through the chain guide openings. In addition, the sliding blocks also reduce noise.<br>
The rattling noise frequently observed during operation of the hand chain is strongly<br>
attenuated.<br>
According to still another advantageous embodiment, one end face of the covei has an<br>
opening which is closed with a cover plate that is coupled with the hand chain wheel. The<br>
cover plate rotates with the hand chain wheel. The hand chain wheel and the load wheel<br>
are mounted on the drive shaft, wherein the end of the drive shaft facing the hand chain<br>
wheel is accessible via the cover plate.<br>
Further features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the<br>
follDwing description of preferred embodiments and from the claims.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The following figures depict certain illustrative embodiments of the invention in which<br>
like reference numerals refer to like elements. These depicted embodiments are to be<br>
understood as illustrative of the invention and not as limiting in any way.<br>
FIG- 1 shows a top view of a lifting device;<br>
FIG. 2 is a vertical longitudinal section along the line II—II of the diagram of FIG 1;<br>
FIG. 3 is a vertical longitudinal section along the line II—II of the diagram of FIG. 1; and<br>
FIG. 4 shows a detail of a guide on a caver in an alternative embodiment<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
FIGS. 1 to 3 to show a lifting device 1 which can be used in different ways for raising,<br>
lowering, and pulling loads L or for assembling parts.<br>
Lifting device 1 includes a hand chain wheel 2 with hand chain 3, a friction disc brake 4,<br>
a load,wheel 5 with load chain 6 and a gear 7, which are arranged sequentially in the<br>
axial direction. The hand chain wheel 2 is located at one end 8 of a drive shaft 9. For<br>
transmitting torque, the friction disc brake 4 can be coupled with the gear 7 which is<br>
located at the other end 10 of the drive shaft 9 and drives the load wheel 5, via the drive<br>
shaft 9 which extends through the friction disc brake 4 and the load wheel 5. The load<br>
wheel 5 is supported inside a housing 11 between side plates 12 and 13.<br>
The hand chain wheel 2 is rotated by pulling the hand chain 3, thereby transmitting the<br>
torque via the drive shaft 9 and the gear 7 to the load wheel 5 for raising and lowering a<br>
load. It can be seen that the hand chain wheel 2 is covered by a cover 14 supported for<br>
rotation and having two chain guide openings 15, 16. The cover 14 is rotatably supported<br>
by a supporting metal sheet 17 which is attached to the side plate 12. A radially<br>
outwardly oriented guide 18 of the cover 14 engages with a slide ring 20 of the<br>
supporting metal sheet 17. The slide ring 20 is provided with a center recess 19 for the<br>
cover 14. The guide 18 is implemented as a circumferential guide collar 21 formed by an<br>
S-shaped edge 22 of the cover edge 23 that faces the side plate 12. The edge 22 includes<br>
a radial segment 24 and an axial segment 25, with a rounded arcuate section 26 forming a<br>
transition between the radial and axial segments. The slide ring 20 is formed by an<br>
annular stamped portion 27 on the supporting metal sheet 17. The slide ring 20 has an<br>
approximately opposite shape so as to formfittingly engage with the edge 22.<br>
The cover 14 together with the supporting metal sheet 17 is attached to the side plate 12<br>
with screws 28. The cover 14 is reliably guided and rotatably supported through<br>
cooperation between the guide 8 and the guide 18 and the slide ring 20.<br>
As seen in particular from FIG. 3, the sliding blocks 29, 30 are associated with the chain<br>
guide openings 15, 16. The sliding blocks 29, 30 are a component of a shell body 31 that<br>
is made of polyamide and incorporated in the cover 14. The sliding blocks 29, 30 include<br>
bead-shaped lips 32, allowing a smooth and quiet passage of the hand chain 3.<br>
The end face of the cover 14 has an opening which is closed by a cover plate 34 that is<br>
coupled with the hand chain wheel 2. The cover plate 34 hence rotates with the hand<br>
chain wheel 2.<br>
The rotatable arrangement of the cover 14 about the hand chain wheel 2 allows operation<br>
of the lifting device 1 from any direction. The cover tips with the hand chain 3 depending<br>
on the applied pulling forces. As a result, the hand chain 3 is always fed and withdrawn<br>
through the chain guide openings 15,16 in the direction of the applied pulling force, so<br>
that the lifting device can operate quietly and with low friction.<br>
FIG. 4 shows an alternative embodiment of the guide 18' of a cover 14'. The guide 18' is<br>
formed by an annular edge seam 35 of the cover edge 23' facing the side plate 12'. In all<br>
other aspects, this embodiment operates in the same manner as the aforedescribed design.<br>
To raise a load L, the hand chain wheel 2 is rotated clockwise in the direction of the<br>
arrow PI of FIG. 1. The hand chain wheel 2 can initially rotate freely relative to the drive<br>
shaft on a bushing 36 (see FIG. 2), so that the hand chain wheel 2 moves relative to the<br>
drive shaft 9, until projections (not shown) of the hand chain wheel 2 make contact with<br>
wings 37 of a wing disc 38. The wing disc 38 is secured against rotation on the drive<br>
shaft 9 through a serration 39, so that the drive shaft 9 also rotates clockwise.<br>
Accordingly, torque is transferred directly from the hand chain wheel 2 via the drive shaft<br>
1<br>
9 and the gear 7 to the load wheel 5. The friction disc brake 4 disengages by lifting the<br>
brake disc 40 from the brake. The brake disc 40 sits on a section 42 of the drive shaft 9<br>
provided with a right hand motion thread 41 and operates through a friction disc 43 on a<br>
pressure disc 44 that is coupled to the load wheel 5. The load L can then be raised<br>
without a braking action.<br>
When the hand chain wheel 2 is stopped, the suspended load L causes the load wheel 5 to<br>
rotate in the opposite direction, i.e., counterclockwise and in the same sense as the drive<br>
shaft 9. As a result, the brake disc 40 is pulled in the direction of arrow P2 against the<br>
friction disc 43 which is in turn pulled against the pressure disc 44. The load L is pinned<br>
at this height.<br>
To loyer the load L, the hand chain wheel 2 is rotated counterclockwise in the direction<br>
of arrow P3. After a predetermined rotation angle, a driving pin 45 disposed on the<br>
backside of the brake disc 40 comes into contact with a rib 46 of the hand chain wheel 2.<br>
The brake disc 40 is hereby moved on the motion thread 41 of the drive shaft and lifted<br>
from the friction disc 43 which is in turn lifted from the pressure disc 44. The load L then<br>
causes the drive shaft 7 to rotate relative to the hand chain wheel 2, so that the brake disc<br>
40 is pulled against the friction disc 43, braking the load. The load wheel 5 coasts,<br>
depending on the degree to which the friction disc brake 4 opens during rotation of the<br>
hand chain wheel 2, thereby controllably lowering and braking the load.<br>
While the invention has been disclosed in connection with the preferred embodiments<br>
shown and described in detail, various modifications and improvements thereon will<br>
beconie readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, the spirit and scope of<br>
the present invention is to be limited only by the following claims.<br>
