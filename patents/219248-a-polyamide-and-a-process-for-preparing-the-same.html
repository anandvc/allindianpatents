				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> <br><br>
The present invention relates to a polyamide and a process for preparing the same. The polyamide contains a compound which bears at least one hydroxy group and has chemical bonding by way of an amide group to the end of the polymer chain.<br>
It further relates to a process for preparing this polyamide, and to fibers, films, and moldings comprising at least one such polyamide.<br>
Polyamides, in particular nylon-6, and nylon-6,6, are industrially significant polymers. They are usually prepared by reacting suitable monomers such as caprolactam, adipic acid, or hexamethylenediamine, in the presence of water.<br>
Unless further measures are taken, this gives polyamides which during downstream steps of processing, such as injection molding, have a tendency to undergo uncontrolled molecular weight increase with a resultant impairment of processing properties. In particular, an increase in melt viscosity occurs (determined as a fall-off in the melt volume flow rate to EN ISO 1133), and in injection molding, for example, this leads to longer cycle time.<br>
To stabilize the polyamide with respect to this type of uncontrolled molecular weight increase, it is usual to use chain regulators during the preparation of the polymer, an example being propionic acid.<br>
These chain regulators can substantially suppress the molecular weight increase but in order to shorten cycle times in injection molding it is desirable to increase the melt volume flow rate of polyamides to EN ISO 1133 while the relative viscosity determined to DIN 51562-1 to -4, remains the same.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a process which, in a technically simple and cost-effective manner, permits the preparation of a polyamide which when compared with polyamides chain-regulated by conventional methods has higher melt volume flow rate to EN ISO 1133 while the relative viscosity determined to DIN 51562-1 to -4, remains the same.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by means of the polyamide defined at the outset, a process for its preparation, and fibers, films, and moldings, comprising at least one such polyamide.<br><br>
For the purposes of the present invention, polyamides are homopolymers, copolymers, mixtures, and grafts of synthetic long-chain polyamides which have repeat amide groups as a substantial constituent in the main polymer chain. Examples of these polyamides are nylon-6 (polycaprolactam), nylon-6,6 (polyhexamethyleneadipamide), ny-lon-4,6 (polytetramethyleneadipamide), nylon-6,10 (polyhexamethylenesebacimide), nylon-7 (polyenantholactam), nylon-11 (polyundecanolactam), nylon-12 (polydodeca-nolactam). These polyamides are known by the generic name nylon. For the purposes of the present invention, polyamides also include those known as aramids (aromatic polyamides), such as polymetaphenyleneisophthalimide (NOMEX R Fiber, US-A-3,287,324), and polyparaphenyleneterephthalamide (KEVLAR R Fiber, US-A-3,671,542).<br>
The preparation of polyamides may in principle take place by two methods.<br>
During the polymerization of dicarboxylic acids and diamines, or polymerization of amino acids or derivatives of these, such as aminocarboxylic nitrites, aminocarbox-amides, aminocarboxylic esters, or aminocarboxylic salts, the amino end groups and carboxy end groups of the starting monomers or starting oligomers react with one another to form an amide group and, for example, water. The water can then be removed from the polymer. During the polymerization of aminocarboxamides, the amino and amide end groups of the starting monomers or starting oligomers react with one another to form an amide group and ammonia. The ammonia can then be removed from the polymer. During the polymerization of aminocarboxylic esters, the amino and ester end groups of the starting monomers or starting oligomers react with one another to form an amide group and an alcohol. The alcohol can then be removed from the polymer. During the polymerization of aminocarboxylic nitriles the nitrile groups may firstly be reacted with water to give amide groups or carboxylic acid groups, and the resultant aminocarboxamides or aminocarboxylic acids can be reacted as described. This polymerization reaction is usually termed polycondensation.<br>
The polymerization of lactams as starting monomers or starting oligomers is usually termed polyaddition.<br>
The polyamides can be obtained by processes known per se, for example those de<br>

Examples<br>
In the examples, solution viscosity was measured as relative solution viscosity in 96% sulfuric acid to DIN 51562-1 to -4.<br>
For this, 1 g of polymer was weighed out for 100 ml of solution, and the throughflow time was measured in a Ubbelohde viscometer in comparison with the pure solvent.<br>
Example 1<br>
350 g (3.1 mol) of caprolactam, 35 g of demineralized water, and 1.6 g (8*10-3 mol) of 6-hydroxycaproic acid (purity 95%) were heated under nitrogen to an internal temperature of 270°C in a laboratory autoclave, and then immediately depressurized to atmospheric pressure within one hour, post-condensed for 60 minutes, and discharged.<br>
The discharged polyamide was granulated, extracted with boiling water to remove caprolactam and oligomers, and then dried in a vacuum drying cabinet. The dried extracted granules were heat-conditioned for various times in the solid phase at 160°C (5 h,10h, 20 h, 30 h).<br><br>
Table 1 below shows the resultant relative solution viscosities after various heat-conditioning times.<br><br>
Heat conditioning time	Oh	10	15h	20 h	30 h<br>
Relative solution viscosity	2.47	2.74	2.83	2.86	3.00<br>
Table 1<br>
Example 2<br>
The melt behavior of four polyamide specimens from Example 1 was studied. For this, oscillatory shear measurements were made at 250°C and melt viscosity measurements were carried out to ISO 11433. The zero-shear viscosity r|0, i.e. the melt viscosity at zero shear, is a function of the molar mass Mn for linear polyamides with Schulz-Flory distribution:<br>
The molar mass was determined by light scattering. Figure 1 shows that the polyamides prepared as in Example 1 are linear:<br>
Example 3<br>
Example 1 was repeated in a pressure vessel using the following mixture: 400 kg (3571 mol) of caprolactam, 40 kg of demineralized water, and 1.06 kg (8 mol) of 6-hydroxycaproic acid. The polyamide discharged was extracted, dried, and heat-conditioned in the solid phase to a relative solution viscosity of RV=2.72. An extruder was then used to compound 30% by weight of OCF 123 D 10 P glass fibers (from OCF) and 7% by weight of Lupolen KR 1270 rubber (from BASF Aktienge-sellschaft) into the material (the percentages being based on the finished compounded material). The relative solution viscosity after compounding was 2.80.<br>
Comparative Example<br>
Example 3 was repeated with the modification that 0.592 kg (8 mol) of propionic acid<br>
was used instead of 6-hydroxycaproic acid.<br>
The relative solution viscosity after compounding was 2.79.<br>
Melt volume rate (MVR) measurement to ISO 1133<br><br>
Melt volume rate (MVR) measurements were carried out to ISO 1133 on the compounded materials from Example 3 and from the comparative examples. The melt temperature here was 275°C and the ram weight was 5 kg.<br>
Figure 2 shows the comparison of the melt volume rate for various residence times in the melt.<br>
Flowability in two types of flow spirals (diameter 1.5 mm, 2 mm) was tested on the compounded materials from Example 3 and the comparative example. The temperature of the spirals was 280°C. Flow path was measured in cm. Table 2 below shows the measurements:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
