3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which<br>
it is to be performed :	<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel stable aqueous coating dispersions of wax or combination of waxes.<br>
The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical, food and cosmetic applications of the novel aqueous coating dispersions of wax or combination of waxes.<br>
In particular the pharmaceutical applications include taste masking, stabilization and release retardation of drugs.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Pharmaceutical dosage forms are coated for various reasons including (1) protecting the drug from its surrounding environment (particularly air, moisture, and light) with a view to improving stability, (2) masking of unpleasant taste and odour, (3) increasing the ease by which the product can be ingested by the patient, (4) improving the product identity, (5) facilitating handling, particularly high speed packaging / filling lines, and automated counters in pharmacies, where the coating minimizes cross-contamination due to dust elimination , (6) improving product appearance , particularly where there are noticeable visible differences in the tablet core ingredients from batch to batch, (7) reducing the risk of interaction between incompatible components, (8) improving product mechanical integrity, since coated products generally are more resistant to mishandling (abrasion, attrition, etc), (9) modifying drug release, as in enteric-coated, repeat-action and sustained-release products.<br>
Pharmaceutical dosage forms are coated using various polymeric or non-polymeric materials dissolved or dispersed in an aqueous or non-aqueous solvent. Use of organic solvents has faced a lot of regulatory restrictions over time due to its inherent cumbersome procedures leading to undesirable effects. These include explosion, fire hazard, toxic release, all of which lead to environmental pollution. Due to the regulatory and manufacturing issues, pharmaceutical companies are rapidly replacing the organic solvents based coating procedures with aqueous film coating processes.<br>
2<br><br>
In the past, waxes have been employed for coating, which give better retardation of drug release due to their hydrophobic nature compared to hydrophilic polymers. However their use has been restricted to non-aqueous methods or hot melt techniques. Use of wax in the hot melt technique involves melting of the wax which is then employed in various processes such as granulation, spray coating and extrusion-spheronisation. These methods involve cumbersome procedures and require special equipments. In addition, in case of hot melt-technique, during coating stage, the drug is exposed to high temperature, which is not preferred as it may alter or degrade the drug substance.<br>
In prior art are described applications of coating of pharmaceutical products to achieve taste masking, stabilization and release retardation of drugs. These are described below:<br>
US5151433 discloses coating of drug with a protective polymeric coat. The object of the invention is to protect the labile drug from mechanical stress encountered during compression by using a polymer. The patent describes only polymers as protective agent and waxes as protective agent is not anticipated by this invention.<br>
A multiparticulate controlled release selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) formulation for oral administration is claimed in WO 00/71099A1. The formulation comprises particles of drug coated with rate-controlling polymer, which allows controlled release over a period of not less than about 12 hours. The instant invention makes use of wax for rate controlling instead of polymer claimed in the WO 00/71099A1. The polymeric plasticizer employed in the present invention only helps to produce the uniform film and does not retard the release of the active ingredient.<br>
US6448323 describes a dry film coating composition for use in coating pharmaceutical tablets, nutritional supplements, food, confectionery forms, agricultural seeds, and the like, comprises polyvinyl alcohol, a plasticizer such as polyethylene glycol or glycerin, talc, and preferably a pigment/opacifier and lecithin. This patent also describes a film coating composition, however no wax is employed in the coating composition.<br>
None of the above mentioned prior art applications describe use of waxes as a coating agent more particularly from an aqueous base. Thus there is   a long<br>
3<br><br>
felt need in the pharmaceutical industry to have coating dispersions that are not only aqueous based but also have the advantages provided by using wax as a coating agent.<br>
US2001019725 relates generally to a method of manufacture of controlled release particles containing drug, carrier wax and an excipient by hot melt and mechanical processes. US6238704 relates to a process for preparing a sustained-release formulation by: 1) coating drug containing granules successively with layers of wax, ethyl cellulose containing a plasticizer and a water soluble polymer followed by 2) heating at 50-90Â°C.<br>
The above two prior art examples utilize heat to melt the waxy components unlike the present invention which utilizes coating with an aqueous wax emulsion.<br>
US5023108 relates to a process for coating of pharmaceutical solids using an aqueous wax emulsion (prepared from a spray dried mixture) containing waxes or lipids alone or in combination in the range of 10 to 30%. PCT application WO04083310 describes the preparation and use of a water-wax emulsion, comprising: about 10% to about 50% of a hydrogenated vegetable wax; about 50% to about 90% by weight water; about 1% to about 25% by weight of a surface-active agent, and about 0.02% to about 2.5% of an acid or base, based on the total weight of the emulsion. Applications described include coating of fibrous cellulosic products to improve moisture resistance.<br>
The above two patents describe use of aqueous emulsions containing wax or waxes for coating. However these emulsions contain 10-30% and 10-50% of waxes in comparison with the present invention, which employs wax contents of up to about 10%.<br>
The inventors have found that aqueous wax coating disperion with upto about 10% of wax and the use of a plasticizer in the emulsified wax results in a continuous, uniform film formation of the wax, demonstrating excellent coating properties and exhibiting all the desirable qualities of an aqueous base coating medium. The coating dispersion described herein has the advantage of aqueous base as against organic solvents that are commonly employed for coating application involving waxes.<br>
4<br><br>
Objects of the invention:<br>
It is thus an object of the invention to provide aqueous-based wax coating dispersions that overcome problems associated with prior art.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a stable aqueous coating dispersion of waxes for coating solid dosage forms.<br>
It is yet another object of the invention to provide wax coating dispersions that combine the advantages of having an aqueous coating base and wax as coating agent.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide wax coating dispersions having emulsified wax in combination with a plasticizer rendering stable and uniform film formation.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide aqueous wax coating dispersions that retard the release of the drug from the dosage form.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide aqueous wax coating dispersions that improve the stability of the active compounds.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide aqueous wax coating dispersions for masking the bitter taste of active ingredients.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention addresses the need for an aqueous wax coating dispersion which can be used for various purposes like retardation of and pulsatile and extended release, taste masking and stabilization of drug substances. According to the invention, the composition of an aqueous wax coating dispersion typically contains in an aqueous medium;<br>
a)	a wax or combination of waxes<br>
b)	an emulsifying agent, and<br>
c)	a plasticizer<br>
Composition<br>
The compositions of the present invention are discussed in greater detail with respect to the individual ingredients as hereunder:<br>
6<br><br>
Wax component:<br>
Waxes can be individual or mixtures of esters of monohydroxy alcohols, besides other esters and free fatty acids, free alcohols, higher hydrocarbons and natural or hydrogenated oils. Among the waxes derived from plants are carnauba wax and candelilla wax. The waxy substance secreted by glands on the abdomen of the bee is known commonly as beeswax. Waxes of animal origin include wool wax, or lanolin; spermaceti, and Chinese wax. Mineral waxes include ozocerite and paraffin, both composed of hydrocarbons. Japan wax and bayberry (or myrtle) wax are composed chiefly of fats.<br>
Waxes form excellent barrier coatings for moisture sensitive drugs. The system protects the drug molecules from atmospheric moisture without affecting the active ingredient thus providing good stability and protection for hygroscopic drugs. Waxes are also used as retarding agents for drug release.<br>
The preferred wax according to the present invention is selected from carnauba wax, candelilla wax, spermaceti, bees wax, montan wax, microcrystalline wax, lecithin, hydrogenated tallow, paraffin wax, cetyl alcohol, cetostearyl alcohol, stearic acid hydrogenated vegetable oil such as hydrogenated cottonseed oil (lubritabâ¢), hydrogenated soyabean oil (sterotex HMNF â¢), compritol, precirol, shellac wax, petrolatum, and the like as well as synthetic waxes, e.g., polyethylene, and the like . These waxes can be used alone or in combinations.<br>
Wax may be used at a concentration of up to about 10% by weight.<br>
The preferred percentage wax according to present invention is 0.5% -9% by weight<br>
The most preferred percentage wax according to present invention is about 2.5-7.5% by weight.<br>
Emulsifying agent:<br>
Emulsifying agent or Emulsifiers generally classified as surfactants and have hydrophilic and lipophilic structural portions within their molecular structures. Pharmaceutically acceptable emulsifiers should also be stable, compatible with other ingredients and non-toxic. It should possess little odor, taste or color and should not interfere with the stability of efficacy of the active agent. The emulsifier<br>
7<br><br>
may be selected from hydrophilic surfactants or lipophilic surfactants or mixtures thereof. The surfactants may be anionic, nonionic, cationic, and zwitterionic surfactants.<br>
The preferred emulsifying agents according to the present invention are selected from non-ionic emulsifiers like mono- and diglycerides, medium chain glyceride (Capmul) glyceryl monooleate (Peceol), glyceryl ricinoleate, glyceryl laurate and glyceryl caprylate (Capmul MCM), PEG sorbitan fatty acid esters like PEG -20 sorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20), PEG 20 sorbitan monostearate (Tween 60) and PEG sorbitan monooleate (Tween 80), Sorbitan fatty acid esters like sorbitan monolaurate (span 20), sugar ester surfactants like sucrose distearate (sucro ester 7), ionic emulsifiers like sodium caprylate sodium lauryl sulphate, phospholipids, alginate salts. These emulsifiers can be used alone or in combinations.<br>
The emulsifying agent is employed at a percentage of about 0.1-10% by weight.<br>
The preferred percentage of emulsifying agent according to present invention is about 0.5-7.5% by weight<br>
The most preferred percentage of emulsifying agent according to present invention is 0.75-5.0%, by weight of the total composition.<br>
Plasticizer:<br>
Plasticizers are used to improve the processibility, flexibility, and elasticity of coating agents. These plasticizing compounds also reduce the brittleness, , and improve the toughness and tensile strength of the coating agents. They play an important role in the film formation process. The quality of the resulting film is dependent on the type and amount of plasticizer added to the coating medium. According to the present invention, plasticizers may be polymeric or non-polymeric and soluble or insoluble in water.<br>
The preferred plasticizer according to the present invention is selected from polymers like ammonio methacrylate co-polymer, Eudragit RL, Eudragit RS, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl acetate, mixture of polyvinyl acetate with povidone (Kollidone SRâ¢) methylcellulose, ethyl cellulose, sodium carboxy methylcellulose,   hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose<br>
8<br><br>
or polyethylene glycol, cellulose acetate cellulose propionate (lower, medium or higher molecular weight), cellulose acetate propionate, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose acetate phthalate, cellulose triacetate, poly (methyl methacrylate), poly (ethyl methacrylate), poly (butyl methacrylate), poly (isobutyl methacrylate), and poly (hexyl methacrylate). poly (isodecyl methacrylate), poly (lauryl methacrylate), poly (phenyl methacrylate), poly (methyl acrylate), poly (isopropyl acrylate), poly (isobutyl acrylate), poly (octadecyl acrylate), poly (ethylene), poly (ethylene) low density, poly (ethylene) high density, poly (ethylene oxide), poly (ethylene terphthalate) poly (vinyl isobutyl ether), poly (vinyl acetate), poly (vinyl chloride) or polyurethane, polymers based on acrylate and/or methacrylates)or any of the polymers with similar plasticizing function.<br>

The chosen plasticizer can be used individually or in combinations.<br>
The plasticizer is employed at a concentration of 5 to 40% by weight of the wax, preferably 7.5% to 35% by weight of the wax, and more preferably 10%-30% by weight of the wax.<br>
Process<br>
The  procedures for preparation  of aqueous wax coating  dispersion containing wither a water soluble or water insoluble plasticizer are described below: The process for a water soluble plasticizer comprises steps of:<br>
a)	heating the wax with emulsifying agent at a temperature above the melting point of the wax.<br>
b)	Adding a part of hot water under stirring to the mixture of step (i)<br>
c)	Cooling to room temperature to get a smooth, stable emulsion<br>
d)	adding the solution of plasticizer in the remaining amount of water to the mixture of step (iii) under stirring.<br>
The process for a water insoluble plasticizer comprises steps of:<br>
a)       heating the wax with emulsifying agent and plasticizer at a temperature<br>
9<br><br>
above the highest melting component of the blend<br>
b)	Adding the a part of hot water under stirring to the mixture of step (i)<br>
c)	Cooling to room temperature to get a smooth, stable emulsion.<br>
d)	Adding the remaining amount of water to the   mixture of step (iii) under stirring.<br>
The dispersion obtained from any of the above process Gan be screened through a 150 micron (100#) sieve in order to confirm the absence of any insoluble material and an uniformity of the dispersion.<br>
Applications<br>
According to the present invention the aqueous wax coating emulsion can be employed to apply a wax coat to any suitable solid pharmaceutical form, e.g. drug particles, granules, pellets, tablets, capsules, patches, films. The wax-coated particulates may be compressed or suitably processed into a dosage form.<br>
Wax coating, according to the current invention, is aimed at achieving stabilization, taste masking and modification of release of a drug substance. One skilled in the art will also appreciate that the coating dispersion described herein can replace any polymer coating known thus far in the field of pharmaceutical coating. Stabilization of drug substance can be in respect of hydrolytic, oxidative or any other form of degradation. Modified drug release can be in the form of sustained, pulsatile, delayed, or targeted release.<br>
The details of the invention, its objects and advantages are explained hereunder in relation to non-limiting exemplary illustrations.<br>

Example 3<br>
Stability of aqueous wax coating dispersion<br>
The aqueous wax coating dispersion prepared in Example 1 and Example 2 were observed visually for physical stability such as cracking (separation of<br>
11<br><br>
phases) or creaming of oil droplets at the surface after 1, 7, 15 and 30 days storage at the ambient.<br>

Hydrogenated cottonseed oil was heated in a water bath at 80Â°C-85Â°C. A 10% solution of Polyoxyethylene 20 sorbitan monooleate heated to 90Â° C, was then added to the molten lipid mass with constant stirring using a suitable laboratory mixer. A 4% dispersion of Veegum in water was heated to 90Â°C and added with stirring to above dispersion. The crude emulsion thus formed was then homogenized and shock-cooled in an ice-bath with constant stirring, a solid mass (gritty particles) was formed.<br>
This observation demonstrates the inadequacy of this prior art system and the superiority of the compositions of the present invention through the use of a plasticizer and lower levels of wax content.<br>
Example 6<br>
Preparation of aqueous wax coating dispersion without plasticizer    to<br>
demonstrate the effect on film characteristics<br>
Table 5. Composition for the preparation of aqueous wax coating dispersion<br><br>
Ingredient	%w/w<br>
Hydrogenated vegetable oil Type 1 (Lubritab)	7.5<br>
Medium chain glycerides (Capmul MCM)	2.0<br>
Distilled Water	q.s.<br>
Hydrogenated vegetable oil and Capmul MCM were heated in a water bath at 80Â°C -85Â°C. A part of the water was heated to 90Â°C and added to the molten waxy mass with constant stirring using a suitable laboratory stirrer to obtain a smooth emulsion. The emulsion diluted with remaining quantity of water and cooled to room temperature.<br>
Films were cast using above emulsion and dispersion of Example 1 and dried at 40Â°C for 6-8 hours.<br>
Films obtained with dispersion of Example I were smooth and had minimum cracks whereas films of above dispersion gave discontinuous, cracked appearance. This data indicates the need of using a plasticizer in the aqueous wax coating dispersion. Plasticizer helps to reduce the brittleness of the film and improves the tensile strength of the film which is essential for a coating dispersion.<br>

constant stirring using a suitable laboratory stirrer to obtain a smooth emulsion.<br>
The emulsion was cooled to room temperature. In the remaining quantity of water,<br>
the plasticizer was dissolved and added to the above emulsion under stirring. In<br>
this example following variables were attempted:<br>
Composition A: Wax 9.5% w/w and plasticizer - 40% by weight of wax , which is<br>
as per the present invention<br>
Composition B: Wax 12% w/w and plasticizer - 40% by weight of wax<br>
Composition C: Wax 12% w/w and plasticizer - 30% by weight of wax<br>
Composition D: Wax 12% w/w and plasticizer -15% by weight of wax<br>
It was observed that at 9.5% w/w of wax a smooth and uniform, sprayable dispersion was obtained, however at 12% w/w of wax, the emulsion was very thick, had gritty appearance which can not be sprayed for coating purposes. Even with plasticizer concentration of 15% by weight of wax (Example D), the dispersion was not sprayable.<br>
This clearly demonstrates that above 10%w/w concentration of wax, the dispersion loses its liquid consistency and cannot be used as a coating agent.<br>
Example 14<br>

Ingredient	mg per tablet<br>
Metformin Hydrochloride	500.00<br>
Povidone (PVP K-90)	37.50<br>
Magnesium stearate	5.00<br>
Metformin hydrochloride and PVP K-30 weighed and sifted through mesh 40 and loaded in a Planetary Mixer and mixed for 10 minutes and then granulated using demineralized water. The wet mass was then dried in fluidized bed dryer at inlet air temperature of 60Â°C and bed temperature at 45Â°C. The dried granules<br>
18<br><br>
were then passed through mesh 16 and lubricated with magnesium stearate and compressed using capsule shaped punches.<br>
(b) Coating of Tablets using aqueous wax coating dispersion of example 1:<br>
800 g of Metformin tablets were placed in the coating equipment. The tablets were sprayed with the coating dispersion of Example 1 employing methods known in the art. The inlet temperature was kept at 60Â° C. The spraying was carried out continuously until the desired increase in mean weight of tablets was achieved. Tablets thus obtained had a smooth and lustrous surface.<br>

2hr	-	-	95.79	80.50<br>
4hr	-	-	101.36	97.91<br><br>
Dissolution profiles indicate that at a coating of 18%, a lagtime of about one hour in the release of metformin was observed and in the next 1 hour about 80% of the drug was released. This suggests that aqueous wax coating can be employed to develop pulsed delivery systems with a defined lag period.<br>

(c) Coating of Tablets using aqueous wax coating dispersion of example 2:<br>
200 g of Metformin tablets were placed in the coating vessel of fluidized bed processor. The tablets were sprayed with the coating emulsion of Example 2 according to the methods known in the art. The inlet temperature was kept at 60Â°C. The spraying was carried out continuously until the desired increase in mean weight of tablets was achieved. Tablets thus obtained had a smooth and lustrous surface. <br>

(c)	Coating of Tibolon pellets:<br>
Pellets (#20 to #60) were placed in the coating vessel of fluidized bed processor. The pellets were sprayed with the above coating dispersion (either a or b) according to the method known in the art. The inlet temperature was kept at 45Â°C. The spraying was carried out continuously until the desired coating level was achieved. Pellets thus obtained had a smooth and lustrous surface. Coated beads were then exposed at accelerated conditions of 40Â°C/38% RH and 40Â°C/75% RH  for 15 days. The levels of impurity C of tibolon were determined<br>

Aqueous wax dispersion coated beads	0.06	0.17<br>
HPMC coated beads	0.10	0.33<br>
Under both the accelerated conditions, it was found that the amount of impurity C was lowest for beads coated with the aqueous wax dispersion, suggesting that the aqueous wax coating dispersion can be employed to stabilize actives sensitive to temperature and/or moisture.<br>

(a)	Preparation of ascorbic acid tablets<br>
Vitamin C was granulated using molten Compritol. The mass was cooled to room temperature and further blended with Kollidone SR, Kollidone VA 64 and magnesium stearate. The blend was compressed using capsule shaped punches.<br>
(b)	Coating of tablets:<br>
The compressed tablets were coated in a conventional coating pan with wax coating dispersion of example 2 till a coating level of 5% was achieved.<br>
Both coated and uncoated tablets were placed in an open petriplate at 40Â°C/75% RH. After a week it was observed that the color of the uncoated tablets had changed to dark yellow both on the surface as well as inside the tablet (observed by cutting tablets into two halves) indicating degradation of ascorbic acid. However, the coated tablets were only pale yellow in color when tablets were cut into two halves. This example also suggest that aqueous wax coating<br>
26<br><br>
dispersion can be employed to stabilize actives which may be susceptible to degradation either by oxidation, heat or humidity or a combination of these.<br>
Example 19<br>
Use of aqueous wax coating dispersion to stabilize phenytoin sodium<br>
Phenytoin sodium shows incompatibility and discoloration when physically mixed with lactose in pharmaceutical compositions. Wax coating approach was applied to stabilize the phenytoin in presence of lactose.<br>
Plain phenytoin sodium was sifted through 40 # and mixed with MCC (Avicel PH 102) [1:1 ratio] and the mixture was loaded in fluidized bed processor. Coating of this mixture was carried out using wax coating dispersion of example 2.<br>
The phenytoin sodium-MCC mixture with a wax coating level of 10 %, was used for the physical incompatibility study by mixing with lactose (pharmatose 200 M) in a 1:2 ratio. The mixture was sifted through 40# and the samples were subjected to an accelerated stability study at room temperature and 40 degree/75% RH. A blend of uncoated phenytoin sodium-MCC mixture with Lactose (pharmatose 200) in the 1:2 was used as positive control. Samples were observed for physical changes in appearance and color.<br>
After an exposure for 3 days the color of the uncoated phenytoin blend had changed to yellow whereas coated phenytoin remained only slightly colored. Thus aqueous wax coating dispersion can be employed to prevent drug excipient interaction and thereby stabilize the drug.<br>

(c) Evaluation of tablets with respect to taste in human volunteers<br>
A panel of 10 human volunteers was selected. These tablets were dispersed in 15 ml of water and this dispersion was given to all the volunteers. The bitter taste of ursodiol was masked and the tablets were acceptable with respect to overall mouthfeel, taste and palatability.<br>
28<br><br>
Thus, granulation with aqueous wax dispersion can be employed for masking the bitter taste of drug such as ursodiol and this drug subsequently incorporated into dispersible tablet formulations.<br>

Weighed amounts of sweeteners and flavors were sifted through 60# and mixed with above blend to obtain uniform mixture. The entire blend was then passed through 40 # and remixed. The above blend was then lubricated with magnesium stearate and compressed to tablets using capsule shaped punches on a compression machine.<br>
The above process was also followed for plain uncoated cetirizine hydrochloride as control samples.<br>
(d) Evaluation of tablets with respect to taste and mouth feel in human volunteers<br>
A panel of 10 human volunteers was selected and all the volunteers were given one tablet each of both the samples i.e. wax coated cetirizine hydrochloride tablets and uncoated tablets. These tablets were kept on the tongue and ratings were given with respect to overall mouthfeel, taste and palatability.<br>
It was observed that the wax coated formulations showed much greater acceptance from all volunteers with respect to all the parameters, namely taste, mouth feel and overall palatability compared to uncoated tablets. Thus, coating with aqueous wax dispersion can be employed for masking the bitter taste of drug such as cetirizine hydrochloride and the coated drugs subsequently incorporated into mouth dissolve tablet Formulations. <br>

(c)	Evaluation of tablets with respect to perception of bitter taste<br>
A panel of 10 healthy human volunteers was selected and all the volunteers were given one tablet each of both the samples i.e. wax coated Pseudoephedrine tablets and uncoated Pseudoephedrine tablets as control. The time required for perception of bitter taste was recorded by volunteers. For uncoated tablets, the bitter taste of drug was perceived immediately (within one minute). However for wax coated tablets, the bitterness was not perceived even after 5 minutes. Thus, aqueous wax coating dispersion can be employed for masking the bitter taste of drugs incorporated into a tablet.<br>
