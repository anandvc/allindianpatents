				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a double-loop<br>
towel circular knitting machine, and more specifically to<br>
an inner pile jacquard mechanism for a double-loop towel<br>
circular knitting machine.<br>
In a regular double-loop towel circular knitting<br>
machine, the outer pile sinkers and the inner pile sinkers<br>
are arranged in pair in s inker cylinder, and a sinker cap is<br>
arranged on each pair of pile sinkers. The sinker cap has<br>
track means for pushing out the sinkers to knit a pile loop.<br>
During knitting, the sinkers are driven out by the sinker<br>
cap to match with a bottom knitting needle, so as to knit a<br>
double-loop towel. This structure of double-loop towel<br>
circular knitting machine can only knit a double-loop<br>
towel having a uniform patter at both sides. When<br>
changing the patter, the stroke of the outer pile sinkers<br>
and the stroke of the inner pile sinkers are respectively<br>
controlled. Actually, this knitting method can only<br>
change the size of the pile loops.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is the main object of the present invention to<br>
provide an inner pile jacquard mechanism for a double-<br>
loop tower circular knitting machine, which can be controlled to knit pile loops, or<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED<br>
EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring to the annexed drawings in detail, the<br>
present invention comprises an outer pile sinker 1, an<br>
inner pile sinker 2, a sinker cap 3 for driving the outer<br>
pile sinker 1 and the inner pile sinker 2, a selection jack 4<br>
pivoted to the rear end of the inner pile sinker 2, a<br>
selector 5 for driving the selection jack 4, a push cam 6<br>
for driving the selector 5, and a reset mechanism 7<br>
arranged at the back of the selection jack 4.<br>
The outer pile sinker 1 is arranged with the inner<br>
pile sinker 2 in one sliding groove in a sinker cylinder<br>
(not shown). The outer sinker 1 comprises a thick belly 11,<br>
a thin throat 12, a short nose 13, and a butt 14 near a rear<br>
side thereof. By means of the design of the throat 12<br>
and the nose 13, the outer pile 8 and the ground yarn 10<br>
can be smoothly matched with the bottom needle (not<br>
5 shown) and joined together to form or not to form a loop.<br>
The inner pile sinker 2 comprises a thin belly 21, a<br>
thick throat 22, a long nose 23, a coupling portion 25 at a<br>
rear side thereof pivoted to the selection jack 4, and a butt<br>
; 24 near the rear side. The design of the nose 23 enables<br>
the inner pile 9 and the ground yarn 10 to be matched with<br>
the bottom needle (not shown), and joined together to<br>
form or not to form a loop.<br>
The sinker cap 3 comprises two guide tracks 31<br>
and 32 for driving the outer pile sinker 1 and the inner<br>
pile sinker 2 to make pile-loops.<br>
The selection jack 4 is one of a set of selection<br>
jacks of the circular knitting machine, having a front side<br>
pivoted to the coupling portion 25 of the inner pile sinker<br>
2, a protruding portion 41 at a suitable location, and a butt<br>
42 near a rear side thereof.<br>
The selector 5 can be a computer-controlled or<br>
electromagnetic valve type selector, having a plurality of<br>
selector levers 51.<br>
The push cam 6 comprises an actuating portion 61.<br>
When the selector 5 is not pressed on the protruding<br>
portion 41 of the selection jack 4, the butt 42 of the<br>
selection jack 4 is moved along the actuating portion 61 of<br>
the cam 6, thereby causing the selection jack 4 to be<br>
pushed to the loop hanging zone.<br>
The reset mechanism 7 is formed of a spring plate<br>
arranged at the back of the selection jack 4, having a<br>
curved portion 71 pressed on the cylinder wall 101 of the<br>
sinker cylinder. When the selector 5 is operated, the<br>
selection jack 4 may be pressed. If the selection jack 4<br>
is pressed, the reset mechanism 7 is forced against the<br>
cylinder wall 101, and a reset action must be achieved so<br>
that the selection jack can be extended out for enabling a<br>
next jacquard knitting cycle to be run. The selection<br>
jack 4 is extended out of the face of the needle cylinder,<br>
enabling the protruding portion 41 to enter the push cam 6,<br>
ready for a next jacquard knitting cycle. The aforesaid<br>
members form a double-loop towel inner pile jacquard<br>
mechanism.<br>
The jacquard knitting operation includes seven<br>
steps. Normally, the outer pile sinker 1 and the inner<br>
pile sinker 2 are moved along the tracks at the sinker cap<br>
3. When the selector 5 is operated, the outer pile sinker<br>
1 and the inner pile sinker 2 are moved along the tracks at<br>
the push cam 6. The seven steps are outlined hereinafter<br>
with reference to Figures from 5A through 5J.<br>
At the first step, as shown in Figure 5A, after last<br>
sinker ring, the knitting needle 1A is moving upwards,<br>
three loops 8, 9 and 10, which were hooked in the hook of<br>
the knitting needle 1A, push open the latch 2A of the<br>
knitting needle 1A, the inner pile sinker 2 and the outer<br>
pile sinker 1 must be pushed forward to hold down old<br>
loops. When the knitting needle 1A is continuously<br>
lifted before reaching the feeding plate 3A, the latch 2A<br>
must be fully opened to let retained loops be released.<br>
The knitting needle 1A reaches the topmost position when<br>
the latch 2A is fully opened. After having finished the<br>
fabric holding down work, the inner pile sinker 2 and the<br>
outer pile sinker 1 are moved back (further, the throat of<br>
the outer pile sinker presses the pile loop for a certain<br>
length of time, enabling the outer pile to be tightly<br>
fastened up with the ground yarn, therefore the timing of<br>
the sinker at this stage is relatively longer).<br>
At the second step, as shown in Figure 5B, the<br>
knitting needle 1A is moved downwards to the yarn<br>
hooking position, the inner pile sinker 2 and the outer pile<br>
sinker 1 are moved back, enabling the yarns to be released<br>
from the throat 22 of the inner pile sinker 2 and the nose<br>
13 and throat 12 of the outer pile sinker 1, therefore the<br>
pile loop is allowed to be slipped in. The inner pile 9<br>
slides in the nose 23 of the inner pile sinker 2. The outer<br>
pile 8 slides through the throat 12 of the outer pile sinker<br>
1 into the sinker slot, and the slides out of the sinker slot.<br>
At the third step, as shown in Figure 5C, the<br>
timing at this stage is for allowing the pile loop to be<br>
positively positioned in position. At this stage, the<br>
knitting needle is remained in the half stitch position, the<br>
latch 2A is suspended at an elevation about 0.5mm below<br>
the belly 11 of the outer pile sinker 1, the outer pile sinker<br>
1 and the inner pile sinker 2 are moved forwards to the<br>
tuck position, enabling the hook of the knitting needle to<br>
be hooked on the inner pile 9, the ground yarn to be<br>
moved in between the nose 13 of the outer pile sinker 1<br>
and the throat 22 of the inner pile sinker 2, and the outer<br>
pile 8 to be set into the throat 12 of the outer pile sinker 1.<br>
At the fourth step, as shown in Figure 5D, the<br>
outer pile sinker 1 is moved forwards to form an outer pile<br>
loop, then the computer gives a signal to the selector 5,<br>
causing the corresponding selector lever 51 to be or not to<br>
be pressed on the selection jack 4, so that the inner pile 9<br>
is decided to be knitted into a pile loop, or non-pile<br>
pattern. When making a pile loop (see Figures 5E and<br>
5F), the selector lever 51 does not touch the protruding<br>
portion 41 of the selection jack 4, the butt 42 of the<br>
selection jack 4 is moved forwards along the actuating<br>
portion 61 of the cam 6, enabling the yarn to be pulled by<br>
the bottom knitting needle to form a pile loop. When<br>
making a non-pile pattern (see Figures 5G and 5H), the<br>
selector lever 51 is pressed on the protruding portion 41<br>
of the selection jack 4, causing the reset mechanism 7 to<br>
be compressed against the cylinder wall 101 of the sinker<br>
cylinder. Therefore, the butt 42 of the selection jack 4 is<br>
moved over the actuating portion 61 of the cam 6,<br>
preventing the inner pile sinker 2 and the bottom knitting<br>
needle from making a pile loop. At this stage, only the<br>
ground yarn 10 is shown, and no pile loop is presented.<br>
The selection jack 4 is pushed out of the needle cylinder<br>
by the reset mechanism 7 before next knitting cycle.<br>
At the fifth step, as shown in Figure 51, the inner<br>
pile 9 is pushed out of the actuating portion 61 of the cam<br>
6, and pulled by the bottom knitting needle 1A to form a<br>
pile loop. At the fourth step, pile loop or non-pile<br>
pattern knitting operation has been decided. At the fifth<br>
step, the bottom knitting needle 1A is driven to hook<br>
down the loop. The yarn loop is fed to the throat 12 of<br>
the outer pile sinker 1, and the outer pile 8 is slightly<br>
released a certain length of time after the sinker has been<br>
pushed out, enabling the bottom knitting needle 1A to<br>
hook down the loop.<br>
At the sixth step, as shown in Figure 5J, the<br>
bottom knitting needle 1A pulls down the loop, the inner<br>
pile 9, the outer pile 8 and the ground yarn 10 are shown.<br>
If the inner pile sinker 2 is pressed in, the sinker cannot<br>
be pushed out, no pile loop is produced at this time, and<br>
only the ground yarn is seen.<br>
At the seventh step, as shown in Figures 4A and 4B,<br>
the bottom knitting needle 1A completes a loop and ready<br>
for a next knitting cycle, and at the same time the inner<br>
pile sinker 2 and the outer pile sinker 1 are pushed<br>
forwards to hold down the old loop.<br>
As indicated above, the selection jack 4 is pivoted<br>
to the inner pile sinker 2, and controlled by the selector 5<br>
to match with the push cam 6, so that the inner pile is<br>
knitted to form a pile loop or non-pile pattern during a<br>
double-loop towel knitting operation.<br>
