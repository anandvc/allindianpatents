FIELD OF THE INVENTION a<br>
This invention relates to/method for producing l-menthol which is used as a medicament or perftime and of its intermediate pulegone.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
There are some reports on the hydrogenation reaction into pulegone from piperitenone which can be easily synthesized from mesityl oxide and methyl vinyl ketone. There are an example 1) reported by J. Solodar et al.   in J. Org.   Chem.,   vol. 43, p. 1787, 1978, in which the hydrogenation is carried out using a Rh complex which uses cyclohexylanisylmethylphosphine as the ligand and an example 2) reported by P.L. Maux et al.   in Tetrahedron, vol. 44, p. 1409, 1988, in which the hydrogenation is carried out using a diphenylneomenthylphosphine-Co complex.<br>
Regarding reports on pulegol from pulegone, there is an example described by T. Ohkuma et al.   in Synlett,   p. 467, 1997, in which a catalyst system of (S)-BINAP-Ru-(S,S)-diphenylethylenediamine-KOH is used.<br>
Regarding the synthesis of pulegone, the method 1) can synthesize it with a selectivity of about 90% but its optical purity is a low value of 33% ee, and DMF (dimethylformamide) is used in the reaction solvent, so that this method is not industrially applicable. Also, the<br><br><br>
method 2) can synthesize it only with a selectivity of 55% and an optical purity of 15% ee, so that they are not industrially applicable levels.<br>
In addition, the ligand to be used in the synthesis of pulegol is a combination of (S)-BINAP and (S,S)-diphenylethylenediamine, and since optically active substances are used for both of them, this method has a problem of high cata cost.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention contemplates solving the illustrative problems shown in the following items 1) to 3).<br>
1)    Since there are three positions in piperitenone where hydrogenaticn can be effected, it is necessary for obtaining pulegone to increase position selectivity of hydrogenation.  That is, it is necessary to select a catalyst, namely a ligand and a transition metal, which can attain superior selectivity and optical yield to those of conventionally used ligands including a monodentate phosphine such as cyclohexylanisylmethylphosphine, phenylanisylmethylphosphine or cyclohexyl-o-tert-butylphenylmethylphosphine and a bidentate phosphine such<br>
»<br>
as DIPAMP: .1,2-bds[(o-methoxyphenyl)phenylphosphino]ethane or DIOP: 2,3-o-isopropylidene-2,3-dihydroxy-l,4-bis-(diphenylphosphino)butane, and to examine solvent systems and additives which exert influences thereon.<br><br>
2)	Regarding preparation of pulegol from pulegone,<br>
significant result is obtained by a prior art ruthenivun-<br>
diamine-potassium hydroxide system, so that it is expected<br>
to obtain equivalent catalytic activity and selectivity by<br>
changing it to an inexpensive catalyst.<br>
3)	The method to obtain menthol by hydrogenating<br>
pulegol can be carried out using a heterogeneous<br>
hydrogenation.catalyst but concern has been directed<br>
toward the development of a catalyst system having more<br>
higher selectivity.<br>

According to the invention, the 2-position olefin of piperitenone is hydrogenated with a complex consisting of<br><br>
the optically active phosphine represented by the general formula (2), (3) or (4) and a transition metal, and the desirable catalyst to be used in this hydrogenation is a transition metal complex consisting of an optically active phosphine containing a transition metal selected from rhodixim, iridium and ruthenium and a transition metal. Most desirably, the hydrogenation is carried out by further a.dd±T^  an asanonium salt, a phosphonium salt or an alkali metal salt to such a complex consisting of an optically active phosphine and a transition metal.<br>
Since each of these tertiary phosphines exists in (+)- and (-)-isomer forms, one of them is selected in response to the absolute configuration of pulegone of the intended optically active compound.  That is, (S)-isomer is used for obtaining (IR) isomer, and (R)-isomer is used for obtaining (IS) isomer. Rhodium complex:<br>
As an illustrative example of the production method of a rhodium complex, it can be synthesized by allowing bis(cycloocta-1,5-diene)rhodium(I) tetrafluoroborate to react with an optically active bidentate phosphine (L) in accordance with the method described on pages 339 to 344 of Jikken-Kagaku-Kouza   4th Edition,   Vol. 18, Organic Metal Complex, 1991, edited by The Chemical Society of Japan, published by Maruzen.

Since ethyl acetate (EtOAc) is excellent in both selectivity and optical yield as the solvent in the presence of a "complex consisting of an optically active phosphine and a transitionmetal" selected from rhodium, iridiiam and ruthenium, a system in which the selectivity becomes high in the EtOAc solvent was established liy a simple screening test.

As the third hydrogenation, the most high selectivity was obtained when the pulegol (6) was hydrogenated using a ruthenium dicarboxylate complex.  Though other reaction conditions are not different from those of general hydrogenation, the reaction is carried out at a reaction temperature of from 20 to 100°C for a reaction period of from 5 to 2,0 hours under an hydrogen pressure of from 5 to 50 kg/cm^ (0.5 to 5 MPa), without solvent or in a solvent such as toluene, ethyl acetate, methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, methylene chloride or tetrahydrofuran.<br><br><br>
By the method found by the invention in which piperitenone is hydrogenated by an optically active phosphine ligand and a transition metal complex, it become possible to produce pulegone with high position selectivity and also with high optical yield.  In addition, 1-menthol can be produced by carrying out selective hydrogenation of pulegone with a ruthenium-phosphine-amine complex in the presence of base to obtain pukegol and then hydrogenationg it with a transition metal catalyst.  That is, there provided a method for producing 1-menthol by an inexpensive method with high yield, by repeating hydrogenation reaction there times.<br>
