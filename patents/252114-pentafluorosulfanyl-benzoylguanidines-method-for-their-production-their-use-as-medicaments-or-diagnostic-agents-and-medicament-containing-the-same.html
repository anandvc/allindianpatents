Pentafluorosulfanyl benzoylguanidines, method for their production, their use as medicaments or diagnostic agents and medicament containing the same<br>
Pentafluorosulfanylbenzoylguanidines of the formula I<br><br>
in which R1 to R4 have the meanings indicated in the claims, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are substituted acylguanidines<br>
and inhibit the cellular sodium-proton antiporter (Na /H   exchanger, NHE).<br>
Because of the NHE-inhibitory properties, the compounds of the formula I and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are suitable for the prevention and treatment of diseases caused by activation or activated NHE, and of diseases caused secondarily by the NHE-related damage.<br>
Compared with known compounds, the compounds of the invention are distinguished by an extremely high activity in the inhibition of Na /H<br>
exchange, and by improved ADMET properties. The xenobiotic structure (in particular the introduction of the rather "unnatural/manmade" SF5 substituents) advantageously influences tissue distribution. This leads inter alia to increased exposures in vivo. This involves no significant influence on the absorption characteristics, and the high bioavailability of the acylguanidines is retained.<br>
In contrast to some acylguanidines described in the literature, the compounds of the formula I described herein and their pharmaceutically<br><br>
acceptable salts show no unwanted and disadvantageous saliduretic properties.<br>

In a further embodiment, preference is given to compounds of the formulae I in which R4 is described by hydrogen and F, with particular preference for compounds in which R4 is described by hydrogen.<br>
In a further embodiment, preference is given to compounds of the formula I in which p, t, a and dd are, independently of one another, 1.<br><br>
If the substituents R1 to R4 contain one or more centers of asymmetry, these may independently of one another have both the S and the R configuration. The compounds may be in the form of optical isomers, of diastereomers, of racemates or of mixtures thereof.<br>
The present invention encompasses all tautomeric forms of the compounds of the formula I.<br>
Alkyl radicals may be straight-chain or branched. This also applies if they carry substituents or occur as substituents of other radicals, for example in fluoroalkyl radicals or alkoxy radicals. Examples of alkyl radicals are methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl (= 1-methylethyl), n-butyl, isobutyl (= 2-methylpropyl), sec-butyl (= 1-methylpropyl), tert-butyl (= 1,1-dimethylethyl), n-pentyl, isopentyl, tert-pentyl, neopentyl and hexyl. Preferred alkyl radicals are methyl, ethyl, n-propyl and isopropyl. One or more, for example 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, hydrogen atoms in alkyl radicals may be replaced by fluorine atoms. Examples of such fluoroalkyl radicals are trifluoromethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl and pentafluoroethyl. Substituted alkyl radicals may be substituted in any positions. Examples of cycloalkyl radicals are cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl or cyclooctyl. One or more, for example 1, 2, 3 or 4, hydrogen atoms in cycloalkyl radicals may be replaced by fluorine atoms. Substituted cycloalkyl radicals may be substituted in any positions.<br>
Phenyl radicals may be unsubstituted or be substituted one or more times, for example once, twice or three times, by identical or different radicals. If a phenyl radical is substituted, it preferably has one or two identical or different substituents. This likewise applies to substituted phenyl radicals in groups such as, for example, phenylalkyl or phenyloxy. The substituent in monosubstituted phenyl radicals may be in position 2, position 3 or position 4.

Heteroaryl radicals are aromatic ring compounds in which one or more ring atoms are oxygen atoms, sulfur atoms or nitrogen atoms, e.g. 1, 2 or 3 nitrogen atoms, 1 or 2 oxygen atoms, 1 or 2 sulfur atoms or a combination of various heteroatoms. The heteroaryl radicals may be attached by all positions, for example by the 1 position, 2 position, 3 position, 4 position, 5 position, 6 position, 7 position or 8 position. Heteroaryl radicals may be unsubstituted or be substituted one or more times, for example once, twice or three times, by identical or different radicals. This applies likewise to heteroaryl radicals such as, for example, in the radical heteroarylalkyl. Examples of heteroaryl arefuranyl, thienyl, pyrrolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, pyridyl, pyrazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyridazinyl, indolyl, indazolyl, quinolyl, isoquinolyl, phthalazinyl, quinoxalinyl, quinazolinyl and cinnolinyl.<br>

The invention further relates to a process for preparing the compounds of the formula I which comprises reacting a compound of the formula II<br><br>
in which R1 to R4 have the stated meaning, and L is a leaving group which can undergo nucleophilic substitution, with guanidine.<br>
The activated acid derivatives of the formula II in which L is an alkoxy, preferably a methoxy, group, a phenoxy group, phenylthio, methylthio, 2-pyridylthio group, a nitrogen heterocycle, preferably 1-imidazolyl, are advantageously obtained in a manner known to those skilled in the art from the underlying carbonyl chlorides (formula II; L = Cl), which in turn can themselves be prepared in a known manner from the underlying carboxylic acids (formula II; L = OH), for example using thionyl chloride. Besides the carbonyl chlorides of the formula II (L = Cl) it is also possible to prepare other activated acid derivatives of the formula II in a known manner directly from the underlying benzoic acids (formula II; L = OH), such as the<br>
methyl esters of the formula II with L = OCH3 by treatment with gaseous<br>
HCI in methanol, the imidazolides of the formula II by treatment with carbonyldiimidazole, the mixed anhydrides of the formula II by treatment<br>
with CI-COOC2H5 ortosyl chloride in the presence of triethylamine in an<br>
inert solvent, and activations of benzoic acids with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC)orwith O-[(cyano(ethoxycarbonyl)-methylene)amino]-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate ("TOTU") are also possible. A number of suitable methods for preparing activated carboxylic acid derivatives of the formula II are indicated in J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, third edition (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1985, page 350), indicating source literature.<br><br>
Reaction of an activated carboxylic acid derivative of the formula II with guanidine preferably takes place in a known manner in a protic or aprotic polar but inert organic solvent. Those which have proved suitable for the<br>
reaction of the methyl benzoates (formula II; L = OCH3) with guanidine are<br>
methanol, isopropanol or THF at temperatures from 20°C to the boiling point of these solvents. Most reactions of compounds of the formula II with salt-free guanidine are, for example, carried out in aprotic inert solvents such as THF, dimethoxyethane, dioxane. However, it is also possible to use water in the presence of a base such as, for example, NaOH as solvent in the reaction of compounds of the formula II with guanidine.<br>
If L is Cl, it is advantageous to add an acid scavenger, for example in the form of excess guanidine, to bind the hydrohalic acid.<br>
The compounds of the formula II can be prepared as follows, by<br><br><br>
a)	reducing a 4-nitrophenylsulfur pentafluoricle derivative of the formula HI<br>
to the amine of the formula IV,<br>
b)	halogenating the compound of the formula IV in the ortho position to the<br>
amino group with a halogenating agent to give the compound of the<br>
formula V,<br>
c)	replacing the halogen substituent in the compound of the formula V with<br>
a suitable nucleophile or an organoelement compound, for example an<br>
alkylboron compound, where appropriate with catalysis, by a substituent R1<br>
and<br>
d)	replacing the amino function in the compound of the formula VI by a<br>
halogen substituent,<br><br>
e)	replacing the halogen substituent in the compound of the formula VII by<br>
a nitrile function,<br>
f)	hyclrolyzing the nitrile function of the compound of the formula VIII to the<br>
carboxylicacid,<br>
g)	nitrating the compound of the formula IX in the ortho position to the<br>
pentafluorosulfanyl group to give the compound of the formula X,<br>
h) reducing the nitro compound of the formula X to the aniline,<br>
i) replacing the amino function in the compound of the formula XI by R3<br>
using a suitable nucleophile<br>
and<br>
k) converting the compound of the formula XII into the compound of the<br>
formula II, where in the compounds of the formulae II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII,<br>
IX, X, XI and XII<br>
R1 to R4 are defined as in formula I<br>
L is defined as in formula II and<br>
X and Y are, independently of one another, F, Cl, Br or I.<br>
The procedure for preparing the compounds of the formula II is initially in step a to convert the compounds of the formula III by methods known in principle for the reduction of aromatic nitro compounds to aromatic amines into compounds of the formula IV.

The reaction time is generally from 10 min to 20 h, depending on the composition of the mixture and the chosen temperature range. The resulting reaction mixture can be worked up by subsequent filtration through a layer of silica gel, washing with organic solvent A and, after removal of the solvent in vacuo, purifying the product by conventional purification methods such as recrystallization, distillation or chromatography. From 0.1 to 10 mol of the compound of the formula IV for example are<br><br>
dissolved in 1000 ml of organic solvent A. For example, from 0.8 to 1.2 equivalents of the halogenating agent are used for 1 mol of the compound of the formula IV to be halogenated.<br>

It is possible in this case to add a base A and to add a catalyzing metal salt A.<br>
The reaction temperature in this case is generally between -20°C and +150°C, preferably between 30°C and 100°C. The reaction time is generally from 0.5 h to 20 h, depending on the composition of the mixture and the chosen temperature range. The resulting reaction mixture can be<br><br>
worked up by subsequent filtration through a layer of silica gel, washing with an organic solvent B and, after removal of the solvent in vacuo, purifying the product by conventional purification processes such as recrystallization, chromatography, for example on silica gel, distillation or steam distillation.<br>
From 0.1 to 10 mol of the compound of the formula V for example are dissolved in 1000 ml of organic solvent B. For example, from 0.8 to 3 equivalents of the nucleophile R1~ or of the element compound comprising<br>
the substituent R1 are used for 1 mol of the starting compound of the<br>
formula V.<br>
The term "nucleophile R1 " means compounds which result on<br>
deprotonation of a compound R1-H with strong bases such as, for example, alkyl- or aryllithium compounds, organomagnesium compounds, alcoholates or lithium diisopropylamide.<br>

R1-boronic anhydrides such as, for example,<br>
or organozinc compounds R1-Zn-Z, with Z = Cl, Br, I.<br>
The term "base A" means bases like those used as auxiliary bases in<br>
cross-coupling reactions and mentioned for example in A. Suzuki et al.,<br>
Chem. Rev. 1995, 95, 2457-2483 or M. Lamaire et al., Chem. Rev. 2002,<br>

The term "organic solvent B" means protic or aprotic solvents such as<br>
diethyl ether, dimethoxyethane, THF, alcohols, water or mixtures thereof. In<br>
one embodiment, mixtures with water are preferred.<br><br>

Rev. 1995, 95, 2457-2483 or M. Lamaire et al., Chem. Rev. 2002, 102,1359-1469 or S.P. Stanforth, Tetrahedron 1998, 54, 263 or G.C. Fu et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001, 123, 10099 or G.C. Fu et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002, 124, 13662 and the literature cited therein in each case, including the added ligands such as Pd(OAc)2, PdCl2(dppf) or Pd2(dba)3.<br>
In step d, the compounds of the formula VI are subsequently converted into the compounds of the formula VII by a diazotization-halogenation process with a diazotizing-halogenating agent, for example with a diazotizing-brominating agent, as described for other aromatic amines to replace the amine function by a halogen function for example in M.B. Smith and J. March, March's Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure, Wiley, New York, 2001, 935-936 or R.C. Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations: A Guide to Functional Group Preparations, VCH Publishers, New York, Weinheim, 1999, 678-679 and the literature cited therein, for example by the Sandmeyer or Gattermann reaction. The process of M. Doyle et al., J. Org. Chem. 1977, 42, 2426 or of S. Oae et al., Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1980, 53,1065 is preferred.<br>
In step e, the compounds of the formula VII are reacted in a solvent C with a cyanidating agent, for example with addition of a catalyzing metal salt B. The reaction temperature is generally from 20°C to 200°C, preferably 80°C to 150°C. The reaction time is generally from 1 h to 20 h, depending on the composition of the mixture and the chosen temperature range. The resulting reaction mixtures can be filtered with suction through a layer of silica gel or kieseiguhr and the filtrate can be worked up by aqueous extraction. After evaporation of the solvent in vacuo, the compound of the formula VIII is purified by conventional purification processes such as recrystallization, chromatography on silica gel, distillation or steam distillation.<br>
From 0.1 to 10 mol of the compound of the formula VII for example are dissolved in 1000 ml of organic solvent C. For example, from 1 to 10 equivalents of the cyanidating agent are used for 1 mol of the compounds having the formula VII to be reacted.<br>
The term "cyanidating agent" means, for example, alkali metal cyanides or Zn(CN)2 either alone or mixed with metallic zinc, preferably in the form of<br><br>
zinc dust.<br>
The term "organic solvent C" preferably means aprotic polar solvents such<br>
as, for example, DMF, dimethylacetamicle, NMP, DMSO.<br>

those employed in Suzuki reactions and described for example in A. Suzuki<br>
et al.f Chem. Rev. 1995, 95, 2457-2483 or M. Lamaire et al.f Chem. Rev.<br>

the literature cited therein, for example PdCl2(dppf), Pd(OAc)2, Pd2(dba)3.<br>
The resulting compounds of the formula VIII are subsequently hydrolyzed in step f to the carboxylic acids of the formula IX, for example in the presence of a base. This can take place by processes known to the skilled worker for hydrolyzing aromatic nitrites, as described, for example, in R.C. Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations: A Guide to Functional Group Preparations, VCH Publishers, New York, Weinheim, 1999, 1986-1987 or M.B. Smith and J. March, March's Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure, Wiley, New York, 2001, 1179-1180 and the literature cited therein.<br>
In step g, compounds of the formula IX are nitrated with a nitrating agent as described, for example, in Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie 4th edition, Organo-Stickstoff-Verbindungen IV, part 1, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart 1992, pages 262-341.<br>
In step h, the nitro compounds of the formula X are converted into compounds of the formula XI by methods known in principle for reducing aromatic nitro compounds to aromatic amines. Such methods are described for example in: R.C. Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations: a Guide to Functional Group Preparations, VCH Publishers, New York, Weinheim, 1999, 821-828 and the literature cited therein.<br>
In step i, the anilines of the formula XI are converted by the diazotization -replacement route into the compounds of the formula XII with replacement of the amine group by R3. Such methods are known to the skilled worker and are described for example in Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie 4th edition, Organo-Stickstoff-Verbindungen I, part 2, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart 1990, pages 1087-1136 and the references cited therein.<br><br>
For example, an aniline of the formula XI can be converted by the diazotization-replacement route into a sulfochloride of the formula XII (R3 = SO2CI) as described, for example, in Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie 4th edition, Organo-Schwefel-Verbindungen, part 2, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart 1985, pages 1069-1070.<br>
In step k, the compounds of the formula XII are derivatized to the compounds of the formula II by methods known to the skilled worker and as described above.<br>
It is possible in this step for example for the sulfochlorides of the formula XII (R3 = SO2CI) to be converted initially into the corresponding sulfinic<br>
acids (as described for example in Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie 4th edition, Organo-Schwefel-Verbindungen, part 1, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart 1985, pages 620-621 and Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie, Schwefel-, Selen-, Tellur-Verbindungen, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart 1955, pages 304-309) and subsequently alkylated to give the methyl sulfone as described for example in Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie 4th edition, Organo-Schwefel-Verbindungen, part 2, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart 1985, pages 1145-1149. Simultaneous esterification of the carboxylic acid to the methyl ester takes place.<br>
Compounds of the formula I in which R1 is hydrogen are prepared by<br>
carrying out the synthesis without steps b and c.<br>
Compounds of the formula I in which R3 is NR9R10 are prepared by<br>
carrying out the synthesis without step i.<br>
Functional groups in the starting compounds may also be present in<br>
protected form or in the form of precursors, and then be converted into the<br>
desired groups in the compounds of the formula II prepared by the process<br>
described above. Corresponding protective group techniques are known to<br>
the skilled worker.<br>
It is likewise possible for appropriate functional groups to be derivatized by<br>
methods known to the skilled worker. For example, compounds in which R3<br>
is NH2 can be converted by reaction with appropriate alkyl halides or<br>
2,2,2-trifluoroethyl halides, for example methyl iodide, ethyl iodide or 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl iodide, into compounds in which R3 is NR9R10, where R9 and R10 are, independently of one another, hydrogen, alkyl having 1, 2, 3 or 4 carbon atoms or -CH2-CF3 and are not both simultaneously hydrogen.<br><br>
Pentafluorosulfanylbenzoylguanidines of the formula I are generally weak bases and are able to bind acids to form salts. Suitable acid addition salts are salts of all pharmaceutically acceptable acids, for example halides, in particular hydrochlorides, lactates, sulfates, citrates, tartrates, acetates, phosphates, methylsulfonates, p-toluenesulfonates.<br>
The compounds of the formula I are substituted acylguanidines and inhibit<br>
the cellular sodium-proton antiporter (Na+/H+ exchanger, NHE), in particular the subtype NHE-1.<br>
Because of the NHE-inhibitory properties, the compounds of the formula I and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are suitable for the prevention and treatment of diseases caused by activation of or by an activated NHE, and of diseases caused secondarily by the NHE-related damage.<br>
The compounds of the formula I may also be used for treating and preventing diseases by the NHE being only partially inhibited, for example by use of a low dosage.<br>
Since NHE inhibitors predominantly act via their effect on cellular pH regulation, they can generally be combined beneficially with other compounds which regulate the intracellular pH, with suitable combination partners being inhibitors of the carbonic anhydrase enzyme group, inhibitors of systems transporting bicarbonate ions, such as of the sodium bicarbonate cotransporter (NBC) or of the sodium-dependent chloride-bicarbonate exchanger (NCBE), and NHE inhibitors with inhibitory effect on other NHE subtypes, because it is possible through them to enhance or modulate the pharmacologically relevant pH-regulating effects of the NHE inhibitors described herein.<br>
The use of the compounds of the invention relates to the prevention and treatment of acute and chronic diseases in veterinary and human medicine.<br><br>
Thus, the NHE inhibitors of the invention are suitable for the treatment of diseases caused by ischemia and by reperfusion.<br>
The compounds described herein are suitable because of their pharmacological properties as antiarrhythmic medicaments. Owing to their cardioprotective component, the NHE inhibitors are outstandingly suitable for infarction prophylaxis and infarction treatment and for the treatment of angina pectoris, in which cases they also preventively inhibit or greatly reduce the pathophysiological processes associated with the development of ischemia-induced damage, in particular in the triggering of ischemia-induced cardiac arrhythmias. Because of their protective effects against pathological hypoxic and ischemic situations, the compounds of the formula I and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof used according to the invention can, because of inhibition of the<br>
cellular Na+/H+ exchange mechanism, be used as medicaments for the treatment of all acute or chronic ischemia-induced damage or diseases induced primarily or secondarily thereby.<br>
This also relates to their use as medicaments for surgical interventions. Thus, the compounds can be used during organ transplantations, it being possible to use the compounds both to protect the organs in the donor before and during the removal, to protect removed organs for example during treatment with or storage thereof in physiological bath liquids, and during transference to the recipient organism.<br>
The compounds of the invention are likewise valuable medicaments with a protective effect when performing angioplastic surgical interventions, for example on the heart as well as on peripheral organs and vessels.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be used when performing bypass operations, for example bypass operations on coronary vessels and in Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG).<br><br>
Depending on their activity with regard to ischemia-induced damage, the compounds of the invention I may similarly be used in resuscitation after a cardiac a rest.<br>
The compounds of the invention are of interest for medicaments for life-threatening arrhythmias. Ventricular fibrillation is terminated and the physiological sinus rhythm of the heart is restored.<br>
Since NHE1 inhibitors of human tissue and organs, especially the heart, protect effectively not only against damage caused by ischemia and reperfusion but also against the cytotoxic effect of medicaments like those used in particular in cancer therapy and the therapy of autoimmune diseases, combined administration with compounds of the formula I and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof is suitable for inhibiting the cytotoxic, especially cardiotoxic, side effects of said compounds. The reduction in the cytotoxic effects, especially the cardiotoxicity, resulting from comedication with NHE1 inhibitors makes it additionally possible to increase the dose of the cytotoxic therapeutic agents and/or to prolong the medication with such medicaments. The therapeutic benefits of such a cytotoxic therapy can be considerably increased by combination with NHE inhibitors.<br>
In addition, the NHE1 inhibitors of the invention of the formula I and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be used when there is heart-damaging overproduction of thyroid hormones, thyrotoxicosis, or on external supply of thyroid hormones. The compounds of the formula I and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are thus suitable for improving therapy with cardiotoxic medicaments.<br>
In accordance with their protective effect against ischemia-induced damage, the compounds of the invention are also suitable as medicaments for the treatment of ischemias of the nervous system, especially of the central nervous system, being suitable for example for the treatment of stroke or of cerebral edema.<br><br>
The compounds of the formula I and/or the pharmaceuticaliy acceptable salts thereof are also suitable for the therapy and prophylaxis of diseases and disorders induced by overexcitability of the central nervous system, in particular for the treatment of epileptic disorders, centrally induced clonic and tonic spasms, states of psychological depression, anxiety disorders and psychoses. In these cases it is possible to use the NHE inhibitors described herein alone or in combination with other substances with antiepileptic activity or antipsychotic active ingredients, or carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, for example with acetazolamide, and with other inhibitors of NHE or of the sodium-dependent chloride-bicarbonate exchanger (NCBE).<br>
The compounds used according to the invention of the formula I and/or the pharmaceuticaliy acceptable salts thereof are additionally likewise suitable for the treatment of types of shock such as, for example, of allergic, cardiogenic, hypovolemic and bacterial shock.<br>
The compounds of the formula I and/or the pharmaceuticaliy acceptable salts thereof can likewise be used for the prevention and treatment of thrombotic disorders because they, as NHE inhibitors, are able to inhibit platelet aggregation themselves. They are additionally able to inhibit or prevent the excessive release, occurring after ischemia and reperfusion, of mediators of inflammation and coagulation, especially of von Willebrand factor and of thrombogenic selectin proteins. It is thus possible to reduce and eliminate the pathogenic effect of significant thrombogenic factors. The NHE inhibitors of the present invention can therefore be combined with other anticoagulant and/or thrombolytic active ingredients such as, for example, recombinant or natural tissue plasminogen activator, streptokinase, urokinase, acetylsalicylic acid, thrombin antagonists, factor Xa antagonists, medicinal substances with fibrinolytic activity, thromboxane receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, factor Vila antagonists, clopidogrel, ticlopidine etc. Combined use of the present NHE inhibitors with NCBE inhibitors and/or with inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase such as, for example, with acetazolamide, is particularly beneficial.<br><br>
NHE1 inhibitors are additionally distinguished by a strong inhibitory effect on the proliferation of cells, for example fibroblast proliferation and the proliferation of smooth vascular muscle cells. The compounds of the formula I and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are therefore suitable as valuable therapeutic agents for diseases in which proliferation represents a primary or secondary cause, and can therefore be used as antiatherosclerotics, agents for chronic renal failure, cancers.<br>
It was possible to show that cell migration is inhibited by NHE inhibitors. The compounds of the formula I and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are therefore suitable as valuable therapeutic agents for dieases in which cell migration represents a primary or secondary cause, such as, for example, cancers with a pronounced tendency to metastasis.<br>
NHE1 inhibitors are further distinguished by a retardation or prevention of fibrotic disorders. Compounds of the formula I and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are thus suitable as agents for the treatment of cardiac fibroses, and of pulmonary fibrosis, hepatic fibrosis, renal fibrosis and other fibrotic disorders. They can thus be used for the treatment of organ hypertrophies and hyperplasias, for example of the heart and the prostate. They are therefore suitable for the prevention and treatment of heart failure (congestive heart failure = CHF) and for the treatment and prevention of prostate hyperplasia or prostate hypertrophy.<br>
Since there is significant elevation in NHE in essential hypertensives, the compounds of the formula I and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are suitable for the prevention and treatment of high blood pressure and for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders. In these cases they can be used alone or with a suitable combination and formulation partner for the treatment of high blood pressure and for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders. Thus, for example, one or more diuretics with a thiazide-like action, loop diuretics, aldosterone and pseudoaldosterone antagonists, such as hydrochlorothiazide, indapamide, polythiazide,<br><br>
furosemide, piretanide, torasemide, bumetanide, amiloride, triamterene, spironoiactone or eplerone, can be combined. The NHE inhibitors of the present invention can further be used in combination with calcium channel blockers such as verapamii, diltiazem, amlodipine or nifedipine, and with ACE inhibitors such as, for example, ramipril, enalapril, lisinopril, fosinopril or captopril. Further beneficial combination partners are also beta-blockers such as metoprolol, albuterol etc., antagonists of the angiotensin receptor and its receptor subtypes such as losartan, irbesartan, valsartan, omapatrilat, gemopatrilat, endothelin antagonists, renin inhibitors, adenosine receptor agonists, inhibitors and activators of potassium channels such as glibenclamide, glimepiride, diazoxide, cromakalim, minoxidil and derivatives thereof, activators of the mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channel (mitoK(ATP) channel), inhibitors of Kv1.5 etc.<br>
It has emerged that NHE1 inhibitors have a significant antiinflammatory effect and can thus be used as antiinflammatory drugs. Inhibition of the release of mediators of inflammation is noteworthy in this connection. The compounds can thus be used alone or in combination with an antiinflammatory drug for the prevention or treatment of chronic and acute inflammatory disorders. Combination partners advantageously used are steroidal and non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs. The compounds of the invention can additionally be employed for the prevention or treatment of disorders caused by protozoa, such as malaria and coccidiosis in poultry.<br>
It has additionally been found that NHE1 inhibitors show a beneficial effect on serum lipoproteins. It is generally acknowledged that blood fat levels which are too high, called hyperlipoproteinemias, represent an essential risk factor for the development of arteriosclerotic vascular lesions, especially coronary heart disease. The reduction of elevated serum lipoproteins therefore has exceptional importance for the prophylaxis and regression of atherosclerotic lesions. Besides the reduction in total serum cholesterol, it is particularly important to reduce the proportion of specific atherogenic lipid fractions of this total cholesterol, in particular of the low density lipoproteins (LDL) and of the very low density lipoproteins (VLDL),<br><br>
because these lipicl fractions represent an atherogenic risk factor. By contrast, a protective function against coronary heart disease is ascribed to the high density lipoproteins. Accordingly, hypolipidemics should be able to reduce not only total cholesterol but, in particular, the VLDL and LDL serum cholesterol fractions. It has now been found that NHE1 inhibitors show valuable therapeuticaily utilizable properties in relation to influencing the serum lipid levels. Thus, they significantly reduce the elevated serum concentrations of LDL and VLDL as are to be observed, for example, due to increased dietary intake of a cholesterol- and lipid-rich diet or in cases of pathological metabolic alterations, for example genetically related hyperlipidemias. They can therefore be used for the prophylaxis and regression of atherosclerotic lesions by eliminating a causal risk factor. Included herein are not only the primary hyperlipidemias but also certain secondary hyperlipidemias occurring, for example, in association with diabetes. In addition, the NHE1 inhibitors lead to a marked reduction in the infarctions induced by metabolic abnormalities and, in particular, to a significant reduction in the induced infarct size and the severity thereof. The compounds of the formula I and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are therefore advantageously used for producing a medicament for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia; for producing a medicament for the prevention of atherogenesis; for producing a medicament for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis, for producing a medicament for the prevention and treatment of diseases induced by elevated cholesterol levels, for producing a medicament for the prevention and treatment of diseases induced by endothelial dysfunction, for producing a medicament for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis-induced hypertension, for producing a medicament for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis-induced thromboses, for producing a medicament for the prevention and treatment of hypercholesterolemia-induced and endothelial dysfunction-induced ischemic damage and post-ischemic reperfusion damage, for producing a medicament for the prevention and treatment of hypercholesterolemia-induced and endothelial dysfunction-induced cardiac hypertrophies and cardiomyopathies and of congestive heart failure (CHF), for producing a<br><br>
medicament for the prevention and treatment of hypercholesterolemia-incluced and endothelial dysfunction-induced coronary vasospasms and myocardial infarctions, for producing a medicament for the treatment of said disorders in combinations with hypotensive substances, preferably with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists. A combination of an NHE inhibitor of the formula I and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof with an active ingredient lowering the blood fat levels, preferably with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (for example lovastatin or pravastatin), the latter bringing about a hypolipidemic effect and thus increasing the hypolipidemic properties of the NHE inhibitor of the formula I and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, proves to be a favorable combination with enhanced effect and reduced use of active ingredients. Thus, compounds of the formula I and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof lead to effective protection against endothelial damage of various origins. This protection of the vessels against the syndrome of endothelial dysfunction means that the compounds of the formula I and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are valuable medicaments for the prevention and treatment of coronary vasospasms, peripheral vascular diseases, in particular intermittent claudication, atherogenesis and atherosclerosis, left ventricular hypertrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy and thrombotic disorders.<br>
It has additionally been found that NHE1 inhibitors are suitable in the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM), with the insulin resistance being restrained. It may in this connection be beneficial, to enhance the antidiabetic activity and quality of the effect of the compounds of the invention, to combine them with a biguanide such as metformin, with an antidiabetic sulfonylurea such as glyburide, glimepiride, tolbutamide etc., with a glucosidase inhibitor, with a PPAR agonist such as rosiglitazone, pioglitazone etc., with an insulin product of different administration form, with a DB4 inhibitor, with an insulin sensitizor or with meglitinide.<br><br>
Besides the acute antidiabetic effects, the compounds of the formula I and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof counteract the development of late complications of diabetes and can therefore be used as medicaments for the prevention and treatment of late damage from diabetes, such as diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic cardiomyopathy and other disorders occurring as a consequence of diabetes. They can in this connection be advantageously combined with the antidiabetic medicaments just described under NIDDM treatment. The combination with a beneficial dosage form of insulin should be particularly important in this connection.<br>
NHE1 inhibitors show, besides the protective effects against acute ischemic events and the subsequent equally acutely stressing reperfusion events, also direct therapeutically utilizable effects against diseases and disorders of the entire mammalian organism which are associated with the manifestations of the chronically progressive aging process and which occur independently of acute hypoperfusion states and under normal, non-ischemic conditions. These pathological, age-related manifestations induced over the long aging period, such as illness, invalidity and death, which can now be made amenable to treatment with NHE inhibitors, are diseases and disorders which are essentially caused by age-related changes in vital organs and the function thereof and become increasingly important in the aging organism.<br>
Disorders connected with an age-related functional impairment or with age-related manifestations of wear of organs are, for example, the inadequate response and reactivity of the blood vessels to contraction and relaxation reactions. This age-related decline in the reactivity of vessels to constricting and relaxing stimuli, which are an essential process of the cardiovascular system and thus of life and health, can be significantly eliminated or reduced by NHE inhibitors. One important function and a measure of the maintenance of the reactivity of vessels is the blockade or retardation of the age-related progression in endothelial dysfunction, which can be eliminated highly significantly by NHE inhibitors. The compounds of the formula I and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are thus outstandingly<br><br>
suitable for the treatment and prevention of the age-related progression in endothelial dysfunction, especially of intermittent claudication.<br>
An example of another variable characterizing the aging process is the decline in the contractability of the heart and the decline in the adaptation of the heart to a required pumping output of the heart. This diminished efficiency of the heart as a consequence of the aging process is in most cases connected with a dysfunction of the heart which is caused inter alia by deposition of connective tissue in the myocardial tissue. This deposition of connective tissue is characterized by an increase in the weight of the heart, by an enlargement of the heart and by restrictive cardiac function. It was surprising that it was possible almost completely to inhibit such aging of the heart organ. The compounds of the formula I and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are thus outstandingly suitable for the treatment and prevention of heart failure, of congestive heart failure (CHF).<br>
Not only is it possible to cure a cancer which has already occurred through inhibition of proliferation, but there is also reduction and highly significant retardation of the age-related incidence of cancer through NHE inhibitors. A particularly noteworthy finding is that the disorders, occurring as a result of aging, of all organs and not only certain types of cancer are suppressed or occur with a highly significant delay. The compounds of the formula I and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are thus suitable for the treatment and, in particular, the prevention of age-related types of cancer.<br>
With NHE inhibitors, a delay, shifted highly significantly in time is found in the occurrence of age-related disorders of all the organs investigated, including the heart, vessels, liver etc., and a highly significant delay in cancer of the elderly. On the contrary, there is also surprisingly a prolongation of life to an extent which has to date been achievable by no other group of medicaments or by any natural products. This unique effect of NHE inhibitors also makes it possible, besides the use of the active ingredients alone on humans and animals, to combine these NHE inhibitors<br><br>
with other active principles, measures, substances and natural products which are used in gerontology and which are based on a different mechanism of action. Such classes of active ingredients used in gerontological therapy are: in particular vitamins and substances with antioxidant activity. Since there is a correlation between caloric load or food intake and the aging process, the combination with dietary measures can take place for example with appetite suppressants. It is likewise possible to consider a combination with hypotensive medicaments such as with ACE inhiibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists, diuretics, Ca+2 antagonists etc. or with metabolism-normalizing medicaments such as cholesterol-lowering agents.<br>
The compounds of the formula I and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are thus outstandingly suitable for the prevention of age-related tissue changes and for prolonging life while retaining a high quality of life.<br>
The compounds of the invention are effective inhibitors of the cellular sodium-proton antiporter (Na/H exchanger) which in a large number of disorders (essential hypertension, atherosclerosis, diabetes etc.) is also increased in cells which are readily amenable to measurements, such as, for example, in erythrocytes, platelets or leucocytes. The compounds used according to the invention are therefore suitable as outstanding and simple scientific tools, for example in their use as diagnostic agents for determining and distinguishing different types of hypertension, but also of atherosclerosis, diabetes and the late complications of diabetes, proliferative disorders etc.<br>
Also claimed is a medicine for human, veterinary or phytoprotective use, comprising an effective amount of a compound of the formula I and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, together with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and additives, alone or in combination with other active pharmaceutical ingredients or medicaments.<br>
Medicaments which comprise a compound of the formula I and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can in this connection be<br><br>
administered, for example, orally, parenterally, intravenously, rectally, transdermally or by inhalation, the preferred administration being dependent on the particular characteristics of the disorder. The compounds of the formula I may moreover be used alone or together with pharmaceutical excipients, both in veterinary medicine and in human medicine. The medicaments generally comprise active ingredients of the formula I and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof in an amount of from 0.01 mg to 1 g per dose unit.<br>
The excipients suitable for the desired pharmaceutical formulation are familiar to the skilled worker on the basis of his expert knowledge. Besides solvents, gel formers, suppository bases, tablet excipients, and other active ingredient carriers, it is possible to use, for example, antioxidants, dispersants, emulsifiers, antifoams, flavorings, preservatives, solubilizers or colors.<br>
For a form for oral administration, the active compounds are mixed with additives suitable for this purpose, such as carriers, stabilizers or inert diluents, and converted by conventional methods into suitable dosage forms such as tablets, coated tablets, hard gelatin capsules, aqueous, alcoholic or oily solutions. Examples of inert carriers which can be used are gum arabic, magnesia, magnesium carbonate, potassium phosphate, lactose, glucose or starch, especially corn starch. It is moreover possible for the preparation to take place both as dry granules and as wet granules. Examples of suitable oily carriers or solvents are vegetable or animal oils such as sunflower oil or fish liver oil.<br>
For subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous administration, the active compounds used are converted, if desired with the substances customary for this purpose, such as solubilizers, emulsifiers or other excipients, into a solution, suspension or emulsion. Examples of suitable solvents are: water, physiological saline or alcohols, e.g. ethanol, propanol, glycerol, as well as sugar solutions such as glucose or mannitol solutions, or else a mixture of the various solvents mentioned.<br><br>
Suitable as pharmaceutical formulation for administration in the form of aerosols or sprays are, for example, solutions, suspensions or emulsions of the active ingredient of the formula I and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof in a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent such as, in particular, ethanol or water, or a mixture of such solvents. The formulation may, if required, also contain other pharmaceutical excipients such as surfactants, emulsifiers and stabilizers, and a propellant gas. Such a preparation normally contains the active ingredient in a concentration of about 0.1 to 10, in particular of about 0.3 to 3% by weight.<br>
The dosage of the active ingredient of the formula I to be administered, and the frequency of administration, depend on the potency and duration of action of the compounds used; additionally also on the nature and severity of the disorder to be treated and on the sex, age, weight and individual responsiveness of the mammal to be treated.<br>
On average, the daily dose of a compound of the formula I and/or the pharmaceuticaily acceptable salts thereof for a patient weighing about 75 kg is at least 0.001 mg/kg, preferably 0.01 mg/kg, to a maximum of 10 mg/kg, preferably 1 mg/kg, of body weight. For acute episodes of the disorder, for example immediately after suffering a myocardial infarction, higher and, in particular, more frequent dosages may also be necessary, e.g. up to 4 single doses a day. Up to 700 mg a day may be necessary, in particular on i.v. administration, for example for a patient with infarction in the intensive care unit, and the compounds of the invention can be administered by infusion.<br>

cooling, 4-nitrophenylsulfur pentafluoride (584 g, 2.344 mol) was introduced in 8 portions over the course of 1 h. The internal temperature was kept below 100°C during this. Subsequently, the mixture was stirred at an internal temperature of 85°C for 1.5 h and then cooled to 45°C over the course of a further hour. A mixture of ice (12 kg), NaOH (2 kg) and dichloromethane (1.5 I) was prepared and the reaction mixture was added with vigorous stirring. The phases were separated, the aqueous phase was extracted 3 times with 1 I of dichloromethane each time, and the combined organic phases were dried over Na2SO4 and evaporated in vacuo. 510 g of 4-aminophenylsulfur pentafluoride were obtained as a pale yellow crystalline powder, m.p. 63-65°C<br>
b)	4-Amino-3-bromophenylsulfur pentafluoride<br><br>
4-Aminophenylsulfur pentafluoride (510 g, 2.327 mol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (7 I), the solution was cooled to 5°C and, while stirring, 1,3"dibromo-5,5-dimethylimidazolidine-2,4-dione (326 g, 1.14 mol) was introduced in several portions with ice cooling so that the internal temperature was kept at 3-8°C (approx. 1 h). The mixture was then left to stir and warm to room temperature without external cooling for 1 h. The mixture was filtered through a bed of silica gel (volume about 1 I) and washed with dichloromethane (5.5 I), and the filtrate was evaporated in vacuo. About 700 g of a red-brown crystalline mass was obtained and was dissolved in n-heptane (600 ml) at 60°C and then crystallized in a refrigerator at 4°C.

Determination of the NHE inhibition<br>
The inhibitory concentration IC50 for NHE-1 inhibition was determined as follows:<br>
IC50 for NHE-1 inhibition was determined in an FLIPR assay by measurement of the pHj recovery in transfected cell lines which express human NHE-1.<br>
The assay was carried out in an FLIPR (fluorometric imaging plate reader) with black-walled 96-well microtiter plates with clear bases. The transfected cell lines expressing the various NHE subtypes (the parental cell line LAP-1 shows no endogenous NHE activity as a result of mutagenesis and subsequent selection) were seeded the preceding day at a density of -25 000 cells/well.<br>
The growth medium for the transfected cells (Iscove +10% fetal calf serum) additionally contained G418 as selection antibiotic in order to ensure the presence of the transfected sequences.<br>
The actual assay started with the removal of the growth medium and addition of 100 nl of loading buffer per well (5 JJM BCECF-AM [2\7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5- (and -6-)carboxyfluorescein, acetoxymethyl ester] in<br>
20 mM NH4CI, 115 mM choline chloride, 1 mM MgCl2,1 mM CaCl2, 5 mM<br>
KCI, 20 mM HEPES, 5 mM glucose; pH 7.4 [adjusted with KOH]). The cells were then incubated at 37°C for 20 minutes. This incubation led to loading of the cells with the fluorescent dye whose fluorescence intensity depends<br>
on pHi, and with NH4CI which made the cells slightly alkaline.<br>
The nonfluorescent dye precursor BCECF-AM is, as ester, membrane-<br><br>
permeable. The actual dye BCECF is not membrane-permeable but is liberated inside cells by esterases.<br>
After this incubation for 20 minutes, the loading buffer which contained NH4CI and free BCECF-AM was removed by washing three times in a cell washer (Tecan Columbus) with in each case 400 pi of washing buffer (133.8 mM choline chloride, 4.7 mM KCI, 1.25 mM MgCI2, 1.25 mM CaCl2,<br>
0.97 mM K2HPO4, 0.23 mM KH2PO4, 5 mM HEPES, 5 mM glucose; pH<br>
7.4 [adjusted with KOH]). The residual volume which remained in the wells was 90 pi (50-125 pi possible). This washing step removed the free BCECF-AM and results, as a consequence of the removal of the external<br>
NH4+ ions, in intracellular acidification (- pHj 6.3 - 6.4). Since the equilibrium of intracellular NH4+ with NH3 and H+ was disturbed by the removal of the extracellular NH4+ and by the subsequent instantaneous passage of the NH3 through the cell membrane, the washing<br>
process resulted in H+ remaining inside the cells, which was the cause of<br>
the intracellular acidification. This may eventually lead to cell death if it<br>
persists long enough.<br>
It was important at this point that the washing buffer was sodium-free<br>
(
recovery of the pHj through the activity of the cloned NHE isoforms.<br>
It was likewise important for all the buffers used (loading buffer, washing buffer, recovery buffer) not to contain any HCO3" ions, because the<br>
presence of bicarbonate would lead to activation of interfering bicarbonate-dependent pHj regulatory systems present in the parental LAP-1 cell line.<br>
The microtiter plates with the acidified cells were then (up to 20 minutes after the acidification) transferred to the FLIPR. In the FLIPR, the intracellular fluorescent dye was excited by light with a wavelength of 488 nm generated by an argon laser, and the measured parameters (laser power, illumination time and aperture of the CCD camera incorporated in<br><br>
the FLIPR) were chosen so that the average fluorescence signal per well is between 30 000 and 35 000 relative fluorescence units.<br>
The actual measurement in the FLIPR started with a photograph being taken by the CCD camera every two seconds under software control. After ten seconds, the recovery of the intracellular pH was initiated by adding<br>
90 \s\ of recovery buffer (133.8 mM NaCI, 4.7 mM KCI, 1.25 mM MgCl2,<br>
1.25 mM CaCI2, 0.97 mM K2HPO4, 0.23 mM KH2PO4, 10 mM HEPES,<br>
5 mM glucose; pH 7.4 [adjusted with NaOH]) by means of the 96-well pipettor incorporated in the FLIPR.<br>
Positive control wells (100% NHE activity) were those to which pure recovery buffer is added, while negative controls (0% NHE activity) received washing buffer. Recovery buffer with twice the concentration of test substance was added to all the other wells. Measurement in the FLIPR terminated after 60 measurements (two minutes).<br>
The raw data are exported into the ActivityBase program. This program firstly calculates the NHE activities for each tested substance concentration<br>
and, from these, the IC50 values for the substances. Since the progress of pHj recovery was not linear throughout the experiment, but fell at the end<br>
owing to decreasing NHE activity at higher pHj values, it was important to<br>
select for evaluation of the measurement the part in which the increase in fluorescence of the positive controls was linear<br><br>
In vivo pharmacokinetics - profiling with the "n in one method"<br>
The exposure data and the volumes of distribution were determined as characteristic pharmacokinetic data as follows;<br><br>
The NHE-1 inhibitor of example 1 of the invention and, as reference substance, the known NHE-1 inhibitor cariporide with the formula<br><br>
were dissolved in an aqueous, slightly acidic medium (water, pH 4, adjusted with 1M hydrochloric acid). The concentration of the aqueous formulation prepared in this way was about 1.5 mg of each substance per 1 g of solution. 10 ml of this formulation were administered as a single bolus by catheter into the jugular vein of a fasting male beagle dog (dose about 1 mg of each substance administered per kg of the dog's body weight). Blood samples were taken by means of a second catheter after 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h and 24 h, and heparinized plasma was prepared by centrifugation at 1000 G in appropriate plasma tubes.<br>
The plasma samples were worked up and, after an HPLC separation, quantified by MS/MS. The high specificity of this method permitted simultaneous determination of a plurality of substances. The exposures could be calculated using the WinNonlin computer program from the concentration-time plots (see figure 1) and compared with the exposure of the known NHE-1 reference substance. Since the various substances were measured in the same animal at the same time, the result was an accurate comparison of the compounds, and a ranking of the volumes of distribution was possible.<br><br><br>
It is clearly evident from the concentration-time plots in figure 1 that the compound of the invention is retained in the blood also over a longer period and thus the exposure is about 2-3 times higher than with the reference substance cariporide. Cariporide is no longer detectable in the plasma after 24 hours.<br>
The captions and signs in the figure were as follows:<br>
