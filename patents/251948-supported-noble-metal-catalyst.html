				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a supported noble metal<br>
catalyst, a process for producing it and its use.<br>
Catalysts are used in chemical processes to increase the<br>
reaction rate. The catalyst reduces the activation energy<br><br>
and thus makes the reaction faster.<br>
The addition of additional auxiliaries to effect an<br>
additional increase in the activity is known for various<br>
reactions. The type of auxiliaries depends on the<br>
particular reaction. Thus, for example, the addition of<br>
acids to the reaction medium in hydrogenation in order to<br>
increase the selectivities and activities is known.<br>
This is known, for example, for the debenzylation of benzyl<br>
ethers and benzylamines or the selective hydrogenation of<br>
organic nitriles to amines.<br>
The debenzylation of benzyl ethers proceeds very tardily or<br>
is completely inhibited under neutral to basic conditions<br>
(H. Sajiki, Tetrahedron Letters 36, 1995, 3465). The<br>
addition of acid can accelerate the reaction.<br>
US patent 6,992,037 gives a general description of<br>
debenzylations under acid conditions in the presence of<br>
polar solvents, a low hydrogen pressure and relatively high<br>
temperatures. Typical reaction conditions are a reaction<br>
temperature in the range from 5°C to 100°C, a hydrogen<br>
pressure of from 1 to 10 bar and alcohols or acidic<br>
solvents.<br>
US patent 6,992,037 describes the production of palladium<br>
on activated carbon catalysts, in which sodium<br>
tetrachloropalladate is brought to a pH of 8 by means of<br>
sodium carbonate solution. This pH and the use of the<br>
relatively weak base sodium carbonate results in complete<br><br>
conversion of the palladium chloride into palladium<br>
hydroxide. However, no mention is made of the presence of<br>
palladium chloride, which is an important aspect of the<br>
present invention.<br>
It is also known from the literature that the type of<br>
catalyst has a strong influence on the debenzylation<br>
reaction (Studer, Martin; Blasser, Hans-Ulrich, Journal of<br>
Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical (1996), 112(3), 437-445).<br>
Accordingly, the following influences have a positive<br>
effect on the reaction rate and the selectivity of the<br>
debenzylation: oxidic palladium, shell distribution of the<br>
palladium on the support and high metal loading. Strong and<br>
weak acids are known as modifiers in order to increase the<br>
reaction rate of the debenzylation. Thus, 4-chloro-N,N-<br>
dibenzylaniline and 4-chloro-N-benzylaniline can be<br>
converted very quickly and selectively into 4-chloroaniline<br>
by addition of catalytic amounts of HC1 to the reaction<br>
mixture.<br>
The selective conversion of 4-chloro-N,N-dibenzylaniline<br>
into 4-chloroaniline preferably takes place at a pH of less<br>
than 4 (A. David, A. Vannice, NACS Philadelphia 2005 0-36).<br>
In the O-debenzylation of dibenzyl ether, hydrogenation is<br>
inhibited by addition of aqueous sodium hydroxide solution.<br>
On the other hand, addition of HC1 results in the inhibited<br>
reaction now taking place and proceeding to completion.<br>
In the hydrogenation of nitriles, the selectivity is<br>
influenced in a targeted manner by addition of acid (S.<br>
Nishimura, Handbook of Heterogeneous Catalytic<br>
Hydrogenation for Organic Synthesis, published by John<br>
Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 2001) .<br>
In these known processes, the acid, for example<br>
hydrochloric acid, has to be added to the reaction solution<br>
in each case.<br><br>
The production of Pd/C catalysts by impregnation of an<br>
activated carbon with palladium(II) chloride and subsequent<br>
reduction and washing-out of the HC1 formed in the<br>
reduction (process described by Mozingo) or by<br>
precipitation of palladium chloride as palladium hydroxide<br>
on the activated carbon (process described by Pearlman) is<br>
also known (S. Nishimura, Handbook of Heterogeneous<br>
Catalytic Hydrogenation for Organic Synthesis, published by<br>
John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 2001).<br>
Further known processes use a preneutralized palladium<br>
chloride solution which is subsequently applied to the<br>
activated carbon (US 3,804,779).<br>
Palladium colloids are formed during the preneutralization.<br>
A palladium-on-activated carbon catalyst which can be used<br>
for hydrogenolysis reactions is also known (EP 1 238 700<br>
Al) . An important aspect here is that all of the noble<br>
metal is present in the form of the hydroxides and oxides. <br>
When these catalysts are used in reactions involving<br>
hydrogen, the oxides and hydroxides are reduced to metallic<br>
palladium and water according to the following reaction<br>
equation:<br>
PdO + H2 -&gt; Pd° + H20<br>
Pd(OH)2 + H2 -&gt; Pd° + 2 H20<br>
No change in the pH occurs here.<br>
To increase the reaction rate, it is necessary to add an<br>
acid in the case of these known catalysts.<br>
The separate addition of inorganic acid to the reaction<br>
medium has the disadvantage that metering problems can<br>
occur. Furthermore, nonuniform distribution of the acid in<br>
the reaction medium can occur, so that it is not always<br>
possible to ensure that the reaction proceeds uniformly.<br><br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a catalyst<br>
which produces an acid while being used in a catalytic<br>
reaction.<br>
The invention provides a supported noble metal catalyst<br>
which is characterized in that palladium salts which are<br>
enveloped by colloids of palladium hydroxide/oxide and/or<br>
palladium hydroxide/oxide compounds have been applied to<br>
the support.<br>
The catalyst of the invention can have a pH of less than 3,<br>
in particular from 3 to 1.5, after reduction by means of<br><br>
 hydrogen.<br>
The invention further provides a process for producing the<br>
supported noble metal catalyst, which is characterized in<br>
that an aqueous noble metal salt solution is hydrolysed by<br>
addition of bases, the colloidal suspension formed is<br>
applied to a support and the support is filtered off.<br>
In the process of the invention, chloro-hydroxy-palladium<br>
colloids are produced in a targeted manner in the first<br>
step during the catalyst preparation. These colloids are<br>
then applied to the support in the second step. The chloro-<br>
hydroxy-palladium colloids produced according to the<br>
invention are insensitive to further hydrolysis of the<br>
palladium chloride.<br>
In the process of the invention, it is possible to use<br>
palladium or a mixture of palladium with other noble metals<br>
of group VIII as noble metal for producing chloro-hydroxo<br>
colloids of the noble metals of group VIII of the Periodic<br>
Table.<br>
Alkali metal and/or alkaline earth metal hydroxides can be<br>
used for producing the colloids.<br>
For the purposes of the invention, it is important to use<br>
strong bases, e.g. NaOH, which lead to incomplete<br><br>
hydrolysis of the palladium chloride. This is achieved by<br>
setting the pH during the hydrolysis to values of<br>
preferably below 7, particularly preferably below 6.<br>
The chloro-hydroxy-noble metal colloids obtained can be<br>
applied to a support.<br>
As support, it is possible to use all customary supports,<br>
in particular activated carbon, carbon black, carbon<br>
aerogel, carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibres, aluminium<br>
oxide, silicon dioxide, barium sulphate, calcium carbonate<br>
and/or titanium dioxide.<br>
The activated carbon can have been activated by means of<br>
steam, phosphoric acid, zinc chloride or in another way.<br>
 Furthermore, a subsequently modified activated carbon as<br>
described in US 6,992,037 or as described in WO 2006/133081<br>
 can be used.<br>
The catalysts of the invention can be used in catalytic<br>
reactions, in particular hydrogenations, in which the use<br>
of acid is beneficial.<br>
It has to be assumed that the chloro compounds in the<br>
interior of the colloids are protected by the envelope of<br>
hydroxo compounds, as illustrated in Figure 1. Under<br>
hydrogenation conditions, both the hydroxy-palladium<br>
complexes and the chloro-palladium complexes are reduced.<br>
This forms HC1, resulting in a decrease in the pH.<br>
Pd(OH) (Cl)+H2 -» Pd° + H20 + HCl<br>
PdCl2 + H2 -» Pd° + 2HC1<br>
The catalysts produced in this way generate an acid during<br>
the catalytic hydrogenation and bring about a significantly<br>
higher reaction rate for catalytic hydrogenations.<br>
The catalysts of the invention are particularly useful for<br><br>
the deprotection of benzyl ethers, benzylamines,<br>
dibenzylamines, benzyl alcohols, benzyl acetals, benzyl-<br>
protected amino acids and peptides, etc. The removal of<br>
other protective groups, e.g. N-benzyloxycarbonyl groups<br>
(Z or Cbz), 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc), etc., is<br>
also possible.<br>
A summary overview of protective groups which can be<br>
removed by means of the heterogeneous catalysts of the<br>
invention is given by the monograph by Kocienski<br>
(Protecting Groups, 3rd Edition, 2005, Georg Thieme Verlag<br>
Stuttgart).<br>
The protective groups are used in the organic synthesis of<br>
intermediates and end products for life science and fine<br>
chemicals. The production of pharmaceutical products,<br>
herbicides and insecticides, in particular, often requires<br>
the use of a protective group which has to be removed again<br>
during or at the end of the synthesis.<br><br>
Example 1:<br>
Unreduced palladium on activated carbon catalyst according<br>
to the invention<br>
Production of a solution of chloro-hydroxy-palladium<br>
colloid<br>
A solution comprising 500 ml of deionized water and 5.00 g<br>
of palladium as palladium(II) chloride was admixed with<br>
45 ml of a 10% strength sodium hydroxide solution at room<br>
temperature while stirring. The solution was stirred for a<br>
further 30 minutes. A pH of 6.0 was established.<br>
Fixing of the chloro-hydroxy-palladium colloids to an<br>
activated carbon support<br>
The chloro-hydroxy-palladium colloids formed are<br>
precipitated on the support by addition of this solution to<br>
a suspension of 95.0 g of commercially available activated<br>
carbon in 500 ml of deionized water. The suspension was<br>
subsequently heated to 80°C. The suspension was then<br>
filtered hot and subsequently washed with 1000 ml of<br>
deionized water.<br>
The unreduced catalyst obtained in this way had a palladium<br>
content of 5.0%. It has a pH of 3.7. After reduction with<br>
hydrogen, the catalyst has a pH of 2.3.<br>
Example 2:<br>
Reduced palladium on activated carbon catalyst (comparison)<br>
A reduced 5% palladium-on-activated carbon catalyst was<br>
produced by a method based on US patent 3,804,779 (Kent and<br>
Evans 1974) .<br>
A solution comprising 500 ml of deionized water and 5.00 g<br>
of palladium as palladium(II) chloride was admixed with<br>
50 ml of a 10% strength sodium carbonate solution at room<br><br>
temperature while stirring and stirred for a further<br>
2 hours. At the end of the stirring time, a pH of 5.85 had<br>
been established.<br>
This solution was then introduced into a suspension of 95 g<br>
of activated carbon in 500 ml of deionized water. The<br>
hydrolysis was completed by heating to 80°C. The catalyst<br>
was reduced by means of formaldehyde. The suspension was<br>
filtered hot and the solid was subsequently washed with<br>
1000 ml of deionized water.<br>
The reduced catalyst obtained in this way had a palladium<br>
content of 5.0%.<br>
Example 3:<br>
Unreduced palladium on activated carbon catalyst<br>
(comparison)<br>
The preparation was carried out by a method analogous to<br>
Example 2, except that the catalyst was worked up without prior<br>
reduction. This gives an unreduced catalyst having a palladium<br>
content of 5.0%.<br>
The catalyst has a pH of 5.0. After reduction with<br>
hydrogen, the pH is 3.6.<br>
Use Example 1:<br>
The catalysts produced as described in Example 1-3 were<br>
tested in the debenzylation of dibenzyl ether. From Example<br>
1+3, the unreduced catalyst was used. In each case,<br>
60 mmol of dibenzyl ether was dissolved in 100 ml of THF.<br>
This solution was hydrogenated in the presence of 200 mg of<br>
the catalysts described at a pressure of 1 bar of hydrogen<br>
and a temperature of 25°C. The reaction times to complete<br>
conversion were determined. Table 1 shows the results in<br>
detail:<br><br><br>
In addition, the hydrogen consumption during the reaction<br>
was plotted (Figure 2). It can be seen very clearly that<br>
the catalyst according to the present invention is<br>
significantly more active than the catalysts according to<br>
the prior art.<br>
Analogously to the examples presented here, the invention<br>
can also be applied to other processes in which a positive<br>
effect on the catalytic reaction is observed as a result of<br>
addition of acid. The method of producing the catalyst can<br>
also be applied to other noble metals and should not remain<br>
restricted only to palladium.<br><br>
