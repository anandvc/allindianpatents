DESCRIPTION<br>
MEDICAL LIQUID CONTAINER AND PREPARATION-CONTAINING MEDICAL<br>
LIQUID CONTAINER<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit pursuant to 35 U.S.C. §119 (e)(l) of U.S.<br>
Provisional Application No. 60/632,951 filed on December 6, 2004, and prioirity is<br>
claimed on Japanese Patent Application No. 2004-342695, filed November 26, 2004, and<br>
Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-327087, filed November 11, 2005, the contents of<br>
which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a medical liquid container for housing a medical<br>
preparation such as drip-feed solution, and a preparation-containing medical liquid<br>
container obtained by housing a medical preparation in the medical liquid container.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Some medicaments are used alone but in many cases, a plurality of medicaments<br>
are administered in combination to a patient.   Particularly, in the case of a liquid<br>
injection administered by transfusion, it is often performed to prepare the injection by<br>
mixing medicaments or co-inject a slight amount of a secondary medicament into the<br>
primary medicament.   Such an operation must be sterilely performed.   This sterile<br>
dispensing operation is cumbersome and a danger of causing a dispensing failure is<br>
noted.    Efforts have been heretofore made to improve this dispensing operation from the<br><br>
2<br>
aspect of medical liquid container and thereby elevate safety and efficiency.<br>
As for the container used in the medical field, a liquid medicament container<br>
where a plurality of contents are housed in a plurality of chambers partitioned in one<br>
container and although respective contents are not mixed before use, the contents can be<br>
easily mixed on use is known.    For example, with respect to the liquid medicament<br>
container of preparing a transfusion preparation by mixing multiple species of<br>
medicaments immediately before transfusing the transfusion preparation, a liquid<br>
medicament container with multiple chambers is known, where a seal part produced by<br>
heat-melt bonding inner wall faces of a bag-shaped container formed of a synthetic<br>
resin-made film is used as a partition and medicaments are housed in a plurality of<br>
chambers partitioned by the seal part within the bag-shaped container.    In a known<br>
constitution of such a liquid medicament container with multiple chambers, a rupturable<br>
liquidtight plug member is interposed in a part of the partition formed by the seal part<br>
and respective chambers are allowed to communicate by rupturing the liquidtight plug so<br>
that medicaments divided and housed in a plurality of chambers can be mixed.<br>
Also, a container using a peelable weak seal for a part or the entirety of the<br>
partition formed by a seal part is known, where respective chambers are allowed to<br>
communicate by stripping the peelable weak seal by means of pressing or the like and<br>
thereby liquid medicaments divided and housed in multiple chambers can be mixed.<br>
These containers have a constitution such that at the time of performing transfusion by<br>
using the medicaments housed, the partition dividing respective chambers is caused to<br>
allow for communication and create one continuous chamber inside the container.<br>
Out of these liquid medicament containers each with multiple chambers, in a<br>
medical liquid container having a primary medicament-housing chamber and a secondary<br>
medicament-housing chamber for housing a small amount of a medicament as in the case<br><br>
3<br>
where the inner content largely differs among liquid medicaments housed in respective<br>
liquid medicament-housing chambers, when the communicatable partitioning means used<br>
therefor is a weak seal part conventionally employed for a medical liquid container with<br>
two chambers, the production is more facilitated than in the case of using another<br>
partition member and since communication can be attained by pressing one chamber to<br>
increase the inner pressure of the liquid medicament, the liquid medicaments can be<br>
easily mixed on use.    Furthermore, the container comprising a sheet material has high<br>
flexibility, requires no air-passing needle, is excellent in hygiene, safety and workability<br>
such that the liquid discharge rate is kept constant throughout transfusion, realizes a<br>
small volume when wasted and ensures volume decrease at the disposal and therefore,<br>
this container is preferred as compared with conventional vials or medical liquid<br>
containers in which the entire is produced by blow molding.<br>
In the medicament-housing chambers partitioned by using a sheet material and<br>
forming a seal part, since the sheet material is flat, the medicament-housing chamber<br>
before charging a medicament is naturally in a state having a volume of nearly 0.    The<br>
medical container comprising a sheet material takes an inflated shape for the first time<br>
when a medicament is housed therein and the sheet material is deformed under a pressure<br>
generated due to self-weight of the medicament.    Particularly, in the case of a relatively<br>
small-content secondary medicament, when only a small amount of the medicament is<br>
charged, the rigidity of the sheet material surpasses the pressure generated due to<br>
self-weight of the medicament and the container cannot be inflated, as a result, the<br>
medicament is merely spread like a film between sheets over a wide area.<br>
If a small-content medicament is spread over a wide area in this way, at the time<br>
of sealing the secondary medicament-housing chamber by heat sealing, the medicament<br>
itself comes into contact with the heat-sealing part to cause a problem such as sealing<br><br>
4<br>
failure or deterioration of the medicament.   In addition, a housing chamber with a large<br>
area is necessary for housing a small amount of a secondary medicament and an<br>
excessively large medical container results to incur a problem of bad usability.<br>
As for the medical container in the case where the inner content ratio among<br>
medicaments housed in respective medicament-housing chambers is large,<br>
JP-A-2002-165864 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexaminedpublished<br>
Japanese patent application") describes a container in which a peelable weak seal is used<br>
for one partition of a housing container, a plurality of housing containers are joined<br>
through the weak seal part, and medicaments can be mixed on use.    However, if a<br>
small-content secondary medicament chamber partitioned by a seal partition is formed in<br>
a medical container comprising a sheet material, a large area must be ensured for the<br>
secondary medicament chamber, as a result, the medical container as a whole becomes<br>
very large and its usability is bad.<br>
JP-A-2003-159309 describes a container in which a relatively small secondary<br>
medicament-housing container part is formed by using a cylindrical injection molded<br>
member and can be joined with a primary medicament container part by the same<br>
technique as used for joining a cylindrical port for liquid discharge.    However, in order<br>
to attain communication between the secondary medicament-housing chamber formed by<br>
using an injection molded member and the primary medicament chamber, a part of the<br>
injection molded member dividing these two chambers must be fractured to remove the<br>
partition, and the force for this communication operation must be suppressed to such an<br>
extent of allowing for almost no generation of fine pieces, particles or the like or not<br>
disturbing the transfusion.    Therefore, the design and production of the injection molded<br>
member and the management of production become very difficult.<br>
Furthermore, in the case where two or more secondary medicaments are used<br><br>
5<br>
and these medicaments cannot be mixed in advance during storage but must be mixed on<br>
use, secondary medicament-housing container parts prepared as many as the number of<br>
secondary medicaments by using the injection molded member must be joined to the<br>
primary medicament container part and this is cumbersome from the mechanical point of<br>
view and the workability point of view.<br>
JP-A-2003-62038 describes a case where since the secondary<br>
medicament-housing container part becomes relatively large when a flat bag formed of a<br>
sheet is used, a bag-shaped secondary medicament-housing container part is housed in a<br>
primary medicament container so as to suppress increase in the size of the entire<br>
medicament.    In order to accommodate a secondary medicament-housing container part<br>
in a primary medicament container, foreign matters attached to the surface of the<br>
secondary medicament-housing container part must be thoroughly removed and the<br>
secondary medicament-housing container must be inserted by opening the primary<br>
medicament container in a clean environment, but this is very cumbersome from the<br>
mechanical point of view and the workability point of view.<br>
Furthermore, JP-A-2000-5275 discloses a medical container in which a<br>
container for housing a relatively small-content secondary medicament is formed to<br>
intrude into a suspension hole.   The object of this invention is to greatly reduce a danger<br>
of forgetting the operation of adding a small-content secondary medicament by passing<br>
the secondary medicament through the partition between the secondary<br>
medicament-housing chamber and the primary medicament-housing chamber.    More<br>
specifically, on hanging a transfusion container, a notice is directed to the secondary<br>
medicament due to disturbance of the secondary medicament chamber intruded into the<br>
suspension hole, and a failure of forgetting to mix the medicament is thereby prevented.<br>
It is stated that for the purpose of distinguishing whether the secondary medicament is<br><br>
6<br>
mixed or not. the material constituting the small-content secondary medicament chamber<br>
preferably has flexibility.<br>
It is also stated that when the secondary medicament is not mixed and remains in<br>
the secondary medicament chamber, the mixing medicament chamber is inflated and<br>
therefore, this can be easily viewed from outside.   As understood from these, in the<br>
invention described in JP-A-2000-5275, the material constituting the secondary<br>
medicament-housing chamber is substantially soft and the secondary<br>
medicament-housing chamber is inflated when housing a secondary medicament but is<br>
deflated when the secondary medicament is mixed with the primary medicament.    Such<br>
a secondary medicament-housing container part comprising a substantially soft material<br>
and being deflated in the state of not housing a secondary medicament requires a large<br>
area for housing a small-content secondary medicament, and a very large medical<br>
container results.<br>
As described above, the invention of JP-A-2002-165864 has a problem that<br>
when a container for housing a small-content secondary medicament is produced from a<br>
planar container capable of weak sealing, a container with a large area is necessary and<br>
the size of the entire medicament becomes large.    In the invention of<br>
JP-A-2003-159309, when an injection molded member is used for the secondary<br>
medicament-housing container part, opening to the primary medicament container can be<br>
attained by fracturing a part of the injection molded member at the mixing on use.<br>
Therefore, the injection molded member must be designed and produced not to generate<br>
fine pieces, particles or the like at the fracturing and the management of production is<br>
very severe.<br>
In the invention of JP-A-2003-62038, in order to accommodate a secondary<br>
medicament-housing container part in a primary medicament container, foreign matters<br><br>
7<br>
attached to the surface of the secondary medicament-housing container part must be<br>
thoroughly removed and an operation of opening the primary medicament container in a<br>
clean environment and placing and fixing the secondary medicament-housing container<br>
part therein must be performed.    Such a process requires a mechanically complicated<br>
apparatus and moreover, the apparatus must be installed and operated in a clean<br>
environment.   Furthermore, there is a problem that the control for preventing foreign<br>
matters from mingling is very cumbersome.<br>
In the invention of JP-A-2000-5275, if the container for housing a small-content<br>
secondary medicament is produced in a shape capable of weak sealing, a container with a<br>
large area is necessary and the entire medicament size becomes large.    In this patent<br>
publication, it is also disclosed to use the injection molded member for the partition wall<br>
dividing a mixing medicament container and a primary medicament container or for the<br>
mixing medicament container itself, but in such a case, there arises a problem that the<br>
production process is more cumbersome and difficult than in the case of using the<br>
peelable partitioning means and the produced container becomes expensive.<br>
The present invention has been made under these circumstances and an object of<br>
the present invention is to provide a relatively compact medical liquid container which is<br>
free from sealing failure in the seal portion at the peripheral edge of the liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber and also free from deterioration of a medicament housed<br>
in a small amount and ensures good usability as a medical container; and a<br>
preparation-containing medical liquid container.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
In order to attain the above-described object, the present invention provides a<br>
medical liquid container having a primary liquid medicament-housing chamber for<br><br>
8<br>
housing a medicament and at least one secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber<br>
for housing a liquid medicament smaller in the amount than the liquid medicament<br>
housed in the primary liquid medicament-housing chamber, which is connected with the<br>
primary liquid medicament-housing chamber, an inside of the primary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber and an inside of the secondary liquid medicament-housing<br>
chamber being communicatably divided, wherein the secondary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber has a bulge part bulged such that the internal<br>
medicament-housing space before housing a medicament is larger than the volume of the<br>
housed medicament.<br>
In the medical liquid container, it is preferable that the secondary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber be liquidtightly sealed, and communicatably divided from<br>
the primary liquid medicament-housing chamber.    In this case, it is also preferable that<br>
the liquidtight seal is formed at the outside of the primary liquid medicament-housing<br>
chamber.<br>
In the medical liquid container, it is preferable that the primary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber be made of a flexible sheet material.<br>
The bulge part may comprise two sheet members and a separation member<br>
separating those two sheet members from each other to form a space and being housed in<br>
the secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber.   The bulge part may be formed by<br>
cold stretching or heat stretching of a sheet member.   Also, the secondary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber may be a blow-molded article.<br>
The primary liquid medicament-housing chamber may comprise a plurality of<br>
housing chambers divided by a peelable liquidtight seal.   A preparation-containing<br>
medical liquid container housing a medicament in each of the primary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber and the secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber of<br><br>
9<br>
the above-described medical liquid container is provided.   The secondary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber may be a preparation-containing secondary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber produced by a method of continuously performing<br>
formation of a chamber by blow molding, housing of a medicament and sealing of the<br>
chamber.<br>
In the preparation-containing medical liquid container, it is preferable that a<br>
medicament containing any one or more of a sugar, an electrolyte, and an amino acid be<br>
housed in the primary liquid medicament-housing chamber.    Simultaneously, it is<br>
preferably that a medicament containing any one or more of a water-soluble vitamin, a<br>
fat-soluble vitamin and a trace element be housed in the secondary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber.<br>
According to the present invention, a bulge part larger, before housing a<br>
medicament, than the volume of a medicament housed in the internal<br>
medicament-housing space is previously formed in the secondary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber, whereby the medicament is prevented from spreading like<br>
a film between sheets over a wide area but housed with a thickness in the bulge part.<br>
By feeding a small-content medicament into this bulge part, contact of the medicament<br>
itself with the heat-seal part and occurrence of sealing failure can be prevented at the<br>
time of sealing the secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber by heat sealing.<br>
Furthermore, the medicament is also prevented from deterioration due to contact with the<br>
heat seal and a medicament in a good state is housed in the bulge part.    In addition, the<br>
area of the secondary liquid medicament-housing container can be made small and a<br>
medical liquid container with compactness in its entirety and good usability can be<br>
obtained.<br><br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is described in detail below by referring to the drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 is an outer appearance perspective view showing one example of the<br><br>
11<br>
medical liquid container of the present invention.   The medical liquid container 10<br>
comprises a primary liquid medicament-housing chamber 11 for housing a first liquid<br>
medicament and a secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber 12 for housing a<br>
second liquid medicament smaller in the amount than the first liquid medicament housed<br>
in the primary liquid medicament-housing chamber 11, which is connected with the<br>
primary liquid medicament-housing chamber 11.<br>
In the primary liquid medicament-housing chamber 11, almost the entire<br>
circumference of the peripheral edge part forms an unseparably sealed strong seal part 13<br>
and the entirety is formed from a sheet-like member having flexibility, such as synthetic<br>
resin film.    The resin used for the synthetic resin film is not particularly limited as long<br>
as it is a resin used in the field of medical container.   Specific examples thereof include<br>
a polyolefin resin, a polyamide resin, a polyester resin, a poly(meth)acrylate, a polyvinyl<br>
chloride, a polyvinylidene chloride, a polyethersulfone and an ethylene-vinyl alcohol<br>
copolymer.   Among these, a polyolefin resin is preferred because this is inexpensive and<br>
excellent in the transparency, flexibility and hygiene.<br>
Examples of the polyolefin resin include a polyethylene-based resin such as<br>
high-density polyethylene, medium-density polyethylene, high-pressure low-density<br>
polyethylene, linear low-density polyethylene and ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, an<br>
olefin-based elastomer such as ethylene-a-olefin random copolymer, a<br>
polypropylene-based resin such as polypropylene, ethylene-propylene random copolymer<br>
and a-olefin-propylene random copolymer, a cyclic polyolefin resin, and a mixture<br>
thereof.   Such a resin may be partially crosslinked for the purpose of enhancing heat<br>
resistance or the like.<br>
Also, this synthetic resin film may be a single-layer film comprising one of<br>
those resins or two or more thereof in blend or may be a multilayer film comprising two<br><br>
12<br>
or more layers.   Such a synthetic resin film may have a thickness of 50 to 1,000 μm,<br>
preferably on the order of 100 to 500 μm.   The synthetic resin film may be either a cast<br>
film produced by T-die casting or a blown film produced by blown film fabrication.<br>
A discharge port 18 is formed at one end of the primary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber 11.   This discharge port 18 is a liquid outlet for taking<br>
out a mixed liquid medicament resulting from mixing of the first liquid medicament and<br>
the second liquid medicament and by connecting thereto exclusive discharge means such<br>
as adapter or needle, the mixed liquid medicament is taken out from the medical liquid<br>
container 10.   The discharge port is sometimes used as an injection port for mixing and<br>
injecting another medicament to the mixed liquid medicament.    In addition to the<br>
discharge port 18, one injection port or two ore more injection ports may be separately<br>
joined to the one end, the other end or the like of the primary liquid medicament-housing<br>
chamber.   The discharge port 18 may be joined to the secondary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber.<br>
Fig. 2 is a principal part cross-sectional view showing a part of the primary<br>
liquid medicament-housing chamber 11, and a secondary liquid medicament-housing<br>
chamber 12.    The secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber 12 is connected to the<br>
primary liquid medicament-housing chamber 11 at the opposite side to the side in which<br>
the discharge portion 18 is formed.    In this embodiment, the primary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber 11 and the secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber<br>
12 are formed separately, and they are overlapped at a connection part 14 and adhered<br>
such that they cannot peel each other.   The secondary liquid medicament-housing<br>
chamber 12 has a bulge part 15 bulged such that the internal medicament-housing space<br>
before housing a secondary medicament is larger than the volume of the housed second<br>
medicament.   The secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber 12 is formed<br><br>
13<br>
stereoscopically.<br>
The bulge part 15 may be formed stereoscopically, for example, by cold<br>
stretching or heat stretching of a sheet member or by blow molding using a die.   The<br>
secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber 12 having such a bulge part 15 can be<br>
formed of various synthetic resins.    Specific examples thereof include a polyolefin<br>
resin, a polyamide resin, a polyester resin, a poly(meth)acrylate, a polyvinyl chloride, a<br>
polyvinylidene chloride, a polyethersulfone and an ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer.<br>
Among these, a polyolefin resin is preferred because this resin is inexpensive and<br>
excellent in the transparency, flexibility and hygiene.<br>
Examples of the polyolefin resin include a polyethylene-based resin such as<br>
high-density polyethylene, medium-density polyethylene, high-pressure low-density<br>
polyethylene, linear low-density polyethylene and ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, an<br>
olefin-based elastomer such as ethylene-a-olefin random copolymer, a<br>
polypropylene-based resin such as polypropylene, ethylene-propylene random copolymer<br>
and a-olefin-propylene random copolymer, a cyclic polyolefin resin, and a mixture<br>
thereof.    Such a resin may be partially crosslinked for the purpose of enhancing heat<br>
resistance or the like.    Furthermore, the secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber<br>
having a bulge part 15 may have a single-layer or multilayer structure comprising one or<br>
more resin selected from those various synthetic resins.<br>
Particularly, in the case of a medicament which adsorbs to a polyethylene resin<br>
or a polypropylene resin generally employed for medical usage, such as fat-soluble<br>
vitamin compound, the secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber preferably takes a<br>
multilayer structure using a cyclic polyolefin for the innermost layer coming into contact<br>
with the medicament.<br>
In the case where the secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber houses a<br><br>
14<br>
medicament such as antibiotic which deteriorates due to oxygen or the like in the outer<br>
air, the secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber preferably takes a multilayer<br>
structure comprising a resin having a gas barrier property against oxygen or the like, such<br>
as ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer, and another resin.    Furthermore, in order to<br>
elevate the adhesive strength between respective resin layers in the multilayer structure, a<br>
resin having compatibility in common may be mixed in one or both of the resins<br>
constituting the adjacent layers, or a layer comprising a resin having compatibility in<br>
common, for example, an adhesive resin such as ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, may<br>
be added between those layers.<br>
In the case where a medicament which deteriorates due to light (e.g., ultraviolet<br>
ray), such as vitamin compound, is housed as the secondary liquid medicament, a layer<br>
of shielding light in the wavelength region harmful to the medicament may be added.<br>
For example, in order to shield ultraviolet ray, an iron oxide-containing polyolefin resin<br>
may be used for the outer layer of the secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber in<br>
a multilayer structure.<br>
When the secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber has a multilayer<br>
structure, the multilayer structure may be formed by co-extrusion molding of multiple<br>
layers.   Alternatively, single-layer or multilayer materials may be bonded by heat<br>
lamination, dry lamination or the like to obtain an objective multilayer structure.<br>
The second medicament (secondary medicament) housed in the secondary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber 12 is mixed with the first medicament (primary<br>
medicament) housed in the primary liquid medicament-housing chamber 11 on use<br>
immediately before administering the medicament to a patient or the like.    In order to<br>
facilitate the mixing on use, it is preferable that a liquidtight seal 16 allowing for<br>
communication between the inside of the secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber<br><br>
15<br>
12 and the inside of the primary liquid medicament-housing chamber 11 upon pressing<br>
the bulge part 15 of the secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber 12 or pressing<br>
the primary liquid medicament-housing chamber 11, be formed.<br>
The liquidtight seal 16 is formed such that it communicatably divides the inside<br>
of the primary liquid medicament-housing chamber 11 and the inside of the secondary<br>
liquid medicament-housing chamber 12.   The configuration of the liquidtight seal 16 is<br>
not limited, but it is preferable that the liquidtight seal 16 be formed so as to be peelable<br>
by heat-seal joining.    In addition, as shown in Fig. 2, it is also preferable that the inside<br>
of the primary liquid medicament-housing chamber 11 and the inside of the secondary<br>
liquid medicament-housing chamber 12 be communicably divided by liquidtight seal 16<br>
joining the secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber 12.    When the medical liquid<br>
container has such structure, it is possible to house the second medicament in the<br>
secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber 12, and liquidtight seal 16 the secondary<br>
liquid medicament-housing chamber 12, and then connect the secondary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber 12 with the primary liquid medicament-housing chamber<br>
11.    Since the second medicament in the secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber<br>
12 is not contacted with ambient air continuously, the medical liquid container having<br>
such a structure is preferable from the aspect of good hygiene.<br>
Specific embodiments of the position of the liquidtight seal 16 in the secondary<br>
liquid medicament-housing chamber 12 include an inside of the primary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber 11 as shown in Figs. 3 and 4A, in addition to an outside of<br>
the primary liquid medicament-housing chamber 11 as shown in Figure 2.    In the<br>
embodiment shown in Fig. 3, the liquidtight seal 16 is formed so as to correspond to the<br>
connection part 14 in which the primary liquid medicament-housing chamber 11 and the<br>
secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber 12 are adhered.   In the embodiment<br><br>
16<br>
shown in Fig. 4A, the liquidtight seal 16 is formed at portion other than the connection<br>
part 14 in which the primary liquid medicament-housing chamber 11 and the secondary<br>
liquid medicament-housing chamber 12 are adhered.    In this embodiment, the<br>
liquidtight seal 16 is formed at the edge portion of the secondary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber 12.<br>
In any embodiments shown in Figs. 2, 3, and 4A, it is possible to connect the<br>
primary liquid medicament-housing chamber 11 and the secondary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber 12 without subjecting the second medicament in the<br>
secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber 12 to ambient air, and these embodiments<br>
are excellent in hygiene.    However, from the viewpoint of ease of peeling of the<br>
liquidtight seal 16 in using the medical liquid container, the embodiments shown in Figs.<br>
2 and 3 are preferable.    Specifically, in the embodiments shown in Figs. 2 and 3, it is<br>
possible to easily peel the liquidtight seal 16 by arbitrarily select and press the primary<br>
liquid medicament-housing chamber 11 or the secondary liquid medicament-housing<br>
chamber 12.<br>
In contrast, in the embodiment shown in Fig. 4A, when the primary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber 11 is pressed, as shown in Fig. 4B, sufficient pressure to<br>
peel is not applied to the liquidtight seal 16.    Due to this, it is necessary to press the<br>
secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber 12 to peel the liquidtight seal 16.<br>
Therefore, from the viewpoint of ease of peeling of liquidtight seal 16 in using<br>
the medical liquid container, the embodiments shown in Figs. 2 and 3 are preferable.<br>
In addition, from the viewpoint of ease of production of the medical liquid<br>
container, the embodiment shown in Fig. 2 is more preferable than the embodiments<br>
shown in Fig 3.   Specifically, in the embodiment shown in Fig. 2. the liquidtight seal 16<br>
is formed so as not to overlap the connection part 14 in which the primary liquid<br><br>
17<br>
medicament-housing chamber 11 and the secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber<br>
12 are adhered.   There is technical difficulty to form the connection part 14 and the<br>
liquidtight seal 16 at the same position, which have different heat seal strengths.    In<br>
addition, when the connection part 14 and the liquidtight seal 16, which have different<br>
heat seal strengths, are formed at the same position, thermal damage is applied to the<br>
same position at several time.   However, in the embodiment in Fig. 2, since the<br>
liquidtight seal 16 of the secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber 12 is formed so<br>
as not to overlap the connection portion 14, these problems do not generate.    Therefore,<br>
it is preferable that the liquidtight seal 16 of the secondary liquid medicament-housing<br>
chamber 12 be formed so as not to overlap the connection portion 14, and more<br>
preferable that the liquidtight seal 16 be formed at the outside the primary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber 11.<br>
The liquidtight seal which can be peeled upon application of a pressure to allow<br>
for communication is not particularly limited in its formation method but may be formed,<br>
for example, by the method described in JP-A-2004-000476 where melt-bonding is<br>
performed such that the area occupied by the strong melt-bonding part in the<br>
melt-bonding part becomes less than 25%.    Alternatively, the partition wall-forming<br>
portion of a blow molding die may be constituted to make the distance between opposing<br>
faces of the die to be broader than the distance undergoing complete melt-bonding or the<br>
distance completely not undergoing melt-bonding, so that the bonding can be suppressed<br>
to such an extent of allowing for communication while having satisfactory<br>
liquidtightness.   Also, similarly to the above-described seal shape, the liquidtight seal<br>
can be formed by employing a die shape constituted such that the strong melt-bonding<br>
part occupies less than 25%.<br>
The connection part 14 unseparably connecting the secondary liquid<br><br>
18<br>
medicament-housing chamber 12 and the primary liquid medicament-housing chamber<br>
11 can be formed by a technique such as heat:seal joining, joining through a cylindrical<br>
member, or joining through a partitioning member described in JP-A-2001- 87350.<br>
Particularly, in the case of inserting the end part of the secondary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber 12 into the primary liquid medicament-housing chamber<br>
11 and heat-sealing it to effect joining, when the sheet material constituting each chamber<br>
is made to have a multilayer structure and the resin of each layer is selected so that the<br>
sealing temperature at the joining of the outer face of the secondary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber 12 with the inner face of the primary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber 11 can be set to be lower than the temperature at the<br>
melt-bonding of inner faces of the secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber 12<br>
with each other, the secondary liquid medicameni-housing chamber 12 and the primary<br>
liquid medicament-housing chamber 11 can be joined by a simple and easy sealing<br>
process.<br>
Inversely, in the case where the outer face of the primary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber 11 and the inner face of the secondary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber 12 are joined by heat sealing, when the sheet material<br>
constituting each chamber is made to have a multilayer structure and the resin of each<br>
layer is selected so that the sealing temperature at the joining of the outer face of the<br>
primary liquid medicament-housing chamber 11 with the inner face of the secondary<br>
liquid medicament-housing chamber 12 can be set to be lower than the temperature at the<br>
melt-bonding of inner faces of the primary liquid medicament-housing chamber 11 with<br>
each other, the secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber 12 and the primary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber 11 can also be joined by a simple and easy sealing process.<br>
In the examples of the present invention described by referring to Figs. 2 to 4, a<br><br>
19<br>
liquidtight seal 16 capable of being peeled to allow for communication is applied only to<br>
the secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber 12, but the liquidtight seal may be<br>
similarly applied to the primary liquid medicament-housing chamber 11 or may be<br>
applied both to the secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber 12 and the primary<br>
liquid medicament-housing chamber 11.<br>
The mode of operation of the preparation-containing medical liquid container<br>
obtained by housing medicaments in a medical liquid container having the<br>
above-described constitution is described by referring to Figs. 5 and 6.    As shown in<br>
Fig. 5, the preparation-containing medical liquid container 10 is housing, for example,<br>
approximately from 100 mL to 5 L of a medicament and a first medicament (primary<br>
medicament) 22 is housed in the primary liquid medicament-housing chamber 11,<br>
whereas a second medicament (secondary medicament) 23 with the content being equal<br>
to or smaller than the first medicament 22 is housed in the secondary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber 12.   The secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber<br>
22	is not particularly limited in its capacity but when the medicament content is small,<br>
the capacity is specifically 100 mLor less or depending on the case, as small as 10 mLor<br>
less.<br>
At this time, a bulge part 15 having a volume larger than the second medicament<br>
23	is previously formed in the secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber 12,<br>
whereby the medicament is prevented from spreading like a film between sheets over a<br>
wide area as compared with the case of feeding a small amount of a medicament into a<br>
secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber constituted by two flat sheet materials<br>
and can be housed with a thickness in the bulge part 15.   By feeding a small amount of<br>
second medicament 23 into such a bulge part 15, contact of the second medicament 23<br>
itself with the heat-seal part and occurrence of sealing failure can be prevented at the<br><br>
20<br>
time of sealing the secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber 12 by heat sealing.<br>
Furthermore, the second medicament is also prevented from deterioration due to contact<br>
with the heat seal and a second medicament 23 in a good state is housed in the bulge part<br>
15.<br>
In using such a preparation-containing medical liquid container 10, as shown in<br>
Fig. 6, for example, the bulge part 15 of the secondary liquid medicament-housing<br>
chamber 12 is pressed and crushed, whereby the liquidtight seal 16 is peeled to allow for<br>
communication between the inside of the primary liquid medicament-housing chamber<br>
11 and the inside of the secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber 12.    As a result,<br>
the first medicament (primary medicament) 22 housed in the primary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber 11 and the second medicament (secondary medicament)<br>
23 housed in the secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber 12 are mixed and a<br>
mixed medicament 25 is formed.<br>
Two or more secondary liquid medicament-housing chambers each having such<br>
a bulge part may be formed for one primary liquid medicament-housing chamber.    As<br>
shown in Fig. 7, two secondary liquid medicament-housing chambers 33 and 34 are<br>
formed on one end side of the primary liquid medicament-housing chamber 32 of the<br>
medical liquid container 31.    In these secondary liquid medicament-housing chambers<br>
33 and 34, bulge parts 35 and 36 for housing a small amount of a liquid medicament<br>
while keeping the quality are formed, respectively.<br>
In this way, by connecting two or more secondary liquid medicament-housing<br>
chambers 33 and 34 for one primary liquid medicament-housing chamber 32, a mixed<br>
liquid medicament in various combinations can be formed on use.   Also, two secondary<br>
liquid medicament-housing chambers 33 and 34 shown in Fig. 7 are preferably molded<br>
and integrated at the same time.   The integrated multiple secondary liquid<br><br>
21<br>
medicament-housing chambers 33 and 34 can be joined with the primary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber 32 at one time and since the number of joining operations<br>
does not increase even if the number of secondary liquid medicament-housing chambers<br>
33 is increased, the production of the medical liquid container is advantageously<br>
facilitated.<br>
The preparation-containing medical liquid container described above may also<br>
employ a system such that the primary liquid medicament-housing chamber is pressed on<br>
use to apply a pressure to the primary liquid medicament and by the effect of this<br>
pressure, the liquidtight seal, which divides the primary liquid medicament-housing<br>
chamber and the secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber, is peeled to mix the<br>
primary liquid medicament and the secondary liquid medicament on use.    Particularly,<br>
in the case where two or more secondary liquid medicament-housing chambers are<br>
joined, it is more easy and simple to press the primary liquid medicament-housing<br>
chamber and peel liquidtight seals all at once.<br>
Fig. 8 is another embodiment in which the constitution of the bulge part of the<br>
secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber is changed.    In the secondary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber 43 connected to the primary liquid medicament-housing<br>
chamber 42 of the medical liquid container 41 of this embodiment, the bulge part 46 is<br>
formed by housing a separation member 45 between two sheet members 44.<br>
This separation member 45 is not limited in its shape and as long as two sheet<br>
members 44 can be separated from each other to form a fixed space before housing a<br>
medicament, the separation member may have, for example, a spherical, columnar, cubic<br>
or rectangular parallelepiped shape other than the cylindrical shape shown in Fig. 8.   As<br>
for the two sheet members, one sheet member may be folded or a blown film may be<br>
used.   The separation member 45 may be formed of, for example, a polyolefin resin<br><br>
22<br>
such as polyethylene resin, polypropylene resin and cyclic polyolefin resin, a polyamide<br>
resin, a polyester resin, a poly(meth)acrylate, a polyvinyl chloride, a polyvinylidene<br>
chloride, a polyethersulfone, an ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer or a blend thereof.<br>
Furthermore, in the medical liquid container, the primary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber may be divided into a plurality of chambers by<br>
communicatable liquidtight seal.    For example, as shown in Fig. 9, the medical liquid<br>
container 58 may comprise first and second primary liquid medicament-housing<br>
chambers 52 and 53, of which the insides are divided by a peelable liquidtight seal 51,<br>
and three secondary liquid medicament-housing chambers 54, 55 and 56 connected to the<br>
second primary liquid medicament-housing chamber 53 by the connection part 59.    In<br>
this medical liquid container 58, two kinds of primary liquid medicaments and three<br>
kinds of secondary liquid medicaments can be mixed on use.    Also, an injection port for<br>
co-injecting a medicament may be fixed to the second primary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber 53.<br>
In the medical liquid container 58 in this embodiment, only the secondary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chambers 54, 55 and 56 are provided with the liquidtight seals 57a,<br>
57b, and 57c, and these liquidtight seals 57a, 57b, and 57c are positioned at the outside of<br>
the second primary liquid medicament-housing chamber 53.    Due to this structure, it is<br>
possible to seal the secondary liquid medicament-housing chambers 54, 55 and 56 with<br>
the liquidtight seals 57a, 57b, and 57c, and then connect the secondary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chambers 54, 55 and 56 with second primary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber 53, and this is excellent in hygiene.    In addition, it is<br>
possible to peel simultaneously the liquidtight seal 51, which divides the inside of the<br>
first primary liquid medicament-housing chamber 52 and the inside of the second<br>
primary liquid medicament-housing chamber 53, and all of the liquid seals 57a, 57b, and<br><br>
23<br>
57c, which divide the inside of the second primary liquid medicament-housing chamber<br>
53 and the insides of the secondary liquid medicament-housing chambers 54,55 and 56<br>
by only one operation of pressing the second primary liquid medicament-housing<br>
chamber 53 connected to the secondary liquid medicament-housing chambers 54, 55 and<br>
56.    According to such a medical liquid container 58, it is not necessary to complicated<br>
operations such as peeling all of the liquid seals 51, 57a, 57b, and 57c in turn, and<br>
preparation of a medicament is easy, and it is possible to prevent a generation of a trouble<br>
such as a failure of forgetting to peel one of three liquidtight seals 57a, 57b, and 57c.<br>
The medical liquid container of the present invention can be used, for example,<br>
as a container for housing a kit preparation for intravenous hyperalimentation or a kit<br>
preparation for peripheral parenteral nutrition, which are used in the intravenous<br>
hyperalimentation method, or for housing a component nutrition used in the enteral<br>
nutrition method.    The preparation-containing medical liquid container of the present<br>
invention is the medical liquid container of the present invention in which a medicament<br>
is housed in each of the primary liquid medicament-housing chamber and the secondary<br>
liquid medicament-housing chamber.    The primary medicament housed in the primary<br>
liquid medicament-housing chamber is not particularly limited, but examples thereof<br>
include a solution such as distilled water, an electrolyte infusion such as physiological<br>
saline, a saccharides infusion such as glucose solution, an amino acid infusion such as<br>
amino acid preparation, and a fat infusion such as fat emulsion.<br>
In the case where the primary liquid medicament-housing chamber comprises a<br>
plurality of chambers, the primary medicament is not particularly limited, but examples<br>
thereof include a nutrient infusion containing any one or more of sugar, electrolyte,<br>
amino acid, fat emulsion and the like, a blood substitute infusion comprising a<br>
combination of various electrolytes, and a dialysis fluid comprising a combination of<br><br>
24<br>
sugar and electrolyte.    The secondary medicament housed in the secondary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber is also not particularly limited, but examples thereof<br>
include vitamins (e.g., water-soluble vitamin, fat-soluble vitamin), trace metal (e.g.,<br>
copper, iron, manganese, zinc), iodine, calcium chloride for correction, insulin, antibiotic,<br>
anticancer drug, anti-peptic ulcer agent, hepatic disorder remedy, cardiac, analgesic,<br>
antipyretic analgesic, anesthetic, fat emulsion, hypotensive agent, vasodilator, hormone<br>
preparation and heparin.    The medicament housed is not limited to a liquid medicament<br>
but may be a solid or powder medicament.<br>
Particularly, in the case of housing a liquid medicament in the secondary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber, a preparation-containing secondary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber produced by a method of continuously performing<br>
formation of a chamber by blow molding, housing of a medicament and sealing of the<br>
chamber is preferably used, because the medicament can be sterilely housed in the<br>
secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber without opening the secondary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber.<br>
Examples of the kit preparation for intravenous hyperalimentation used in the<br>
intravenous hyperalimentation method, which is housed in the preparation-containing<br>
medical liquid container of the present invention, include a high calorie infusion used as<br>
an initiating solution or a maintenance solution.    In a preferred embodiment of the high<br>
calorie infusion, a medicament containing any one or more of sugar, electrolyte and<br>
amino acid is housed in the primary liquid medicament-housing chamber, and a<br>
medicament containing any one or more of water-soluble vitamin, fat-soluble vitamin<br>
and trace element is housed in the secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br><br>
25<br>
According to the present invention, a bulge part larger, before housing a<br>
medicament, than the volume of a medicament housed in the internal<br>
medicament-housing space is previously formed in the secondary liquid<br>
medicament-housing chamber, whereby the medicament is prevented from spreading like<br>
a film between sheets over a wide area but housed with a thickness in the bulge part.<br>
By feeding a small amount of medicament into this bulge part, contact of the medicament<br>
itself with the heat-seal part and occurrence of sealing failure can be prevented at the<br>
time of sealing the secondary liquid medicament-housing chamber by heat sealing.<br>
Furthermore, the medicament is also prevented from deterioration due to contact with the<br>
heat seal and a medicament in a good state is housed in the bulge part.    In addition, the<br>
area of the secondary liquid medicament-housing container can be made small and a<br>
medical liquid container with compactness in its entirety and good usability can be<br>
obtained.<br><br>
