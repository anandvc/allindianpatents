SINGLE ANTENNA INTERFERENCE REJECTION BY MEANS OF  ITERATIVE  INTERFERENCE ESTIMATION AND SPATIO-TEMPORAL WHITENING<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This patent application is related in subject matter to and incorporates by<br>
 5            reference the entire disclosure of U.S. Patent Application No. 10/684598, entitled Method of and Apparatus for Noise Whitening Filtering, bearing Attorney Docket No. 53807-00069USPT, and filed on the same date as this patent application.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Technical Field of the Invention<br>
10	The present invention relates in general to single antenna interference rejection<br>
(SAIR) in digital time-division multiple access communications systems and, more particularly, to SAIR in communications systems operating according to Global System of Mobile communications (GSM).<br>
15	History of Related Art<br>
Receiver performance in wireless digital time-division multiple access<br>
(TDMA) communication systems such as, for example, those operating according to<br>
GSM, Enhanced Data GSM Evolution (EDGE), and Digital Advanced Mobile Service<br>
(DAMPS), is often interference-limited. Interference might come from, for example, 20     other users.   Users operating on identical carrier frequencies in neighboring cells<br>
might create co-channel interference (CCI), while users operating on adjacent carrier<br>
frequencies might create adjacent-channel interference (ACI).<br>
Network capacity of the communication systems is limited by cellular<br>
frequency planning, which has to comply with the CCI and ACI performance of the 25     receivers.  Thus, any substantial improvement to receiver CCI or ACI performance<br>
can significantly increase the network capacity. SAIR is an approach used to increase<br>
the network capacity.<br>

PCT/EP2004/011275<br><br>
SAIR utilizes die single-dimensional nature in the complex domain of<br>
interference in, for example, a GSM system.   Real and imaginary samples of a<br>
complex received signal are treated as if the real and imaginary samples were from<br>
different propagation channels.   Spatio-temporal diversity is exploited to suppress<br>
5     interference.<br>
FIGURE 1 is a functional block diagram that illustrates a current SAIR process. In FIGURE 1, =&gt; indicates a dependency relation. Variables shown in FIG. 1 are as follows:<br>
r	received signal<br>
10	r'        updated received signal<br>
t	training sequence<br>
h{n+m ) n+m tap channel estimate<br>
A{m+l) interference model<br>
p	synchronization position<br>
15	s	symbol estimate<br>
A SAIR process 100 begins with burst synchronization of the received signal r<br>
at a synchronization block 102. At a Generalized Least Square (GLS) channel Spatio-<br>
Temporal Whitening (STW) estimation block 104, a joint estimation of an m-m order<br>
Vectorized Auto-Recursive (VAR) model of the interference A(m+l) and the (n+m)-th<br><br>
20             order channel estimate h(n+m) is performed. The interference model A(m+l) is output<br>
from the GLS channel STW estimation block 104 to a STW filter block 106. The<br>
received signal r is also input to the STW filter block 106. The received signal r is<br>
filtered by die STW filter block 106 with coefficients in a matrix polynomial to yield<br>
an updated received signal r'.<br><br>
25	The equalizer 108 also receives the interference model A(m+l) from the GLS<br>
channel STW estimation block 104. The equalizer 108 estimates data symbols of the transmission and yields the symbol estimate s.<br>
     In a GSM system, for example, the order of the interference model must be sufficiently low (e.g., m 
30                    least two drawbacks of the process 100. First, a span of the composite channel (i.e., the channel seen from the equalizer) for the received signal r is extended from n symbols to (n+m) symbols by the process 100. For a Decision Feedback Sequence Estimation (DFSE) equalizer, the channel extension is not a critical drawback, since a<br><br><br>
3<br><br>
	WO 2005/041511	PCT/EP2004/011275<br>
feedback span extension does not impose any prohibitive complexity increase. However, for a Maximum Likelihood Sequence Estimator (MLSE) equalizer, a complexity increase due to the process 100 is exponential. If, as in many common platforms, a Viterbi processor for the MLSE equalizer is pre-built wilh dedicated <br>
5                hardware, the extension makes implementation of SAIR as shown in the process 100 very difficult, if not impossible.<br>
Second, a joint GLS estimation of the interference model A(m+l) and the n+m tap channel estimate h{n+m} is both computationally expensive and often inaccurate. The inaccuracy impairs receiver performance under many channel conditions, such as,<br>
10              for example, when no strong interference is present or with high-level background noise. The background noise can be caused not only by physical disturbances, such as thermal noise, but also by non-ideal implementation factors, such as, for example, quantization noise. In addition, numerical properties of the joint estimation can be also critically ill-conditioned, which can make a fixed-point implementation of the<br>
15               algorithm very demanding. In GLS estimation, inversion of a fairly large matrix (e.g., up to 13x13) must be solved. Under realistic channel conditions, the matrix is close to singular, which makes fixed-point computations unstable due to rounding or truncation errors.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
20                      	These and other drawbacks are overcome by embodiments of the present<br>
invention, which provides a method of and apparatus for SAIR relaxation. A method of reducing interference in a received signal includes performing a synchronization of the received signal to yield a synchronization position and determining an updated received signal using the synchronization position and the received signal. The step<br>
25            of determining the updated received signal includes iteratively performing interference-model estimation and spatio-temporal whitening. An updated synchronization position of the updated received signal is determined. A channel estimate is determined using the updated synchronization position and the updated received signal.<br>

PCT/EP2004/011275<br><br>
A SAER. process 200 begins at the synchronization block 102 with burst synchronization of the received signal r. The received signal r is also input to a <br>
Spatio-Temporal Whitening setup &amp; processing by relaxation block (STW block) <br>
202. The term relaxation is used in parallel computing and in this application to <br>
5	 describe a decoupling of a data dependency of computations. The synchronization<br>
                   block 102 outputs the synchronization position/; to the STW block 202.<br>
The updated received signal r" output by the STW block 202 is provided to a synchronization adjustment block 204, a channel estimation block 206, and the equalizer 108. The synchronization adjustment block 204 adjusts a synchronization<br>
10                      position after the STW block 202. Synchronization-point adjustment by the synchronization adjustment block 204 allows symbol extension to be avoided. The synchronization adjustment block 204 rectifies any error-prone synchronization attained due to strong interference and adjusts the synchronization position so that the composite channel for the received signal r" with a designated span is able to cover<br>
15                      most of the energy of the received signal r.<br>
After synchronization adjustment at the synchronization adjustment block 204, an  n-tap channel estimation is made at the channel estimation block 206. Since no symbol extension has occurred, a more computationally efficient least squares (LS) estimation can be applied directly. The equalizer 108 receives the updated received<br>
20           signal r" and the n tap channel estimate hp,} and estimates data symbols of the transmission to yield the symbol estimate s'.<br>
The STW block 202 performs interference-model estimation and STW processing. In contrast to the process 100, in which a lumped-model estimation is performed in a predetermined order before lumped STW processing is performed, a<br>
25	relaxation approach based on a Vectorized Noise Correlation (VNC) is employed. At <br>
the STW &amp; processing relaxation block 202, a first-order VNC estimation and STW                 processing process is iterated m times. The process implemented in the STW setup &amp; processing relaxation block 202 can be illustrated by the following exemplary use udocode, in which // indicates non-code comments:<br>

5	      With a second synchronization and channel estimation as in the SAIR process<br>
200, symbol extension of the received signal r due to spatio-temporal whitening<br>
                processing can be avoided. A SAIR implementation can thus be implemented in<br>
               receiver architectures in which an equalizer is built in dedicated hardware that has a<br>
                fixed composite channel span. The relaxation approach employed in the STW block<br>
10          202 reduces computational complexity significantly, since all matrix operations are<br>
              now limited to 2x2 with real elements. The channel model estimation is decoupled<br>
              from the interference model estimation. Due to improved estimation conditions, the<br>
               proposed SAIR algorithm has shown improved performance in channel conditions in<br>
               which the background noise is at a realistic level.<br>
15                    Order-adaptation can be easily introduced into the loop of the STW block 202,<br>
 since a correct decision to stop the iteration with updated noise estimation is more<br>
              likely.   Approaches in accordance with the embodiment of the invention shown in<br>
             FIG. 2 compare favorably, in terms of performance, with other order-adaptation<br>
             approaches without noise updating, such as the Whittle-Wiggins-Robinson algorithm.<br>

process in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention. In FIG. 3, =&gt; indicates a dependency relationship. Variables shows in FIG. 3 are as follows:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
A  SAIR process  300  begins  with  the  received  signal  r being  input  to  a synchronization and vector noise correlation estimation block (SVNC estimation<br><br><br><br><br>

block) 302 and a STW processing block 304 via a switch 308. The SVNC estimation<br>
          block 302, the STW processing block 304, the switch 308, a switch 310, and a switch<br>
          306 form an iteration control loop. Due to synchronization introduced in the iteration<br>
          control loop, a synchronization position after each first order STW whitening is<br>
5        adjusted. The adjustment of the synchronization position effectively avoids<br>
         composite channel extension. The iteration control loop rectifies an error-prone<br>
         synchronization attained in strong interference and adjusts the synchronization<br>
        position so that a composite channel with a designated span is able to cover most of<br>
        the signal energy.<br>
10                After the received signal r has been input to the SVNC estimation block 302<br>
        and the STW processing block 304 via the switch 308, the switch 308 may be moved <br>
        to a second position, as shown in FIG. 3. With the switch 308 in the position shown <br>
        in FIG. 3, the switch 306 in the position shown in FIG. 3, and the switch 310 <br>
        connected to the STW processing block 304, the iteration control loop is closed and <br>
15	an iterative estimation-whitening processing is implemented. When the received <br>
signal r is already sufficiently white, the received signal r may be input directly to the      channel estimation block 206 and the equalizer 108 without passing through the <br>
         SVNC estimation block 302 or the STW processing block 304 by setting the switch <br>
         308 to receive the received signal r, setting the switch 310 as shown in FIG. 3, and <br>
20     setting the switch 306 to be connected to the channel estimation block 206 and the         equalizer 108.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention utilize the iterative estimation-<br>
       whitening processing as shown in FIG 3, which processing can be illustrated in<br>

A complex baseband receiver signal can be modeled in a vector-valued finite-impulse response (FIR) model of the radio channel<br><br>
10<br><br><br>
where, in row vectors, a received signal is x(n) = [xr (n) xr (n)]&gt; a radio channel is k(n)  5=hr(n) hr(n)]» and noise plus interference is v(n) = [vr(n) v,{n)]. The STW processing in accordance with the invention, which utilizes both auto- and cross-correlation properties of the interference from in-phase and quadrature channels, is accomplished by filtering the received signal with a matrix polynomial (where each coefficient is a 2x2 matrix):<br><br>
(1)<br>
(2)<br><br>
In a prior approach using GLS, the matrix coefficients of a whitening filter W\ are obtained by a joint composite channel/matrix coefficients estimation, while in accordance with principles of the present invention, the coefficients are obtained via a <br>
15   much-simpler VNC estimation.<br>
Spatio-temporal colored noise in eqn (1) may be modeled as a Vector-valued <br>
Auto-Regressive (VAR) process. A first order VAR model may be written as<br>
	(3)<br>
where a transfer function A(D) is a matrix polynomial of a delay operator with a <br>
20     leading unit tap, represented in a 2x2 identical matrix,<br>
(5)<br><br><br><br>
is a covariance matrix representing the spatio correlation of the noise from the in-<br>
25	phase and quadrature channels.   Left multiply v\n-k) to eqn (3) and take the <br>
             expectation. Since E{vT(n)e(n)} = Q, E{v\n - m)e(n) = 0, the following Yule-Walkerequations are obtained:<br>

where<br><br><br><br>
is a matrix of auto- and cross-correlations of the noises from the in-phase and <br>
5      quadrature channels. From eqn. (6), the transfer function of a first order spatio-temporal       whitening filter is easily obtained as<br>
	(8)<br>
A lumped VNC approach has a disadvantage that the noise estimation in eqn <br>
(1)	is not accurate, since the quality of the initial channel estimation is poor due to the<br>
10      presence of strong interferences. However, in accordance with principles of the <br>
        present invention, successive first order whitening of the received signal is carried out, as shown in the pseudo-code above. The iteration upgrades the noise samples for each VNC estimation, and thus improves the quality of me whitening filter. After iterative STW processing, the noise is temporally white, and spatio de-correlation is <br>
15	necessary to decorrelate the noise from I and Q channels. The spatio de-correlation          (6) <br>
        may be integrated with the last iteration of the STW by utilizing the Cholesky <br>
        factorization. From the first equation in eqn. (6), the noise correlation matrix may<br>
        be expressed as<br>
	(9)<br>
20          Applying Cholesky factorization to the inverse of the noise correlation matrix,<br>
	(10)<br>
the transfer function of the last STW iteration has the form<br>
.	(11)<br>
The VNC processing starts with an initial estimation of the noise samples. In <br>
25	  accordance with principles of the invention, an estimation of synchronization residue ,<br>
  is    obtained from a three-symbol synchronization procedure. The synchronization is carried      out by correlating a training sequence with a complex received signal:<br>
	(12)<br><br>
The synchronization is determined by a maximum energy accumulation across a span <br>
30            of the propagation channel:<br>

WO 2005/041511<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/011275<br><br><br>
										(13)<br><br>
All of the symbols in the training sequence are used in eqn. (12), disregarding Inter-Symbol Interferences (ISI) caused by the multi-path propagation channel. In the working region of SAIR, the damage of ISI due to inclusion of the leading and tail<br>
5	 symbols of the training sequence in the correlation is outweighed by the estimation <br>
          gain in strong interferences.<br>
The correlation result in eqn. (12) may be also used as a rough channel estimation, which is considered not accurate enough if used in equalization. However, it has been found that, in channels with strong interferences, this rough <br>
10      channel estimation can be used to calculate a better synchronization residue<br><br>
where M denotes the channel span, which is typically limited by the equalizer implemented in hardware. The synchronization residue has been proven to be less biased than the noise estimate obtained by an LS based estimation as in current<br>
15         approaches.<br>
Replacing the estimate of noise by mat of synchronization residue decreases computational complexity only slightly, but can reduce die code size significantly, since a pre-calculated regressor table, which has to be stored for each training sequence and different channel span, in the channel estimation is no longer<br>
20      necessary. Another benefit of utilizing synchronization residue is that the span of the composite channel can be kept constant by adjusting the synchronization position over a three-symbol interval, which grants more freedom in choosing the number of iterations.<br>
In contrast to current approaches, in which a lumped-model estimation is<br>
25         performed in a predetermined order before lumped STW processing, in the process 300, a relaxation approach based on vectorized noise correlation (VNC) is utilized. In the relaxation approach of the process 300, a first-order VNC estimation/STW processing is iterated m times. An algorithm in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention shown in FIG. 3 can be illustrated by the following pseudo-<br>
30          code, in which // represents non-code comments: SairRelaxation (m) {<br>

}<br>
With an integrated synchronization in the iteration control loop, composite<br>
         channel extension is avoided, which permits a SAIR implementation in current <br>
20     receiver architectures in which an equalizer is implemented in dedicated hardware                   that can accommodate only a fixed composite-channel span. The relaxation approach in accordance with the process 300 not only reduces computational complexity significantly, since all matrix operations are limited to 2x2 in dimension, but also results in a much better numerical condition man in a GLS model estimation. Due to <br>
25	improved estimation conditions, the SAIR process 300 has shown improved     performance in channel conditions where background noise is at a realistic level (e.g., <br>
 20dB 
there being too many parameters to be estimated. In contrast, in a relaxation approach <br>
30	in accordance with principles of the invention, the number of parameters to be<br>
estimated is much smaller. The level of interference is reduced and synchronization position adjusted after each iteration, resulting in a better channel estimation. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, noise estimation is replaced<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2005/041511<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/011275<br><br>
by   synchronization  residue  estimation,   which   improves   performance  without increasing computational complexity.<br>
Order-adaptation can easily be introduced into the iteration control loop, since <br>
the iteration control loop is more likely to make a correct decision whether to stop the <br>
5	iteration with updated noise estimation. It is well known mat all forms of whitening <br>
             impair equalizer performance when there is only white noise present due to over-               parameterization. Adaptivity must be introduced to alleviate the impairment In <br>
            accordance with principles of the invention, the order of SAIR is determined by <br>
            the number   of iterations of VNC estimation/STW processing. Thus a "none or all" <br>
10	adjustment may be integrated in the second iteration of the processing. If the STW <br>
          gain, measured by the energy reduction of the synchronization residue, is not great<br>
          enough:<br>
										(15)	<br><br>
STW filtering processing is terminated.   When a determination is made at STW<br>
15	filtering processing is to be terminated, the received signal r is input directly to the <br>
         channel estimate block 206 and the equalizer 108 via the switch 310, which is placed <br>
         in the position shown in FIG. 3, and the switch 306, which is put in a position to <br>
        directly connect the received signal r to the equalizer 108 and the channel estimate <br>
        block 206.    To avoid synchronization residue estimation error due to signal<br>
20  magnitude variation, the matrix coefficients of the STW filter must be normalized. Normalization also reduces the probability of overflow in fixed-point implementations.<br>
Following synchronization adjustment, the updated received signal   r"' is <br>
 output to the channel estimate block 206 and to the equalizer 108 via the switches 306<br>
25	and 310. At the channel estimate block 206, a second n-tap channel estimation is <br>
        performed. Since it is not necessary to take the whitening processing into <br>
       consideration, a   more computationally-efficient LS estimation can be applied directly. <br>
       The n-tap channel estimate h^ is output from the channel estimate block 206 to the <br>
       equalizer 108.   The equalizer 108 estimates data symbols of the transmission and<br>
30     yields the symbol estimate s".<br>

          from the receiver circuitry 432 are converted back into a digital data stream via the<br>
          A/D converter 428. The I and Q digital data stream from the A/D converter 428 is f<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
Method of and apparatus for single antenna interference rejection (SAIR) relaxation. Interference in a received signal is reduced by performing synchronization and whitening of the received signal. The synchronization and whitening includes performing the following steps at least one time: 1) performing a synchronization and vector-noise-correlation estimation of an input signal to yield an interference model; and 2) performing a spatio-temporal whitening operation using the interference model and the input signal to yield an updated received signal. The input signal is the received signal when the step of performing the synchronization and vector-noise-correlation estimation is performed a first time. The input signal is the updated received signal when the step of performing the synchronization and vector-noise-correlation estimation is performed after the first time.<br></td>
