				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
SCROLL-TYPE COMPRESSOR<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a scroll-type compressor, and particularly to<br>
the scroll-type compressor including an adjusting mechanism to adjust a pressing force,<br>
in which an orbiting scroll is pressed against a fixed scroll with the pressing force to<br>
prevent the orbiting scroll from overturning.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Conventionally, a scroll-type compressor as an example of a compressor to<br>
compress a gas refrigerant in a refrigerating cycle has been used. The scroll-type<br>
compressor includes a fixed scroll and an orbiting scroll, which have involute wraps<br>
engaged with each other, in its casing. The fixed scroll is fixed to the casing and the<br>
orbiting scroll is coupled to an eccentric portion of a drive shaft (crank shaft). In the<br>
scroll-type compressor, the orbiting scroll just revolves orbitally to the fixed scroll<br>
without rotating on its own axis, thereby contracting a compression chamber formed<br>
between the wraps of both scrolls to compress a gas such as the refrigerant therein.<br>
A certain compressor of this scroll-type compressor adopts a structure in<br>
which an orbiting scroll (OS) is pressed against a fixed scroll (FS) in the axis direction,<br>
as shown in FIG. 10. A purpose of this structure is to avoid a state occurring, where<br>
a refrigerant leaks and thereby an efficiency is reduced, due to inclination (overturn) of<br>
the orbiting scroll (OS) caused by so-called overturning moment that is produced by an<br>
axis-direction gas load Fz acting on the orbiting scroll (OS) by gas compression and a<br>
radius-direction load Fx which is a resultant force of gas force and centrifugal force.<br>
It is known that the above-described axis-direction gas load Fz and radius-<br><br>
direction load Fx show their highest magnitudes almost at the same time, as shown in<br>
FIG. 11. Specifically, at a crank angle (revolution angle of the orbiting scroll (OS))<br>
where an internal pressure of the compression chamber reaches about its highest<br>
pressure, these loads Fz, Fx become the highest and also the overturning moment M<br>
becomes the highest.<br>
- Problems to be solved -<br>
Herein, it would be necessary that the magnitude of the above pressing force<br>
should be set based on the highest value of the overturning moment in order to prevent<br>
the orbiting scroll (OS) from overturning certainly during the operation of the<br>
compressor. However, just setting the pressing force at a certain magnitude that<br>
could prevent the orbiting scroll (OS) from overturning at the time the overturning<br>
moment shows its highest value would cause an overproduction of pressing force at a<br>
crank angle where the overturning moment is lower than its highest value, resulting in<br>
a lower efficiency due to some machine loss.<br>
Meanwhile, another compressor of this scroll-type compressor adopts a<br>
structure in which refrigerating machine oil with high pressure is plied to a sliding face<br>
constituted of the fixed scroll (FS) and the orbiting scroll (OS), thereby the orbiting<br>
scroll (OS) is pressed back with a force Fo against the above pressing force. For<br>
example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2001-214872 shows an adjusting<br>
structure to adjust the pressing force according to fluctuation of a compression ratio<br>
(or a pressure differential between high-level pressure and low-level pressure) based on<br>
operating conditions of the apparatus. However, this prior art compressor does not<br>
either perform adjusting a pressing-back force according to fluctuation of the above<br>
axis-direction gas load or the overturning moment during the orbital revolution of the<br>
orbiting scroll (OS). Namely, in the above compressor, the pressing-back force is<br>
generated or halted according merely to the magnitude of the compression ratio (or<br>
the high-low pressure differential), and the pressing-back force has constant strength<br><br>
regardless of its crank angle when it is generated. Accordingly, this compressor<br>
cannot cope with the fluctuation of the overturning moment and the like during the<br>
revolution of the orbiting scroll (OS) and thus it cannot make the orbital movement of<br>
the orbiting scroll (OS) stable sufficiently.<br>
The present invention has been devised in view of these problems, and an<br>
object of the present invention is to make the revolution movement of the orbiting<br>
scroll stable by changing the pressing force of the orbiting scroll against the fixed scroll<br>
according to fluctuation of the axis-direction gas load or the overturning moment<br>
during the revolution of the orbiting scroll, thereby improving compression efficiency<br>
of the scroll-type compressor.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the present invention, the above-described pressing force is made stable by<br>
producing a moment to reduce or offset the overturning moment, or by changing a<br>
pressing-back force of the orbiting scroll (26) according to the revolution angle of the<br>
orbiting scroll (26).<br>
Firstly, in the present invention defined in claims 1 through 7, it is constituted<br>
such that the anti-overturning moment to reduce the overturning moment at a certain<br>
crank angle is produced.<br>
Specifically, the present invention defined in claim 1 provides a scroll-type<br>
compressor comprising a fixed scroll (22) that is fixed in a casing (10), an orbiting<br>
scroll (26) that engages with the fixed scroll (22), pressing means (37b, 52) that presses<br>
the orbiting scroll (26) against the fixed scroll (22) in the axis direction, and an<br>
adjusting mechanism (56) that adjusts a pressing force of the orbiting scroll (26)<br>
against the fixed scroll (22).<br>
Further, in the scroll-type compressor, the adjusting mechanism (56) is<br>
constituted such that an anti-overturning moment to decrease an overturning moment<br><br>
acting on the orbiting scroll (26) during its revolution is produced in a revolving-angle<br>
area of the orbiting scroll (26) in which the overturning moment becomes a certain<br>
value or more.<br>
According to the present invention defined in claim 1, the anti-overturning<br>
moment acts on the orbiting scroll (26) that tends to be overturned in the revolving-<br>
angle area in which the overturning moment becomes great during the revolution of<br>
the orbiting scroll (26). This anti-overturning moment: can reduce the overturning<br>
moment, and thus the orbiting scroll (26) can be prevented from overturning even in<br>
the above-described angle area and its stable revolution can be achieved.<br>
Further, the present invention defined in claim 2 provides the scroll-type<br>
compressor of claim 1, wherein the adjusting mechanism (56) is constituted such that<br>
the anti-overturning moment acts in substantially the opposite direction to the<br>
overturning moment in the revolving-angle area of the orbiting scroll (26) in which the<br>
overturning moment becomes the certain value or more.<br>
According to the present invention defined in claim 2, the anti-overturning<br>
acts in a direction in which the overturning moment is offset in the revolving-angle<br>
area in which the overturning moment becomes great. Thus, the orbiting scroll (26)<br>
can be further prevented from overturning and its stable revolution can be further<br>
achieved.<br>
Further, the present invention defined in claim 3 provides the scroll-type<br>
compressor of claims 1 or 2, wherein the adjusting mechanism (56) comprises an oil<br>
groove (55) that is formed at a sliding face constituted between the fixed scroll (22) and<br>
the orbiting scroll (26), and an oil-introduction passage (53) that introduces a high-<br>
pressure oil into the oil groove (55), and the oil groove (55) is constituted such that an<br>
acting point of a high pressure to the orbiting scroll (26) is offset from the center of the<br>
orbiting scroll (26) located in the above revolving-angle area.<br>
According to the present invention defined in claim 3, the acting point of<br><br>
pressing-back force by pressure of the high-pressure oil introduced into the oil groove<br>
(55) is offset from the center of the orbiting scroll (26), and thereby the above-<br>
described anti-overturning moment is produced. Accordingly, when the overturning<br>
moment becomes the certain value or more according to the revolution of the orbiting<br>
scroll (26), the anti-overturning moment produced by the pressure of the high-pressure<br>
oil can reduce the overturning moment. Thus, the revolution of the orbiting scroll<br>
(26) can be made stable. Further, in the revolving-angle area in which the<br>
overturning moment is less than the certain value, the strength of the above-described<br>
pressing force should be set at a proper value so that the orbiting scroll (26) could not<br>
be overturned in the opposite direction by the anti-overturning moment.<br>
Further, in the present inventions defined in claims 4 through 7, shapes of the<br>
oil groove (55) are defined respectively. The present invention defined in claim 4<br>
provides the scroll-type compressor of claim 3, wherein the oil groove (55) is formed<br>
in a circumferential ring shape and formed at the fixed scroll (22) or the orbiting scroll<br>
(26) in such manner that its center is offset from the center of the orbiting scroll (26)<br>
located in the above revolving-angle area.<br>
Further, the present invention denned in claim 5 provides the scroll-type<br>
compressor of claim 3, wherein the oil groove (55) is constituted such that an oil-<br>
pressure acting area at an acting side of the overturning moment is smaller than that at<br>
the opposite acting side of the overturning moment to the center of the orbiting scroll<br>
(26) located in the above revolving-angle area.<br>
Further, the present invention defined in claim 6 provides the scroll-type<br>
compressor of claim 5, wherein the oil groove (55) is formed in a circumferential ring<br>
shape with its center concentric to the orbiting scroll (26), and formed in such manner<br>
that a portion (62) thereof at the acting side of the overturning moment to the center<br>
of the orbiting scroll (26) located in the above revolving-angle area is disconnected.<br>
Further, the present invention defined in claim 7 provides the scroll-type<br><br>
compressor of claim 5, wherein the oil groove (55) is formed in a circumferential ring<br>
shape with its center concentric to the orbiting scroll (26), and comprises a widened<br>
portion (64) with an enlarged width at the opposite acting side of the overturning<br>
moment to the center of the orbiting scroll (26) located in the above revolving-angle<br>
area.<br>
According to the inventions of claims 4 through 7, it is constituted such that<br>
the circumferential ring-shape oil groove (55) is offset from the center of the orbiting<br>
scroll (26) or there exists a difference of area between the acting side and the opposite<br>
acting side of the overturning moment to the center of the orbiting scroll (26). Thus,<br>
the high-pressure oil can produce the anti-overturning moment in the above-described<br>
revolving-angle area, thereby reducing the overturning moment.<br>
Next, in the present inventions defined in claims 8 through 13, it is constituted<br>
such that the pressing-back force of the orbiting scroll (26) is reduced or cut off at a<br>
certain crank angle, respectively.<br>
Specifically, the present invention defined in claim 8 provides, like the present<br>
invention defined in claim 1, the scroll-type compressor comprising a fixed scroll (22)<br>
that is fixed in a casing (10), an orbiting scroll (26) that engages with the fixed scroll<br>
(22), pressing means (37b, 52) that presses the orbiting scroll (26) against the fixed<br>
scroll (22) in the axis direction, and an adjusting mechanism (67) that adjusts a<br>
pressing force of the orbiting scroll (26) against the fixed scroll (22).<br>
Further, in the scroll-type compressor, the adjusting mechanism (67) is<br>
constituted such that it produces a pressing-back force to press back the orbiting scroll<br>
(26) from the fixed scroll (22) against the pressing force, while it cuts off the pressing-<br>
back force in a revolving-angle area of the orbiting scroll (26) in which an overturning<br>
moment acting on the orbiting scroll (26) during its revolution due to gas compression<br>
becomes a certain value or more.<br>
According to the present invention defined in claim 8, as the orbiting scroll<br><br>
(26) revolves to perform the function of gas compression, the overturning moment<br>
acting on the orbiting scroll (26) changes according to its revolution as shown in FIG.<br>
11. And when the overturning moment becomes greater at the certain revolving-<br>
angle area, the pressing-back force by the adjusting mechanism (67) is cut off.<br>
Accordingly, it can be avoided that the resultant force by the axis-direction gas load,<br>
the pressing-back force, and the pressing force produced by the pressing means (37b,<br>
52) becomes less than a minimum of necessary pressing force. Further, applying the<br>
pressing-back force to the orbiting scroll (26) all the time except the above angle area<br>
can prevent the pressing force from becoming too much. Thus, the orbiting scroll<br>
(26) can perform its stable revolution without any overturning or excess compressing.<br>
Further, the present invention defined in claim 9 provides the scroll-type<br>
compressor of claim 8, wherein the adjusting mechanism (67) comprises an oil groove<br>
(55) that is formed at a sliding face constituted between the fixed scroll (22) and the<br>
orbiting scroll (26), and an oil-introduction passage (53) that is capable of being<br>
connected to the oil groove (55) so as to introduce a high-pressure oil into the oil<br>
groove (55), and the oil groove (55) and the oil-introduction passage (53) are<br>
constituted such that their connection is cut off in the revolving-angle area of the<br>
orbiting scroll (26) in which the overturning moment acting on the orbiting scroll (26)<br>
due to gas compression becomes the certain value or more. For example, in the case<br>
where the oil groove (55) is formed at the fixed scroll (22) and the oil-introduction<br>
passage (53) is formed at the orbiting scroll (26), an opening end portion of the oil-<br>
introduction passage (53) orbitally rotates on the circumference having its radius that is<br>
equivalent to the revolving radius of the orbiting scroll (26), and therefore it should be<br>
constituted such that the oil-introduction passage (53) is not connected to the oil<br>
groove (55) only at part of its locus (position of the opening end portion when the<br>
orbiting scroll (26) is in the above-described revolving-angel area), but connected at<br>
other parts of it.<br><br>
According to the present invention defined in claim 9, the pressing-back force<br>
against the pressing force of the orbiting scroll (26) to the fixed scroll (22) occurs at a<br>
state in which the oil-introduction passage (53) is connected to the oil groove (55),<br>
whereas the connection between the oil groove (55) and the oil-introduction passage<br>
(53) is cut off and thereby no pressing-back force occurs in the revolving-angle area in<br>
which the overturning moment acting on the orbiting scroll (26) due to gas<br>
compression becomes the certain value or more. Accordingly, the resultant force by<br>
the axis-direction gas load, the pressing-back force by the high-pressure oil, and the<br>
pressing force by the pressing means (37b, 52) can be made small in the area in which<br>
the overturning moment produced by the gas compression is small, whereas the<br>
resultant force by the axis-direction gas load and the pressing force by the pressing<br>
means (37b, 52) can be made great in the area in which the overturning moment is<br>
great. Thus, switching on and off the pressing-back force by the high-pressure oil<br>
according to the revolving-angle area of the orbiting scroll (26) can achieve stable<br>
revolution of the orbiting scroll (26).<br>
The present invention defined in claim 10 provides, like the present inventions<br>
defined in claims 1 and 8, the scroll-type compressor comprising a fixed scroll (22) that<br>
is fixed in a casing (10), an orbiting scroll (26) that engages with the fixed scroll (22),<br>
pressing means (37b, 52) that presses the orbiting scroll (26) against the fixed scroll<br>
(22) in the axis direction, and an adjusting mechanism (67) that adjusts a pressing<br>
force of the orbiting scroll (26) against the fixed scroll (22).<br>
Further, in the scroll-type compressor, the adjusting mechanism (67) is<br>
constituted such that it produces a pressing-back force to press back the orbiting scroll<br>
(26) from the fixed scroll (22) against the pressing force, while it reduces the pressing-<br>
back force in a revolving-angle area of the orbiting scroll (26) in which an overturning<br>
moment acting on the orbiting scroll (26) during its revolution due to gas compression<br>
becomes a certain value or more.<br><br>
According to the present invention defined in claim 10, as the orbiting scroll<br>
(26) orbitally revolves to perform the function of gas compression, the overturning<br>
moment acting on the orbiting scroll (26) changes according to its revolution as shown<br>
in FIG. 11. And when the overturning moment becomes greater at the certain<br>
revolving-angle area, the pressing-back force by the adjusting mechanism (67) is<br>
reduced. Accordingly, it can be avoided that the resultant force by the axis-direction<br>
gas load, the pressing-back force, and the pressing force produced by the pressing<br>
means (37b, 52) becomes less than a minimum of necessary pressing force. Further,<br>
applying the pressing-back force to the orbiting scroll (26) all the time except the above<br>
angle area can prevent the pressing force from becoming too much. Thus, the<br>
orbiting scroll (26) can perform its stable revolution without any overturning or excess<br>
compressing.<br>
Further, the present invention defined in claim 11 provides the scroll-type<br>
compressor of claim 10, wherein the adjusting mechanism (67) comprises an oil<br>
groove (55) that is formed at a sliding face constituted between the fixed scroll (22) and<br>
the orbiting scroll (26), and an oil-introduction passage (53) that is connected to the oil<br>
groove (55) so as to introduce a high-pressure oil into the oil groove (55), and the oil<br>
groove (55) and the oil-introduction passage (53) are constituted such that an area of<br>
their connection is reduced in the revolving-angle area of the orbiting scroll (26) in<br>
which the overturning moment acting on the orbiting scroll (26) due to gas<br>
compression becomes the certain value or more. For example, in the case in which<br>
the oil groove (55) is formed at the fixed scroll (22) and the oil-introduction passage<br>
(53) is formed at the orbiting scroll (26), an opening end portion of the oil-introduction<br>
passage (53) orbitally rotates on the circumference having its radius that is equivalent<br>
to the revolving radius of the orbiting scroll (26), and therefore it should be constituted<br>
such that a connection area between the oil-introduction passage (53) and the oil<br>
groove (55) is reduced only at part of its locus (position of the opening end portion<br><br><br>
when the orbiting scroll (26) is in the above-described revolving-angel area).<br>
According to the present invention defined in claim 11, the pressing-back force<br>
against the pressing force of the orbiting scroll (26) to the fixed scroll (22) occurs at a<br>
state in which the oil-introduction passage (53) is connected to the oil groove (55),<br>
whereas the connection area between the oil groove (55) and the oil-introduction<br>
passage (53) is reduced and thereby the pressing-back force is reduced in the revolving-<br>
angle area in which the overturning moment acting on the orbiting scroll (26) due to<br>
gas compression becomes the certain value or more. Accordingly, the resultant force<br>
by the axis-direction gas load, the pressing-back force by the high-pressure oil, and the<br>
pressing force by the pressing means (37b, 52) can be made small in the area in which<br>
the overturning moment produced by the gas compression is small, whereas the<br>
resultant force by the axis-direction gas load, the pressing-back force by the high-<br>
pressure oil, and the pressing force by the pressing means (37b, 52) can be made great<br>
by reducing the pressing-back force in the area in which the overturning moment is<br>
great. Thus, reducing the pressing-back force according to the revolving-angle area of<br>
the orbiting scroll (26) can achieve stable revolution of the orbiting scroll (26).<br>
Further, the present invention defined in claim 12 provides the scroll-type<br>
compressor of claim 10, wherein the adjusting mechanism (67) comprises an oil<br>
groove (55) that is formed at a sliding face constituted between the fixed scroll (22) and<br>
the orbiting scroll (26), and an oil-introduction passage (53) that is connected to the oil<br>
groove (55) so as to introduce a high-pressure oil into the oil groove (55), the oil<br>
groove (55) is formed at either one of the fixed scroll (22) and the orbiting scroll (26),<br>
and a low-pressure recess (71) that the oil groove (55) approaches in the revolving-<br>
angle area of the orbiting scroll (26) in which the overturning moment acting on the<br>
orbiting scroll (26) due to gas compression becomes the certain value or more is<br>
formed at the other one of the fixed scroll (22) and the orbiting scroll (26).<br>
Further, the present invention defined in claim 13 provides the scroll-type<br><br><br>
compressor of claim 12, wherein the low-pressure recess (71) is constituted of a notch<br>
that is formed at the fixed scroll (22) or the orbiting scroll (26) so as to connect with a<br>
space having a lower pressure than the inside of said oil groove (55).<br>
According to the present inventions defined in claims 12 and 13, the<br>
revolution of the orbiting scroll (26) makes the oil groove (55) and the low-pressure<br>
recess (71) move in such manner that they approach each other and then are away<br>
from each other during the operation of the scroll-type compressor. Herein, the oil<br>
groove (55) and the low-pressure recess (71) approach each other in the revolving-<br>
angle area in which the overturning moment acting on the orbiting scroll (26) due to<br>
gas compression is more than the certain value, and then it is capable that the high-<br>
pressure oil in the oil groove (55) can be released (leaked) to the low-pressure recess<br>
(71). Thus, the pressure of the oil groove (55) goes down and the pressing-back force<br>
is reduced. Accordingly, in the structure that the orbiting scroll (26) is normally<br>
balanced with the pressing force by pressing back it from the fixed scroll (22), the<br>
pressing-back force can be reduced only at the angle area in which the overturning<br>
moment becomes great, thereby achieving stable revolution of the orbiting scroll (26).<br>
- Effects of the Invention -<br>
According to the present invention defined in claim 1, producing the anti-<br>
overturning moment in the revolving-angle area in which the overturning moment<br>
acting on the orbiting scroll (26) becomes the certain value or more reduces the<br>
overturning moment, and stable revolution of the orbiting scroll (26) becomes possible.<br>
Accordingly, it can prevent the orbiting scroll (26) from overturning without the<br>
leakage of the refrigerant when the overturning moment becomes great, and thus<br>
decease of the operation efficiency can be prevented.<br>
Further, according to the present invention defined in claim 2, the anti-<br>
overturning moment acts in a direction opposite to the overturning moment in the<br>
revolving-angle area in which the overturning moment becomes the certain value or<br><br><br>
more. Thus, the function of the anti-overturning moment to reduce the overturning<br>
moment can be performed efficiently. Accordingly, the revolution of the orbiting<br>
scroll (26) can be made further stable, and thus the decease of the operation efficiency<br>
can be further prevented certainly.<br>
Further, according to the present invention defined in claim 3, the oil groove<br>
(55) is formed at the sliding face constituted between the fixed scroll (22) and the<br>
orbiting scroll (26), the high-pressure oil is introduced into the oil groove (55), and the<br>
acting point of high pressure is offset from the center of the orbiting scroll (26). Thus,<br>
it can produce certainly the anti-overturning moment to reduce the overturning<br>
moment, thereby achieving further stable revolution of the orbiting scroll (26).<br>
Further, according to the present invention defined in claim 4, only offsetting<br>
the circumferential ring-shape oil groove (55) from the center of the orbiting scroll (26)<br>
can perform the above-described function, and thus the structure can be prevented<br>
from being complicated.<br>
Further, according to the present invention defined in claim 5, providing the<br>
difference in the area of the oil groove (55) between the acting side and the opposite<br>
acting side of the overturning moment to the center of the orbiting scroll (26) can<br>
produce certainly the anti-overturning moment to reduce the overturning moment.<br>
Particularly, the structures, in which the portion (62) of the oil groove (55) at<br>
the acting side of the overturning moment to the center of the orbiting scroll (26) is<br>
disconnected according to the present invention defined in claim 6, and the portion<br>
(64) of the oil groove (55) at the opposite acting side of the overturning moment to the<br>
center of the orbiting scroll (26) is widened according to the present invention defined<br>
in claim 7, can reduce the overturning moment with a simple structure to make the<br>
movement of the orbiting scroll (26) stable, thereby improving the operation efficiency<br>
of the compressor.<br>
According to the present invention defined in claim 8, cutting off the pressing-<br><br><br>
back force to act against the pressing force for pressing the orbiting scroll (26) to the<br>
fixed scroll (22) in the revolving-angle area in which the overturning moment acting on<br>
the orbiting scroll (26) due to gas compression becomes the certain value or more can<br>
make the revolution of the orbiting scroll (26) stable without overturning and<br>
producing an excessive pressing force. Thus, the decease of the operation efficiency<br>
can be prevented like the inventions defined in claims 1 through 7.<br>
Further, according to the present invention defined in claim 9, switching the<br>
connection state properly between the oil groove (55) formed at the sliding face of the<br>
orbiting scroll (26) and the fixed scroll (22) and the oil-introduction passage (53)<br>
introducing the high-pressure oil into the oil groove (55) can make it possible to<br>
stabilize the revolution of the orbiting scroll (26). For example, in the case in which<br>
the oil groove (55) is formed at the fixed scroll (22) and the oil-introduction passage<br>
(53) is formed at the orbiting scroll (26), making use of the opening end portion of the<br>
oil-introduction passage (53) rotating on the circumference having its radius that is<br>
equivalent to the revolving radius of the orbiting scroll (26) can provide easily the<br>
structure that the oil-introduction passage (53) is not connected to the oil groove (55)<br>
at part of its locus (position of the opening end portion when the orbiting scroll (26) is<br>
in the above-described revolving-angle area), but connected at other parts of its locus.<br>
And, also the structure can be prevented from being complicated.<br>
Further, according to the present invention defined in claim 10, reducing the<br>
pressing-back force to act against the pressing force for pressing the orbiting scroll (26)<br>
to the fixed scroll (22) in the revolving-angle area in which the overturning moment<br>
acting on the orbiting scroll (26) due to gas compression becomes the certain value or<br>
more can make the revolution of the orbiting scroll (26) stable without overturning<br>
and producing an excessive pressing force. Thus, the decease of the operation<br>
efficiency can be prevented.<br>
Further, according to the present invention defined in claim 11, changing the<br><br><br>
connection state properly between the oil groove (55) formed at the sliding face of the<br>
orbiting scroll (26) and the fixed scroll (22) and the oil-introduction passage (53)<br>
introducing the high-pressure oil into the oil groove (55) can make it possible to<br>
certainly stabilize the revolution of the orbiting scroll (26). For example, in the case<br>
in which the oil groove (55) is formed at the fixed scroll (22) and the oil-introduction<br>
passage (53) is formed at the orbiting scroll (26), making use of the opening end<br>
portion of the oil-introduction passage (53) rotating on the circumference having its<br>
radius that is equivalent to the revolving radius of the orbiting scroll (26) can provide<br>
easily the structure that the oil-introduction passage (53) is connected to the oil groove<br>
(55) at part of its locus (position of the opening end portion when the orbiting scroll<br>
(26) is in the above-described revolving-angel area) through a small connecting area.<br>
And, also the structure can be prevented from being complicated.<br>

high-pressure oil in the oil groove (55) to the low-pressure recess (71) in the area in<br>
which the overturning moment acting on said orbiting scroll (26) due to gas<br>

decrease of the operating efficiency.<br>

notch, as the low-pressure recess (71), formed at the fixed scroll (22) or the orbiting<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
FIRST EMBODIMENT<br>
The first embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference<br>
to the accompanying drawings. A scroll-type compressor (1) according to the first<br>
embodiment compresses a gas refrigerant, being connected to a refrigerating circuit,<br>
not shown in any drawing, which performs a refrigerating-cycle operation with a<br>
refrigerant circulated therein.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the scroll-type compressor (1) includes a casing (10)<br><br><br>
constituted of a sealed dome-type pressure vessel. In the casing (10), a compressing<br>
mechanism (15) to compress the gas refrigerant and a compressor motor (16) to drive<br>
the compressing mechanism (15) are installed. The compressor motor (16) is<br>
disposed below the compressing mechanism (15). The compressing mechanism (15)<br>
and the compressor motor (16) are coupled by a drive shaft (17).<br>
The compressing mechanism (15) includes a fixed scroll (22), a frame (24)<br>
disposed so as to contact to the lower face of the fixed scroll (22) closely, and an<br>
orbiting scroll (26) engaged with the fixed scroll (22). The frame (24) has an airtight<br>
connection with the casing (1.0) at its entire periphery. The casing (10) has also<br>
divided sections therein, a high-pressure space (28) disposed below the frame (24) and<br>
a low-pressure space (29) disposed above the frame (24). The frame (24) is provided<br>
with a frame recess (30) formed at the upper face thereof, a center recess (31) formed<br>
at the bottom face of the frame recess (30), and a bearing portion (32) disposed at the<br>
center of the lower face of the frame (24) to constitute an upper bearing portion. The<br>
bearing portion (32) supports the drive shaft (17) through slide bearings so that the<br>
drive shaft (17) can rotate freely therein.<br>
A suction pipe (19) to introduce the refrigerant of the refrigerating circuit<br>
into the compressing mechanism (15) and a discharge pipe (20) to discharge the<br>
refrigerant in the casing (10) out of the casing (10) casing (10) are coupled to the<br>
casing (10) respectively with airtight connections.<br>
The fixed scroll (22) and the orbiting scroll (26) include respectively end plates<br>
(22a,26a) and involute wraps (22b,26b). At the lower face of the end plate (26a) of<br>
the orbiting scroll (26), a bearing portion (34) that is located inside the frame recess<br>
(30) and the center recess (31) and coupled to the drive shaft (17) is provided. A ring-<br>
shape seal member (36) is disposed outside the bearing portion (34) so as to fit into the<br>
inner peripheral face of the center recess (31). The inside of the frame recess (30)<br>
and the center recess (31) is divided into the first space (37a) disposed outside the sea]<br><br><br>
supply passage (51) is discharged to the oil chamber (52) and respective oil-supplied<br>
portions.<br>
As described above, the refrigerating machine oil with high pressure is<br>
supplied to the oil chamber (52) in the bearing portion (34) of the orbiting scroll (26),<br>
and further the second space (37b) is filled with the gas refrigerant with high pressure.<br>
In the above-described structure, pressing means (37b. 52) to press the orbiting scroll<br>
(26) to the fixed scroll in the axis direction by making use of pressure of the<br>
refrigerating machine oil and the gas refrigerant is constituted. Also, the sliding face<br>
is constituted as a thrust bearing by pressing the end plates (22a,26a) of the both<br>
scrolls (22,26) to each other.<br>
Meanwhile, an oil-introduction passage (53) extending in the radius direction<br>
is formed at the end plate (26a) of the orbiting scroll (26). The oil-introduction<br>
passage (53) is connected to the oil chamber (52) at its inner end, and to the oil groove<br>
(55) disposed at the upper face of the end plate (26a) at its outer end. The<br>
refrigerating machine oil is supplied from the oil chamber (52) to the above-described<br>
sliding face through the oil-introduction passage (53). It is constituted that supplying<br>
the refrigerating machine oil to the sliding face reduces a machine loss of the thrust<br>
bearing.<br>
Further, the oil groove (55) constitutes adjusting means (56) to adjust the<br>
pressing force of the orbiting scroll (26) against the fixed scroll (22) along with the oil-<br>
introduction passage (53). The oil groove (55) is formed at the end plate (26a) of the<br>
orbiting scroll (26), and it is formed at the outer peripheral side of the wrap (26b) in<br>
a circumferential ring shape, as shown in FIG. 2, The oil groove (55) is formed with<br>
its center that is offset from the center of the wrap (26b) of the orbiting scroll (26).<br>
Specifically, the oil groove (55) is constituted such that an anti-overturning moment to<br>
reduce an overturning moment acts in substantially the opposite direction to the acting<br>
direction of the overturning moment (see an arrow mark in FIG. 2) in a revolving-<br><br><br>
member (36) and the second space (37b) disposed inside the seal member (36), by the<br>
seal member (36) that is pressed and contacted closely to the end plate (26a) of the<br>
orbiting scroll (26) by spring means (not shown in any drawing), such as a plate spring.<br>
The frame (24) is provided with an oil-return hole (not shown in any drawing) to drain<br>
refrigerating machine oil collected in the second space (37b) to the lower part of the<br>
frame (24), and the second space (37b) is connected to the lower space of the frame<br>
(24).<br>
The upper end of the drive shaft (17) is inserted in the bearing portion (34) of<br>
the orbiting scroll (26). Meanwhile, the orbiting scroll (26) is coupled to the frame<br>
(24) through an Oldham ring (38) so as to orbitally revolve in the frame (24) without<br>
rotating on its own axis. The lower face of the end plate (22a) of the fixed scroll (22)<br>
and the upper face of the end plate (26a) of the orbiting scroll (26) constitute sliding<br>
face for both faces contacting to and sliding on each other, and a gap between<br>
contacting portions of the wraps (22b,26b) of both scrolls (22,26) is formed as a<br>
compression chamber (40). Here, the compression chamber (40) is contracted toward<br>
the center by the revolution of the orbiting scroll (26), thereby compressing the gas<br>
refrigerant. The gas refrigerant compressed in the compression chamber (40) is<br>
discharged below the frame (24) through a discharge passage, not shown in any<br>
drawing. Thus, the space below the frame (24) constitutes the high-pressure space<br>
(28).<br>
The casing (10) is provided with an oil reservoir (48) at the bottom, and an oil<br>
supply pump (49) is disposed at the lower end of the drive shaft (17) to pump up the<br>
oil in the oil reservoir (48) by the rotation of the drive shaft (17).<br>
A drive-shaft oil-supply passage (51), in which the oil pumped up by the oil<br>
supply pump (49) flows, is formed at the drive shaft (17). Further, an oil chamber<br>
(52) is formed between the drive shaft (17) and the end plate (26a) in the bearing<br>
portion (34) of the orbiting scroll (26), and the oil flowing into the drive-shaft oil-<br><br><br>
angle area in which the overturning moment acting on the orbiting scroll (26) is more<br>
than a certain value during its revolution. Accordingly, the oil groove (55) is<br>
constituted such that an acting point of the high pressure to the orbiting scroll (26) is<br>
offset from the center of the orbiting scroll (26) toward the opposite acting side of the<br>
overturning moment. Thus, the oil groove (55) is positioned so that the portion of<br>
the acting side of the overturning moment is located close to the center of the orbiting<br>
scroll, whereas the portion of the opposite acting side is located far from the center.<br>
Herein, the acting direction of the overturning moment is determined<br>
depending on the following conditions. That is, the orbiting scroll (26) receives the<br>
axis-direction gas load and the radius-direction load that is a resultant force by a gas<br>
force in the direction along the sliding face of the both end plates (22a,26a) and a<br>
centrifugal force, due to the pressure of the gas refrigerant in the compression chamber<br>
(40), and these loads become the maximum at a certain crank angle (revolving-angle<br>
area of orbiting scroll (26)). Because the overturning moment occurs in substantially<br>
the acting direction of the radius-direction load at this time, this direction may be<br>
determined as the one in which the overturning moment acts.<br>
In this way, providing the oil groove (55) that is positioned offset from the<br>
center of the orbiting scroll (26) can make certainly the pressing-back force for the<br>
orbiting scroll (26) against the pressing force, whose acting point is offset from the<br>
center of the orbiting scroll.<br>
Then, in a revolving-angle area in which the pressure of the compression<br>
chamber increases and the overturning moment becomes a certain value or more, the<br>
overturning moment is reduced by the anti-overturning moment. Meanwhile, in a<br>
revolving-angle area in which the pressure of the compression chamber is low and the<br>
overturning moment is smaller than the certain value, the magnitude of the anti-<br>
overturning moment should be determined depending on the relationship with the<br>
pressing force so that the anti-overturning moment does not become an overturning<br><br><br>
moment with the opposite direction. This can prevent the orbiting scroll (26) from<br>
overturning even if the overturning moment is so great that the orbiting scroll (26)<br>
would be easy to overturn, and also the problem that when the overturning moment is<br>
small the anti-overturning moment would act as an overturning moment with the<br>
opposite direction can be prevented.<br>
As a result, it may become possible that the orbiting scroll (26) is pressed<br>
against the fixed scroll (22) all the time with a stable force, thereby achieving a stable<br>
revolution of the orbiting scroll. Accordingly, it can prevent the orbiting scroll (26)<br>
from overturning efficiently and certainly, thereby improving the compression<br>
efficiency certainly.<br>
Further, in the first embodiment, just offsetting the oil groove from the center<br>
of the orbiting scroll can make the movement of the orbiting scroll stable, so that<br>
complicated structure can be avoided.<br>
SECOND EMBODIMENT<br>
The scroll-type compressor (1) according to the second embodiment includes<br>
a different adjusting mechanism (56) from that in the first embodiment. Specifically,<br>
as shown in FIG. 3, the adjusting mechanism (56) has an oil groove (55) with a<br>
different shape from that in the first embodiment. The oil groove (55) is formed in a<br>
circumferential ring shape svith its center concentric to the center of the wrap (26b) of<br>
the orbiting scroll (26), and formed in such manner that a portion (62) thereof at the<br>
acting side of the overturning moment to the center of the orbiting scroll (26) is<br>
disconnected. Thus, the oil groove (55) has almost a C-shape plan view.<br>
Further, the oil groove (55) is formed in an arc shape with a constant width.<br>
A portion of the groove (55), in which no groove is formed at the portion (62) at the<br>
acting side of the overturning moment, is disposed at a side where the overturning<br>
moment acts to the center of the orbiting scroll (26) in the revolving-angle area in<br><br><br>
which the overturning moment acting on the orbiting scroll (26) becomes the certain<br>
value or more.<br>
Herein, descriptions on the same components as those in the first embodiment<br>
will be omitted, getting them the same reference numerals.<br>
In the second embodiment, the oil groove (55) having its C-shape plan view<br>
can certainly offset the acting point of the pressing-back force which the orbiting scroll<br>
(26) receives due to supplying the refrigerating machine oil to the oil groove (55) at the<br>
sliding face, from the center of the orbiting scroll (26).<br>
Further, because the disconnected portion (62) of the oil groove (55) is<br>
disposed at the acting side of the overturning moment in the above revolving-angle<br>
area to the center (59) of the orbiting scroll (26), the pressing-back force by the high<br>
pressure of the refrigerating machine oil can be made small at the acting side of the<br>
overturning moment, and great at its opposite side. As a result, the anti-overturning<br>
moment to reduce the above overturning moment acts in the opposite direction to the<br>
overturning moment. Thus, it can prevent the orbiting scroll (26) from overturning<br>
efficiently and certainly, thereby improving the compression efficiency certainly.<br>
Other functions and effects are the same as those in the first embodiment.<br>
Herein, in the second embodiment, the portion (62) of the oil groove (55) is<br>
disconnected at the acting side of the overturning moment, but instead of that, the<br>
portion may be made narrow and the like, thereby providing a small groove area.<br>
This can also perform functions and effects similar to the above because of the<br>
occurrence of the anti-overturning moment to reduce the overturning moment.<br>
THIRD EMBODIMENT<br>
The scroll-type compressor (1) according to the third embodiment includes a<br>
different adjusting mechanism (56) from those in the first and second embodiments.<br>
Specifically, as shown in FIG. 4, the adjusting mechanism (56) has an oil groove (55)<br><br><br>
with a different shape from those in the first and second embodiments.<br>
The oil groove (55) is formed at the sliding face of the orbiting scroll (26) so as<br>
to be concentric to the center (59) of the orbiting scroll (26). The oil groove (55) is<br>
formed in a circumferential ring shape and provided with a widened portion (64) with<br>
an enlarged width at part of its periphery. The widened portion (64) is positioned at<br>
the opposite side to the acting side of the overturning moment to the center of the<br>
orbiting scroll (26) in a revolving-angle area in which the overturning moment acting<br>
on the orbiting scroll (26) becomes a certain value or more.<br>
Because the widened portion (64) is formed at the circumferential ring-shape<br>
oil groove (55) supplying an oil to the sliding face, the acting point of the pressing-back<br>
force which the orbiting scroll (26) receives due to high-level pressure of the<br>
refrigerating machine oil at the sliding face can be certainly offset from the center of<br>
the orbiting scroll (26).<br>
Further, because the widened portion (64) of the oil groove (55) is formed at<br>
the opposite side to the acting side of the overturning moment to the center (59) of the<br>
orbiting scroll (26) in the above revolving-angle area, the pressing-back force at the<br>
acting side of the overturning moment differs from the one at the opposite acting side<br>
of the overturning moment to the center of the orbiting scroll (26), and thereby anti-<br>
overturning moment with the opposite direction to the overturning moment occurs.<br>
Accordingly, the overturning moment can be reduced when the overturning moment<br>
becomes the certain value or more, and thus the orbiting scroll (26) can be prevented<br>
from overturning efficiently and certainly, thereby improving the compression<br>
efficiency of the compressor certainly.<br>
Other structures, functions and effects are the same as those in the first<br>
embodiment.<br>
FOURTH EMBODIMENT<br><br><br>
The scroll-type compressor (1) according to the fourth embodiment, shown in<br>
FIGS. 5 through 7, includes a different adjusting mechanism (67) from those in the<br>
first through third embodiments. The adjusting mechanism (67) in the fourth<br>
embodiment is constituted such that it produces the pressing-back force to press back<br>
the orbiting scroll (26) from the fixed scroll (22) against the pressing force by the<br>
pressing means (37b,52), while it cuts off the pressing-back force in the revolving-angle<br>
area in which the overturning moment acting on the orbiting scroll (26) due to gas<br>
compression of the gas refrigerant becomes the certain value or more.<br>
The adjusting mechanism (67) comprises the oil groove (55) that is formed at<br>
the sliding face constituted between the fixed scroll (22) and the orbiting scroll (26),<br>
and the oil-introduction passage (53) that can be connected to the oil groove (55) so as<br>
to introduce high-pressure oil into the oil groove (55). The oil groove (55) is formed<br>
at the fixed scroll (22) in a circumferential ring shape, and the oil-introduction passage<br>
(53) is formed at the orbiting scroll (26). A state of connection or non-connection<br>
between an opening (68) of outer end of the oil-introduction passage (53) and the oil<br>
groove (55) is switched depending on revolving angle of the orbiting scroll (26).<br>
Namely, the connection state between the oil groove (55) and the oil-introduction<br>
passage (53) is changed during the revolution of the orbiting scroll (26).<br>
Specifically, the above connection is cut off in the revolving-angle area in<br>
which the overturning moment acting on the orbiting scroll (26) due to the<br>
compression of the gas refrigerant becomes the certain value or more, while the<br>
connection is maintained in other area. In this way, because the present embodiment<br>
is constructed to switch the state of connection or non-connection between the oil<br>
groove (55) and the oil-introduction passage (53), it is necessary that the opening (68)<br>
and the oil groove (55) are formed at the both scrolls (22,26) respectively.<br>
An enlarged portion (69), whose inner periphery projects inwardly, is formed<br>
at the oil groove (55) as shown in FIG. 6. The enlarged portion (69) is constituted of<br><br><br>
an arc with a somewhat larger radius of curvature than a revolving radius of the<br>
orbiting scroll (26).<br>
The opening (68) of the oil-introduction passage (53) is disposed at a position<br>
where it has a repeated state of connection or non-connection with the enlarged<br>
portion (69) of the oil groove (55) at the fixed scroll (22). The opening (68) is<br>
constituted in such manner that it orbitally revolves at the enlarged portion (69) of the<br>
oil groove (55) according to the revolution of the orbiting scroll (26) and its connection<br>
is cut off (OFF) at its certain position during the revolution of the orbiting scroll (26)<br>
where the opening (68) is located outside the enlarged portion (69). The positional<br>
relationship between the above-described opening (68) and the enlarged portion (69)<br>
of the oil groove (55) is constituted in such manner that the connection is cut off and<br>
the occurrence of the pressing-back force by the high-pressure oil stops, in a revolving-<br>
angle area in which the overturning moment acting on the orbiting scroll (26) due to<br>
the compression of the gas refrigerant during the revolution of the orbiting scroll (26)<br>
becomes a certain value or more, thereby producing almost a maximum of power to<br>
separate the both scrolls (22,26) from each other. That is, the above revolving-angle<br>
area is the one in which the pressing force of the orbiting scroll (26) to the fixed scroll<br>
(22) is kept relatively great in order not to overturn the orbiting scroll (26), and the<br>
pressing-back force by the discharge of oil is reduced at this point, as shown in FIG. 7.<br>
According to the scroll-type compressor (1) in the fourth embodiment, the<br>
connection state between the oil groove (55) and the oil-introduction passage (53) is<br>
cut off at the certain position during the revolution. Thus, stopping temporarily<br>
supplying the oil to the sliding face during the revolution can reduce certainly the<br>
pressing-back force acting on the orbiting scroll (26) by the high-pressure oil at the<br>
above certain position.<br>
Also, the pressing-back force by the high-pressure oil is reduced in the<br>
revolving-angle area in which the overturning moment produced by the compression<br><br><br>
of the gas refrigerant becomes almost the maximum. Therefore, the resultant force<br>
by the axis-direction gas load, the pressing-back force, and the pressing force of the<br>
pressing means (37b,52) can be made great. Namely, it can maintain the pressing<br>
force of the orbiting scroll (26) against the fixed scroll (22) at a certain value or more.<br>
As a result, it becomes possible to press firmly the orbiting scroll (26) against the fixed<br>
scroll (22) all the time, and thereby the compression efficiency can be improved<br>
certainly by suppressing the overturning of the orbiting scroll (26) certainly.<br>
Other structures, functions and effects are the same as those in the first<br>
embodiment.<br>
FIFTH EMBODIMENT<br>
The scroll-type compressor (1) according to the fifth embodiment is different<br>
from the fourth embodiment in the structure of changing the connection state between<br>
the oil groove (55) and the oil-introduction passage (53) during the revolution of the<br>
orbiting scroll (26). As shown in FIG. 8, it is constituted such that the connection<br>
area between the opening (68) of the oil-introduction passage (53) and the oil groove<br>
(55) is reduced at a certain position during the revolution.<br>
That is, in the forth embodiment, it is constituted such that the connection<br>
between the opening (68) and the oil groove (55) is cut off in the revolving-angle area<br>
in which the overturning moment by the compression of the gas refrigerant increases<br>
and thereby the minimum of necessary pressing force of the orbiting scroll (26)<br>
becomes great. Meanwhile, in the fifth embodiment, the connection between the<br>
opening (68) and the oil groove (55) is maintained but the area of that connection is<br>
reduced in this revolving-angle area, instead of cutting off the connection fully.<br>
Accordingly, because it can be suppressed in this case that the resultant force<br>
by the axis-direction gas load by the gas refrigerant and the pressing force by the high-<br>
pressure oil becomes too great, the pressing force of the orbiting scroll (26) can be<br><br><br>
maintained at a certain value or more. Thus, it can improve the compression<br>
efficiency certainly by suppressing the overturning of the orbiting scroll (26) certainly.<br>
Other structures, functions and effects are the same as those in the fourth<br>
embodiment.<br>
SIXTH EMBODIMENT<br>
In the scroll-type compressor (1) according to the sixth embodiment,<br>
it is constituted, unlike the fourth and fifth embodiments, such that part of the high-<br>
pressure oil in the oil groove (55) is released to a space at the low-pressure side in the<br>
casing (10) in the revolving-angle area in which the overturning moment acting on the<br>
orbiting scroll (26) due to the compression of the gas refrigerant during the revolution<br>
of the orbiting scroll (26) becomes the certain value or more.<br>
As shown in FIG. 9, an adjusting mechanism (67) comprises the oil groove<br>
(55) that is formed at the sliding face constituted between the fixed scroll (22) and the<br>
orbiting scroll (26), and the oil-introduction passage (53) that is connected to the oil<br>
groove (55) so as to introduce high-pressure oil into the oil groove (55). The oil<br>
groove (55) and the oil-introduction passage (53) are formed at the orbiting scroll (26).<br>
Further, a low-pressure recess (71) that the oil groove (55) approaches in the revolving-<br>
angle area in which the overturning moment acting on the orbiting scroll (26) due to<br>
the compression of the gas refrigerant becomes the certain value or more is formed at<br>
the fixed scroll (22).<br>
The low-pressure recess (71) is constituted of a notch that is formed at the<br>
peripheral edge portion at the sliding face which contacts the orbiting scroll (26).<br>
This notch (71) is constituted such that it connects with the first space (37a) having a<br>
lower pressure than the inside of the oil groove (55). Also, it is constituted such that<br>
the notch (71) approaches the oil groove (55) the closest in the revolving-angle area in<br>
which the minimum of the pressing force necessary for the orbiting scroll (26) due to<br><br><br>
the gas refrigerant during the revolution of the orbiting scroll (22) becomes great.<br>
Thus, when the oil groove (55) of the orbiting scroll (26) approaches the notch (71) of<br>
the fixed scroll (22) and thereby the sliding area between the oil groove (55) and the<br>
notch (71) becomes small, part of the high-pressure oil in the oil groove (55) leaks into<br>
the notch (71) with a lower pressure.<br>
Accordingly, because the pressing-back force that the orbiting scroll (26)<br>
receives from the oil at the sliding face in the above revolving-angle area can be<br>
reduced certainly, it can be prevented that the resultant force by this pressing-back<br>
force and the axis-direction force by the refrigerant compression becomes too great at<br>
this point. Thus, the pressing force of the orbiting scroll (26) against the fixed scroll<br>
(22) can be maintained at the certain value or more and thereby the overturning of the<br>
orbiting scroll (26) can be suppressed certainly, resulting in improving the compression<br>
efficiency certainly.<br>
Other structures, functions and effects are the same as those in the fourth and<br>
fifth embodiments.<br>
OTHER EMBODIMENTS<br>
The above embodiments make use of the high pressure of the refrigerating<br>
machine oil to produce the pressing-back force of the orbiting scroll (26), but other<br>
means such as the high pressure of the gas refrigerant may be applied.<br>
Further, in the above embodiments, letting the high-pressure oil in the oil<br>
chamber (52) and the high-pressure gas refrigerant in the second space (37b) act on the<br>
orbiting scroll (26) constitutes means for pressing the orbiting scroll (26) against the<br>
fixed scroll (22). The pressing means, however, is not limited to this structure, but<br>
any other proper means can be applied.<br>
Further, it is constituted such that the anti-overturning moment is produced in<br>
the first through third embodiments and the pressing-back force of the high-pressure<br><br><br>
INDUSTRIAWRAPPLICABILITY<br>
As described above, the present invention is useful for the scroll-type<br>
compressor.<br><br><br>
oil fluctuates in the fourth through sixth embodiments. However, it can be<br>
constituted such that these two are applied at the same time.<br>
Further, although it is constituted such that the oil groove (55) is formed at the<br>
orbiting scroll (26) in the first through third embodiments, the oil groove (55) may be<br>
formed at the fixed scroll (22) instead. In this case, the oil-introduction passage (53)<br>
is formed in such manner, for example, that it goes through the inside of the fixed<br>
scroll (22) from the frame (24). In the event that the oil groove (55) is formed at the<br>
fixed scroll in the first embodiment, it may be preferably constituted such that the<br>
center of the oil groove (55) is offset from the center of the orbiting scroll (26) located<br>
in the revolving-angle area in which the overturning moment of the orbiting scroll (26)<br>
becomes more than the certain value. Further, in the event that the oil groove (55) is<br>
formed at the fixed scroll in the second and third embodiments, it may be constituted<br>
such that the center of the oil groove (55) coincides with, for example, the center of<br>
the fixed scroll (22).<br>
Further, although it is constituted such that the oil groove (55) is formed at the<br>
fixed scroll (22) and the oil-introduction passage (53) is formed at the orbiting scroll<br>
(26) respectively in the fourth and fifth embodiments, it may be constituted such that<br>
the oil groove (55) is formed at the orbiting scroll (26) and the oil-introduction passage<br>
(53) is formed at the fixed scroll (22) respectively instead. In short, it should be<br>
constituted such that, during the revolution of the orbiting scroll (26), the connection<br>
between the oil-introduction passage (53) and the oil groove (55) is cut off temporarily,<br>
or the connection area between them is reduced.<br>
Further, although it is constituted such that the notch (71) is formed at the<br>
fixed scroll (22), it may be constituted such that oil groove (55) is formed at the fixed<br>
scroll (22) and the notch (71) is formed at the orbiting scroll (26) instead. In short, it<br>
should be constituted such that the notch (71) and the oil groove (55) approach each<br>
other or are away from each other during the revolution of the orbiting scroll (26).<br><br><br>
