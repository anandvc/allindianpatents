				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention pertains to the technical field of<br>
microporous crystalline materials of a zeolitic nature,<br>
useful as adsorbents in organic compound adsorption and<br>
separation processes.<br>
STATE OF THE ART PRIOR TO THE INVENTION<br>
Light olefins are generally obtained by gas oil<br>
catalytic cracking, catalytic cracking in the presence of<br>
water vapour or by means of what is referred to as the<br>
MTO (Methanol to olefins) process. In all of these<br>
processes, mixtures of different hydrocarbons are<br>
obtained which include linear and branched olefins and<br>
paraffins of different molecular weights, said mixture<br>
thus having to be put through distilling processes in<br>
order to obtain pure hydrocarbons. The particular case of<br>
light olefin purification by means of distilling<br>
processes is especially difficult due to the relatively<br>
low boiling points of these olefins and the similarity<br>
thereof with those of the corresponding paraffins. This<br>
is especially true in the case of propylene and propane.<br>
These problems condition the design of the distilling<br>
plants to a mayor degree and inevitably redound in a<br>
high-energy consumption in the olefin-production process.<br>
Nevertheless, short-chain olefin separation has a major<br>
economic impact, given that they are used in different<br>
processes in which a high degree of purity is required.<br>
Specifically, ethylene and propylene are the raw<br>
materials used in the production of plastics and many<br>
other chemical compounds. Hence, ethylene is the base<br>
reagent for the production of polyethylene, ethylene<br>
oxide, chlorovinyl and ethylbenezene, among others.<br>
Propylene is used for the production of polypropylene,<br>
propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, etc.<br><br>
The use of molecular sieves, particularly zeolites,<br>
is known to be useful in the different hydrocarbon<br>
separation processes. Thus, linear paraffins can be<br>
separated from branched ones by using zeolites the<br>
channels of which are accessible by way of windows formed<br>
by 8 tetrahedrons. However, when olefins are present in<br>
the hydrocarbon current, these olefins tend to react on<br>
the acid centres of zeolites, giving rise to<br>
polymerisation products inside the zeolite channels.<br>
These products of larger kinetic diameter cannot diffuse<br>
toward the exterior of the zeolite, causing the blockage<br>
of zeolite pores and therefore reducing the effectiveness<br>
thereof in the separation processes.<br>
The acid properties of zeolites stem from the<br>
presence of trivalent elements in their composition,<br>
which generate a negative charge in the micropore network<br>
which is compensated by cations (generally alkaline,<br>
alkaline-terrous, organic cations or protons) which are<br>
located inside the zeolite channels and cavities. These<br>
compensating cations are responsible for the acid<br>
properties of these materials, particularly when the<br>
cations are protons. In this case, the acid strength of<br>
the zeolites may be compared to that of concentrated<br>
sulphuric acid. The presence of inorganic cations, such<br>
as Na-, K- , Ca2- , etc. generates very weak Lewis-type<br>
acid centres and are responsible for the elevated<br>
hydrophilic properties of these materials, given that the<br>
cations tend to coordinate with water molecules. Thus, in<br>
addition to the olefin polymerisation problems, these<br>
zeolites are seriously limited in their application in<br>
separation processes as a result of their elevated<br>
hydrophilic properties, given that the water present in<br>
the hydrocarbon currents, even in very low<br>
concentrations, tends to be absorbed on the cations<br>
located inside zeolite channels, thus reducing the<br><br>
effective diameter of its pores. This means that, in<br>
separation processes which are carried out with small-<br>
pore zeolites (those having channels with openings formed<br>
by 8 tetrahedrons), they have to be regenerated rather<br>
often or the water eliminated from the hydrocarbon<br>
current.<br>
From what is explained above, it is inferred that<br>
the use of zeolites with channel openings formed by 8<br>
tetrahedrons with a low content in trivalent elements in<br>
their composition would be highly beneficial in olefin<br>
separation processes, given that a double objective would<br>
be achieved. On one hand, the olefin oligomerisation<br>
processes on the inside of the zeolite channels would be<br>
avoided, given that acid centres would not be generated.<br>
On the other hand, these zeolite materials would not have<br>
charge-compensating cations in their channels and would<br>
therefore be highly hydrophobic materials. All thereof<br>
would redound in a major improvement in the efficiency<br>
thereof in processes of separating hydrocarbon currents<br>
or gases containing light olefins, even in the presence<br>
of major amounts of water.<br>
Zeolites can be classified as extra-large, large,<br>
medium or small-pore, depending upon the opening of their<br>
channels. Therefore, small-pore zeolites will have<br>
channels with openings formed by 8 tetrahedrons, whilst<br>
medium-pore zeolites will have 10 tetrahedrons, the<br>
large-pored zeolites having 12 and lastly, the extra-<br>
large-pore zeolites having channels with openings of more<br>
than 12 tetrahedrons.<br>
Zeolite A is a small-pore zeolite which has a three-<br>
dimensional channel system with 0.41 nm opening which<br>
cross one another forming an almost spherical supercavity<br>
measuring 1.14 nm in diameter and a net density of 12.9<br><br>
tetrahedrons/nm3. This structure has an LTA (Linde Type<br>
A) code according to the Atlas of Zeolite Framework Types<br>
(2001) published by the International Zeolite<br>
Association. This porous system imbues this zeolite with<br>
a high adsorbing-capacity, but only molecules of small<br>
kinetic diameter, such as water, nitrogen, oxygen and<br>
linear hydrocarbons, among others, can access the<br>
interior thereof.<br>
This zeolite is generally synthesized with Si/Al<br>
ratios nearing one, the synthesis thereof up to Si/Al<br>
ratios of 3.5, therefore with a high concentration of<br>
cations on the inside thereof, having been described. The<br>
possibility of synthesizing LTA-structure zeolite with a<br>
low aluminium content in its composition and even in<br>
absence thereof has made it possible to obtain materials<br>
which have no acidity and can therefore be used in<br>
separation processes over long periods of time without<br>
undergoing olefin polymerisation reactions on their<br>
interior.<br>
One of the LTA-structure zeolite materials which are<br>
of the properties stated in the immediately preceding<br>
paragraph of particular interest, is that known as ITQ-<br>
29, which is highly hydrophobic, the efficiency thereof<br>
therefore not being reduced in separation processes by<br>
adsorption of water, which is generally present in<br>
hydrocarbon currents. These two properties have a direct<br>
benefit on the separation processes, given that it<br>
lengthens the lifetime of the zeolite and lower<br>
temperatures and shorter activation times are required in<br>
the separation processes of hydrocarbon currents<br>
containing light olefins.<br>
ITQ-29 zeolite is described in Spanish patent<br>
application P200400662 or in PCT/ES20055/000120.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention refers to a method for separating<br>
components of a mixture characterized in that it<br>
comprises:<br>
(a)	bringing into contact of the components of a<br>
mixture selected from:<br>
at least two hydrocarbons,<br>
a mixture containing at least nitrogen and oxygen<br>
at least one hydrocarbon and water,<br>
with an ITQ-29 zeolite material having a T(IV)/ T(III)<br>
ratio of greater than 7, whereby T(IV) denotes one or<br>
more tetravalent elements and T(III) denotes one or more<br>
trivalent elements<br>
(b)	preferential adsorption of one or more of the<br>
components by the ITQ-29 zeolite material and<br>
(c)	recovery of one or more of the components.<br>
According to the invention, in said separation<br>
method, the ITQ-29 zeolite material, which has an LTA<br>
structure, has a T(IV) /T(III) ratio of greater than 7,<br>
in which T(IV) denotes one or more tetravalent elements,<br>
and T(III) denotes one or more trivalent elements. Said<br>
ITQ-29 zeolite material of LTA structure preferably has a<br>
T(IV) / T(III) ratio of greater than 10. Even more<br>
preferably, said ITQ-29 zeolite material of LTA structure<br>
has a T(IV) / T(III) ratio of greater than 50.<br>
Additional preferred embodiments of the method<br>
are those which are carried out with an ITQ-29 zeolite<br>
material of LTA structure which has a T(IV) / T(III)<br>
ratio of greater than 200, and even more preferably with<br>
the ITQ-29 zeolite material of an LTA structure having a<br>
T(IV) / T(III) ratio greater than 2000.<br><br>
The ITQ-29 material can be prepared essentially<br>
as pure silicon dioxide. One particular preferred<br>
embodiment of the method refers to a method such as has<br>
been defined, in which said ITQ-29 zeolite material in<br>
its calcinated form has a composition expressed by a<br>
chemical formula in which at least 75% in weight of the<br>
total composition is silicon dioxide. Even more<br>
preferably, said ITQ-29 zeolite material in its<br>
calcinated form has a composition expressed by a chemical<br>
formula in which at least 90% in weight of the total<br>
composition is silicon dioxide, and in a particularly<br>
preferred embodiment, said ITQ-29 zeolite material has a<br>
composition expressed by a chemical formula in which at<br>
least 98% in weight of the total composition is silicon<br>
dioxide.<br>
The mixture which can be separated into its<br>
components according to the inventive method can be, for<br>
example, a mixture of hydrocarbons containing water.<br>
The mixture of hydrocarbons can contain an olefin<br>
as a component which is preferentially adsorbed, and a<br>
paraffin as a component which is preferentially not<br>
adsorbed.<br>
According to particular embodiments, the mixture<br>
is a mixture of hydrocarbons which comprises one or more<br>
linear olefins and one or more paraffins.<br>
According to additional particular embodiments,<br>
the mixture is a mixture of hydrocarbons which contains<br>
an olefin which is propene and a paraffin which is<br>
propane.<br>
Other embodiments refer to a mixture comprising<br>
an olefin selected from 1-butene, cis-2-butene, trans-2—<br>
butene and mixtures thereof and a paraffin which is n-<br><br>
butane.<br>
The mixture can be one which comprises an olefin<br>
which is one or more n-pentenes and a paraffin which is<br>
n-pentane.<br>
According to additional particular embodiments,<br>
the mixture comprises an olefin which is one or more n-<br>
hexenes and a paraffin which is n-hexane.<br>
The method can also refer to the separation of a<br>
mixture of hydrocarbons which comprises one or more<br>
linear hydrocarbons and one or more branched<br>
hydrocarbons, for example, a mixture of hydrocarbons<br>
which comprises one or more linear olefins and one or<br>
more branched olefins. Said linear, olefin can be the<br>
component which is preferentially adsorbed and the<br>
branched olefin the component which is preferentially not<br>
adsorbed.<br>
The procedure can also refer to the separation of<br>
a mixture of hydrocarbons which comprises one or more<br>
branched olefins and one or more branched paraffins.<br>
According to the method, stage c) can comprise<br>
the recovery of the component which is preferentially<br>
adsorbed, or the recovery of the component which is<br>
preferentially not adsorbed.<br>
The component which is preferentially adsorbed<br>
can be adsorbed by the ITQ-29 zeolite material of LTA<br>
structure in a proportion greater than 70 mg of adsorbate<br>
per gram of ITQ-29 zeolite.<br>
According to particular embodiments of the<br>
method, the mixture is air which is separated into<br><br>
nitrogen and oxygen. The mixture can also be air which<br>
can contain water.<br>
The invention refers to a method such as has been<br>
defined, in which the zeolite material is the 1TQ-29<br>
zeolite with a low content in trivalent elements in its<br>
composition and even without any trivalent elements. This<br>
zeolite of these characteristics has very different<br>
diffusion factors for linear and branched olefins and for<br>
olefins and paraffins, which affords the possibility of<br>
its application in methods for separating said<br>
hydrocarbons. The efficiency of an adsorbent in<br>
separation processes is determined based on the value of<br>
the diffusion factors of the products to be separated,<br>
termed RD.<br>
Another important parameter in the adsorption<br>
properties of the zeolites is their capacity of<br>
adsorption in equilibrium, which can be expressed as<br>
weight of hydrocarbon adsorbed per unit of weight of<br>
adsorbent. The condition of equilibrium is reached when<br>
the amount of adsorbate does not increase over time at<br>
set hydrocarbon pressure and temperature conditions. In<br>
principle, the greater the adsorbing capacity of a<br>
zeolite, the smaller the amount which will be required<br>
for separating a given amount of hydrocarbon mixture.<br>
Thus, in order for a certain separation method to be<br>
feasible at a practical level, it is required that the<br>
zeolites have high RD values and high or moderate<br>
adsorption capacities.<br>
In this invention, it is shown that the ITQ-29<br>
zeolite with a low content in trivalent elements in its<br>
composition and even in absence thereof has different<br>
diffusion rates in the adsorption kinetics of different<br>
hydrocarbons, such as propane/propene, butanes/butenes,<br><br>
pentanes/pentenes, hexanes/hexenes, with adsorption<br>
capacities of greater than 70 mgadsorbate/geolite for all of the<br>
linear aforementioned hydrocarbons at 1000 mbar and 40°C.<br>
Therefore, the ITQ-29 zeolite is a highly suitable<br>
adsorbent for carrying out methods for separating<br>
paraffins from linear olefins.<br>
Likewise, the ITQ-29 zeolite with low content in<br>
trivalent elements in its composition or even in their<br>
absence has an adsorption capacity of less than 10<br>
mgadsorbate/geolite for branched paraffins or olefins under<br>
these same conditions, which also makes the use thereof<br>
possible for methods of separating linear from branched<br>
olefins. Lastly, the ITQ-29 zeolite used in this<br>
invention has a water-adsorption capacity of less than 10<br>
mgadsorbate/geolite, which reveals its hydrophobic nature,<br>
enabling the separation of hydrocarbons in presence of<br>
major amounts of water.<br>
The separation method of this invention implies<br>
that a certain amount of ITQ-29 zeolite material, not<br>
having trivalent cations in the composition thereof or in<br>
a T(IV)/T(III) ratio greater than 7, is brought into<br>
contact with a mixture of gases or liquids, one of which<br>
is the desired one or, to the contrary, is the only<br>
undesired one, and which is preferentially adsorbed to<br>
the interior of the ITQ-29 zeolite. The components of<br>
said mixture may be found in gaseous phase or in liquid<br>
phase. The mixture of hydrocarbons is kept in contact<br>
with the ITQ-29 zeolite material throughout a determined<br>
length of time in order to make it possible for the<br>
adsorption process to take place and, lastly, the<br>
components of the mixture which have not been adsorbed<br>
are removed. The component adsorbed in the ITQ-29 zeolite<br>
is recovered or eliminated, depending upon whether it is<br>
the desired or the only undesired product, by means of<br><br>
techniques such as entraining with another gas or liquid,<br>
temperature increase, evacuation or combination of the<br>
aforementioned methods.<br>
This separation method an also be carried out in<br>
columns, in which case different fronts of products are<br>
obtained according to whether they are retained more or<br>
less strongly by the ITQ-29 zeolitic bed.<br>
The separation conditions will depend upon the<br>
exact composition of the mixture to be separated, but, in<br>
principle, must have an upper limit which corresponds, in<br>
the case of the separation of mixtures comprised of<br>
hydrocarbons, with the start of the thermal cracking<br>
reaction of the hydrocarbons, and its freezing point the<br>
lower limit. Thus, the process of this invention must<br>
preferably be carried out between -100 °C and 300 °C,<br>
more preferably between -30°C and 200°C.<br>
Another embodiment comprising the object of<br>
invention is the use of an ITQ-29 zeolite which has no<br>
trivalent cations in the composition thereof or of a<br>
T(IV)/T(III) ratio of greater than 7 for the separation<br>
of nitrogen and oxygen from air mixtures. Given that the<br>
ITQ-29 zeolite, in particular the aforementioned<br>
embodiments, are characterized by their high hydrophobic<br>
nature, the separation of nitrogen and oxygen from air<br>
mixtures can be carried out in the presence of water.<br>
Below, some examples are provided of the<br>
separating properties of different gases employing ITQ-29<br>
zeolite without aluminium in its composition or with a<br>
T(IV)/T(III) ratio of greater than 7, where T(IV) refers<br>
to tetravalent elements comprised in the structure and<br>
T(III) to the trivalent elements which could<br>
isomorphically substitute other tetravalent elements in<br><br>
the zeolite net. For this purpose, the adsorption<br>
capacity for a variety of linear and branched<br>
hydrocarbons has been determined. The examples described<br>
below are non-limiting with regard to the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1. Preparation of ITQ-29 material in absence of<br>
trivalent elements.<br>
Four grams (4g) of tetra-ethyl-ortho-silicate<br>
(TEOS) are added to 16 g of a solution of 4-methyl-<br>
2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-IH,5H-pyride[3,2,1-ij] quinolinium<br>
hydroxide (ROH) which contains 0.3 equivalents of<br>
hydroxide in 1000 g and 1.75 g of a 25% aqueous tetra-<br>
methyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAOH) solution. The mixture<br>
is left evaporating in stirring until complete<br>
elimination of ethanol from the hydrolysis of TEOS plus<br>
the amount of water necessary to reach the final<br>
composition indicated. Lastly, 0.38 g of a fluorhydric<br>
acid solution (50% HF in weight) is added. The<br>
composition of the gel is:<br>
SiO2 : 0.25 ROH : 0.25 TMAOH : 0.5 HF : 3 H2O<br>
The mixture obtained is placed inside an<br>
autoclave equipped with a polytetrafluorethylene inner<br>
lining and is heated to 135°C for 7 days. The X-ray<br>
diffractogram of the resulting solid indicates that the<br>
ITQ-29 material corresponding to the LTA zeolitic<br>
structure has been obtained. The calcination at 600°C in<br>
air for 3 hours makes it possible to eliminate the<br>
occluded organic species and obtain the purely-siliceous<br>
ITQ-29 material capable of being used in adsorption and<br>
separation methods.<br><br>
Example 2. Water adsorption in ITQ-29 material compared<br>
to commercial CaA zeolite.<br>
The measurement of the water-adsorption capacity<br>
at 25°C in the ITQ-29 material, prepared according to<br>
Example 1, corresponds to 10 mg/g. On the other hand, the<br>
water-adsorption capacity at the same temperature of the<br>
commercial CaA zeolite (Molecular Sieves SA, supplied by<br>
Aldrich) is 260 mg/g, which proves the high degree of<br>
hydrophobicity of the ITQ-29 material.<br>
Example 3. Propene adsorption in ITQ-29 material.<br>
The measurement of the propene-adsorption<br>
capacity of ITQ-29 material, prepared according to<br>
Example 1, at 60°C and 1000 mbar corresponds to 83 mg/g.<br>
Likewise, the value found after conducting 20<br>
adsorption/desorption cycles is of 80 mg/g, which proves<br>
the ITQ-29 material retains its adsorption capacity,<br>
indicating that no oligomerisation processes that block<br>
the zeolite pores take place.<br>
Example 4. Propane and propene adsorption in ITQ-29<br>
material.<br>
Table 1 provides the propane and propene<br>
adsorption capacity values of ITQ-29 material, prepared<br>
according to Example 1, at 1000 mbar and different<br>
temperatures.<br><br><br>
The diffusion factor calculated for the<br>
adsorption of propene at 60°C is of 4.32 x 10-4 s-1 ,<br>
whilst that corresponding to propane at the same<br>
temperature is of 9.82 x 10-6 s-1. Therefore, the factor<br>
of the relative adsorption rates of propene as compared<br>
to propane, denoted by parameter RD,, has a value of 44.<br>
Example 5. Butane, 1-butene and isobutene adsorption in<br>
ITQ-29 material.<br>
Table 2 provides the butane, 1-butene and<br>
isobutene adsorption capacity values of ITQ-29 material,<br>
prepared according to Example 1, at 1000 mbar and<br>
different temperatures.<br><br>
Worthy of special mention based on the results of<br>
the table above is the low isobutene adsorption capacity<br>
compared to 1-butene, which proves the potential of the<br>
ITQ-29 material for separating linear from branched<br>
olefins.<br>
Example 6. Hexane, 1-hexene and 3- methyl pentene<br>
adsorption in ITQ-29 material.<br>
Table 3 provides the hexane, 1-hexene and 3-<br>
methyl pentene adsorption capacity values of ITQ-29<br>
material, prepared according to Example 1, at different<br>
