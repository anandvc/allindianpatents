				<td>This invention relates to vessels that are used for various purposes such as storing. Containers made of metal, plastic or glass are in day to day use in every day life. One of the common problems faced by the user is that the container develops perforations on its bottom wall due to continued wear and tear. Once the container develops perforations on its bottom wall it is no longer useful for storing liquid contents and has therefore to be discarded or used for some other purpose. The available base support members are factory fitted and are difficult to be refitted by the end user. Resilient ring shaped base support members are subject to quick wear and tear. The need is therefore felt for a cheap base support member that can enhance the durability of the container and that can also be renewably fitted by the end user.<br>
The object of this invention is to provide a cheap renewable base support member for containers so that they can be used for a longer time.<br>
Accordingly this invention provides a container with a supporting member for its base, characterized in that said supporting member comprises one or more horizontal C shaped parts made of a synthetic material such as plastic, dimensioned to be provided around the container towards its base, the limbs of the said C or Cs are provided towards their ends with outwardly extending ears and means are provided for fixing the adjoining ears through a fixing member(s) so as to locate and hold the said supporting member on the container towards its base, said C shaped part(s) together with the said means comprising a ring member provided around the container in the fitted position of the supporting member, said supporting member capable of extending to a level below the base of the container in its fitted position on the container.<br>
To aid in weight transmission through the supporting member the base of the supporting member in some embodiments extends under the base of the container in its fitted position. The adjoining ends of the limbs of the two C shaped parts of the supporting member are provided with means for fitting them together between themselves against the lower end of the vessel through fixing members. This means preferably comprises of holed ears provided towards the adjoining ends of the said limbs of the C, said limbs being fitted by bolts (with nuts) or rivets passed through the said holes. If the sidewall of the container is vertically disposed the C shaped parts of the base support member can be expected to remain in position when tightly fitted. Therefore in some embodiments the lower end of said container has a vertically or near vertically disposed side wall extending from the bottom level of the side wall for a height of at least 0.5 cm. Alternatively the side wall of the lower end of said container is provided with an outwardly directed bulge or inwardly directed groove and the<br><br>
said supporting member with a corresponding groove or bulge embracing the said bulge or groove on the container in the fitted position of the supporting member on the container. The said bulge and said groove are usually annular in nature. Such an arrangement is particularly valuable for the cup shaped vessels with a sidewall tapering outwards from the base towards the mouth. Slight differences in the dimensions of similar looking manually made metal vessels are common. If a ring shaped base support member fabricated in a single mould were to be fitted on them, the fitting is likely to be inaccurate in at least a few vessels because of this slight variation in the dimensions. But this poses no problem for the base support member according to the invention wherein slight differences in the circumference of the vessel would not affect the fitting when approximating the limbs of the C shaped supporting member. So a base support member fabricated in a single mould can fit on to vessels of slightly varying base dimensions. As the fitting is done through a sideward clasp of the vessel a comparatively stiff plastic material can be used for making the base support member and there is no need to use a resilient plastic material which would be required if a ring shaped base support member is to be fitted on the bottom of the vessel. The base support member according to the invention comes in handy when a base support member of the desired thickness is to be provided on blow moulded cans and vessels.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
Fig.l: is the side elevation of the container fitted with the base support member according to the invention;<br>
Fig.2: is the sectional elevation of the container shown in Fig.l, the section passing through the plane Z-Z shown in Fig.4;<br>
Fig.3: is the sectional elevation of the container shown in Figs.l to 2, the section passing through the plane Y-Y shown in Fig.4;<br>
Fig.4: is the sectional plan of the container shown in Figs.l to 3, the section passing through the plane X-X shown in Fig.3;<br>
Fig.5: is the sectional elevation of another container fitted with the base support member according to the invention, the section being similar to the one shown in Fig.3.<br>
As shown in the figures 1 to 5 the cup shaped container V is provided with a supporting member S for its base, said supporting member comprising of two separate horizontal C shaped parts made of a synthetic material such as plastic. These C shaped parts are dimensioned to be provided around the container V towards its base. Each C shaped part is provided with holed ears R fitted together by bolts B passed through the said holes and<br><br>
tightened by the nuts N. The fixing members in this embodiment comprise of the said bolts and nuts. Other types of fixing members can also be used. The annular bulge on the outside of the side wall of the container towards its base is engaged by a corresponding groove on the said supporting member and this fastens the supporting member on to the lower end of the container V, as shown in Figs.l to 4. As for the container shown in Fig.5, the lower end of the sidewall of the container is substantially vertical and the supporting member can hold on to the container if simply tightened on the lower end of the container. To prevent undue strain on the supporting member when weight is transmitted, the base J of the supporting member extends under the base of the container as shown in the figures. The base J of the supporting member is provided with the rim I that wears out first thus protecting the base J of the supporting member from wear and tear for a considerable time. A damaged supporting member can be replaced by the end user himself and the container again used for a long time.<br><br><br>
I claim:<br>
1.	A container with a supporting member for its base, characterized in that said supporting member comprises one or more horizontal C shaped parts made of a synthetic material such as plastic, dimensioned to be provided around the container towards its base, the limbs of the said C or Cs are provided towards their ends with outwardly extending ears and means are provided for fixing the adjoining ears through a fixing member(s) so as to locate and hold the said supporting member on the container towards its base, said C shaped part(s) together with the said means comprising a ring member provided around the container in the fitted position of the supporting member, said supporting member capable of extending to a level below the base of the container in its fitted position on the container.<br>
2.	The container as claimed in claim 1, wherein said C shaped part(s) of the supporting member extends under the base of the container in its fitted position.<br>
3.	The container as claimed in claims 1 to 2, wherein said means for fixing the said adjoining ears comprises the provision of holes on the said ears, said limbs of the C or Cs capable of being fitted together by bolts (with nuts) or rivets passed through the said holes.<br>
4.	The container as claimed in claims 1 to 3, wherein additional means are provided for<br>
locating the said supporting member against the lower end of said container.<br>
5.	The container as claimed in claim 4, wherein said additional means comprises the<br>
provision of a vertically or near vertically disposed side wall for the container extending for<br>

capable of being fitted on said vertically or near vertically disposed portion of said<br>
container.<br>
6.	The container as claimed in claim 5, wherein said additional means comprises the<br>
