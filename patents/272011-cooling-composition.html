Cooling composition<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to the flavour industry. It concerns more particularly a novel cooling composition which can be added to flavouring compositions or edible products to impart a cooling effect to the latter. The composition of the invention presents the double advantage of providing a cooling effect while not imparting strong mentholic flavouring notes to the composition to which it is added and it is, besides, entirely natural.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Ingredients capable of providing trigeminal effects, such as cooling effects, constitute compounds of paramount importance in the flavour industry. Cooling agents are usually described as providing cold or cool sensations when contacted with the human body and, in particular, with the mucus membranes of the mouth, nose and throat. These ingredients are widely used in edible products, drinks, dentifrices, gargles, but also in cosmetics, tobacco products, abrasives or lotions. Menthol or (-)-(lR,3R,4S)-3-p-menthanol has been widely described and used as a cooling agent. However, in addition to its cooling effect, the latter compound presents the drawback of having an astringent bitter taste with a typical mentholic aftertaste, in particular when used at high dosages in applications. This property limits its use in compositions or products which have dominant non-minty flavour tonalities, such as fruit flavoured applications.<br>
This particular problem associated with the use of menthol has been already tackled in the prior art. In particular US 6,627,233 addresses the problem of using peppermint oil which mainly comprises menthol, and which imparts peppermint notes in non-peppermint flavoured products. More particularly, this document outlines. that menthol presents strong mentholic flavouring notes and "harsh notes" defined as a bitter, harsh and burning taste. This statement is made within the framework of applications in chewing gums and the document suggests, as a solution to this problem, the use of an association of menthol with menthone and a so-called "physiological cooling agent" selected from the group consisting of menthyl succinate, acyclic carboxamide, menthyl lactate, 3-l-menthoxypropane-l,2-diol, N-substituted p-menthane carboxamide, menthone glycerol ketals and mixtures thereof. However, the latter agents are all artificial<br>
 <br>
WO 2005/099473	2	PCT/IB2005/000951<br>
cooling ingredients, and are consequently of limited use in terms of dosage in particular in confectionery, beverage or savoury applications due to their non-natural status.<br>
Therefore, in view of the existing prior art, there is a need to develop cooling compositions that do not raise legal issues and that can be used in no limited dosages, in a wide range of applications.<br>
The present invention overcomes the above-meationed problems by providing a novel composition which develops excellent cooling sensations without mentholic detrimental notes, said composition being at the same time entirely natural.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention first consists of a natural cooling composition, i.e. a composition capable of imparting a cooling effect to a flavouring composition or to an edible product to which it is added, comprising an association of (-)-(lR,3R,4S)-3-p-menthanol together with (-)-(lR,3R,4S)-8-p-menthen-5-ol or another nature-identical cooling ingredient, and an effective amount of at least one natural extract imparting a trigeminal effect to the composition.<br>
Flavouring compositions and ready-to-consume edible products comprising, together with a flavouring base, a cooling composition as defined above, are also objects of the invention, as well as methods to impart, enhance of modify the cooling effect of a composition or product, comprising the addition of a composition according to the invention to said flavouring composition or edible product.<br>
The first object of this invention is thus a natural cooling composition comprising 0.1 to 49.9% by weight of (-)-(lR,3R,4S)-3-p~menthanol; 0.1 to 49.9% by weight of a nature identical cooling ingredient, in particular (-)-(lR,3R,4S)-8-p-menthen-3-ol; and 0.1 to 49.9% by weight of at least one natural extract capable of imparting a trigeminal effect to the composition. Percentages are given by weight relative to the total weight of the composition.<br>
The compositions object of this invention are advantageously free of any artificial cooling ingredient such as those used in the prior art. The natural status of these compositions prevents them from raising legal issues and consequently allows them to be used in unlimited dosages in a wide range of applications.<br>
Turning to their organoleptic properties, the compositions of the invention provide to the compositions to which they are added an excellent cooling sensation with a long<br>
 <br>
WO 2005/099473	3	PCT/IB2005/000951<br>
lasting effect, devoid of any mentholic aftertaste. Consequently, they can advantageously be used in combination of any type of flavour tonality in particular with fruity-type tonalities.<br>
Therefore, this novel combination of three particular ingredients, in addition to be completely natural, advantageously imparts a cooling effect to the compositions or products to which it is added, while not imparting a strong minty or harsh tonality usually associated with the use of menthol. Besides, the compositions of the invention are acceptable worldwide due to their natural status and can be applied in any kind of application, and not only in menthol type products, which means they can be used in areas as varied as confectionary, pharmaceutical, dairy, soy-based products, beverages or savoury products.<br>
Other benefits and advantages will become apparent through the detailed description and the examples given below.<br>
Menthol is the first essential ingredient of the composition of the invention. Although known to naturally impart mentholic flavouring notes, this ingredient is now advantageously associated with two other specific ingredients, so as to impart a cooling effect, while having its natural tonalities attenuated. Menthol is used in amounts comprised between 0.1 and 49.9% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition.<br>
The second ingredient used in the composition according to the invention, namely (-)-(lR,3R,4S)-8-p-menthen-3-ol, is a nature identical cooling ingredient. It is commercially available under the tradename Isopulegol® Tak Pil or Coolact P® from Takasago. This ingredient is used in the composition of the invention in proportions varying between 0.1 and 49.9% and preferably between 0.1 and 19.9°/© by weight relative to the total weight of the composition. Alternatively to (-)-(lR,3R,4S)-8-p-menthen-3-ol, another cooling ingredient possessing the nature identical status could be used.<br>
The last essential ingredient of the composition is at least one natural extract derived from extraction techniques, with a purity level necessary to impart a trigeminal effect to the composition. What is meant here by trigeminal effect, is a sensation associated with taste or touch senses and which affects the trigeminal nerve. Trigeminal effects encompass sensations such as cooling, refreshing, tingling, salivating, biting, hot, warm, pungent, sweet, sour, astringent and the like for the most used in the food industry. The natural extract suitable for the purpose of the invention is used in proportions varying<br>
 <br>
WO 2(1105/099473	4	PCT/IB2005/000951<br>
between 0.1 and 49.9% and preferably between 0.1 and 19.9% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition. In a particular embodiment the natural extract is selected from the group consisting of jambu oleoresin, jawa galanga oleoresin, maniguette oleoresin or grains of paradise, cardamon oleoresin, ginger oleoresin, pepper oleoresin, sage oleoresin, cubebe and mixtures thereof. These extracts are commercially available.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the ratio between (-)-(lR,3R,4S)-8-p-menthen-3-ol and the natural extract is comprised between 4:1 and 1:6. Preferably, the ratio is comprised between 3:1 and 1:3. For example, it is 1:2. Preferably, the ratio between (-)-(lR,3R,4S)-8-p-menthen-3-ol and the natural extract is comprised between 4:1 and 6:4.<br>
The cooling composition of the invention can advantageously be added to a flavouring composition in order to impart a cooling sensation to the latter. By "flavouring composition", it is meant here a mixture of flavouring ingredients, solvents or adjuvants or current use for the preparation of a flavouring formulation, i.e. a particular mixture of ingredients which is intended to be added to an edible composition to impart, improve of modify its organoleptic properties, in particular its odour, flavour and/or taste. Flavouring ingredients are well known to a person skilled in the art and their nature does not warrant a detailed description here, which in any case would not be exhaustive, the skilled person being able to select them on the basis of his general knowledge and according to the intended use or application and the organoleptic effect it is desired to achieve. Many of these flavouring ingredients are listed in reference texts such as in the book by S. Arctander, Perfume and Flavour Chemicals, 1969, Montclair, New Jersey, USA, or its more recent versions, or in other works of similar nature such as Fenaroli's Handbook of Flavour Ingredients, 1975, CRC Press or Synthetic Food Adjuncts, 1947, by M.B-. Jacobs, van Nostrand Co., Inc. Solvents and adjuvants of current use for the preparation of a flavouring formulation are also well known in the art. They allow flavouring formulations to meet technical requirements, such as stability or tonality persistence. The solvent is most of the time part of a flavouring composition. Solvent currently used in this framework include for instance benzyl alcohol, propylene glycol, triacetine, vegetable oils, ethanol or limonene. The adjuvants, on the other hand, can have many various functions in a flavouring composition. They include for instance stabilizers. Today, the range of products types and product formulations that are flavoured has become so extensive and subjected to frequent changes that an approach made on a product-by-<br>
 <br>
WO 2005/099473	5	PCT/IB2005/000951<br>
product basis and on the definition for each case of the adjuvants that can be used is impractical. This is why a list of adjuvants currently used in flavouring formulations is not given here. However, a skilled person in the art, namely a flavourist is capable of choosing these ingredients as a function of the product to be flavoured and of the nature of the flavouring ingredients contained in the formulation.<br>
On the other hand, the composition of the invention can also be directly added to a ready-to-consume or end-product. In other words, it can either be initially added to a flavouring composition as defined above, the resulting composition being then-added to an end-product, or be added independently of a flavouring composition to an edible product.<br>
The composition of the invention can be used in various forms. In a first embodiment, the mixture of the three essential ingredients is used in liquid form and can thus be added either to a liquid flavouring composition as defined above, or directly to an edible composition.<br>
In a second embodiment, the composition of the invention can advantageously be used in an encapsulated form, i.e. in the form of a solid particulate composition, powder or granules like, which can then be added to other powdered solid ingredients to form a dry blend. Here again, the composition to be encapsulated can either simply consists of the cooling mixture object of the invention, or consists of a more complex flavouring composition comprising the cooling mixture above-defined.<br>
The encapsulation processes by which the composition, of the invention, optionally in admixture with a flavouring composition can be protected, can consist in spray-drying, agglomerating or yet extruding techniques, which techniques lead to matrix-type structures. On the other hand, the process can also consist of a coating encapsulation, such as coacervation and complex coacervation techniques, which lead to core-shell-type structures.<br>
Carrier materials suitable for matrices are wall-forming and plasticizing materials such as mono, di- or trisaccharides, natural or modified starcraes, hydrocolloids, cellulose derivatives, polyvinyl acetates, polyvinylalcohols, proteins or pectins. Example of particularly useful matrix materials include sucrose, glucose, lactose, levulose, fructose, maltose, ribose, dextrose, sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, lactitol, rualtitol, pentatol, arabinose, pentose, xylose, galactose, maltodextrin, dextrin, chemically modified starch, hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, succinylated or hydrolysed starch, agar, carrageenan,<br>
 <br>
WO 2005/099473	6	PCT/IB2005/000951<br>
gum anabic, gum accacia, tragacanth, alginates, methyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, derivatives and mixtures thereof.<br>
On the other hand, coating encapsulation is typically based on the use of thin xerogel carrier systems including gelatin, agar and alginate.<br>
Other suitable carrier ingredients are cited in reference texts such as H. Scherz, Hydrokolloids : stabilisatoren, Dickungs- und Geherxnittel in Lebensmittel, Band 2 der Schriftenreihe Lebensmittelchemie, Lebensmittelqualitat, Behr's VerlagGmbH &amp; Co., Hamburg, 1996. The cited materials are hereby given by way of example and are not to be interpreted as limiting the invention.<br>
The powder or granule form of the cooling composition or flavouring composition containing the cooling mixture of the invention, may advantageously be used for the preparation of powdered edible products.<br>
The compositions of the invention are used to provide cooling sensations to the product to which they are added. The use of a composition of the invention, to impart, enhance or modify the cooling effect of a composition or pioduct to which it is" added is thus an object of the invention.<br>
The cooling compositions of the invention can be used to modify the organoleptic properties of edible end-products belonging to food segments as varied as confectionery, beverages or savoury. More particularly, the composition of the invention can be used in products such as chewing gums, sugar almonds, compressed tablets, hard-boiled candies, chewing candies, and the like for the confectionery field. In the case of beverages, they are suitable to impart cooling effects to carbonated and. non-carbonated beverages, alcoholic beverages and the like, as well as to dairy applications such as milk drinks, acidic with fruit and milk flavoured drinks, yoghurts and the like.<br>
The compositions of the invention are also suitable to impart cooling sensations in savoury applications, such as dry-blended seasonings, spices, soups, cheeses, butter spreads and the like.<br>
These examples should not be interpreted as lirniting the invention. More particularly, the cooling compositions of the invention can easily be used in the fragrance field, in applications wherein it is desired to have a cooling effect, such as in creams, ointments, shampoos, soaps and the like.<br>
 <br>
WO 2005/099473	7	PCT/IB2005/000951<br>
The proportions in which the compositions according to the invention can be incorporated into the aforementioned end-products vary within a wide range of values. These values depend on the nature of the ready-to-consume product and the nature of the flavouring composition used in said product, as well as on the intensity of the cooling effect it is desired to achieve.<br>
In particular, in the case of edible products, wherein the compositions of the invention are added in liquid form, they will be present in amounts typically varying from 0.1 to 10% by weight relative to the total weight of the edible composition to which they are added. When the compositions of the invention are used in an encapsulated form, they are preferably added in proportions typically comprised between 0.1 and 5% by weight relative to the total weight of the edible composition to which they are added.<br>
The invention will now be illustrated by way of the following examples but is not limited to these examples. Temperatures are given in degrees centigrade and abbreviations have the meaning common in the art.<br>

The ingredients mentioned in composition C were mixed together so as to produce a dry-blend. This powder blend was then extruded with water as plasticizer, through a die hole using a twin screw extruder equipped with a cutter knife! allowing to chop the melt at the die exit while it is still plastic. A low water content was needed to guarantee a glass transition above 40°C at constant sample composition.<br>
Each flavouring systems, namely compositions A, B and C respectively, was added to a chewing gum base at flavour iso-load and mixed for 2 minutes with the following dosages:<br>
Sample	Flavour load in	Dosage in<br>
the compositio-n	the application<br>
Composition A	100%	1.00%<br>
CompositionB	100%	1.00%<br>
Composition C	6.40%	0.75%<br>
The chewing gums samples prepared were tested toy 20 panellists. Chewing gum samples flavoured with compositions B and C were identified as imparting a fresher and cooling lemon flavour boosting devoid of iany mentholic note, immediately after first chew. The cooling lemon perception built-up over a total time of 10 minutes chewing. The lasting of cooling sensation provided by chewing gum samples flavoured with compositions B and C was determined to be longer than in chewing gum flavoured with composition A.<br>
Example 1 was repeated with the same chewing gum base composition, but changing the lemon flavour in compositions A, B and C by an orange flavour and then a strawberry flavour respectively. Similar comments were made by the panelists.<br>
Example 2<br>
Comparative example in a hard-boiled candy application<br>
A hard-boiled candy base was used to compare vaxious flavouring systems. Glucose syrup 42 DE (20%) and sucrose syrup 65 Brix (80%) were mixed and heated to 145° in-a copper pan. Then, the pan was removed from the gas frame and placed in a warm water bath.<br>
 <br>
