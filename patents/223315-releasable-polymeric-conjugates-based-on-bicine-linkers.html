THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br><br>
27 JUN 2008<br><br>
FTF.LD  OF THE, INVFVTTON<br>
The present invention relates to branched polymers which are useful in extending the in vivo circulating life of biologically active materials, The invention also relates to conjugates made with the polymers.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Some of the initial concepts of coupling peptides or polypeptides to poly(elhylene glycol) PEG and similar water-soluble poly(alkylene oxides) are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,179,337, the disclosure of wliich is incorporated herein by reference. Polypeptides modified with these polymers exhibit reduced tmmunogenicity/antigenicity and circulate in the bloodstream longer than unmodified versions.<br>
To conjugate poly(alkylene oxides), one of the hydroxyl end-groups is converted into a reactive functional group. This process is frequently referred to as "activation" and the product is called an "activated poly(alkylene oxide)". Other substantially non-antigenic polymers are similarly "activated" or functionalized.<br>
The activated polymers are reacted with a therapeutic agent having nucleophilic functional groups that serve as attachment sites. One nucleophilic functional group commonly used as an attachment site is the E-amino groups of lysines. Free carboxylic acid groups, suitably activated carbonyl groups, oxidized carbohydrate moieties and mercapto groups have also been used as attachment sites.<br>
Insulin and hemoglobin were among the first therapeutic agents conjugated. These relatively large polypeptides contain several free e-amino attacliment sites. A sufficient number of polymers could be attached to reduce irnmunogenicity and increase the circulating life without significant loss of biologic activity.<br>
Excessive polymer conjugation and/or conjugation involving a therapeutic moiety's active site where groups associated with bioactivity are found, however,<br><br>
often result in loss of activity and thus therapeutic usefulness. This is often the case with lower molecular weight peptides which have few attachment sites not associated with bioactivity. Many non-peptide therapeutics also lack a sufficient number of attachment sites to obtain the benefit of polymeric modification.<br>
One suggestion for overcoming the problems discussed above is to use longer, higher molecular weight polymers. Depending on the molecular weight desired, however, these materials can be difficult to prepare and expensive to use. Further, they sometimes provide little improvement over more readily available polymers.<br>
Another alternative suggested is to attach two strands of polymer via a t 1/2 azine ring to amino groups of a protein. See, for example, Enzyme, 26,49-53 (1981) and Proc. Soc. Exper. Biol. Med., 188,364-9 (1988). Triazine, however, is a toxic substance which is difficult to reduce to acceptable levels after conjugation. In addition, triazine is a planar group and can only be double-polymer substituted. The planar structure rigidly locks the two polymer chains in place. This limits the benefits of polymer conjugation to about the same as that obtained by increasing polymer chain length. Thus, non-triazine-based activated polymers would offer substantial benefits to the art<br>
In the above-mentioned cases, however, the biologically active polymer conjugates were formed having substantially hydrolysis-resistant bonds (linkages) between the polymer and the parent biologically-active moiety. Thus, long-lasting conjugates which are permanently linked rather than prodrugs per se (where the parent molecule is eventually liberated in vivo) were prepared.<br>
Commonly assigned U.S. Pat Nos. 5,643,575, 5,919,455 and 6,113,906 disclose additional improvements relating to multiple-strands of PEG sharing a common point of attachment to a nucleophile via an aliphatic linker. Unlike the earlier triazine-based branched polymer conjugates, the aliphatic linkers allow the artisan to avoid the toxicities of triazine as well as provide other useful advantages.<br>
In addition, over theyears, several methods of preparing prodrugs have also been suggested. Prodrugs include chemical derivatives of a biologically-active parent compound which, upon administration, will eventually liberate the active<br><br>
parent compound in vivo. Use of prodrugs allows the artisan to modify the onset and/or duration of action of a biologically-active compound in vivo. Prodrugs are often biologically inert or substantially inactive forms of the parent or active compound. The rate of release of the active drug is influenced by several factors including the rate of hydrolysis of the linker which joins the parent biologically active compound to the prodrug carrier.<br>
Some prodrugs based on ester or phosphate linkages have been reported. In most cases, the particular type of ester linkage used to form the prodrug provides t 1/2 for hydrolysis of up to several days in aqueous environments. Although one would expect a prodrug to have been formed, most of the conjugate is eliminated prior to sufficient hydrolysis being achieved in vivo. It would therefore be preferable to provide prodrugs which have a linkage which allows more rapid hydrolysis of the polymer-drug linkage in vivo so as to generate the parent drug compound more rapidly.<br>
Prodrugs based on amide or carbamate linkages have also been reported. In<br>
general, amide bonds are known to be highly resistant to hydrolysis. However, it<br>
has recently been found mat the C-terminal amides of €-amino acids are readily<br>
hydroryzed at 25°C and pH 7.4 when the N-terminus is N-hydroxyethylated with<br>
one or two hydroxyethyl groups. Bis N-2-hydroxyethyl glycine (bicine) type<br>
molecules are key to such hydrolysis reactions. Such bicine type groups have<br>
recently been employed in the synthesis of prodrugs, see commonly assigned U.S.<br>

There is still room for improvement in the area of prodrucing design The<br>

and R1 and R2 preferably comprise residues of this formula.<br>
The degree of polymerization for the polymer (x) can be from about 10 to about 2,300. This represents the number of repeating units in the polymer chain and is dependent on the molecular weight of the polymer. The (J) moiety is a capping group as defined herein, i.e. a group which is found on the terminal of the polymer and, in some aspects, can be selected from any of NH2, OH, SH, C02H, C1-6 alkyls or other PEG terminal activating groups, as such groups are understood by those of ordinary skill.<br>
Also useful are polypropylene glycols, branched PEG derivatives such as those described in commonly-assigned U.S. Patent No. 5,643,575 (the '575 patent), "star-PEG's" and multi-armed PEG's such as those described in Shearwater Corporation's 2001 catalog "Polyethylene Glycol and Derivatives for Biomedical Application". The disclosure of each of the foregoing is incorporated herein by reference. The branching afforded by the '575 patent allows secondary or tertiary branching from the bicine group as a way of increasing polymer loading on a biologically active molecule or enzyme from a single point of attachment It will be understood that the water-soluble polymer can be functionalized for attachment to the bifunctional linkage groups if required without undue experimentation.<br>

See also commonly-assigned U.S. Patent No, 6,153,655, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. It will be understood by those of ordinary skill that the same type of activation is employed as described herein as for PAO's such as PEG. Those of ordinary skill in the art will further realize that the foregoing list is merely illustrative and that all polymeric materials having the qualities described herein are contemplated and that other polyalkylene oxide derivatives such as the polypropylene glycols, etc. are also contemplated.<br>
The polymers of the present invention can also be copolymerized with bifunctional materials such as poly(alkeylene glycol) diamines to form interpenetrating polymer networks suitable for use in permeable contact lenses, wound dressings, drug delivery devices and the like. The steric limitations and water solubility of such branching will be readily recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art. Preferably, however, the molecular weight of multiple branched polymers should not exceed 80,000 daltons.<br>

A chief advantage of the invention is that the artisan can control the rate of hydrolysis or release of the biologically active moiety or drug from the polymeric bicine platform. Depending on the specific linkers selected, one of ordinary skill can modify the compounds to manipulate the rate of hydrolysis. This preferred aspect of the invention allows the artisan to regulate the rate at which the biologically active moiety is delivered to the intended target, m situations where it would be desirable to have a quick release of the biologically active moiety or drug, incorporation of the L3 and L4 linkers provide for an enhanced rate of hydrolysis, In contrast, to the earlier bicine based polymer platforms disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application 10/218,167 wherein the release of the moiety or drug from the platform often depends on conditions such as pH or the presence of enzymes, the linkers L3 and L4 by virtue of anchimeric assistance, are able to substantially enhance the rate of at which the biologically active moiety or drug is released from the polymeric platform independent of the pH conditions or the presence or absence of enzymes. In the presence of enzymes, however, the rate<br><br><br>
of hydrolysis will be controlled by either the anchimeric assistance when applicable or by the enzymatic reactions whichever is faster. Accordingly, the rate of hydrolysis is highly dependent on the type of linkers used between the bicine moiety itself and the PEG portion. The invention thus allows for both permanent and releasable linkers to be used interchangeably on either arm of the bicine . moiety, so long as at least one of the arms incorporates the releasable linker portions L1-I3 or L2-L4.<br>
D.	7, MOTETIES AND FUNCTION<br>
In one aspect of the invention Z is L5-C(=Y4) wherein L5 is a bifunctional linker selected from among the group which defines L1 and L2, and Y4 is selected from among the same groups as that which defines Y1-3. In this aspect of the invention, the Z group serves as the linkage between the A group and the remainder of the bicine transport form.<br>
In other aspects of the invention, Z is a moiety that is actively transported into a target cell, a hydrophobic moiety, and combinations thereof. Although Z is preferably monovalent, Z can optionally be bivalent or multivalent so to allow attachment of more man one A group to the bicine-based polymer. In order to achieve the active transport, Z can include an amino acid, peptide residue, or polyamine residue, such as any of those described above with regard to Li and L2, a sugar residue, a fatty acid residue, a Ce-is alkyl, a substituted aryl, a heteroaryl, —C(=O), -C(=S) or -C(=NR29), wherein R29 is H, lower alkyl, etc.<br>
This aspect of the invention is broadly based upon the principle that biologically active materials suitable for incorporation into the bicine-polymer-based prodrug conjugates may themselves be substances/compounds which are not active after hydrorytic release from the bicine-linked composition, but which will become active after undergoing a further chemical process/reaction. With this embodiment, a therapeutic or diagnostic agent, peptide, polypetide, etc. that is delivered to the bloodstream by the bicine-based polymer system, will remain inactive until entering or being actively transported into a target cell of interest,<br><br>
whereupon it is activated by intracellular chemistry, e-g., by an enzyme or enzyme system present in that tissue or cell.<br>
The prodrugs of this aspect of the invention are prepared so that in vivo hydrolysis of the bicine-polymer-based conjugate cleaves the conjugate so as to release the active biological material (designated A herein) into extracellular fluid, while still linked to the Z moiety. The biologically active materials in this aspect of the invention are preferably, but not exclusively, small molecule therapeutic and/or diagnostic agents. For example, one potential Z-A combination is leucine-doxorubacin, another is amino acid-linked camptothecin or paclitaxel and the tissue to be treated is tumor tissue.<br>
Without intending to be bound by any theory or hypothesis as to how the invention might operate, it is believed that, depending upon the additional moiety selected as a transport enhancer, the rate of transport of a biologically active material into tumor cells is by the delivery of a biologically active material into extracellular tissue pace, e.g, of a tissue exhibiting an EPR effect, in a protected and/or transport-enhanced form.<br>
In a further still option, the transport enhancer (Z) is selected from among known substrates for a cell membrane transport system. Simply by way of example, cells are known to actively transport certain nutrients and endocrine factors, and the like, and such nutrients, or analogs thereof, are readily employed to enhance active transport of a biologically effective material into target cells. Examples of these nutrients include amino acid residues, peptides, e.g, short peptides ranging in size from about 2 to about 10 residues or more, simple sugars and fatty acids, endocrine factors, and the like.<br>
Short peptides are, for example, peptides ranging from 2 to about 10, or more, amino acid residues, as mentioned supra. In this embodiment of the invention, it is believed that such peptide transport enhancers need not be hydrophobic, but are thought to function in other ways to enhance uptake and/or to protect the linked small molecule agents from premature hydrolysis in the general bloodstream. For instance, peptide transport enhancers, such as, for example polyarginine, and other transport enhancers of similar molecular weight ranges, are<br><br>
thought to sterically hinder cleavage from the biologically active agent by plasma-based hydrolytic enzymes, but are then cleaved within a target cell by various peptides and/or proteases, such, as cathepsins.<br>
In certain preferred aspects Z is a hydrophobic moiety. Without meaning to be bound to any theory or hypothesis as to how hydrophobicity contributes to efficacy, it is believed that a hydrophobic moiety inhibits the extracellular cleavage of the transport enhancer away from the active biological agent, by inhibiting the attack of hydrolytic enzymes, etc. present in the extracellular tissue space, e.g., in the plasma. Thus, some preferred transport enhancers include, e.g, hydrophobic amino acids such as alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, proline, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophane, as well as non-naturalry occurring derivatives, such as, y-amino acid, and analogs thereof, as mentioned supra.<br>
In a further option, the transport enhancer is a hydrophobic organic moiety. Simply by way of example, the organic moiety is a C6-18 or larger, alkyl, aryl or heteroaiyl-substituted or nonsubstituted.  The organic moiety transport enhancer is also contemplated to encompass and include organic functional groups including, e.g, -C(=S) and/or -C(=0).<br>

polymer bicine derivative described above with one equivalent of the blocked primary amine bicine derivative.<br>
H.        TN  VIVO DIAGNOSTICS<br>
A further aspect of the invention provides the conjugates of the invention optionally prepared with a diagnostic tag linked to the transport enhancer described above, wherein the tag is selected for diagnostic or imaging purposes. Thus, a suitable tag is prepared by linking any suitable moiety, e.g, an amino acid residue, to any art-standard emitting isotope, radio-opaque label, magnetic resonance label, or other non-radioactive isotopic labels suitable for magnetic resonance imaging, fluorescence-type labels, labels exhibiting visible colors and/or capable of fluorescing under ultraviolet, infrared or electrochemical stimulation, to allow for imaging tumor tissue during surgical procedures, and so forth. Optionally, the diagnostic tag is incorporated into and/or linked to a conjugated therapeutic moiety, allowing for monitoring of the distribution of a therapeutic biologically active material within an animal or human patient.<br>
In a still further aspect of the invention, the inventive tagged conjugates are readily prepared, by art-known methods, with any suitable label, including, e g, radioisotope labels. Simply by way of example, these include I31Iodine, 125Iodine, 99mTechnetium and/or n Indium to produce radioimmunoscintigraphic agents for selective uptake into tumor cells, in vivo. For instance, there are a number of art-known methods of linking peptide to Tc-99m, including, simply by way of example, those shown by U.S. Patent Nos. 5,328,679; 5,888,474; 5,997,844; and 5,997,845, incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Broadly, for anatomical localization of tumor tissue in a patient, the conjugate tag is administered to a patient or animal suspected of having a tumor. After sufficient time to allow the labeled immunoglobulin to localize at the tumor site(s), the signal generated by the label is detected, for instance, visually, by X-ray radiography, computerized transaxial tomography, MRI, by instrumental detection of a luminescent tag, by a photo scanning device such as a gamma camera, or any other method or instrument appropriate for the nature of the selected tag.<br><br>
The detected signal is then converted to an image or anatomical and/or physiological determination of the tumor site. The image makes it possible to locate the tumor in vivo and to devise an appropriate therapeutic strategy. In those embodiments where the tagged moiety is itself a therapeutic agents, the detected signal provides evidence of anatomical localization during treatment, providing a baseline for follow-up diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.<br>
I.	METHODS OF TREATMENT<br>
Another aspect of the present invention provides methods of treatment for various medical conditions in mammals. The methods include administering to the mammal in need of such treatment, an effective amount of a prodrug, such as a doxorubicin-bicine linked-PEG conjugate, which has been prepared as described herein. The compositions are useful for, among other things, treating neoplastic disease, reducing tumor burden, preventing metastasis of neoplasms and preventing recurrences of tumor/neoplastic growths in mammals.<br>
The amount of the prodrug administered will depend upon the parent molecule, e.g. peptide, polypeptide, protein, enzyme, etc. included therein. Generally, the amount of prodrug used in the treatment methods is that amount which effectively achieves the desired therapeutic result in mammals. Naturally, the dosages of the various prodrug compounds will vary somewhat depending upon the parent compound, rate of in vivo hydrolysis, molecular weight of the polymer, etc. Those skilled in the art will determine the optimal dosing of the prodrug selected based on clinical experience and the treatment indication. Actual dosages will be apparent to the artisan without undue experimentation.<br>
The compositions of the present invention can be included in one or more suitable pharmaceutical compositions for administration to mammals. The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a solution, suspension, tablet, capsule or the like, prepared according to methods well known in the art It is also  contemplated that administration of such compositions may be by the oral and/or parenteral routes depending upon the needs of the artisan. A solution and/or suspension of the composition may be utilized, for example, as a carrier vehicle for<br><br>
injection or infiltration of the composition by any art known methods, e.g., by intravenous, intramuscular, subdermal injection and the like.<br>
Such administration may also be by infusion into a body space or cavity, as well as by inhalation and/or intranasal routes. In preferred aspects of the invention, however, the prodrugs are parenterally administered to mammals in need thereof/*<br>

EXAMPLE 21 PROTEIN CONJUCTION Materials and Methods<br>
Chicken egg white lysozyme (EC 3.2.1.17), fysozyme substrate bacteria {Micrococcus lysodeikticus), and PBS buffer (10 mM phosphate, pH 7.4,138 mM NaCl, and 2.7 mM KC1) were purchased from Sigma Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Pre¬cast Tris-glycine SDS electrophoresis gel and the gel running buffer were obtained from Savitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Rat plasma used to measure in vitro hydrolyses of the conjugates was processed in EDTA and stored frozen. 1L-2 was purchased from PeproTech (Princeton, NJ), and GFP was obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto,<br><br>
CA). All in vivo measurements were done in triplicate, and a standard deviation of ±5 % was found for in vitro measurements. Preparation of Single PEG-lysozyme Conjugates<br>
Lysozyme from chicken eggs has a molecular weight of 14,500 and 6 lysine residues. With fast stirring, the activated PEG powder, at a reaction molar ratio of 1:1 (PEG:lysozyme), wa.s added to a lysozyme solution of 5 mg/mL in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.3. After stirring for 45 min at 25 °C, the reaction was treated with 0.2 M sodium phosphate (pH 5.1) to a final pH of 6.5. The reaction mixture was dialyzed against 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 5.1, at 4 °C, using 6,000-8,000 MW cutoff membrane. The sample conductivity after dialysis should be less than 2 mS. The isolation of single PEG-lysozyme was performed on a cation exchange column (pQros, HS) using a solvent system of 20 mM sodium phosphate at pH 5.1 with a NaCl gradient. The peak of single PEG-lysozyme was collected and concentrated using the ultrafree centrifugal filter device with 10k NMWL membrane (Miliprone Corp., Bedford, MA). The yield of the purified single PEG-lysozyme was about 20-30 %. Preparation of Multi PEG-Lysozyme Conjugates<br>
With fast stirring, the activated PEG linker at a reaction molar ratio of 30:1 (PEGrlysozyme) was adtfed to a lysozyme solution of 5 mg/mL in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.3. After stirring 45 min at room temperature, the reaction was treated with 0.2 M sodium phosphate (pH 5.1) to final pH of 6.5. The reaction mixture was diluted with H20 and separated on Hiload Superdex 200 column at 1 mL/min. The column buffer contains 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8) and 140 mM NaCl. The fractions of the peak were pooled and concentrated using the ultrafree centrifugal filter device with 30k NMWL membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The yield of the purified multi PEG-lysozyme was about 85 % and the PEG number per lysozyme molecule as analyzed by fluormetric assay was found to be 5-6.<br><br>
Concentration Determination<br>
PEG-lysozyme conjugate concentration was determined by UV using an extinction coefficient of 2.39 mL/mg.cm at 280 nm in 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.3. Enzyme Activity Assay for Lysozyme<br>
Under the reaction conditions mentioned above, lysozyme activity disappeared after conjugation with only a single PEG. The release of the lysozyme was indicated by regeneration of the lysozyme activity under various release conditions and confirmed on SDS electrophoresis gel. In a typical lysozyme activity assay, 0.2 mL of 0.02 % (w/v) M. lysodeikticus (substrate) was added to 0.12-0.24 ug of lysozyme in 50 uL 66 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.2 containing 0.01 % BSA, in a 96-well titer plate. The absorbance at 450 nm was followed for 5 min. The rate of decrease in absorbance was used as a measure of enzyme activity. One unit of enzyme activity produces a change of 0.001 absorbance units/min at 25 "Cat 450 nm. Release of Lysozyme in Rat Plasma and in Chemical Buffer<br>
PEG-lysozyme conjugates in phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, underwent buffer exchange with PBS, pH 7.4, to monitor release in rat plasma. The stability in PBS at 37 °C was measured. The conjugates also underwent buffer exchange with H2O for the release in Tris buffer, pH 8.5. CentriCon 10 K centrifuge tube (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) was used for the single PEG-lysozyme conjugates while CentriCon 30K was used for the multi PEG-lysozyme conjugates. The release of lysozyme from single or multi PEG-lysozyme conjugates was conducted at 0.15 mg/mL, under N2. At the time indicated, an aliquot was withdrawn, neutralized with 0.2 M phosphate (pH 5.1) to pH 6.5, and stored at -20 °C until further analysis.<br><br>
