It is known in the art to provide a gear box coupled to the engine through the cluch system to obtain different speed of the vehicle as per the requirement by the driver. The gear boxes used are for example sychnromesh gear box, constant sliding mesh gear boxes, pneumocyclic or epicyclic gear box. A transmission booster disclosed in the patent no. 162739 for use between the output shaft of the conventional gear box and the transmission shaft of said vehicle comprises a booster housing having an input and output shaft disposed therein. A pinion or driving gear is provided at the inner end of the input shaft and is connected to a first driven step up gear mounted on a counter/lay shaft a first drive gear is mounted on the lay shaft and drivingly connected to a low ratio gear mounted on the output shaft. A second drive gear is mounted on said lay shaft and is connected drivingly to a high ratio gear mounted on the output shaft. A sliding dog clutch mounted in the housing for engaging at any one instance<br>
said low ratio gear or the high ratio gear with the output shaft. Bearing are provided in the said housing<br>
for supporting said counter/lay shaft within the housing. Partition wall is provided in the housing for<br>
supporting the input shaft and the lay shaft.<br>
There   are disadvantages  associated  with transmission  booster as such known in the art.  One  of the  main disadvantage is that the outer bearing of  the pinion shaft is failed due  to lack of lubrication.<br>
Yet  another disadvantage is that due to  the partition wall provided in the housing between the input shaft  and output shaft the accessbility to  repair  the device is cumbersome and difficult.<br>
Still another disadvantage is that the device is very heavy.<br>
Another disadvantage is that the firm fitting of the gears on the couter shaft produces noise and wear and tear to the gears is more.<br>
Yet another disadvantage is that no means are provided to keep the zero error in the alignment of input and output shaft which is required to keep the zero error in the alignment of these shaft.<br>
Still  another disadvantage is that no  means are  provided with the booster to show that the  vehicle is running at a high ratio condition unnecessarily.<br>
Therefore the main object of this  inventiron is to provide an auto transmission energy booster having oil  feeding  means to the outer bearing  of  the  input shaft  by  driling the  oil feeder passage in  the  main housing and outer bearing housing for the supply of  the lubrications oil  to the outer  bearing  of  the  input shaft.<br>
Still another object of this invention is  to provide an auto transmission energy booster and  wherein the partition wall togetehr with the middle bearings has been totally eliminated.<br>
Another  object  of  this  invention  is   to provide an energy booster wherein the gears are provided on  the counter/lay  shaft  on  spilens with  spacers provided between the gears.<br>
Yet another object of this inventin is to provide a booster having spigot fitment provided within the housing to support the inner ends of the input and output shafts.<br>
Another object of this invention, is to provide male and female means to support the inner end of the input and output shaft independantly.<br>
Another abject of this invention is to provide an auto transmission energy booster wherein the gears are provided in a constant mash relationship.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide an energy booster having the means to give signals in the drivers cabin regarding the unwaranted running of the vehicle in the high ratio condition.<br>
According to this invention there is provided an auto transmission energy booster for use with a vehicle between the output shaft of a gear box and transmission shaft of the vehicle comprising input and output shafts disposed in the housing of the booster, a driving/pinion gear being provided on the inner end of said input shaft such that, to be engaged with a driven step up gear splined fitted on the counter/ lay shaft, a<br>
a first drive gear splined fitted on the said counter/lay shaft being provided such that to be engaged with a low ratio gear fitted on the inner end of the output shaft in a floating relationship, a second drive gear being splined fitted on said lay shaft such that to be connected with a high ratio gear fitted on the output shaft in a floating relationship, characteised in that synchronizing means being provided between the low ratio and high ratio gear to engage the output shaft with said low ratio or high ratio gear, signal means being provided to give warning to the driver regarding unwaranted running of the vehicle in the high ratio condition, lubricating means being provided with the top cover of the booster for providing lubricating oil supply to the bearing provided for supporting the outer end of the input shaft, a spigot bearing means provided for inner ends of the input and output shafts to maintain the zero error in the alignment of said shafts rotating independently with each other.<br>
In accordance with this invention an auto transmission energy booster has an input and output shafts disposed in a housing rotatably. A ...<br><br>
pinion/driving gear having a stopper coller integral to it is secured at the inner end of the input shaft. The<br>
pinion gear is adapted to be engaged with a step up driven gear splined fitted on the counter/lay shaft.<br>
Specifically  according  to  this   invention means such as splashed oil collection and feeding  scoop<br>
is provided with the top cover of the booster housing such that to provide the lubricating oil supply to the<br>
bearing provided for supporting the outer end of the input shaft through the oil feeder passages. Further a<br>
spigot bearing arrangement is provided between the mating ends of the input and the output shaft to keep<br>
such shaft in the alignment and rotation of the shafts independently. An air breather is provided with the top<br>
cover of the boosters housing. Further the partition wall provided between the gears has been eleminated<br>
according to this invention. Further a synchronizer has been provided between the low ratio and high ratio gears<br>
fitted on the output shaft in a floating rotationship to get high speed and the low speed of the vehicle<br>
respectively. Signal means are provided to give warning to the driver regarding the unnecessary running of the vehicle in the high ratio condition.<br>
An auto transmission energy booster according to  a  preferred  embodiment  is  herein described  and illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein: Fig. i shows the sectional view of the energy booster.<br>
Referring  to the drawings the energy booster comprises  a  power input shaft 1 disposed in  an  input shaft housing 2 secured at one side of the housing 3 of the  boaster.  Bearings 4 and 5 are provided to  support the  input  shaft 1.  A pinion/driving gear &amp;  having  a caller 7 is splined fitted at the inner end of the input shaft  1 such that to be engaged with a driven  step up gear  S splined fitted on a counter /lay shaft 9  disposed within the lower portion of the housing 3 of the booster rotatably.   A first drive gear 1O is splined fitted on the  counter  shaft 9 such that to be engaged  with  low ratio gear  11  mounted on the output shaft  12  in  a floating  relationship  by means of floating  bush  12A. The  output shaft 12 is supported on the other  side of the housing 3 by means of bearing 12.  An oil seal 14 is provided  for bearing 13.  The outer end of  the  output shaft  12 is extended into the oil seal housing  15.   A second  drive gear 16 is splined fitted on  the  counter shaft.     9   and   is    drivingly    connected.<br>
