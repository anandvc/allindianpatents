PROCESS FOR THE ISOMERIZATION OF METALLOCENE COMPOUNDS<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the conversion of the meso or meso-like form of a metallocene compound to the corresponding racemic or racemic-like form. The meso or the meso-like form to be subjected to the process of the invention can be admixed with the corresponding racemic (rac) or racemic-like form.<br>
Metallocene compounds are well known complexes, mainly used as catalyst components for the polymerization of olefins. Processes for the synthesis of such metallocene compounds tend to produce mixtures of racemic and meso form. Usually the racemic form produces stereoregular polymers while the meso form is inactive or produces low molecular weight atactic polymers. The racemic form is therefore the most used as polymerization catalyst component. Consequently it is desirable to obtain from the synthesis the racemic (rac) form or a mixture where the racemic form is predominant in order to reduce the work for the physical separation of the two isomers. EP 819 695 describes a process for the modification of the rac/meso ratio of a rac/meso mixture of a stereorigid bridged metallocene compounds by subjecting the mixture to a selective decomposition in the presence of compounds having either acidic hydrogen atoms or reactive halogen atoms, such as water, methanol, chlorotrimethylsilane. With this process, one isomeric form is decomposed with a consequently lowering of the overall yield of the process.<br>
WO 00/017213 describes an isomerization process in which the meso form or a mixture of racemic and meso form of a bridged metallocene compound is contacted with a Group 1 and/or 2 metal halide isomerization catalyst1 in a liquid medium. This process has the drawback that the elimination of the metal halide from the reaction mixture could be complicated.<br>
Organometallics 1998, 17, 1946-4958 describes a series of reactions in which rac-dimethylsilyl(l,3-diisopropylcyclopentadienyl)scandium allyl is isomerized to a rac/meso mixtures by using different isomerization catalysts. Among all (n-C7H15)4NCl and (n-C7H15)4NBr are used. This isomerization reaction is obviously not useful for an industrial process which target is to obtain the rac isomer. Moreover, on page 4953 of this document it is stated that the isomerization is discouraged for metallocenes of group 4, thus creating a prejudice in using this kind of reaction with metallocene compounds in which the central metal belongs to group 4 of the periodic table of the elements.<br><br><br><br><br>
The bridged metallocene compounds of group 4 of the Periodic Table of the Elements<br>
having C% or C2-Iike symmetry have two bridged cyclopentadienyl moieties linked to the<br>
central metal atom trough a n bond. The central metal atom is zirconium, titanium or<br>
hafnium, preferably zirconium.<br>
For the purpose of the present invention, the term "C2 symmetry" means that in the<br>
metallocene compound two isomeric forms are possible, the racemic and the meso forms.<br>
These isomeric forms are well known in the art for example they are cited in Chem. Rev.<br>
2000,100, 1253-1345.<br>
For the purpose of the present invention, the term "C2-like symmetry" means that in the<br>
metallocene compound two isomeric forms are possible, the racemic-like and the meso-<br>
like form.<br>
"Racemic-like form" means that the bulkier substituents of the two cyclopentadienyl<br>
moieties on the metallocene compound are on the opposite sides with respect to the plane<br>
containing the zirconium and the centre of the cyclopentadienyl moieties as shown in the<br>
following compound.-<br><br><br>
racemic-like form<br>
Conversely meso-like form means that the bulkier substituents of the two cyclopentadienyl moieties on the metallocene compound axe on the same side with respect to the plane containing the zirconium and the centre of the cyclopentadienyl moieties as shown in the following compound.<br><br><br>
meso-Iike form<br>
With the process of the present invention the meso or meso-like form of one or more bridged metallocene compounds of group 4 of the Periodic Table of the Elements having C2 or C2-like symmetry can be used alone or in a mixture comprising the racemic or rac.emic-like form.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the process of the present invention is carried out in an aprotic solvent, either polar or apolar. Said aprotic solvent can be an aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbon, optionally halogenated or optionally containing heteroatoms belonging to the group 16 of the periodic table, or an ether. Preferably it is selected from the group consisting of benzene, toluene, pentane, hexane, heptane, cyclohexane, dichloromethane, chlorobenzene, diethylether, tetrahydrofiiran, 1,2 dimethoxyethane N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide or mixtures thereof. Preferably the process of the present invention is carried out in the presence of one or more ethers such as tetrahydrofuran or 1,2 dimethoxyethane; more preferably the solvent contains at least 5% by volume of one or more ethers.<br>
The process of the present invention can be carried out at a temperature ranging from 0°C to a temperature below the temperature of decomposition of the bridged metallocene<br><br>
compound in the selected solvent, usually up to 180°C. Preferably the process of the<br>
present invention is carried out at a temperature ranging from 10°C to 150°C, more<br>
preferably from 30°C to 90°C, even more preferably from 40°C to 90°C.<br>
The reaction time depends on the temperature, on the wished degree of isomerization, on<br>
the metallocene to be used. Generally it ranges from 0.1 hour to 65 hours, preferably from<br>
1 hour to 24 hours. The skilled in the art can easily select the reaction time in view of the<br>
results to be obtained.<br>
The process of the present invention can be advantageously carried out in an inert<br>
atmosphere, i.e. in the absence of oxygen, water or any other compounds able to<br>
decompose the metallocene.<br>
The molar ratio between the isomerization catalyst and the metal of the bridged<br>
metallocene compound is preferably comprised between 0.01 to 300; more preferably the<br>
ratio is from 0.01 to 100, even more preferably from 0.1 to 10; particularly preferred ratio<br>
range is from 0.2 to 5.<br>
With the process of the present invention it is possible to convert at least part of the meso<br>
or meso-like form to the racemic or racemic-like form of a bridged metallocene compound.<br>
This allows to improve the final yield in term of the racemic or racemic-like isomer of the<br>
whole process for synthesising the target metallocene compound. The removal of the<br>
isomerization catalyst and the final purification of the racemic or racemic like isomer can<br>
be carried out according to the procedure commonly used in the art.<br>
The process of the present invention can be used as such or it can be part of a one-pot<br>
process for obtaining metallocene compounds starting from the ligands, such as the<br>
processes described in EP 03101268.5;  WO  03/057705;  WO  99/36427  and WO<br>
02/083699.<br>

sample of the resulting solution (or slurry) showed that the rac/meso ratio of the metallocene was substantially improved in favour of the rac isomer. The latter was also isolated in higher yields compared with the yields achieved by using standard procedures. The rac/meso ratios were determined by NMR analysis. The proton spectra of metallocenes were obtained on a Bruker DPX 200 spectrometer operating in the Fourier transform mode at room temperature at 200.13 MHz, The samples were dissolved in CD2C12 (Aldrich, 99.8 atom % D); preparation of the samples was carried out under nitrogen using standard inert atmosphere techniques. The residual peak of CHDCI2 in the !H spectra (5.35 ppm) was used as a reference. Proton spectra were acquired with a 15° pulse and 2 seconds of delay between pulses; 32 transients were stored for each spectrum.<br><br>
