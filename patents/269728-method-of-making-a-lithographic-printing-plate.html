				<td>METHOD FOR MAKING A LITHOGRAPHIC PRINTING PLATE [DESCRIPTION]<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for making a lithographic printing plate wherein an image-wise exposed precursor is developed with an alkaline developing solution comprising a compound having at least two onium groups. The present invention relates also to an alkaline developing solution and to a replenishing solution comprising said compound having at least two onium groups. The present invention relates also to a lithographic printing plate precursor wherein the coating comprises said compound having at least two onium groups.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Lithographic printing typically involves the use of a so-called printing master such as a printing plate which is mounted on a cylinder of a rotary printing press. The roaster carries a lithographic image on its surface and a print is obtained by applying ink to said image and then transferring the ink from the master onto a receiver material, which is typically paper. In conventional lithographic printing, ink as well as an aqueous fountain solution (also called dampening liquid) are supplied to the lithographic image which consists of oleophilic {or hydrophobic, i.e. ink-accepting, water-repelling) areas as well as hydrophiiic for oleophobic, i.e. water-accepting, ink-repelling) areas. In so- calied driographic printing, the lithographic image consists of ink- accepting and ink-abhesive {ink-repelling) areas and during driographic printing, only ink is supplied to the master.<br>
Printing masters are generally obtained by the iinage-wise exposure and processing of an imaging material called plate precursor. A typical positive-working plate precursor comprises a hydrophiiic support and an oleophilic coating which is not readily soluble in an aqueous alkaline developer in the non-exposed state and becomes soluble in the developer after exposure to radiation. In addition to the well known photosensitive imaging materials which are suitable for UV contact exposure through a film mask (the so- <br>
called pre-sensitized plates), also heat-sensitive printing plate precursors have become very popular. Such thermal materials offer the advantage of daylight stability and are especially used in the<br>
-called cor;pj-er-to-plate m.ethod (CtP) wherein the elate precurso^i.^ is directly exposed, i.e. without the use of a film mask. The rr.aterial is exposed to heat or tc infrared light and the generated heat triggers a (physico-)chemical process, such as ablation, polymerization, insolubilization by cross-linking of a polymer or by parti cl e coagulation of a therm.oplastic polymer latex, and solubi]ization by the destruction of intermolecular interactions or by increasing the penetrability of a development barrier layer.<br>
Although some of these thermal processes enable plate rriaking without, wet processing, the miost popular thermal plates form an image by a heat-induced solubility difference in an alkaline developer between exposed and non-exposed areas of the coating. The coating typically comprises an oleophilic binder, e.g. a phenolic resin, of which the rate of dissolution in the developer is either reduced (negative working) or increased (positive working) by the image-wise exposure. During processing, the solubility differential leads ro the removal of the non-image (non-printing) areas of the coating, thereby revealing the hydrophilic support, while the image iprinring) areas of the coating remain on the support.<br>
Typically, for a positive-working thermal plate, a dissolution inhibitor is added to a phenolic resin as binder whereby the rate of dissolution of the coating is reduced. Upon heating, this reduced rate of oissolution of the coating is increased on the exposed areas compared with the non-exposed areas, resulting in a sufficient difference in solubility of the coating after image-wise recording by heat or IR-radiation. Many different dissolution inhibitors are known and disclosed in the literature, such as organic compounds having an aromatic group and a hydrogen bonding site or polymers or surfactants comprising siloxane or fluoroalkyl units.<br>
The known heat-sensitive printing plate precursors typically comprise a hydroiohilic support and a coating which is alkali-soluble in exposed areas [positive worxing material; or in non-exposed areas inegaoive working m.aterial) and an IR-absorbing compound. Such coating typically comprises an oleophilic polymer which may be a ohenolic resin such as novolac, resol or a polyvinylphenolic resin. The phienclic resin can be chemically modified whereby the phenolic .Tionomeri c ur.i t is substi tuted by Â£ group such as described in WO&amp;9/01795, EP 934 822, EP 1 C72 432, US 3,929,486, EP 2 102 443, EP 2 1C2 44^, EP 2 102 445, EP 2 102 446. The phenolic resin can also oeen laixsd v;it.h other polymers such as an acidic pclyvinyi acetal as described in WC2004/020484 or a copolymer comprising sulfonamide groups as described in US 6,143,454. The use of other pclymeric tinders in lithographic printing plates are described in VJC2001/09682, EP 933 682, WO99/63407, W02002753626, EP 1 433 594 and E? 1 439 058.<br>
The positive-working thermal plate may further comprise, between the heat-sensitive recording layer and the support, an intermediate layer comprising an alkali soluble resin. This intermediate layer can improve the chemical resistance of ^he plate against press chemicals. This layer induces an improved removing of the coating on the exposed areas. Typical examples of positive- working thermal plate materials having such a two layer structure are described in e.g. EP 864420, EP 909657, EP-A 1011970, EP-A 1263590, EP-A 1268660, EP-A 1D72432, EP-A 1120246, EP-A 1303399, EP- A 1311394, EP-A 1211065, EP-A 1368413, EP-A 1241003,EF-A 1299238, E?-A 12 62318, EP-A 1275498, EP-A 1291172, W02003/74287, WG2004/33206, EP-A 14 33594 and EP-A 14 39058. However, in the non- exposed areas of these plates the resistance of the coating for the alkaline developer is poor whereby the difference in dissolution rate oetween the exposed and non-exposed areas is insufficient, i.e. the non-exposed areas are partially affected by the developer before ihe exposed areas are completely dissolved in the developer. As a result, it is difficult to form highly sharp and clear images, particularly highlights, i.e. fine images comprising a dot pattern or fine lines, are difficult to be reproduced.<br>
In a high quality plate it is advantageous that such highlights can be reproduced within a sufficient developing latitude, i.e. small fluctuations in developing time does not substantially affect the image formed on the plates and this developing latitude is obtained when the difference in dissolution rate is improved.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an aspect of the present invention to provide a method for making a heat-sensirive lithographic printing plate whereby excellent printing properties are obtained and whereby the developing latitude or exposure latitude are improved. This object is realized by the method defined in claim 1, having the characteristic feature that the developing solution in the developing step comprises a coiripound having at least two oniuru groups.

The biockinc agent can oe present in the heat-sensitive coating, an intermediate layer between the support and the heat-sensitive coating, a top layer ind/or a layer on the back side cf the plate.<br>
Developing solution<br>
The aqueous alkaline developing solutiÂ®n (hereinafter also referred to as "developer") may comprise an alkaline agent. The composition of said aqueous alkaline solution can be selected from conventional alkaline developers,<br>
The aqueous alkaline developing solution of the present invention has preferably a pH value of at least 10, more preferably of at least 11.5, most preferably of at least 12. There is no specific upper limit for the pH but the pH is usually not higher chan 14 .<br>
The alkaline agent includes inorganic alkaline agents such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, sodium zertiary phosphate, potassium tertiary phosphate, ammonium tertiary phosphate, sodium secondary phosphate, potassium secondary phosphate, aminonium secondary phosphate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, ammonium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate, ammonium bicarbonate, sodium borate, potassium borate and ammonium borate, and potassium citrate, sodium citrate and the Mke.<br>
The alkaline agent may also include organic alkaline agents such as monomethylamine, dimethylam.ine, trimethylamine, monoethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, monoisopropylamine, diisoDropvls:[^.ine, triisopropylamine, n-butylamine, monoethanolamine, diethanolami ne, triethanolairiine, monoisopropanolamdne, diiscpropanoiamine, ethylenediamine, pyridine and the like.<br>
The alkaline aqueous soluzion may also Include an alkaline silicate. The alkaline silicate may be those exhibiting an alkalinity '/;nen dissolved in water, and examples thereof include an <br>
?.lkali metal silicate and alkali metal ine-asilicate such as sodium silicate, sodium nietasilicate, potassium silicate and lithiuir! silicate, and anmioniuni silicate. Said alkaline silicate mav be used,,,. =:lc;ne, or ir. combination.<br>
The devalopment performance of the alkaline aqueous solution" iiiay be easilv moaulated by adjuscing a molar ratio of alkaline siiicaces and alkali metal hydroxides, represented by sij icon oxide iSiO;;.'; and an alkali oxide (M2C, wherein M represents an alkali inetal or an arpinonium. group) . The alkaline aqueous solution has preferably a mciar ratio Si02/M20 from 0.;. to 3.0, and more preferably from 1.0 tc 2.0. When the molar ratio Si02/M20 is less than 0.5, alkalinity of the solution strengthens so as to cause a harmful effect such as etching of an aluminum plate w.hich is generally used as a substrate in a lithographic printing plare precursor. When the molar ratio, 3i02/M20 is more than 3.0, the development performance of the solution may be degraded.<br>
The concentration of alkaline silicate in the developer ranges generally from 1 to 14% by weight, preferably from 3 to 14% by weight, and more preferably from 4 to 14% by weight. When said concentration is less than 1% by weight, the development performance or treatment capacity may be degraded. When said concentration is more chan 14% by weight, precipitared materials or crystals may be easily generated, and gelation may be easily caused during neutraJization of waste liquid, resulting in an obstacle to the â waste disposal.<br>
The developer based on an alkaline aqueous solution may also comprise a nonreducing sugar. The nonreducing sugar denotes sugars having no reductive property due to the absence of a free aldehyde group or a free ketone group. Said nonreducing sugar is classified into trehalcse-type oligosaccharides wherein a reductive group and another reductive group make a linkage; glycosides wherein a reductive group in a sugar is linked to a non-sugar compound; and sugar alcohols which are produced by reducing a sugar by nvarog&amp;nation. Said trehalose-zype oligosaccharides include sucrose and trehalose, and said glycosides include alkyl glycosides, phenol glycosides, mustard oil glycosides and the like. Said sugar alcohols incluoe D, I.-arabitol, ribitol, xylitol, D, L-sorbitol, D, L-mannitol, :;,I-;dicol, talitol, dulcitol, allodulcitol and the like. Further, malticol obtained by hydrogenacion of disaccharide, a reduced !T,Â£-eriai obtained by hydroger.at.ion cf oligosaccharide (a reduced 5zarch syrup? and the like are preferably used. In rhe abov^e ^ nonreducing sugar, preferred are sugar alcohols and sucrose, and particularly preferred are D-sorbicol, sucrose and a reduced starch syrup, since they have buffering action in appropriate pH range.<br>
"he above nonreducing sugar rr.ay be used alone or in combination v.'ith other ingredients, and the concentration thereof in the developer ranges generally frorr, 0.1 to 30% by weight, and preferably from 1 to	by weight.<br>
In the developer, an alkaline agent may be used as a base in combination with the above mentioned alkaline silicate or nonreducing sugar, and said alkaline agent may be selected from sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. Further, sodium tertiary phosphate, potassium tertiary phosphate, sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate are also preferable, since they have themselves, buffering action. The above alkaline agent may be used alone or in combination.<br>

To perforrri development processing stably for a long time period, it is particularly important to control the strength of elkaii and the concentration of silicates and other ingredients in the developer. Therefore, a replenishing solution, hereinafter also referred to as replenisher, is added to the developing solution, usually in small amounts such that a stable development processing can be performed over a long time period without exchanging the developer. Therefore, it is also important that the concentration of the blocking agent of the present invention is present in the developing solution at a sufficiently high level in order to maintain the developing latitude or exposure latitude of the precursor and this can be realised by adding a replenishing solution comprising the blocking agent of the present invention.<br>
For regeneration, the replenishing solution, hereinafter also referred to as repienisher, preferably comprises active ingredients of the developing solution such as alkaline agent.

rspier.ishers may contain aifferenr types in different amoun-cs of blocking agents of the presen- invention, and also different types in cjifferent amounts of other coinpounds for improving ^he a e51 o p rri e n ^ processing.<br>
I'n a mere preferred eiribodiment of the present invention, the fres:^ cieveioping solution at starting the development processing for the first time is essentially free of the blocking agent of the present invention and during or after processing precursors, a replenishing solution, containing a blocking agent of the present invention, is added to the developing solution and/or a layer of the precursor, comprising a blocking agent of the present invention, is removed at least partially in "ne developing solution.<br>

A preferred support is a metal support such as aluminum or stainless steel. The metal can also be laminated to a plastic layer, e.g. polyester film.<br>
h particularly preferred lithographic support is an electrochemically grained and anodized aluminum support. Graining and anodization of aluminum is well known in the art. The anodized aluminum support may be treated to improve the hydrophilic<br>
roperties of its surface. For example, the aluminum support may he siiicated by treating its surface with a sodium silicate solution at<br>
Isva^-C-d temperature, e.g. 9 5Â°C. Alternatively, a phosphate treatment may be applied which involves treating the aluminum oxide surface with a phosphate solution that may further contain an inorganic fluoride. Further, the aluminum oxide surface miay be rinsed with a citric acid or citrate solution. This treatment may be carried out at room temperature or may be carried out at a <br>
slightly elevat-Sd temperature or about 30 to SCc. A further interesting treatment involves rirising the aluminum o^cide surface v.'i th a Dicaroonate solution.

The coating preferably comprises an infrared absorbing agent and an alkaline soluble oleophilic resin whereof the solubility in an alkaline developing solution is reduced in the coating and whereof the solubility in an alkaline developing solution is increased upon heating or lP-.-radiatiDn. The coating preferably further comprises a dissolution inhibitor whereby rate of dissolution in an alkaline developing solution is reduced. Due to this solubility differential the rate of dissolution of the exposed areas is sufficiently higher than in the non-exposed areas.<br>

In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the neat-sensitive coating further comprises a second polymer which is insoluble in v.;ater and soluble in an alkaline solution.<br>
Ir: accordance with a more preferred embodiment of che present i nvention, tne heat-sensitive coating comprises a heat-sensitive layer and an intermediate layer. The intermediate layer is present between the heat-sensitive layer and the hydrophilic surface of the support. In a still more preferred embodiment, the heat-sensitive flayer comprises a first polymer and optionally an inhibitor, and the ir.y.er-nediate layer comprises a second polymer.<br>
The second polymer is preferably an organic polymer which nas acidic qroups with a pKa of less than 13 to ensure that the layer is s";luble cr at least swellable in aqueous alkaline developers. Advantageously, the binder is a polymer or polycondensate, for example a pcdyester, a polyamide resin, an epoxy resin, an acetal resin, an acrylic resin, a m.ethacrylic resin, a styrene based resin, a polyurethane resin or polyurea.<br>

O'her polymers having an acidic group are polycondensates and polymers having free phenolic hydroxyl groups, as obtained, for example, by reacting phenol, resorcinol, a cresol, a xylenol or a trimethyiphenol with aldehydes, especially formaldehyde, or ketones. Condensates of sulfamoyl- or carbamcyl-substituted aromatics and aldehydes or ketones are also suitable. Polymers of bismethylol- substiouted ureas, vinyl ethers, vinyl alcohols, vinyl acetals or vinylamides and polymers of phenylacrylates and copolymers of hydroxy-phenylmaleimides are likewise suitable. Furthermore, polymers having units of vinylaromatics, N-aryl(meth)acrylamides or aryl (meth}acrylates may be mentioned, it being possible for each of these units also to have one or more carboxyl groups, phenolic nydroxyl groups, sulfamoyl groups or carbamoyl groups. Specific examples include polymers having units of 2-hydroxypheny1 (meth)acrylate, of N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)(meth)acrylamide, of N-(4- sulfamoylphenyl)-(meth)acrylamide, of N-(4-hydroxy-3,5- dimethylbenzyl)-(meth)acrylamide, or 4~hydroxystyrene or of hydroxyphenylmaleimide. The polymers may additionally contain units of other monomers which have no acidic units. Such units include vinylarorriatics , methyl (meth) acrylate, phenyl (meth) acrylate, benzyl ;rr;eth; acrylate, methacrylamide or acrylonitrile.<br>
Dissolution inhibitor<br>
Ir. a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the heat- sensitive coating or the heat-sensitive layer also contain one or more dissolution inhibitors. Dissolution inhibitors are compounds which reduce the dissolution rate of the hydrophobic polymer in the aqueous alkaline developer ao the non-exposed areas of the coating and '.'.â he-rein this reduction of the dissolution rate is destroyed by rhe heat generated during the exposure so that the coating readily <br><br>
aissclves in -he developer at exposed areas. The dissolution inhibitor exhibits a substantial latitude in dissolution rate betvjeen the exposed and non-exposed areas. By preference, iihe dissoiULJon inhibitor has a good dissolution rate iati::ude when rhe exposec coating areas have dissolved completely in the developer oefore the non-expcsed areas are attacked by the developer to such an extent tnat the ink-accepting capability of the coating is affected. The dissolution inhibitor (s) can be added to the layer which comprises the hydrophobic poiym.er discussed above.<br>
The di ssolution rate of the non-exposed coating in che deve]oper is preferably reduced by interaction between the hydrophobic polymer and the inhibitor, due to e.g. hydrogen bonding between these compounds. Suitable dissolution inhibitors are preferably organic compounds which comprise at least one aromatic group and a hydrogen bonding site, e.g. a carbonyl group, a sulfonyl group, or a nitrogen atom which may be quaternized and which may be part of a heterocyclic ring or which may be part of an amino substituent of said organic compound. Suitable dissolution inhibitors of this type have been disclosed in e.g. EP-A 825 S27 and<br>
Water-repellent polymers represent an another type of suitable dissolution inhibitors. Such polymers seem to increase the developer resistance of the coating by repelling the aqueous developer from the coating. The water-repellent polymers can be added to the layer comprising the first polymer and/or can be present in a separate layer provided on top of the layer with the first polymer. In the latter embodiment, the water-repellent polymer forms a barrier layer wnich shields the coating frorr: the developer and the solubility of the barrier layer in the developer or the penetrability of the barrier layer by the developer can be increased by exposure to heat or infrared light, as described in e.g. EP-A S64420, EP-A 950 517 and VJ099/2172 5. Preferred examples of the water-repellent polymers are pclym.ers comprising siloxane and/or perfluoroalkyl units. In one embodiment, the coating contains such a water-repellent polymer in<br>
an amount between 0.5 and 25 mg/m^, preferably between 0.5 and 15<br>
2 2 mg/m and most preferably between 0.5 and 10 mg/m , vJhen the water-<br>
repel len L polymer is also ink-repelling, e.g. in the case of<br>
2<br>
polysiloxanes, higher amounts than 25 mg/m can result in poor ink- <br>
accept ance of the non-exposed areas. An amouni. ^^ower than 0. 5 mg/m^<br>
on cne other hand may lead oo an unsatisfactory development rssi5;tance. The polysiloxane rr.ay tas a linear, cyclic or complex cioss-1inkea polymer or copclymer. The rerm polysiloxane compound shall include any compound which contains more than one siloxane group -SiiR,?';-0-, wherein R ana R' are optionally substiru-ed aikyi or aryi groups. Preferred siloxanes are phenylalkylsiloxanes and dia 1kylsiloxanes. The number of siloxane groups in the ^cojpolymsr is at least 2, preferably at least 10, more preferably at least 20. It may be less than 100, preferably less than 60. In anocher embodiment, the water-repellent polymer is a block-copolymer or a graft-copolymer of a poly(alkylene oxide) block and a block of a polymer comprising siloxane and/or perfluoroalkyl units. A suitable copolymer comprises about 15 to 25 siloxane units and 50 to 70 alkylene oxide groups. Preferred examples include copolymers comprising phenylmethylsiloxane and/or dimethylsiloxane as well as ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide, such as Tego Glide 410, Tego Wet 265, Tego Protect 5001 or Silikophen P50/X, all commercially availat)le from Tego Chemie/ Essen, Germany. Such a copolymer acts as a surfactant which upon coating, due to its bifunctional structure, autom.atically positions itself at the interface between the coating and air and thereby forms a separate top layer even when the whole c:oating is applied from a single coating solution. Simultaneously, such surfactants act as a spreading agent which improves tne coating quality. Alternatively, the water-repellent polymer can be applied in a second solution, coated on top of the layer comprising the hydrophobic polymer. In that embodiment, it may be advantageous to use a solvent in the second coaring solution that is not capable of dissolving the ingredients present in the first layer so that a highly concentrated water-repellent phase is obtained at the top of tne coating.<br>
Development accelerator<br>
Preferably, also one or more development accelerators are included in the inea'c-sensitive coating or in the heat-sensitive layer, i.e. compounds which act as dissolution prom.oters because ti'iey are capable of increasing rhe dissolution rate of the non- exposed coat :.ng in the dei^eloper, Tlie simultaneous application of aissclution inhititors and accelerators allows a precise fine tuning of the dissolution behavior of the coating. Suioable dissolution accelerators are cyclic acid anhydrides, phenols or organic acids. Exarapies of the cyclic acid anhydride include phthalic anhvdride, tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, hexahydrophthalic anhydride, tetrachlorophthalic anhydride, maleic anhydride, chloromaleic anhydride, alpha -phenylmaleic anhydride, succinic anhydride, and pyroinelliric anhydride, as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,115,128. Examples of ohe phenols include bisphenol A, p-nitrophenol, p- ethoxyphenol, 2,4,4'-trihydroxybenzophenone, 2,3,4-trihydroxy- Denzophenone , 4-hydroxybenzophenone, 4,4',4"-trihydroxy- triphenylmethane, and 4,4',3",4"-tetrahydroxy-3,5,3',5'- tetramethyltriphenyl-methane, and the like. Examples of the organic acids include sulfonic acids, sulfinic acids, alkylsulfuric acids, phosphonic acids, phosphates, and carboxylic acids, as described in, for example, JP-A Nos. 60-88,942 and 2-96,755. Specific examples of these organic acids include p-toluenesulfonic acid,<br>
aodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesuifinic acid, ethylsulfuric acid, phenylphosphonic acid, phenylphosphinic acid, phenyl phosphate, diphenyl phosphate, benzoic acid, isophthalic acid, adipic acid, p-toluic acid, 3,4-dimethoxybenzoic acid, phthalic acid, terephthalic acid, 4-cyclohexene-l,2-dicarboxylic acid, erucic acid, lauric acid, n-undecanoic acid, and ascorbic acid. The amount of the cyclic acid anhydride, phenol, or organic acid contained in the coating is preferably in the range of 0.05 to 20% by weight, relative to the coating as a whole.<br>
Blocking agent<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the blocking agent is added to the developing solution by removing at least part of the precursor wherein said blocking agent of che present invention is present. In this embodiment, the layer comprising one blocking agent is removed at least partially during developrrisnt, preferably, the blocking agent is present in the heat- sensitivs coating or in the heat-sensitive layer and/or the interraediate layer and/or in a top layer and/or in an optional other layer on tne back side of the suDDoro. <br>
According "co a more preferred erabodiment, rhe blocking agent is preser.c in the heat-sensitive coating or in the heat-sensitive layer anc/or the intermediate layer whereby the layer comprising the tâ ocK i ng agent is removed at rhe exposed areas in the developing solut i or. In tnis way, it is hignly advantageous that the ,imount of Dlocl-: L ng agenr added to the developing solution is in correspondence with the amount of precursors developed. When the precursor has a toplayer which is removed only on the exposed areas, the blocking agent can also be present in the toplayer and the addition of blocking agent is also in correspondance v.'ith the exposed areas. In Lhis way the blocking agent is released in proportion with exposed areas and the amount of blocking agent present in such an image-wise<br>
dissolving coating ranges preferably between 0.01 g/m^ to 2,5 g/m^,<br>
2 2<br>
more preferably between 0.05 g/'m to 1.5 g/m , most preferably<br>
between 0.07 g/m'^ to 1.0 g/m^.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the blocking agent is present in layer on the back side of the support and this layer is removed at least partially in the deve-oping solution. In this way the addition of blocking agent is proportional with the surface of the precursors which are developed, in an analogous way, the blocking agent can also be present in a top layer which is removed also in the non-exposed areas. In this way the blocking agent is released in proportion with surface of the precursor and the amount of blocking agent present in such a layer ranges preferably between O.Cl g/m^ to 2.0 g/m^, more preferably<br>
x	?	2<br>
between 0.05 g/m to 1.5 g/m", most preferably between 0.0^ g/m to 1.0 g/re".<br>
In order to obtain an optimum blocking activity, it is aovanrageous to combine a precursor, having the blocking agent in a coating in a lower concentration, preferably between 0.005 and 0,35 g/m"", with a developing solution (or replenisher) , having a concentration of the blocking agent, preferably in the range of G.l and 3 g/1.<br>

irectly by infrared light, which <br><br><br>
IS preferably converted into heat by an infrared light absorbing "ompourd, v.-mcn ir.ay be a dye or pigment having an absorpt.ion maKiraum :n the infrared wavelength range. The infrared light absoroing dye o: pig:r.ent is preferably present in rhe heat-sensitive coating or the heat-sensitive layer and typically in a concentration ranging oetween 0.25 and 10.0 wt.?, more preferably between 0.5 and 7.5 wt.% relative to the coating as a whole. Preferred IR-absorbing compounds .sre dyes such as cyanine or raerocyanine dyes or pig.tients such as carbon black. A suitable componncl is the following infrared dye IR- 1 :<br>
(IR-1i<br>
wherein X is a suitable counter ion such as tosylate,<br>
The heat-sensitive coating, or the heat-sensitive layer and/or tne intermediate layer, may further contain an organic dye which absorbs visible light so that a perceptible image is obtained upon irti.age-wise exposure and subsequent development. Such a dye is often called contrast dye or indicator dye. Preferably, the dye has a blue color and an absorption maximum in the wavelength range netween oOOn.Ti and 750 nm. Although the dye absorbs visible light, it preferably does not sensitize the printing plate precursor, i.e. the coating does not become more soluble in the developer upon exposure tc visible light. Suitable examples of such a contrast dye are the quaternized triarylmiethane dyes.<br>
and/or<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the contrast dye is nresent in the heat-sensitive coating, or the heat-sensitive layer<br>
:he intermediate layer. <br><br>
riccoraing ro a highly preferred embodiment, rhe infrared light absor;-ing compound is concentrated in the heat-sensitive coating or heÂ£;t-sens:.tive layer.<br>
The printing plate precursor of the present invention can be â¢^^xpossTi T-.o infrared light with LEDs or a laser. Preferably, a laser emitting near infrared light having a wavelength in the range from about 7 50 to about 1500 nm is used, such as a semiconductor laser diode, a Nd;YAG or a Nd:YLF laser. The required laser power depends on the sensitivity of the image-recording layer, the pixel dwell lime of the laser beam, which is determined by the spot diameter<br>
2<br>
â :rypicai value of modern place-setters at 1/e of ma.xijnum<br>
intensity : 10-25 pm), the scan speed and the resolution of the exposure apparatus (i.e. the number of addressable pixels per unit of linear distance, often expressed in dots per inch or dpi; typical value : 1000-4 000 dpi}.<br>
Two types of laser-exposure apparatuses are commonly used: internal (ITD) and external drum (XTD) plate-setters. ITD plate- setters for thermal plates are typically characterized by a very high scan speed up to 500 m/sec and may require a laser povjer of several Watts. XTD plate-setters for thermal plates having a typical laser power from about 200 mW to about 1 W operate at a lower scan speed, e.g. from 0.1 to 10 m/sec.<br>
The known plate-setters can be used as an off-press exposure apparatus, which offers the benefit of reduced press down-time. XTD plate-setter configurations can also be used for on-press exposure, offering the benefit of immediate registration in a multi-color press. Mere technical details of on-press exposure apparatuses are aescribed in e.g. US 5,174,205 and US 5,163,368.<br>
In the development step, the non-image areas of the coating are removed by immersion in an aqueous alkaline developer, which may be combined with m.echanical rubbing, e.g. by a rotating brush. The developer preferably has a pK above 10, more preferably above 12. The developer may further contain a poly hydroxyl compound such as e.g. sorbitol, preferably in a concentration of at least 40 g/1, and a_so a Dolyethylene oxide containing compound such as e.g. Supronic 325, comjnercially available from RODTA, preferably in a concentrstior; of at most 0.15 g/1 - <br>
The clevelopinent step may be followed by a rinsing step and/or â =! gunn-.ing stec. The gumming step involves post-treatment of the 1 i-hographic printing plate v.'rtn a gum solution. A gum solution is i-vpicaiy an aqueous 11quid wni ch comprises one or more sui face protectve compounds that are capable cf protectinc rhe lirhogra^ itTiage or a prinring plate against contamination or damaging. Suitable exair.ples of such compounds are film-forming hydroohilic polymers or surfactants.<br>
Tne plate precursor can, if required, be post-treated with a ^ri'^itabl e correcting agent or preservative as known in the art. To ::ncrea.= e the resistance of the finished printing plate and hence to extend the run length, the layer can be briefly heated to elevated temperatures ("baking"}. The plate can be dried before baking or is dried during the baking process itself. During the baking step, the plate can be heated at a temperature which is higher than the glass "ransit.ion temperature of the nea;:-sensitive coating, e.g. between lOO^C and 230'C for a period of 40 seconds to 5 minutes. Baking can be done in convenziOTial hot air ovens or by irradiation wirh lamps emitting in the infrared or ultraviolet spectrum. As a result of this baking srep, the resistance of the printing plate to plate cleaners, correction agents and UV-curable printing inks increases. Such a thermal pcst-treatment is described, inter alia, in DE 1,447,963 and GB 1,154,749.<br>
The printing plate thus obtained can be used for conventional, s.c-called wet offset printing, in which ink and an aqueous dampening liquid is supplied to the plate. Another suitable printing method uses so-called single-fluid ink without a dampening liquid. Suitable single-fluid inks have been described in US 4,045,232; US 4,981,517 and US 6,140,392. In a most preferred embodiment, the single-fluid ink comprises an ink phase, also called the hydrophobic or oleophilic pnase, and a polyol phase as described in WO 00/32705.<br>

ID these experiments the precursor was exposed at the Right Exposure, hereinafter also referred to as RE. The RE is defined as the exposure energy at which a dot coverage on the plate for a 1x1 checkerboard and for a 8x8 checkerboard matches 50%. The dot coverage vjas measured with a GretagMacbeth D19C densitometer, commercially available from Gretag-Macbeth AG, with the uncoated support as reference.<br>
The development latitude was determined by developing a 1x1 cneckerbcard at different developing times. The Right Developing Titds, hereinafter also referred ro as RDT, is defined whereby the optical density, hereinafter also referred to as OD, on the plate match a SO ?. dot coverage, measured with a densitometer as described above. (A 5C dot coverage corresponds with an OD of approximately 0.3; the experimentally measured values are indicated in Table 5). The development latitude was measured by the difference between the optical density of a 1x1 checkerboard, developed at a shorter {e.g. ~3 seconds) or longer (e.g. -^2, +5 or +10 seconds) developing time, and the optical density of a 1x1 checkerboard, developed at the RDT. The lower the absolute value of this difference in OD, the more efficient of the additive is working as a blocking agent to reduce the dissolution kinetic of this coating and the more the development latitude is improved.<br>

Tne printing plate precursors PPP-C3 to PPP-O" were, in a first gxperir::er.t, exposed with a Creo Trendsetter 3244 (plate-setter, â ..radeiv^srk from Creo, Burnaby, Canada^, operating at 15C rpm at the Pight Exposure (RE) as defined above and developed with DEV-01 as defined above- in Table 4.<br>
In a second experiment, the printing plate precursors PPP-03 to PPP-07 were exposed by a 1x1 checkerboard at an exposure energy which is 20 Â« lower than the RE value as determined above and, also, at an exposure energy which is 20 % higher than the RE value. After developing, the dot coverage for the under-exposure by 20 % and for the over-exposure by 20 % was measured by the OD as defined above. The exposure latitude was determined by difference between the dot coverage by the 20 % under-exposure and the dot coverage by the 20 I over-exposure. The lower the absolute value of this difference, the more efficiently the dissolution kinetic of the coating is reduced and rhe more the exposure latitude is improved. The results are surmarized in Table 13,<br>
