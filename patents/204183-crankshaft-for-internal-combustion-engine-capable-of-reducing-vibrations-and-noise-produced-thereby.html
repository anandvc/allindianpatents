CRANKSHAFT FOR INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE CAPABLE <br>
OF REOCING VIBRATION AND NOISE PROVCED THEREBY<br><br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan<br><br><br>
The   following   specification   particularly   describes   the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br>
This invention relates to a crankshaft for internal combustion engine capable of reducing vibrations and noise produced thereby.<br>
A crankshaft is an elastic member, and therefore, is acted upon by flexural vibrations by an explosion load or by torsional vibrations by a torque variation.<br>
Particularly where a crankshaft is supported for rotation by a bearing, if a gear, a clutch and other rotary members are provided at an end portion which<br><br><br>
projects outwardly from the bearing, then the natural frequency of the crankshaft system including the members mentioned and the frequency of torque variation are liable to cause resonance thereby to increase the amplitude of torsional vibrations, and there is a problem of noise arising from the torsional vibrations.<br>
Thus, an example wherein a dynamic damper is provided on a crank web of a crankshaft (the official gazette of Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. Sho 57-104012) is available.<br>
The example disclosed in the official gazette mentioned above is shown in FIG. 6.<br><br>
Each of circular crank webs 02, 02 on the opposite sides of a crank pin 03 of a crankshaft 01 has a recess formed in a substantially semicircular shape thereon, and weight pieces 06, 06 of a substantially semicircular shape are mounted in the recesses with elastic plates 05, 05 interposed therebetween.<br>
The weight pieces 06, 06 are vibrated by deformation of the elastic plates 05, 05 such that torsional vibrations of the crankshaft 01 may be<br><br>
cancelled, and the vibration energy is diffused as heat by internal friction of the elastic plates 05, 05 to attenuate the torsional vibrations.<br><br>
[Subject to Be Solved by the Invention]<br>
However, since each weight piece 06 is mounted on the semicircular portion of a circular crank web 02 and the center of gravity of the weight piece 06 is eccentric from the center axis of rotation of the crankshaft 01, centrifugal force caused by rotation of the weight piece 06 acts to displace the weight piece 06 in the eccentric direction. Accordingly, a load arising from the<br>
centrifugal force always acts upon the elastic plate 05, and"as the speed of rotation increases, the load increases and the durability of the elastic plate 05 is deteriorated, resulting in the possibility that the<br>
attenuating capacity for torsional vibrations may be<br>
deteriorated and noise may be produced.<br>
Further, in a crankshaft which is supported for rotation by at least one pair of crank bearings, flexural vibrations are liable to occur, and where a power transmission system is formed on one side, also torsional vibrations are liable to occur.<br><br>
And, where a construction wherein crank webs are mounted on the opposite sides of a crank pin by force fitting is employed, such flexural vibrations cannot be<br>
reduced efficiently, and noise arising from the flexural vibrations cannot be suppressed sufficiently.<br>
The present invention has been made taking such a point as described above into consideration, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a crankshaft for an internal combustion engine which can maintain an effect of reducing vibrations of the crankshaft and.<br>
suppress noise of the engine over a long period of time<br>
with a simple construction<br>
[Means to Solve the Subject and Action and Effects]<br>
In order to achieve the"object described above, in<br>
the invention	a crankshaft for an<br>
internal combustion engine is constructed such that a damper weight is mounted on a crank web through an elastic member such that the center of gravity of the damper weight substantially coincides with a center axis of rotation of the crankshaft.<br><br>
Since the center of gravity of the damper weight<br><br>
mounted on the crank web substantially coincides with the center axis of rotation of the crankshaft, the centrifugal force caused by rotation of the damper weight does not act so as to displace the damper weight. Consequently, since a load arising from the centrifugal force is not applied to the elastic member, the durability of the elastic member can be augmented.<br>
Since the damper weight is mounted on the crank web through the elastic member which has the augmented durability, an effect of attenuating torsional vibrations and flexural vibrations of the crankshaft can be maintained, and noise of the engine can be reduced over a long period of time. <br>
In the invention                     a crankshaft<br>
for an internal combustion engine which is supported for rotation on a crankcase by a pair of left and right crank bearings is constructed such that a damper weight is mounted through an elastic member on one of crank webs on the opposite sides of a crank pin which is on the side opposite to the side to which power is transmitted. <br>
Since the damper weight is mounted through the<br><br>
elastic member on the crank web on the opposite side to the side to which power of the crankshaft is transmitted, the dynamic damper is provided on the side on which an explosion load is applied and the amplitudes of torsional vibrations and flexural vibrations are greater around the fulcrum axis provided by the power transmission system side.  Consequently, torsional vibrations and flexural vibrations of the crankshaft can be reduced further efficiently, and noise of the engine can be prevented.<br>
for an internal combustion engine which is supported for rotation on a crankcase by a pair of left and right crank bearings is constructed such that bearings having different rigidities from each other are used for the pair of crank bearings, and a damper weight is mounted through an elastic member on one of crank webs on the opposite sides of a crank pin which is on the side on which the crank bearing of the lower rigidity is provided. <br>
Since the crankshaft is supported for rotation by the pair of left and right crank bearings having different rigidities from each other, the crank bearing side of the lower rigidity is acted upon by an explosion<br><br><br>
load and exhibits a greater amplitude of flexural vibrations around the fulcrum axis provided by the crank bearing of the higher rigidity. Where the damper weight is mounted through the elastic member on the crank web on the lower rigidity crank bearing side, flexural vibrations of the crankshaft can be reduced further efficiently, and noise of the engine can be prevented.<br>
In the present invention, the crankshaft for an internal combustion engine according to claim 2 or 3 is characterized in that the damper weight is mounted on the crank web through the elastic member such that the center of gravity of the damper weight may substantially coincide with a center axis of rotation of the crankshaft.<br>
Flexural vibrations of the crankshaft can be reduced, and a load arising from centrifugal force is not applied to the elastic member and the durability of the elastic member can be augmented.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a crankshaft for internal combustion engine capable of reducing vibrations and noise produced thereby which is supported for rotation on a crankcase by a pair of left and right crank bearings, characterized in that<br>
a damper weight is mounted through an elastic member on one of crank webs on the opposite sides of a crank pin which is on the side opposite to the side to which power is transmitted. [Embodiments of the invention]<br>
In the following, an embodiment according to the present invention is described with reference to Figs. 1<br><br><br>
to 3 .	<br>
[BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
[FIG. 1]<br>
FIG. 1 is a vertical sectional view of an internal combustion engine according to an embodiment of the present invention. [FIG. 2]<br>
FIG. 2 is a side elevational view, partly omitted, of the internal combustion engine. [FIG. 3]<br>
FIG. 3 is a side elevational view of a crankshaft and a connecting rod. [FIG. 4]<br>
FIG. 4 is a vertical sectional view of essential<br>
part of an   internal combustion engine according to another embodiment. [FIG. 5]<br>
FIG. 5 is a side elevational view of a crankshaft and a connecting rod of the internal combustion engine of FIG. 4. [FIG. 6]<br>
FIG. 6 is a top plan view of essential part of a conventional crankshaft.<br><br>
An internal combustion engine 1 according to the present embodiment is a water-cooled single cylinder 4-cycle internal combustion engine which is incorporated in a motorcycle. [0019]<br>
The internal combustion engine 1 is roughly divided into blocks of a crankcase 2, a cylinder 3, a cylinder head 4 and a cylinder head cover 5, which are assembled in an overlapping relationship to each other substantially in a forward direction in this order. [0020]<br>
A crankshaft 10 which is oriented in horizontal leftward and rightward directions is composed of a crankshaft 11 on the left side and a crankshaft 12 on the right side connected to each other by a crank pin 13 so that they are formed as a unitary member.  Each of the crankshafts 11 and 12 includes a crank journal 11a or 12a and a crank web 11b or 12b. The opposite ends of the crank pin 13 are force fitted in eccentric circular holes of the crank webs 11b and 12b each in the form of a thick disk to connect the crank webs 11b and 12b to each other.<br>
[0021]<br><br>
The crankcase 2 is of a leftwardly and rightwardly<br><br><br>
split type, and reinforcement rings 14 and 15 are fitted in corresponding circular holes of left and right crankcases 2a and 2b.  A ball bearing 8 and a roller bearing 9 are interposed in the left and right reinforcement rings 14 and 15, respectively, and root portions of the crank journals 11a and 12a on the outer sides of the left and right crank webs lib and 12b of the crankshaft 10 are supported by the ball bearing 8 and the roller bearing 9.  Consequently, the entire crankshaft 10 is supported for rotation by the ball bearing 8 and the roller bearing 9 on the left and right. [0022]<br>
It is to be noted that, while the inner race of the ball bearing 8 on the left side is force fitted in and secured to the crank journal 11a, although the outer race of the ball bearing 8 is force fitted in an inner periphery of the reinforcement ring 14 integrated with the crankcase 2, since the force fitting becomes loose by thermal expansion upon being heated, a letting-off preventing plate 16 for preventing letting off of the ball bearing 8 is securely mounted on the crankcase 2a by means of a bolt 17.<br>
The letting-off preventing plate 16 partially holds the reinforcement ring 14 and is force fitted at an end<br><br>
portion thereof in a cut-in portion of the outer race of<br>
the ball bearing 8 to secure the ball bearing 8.<br>
[0023]<br>
A mission chamber is formed rearwardly of the crankshaft 10, and a main shaft 20 is disposed in the mission chamber such that it can transmit power through a starting clutch 21, engagement of gears 22 and 23 and a speed change clutch 24.  Behind the main shaft 20, a countershaft 25 is disposed for power transmission through a gear train 26. [0024]<br>
Meanwhile, in the cylinder 3, a piston 18 is moved back and forth within a cylinder bore, and a connecting rod 19 interconnects the piston 18 and the crank pin 13 of the crankshaft 10. [0025]<br>
In the cylinder head 4, an intake path extends upwardly from a combustion chamber which faces the cylinder bore while an exhaust path extends downwardly, and an ignition plug 27 extends into the combustion chamber from the right outer side. [0026]<br>
A valve motion is provided on the cylinder head 4, and a camshaft 31 for rocking a rocker arm is provided at<br><br>
an upper portion of the cylinder head 4. A driven sprocket wheel 32 is securely mounted coaxially at a left end portion of the camshaft 31, and a water pump 36 which is driven through the driven sprocket wheel 32 is provided on a left side portion of the cylinder head 4. [0027]<br>
A chain chamber 3a is formed in a left side portion of the cylinder 3, and a large recessed portion 2ay trimmed with a peripheral wall 2ax on the front side and open to the left is formed on the left side face of the crankcase 2a.  The recessed portion 2ay is communicated with the chain chamber 3a, and a driving sprocket wheel 33 is fitted on the crank journal 11a of the crankshaft 11 on the left side in the recessed portion 2ay. [0028]<br>
A timing chain 34 extends between the driving sprocket wheel 33 and the driven sprocket wheel 32 through the chain chamber 3a so that rotation of the crankshaft 10 drives the valve motion through the timing chain 34. [0029]<br>
The crankshaft 10 is supported at portions thereof on the left and right of the crank webs 11b and 12b for rotation on the crankcase 2 by the ball bearing 8 and the<br><br><br>
roller bearing 9, respectively, as described above, and an AC generator 35 is provided at an end portion of the crank journal 11a which projects leftwardly from the ball bearing 8 on the left side while the driving sprocket wheel 33 is fitted between the AC generator 35 and the ball bearing 8.<br>
A left portion of the AC generator 35 is covered with a case cover 6. [0030]<br>
On the other hand, the starting clutch 21 mentioned above and a centrifugal oil strainer 28 are provided at an end portion of the crank journal 12a which projects rightwardly from the roller bearing 9 on the right side of the crankshaft 10.<br>
Right portions of the centrifugal oil strainer 28 and the clutch 24 are covered with a clutch cover 7. [0031]<br>
Oil pumped up by an oil pump disposed below the crankshaft 10 passes an oil passage 7a perforated in a wall of the clutch cover 7 and a communication passage 12c at an end portion of the crankshaft 12 on the right side and enters a strainer chamber 28a of the centrifugal oil strainer 28, in which foreign articles are removed from the oil by centrifugal force.  Then, the oil enters<br><br>
an oil passage 12d of the crankshaft 12 on the right side and is supplied to a connection portion between the crank pin 13 and the connecting rod 19 and so forth. [0032]<br>
The present internal combustion engine 1 generally has such a structure as described above.  The crankshaft 10 which is orientated in the horizontal leftward and rightward directions is supported for rotation on the crankcase 2 by the ball bearing 8 and the roller bearing 9 on the left and right of the crank webs 11b and 12b, and the AC generator 35 is provided at the end portion of the crank journal 11a which projects leftwardly from the ball bearing 8 on the left side while the starting clutch 21 is provided at the end portion of the crank journal 12a which projects rightwardly from the roller bearing 9 on the right side. [0033]<br>
In the present crankshaft system, a dynamic damper 40 is provided on the crank web 11b of the crankshaft 11 on the left side which is the opposite side to the right crankshaft 12 on which the power transmission system such as the starting clutch 21 and so forth are formed. [0034]<br>
In particular, a recessed portion 41 is formed on<br><br><br>
the left side face of the crank web 11b in the form of a thick disk such that it has a thick substantially U shape which extends around a central circular portion of the crank web 11b from which the crank journal 11a projects as shown in FIG. 3. [0035]<br>
A circular hole 42 in which the crank pin 13 is force fitted is perforated at a location of the crank web 11b at which the recessed portion 41 is not formed between the opposite ends of the U shape so that the margin for force fitting of the crank pin 13 may be assured sufficiently to secure the rigidity and the strength of the force fitting portion. [0036]<br>
The opposite ends of the U shape of the recessed portion 41 are formed such that they are swollen a little to the outer sides, and a damper weight 43 which is a metal plate a little smaller than the recessed portion 41 but having a similar shape is inserted with a sufficient margin in the substantially U-shaped recessed portion 41 and is elastically supported by an elastic rubber member 44. [0037]<br>
The elastic rubber member 44 is interposed between<br><br><br>
and baked to an inner face of the recessed portion 41 and a corresponding face of' the damper weight 43.  The damper weight 43 is elastically supported by the elastic rubber member 44 in such a form that it is loosely fitted in the recessed portion 41 with a gap left therebetween such that an outer edge of the damper weight 43 is trimmed with the inner side face of the recessed portion 41.<br>
It is to be noted that, although the elastic rubber member 44 is present in the gap on the outer side of the . outer edge of the damper weight 43, it is not present in the inner side gap but merely an air gap 45 is formed (refer to FIG. 3). [0038]<br>
Also the opposite ends of the U shape of the damper weight 43 are swollen a little to the outer sides in a similar shape to the recessed portion 41 so that an imbalance around the center axis of rotation by the U-shaped recessed portion may be eliminated by the swollen portions at the opposite ends of the U shape of the damper weight 43. [0039]<br>
The shape and the thickness of the damper weight 43 are decided in this manner so that the center of gravity of the damper weight 43 loosely fitted on the left side<br><br><br>
face of the crank web 11b may be on the center axis of<br>
rotation of the crankshaft 10.<br>
[0040]<br>
Accordingly, even if the damper weight 43 is rotated by rotation of the crankshaft 10, it is not displaced in a centrifugal direction by centrifugal force, and consequently, a load by the centrifugal force does not act upon the elastic rubber member 44. [0041]<br>
Since a load by centrifugal force is not applied to the elastic rubber member 44 in this manner, the durability of the elastic rubber member 44 is augmented.<br>
Although the burden to the elastic rubber member 44 is high if the load of centrifugal force is applied to the elastic rubber member 44 particularly during high speed rotation, since the load of centrifugal force does not act upon the elastic rubber member 44, the burden to the elastic rubber member 44 is reduced significantly irrespective of the speed of rotation, and the durability of the elastic rubber member 44 is augmented. [0042]<br>
Further, since the damper weight 43 is not displaced by centrifugal force, also the mounting of the damper weight 43 may have a simple structure by baking of<br><br>
the elastic rubber member 44, and there is no necessity to provide a separate member to raise the mounting strength, which increases the weight and the size. Further, the damper weight 43 is mounted in an embedded manner in the crank web 11b to achieve miniaturization and reduction in weight. [0043]<br>
Furthermore, the damper weight 43 is embedded in the crank web lib, and the elastic rubber member 44 is present in the gap on the outer side of the outer edge of the damper weight 43 such that movement of the damper weight 43 is guided by the inner peripheral face of the recessed portion 41.  Consequently, the durability of the elastic rubber member 44 is higher than that where the damper weight is externally provided. [0044]<br>
The damper weight 43 and the elastic rubber member 44 act as a dynamic damper except that the damper weight 43 is not displaced by centrifugal force, and the elastic rubber member 44 has a high degree of durability. Consequently, the effect of reducing torsional vibrations and flexural vibrations of the crankshaft 10 is maintained over a long time. [0045]<br><br><br>
Further, since the dynamic damper 40 is provided on the crank web 11b of the crankshaft 11 on the left side which is the opposite side to the crankshaft 12 on the right side on which the power transmission system is formed, the dynamic damper 40 is positioned on the side on which the amplitudes of flexural and torsional vibrations are greater on the crank pin 13 side which receives an explosion load around the fulcrum axis provided by the power transmission system side, and flexural and torsional vibrations of the crankshaft 10 can be reduced further effectively. [0046]<br>
Furthermore, since the dynamic damper 40 is provided on the crank web 11b on the side on which, of the ball bearing 8 and the roller bearing 9 in pair on the left and right, the ball bearing 8 which has a lower rigidity is interposed, the dynamic damper 40 is positioned on the side on which an explosion load is applied and the amplitude of flexural vibrations is greater with respect to the fulcrum axis provided by the roller bearing 9 having a higher rigidity, and flexural vibrations of the crankshaft 10 can be reduced further effectively. [0047]<br><br>
As described above, flexural vibrations and torsional vibrations of the crankshaft 10 are reduced significantly and noise of the engine arising from vibrations of the crankshaft 10 is prevented with certainty.<br>
Particularly also upon high speed rotation, flexural vibrations and torsional vibrations of the crankshaft 10 can be attenuated sufficiently, and noise of the engine can be reduced significantly. [0048]<br>
It is to be noted that, since flexural and torsional vibrations of the crankshaft 10 are reduced, loads to the force fitted portions of the crank pin 13 in the crank webs lib and 12b are reduced significantly. [0049]<br>
Subsequently, another embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to FIGS. 4 and 5.<br>
An internal combustion engine 50 according to the present embodiment has a substantially same structure as that of the internal combustion engine 1 described hereinabove, and like members are denoted by like reference characters.<br>
A crankshaft 51 includes a crankshaft 52 on the left side and a crankshaft 53 on the right side connected<br><br>
to each other by a crank pin 54 to form a unitary member. [0050]<br>
A recessed portion in which a damper weight may be embedded is not formed on a crank web 52b of the crankshaft 52 on the left side, and the distance between a left crankcase 2a and the crank web 52b is set somewhat greater than that in the internal combustion engine 1.<br>
A dynamic damper 60 is mounted on the crank web 52b making use of the gap. [0051]<br>
In the dynamic damper 60, a damper weight 62 is elastically supported on a mounting plate 61, which is provided for mounting the dynamic damper 60 on the crank web 52b, through an elastic rubber member 63. [0052]<br>
The mounting plate 61 is constructed such that an outer circumferential edge of a hollow disk portion 61a extends a little in ah axial direction to form a peripheral wall portion 61b.  The peripheral wall portion 61b has an inner diameter substantially equal to the outer diameter of the crank web 52b in the form of a thick disk while the hollow circle of the disk portion 61a has an inner diameter with which a crank journal 52a can be inserted into the hollow circle with a sufficient<br><br><br><br><br>
margin. [0053]<br>
The annular damper weight 62 is mounted on an outer side face of the disk portion 61a of the mounting plate 61 with the elastic rubber member 63 interposed therebetween.<br>
The annular damper weight 62 is adhered by baking to and elastically supported by the elastic rubber member 63 which is baked to the outer periphery of the hollow circle of the disk portion 61a. [0054]<br>
In this manner, the mounting plate 61 on which the damper weight 62 is supported through the elastic rubber member 63 is mounted by force fitting to the crank web 52b of the crankshaft 52 on the left side.<br>
The center of gravity of the damper weight 62 is on the center axis of rotation of the crankshaft 51. [0055]<br>
Accordingly, the damper weight 62 is not displaced in a centrifugal direction by centrifugal force even if it is rotated by rotation of the crankshaft 51. Consequently, since a load originating from centrifugal force is not applied to the elastic rubber member 63, the durability of the elastic rubber member 63 is augmented.<br><br>
[0056]<br>
Further, the dynamic damper 60 can effectively reduce torsional vibrations and flexural vibrations of the crankshaft 51 and reduce noise of the engine similarly to the dynamic damper 40 described hereinabove. [0057]<br>
If the dynamic damper 60 including the mounting plate 61 is produced separately from the crankshaft 51 in advance, then it can be assembled later only by force fitting it'onto the crankshaft 51, and consequently, augmentation of the productivity can be anticipated.<br>
