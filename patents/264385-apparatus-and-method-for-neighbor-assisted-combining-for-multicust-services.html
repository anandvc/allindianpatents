				<td>APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR NEIGHBOR ASSISTED COMBINING FOR<br>
MULTICAST SERVICES<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
1. Technical Field<br>
The present disclosure is directed to a method and apparatus for neighbor<br>
assisted combining for localized multicast services. More particularly, the present<br>
disclosure is directed to using at least one serving cell and at least one extended<br>
serving cell for broadcast and multicast services.<br>
2. Description of Related Art<br>
Presently, to deliver a multicast/broadcast stream in the Radio Access network<br>
(RAN) efficiently, two possible methods can be used. One is simulcast and the other<br>
is localized multicast. In simulcast mode, a Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service<br>
(MBMS) service area is identical to the RAN system coverage area. All the cells<br>
broadcast the same data using the same physical layer resources (denoted "resource<br>
elements" or "resources" for short). A resource element is a unit of physical layer<br>
resource into which data can be multiplexed. A resource element can be one of, a<br>
multiplicity of, or a combination of, a time slot, an orthogonal spreading function such<br>
as a Walsh code, a subcarrier (such as is used in Orthogonal Frequency Division<br>
Multiplexing, or "OFDM"), or the like. Since identical transmissions from multiple<br>
cells on the same resource can combine such that they appear as a single transmission,<br>
in systems such as an OFDM based Enhanced MBMS (EMBMS), this could reduce<br>
the inter-cell interference if the allocated resource element is identical, which can<br>
improve transmission efficiency as measured in Bits/Hz. For a service with a very<br>
large number of users and when the service is widely distributed in the RAN,<br>
simulcast can be a very efficient transmission technique. For example, simulcast can<br>
be useful for transmission of weather reports, music, movies, etc.<br>
Simulcast is not efficient if the service area is much smaller than the system<br>
coverage area. For example, if the service is mostly focused in selected multiple cells,<br>
such as for clip replay for football stadiums, sport centers, local weather reports, or the<br>
like, it is not good to turn on all the cells in the system to deliver the localized service<br>
to just the selected cells. Most of these MBMS services may fall into this category of<br>
localized MBMS. In other words, simulcast is not an efficient way to improve<br>
efficiency as measured in Bits/Hz/km2. For the localized MBMS service, counting<br>
can be used to determine the user status of the cells, such as to determine which cells<br>
contain users who desire the service. Then an efficient radio bearer will be<br>
established in the appropriate cells to deliver the MBMS service.<br>
Unfortunately, during a localized multicast session, neighboring cells interfere<br>
with the localized service area cells. For example, neighbor cells may transmit on the<br>
same resource element as the serving cells, which will interfere with the common<br>
multicast transmission. Thus, there is a need for a method and apparatus for neighbor<br>
assisted combining for localized multicast services.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
A method and apparatus for neighbor assisted combining for localized<br>
multicast services. User equipment is sent a signal indicating the relationship between<br>
cells with respect to serving cells transmitting a common multicast transmission. At<br>
least a portion of the common multicast transmission is transmitted on the same<br>
resource on each serving cell. A pilot signal is transmitted on each serving cell, the<br>
pilot signal related to the at least a portion of the common multicast transmission on<br>
each serving cell. An interfering signal and a related pilot are transmitted on at least<br>
one different cell from the serving cells.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Fig. 1 is an exemplary block diagram of a system 100 according to one<br>
embodiment. The system 100 can include a network controller 140, a network 110,<br>
and at least one terminal 120. The terminal 120 may be a wireless communication<br>
device, such as a wireless telephone, a cellular telephone, a personal digital assistant, a<br>
pager, a personal computer, a selective call receiver, or any other device that is<br>
capable of sending and receiving communication signals on a network including<br>
wireless network. The network can include base stations with cells (such as<br>
transmitters that serve part or all of an area covered by a base station) 112, 114, and<br>
116. These cells can include serving cells 112 and extended serving cells 114. In the<br>
exemplary embodiment, one cell per base station is assumed. However, multiple cells<br>
may be present per base station.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the network controller 140 is connected to the<br>
network 110. The controller 140 may be located at a base station, at a radio network<br>
controller, at a multicast transmission server, anywhere else on the network 110,<br>
and/or may be distributed throughout various resources on the network 110. The<br>
network 110 may include any type of network that is capable of sending and receiving<br>
signals, such as wireless signals. For example, the network 110 may include a<br>
wireless telecommunications network, a cellular telephone network, a satellite<br>
communications network, and other like communications systems. Furthermore, the<br>
network 110 may include more than one network and may include a plurality of<br>
different types of networks. Thus, the network 110 may include a plurality of data<br>
networks, a plurality of telecommunications networks, a combination of data and<br>
telecommunications networks and other like communication systems capable of<br>
sending and receiving communication signals.<br>
In operation, the controller 140 can determine cells 112 in which user<br>
equipment, such as terminals 120, reside that desire a common multicast service. A<br>
terminal resides in a cell if that cell can be received better than other cells. For<br>
example due to variability in radio propagation, the terminal is not necessarily closer<br>
to the base station containing the cell than to other base stations. The controller 140<br>
can select at least one serving cell 112 for transmitting the common multicast service<br>
where the selection can be based on the determination. The controller 140 can select<br>
at least one extended serving cell 114 from at least one serving cell neighbor cell<br>
which does not have user equipment that desires the common multicast service, the<br>
extended serving cell 114 influencing transmissions on the serving cell 112. The<br>
controller 140 can transmit the common multicast service on the selected at least one<br>
serving cell 112.<br>
According to a related embodiment, the controller 140 can signal to user<br>
equipment, such as terminals 120, a signal indicating the relationship between cells<br>
with respect to the serving cells 112 transmitting a common multicast transmission.<br>
The controller can transmit at least a portion of the common multicast transmission on<br>
the same resource on each serving cell 112. The controller 140 can transmit a pilot<br>
signal on each serving cell 112, the pilot signal related to the at least a portion of the<br>
common multicast transmission on each serving cell 112. The controller 140 can<br>
transmit an interfering signal and a related pilot on at least one different cell 114 from<br>
the serving cells 112.<br>
For example, in a Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS), when<br>
one MBMS session begins, the controller 140 can perform counting to determine the<br>
user status of all the cells under the controller 140. If one cell has enough users, such<br>
as terminals 120, the cell can be a serving cell 112 and a broadcast mode can be<br>
established for the serving cell 112. The threshold for enough users may be a single<br>
user. If there are no users in a cell, such as in cells 114 and 116, the cell may not<br>
broadcast the data. A user, such as a terminal 112, can read Multicast Control<br>
Channel (MCCH) messages to determine if and how to combine a neighbor cell's 114<br>
stream with its serving cell's 112 stream in order to obtain the diversity gain and/or<br>
the power gain.<br>
To elaborate, in Enhanced MBMS (EMBMS), interference may only come<br>
from other cells. This can be a major bottleneck for system capacity. If the controller<br>
140 can control the neighboring cells with largest average interference to broadcast<br>
the same data using the same resource element or at least not use that resource<br>
element for other data transmissions, the interference level can be greatly reduced.<br>
This can significantly increase the system capacity. Counting can be performed when<br>
the session begins. Each cell can report its user status to the controller 140. These<br>
serving cells 112 form the service area. The controller 140 can then choose<br>
appropriate cells aside from the serving cells 112 that are the candidates for the<br>
strongest interference for the cells in the serving area. This cells form extended<br>
serving cells 114 in an extended serving area. The controller 140 can then control the<br>
extended serving cells 114 in the extended serving area to either broadcast the same<br>
data as the serving cells 112 in the serving area, in the case that cell power is available<br>
in an extended serving cell 114, or block the resource element that is used by an<br>
extended serving cell 114 in the case that cell power is unavailable at the extended<br>
serving cell 114. If the service area changes, such as by a user moving between cells,<br>
by a late joining user, or the like, during the session transmission, the controller 140<br>
can adjust the extended serving area accordingly.<br>
Fig. 2 is an exemplary block diagram of a wireless communication device 200,<br>
such as the terminal 120, according to one embodiment. The wireless communication<br>
device 200 can include a housing 210, a controller 220 coupled to the housing 210,<br>
audio input and output circuitry 230 coupled to the housing 210, a display 240<br>
coupled to the housing 210, a transceiver 250 coupled to the housing 210, a user<br>
interface 260 coupled to the housing 210, a memory 270 coupled to the housing 210,<br>
and at least one antenna 280 coupled to the housing 210 and the transceiver 250. At<br>
least one other antenna 282 may be coupled to the transceiver 250 to create an antenna<br>
array. The wireless communication device 200 can also include a multicast control<br>
information module 290, a receiver characteristic adjustment module 292, and a<br>
multicast transmission decoder 294. The multicast control information module 290,<br>
the receiver characteristic adjustment module 292, and the multicast transmission<br>
decoder 294 can be coupled to the controller 220, can reside within the controller 220,<br>
can reside within the memory 270, can be autonomous modules, can be software, can<br>
be hardware, or can be in any other format useful for a module on a wireless<br>
communication device 200.<br>
The display 240 can be a liquid crystal display (LCD), a light emitting diode<br>
(LED) display, a plasma display, or any other means for displaying information. The<br>
transceiver 250 may include a transmitter and/or a receiver. The audio input and<br>
output circuitry 230 can include a microphone, a speaker, a transducer, or any other<br>
audio input and output circuitry. The user interface 260 can include a keypad,<br>
buttons, a touch pad, a joystick, an additional display, or any other device useful for<br>
providing an interface between a user and an electronic device. The memory 270 may<br>
include a random access memory, a read only memory, an optical memory, a<br>
subscriber identity module memory, or any other memory that can be coupled to a<br>
wireless communication device.<br>
In operation, the controller 220 can control the operations of the wireless<br>
communication device 200. The multicast control information module 290 can<br>
receive control information needed for reception of a local multicast service on a<br>
serving cell. This information can include information common to multiple serving or<br>
extended serving cells, such as a notification that a service transmission will begin,<br>
how the local multicast service is configured in the air interface, and other<br>
information. The transceiver 250 can receive information regarding at least one<br>
extended serving cell, the extended serving cell being a cell where no wireless<br>
communication device desiring the local multicast service resides. The receiver<br>
characteristic adjustment module 292 can adjust at least one receiver characteristic of<br>
the wireless communication device transceiver 250 based on the information<br>
regarding the at least one extended serving cell. For example, the receiver<br>
characteristic adjustment module 294 can adjust at least one receiver characteristic<br>
based on the extended serving cell blocking a resource element related to transmission<br>
of the local multicast service on the serving cell. The receiver characteristic<br>
adjustment module 292 can also adjust at least one receiver characteristic by applying<br>
antenna adaptive algorithm weights for combining multiple antenna signals from the<br>
antennas 280 and 282.<br>
In operation according to a related embodiment, the receiver in the transceiver<br>
250 can receive information regarding serving cells that are transmitting a common<br>
multicast transmission. The receiver can also receive the common multicast<br>
transmission, at least a portion of which is transmitted on the same resource on<br>
multiple serving cells. The receiver can additionally receive a common broadcast<br>
pilot signal related to the common multicast transmission, the common broadcast pilot<br>
signal being common to multiple cells. The multicast transmission decoder 294 can<br>
decode the common multicast transmission. The receiver characteristic adjustment<br>
module 292 can adapt characteristics of the receiver in response to receiving the<br>
information regarding the serving cells. The antennas 280 and 282 can comprise an<br>
antenna array. The receiver characteristic adjustment module 292 can adapt the<br>
antenna array in response to receiving the information regarding the serving cells. A<br>
user interface can present the common multicast transmission to a user of the wireless<br>
device 200. For example, the common multicast transmission can be presented via<br>
the display 240, the audio input and output 230 and/or the user interface 260.<br>
Fig. 3 is an exemplary block diagram of a controller 300, such as the network<br>
controller 140, according to one embodiment. The controller 300 can include a<br>
housing 310, a processor 320 coupled to the housing 310, a network connection 350<br>
coupled to the processor 320, media content storage 360 coupled to the processor 320,<br>
and a memory 370 coupled to the processor 320. The media content storage 360 may<br>
be autonomous or may be located in the memory 370. The controller 300 can also<br>
include a counting module 390, a serving cell selection module 392, an extended<br>
serving cell selection module 394, a serving cell signaling module 396, and a<br>
transmission characteristic adjustment module 398. The counting module 390, the<br>
serving cell selection module 392, the extended serving cell selection module 394, the<br>
serving cell signaling module 396, and the transmission characteristic adjustment<br>
module 398 can reside within the controller 320, can reside within the memory 370,<br>
can be autonomous modules, can be software, can be hardware, or can be in any other<br>
format useful for a module on a controller. Also, each element of the controller 300<br>
may be located at the network controller 140 or may be distributed throughout the<br>
network 110. For example, the media content 360 may be located at a media content<br>
provider, other elements may be located at different network controllers, and other<br>
elements may be located at different base stations on the network 110.<br>
In operation, the processor 320 can control the operations of the controller<br>
300. The counting module 390 can determine cells in which user equipment resides<br>
that desire a common multicast service. The serving cell selection module 392 can<br>
select at least one serving cell for transmitting the common multicast service, where<br>
the selection is based on the determination. The extended serving cell selection<br>
module 394 can select at least one extended serving cell from at least one serving cell<br>
neighbor cell which where no user equipment resides that desires the common<br>
multicast service, the extended serving cell influencing transmissions on the serving<br>
cell. The extended serving cell selection module 394 can also select the at least one<br>
extended serving cell based on the at least one extended serving cell having a large<br>
average interference with the serving cell. The network connection 350 can send the<br>
common multicast service for transmission on the selected at least one serving cell.<br>
The transmission characteristic adjustment module 398 can adjust<br>
transmission characteristics on the extended serving cell to influence the transmission<br>
of the common multicast service on the selected at least one serving cell. For<br>
example, the transmission characteristic adjustment module 398 can adjust the<br>
transmission characteristics to transmit the common multicast service on the extended<br>
serving cell to influence the transmission of the common multicast service on the<br>
selected at least one serving cell. As another example, the transmission characteristic<br>
adjustment module 398 can also block transmission on a resource of the extended<br>
serving cell, where transmitting on the resource would influence the transmission of<br>
the common multicast service on the selected at least one serving cell. The processor<br>
320 can indicate, via the network connection 350, to user equipment on the selected at<br>
least one serving cell that there is an unused resource on at least one neighbor cell.<br>
The processor 320 can also indicate, via the network connection 350, to the user<br>
equipment on the selected at least one serving cell, the resource element used on the<br>
serving cell and which extended serving cells block the same resource. The user<br>
equipment can then adjust receiver characteristics and/or antenna characteristics more<br>
efficiently based on the knowledge of transmission characteristics of the neighbor<br>
cells. The processor 320 can detect a need to change the service area including adding<br>
or removing a serving cell and the extended serving cell selection module 394 can<br>
adjust an extended service area including adding or removing an extended serving cell<br>
based on the processor 320 detecting the change.<br>
In operation according to a related embodiment, the serving cell signaling<br>
module 396 can signal to user equipment a signal indicating the relationship between<br>
cells with respect to serving cells transmitting a common multicast transmission. The<br>
network connection 350 can send a signal for transmitting at least a portion of the<br>
common multicast transmission on the same resource on each serving cell. The<br>
network connection 350 sends a signal for transmitting a pilot signal on each serving<br>
cell, the pilot signal related to the at least a portion of the common multicast<br>
transmission on each serving cell, The network connection 350 can send a signal for<br>
transmitting an interfering signal and a related pilot on at least one different cell from<br>
the serving cells. The pilot transmitted on each serving cell can be a phase reference<br>
for the common multicast transmission, and can be the same signal transmitted on<br>
multiple serving cells. The signal indicating the relationship between cells can<br>
indicate which cells are serving cells transmitting a common multicast transmission.<br>
The signal indicating the relationship between cells can also indicate the identity of a<br>
cell, such as an extended serving cell, that is transmitting on the same resource as the<br>
serving cells. The signal indicating the relationship between cells can additionally<br>
indicate the identity of a cell, such as an extended serving cell, that does not transmit<br>
on the same resource as the serving cells.<br>
Fig. 4 is an exemplary flowchart 400 illustrating the operation of the network<br>
controller 140 according to another embodiment. In step 410, the flowchart begins.<br>
In step 420, the controller 140 can determine cells in which user equipment, such as<br>
terminals 120, reside that desire a common multicast service. In step 430, the<br>
controller 140 can select at least one serving cell 112 for transmitting the common<br>
multicast service, where the selection is based on the determination. In step 440, the<br>
network controller 140 can select at least one extended serving cell 114 from at least<br>
one serving cell 112 neighbor cell where no user equipment that desires the common<br>
multicast service resides, the extended serving cell influencing transmissions on the<br>
serving cell. Selecting at least one extended serving cell can include selecting the at<br>
least one extended serving cell 114 based on the at least one extended serving cell 114<br>
having a large average interference with the serving cell 112.<br>
In step 450, the controller 140 can adjust transmission characteristics on the<br>
extended serving cell 114 to influence the transmission of the common multicast<br>
service on the selected at least one serving cell 112. The controller 140 can adjust the<br>
transmission characteristics to transmit the common multicast service on the extended<br>
serving cell 114 to influence the transmission of the common multicast service on the<br>
selected at least one serving cell 112. The controller 140 can also adjust transmission<br>
characteristics to block transmission on a resource of the extended serving cell 114,<br>
where transmitting on the resource would influence the transmission of the common<br>
multicast service on the selected at least one serving cell 112. In step 460, the<br>
controller 140 can indicate to the user equipment 120 on the selected at least one<br>
serving cell 112 that there is an unused resource on at least one neighbor cell. The<br>
controller 140 can also indicate, to the user equipment 120 on the selected at least one<br>
serving cell 112, the resource element used on the serving cell and indicate which<br>
extended serving cells 114 block the same resource. The controller 140 can also<br>
signal the power of a transmitted physical channel on an extended serving cell 114 to<br>
the user equipment 120 on the selected at least one serving cell 112. In step 470, the<br>
controller 140 can transmit the common multicast service on the selected at least one<br>
serving cell 112. While transmitting the common multicast service, the controller 140<br>
can detect a change in a service area including the serving cell 112 and adjust an<br>
extended service area including the extended serving cell 114 based on detecting the<br>
change. In step 480, the flowchart 400 ends.<br>
Fig. 5 is an exemplary flowchart 500 illustrating the operation of a wireless<br>
communication device 200 according to another embodiment. In step 510, the<br>
flowchart begins. In step 520, the wireless communication device 200 can receive<br>
control information needed for reception of a local multicast service on a serving cell<br>
112. This information can include information common to multiple serving or<br>
extended serving cells, such as a notification that a service transmission will begin,<br>
how the local multicast service is configured in the air interface, and other<br>
information. In step 530, the wireless communication device 200 can receive<br>
information regarding at least one extended serving cell 114, the extended serving cell<br>
114 not including a wireless communication device desiring the local multicast<br>
service. In step 540, the wireless communication device 200 can adjust at least one<br>
receiver characteristic of the wireless communication device 200 based on the<br>
information regarding the at least one extended serving cell 114. Adjusting can<br>
include adjusting receiver characteristics based on the extended serving cell 114<br>
blocking a resource element related to transmission of the local multicast service on<br>
the serving cell 112. Adjusting can additionally include applying antenna adaptive<br>
algorithm weights for combining multiple antenna signals. In step 550, the wireless<br>
communication device 200 can receive the common multicast transmission, can<br>
receive a common pilot signal from one cell, and can receive a common broadcast<br>
pilot signal from multiple cells. In step 560, the wireless communication device 200<br>
can combine a transmission from the at least one extended serving cell 114 with a<br>
transmission from the serving cell 112. In step 570, the flowchart 500 can end.<br>
Fig. 6 is an exemplary illustration of a system 600, such as the system 100,<br>
according to another embodiment. The system 600 can include a terminal 610, such<br>
as a terminal 120, and cells 620, 630, 640, and 650. The cells 620, 630, and 640 may<br>
be located at the same site as the base stations containing serving cells 112. The cell<br>
650 may be located in another base station containing cell 116 or an extended serving<br>
cell 114. The terminal 120 may be a wireless communication device 200 and can<br>
include an antenna array 615.<br>
In operation, multicasting radio systems can transmit the same signal from<br>
different cells or sites, such as cells 620, 630, and 640 in order to improve coverage.<br>
If a pilot is used for channel estimation purposes, the pilot portion of the transmitted<br>
signal can be normally transmitted in a similar or the same way as the data traffic so<br>
that the channel affecting data may be estimated from the pilot. Therefore, the pilot<br>
can be "related" to the data traffic transmission. For example, the pilot and data can<br>
be transmitted on similar antenna patterns, on similar frequencies, at close times, etc.<br>
This similarly transmitted pilot or "common broadcast pilot" may then be used to<br>
determine the channel that the data portion of the transmitted signal passes through,<br>
and so may be used in a receiver to decode the data.<br>
The terminal 610 may adapt its receiver to maximize the received signal to<br>
noise ratio (SNR) of a desired signal, or it may maximize the received signal to<br>
interference and noise ratio (SINR). Since the performance of a cellular radio<br>
telecommunication system is typically limited by interference, maximizing SINR<br>
generally gives better performance than maximizing SNR. A multiple antenna<br>
terminal 610 can be particularly effective at maximizing SINR, as it can adapt its<br>
antenna patterns such that the pattern magnitude is large in the direction of the desired<br>
transmission, and small in the direction of an interfering transmission. According to<br>
one embodiment, the present disclosure supports these maximum SINR receivers.<br>
A maximum SNR receiver is described to contrast its operation with<br>
maximum SINR receivers. An illustrative case is where the channel impulse response<br>
from a cell antenna 620 to a terminal 610 may be modeled as a single complex<br>
coefficient, which can be known as "flat Rayleigh fading." This flat fading model can<br>
be appropriate for narrow band transmissions, such as those often found in Frequency<br>
Division Multiple Access (FDMA) or Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing<br>
(OFDM) systems, as well as in certain radio propagation environments. In these<br>
systems and environments, multicasting cells 620, 630, etc. may transmit the same<br>
signal at approximately the same times to the terminal 610, so that when they are<br>
sufficiently synchronized the transmissions can combine such that they appear to be a<br>
single transmission traveling through a channel that is the sum of the individual<br>
channels. The signal received from N of these multicasting transmitters at a terminal<br>
610 with M antennas when both noise and interfering signals are present may be<br>
expressed as:<br><br>
Where:<br>
r is an (Mx1) column vector of the received signals and noise at each of the M<br>
terminal antennas from the N antennas transmitting the common desired signal<br>
h1 is an (Mx1) column vector of the channel impulse response between the ith (of<br>
N) antennas transmitting a desired signal and each of the terminal's antennas<br>
gj is an (Mx1) column vector of the channel impulse response between the jth (of<br>
L) antennas transmitting an interfering signal and each of the terminal's<br>
antennas. Each gj may be estimated from a pilot transmitted in the same way as<br>
the interfering signal, yj.<br>
hd is an (Mxl) column vector of the composite channel impulse response affecting<br>
the transmitted signal and it may be estimated from the common broadcast pilot.<br>
G is an (MxL) matrix, each column containing a gj<br>
n is an (Mxl) column vector of the noise at each of the M UE antennas<br>
x is the desired common transmitted signal from multiple cell antennas<br>
yj is the jth interfering signal<br>
y is an (Lxl) column vector of the interfering signals<br>
When a terminal's antenna array combiner with weights w is used to combine<br>
the received signals, r, the combiner output may be expressed:<br><br>
When we use the common assumption that the noise power on the received<br>
antennas 615 is the same, the received SINR, ?, at the antenna array combiner<br>
output, z , may be expressed as:<br><br>
Where:<br><br>
xH is complex conjugate transpose (the "Hermitian" transpose) of x<br><br>
A maximum SNR receiver matches the array combining weights to the<br>
composite channel, so in this case:<br><br>
Since the maximum SNR receiver only needs estimates of the composite<br>
channel impulse response, hd, in this case the terminal 610 does not need to estimate<br>
the channel impulse responses of the interference. However, maximum SNR<br>
receivers are only optimal in the presence of uncorrelated noise; so when correlated<br>
interference is present (i.e., when off diagonal elements of Rdd are not zero), other<br>
receivers such as a minimum mean squared error (MMSE) receiver can have better<br>
performance. The MMSE receiver uses array combining weights that take the form:<br><br>
RII may be calculated as above using estimates of gj, since each gj may be<br>
estimated from a pilot transmitted in the same way as the interfering signal, yj.<br>
Terminals typically need to know the identities (spreading sequences, scrambling<br>
codes, OFDM subcarriers, or the like) of the pilots used by the interfering transmitters,<br>
so that the gj may be estimated. This information may be signaled to the terminal<br>
610, or may be known apriori by the terminal 610. When the information is signaled<br>
to the terminal 610, it is often desirable to provide the signaling about multiple<br>
interfering cells on a serving cell. This avoids the complexity involved when the<br>
terminal 610 receives control signaling from multiple cells. If the terminal 610 does<br>
not know the identities of the pilots used by the interfering transmitters, or if the pilots<br>
are not transmitted in the same way as the interfering signal (i.e., they are not "related<br>
to" nor "phase references" for the interfering signals), it can be difficult for the<br>
terminal 610 to use the interfering pilots to determine MMSE combining weights.<br>
Terminals often typically have to know which cells are transmitting<br>
interference to calculate RII . This information can be especially important when the<br>
network does not transmit interference on a cell near a terminal 610, since that nearby<br>
cell would otherwise likely be a strong interference source, and the terminal 610<br>
would likely adapt its antenna pattern to attenuate it (reducing its ability to attenuate<br>
other interferes or to receive the desired common transmission). The network may<br>
therefore signal which cells do not transmit on a given channel, and so will not<br>
interfere with a common transmitted signal. Also, as indicated above, the terminal<br>
610 can either be signaled identities of pilots that may be used as phase references for<br>
interfering signals, or the network transmissions can be constrained such that the<br>
terminal 610 knows the identities apriori.<br>
It is also useful for the terminal 610 to know which cells are those that are<br>
transmitting a common transmitted signal, so that they will not be considered as one<br>
of those providing interference (and therefore one of the L transmitters contributing to<br>
the interference terms in RII). This determination can be difficult when only<br>
common broadcast pilot is used, since the N common broadcast pilots from the N<br>
transmitters combine "in the air" to form a single received signal which reduces the<br>
identifiability of the individual transmitters. Therefore, the network may signal on a<br>
serving cell if a nearby cell is one of those transmitting a common transmitted signal.<br>
This knowledge of desired and interfering transmitters and their related pilots<br>
can enable improved terminal SINR performance over the case where only a common<br>
broadcast pilot is used (and where interference can not be controlled as effectively).<br>
The system 600 further illustrates the use of desired and interfering transmitter<br>
and pilot information for the case where a maximum SINR receiver is used. The<br>
terminal's antenna pattern 615 can be adapted to be large in the direction of the<br>
combined transmission, while it is small in the direction of the interfering transmitter<br>
650. The combined transmission can appear to the terminal 610 to be from a single<br>
transmitter and is illustrated as coming from a single direction. While this is not<br>
required in the most literal sense, since adaptive arrays are capable of using a single<br>
degree of freedom to adapt to a coherent transmission such as the combined<br>
transmission contemplated in the preferred embodiment, it is reasonable for the<br>
purposes of illustration in the system 600.<br>
Fig. 7 is an exemplary flowchart 700 illustrating the operation of the network<br>
controller 140 according to another embodiment. In step 710, the flowchart begins.<br>
Fig. 8 is an exemplary flowchart 800 illustrating the operation of a wireless<br>
communication device 200 according to another embodiment. In step 810, the<br>
flowchart begins. In step 820, the wireless communication device 200 can receive<br>
information regarding serving cells 112 that are transmitting a common multicast<br>
transmission. In step 830, the wireless communication device 200 can adapt a<br>
receiver characteristic in response to receiving the information regarding the serving<br>
cells 112. For example, the wireless communication device 200 can adapt a receiver<br>
or an antenna array in response to receiving the information regarding the serving cells<br>
112. As a further example, the wireless communication device 200 can attenuate an<br>
interfering signal by adapting its receiver to attenuate interference using the<br>
information regarding serving cells. In step 840, the wireless communication device<br>
200 can receive the common multicast transmission, at least a portion of which is<br>
transmitted on the same resource on multiple serving cells 112. In step 850, the<br>
wireless communication device 200 can receive a common broadcast pilot signal<br>
related to the common multicast transmission, the common broadcast pilot signal<br>
being common to multiple cells. In steps 840 and 850, the wireless communication<br>
device 200 can also receive an interfering signal and a related pilot from a different<br>
cell 114 from the serving cells 112. In step 860, the wireless communication device<br>
200 can adapt a receiver characteristic in response to receiving the broadcast pilot.<br>
For example, the wireless communication device 200 can adapt a receiver or an<br>
antenna array in response to receiving the broadcast pilot. As a further example, the<br>
wireless communication device 200 can attenuate an interfering signal by adapting the<br>
receiver to attenuate interference using the information regarding serving cells and the<br>
common broadcast pilot signal and the pilot related to the interfering signal. In step<br>
870, the wireless communication device 200 can decode the common multicast<br>
transmission. In step 880, the wireless communication device 200 can present the<br>
common multicast transmission to a user of the wireless device via a user interface.<br>
In step 890, the flowchart 800 can end.<br>
Thus, the present disclosure can provide neighbor assisted localized multicast.<br>
For example, when a session starts, counting can be performed by a network.<br>
Counting can be performed by having each cell report its user status, such as radio<br>
bearer status to a controller such as a Radio Network Controller. The cells wherein<br>
users reside that desire a multicast session can form a service area. The controller can<br>
choose appropriate cells except the cells in the serving area, which are the candidates<br>
for the strongest interference for the cells in the serving area. These cells can form an<br>
extended serving area. The controller can control the cells in the extended serving<br>
area to either broadcast the same data as the cells in the serving area, in the case that<br>
cell power is available or block resource element that is used by the cell in the serving<br>
area, in the case that cell power is unavailable. The service area may change by a user<br>
moving between cells, by a user joining a session after it starts, or by any other similar<br>
event. If the service area changes during the session transmission, the controller may<br>
adjust the extended serving area as well.<br>
The present disclosure can allow interference to be more finely controlled than<br>
existing simulcast or single frequency networks. For example, both the coverage area<br>
and interference sources can be explicitly controlled. This can allow greater spectral<br>
efficiency per unit area and better coverage due to the precise control over interference<br>
and a terminal's knowledge of desired and interfering sources. For example, a<br>
controller can signal information on which neighbor cells have reserved and are not<br>
transmitting on a resource element that a serving cell is transmitting on. This<br>
information can allow the terminal to configure an optimum receiver in the terminal.<br>
The controller can also signal which neighbor cells are transmitting identically on a<br>
resource element, that a serving cell is transmitting on. For example, transmitting<br>
identically on a resource element can mean that the signals are transmitted such that<br>
when the channel combines the signals from any two cells, the terminal cannot<br>
distinguish the transmissions from the two cells when the channels are within a scale<br>
factor of each other. This can use identical scrambling, spreading, interleaving, or the<br>
like. The controller can signal the information above on the serving cell.<br>
The method of this disclosure is preferably implemented on a programmed<br>
processor. However, the controllers, flowcharts, and modules may also be<br>
implemented on a general purpose or special purpose computer, a programmed<br>
microprocessor or microcontroller and peripheral integrated circuit elements, an ASIC<br>
or other integrated circuit, a hardware electronic or logic circuit such as a discrete<br>
element circuit, a programmable logic device such as a PLD, PLA, FPGA or PAL, or<br>
the like. In general, any device on which resides a finite state machine capable of<br>
In step 720, the controller 140 can determine cells in which user equipment, such as<br>
terminals 120, reside that desire a common multicast service and select at least one<br>
serving cell 112 for transmitting the common multicast service. In step 730, the<br>
controller 140 can send a signal to user equipment indicating the relationship between<br>
cells with respect to serving cells 112 transmitting a common multicast transmission.<br>
The signal can be a signal indicating which cells are serving cells 112 transmitting a<br>
common multicast transmission and/or a signal indicating the identity of another cell,<br>
such as an extended serving cell 114, which is transmitting on the same resource as<br>
the serving cells. In step 740, the controller 140 can transmit at least a portion of the<br>
common multicast transmission on the same resource on each serving cell 112. The<br>
common multicast transmission can be determined from a single information stream,<br>
such as from a media content server, for broadcast to multiple users at multiple<br>
locations. The common multicast transmission can be transmitted on the serving cells<br>
112 using the same physical layer attributes on each serving cell 112. The same<br>
physical layer attributes can be the same resource element, as well as the same<br>
spreading, the same channel coding, the same error detection coding (such as a cyclic<br>
redundancy check on the payload data), the same time frequency resources, the same<br>
frequency hopping pattern, and the like. In step 750, the controller 140 can transmit a<br>
pilot signal on each serving cell 112, the pilot signal related to the at least a portion of<br>
the common multicast transmission on each serving cell 112. The pilot transmitted on<br>
each serving cell 112 can be a phase reference for the common multicast transmission<br>
and can be the same signal transmitted on multiple serving cells 112. In step 760, the<br>
controller 140 can transmit an interfering signal and a related pilot on at least one<br>
different cell from the serving cells, such as an extended serving cell 114. In step 770,<br>
the controller 140 can signal to a transmitting base station an indicator indicating not<br>
to transmit on a resource on a non-serving cell, such as on an extended serving cell<br>
114. In step 780, the controller 140 can signal to user equipment the identity of a cell,<br>
such as an extended serving cell 114, which does not transmit on the same resource as<br>
the serving cells. The same resource on each serving cell 112 can be the same slot,<br>
the same frequency, the same period, the same Walsh codes, and the like on each<br>
serving cell 112. In step 790, the flowchart 700 can end.<br>
implementing the flowcharts shown in the Figures may be used to implement the<br>
processor functions of this disclosure.<br>

is evident that many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art. For example, various components of the embodiments may be<br>
interchanged, added, or substituted in the other embodiments. Also, all of the<br>
elements of each figure are not necessary for operation of the disclosed embodiments.<br>
