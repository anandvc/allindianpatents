				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
A Contact-less Smart Card reader system<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Smart Cards are used in several applications worldwide. Their uses vary from pre-paid telephone cards to bank transaction cards to driver's license to identifications cards. The smart card consists of chips which could contain input / output (I/O) interfaces, power supply, a central processing unit (CPU), read only memory (ROM), random access memory (RAM) and a non-volatile memory that can be read and written to. The non-volatile memory is where the data specific to the card which is usually secure (cash balance, identity, etc.) is stored.<br>
Traditionally, smart cards were read with a 'reader' by making physical contact to it. However, due to the increased wear and tear and increased cost of maintaining such systems, smart cards have moved to contact-less readers. Here the card is placed within the prescribed range of the reader and the information in the card is read, processed and any information necessary is written into the card. The absence of physical contact has been found to be a much quicker method of accessing the information and also the maintenance costs of the readers have been brought down.<br>
One of the main challenges in the implementation of such reader systems is the low power with which the circuits on the contact-leass smart cards have to operate. The information is transferred by the RF signals, which is also the source of power for the card. Hence, the amount o power that can be transmitted from the reader (and this is regulated) limits the power that can be coupled to the circuits on the card. This in turn limits the sophistication of the circuits that can be placed on the card. The power transfer<br>
also forces the noise margin in the signal transmitted to the card to be lower - which is<br>
not a desirable situation.<br>
One way to overcome the problem of power transfer to the card is to place a battery on<br>
the card. This method has its limitations as the battery has a finite lifetime and will<br>
eventually need replacement. Moreover the cost and weight of the card goes up<br>
considerably. Emphasis has also been laid on designing the circuits on the card that<br>
operate with lower power. Such circuits are designed to work with low noise margin, and<br>
have a limited range in terms of the distance of the card from the reader. Also, as the<br>
circuits are designed for low power operation, such circuits have limited complexity.<br>
French patent FR2743021 discloses an autonomous display, allowing immediate reading<br>
of the value stored on the card. The autonomous display comprises a window housing a<br>
liquid crystal display that is connected to the operating system of the smart card. The<br>
liquid crystal display is supplied with energy by a photovoltaic cell. The photovoltaic cell<br>
also supplies transistors that provide the connection between the chip on the smart card<br>
and the display. The display window is formed on one face of the plastic support forming<br>
the card, and a window for the photovoltaic cell is on the same face. This photovoltaic<br>
cell is limited to providing power to a display and does not talk about providing<br>
additional power source to the operation of the circuitry in the card. Additionally, the<br>
invention does not discuss about the source or energy (light) being located on the reader<br>
which can be activated when the card is in operation.<br>
Hence, there is need for providing an apparatus/methodology of contact-less transmission<br>
of power to a smart card. There is also need for a system which does not put a limit on<br>
the complexity of circuitry on a smart card. Furthermore, there is need for a power<br>
efficient reader system with control circuitry for controlling the operation of power<br>
source in the reader. Additionally, there is need of a reader system which can transfer<br>
power to the card using multiple power sources.<br>

contact-less smart card reader system and a method for contact-less power transfer in said<br>
reader system<br>

Brief Descriptions of the Drawings<br>
The present invention is described with the help of accompanying drawings:<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a Contact-less smart card reader system in accordance to the instant<br>
invention.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the flowchart for the method for the operation of the Contact-less smart<br>
card reader system in accordance to the instant invention.<br>
Detail Description of the Invention<br>
The main idea of this invention is to provide energy for smart cards with the help of<br>
energy source(s) on the reader. The energy is collected using an energy receptor cell<br>
present on the smart card. The energy source on the reader is turned on only when the<br>
card is brought near the reader. The energy source may also be used as a supplementary"<br>
source of power along with the RF signal used as a source of power. Alternatively, other<br>
energy sources available in the environment may be used.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the preferred embodiment for the invention with the optical energy<br>
source in the reader. The said system comprises a contact-less smart card (1.1) and a<br>
reader (1.2). The smart card comprises an antenna (1.1.2) for receiving RF signals, a chip<br>
(1.1.3) with circuitry for smart card operations and a photovoltaic cell (1.1.1). The reader<br>
comprises of an optical light source (1.2.1) with a controller and reader RF circuitry<br>
(1.2.2) for communicating with the smart card. A photovoltaic cell (1.1.1) on the smart<br>
card (1.1) is used as the energy receptor cell for the operation of the smart card. The<br>
photovoltaic cell (1.1.1) is charged using signals (1.1.4) with a range of frequencies<br>
ranging from 1.5 x 1014 Hz to 3 x 10 15 Hz, The reader has a light source (1.2.1) which is<br>
used to charge the photovoltaic cell on the smart card.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates this method for operation of the reader system. The proposed solution<br>
in the preferred embodiment of the invention is to have a photovoltaic cell (1.1.1) on the<br>
card (1.1). The optical power (1.1.4) to the photovoltaic cell (1.1.1) is provided by a light<br>
source, which is placed on the reader (2.1 and 2.2). The light from light source on the<br>
reader falls on the cell in the smart card when it is brought near the reader (2.3). The<br>
light then generates power with the help of the photovoltaic cell on the smart card (2.4).<br>
This power drives the circuitry on the chip for information transfer (2.5).<br>
The power coupled by the conventional RF source (1.2.2) to the chip (1.1.3) through the<br>
antenna (1.1.2) will be 100s of nW to a few mW. One can easily achieve 10s to 100s of<br>
mW of power or even more, coupled by the use of photovoltaic cells (1.1.1), which can<br>
be made available to the chip (1.1.3). For optimal energy transfer, the spectrum of<br>
efficient energy conversion of the photovoltaic cell (1.1.1) should be similar to the<br>
spectrum of the light source (1.2.1).<br>
A person skilled in the art will understand that there may be several different<br>
embodiments for the invention. In one of the embodiment, in order to avoid the condition<br>
where the light source (1.2.1) on the reader (1.2) is on all the time including the time<br>
when it is not reading any smart cards. Therefore, one may turn on this light by using RF<br>
signal which detects the card's presence and turns on the light. There may be a controller<br>
added in the RF circuitry (1.2.2) of the reader for actuating the light source (1.2.1) in the<br>
presence of a smart card (2.4 and 2.7). In yet another embodiment, one may use laser<br>
beams emanating from the reader (1.2) to provide the energy to the card (1.1). In yet<br>
another embodiment, the energy source may be an ambient light source for charging the<br>
smart card in the absence of a light source in a reader. The invention covers all such<br>
embodiments for the reader system.<br>
The smart card (1.1) has a source of energy which is more efficient than what was<br>
previously available. The photovoltaic cells (1.1.1) can be easily packed within the smart<br>
card (LI) with the existing technology. With the advent of organic solar cells, this will<br>
become easier in the coming days. With increased power available for circuit operations,<br>
some of the perceived advantages are - the design constraints of circuits for the smartcard<br>
chip (1.1.3) will be simpler, circuit functioning complexity may be increased and<br>
memory size available on chip will increase.<br><br><br>
