hydroxide (20 ml) was added till pH of reaction mass become 7.2. 2-Thiophene acetyl chloride (70.0 gm) in ethyl acetate (110 ml) was added dropwise over 15 minutes at 20 °C and maintained at the same temperature till completion of reaction. After completion of reaction, ethyl acetate (1060 ml) was added, pH was adjusted to 1.7 using 1:1 hydrochloric acid, and layer was separated. To ethyl acetate layer anhydrous sodium acetate (39.0 gm) in methanol (340 ml) was added at 15-20 °C, and stirred 30 minutes. The solid obtained was filtered, washed with ethyl acetate dried under reduced pressure to give title compound (139 gm).<br>

Methane sulfonic acid (25.3 gm) was added and cooled to -90 °C. N-Chlorosuccinimide (60.8 gm) was added followed by sodium methoxide solution (337.3 gm) in methanol (160 ml) was added slowly at -90 °C. The reaction mass was stirred till completion of reaction, after completion of reaction sodium metabisulphite (20.6 gm), aqueous acetic acid (150 ml) and sodium chloride solution (189 gm in 1164 ml water) were added at -90 ""C. After addition, 1:1 HCl (23.5 ml) was added at 0 °C, then layer was separated, organic layer was washed with water and distilled of organic layer until final volume becomes (500 ml). To this mass cyclohexyl amine in acetone was added dropwise till pH becomes 6.5. IPE was added and stirred reaction mass for 2 hour at 0 °C. The solid obtained was filtered, washed with acetone and dried to get the title compound (101.0 gm).<br>

Reaction mass was stirred till completion of the reaction. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mass was added into cold DM water and stirred for 2 hours. Ethyl acetate (1277.0 ml) was added, the byproduct obtained was filtered and washed with ethyl acetate/water mixture. To the filtrate 10% sodium chloride solution (225 ml) was added, stirred 10 minutes then layer was separated. The organic layer was washed with 10% sodium chloride solution. The product was extracted with mixture of sodium bicarbonate solution and sodium chloride solution. The pH of aqueous solution was adjusted to 2.0 with 1:1 HCl and cooled to 10 °C.
