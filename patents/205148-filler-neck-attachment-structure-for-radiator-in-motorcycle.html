PROVISIONAL/COMPLETE SPECIFICATION [See Section 10]<br>
FILLER NECK ATTACHMENT STRUCTURE FOR RADIATOR IN MOTORCYCLE<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan,,   1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome,, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br>
GRANTED<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to an improvement for mounting a filler neck of a radiator in two-wheeled motor-driven vehicle.<br>
A motorcycle in which a radiator is supported on a power unit that is swingably supported on a vehicle frame is known from Japanese Utility Model Publication No. Sho 62-45993, for example.<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br><br><br>
In the above conventional arrangement, the upper end of a water supply pipe extending upwardly from the radiator supported on the power unit is supported on the vehicle frame below a seat, and the radiator swings vertically with the power unit. Therefore, the water supply pipe has to be arranged so as to absorb changes in the relative position between the vehicle frame and the radiator, resulting in a complex piping structure.<br><br>
According to another structure, a filler neck is directly mounted on a radiator. However, since the filler neck needs to be positioned in a small space between the vehicle frame and the power unit, the filler neck has to be placed in a| relatively low position, so that when water is supplied to the radiator, air is not sufficiently removed from the radiator and the piping, and no sufficient water may be supplied to the radiator etc.<br>
The present invention has been made in view of the above drawbacks. It is an object of the present invention to provide a filler neck attachment structure for a radiator in a motorcycle, which allows sufficient water to be supplied to a radiator without the need for a complex piping structure.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided an importent for mounting filler neck of radiator in two-wheeled motor-driven vehicle, in said two-wheeled motor-driven vehicle, a power unit (P) comprising of a water-cooled engine (E) is supported shakable by a vehicle bode frame (F), rear wheels (Wr) are supported at the rear portion of the power unit (P) by shaft, a radiator is supported on the power unit (P); the device is characterized that, a filler neck connected to a water feed port of a radiator via a flexible water feed pipe is removable mounted on a mounted component which is rocked together with the power unit ; flexible cooling water pipe connecting with the engine to guide the cooling water from the engine (E) is connected to the radiator via the filler neck and the water feed pipe .<br><br>
With the above arrangement, since the filler neck is mounted on the<br>
attachment which is swingable with the power unit, it is not<br>
necessary to construct a piping structure so as to absorb change in<br>
the relative position between the vehicle frame and the radiator,<br>
resulting in a simplified piping structure. Moreover, inasmuch as<br>
the filler neck connected to the water inlet of the radiator by the<br>
flexible water supply pipe is detachably mounted on the attachment,<br>
the filler neck detached from the attachment can be lifted to a<br>
relatively high position while extending the water supply pipe<br>
upwardly. When water is supplied from the filler neck thus elevated<br>
to the radiator, air can sufficiently be removed from the radiator<br>
under a relatively large head difference between the filler neck and<br>
the water inlet of the radiator, so that sufficient water can be<br>
supplied to the radiator, etc.<br><br><br>
According to an invention as described in claim 2  in addition to the arrangement of the invention described in claim 1, a cooling water pipe connected flexibly to the engine for guiding cooling water from the engine is connected to the radiator by the filler neck and the water supply pipe. With this arrangement, even if the radiator is disposed at the same height as or in a position lower than the engine, when water is supplied from the filler neck, no air tends to be trapped in the piping, and water can easily be supplied to the radiator.<br><br><br>

[0010]<br>
In FIGS. 1 and 2, a scooter-type motorcycle V having a front wheel Wf steerable by a steering handle 11 and a rear wheel Wr drivable by a swingable power unit P has a vehicle frame F divided into a front frame 12, a central frame 13, and a rear frame 14.  The front frame 12 is of an integral structure cast of an aluminum alloy which has a head pipe 121 a down tube 122 and a step floor support 123.  The central frame 13, on which the power unit P is vertically swingably supported by a pivot 15, is cast of an aluminum alloy, and is connected to a rear end of the front frame 12.  The rear frame 14, which extends rearwardly and upwardly from the power unit P, is in the form of an annular pipe, and supports a fuel tank 16 on an upper surface thereof.  A helmet case 17 is supported on an upper surface of the central frame 13. The helmet case 17 and the fuel tank 16 are openably and closably covered with a cover 19 having a seat 18 integral therewith.<br>
[0011]<br>
The power unit P comprises a water-cooled single-cylinder 4-cycle engine E with its cylinder directed<br><br>
forwardly of the vehicle, and a belt-type continuously variable transmission T extending rearwardly from a left side of the engine E, the engine E and the transmission T being integrally coupled to each other.  The belt-type continuously variable transmission T has a rear upper surface coupled to a rear end of ,the central frame 13 by a rear cushion 20.  An air cleaner 21 is supported on an upper surface of the belt-type continuously variable transmission T.  A muffler 22 is supported on a right side of the belt-type continuously variable transmission T.  A main stand 23 that can be erected and collapsed is supported on a lower surface of the engine E. [0012]<br>
In FIGS. 3 and 4, the engine E has a first engine block 32 and a second engine block 33 which are divided from each other along a parting plane 30 extending vertically along a crankshaft 31. The first engine block 32 serves as a cylinder block 321 and a crankcase half 322 The second engine block 33 serves as the other crankcase half.  A cylinder head 34 is coupled to a front end of the first engine block 32, and a head cover 35 is coupled to a front end of the cylinder head 34. A generator cover 36 is coupled to coupled to right sides of the first engine block 32 and the second engine block 33.<br><br>
[0013]<br>
The belt-type continuously variable transmission T has a right casing 37 and. a left casing 38 that are coupled to each other.  The right casing 37 has a front right side coupled to the left sides of the first and second engine blocks 32, 33.  A speed reducer casing 39 is coupled to a rear right side of the right casing 37. [0014]<br>
The first engine block 32 has a cylinder 41 in which there is slidably fitted a piston 42 that is connected to the crankshaft 31 by a connecting rod 43.  A camshaft 44 is rotatably supported in the cylinder head 34 for opening and closing intake and exhaust valves (not shown) disposed in the cylinder head 34.  The first engine block 32 has a chain passage 40 defined therein which houses a timing chain 45 that is trained around a drive sprocket 46 mounted on the crankshaft 31 and a driven sprocket 47 mounted on the camshaft 44. The camshaft 44 makes one revolution each time the crankshaft 31 makes two revolutions. [0015]<br>
The crankshaft 31 has a left end projecting into the right casing 37 and the left casing 38, and a drive pulley 54 is mounted on the projecting left end of the<br><br>
crankshaft 31. The drive pulley 54 comprises a fixed pulley cone 55 fixed to the crankshaft 31 and a movable pulley cone 56 movable toward and away from the fixed pulley cone 55. The movable pulley cone 56 is urged to move in a direction toward the fixed pulley cone 55 by a centrifugal weight 57 that moves ,radially outwardly as the crankshaft 31 rotates at an increased rotational speed.<br>
[0016]<br>
A. driven pulley 59 is mounted on an output shaft 58 which is supported between a rear portion of the right casing 37 and the speed reducer casing 39.  The driven pulley 59 comprises a fixed pulley cone 60 relatively rotatably supported on the output shaft 58 and a movable pulley cone 61 movable toward and away from the fixed pulley cone 60.  The movable pulley cone 61 is normally urged to move toward the movable pulley cone 61 by a spring 62.  A starting clutch 63 is mounted between the fixed pulley cone 60 and the output shaft 58.  An endless V-belt 64 is trained around the drive pulley 54 and the driven pulley 59.<br>
[0017]<br>
An intermediate shaft 65 and an axle 66 which extend parallel to the output shaft 58 is supported<br><br>
between the right casing 37 and the speed reducer casing 39. A speed reducer gear train 67 is disposed between the output shaft 58, the intermediate shaft 65, and the axle<br>
66.	The rear wheel Wr is mounted on a right end of the<br>
axle 66 which projects through the speed reducer casing<br>
39 to the right.<br>
[0018]<br>
Rotational power from the crankshaft 31 is transmitted to the drive pulley 54, and then from the drive pulley 54 via the V-belt 64, the driven pulley 59, the starting clutch 63, and the speed reducer gear train<br>
67,	to the rear wheel Wr.<br>
[0019]<br>
When the engine E rotates at a low speed, since centrifugal forces acting on the centrifugal weight 57 of the drive pulley 54 are small, the groove width between the fixed pulley cone 60 and the movable pulley cone 61 is reduced under the bias of the spring 62 of the driven pulley 59, resulting in a speed reduction ratio LOW.  As the rotational speed of the crankshaft 31 increases, centrifugal forces acting on the centrifugal weight 57 increase, reducing the groove width between the fixed pulley cone 55 and the movable pulley cone 56 of the drive pulley 54, and increasing the groove width between<br><br>
the fixed pulley cone 60 and the movable pulley cone 61 of the driven pulley 59.  Therefore, the speed reduction ratio varies continuously from LOW to TOP. [0020]<br>
An AC generator 68 mounted on the right side of the crankshaft 31 is covered with the generator cover 36, and a radiator 69 is disposed on the right side of the generator cover 36. In order to supply cooling air to the radiator 69, a cooling fan 70 fixed to the right end of the crankshaft 31 is disposed between the AC generator 68 and the radiator 69.  The cooling fan 70 and the radiator 69 are covered with a cover 80 of synthetic resin fastened to the generator cover 36.  A louver 81 for introducing air from outside is mounted on an outer side of the cover 80. [0021]<br>
A thermostat case 72 housing a thermostat 71 therein is coupled to a right side of the cylinder head 34.  A cooling water pump 73 mounted on the right end of the camshaft 44 is accommodated in a space surrounded by the cylinder head 34 and the thermostat case 72. [0022]<br>
Referring also to FIG. 5, a front lower portion of the radiator 66 and the thermostat case 72 are connected<br><br><br>
to each other by a cooling water pipe 74, and the thermostat case 72 and the first engine block 32 are connected to each other by a cooling water pipe 75.<br>
[0023]<br>
An attachment plate 76a (see FIG. 4) is mounted on a front portion of a rear fender .76 as an attachment covering the rear wheel Wr from above.  The attachment plate 76a is fastened to the second engine block 32 of the engine E of the power unit P.  Therefore, the rear fender 76 is mounted on the power unit P for swinging movement with the radiator 69.<br>
[0024]<br>
Referring also to FIG. 6, a filler neck) 77 connected to a water inlet 69a defined in a rear upper portion of the radiator 69 by a flexible water supply pipe 79 such as a rubber hose or the like is detachably fastened to the rear fender 76.  Specifically, an attachment plate 77a of the filler neck 77 is detachably fastened to the rear fender 76 by a bolt 82, and an upper end opening of the filler neck 77 is openably and closably closed by a cap 83.  The filler neck 77 has an overflow pipe 77b for discharging a cooling water overflow.  The overflow pipe 77b is connected to a reservoir tank (not shown).<br><br>
[0025]<br>
The filler neck 77 and the cylinder head 34 are connected to each other by a flexible cooling water pipe 78 such as a rubber hose or the like. [0026]<br>
When the warming-up of the. engine E is completed, cooling water discharged by the cooling water pump 73 actuated by the camshaft 44 is supplied via the thermostat case 72 and the cooling water pipe 75 into a water jacket in the first engine block 32 and the cylinder head 34.  While flowing through the water jacket, the cooling water cools the engine E.  Thereafter, the cooling water is supplied via the cooling water pipe 78, the filler neck 77, and the water supply pipe 79 to the radiator 69.  The cooling water whose temperature has dropped while passing through the radiator 69 is returned via the cooling water pipe 74 and the thermostat 71 to the cooling water pump 73.  When the engine E is being warmed up and the temperature of the cooling water is low, the thermostat 71 is operated, and the cooling water circulates in the engine E without passing through the radiator 69, so that the temperature of the cooling water quickly increases. [0027]<br><br>
Operation of the embodiment will be described below, Since the filler neck 77 for supplying water to the radiator 69 supported on the power unit P is mounted on the rear fender 76 that is swingable with the power unit P, it is not necessary to construct a piping structure for absorbing changes in the relative position between the vehicle frame F and the radiator 69, between the filler neck 77 and the radiator 69, and the piping structure employed can be simplified.  [0028]<br>
Furthermore, because the filler neck 77 connected to the water inlet 69a of the radiator 69 through the flexible water supply pipe 79 is detachably mounted on the rear fender 76, the filler neck 77 detached from the rear fender 76 can be lifted to a relatively high position while extending the water supply pipe 79 upwardly, as shown in FIG. 6. When water is supplied from the filler neck 77 thus elevated to the radiator 69, air can sufficiently be removed from the radiator 69 under a relatively large head difference between the filler neck 77 and the water inlet 69a of the radiator 69, so that sufficient water can be supplied to the radiator 69, etc. [0029]<br>
The flexible cooling water pipe 78 connected to the<br><br><br><br><br><br>
cylinder head 34 of the engine E for guiding cooling water from the engine E is connected to the radiator 69 by the filler neck 77 and. the water supply pipe 79.  Even if the radiator 69 is disposed at the same height as or in a position lower than the engine E, when water is supplied from the filler neck 77, no air tends to be trapped in the piping, and water can easily be supplied to the radiator 69.<br>
[0030]<br>
While the embodiment of the present invention has been described in detail, the present invention is not limited the above embodiment, but various design changes may be made therein without departing from the invention as described in the scope of claims for patent.<br>
[0031]<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 1, as described above, it is not necessary to construct a piping structure so as to absorb changes in the relative position between the vehicle frame and the radiator, resulting in a simplified piping structure.  Moreover, the filler neck detached from the attachment can be lifted to a relatively high position while extending the water supply pipe upwardly.  Air can sufficiently be removed<br><br>
from the radiator under a relatively large head difference between the filler neck and the water inlet of the radiator, so that sufficient water can be supplied to the radiator, etc. [0032]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 2, even if the radiator is disposed at the same height as or in a position lower than the engine, when water is supplied from the filler neck, no air tends to be trapped in the piping, and water can easily be supplied to the radiator.<br><br>
