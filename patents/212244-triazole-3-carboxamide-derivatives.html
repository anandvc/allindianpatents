The present invention relates to triazole-3-carboxamide derivatives.<br>
These 1H-1,2,4-triazole-Carboxamide derivatives are potent cannabinoid-CBi receptor agonists, partial agonists, inverse agonists or antagonists, useful for the treatment of psychiatric and neurological disorders, as well as other diseases involving cannabinoid-CBi neurotransmission.<br>
1,5-Diaryl-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide derivatives have been described in EP 0346620 and GB 2120665 as herbicides. Recently 1,2,4-triazoles were described as potential agonists and antagonists of cannabinoid-CBi and -CB2 receptors (Jagerovic, N. et al., Drugs Fut. 2002, 27(Suppl. A): XVIIth Int. Symp. on Medicinal Chemistry, P284)<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that known and new 1,5-diaryl-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide derivatives of the formula (1), as well as prodrugs, salts, and stereo-isomers thereof, are potent antagonists, agonists, inverse agonists or partial agonists of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor:<br><br>
wherein<br>
- R and R1 independently represent a phenyl, naphtyl, thienyl, pyridyl, pyrimidyl, pyrazinyl, pyridazinyl or triazinyl group, which groups may be substituted with 1-4 substituents X, which can be the same or different, from the group branched or unbranched (Ci.3)-alkyl or alkoxy, hydroxy, halogen, trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethylthio, trifluoromethoxy, nitro, amino, mono- or dialkyl (C1-2)-amino, mono- or dialkyi (C1-2)-amido,<br><br>

R4 and R5, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are bonded, form a saturated or unsaturated, monocyclic or bicyclic, heterocyclic moiety having 4 to 10 ring atoms, which heterocyclic group contains one or two heteroatoms from the group N, O or S, which heteroatoms can be the same or different, which heterocyclic moiety may be substituted with a branched or unbranched C1-3 alkyl, hydroxy or trifluoromethyl group or a fluoro atom, or<br>
R2 and R3, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are bonded, form a saturated or unsaturated, monocyclic or bicyclic, heterocyclic moiety having 4 to 10 ring atoms, which heterocyclic group contains one or two heteroatoms from the group N, O or S, which heteroatoms can be the same or different, which heterocyclic moiety may be substituted with a branched or unbranched C1.3 alkyl, hydroxy, piperidinyl or trifluoromethyl group or a fluoro atom.<br>
A group of four 1,5-diaryl-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide derivatives in which the amide N-atom is part of an unsubstituted piperidinyl or morpholinyl group is described by D. Clerin and J.P. Fieury in Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr., 1974, 1-2, Pt.2, 211-217.<br><br>
1-(4-Methylphenyl)-5-phenyl-N-(2-pyridyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide is described by M. H. EInagdi et al. in Heteroatom Chem., 1995, 6, 589-592.<br>
A group of four 1,5-diaryl-N-{2-pyridyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamides is described by A. H. Harhash et al. in Indian J. Chem., 1976, 14B, 268-272.<br>
Due to the potent cannabinoid-CB1 receptor agonistic, partial agonistic, inverse agonistic or antagonistic activity the compounds of the invention are suitable for use in the treatment of psychosis, anxiety, depression, attention deficits, memory disorders, cognitive disorders, appetite disorders, obesity, addiction, appetence, drug dependence, neurodegenerative disorders, dementia, dystonia, muscle spasticity, tremor, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, stroke, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, Huntington's disease, Tourette's syndrome, cerebral ischaemia, cerebral apoplexy, craniocerebral trauma, stroke, spinal cord injury, neuroinflammatory disorders, plaque sclerosis, viral encephalitis, demyelinisation related disorders, as well as for the treatment of pain disorders, including neuropathic pain disorders, septic shock, glaucoma, diabetes, cancer, emesis, nausea, gastrointestinal disorders, gastric ulcers, diarrhoea and cardiovascular disorders.<br>
The affinity of the compounds of the invention for cannabinoid CB1 receptors was determined using membrane preparations of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in which the human cannabinoid CB1 receptor is stably transfected in conjunction with [^H]CP-55,940 as radioligand. After incubation of a freshly prepared cell membrane preparation with the [3H]-ligand, with or without addition of compounds of the invention, separation of bound and free ligand was performed by filtration over glassfiber filters. Radioactivity on the filter was measured by liquid scintillation counting.<br>
The cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonistic, agonistic or partial agonistic activity of compounds of the invention was determined by functional studies using the human CB1 receptor cloned in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. CHO cells were grown in a DMEM culture medium, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Medium was aspirated and replaced by DMEM, without fetal calf serum, but containing pH]-Arachidonic acid and incubated overnight in a cell culture stove (5% C02/95% air; 37 °C; water-saturated atmosphere). During this period [^H]-Arachidonic acid was incorporated in membrane phospholipids. On the test day, medium was aspirated and cells were washed three times using 0.5 ml phosphate-buffered saline, containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Stimulation of the CB1 receptor<br><br>
by WIN 55,212-2 led to activation of PLA2 followed by release of pH]-Arachldonic acid into the medium. This WIN 55,212-2-induced release was concentration-dependently antagonized by CB1 receptor antagonists.<br>
Cannabinoid agonistic or partial agonistic activity of compounds of the invention can be determined according to published methods, such as assessment of in vivo cannabimimetic effects (Wiley, J. L.; Jefferson, R. G; Grier, M. C; Mahadevan, A.; Razdan, R. K.; Martin, B. R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. T/7er 2001, 296, 1013).<br>
The invention relates both to racemates. mixtures of diastereomers and the individual stereoisomers of the compounds having formula (I). Also prodrugs, i.e. compounds which when administered to humans by any known route, are metabolised to compounds having formula (I), belong to the invention. In particular this relates to compounds with primary or secondary amino or hydroxy groups. Such compounds can be reacted with organic acids to yield compounds having formula (I) wherein an additional group is present which is easily removed after administration, for instance, but not limited to amidine, enamine, a Mannich base, a hydroxyl-methylene derivative, an O-(acyloxymethylene carbamate) derivative, carbamate, ester, amide or enaminone.A pro-drug is an inactive compound, which when absorbed is converted into an active form (Medicinal Chemistry: Principles and Practice, 1994, ISBN 0-85186-494-5, Ed.: F. D. King, p. 216).<br>
The compounds of the invention can be brought into forms suitable for administration by means of usual processes using auxiliary substances and/or liquid or solid carrier materials.<br>
Suitable synthetic routes for the compounds of the invention are the following:<br>
Synthetic route A<br>
Step 1: Ester hydrolysis of a compound having formula (II) wherein R6 represents a branched or unbranched (C1-4)-alkyl group or a benzyl group,<br><br><br>
yields a compound having formula (III)<br><br>
wherein R and R1 have the meanings as described above.<br>
The compounds of the invention having formula (II), wherein R6 represents a branched or unbranched alkyl group (C1-4) or benzyl group can be obtained according to methods known, for example:<br>

Synthetic route B<br>
A compound having formula (III) is reacted with a halogenating agent such as thionyl chloride (SOCI2) or oxalyl chloride. This reaction yields the corresponding carbonyl chloride (acid chloride) (IV).<br><br><br>
Reaction of a compound having formula (IV) with a compound having formula R2R3NH wherein wherein R2 and R3 have the meanings as described above gives a 1H-1,2,4-triazole derivative having formula (I).<br>
Synthetic route C<br>
A compound having formula (II) is reacted in an amidation reaction with a compound having formula R2R3NH wherein R2 and R3 have the meanings as described hereinabove to give a 1H-1,2,4-triazole derivative having formula (I). Such amidation reactions can be promoted by the use of trimethylaluminum AI(CH3)3 (For more information on aluminum-mediated conversion of esters to amides, see: J. I. Levin, E. Turos, S. M. Weinreb, Synth Commun. (1982), 12, 989-993.)<br>
Example I<br>
Part A: To a stirred solution of dimethyl aminomalonate hydrochloride (25 gram, 0.136 mol) in dichloromethane (200 mL) triethylamine (41.4 mL, 2.2 molar equivalent) is added at 0 °C. 4-Chlorobenzoyl chloride (23.8 gram, 0.136 mol) is slowly added and the resulting solution is allowed to stand at room temperature overnight.

Melting point: 146-148 °C. ^H-NMR (200 MHz, CDCI3): 8 3.86 (s, 6H), 5.38 (d, J = 6 Hz, 1H), 7.15 (br d, J - 6 Hz, 1H), 7.43 (d, J = 8 Hz, 2H), 7.79 (d. J = 8 Hz, 2H). Part B: To a stirred suspension of 2,4-dichloroaniline (19.44 gram, 0.12 mol) in concentrated HCI (25 mL) and acetic acid ( 75 mL) at 0 °C Is added a solution of NaNO2 (9.0 gram, 0.13 mol) in water (50 mL) and the resulting solution is stirred for 15 minutes. A solution of dimethyl 2-(4-chlorobenzoylamino)-malonate (28.55 gram, 0.10 mol) in acetone (200 mL) is slowly added while keeping the temperature below 0 °C. A solution of K2CO3 (120 gram) in water (200 mL) is slowly added and the resulting black mixture is stirred for 30<br><br>
minutes at 0 °C. The mixture is extracted three times with EtOAc. The collected<br>
organics are washed with water, aqueous NaHCO3 and water, respectively,<br>
dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The residue is<br>
dissolved in methanol (500 mL) and a solution of sodium (1 gram) in methanol<br>
(75 mL) is added. The resulting stirred mixture is allowed to stand overnight at<br>
room temperature and cooled in a refrigerator. The formed precipitate is<br>
collected by filtration and washed with methanol to give methyl 5-(4-<br>
chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-1 H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxylate	(11.4<br>
gram, 30 % yield). Melting point: 153-154 °C. 1H-NMR (200 MHz. CDCI3): 8 4.07 (s, 3H), 7.28-7.60 (m, 7H).<br>

The mixture is concentrated in vacuo and water (150 mL) and concentrated HCI are added. The yellow precipitate is collected by filtration, washed with water and dried in vacuo to give 5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-1 H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxylic acid (10.0 gram, 92 % yield). Melting point: 141-144 °C (decomposition).<br>
Part D: To a stirred solution of 5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxylic acid (1.48 gram, 4.0 mmol) in acetonitrile (20 mL) is successively added diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) (1.5 mL, 2.1 molar equivalent), 0-benzotriazoM-yl-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophos-phate (HBTU) (1.66 gram, 1.1 molar equivalent) and 1-aminopiperidine (0.44 gram, 1.1 molar equivalent). After stirring overnight an aqueous NaHCO3 solution is added. The resulting mixture is three times extracted with dichloromethane. The combined organic layers are washed with water, dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo to give a crude oil (3.6 gram). This oil is further purified by flash chromatography (silica gel; EtOAc / petroleum ether (40-60 °C) = 7/3 (v/v)). The purified material is treated with ethanolic HCI (1M solution) to give 5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-N-(piperidin-1-yl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide hydrochloride (1.50 gram, 77 % yield).
