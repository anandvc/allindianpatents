				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to the development of machine for the production of coated threads parti -The machine of the present invention is particularly useful for the production of Ksharasootra  a herbal coated thread for the treatment of fistula- in -ano.<br>
The advantages associated with this machine are that it is useful for producing uniformly coated, specialised medicated threads such as ksharasootra or non-medicated threads such as kite flying thread, gummed thread, decorated thread and the like, in a very simple and systematic manner with less wastage of raw material, high productivity and at lesser cost of production . A "Gum Coating Device" which is used for coating gum by simple manual rubbing of the device on the surface of the material, to be coated with gum, has been designed by N.S. Rao, (Indian Patent Application No: 155755). This device, however, lacks the ability (i) to produce a thread which is uniformly coated, (ii) to avoid manual use and (iii) to produce auto- wound bobbins. A.K. Mahalaha has Patented a machine useful for coating solid rods. (Indian Application No. 155764). This machine is specifically useful for coating rods of specific lengths and lacks application on softer and lengthy material such as thread etc. The available manual methods of preparing coated thread particularly of, ksharasootra- a herbal thread are associated with the inherent defects such as (i) producing non-uniformly smeared thread (ii) inability on the part of producer to maintain quality and (iii) high labour and cost of production and (iv) wastage of raw material.Except for the above there is no close prior art available in the literature.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a machine for the production of coated threads particularly, Ksharasootra which is useful for the treatment of fistula-in-ano,or non-medicated thread such as kite flying thread, gummed thread, deocrative thread, in a very simple and<br>
systemic manner with less wastage of raw material, high productivity and at lesser cost of production.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to produce coated thread uniformly, and mechanically smeared with desired material such as herbal drugs in the case of Ksharasootra.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to maintain quality, involve minimum manual handling and economy during the production of specialized thread, essential fro its commercial use and also obviates the<br>
Drawbacks associated with traditional cumbersome method of producing products such as Ksharasootra.<br>
The details of the machine of the present invention for the production of Ksharasootra herbal medicated thread have been described below with the help of drawings accompanying these specifications.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the front view of the machine<br>
Fig. 2 shows the sectional side view of the machine along the cutting plane 7W of Fig.l. Fig.3. Shows the top view of the machine.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a machine for the production of coated threads particularly Ksharasootra which comprises a pair of winding drums (1), a feeding drum and a take up drum, characterized in that the said drum (s) being rotatable fixed by bearing/bush (6) on to detachable horizontal parallel shaft (s) (20) for rotary and/or linear movements, a slide (10) being movable fixed in between and parallel on to a rigid bed (2), a carriage (14) having one or more containers (3&amp;4) being movable fixed on the said slide (10), the said containers being provided with inlets/outlets for thread (21) to be coated and having means such as herein described, for coating &amp; removing excess coating material from the coated thread, a rotatable cam &amp; follower mechanism (5,13) mounted on a shaft (12) being provided to provide vertical movement to the said carriage &amp; containers, the said carriage being also provided with means for blowing compressed air on the coated thread (21), the said<br>
connected to a prime mover (19).<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention the drums used may be of circular, regular/irregular polygonal peripheral shape. The means for rotatable fixing the drums may be such as bearing, bush.<br>
The means for coating and removing excess coating material may be such as split die, muslin cloth. The drums(s) are of circular shape when the continuous binding of the coated thread does not affect its quality, particularly of kite flying thread gummed threads, decorated threads. The drums (s) used are of regular polygonal shape having at least 310 mm side when the continuous bending of the coated thread affects its quality particularly of ksharasoota.<br>
Accordingly to a preferred feature of the invention the drums used are of regular polygonal shape for coated threads, the continuous bending of which affects its quality particularly Kasharasootra material. The rums used may be of circular shape for coated threads, the continuous bending of which does not affect its quality particularly kite flying thread, gummed threads, decorative threads etc.<br>
According to further feature a process for production of coated medicated threads such as Ksharasootra or coated non-medicated threads such as kite flying threads, gummed thread, decorated thread using the machine of the present invention.<br>
On the central threaded shaft (11) is mounted a moving slide (10) with a container for the viscous material (3). The thread which is to be given coating and is already wound on one of the drums is passed through a suitably designed die or muslin cloth. The coated thread is wound on the other drum with the spacing in order not to allow the overlapping of the coated thread one over the other. The above said entire mechanisms are mounted on a suitalby fabricated stand (7). Fig 1,11 &amp; III show the front, sectional side, and top views of the horizontal version of the machine which consists of two winding drums(l) of required size and shape, each resting on two bearing housings (6) which while loading or unloading can be easily attached to or detached form the horizontal shafts (20) arranged parallel to each other on a horizontal plane. The hexagonal drums have rotary movements about their axis and the thread with a continuous longitudinal and transverse movements is wound on a definite path on the drum or alternatively the drum may have the combination of both rotary and linear movements parallel to the central threaded shaft (11) powered and rotated simultaneously in the same direction with the same velocity by the threaded shaft (11) which in turn receives its power from a suitably selected electrical geared motor (19) or the like - the source of power supply -and is transmitted to the drums through a V-belt drive (8) or the like and gear train or a sprocket-chain drive (18). The centre to centre distance of both the horizontal shafts are so fixed in order not to allow any shifting of the thread from the inital position with respect to the drum during repeated winding and unwinding.<br>
On the rigid bed (2) of the machine, is mounted a moving slide (10) on which is mounted a carriage (14) with containers for the material to be coated on the thread such as latex (3) and/or kshara and/ or haridra (4) (in case of ksharasootra) and also a compressed air blower to blow low pressure air (not shown in the drawings)/or scrubber or the like to remove the loosely stuck coated material wherever necessary. This bed is firmly fixed on a stand (7) or the like. The rotary movements of the threadeed shaft is also converted into the linear movement of the slide parallel to the axis of rotation of the screw shaft with the help of a nut (17). Especially in case of specialised threads such as ksharasootra, thread is being wound on non circular drums etc. so that the portion of the coated thread to be cut off at the end of the complete production process will be a straight one. The carriage (14) on which the containers are placed is allowed to move up and down by a suitably designed cam (5) and follower (13). The cam is fitted on another plain shaft (12) with key ways and horinzontally placed above the threaded shaft. The plain shaft (12) receives its rotation from the threaded shaft (11) through a pair of toothed gears (15&amp; 16). As the plain shaft rotates, the cam also rotates and simultaneously move along the shaft. One end of the thread which is to be coated is wound on one of the drums and is picked up and tied with other empty drum by passing through a suitably selected muslin cloth or split dies placed below the containers. The free ends of the thread are tied to small rings and the thread is kept under resonable tension by holding these rings by a suitably sleeted spring on the drum spokes. The muslin cloth or split dies are constantly kept wet with coating material by passing it through a tube projecting downward from the container (3). The same machine can be utilised for giving as many number of coatings, with the same material or different materials, as may be required for producing specialised products such as ksharasootra or the like.<br>
At the end of each coating, the slide actuates a limit switch and stops the machine and the loaded<br>
drum is taken out for further processing or drying in an incubator wherever required. A new drum if<br>
fitted on the other shaft. With the help of a reverse switch the machine is reversed, the carriage,<br>
drum, etc., start moving in the opposite direction.<br>
OPERATION OF THE MACHINE<br>
The above thread smearing machine invented for the production of coated threads can be operated<br>
by carefylly following the below described steps:<br>
1.	Check all the electrical connections before starting the machine and check all the moving parts for their proper lubrication and position.<br>
2.	Load the already wound drum on one of the shafts as per the sequence of winding.<br>
3.	Pick up the starting end of the thread tied to a small ring and place it on the hook of the other receiving drum. While doing so the thread is carefully passed through the coating materials such as latex, kshara, haridra or gum containers kept on the moving slide.<br>
4.	While doing so ensure that there should not be any shifting of thread on the drum. This can be achieved by keeping a mark not only on the thread but also on the corresponding position on the drum.<br>
5.	Now the predetermined quantity of coating material is kept in their respective containers and the machine is started.<br>
6.	The complete winding of the drum takes a pre-established period which depends upon the length of the thread wound on the drum.<br>
7.	At the end of the winding the moving slide activates a limit switch which stops the machine by cutting off the power supply to the electric motor.<br>
8.	Now the other free end of thread is picked up and is carefully placed in the hook at the other and of the receiving drum.<br>
9.	The complete winding takes reasonably lesser duration of time depending up on the size of the machine and the length of the thread to be wound on the drum.<br><br>
10.	At the end of the winding, the moving slide actuates another limit switch and stops the machine by cutting off the power supply to the electric motor.<br>
11.	The drum with coated thread is taken out for further drying in the incubator if required. In the main embodiment of the present invention, a machine has been described which is useful for the production of coated threads such as Ksharasootra,- a herbal medicated thread-useful for the treatment of fistul-in-ano, kite flying tread, gummed thread, decorative thread and the like.<br>
The main advantages of this invention are: i)   It is a very simple machine which can be operated by a semiskilled   labour. ii) The accuracy of smeared thred produced is high , compared to the<br>
manually produced ones, iii) Wastage of the raw material is less, iv) High productivity and hence lesser cost of production. v)   Requires minimum manual handling. vi) The advantages associated with hine for the production of<br>
specialised thread such as *_»»xra&gt;ev«r<r will be obvious to persons></r>
skilled in the art.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
