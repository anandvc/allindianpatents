and an opening 64 in said housing through which said indications are visible;<br>
wherein said band comprises a first end connected to said drive unit such that<br>
when said drive unit is released from its non-delivery state, said band moves<br>
through said guide means.<br>
The indications are a start indication for informing the user that the device is ready<br>
for a medicament delivery, a progress indication for informing the user that the<br>
medicament delivery is in progress, and a final indication for informing the user<br>
that the medicament delivery has come to an end.<br>
The embodiment of the medicament delivery device shown in the drawings is in<br>
the form of an injection device, but it can also be an inhaler or other type of<br>
medicament delivery device. As seen in the figures, a cap 12 is mounted in the<br>
proximal end of the housing; the container 14 is of the syringe type having adapted<br>
a delivery member, e.g. an injection needle 32, Fig. 2.<br>
The power source, which is shown in the embodiment, is a coil spring of band<br>
material 20 as e.g. a constant force spring, a negative gradient force spring, but it<br>
s not limited to such a spring. It can also be e.g. a spiral spring, a gas spring, a<br>
motor or the like arranged to be in a cocked state wherein accumulated energy is<br>
stored. The power source is connected in a known manner to the plunger rod.<br>
The retaining means 26 comprises a latch releasably connected in a known<br>
manner to the plunger rod for retaining said drive unit in its non-delivery state.<br>
The activation means comprises a needle shield 36 or alternatively a button<br>
slidably positioned through the housing, operably connected to said retaining<br>
means for releasing said drive unit from its non-delivery state, upon actively<br>
operation by an user, such that said accumulated energy stored in the power<br>
source is transferred to the plunger rod for driving the stopper a predetermined<br>
distance whereby the medicament within said container is expelled, The activation<br>
means further comprises at least one resilient means 30 which function will be<br>
described below.<br>
In the embodiment shown, the container 14 comprises an injection needle, in its<br>
proximal end and the cap 12 comprises a shield for protecting the injection needle.<br>
Moreover, the container 14 preferably comprises a flange 34 at its distal end which<br>
abuts a periphery surface of the container holder for preventing movement of the<br>
container.<br>
The needle shield 36 is arranged as a tubular member wherein a proximal portion<br>
of said tubular member extends outside the housing 10 towards the proximal end<br>
of the device substantially covering the delivery member when the drive unit is in<br>
its non-delivery state. An outwardly annular ledge 38 extending radially from the<br>
distal end of the tubular member is arranged abutting a ledge on the inner surface<br>
of the housing when the drive unit is in its non-delivery state. Further, the tubular<br>
member also comprises tongue extensions 48 extending towards the distal end of<br>
the device.<br>
In the embodiment of the device shown at least one resilient means 30, e.g. two<br>
coil springs, is arranged. These springs can also be replaced by another kind of<br>
resilient means e.g. a spiral spring. The wound ends of the spring 30 are cradled<br>
within the outwardly annular ledge 38 extending radially from the distal end of the<br>
tubular member and the other end of the spring is secured to a fixed point on the<br>
inner surface of the housing.<br>
The proximal end of the plunger rod 24 is arranged to be in contact with the<br>
stopper 16 inside the container and the distal end the plunger rod comprises a<br>
carrier 22 which is formed as a saddle for cradling the wound end of the power<br>
source 20. The other end of the power source is secured to a holder 52 which is<br>
fixedly arranged to inner surface of the housing 10. The retaining means 26 is<br>
pivotally arranged to the holder 52 and comprises a protrusion arranged to be in<br>
contact with a groove of the plunger rod for holding the drive unit in the non-<br>
delivery state. The holder also comprises a through hole for allowing the plunger<br>
rod to pass through.<br>
According to the invention, the delivery indication mechanism 56 is arranged<br>
inside the housing. The band 58 being of a flexible yet generally non-resilient<br>
material is arranged with different indications or indicia 60, which will be described<br>
in more detail below. The first end of the band is attached to the carrier 22 of the<br>
plunger rod and the other end of the band is unattached. The band is arranged<br>
around the guide means 62, 67 which form a slit on the inner end surface of the<br>
housing wherein the band is stored and through which the band runs. As seen<br>
from Fig. 1b, the opening/window 64 is preferably placed in the transition between<br>
a side surface and a distal end surface of the housing, and the guide means 62,<br>
67 are preferably arranged at the distal end of the housing, Fig. 2.<br>
Before use, as seen in Fig. 2, the cap 12 is removed from the device. The delivery<br>
device is now ready to be used. Through the opening/window 64 is shown the start<br>
indication which informs the user that the device is ready for delivery. The tubular<br>
member 36 is pressed against a delivery site, e.g. a needle penetrates into the<br>
delivery site a predetermined depth, and whereby the wound end of the springs 30<br>
rotates in the outwardly annular ledge 38 as the springs unravels. This movement<br>
is sufficient to displace the tongue extensions 48 towards the distal end of the<br>
device for pushing and thereby pivoting the retaining means 26. The pivoting of<br>
the retaining means 26 causes its protrusions to come out of contact from the<br>
groove arranged on the plunger rod 24. The plunger rod is urged forwardly as the<br>
wound end of the power source 20 rotates within the saddle 22 of the plunger rod.<br>
The plunger rod now urges the stopper 16 inside the container 14 towards the<br>
proximal end of the device as fluid is expelled from the container through the<br>
delivery member.<br>
During the delivery sequence, according to the present invention, the plunger rod<br>
24 and the carrier 22 move downwards due to the force of the power source 20.<br>
Because of the attachment of the band 58 to the carrier 22, the band will be pulled<br>
through the guide means 62, 66 whereby the progress indication on the band will<br>
pass the opening/window 64. The moving pattern of the progress indications or<br>
indicia passing the window 64 is a positive and reliable indication that the delivery<br>
is in progress. As an example of indications, as shown in Fig. 1a, they could<br>
consist of lines of alternating dark and light colours, such as black and white, and<br>
positioned at an angle to the direction of movement. With this configuration the<br>
movement and thus delivery sequence is clearly visible through the<br>
opening/window 64. When the delivery sequence has come to an end, this could<br>
be indicated by the final indication. One example of the final indication is shown in<br>
Fig. 3b, where smiling faces are shown, which is a positive indication that the<br>
delivery is completed, and that the device may be withdrawn from the delivery site.<br>
In this respect, it is to be understood that many types of indicia, symbols,<br>
indications and the like may be used, as well as the use of different colours, in<br>
order to indicate to the user that the delivery is in progress or has ended. The<br>
window could also be arranged with a magnifying lens for further improving the<br>
visibility of the information.<br>
Upon completion of the medicament delivery, the device is withdrawn from the<br>
delivery site and set in a final state as seen in Fig. 4. The needle shield 36 movies<br>
towards the proximal end of the device under the force of the springs 30 for<br>
covering the delivery member and the activation means is locked.<br>
It is to be understood that the embodiment described above and shown in the<br>
drawings is to be regarded only as a non-limiting example of the present invention<br>
and that it may be amended in many ways within the scope of the patent claims.<br>
