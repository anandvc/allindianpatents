FIELD OF THE TECHNOLOGY<br>
The present invention relates in general to the field of television (TV) systems and in particular to display of advertisements in television receiver. More specifically the present invention relates to a method and system for displaying advertisement/Content in a TV set by its manufacturer or others apart from the broadcasters.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Television has been considered as the most effective media for advertisement of products and services. Even the advent of cyber technologies could not affect the popularity of the TV system. In a television system, the advertisements are aired along with the scheduled programs by broadcasters. Generally the particular channel / program broadcaster provides time slot during the programs so that the advertisers can utilize the time for their advertisements. Broadcasters are paid for allotting the time slots and the advertisers get the benefit as the advertisements are viewed by many in their TV sets. But it is an inconvenience that the program needs to be interrupted for the display of the advertisements. Another popular way of local advertising is through cable networks by cable TV operators. They can telecast the advertisements through their own program channel.<br>
The above-mentioned television systems do not provide any scope for the advertisement without the help of channel or program broadcasters. It is also apparent that the TV receiver set has nothing to do with the advertisement displayed thereon. In abstract the state of the art does not allow displaying advertisements/content by TV/Device manufacturers in their product.<br>
Based on the foregoing, there has been found a need for a system and method, capable of displaying advertisements / content in television sets / device by television/device manufacturers without disrupting the broadcasters programs. Advantageously, the present invention provides a method for displaying the channel/broadcasters programs and  advertisement by TV<br><br>
manufacturers simultaneously.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore the primary object of this invention to provide a television system wherein the display of advertisement by the TV manufacturer is also possible simultaneously with the broadcasters' programs without interfering with the programs.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a method for displaying the advertisement other than by the channel/program broadcaster in a television system during the specified time and at a specific place on the television screen without any compromise on the effect of the channel programs and advertisements that are intended to impart on the viewers.<br>
It is yet another object of the invention to provide a TV receiver set capable of receiving the advertisement from the server of the television manufacturer or from some other source through internet or a broadcast channel and storing the same on the memory storage device such as hard disk/Flash memory of television sets either in switch on mode or stand by mode so as to enable the display on the screen whenever there is a scope for the advertisement.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide a method for displaying the advertisement when there are no program signals or it is in stand by mode.<br>
It is also an object of the invention to provide a TV set having second tuner tuned to the advertisement broadcaster channel and separate video processing so that a storage medium may not be necessary for storing the data.<br>
Accordingly, a preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises a method for displaying advertisement in television by its manufacturer or others apart from the broadcasters, the method comprising the steps of:<br><br>
(a)	receiving the advertisement contents in the form of AV signals;<br>
(b)	storing the advertisement in a memory device;<br>
(c)	mixing the program data from the broadcaster and the advertisement data; and<br>
(d)	displaying the advertisement duhng specified time at predetermined locations on the screen simultaneously along with the broadcaster's programs without interfering it.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention further comprises a television receiver set for displaying advertisements by its manufacturer or others apart from the broadcasters simultaneously with the broadcasters' program, the said television set comprising:<br>
(a)	receiving means for receiving the advertisement contents;<br>
(b)	memory device for storing the advertisement in a memory device;<br>
(c)	processing circuits for processing the program data and advertisement data and sound reproducing means;<br>
(d)	video mixing means for mixing the program data from the broadcaster and the advertisement data; and<br>
(e)	display means for displaying the advertisement during specified time at predetermined locations on the screen simultaneously without interfering with the broadcasters' programs.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain<br><br>
instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Before describing the various aspects and details of the present invention it will be useful to describe the context in which the invention is used. Consequently the conventional way of advertisement in a television system is presented herein with reference to Figure 1. It is apparent from Figure 1 that in the present state of art, when advertisements are to be displayed during a particular program, the program is suspended for the advertisement to be broadcasted and the program resumes only thereafter.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the invention is incorporated in a digital television. Figure 2 shows the block diagram of a typical Digital TV that works on MPEG video. A person skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that the Tuner will be tuned to the required major channel and the channel IC will be tuned to the required minor channel. MPEG Transport Demultiplexer separates the required elementary streams from the Transport stream Outputted by the channel IC and MPEG decoder decodes these elementary streams, separates digital audio and digital video. Digital Audio is converted to analog using DAC, amplified and sent to the Speakers for sound reproduction. Digital Video is mixed with 'Graphics and menus' using a Graphic processor and sent to display device. In order to display a test pattern, the MPEG decoder switches to a memory area where test pattern is stored. This feature of the digital television is employed in the mechanism proposed by the present invention for displaying the advertisement on the television system by its manufacturers. Accordingly, for displaying the advertisement in television systems, MPEG decoder will switch to the memory where advertisement is stored.<br>
As is apparent from the foregoing discussion, the TV receives the advertisement content from the TV manufacturer or any third party other than the program broadcasters and stores in memory for facilitating the display of advertisements at the appropriate times and appropriate places on the screen. The television obtains the advertisement content through Internet,<br><br>
broadcast channel or Broadcast Channel with separate video processing. State of the art digital TVs have the entire network stack to communicate on the Internet. They are designed to browse the Internet, check mails, speak to friends (VoIP) etc. and are also made capable of performing online shopping functions. This network stack can be used to connect to the TV manufacturer's server to download new advertisements. Downloading new advertisements is a high level application i.e. application in application layer of the network stack. The memory storage devices such as built-in flash memory (in-built hard disk in the case of PVR enabled television sets) available in digital television sets can be used for storing advertisement content downloaded from the Internet or broadcast channel.<br>
Downloading and up gradation of advertisement in TV Sets<br>
1)	Internet: In this Internet method, the TV manufacturer runs a web/FTP server (Refer Figure 8) and the television sets are programmed to connect to the said server whenever the user goes online. On connecting to the said server, the television set will download the advertisement content from the manufacturer's server and will update its memory (hard disk or flash memory) with the new advertisements. During the said download, the configuration information is also downloaded, which will be used to update the firmware, changes in IP address of the server, possibilities of transmission in a broadcast channel etc. Simultaneously, the television set will upload the details of advertisement log, which is a table of "x" advertisement displayed for Y period of time.<br>
2)	Broadcast channel: In this method, the channel broadcaster broadcasts the advertisements and the television set is programmed to receive it. When the television user switches the television set to the standby mode, the display circuitry and CRT will be switched off and the tuner will automatically be tuned to the TV manufacturer's advertisement channel, receives the advertisement data from the manufacturer's channel and stores the said data in the MPEG memory as shown in Figure 3.<br><br>
3) Broadcast Channel with separate video processing: In this method, the television set has a separate tuner and video processing circuitry. The first tuner will be tuned to the program of user interest; whereas, the second tuner will be tuned to the advertisement channel of the TV manufacturer and the user does not have any control on the second tuner. In this case no storage medium is required and the video processing circuitry mixes both the videos before displaying it on "Extended CRT TVs as shown in Figures 5 and 6. (In the case of extra LCD TVs as shown in Figure 7 a similar mechanism without mixing will be used).<br>
Display of advertisement<br>
Once the advertisement is stored in the harddisc/memory of the television system, it is ready to be displayed in the displaying area in the TV screen as and when it gets the signal from operator or in other situation wherever it is tuned to display automatically. The advertisement will be displayed in the TV screen differently in different situations described below.<br>
1)	When displaying a scope movie<br>
When the program being displayed is a scope movie, the movie will not occupy the full screen and therefore the advertisement can be displayed in the remaining area. Figure 3 explains the mechanism whereas Video mixer mixes the program data and the advertisement data and displays on the display device.<br>
2)	In no signal condition<br>
When there is no signal for a program, instead of displaying a Blue/Black screen, advertisements will be displayed. To show the advertisement MPEG Decoder will be switched to the advertisement data in memory. The advertisement is not displayed in the full screen in order not to confuse the end user understanding that as a signal. To show the program when it becomes available, MPEG Decoder will be switched back to MPEG Transport Demultiplexer.<br><br>
It is also possible that when the user wants to put the TV in standby mode, TV will display advertisement for a minute or so and then go to 'standby' mode. Similarly when the user switches on the TV, the manufacturer can display an advertisement for a minute or so before displaying the Program.<br>
3)	When viewing a sub channel<br>
When the user is watching a sub channel in a HD TV, and if the user preference is "Pillar View", advertisement can be displayed in the remaining area as shown in Figure 4. Here the Video Mixer mixes the program video and the advertisement video before displaying it on the screen.<br>
4)	With Extended Width / Height CRT<br>
In this method, the program will be displayed in the same aspect ratio and the advertisement will be displayed in the remaining area. The advertisement place can be shifted from left and right every time TV comes from standby to active mode as shown in Figures 5 and 6.<br>
Figure 5 represents the block diagram of TV in extended CRT type having 2 tuners and 2 video processing modules. One tuner will be tuned to the user program and the second tuner is tuned to the advertisement channel. The Video mixer mixes both videos before displaying on the display unit.<br>
Similarly Figure 6 represents the block diagram of Extended CRT employing memory instead of second tuner. In this case one video-processing module will process the signal from CRT and the second video-processing module will process the video stored in memory before sending to Video mixer, which mix both videos for displaying on the screen.<br>
5)	Engaging an LCD display<br>
Addition of LCD display allows the manufacturer to display advertisement as long as the TV is switched on i.e. the TV will be able to show advertisement all the time. This advertisement data can be either from the stored data or from a separate video processing mechanism.<br><br>
Two different methods employed are shown in Figure 7. In the first method, advertisement data stored in memory will be displayed on the extra LCD. In the second method one tuner will be dedicated for the advertisements. This tuner will always be tuned to the TV Manufacturer's advertisement broadcast channel and the data from this tuner will be processed by video processing circuitry before displaying it on the screen.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
