				<td>OF TREATING AN INFLAMMATORY DISEASE BY DOUBLE STRANDED RIBONUCLEIC<br>
The invention relates to methods and compositions for delivering nucleic acids into cells. More specifically,<br>
the invention relates to procedures and preparations for delivering double-stranded polynucleotides into cells to modify<br>
expression of target genes to alter a phenotype, such as a disease state or potential, of the cells.<br>
A central role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-a) has been identified or implicated in the initiation and/or<br>
persistence of the inflammatory process(es) leading to a variety of diseases. These include rheumatoid arthritis (RA),<br>
Crohn's disease (CD), psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, Still's disease, polymyositis and dematomyositis, and<br>
vasculitis (including Behcet's disease and Wegener's granulomatosis) (Lorenz and Kalden (2002) Arthritis Research<br>
4(suppl 3):S17-24). TNF-a production by adipose tissue has also been implicated in diabetes and obesity (Ruan and<br>
Lodish (2003) Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 14:447-55).<br>
Limitations of established therapies (including methotrexate) have led to identification of certain inflammatory<br>
mediators as therapeutic targets for alternative therapies. In this connection novel therapeutic agents have been<br>
developed that are currently being testing, including monoclonal antibodies, cytokine receptor-human Ig constructs,<br>
and recombinant human proteins. There continues to be an unmet demand for effective therapeutic modalities for<br>
treating this class of diseases.<br>
Various stimuli are known to induce TNF-a production, including endotoxin, tumor cells, several viruses<br>
(including HIV), other cytokines, and various stress related responses. An animal model has been developed for<br>
nonclinical studies that were accepted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as providing support for<br>
labeling of Remicade® for treatment of Crohn's Disease patients. The murine model (Tg 197, Tg211 and Tg5453<br>
mice) came from the development of transgenic mice that constitutively express human TNF-a (Georgopoulos et al.<br>
(1996) J. Inflammation<br>
46:86-97). Several other anti-TNF-a antibody therapies successfully applied this animal model to assess<br>
potency and prove efficacy (HUMIRA™, Infliximab, Adalimunab, Etanercept, Abgenix ABX10131).<br>
Delivering nucleic acids into animal and plant cells has long been an important object of molecular biology<br>
research and development. Recent developments in the areas of gene therapy, antisense therapy and RNA interference<br>
(RNAi) therapy have created a need to develop more efficient means for introducing nucleic acids into cells,<br>
A diverse array of plasmids and other nucleic acid "vectors" have been developed for delivering large<br>
polynucleotide molecules into cells. Typically these vectors incorporate large DNA molecules comprising intact genes<br>
for the purpose of transforming target cells to express a gene of scientific or therapeutic interest.<br>
The process by which exogenous nucleic acids are delivered artificially into cells is generally referred to as<br>
transfection. Cells can be transfected to uptake a functional nucleic acid from an exogenous source using a variety of<br>
techniques and materials. The most commonly used transfection methods are calcium phosphate transfection, and<br>
electroporation. A variety of other methods for tranducing cells to deliver exogenous DNA or RNA molecules have<br>
been developed, including viral-mediated transduction, cationic lipid or liposomal delivery, and numerous methods<br>
that target mechanical or biochemical membrane disruption/penetration (e.g., using detergents, microinjection, or<br>
particle guns).<br>
RNA interference is a process of sequence-specific post transcriptional gene silencing in cells initiated by a<br>
double-stranded (ds) polynucleotide, usually a dsRNA, that is homologous in sequence to a portion of a targeted<br>
messenger RNA (mRNA). Introduction of a suitable dsRNA into cells leads to destruction of endogenous, cognate<br>
mRNAs (i.e., mRNAs that share substantial sequence identity with the introduced dsRNA). The dsRNA molecules are<br>
cleaved by an RNase III family nuclease called dicer into short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are 19-23<br>
nucleotides (nt) in length. The siRNAs are then incorporated into a multicomponent nuclease complex known as the<br>
RNA-induced silencing complex or "RISC". The RISC identifies mRNA substrates through their homology to the<br>
siRNA, and effectuates silencing of gene expression by binding to and destroying the targeted mRNA.<br>
RNA interference is emerging a promising technology for modifying expression of specific genes in plant and<br>
animal cells, and is therefore expected to provide useful tools to treat a wide range of diseases and disorders amenable<br>
to treatment by modification of endogenous gene expression.<br>
There remains a long-standing need in the art for better tools and methods to deliver siRNAs and other small<br>
miiibitory nucleic acids (siNAs) into cells, particularly in view of the fact that existing techniques for delivering<br>
nucleic acids to cells are limited by poor efficiency and/or high toxicity of the delivery reagents. Related needs exist<br>
for improved methods and formulations to deliver siNAs in an effective amount, in an active and enduring state, and<br>
using non-toxic delivery vehicles, to selected cells, tissues, or compartments to mediate regulation of gene expression<br>
in a manner that will alter a phenotype or disease state of the targeted cells.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention satisfies these needs and fulfills additional objects and advantages by providing novel<br>
compositions and methods that employ a short interfering nucleic acid (siNA), or a precursor thereof, in combination<br>
with a polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptide. The polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptide is a natural<br>
or artificial polypeptide selected for its ability to enhance intracellular delivery or uptake of polynucleotides, including<br>
siNAs and their precursors.<br>
Within the novel compositions of the invention, the siNA may be admixed or complexed with, or conjugated<br>
to, the polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptide to form a composition that enhances intracellular delivery of the<br>
siNA as compared to delivery resulting from contacting the target cells with a naked siNA (i.e., siNA without the<br>
delivery-enhancing polypeptide present).<br>
Enhancer Peptides<br>
As used herein "cell" is used in its usual biological sense, and does not refer to an entire multicellular<br>
organism, e.g., specifically does not refer to a human. The cell can be present in an organism, e.g., birds, plants and<br>
mammals such as humans, cows, sheep, apes, monkeys, swine, dogs, and cats. The cell can be prokaryotic (e.g.,<br>
bacterial cell) or eukaryotic (e.g., mammalian or plant cell). The cell can be of somatic or germ line origin, totipotent<br>
or pluripotent, dividing or non-dividing. The cell can also be derived from or can comprise a gamete or embryo, a stem<br>
cell, or a fully differentiated cell.<br>
By "vectors" is meant any nucleic acid- and/or viral-based technique used to deliver a desired nucleic acid.<br>
By "comprising" is meant including, but not limited to, whatever follows the word "comprising." Thus, use of<br>
the term "comprising" indicates that the listed elements are required or mandatory, but that other elements are optional<br>
and may or may not be present. By "consisting of is meant including, and limited to, whatever follows the phrase<br>
"consisting of." Thus, the phrase "consisting of indicates that the listed elements are required or mandatory, and that<br>
no other elements may be present. By "consisting essentially of is meant including any elements listed after the<br>
phrase, and limited to other elements that do not interfere with or contribute to the activity or action specified in the<br>
disclosure for the listed elements. Thus, the phrase "consisting essentially of indicates that the listed elements are<br>
required or mandatory, but that other elements are optional and may or may not be present depending upon whether or<br>
not they affect the activity or action of the listed elements.<br>
The term "biodegradable" as used herein, refers to degradation in a biological system, for example enzymatic<br>
degradation or chemical degradation.<br>
The term "biologically active molecule" as used herein, refers to compounds or molecules that are capable of<br>
fciting or modifying a biological response in a system. Non-limiting examples of biologically active siNA molecules<br>
either alone or in combination with other molecules contemplated by the instant invention include therapeutically<br>
active molecules such as antibodies, cholesterol, hormones, antivirals, peptides, proteins, chemotherapeutics, small<br>
molecules, vitamins, co-factors, nucleosides, nucleotides, oligonucleotides, enzymatic nucleic acids, antisense nucleic<br>
acids, triplex forming oligonucleotides, 2,5-A chimeras, siNA, dsRNA, allozymes, aptamers, decoys and analogs<br>
thereof. Biologically active molecules of the invention also include molecules capable of modulating the<br>
pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics of other biologically active molecules, for example, lipids and polymers<br>
such as polyamines, polyamides, polyethylene glycol and other polyethers.<br>
The term "phospholipid" as used herein, refers to a hydrophobic molecule comprising at least one phosphorus<br>
group. For example, a phospholipid can comprise a phosphorus-containing group and saturated or unsaturated alkyl<br>
group, optionally substituted with OH, COOH, oxo, amine, or substituted or unsubstituted aryl groups.<br>
The term "ligand" refers to any compound or molecule, such as a drug, peptide, hormone, or neurotransmitter,<br>
that is capable of interacting with another compound, such as a receptor, either directly or indirectly. The receptor that<br>
interacts with a ligand can be present on the surface of a cell or can alternately be an intracellular receptor. Interaction<br>
of the ligand with the receptor can result in a biochemical reaction, or can simply be a physical interaction or<br>
association.<br>
By the term "non-nucleotide" is meant any group or compound which can be incorporated into a nucleic acid<br>
chain in the place of one or more nucleotide units, including either sugar and/or phosphate substitutions, and allows the<br>
remaining bases to exhibit their enzymatic activity. The group or compound is abasic in that it does not contain a<br>
commonly recognized nucleotide base, such as adenosine, guanine, cytosine, uracil or thymine and therefore lacks a<br>
base at the 1 '-position.<br>
By "nucleotide" as used herein is as recognized in the art to include natural bases (standard), and modified<br>
bases well known in the art. Such bases are generally located at the 1' position of a nucleotide sugar moiety.<br>
Nucleotides generally comprise a base, sugar and a phosphate group. The nucleotides can be unmodified or modified<br>
at the sugar, phosphate and/or base moiety, (also referred to interchangeably as nucleotide analogs, modified<br>
nucleotides, non-natural nucleotides, non-standard nucleotides and other; see, for example, Usman and McSwiggen,<br>
supra; Eckstein et al., International PCT Publication No. WO 92/07065; Usman et al, International PCT Publication<br>
No. WO 93/15187; Uhlman &amp; Peyman, supra, all are hereby incorporated by reference herein). There are several<br>
examples of modified nucleic acid bases known in the art as summarized by Limbach et al, 1994, Nucleic Acids Res.<br>
22, 2183. Some of the non-limiting examples of base modifications that can be introduced into nucleic acid molecules<br>
include, inosine, purine, pyridin-4-one, pyridin-2-one, phenyl, pseudouracil, 2, 4, 6-trimethoxy benzene, 3-methyl<br>
uracil, dihydrouridine, naphthyl, aminophenyl, 5-alkylcytidines (e.g., 5-methylcytidine), 5-alkyluridines (e.g.,<br>
ribothymidine), 5-halouridine (e.g., 5-bromouridine) or 6-azapyrimidines or 6-alkylpyrimidines (e.g. 6-methyluridine),<br>
propyne, and others (Burgin et al., 1996, Biochemistry, 35, 14090; Uhlman &amp; Peyman, supra). By "modified bases" in<br>
this aspect is meant nucleotide bases other than adenine, guanine, cytosine and uracil at 1' position or their equivalents.<br>
By "target site" is meant a sequence within a target RNA that is "targeted" for cleavage mediated by a siNA<br>
construct which contains sequences within its antisense region that are complementary to the target sequence.<br>
By "detectable level of cleavage" is meant cleavage of target RNA (and formation of cleaved product RNAs)<br>
to an extent sufficient to discern cleavage products above the background of RNAs produced by random degradation<br>
of the target RNA. Production of cleavage products from 1-5% of the target RNA is sufficient to detect above the<br>
background for most methods of detection.<br>
By "biological system" is meant, material, in a purified or unpurified form, from biological sources, including<br>
but not limited to human, animal, plant, insect, bacterial, viral or other sources, wherein the system comprises the<br>
components required for RNAi activity. The term "biological system" includes, for example, a cell, tissue, or<br>
organism, or extract thereof. The term biological system also includes reconstituted RNAi systems that can be used in<br>
an in vitro setting.<br>
The term "biodegradable linker" as used herein, refers to a nucleic acid or non-nucleic acid linker molecule<br>
that is designed as a biodegradable linker to connect one molecule to another molecule, for example, a biologically<br>
active molecule to a siNA molecule of the invention or the sense and antisense strands of a siNA molecule of the<br>
invention. The biodegradable linker is designed such that its stability can be modulated for a particular purpose, such<br>
delivery to a particular tissue or cell type. The stability of a nucleic acid-based biodegradable linker molecule can<br>
lie modulated by using various chemistries, for example combinations of ribonucleotides, deoxyribonucleotides, and<br>
chemically-modified nucleotides, such as 2'-O-methyl, 2'-fluoro, 2'-amino, 2'-O-amino, 2'-C-allyl, 2'-O-allyl, and other<br>
2'-modified or base modified nucleotides. The biodegradable nucleic acid linker molecule can be a dimer, trimer,<br>
tetramer or longer nucleic acid molecule, for example, an oligonucleotide of about 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,<br>
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 nucleotides in length, or can comprise a single nucleotide with a phosphorus-based<br>
linkage, for example, a phosphoramidate or phosphodiester linkage. The biodegradable nucleic acid linker molecule<br>
can also comprise nucleic acid backbone, nucleic acid sugar, or nucleic acid base modifications.<br>
In certain embodiments of the invention, the polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptide is a histone<br>
protein, or a polypeptide or peptide fragment, derivative, analog, or conjugate thereof. Within these embodiments, the<br>
siNA is admixed, complexed or conjugated with one or more full length histone proteins or polypeptides<br>
corresponding at least in part to a partial sequence of a histone protein, for example of one or more of the following<br>
histones: histone HI, histone H2A, histone H2B, histone H3 or histone H4, or one or more polypeptide fragments or<br>
derivatives thereof comprising at least a partial sequence of a histone protein, typically at least 5-10 or 10-20<br>
contiguous residues of a native histone protein. In more detailed embodiments, the siRNA/histone mixture, complex<br>
or conjugate is substantially free of amphipathic compounds. In other detailed embodiments, the siNA that is admixed,<br>
complexed, or conjugated with the histone protein or polypeptide will comprise a double-stranded double-stranded<br>
RNA, for example a double-stranded RNA that has 30 or fewer nucleotides, and is a short interfering RNA (siRNA).<br>
In exemplary embodiments, the histone polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptide comprises a fragment of<br>
histone H2B, as exemplified by the polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptide designated PN73 described herein<br>
below. In yet additional detailed embodiments, the polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptide may be pegylated<br>
to improve stability and/or efficacy, particularly in the context of in vivo administration.<br>
Within additional embodiments of the invention, the polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptide is selected<br>
or rationally designed to comprise an amphipathic amino acid sequence. For example, useful polynucleotide deliveryenhancing<br>
polypeptides may be selected which comprise a plurality of non-polar or hydrophobic amino acid residues<br>
that form a hydrophobic sequence domain or motif, linked to a plurality of charged amino acid residues that form a<br>
charged sequence domain or motif, yielding an amphipathic peptide.<br>
In other embodiments, the polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptide is selected to comprise a protein<br>
transduction domain or motif, and a fusogenic peptide domain or motif. A protein transduction domain is a peptide<br>
sequence that is able to insert into and preferably transit through the membrane of cells. A fusogenic peptide is a<br>
peptide that destabilizes a lipid membrane, for example a plasma membrane or membrane surrounding an endosome,<br>
which may be enhanced at low pH. Exemplary fusogenic domains or motifs are found in a broad diversity of viral<br>
fusion proteins and in other proteins, for example fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4).<br>
To rationally design polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptides of the invention, a protein transduction<br>
domain is employed as a motif that will facilitate entry of the nucleic acid into a cell through the plasma membrane. In<br>
certain embodiments, the transported nucleic acid will be encapsulated in an endosome. The interior of endosomes has<br>
a low pH resulting in the fusogenic peptide motif destabilizing the membrane of the endosome. The destabilization<br>
and breakdown of the endosome membrane allows for the release of the siNA into the cytoplasm where the siNA can<br>
associate with a RISC complex and be directed to its target mRNA.<br>
Exemplary polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptides within the invention may be selected from the<br>
following peptides:<br>
WWETWKPFQCRICMRNFSTRQARRNHRRRHR (SEQ ID NO: 27); GKINLKALAALAKKIL (SEQ ID<br>
NO: 28), RVIRVWFQNKRCKDKK (SEQ ID NO: 29),<br>
GRKKRRQRRRPPQGRKKRRQRRRPPQGRKKRRQRRRPPQ (SEQ ID NO: 30), GEQIAQLIAGYIDIILKKKKSK<br>
(SEQ ID NO: 31), Poly Lys-Trp, 4:1, MW 20,000-50,000; and Poly Orn-Trp, 4:1, MW 20,000-50,000. Additional<br>
polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptides that are useful within the compositions and methods herein comprise<br>
all or part of the mellitin protein sequence.<br>
Still other exemplary polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptides are identified in the examples below.<br>
Any one or combination of these peptides may be selected or combined to yield effective polynucleotide deliveryenhancing<br>
polypeptide reagents to induce or facilitate intracellular delivery of siNAs within the methods and<br>
compositions of the invention.<br>
In more detailed aspects of the invention, the mixture, complex or conjugate comprising a siRNA and a<br>
'lynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptide can be optionally combined with (e.g., admixed or complexed with) a<br>
cationic lipid, such as LIPOFECTIN* In this context it is unexpectedly disclosed herein that polynucleotide deliveryenhancing<br>
polypeptides complexed or conjugated to a siRNA alone will effectuate delivery of the siNA sufficient to<br>
mediate gene silencing by RNAi. However, it is further unexpectedly disclosed herein that a siRNA/polynucleotide<br>
delivery-enhancing polypeptide complex or conjugate will exhibit even greater activity for mediating siNA delivery<br>
and gene silencing when admixed or complexed with a cationic lipid, such as lipofectin. To produce these<br>
compositions comprised of a polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptide, siRNA and a cationic lipid, the siRNA<br>
and peptide may be mixed together first in a suitable medium such as a cell culture medium, after which the cationic<br>
lipid is added to the mixture to form a siRNA/delivery peptide/cationic lipid composition. Optionally, the peptide and<br>
cationic lipid can be mixed together first in a suitable medium such as a cell culture medium, where after the siRNA<br>
can be added to form the siRNA/delivery peptide/cationic lipid composition.<br>
Examples of useful cationic lipids within these aspects of the invention include N-[l-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-<br>
N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride, 1,2-bis(oleoyloxy)-3-3-(trimethylammonium)propane, 1,2-dimyristyloxypropyl-<br>

tetramethyldioleyl spermine. DOTMA (N-[l-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethyl ammonium chloride), DOTAP<br>
(l,2-bis(oleoyloxy)-3,3-(trimethylammonium)propane), DMRIE (l,2-dimyristyloxypropyl-3-dimethyl-hydroxy ethyl<br>
ammonium bromide) or DDAB (dimethyl dioctadecyl ammonium bromide). Polyvalent cationic lipids include<br>
lipospermines, specifically DOSPA (2,3-dioleyloxy-N-[2(sperminecarboxamido)ethyl]-N,N-dimethyl-l -propanamini<br>
um trifluoro-acetate) and DOSPER (l,3-dioleoyloxy-2-(6carboxy spermyl)-propyl-amid, and the di- and tetra-alkyltetra-<br>
methyl spermines, including but not limited to TMTPS (tetramethyltetrapalmitoyl spermine), TMTOS<br>
(tetramethyltetraoleyl spermine), TMTLS (tetramethlytetralauryl spermine), TMTMS (tetramethyltetramyristyl<br>
spermine) and TMDOS (tetramethyldioleyl spermine) DOGS (dioctadecyl-amidoglycylspermine (TRANSFECTAM1.<br>
Other useful cationic lipids are described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 6,733,777; U.S. Patent No. 6,376,248; U.S.<br>

Cationic lipids are optionally combined with non-cationic lipids, particularly neutral lipids, for example lipids<br>
such as DOPE (dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine), DPhPE (diphytanoylphosphatidylethanolamine) or cholesterol. A<br>
cationic lipid composition composed of a 3:1 (w/w) mixture of DOSPA and DOPE or a 1:1 (w/w) mixture of DOTMA<br>
and DOPE (LIPOFECTIN*, Invitrogen) are generally useful in transfecting compositions of this invention. Preferred<br>
transfection compositions are those which induce substantial transfection of a higher eukaryotic cell line.<br>
Double stranded siRNA molecules<br>
By "asymmetric hairpin" as used herein is meant a linear siNA molecule comprising an antisense<br>
region, a loop portion that can comprise nucleotides or non-nucleotides, and a sense region that comprises fewer<br>
nucleotides than the antisense region to the extent that the sense region has enough complementary nucleotides to base<br>
pair with the antisense region and form a duplex with loop. For example, an asymmetric hairpin siNA molecule of the<br>
invention can comprise an antisense region having length sufficient to mediate RNAi in a T-cell (e.g. about 19 to about<br>
22 (e.g., about 19, 20, 21, or 22) nucleotides) and a loop region comprising about 4 to about 8 (e.g., about 4, 5, 6, 7, or<br>
8) nucleotides, and a sense region having about 3 to about 18 (e.g., about 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,<br>
17, or 18) nucleotides that are complementary to the antisense region. The asymmetric hairpin siNA molecule can also<br>
comprise a 5'-terminal phosphate group that can be chemically modified. The loop portion of the asymmetric hairpin<br>
siNA molecule can comprise nucleotides, non-nucleotides, linker molecules, or conjugate molecules as described<br>
herein.<br>
By "asymmetric duplex" as used herein is meant a siNA molecule having two separate strands comprising a<br>
sense region and an antisense region, wherein the sense region comprises fewer nucleotides than the antisense region<br>
to the extent that the sense region has enough complementary nucleotides to base pair with the antisense region and<br>
form a duplex. For example, an asymmetric duplex siNA molecule of the invention can comprise an antisense region<br>
having length sufficient to mediate RNAi in a T-cell (e.g. about 19 to about 22 (e.g. about 19, 20, 21, or 22)<br>
nucleotides) and a sense region having about 3 to about 18 (e.g., about 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,<br>
or 18) nucleotides that are complementary to the antisense region.<br>
By "modulate gene expression" is meant that the expression of a target gene is upregulated or downregulated,<br>
which can include upregulation or downregulation of mRNA levels present in a cell, or of mRNA translation, or of<br>
synthesis of protein or protein subunits, encoded by the target gene. Modulation of gene expression can be determined<br>
also be the presence, quantity, or activity of one or more proteins or protein subunits encoded by the target gene that is<br>
up regulated or down regulated, such that expression, level, or activity of the subject protein or subunit is greater than<br>
or less than that which is observed in the absence of the modulator (e.g., a siRNA). For example, the term "modulate"<br>
can mean "inhibit," but the use of the word "modulate" is not limited to this definition.<br>
By "inhibit", "down-regulate", or "reduce" expression, it is meant that the expression of the gene, or level of<br>
RNA molecules or equivalent RNA molecules encoding one or more proteins or protein subunits, or level or activity of<br>
one or more proteins or protein subunits encoded by a target gene, is reduced below that observed in the absence of the<br>
nucleic acid molecules (e.g., siNA) of the invention. In one embodiment, inhibition, down-regulation or reduction<br>
with an siNA molecule is below that level observed in the presence of an inactive or attenuated molecule. In another<br>
embodiment, inhibition, down-regulation, or reduction with siNA molecules is below that level observed in the<br>
presence of, for example, an siNA molecule with scrambled sequence or with mismatches. In another embodiment,<br>
inhibition, down-regulation, or reduction of gene expression with a nucleic acid molecule of the instant invention is<br>
greater in the presence of the nucleic acid molecule than in its absence.<br>
Gene "silencing" refers to partial or complete loss-of-function through targeted inhibition of gene expression<br>
in a cell and may also be referred to as "knock down". Depending on the circumstances and the biological problem to<br>
be addressed, it may be preferable to partially reduce gene expression. Alternatively, it might be desirable to reduce<br>
gene expression as much as possible. The extent of silencing may be determined by methods known in the art, some<br>
of which are summarized in International Publication No. WO 99/32619. Depending on the assay, quantification of<br>
gene expression permits detection of various amounts of inhibition that may be desired in certain embodiments of the<br>
invention, including prophylactic and therapeutic methods, which will be capable of knocking down target gene<br>
expression, in terms of mRNA levels or protein levels or activity, for example, by equal to or greater than 10%, 30%,<br>
50%, 75% 90%, 95% or 99% of baseline (i.e., normal) or other control levels, including elevated expression levels as<br>
may be associated with particular disease states or other conditions targeted for therapy.<br>
The phrase "inhibiting expression of a target gene" refers to the ability of a siNA of the invention to initiate<br>
gene silencing of the target gene. To examine the extent of gene silencing, samples or assays of the organism of<br>
interest or cells in culture expressing a particular construct are compared to control samples lacking expression of the<br>
construct. Control samples (lacking construct expression) are assigned a relative value of 100%. Inhibition of<br>
expression of a target gene is achieved when the test value relative to the control is about 90%, often 50%, and in<br>
certain embodiments 25-0%. Suitable assays include, e.g., examination of protein or mRNA levels using techniques<br>
known to those of skill in the art such as dot blots, northern blots, in situ hybridization, ELISA, immunoprecipitation,<br>
enzyme function, as well as phenotypic assays known to those of skill in die art.<br>
By "subject" is meant an organism, tissue, or cell, which may include an organism as the subject or as a donor<br>
or recipient of explanted cells or the cells that are themselves subjects for siNA delivery. "Subject" therefore may<br>
refers to an organism, organ, tissue, or cell, including in vitro or ex vivo organ, tissue or cellular subjects, to which the<br>
nucleic acid molecules of the invention can be administered and enhanced by polynucleotide delivery-enhancing<br>
polypeptides described herein. Exemplary subjects include mammalian individuals or cells, for example human<br>
patients or cells.<br>
By "RNA" is meant a molecule comprising at least one ribonucleotide residue.<br>
By "ribonucleotide" is meant a nucleotide with a hydroxyl group at the 2' position of a .beta.-D-ribo-furanose<br>
moiety. The terms include double-stranded RNA, single-stranded RNA, isolated RNA such as partially purified RNA,<br>
essentially pure RNA, synthetic RNA, recombinantly produced RNA, as well as altered RNA that differs from<br>
naturally occurring RNA by the addition, deletion, substitution and/or alteration of one or more nucleotides. Such<br>
alterations can include addition of non-nucleotide material, such as to the end(s) of the siNA or internally, for example<br>
at one or more nucleotides of the RNA. Nucleotides in the RNA molecules of the instant invention can also comprise<br>
non-standard nucleotides, such as non-naturally occurring nucleotides or chemically synthesized nucleotides or<br>
deoxynucleotides. These altered RNAs can be referred to as analogs or analogs of naturally-occurring RNA.<br>
By "highly conserved sequence region" is meant, a nucleotide sequence of one or more regions in a target gene<br>
does not vary significantly from one generation to the other or from one biological system to the other.<br>
By "sense region" is meant a nucleotide sequence of a siNA molecule having complementarity to an antisense<br>
region of the siNA molecule. In addition, the sense region of a siNA molecule can comprise a nucleic acid sequence<br>
having homology with a target nucleic acid sequence.<br>
By "antisense region" is meant a nucleotide sequence of a siNA molecule having complementarity to a target<br>
aeicleic acid sequence. In addition, the antisense region of a siNA molecule can optionally comprise a nucleic acid<br>
sequence having complementarity to a sense region of the siNA molecule.<br>
By "target nucleic acid" is meant any nucleic acid sequence whose expression or activity is to be modulated.<br>
The target nucleic acid can be DNA or RNA.<br>
By "complementarity" is meant that a nucleic acid can form hydrogen bond(s) with another nucleic acid<br>
sequence by either traditional Watson-Crick or other non-traditional types. In reference to the nucleic molecules of the<br>
present invention, the binding free energy for a nucleic acid molecule with its complementary sequence is sufficient to<br>
allow the relevant function of the nucleic acid to proceed, e.g., RNAi activity. Determination of binding free energies<br>
for nucleic acid molecules is well known in the art (see, e.g., Turner et al., 1987, CSH Symp. Quant. Biol. LII pp. 123-<br>
133; Frier et al., 1986, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 83:9373-9377; Turner et al., 1987, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 109:3783-<br>
3785). A percent complementarity indicates the percentage of contiguous residues in a nucleic acid molecule that can<br>
form hydrogen bonds (e.g., Watson-Crick base pairing) with a second nucleic acid sequence (e.g., 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10<br>
nucleotides out of a total of 10 nucleotides in the first oligonucleotide being based paired to a second nucleic acid<br>
sequence having 10 nucleotides represents 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100% complementary respectively).<br>
"Perfectly complementary" means that all the contiguous residues of a nucleic acid sequence will hydrogen bond with<br>
the same number of contiguous residues in a second nucleic acid sequence.<br>
The term "universal base" as used herein refers to nucleotide base analogs that form base pairs with each of the<br>
natural DNA/RNA bases with little discrimination between them. Non-limiting examples of universal bases include Cphenyl,<br>
C-naphthyl and other aromatic derivatives, inosine, azole carboxamides, and nitroazole derivatives such as 3-<br>
nitropyrrole, 4-nitroindole, 5-nitroindole, and 6-nitroindole as known in the art (see for example Loakes, 2001, Nucleic<br>
Acids Research, 29, 2437-2447).<br>
The term "acyclic nucleotide" as used herein refers to any nucleotide having an acyclic ribose sugar, for<br>
example where any of the ribose carbons (Cl, C2, C3, C4, or C5), are independently or in combination absent from the<br>
nucleotide.<br>
By "abasic" is meant sugar moieties lacking a base or having other chemical groups in place of a base at the 1'<br>
position, see for example Adamic et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,998,203.<br>
By "unmodified nucleoside" is meant one of the bases adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, or uracil joined to<br>
the 1'carbon of beta.-D-ribo-furanose.<br>

structure of an unmodified nucleotide base, sugar and/or phosphate. Non-limiting examples of modified nucleotides<br>
are shown by Formulae I-VII and/or other modifications described herein.<br>
By "cap structure" is meant chemical modifications, which have been incorporated at either terminus of the<br>
oligonucleotide (see, for example, Adamic et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,998,203, incorporated by reference herein). These<br>
terminal modifications protect the nucleic acid molecule from exonuclease degradation, and may help in delivery<br>
and/or localization within a cell. The cap may be present at the 5'-terminus (5'-cap) or at the 3'-terminal (3'-cap) or may<br>
be present on both termini. In non-limiting examples, the 5'-cap includes, but is not limited to, glyceryl, inverted deoxy<br>

In connection with 2'-modified nucleotides as described for the present invention, by "amino" is meant 2'-NH2<br>
or 2'-O--NH2, which can be modified or unmodified. Such modified groups are described, for example, in Eckstein et<br>
al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,672,695 and Matulic-Adamic et al., U.S. Patent. No. 6,248,878.<br>
The siNA molecules can be complexed with cationic lipids, packaged within liposomes, or otherwise delivered<br>
to target cells or tissues. The nucleic acid or nucleic acid complexes can be locally administered to through injection,<br>
infusion pump or stent, with or without their incorporation in biopolymers. In another embodiment, polyethylene<br>
glycol (PEG) can be covalently attached to siNA compounds of the present invention, to the polynucleotide deliveryenhancing<br>
polypeptide, or both. The attached PEG can be any molecular weight, preferably from about 2,000 to about<br>
50,000 daltons (Da).<br>

linker or a non-nucleotide linker.<br>
"Inverted repeat" refers to a nucleic acid sequence comprising a sense and an antisense element positioned so<br>
that they are able to form a double stranded siRNA when the repeat is transcribed. The inverted repeat may optionally<br>
include a linker or a heterologous sequence such as a self-cleaving ribozyme between the two elements of the repeat.<br>
The elements of the inverted repeat have a length sufficient to form a double stranded RNA. Typically, each element<br>

"Nucleic acid" refers to deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides and polymers thereof in single- or doublestranded<br>
form. The term encompasses nucleic acids containing known nucleotide analogs or modified backbone<br>
residues or linkages, which are synthetic, naturally occurring, and non-naturally occurring, which have similar binding<br>
properties as the reference nucleic acid, and which are metabolized in a manner similar to the reference nucleotides.<br>
Examples of such analogs include, without limitation, phosphorothioates, phosphoramidates, methyl phosphonates,<br>
chiral-methyl phosphonates, 2-O-methyl ribonucleotides, peptide-nucleic acids (PNAs).<br>
"Large double-stranded RNA" refers to any double-stranded RNA having a size greater than about 40 base<br>
pairs (bp) for example, larger than 100 bp or more particularly larger than 300 bp. The sequence of a large dsRNA may<br>
represent a segment of a mRNA or the entire mRNA. The maximum size of the large dsRNA is not limited herein. The<br>
double-stranded RNA may include modified bases where the modification may be to the phosphate sugar backbone or<br>
to the nucleoside. Such modifications may include a nitrogen or sulfur heteroatom or any other modification known in<br>
the art.<br>
The double-stranded structure may be formed by self-complementary RNA strand such as occurs for a hairpin<br>
or a micro RNA or by annealing of two distinct complementary RNA strands.<br>
"Overlapping" refers to when two RNA fragments have sequences which overlap by a plurality of nucleotides<br>
on one strand, for example, where the plurality of nucleotides (nt) numbers as few as 2-5 nucleotides or by 5-10<br>
nucleotides or more.<br>
"One or more dsRNAs" refers to dsRNAs that differ from each other on the basis of sequence.<br>
"Target gene or mRNA" refers to any gene or mRNA of interest. Indeed any of the genes previously identified<br>
by genetics or by sequencing may represent a target. Target genes or mRNA may include developmental genes and<br>
regulatory genes as well as metabolic or structural genes or genes encoding enzymes. The target gene may be<br>
expressed in those cells in which a phenotype is being investigated or in an organism in a manner that directly or<br>
indirectly impacts a phenotypic characteristic. The target gene may be endogenous or exogenous. Such cells include<br>
any cell in the body of an adult or embryonic animal or plant including gamete or any isolated cell such as occurs in an<br>
immortal cell line or primary cell culture.<br>
hi exemplary embodiments, the instant invention features compositions comprising a small nucleic acid<br>
molecule, such as short interfering nucleic acid (siNA), a short interfering RNA (siRNA), a double-stranded RNA<br>
micro-RNA (mRNA), or a short hairpin RNA (shRNA), admixed or complexed with, or conjugated to, a<br>
j%rynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptide.<br>
As used herein, the term "short interfering nucleic acid", "siNA", "short interfering RNA", "siRNA", "short<br>
interfering nucleic acid molecule", "short interfering oligonucleotide molecule", or "chemically-modified short<br>
interfering nucleic acid molecule", refers to any nucleic acid molecule capable of inhibiting or down regulating gene<br>
expression or viral replication, for example by mediating RNA interference "RNAi" or gene silencing in a sequencespecific<br>
manner. Within exemplary embodiments, the siNA is a double-stranded polynucleotide molecule comprising<br>
self-complementary sense and antisense regions, wherein the antisense region comprises a nucleotide sequence that is<br>
complementary to a nucleotide sequence in a target nucleic acid molecule for down regulating expression, or a portion<br>
thereof, and the sense region comprises a nucleotide sequence corresponding to (i.e., which is substantially identical in<br>
sequence to) the target nucleic acid sequence or portion thereof.<br>
"siNA" means a small interfering nucleic acid, for example a siRNA, that is a short-length double-stranded<br>
nucleic acid (or optionally a longer precursor thereof), and which is not unacceptably toxic in target cells. The length<br>
of useful siNAs within the invention will in certain embodiments be optimized at a length of approximately 21 to 23 bp<br>
long. However, there is no particular limitation in the length of useful siNAs, including siRNAs. For example, siNAs<br>
can initially be presented to cells in a precursor form that is substantially different than a final or processed form of the<br>
siNA that will exist and exert gene silencing activity upon delivery, or after delivery, to the target cell. Precursor<br>
forms of siNAs may, for example, include precursor sequence elements that are processed, degraded, altered, or<br>
cleaved at or following the time of delivery to yield a siNA that is active within the cell to mediate gene silencing.<br>
Thus, in certain embodiments, useful siNAs within the invention will have a precursor length, for example, of<br>
approximately 100-200 base pairs, 50-100 base pairs, or less than about 50 base pairs, which will yield an active,<br>
processed siNA within the target cell. In other embodiments, a useful siNA or siNA precursor will be<br>
approximately 10 to 49 bp, 15 to 35 bp, or about 21 to 30 bp in length.<br>
In certain embodiments of the invention, as noted above, polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptides are<br>
used to facilitate delivery of larger nucleic acid molecules than conventional siNAs, including large nucleic acid<br>
precursors of siNAs. For example, the methods and compositions herein may be employed for enhancing delivery of<br>
larger nucleic acids that represent "precursors" to desired siNAs, wherein the precursor amino acids may be cleaved or<br>
otherwise processed before, during or after delivery to a target cell to form an active siNA for modulating gene<br>
expression within the target cell. For example, a siNA precursor polynucleotide may be selected as a circular, singlestranded<br>
polynucleotide, having two or more loop structures and a stem comprising self-complementary sense and<br>
antisense regions, wherein the antisense region comprises a nucleotide sequence that is complementary to a nucleotide<br>
sequence in a target nucleic acid molecule or a portion thereof, and the sense region having nucleotide sequence<br>
corresponding to the target nucleic acid sequence or a portion thereof, and wherein the circular polynucleotide can be<br>
processed either in vivo or in vitro to generate an active siNA molecule capable of mediating RNAi.<br>
In mammalian cells, dsRNAs longer than 30 base pairs can activate the dsRNA-dependent kinase PKR and 2'-<br>
5'-oligoadenylate synthetase, normally induced by interferon. The activated PKR inhibits general translation by<br>
phosphorylation of the translation factor eukaryotic initiation factor 2x (eIF2a), while 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase<br>
causes nonspecific mRNA degradation via activation of RNase L. By virtue of their small size (referring particularly<br>
to non-precursor forms), usually less than 30 base pairs, and most commonly between about 17-19, 19-21, or 21-23<br>
base pairs, the siNAs of the present invention avoid activation of the interferon response.<br>
In contrast to the nonspecific effect of long dsRNA, siRNA can mediate selective gene silencing in the<br>
mammalian system. Hairpin RNAs, with a short loop and 19 to 27 base pairs in the stem, also selectively silence<br>
expression of genes that are homologous to the sequence in the double-stranded stem. Mammalian cells can convert<br>
short hairpin RNA into siRNA to mediate selective gene silencing.<br>
RISC mediates cleavage of single stranded RNA having sequence complementary to the antisense strand of<br>
the siRNA duplex. Cleavage of the target RNA takes place in the middle of the region complementary to the antisense<br>
strand of the siRNA duplex. Studies have shown that 21 nucleotide siRNA duplexes are most active when containing<br>
two nucleotide 3'-overhangs. Furthermore, complete substitution of one or both siRNA strands with 2'-deoxy (2'-H) or<br>
2'-O-methyl nucleotides abolishes RNAi activity, whereas substitution of the 3'-terminal siRNA overhang nucleotides<br>
with deoxy nucleotides (2'-H) has been reported to be tolerated.<br>
Studies have shown that replacing the 3'-overhanging segments of a 21-mer siRNA duplex having 2 nucleotide<br>
3' overhangs with deoxyribonucleotides does not have an adverse effect on RNAi activity. Replacing up to 4<br>
nucleotides on each end of the siRNA with deoxyribonucleotides has been reported to be well tolerated whereas<br>
(Iffhplete substitution with deoxyribonucleotides results in no RNAi activity.<br>
Alternatively, the siNAs can be delivered as single or multiple transcription products expressed by a<br>
polynucleotide vector encoding the single or multiple siNAs and directing their expression within target cells. In these<br>
embodiments the double-stranded portion of a final transcription product of the siRNAs to be expressed within the<br>
target cell can be, for example, 15 to 49 bp, 15 to 35 bp, or about 21 to 30 bp long. Within exemplary embodiments,<br>
double-stranded portions of siNAs, in which two strands pair up, are not limited to completely paired nucleotide<br>
segments, and may contain nonpairing portions due to mismatch (the corresponding nucleotides are not<br>
complementary), bulge (lacking in the corresponding complementary nucleotide on one strand), overhang, and the like.<br>
Nonpairing portions can be contained to the extent that they do not interfere with siNA formation. In more detailed<br>
embodiments, a "bulge" may comprise 1 to 2 nonpairing nucleotides, and the double-stranded region of siNAs in<br>
which two strands pair up may contain from about 1 to 7, or about 1 to 5 bulges. In addition, "mismatch" portions<br>
contained in the double-stranded region of siNAs may be present in numbers from about 1 to 7, or about 1 to 5. Most<br>
often in the case of mismatches, one of the nucleotides is guanine, and the other is uracil. Such mismatching may be<br>
attributable, for example, to a mutation from C to T, G to A, or mixtures thereof, in a corresponding DNA coding for<br>
sense RNA, but other cause are also contemplated. Furthermore, in the present invention the double-stranded region of<br>
siNAs in which two strands pair up may contain both bulge and mismatched portions in the approximate numerical<br>
ranges specified.<br>
The terminal structure of siNAs of the invention may be either blunt or cohesive (overhanging) as long as the<br>
siNA retains its activity to silence expression of target genes. The cohesive (overhanging) end structure is not limited<br>
only to the 3' overhang as reported by others. On the contrary, the 5' overhanging structure may be included as long as<br>
it is capable of inducing a gene silencing effect such as by RNAi. In addition, the number of overhanging nucleotides<br>
is not limited to reported limits of 2 or 3 nucleotides, but can be any number as long as the overhang does not impair<br>
gene silencing activity of the siNA. For example, overhangs may comprise from about 1 to 8 nucleotides, more often<br>
from about 2 to 4 nucleotides. The total length of siNAs having cohesive end structure is expressed as the sum of the<br>
length of the paired double-stranded portion and that of a pair comprising overhanging single-strands at both ends. For<br>
example, in the exemplary case of a 19 bp double-stranded RNA with 4 nucleotide overhangs at both ends, the total<br>
length is expressed as 23 bp. Furthermore, since the overhanging sequence may have low specificity to a target gene,<br>
it is not necessarily complementary (antisense) or identical (sense) to the target gene sequence. Furthermore, as long<br>
as the siNA is able to maintain its gene silencing effect on the target gene, it may contain low molecular weight<br>
structure (for example a natural RNA molecule such as tRNA, rRNA or viral RNA, or an artificial RNA molecule), for<br>
example, in the overhanging portion at one end.<br>
In addition, the terminal structure of the siNAs may have a stem-loop structure in which ends of one side of<br>
the double-stranded nucleic acid are connected by a linker nucleic acid, e.g., a linker RNA. The length of the doublestranded<br>
region (stem-loop portion) can be, for example, 15 to 49 bp, often 15 to 35 bp, and more commonly about 21<br>
to 30 bp long. Alternatively, the length of the double-stranded region that is a final transcription product of siNAs to<br>
be expressed in a target cell may be, for example, approximately 15 to 49 bp, 15 to 35 bp, or about 21 to 30 bp long.<br>
When linker segments are employed, there is no particular limitation in the length of the linker as long as it does not<br>
hinder pairing of the stem portion. For example, for stable pairing of the stem portion and suppression of<br>
recombination between DNAs coding for this portion, the linker portion may have a clover-leaf tRNA structure. Even<br>
if the linker has a length that would hinder pairing of the stem portion, it is possible, for example, to construct the<br>
linker portion to include introns so that the introns are excised during processing of a precursor RNA into mature<br>
RNA, thereby allowing pairing of the stem portion. In the case of a stem-loop siRNA, either end (head or tail) of RNA<br>
with no loop structure may have a low molecular weight RNA. As described above, these low molecular weight<br>
RNAs may include a natural RNA molecule, such as tRNA, rRNA or viral RNA, or an artificial RNA molecule.<br>
The siNA can also comprise a single stranded polynucleotide having nucleotide sequence complementary to<br>
nucleotide sequence in a target nucleic acid molecule or a portion thereof (for example, where such siNA molecule<br>
does not require the presence within the siNA molecule of nucleotide sequence corresponding to the target nucleic acid<br>
sequence or a portion thereof), wherein the single stranded polynucleotide can further comprise a terminal phosphate<br>
group, such as a 5'-phosphate (see for example Martinez et al.,Cell., 110: 563-574 (2002) and Schwarz et al.,<br>
Molecular Cell, 10: 537-568(2002), or 5',3'-diphosphate.<br>
As used herein, the term siNA molecule is not limited to molecules containing only naturally-occurring RNA<br>
or DNA, but also encompasses chemically-modified nucleotides and non-nucleotides. In certain embodiments, the<br>
short interfering nucleic acid molecules of the invention lack 2'-hydroxy (2'-OH) containing nucleotides. In certain<br>
- 12. rembodiments<br>
short interfering nucleic acids do not require the presence of nucleotides having a 2'-hydroxy group for<br>
mediating RNAi and as such, short interfering nucleic acid molecules of the invention optionally do not include any<br>
ribonucleotides (e.g., nucleotides having a 2'-OH group). Such siNA molecules that do not require the presence of<br>
ribonucleotides within the siNA molecule to support RNAi can however have an attached linker or linkers or other<br>
attached or associated groups, moieties, or chains containing one or more nucleotides with 2'-OH groups. Optionally,<br>
siNA molecules can comprise ribonucleotides at about 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50% of the nucleotide positions.<br>
As used herein, the term siNA is meant to be equivalent to other terms used to describe nucleic acid molecules<br>
that are capable of mediating sequence specific RNAi, for example short interfering RNA (siRNA), double-stranded<br>
RNA (dsRNA), micro-RNA (mRNA), short hairpin RNA (shRNA), short interfering oligonucleotide, short interfering<br>
nucleic acid, short interfering modified oligonucleotide, chemically-modified siRNA, post-transcriptional gene<br>
silencing RNA (ptgsRNA), and others.<br>
In other embodiments, siNA molecules for use within the invention may comprise separate sense and antisense<br>
sequences or regions, wherein the sense and antisense regions are covalently linked by nucleotide or non-nucleotide<br>
linker molecules, or are alternately non-covalently linked by ionic interactions, hydrogen bonding, van der waals<br>
interactions, hydrophobic interactions, and/or stacking interactions.<br>
"Antisense RNA" is an RNA strand having a sequence complementary to a target gene mRNA, and thought to<br>
induce RNAi by binding to the target gene mRNA. "Sense RNA" has a sequence complementary to the antisense<br>
RNA, and annealed to its complementary antisense RNA to form siRNA. These antisense and sense RNAs have been<br>
conventionally synthesized with an RNA synthesizer.<br>
As used herein, the term "RNAi construct" is a generic term used throughout the specification to include small<br>
interfering RNAs (siRNAs), hairpin RNAs, and other RNA species which can be cleaved in vivo to form siRNAs.<br>
RNAi constructs herein also include expression vectors (also referred to as RNAi expression vectors) capable of giving<br>
rise to transcripts which form dsRNAs or hairpin RNAs in cells, and/or transcripts which can produce siRNAs in vivo.<br>
Optionally, the siRNA include single strands or double strands of siRNA.<br>
An siHybrid molecule is a double-stranded nucleic acid that has a similar function to siRNA. Instead of a<br>
double-stranded RNA molecule, an siHybrid is comprised of an RNA strand and a DNA strand. Preferably, the RNA<br>
strand is the antisense strand as that is the strand that binds to the target mRNA. The siHybrid created by the<br>
hybridization of the DNA and RNA strands have a hybridized complementary portion and preferably at least one<br>
3'overhanging end.<br>
siNAs for use within the invention can be assembled from two separate oligonucleotides, where one strand is<br>
the sense strand and the other is the antisense strand, wherein the antisense and sense strands are self-complementary<br>
(i.e. each strand comprises nucleotide sequence that is complementary to nucleotide sequence in the other strand; such<br>
as where the antisense strand and sense strand form a duplex or double stranded structure, for example wherein the<br>
double stranded region is about 19 base pairs). The antisense strand may comprise a nucleotide sequence that is<br>
complementary to a nucleotide sequence in a target nucleic acid molecule or a portion thereof, and the sense strand<br>
may comprise a nucleotide sequence corresponding to the target nucleic acid sequence or a portion thereof.<br>
Alternatively, the siNA can be assembled from a single oligonucleotide, where the self-complementary sense and<br>
antisense regions of the siNA are linked by means of a nucleic acid-based or non-nucleic acid-based linker(s).<br>
Within additional embodiments, siNAs for intracellular delivery according to the methods and compositions of<br>
the invention can be a polynucleotide with a duplex, asymmetric duplex, hairpin or asymmetric hairpin secondary<br>
structure, having self-complementary sense and antisense regions, wherein the antisense region comprises a nucleotide<br>
sequence that is complementary to a nucleotide sequence in a separate target nucleic acid molecule or a portion<br>
thereof, and the sense region comprises a nucleotide sequence corresponding to the target nucleic acid sequence or a<br>
portion thereof.<br>
Non-limiting examples of chemical modifications that can be made in an siNA include without limitation<br>
phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages, 2'-deoxyribonucleotides, 2'-O-methyl ribonucleotides, 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro<br>
ribonucleotides, "universal base" nucleotides, "acyclic" nucleotides, 5-C-methyl nucleotides, and terminal glyceryl<br>
and/or inverted deoxy abasic residue incorporation. These chemical modifications, when used in various siNA<br>
constructs, are shown to preserve RNAi activity in cells while at the same time, dramatically increasing the serum<br>
stability of these compounds.<br>
In a non-limiting example, the introduction of chemically-modified nucleotides into nucleic acid molecules<br>
provides a powerful tool in overcoming potential limitations of in vivo stability and bioavailability inherent to native<br>
RNA molecules that are delivered exogenously. For example, the use of chemically-modified nucleic acid molecules<br>
can enable a lower dose of a particular nucleic acid molecule for a given therapeutic effect since chemically-modified<br>
nucleic acid molecules tend to have a longer half-life in serum. Furthermore, certain chemical modifications can<br>
improve the bioavailability of nucleic acid molecules by targeting particular cells or tissues and/or improving cellular<br>
uptake of the nucleic acid molecule. Therefore, even if the activity of a chemically-modified nucleic acid molecule is<br>
reduced as compared to a native nucleic acid molecule, for example, when compared to an all-RNA nucleic acid<br>
molecule, the overall activity of the modified nucleic acid molecule can be greater than that of the native molecule due<br>
to improved stability and/or delivery of the molecule. Unlike native unmodified siNA, chemically-modified siNA can<br>
also minimize the possibility of activating interferon activity in humans.<br>
The siNA molecules described herein, the antisense region of a siNA molecule of the invention can comprise a<br>
phosphorothioate internucleotide linkage at the 3'-end of said antisense region. In any of the embodiments of siNA<br>
molecules described herein, the antisense region can comprise about one to about five phosphorothioate<br>
internucleotide linkages at the 5'-end of said antisense region. In any of the embodiments of siNA molecules described<br>
herein, the 3'-terminal nucleotide overhangs of a siNA molecule of the invention can comprise ribonucleotides or<br>
deoxyribonucleotides that are chemically-modified at a nucleic acid sugar, base, or backbone. In any of the<br>
embodiments of siNA molecules described herein, the 3'-terminal nucleotide overhangs can comprise one or more<br>
universal base ribonucleotides. In any of the embodiments of siNA molecules described herein, the 3'-terminal<br>
nucleotide overhangs can comprise one or more acyclic nucleotides.<br>
For example, in a non-limiting example, the invention features a chemically-modified short interfering nucleic<br>
acid (siNA) having about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or more phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages in one siNA strand. In<br>
yet another embodiment, the invention features a chemically-modified short interfering nucleic acid (siNA)<br>
individually having about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or more phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages in both siNA strands.<br>
The phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages can be present in one or both oligonucleotide strands of the siNA<br>
duplex, for example in the sense strand, the antisense strand, or both strands. The siNA molecules of the invention can<br>
comprise one or more phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages at the 3'-end, the 5'-end, or both of the 3'- and S'-ends<br>
of the sense strand, the antisense strand, or both strands. For example, an exemplary siNA molecule of the invention<br>
can comprise about 1 to about 5 or more (e.g., about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more) consecutive phosphorothioate<br>
internucleotide linkages at the 5'-end of the sense strand, the antisense strand, or both strands. In another non-limiting<br>
example, an exemplary siNA molecule of the invention can comprise one or more (e.g., about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,<br>
10, or more) pyrimidine phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages in the sense strand, the antisense strand, or both<br>
strands, hi yet another non-limiting example, an exemplary siNA molecule of the invention can comprise one or more<br>
(e.g., about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more) purine phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages in the sense strand,<br>
the antisense strand, or both strands.<br>
An siNA molecule may be comprised of a circular nucleic acid molecule, wherein the siNA is about 38 to<br>
about 70 (e.g., about 38, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, or 70) nucleotides in length having about 18 to about 23 (e.g., about 18,<br>
19, 20, 21, 22, or 23) base pairs wherein the circular oligonucleotide forms a dumbbell shaped structure having about<br>
19 base pairs and 2 loops.<br>
A circular siNA molecule contains two loop motifs, wherein one or both loop portions of the siNA molecule is<br>
biodegradable. For example, a circular siNA molecule of the invention is designed such that degradation of the loop<br>
portions of the siNA molecule in vivo can generate a double-stranded siNA molecule with 3'-terminal overhangs, such<br>
as 3'-terminal nucleotide overhangs comprising about 2 nucleotides.<br>
Modified nucleotides present in siNA molecules, preferably in the antisense strand of the siNA molecules, but<br>
also optionally in the sense and/or both antisense and sense strands, comprise modified nucleotides having properties<br>
or characteristics similar to naturally occurring ribonucleotides. For example, the invention features siNA molecules<br>
including modified nucleotides having a Northern conformation (e.g., Northern pseudorotation cycle, see for example<br>
Saenger, Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure, Springer-Verlag ed., 1984). As such, chemically modified nucleotides<br>
present in the siNA molecules of the invention, preferably in the antisense strand of the siNA molecules of the<br>
invention, but also optionally in the sense and/or both antisense and sense strands, are resistant to nuclease degradation<br>
while at the same time maintaining the capacity to mediate RNAi. Non-limiting examples of nucleotides having a<br>
northern configuration include locked nucleic acid (LNA) nucleotides (e.g., 2'-O, 4'-C-methylene-(D-ribofuranosyl)<br>
nucleotides); 2'-methoxyethoxy (MOE) nucleotides; 2'-methyl-thio-ethyl, 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro nucleotides. 2'-deoxy-2'-<br>
chloro nucleotides, 2'-azido nucleotides, and 2'-O-methyl nucleotides.<br>
The sense strand of a double stranded siNA molecule may have a terminal cap moiety such as an inverted<br>
pfeoxybasic moiety, at the 3'-end, 5'-end, or both 3' and 5'-ends of the sense strand.<br>
Non-limiting examples of conjugates include conjugates and ligands described in Vargeese et al., U.S.<br>
Application Serial No. 10/427,160, filed April 30, 2003, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, including the<br>
drawings. In another embodiment, the conjugate is covalently attached to the chemically-modified siNA molecule via<br>
a biodegradable linker. In one embodiment, the conjugate molecule is attached at the 3'-end of either the sense strand,<br>
the antisense strand, or both strands of the chemically-modified siNA molecule. In another embodiment, the conjugate<br>
molecule is attached at the 5'-end of either the sense strand, the antisense strand, or both strands of the chemicallymodified<br>
siNA molecule. In yet another embodiment, the conjugate molecule is attached both the 3'-end and 5'-end of<br>
either the sense strand, the antisense strand, or both strands of the chemically-modified siNA molecule, or any<br>
combination thereof, hi one embodiment, a conjugate molecule of the invention comprises a molecule that facilitates<br>
delivery of a chemically-modified siNA molecule into a biological system, such as a cell. In another embodiment, the<br>
conjugate molecule attached to the chemically-modified siNA molecule is a poly ethylene glycol, human serum<br>
albumin, or a ligand for a cellular receptor that can mediate cellular uptake. Examples of specific conjugate molecules<br>
contemplated by the instant invention that can be attached to chemically-modified siNA molecules are described in<br>
Vargeese et al., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20030130186, published July 10, 2003, and U.S. Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 20040110296, published June 10, 2004. The type of conjugates used and the extent of<br>
conjugation of siNA molecules of the invention can be evaluated for improved pharmacokinetic profiles,<br>
bioavailability, and/or stability of siNA constructs while at the same time maintaining the ability of the siNA to<br>
mediate RNAi activity. As such, one skilled in the art can screen siNA constructs that are modified with various<br>
conjugates to determine whether the siNA conjugate complex possesses improved properties while maintaining the<br>
ability to mediate RNAi, for example in animal models as are generally known in the art.<br>
A siNA further may be further comprised of a nucleotide, non-nucleotide, or mixed nucleotide/non-nucleotide<br>
linker that joins the sense region of the siNA to the antisense region of the siNA. In one embodiment, a nucleotide<br>
linker can be a linker of 2 nucleotides in length, for example about 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 nucleotides in length. In<br>
another embodiment, the nucleotide linker can be a nucleic acid aptamer. By "aptamer" or "nucleic acid aptamer" as<br>
used herein is meant a nucleic acid molecule that binds specifically to a target molecule wherein the nucleic acid<br>
molecule has sequence that comprises a sequence recognized by the target molecule in its natural setting. Alternately,<br>
an aptamer can be a nucleic acid molecule that binds to a target molecule where the target molecule does not naturally<br>
bind to a nucleic acid. The target molecule can be any molecule of interest. For example, the aptamer can be used to<br>
bind to a ligand-binding domain of a protein, thereby preventing interaction of the naturally occurring ligand with the<br>
protein. This is a non-limiting example and those in the art will recognize that other embodiments can be readily<br>
generated using techniques generally known in the art. [See, for example, Gold et al, Annu. Rev. Biochem., 64: 763<br>
(1995); Brody and Gold, J. Biotechnol., 74: 5 (2000); Sun, Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther., 2:100 (2000); Kusser, J.<br>
Biotechnol, 74: 27 (2000); Hermann and Patel, Science 287: 820 (2000); and Jayasena, Clinical Chemistry, 45: 1628.<br>
(1999)<br>
A non-nucleotide linker may be comprised of an abasic nucleotide, polyether, polyamine, polyamide, peptide,<br>
carbohydrate, lipid, polyhydrocarbon, or other polymeric compounds (e.g. polyethylene glycols such as those having<br>
between 2 and 100 ethylene glycol units). Specific examples include those described by Seela and Kaiser, Nucleic<br>
Acids Res., 18:6353 (1990) and Nucleic Acids Res., 15:3113 (1987); Cload and Schepartz, J. Am. Chem. Soc.,<br>

Soc., 113:4000 (1991). A "non-nucleotide" further means any group or compound that can be incorporated into a<br>
nucleic acid chain in the place of one or more nucleotide units, including either sugar and/or phosphate substitutions,<br>
and allows the remaining bases to exhibit their enzymatic activity. The group or compound can be abasic in that it does<br>
not contain a commonly recognized nucleotide base, such as adenosine, guanine, cytosine, uracil or thymidine, for<br>
example at the Cl position of the sugar.<br>
The synthesis of a siNA molecule of the invention, which can be chemically-modified, comprises: (a)<br>
synthesis of two complementary strands of the siNA molecule; (b) annealing the two complementary strands together<br>
under conditions suitable to obtain a double-stranded siNA molecule. In another embodiment, synthesis of the two<br>
complementary strands of the siNA molecule is by solid phase oligonucleotide synthesis, hi yet another embodiment,<br>
synthesis of the two complementary strands of the siNA molecule is by solid phase tandem oligonucleotide synthesis.<br>
Oligonucleotides (e.g., certain modified oligonucleotides or portions of oligonucleotides lacking<br>
onucleotides) are synthesized using protocols known in the art, for example as described in Caruthers et al., 1992,<br>
Methods in Enzymology 211, 3-19, Thompson et al., International PCT Publication No. WO 99/54459, Wincott et al.,<br>

Biotechnol Bioeng., 61, 33-45, and Brennan, U.S. Pat. No. 6,001,311. Synthesis of RNA, including certain siNA<br>
molecules of the invention, follows general procedures as described, for example, in Usman et al., 1987, J. Am. Chem.<br>
Soc., 109, 7845; Scaringe et al., 1990, Nucleic Acids Res., 18, 5433; and Wincott et al., 1995, Nucleic Acids Res. 23,<br>
2677-2684 Wincott et al., 1997, Methods Mol. Bio., 74, 59.<br>
Supplemental or complementary methods for delivery of nucleic acid molecules for use within then invention<br>
are described, for example, in Akhtar et al., Trends Cell Bio., 2, 139 (1992); Delivery Strategies for Antisense<br>
Oligonucleotide Therapeutics, ed. Akhtar, 1995, Maurer et al., Mol. Membr. Biol., 16: 129-140 (1999); Hofland and<br>
Huang, Handb. Exp. Pharmacol., 137: 165-192 (1999); and Lee et al., ACS Symp. Ser., 752: 184-192 (2000). Sullivan<br>
et al., International PCT Publication No WO 94/02595, further describes general methods for delivery of enzymatic<br>
nucleic acid molecules. These protocols can be utilized to supplement or complement delivery of virtually any nucleic<br>
acid molecule contemplated within the invention.<br>
Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
Nucleic acid molecules and polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptides can be administered to cells by a<br>
variety of methods known to those of skill in the art, including, but not restricted to, administration within formulations<br>
that comprise the siNA and polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptide alone, or that further comprise one or more<br>
additional components, such as a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, excipient, adjuvant, emulsifier, buffer,<br>
stabilizer, preservative, and the like. In certain embodiments, the siNA and/or the polynucleotide delivery-enhancing<br>
polypeptide can be encapsulated in liposomes, administered by iontophoresis, or incorporated into other vehicles, such<br>
as hydrogels, cyclodextrins, biodegradable nanocapsules, bioadhesive microspheres, or proteinaceous vectors (see e.g.,<br>
O'Hare and Normand, International PCT Publication No. WO 00/53722). Alternatively, a nucleic acid/peptide/vehicle<br>
combination can be locally delivered by direct injection or by use of an infusion pump. Direct injection of the nucleic<br>
acid molecules of the invention, whether subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intradermal, can take place using standard<br>
needle and syringe methodologies, or by needle-free technologies such as those described in Conry et al., Clin. Cancer<br>
Res., 5: 2330-2337 (1999) and Barry et al., International PCT Publication No. WO 99/31262.<br>
The compositions of the instant invention can be effectively employed as pharmaceutical agents.<br>
Pharmaceutical agents prevent, modulate the occurrence or severity of, or treat (alleviate one or more symptom(s) to a<br>
detectable or measurable extent) of a disease state or other adverse condition in a patient.<br>
Thus within additional embodiments the invention provides pharmaceutical compositions and methods<br>
featuring the presence or administration of one or more polynucleic acid(s), typically one or more siNAs, combined,<br>
complexed, or conjugated with a polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptide, optionally formulated with a<br>
pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier, such as a diluent, stabilizer, buffer, and the like.<br>
The present invention satisfies additional objects and advantages by providing short interfering nucleic acid<br>
(siNA) molecules that modulate expression of genes associated with a particular disease state or other adverse<br>
condition in a subject. Typically, the siNA will target a gene that is expressed at an elevated level as a causal or<br>
contributing factor associated with the subject disease state or adverse condition. In this context, the siNA will<br>
effectively downregulate expression of the gene to levels that prevent, alleviate, or reduce the severity or recurrence of<br>
one or more associated disease symptoms. Alternatively, for various distinct disease models where expression of the<br>
target gene is not necessarily elevated as a consequence or sequel of disease or other adverse condition, down<br>
regulation of the target gene will nonetheless result in a therapeutic result by lowering gene expression (i.e., to reduce<br>
levels of a selected mRNA and/or protein product of the target gene). Alternatively, siNAs of the invention may be<br>
targeted to lower expression of one gene, which can result in upregulation of a "downstream" gene whose expression<br>
is negatively regulated by a product or activity of the target gene.<br>
Within exemplary embodiments, the compositions and methods of the invention are useful as therapeutic tools<br>
to regulate expression of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) to treat or prevent symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).<br>
In this context the invention further provides compounds, compositions, and methods useful for modulating expression<br>
and activity of TNF- a by RNA interference (RNAi) using small nucleic acid molecules. In more detailed<br>
embodiments, the invention provides small nucleic acid molecules, such as short interfering nucleic acid (siNA), short<br>
interfering RNA (siRNA), double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), micro-RNA (mRNA), and short hairpin RNA (shRNA)<br>
molecules, and related methods, that are effective for modulating expression of TNF-a and/or TNF-a genes to prevent<br>
or alleviate symptoms of RA in mammalian subjects. Within these and related therapeutic compositions and methods,<br>
me use of chemically-modified siNAs will often improve properties of the modified siNAs in comparison to properties<br>
of native siNA molecules, for example by providing increased resistance to nuclease degradation in vivo, and/or<br>
through improved cellular uptake. As can be readily determined according to the disclosure herein, useful siNAs<br>
having multiple chemical modifications will retain their RNAi activity. The siNA molecules of the instant invention<br>
thus provide useful reagents and methods for a variety of therapeutic, diagnostic, target validation, genomic discovery,<br>
genetic engineering, and pharmacogenomic applications.<br>
This siNAs of the present invention may be administered in any form, for example transdermally or by local<br>
injection (e.g., local injection at sites of psoriatic plaques to treat psoriasis, or into the joints of patients afflicted with<br>
psoriatic arthritis or RA). In more detailed embodiments, the invention provides formulations and methods to<br>
administer therapeutically effective amounts of siNAs directed against of a mRNA of TNF-a, which effectively downregulate<br>
the TNF- a RNA and thereby reduce or prevent one or more TNF-a-associated inflammatory condition(s).<br>
Comparable methods and compositions are provided that target expression of one or more different genes associated<br>
with a selected disease condition in animal subjects, including any of a large number of genes whose expression is<br>
known to be aberrantly increased as a causal or contributing factor associated with the selected disease condition.<br>
The siNA/polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptide mixtures of the invention can be administered in<br>
conjunction with other standard treatments for a targeted disease condition, for example in conjunction with<br>
therapeutic agents effective against inflammatory diseases, such as RA or psoriasis. Examples of combinatorially<br>
useful and effective agents in this context include non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), methotrexate, gold<br>
compounds, D-penicillamine, the antimalarials, sulfasalazine, glucocorticoids, and other TNF-a neutralizing agents<br>
such as infliximab and entracept.<br>
Negatively charged polynucleotides of the invention (e.g., RNA or DNA) can be administered to a patient by<br>
any standard means, with or without stabilizers, buffers, and the like, to form a pharmaceutical composition. When it<br>
is desired to use a liposome delivery mechanism, standard protocols for formation of liposomes can be followed. The<br>
compositions of the present invention may also be formulated and used as tablets, capsules or elixirs for oral<br>
administration, suppositories for rectal administration, sterile solutions, suspensions for injectable administration, and<br>
the other compositions known in the art.<br>
The present invention also includes pharmaceutically acceptable formulations of the compositions described<br>
herein. These formulations include salts of the above compounds, e.g., acid addition salts, for example, salts of<br>
hydrochloric, hydrobromic, acetic acid, and benzene sulfonic acid.<br>
A pharmacological composition or formulation refers to a composition or formulation in a form suitable for<br>
administration, e.g., systemic administration, into a cell or patient, including for example a human. Suitable forms, in<br>
part, depend upon the use or the route of entry, for example oral, transdermal, or by injection. Such forms should not<br>
prevent the composition or formulation from reaching a target cell (i.e., a cell to which the negatively charged nucleic<br>
acid is desirable for delivery). For example, pharmacological compositions injected into the blood stream should be<br>
soluble. Other factors are known in the art, and include considerations such as toxicity.<br>
By "systemic administration" is meant in vivo systemic absorption or accumulation of drugs in the blood<br>
stream followed by distribution throughout the entire body. Administration routes which lead to systemic absorption<br>
include, without limitation: intravenous, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, inhalation, oral, intrapulmonary and<br>
intramuscular. Each of these administration routes exposes the desired negatively charged polymers, e.g., nucleic<br>
acids, to an accessible diseased tissue. The rate of entry of a drug into the circulation has been shown to be a function<br>
of molecular weight or size. The use of a liposome or other drug carrier comprising the compounds of the instant<br>
invention can potentially localize the drug, for example, in certain tissue types, such as the tissues of the reticular<br>
endothelial system (RES). A liposome formulation that can facilitate the association of drug with the surface of cells,<br>
such as, lymphocytes and macrophages is also useful. This approach may provide enhanced delivery of the drug to<br>
target cells by taking advantage of the specificity of macrophage and lymphocyte immune recognition of abnormal<br>
cells, such as cancer cells.<br>
By "pharmaceutically acceptable formulation" is meant, a composition or formulation that allows for the<br>
effective distribution of the nucleic acid molecules of the instant invention in the physical location most suitable for<br>
their desired activity. Nonlimiting examples of agents suitable for formulation with the nucleic acid molecules of the<br>
instant invention include: P-glycoprotein inhibitors (such as Pluronic P85), which can enhance entry of drugs into the<br>
CNS [Jolliet-Riant and Tillement, Fundam. Clin. Pharmacol., 13:16-26 (1999)]; biodegradable polymers, such as poly<br>
 (DL-lactide-coglycolide) microspheres for sustained release delivery after intracerebral implantation (Emerich, D F et<br>
a/., Cell Transplant, 8: 47-58 (1999)] (Alkermes, Inc. Cambridge, Mass.); and loaded nanoparticles, such as those<br>
made of polybutylcyanoacrylate, which can deliver drugs across the blood brain barrier and can alter neuronal uptake<br>
mechanisms (Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry, 23: 941-949, (1999)]. Other non-limiting examples of<br>
delivery strategies for the nucleic acid molecules of the instant invention include material described in Boado et al., J.<br>
Pharm. Sci., 87:1308-1315 (1998); Tyler et al., FEES Lett, 421: 280-284 (1999); Pardridge et al., PNAS USA., 92:<br>
5592-5596 (1995); Boado, Adv. Drug Delivery Rev., 15: 73-107 (1995); Aldrian-Herrada et al., Nucleic Acids Res.,<br>
26: 4910-4916 (1998); and Tyler et al., PNAS USA, 96: 7053-7058 (1999).<br>
The present invention also includes compositions prepared for storage or administration, which include a<br>
pharmaceutically effective amount of the desired compounds in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.<br>
Acceptable carriers or diluents for therapeutic use are well known in the pharmaceutical art, and are described, for<br>
example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co. (A. R. Gennaro edit. 1985). For example,<br>
preservatives, stabilizers, dyes and flavoring agents may be provided. These include sodium benzoate, sorbic acid and<br>
esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid. In addition, antioxidants and suspending agents may be used.<br>
A pharmaceutically effective dose is that dose required to prevent, inhibit the occurrence of, or treat (alleviate<br>
a symptom to some extent, preferably all of the symptoms) a disease state. The pharmaceutically effective dose<br>
depends on the type of disease, the composition used, the route of administration, the type of mammal being treated,<br>
the physical characteristics of the specific mammal under consideration, concurrent medication, and other factors that<br>
those skilled in the medical arts will recognize. Generally, an amount between 0.1 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg body<br>
weight/day of active ingredients is administered dependent upon potency of the negatively charged polymer.<br>
Aqueous suspensions contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of<br>
aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose,<br>
methylcellulose, hydropropyl-methylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia;<br>
dispersing or wetting agents can be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example, lecithin, or condensation products<br>
of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene<br>
oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of<br>
ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate,<br>
or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for<br>
example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions can also contain one or more preservatives, for<br>
example ethyl, or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or<br>
more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.<br>
Oily suspensions can be formulated by suspending the active ingredients in a vegetable oil, for example<br>
arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions can<br>
contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents and flavoring<br>
agents can be added to provide palatable oral preparations. These compositions can be preserved by the addition of an<br>
anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.<br>
Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water<br>
provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more<br>
preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents or suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned<br>
above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, can also be present.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase<br>
can be a vegetable oil or a mineral oil or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents can be naturally-occurring<br>
gums, for example gum acacia or gum tragacanth, naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin,<br>
and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol, anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate, and<br>
condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate.<br>
The emulsions can also contain sweetening and flavoring agents.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions can be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension.<br>
This suspension can be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and<br>
suspending agents that have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation can also be a sterile injectable<br>
solution or suspension in a non-toxic parentally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-<br>
butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that can be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic<br>
sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending<br>
medium. For this purpose, any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono-or diglycerides. In addition,<br>
ratty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.<br>
The siNAs can also be administered in the form of suppositories, e.g., for rectal administration of the drug.<br>
These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient that is solid at ordinary<br>
temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such<br>
materials include cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.<br>
The siNAs can be modified extensively to enhance stability by modification with nuclease resistant groups, for<br>
example, 2'-amino, 2'-C-allyl, 2'-fluoro, 2'-O-methyl, 2'-H. [For a review see Usman and Cedergren, TIBS 17: 34<br>
(1992); Usman et al., Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 31: 163 (1994)]. SiNA constructs can be purified by gel<br>
electrophoresis using general methods or can be purified by high pressure liquid chromatography and re-suspended in<br>
water.<br>
Chemically synthesizing nucleic acid molecules with modifications (base, sugar and/or phosphate) can prevent<br>
their degradation by serum ribonucleases, which can increase their potency. See e.g., Eckstein et al., International<br>

phosphate and/or sugar moieties of the nucleic acid molecules described herein.<br>
There are several examples in the art describing sugar, base and phosphate modifications that can be<br>
introduced into nucleic acid molecules with significant enhancement in their nuclease stability and efficacy. For<br>
example, oligonucleotides are modified to enhance stability and/or enhance biological activity by modification with<br>
nuclease resistant groups, for example, 2'-amino, 2'-C-allyl, 2'-fluoro, 2'-O-methyl, 2'-O-allyl, 2'-H, nucleotide base<br>
modifications. For a review see Usman and Cedergren, , TIBS. 17: 34 (1992); Usman et al., Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser.<br>

describe general methods and strategies to determine the location of incorporation of sugar, base and/or phosphate<br>
modifications and the like into nucleic acid molecules without modulating catalysis. In view of such teachings, similar<br>
modifications can be used as described herein to modify the siNA nucleic acid molecules of the instant invention so<br>
long as the ability of siNA to promote RNAi in cells is not significantly inhibited.<br>
While chemical modification of oligonucleotide internucleotide linkages with phosphorothioate,<br>
phosphorodithioate, and/or 5'-methylphosphonate linkages improves stability, excessive modifications can cause some<br>
toxicity or decreased activity. Therefore, when designing nucleic acid molecules, the amount of these internucleotide<br>
linkages should be minimized. The reduction in the concentration of these linkages should lower toxicity, resulting in<br>
increased efficacy and higher specificity of these molecules.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention features modified siNA molecules, with phosphate backbone modifications<br>
comprising one or more phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate, methylphosphonate, phosphotriester, morpholino,<br>
amidate carbamate, carboxymethyl, acetamidate, polyamide, sulfonate, sulfonamide, sulfamate, formacetal,<br>
thioformacetal, and/or alkylsilyl, substitutions. For a review of oligonucleotide backbone modifications, see Hunziker<br>

94/02595 further describe the general methods for delivery of nucleic acid molecules. These protocols can be utilized<br>
for the delivery of virtually any nucleic acid molecule. Nucleic acid molecules can be administered to cells by a<br>
TOriety of methods known to those of skill in the art, including, but not restricted to, encapsulation in liposomes, by<br>
iontophoresis, or by incorporation into other vehicles, such as biodegradable polymers, hydrogels, cyclodextrins (see<br>
for example Gonzalez et al., Bioconjugate Chem., 10: 1068-1074 (1999); Wang et al., International PCT publication<br>
Nos. WO 03/47518 and WO 03/46185), poly(lactic-co-glycolic)ac- id (PLGA) and PLCA microspheres (see for<br>
example U.S. Pat. No. 6,447,796 and US Patent Application Publication No. US 2002130430), biodegradable<br>
nanocapsules, and bioadhesive microspheres, or by proteinaceous vectors (O'Hare and Normand, International PCT<br>
Publication No. WO 00/53722). Alternatively, the nucleic acid/vehicle combination is locally delivered by direct<br>
injection or by use of an infusion pump. Direct injection of the nucleic acid molecules of the invention, whether<br>
subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intradermal, can take place using standard needle and syringe methodologies, or by<br>
needle-free technologies such as those described in Conry et al., Clin. Cancer Res., 5: 2330-2337 (1999) and Barry et<br>
al., International PCT Publication No. WO 99/31262. The molecules of the instant invention can be used as<br>
pharmaceutical agents. Pharmaceutical agents prevent, modulate the occurrence, or treat (alleviate a symptom to some<br>
extent, preferably all of the symptoms) of a disease state in a subject.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
Production and Characterization of Compositions Comprising a siRNA<br>
Complexed With a Polynucleotide Delivery-Enhancing Polypeptide<br>
To form complexes between candidate siRNAs and polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptides of the<br>
invention, an adequate amount of siRNA is combined with a pre-determined amount of polynucleotide deliveryenhancing<br>
polypeptide, for example in Opti-MEM® cell medium (Invitrogen), in defined ratios and incubated at room<br>
temperature for about 10-30 min. Subsequently a selected volume, e.g., about 50 ul, of this mixture is brought into<br>
contact with target cells and the cells are incubated for a predetermined incubation period, which in the present<br>
example was about 2 hr. The siRNA/peptide mixture can optionally include cell culture medium or other additives<br>
such as fetal bovine serum. For H3, H4 and H2b, a series of experiments was performed to complex these<br>
polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptides with siRNA in different ratios. Generally this was initiated with a<br>
1:0.01 to 1:50 of siRNA/histone ratio. To each well in a 96-well microtiter plate, 40 pm siRNA was added. Each well<br>
contained beta-gal cells at 50% confluency. Exemplary optimized ratios for transfection efficiency are shown in Table<br>
2 below.<br>
Transfections were performed with either regular siRNA or siRNA complexed with one of the aboveidentified<br>
histone proteins on 9L/beta-gal cells. The siRNA was designed to specifically knock down betagalactosidase<br>
mRNA, and activities are expressed as percentage of beta-gal activities from control (control cells were<br>
transfected using lipofectamine without the polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptide).<br>
Assays for detecting and/or quantifying the efficiency of siRNA delivery are carried out using conventional<br>
methods, for example beta-galactosidase assay or flow cytometry methods.<br>
For beta-galactosidase assays, 9L/LacZ cells, a cell line constitutively expressing beta-galactosidase, were<br>
used. 9L/LacZ cells are rat gliosarcoma fibroblast cells that constitutively express LacZ and were obtained from ATCC<br>
(#CRL-2200). 9L/LacZ cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Essential Medium (DMEM) media with a<br>
supplement of 1 mM sodium pyruvate, nonessential amino acids, and 20% fetal bovine serum. Cells were cultured at<br>
37°C and 5% CO2 supplemented with an antibiotic mixture containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 n.g/ml streptomycin<br>
and 0.25 mg/ml Fungizone (Invitrogen). The siRNA duplex designed against beta-gal mRNA was chemically<br>
synthesized and used with delivery reagents to evaluate knock-down efficiency.<br>
siRNA Synthesis and Preparation<br>
Synthesis of oligonucleotides was carried out using the standard 2-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite method on<br>
long chain alkylamine controlled pore glass derivatized with 5'-O-Dimethyltrityl-2'-O-/-butyldimethylsilyl-3'-6-<br>
succinyl ribonucleoside of choice or 5'-O-Dimethyltrityl-2'-deoxy-3'-O-succinyl thymidine support where applicable.<br>
All oligonucleotides were synthesized at either the 0.2 or 1-umol scale using an ABI 3400 DNA/RNA synthesizer,<br>
cleaved from the solid support using concentrated NH4OH, and deprotected using a 3:1 mixture of NHjOH : EtOH at<br>
55 °C. The deprotection of 2'-TBDMS protecting groups was achieved by incubating the base-deprotected RNA with a<br>
ablution (600 |LiL per rnol) of N-methylpyrrolidone/triethylamine/triethylamine tris(hydrofluoride) (6:3:4 by volume)<br>
at 65 °C for 2.5 hours. The corresponding building blocks, 5'-dimethoxytrityl-A-(tac)-2'-O-(/-butyldimethylsilyl)-3'-<br>
[(2-cyanoethyl)-(A,Ar-diisopropyl)]-phosphoramidites of A, U, C and G (Proligo, Boulder CO) as well the modified<br>
phosphoramidites, 5'DMTr-5-methyl-U-TOM-CE-Phosphoramidite, 5'-DMTr-2'-OMe-Ac-C-CE Phosphoramidite, 5'-<br>
DMTr-2'-OMe-G-CE Phosphoramidite, 5'-DMTr-2'-OMe-U-CE Phosphoramidite, 5'-DMTr-2'-OMe-A-CE<br>
Phosphoramidite (Glen Research) were purchased directly from suppliers. Triethylamine-trihydrofluride, Nmethylpyrrolidinone<br>
and concentrated ammonium hydroxide was purchased from Aldrich. All HPLC analysis and<br>
purifications were performed on a Waters 2690 with Xterra™ columns. All other reagents were purchased from Glen<br>
Research Inc. Oligonucleotides were purified to greater than 97% purity as determined by RP-HPLC. siRNAs for<br>
mouse injection were purchased from Qiagen, which were HPLC purified after annealing with acceptable endotoxin<br>
level for in vivo injection.<br>
Transfection Procedure<br>
On the first day of the procedure, saturated 9L/LacZ cultures are taken from T75 flasks, and the cells are<br>
detached and diluted into 10ml of complete medium (DMEM, IxPS, IxNa Pyruvate, Ix NEAA). The cells are further<br>
diluted to 1:15, and lOOul of this preparation are aliquoted into wells of 96 well plates, which will generally yield<br>
about 50% cell confluence by the next day for the transfection. Edges of the wells are left empty and filled with 250 ul<br>
water, and the plates are placed un-stacked in the incubator overnight at 37°C (5% CO2 incubator).<br>
On the second day, the transfection complex is prepared in Opti-MEM, 50ul each well. The medium is<br>
removed from the plates, and the wells are washed once with 200ul PBS or Opti-MEM. The plates are blotted and<br>
dried completely with tissue by inversion. The transfection mixture is then added (50ul/well) into each well, and<br>
250ul water is added to the wells on the edge to prevent them from drying. The cells are then incubated for at least 3<br>
hours at 37°C (5% CO2 incubator). The transfection mixture is removed and replaced with lOOul of complete medium<br>
(DMEM, IxPS, IxNa Pyruvate, Ix NEAA). The cells are cultured for a defined length of time, and then harvested for<br>
the enzyme assay.<br>
The siRNA sequence used to silence the beta-galactosidase mRNA was the following:<br>
C.U.A.C.A.C.A.A.A.U.C.A.G.C.G.A.U.U.U.dT.dT (Sense) (SEQ ID NO: 32)<br>
A.A.A.U.C.G.C.U.G.A.U.U.U.G.U.G.U.A.G.dT.dT (Antisense) (SEQ ID NO: 33)<br>
The data for the present example is shown in Table 2. The transfection efficiency inversely correlates<br>
with the amount of beta-galactosidase activity measured from the cell lysate. Upon transfection, a measured<br>
decrease in beta-galactosidase activity indicates a successful transfection. Thus, in the absence of transfection, the<br>
measured beta-galactosidase activity is 100% and the transfection efficiency is 0%. As beta-galactosidase<br>
activity decreases, the transfection efficiency increases. For example, in Table 2, Histone H2B plus siRNA<br>
results in a transfection efficiency of 62.03% indicating that the measured beta-galactosidase activity decreased to<br>
37.97%. The same approach for determining transfection efficiency was used for the data presented in Table 3.<br>
To evaluate the effects of adding a cationic lipid to a siRNA/polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptide<br>
mixture, complex or conjugate, the above procedures were followed except the lipofectamine (Invitrogen) was added<br>
to siRNA/polynucleotide delivery formulation in constant concentrations, following manufacturer's instructions (0 2<br>
ul/lOOulOpti-MEM).<br>
To produce the composition comprised of GKINLKALAALAKKIL (SEQ ID NO: 28), siRNA and<br>
LIPOFECTIN® (Invitrogen), the siRNA and peptide were mixed together first in Opti-MEM cell culture medium at<br>
room temperature, after which LIPOFECTIN® was added at room temperature to the mixture to form the<br>
siRNA/peptide/cationic lipid composition.<br>
To produce the composition comprised of RVIRVWFQNKRCKDKK (SEQ ID NO: 29), siRNA and<br>
LIPOFECTIN*, the peptide and the LIPOFECTIN® were mixed together first in Opti-MEM cell culture medium, into<br>
this mixture was added the siRNA to form the siRNA/peptide/LIPOFECTIN® composition<br>
To produce the siRNA/peptide/cationic lipid composition using<br>
GRKKRRQRRRPPQGRKKRRQRRRPPQGRKKRRQRRRPPQ (SEQ ID NO: 30) or<br>
GEQIAQLIAGYIDIILKKKKSK (SEQ ID NO: 31) it does not matter in which order the components are added<br>
together to produce the siRNA/peptide/cationic lipid composition.<br>
To produce the siRNA/mellitin/LIPOFECTIN®, the siRNA and mellitin were first mixed together in Opti-<br>
MEM cell culture medium and then the LIPOFECTIN® was added to the mixture.<br>
To produce the siRNA/histone HI /LIPOFECTIN® composition, the histone HI and LIPOFECTIN® were first<br>
added together in Opti-MEM cell culture medium thoroughly mixed and then the siRNA was added, thoroughly and<br>
mixed with the histone LIPOFECTIN® mixture to form the siRNA/histone HI/ LIPOFECTIN® composition.<br>
Based on the foregoing results, it is apparent that exemplary polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptides<br>
of the invention can substantially enhance cellular uptake of siRNAs, while the addition of an optional cationic lipid to<br>
certain siRNA/polypeptide mixtures of the invention may substantially improve siRNA delivery efficiency.<br>
Example 2<br>
Production and Characterization of Compositions Comprising a siRNA<br>
Conjugated With a TAT-HA Polynucleotide Delivery-Enhancing Polvpeptide<br>
The present example describes the synthesis and uptake activity of specific peptides covalently conjugated to<br>
one strand of a siRNA duplex. These conjugates efficiently deliver siRNA into the cytoplasm.<br>
Both peptides and RNAs are prepared using standard solid phase synthesis methods.<br>
To form conjugates, the peptide and RNA molecules must be functionalized with specific moieties to allow for<br>
covalent attachment to each other. For the peptide, the N-terminus is functionalized with 3-maleimidopropionic acid.<br>
For the RNA molecule the 5' end of the sense strand or 3' end of the antisense strand is functionalized with a l-Odimethoxytrityl-<br>
hexyl-disulfide linker using standard procedures.<br>
Structure of the peptide-siRNA conjugate (SEQ ID NOS 34 and 35)<br>
Cells were plated the day before so that they were ~50-80% confluent at time of transfection. For complexes,<br>
siRNA and peptide were diluted in Opti-MEM® media (Invitrogen), then mixed and allowed to complex 5-10 minutes<br>
before adding to cells washed with PBS. Final concentration of siRNA was SOOnM at each peptide concentration (2-<br>
SOM). The conjugate, also diluted in Opti-MEM® media, was added to cells at final concentrations ranging from<br>
62.5nM to SOOnM. At SOOnM concentration, we also combined with 20% FBS just before adding to washed cells.<br>
Cells were transfected for 3 hours at 37°C, 5%CO2. Cells were washed with PBS, treated with trypsin and then<br>
analyzed by flow cytometry. siRNA uptake was measured by intensity of Cy5 fluorescence and cellular viability<br>
assessed by addition of propidium iodide.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the peptide/siRNA conjugates achieve a greater percent uptake in mouse tail fibroblast<br>
cells than peptide/siRNA complexes. Further, the peptide/siRNA conjugates achieved a higher mean fluorescence<br>
intensity (MFI; Figure 2) than the peptide/siRNA complex. Thus, these data indicate that in certain embodiments it<br>
will be desirable to conjugate the polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptide to the siRNA molecule.<br>

described above, except that for the murine experiments, 9L/LacZ cells were replaced with mouse tail fibroblasts. The<br>

To further characterize the ability of polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptides to transfect cells in<br>
culture, human monocytes were incubated with FITC labeled siRNA complexed with various concentrations of PN73,<br>
PN250, PN182, PN58 and PN158. Human monocytes were used in addition to LacZ and mouse fibroblast cells<br>
because they are the targeted cell type in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
Monocytes were isolated from fresh human blood samples from healthy donors, to a purity greater than 95%<br>
by FACS analysis.<br>
Monocytes were transfected using procedures of Example 2 using Cy5- or FAM-conjugated siRNA and<br>
peptide, and siRNA uptake was measured by the intensity of intracellular Cy5 or FAM fluorescence. Cell viability was<br>
determined using propidium iodide (uptake) or AnnexinV-PE (staining).<br>
Figure 3 illustrates the ability of several different polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptides to enhance<br>
siRNA uptake in human monocytes in culture. Transfection by lipofectamine was used as a comparator. Cell viability<br>
was also assessed for each peptide. The results showed that the polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptide, PN73<br>
is an ideal candidate for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The data show the surprising and unexpected discovery<br>
that the PN73 peptide enhances uptake of siRNA by human monocytes with high efficiency and low toxicity indicating<br>
that suggests it can be used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in vivo.<br>

9 siRNA Gene Expression Knock Down is Enhanced by<br>
Polvnucleotide Delivery-Enhancing Polvpeptides Complexed to siRNA<br>
The instant example demonstrates effective knockdown of target gene expression by siRNA/polynucleotide<br>
delivery-enhancing polypeptide complexes of the invention. In the current studies, the ability of peptide/siRNA<br>
complexes to modulate expression of a human tumor necrosis factor-a (hTNF-a) gene, implicated as mediating the<br>
occurrence or progression of RA when overexpressed in human and other mammalian subjects, was tested.<br>
Human monocytes were isolated and transfected as described in Example 4. For mRNA measurement, branch<br>
DNA technology from Genospectra (CA) was used according to manufacturer's specification. Human monocytes<br>
(CD 14+) treated with LPS induce TNF-a-specific mRNA within approximately 2 hrs, followed by peak levels of TNFa<br>
protein 2 hrs later. siRNAs were screened for knockdown activity by transfecting monocytes with siRNA candidate<br>
sequences using Lipofectamine 2000, treating infected cells with LPS, and measuring TNF-a mRNA levels<br>
approximately 16 hrs later. Various siRNA sequences were screened (Table 9) for their ability to knockdown TNF-a<br>
mRNA and protein levels in activated human primary monocytes.<br>
To quantitate mRNA level in the cells, both house keeping gene (cypB) and target gene (TNF-a) mRNA were<br>
measured, and the reading for TNF- a was normalized with cypB to obtain relative luminescence unit. To quantify<br>
protein level, the TNF-a ELISA from BD Bioscience was used according to manufacturer's specification.<br>
Table 10, 11 and 12 illustrate the effectiveness of specific oligos complexed to a polynucleotide deliveryenhancing<br>
polypeptides of the invention to target and knock down TNF-a gene expression levels in human monocytes.<br>
Activities for a representative set of siRNA sequences ranged from 80% mRNA knockdown activity to no<br>
detectable activity. In general, TNF-a protein levels were reduced more than mRNA levels, e.g., a 50% knockdown in<br>
TNF-a mRNA (TNF-a-1) resulted in a 75% reduction in TNF-a protein level. Dose response curves for selected<br>
exhibited knockdown levels from 30% to 60 % were obtained. Calculated IC50values were in the 10<br>
olar to 200 pMolar range. While the siRNA sequences evaluated were distributed throughout the TNF-a transcript,<br>
the most potent siRNAs identified were located in two areas: the middle of the coding region and the 3'-UTR.<br>
The foregoing results (Tables 10, 11 and 12) evince that effective levels of TNF-a gene expression knock<br>
down can be achieved in mammalian cells using the novel siRNA/polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptide<br>
compositions of the invention.<br>
Example 7<br>
siRNA Gene Expression Knock Down is Enhanced by<br>
Polynucleotide Delivery-Enhancing Polypeptides Conjugated with siRNA<br>
The present example demonstrates knockdown of target gene expression by peptide-siRNA conjugates of the<br>
invention. The materials and methods for these studies are the same as those described above . The results of this<br>
example are illustrated in Table 13.<br>
The results show that a diverse assemblage of polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptides of the invention<br>
conjugated with siRNAs function to enhance siRNA-mediated knockdown of TNF- gene expression in mammalian<br>
subjects.<br>
Example 8<br>
Time Course of siRNA Gene Expression Knock Down<br>
 The instant example presents studies relating to the time course of siRNA-mediated gene expression<br>
Knockdown. To test the duration of the siRNA effect, the siRNA transfection procedures as noted above were<br>
employed, except that fibroblasts derived from eGFP expressing mice were used. The transfection reagent used here<br>
was lipofectamine. The cells were replated on the 18th day due to overgrowth. The second transfection was performed<br>
on the 19th day post first transfection. On the 19th day the eGFP levels were measured after the transfection. Scramble<br>
or nonsense siRNA (Qiagen) was used as a control, along with a GFPI siRNA (GFPI) and a hairpin siRNA (D#21).<br>
The knockdown activities were calibrated with scramble siRNA (Qiagen control)<br>
Table 14:<br>
Time Course of EGFP Gene Expression Knock Down by Lipofectamine Mediated Transfection <br>
The foregoing studies (Table 14) demonstrate that siRNA knockdown activity became apparent around day 3,<br>
and was sustained through day 9, whereafter target gene expression returned to baseline levels around day 17. After<br>
the second transfection on day 18, another reduction of eGFP expression occurred indicating that the reagent can be<br>
repeatedly administered to cells to yield repeated or enduring gene expression knockdown.<br>
Example 9<br>
Multiple Dosing Protocol to Extend siRNA Knockdown Effect in Mammalian Cells<br>
The instant example demonstrates that multiple dosing schedules will effectively extend gene expression<br>
knockdown effects in mammalian cells mediated by siRNA/polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptide<br>
compositions of the invention. The materials and methods employed for these studies are the same as described above,<br>
with the exception that repeated transfections were conducted at the times indicated. The scramble siRNA (Qiagen)<br>
was utilized for side by side controls. Table 15 summarizes the data for multiple transfections with a peptide/siRNA<br>
complex. The percent knockdown activity of the TNF-a gene represents the percent of total gene expression.<br>
The foregoing results demonstrate that when multiple transfections are performed timely (in this case between<br>
about the 5th-7th day post first transfection), TNF-a gene expression knockdown effects in mammalian cells can be<br>
maintained or re-induced.<br>
Example 10<br>
Optimizing Rational Design of Polvnucleotide Delivery-Enhancing Polvpeptides<br>
The instant example provides an exemplary design and data for optimizing polynucleotide delivery-enhancing<br>
polypeptides of the invention. The subject rational design manipulations were conducted for a histone H2B-derived<br>
polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptide.<br>
In order to better understand the function-structural activity relationships of this and other polynucleotide<br>
delivery-enhancing polypeptides, primary structural studies were performed by characterizing C- and N-terminal<br>
function, and activity of conjugates between PN73 and other chemical moieties.<br>
The amino acid sequence for the human histone 2B (H2B) protein is shown below.<br>
PN73, PN360 and PN361 are peptide fragments of H2B and the portion of the H2B protein that they represent are<br>
identified below in parentheses following the peptide name. The amino acids sequence for PN360 and PN361 listed<br>
below are aligned with the corresponding amino acid sequence found in PN73. The PN73 peptide fragment is<br>
underlined in the H2B amino acid sequence and represents H2B amino acids 13 through 48. It may also be represented<br>
by H2B amino acids 12 through 48. PN360 shares the N-terminus with PN73 but lacks PN73's C-terminus while<br>
PN361 shares the C-terminus with PN73 but lacks PN73's N-terminus. The PN73 conjugate is PN73 covalently linked<br>
to a single siRNA strand (e.g., sense strand). PN404 is a version of PN73 in which all of lysines are replaced with<br>
arginines and PN509 is a pegylated PN73 (PEG molecular weight Ik Dalton ) derivative that is pegylated at the Nterminus.<br>

Figure 5 provides the results of uptake efficacy and viability studies in mouse tail fibroblast cells for the<br>
foregoing PN73 rationally-designed derivative polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptides. The activity changes<br>
of modified PN73 in mouse tail fibroblast cells are illustrated. Unlike PN404, PN509 increases uptake without<br>
increasing toxicity. While deleting part of the N-terminus of PN73 reduces activity, removal of C-terminal residues<br>
abolishes the activity. Both PN73 and PN509 show higher activity in primary cells than Lipofectamine (Invitrogen,<br>
Example 11<br>
Acetylated Polynucleotide Delivery-Enhancing Polypeptide Increases siRNA Stability<br>
The purpose of the instant example was to determine if modification of the exemplary polynucleotide deliveryenhancing<br>
polypeptide PN73 would provide increased stability to the peptide and consequently enhance its transfection<br>
activity. The stability of unmodified, N-terminus pegylated and N-terminus acetylated forms of PN73 in plasma was<br>
compared. The C-terminus of the PN73 is amidated. Size exclusion chromatography coupled with an ultraviolet<br>
detector were used to characterize the stability of the unmodified and modified forms of PN73 before and after<br>
incubation in plasma.<br>
In the absence of plasma, the unmodified, pegylated and acetylated forms of PN73 showed distinct yet<br>
overlapping UV traces at approximately 9 minutes. However, after 4 hours of exposure to plasma, UV traces specific<br>
to unmodified PN73 and pegylated PN73 were no longer present indicating significant degradation. In contrast, the<br>
distinct UV trace for acetylated PN73 remained indicating that this modification significantly increased stability of the<br>
PN73 in plasmid compared to the unmodified and pegylated PN73 forms.<br>
These data show the surprisingly and unexpected discovery that PN73 stability in plasma can be enhanced by<br>
N-terminus acetylation of the PN73 peptide. The primary structure of the acetylated PN73 peptide is as follows:<br>

Example 14<br>
Polynucleotide Delivery-Enhancing Polvpeptide Does Not Elicit an Interferon Response<br>
The purpose of the instant example was to compare the interferon response of cells transfected with either<br>
lipofectamine plus siRNA or the exemplary polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptide, PN73 peptide plus siRNA.<br>
Interferon responsiveness was assayed by ELISA (protein) and bDNA (mRNA levels).<br>
Traditionally, siRNA molecules are delivered into cells by a liposomal mediated transfection. However, this<br>
typically results in a poor efficiency of delivery, an inflammatory response in vivo and an upregulation of interferon<br>
gene expression which results in an inhibition of cell growth. Consequently, there is a limited reduction in targeted<br>
gene expression levels thus making siRNA an ineffective method of treatment and tool for studying gene expression.<br>
Delivery of siRNA by PN73 overcomes this problem.<br>
Interferon responsiveness of lipofectamine was compared to PN73 peptide in transfection of several different<br>
siRNAs. siRNAs were complexed with either lipofectamine or PN73 at concentrations of 1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM or<br>
200 nM. Interleukin ip (IL-1P) served as a molecular marker to determine interferon responsiveness and Qneg was<br>
used as a negative control. Results showed that lipofectamine complexed with the 100 nM or 200 nM TNF-a9 siRNA<br>
caused a significant increase in IL-lp mRNA levels. Furthermore, all other siRNAs tested caused a mild increase in<br>
IL-lp mRNA levels. In contrast, the same siRNAs complexed with the PN73 peptide did not cause an increase in IL-<br>
1P mRNA levels.<br>
To further characterize the difference in interferon responsiveness observed between cells transfected with<br>
either lipofectamine and PN73 transfection, an ELISA assay was performed to determine the protein expression levels<br>
of the following molecular markers: Interleukin ip (IL-lp), Interferon-ct (INF-ct), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-8<br>
(IL-8), Interleukin-12 (IL-12), MEP-la, Interferon-y (IFN-y), and Tumor Necrosis Factor-a (TNF-a). Table 16<br>
summarizes the relative protein expression levels of cells transfected with lipofectamine complexed with siRNA or<br>
PN73 complexed with siRNA.<br>
The results showed both siRNA LC20 and LCI7 had no interferon response regardless of what transfection<br>
rfttgent was used. However, transfection of EFN-1 or TNF-a9 with lipofectamine caused an increase in IL-1J3, IL-6,<br>
and MlP-la, protein expression levels. In contrast, transfection of all tested siRNAs with PN73 caused no observable<br>
induction in protein expression in any of the interferon response markers tested.<br>
These data from the ELISA assay show the surprisingly and unexpected discovery that PN73 mediated<br>
transfection of siRNAs does not elicit an interferon response.<br>
Example 15<br>
siRNA Conjugated with a Polvnucleotide Delivery-Enhancing Polypeptide Provides Greater Knockdown<br>
Activity than siRNA Complexed with Polynucleotide Delivery-Enhancing Polypeptide.<br>
The purpose of the instant example was to compare the knockdown activities in human monocytes of the<br>
siRNAs LCI3 and LC20 either conjugated or complexed with the exemplary polynucleotide delivery-enhancing<br>
polypeptide PN73. Isolation and transfection of human monocytes as well as the methods used to measure knockdown<br>
activity were discussed earlier. Qneg represents a random siRNA sequence and functions as the negative control in<br>
these experiments. The observed Qneg knockdown activity is normalized to 100% (100% gene expression levels) and<br>
the activity of LC20 and LCI3 is presented as a relative percentage of the negative control. LC20 and LCI3 are<br>
siRNAs targeted against the human TNF-a gene. The knockdown activity for the siRNAs LC20 and LCI3 without<br>
PN73, in a complex with PN73 or conjugated with PN73 were tested over a concentration range of 0 nM to 2.5 nM.<br>
PN73 was kept at a 1:1 ratio in both the complex and conjugate experiments.<br>
In the absence of PN73, LCI3 and L20 showed little knockdown activity (Figure 6-C). Both LCI3 and LC20<br>
caused an approximate 15% and 30% decrease in TNF-a gene expression relative to the Qneg control when<br>
complexed with PN73 (Figure 6-B). However, knockdown activity for TNF-a was reduced to below 60% when the<br>
siRNA was conjugated to PN73 (Figure 6-A). This is significant increase the siRNA knockdown activity compared to<br>
the PN73/siRNA complex. Thus, these data show the surprisingly and unexpected discovery that siRNA knockdown<br>
activity is significantly enhanced when the siRNA is conjugated to the exemplary polynucleotide delivery-enhancing<br>
polypeptide PN73.<br>

Deletion Analysis of the Exemplary Polynucleotide Delivery-Enhancing Polypeptide<br>
The purpose of the present example was to determine the minimum length of the<br>
PN73 peptide that is critical for its ability to enhance the delivery of small and macromolecules into cells. A shown in<br>
Table 17,10 truncated forms of PN73 were created by sequentially deleting 3 residues at a time from the N-terminus<br>
of the peptide. Below is an explanation of the primary structure of PN73 and the truncated forms that will be<br>
examined for transfection activity. All peptides tested in this Example were tagged with a C-terminus FITC<br>
(fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate) label (i.e., -GK[EPSILON]G-amide).<br>

In Vivo siRNA-Mediated Gene Expression Knock Down Activity<br>
A. eGFP mice<br>
r 37-<br>
eGFP transgenic mice, 20-25g body weight, were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. For siRNA injections,<br>
was used at a dose of 5mg/kg at a 1:5 ratio of siRNA/PN73. All treatments were by tail vein injections once<br>
daily for three days. The tissues were clollected on day 4. The experimental protocols were performed at R&amp;R<br>
Rabbitary (Standwood, WA) and approved by their Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).<br>
The tissues from animal were placed in PBS immediately and stored on ice. For isolation cells from tissues,<br>
the sample tissues were placed between 2 frosted glass microscope slides with frosted side facing tissue. Smear<br>
together to mash tissue several times. Then rinse off the smashed tissue from slides into the well of 12-well plate with<br>
PBS. One ml of mashed tissue was transferred to 12-well plate containing 1 ml of 2X collagenase (type I for muscle<br>
and II for liver tissue); the final concentration is 100 units/ml. Incubation of tissues in collagenase solution for 3 hours<br>
at 37°C; In order to remove the small pieces and connective tissue, filter the digested tissue mixture through cell<br>
strainer into 6 well plate. Transfer 500 ul cells into labeled FACS tubes. Fluorescence intensity of the isolated cells<br>
was determined by flow cytometry.<br>

either in PBS buffer or saline or glucose buffer.<br>
The three groups of animals (specific eGFP siRNA alone, peptide/eGFP siRNA complex and control<br>
siRNA/peptide complex) were iv injected in varied doses and durations as indicated in Table 1. The peripheral blood<br>
of treated mice was drawn through orbital bleeding and stored on ice in the presence of anticoagulant. The PBMC<br>
were isolated by Ficoll based centrifugation method. And the knockdown activities were assessed by determining the<br>
eGFP fluorescent intensity in the cells by flow cytometry<br>
Reduction of eGFP protein in muscle cells in EGFP transgenic animal<br>
Transgenic mice were treated with siRNA in eGFP transgenic mouse complexed with peptide PN73 (1:5 ratio)<br>
(5 mg/kg for three days). For determination of the knockdown activities, cells were isolated from muscle tissue<br>
following treatment with collagenase as mentioned in methods section. The fluorescence intensity of isolated cells<br>
were analyzed by flow cytomethry.<br>
In comparison with control siRNA and GFP siRNA alone, GFP siRNA/PN509 (pegylated PN73) complex<br>
showed effective knockdown of EGFP in vivo after consecutive three day injections.<br>
Reduction of eGFP protein and niRNA in liver cells in EGFP transgenic animal<br>
Transgenic mice were treated with siRNA in eGFP transgenic mouse complexed with peptide PN73 (1:5 ratio)<br>
(5 mg/kg for three days). For determination of the knockdown activities, cells were isolated from liver tissue following<br>
treatment with collagenase as mentioned in methods section. The fluorescence intensity of isolated cells were<br>
analyzed by flow cytomethry.<br>
In comparison with control siRNA/PN602 and GFP siRNA alone, GFP siRNA/PN509 (pegylated PN73)<br>
complex showed effective knockdown of EGFP in vivo after consecutive three day injections. Knockdown of eGFP<br>
mRNA are here summarized in Table 18.. Knockdown of protein expression is comparable.<br>
The delivery peptide can efficiently delivery siRNA and knockdown eGFP in PBMC in vivo (up to 50%). In<br>
comparison with negative control, naked siRNA also showed some activity in knocking down of eGFP, but it is much<br>
less efficient.<br>
B. Taconic Mice<br>
For human TNF-a animal disease models, two transgenic models were used. The tg!97 mice were acquired<br>
from Pasteur Hellenic Institute (Athens, Greece), and the B6.SJL-Tg(TNF) N21 mice were purchased from Taconic,<br>
Inc. (Germantown, NY). The genotypes of both human TNF-a transgenic mouse models were performed by suppliers.<br>
For tg!97 mice, 6-week old mice were divided into three treatment groups for infliximab, siRNA/PN73 complex and<br>
saline. Infliximab, a TNF-a neutralizing antibody based drug, was purchased from a local drug store (as Remicade)<br>
and used at a dose of 10 mg/kg, once per week. siRNA was used at a dose of 2mg/kg at a 1:5 ratio of siRNA/PN73.<br>
All treatments were by tail vein injection twice a week. The experimental protocols were performed at SkeleTech Inc.<br>
(Bothell, WA) and approved by their Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). A similar dose regimen<br>
was used for B6.SJL-Tg(TNF) N21 mice. Clinical scores were based on a previously described scoring system (2, 3)<br>
as follows: 0 (normal), 1 (edema or distortion of paw or ankle joints), 2 (distortion of paw and ankle joints), or 3<br>
(ankylosis of wrist or ankle joints). The sum of all four paws was scored twice a week with a maximum score of 12<br>
per mouse.<br>
For determination of TNF-a level, For the analysis of experiments involving transgenic mice, plasma samples<br>
were separated from whole blood collected by orbital bleeding. Plasma levels of hTNF-a were determined by ELISA<br>
at a 1:2 dilution according to the manufacturer's instructions (R&amp;D systems, Minneapolis, MN).<br>
bDNA assays (Quantigene assay from Genospectra, Fremont, CA) were performed following the<br>
manufacturer's instructions.<br>
Reduction of human TNF-a plasma protein level and RA scores in transgenic mice after treatment with<br>
siRNA/PN73 complex or infliximab.<br>
Human TNF-a transgenic mice were treated starting on 5 weeks of age with infliximab (10|xg/kg, ip injection)<br>
and siRNA (LC20) against TNF-a complexed with peptide PN73 (1:5 ratio) (2 mg/kg, iv injection, twice weekly). For<br>
Hellenic transgenic mice, RA scores were determined (blinded to treatment) using the following criteria: 0, normal; 1,<br>
edema or distortion of paw or ankle joints; 2 distortion of paw and ankle joints; 3, ankylosis of wrist or ankle joints.<br>
The LC20/PN73 treated group show dramatic suppression of clinic progressions of joint arthritis during three<br>
week treatment period.<br>
Reduction of human TNF-a plasma protein level after treatment with siRNA/PN73 complex or<br>
infliximab<br>
For Taconic mice, TNF-a levels in plasma were determined by ELISA (R&amp;D systems, Minneapolis, MN) and<br>
treatment schedules were same as Hellenic transgenic hTNF-a transgenic mice.<br>
C. Helenic Mice<br>
The present example provides in vivo data demonstrating the efficacy of siRNA/polynucleotide deliveryenhancing<br>
polypeptide compositions of the invention to mediate systemic delivery and therapeutic gene knockdown by<br>
siRNA, effective to modulate target gene expression and modify phenotype of cells in a therapeutic manner.<br>
Human NF-a expressing mice were purchase from the Hellenic Pasture Institute, Greece) at 5weeks old. Mice<br>
were administered through intra venous (IV) with 300ul saline twice a week (4 mice), with the RA drug Ramicade<br>
(5mg/kg) once a week (2 mice), or with LC20 siRNA (2mg/kg) mixed with PN73 at 1:5 molar ratio twice a week (2<br>
mice). During the injection periods, plasma samples were collected for ELISA testing (R&amp;D Systems,<br>
Cat#SSTAOOC), and paw scores were taken twice a week as an accepted index of RA disease progression and<br>
therapeutic efficacy (Table 19).<br>
The foregoing results demonstrate effective reduction of TNF-a protein levels in peptide/siRNA-treated mice<br>
ill the circulating blood as compared to levels in Ramicade or saline (control) treated mice.<br>
Additional evidence of in vivo efficacy of the siRNA/polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptide<br>
compositions and methods of the invention were obtained from the above murine subjects using paw scores, an<br>
accepted phenotypic index for RA disease status and treatment efficacy. Due to the difference in the starting point<br>
(some animals present with scores at earlier points), the scores have been adjusted to 0 for all animals in the<br>
experiments. Each paw is given a score between 0 and 3, with the highest score of 12, according to the following<br>
scoring index.<br>
0: Normal<br>
1: edema or distortion of paw or ankle joints<br>
2: distortion of paw and ankle joints<br>
3: ankylosis of wrist or ankle joints.<br>
The results of these paw score evaluations are presented graphically in Figure 4. The data demonstrate that the<br>
polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptide PN73 can deliver therapeutic amounts of siRNAs (e.g. LC20, TNF-a2,<br>
and TNF-a9 (UAGCCCAUGUUGUAGCAAA (SEQ ID NO. 175))) when injected into animals as shown by a<br>
delayed RA progression at week 8. The PN73/siRNA treated mice faired better on the paw scoring index at week 8<br>
compared to the Ramicade-treated mice. When paw score evaluations were carried out to 11 weeks post-treatment,<br>
PN73/LC20 complex achieved comparable paw score evaluations to the Ramicade-treated mice. At a ratio of 1:5 for<br>
the PN73 peptide/LC20 siRNA, 2 mg/kg LC20 achieved the greatest relative observed delay in RA progression<br>
compared to the lower doses of LC20 tested. Table 20 below summarizes the relative effectiveness of several siRNAs<br>
for 5 different groups evaluated after treatment with PN73 and siRNAs.<br>
exes<br>
LC20, YC12 and LC17 Overall low paw score.<br>
YC12 and LC17 not as<br>
effective as LC20<br>
LC20,<br>
a9<br>
TNF-a2 and TNF- LC20 and TNF-a9 are more<br>
effective than Ramicade by<br>
week 8; LC20 is equally<br>
effective as Ramicade by<br>
week 11<br>
'siRNAs were tested in the presence of absence ofPN73; Ramicade is a positive treatment control; PBS is a negative<br>
treatment control.<br>
The foregoing results demonstrate that siRNA and polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptide<br>
compositions of the invention provide promising new therapeutic tools for regulating gene expression and treating and<br>
managing disease. siRNAs of the invention, for example siRNAs targeting human TNF-a-specific mRNAs for<br>
degradation, offer higher specificity, lower immunogenicity and greater disease modification than current small<br>
molecule, soluble receptor, or antibody therapies for RA. More than 50 candidate siRNA sequences were screened<br>
that targeted hTNF-a and yielded single administration knockdowns of 30-85%. Over 20 in silica designed peptide<br>
complex and/or covalent molecules were compared for fluorescent RNA uptake by monocytes and a number were<br>
found to have significantly better uptake than Lipofectamine or cholesterol-conjugated siRNA and with  10 pM IC50<br>
values. The peptide-siRNA formulations efficiently knockdown TNF-a mRNA and protein levels in activated human<br>
monocytes in vitro.<br>
One exemplary candidate delivery peptide/siRNA formulation was evaluated in two transgenic mouse models<br>
or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) constitutively expressing human TNF-a. Animals treated with 2 mg/kg siRNA by FV<br>
injection or infliximab twice weekly beginning at age 6 weeks showed RA score stabilization (paw and joint<br>
inflammation) beginning at age 7 weeks, compared to controls where these disease conditions persisted through week<br>
10. At age 9 weeks, siRNA treated animals showed comparable reductions in RA scores, but significantly lower<br>
plasma TNF-a protein levels than infliximab treated animals.<br>
Based on the disclosure herein, the use of siRNA to inhibit the expression of target genes, for example<br>
cytokines such as TNF-a, that play important roles in pathological states, such as inflammation, provides effective<br>
treatments to alleviate or prevent symptoms of disease, as exemplified by RA, in mammalian subjects. Exemplary<br>
peptide/siRNA compositions employed within the methods and compositions of the invention provide advantages<br>
relating to their ability to reduce or eliminate target gene expression, e.g., TNF-a expression, rather than by<br>
complexing with the product of the target gene, e.g., TNF-a, as in the case of antibodies or soluble receptors.<br>
Improving systemic delivery of nucleic acids according to the teachings of the invention provides yet<br>
additional advantages for development of siRNAs as drugs. Specific challenges in this context include delivery<br>
through tissue barriers to a target cell or tissue, maintaining the stability of the siRNA, and intracellular delivery<br>
getting siRNAs across cell membranes into cells in sufficient quantities to be effective. The present disclosure<br>
demonstrates for the first time an effective in vivo delivery system comprising novel peptide/siRNA compositions<br>
targeting specific gene expression, such as expression of human TNF-a, which attenuate disease activity in transgenic<br>
animal models predictive of target diseases, as exemplified by studies using murine models of RA. In related studies,<br>
the compositions and methods of the invention effectively inhibit TNF-a expression in activated monocytes derived<br>
from patients with RA. These results indicate that the RNAi pathway effectively mediates alteration of cellular<br>
phenotype and disease progression through intracellular effects on TNF-pathways, and avoids toxicity effects due to<br>
circulating antibody/TNF-a complexes with residual immunoreactivity that characterize current antibody therapies for<br>
RA. Notably, all of the tests herein were implemented with associated toxicity effects minimized, such that the<br>
dosages of siNAs and polynucleotide delivery-enhancing polypeptides shown in these examples always correlated with<br>
cell viability levels of at least 80-90% or greater.<br>
D. Mouse LPS Response<br>
Normal [mouse type] mice were treated with various concentrations of LPS by intraperitoneal or intravenous<br>
injections. LPS responsiveness was determined by measuring levels of TNF-a in blood that was sampled various<br>
times following the LPS injection. A linear range of TNF-a induction was found between 10 ng and 100 ng for LPS<br>
injection by IP administration and up to 25 ng by IV injection. The average time for maximal TNF-a induction is 70<br>
minutes following LPS injection. On the basis of these results, the following LPS doses were selected for further<br>
experimentation: 25 ng for IP administration; 10 ng for IV administration.<br>
The effects of siRNA on LPS induction of TNF-a were tested by injection, six mice per treatment schedule,<br>
with a 2 mg/kg siRNA dose of (1) LC13/PN73; (2) LC13 alone; (3) Qneg/PN73; (4) PN73; (5) buffer alone. The LPS<br>
induction was performed 24 hr following the last siRNA injection, 0.2 ug LPS and blood was collected at 90 minutes<br>
following LPS injection. Results (below) indicate that LCI3 (samples 1 and 2) lowered amounts of circulating TNF-a<br>
resulting from LPS induction compared to negative controls (samples 3-5).<br>
A second experimental approach was utilized using a 2 mg/kg siRNA dose of the following compositions (1)<br>
LC13/PN73; (2) Inm-2/PN73; (3) Inm-4/PN73; (4) Qneg/PN73; and (5) PBS (Buffer control). Three studies of 30<br>
animals each dosing by the following schedules: 4 consecutive days; 8 consecutive days; and 11 consecutive days.<br>
LPS induction was performed at 24 hr post siRNA injection, 25 ng LPS (IP). Blood was drawn 70 minutes following<br>
LPS injection. The results showed that Inm-4 showed greatest KD activity in 4 consecutive day experiment (n=l test)<br>
compared to LCI3, Inm-2, and Qneg. Results from measurements and 8 and 11 days gave variable results owing to<br>
technical problems partly arising from repeated tail injections.<br>
