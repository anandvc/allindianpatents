DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
A cutting arrangement 10 for a continuous mining machine (not shown) includes a pick holder 12 having a bore 14 containing a sleeve 16 within which a shank 18 of a pick 20 is located. The pick 20 and the sleeve 16 have heads 22 and 24 respectively.<br>
The head 24 of the sleeve 16 has an outer surface 26 which abuts a surface 28 of the head 22 of the pick 20. Part of these abutting surfaces 26 and 28 have a concave formation 26.1 and a convex formation 28.1 which abut one another. In addition the abutting surfaces 26 and 28 have planar surfaces 27 and 29 which abut one another (see figures 3 and 4).<br>
Likewise an inner surface 30 of the head 24 of the sleeve 16 and an outer surface 32 of the pick holder 12 have a convex formation 30.1 and a concave formation 32.1 which abut one another. In addition to the abutting convex and concave formations, the inner surface 30 has a planar surface 33 which abuts a planar surface 35 on the pick holder 12 (see figures 4 and 5).<br>
Figures 3 to 5 show the convex and concave formations and their radiuses of curvature.<br>
The thickness of the sleeve 16, indicated by reference numeral 34, is 7mm, and the thinnest part of the pick holder 12 surrounding the sleeve 16, indicated by reference numeral 36, is 22mm.<br><br><br>
WO 00/34626<br>
The sleeve 16 is a sliding fit within the bore 14 of the pick holder 12. Likewise the shank 18 of the pick is a sliding fit within the sleeve 16.  Thus the sleeve 16 can rotate relative to the pick holder 12, and the pick 20 can rotate relative to the sleeve 16.<br>
Referring now to figures 6 to 9 a cutting arrangement for a mining machine (not shown) includes a pick 10.1 which has a head 12.1 and a shank 14.1 extending from the head 12.1. The head 12.1 has an abutting surface 16.1 which abuts an abutting surface 18.1 of a pick holder 20.1. The abutting surface 16.1 of the head 12.1 has a circumferentially extending convex formation 22.1. The convex formation 22.1 abuts a circumferentially extending complimentary concave formation 24.1 on the abutting surface 18.1 of the pick holder 20.1.<br>
The abutting surface 16.1 of the head 12.1 also has a circumferentially extending planar surface 26.1 which abuts a circumferentially extending planar surface 28.1 on the abutting surface 18.1 of the pick holder.<br>
The convex formation 22.1 has a radius of curvature 28.2 with its centre 30.1 located inwardly of the head 12.1. The concave formation 24.1 has a radius of curvature which is substantially the same as the radius of curvature 28.2.<br>
The pick 12.1 is rotatable within the pick holder 20.1<br>
Referring now to figures 10 and 11, a cutting arrangement 10.2 for a continuous mining machine (not shown) is the same as that shown in figures 1 to 3 except that the shank 18 has 45° step formation 28.3 at which its diameter decreases. The sleeve 16 has a bore 31 which has a corresponding step formation at which the diameter of the bore 31 decreases.<br>
*<br><br>
WO 00/34626<br>
A clip 32.2 retains the pick 20 within the pick holder 12. If the head 22 of the pick, which head includes the convex formation 28.1, is severed from the shank 18, the step formations on the shank and the bore 31 retain the sleeve 16 and the shank 18 within the pick holder 12 thereby preventing the loss of the sleeve 16. The clip 32.2 is removably located on the pick 20.<br>
The step formation 28.3 is inclined at 45° and reduces the diameter of the shank by 2mm.<br>
Referring now to figures 12 to 14, a sleeve 16.2 has a tail 38 which abuts a step 40 in the bore of the pick holder 12.2. The tail 38 has a concave formation 42 with a radius of curvature of 3,1mm which abuts a convex formation 44 on the step 40. The convex formation 44 has a radius of curvature of 3,0mm.<br>
Referring now to figures 15 and 16, a sleeve 16.3 is the same as sleeve 16.2 except that it does not have a convex formation on its abutting surface 26. The whole of the abutting surface 26 is planar. In addition, the bore of the sleeve 16.3 has a groove 46 for a clip 48 of a prior art pick 50. The prior art pick 50 has a planar surface 52 which abuts the planar surface 26 of the sleeve 16.3. Thus the sleeve 16.3 can be used as an adaptor in the pick holder 12.2 for a prior art pick 50.<br>
The applicant believes that the life of a cutting arrangement according to the invention will be increased over the prior art arrangements. The reason for this is that the abutting convex and concave formations result in an increased contact area or load bearing area. The increased contact area between the abutting convex and concave formations decreases the pressure on the abutting surfaces and acts as a bearing between the abutting surfaces. The applicant also believes that the convex and concave formations will improve<br><br>
I<br><br>
WO 00/34626<br>
the rotatability of the pick within the sleeve or pick holder, and improve the rotatability of the sleeve within the bore of the pick holder because of the reduced pressure. Furthermore, the applicant believes that the convex and concave formations improve the seal between the abutting surfaces, thereby at least reducing the penetration of particulate material between the abutting surfaces. Since the sleeve is a sliding fit, and not an interference fit within the pick holder, the sleeve can easily be removed from the pick holder if it is desired to replace the sleeve.<br><br>
It will be appreciated that many modifications or improvements of the invention are possible without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Although the invention has been described with reference to convex formations and concave formations, these formations can broadly be described as outwardly curved formations and inwardly curved formations respectively.<br><br><br>
