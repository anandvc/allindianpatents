The present invention relates to latices comprising two populations of particles of polymers based on vinyl chloride, their preparation and use in the manufacture of fluid plastisols which are stable on storage.<br>
Bipopulated latices of particles of polymers based on vinyl chloride, respectively exhibiting mean diameters of between 0.4 and 2.5 join, and between 0.08 and 1 fim,   in a ratio of the diameters of between 1 and 20 and a ratio by weight of between 0.1 and 10, are known (French Patent Specification 2 309 569). In the examples which illustrate the invention, these latices are prepared by seeded microsuspension polymerization in the presence of a first seeding polymer, the particles of which contain at least one organosoluble initiator and have a mean diameter of at most 0.48 /xm.<br>
Moreover, a process for producing a latex of polymers based on vinyl chloride, capable of giving fluid plastisols which are stable on storage, is described in Japanese Patent Specification JP-A-6 107 711. This process is characterized in that the seeded microsuspension polymerization is carried out in the presence of a specific surface-active agent, such as, for example, nonylpropenylphenol(ethylene oxide) 20.<br>
Plastisols comprising polymers based on vinyl chloride having a low viscosity and exhibiting good stability on storage are much sought after. They have<br><br>
numerous applications in coating and in the manufacture of moulded articles. Their low viscosity makes them easier to use and also makes it possible vto increase the productivity during conversion.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a latex containing two populations of particles of polymers based on vinyl chloride, one population having a mean diameter of between 1.2 and 2 /xm and one population having a mean diameter of between 0.15 and 0.3 0 /mi, in proportions such that the ratio by weight of the population with the lesser mean diameter to that with the greater mean diameter is between 0.1 and 0.3. The powder resulting from the atomization of this latex, optionally followed by milling, is very particularly suitable for the manufacture of fluid plastisols which are stable on storage.<br>
Polymers based on vinyl chloride is understood to mean homo- and copolymers, the latter containing at least 50% by weight of vinyl chloride and at least one monomer which is capable of copolymerizing with vinyl chloride. The copolymerizable monomers are those generally employed in conventional techniques for the copolymerization of vinyl chloride. Mention may be made of vinyl esters of mono- and polycarboxylic acids, such as vinyl acetate, propionate or benzoate; unsaturated mono- and polycarboxylic acids, such as acrylic, methacrylic, maleic, fumaric and itaconic<br><br>
acids, and their aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic esters, their amides or their nitriles; alkyl, vinyl or vinylidene halides; alkyl vinyl ethers and olefins.<br>
The preferred polymers based on vinyl chloride are vinyl chloride homopolymers.<br>
The latex according to the present invention can be obtained by seeded microsuspension polymerization of the corresponding monomer or monomers in the presence of a first seeding polymer (PI), the particles of which contain at least one organosoluble initiator, of a second seeding polymer (P2), the particles of which have a mean diameter less than that of the particles of the first seeding polymer (PI), of water, of an anionic emulsifier, of a soluble metal salt and of a reducing agent.<br>
According to one aspect, this process is characterized in that the mean diameter of the particles of the first seeding polymer (PI) is between 0 . 6 and 0 . 9 /xm â€¢<br>
The first seeding polymer (PI) necessary for the polymerization can be prepared according to conventional microsuspension polymerization techniques, such as that described in French Patent Specification 2 3 09 569, but the time for dispersion of the monomer or monomers is less than that commonly used. It is then used in the form of an aqueous dispersion of its particles.<br>
The organosoluble initiators to be employed<br><br>
in the preparation of the first seeding polymer (PI) are represented by organic peroxides, such as lauroyl, decanoyl and caproyl peroxides-} tert-but^l diethylperacetate, diethylhexyl percarbonate, diacetyl peroxide and dicetyl peroxide carbonate.<br>
Lauroyl peroxide is advantageously chosen.<br>
In the case where a number of organosoluble initiators are employed, it is advantageous to choose them with different reactivities; the most reactive initiators act mainly during the preparation of the seeding polymer, whereas the least reactive initiators act in particular during the seeded polymerization.<br>
The second seeding polymer (P2) is provided in the form of an aqueous dispersion of its particles, the mean diameter of which is preferably between 0.1 and 0.14 fxm.<br>
This particle dispersion can be obtained by conventional microsuspension or emulsion polymerization techniques.<br>
When the second seeding polymer (P2) is prepared by microsuspension polymerization, the preparation is suitably carried out as described above but the homogenization is more developed.<br>
The second seeding polymer (P2) is preferably prepared by emulsion polymerization, which comprises making use of water, vinyl chloride, alone or in combination with one or more copolymerizable monomer(s), a water-soluble initiator and an anionic<br><br>
emulsifier, optionally in combination with a non-ionic emulsifier.<br>
The reaction mixture is heated under autogenous pressure and moderate stirring at a temperature of between 30 and 65Â°C. After fall in pressure, the reaction is halted and the unconverted monomer or monomers are degassed.<br>
The water-soluble initiators used for the preparation of the second seeding polymer (P2) are generally represented by hydrogen peroxide or alkali metal or ammonium persulphates, optionally in combination with water-soluble reducing agents, such as alkali metal sulphites or bisulphites. The highly variable amounts used depend on the initiator system chosen and are just sufficient to provide for the polymerization within reasonable times.<br>
The reducing agents can be chosen from alkyl hydrogen phosphates, lactones, ketones, carbazones, alkali metal metabisulphites and mono- or polycarboxylic acids, such as ascorbic acid and its derivatives. The amount of reducing agent used is preferably between 30 and 120 ppm with respect to the monomer(s) involved. Ascorbic acid is advantageously chosen.<br>
In the process according to the present invention, the rate of polymerization is accelerated by the action of the water-soluble metal salt and of the reducing agent on the organosoluble initiator. The<br><br>
metal salt is employed in an amount such that the metal salt/initiator molar ratio is preferably between 0.001 and 0,1 and more particularly tetween O.tfOl and 0.03. The metal is generally chosen from iron, copper, cobalt, nickel, zinc, tin, titanium, vanadium, manganese, chromium and silver. Copper is advantageously chosen.<br>
The presence of the anionic emulsifier, optionally in combination with at least one non-ionic emulsifier, improves the stability of the microsuspension. The emulsifier or emulsifiers can be added to the reaction mixture before and/or after and/or during polymerization. The anionic emulsifiers are preferably chosen from alkaline alkyl phosphates, alkyl sulphosuccinates, allylsulphonates, vinylsulphonates, alkylarylsulphonates, alkylsulphonates, ethoxylated alkyl sulphates, alkyl sulphates or fatty acid soaps. The preferred non-ionic emulsifiers are polycondensates of ethylene or propylene oxide with various hydroxylated organic compounds.<br>
The total amount of emulsifier employed is preferably between 1 and 3% by weight of the monomer or monomers involved.<br>
The amount of water necessary for the polymerization according to the invention is such that the initial concentration of seeding polymers, plus the monomer or monomers involved, is between 20 and 80% and<br><br>
preferably between 45 and 75% by weight with respect to the reaction mixture.<br>
The seeded polymerization temperature is generally between 3 0 and 80Â°C and the duration of polymerization is between 30 minutes and 12 hours and preferably between 1 and 8 hours.<br>
According to another aspect of the preparation of the latex in accordance with the present invention a first seeding polymer (PI) is used, the particles of which contain at least 2.5% by weight of one or more organosoluble initiator(s)â€¢ In this case, the mean diameter of the polymer particles can be less than 0 . 6 /xm â€¢<br>
In addition, the seeded polymerization according to the first and second preparation method aspects can be carried out in the presence of one or more water-soluble initiator(s) chosen from hydrogen peroxide and alkali metal or ammonium persulphate. Ammonium persulphate is advantageously chosen.<br>
The water-soluble initiator or initiators is or are preferably introduced into the reaction mixture before the beginning of the seeded polymerization. The amount of water-soluble initiator(s) used is preferably between 10 and 100 ppm with respect to the monomer(s) involved.<br>
According to a further preparation method, the latex of the present invention can be obtained by mixing a latex (LI) comprising a single population of<br><br>
particles of polymers based on vinyl chloride, the mean diameter of which is between 1.2 and 2 ftm, with a second latex (L2) comprising a- single population of particles of polymers based on vinyl chloride, the mean diameter of which is between 0.15 and 0.3 /im, in proportions such that the ratio by mass of polymers of the latex (L2) to those of the latex (LI) is between 0.1 and 0.3.<br>
The latex (Ll) can be obtained by seeded microsuspension polymerization according to the first two methods described above, except that the polymerization is carried out in the absence of the second seeding polymer (P2) .<br>
The latex (L2) can be obtained by emulsion polymerization of vinyl chloride, alone or in combination with one or more copolymerizable monomer(s), a water-soluble initiator and an anionic emulsifier, optionally in combination with a non-ionic emulsifier.<br>
According to the first two preparation method aspects, the amount of two seeding polymers used is such that the ratio by mass of the second seeding polymer (P2) to (PI) is preferably between 0.5 and 2.<br>
Whatever the preparation method used, the latices thus prepared are then advantageously dried by atomization to give powders which are particularly suitable for the preparation of fluid plastisols which are stable on storage.<br><br>
The temperature at the atomizer inlet is preferably between 150 and 240Â°C and that at the outlet is preferably between 50 and 90Â°C.<br>
The invention is further illustrated with reference to the following exemplification.<br>
Experlmental part<br>
(A)  Preparation of the seeding polymer (PI)<br>
The following are successively introduced into an 800 litre reactor stirred at 35 revolutions/min and adjusted to 15Â°C:<br>
375 kg of water<br>
5	1 of the buffer solution<br>
containing 426 g of potassium<br>
dihydrogenphosphate and 117 g of pure<br>
sodium hydroxide<br>
11 g of paraquinone powder<br>
6	kg of lauroyl peroxide<br>
320 kg of vinyl chloride<br>
48 kg of a 10% by weight aqueous sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate solution,<br>
the reactor being placed under vacuum just before the introduction of the vinyl chlorideâ€¢ A fine dispersion of the vinyl chloride<br><br>
in the aqueous mixture is then produced at a temperature of less than or equal to 3 5Â°C by stirring the seEid mixture for 105 minutes at 5500 revolutions/min. The reaction mixture is then brought to the targeted polymerization temperature of 45Â°C under autogenous pressure, the rate of stirring being 30 revolutions/min. During the polymerization, paraquinone is introduced continuously with a constant throughput of 10.5 g/h.<br>
After the fall in pressure to a value of 3,5 bars, that is to say after 8 hours, the unreacted vinyl chloride is degassed. A latex is thus obtained, in which the particles have a mean diameter of approximately 0.55 jxm and contain approximately 1.8% by weight of lauroyl peroxide with respect to the polymer. The concentration of the latex is 3 9%.<br>
Preparation of the seeding polymer (PI)<br>
The preparation is carried out as described in (A), except that 11 kg of lauroyl peroxide are used. A latex is thus obtained, in which the particles have a mean diameter of approximately<br><br>
0-57 jxm  and contain approximately 3% by weight of lauroyl peroxide with respect to the polymer. The concentration of the latex is 34%.<br>
(C)	Preparation of the seeding polymer (PI)<br>
The preparation is carried out as described in (A), except that the duration for production of the fine dispersion of the vinyl chloride in the aqueous mixture is 40 minutes. A latex is obtained, in which the particles have a mean diameter of approximately 0.83 /Ltm and contain approximately 2.1% by weight of lauroyl peroxide with respect to the polymer. The concentration of the latex is 34%.<br>
(D)	Preparation of the seeding polymer (P2)<br>
The following are introduced into an 800<br>
litre reactor equipped with a stirrer:<br>
440 kg of water<br>
44 g of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid<br>
(EDTA)<br>
10.5 g of iron sulphate<br>
98 g of sodium formaldehydesulphoxylate<br>
1.23 kg of lauric acid and<br>
750 g of 50% sodium hydroxide<br><br>
The reactor is then placed under vacuum before the introduction of 350 kg of vinyl chloride.-*- The reaction mixture is then brought to the targeted temperature of 55Â°C. As soon as the mixture reaches 52 Â°C, an aqueous solution containing 200 g of potassium persulphate per 50 litres of water is introduced continuously. One hour after the beginning of introduction of the latter, 50 litres of aqueous solution containing 3.85 kg of dodecylbenzene sulphonate are added continuously at a constant throughput for 4 hours. When the internal pressure is 4 bars, the reactor is re-exposed to air and then cooled and the unreacted vinyl chloride is removed by degassing. A latex is thus obtained in which the particles have a mean diameter of 0.13 /xm.<br>
Preparation of the seeding polymer (L2)<br>
The preparation is carried out as described in (D), except that the amount of lauric acid used is 527 g. A latex is obtained in which the particles have a mean diameter of 0.215 fim.<br><br>
(F)  Preparation of the seeding polymer (L2)<br>
The preparation is carried out as described in (D), except that the amount of lauric acid used is 280 g. A latex is obtained in which the particles have a mean diameter of 0.316 [im.<br>

â– Example 12<br>
The reaction is carried out as described in Example 10, except that the latex (LI) used for the mixture is prepared according to (F).<br>
Example 13<br>
The reaction is carried out as described in Example 10, except that the mixture is prepared in proportions such that the ratio by mass of the polymer of the latex (L2) to that of the latex (LI) is equal to 0.11.<br>
Preparation of the plastisols<br>
The bipopulated latices obtained by mixing (Examples 8 to 13) are atomized by using an inlet temperature of the atomizer of 180Â°C and an outlet temperature of 70Â°C. On conclusion of this stage, the resin is then milled and then 100 parts of the resulting powder are mixed with 40 parts of dioctyl phthalate to give a plastisol, the rheological properties of which are reported in Table 3. The measurements were carried out under the same conditions as those of the plastisols of Table 1.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
