CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority from application number 60/691,115.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The composition of the present invention related to a quaternary ammo¬nium salt detergent and the use of such quaternary ammonium salt detergents in a fuel composition to reduce intake valve deposits and remove or clean up existing deposits on the intake valves.<br>
It is well known that liquid fuel contains components that can degrade during engine operation and form deposits. These deposits can lead to incom¬plete combustion of the fuel resulting in higher emission and poorer fuel economy. Fuel additives, such as detergents, are well known additives in liquid fuels to help with control or minimize deposit formation. As the dynamics and mechanics of an engine continual advance, the requirements of the fuel must evolve to keep up with these engine advancements. For example, today's engines have injector system that have smaller tolerances and operate at higher pressure to enhance fuel spray to the compression or combustion chamber. Deposit prevention and deposit reduction in these new engines has become critical to optimal operation of today's engines. Advancements in fuel additive technology, such as detergents, have enabled the fuel to keep up with these engine advancements. Therefore there is a need for detergent capable of providing acceptable performance in a liquid fuel to promote optimal operation of today's engines.<br>

As used herein, the term "hydrocarbyl substituent" or "hydrocarbyl group" is used in its ordinary sense, which is well-known to those skilled in the art. Specifically, it refers to a group having a carbon atom directly attached to the remainder of the molecule and having predominantly hydrocarbon charac¬ter. Examples of hydrocarbyl groups include: hydrocarbon substituents, that is, aliphatic (e.g., alkyl or alkenyl), alicyclic (e.g., cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl) substituents, and aromatic-, aliphatic-, and alicyclic-substituted aromatic substituents, as well as cyclic substituents wherein the ring is completed through another portion of the molecule (e.g., two substituents together form a ring), substituted hydrocarbon substituents, that is, substituents containing non-hydrocarbon groups which, in the context of this invention, do not alter the<br>
predominantly hydrocarbon nature of the substituent (e.g., halo (especially chloro and fluoro), hydroxy, alkoxy, mercapto, alkylmercapto, nitro, nitroso, and sulfoxy); hetero substituents, that is, substituents which, while having a predominantly hydrocarbon character, in the context of this invention, contain other than carbon in a ring or chain otherwise composed of carbon atoms. Heteroatoms include sulfur, oxygen, nitrogen, and encompass substituents as pyridyl, furyl, thienyl and imidazolyl. In general, no more than two, preferably no more than one, non-hydrocarbon substituent will be present for every ten carbon atoms in the hydrocarbyl group; typically, there will be no non-hydrocarbon substituents in the hydrocarbyl group.<br>
It is known that some of the materials described above may interact in the final formulation, so that the components of the final formulation may be different from those that are initially added. For instance, metal ions (of, e.g., a detergent) can migrate to other acidic or anionic sites of other molecules. The products formed thereby, including the products formed upon employing the composition of the present invention in its intended use, may not be susceptible of easy description. Nevertheless, all such modifications and reaction products are included within the scope of the present invention; the present invention encompasses the composition prepared by admixing the components described above. EXAMPLES<br>
The invention will be further illustrated by the following examples, which sets forth particularly advantageous embodiments. While the examples are provided to illustrate the present invention, they are not intended to limit it.<br>
The detergents are evaluated in the engine nozzle fouling test, as described in CEC F-23-01. The results of the engine nozzle fouling test are highlighted in Tables 1 and 2.<br>
The detergents that are used in this test include: a commercial available lOOOMn polyisobutylene succinimide of dimethylaminopropylamine (Compara¬tive Example 1), a commercially available l000Mn polyisobutylene succinim¬ide of tetraethylenepentamine (Comparative Example 2) and 4 experimental detergents of the present invention (Examples 1-4) as described below.<br>
Preparatory Example A:<br>
Preparatory Example A is prepared from a mixture of succinic anhydride prepared from 1000 Mn polyisobutylene (21425 grams) and diluent oil - pilot 900 (3781 grams) which are heated with stirring to 110°C under a nitrogen atmosphere. Dimethylaminopropylamine (DMAPA, 2314 grams) is added slowly over 45 minutes maintaining batch temperature below 115°C. The reaction temperature is increased to 150°C and held for a further 3 hours. The resulting compound is a DMAPA succinimide. Example 1<br>
Reaction product of Preparatory Example A, styrene oxide (12.5 grams), acetic acid (6.25 grams) and methanol (43.4 grams) are heated with stirring to reflux (~80°C) for 5 hours under a nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction is purified by distillation (30°C, -Ibar) and gave a water white distillate. The resulting compound is a styrene oxide quaternary ammonium salt. Example 2<br>
Reaction product of Preparatory Example A ( 373.4 grams) is heated with stirring to 90°C. Dimethylsulphate (25.35g) is charged to the reaction pot and stirring resumed (~300rpm) under a nitrogen blanket, exotherm raises batch temperature to ~100°C. The reaction is maintained at 100°C for 3 hours before cooling back and decanting. The resulting compound is a dimethylsulphate quaternary ammonium salt. Example 3<br>
Reaction product of Preparatory Example A (1735.2 grams) is heated with stirring to 90°C under a nitrogen atmosphere. Benzyl chloride (115.4 grams) is added drop wise maintaining reaction temperature at 90°C. The reaction is held for 5 hours at 90°C. The resulting compound is a benzyl chloride quaternary ammonium salt.<br>
Example 4<br>
The reaction product of Preparatory Example A (152.6 grams), dimethyl carbonate (31 grams) and methanol (26.9 grams) is charged to a pressure vessel. The vessel is then pressure tested for leaks and purged with nitrogen twice. The vessel is pressurized to ~19psi and the batch heated to 90°C with agitation (~210rpm). The batch is held on temperature for one hour before being heated to 140°C and held on temperature for 24 hours. On cooling back to ambient temperature residual pressure is released before decanting product. The reaction was purified by distillation (100°C, -O.Sbar) to remove free dimethyl carbonate and methanol. The resulting compound is a dimethyl carbonate quaternary ammonium salt.<br>
Note: For Comparative Examples 1 and 2 the active chemical is accompanied by inert diluent oil in a ratio of active chemical to diluent oil of 85:15 by weight.<br>
Note: For Examples 1-4 the active chemical is accompanied by inert diluent oil in a ratio of active chemical to diluent oil of 50:50 by weight.<br>

The results of the test show that formulations using quaternary ammonium salt detergents of the present invention (Examples 1, 2, 3, and 4) shows equivalent or superior flow performance and less average blockage of an injector compared to formulations using an unadditized fuel and/or commercially available detergents (Comparative Examples 1 and 2).<br>
The detergents are further evaluated in a High Speed Direct Injection Test. The High Speed Direct Injection Test is described as follows. A diesel fuel containing Ippm of zinc plus the respective detergent is inserted into a 2.0L High Speed Direct Injection (HSDI) Ford Puma engine. The engine is initially run at 2000 rev/minute for 5 minutes (engine warm-up period). After the initial warm up period, the engine is run in six (6) power curve iterations<br>
under the conditions set forth in Table 3. After completion of the sixth power curve iteration, the engine is subjected to the stabilization period under the conditions set forth in Table 4. After the stabilization period is complete, the engine is run in another six (6) power curve iterations under the conditions set forth in Table 3. The power output of the engine is measured during the 9th stage of the power curve iteration. The power at this 9th stage during the final power curve iteration (12th power curve iteration) is compared to the power at the 9th stage of the first power curve iteration and a final power loss in percent is calculated. The less power loss present in the engine the more effective the detergent is at reducing or minimizing power loss. The results of the test are summarized in Table 5.<br>
The detergents that are used in this test include: a commercial available lOOOMn polyisobutylene succinimide of dimethylaminopropylamine (Compara¬tive Example 1), a commercially available lOOOMn polyisobutylene succinim¬ide of tetraethylenepentamine (Comparative Example 2) and 3 experimental detergents of the present invention (Examples 1, 2 and 4) as described above.<br>
Table 3. Power Curve Iteration<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
NOTE: The ramping time between stages is 27 seconds except for the ramp from Stage 11 back to Stage 1 which is 30 seconds. These ramp times are not included in the stage times (i.e. total duration of the schedule is (11*5 minute stages) +(10*27 second ramps) + (1* 30 second ramp) giving a total cycle time of 60 minutes).<br>
