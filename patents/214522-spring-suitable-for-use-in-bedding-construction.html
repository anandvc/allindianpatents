The present invention will now be described in more detail according to three preferred but non-limiting embodiments and with reference to the accompanying d-fcuji-oqs •<br>

Figure 12:    Is a bottom view of the second preferred embodiment of the present invention;<br>
Figure 13:    Is a perspective view of the third preferred embodiment of the present invention;<br>
Figure 14:    Is a front elevational view of the third preferred embodiment of the present invention;<br>
Figure 15:    Is a rear elevational view of the third preferred embodiment of the present invention;<br>
Figure 16:    Is a side elevational view of the third preferred embodiment of the present invention;<br>
Figure 17:     Is a top view of the third preferred embodiment of the present invention; Figure 18:    Is a bottom view of the third preferred embodiment of the present invention; First Preferred Embodiment (Figures 1 to 6)<br>
As can be seen in Figures 1 to 6 the first preferred embodiment of the spring 1 of the present invention includes two legs 2, two upper feet 3, two lower feet 4, two coils 5, a link 6, two kinks 7 and two bends 8. The return portion or "kink" 7 on the end of both lower feet 4 is present to prevent the bottom portion of the spring 1 from slipping out of the ties and/or fixings used to fasten the spring to the main framing of the mattress (not shown). The length and angle of the return or kink 7 are variable depending on the ties and/or fixings used. In some cases, where a return portion or kink 7 is not required, the wire would be straight, without a "kink 7".<br>
The radius 9 at the bottom and top of both legs 2 prevents stress concentrations at these points when the spring 1 is compressed and can be varied according to the degree of flexibility required in the spring 1 as a whole.<br>
The diameter of the coil 5. which would usually, but not always, be situated in the middle of the overall height, is varied to achieve a suffer or softer spring as required for individual applications. A smaller diameter would result in a stiffer spring 1, while a larger diameter would give a softer spring 1. If an extremely soft spring 1 is required, two or even three turn coils 5 could be used instead of the single turn coils 5 illustrated.<br>
Similar in application to the kinks 7, the bends 8 at the extremities of the lower feet 4 are used to prevent movement of the top part of the spring 1 when fixed to the body of a mattress (not shown). The width, depth and position of these bends 8 would also be determined by the ties and/or fixings used to fasten the spring 1 to the main framing of the mattress (not shown). With some methods of fixing it would not be necessary to have a bend 8, and the wire would be left straight.<br>
Radii 9 avoid stress concentrations at points where the wire is bent. Ideally these radii 9 should be as large as possible while still allowing for the spring 1 to be secured to the mattress frame (not shown).<br>
The overall length of the spring form 1 determines the number of supports in the mattress frame per unit length. A shorter overall length would allow more spring forms 1 to be used providing for a stronger mattress. A longer overall length would result in fewer spring forms 1 being used, resulting in a softer mattress. The overall design of the mattress frame would also dictate the overall length required.<br>
The overall width of the spring form 1 has a bearing on the stiffness of the spring 1 as a whole. A narrow spring 1 would be relatively stiff, while a wider spring 1 would be softer. The overall design of the mattress frame would also dictate the overall width required.<br>
The overall height of the spring form 1 is determined by the thickness of the mattress to which it is being fitted. The overall height also has a bearing on the overall stiffness of the spring 1. A spring form 1 with a greater height would be stiffer than a spring with a shorter height.<br>
Second Preferred Embodiment (Figures 7 to 13)<br>
As can be seen in Figures 7 to 13 the second preferred embodiment of the spring 1 of the present invention includes two legs 2, two upper feet 3, two lower feet 4, four coils 5, a link 6, two kinks 7 and two bends 8. The return portion or "kink" 7 on the end of both<br>
lower feet 4 is present to prevent the bottom portion of the spring 1 from slipping out of the ties and/or fixings used to fasten the spring to the main framing of the mattress (not shown). The length and angle of the return or kink 7 are variable depending on the ties and/or fixings used. In some cases, where a return portion or kink 7 is not required, the wire would be straight, without a "kink 7".<br>
The diameter of the coils 5 is varied to achieve a stiller or softer spring 1 as required for individual applications. A smaller diameter would result in a stiffer spring 1, while a larger diameter would give a softer spring 1. If an extremely soft spring 1 is required, two or even three turn coils 5 could be used instead of the single turn coils 5 illustrated.<br>
The radii 9. which would usually, but not always, be situated in the middle of the overall heights, prevent stress concentrations at these points when the spring 1 is compressed and can be varied according to the degree of flexibility required in the spring 1.<br>
Similar in application to the kinks 7, the bends 8 at the extremities of the lower feet 4 are used to prevent movement of the top part of the spring 1 when fixed to the body of a mattress (not shown). The width, depth and position of these bends 8 would also be determined by the ties and/or fixings used to fasten the spring 1 to the main framing of the mattress (not shown). With some methods of fixing it would not be necessary to have a bend 8, and the wire would be left straight.<br>
Radii 9 avoid stress concentrations at points where the wire is bent. Ideally these radii 9 should be as large as possible while still allowing for the spring 1 to be secured to the mattress frame (not shown).<br>
The overall length of the spring form 1 determines the number of supports in the mattress frame per unit length. A shorter overall length would allow more spring forms 1 to be used providing for a stronger mattress. A longer overall length would result in fewer spring forms 1 being used, resulting in a softer mattress. The overall design of the mattress frame would also dictate the overall length required.<br>
The overall width of the spring form 1 has a bearing on the stiffness of the spring 1 as a whole. A narrow spring 1 would be relatively stiff, while a wider spring 1 would be softer. The overall design of the mattress frame would also dictate the overall width required.<br>
The overall height of the spring form 1 is determined by the thickness of the mattress to which it is being fitted. The overall height also has a bearing on the overall stiffness of the spring 1. A spring form 1 with a greater height would be stiffer than a spring with a shorter height.<br>
Third Preferred Embodiment (Figures 13 to IS')<br>
As can be seen in Figures 13 to 18 the third preferred embodiment of the spring 1 of the present invention includes two legs 2, two upper feet 3, two lower feet 4, six coils 5, a link 6, two kinks 7 and two bends 8. The return portion or "kink" 7 on the end of both lower feet 4 is present to prevent the bottom portion of the spring 1 from slipping out of the ties and/or fixings used to fasten the spring to the main framing of the mattress (not shown). The length and angle of the return or kink 7 are variable depending on the ties and/or fixings used. In some cases, where a return portion or kink 7 is not required, the wire would be straight, without a "kink 7".<br>
The diameter of the coils 5 is varied to achieve a stiffer or softer spring 1 as required for individual applications. A smaller diameter would result in a stiffer spring 1, while a larger diameter would give a softer spring 1. If an extremely soft spring 1 is required, two or even three turn coils 5 could be used instead of the single turn coils 5 illustrated.<br>
The radius 9 at the bottom and top of both legs 2 prevents stress concentrations at these points when the spring 1 is compressed and can be varied according to the degree of flexibility required in the spring 1 as a whole.<br>
Similar in application to the kinks 7. the bends S at the extremities of the lower feet 4 are used to prevent movement of the top part of the spring 1 when fixed to the body of a mattress (not shown). The width, depth and position of these bends 8 would also be determined by the ties and/or fixings used to fasten the spring 1 to the main framing of the mattress (not shown). With some methods of fixing it would not be necessary to have a bend 8, and the wire would be left straight.<br>
Radii 9 avoid stress concentrations at points where the wire is bent. Ideally these radii 9 should be as large as possible while still allowing for the spring 1 to be secured to the mattress frame (not shown).<br>
The overall length of the spring form 1 determines the number of supports in the mattress frame per unit length. A shorter overall length would allow more spring forms 1 to be used providing for a stronger mattress. A longer overall length would result in fewer spring forms 1 being used, resulting in a softer mattress. The overall design of the mattress frame would also dictate the overall length required.<br>
The overall width of the spring form 1 has a bearing on the stiffness of the spring 1 as a whole. A narrow spring 1 would be relatively stiff, while a wider spring 1 would be softer. The overall design of the mattress frame would also dictate the overall width required.<br>
The overall height of the spring form 1 is determined by the thickness of the mattress to which it is being fitted. The overall height also has a bearing on the overall stiffness of the spring 1. A spring form 1 with a greater height would be stiffer than a spring with a shorter height.<br>
