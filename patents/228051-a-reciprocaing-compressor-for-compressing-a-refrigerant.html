				<td>A Reciprocating Compressoor For Compressing A Refrigerant<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a reciprocating compressor for compressing a refrigerant in a refrigerator, and more particularly, to a reciprocating compressor for compressing a refrigerant that is capable of improving a lubricating performance by using a lubricant with an excellent compatibility with a refrigerant used for a refrigerator and improving a performance of.the refrigerator.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
As chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), a refrigerant used for a refrigerator, an air-conditioner or the like, has been known as a source material damaging an ozone layer of the stratosphere, researches on a substitute refrigerant is being actively<br>
conducted.<br>
The CFC comprises R11 (trichloromonogluoromethane), R12 (dichlorodifluoromethane), R13 and the like, of which R12 mainly used as a refrigerant for a refrigerator is one of regulation-subject materials as being a source material causing an ozone layer reduction and generating a global warming effect. Thus, researches on a natural refrigerant is being actively conducted as a substitute refrigerant.<br>
The natural refrigerant refers to a material used as a refrigerant which naturally exists in the globe such as water, ammonia, nitride, carbon dioxide,<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
propane, butane and the like, not an artificial compound. Known that it does not<br>
have a bad influence on the global environment, application of the natural<br>
refrigerant as a refrigerant is positively reviewed.<br>
Among the natural refrigerants, hydrocarbon comprises only carbon and<br>
hydrogen and includes R50 (methane), R170 (ethane), R290 (propane), R600<br>
(butane), R600a (isobutene), R1270 (propylene) or the like. Hydrocarbon is not<br>
toxic and chemically stable and especially exhibits an appropriate solubility in a<br>
mineral oil.<br>
In addition, the hydrocarbon has a zero ozone depletion potential and a<br>
very low global warming index. That is, when a global warming index of carbon<br>
dioxide is admitted as '1', a global warming index of R12 is 7100, R134a is 1200,<br>
while propane is very low, 3.<br>
Especially, isobutane (R600a) is an environmental-friendly natural gas<br>
which does not damage the ozone layer and have no influence on a greenhouse<br>
effect. That is, isobutane (R600a), a sort of a natural gas obtained by refining<br>
hydrocarbon gas created in an oil refining process to a high degree of purity, is<br>
a refrigerant containing no environmentally detrimental factor.<br>
However, with all those advantages, isobutene (R600a) is hardly<br>
combined with refrigerant oil currently used for a refrigerating system due to its<br>
chemical and electrical properties. Therefore, a refrigerant oil suitable for<br>
isobutene (R600a) is in need of development. Especially, necessity of a<br>
refrigerant oil usable for a reciprocating compressor for compressing isobutene<br><br>
(R600a) comes to the front.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the currently used reciprocating compressor<br>
includes: a hermetic container 6 having a suction pipe 2 for sucking a refrigerant<br>
and a discharge pipe 4 for discharging a compressed refrigerant each as being<br>
connected thereto; a driving unit 8 disposed inside the case 6 and generating a<br>
reciprocal motional force; a compression unit 10 for receiving the reciprocal<br>
motional force from the driving unit 8 and compressing the refrigerant; and a<br>
lubrication unit 12 for lubricating each motional portion of the driving unit 8 and<br>
the compression unit 10.<br>
In the reciprocating compressor, when the driving unit 8 is driven and the<br>
compression unit 10 makes a compression operation on the refrigerant, the<br>
lubrication unit 12 supplies a lubricant 50 stored at the lower portion of the<br>
hermetic container 6 to the motional portion of the compression unit, thereby<br>
performing a lubricating operation. The refrigerant compressed in the compression<br>
unit is the natural refrigerant.<br>
Since the lubricant used for the reciprocating compressor constructed and<br>
operated as described above is used as a refrigerant oil for the compressor<br>
compressing the natural refrigerant, its physical and chemical properties should<br>
be in good harmony with the natural refrigerant.<br>
Namely, the lubricant used as the refrigerant oil of the reciprocating<br>
compressor needs to have characteristics that it can protect well an oil film even<br>
though the refrigerant is dissolved, should be thermally and chemically stable so<br>
as not to react in spite of being in contact with the refrigerant and an organic<br><br>
material metal at a high temperature or at a low temperature, and should have a<br>
high level thermal stability so as not to generate a carbon sludge not to be<br>
oxidized at a high temperature part of the compressor.<br>
In order to satisfy those characteristics, characters of the lubricant, such<br>
as a kinematic viscosity, a pour point, a density, a total acid number, a water<br>
content or the like, work as critical factors.<br>
Therefore, if the lubricant used for the reciprocating compressor<br>
compressing the natural refrigerant is not well harmonized with the refrigerant of<br>
the refrigerator, the oil would be leaked. Then, oil circulation is deteriorated to<br>
degrade a heat transfer performance of the refrigerator and a lubrication<br>
performance, resulting in that frictional portions of each motional part are abraded<br>
and thus each part is damaged.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 is a sectional view of a general reciprocating compressor for<br>
compressing a refrigerant.<br>
MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figure 1 is a sectional view of a general reciprocating compressor for<br>
compressing a refrigerant.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the general reciprocating compressor includes: a<br>
hermetic container 6 to which a suction pipe 2 for sucking a refrigerant and a<br>
discharge pipe 4 for discharging a compressed refrigerant are connected, a<br>
driving unit 8 disposed inside the case 6 and generating a reciprocal motional<br>
force; a compression unit 10 for receiving a reciprocal motional force generated<br>
from the driving unit 8 and performing a compressing operation on the refrigerant;<br>
and a lubrication unit 12 for performing a lubricating operation on each motional<br>
portion of the driving unit 8 and the compression unit 10.<br>
The driving unit 8 includes: a cylindrical outer stator 16 fixed by a support<br>
frame 14 fixed inside the hermetic container 6; an inner stator 18 disposed with<br>
a certain air gap with an inner circumferential surface of the outer stator 16; a<br>
winding coil 20 wound at the outer stator 16, to which power is applied from an<br>
external source; and magnets 22 disposed at regular intervals between the outer<br>
stator 16 and the inner stator 18 and linearly and reciprocally moved when power<br>
is applied to the winding coil 20.<br><br><br>
The magnets 22 are fixed at an outer circumferential surface of the magnet<br>
holder 24 at equal intervals, and the magnet holder 24 is connected to the piston<br>
26 of the compression unit 10.<br>
The compression unit 10 includes a piston 26 connected to the magnet<br>
i holder 24 and linearly and reciprocally moved; a cylinder 28, into which the piston<br>
26 is slidably inserted, forming a compression chamber 36; a suction-valve 32<br>
mounted at a suction opening 30 formed at the piston 26 and preventing a<br>
backflow of the refrigerant after being introduced into the compression chamber<br>
36; and a discharge valve 34 mounted at a front side of the cylinder 28 and performing an opening and closing operation on a compressed refrigerant.<br>
The lubrication unit 12 includes: a lubricant 50 filled as much as a certain<br>
amount at a lower portion of the hermetic container; a lubricant pumping unit 40<br>
for pumping the lubricant 50; and a lubricant supply passage 42 for supplying the<br>
lubricant 50 pumped by the lubricant pumping unit 40 to a frictional portion between the piston 26 and the cylinder 28.<br>
The operation of the general reciprocating compressor constructed as<br>
described above will now be explained.<br>
When power is applied to the winding coil 20, a flux is formed around the<br>
winding coil 2, a flux is formed around the winding coil 20, forming a closed loop along the outer stator 16 and the inner stator 18. By the interaction of the flux<br>
formed between the outer stator 16 and the inner stator 18 and the flux formed<br>
by the magnet 22, the magnet 22 is linearly moved in an axial direction. When the<br>
direction of a current applied to the winding coil 20 is changed in turn, the magnet<br><br>
22 is linearly and reciprocally moved as the direction of the flux of the winding coil<br>
20 is changed.<br>
Then, as the motion of the magnet 22 is transferred to the piston 26 by the<br>
magnet holder 24, the piston 26 is linearly and reciprocally moved inside the<br>
cylinder 28, thereby compressing a refrigerant.<br>
That is, when the piston 26 is retreated, the refrigerant is supplied to the<br>
compression chamber 36 through the suction opening 30 formed at the piston 26.<br>
When the piston 26 advances, the suction opening 30 is closed by the suction<br>
valve 32 and the refrigerant inside the compression chamber 36 is compressed,<br>
which is then discharged through the discharge pipe 4.<br>
The lubricant 50 filled in the hermetic container 6 is pumped by the<br>
operation of the lubricant pumping unit 40 and supplied to the frictional portion<br>
between the piston 26 and the cylinder 28 through the lubricant supply passage<br>
42, thereby performing a lubricating operation.<br>
The refrigerant compressed by the reciprocating compressor constructed<br>
and operated as described above is a natural refrigerant which is environment-<br>
friendly and has combustibility and explosiveness.<br>
As the natural refrigerant, an organic compound refrigerant consisting of<br>
only carbon and hydrogen is mainly used. Among organic compound refrigerants,<br>
hydrocarbon, consisting of only carbon and hydrogen, has no toxicity, is<br>
chemically stable, has a zero ozone depletion potential and a very low global<br>
warming index. Hydrocarbon includes R50 (methane), R170 (ethane), R290<br>
(propane), R600 (butane), R600a (isobutene), R1270 (prophylene), etc.<br><br>
Especially, isobutene (R600a) is hydrocarbon-based, has a molecular<br>
formula of CH (CH3)3, and is environment-friendly natural gas which does neither<br>
damage an ozone layer nor affect a greenhouse effect, and as such it is used as<br>
a refrigerant compressed by the reciprocating compressor of the present<br>
invention.<br>
As the lubricant 50 for making a lubricating operation for the reciprocating<br>
compressor of the present invention, a mineral oil is used which has a favorable<br>
compatibility with hydrocarbon and satisfies physical and chemical characteristics.<br>
The mineral oil is divided into a paraffin-based one and a naphtan-based<br>
one. In the present invention, the paraffin-based mineral lubricant is used.<br>
It is preferred that the paraffin-based lubricant has a density of<br>
0.866-0.880 g/cm3 at a temperature of 15°C.<br>
A flash point of the paraffin-based lubricant varies depending on a size and<br>
a type of the reciprocating compressor. Preferably, it is above 140°C, and it can<br>
be below 165°C, below 175°C, below 185°C and below 200°C according to the<br>
type of an adopted compressor.<br>
A kinematic viscosity of the paraffin-based lubricant is preferably 7.2-21.8<br>
mm2/s at a temperature of 40°C, and most preferably, it is 8.29 mm2/s and 10.3<br>
mm2/s depending on the size and type of an adopted reciprocating compressor.<br>
A viscosity index of the paraffin-based lubricant is preferably 73-99.<br>
A flow point of the paraffin-basedjubricant is preferably below -25°C.<br>
A total acid number of the paraffin-based lubricant is below 0.01 mgKOH/g.<br><br>
The total acid number of the lubricant, representing an amount of an acid<br>
component contained in an oil, indicates an amount of potassium hydroxide<br>
required for neutralizing an acid component contained in 1 g of sample oil by the<br>
number of mg.<br>
A water content of the paraffin-based lubricant is preferably below 20 ppm.<br>
A breakdown voltage of the paraffin-based lubricant is preferably above 30<br>
kV.<br>
As so far described, the reciprocating compressor for compressing a<br>
refrigerator of the present invention has such an advantage that since it uses the<br>
paraffin-based lubricant, a sort of the mineral oil with an excellent compatibility<br>
with the hydrocarbon, a natural refrigerant, compressed by the reciprocating<br>
compressor, the lubricating performance is improved and a life span of the<br>
reciprocating compressor is lengthened.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and<br>
variations can be made in the reciprocating compressor of the present invention<br>
without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that<br>
the present invention cover modifications and variations of this invention provided<br>
they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.<br><br>
