Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to 2,3-dimethyl-8-(2,6-dimethylbenzylamino)-N-hydroxyethyl-imidazo[l,2-a]pyridine-6-carboxamide mesylate salt and novel crystalline forms thereof. Further, me present invention also relates to use of said compounds forme treatment of gastrointestinal disorders, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and processes for obtaining them.<br>
Background of the invention and prir art'<br>
In the formulation of drug compositions, it is important for the drug substance to be in a form in which it can be convemently handled and processed This is of importance, not only from-lhe point-of view of obtaining a commercially viable manufacturing process, but-also from the point of view of subsequent manufacture of pharmaceutical formulations comprising the active compound,<br>
Further, in the manufecture of oral drag compositions, it is important that a reliable, reproducible and constant plasma concentration profile of drug is provided following administration to a patient<br>
Chemical stability, solid state stability, and "shelf life" of the active ingredients are also very important factors, The drug substance, and compositions containing it, should be capable of being effectively stored over appreciable periods of time, without exhibiting a significant change in the physico-chemical characteristics of the active component, e,g. its chemical composition, density, hygroscopicity and solubility.<br>
Amorphous materials may present problems in this regard. For example, such materials are typically more difficult to handle and to formulate, provide for unreliable: solubility, and are often found to be more unstable.<br>
solubility, and are often found to be more unstable, <br>
Thus, in the manufacture of commercially viable and pharmaceutically acceptable drug compositions, it is important, wherever possible, to provide the drag in a substantially crystalline and stable form(s).<br>

Only the main peaks, that are the most characteristic, significant, distinct and/or reproducible, have been tabulated, but additional peaks can be extracted, using conventional methods, from the diffractogram. The presence of these main peaks, reproducible and within the error limit (±2 on the last given decimal place), is for most circumstances sufficient to establish the presence of the said crystal modifications.<br>
The compound of the invention 2,3-dimethyl-8-(2,6-dmiethylben2ylarnino)-N-hydroxyethyl-imidazo[I,2-a]pyridine-6-carboxaniide mesylate salt form A, prepared according to the present invention is analyzed, characterized and differentiated from form B, form C, form D, form E, form F, form G and form H by X-ray powder diffraction, a technique which is known per se. Another suitable technique to analyze, characterize and differentiate form A from other crystal forms, such as form B is by Raman spectroscopy. The analysis, characterization and differentiation of form B, form C, form D, form E, form F, form G and form H, may be conducted in the corresponding way.<br>
2,3-dimethyl-8-(2,6Kiimethylben2ylamino)-N-hydroxyethyl-imidazo[l,2-a]pyridine-6-carboxamide mesylate salt form A and 2,3-dimethyl-8-(2,6-dimemylbenzylamino)-N-hydroxyethyl-imidazofl^-aJpyridine-S-carboxamide mesylate salt form B are crystalline forms exhibiting advantageous properties, such as convenient handling as well as chemical and physical stability.<br>
It is possible to crystallize 2,3-dimethyl-8-(2,6-dimethylbenzylamino)-N-hydroxyethyl-imidazo[l,2-a]pyridine-6-carboxamide mesylate salt form A, form B, form C, form D, form E, form F, form G and form H, i.e. the crystal forms of the present invention, in one single solvent, in a mixture of solvents, or in an aqueous mixture thereof.<br>
Suitable solvents to be used for the crystallisation are water, alcohols, such as lower alcohols, ketones, ethers, esters, haloalkanes, alkanes. halobenzenes, aliphatic nitriles and<br>
aromatic solvents, such as toluene or xylene. However, this list of solvents is not exhaustive.<br>
The term "lower alcohol" includes herein a linear or branched C1-C5-alcohol, such as<br>
linear or branched C2- C3-alcohol. Other examples are methanol, ethanol, wo-propanol, and butanol.<br>
Crystallization of compounds of the present invention from an appropriate solvent system, containing at least one solvent, may be achieved by attaining supersaturation in a solvent system by solvent evaporation, by temperature decrease, and/or via the addition of anti-<br>
i<br>
solvent (i.e. a solvent in which the compounds of the invention are poorly soluble).<br>
Crystallization may be initiated and/or effected with or without seeding with crystals of the appropriate crystalline compound of the invention.<br>
Crystallization of compounds of the present invention can be achieved by in situ formation of the salt starting from pure 2,3-dimethyl-8-(2,6-dimethylbenzylamino)-N-hydroxyethyl-imidazo[l,2-a]pyridine-6-carboxamide as well as starting from 2,3-dimethyl-8-(2,6-dimethylbenzylamino)-N-hydroxyethyl-imidazo[l,2-a]pyridine--6-carboxamidemesyIate salt of any form, or mixtures of any form.<br>
Whether an anhydrate, hydrate, ansolvate or solvate crystallizes is related to the kinetics and equilibrium conditions of the respective forms at the specific conditions. Thus, as may be appreciated by the skilled person, the crystalline form that is obtained depends upon both the kinetics and the thermodynamics of the crystallization process. Under certain conditions (solvent system, temperature, pressure and concentration of compound of the invention), one crystalline form may be more stable than another (or indeed any other). However, crystalline forms that have a relatively low thermodynamic stability may be kinetically favored. Thus, in addition, kinetic factors, such as time, impurity profile, agitation, the presence or absence of seeds, etc. may also influence which form that crystallizes.<br>
One object of the present invention is to provide processes for the preparation of 2,3-dime1hyl-8-(2,6-dimethylbenzylamino)-N-hydroxyethyl-imidazo[l,2-a]pyridine-6-carboxamide mesylate salt form A, form B, form C, form D, form E, form F, form G and formH.<br>
