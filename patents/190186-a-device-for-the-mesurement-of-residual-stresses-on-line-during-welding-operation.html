				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a device for the measurement of residual stresses on-line during welding operations.<br>
Manufacturing process like welding, casting, forgings, and involving heat, produces residual stresses due to the inherent nature of the process. Unless special treatments are given to the manufactured part, these stresses act in combination with operational stresses thereby leading to early failures. The conventional system used for the measurement of the residual stresses comprises very expensive and one-time usuable residual stress strain rosettes in association with expensive hole drilling system.<br>
There are disadvantages associated with the conventional system. One of the main disadvantage is that the conventional system facilitates measurement of the residual stress after a considerable time of the completion of welding operation which is a lengthy and time consuming system.<br>
Another disadvantage is that specialized expert personel are required for fixing the sensors and for interpretation of the measured data.<br>
Yet another disadvantage is that by the use of such conventional system only final stress state can be measured and the measurements from the start to the end of the welding operation are not possible.<br><br>
Still   another  disadvantage   is   that   due   to   the factors  as   stated   above/   residual   stress   measurement   has been  an   expensive  proposition/   and   therefore  is   being restricted   to   very  important   situations.<br>
Welding   processes   are  utilized   in   extremely diverse and  wide   ranging   industries.   Any attempt   at   reducing   the complexity  of   residual   stress   measurement   by developing simpler  technique   and  taking   remedial  measures   like  heat   input control   and   wel di ng   fixtures   for   reducing     the   levels  of locked-in   stresses  due   to   the   process   itself  will   immensely benefit   the   large  number  of   industries  where welding   is  used.<br>
Therefore   the   main   object   of   the   present   invention   is to   provide   a   simple   and   cost   effective  device  for  on   -  line measurements  of   residual   stresses during   welding   operation.<br>
Another  object   of   the   present   invention   is   to   provide a   device/system   for   providing   measurements  many times at   a   preselected   threshold   temperature  value   during   the    welding   operation.<br>
Yet   another   object   of   the  present   invention   is   to provide  a  device   for" the   measurement   of   residual   stresses on-line  during   the   welding   operation/   which   is   an   easy and  not   a  time   consuming   system.<br>
Further   object's" and   advantages   of   this   invention will   be  more  apparent   from  the  ensuing  description.<br><br>
At the outset of the description which follows, it is to be understood that the ensuing description only illustrates a particular form of this invention. However, such a particular form is only an exemplary embodiment, and without intending to imply any limitation on the scope of this invention. Accordingly, the description is to be understood as an exemplary embodiment and teaching of the invention and not intended to be taken restrictively.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a device for the measurement of residual stresses on-line during welding operation comprising a plurality of sensors provided for sensing the temperature being connected to a data acquisition and singal conditioning means provided for converting the thermal signals into computer reliable signals, said means being connected to a computer through an interface and provided for storing the information and for providing the print-out of the measured residual stresses and a VDU being provided so as to control and monitoring and servo control device connected to said computer and provided for controlling various weld parameters.<br>
The nature of the invention, its objectives and further advantages residing in the same will be apparent from the following description made with reference to non limiting exemplary illustrative embodiments of the constituents of the system of the invention represented in the accompanying drawings.<br><br>
Fig. 1 is a block diagram of the on line weld<br>
residual stress measurement system. Reference is invited<br>
# to this figure which is a schematic representation of an<br>
embodiment of the system and particularly represents the<br>
principle employed in the system of the invention to identify<br>
residual stresses in components during welding. The on-line<br>
weld residual stress measurement system comprises of a<br>
personal computer (11) containing  in it a plugged-in data<br>
acquisition card for acquiring temperature data from tempera<br>
ture sensors (5) and a signal conditioning device (6) for<br>
converting the analogue temperature signals into voltage<br>
of appropriate magnitude. Resident in the computer memory<br>
is a specially written computer programme for converting the<br>
thermal data/ measured by temperature sensors (5) into<br>
residual stresses. A video display unit (12) enables the<br>
graphical output (16) of the computed residual stresses to<br>
be seen. A control signal (7) proportional to the magnitude<br>
of residual stress is available as an analogue voltage<br>
output and this can be fed to a servo control- device (10),<br>
for control of various weld parameters viz./ weld current/<br>
speed of welding etc.- An on-li neprinter provides a hard<br>
copy of the results of residual stresses.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the procedures involved prior to the<br>
measurements. The temperature sensors (5) are mounted on<br>
the job surface near the zone of welding (2). The leads from t<br>
sensor  are connected directly to electronic signal<br>
conditioning equipment (6). The measurement system is switched<br>
on and the welding operations are carried out on the job.<br><br>
At the end of welding operation and after the job (1) has cooled to the ambient temperature/ residual stress can be displayed on the monitor by appropriate control functions on the personal computer keyboard (1). Also during the operation itself, the variation of residual stress can bo seen on the video display<br>
unit (12) of the device.<br>
Fig. 3 gives a typical output of residual stress variation<br>
(14) during the welding operation.<br>
In accordance with the present invention a plurality<br>
of sensors are provided for sensing the temperature of the job<br>
to be welded and during the welding operation. The sensors are<br>
generally in the form of thermo couples (5). Resistance temperatur<br>
devices or temperature mapping cameras are  also used.Its numbers<br>
depends on the form and shape of the job. TTiermo 
generates signals in terms of DC voltage corresponding to the<br>
temperature it is sensing. The analogue temperature signals<br>
are then converted by the signal conditioning device (6) into<br>
voltage of appropriate magnitude for the computer  (11) to<br>
convert—this thermal data into residual stress. A specially<br>
written computer programme also generates a control signal (7)<br>
proportional to the magnitude of residual stress in the form of an<br>
analogue voltage output which is fed into a servio control device<br>
(10) for  control of various weld parameters viz/ weld current/ speed of welding etc. Thus controlling the magnitude of residual stress automatically at optimum level.<br><br>
Print out (14) is obtained as and when required from the on-line printer provided.<br>
Thus it is seen that by using the device of the present invention the residual stress during the welding operation can be measured from the begining to end at a low cost and effective manner.<br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A device for the measurement of residual stresses on-line during welding operation comprising a plurality of sensors 5 provided for sensing the temperature being connected to a data acquisition and singal conditioning means 6 provided for converting the thermal signals into computer reliable signals, said means being connected to a computer 11 through an interface 8 and provided for storing the information and for providing the print-out of the measured residual stresses and a VDU 12 being provided so as to control and monitoring and servo control device 10 connected to said computer 11 and provided for controlling various weld parameters.<br>
