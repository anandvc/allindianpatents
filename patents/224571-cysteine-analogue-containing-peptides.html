				<td>Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to non-antigen-specific immunomodulation, including both immunosuppression and immunostimulation. In particular, the invention relates to immunomodulatory peptides comprising amino acid residues which contain S, Se orTe, which peptides are capable of inducing an immunomodulatory response in mammals and thereby a therapeutic effect, and uses thereof.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
The immune system, when it is working properly, protects the individual from infection and from growth of cancers. In order to carry out these functions, it must be able to recognise and mount an attack against foreign antigens (including cancer-specific antigens), but not against self antigens present on normal cells throughout the body.<br>
It is possible to stimulate the immune system in order to improve its level of protection. Vaccines, including single-protein antigens such as diptheria toxoid, are widely used to generate immunity against a specific antigen and thus a specific disease. Where general stimulation of the immune system is desired, this can sometimes be achieved with nonspecific agents such as adjuvants, interleukins, interferons, and colony stimulating factors.<br>
Occasionally, the immune system loses its critical ability to distinguish self from non-self. The resulting immunological assault on the individual's own tissues can take the form of autoimmune disease: for example, systemic lupus erythrematosis, Type 1 diabetes, or rheumatoid arthritis. In such a case, or alternatively where the individual is the recipient of<br><br>
a transplanted organ or tissue, suppression rather than stimulation of the immune response is desirable.<br>
Non-specific down-regulation of the immune response is typically achieved by treatment with corticosteroids, azathioprine, cyclosporine, tacrolimus (FK506), rapamycin, or mycophenolate mofetil. Certain immunoglobulins, including the monoclonal antibody OKT3, have also been used for this purpose. Suppression of immunity against a specific antigen, called "tolerance induction", may also be possible. Methods that have been used for inducing tolerance against a particular antigen include intravenous or repeated topical administration of the antigen in dilute form, treatment with a very high dose of the antigen, and oral administration of the antigen..<br>
It has now been found that certain peptides containing amino acid residues containing S, Se and Te have activity as immunomodulators. A surprising property associated with the immunomodulatory activity is that the activity has been found to be immunoinhibitory or imrnunostimulatory in effect, on the basis of experiments described herein and furthermore, that the immunomodulatory activity has been shown to be indicative of having some therapeutic effect in the treatment of certain diseases, such as cancer and arthritis.<br>
Furthermore, it has been found that when the administration to the epithelial cell lining is by way of oral administration, the administration of the peptides has been observed to correlate with a modulating effect on the growth of tumours.<br>
A further surprising finding is that the oral presentation of "naked" peptides of the invention did not require the inclusion of added transport agents. Thus, the peptides of the invention do not need to be administered in association with transport agents such as delivery vehicles e.g. vesicular delivery systems which are designed to improve delivery to the mucosal epithelial cell lining of the gut.<br>
In addition, it has been found that the amount of peptide required to produce the therapeutic effect by oral delivery can be significantly lower than that required to produce a similar effect when the peptide is delivered systemically, eg by parenteral injection.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an effective means for treating disease using immunomodulatory peptides.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide immunomodulatory peptides which can be utilised in the treatment of disease.<br>
These and other objects of the invention will become apparent from the following description and examples.<br>

Amino acid residues of A and B independently selected from amino acid residues having aliphatic side chains, aliphatic hydroxyl side chains, basic side chains, acidic side chains, secondary amino groups, amide side chains, and sulphur containing side chains. Suitable amino acids may be independently selected from the groups comprising naturally and non-naturally occurring amino acid residues. Examples of naturally occurring amino acid residues include isoleucine (Ile), leucine (Leu), alanine (Ala), arginine (Arg), asparagine (Asn), aspartic acid (Asp), cysteine (Cys), glutarnine (Gin), glutamic acid (Glu), glycine (Gly), lysine (Lys), phenyl alanine (Phe), proline (Pro), serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), tryptophan (Trp), tyrosine (Tyr), methionine (Met), valine (Val) and histidine (His). Naturally, the skilled addressee will appreciate that naturally occurring amino acid residues<br>
means those amino acid residues which are found in peptides and/or proteins of living organisms. The skilled addressee will also appreciate that such naturally occurring amino acid residues may be present in peptides of the invention in chemically modified forms eg including added protecting groups such as ethyl, trityl (Tit), allyl, t-butyl and the like. Naturally, the skilled addressee will appreciate that any protecting group(s) which may be present on the peptides of the invention should be such so as not to substantially interfere with the immunomodulatory properties thereof and hence therapeutic effect thereof.<br>
Peptides of the invention can be made synthetically, for example by chemical means, or through the use of recombinant DNA technology. Alternatively, peptides according to the invention can be isolated from polypeptides or problems or the like.<br>
Amino acid residues R8 of formula (II) or formula (III) in which R7 is SH, SOH, SO2H, S03H, SeH or TeH in particular and cysteine residues within formula (I) are capable of reacting to form intermolecular links with the formation of dimers or intramolecular bridges with the formation of cyclised monomers.<br>
The amino acid units making up the peptides according to the invention may be in L- and D- form. Generally the amino acid units will be in L- form. For example a methionine or penicillamine residue in D- form may be used.<br>
A peptide of the invention may take the form of a dimer consisting of two like or two dissimilar peptide monomers linked to each other by way of covalent bonds (e.g. bonds between S, SO, SO2, SO3, Se, Te). In an aspect of the invention, the peptide monomers may be linked one to the other through bonds between at least one Rg and/or cysteine amino acid residue of the first monomer and at least one of Rg amino acid residue of a second monomer. Dimers of the present invention may be in parallel form, i.e. two peptide monomers aligned parallel one to the other such that both the peptide monomers are readable in one direction eg from the N- terminal to C-terminal direction. The peptide monomers making up the dimer may or may not be the same length. Preferably, the peptide<br><br>
monomers are the same length and the N- and C- terminal amino acid residues of one monomer are located adjacent to the N- and C- terminal amino acid residues of the second peptide monomer. Alternatively, a dimer of the present invention may be in anti-parallel form. That is to say, a first monomer read from the N-terminal amino acid residue to the C-terminal amino acid residue is aligned against a second monomer which is read from the C-terminal amino acid residue to the N-terminal amino acid residue ie in the opposite direction to that of the first peptide monomer; the two peptide monomers being linked through covalent bonds as described above for parallel or anti-parallel dimers of the invention.<br>
Where the two peptide monomers forming a peptide dimer of the invention are dissimilar one to the other, the dimer is referred to as an heterodimer. A heterodimer can be in parallel<br>
'/<br>
or anti-parallel form. Thus, a heterodimer can be composed of two peptide monomers of the same length, differing, for example, in the substitution of an amino acid residue having the L- form to an amino acid residue having the D- form. Alternatively, the lengths of the peptide monomers making up the dimer may be different. In a heterodimer, at least one of the monomers is of formula (I) and generally both are of formula (I).<br>
Preferably, the first and second peptide monomers making up a dimer of the present invention are the same.<br>
Peptides of the invention also include monomers which can be linear or cyclic e.g. wherein at least two contiguously aligned or spaced apart Rg and R8 or cysteine amino acid residues are linked through bridges between S, SO, SO2, SO3, Se, Te. Preferably, the monomers are linear.<br>
Administration of peptides of the invention by way of, for example, oral administration, intra-tracheal, nasal or parenteral administration gives rise to a measurable modulated immune response, as indicated in the examples herein.<br>
"Epithelial cell lining"   is defined as being the cell lining and associated cells thereto which covers the internal and externals of the body, including the lining of vessels and other small cavities. For the purposes of the  surfaceresent invention the epithelial cell lining is regarded as being at least one cell layer in depth and as many as several cell layers deep. Cells included within the ambit of "epithelial cell lining" also includes those cells and specialised lymphoid tissues which are located in or associated with the said epithelial cell lining and which influence the immune response such as T- lymphocytes, B- lymphocytes, enterocytes, NK-cells, monocytes, dendritic cells and cells comprising mucosal associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), such as Peyer's patches and the like. Thus, the skilled addressee will appreciate that so-called migratory cells, such as T- and B- lymphocytes which can be regarded as transient resident cells of the epithelial cell lining as defined above are included within the ambit of the definition of epithelial cell lining. The peptides of the invention may be absorbed by the epithelial cell lining in a passive or active sense. For example, the peptides may be absorbed on the cell surface, or actively or passively taken up by cells located on the lumen surface side of the epithelial cell lining , or they may pass inbetween cells located on the lumen surface side of the epithelial cell lining and are taken up by cells located deeper in the epithelial cell lining eg T-lymphocytes or Peyer's patches. The skilled addressee will also appreciate that "absorption" as defined herein also includes the situation wherein peptides of the invention initiate an immune response by interacting with cell surface receptors found in or on the membranes of certain specialised cells located in the epithelial cell lining, such as on enterocytes, and intra-epithelial lymphocytes, without physically penetrating the epithelial cell lining. Thus, the skilled addressee will understand that peptides of the invention may interact with, bind to, pass through or penetrate the epithelial cell lining.<br>
The peptides of the invention are preferably administered by oral, nasal, or intra-tracheal administration in oral, nasal or intra-tracheal dosage forms. It has been found that the amount of a peptide of the invention required to produce a given therapeutic effect when orally administered can be significantly lower than that required to produce the same effect via other types of administration, such as parenteral administration.<br>
In a fUrther aspect of the invention there is provided an oral dosage form comprising at least one immunomodulatory peptide according to the invention, the at least one peptide being absorbable by the epithelial cell lining of the gastrointestinal tract in a mammal resulting in a modulated immune response and thereby a therapeutic effect against disease.<br>

In a further aspect of the invention there is provided an intra-tracheal dosage form comprising at least one immunomodulatory peptide according to the invention, the at least one peptide being absorbable by the epithelial cell lining of the lung in a mammal resulting in a modulated immune response and thereby a therapeutic effect against disease.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention there is provided an intra-tracheal dosage form comprising at least one immunomodulatory peptide according to the invention, the at least one peptide being absorbable by the epithelial cell lining of the lung in a mammal resulting in a modulated immune response and thereby a therapeutic effect against disease wherein the amount of the at least one intra-tracheally administered peptide needed to induce an observable level of modulated immune response in a mammal is less than the amount of the same at least one peptide administered parenterally and needed to achieve a similar<br>
'!<br>
observable level of modulated immune response in the said mammal.<br>
Peptides of the invention contain 3 to 30 amino acid residues in the or each sequence of formula (I). Generally, the or each peptide sequence is from 4 amino acid residues up to 30 amino acid residues in length. Preferably, the or each peptide sequence is from 4 amino acid residues to about 20 amino acid residues in length. More preferably, the or each peptide sequence is from 4 to 15 amino acids in length (e.g. 4 to 10 or 4 to 9), and, most preferably, from 4 to 7 amino acids in length. For example, the peptide sequences can be 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 amino acid residues in length, with or without protecting groups.<br>
The peptides of the invention may or may not be associated with transport agents as defined herein. Preferably, the peptides of the invention are administered in a "naked" form ie free from added transport agents. Added transport agents are those with which the peptides of the invention are intentionally placed in contact or in association either before, during or immediately after administration and which may serve to improve absorption and/or improve the stability of the peptide.<br>
Thus, in one preferment there is provided a physiologically active peptide according to the invention free from added transport agents.<br>

The amount of a peptide according to the invention which is required in cancer or rheumatoid arthritis therapy will, of course, vary and is ultimately at the discretion of the medical or veterinary practitioner. The factors to be considered include the condition being treated, the route of administration, and nature of the formulation, the mammal's body weight, surface area, age, and general condition and the particular peptide to be administered. A suitable effective dose of peptides of the invention generally Iles in the range of from about 0.0001 umol/kg to about lOOOumol/kg body weight, preferably from about 0.003 to about 300 jxmol/kg body weight, e.g. in the range of from about 0.001 to 100 umol/kg bodyweight, for example, 0.03 to 3.0 umol/kg body weight. The total dose may be given as a single dose or multiple doses, e.g two to six times per day. For example, for a 75 kg mammal (e.g. a human) the dose range would be about 2.25 umol/kg/day to 225 umol/kg/day and a typical dose could be about 100 umol of peptide. If discrete multiple doses are indicated treatment might typically be 25 umol of a peptide of the invention given up to 4 times per day. In an alternative administrative regimen, peptides of<br>
the invention may be given on alternate days or even once or twice a week. The skilled addressee will appreciate that an appropriate administrative regimen would be at the discretion of the physician or veterinary practitioner.<br>
Whilst it is possible for the active peptide to be administered alone, it may be preferable to present the active peptide in a pharmaceutical formulation. Formulations of the present invention, for medical use, comprise a peptide of the invention or a salt thereof together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The carrier(s) should be pharmaceutically acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and substantially non-deleterious to the recipient thereof. The skilled addressee will appreciate that free acid addition salts (e.g. hydro-halo salts) of peptides referred to herein as well as base salts are encompassed within the ambit of the invention. Most preferably the salts will be pharmaceutically acceptable.<br>
Suitable acid addition salts include those formed from hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, perchloric, sulphuric, citric, tartaric, phosphoric, lactic, benzoic, glutamic, oxalic, aspartic, pyruvic, acetic, succinic, fumaric, maleic, oxaloacetic, isethionic, stearic, phthalic, methanesulphonic, p-toluene sulphonic, benzenesulphonic, lactobionic, glucuronic and trifluoracetic acids. Suitable base salts include inorganic base salts such as alkali metal (e.g. sodium and potassium) salts and alkaline earth metal (e.g. calcium) salts; organic base salts e.g. phenylethylbenzylamine, dibenzylethylenediamine, ethanolamine and diethanolamine salts; and amino acid salts e.g. lysine and arginine. Most preferably, the salts will be pharmaceutically acceptable.<br>
The present invention, therefore, further provides a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a peptide of the invention together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor.<br>
Naturally, the skilled addressee will appreciate that any pharmaceutical formulation comprising a peptide of the invention can include more than one peptide of the invention.<br>
Thus, a pharmaceutical formulation may comprise at least two peptides of the invention or a cocktail of peptides of the invention.<br>
There is also provided a method for the preparation of a pharmaceutical formulation comprising bringing into association one or more peptides of the invention, or a physiologically functional derivative thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor.<br>
The peptides of the invention and physiologically functional derivatives thereof may be administered by any route appropriate to the condition to be treated, suitable routes including oral, intra-tracheal, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal, and parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, intrathecal, intraperitoneal, and epidural). It will be appreciated that the route may vary with, for example, the condition of the recipient. Preferred formulations are those suitable for oral, nasal or intra-tracheal administration. Most preferred formulations are those suitable for oral administration.<br>
Formulations for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the peptide(s) in a flavoured basis, usually sucrose and acacia and tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouth washes comprising the peptide(s) in a suitable liquid carrier.<br>
Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets, tablets, lozenges comprising the peptide(s) in a flavoured base, usually sucrose and acacia and tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient(s) in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouth washes comprising the active ingredient(s) in a suitable liquid carrier. Each formulation generally contains a predetermined amount of the active peptide(s); as a powder or granules; or a solution or suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid such as a syrup, an elixir, an emulsion or draught and the like.<br>
A tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active peptide(s) in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, '(eg povidone, gelatin, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose), lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, disintegrant (e.g. sodium starch glycollate, cross-linked povidone, cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), surface active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered peptide(s) moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile.<br>
A syrup may be made by adding the active peptide(s) to a concentrated, aqueous solution of a sugar, for example, sucrose, to which may also be added any necessary ingredients. Such accessory ingredient(s) may include flavourings, an agent to retard crystallisation of the sugar or an agent to increase the solubility of any other ingredients, such as a polyhydric alcohol, for example, glycerol or sorbitol.<br>
In addition to the aforementioned ingredients, the formulations of this invention may further include one or more accessory ingredient(s) selected from diluents, buffers, flavouring agents, binders, surface active agents, thickeners, lubricants, preservatives, (including antioxidants) and the like.<br>
Emulgents and emulsion stabilisers suitable for use in the formulation of the present invention include Tween 60, Span 80, cetostearyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl mono-stearate and sodium lauryl sulphate.<br>
The choice of suitable oils or fats for the formulation is based on achieving the desired therapeutic properties, since the solubility of the active compound in most oils likely to be<br>
used in pharmaceutical emulsion formulations is low. Thus the cream should preferably be a non-greasy, non-staining and washable product with suitable consistency to avoid leakage from tubes or other containers. Straight or branched chain, mono- or dibasic alkyl esters such as di-isoadipate, isocetyl stearate, propylene glycol diester of coconut fatty acids, isopropyl myristate, decyl oleate, isopropyl palmitate, butyl stearate, 2-ethylhexyl palmitate, or a blend of branch-chained esters known as Crodamol CAP may be used, the last three being preferred esters. These may be used alone or in combination depending on the properties required. Alternatively, high melting point lipids such as white soft parafin and/or liquid parafin or other mineral oils can be used.<br>
Formulations for rectal administration may be presented in any suitable form e.g. as a suppository with a suitable base comprising peptide(s) of the invention in admixture with a neutral fatty base, for example cocoa butter, or, for example in admixture with a salicylate, or in the form of solutions and suspensions. In an alternative, formulations in the form of gelatin rectal capsules comprising active peptide(s) of the invention in admixture with vegetable oil(s) or paraffin oil can be used.<br>
Formulations suitable for nasal administration wherein the carrier is a solid include a coarse powder having a particle size for example in the range 20 to 500 microns. Where the particle size relates to an active substance in particle form per se, the particle size may be in the range of from 2 to 500 microns. Coarse powder formulations can be administered by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held up close to the nose. Suitable formulations wherein the carrier is a liquid, for administration as for example a nasal spray or as nasal drops, include aqueous or oily solutions of the active ingredient. Thus, peptides of the invention may be formulated in pressurised metered dose inhalers or dry powder inhalers for oral or nasal inhalation or in liquid formulations for nebulisation. The active peptide(s) is micronised or otherwise processed to a particle size suitable for inhalation therapy (mass median diameter 
In the case of pressurised metered dose inhalers the micronised peptide(s) can be suspended in a liquefied propellant or a mixture of liquefied propellants. Such propellants can also, but not necessarily act as solvents. In either case, the micronised peptide(s) can be filled into a container equipped, for example with a metering valve.<br>
Suitable propellants include those commonly employed in the art, such as, hydrofluoroalkanes (HFAs). The HFA propellants can be present in any mixture which is appropriate for delivering peptide(s) of the invention to MALT. Examples of suitable HFAs for use in the invention include tetrafluoroethane (eg propellant 134a (Hoechst)) and heptafluoropropane (eg propellant 227 (Hoechst)). Naturally, the skilled addressee will appreciate that appropriate concentrations of surfactants can also be present in such formulations, for example, sorbitan trioleate, lecithin, oleic acid and the like, the use of surfactants being to increase the physical stability of the peptide(s) preparation. The formulation can also contain solvents, such as ethanol, to improve the solubility of the peptide(s) in the chosen propellant.<br>
Active peptides of the invention may be delivered through inhaling devices suitable for dry powder inhalation, such as portable inhaler devices and the like. In such dry powder formulations, the active peptide(s) of the invention can be used either alone or in combination with a carrier, such as lactose, mannitol, or glucose. The selection of carrier is not critical, provided that the physiological action of the peptide(s) of the invention is substantially unimpaired. Other additives may also be included in powder formulations as required e.g. to maintain stability etc. Again, such additives should be such so as not to substantially interfere with the physiological and hence therapeutic effect of the peptide(s) of the invention. The inhaling device can be of any type known in the art, such as a single dose inhaler having a predetermined dose or a multi-dose inhaler wherein the dose is measured by a metering unit within the inhaler or is delivered from an assembly of predetermined doses.<br>
Formulations suitable for parenteral administration conveniently comprise a sterile aqueous preparation of the active compound which is preferably isotonic with the blood of the recipient. Such formulations suitably comprise a solution of a pharmaceutically and pharmacologically acceptable acid addition salt of a peptide(s) of the invention that is isotonic with the blood of the recipient.<br>
Useful formulations also comprise concentrated solutions or solids containing peptide(s) of the invention which upon dilution with an appropriate solvent give a solution for parenteral administration as above.<br>
The invention will now be illustrated by the following non-limiting examples.<br>
It is to be understood that where no group is shown at the N- and C- terminals of peptides of the invention herein described that the N-terminal is in the amino form (NH2) and that the C-terminal is in the carboxyl form (-COOH).<br>

The synthesizer worked with consecutive deblocking, washing and coupling cycles consisting of 8 min recycling with 20% piperidine/DMF for each Fmoc-deblocking followed, after wash, by activation of the Na-Fmoc-protected L-amino acid pentafluorophenyl ester (0.8 mmol) with HOBT (0.9 mmol). For D-methionine the Na-Fmoc-met-OH derivative was used which was coupled to aminoacids on the resin with HOBT (0.9 mmol) and DIPCDI (0.9 mmol). The activated amino acids were added to the column and recycled 30 min each. The synthesizer ended the synthesis with a deblocking of the N-terminal Fmoc-group and a final wash with DMF. The resulting peptide on the resin was transferred to a sintered glas runnel where it was washed twice with MeOH (2 x 10 ml) and three times with CH2C12 (3x10 ml). The resin was allowed to dry under vacuum over night after which the peptide was side chained deprotected and cleaved from the resin using ethanedithiol/TFA 5/95 (20 ml) at room temperature for 3 h. The resin was filtered off and washed with 3 x 10 ml of acetic acid. The combined acidic fraction was evaporated after which the residue was triturated 3 times with ether.<br>
The crude peptide was dissolved in H20/CH3CN 1/1 and lyophilized. The resulting material was purified on HPLC using a Gilson 305 and 306 HPLC system with a Kromasil 100-5C18 25 cm x 20 mm id reversed phase column (0.1% TFA/CH3CN - 0.1% TFA/H2O 90 -10, 10 ml/min, 220 nm). The combined HPLC fraction was lyophilized leaving 63 mg of the title compound.<br>

Example 147:Delayed Type Hypersensitivity (DTTD Test This test was used to show immunomodulatory activity.<br>
The ability of the peptides according to the invention to modulate immune responses can be illustrated by their effect in the delayed type hypersensitivity (DTK) test in mice. The DTH test is used to illustrate immunomodulation, the protocol for which is described, for example, by Carlsten H., et al (1986) Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol 81:322, herein incorporated by reference. The peptides were tested at one or more of the following dosages: 0.0003 µmol/kg, 0.003 µmol/kg, 0.03 µmol/kg, 0.3 µmol/kg, and 3.0 umol/kg.<br>
Male and female Balb/c mice were obtained from Bomholtsgaard (Denmark) with a weight of 18-20 grams each. 4-Ethoxymethylene-2-phenyloxazolin-5-one (OXA) (Sigma Chemicals) was used as the antigen in the DTH test.<br>
The mice were sensitized, Day 0, by epicutaneous application of 150 µl of an absolute ethanol-acetone (3:1) solution containing 3% OXA on the shaved abdomen. Treatment with peptides according to the invention, or vehicle (phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing a<br>
mixture of Buffer A and Buffer B in the proportion 63%:37% B (Buffer A: Na2HPO4, 0.89<br>
g/lOOml, EDTA 0.05 g/100ml;Buffer B: NaH2P04, 0.69 g/lOOml, EDTA 0.05 g/lOOml)<br>
was initiated by oral feeding immediately after sensitization and continued once daily (a.m) until Day 6. Seven days after sensitization, both ears of all mice were challenged on both sides by topical application of 20 [i\ 1% OXA dissolved in peanut oil. Ear thickness was measured prior to and at 24hrs or 48 hrs after challenge using an Oditest spring calliper. Challenges and measurements were performed under light pentobarbital anaesthesia.<br>
The intensity of the DTH reactions was measured according to the method described by van Loveren H., et al (1984) J. Immunol. Methods 67: 311 and expressed according to the formula: Tt24/48  Tto urn units, where tO, t24 and t48 represent the ear thickness at time 0, +24hrs or +48 hrs after challenge respectively, in individual tests (T). The results are expressed as the mean +/- S.E.M.. The level of significance between means of the groups is obtained by Student's two-tailed t-test. The immunomodulating effect of the peptide is reflected in a significant difference in the increase or decrease in ear thickness as compared to the control (phosphate buffer).<br>
The peptides of Examples 3,4,17 to 19,21 to 24, 29, 31 to 35, 37, 40,42 to 56, 58, 69 to 71, 73 to 82, 84 to 90, 92, 93, 95, 97, 101 to 104 and 132 to 146 were tested using the DTH test. Some of the peptides were found to exhibit very good effect, good effect or to be effective in this particular test and some were found to exhibit little toward no effect compared with the control in this particular test.<br><br><br>
