The following specification describes the disclosure and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
The disclosure relates to amplified fluorescence polymers (AFPs) with pendant functional groups, their derivatives, synthesis and applications in sensors.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
Amplified fluorescence polymers belong to an important class of polymers which fluoresce in solid state and hence make them a potential candidate for sensing application. A classical example of these polymers is the sensor developed by Prof. Swager's groups and U.S. Patent publication No. US20070081921 describes these polymers in detail.<br>
The inherent disadvantages of the above mentioned synthetic strategy for the design of AFPs are the inability of the final polymers to be modified further. In other words, the final polymers do not exhibit pendant functionality which is easy to modify to incorporate various chemical and biological receptors after the polymerization. This means that all the modifications have to be carried out at the monomer stage followed by polymerization to get the final AFPs. This limits the possible applications derived from the AFP, as most of the antibodies, proteins, nucleic acid derivitizations on these polymers can be performed only after post polymerization. Usually, polymerization of AFPs is through harsh palladium catalysis, which cannot tolerate any acid, alcohol, amine, carbonyl, aldehyde, and amide functional groups. Almost all biological systems contain, one of the above stated functional groups and hence, post polymerization pendant groups will enhance the scope AFPs by many fold.<br>
It would have been of tremendous advantage if it is possible to design AFPs with pendant functional groups which can be modified after the polymerization without protection-deprotection strategy. In this direction, we report the syntheses and characterization of a series of AFPs with pendant propargyl functional group which can be modified using "click" chemistry after the polymer has been formed and purified. The demonstrated applications of the pendant AFPs, show a great promise for development of future<br>

In an embodiment of the disclosure, the amplified fluorescent polymers (AFP) described and synthesized herein have advantages over prior arts in terms of:<br>
1.	Ease of the syntheses of AFPs with pendant functional group capable of undergoing "Click" chemistry after the polymerization.<br>
2.	Possibility of post polymerization functionalization to incorporate chemical and biological receptors in order to design and fabricate chemical and biochemical sensors.<br>
Applications of the polymer:<br>
In yet another embodiment of the disclosure, the polymer of formula I and II can be used in following applications<br>
1. For detection of electrophile<br>
The below molecule is synthesized to detect electrophiles (AFP chemical sensor). The t-butyldimethylsilyl functional group reacts with any electrophile and forms a positively charged cyclic product, which forms a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) paid with the polymer. When the polymer is excited, the fluorescence from polymer is transferred to the newly formed fluorescent if strong electrophiles are present and if no electrophiles are present, the polymer gives the emission.<br>
12<br><br><br>
Following polymer was dissolved in dichloromethane and a strong electrophile (diisopropyl ethyl fluoro phosphate (DFP)) was exposed at 1-14 ppm. The polymer was excited at 360 nm and it has emission maximum at 383 nm and 404 nm. The cyclized product (formed by a bond between naphthyl ring and pyridine ring due to intramolecular cyclization) has absorption maximum at 400 nm and gives fluorescence emission at 450 nm. The cyclized product formation initiates a FRET between the polymer and cyclized produce with which the excitation at 360 nm results in increase of emission at 450 nm and reduction of emission of polymer at 383 and 404 nm. It was observed that, only strong electrolytes like DFP give the 450 nm peak and weak electrolytes like methyl parathion and ethyl paraoxon does not give any signal indicating it is a specific sensor for strong electrolytes. Strong electrolytes are concentrated acids like HNO3, H2SO4, HO, thionyJ chloride etc are not commonly present in atmosphere.<br><br>
The AFP polymer was dissolved in dichloromethane and a strong electrophile (diisopropyl ethyl fluoro phosphate (DFP)) was exposed at 1-14 ppm. The polymer was excited at 360 nm and it has emission maximum at 383 nm and 404 nm. When the polymer was exposed with DFP, there is a gradual decrease of fluorescence intensity at 383 nm and 404 nm, and a new peak at 450 nm, indicating formation of a new fluorescence species, which absorbs in the polymer emission region (383 &amp; 404 nm) and emits at 450 nm.<br>

Ab = Antibody        Fl - E = Fluorescent analogue of effluent<br>
The target effluent will be competing with the antibody bound fluorescent compound and the displacement of fluorescent analogue of target effluent compound is monitored by FRET.<br>
3.   For detection of specific contaminants in milk.<br>
Adulteration of milk is a serious concern and contaminants need to be identified at very low concentrations.<br><br><br>

4. Quantization of protein related to kidney injury.<br>
The biomarkers for acute and chronic kidney injury are Cystatin C and NGAL. Both these proteins are difficult to assay and methods for their assay are needed. The present disclosure provides a method for the same given in the steps below. Step 1: To the polymer containing decanoic acid, NGAL sample is added and incubated protein bound polymer is taken to step 2.<br><br><br>
COOH<br><br>
16<br><br>
Polymer to detect and quantitate NGAL<br><br>
Step 2:  Here the NGAL specific antibody labeled with a fluorescent molecule is added and incubated.<br>
The fluorescent molecule on antibody and the fluorescence form polymer form a FRET pair. There is an increase in FRET signal corresponding to concentration of NGAL.<br>
5. Quantification of proteins related to cardiovascular disease and cancer<br>
There are protein biomarkers which can predict more accurately about Heart attack and<br>
cancer. It is important to target these protein biomarkers for prediction of cardiovascular<br>
diseases and cancer.<br>
Below approach will be used to target any protein biomarker related to cardiovascular<br>
diseases and cancer.<br>
Genes responsible for cancer and cardiovascular disease<br>
Genes of interest will be amplified by RT - PCR The probes are tagged with single fluorescent probe and attached to the polymer by Click chemistry<br><br><br><br>
Acid and amine condensation<br><br>
The polymer and fluorescent probe on the probe term a FRET pair and as the PCR cycles go on, the FRET signal will decrease.<br>
6. Identification of infectious disease based on PCR.<br>
RT- PCR revolutionized the disease diagnosis the inherent drawback of RT - PCR is reliance in fluorescence probes labeled on both sides of the sequence (TAQMAN chemistry). TAQMAN probes are selective but at same point multiplexing is impossible. Secondly, the background fluorescence complicates the diagnosis.<br><br><br><br>
Monomer is shown, two dots would represent repeating units relating to polymer.<br><br>
CS = Complementary sequence	P = Probe (Fluorescent probe which is a FRET<br>
pair with polymer)<br>
18<br><br>
Whenever PCR cycle goes one probe is cut and corresponding FRET is lost, as the PCR cycles increase, there will be decrease in FRET signal, which indicates positive discrete signal.<br>
7.	Target DNA amplification for any human disease or health condition.<br>
Method is as described in previous method using PCR<br>
8.	For simultaneous identification of multiple biomarkers for organ specific diseases<br>
The polymer back bone is made in such a way that there are multiple ligands attached to polymer when any sample, saliva, serum or urine was added multiple proteins bind to corresponding ligands this way we develop antibodies tagged to fluorescent compounds for these proteins and each form an individual FRET pair with same excitation, preferably at the excitation wavelength of the polymer.<br>
The polymer can be used in medical devices, chips, sensors, dipsticks, remote control systems for agricultural, clinical and animal husbandry applications, field devices, and on-board sensors.<br>
9. For detection of pesticide;<br><br><br>
Emition<br>
Excitation<br><br>
Monomer is shown, two dots would represent repeating units relating to polymer.<br><br>
Ab = Target antibody     Fl-P = Fluorescent analogue of target pesticide<br>
The target pesticide will be competing with the antibody based fluorescent compound and the displacement of fluorescent analogue of target is monitored by FRET.<br>
Sensor:<br>
A sensor is made by coating the polymer on a chip or a film or a strip or any other solid surface, which will come in contact with analyte<br>
The coating of polymer on the solid surface is done by dissolving polymer in a solvent and drying the polymer on the surface of the solid. The coated polymer could be formula I or Formula II or Formula III compound. If the coated polymer is Formula I or Formula II, then it is derivitized with an appropriate compound with "Q" and then treated with the analyte. The formula III compound will be directly exposed to the analyte.<br>
The disclosure is further elaborated with the help of following examples. However, these examples should not be construed to limit the scope of disclosure.<br>
