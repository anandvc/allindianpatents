				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed, in general, to packet-based networks and, more specifically,<br>
to methods and apparatus for limiting congestion in packet-based networks, particularly for<br>
controlling the transmission of voice traffic.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In a conventional packet-oriented Internet Protocol (IP) network, there is no guarantee of<br>
sufficient end-to-end bandwidth. Communication end points inject traffic into the network on a<br>
"best effort" basis. This means that the communication endpoints inject traffic into the network,<br>
but the network backbone might drop packets when not enough bandwidth is available to<br>
transport all the traffic injected by all the communication endpoints.<br>
IP protocols, such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), are optimized to cope with certain<br>
behavior of transmission equipment. Such protocols can i) increase the bandwidth injected by<br>
transmission equipment, such as a host, as long as bandwidth in the transmission media<br>
between routers, or network nodes, is available (i.e. no packets are dropped), ii) retransmit lost<br>
packets, and iii) reduce the traffic injected when packets begin to be lost. With this interaction<br>
of router behavior (dropping packets) and end-point behavior (reacting on dropped packets by<br>
retransmission and injection of less traffic), a feedback mechanism is established. To avoid<br>
oscillation of this feedback mechanism, active queue management algorithms such as Random<br>
Early Detect / Random Early Drop (RED) have been utilized; see, for example, Random Early<br>
Detection Gateways for Congestion Avoidance. Floyd, S., and Jacobson, V.; IEEE/ACM<br>
Transactions on Networking, Volume 1, Number 4, August 1993, pp. 397-413. RED algorithms<br>
monitor the queue used to buffer packets before they are transmitted.<br>
The need to handle different packet flows with different precedence has been addressed by<br>
Differentiated Service (DiffServ) models. According to some differentiated service models,<br>
there are three general classes of data traffic; Best Effort (BE), Assured Forwarding (AF) and<br>
Expedited Forwarding (EF). The BE class of data traffic has no guarantee of packet delivery.<br>
AF traffic takes precedence over BE traffic, and bursts of traffic are preferably stored in queues<br>
for delayed transmission rather than being discarded. For BE and AF traffic, active queue<br>
management algorithms, such as RED, are required. EF traffic takes precedence over both BE<br>
and AF traffic, and is very delay sensitive. For EF traffic (such as voice traffic), delay must be<br>
minimized and, if congestion occurs, packets are dropped rather than delayed, since it is<br>
assumed that a delayed packet is of no use for the receiver. Since EF traffic relies on short<br>
queues, the conventional RED algorithm is not a suitable method to monitor and react to<br>
network congestion situations.<br>
Because EF-type traffic, which requires low delay and jitter from the transport technology,<br>
cannot use conventional queue-based RED to detect network congestion, alternative methods<br>
have been considered to control the network load of EF traffic. In one method, based on EF per<br>
hop behavior, an end-to-end resource (i.e. bandwidth) reservation is assumed, which means that<br>
either a fixed amount of bandwidth is reserved for EF traffic between each pair of end points,<br>
or that there is a network protocol that allows dynamic reservation between any two<br>
communication endpoints. Both schemes, however, have drawbacks. First, the fixed reservation<br>
scheme results in poor utilization of bandwidth and heavy overprovisioning because the<br>
network has to be dimensioned for the worst possible scenarios. Second, the dynamic<br>
reservation protocol scheme adds a new dimension of complexity and state to the otherwise<br>
stateless network model.<br>
A practical network that transports EF traffic often uses a weak version of the fixed reservation<br>
scheme, similar to the one used for traditional BE traffic; the network is dimensioned for<br>
normal load cases plus a certain overprovisioning factor that covers for unusual traffic patterns.<br>
This scheme, however, can lead to cases where an intermediate router or link gets congested if<br>
very unusual traffic patterns occur. For example, a network may have capacity of 5000 Erlangs<br>
between a router and Media Gateways (MGWs) within the same geographical region, such as<br>
the east or west coast regions of the United States, and 1000 Erlangs between a router in the<br>
west coast region and a router in the east coast region. Under normal call conditions, most<br>
traffic is expected to stay local to the west or east coast regions, where the network capacity is<br>
5000 Erlangs, and the link between the east and west coast region routers, having a capacity of<br>
only 1000 Erlangs, is not capable of handling worst-case traffic. During abnormal conditions<br>
(e.g. sports events with thousands of fans traveling and phoning home), however, the normal<br>
traffic pattern might change dramatically, overloading the network between the west coast and<br>
east coast region routers.<br>
The IP protocol is a connectionless protocol, so when a new voice call is established it is<br>
unknown whether there is sufficient network capacity between source and destination MGWs<br>
and, thus, all calls are admitted to the network. The result can be insufficient capacity of<br>
intermediate links, and the routers must discard packets randomly. All calls are affected by the<br>
overload, and each user will experience bad voice quality due to dropped voice packets. In a<br>
worst-case scenario, this condition might persist for several hours if callers hang up and retry<br>
persistently, resulting in a completely unusable voice network. RED and similar protocols use<br>
the length of queues in a router to determine whether the router is in an overload situation. This<br>
works well as long as there are queues to monitor, so it is an appropriate method for BE and AF<br>
traffic. Weighted RED (WRED) works like RED, but allows different treatment of packets in<br>
the same queue. The differentiation is normally done based on information, such as the<br>
DiffServ Code Point or protocol field.<br>
Figures 1-A and 1-B illustrate an exemplary use of RED for EF-type traffic. Depending on the<br>
queue fill level (shown on the horizontal axis), 0% to 100% of the packets in a queue are<br>
dropped (or marked). In the illustration, there are two profiles for different kinds of traffic: the<br>
first profile (Figure 1-A) is used for voice traffic, where no packets are dropped (marked) until<br>
the queue is full, and the second profile (Figure 1-B) is used for supervision traffic. As shown if<br>
Figure 1-B, even if the queue is only slightly filled, a small percentage of supervision traffic is<br>
dropped and, as the queue fills, a progressively-greater percentage of supervision packets are<br>
dropped. For EF traffic, however, it is desirable to keep the queue length to a minimum to<br>
minimize delay in packet transmission. Thus, using queue length as a basis for deciding<br>
whether EF traffic should be limited is not an appropriate measure.<br>
WO 03/013070 discloses a system that prevents from packet flooding in the case of packet<br>
flooding attacks, where an attacker uses up all the bandwidth to a victim. Therefore, a set of<br>
transitively connected cooperating machines build a neighborhood. Sites identify unwanted<br>
data, and ask the routers that forward said unwanted data to reduce the rate at which such<br>
unwanted data is forwarded.<br>
US 2002/181401 A1 discloses a traffic management in packet-based networks using an<br>
allocation of bandwidth, which is based on a count of the number of endpoint connections<br>
associated with a specific service for a corresponding network device. When reading the<br>
maximum allowed connections or bandwidth for a specific service, the network device stops<br>
forwarding any new call by dropping packets of new calls and informing endpoints to<br>
disconnect the new calls. Bandwidth is reserved by periodic queries to determine connection<br>
status and bandwidth allocation of endpoints, and by calculating current bandwidth allocation<br>
for specific type communications service on an interface of the router. Additional<br>
communication traffic is admitted if bandwidth is available.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need in the art for improved methods and apparatus for limiting<br>
congestion in a packet-based network, particularly for controlling the transmission of EF-type<br>
traffic, such as voice traffic; preferably, such improved methods can be easily implemented in<br>
the architecture of existing apparatus.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
To address the above-discussed deficiencies of the prior art, the present invention provides<br>
methods and apparatus for limiting congestion in a packet-based network, particularly for<br>
controlling the transmission of voice traffic. A node in the network, such as a router, transmits<br>
at least one data stream comprising a plurality of data packets to a second node; the data<br>
streams can correspond to existing voice calls being transmitted through the network. The<br>
bandwidth utilization between the first node and second node is determined, and supervision<br>
packets are forwarded from the first node to the second node at a rate that is a function of the<br>
bandwidth utilization, the rate being inversely-proportional to the bandwidth utilization. At the<br>
second node, the congestion of the network can be determined based on the rate at which the<br>
supervision packets are received and, if the congestion exceeds a predefined threshold, the<br>
establishment of new voice calls through the second node and into the network can be limited.<br>
In general, the method for limiting congestion in a packet-based network includes the steps of:<br>
1) transmitting at least one data stream comprising a plurality of data packets from a first node<br>
to a second node of the network; 2) determining the bandwidth utilization of the network<br>
between the first node and the second node; and 3) forwarding supervision packets from the<br>
first node to the second node, wherein the supervision packets are forwarded at a rate that is a<br>
function of the bandwidth utilization, the rate being inversely-proportional to the bandwidth<br>
utilization. By dropping supervision packets in high load situations, and thus effectively<br>
reducing the rate at which supervision packets are forwarded, more bandwidth is available for<br>
the transmission of data packets, thereby alleviating congestion in the network.<br>
In a first exemplary embodiment, the step of forwarding supervision packets includes the steps<br>
of: 1) selecting a drop profile for supervision packets, wherein the drop profile defines a<br>
percentage of packets that will be dropped as a function of bandwidth utilization, and wherein<br>
the drop percentage increases as bandwidth utilized for payload traffic increases; and 2)<br>
applying the drop profile to supervision packets so that the percentage of received supervision<br>
packets defined by the drop profile is forwarded to the second node. A drop profile can be<br>
defined, for example, using a data table or an algorithm.<br>
In a second exemplary embodiment, the step of forwarding supervision packets includes the<br>
steps of: 1) selecting a first (queue-length based) RED drop profile for the supervision packets,<br>
the first drop profile defining a first drop rate at which supervision packets will be dropped for<br>
transmission; and 2) selecting a second (queue-length based) RED drop profile for the<br>
supervision packets when the bandwidth utilization exceeds a predefined value, the second<br>
drop profile defining a second drop rate at which supervision packets will be dropped for<br>
transmission, wherein the second drop rate exceeds the first drop rate; and 3) applying one of<br>
these drop profiles to supervision packets, as a function of bandwidth utilization, so that the<br>
percentage of received supervision packets defined by the selected drop profile is forwarded to<br>
the second node. Additional drop profiles can be defined for additional predefined values for<br>
bandwidth utilization, thereby allowing for dynamic modification of the forwarding rate of<br>
supervision packets.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the step of determining the bandwidth utilization of the packet-<br>
based network between the first node and the second node includes the steps of: 1) measuring<br>
the transmission rate of data packets from the first node to the second node; and 2) comparing<br>
the transmission rate to the maximum bandwidth of the packet-based network between the first<br>
node and the second node. If the data streams are associated with different packet classes, the<br>
step of determining the bandwidth utilization can include the steps of: 1) measuring the<br>
transmission rate from the first node to the second node of data packets corresponding to each<br>
packet class; and 2) comparing the transmission rate of data packets corresponding to each<br>
packet class to a maximum bandwidth defined for each packet class. A packet class can be<br>
associated, for example, with data packets containing voice data.<br>
The principles of the invention are most suitably implemented in a router for routing data<br>
packets in a packet-based network. An exemplary router in accordance with the principles of<br>
the invention includes: 1) means for receiving at least one data stream comprising a plurality of<br>
data packets; 2) means for transmitting the at least one data stream comprising a plurality of<br>
data packets to a second node of a packet-based network; 3) means for determining the<br>
bandwidth utilization of the packet-based network between the router and the second node; 4)<br>
means for receiving supervision packets; 5) means for dropping at least a portion of the<br>
supervision packets, wherein the drop rate is a function of and proportional to the bandwidth<br>
utilization; and 6) means for transmitting the supervision packets that are not dropped to the<br>
second node, whereby the forwarding rate of the supervision packets is a function of and<br>
inversely-proportional to the bandwidth utilization<br>
In a first exemplary router, the means for dropping at least a portion of the supervision packets<br>
comprises: 1) means for selecting a drop profile for the supervision packets, wherein the drop<br>
profile defines a percentage of packets that will be dropped as a function of bandwidth<br>
utilization, and wherein the drop percentage increases as bandwidth utilized for payload traffic<br>
increases; and 2) applying this drop profile to supervision packets so that the percentage of<br>
received supervision packets defined by the drop profile is forwarded to the second node.<br>
In a second exemplary router, the means for dropping at least a portion of the supervision<br>
packets comprises: 1) means for selecting a first (queue-length based) RED drop profile for the<br>
supervision packets, the first drop profile defining a first drop rate at which supervision packets<br>
will be dropped for transmission; and 2) means for selecting a second (queue-length based)<br>
RED drop profile for the supervision packets when the bandwidth utilization exceeds a<br>
predefined value, the second drop profile defining a second drop rate at which supervision<br>
packets will be dropped for transmission, wherein the second drop rate exceeds the first drop<br>
rate; and 3) applying one of these drop profiles to supervision packets, as a function of<br>
bandwidth utilization, so that the percentage of received supervision packets defined by the<br>
selected drop profile is forwarded to the second node.<br>
In an exemplary router, the means for determining the bandwidth utilization of the packet-<br>
based network between the first node and the second node comprises: 1) means for measuring<br>
the transmission rate of data packets from the router to the second node; and 2) means for<br>
comparing the transmission rate to the maximum bandwidth of the packet-based network<br>
between the router and the second node. If the data streams are associated with different packet<br>
classes, the means for determining the bandwidth utilization can include: 1) means for<br>
measuring the transmission rate from the first node to the second node of data packets<br>
corresponding to each packet class; and 2) means for comparing the transmission rate of data<br>
packets corresponding to each packet class to a maximum bandwidth defined for each packet<br>
class.<br>
In a particularly advantageous embodiment, the principles of the present invention are utilized<br>
to control the transmission of voice traffic through a packet-based network. In such<br>
embodiments, the invention includes the steps of: 1) receiving at least one data stream<br>
comprising a plurality of voice data packets transmitted from a first node at a second node of<br>
the packet-based network, wherein each of the at least one data stream corresponds to an<br>
existing voice call being transmitted through the packet-based network; 2) receiving<br>
supervision packets forwarded from the first node at the second node, wherein the supervision<br>
packets are forwarded by the first node at a rate that is a function of a bandwidth utilization of<br>
the packet-based network between the first node and the second node, the rate being inversely-<br>
proportional to the bandwidth utilization; 3) determining at the second node, based on the rate<br>
at which the supervision packets are received, the congestion of the packet-based network; and<br>
4) if the congestion of the packet-based network exceeds a predefined threshold, limiting the<br>
establishment of new voice calls through the second node and into the packet-based network.<br>
In a first exemplary embodiment of the invention to control the transmission of voice traffic<br>
through a packet-based network, the forwarding of the supervision packets by the first node<br>
includes the steps of: 1) selecting a drop profile for supervision packets, the drop profile<br>
mapping bandwidth utilization to a percentage of packets that will be dropped, wherein the<br>
drop percentage increases with the amount of bandwidth utilized for payload traffic; and 2)<br>
applying this drop profile to supervision packets so that the percentage of received supervision<br>
packets defined by the drop profile is forwarded to the second node.<br>
In a secondary exemplary embodiment of the invention to control the transmission of voice<br>
traffic through a packet-based network, the forwarding of the supervision packets by the first<br>
node includes the steps of: 1) selecting a first (queue-length based) RED drop profile for the<br>
supervision packets, the first drop profile defining a first drop rate at which supervision packets<br>
will be dropped; and 2) selecting a second (queue-length based) RED drop profile for the<br>
supervision packets when the bandwidth utilization exceeds a predefined value, the second<br>
drop profile defining a second drop rate at which supervision packets will be dropped, wherein<br>
the second drop rate exceeds the first drop rate; and 3) applying one of these drop profiles to<br>
supervision packets, as a function of bandwidth utilization, so that the percentage of received<br>
supervision packets defined by the drop profile is forwarded to the second node.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention to control the transmission of voice traffic<br>
through a packet-based network, the step of determining the bandwidth utilization of the<br>
packet-based network between the first node and the second node includes the steps of: 1)<br>
measuring the transmission rate of voice data packets from the first node to the second node;<br>
and 2) comparing the transmission rate to the maximum bandwidth of the packet-based<br>
network between the first node and the second node. If the data streams are associated with<br>
different packet classes, the step of determining the bandwidth utilization can include the steps<br>
of: 1) measuring the transmission rate from the first node to the second node of voice data<br>

The foregoing has outlined, rather broadly, the principles of the present invention so that those<br>
skilled in the art may better understand the detailed description of the exemplary embodiments<br>
that follow. Those skilled in the art should appreciate that they can readily use the disclosed<br>
conception and exemplary embodiments as a basis for designing or modifying other structures<br>
and methods for carrying out the same purposes of the present invention. Those skilled in the<br>
art should also realize that such equivalent constructions do not depart from the spirit and scope<br>
of the invention in its broadest form.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
For a more complete understanding of the principles of the present invention, reference is now<br>
made to the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying<br>
drawings, in which:<br>
FIGURES 1-A and 1-B illustrate an exemplary prior art use of Random Early Drop (RED) for<br>
Expedited Forwarding (EF) type traffic;<br>
FIGURES 2-A and 2-B illustrate an exemplary use of bandwidth-based RED for Expedited<br>
Forwarding (EF) type traffic in accordance with the principles of the present invention; and<br>
FIGURE 3 illustrates a second exemplary use of bandwidth-based RED for Expedited<br>
Forwarding (EF) type traffic in accordance with the principles of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As described supra, using queue length (of the physical queue) as a basis for controlling<br>
whether EF traffic needs to be limited is not, by itself, an appropriate measure, because a<br>
significant packet queue indicates that EF traffic was above the maximum amount of EF traffic<br>
allowed by the scheduler for some time, when it is possibly too late to recover without packet<br>
losses. Thus, for EF traffic, another mechanism than RED, based solely on queue length, is<br>
needed. The invention provides a new mechanism to early detect abnormal traffic patterns for<br>
high-priority delay sensitive traffic, such as DiffServ EF marked IP packets. The mechanism<br>
can be used to detect traffic overload for EF traffic before end users notice any packet drop of<br>
payload traffic, and it is implemented by controlling the packet drop rate of probing traffic (i.e.,<br>
supervision packets). The mechanism can also be used for call admission control in<br>
connectionless IP networks, without the need for bandwidth reservation. Although the<br>
mechanism is similar to RED, the novelty is that packet drop is not triggered solely by queue<br>
length, but by bandwidth utilization.<br>
The principle of the invention is to adapt a packet transmission scheduler so that the number of<br>
packets (or the bandwidth used by forwarded packets) can be measured. Then, if the scheduler<br>
sees too many packets (or too much bandwidth used), supervision packets are dropped.<br>
Because only packets that are classified with high loss priority (which are used to supervise the<br>
congestion status of the network) are first dropped, the invention can be used to indicate<br>
network congestion to communication endpoints without affecting payload traffic (which then<br>
can be sent with low loss priority). Rather than the conventional queue-based RED mechanism,<br>
the principle of the invention is the novel use of bandwidth-based RED. The bandwidth-based<br>
RED mechanism is characterized by the processes of: 1) determining the current bandwidth<br>
utilization, which can be calculated for each forwarding class; and 2) based on the bandwidth<br>
utilization, marking or dropping supervision packets; i.e., supervision packets are forwarded at<br>
a rate that is a function of the bandwidth utilization, where the rate is inversely-proportional to<br>
the bandwidth utilization. Different drop profiles can be used for different traffic types.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the first step is to calculate the current bandwidth utilization,<br>
which can be performed for each forwarding class. This data is typically provided by the<br>
performance measurement data collected by most conventional routers. A time-window based<br>
algorithm can be used to calculate current bandwidth per forwarding class; both jumping<br>
window and sliding window measurements can be used, although sliding window<br>
measurements should have better results. The window length should be configurable to allow<br>
averaging bandwidth utilization over a certain interval.<br>
An alternative to calculation of the actual bandwidth utilization is to approximate it on the basis<br>
of the number of packets per second. If an average packet length can be assumed, counting<br>
packets can be a useful approximation of actual bandwidth utilization, and counting packets per<br>
second is an easier calculation than summing up packet lengths.<br>
Conventional currently-available routers support WRED based on queue length. Several<br>
profiles can be configured for the same queue, and the matching profile is chosen on a per-<br>
packet basis by use of classification. The drop profiles are configured by configuration<br>
statements and are typically not changed often. Figures 1-A and 1-B illustrate an exemplary<br>
prior art static configuration used by conventional routers. Figure 1-A illustrates a drop profile<br>
for voice traffic, and 1-B illustrates a drop profile for supervision packets, where the drop<br>
profile is a function of queue length.<br>
The basic principle of the invention illustrated in Figures 2-A and 2-B. Figure 2-A illustrates a<br>
drop profile for voice traffic, and 2-B illustrates a drop profile for supervision packets, where<br>
the drop profile is a function of bandwidth utilization. Instead of determining the packet drop<br>
rate based solely on queue length, as done in the examples in Figures 1-A and 1-B, the packet<br>
drop rate is selected as a function of bandwidth utilization. In an exemplary embodiment,<br>
below a configurable threshold, no packets are dropped, while above a certain bandwidth<br>
utilization packets are dropped at an increasing (configurable) rate until it reaches a second<br>
threshold. Above that second threshold, all supervision packets are dropped.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates an alternative implementation where traditional queue-length based drop<br>
profiles are used to achieve the same functionality. The embodiment illustrated is easily<br>
implemented on currently-available routers using queue-length based WRED and measurement<br>
of bandwidth router mechanisms. No hardware modifications should be required, but software<br>
to dynamically change WRED behavior as a function of bandwidth utilization must be<br>
provided. Instead of using a drop profile that relates the packet drop rate only to bandwidth<br>
utilization (as done in Figures 2-1 and 2-B), a set of drop profiles that relate drop rate to queue<br>
length is used. In the example of Figure 3, two different drop profiles for supervision packets,<br>
and one threshold, are shown. As shown in Figure 3, a first drop profile for supervision packets<br>
begins to drop packets when the queue fills up provided the bandwidth utilization is within an<br>
allowed range. A second drop profile begins to drop supervision packets even if the queue is<br>
empty, and is used when bandwidth utilization exceeds a threshold. An additional function is<br>
used to select which of the two drop profiles is applied to supervision packets. As long as the<br>
bandwidth utilization is below a threshold, the drop profile with moderate drop rate is used, so<br>
packets are only dropped when the queues fill up. Above the threshold, the second drop profile<br>
is used, and a certain percentage of supervision packets is dropped, even if the queue is empty.<br>
In other embodiments, additional profiles triggered by different thresholds can be employed.<br>
For example, a configuration that allows dropping 50% of the supervision packets when<br>
bandwidth utilization is above level 1 (even if the queue is empty), and drops 100% of the<br>
supervision packets when bandwidth utilization is above a higher level 2. There are many ways<br>
to implement the dynamic behavior described above in a router. Among the alternatives, two<br>
solutions are preferable: either dynamically reconfigure the drop profile or reconfigure the<br>
packet classifications as a function of bandwidth utilization. For dynamic reconfiguration of the<br>
drop profile, the number of profiles per queue does not need to change, but it is possible to<br>
dynamically change the profile to change the dropping behavior. For dynamic reconfiguration<br>
of the packet classifiers, before a certain drop profile is applied to a packet to be transmitted, it<br>
passes a set of classifiers that determine which profile is to be applied on the packet. In<br>
conventional routers currently available, normally basic and multifield classifiers are supported.<br>
It is possible, however, to increase the number of profiles per forwarding class; e.g., from two<br>
profiles for "payload" and "supervision" packets to three profiles for "payload", "supervision<br>
below threshold" and "supervision above threshold." This would allow dynamic<br>
reconfiguration of the packet classifiers based on bandwidth utilization. When the traffic is<br>
below the threshold, the "supervision below threshold" profile is applied to supervision<br>
packets, and when traffic exceeds the threshold, the classifier is reconfigured to use the<br>
"supervision above threshold" profile.<br>
An ancillary benefit of the invention is that a decrease in the forwarding rate of supervision<br>
packets as bandwidth utilization increases serves as an indicator of congestion in the backbone.<br>
Network nodes controlling the admission of new calls into the network can have a threshold<br>
associated with the rate at which supervision packets are received and, if the rate exceeds the<br>
threshold, the establishment of new calls into the network can be throttled, which helps to<br>
ensure that sufficient bandwidth remains available for all existing calls without dropping voice<br>
packets associated with such calls.<br>
From the foregoing, those skilled in the art will recognize that the present invention provides<br>
improved methods and apparatus for limiting congestion in a packet-based network,<br>
particularly for controlling the transmission of voice traffic. Although the present invention has<br>
