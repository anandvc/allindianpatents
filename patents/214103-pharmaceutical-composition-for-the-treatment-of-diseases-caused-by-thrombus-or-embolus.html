embolus]; to the use of 2-acetoxy-5-(a-cyclopropylcarbonyl-2-fluorobenzyl)-<br>
4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt<br>
thereof and aspirin for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions for<br>
prevention or treatment (particularly for treatment) of diseases caused by<br>
thrombus or embolus; and to methods for the prevention or treatment<br>
(particularly to methods for the treatment) of diseases caused by thrombus or<br>
embolus by administration of an effective amount of 2-acetoxy-5-(a-<br>
cyclopropylcarbonyl-2-fluoroben2yl)-4,5,6,7-tetxahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and aspirin to warm-blooded animals<br>
(particularly humans).<br>
[BACKGROUND ART]<br>
2-Acetoxy-5- (a-cyclopropylcarbonyl-2 -fluorobenzyl) -4,5,6,7-<br>
tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine has been described in the Japanese Patent<br>
Application Publication No. Hei 6-41139, and possesses potent inhibitory<br>
activity against platelet aggregation. Furthermore, aspirin is well known to have<br>
an inhibiting activity against platelet aggregation, although the activity is low.<br>
However, pharmaceutical compositions containing both compounds have not<br>
been known.<br>
[DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION]<br>
The present inventors have studied therapeutic agents with low toxicity<br>
that exert inhibitory activity against platelet aggregation and have found that the<br>
problems described above are solved by using pharmaceutical compositions<br>
comprising 2- acetoxy- 5- (a- cyclopropylcarbonyl-2- fluorobenzyl)-4,5,6,7-<br>
tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof<br>
and aspirin.<br>
The present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions containing<br>
2-acetoxy-5-(a-cyclopropylcarbonyl-2-fluorobenzyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-<br>
c]pyridine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and aspirin as active<br>
ingredients [particularly pharmaceutical compositions for prevention or<br>
treatment (particularly for treatment) of diseases caused by thrombus or<br>
embolus]; the use of 2-acetoxy-5-(a-cyclopropylcarbonyl-2-fluorobenzyl)-4,5,6,7-<br>
tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,<br>
and aspirin, for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions [particularly<br>
pharmaceutical compositions for prevention or treatment (particularly for<br>
treatment) of diseases caused by thrombus or embolus]; and methods for the<br>
prevention or treatment (particularly methods for treatment) of diseases caused<br>
by thrombus or embolus by administration of an effective amount of 2-acetoxy-<br>
5-(a-cyclopropylcarbonyl-2-fluorobenzyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine<br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and aspirin, to warm-blooded<br>
animals (particularly humans), simultaneously or sequentially.<br>
2-Acetoxy-5-(a-cyclopropylcarbonyl-2-fluorobenzyl)-4,5,6,7-<br>
tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof,<br>
which is one of the active ingredients of the present invention, is a known<br>
compound. For instance, the compound has already been described in<br>
Japanese Patent Application Publication No. Hei 6-41139 and Japanese Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 2002-145883 (priority: Japanese Patent Application<br>
No. 2000-205396 and Japanese Patent Application No. 2000-266780). The<br>
chemical structure is described below.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of 2-acetoxy-5-(a-<br>
cyclopropylcarbonyl-2-fluorobenzyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine may<br>
be, for example, hydrohalogenic acid salts such as hydrofluoride, hydrochloride,<br>
hydrobromide or hydroiodide; nitrate; perchlorate; sulfate; phosphate; C1-C4<br>
alkanesulfonates optionally substituted by halogens such as methanesulfonate,<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate; C6-C10 arylsulfonates optionally<br>
substituted by C1-C4 alkyl groups such as benzenesulfonate or p-<br>
toluenesulfonate; C1-C6 aliphatic acid salts such as acetate, malate, fumarate,<br>
succinate, citrate, tartarate, oxalate or maleate; amino acid salts such as glycine<br>
salt, lysine salt, arginine salt, ornitine salt, glutamic acid salt or aspartic acid<br>
salt; and the preferred compounds are hydrohalogenates or C1-C6 aliphatic acid<br>
salts; and more preferred compounds are the hydrochloride or the maleate.<br>
When one of the active ingredients of the present invention, 2-acetoxy-5-<br>
(a-cyclopropylcarbonyl-2-fluorobenzyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine or<br>
a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is allowed to stand so that it is open<br>
to the atmosphere, it may become hydrated by absorption of water or adsorption<br>
of water. Such hydrated compounds are included in the present invention.<br>
Further, one of the active ingredients of the present invention, 2-acetoxy-<br>
5-(a-cyclopropylcarbonyl-2-fluorobenzyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine<br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, may absorb some kinds of organic<br>
solvents and may form solvates in some cases, and these solvates are also<br>
included in the present invention.<br>
Furthermore, since 2-acetoxy-5-(a-cyclopropylcarbonyl-2-fluorobenzyl)-<br>
4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine has an asymmetric carbon atom, optical<br>
isomers exist based on the asymmetric carbon atom. These optical isomers are<br>
also included in the present invention.<br>
The other active ingredient, aspirin, is a well-known compound, as an<br>
analgesic antipyretic.<br>
[INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY]<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention (particularly<br>
pharmaceutical compositions for the prevention or treatment of diseases caused<br>
by thrombus or embolus) which contain 2-acetoxy-5-(a-cyclopropylcarbonyl-2-<br>
fluorobenzyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt thereof, and aspirin, as active ingredients, possess excellent<br>
inhibitory activity against platelet aggregation and thrombogenesis with short<br>
onset latency and low toxicity. Thus the pharmaceutical compositions of the<br>
present invention are useful as preventative or therapeutic agents (particularly<br>
as therapeutic agents) against diseases caused by thrombus or embolus, for<br>
example, diseases induced by platelet aggregation, including stable or unstable<br>
angina pectoris and so forth; cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disorders, e.g.,<br>
thromboembolism, associated with atherosclerosis or diabetes mellitus, such as<br>
unstable angina pectoris, cerebral ischemic insult or restenosis due to<br>
angioplasty, endarterectomy or stent therapy; or thromboembolism caused by<br>
thromboembolization such as recurrent embolism after degradation of the<br>
original thrombus, embolism, ischemia-induced dementia, peripheral<br>
arteriopathy, thromboembolization associated with hemodialysis or atrial<br>
fibrillation, or thromboembolization in the vascular prosthesis, or in the bypass<br>
between the aorta and the coronary artery. Furthermore, the therapeutic agent<br>
of the present invention is administered to warm-blooded animals (particularly<br>
humans).<br>
According, to the present invention, the use in combination of 2-acetoxy-<br>
5-(a-cyclopropylcarbonyl-2-fluorobenzyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine<br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and aspirin, results in more<br>
potent effectiveness than the use of each component alone. Furthermore,<br>
plasma levels of these agents do not have to be maintained at a certain level and<br>
higher during the same period, in order to produce their effects. It is believed<br>
that these 2 agents reach the receptors, at which they act in vivo, and turn on<br>
switches at the receptors to induce the effects. Even though the plasma level of<br>
one component of the pharmaceutical composition is too low to induce the<br>
effects with increasing time after the agent was administered, the switches at<br>
the receptors have already been turned on. Thus the preventative or therapeutic<br>
efficacy of the agent is expected by inhibiting thrombogenesis or embolization.<br>
Therefore, when the other component of the pharmaceutical composition<br>
is administered later, the therapeutic effect of the compound administered later<br>
is expected to add to the therapeutic effects of the previously administered<br>
component. However, it is convenient clinically that both components are<br>
administered at the same time. Thus 2-acetoxy-5-(a-cyclopropylcarbonyl-2-<br>
fluorobenzyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt thereof and aspirin are simultaneously administered as a<br>
combination drug. In the case that both agents cannot be mixed technically,<br>
each component can be administered separately. Moreover, as described<br>
previously, since each component produces significant effects as a single form,<br>
each component can be sequentially administered at appropriate intervals. The<br>
maximum intervals between administration of each of the two components that<br>
can be accepted to elicit significant effects could be confirmed by clinical trials<br>
or animal studies.<br>
The route for administration of 2-acetoxy-5-(a-cyclopropylcarbonyl-2-<br>
fluorobenzyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt, thereof, and aspirin, which is employed in the present invention,<br>
is generally the oral route. However, other routes, for example, intravenous<br>
administration, can be used. Thus, the 2 components can be prepared<br>
respectively as separate formulations, or can be mixed physically to form a<br>
single formulation for administration. The single formulations of the mixed<br>
components are, for example, powders, granules, tablets, capsules and so forth,<br>
and can be prepared by regular formulation techniques, as described below.<br>
These formulations are prepared by conventional methods by using<br>
excipients (organic excipients, for example, sugar derivatives such as lactose,<br>
sucrose, glucose, mannitol or sorbitol; starch derivatives such as corn starch,<br>
potato starch, a-starch or dextrin; cellulose derivatives such as crystalline<br>
cellulose; gum arabic; dextran; or pullulan; and inorganic excipients, for<br>
example, silicate derivatives such as light silicic acid anhydride, synthetic<br>
aluminum silicate, calcium silicate or magnesium aluminate metasilicate;<br>
phosphate derivatives such as calcium hydrogenphosphate; carbonates such as<br>
calcium carbonate; or sulfates such as calcium sulfate), lubricants (for example,<br>
stearic acid; metal stearate derivatives such as calcium stearate or magnesium<br>
stearate; talc; waxes such as beeswax or spermaceti; boric acid; adipic acid;<br>
sulfate derivatives such as sodium sulfate; glycol; fumaric acid; sodium<br>
benzoate; DL-leucine; lauryl sulfate derivatives such as sodium lauryl sulfate or<br>
magnesium lauryl sulfate; silicic acid derivatives such as silicic acid anhydride<br>
or silicic acid hydrate; and starch derivatives described above), binders (for<br>
example, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose,<br>
poly(vinylpyrrolidone), polyethylene glycol and similar compounds described in<br>
the above excipients), disintegrators (for example, cellulose derivatives such as<br>
low substituted hydroxypropylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, calcium<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, internally cross-linked sodium carboxymethylcellulose;<br>
chemically modified starch/cellulose derivatives such as carboxymethylstarch,<br>
sodium carboxymethylstarch; cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone; or starch<br>
derivatives described above), emulsifiers (for example, colloidal clays such as<br>
bentonite or veegum; metal hydroxides such as magnesium hydroxide or<br>
aluminum hydroxide; anionic surfactants such as sodium lauryl sulfate or<br>
calcium stearate; cationic surfactants such as benzalkonium chloride; or<br>
nonionic surfactants such as polyoxyethylene alkyl ether,<br>
polyoxyethylenesorbitan ester of fatty acids or sucrose ester of fatty acids),<br>
stabilizers (for example, parahydroxybenzoates such as methylparaben or<br>
propylparaben; alcohols such as chlorobutanol, benzyl alcohol or phenylethyl<br>
alcohol; benzalkonium chlorides; phenol derivatives such as phenol or cresol;<br>
thimerosal; dehydroacetic acid; or sorbic acid), aorrigents (for example,<br>
sweetening, souring and flavoring agents all of which are conventionally used),<br>
and diluents.<br>
The dose and the dose ratio of 2-acetoxy-5-(a-cyclopropylcarbonyl-2-<br>
fluorobenzyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine or pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt thereof, and aspirin, can be widely altered based on several<br>
factors such as activity of each compound, and the symptoms, age and body<br>
weight of the patients.<br>
Generally, the lower limit of the oral dose (mg drug dose/time) is 0.1 mg<br>
(preferably, 1 mg) per time, while the upper limit is 1,000 mg (preferably, 500<br>
mg) per time. The lower and upper limits of intravenous injection are 0.01 mg<br>
(preferably, 0.1 mg) and 500 mg (preferably, 250 mg), respectively. They are<br>
administered to the adult from 1 to 7 times a day based on the symptoms of the<br>
patient, simultaneously or sequentially.<br>
Generally, the dose ratio of 2-acetdxy-5-(a-cyclopropylcarbonyl-2-<br>
fluorobenzyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine or pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt thereof, and aspirin, is from 1:500 to 500:1 as their weight ratio.<br>
[Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention]<br>
The present invention is described in detail with examples and<br>
formulations in the following. However, the claim of the present invention is not<br>
restricted to the following description.<br>
(Example 1)<br>
Inhibitory Activity against Thrombogenesis<br>
As the test animals, male Sprague Dawley rats of 7 weeks old were<br>
purchased from SLC Japan and 6 rats per group were used.<br>
2-Acetoxy-5-(a-cyclopropylcarbonyl-2-fluorobenzyl)-4,5,6,7-<br>
tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine was synthesized according to the method<br>
described in the Specification of Japanese Patent Application Publication No. Hei<br>
6-41139 and was used, while aspirin was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.<br>
and was used. Both compounds were suspended in 5% (w/v) gum arabic<br>
solution, and were diluted so as to be 1 ml/kg of administration volume and<br>
were orally administered.<br>
The inhibitory activities of the compounds against thrombogenesis or<br>
thrombus formation were evaluated in the modified arterio-venous shunt<br>
thrombosis model in rats, which was described by Umetsu et al. [Thromb.<br>
Haemost.. 39, 74-83 (1978)].<br>
The shunt tube was prepared as follows; i.e., both sides of a medical<br>
silicon tube of 12 cm length [inner diameter: 1.5 mm, outer diameter: 2.5 mm,<br>
purchased from KANEKA Medix Co., Ltd] were connected each to a polyethylene<br>
tube of 7 cm length [inner diameter: 0.5 mm, outer diameter: 1.0 mm,<br>
purchased from Natsume Seisakusho Co., Ltd.] covered with silicon via a<br>
medical silicon tube of 0.7 cm length [inner diameter: 1.0 mm, outer diameter:<br>
1.5 mm, KANEKA Medix Co., Ltd] as connector. A surgical suture of 10 cm<br>
length was placed in the silicon tube of 12 cm length.<br>
The animal was anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 40<br>
mg/kg of pentobarbital sodium (purchased from Abbott Laboratories Inc.), and<br>
the jugular of one side and the carotid of the other side were exposed. The<br>
arteriovenous shunt was made by cannulation of a shunt tube filled with<br>
heparin solution [30 units/kg, purchased from Fuso Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd]<br>
into the carotid and the jugular which had been previously exposed.<br>
The test compounds were orally administered and the blood was started<br>
to circulate into the shunt area two hours after the administration. Thirty<br>
minutes after the circulation was started, the shunt tube was removed, and the<br>
thrombus adsorbed on the surgical suture was weighed. The results are shown<br>
in Table 1. The results in the table are expressed as the average weight ± SE<br>
(n=6).<br>
The powders in the formula described in the above table are mixed,<br>
compressed with a tableting machine and formulated as a tablet containing 250<br>
mg in total. The tablet can be coated with film or sugar, when necessary.<br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
