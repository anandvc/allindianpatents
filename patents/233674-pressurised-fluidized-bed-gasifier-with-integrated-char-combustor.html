				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to pressurized fluidized bed combustion / gasification<br>
systems. More particularly, the present invention relates to a fluidized bed char<br>
combustion device adaptable to a fluidized bed gasification system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Gasification of coal, lignite and other fuels in pressurized fluidized / entrained<br>
bed systems are being adapted extensively for application in Integrated<br>
gasification combined cycle. In these systems, the fuel is gasified in an oxygen<br>
deficient environment. Hence the presence of un-burnt carbon-char in the fly ash<br>
as well as in the bottom ash is high compared to the combustion system where<br>
the oxygen required for reaction is provided. Even after recycling of these ash,<br>
the carbon-char in the ash is high in fluidized bed systems where the<br>
temperature of operation of the bed is influenced by the ash properties. To<br>
improve the carbon utilization, combustion of these char in a separate device is<br>
adapted. In order to enable an easy handling and further to effect pressure seal,<br>
the ash is generally cooled before taking it to the char combustor.<br>
US patent no. 5666801 dated 16th September 1997 under the Combined cycle<br>
power plant with integrated CFB devolatilizer and CFB boiler by Mr. Rohrer: John<br>
W. discloses a method in which coal is de-volatalized in a Circulating Fluidized<br>
Bed devolatiliser / Thermal Cracker and the char is burnt in a CFB Boiler. The<br>
fluidized bed could be a classical bubbling bed, a fast bed or a circulating bed<br>
where generally high volatile and high reactive bituminous, sub bituminous or<br>
lignite fuel is gasified in the gasifier to the maximum extent and un-burnt char<br>
along with the ash (either in full or partly) is burnt in conventional bubbling type<br>
combustor.<br>
The ash along with the char from the bottom of the bed and fly ash are removed<br>
through a cooler, extractor (to control the rate of removal) and a lock system<br>
consisting of vessels, isolation devices (ball valves), pressurizing / depressurizing<br>
means, before discharging through a suitable means into the char combustor.<br>
The char combustors mostly work at atmospheric pressure. This leads to a large<br>
system for ensuring proper combustion especially for fly ash. Even when the<br>
combustor is operating at elevated pressure, the ash is cooled to facilitate<br>
extraction. Such a method not only requires the additional equipment, but also<br>
cooling the ash / char results in lower efficiency of combustion / heat utilization.<br>
It also requires support fuel to maintain the high bed temperature for efficient<br>
combustion of char.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a fluidized bed char<br>
combustion device adaptable to a fluidized bed gasification system which<br>
eliminates the disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a fluidized bed char<br>
combustion device adaptable to a fluidized bed gasification system which ensures<br>
efficient combustion of char present in the combustible material.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a fluidized bed char<br>
combustion device adaptable to a fluidized bed gasification system which uses<br>
the sensible heat of the ash / char to aid combustion without the need of any<br>
support fuel thereby making the fluidized bed gasification system efficient and<br>
cost effective.<br>
A still further object of the present invention to provide a fluidized bed char<br>
combustion device adaptable to a fluidized bed gasification system which is<br>
compact and does not require additional means for cooling the ash / char to<br>
facilitate extraction.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly there is provided a fluidized bed char combustion device adaptable<br>
to a fluidized bed gasification system, the system comprising a gasifier, atleast<br>
one particulate collection means retaining the ash and char particles separated<br>
from the gas, and a bulk solid recirculator provided optionally for recycling the<br>
solids into the gasifier, the device comprises a diversion means for diverting the<br>
solid from the collection means to the gasifer via a parallel stream; a first<br>
fluidized bed char combustor for inputting one of air and air-oxygen mixture in<br>
the combustor, the first fluidized bed char combustor simultaneously controlling<br>
the temperature of the input including the temperature of the fluidized bed<br>
independently and/or combinedly thereby achieving combustion of the char<br>
material present in the solids input; the generated flue gas including left-out char<br>
being admitted to the gasifier, the resultant coarse ash including further left out<br>
char particles being extracted from the bottom of the gasifer; a second fluidized<br>
bed char combustor having atleast one heat transfer coil, and receiving the<br>
coarse ash including further left-out char particles from the gasifier for<br>
combustion therein, the flue gas generated being passed to a heat recovery<br>
means, the coarse ash being disposed in two stages firstly via the bottom of the<br>
combustor and secondly via the heat recovery means.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 - Shows a block diagram of a fluidized bed char combustion device<br>
adaptable to a fluidized bed gasification system according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
The gasification system consists of a pressurized fluidized bed gasifier (1) where the<br>
gasification is carried out to the maximum extent unlike only devolatilising/cracking.<br>
In this system, the coal is fed either directly by pneumatic injection or through a bulk<br>
solid recirculator into the gasifier bed being kept actively fluidized by air, air-stream<br>
mixture distributed uniformly through the air distributor. Gasification reaction takes<br>
place in the bed and the product gas along with finer ash and char particles leave the<br>
gasifier vessel at the top. Relatively coarser ash and char particles retained in the bed<br>
is extracted through the bottom. In a particulate collection means (2) like cyclone (s),<br>
most of the particle carried by the gas is separated. The gas leaving the collection<br>
means (2) is then cooled in a heat recovery means (7) like steam generator and/or air<br>
heater and cleaned further for removing the remaining dust such that the product gas<br>
is suitable for applications like burning in a gas turbine combustor. The particles<br>
removed in the collection means (2) is then recycled into the gasifier (1) with a bulk<br>
solid recirculator (not shown). The device is provided with a parallel stream (PS) to<br>
divert the solid from the collection means (2) to the gasifier (1) directly by a diverting<br>
means (3) like cone valves or siphon seal or loop seal or seal pot, without passing it<br>
through a fluidized bed char combustor 4(1). The proportion of the material diverted<br>
could be varied from 0 to 100%. Alternatively, the device may consist of a single<br>
stream (ss) to recirculate the entire material through a first fluidized bed char<br>
combustor (4 (1)). The first fluidized bed char combustor 4(1) comprising a<br>
vessel for ensuring proper fluidisation velocity and residence time, an air<br>
distributor, an inlet connection from the separating means (3) and a return line<br>
to the gasifier (1). By admitting required quantity or air, air-oxygen mixture and<br>
controlling the temperature of the ash diverted, air supply, cooling coils and bed<br>
segments independently or combinedly combustion of the char present in the<br>
material is achieved. The flue gas formed along with the ash and any left out<br>
char is admitted into the gasifier (1). Provision is also made to remove the ash<br>
from the first combustor (4(1)) for disposal directly or through a second char<br>
combustor 4(2) described below.<br>
The coarse ash and char particles extracted from the bottom of the gasifier (1) is<br>
taken to a second char combustor 4(2) for burning the char. The flue gas from<br>
the combustor is cooled and cleaned in a heat recovery means (5(2), 6). When<br>
the proportion of char in the ash extracted from the bottom is within acceptable<br>
level for disposal- for some coals or certain operating conditions- the second<br>
combustor 4(2) is used for cooling the material extracted. The gas can also be<br>
used for pressurizing of locks. The material of construction of the components<br>
have either the capability to withstand the temperature- in which case it is<br>
insulated outside to prevent heat loss and for safety- or it may be cooled or<br>
refractory lined. The fluidizing medium for the first char combustor 4(1) is air<br>
and / or oxygen. By having heat transfer coils immersed in the bed of the second<br>
char combustor 4(2) and controlling the ash/char feed and air/oxygen to the<br>
bed, the temperature of the bed is maintained within a desired range.<br>
