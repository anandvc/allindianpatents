Process   for   preparing   insecticidal    and    acaricidal   compositions, characterized in that mixtures as claimed in claim 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 are ;v  mixed with extenders and/or surfactants. Compositions substantially as herein described with reference to the foregoing examples.<br>
£<br><br>
The present invention relates to novel active compound combinations comprising known cyclic ketoenoles on the one hand and other known insecticidaily active compounds on the other hand and which are highly suitable for controlling animal pests such as insects and undesired acarids.<br>
It is already known that certain cyclic ketoenoles have herbicidal, insecticidal and acaricidal properties. The activity of these substances is good; however, at low application rates it is sometimes unsatisfactory.<br>
Unsubstituted bicyclic 3-aryl-pyrrolidine-2,4-dione derivatives (EP-A-355 599 and EP-A-415 211) and substituted monocyclic 3-aryl-pyrrolidine-2,4-dione derivatives (EP-A-377 893 and EP-A-442 077) are known to have herbicidal, insecticidal or acaridical activity.<br>
Also known are polycyclic 3-arylpyrrolidine-2,4-dione derivatives (EP-A-442 073) and lH-arylpyrrolidine-dione derivatives (EP-A-456 063, EP-A-521 334, EP-A-596 298, EP-A-613 884, EP-A-613 885, WO 94/01 997, WO 95/26 954, WO 95/20 572, EP-A-0 668 267, WO 96/25 395, WO 96/35 664, WO 97/01 535, WO 97/02 243, WO 97/36 868, WO 97/43 275, WO 98/05 638, WO 98/06 721, WO 98/25 928, WO 99/16 748, WO 99/24 437, WO 99/43 649, WO 99/48 869 and WO 99/55 673).<br>
Furthermore, it is already known that numerous heterocycles, organotin compounds, benzoylureas and pyrethroids have insecticidal and acaricidal properties (cf. WO 93/22 297, WO 93/10 083, DE-A 2 641 343, EP-A-347 488, EP-A-210 487, US-A 3 264 177 and EP-A-234 045). However, the activity of these substances is not always satisfactory.<br><br><br><br><br>

The   active   compound   combinations   can   be   converted   into   the   customary<br>
formulations such as solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders,<br>
15	dusts, pastes, soluble powders, granules, suspension-emulsion concentrates, natural<br>
and synthetic materials impregnated with active compound, and microencapsulations in polymeric materials.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the<br>
20	active compounds with extenders, that is, liquid solvents and/or solid carriers,<br>
optionally with the use of surfactants, that is, emulsifiers and/or dispersants, and/or foam formers.<br>
If the extender used is water, it is also possible, for example, to use organic solvents<br>
25	as cosolvents. The following are essentially suitable as liquid solvents: aromatics<br>
such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics and chlorinated<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes and methylene<br>
chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example<br>
mineral oil fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols such as butanol or glycol<br>
30	and their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl<br><br><br><br>
isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, or else water.<br>
Suitable solid carriers are:<br>
5	for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc,<br>
chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic materials such as highly-disperse silica, alumina and silicates; suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite,  marble, pumice,  sepiolite and dolomite,  or else synthetic granules of<br>
10	inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust,<br>
coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks; suitable emulsifiers and/or foam formers are: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates, or else protein<br>
15	hydrolysates; suitable dispersants are: for example lignin-sulphite waste liquors and<br>
methylcelluiose.<br>
Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the<br>
form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and<br>
20	polyvinyl acetate, or else natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins and<br>
synthetic phospholipids can be used in the formulations. Other additives can be mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide,<br>
25	titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic colorants such alizarin colorants, azo<br>
colorants and metal phthalocyanine colorants, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
The formulations generally comprise between 0.1 and 95% by weight of active<br>
30	compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br><br><br><br>
-2?r-<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention can be present in their<br>
commercially available formulations and in the use forms, prepared from these<br>
formulations, as a mixture with other active compounds, such as insecticides,<br>
attractants, sterilants, bactericides, acaricides, nematicides, fungicides, growth-<br>
5	regulating   substances   or   herbicides.   The   insecticides   include,   for   example,<br>
phosphates, carbamates, carboxylates, chlorinated hydrocarbons, phenylureas and substances produced by microorganisms.<br>
Mixtures with other known active compounds such as herbicides or with fertilizers<br>
10	and growth regulators are also possible.<br>
When used as insecticides, the active compound combinations according to the<br>
invention can furthermore be present in their commercially available formulations<br>
and in the use forms, prepared from these formulations, as a mixture with synergists.<br>
15	Synergists are compounds which increase the action of the active compounds,<br>
without it being necessary for the synergist added to be active itself.<br>
The active compound content of the use forms prepared from the commercially<br>
available   formulations   can   vary   within   wide   limits.   The   active   compound<br>
20	concentration of the use forms can be from 0.0000001 to 95% by weight of active<br>
compound, preferably between 0.0001 and 1% by weight.<br>
The compounds are employed in a customary manner appropriate for the use forms.<br>
25	When used against hygiene pests and stored-product pests, the active compound<br>

Industrial materials in the present context are understood as meaning non-living materials such as, preferably, polymers, adhesives, glues, paper and board, leather, wood, timber products and paints. 25<br>
The material which is to be protected from insect attack is very especially preferably wood and timber products.<br>
Wood and timber products which can be protected by the composition according to<br>
30	the invention, or mixtures comprising it, are to be understood as meaning, for<br>
example:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Construction timber, wooden beams, railway sleepers, bridge components, jetties, vehicles made of wood, boxes, pallets, containers, telephone poles, wood lagging, windows and doors made of wood, plywood, chipboard, joinery, or timber products which quite generally are used in house construction or building joinery. 5<br>
The active compound combinations can be used as such, in the form of concentrates or generally customary formulations such as powders, granules, solutions, suspensions, emulsions or pastes.<br>
10	The abovementioned formulations can be prepared in a manner known per se, for<br>
example by mixing the active compounds with at least one solvent or diluent, emulsifier, dispersant and/or binder or fixative, water repellant, if desired desiccants and UV stabilizers, and if desired colorants and pigments and other processing auxiliaries.<br>
15<br>
The insecticidal compositions or concentrates used for protecting wood and timber products comprise the active compound according to the invention in a concentration of 0.0001 to 95% by weight, in particular 0.001 to 60% by weight.<br>
20	The amount of composition or concentrate employed depends on the species and the<br>
abundance of the insects and on the medium. The optimal quantity to be employed can be determined in each case by test series upon application. In general, however, it will suffice to employ 0.0001 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.001 to 10% by weight, of the active compound, based on the material to be protected.<br>
25<br>
A suitable solvent and/or diluent is an organochemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or an oily or oil-type organochemical solvent or solvent mixture of low volatility and/or a polar organochemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or water and, if appropriate, an emulsifier and/or wetter.<br>
30<br><br><br><br><br>
Organochemical solvents which are preferably employed are oily or oil-type solvents<br>
with an evaporation number of above 35 and a flash point of above 30°C, preferably<br>
above 45°C. Such oily and oil-type solvents which are insoluble in water and of low<br>
volatility and which are used are suitable mineral oils or their aromatic fractions or<br>
5	mineral-oil-containing solvent mixtures, preferably white spirit, petroleum and/or<br>
alkylbenzene.<br>
Mineral oils with a boiling range of 170 to 220°C, white spirit with a boiling range of<br>
170 to 220°C, spindle oil with a boiling range of 250 to 350°C, petroleum and<br>
10	aromatics with a boiling range of 160 to 280°C, oil of turpentine, and the like are<br>
advantageously used.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, liquid aliphatic hydrocarbons with a boiling range of 180<br>
to 210°C or high-boiling mixtures of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons with a<br>
15	boiling range of 180 to 220°C and/or spindle oil and/or monochloronaphthalene,<br>
preferably a-monochloronaphthalene are used.<br>
The organic oily or oil-type solvents of low volatility and with an evaporation<br>
number of above 35 and a flash point of above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, can be<br>
20	replaced in part by organochemical solvents of high or medium volatility, with the<br>
proviso that the solvent mixture also has an evaporation number of above 35 and a flash point of above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, and that the mixture is soluble or emulsifiable in this solvent mixture.<br>
25	In a preferred embodiment, some of the organochemical solvent or solvent mixture is<br>
replaced by an aliphatic polar organochemical solvent or solvent mixture. Aliphatic organochemical solvents which contain hydroxyl and/or ester and/or ether groups are preferably used, such as, for example, glycol ethers, esters or the like.<br>
30	Organochemical binders used for the purposes of the present invention are the<br>
synthetic resins and/or binding drying oils which are known per se and which can be<br><br><br><br>
diluted in water and/or dissolved or dispersed or emulsified in the organochemical<br>
solvents employed, in particular binders composed of, or comprising, an acrylate<br>
resin, a vinyl resin, for example polyvinyl acetate, polyester resin, polycondensation<br>
or polyaddition resin, polyurethane resin, alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin, phenol<br>
5	resin, hydrocarbon resin such as indene/coumarone resin, silicone resin, drying<br>
vegetable and/or drying oils and/or physically drying binders based on a natural and/or synthetic resin.<br>
The synthetic resin employed as binder can be employed in the form of an emulsion,<br>
10	dispersion or solution. Bitumen or bituminous substances may also be used as<br>
binders, in amounts of up to 10% by weight. In addition, colorants, pigments, water repellants, odour-masking agents, and inhibitors or anticorrosive agents and the like, all of which are known per se, can be employed.<br>
15	In accordance with the invention, the composition or the concentrate preferably<br>
comprises, as organochemica] binders, at least one alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin and/or a drying vegetable oil. Alkyd resins which are preferably used in accordance with the invention are those with an oil content of over 45% by weight, preferably 50 to 68% by weight.<br>
20<br>
Some or all of the abovementioned binder can be replaced by a fixative (mixture) or plasticizer (mixture). These additives are intended to prevent volatilization of the active compounds, and also crystallization or precipitation. They preferably replace 0.01 to 30% of the binder (based on 100% of binder employed).<br>
25<br>
The plasticizers are from the chemical classes of the phthalic esters, such as dibutyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate or benzyl butyl phthalate, phosphoric esters such as tributyl phosphate, adipic esters such as di-(2-ethylhexyl)-adipate, stearates such as butyl stearate or amyl stearate, oleates such as butyl oleate, glycerol ethers or higher-<br>
30	molecular-weight glycol ethers, glycerol esters and p-toluenesulphonic esters.<br><br><br><br>
Fixatives are based chemically on polyvinyl alkyl ethers such as, for example, polyvinyl methyl ether, or ketones such as benzophenone and ethylenebenzophenone.<br>
Other suitable solvents or diluents are, in particular, water, if appropriate as a mixture<br>
5	with one or more of the abovementioned organochemical solvents or diluents,<br>
emulsifiers and dispersants.<br>
Particularly effective timber protection is achieved by industrial-scale impregnating processes, for example the vacuum, double-vacuum or pressure processes.<br>
10<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention can at the same time be employed for protecting objects which come into contact with saltwater or brackish water, such as hulls, screens, nets, buildings, moorings and signalling systems, against fouling.<br>
15<br>
Fouling by sessile Oligochaeta, such as Serpulidae, and by shells and species from the Ledamorpha group (goose barnacles), such as various Lepas and Scalpellum species, or by species from the Balanomorpha group (acorn barnacles), such as Balanus or Pollicipes species, increases the frictional drag of ships and, as a<br>
20	consequence, leads to a marked increase in operation costs owing to higher energy<br>
consumption and additionally frequent residence in the dry dock.<br>
Apart from fouling by algae, for example Ectocarpus sp. and Ceramium sp., fouling<br>
by sessile Entomostraka groups, which come under the generic term Cirripedia<br>
25	(cirriped crustaceans), is of particular importance.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the active compound combinations according to the invention have an outstanding antifouling action.<br>

All plants and plant parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. Plants are<br>
30	to be understood as meaning in the present context all plants and plant populations<br>
such as desired and undesired wild plants or crop plants (inclusive of naturally<br><br><br><br>
-AT-<br>
occurring crop plants). Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by<br>
conventional plant breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and<br>
genetic engineering or by combinations of these methods, inclusive of the transgenic<br>
plants and inclusive of the plant varieties protectable or not protectable by plant<br>
5	breeders' rights. Plant parts are to be understood as meaning all above-ground and<br>
below-ground parts and organs of plants, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root,<br>
examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stalks, stems, flowers, fruit<br>
bodies, fruits, seeds, roots, tubers and rhizomes. The plant parts also include<br>
harvested material, and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example<br>
10	cuttings, tubers, rhizomes, offsets and seeds.<br>
Treatment according to the invention of the plants and plant parts with the active<br>
compounds is carried out directly or by allowing the compounds to act on the<br>
surroundings, environment or storage space by the customary treatment methods, for<br>
15	example by immersion, spraying, evaporation, fogging, scattering, painting on and, in<br>
the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seed, also by applying one or more coats.<br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according<br>
20	to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or<br>
those obtained by conventional biological breeding, such as crossing or protoplast<br>
fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic<br>
plants and plant cultivars obtained by genetic engineering, if appropriate in<br>
combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms), and parts<br>
25	thereof are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants", or "plant parts" has been<br>
explained above.<br>
Particularly preferably,  plants  of the plant  cultivars  which  are  in  each  case commercially available or in use are treated according to the invention. 30<br><br><br><br>
Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth<br>
conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the<br>
invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example,<br>
reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an<br>
5	increase in the activity of the substances and compositions which can be used<br>
according to the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low<br>
temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased<br>
flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest<br>
yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products,<br>
10	better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible<br>
which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br>
The transgenic plants or plant cultivars (i.e. those obtained by genetic engineering) which are preferred and to be treated according to the invention include all plants<br>
15	which,   in  the  genetic  modification,  received  genetic  material   which  imparts<br>
particularly advantageous useful properties ("traits") to these plants. Examples of such properties are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest<br>
20	yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products,<br>
better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such properties are a better defence of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain<br>
25	herbicidally active compounds.  Examples  of transgenic plants  which  may be<br>
mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapevines), and particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton and oilseed rape. Traits that are particularly emphasized are<br>
30	increased defence of the plants against insects by toxins formed in the plants, in<br>
particular those formed by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for<br><br><br><br>
example by the genes CrylA(a), CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CryllA, CrylllA, CryIIIB2,<br>
Cry9c Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CrylF and also combinations thereof) (hereinbelow<br>
referred to as "Bt plants"). Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the<br>
increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for<br>
5	example imidazoJinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example<br>
the "PAT" gene). The genes which impart the desired traits in question can also be present in combination with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are maize cultivars, cotton cultivars, soya bean cultivars and potato cultivars which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD®<br>
10	(for  example  maize,  cotton,   soya  beans),   KnockOut®  (for  example  maize),<br>
StarLink® (for example maize), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucotn® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are maize cultivars, cotton cultivars and soya bean cultivars which are sold under the trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton,<br>
15	soya bean), Liberty Link® (tolerance to phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape),<br>
IMI® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to sulphonylurea, for example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manner for herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned include the cultivars sold under the name Clearfield® (for example maize). Of course, these statements also apply to<br>
20	plant cultivars having these or still to be developed genetic traits, which plants will<br>
be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
The plants  listed can  be treated according to the invention  in  a particularly<br>
advantageous manner with the active compound mixtures according to the invention.<br>
25	The preferred ranges stated above for the mixtures also apply to the treatment of<br>
these plants. Particular emphasis is given to the treatment of plants with the mixtures specifically mentioned in the present text.<br>
The good insecticidal and acaricidal action of the active compound combinations<br>
30	according to the invention can be seen from the examples which follow. While the<br><br><br>
individual active compounds show weaknesses in their action, the combinations show an action which exceeds a simple sum of actions.<br>
A synergistic effect in insecticides and acaricides is always present when the action<br>
5	of the active compound combinations exceeds the total of the actions of the active<br>
compounds when applied individually.<br>
The expected action for a given combination of two active compounds can be calculated as follows, using the formula of S.R. Colby, Weeds 15 (1967), 20-22:<br>
10<br>
If<br>
X        is the kill rate, expressed as % of the untreated control, when employing<br>
active compound A at an application rate of m g/ha or in a concentration of m<br>
15	ppm,<br>
Y is the kill rate, expressed as % of the untreated control, when employing active compound B at an application rate of n g/ha or in a concentration of n ppm and<br>
20<br>
is the kill rate, expressed as % of the untreated control, when employing active compounds A and B at application rates of m and n g/ha or in a concentration of m and n ppm,<br>
25	then<br><br>
If the actual insecticidal kill rate exceeds the calculated value, the action of the<br>
30	combination is superadditive, i.e. a synergistic effect is present. In this case, the<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to compositions comprising compounds of formula I<br>

W, X, Y, Z, R and G are each as defined in the table;<br><br>
and atleast a second compound selected from a group of spinosad, milbemectin, propargit, bifenazate, abamectin, pyridaben and fenazaquin,<br>
wherein said composition comprises the said compound of formula I and second compound in the preferred mixing ratio as defined below:<br><br>
Second compound	Preferred mixing ratio<br>

Example A<br>
Critical concentration test/soil insects - treatment of transgenic plants<br>
5	Test insect:     Diabrotica balteata - larvae in soil<br>
Solvent:	7 parts by weight of acetone<br>
Emulsifier:      1 part by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether<br>
10	To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active<br>
compound is mixed with the stated amount of solvent, the stated amount of emulsifier is added and the concentrate is diluted with water to the desired concentration.<br>
15	The preparation of active compound is poured onto the soil. Here, the concentration<br>
of the active compound in the preparation is virtually irrelevant, only the amount by weight of active compound per volume unit of soil, which is stated in ppm (mg/I), matters. The soil is filled into 0.25 1 pots and these are allowed to stand at 20°C.<br>
20	Immediately after preparation, 5 pre-germinated maize corns of the variety YIELD<br>
GUARD (trade mark of Monsanto Comp., USA) are placed into each pot. After 2 days, the test insects in question are placed into the treated soil. After a further 7 days, the efficacy of the active compound is determined by counting the maize plants that have emerged (1 plant = 20% efficacy).<br><br><br>
