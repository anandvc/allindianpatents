COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"REMOTE LOCK OPERATION APPARATUS FOR LIGHT VEHICLE"<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKl KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
the present invention relates to remote lock operation for light vehicle.<br><br>
[0001]<br>
[Technical Field to which the Invention Pertains]<br>
This invention relates to a remote -lock operation. apparatus for a light vehicle having no cabin. It is to be noted that the "light vehicle having no cabin" in the present invention may be any of a two-wheel car, a three-wheel car and a four-wheel car of the saddle-ride type and the seated type and may include or not include a prime mover. For example, a motorcycle, a scooter, a bicycle and so forth are included in the two-wheel car. [0002] [Prior Art]<br>
In a conventional motorcycle, scooter or the like, various locking mechanisms for preventing theft or mischief such as, for example, a main stand locking apparatus, a steering handle locking apparatus, a seat locking apparatus and so forth are provided at suitable locations of a vehicle body. Those locking mechanisms can be locked and unlocked arbitrarily by a driver operating a locking operation section provided on the vehicle body side through a key operation. [0003]<br>
Meanwhile, in four-wheel cars in recent years, an apparatus wherein a door locking mechanism can be locked<br>
and unlocked without a key by means of a remote lock operation apparatus which uses an infrared signal. In the conventional apparatus of the type mentioned, in order to assure a wide angle of directivity for an infrared signal, several infrared receivers are disposed discretely at suitable locations of a vehicle.<br>
[0004]<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
Thus, it is a possible idea to make it possible to lock and unlock the locking mechanism for a light vehicle such as a motorcycle having no cabin without a key by means of a remote lock operation apparatus which uses an infrared signal.<br>
[0005]<br>
In this instance, since the light vehicle is different from a four-wheel automobile in that the capacity of a battery incorporated therein is considerably small, if several Infrared receivers are used simultaneously as in a four-wheel automobile, then the total standby current is excessively high when compared with the battery capacity. This may possibly give rise to frequent occurrences of consumption of the battery, resulting in failure in starting of the engine, damage to the durability of the battery and so forth.<br>
[0006]<br>
Meanwhile, the directivity required for an Infrared receiver for the light vehicle generally is within the range of 4 5 degrees on the left and the right with respect to a longitudinal center line of the vehicle body as viewed rearwardly from the position of the left and right handle grips of the vehicle in the forward and backward direction of the vehicle body as seen in FIG. 1 when the convenience of use such as the route upon riding, opening/closing of the seat and so forth is taken into consideration. Accordingly, the mounted position of the Infrared receiver is preferably set to such a position at which the receiver can cover at least the directivity range without being influenced by the seat or a vehicle body rear portion. [0007]<br>
The present invention has been proposed taking the foregoing into consideration, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a remote lock operation apparatus for a light vehicle which satisfies the requirement described above and is simple in structure. [0008] [Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In order to attain the object described above,<br>
according to the present invention, a remote lock operation apparatus for a light vehicle having no cabin has a first characteristic in that it comprises a portable infrared transmitter, an Infrared receiver capable of receiving an infrared signal emitted from the infrared transmitter, a lock actuator capable of locking and unlocking a lock mechanism incorporated in a vehicle body, and a control apparatus for controlling operation of the lock actuator based on the infrared signal received by the Infrared receiver, and the Infrared receiver is disposed as a single member at an uppermost portion of the vehicle body. In addition to the characteristic, the remote lock operation apparatus for a light vehicle has a second characteristic in that the uppermost portion of the vehicle body is an upper edge portion of a windshield plate supported on and extending upwardly from a handle cover or a vehicle body front portion. [0009]<br>
According to the characteristics described above, since the Infrared receiver is used only by one for one vehicle, the standby current of the Infrared receiver can be reduced to a level with which consumption of a battery does not occur even if the capacity of the battery is<br><br>
small. Consequently, failure in starting of an engine by consumption of the battery can be prevented, and also the durability of the battery is raised. Besides, since the only one Infrared receiver is provided at the uppermost portion of the vehicle body, there is no obstacle to reception around the receiver any more and the reception performance of the receiver is raised. Consequently, the range of directivity of the Infrared receiver required for a light vehicle of the type described can be covered readily without being influenced by the seat or the vehicle body.<br>
[0010]<br>
[Mode for Carrying out the Invention]<br>
An embodiment of the present invention is described in detail below based on embodiments of the present invention illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
[BRIEF DESCRITION OF THE DRAWINGS] [FIG. 1]<br>
FIG. 1 is a plan view of a scooter according to a first embodiment of the present invention. [FIG. 2]<br>
FIG. 2 is a side elevational view of the scooter; [FIG. 3]<br><br>
FIG. 3, is a schematic block diagram of a remote lock operation apparatus. [FIG. 4]<br>
FIG. 4 is a perspective view of a motorcycle according to a second embodiment of the present invention [FIG. 5]<br>
FIG. 5 is a schematic block diagram of a remote lock operation apparatus according to the second embodiment. [0011]<br>
In the accompanying drawings, FIGS. 1 to 3 show a first embodiment wherein the present invention is applied to a scooter, and FIG. 1 is a plan view of the scooter FIG. 2 is a side elevational view of the scooter, and FIG. 3 is a schematic block diagram of a remote lock operation apparatus. Meanwhile, FIGS. 4 and 5 show a second embodiment wherein the present invention is applied to a<br>
motorcycle, and FIG. 4 is a perspective view of the motorcycle and FIG. 5 is a schematic block diagram of a remote lock operation apparatus. [0012]<br>
First, in the first embodiment shown in FIGS. 1 to 3, a scooter V as a light vehicle having no cabin includes a step ST provided between front and rear wheels Wf and Wr for receiving the feet of the driver placed thereon. A seat S on which the driver should be seated is disposed at an upper portion of a rear body cover Fr made of metal or synthetic resin as a vehicle body rear portion which is erected uprightly from a rear end of the step ST. A baggage accommodating seat box (not shown) is disposed in the rear body cover Fr, and the seat S is mounted on the seat box or the like such that the seat S can be opened and closed between a closing position at which the seat S covers an open end of the seat box and an opening position. [0013]<br>
Further, the scooter V includes a bar handle H operable for steering the front wheel Wf through a steering shaft 11. The steering shaft 11 is supported for rotation on a head pipe of a vehicle body front frame not shown and extends in an upward and downward, rearwardly<br>
inclined posture on the inner side, that is, on the rear side, of a front body cover Ff made of metal or synthetic resin as the vehicle body front portion. A lower portion of the steering shaft 11 is formed in a bifurcated fork for supporting the front wheel Wf for rotation. An upper end of the steering shaft 11 is coupled to a central portion of the bar handle H such that the bar handle H and the steering shaft 11 are turned integrally in accordance with a steering operation.<br>
[0014]<br>
The central portion of the bar handle H and the upper end portion of the steering shaft 11 are covered in good appearance with a T-shaped handle cover Hc made of synthetic resin or metal which is turned integrally with them. Left and right handle grips Hg at the opposite ends of the bar handle H extend outwardly from the opposite left and right end portions of the handle cover Hc.<br>
[0015]<br>
A transparent windshield plate G is erected uprightly and integrally at a front end portion of an upper face of the handle cover Hc such that it stands in a rearwardly inclined relationship above the handle cover Hc. An Infrared receiver (R) which is hereinafter described is provided and fixed at an uppermost portion<br>
of the windshield plate G {in the example shown, at a central portion of an upper edge portion of the plate G in the leftward and rightward direction), that is, at an uppermost portion of the vehicle body, such that a reception face thereof is directed at least rearwardly. It is to be noted that a wiring cable (not shown) connected to the Infrared receiver (R) is laid at a suitable location of the windshield plate G, for example, along a peripheral edge portion of the windshield plate G, and is connected to an electronic control circuit C which is hereinafter described. [0016]<br>
Further, a handle lock mechanism Lh for controlling pivotal motion of the handle H upon parking, a stand lock mechanism Lm for locking a main stand Mt, which can be pivoted between an upright position and a horizontal accommodated position, at the upright position and a seat lock mechanism Ls for locking the seat S at the closing position at which the seat S covers the open upper end of the seat box described above are provided at suitable locations of the vehicle body of the scooter V. Since the structure of the lock mechanisms Lh, Lm and Ls are conventionally known, description of the detailed structure of them is omitted.<br>
[0017]<br>
Operation wires Wh, Wm and Ws extend from the lock mechanisms Lh, Lm and Ls, respectively, and a single common electrically driven lock actuator 1 for locking and unlocking the lock mechanisms Lh, Lm and Ls through the operation wires Wh, Wm and Ws is provided at a suitable location of the vehicle body. The lock actuator 1 forms part of an remote lock operation apparatus A of the present invention and performs a locking operation or an unlocking operation in accordance with an instruction signal from the electronic control circuit C as a control apparatus provided at a suitable location of the vehicle body to lock or unlock the lock mechanisms Lh, Lm and Ls without a key.<br>
[0018]<br>
The remote lock operation apparatus A mentioned above includes, in addition to the lock actuator 1 and the electronic control circuit C, an infrared transmitter T of a small size which can be carried by the driver, and an Infrared receiver (R) disposed at the uppermost portion of the windshield plate G so that it can receive an infrared signal emitted from the transmitter T. An operation switch 2 operable for inputting locking or unlocking is provided for the transmitter T, and a signal<br>
transmission section (not shown) capable of transmitting an infrared signal corresponding to a particular ID code in response to an operation input for the switch 2 is built in the transmitter T. It is to be noted that such a structure of the infrared transmitter as just described is conventionally known in the art.<br>
[0019]<br>
The electronic control circuit C includes a signal discrimination section C1 including a CPU and a memory. The signal discrimination section C1 includes ID verification means for verifying and discriminating whether or not an infrared signal received by the Infrared receiver (R) is legal, that is, whether or not the ID code of the received signal coincides with a particular ID code stored in advance, and instruction signal outputting means for outputting an operation instruction signal to the lock actuator 1 in response to discrimination of the verification means that the received signal is a legal infrared signal (that the ID code exhibits coincidence).<br>
[0020]<br>
Further, a first energization circuit 3 for supplying power of a battery B to the electronic control circuit C and a relay circuit 4 having a main switch Sw<br>
and a main relay Re are connected to the electronic control circuit C. The relay circuit 4 opens or closes a second energization circuit 5, which interconnects the battery B and various electric systems {including an engine starting circuit) incorporated in the vehicle, to effect energization control of the electric systems.<br>
[0021]<br>
Operation of the embodiment described above is described below.<br>
[0022]<br>
It is assumed now that the scooter V is in a parking state and the lock actuator 1 is in a locking operative state so that all of the handle lock mechanism Lh, stand lock mechanism Lm and seat lock mechanism Ls are held in a locking state.<br>
[0023]<br>
If, in this state, an infrared signal is emitted from the infrared transmitter T toward the Infrared receiver (R) and is received by the infrared receiver (R), then the signal discrimination section C1 of the electronic control circuit C verifies and discriminates whether or not the received signal is legal, that is, whether or not the ID code of the received signal coincides with the particular ID code stored in advance.<br>
If it is discriminated that the received signal is a legal infrared signal (if the ID code exhibits coincidence), then the signal discrimination section C1 outputs an operation instruction signal to the lock actuator 1 so that the actuator 1 is switched from the locking state into an unlocking state. Consequently, the handle lock mechanism Lh, stand lock mechanism Lm and seat lock mechanism Ls are unlocked at a time. Simultaneously, the electronic control circuit C controls the main relay Re to an energization permission state.<br>
[0024]<br>
Thus, if the main switch Sw is switched from off to on, then the main relay Re can be switched on, and consequently, energization of all of the electric systems including the engine starting circuit is enabled. Accordingly, if a starter switch not shown is switched on in this state, then the engine starting circuit can be energized to start the engine. Then, upon completion of the starting of the engine, the scooter V is placed into a state wherein it can travel.<br>
[0025]<br>
On the other hand, in order to stop the engine which is in an operating state, the main switch Sw is switched from on to off. Consequently, the energization<br>
of the electric systems of the engine is interrupted, and the engine stops. Then, if, in this state, an infrared signal is transmitted from the infrared transmitter T to the Infrared receiver (R) again, then the signal discrimination section C1 of the electronic control circuit C verifies and discriminates whether or not the received signal is legal in such a manner as described above. If it is discriminated that the received signal is a legal infrared signal, then the signal discrimination section C1 outputs an operation instruction signal to the lock actuator 1 to switch the lock actuator 1 from the unlocking state to the locking state. Consequently, the handle lock mechanism Lh, stand lock mechanism Lm and seat lock mechanism Ls are locked at a time. Simultaneously, the electronic control circuit C controls the main relay Re to an energization inhibition state, and therefore, even if the main switch Sw is switched on, the main relay Re is not turned on. [0026]<br>
By the way, since the Infrared receiver <r of the remote lock operation apparatus a described above is used only by one for vehicle even if capacity battery b carried on considerably small when compared with four-></r>
wheel automobile, the total standby current of the Infrared receiver (R) can be reduced to such a level that no consumption of the battery occurs. Consequently, failure in starting of the engine caused by consumption of the battery can be prevented, and also the durability of the battery B can be raised. [0027]<br>
Further, the directivity required for the Infrared receiver (R) for the scooter V generally is within the range of 4 5 degrees on the left and the right with respect to a longitudinal center line of the vehicle body as viewed rearwardly from the position of the left and right handle grip parts Hg of the vehicle in the forward and backward direction of the vehicle body as seen in FIG. 1 when the convenience of use such as the route upon riding, opening/closing of the seat and so forth is taken into consideration. Accordingly, the mounted position of the Infrared receiver (R) is preferably set to such a position at which the receiver (R) can cover at least the directivity range described above without being influenced by the seat S or the vehicle body rear portion. However, since the only one Infrared receiver (R) is disposed at the uppermost portion of the vehicle body (that is, the windshield plate G) as in the present<br>
embodiment, there is no obstacle to reception around the receiver (R) any more and the reception performance of the receiver (R) is raised, and the range of directivity of the Infrared receiver (R) required for the scooter V can be covered readily without being influenced by the seat S or the vehicle body.<br>
[0028]<br>
A second embodiment wherein the present invention is applied to a motorcycle is shown in FIGS. 4 and 5. In the present embodiment, a single Infrared receiver (R) is disposed and fixed at an upper edge portion (in the example shown, at a mid portion in the leftward and rightward direction) of a transparent windshield plate G' incorporated integrally on a front cowl Ff' which forms a vehicle body front portion of the motorcycle V' such that a reception face thereof is directed at least rearwardly.<br>
[0029]<br>
Further, in the present second embodiment, a wheel lock mechanism Lw for locking rotation of a wheel is provided in place of the stand lock mechanism Lm of the preceding embodiment. Besides, the wheel lock mechanism Lw, handle lock mechanism Lh and seat lock mechanism Ls are locked and unlocked by means of lock actuators 1w, 1h and 1s for exclusive use, respectively. Accordingly, the<br>
lock actuators 1w, 1h and 1s can be disposed in the proximity of the corresponding lock mechanisms Lw, Lh and Ls and can drive the mechanisms effectively, respectively.<br>
[0030]<br>
Further, the electronic control circuit C as a control apparatus for the remote lock operation apparatus A includes, in addition to the signal discrimination section C1, an engine control section C2 for electronically controlling the engine in response to various operation states and operation conditions. The engine control section C2 outputs, in the example shown, a control signal to a fuel injection control section for the engine in order to control the fuel injection amount of the engine in response to detection signals of a water temperature sensor and other various engine controlling sensors.<br>
[0031]<br>
In the present second embodiment, the other configuration of the remote lock operation apparatus A is basically similar to that of the preceding embodiment, and also with the present second embodiment, operation and effects similar to those of the preceding embodiment are achieved.<br>
[0032]<br>
While the embodiments of the present invention are described in detail, the present invention is not limited to the embodiments described above and various small design changes are possible. For example, while, in the embodiments described above, a plurality of lock mechanisms Ls, Lh, Lm and Lw provided at a plurality of locations of a vehicle can be remotely operated collectively, according to the present invention, only some of the lock mechanisms Ls, Lh, Lm and Lw may be operated remotely. Further, the locking mechanism which is an object of remote operation of the present invention is not limited to those of the embodiments.<br>
[0033]<br>
Further, while, in the embodiments, the top of the windshield plate G or G' is given as an example of the uppermost portion of the vehicle body at which the Infrared receiver (R) is to be provided, if a vehicle body part (for example, a back mirror) other than a windshield plate is provided at an uppermost position of a vehicle, then an Infrared receiver may be disposed at the uppermost portion of the vehicle body part.<br>
[0034]<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
As described above, according to the present<br>
invention, in a light vehicle having no cabin, only one Infrared receiver for a remote lock operation apparatus is used for one vehicle. Therefore, the standby current of the. Infrared receiver can be reduced to a level with which consumption of a battery carried on the vehicle does not occur even if the capacity of the battery is small. Consequently, failure in starting of an engine by consumption of the battery can be prevented, and also the durability of the battery is raised. Besides, since the only one Infrared receiver is provided at the uppermost portion of the vehicle body, there is no obstacle to reception around the receiver any more and the reception performance of the receiver is raised, and the range of directivity of the Infrared receiver required for a light vehicle of the type described can be covered readily without being influenced by the seat or the vehicle body.<br>
