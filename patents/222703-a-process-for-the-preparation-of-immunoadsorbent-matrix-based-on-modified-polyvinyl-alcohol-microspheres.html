				<td>EIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This  invention relates to an immunoadsorbent matrix based on   modified polyvinyl alcohol  microspheres and its use in columns for direct haemo-perfusion <br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENIJON<br>
Plasma  exchange has become the  most  common and   effective   therapeutic   treatment   of   various intractable   disorders   and   neurological   diseases. Unavailability  and high price of plasma  products, ^nd risk  of  infections lead to the development  of  plasma treatment   devices.,    Selective   adsorption    plasma treatment  is now a wel1 established  clinical  practice for  the treatment of myasthenia gravis5  GuilIain-Barre syndrome (GBS)*   systemic lupus erythematosus (BLE) etc., but  is  only marginally cheaper  than  plasma  exchange procedure,   and  the  columns  are  meant  for   plasma perfusion   only-   However„  this  can  eliminate   the dependence of plasma products on plasmapheresis  thereby avoiding    risk   of   infections*    Though    various immunoadsorption  columns for plasma perfusion only are available,  it  is  stil1  not  known  to havB        direct haemoperfusion   columns-  Further 9   it is not  known  to have devices that can simplify and reduce treatment cost further  by  achieving  plasma  separation amd        plasma treatment in a single device or direct haemo-perfusion.<br>
An  apparatus and method is known in the  art<br>
which draws blood through a blood pump and a column, and functions as a plasma separator to cause a separation of<br>
the  blood  cells from the plasma.  The plasma  is  then passed  through  an immunoadsorhent column so  that  IgG<br>
proteins get adsorbed in the adsorbent ? and   the  treated<br>
plasma  is then mixed with the removed blood  cells  and<br>
returned  to  the patient.  The disadvantage of  such  a method and     apparatus  is that  of  substantial  costs.<br>
Further  such a method is to be repeated once or  twice and     each time the column and   plasma separator is to  be<br>
replaced.<br>
Yet another method and apparatus known in the<br>
art is to withdraw the blood of a patient9   which is then centrifuged to remove the plasma, which is then replaced<br>
by  fresh blood plasma from a donor.  A disadvantage  of such a method and apparatus is that of infection in  the<br>
fresh blood of a donor -  Further, hemolysis can  occur   in the centrifuge.<br>
QBJECTS OF THE	UVJSS££IS<br>
An object of this invention is to propose an immunoadsorbent   matrix  based  on  polyvinyl   alcohol tnicropheres for direct haemo-perfusion.<br>
A further object of this invention is to propose an immunoadsorbent matrix based on polyvinyl alcohol which can specifically remove IgG proteins from blood and is highly blood compatible.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to propose an immunoadsorbent column based on the immunoadsorbent matrix for the specific removal of antibodies belonging to or consisting of immunoglobulins of the class XG and circulating immune complexes.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose an immunoadsorbent column which can be used for direct perfusion of human patient blood for the treatment of IgG mediated disorders.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose an immunoadsorbent column for blood perfusion which may be applied clinically as a less complex and inexpensive alternative to plasma treatment devices.<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for the preparation of an improved adsorbent matrix based on modified polyvinyl alcohol microshperes comprising of:<br>
a) preparing   crosslinked   polyvinyl   alcohol   (PVA)   as   herein<br>
described,<br>
b) beads formed by step (a) are subjected to the step of filtering, washing, drying and sieving tc get crosslinked PVA beads,<br>
c) subjecting the beads to swelling in an alkaline medium followed by filtering, adding mixture of epi chlorohydrin and 1, 4-dioxan to swollen beads,<br>
d) reaction mixture of step ( c) is cooled, washed and subjected to the treatment with aminoacid solution, stirring and washing the beads,<br>
e) activating as herein described, the beads to obtain amino adsorbent matrix.<br><br>
In accordance with this invention the preparation of immunoadsorbent beads comprises in preparing partially crosslinked polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) beads by mixing an aqueous solution of PVA with glutaraldehyde and dispersing the mixture in an oil medium by stirring. To the dispersed PVA solution is added benzoyl chloride slowly dropwise. On completion of reaction, the beads thus formed are subjected to the step of filtering, washing, drying and sieving to obtain the crosslinked PVA beads. The dry crosslinked beads are subjected to swelling in an alkaline medium followed by filtering and then adding a mixture of epichlorohydrin and 1,4-dioxan to the swollen beads and the reaction is performed by heating. The reaction mixture is cooled and then followed by washing and subjecting the washed beads to treatment with aminoacid solution with gentle stirring, and washing the beads to obtain aminoacid coupled PVA beads. The aminoacid coupled beads is activated by exposing them to l-ehtyl-3-(3-demethyl amino proply) carbodimide in PBS followed by the step of exposing the activated beads to heparin solution, washing to remove unbound herparin, to botain the immunoadsorbent beads, Hep-ph-PVA.<br><br>
The  first  step of the process  consists  in preparation of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) beads.  For  this purpose, partially crosslinked PVA beads ar&amp;   prepared by acid catalysed reaction by mixing an   aqueous solution of ^VA  of  molecular  weight 1,00,000 to 1,50,000  in 3 to 6  ml of  qlutaraldehyde and dispersed in an oil  medium and  subjected  to  the  step  of  stirring-   Upon  PVA solution being completely dispersed, a catalyst is added dropwise.   The catalyst  by way of example, is  benzoyl chloride.  After completion of the reaction in a  period of approximately 30 mins, the beads are filtered, washed, dried and classified-<br>
The  oil medium used in the cross linking  of PVA  beads is heavy and   light liquid paraffin oil  in  a proportion  for example 2:1, with   sorbitan  monooleate added  thereto-  Preferably, approximately 500  ml.  oil solution contains about 355 ml- of heavy oil and 165 ml. of light oil with 0.4 ml„ of sorbitan monooleate.<br>
The  washing  of  the  beads  is  done  using organic solvents preferably petroleum ether followed  by acetone and   subsequently with disti1 led water -<br>
The  next  step in the process  comprises  in phenylalanine  coupling  onto the  PVA  microspheres  is achieved  according  to the reaction scheme  (Scheme  I) shown in Fig. 1   of the accompanying drawing.<br><br>
Stable aminoacid ligands ar&amp;  coupled onto the<br>
beads  by  swelling.  Known amounts of  dry  beads  were<br>
swollen  in an alkaline medium and filtered-  A  mixture<br>
of  epichlorohydrin  and organic solvent  such  as  1,4-<br>
dioxan was added into the swollen beads and the reaction<br>
o was performed at 100-120 C for one hour-  The mixture is<br>
cooled to room temperature, followed by through washing with  acetone and distilled water to remove  the  excess<br>
reaction   mixture  and  finally  to  neutrality *	The<br>
phenylalanine  is  coupled  to the  activated  beads  by<br>
treating them with 250 mgX and above aminoacid  solution<br>
o at 40-60 C with gentle stirring -  The beads were  washed<br>
free  of uncoupled aminoacid *      The possible  reaction  is depicated in Fig - 1.<br>
The  beads are washed free of  the  uncoupled<br>
amino acid by acetone and distilled water and finally to neutrality-<br>
Immobilisation    of   heparin    onto    the phenylalanine  coupled beads is completed  according  to the  reaction scheme (Scheme II) as shown in Fig*  2  of the accompanying drawings -<br>
The  aminoacid  coupled PVA beads  (wet) &amp;r&amp; exposed     to    l-ethyl-~3-(3~dimethyl     aminopropyl )<br>
carbodimide in PBS.  The activated beads &amp;r&amp;   washed with distilled water followed by exposure to 4-25 mgX heparin<br>
solution  in  PBS to obtain  adsorbents  with  different amount of bound heparin.  The Hep-ph-PVA beads are  then<br>
washed with distilled water to remove unbound heparin.<br>
The  two  reactions arB   carried out  at  room<br>
temperature  with gentle stirring, at a pH of about  8*5 and 5.5 respectively -<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of  the<br>
present  invention, a column is packed with the  Hep-ph-PVA  beads and used in haemo-perfusion for the  specific<br>
removal  of  antibodies  that belong to  or  consist  of immunoglobulins of G, i.e. antibodies such as  anti-DNA,<br>
AChRab, anti-GBM and circulating immune complexes-Other  objects and advantages of the  present<br>
invention   will  be  apparent  from  the   accompanying examples  and  the  comparative study  depicted  in  the<br>
following tables-<br><br>
