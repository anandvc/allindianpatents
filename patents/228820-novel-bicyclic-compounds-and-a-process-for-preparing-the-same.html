NOVEL BICYCLIC COMPOUNDS AND COMPOSITIONS<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Numbers 60/446,648 (filedFebruary 11,2003), 60/464,809 (filed April 21, 2003) and 60/472,012 May 19,2003). The full disclosures of these applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety and for all purposes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention provides a novel class of bicyclic compounds useful in the treatment or prevention of diseases or disorders mediated by lymphocyte interactions, particularly diseases associated with EDG/S1P receptor mediated signal transduction.<br>
Background<br>
EDG receptors belong to a family of closely related, lipid activated G-protein coupled receptors. EDG-1, EDG-3, EDG-5, EDG-6, and EDG-8 (also respectively termed S1P1, S1P3, S1P2, S1P4, and S1P5) are identified as receptors specific for sphingosine-1-phosphate (SIP). EDG2, EDG4, and EDG7 (also termed LPA1, LPA2, and LP A3, respectively) are receptors specific for lysophosphatidic (LPA). Among the SIP receptor isotypes, EDG-1, EDG-3 and EDG-5 are widely expressed in various tissues, whereas the expression of EDG-6 is confined largely to lymphoid tissues and platelets, and that of EDG-8 to the central nervous system. EDG receptors are responsible for signal transduction and are thought to play an important role in cell processes involving cell development, proliferation, maintenance, migration, differentiation, plasticity and apoptosis. Certain EDG receptors are associated with diseases mediated by lymphocyte interactions, for example, in transplantation rejection, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, infectious diseases and cancer. An alteration in EDG receptor activity contributes to the pathology and/or<br><br>
symptomology of these diseases. Accordingly, molecules that themselves alter the activity of EDG receptors are useful as therapeutic agents in the treatment of such diseases.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The invention provides compounds that are usefiil in the treatment and/or prevention of diseases or disorders mediated by lymphocyte interactions. Also provided are methods for treating such diseases or disorders.<br>
Definitions<br>
In this specification, unless otherwise defined:<br>
"Acyl" means a residue R-CO- wherein R is d-ealkyl, C3.6cyclopropyl, phenyl or phenylCMalkyl.<br><br>
"Alkyl" as a group and as a structural element of other groups, for example halo-substituted-alkyl, alkoxy, acyl, alkylthio, alkylsulfonyl and alkylsulfinyl, can be either straight-chained or branched. "Alkenyl" as a group and as a structural element of other groups contains one or more carbon-carbon double bonds, and can be either straight-chain, or branched. Any double bonds can be in the cis- or trans- configuration. A preferred alkenyl group is vinyl "Alkynyl" as a group and as structural element of other groups and compounds contains at least one C sC triple bond and can also contain one or more C=C double bonds, and can, so far as possible, be either straight-chain or branched. A preferred alkynyl group is propargyl. Any cycloalkyl group, alone or as a structural element of other groups can contain from 3 to 8 carbon atoms, preferably from 3 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>
"Aryl" means a monocyclic or fused bicyclic aromatic ring assembly containing six to ten ring carbon atoms. For example, aryl can be phenyl or naphthyl, preferably phenyl. "Arylene" means a divalent radical derived from an aryl group. For example, arylene as used in this application can be phenylene or naphthylene, preferably phenylene, more preferably 1,4-phenylene.<br>
"Halo" or "halogen" means F, CI, Br or I, preferably F or CI. Halo-substituted alkyl groups and compounds can be partially halogenated or perhalogenated, whereby in the case of multiple halogenation, the halogen substituents can be identical or different. A preferred perhalogenated alkyl group is for example trifluoromethyl.<br>
"Heteroaryl" means aryl, as defined in this application, provided that one or more of the ring carbon atoms indicated are replaced by a hetero atom moiety selected from N, O or S, and each ring is comprised of 5 to 6 ring atoms, unless otherwise stated.

As used in the present invention, an EDG-1 selective compound (agent or modulator) has a specificity that is (i) selective for EDG-1 over EDG-3 and over one or more of EDG-5, EDG-6, and EDG-8; or (ii) selective for EDG-1 and EDG-3 over one or more of EDG-5, EDG-6, and EDG-8. As used herein, selectivity for one EDG receptor (a "selective receptor") over another EDG receptor (a "non-selective receptor") means that the compound<br><br>
has a much higher potency in inducing activities mediated by the selective EDG receptor (e.g., EDG-1) than that for the non-selective SIP-specific EDG receptor. If measured in a GTP-yS binding assay (as described in the Example below), an EDG-1 selective compound typically has an EC50 (effective concentration that causes 50% of the maximum response) for a selective receptor (EDG-1, or both EDG-1 and EDG-3 in some embodiments) that is at least 5,10,25, 50,100, 500, or 1000 fold lower than its EC50 for a non-selective receptor (e.g., one or more of EDG-5, EDG-6, and EDG-8).<br>

The invention provides forms of the compound that have the hydroxyl or amine group present in a protected form; these function as prodrugs. Prodrugs are compounds that are converted into an active drug form after administration, through one or more chemical or biochemical transformations. Forms of the compounds of the present invention that are readily converted into the claimed compound under physiological conditions are prodrugs of the claimed compounds and are within the scope of the present invention. Examples of prodrugs include forms where a hydroxyl group is acylated to form a relatively labile ester such as an acetate ester, and forms where an amine group is acylated with the carboxylate group of glycine or an L-amino acid such as serine, forming an amide bond that is particularly susceptible to hydrolysis by common metabolic enzymes. Some molecules of the present invention can themselves be prodrugs, such as those comprising a phosphate residue of formula (g) which can be enzymatically dephosphorylated to a hydroxy group.<br><br>
Alternatively, a compound of the invention comprising a free hydroxy group can be enzymatically phosphorylated to a compound comprising a phosphate residue of formula (g). The present invention also includes both the enzymatically phosphorylated or dephosphorylated compounds of Formula I, optionally in equilibrium.<br>
Compounds of Formula I can exist in free form or in salt form, e.g. addition salts with inorganic or organic acids; when group (g) is present and R9 or R10 is -OH, group (g) can also be present in salt form, e.g. an ammonium salt or salts with metals such as lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, zinc or magnesium, or a mixture thereof. Compounds of Formula I and their salts in hydrate or solvate form are also part of the invention.<br>
When the compounds of Formula I have asymmetric centers in the molecule, various optical isomers are obtained. The present invention also encompasses enantiomers, racemates, diastereoisomers and mixtures thereof. For example, the central carbon atom bearing R\ CH2-R3 and NRTT can have the R or S configuration. Compounds having the R configuration at this central carbon atom are preferred. Moreover, when the compounds of Formula I include geometric isomers, the present invention embraces cis-compounds, trans-compounds and mixtures thereof. Similar considerations apply in relation to starting materials exhibiting asymmetric carbon atoms or unsaturated bonds as mentioned above.<br>
Methods and Pharmaceutical Compositions for Treating Immunomodulatory Conditions<br>
The compounds of Formula I in free form or in phannaceutically acceptable salt form, exhibit valuable pharmacological properties, e.g. lymphocyte recirculation modulating properties, for example, as indicated by the in vitro and in vivo tests of Example 3 and are therefore indicated for therapy. Compounds of Formula I preferably show an EC5o in the range of 1 x 10'10 to 1 x 1(T5 M, preferably less than 50nM. The compounds exhibit selectivity for one or more EDG/S1P receptors, preferably EDG-1/S1P-L EDG-1/S1P-1 selective modulators of the present invention can be identified by assaying a compound's binding to EDG-1/S1P-1 and one or more of the other EDG/S1P receptors (e.g., EDG-3/S1P-3, EDG-5/S1P-2, EDG-6/S1P-4, and EDG-8/S1P-5). An EDG-1/S1P-1 selective modulator usually has an EC50 for the EDG-l/SlP-1 receptor in the range of 1 x 10"10 to 1 x 10"5 M, preferably less than 50 nM, more preferably less than 5 nM. It also has an EC50 for one or more of the other EDG/S1P receptors that is at least 5,10,25, 50,100,500, or 1000<br><br>
fold higher than its EC50 for EDG-1/S1P-1. Thus, some of the EDG4/S1P-1 modulatory compounds will have an EC50 for EDG-1/S1P-1 that is less than 5 nM while their EC50 for one or more of the other EDG/S1P receptors are at least 100 nM or higher. Other than assaying binding activity to the EDG/S1P receptors, EDG-1/S1P-1 selective agents can also be identified by examining a test agent's ability to modify a cellular process or activity mediated by an EDG/S1P receptor.<br>
The compounds of formula I are, therefore, useful in the treatment and/or prevention of diseases or disorders mediated by lymphocytes interactions, for example in transplantation, such as acute or chronic rejection of cell, tissue or organ alio- or xenografts or delayed graft function, graft versus host disease, autoimmune diseases, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, hashimoto's thyroidis, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, diabetes type I or II and the disorders associated therewith, vasculitis, pernicious anemia, Sjoegren syndrome, uveitis, psoriasis, Graves ophthalmopathy, alopecia areata and others, allergic diseases, e.g. allergic asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis/conjunctivitis, allergic contact dermatitis, inflammatory diseases optionally with underlying aberrant reactions, e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, intrinsic asthma, inflammatory lung injury, inflammatory liver injury, inflammatory glomerular injury, atherosclerosis, osteoarthritis, irritant contact dermatitis and further eczematous dermatitises, seborrhoeic dermatitis, cutaneous manifestations of immunologically-mediated disorders, inflammatory eye disease, keratoconjunctivitis, myocarditis or hepatitis, ischemia/reperfusion injury, e.g. myocardial infarction, stroke, gut ischemia, renal failure or hemorrhage shock, traumatic shock, T cell lymphomas or T cell leukemias, infectious diseases, e.g. toxic shock (e.g. superantigen induced), septic shock, adult respiratory distress syndrome or viral infections, e.g. AIDS, viral hepatitis, chronic bacterial infection, or senile dementia. Examples of cell, tissue or solid organ transplants include e.g. pancreatic islets, stem cells, bone marrow, corneal tissue, neuronal tissue, heart, lung, combined heart-lung, kidney, liver, bowel, pancreas, trachea or oesophagus. For the above uses the required dosage will of course vary depending on title mode of administration, the particular condition to be treated and the effect desired.<br><br>
Furthermore, the compounds of formula I are useful in cancer chemotherapy, particularly for cancer chemotherapy of solid tumors, e.g. breast cancer, or as an anti-angiogenic agent.<br>
The required dosage will of course vary depending on the mode of administration, the particular condition to be treated and the effect desired. In general, satisfactory results are indicated to be obtained systemically at daily dosages of from about 0.03 to 2.5 mg/kg per body weight. An indicated daily dosage in the larger mammal, e.g. humans, is in the range from about 0.5 mg to about 100 mg, conveniently administered, for example, in divided doses up to four times a day or in retard form. Suitable unit dosage forms for oral administration comprise from ca. 1 to 50 mg active ingredient.<br>
The compounds of Formula I can be administered by any conventional route, in particular enterally, for example, orally, e.g. in the form of tablets or capsules, or parenterally, for example, in the form of injectable solutions or suspensions, topically, e.g. in the form of lotions, gels, ointments or creams, or in a nasal or a suppository form. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of Formula I in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form in association with at least one pharmaceutical acceptable carrier or diluent can be manufactured in conventional manner by mixing with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.<br>
The compounds of Formula I can be administered in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, for example, as indicated above. Such salts can be prepared in a conventional manner and exhibit the same order of activity as the free compounds.<br>
In accordance with the foregoing the present invention further provides:<br>

Methods for Preparing Compounds of the Invention<br>
The present invention also includes processes for the preparation of immunomodulatory compounds of the invention. In the reactions described, it can be necessary to protect reactive functional groups, for example hydroxy, amino, imino, thio or carboxy groups, where these are desired in the final product, to avoid their unwanted participation in the reactions. Conventional protecting groups can be used in accordance with standard practice, for example, see T.W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts in "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", John Wiley and Sons, 1991.<br>
Compounds of Formula I, wherein R1 is a group of formula (a), can be prepared by proceeding as in the following Reaction scheme 1:<br><br>
in which n, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, X and Y are as defined for Formula I above.<br>
Compounds of Formula I can be prepared by reacting a compound of Formula 2 with a compound of Formula 3. The reaction can be effected in a suitable acid (e.g., acetic acid, or the like) and can take 1 to 20 hours to complete.<br>
Compounds of Formula I can be prepared by removing the hydrolysable groups present in a compound of Formula 4:<br><br><br>
19	A<br>
wherein X, Y, R and R are as defined above, R ' is an amino protecting group, R2' has one of the significances given for R2 above except that the terminal OH when present in the OH-substituted Ci-4alkyl is in protected form or the residue of formula (g) is replaced by a residue of formula (g') andR5' isR5" in which R5" isH, -OH in protected form or a residue of formula (g'), provided that at least one of R2' and R5' is OH in protected form or a residue of formula (g'), the residue of formula (g') being:<br><br>
wherein each of R9' and R10' is a hydrolysable group and, where required, converting the compounds of Formula I obtained in free form into the desired salt form, or vice versa.<br>
The process can be carried out in accordance with methods known in the art. Hydrolysable groups can be hydroxy and amino protecting groups, for example, when compounds of Formula I are free of a residue of formula (g), and/or groups such as R9' and R10\ Examples of protecting groups for hydroxy and amino groups are, for example, as disclosed in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" T.W. Greene, J. Wiley &amp; Sons NY, 2nd ed., chapter 7,1991, and references therein, for example benzyl, p-methoxybenzyl, methoxymethyl, tetrahydropyranyl, trialkylsilyl, acyl, tert-butoxy-carbonyl, benzyloxy-carbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl, trifluoroacetyl, trimethylsilyl-ethanesulfonyl and the like.<br>
Preferably R9' and R10' are identical and have the significance of, for example, phenoxy or benzoxy or form together a cyclic system such as in l,5-dihydxo-2,4,3-benzodioxaphosphepin.<br><br>
The removal of the hydroxy and amino protecting groups and/or of R4* or R6' groups in the compounds of formula 4 can conveniently be performed according to methods known in the art, for example, by hydrolysis, for example, in a basic medium, for example using a hydroxide such as barium hydroxide. It can also be performed by hydrogenolysis, for example, in the presence of Pearlman's catalyst, for example, as disclosed in J. Org. Chem., 1998, 63,2375-2377. When the compounds of formula 4 are fr«e of a residue of formula (g5), the removal of the hydroxy and amino protecting groups can also be performed in an acidic medium.<br>
Additional Processes for Preparing Compounds of the Invention:<br>
A compound of the invention can be prepared as a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt by reacting the free base form of the compound with a pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic acid. Alternatively, a pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salt of a compound of the invention can be prepared by reacting the free acid form of the compound with a pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic base. Alternatively, the salt forms of the compounds of the invention can be prepared using salts of the starting materials or intennediates.<br>
The free acid or free base forms of the compounds of the invention can be prepared from the corresponding base addition salt or acid addition salt from, respectively. For example a compound of the invention in an acid addition salt form can be converted to the corresponding free base by treating with a suitable base (e.g., ammonium hydroxide solution, sodium hydroxide, and the like). A compound of the invention in a base addition salt form can be converted to the corresponding free acid by treating with a suitable acid (e.g., hydrochloric acid, etc.).<br>
Compounds of the invention in unoxidized form can be prepared from N-oxides of compounds of the invention by treating with a reducing agent (e.g., sulfur, sulfur dioxide, triphenyl phosphine, lithium borohydride, sodium borohydride, phosphorus trichloride, tribromide, or the like) in a suitable inert organic solvent (e.g. acetonitrile, ethanol, aqueous dioxane, or the like) at 0 to 80°C.<br>
Prodrug derivatives of the compounds of the invention can be prepared by methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art (e.g., for further details see Saulnier et aL, (1994),<br><br>
Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters, Vol. 4, p. 1985), For example, appropriate prodrugs can be prepared by reacting a non-derivatized compound of the invention with a suitable carbamylating agent (e.g., 1,1-acyloxyalkylcarbanochloridate, para-nitrophenyl carbonate, or the like).<br>
Protected derivatives of the compounds of the invention can be made by means known to those of ordinary skill in the art. A detailed description of techniques applicable to the creation of protecting groups and their removal can be found in T W. Greene, "Protecting Groups in Organic Chemistry", 3rd edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1999.<br>
Compounds of the present invention can be conveniently prepared, or formed during the process of the invention, as solvates (e.g., hydrates).  Hydrates of compounds of the present invention can be conveniently prepared by recrystallization from an aqueous/organic solvent mixture, using organic solvents such as dioxin, tetrahydrofuran or methanol.<br>
Compounds of the invention can be prepared as their individual stereoisomers by reacting a racemic mixture of the compound with an optically active resolving agent to forma pair of diastereoisomeric compounds, separating the diastereomers and recovering the optically pure enantiomers. While resolution of enantiomers can be carried out using covalent diastereomeric derivatives of the compounds of the invention, dissociable<br>
«<br>
complexes are preferred (e.g., crystalline diastereomeric salts). Diastereomers have distinct physical properties (e.g., melting points, boiling points, solubilities, reactivity, etc.) and can be readily separated by taking advantage of these dissimilarities.  The diastereomers can be separated by chromatography, or preferable, by separation/resolution techniques based upon differences in solubility. The optically pure enantiomer is then recovered, along with the resolving agent, by any practical means that would not result in racemization. A more detailed description of the techniques applicable to the resolution of stereoisomers of compounds from the their racemic mixture can be found in Jean Jacques, Andre Collet, Samuel H. Wilen, "Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions", John Wiley And Sons, Inc., 1981.<br>
In summary, the compounds of Formula I can be made by a process, which involves:<br>

By repeating the procedure described in the above examples, using appropriate starting materials, the following compounds of Formula I are obtained as identified in Table 1.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 3 Compounds of Formula I Exhibit Biological Activity<br>
A.      In vitro: A scintillation proximity assay (SPA) for measuring GTP fv-3SSl<br>
binding to membranes prepared from CHO cells expressing human EDG/S1P receptors<br>
EDG-1 (S1P1) GTP [y-35S] binding assay: Membrane protein suspensions are prepared from<br>
CHO cell clones stably expressing a human EDG-1 N-terminal c-myc tag. Solutions of test<br>
compounds ranging from lOmM to O.OlnM are prepared inDMSO/50mM HC1 and then<br>
diluted into assay buffer (20mM HEPES, pH74, lOOmM NaCl, lOmM MgC12,0.1% fat free<br>
BSA). Assay buffer containing lOmM GDP is mixed with wheat germ agglutinin-coated<br>
SPA-beads (10µg/well) followed by the addition of human EDG-1 membrane protein<br>
suspension (10 jag/well) and test compound. The bead/membrane/compound assay<br>
components are then mixed for 10-15 minutes on a shaker at room temperature. GTP [y-35S]<br>
(200pM) and bead/membrane/compound assay mixture are added to individual wells of a 96<br>
well Optiplate ™ (final volume 225 pi/well), sealed and incubated at room temperature for<br>
110 to 120 minutes under constant shaking. After centrifugation (2000rpm, 10 minutes)<br>
luminescence is measured with a TopCount ™ instrument.<br>
EC50 values are obtained by fitting the GTP [y-35S] binding curves (raw data) with<br>
the dose response curve-fitting tool of ORIGIN V. 6.1. Basal binding (no compound) and<br><br>
the highest stimulation of GTP [y-35S] binding achieved by an agonist are used as the fitting range. Seven different concentrations are used to generate a concentration response curve (using two or three data points per concentration).<br>
EDG-3,-5,-6 and -8 GTP [y-35S] binding assays are carried out in a comparable manner to the EDG-1 GTP [[y-35S] binding assay using membranes from CHO, or in the case of EDG-8 RH7777 membranes, from cells stably expressing c-terminal c-myc tagged or untagged receptors. Concentrations of EDG receptor expressing membranes range between 13-19 µg per well.   Compounds of the invention were tested according to the above assay and were observed to exhibit selectivity for the EDG-1 receptor (table 2). For example, phosphoric acid mono-(2«amino-2-hydroxyme1hyl-4-{4-[l-(4-tMophen-2-yl-beiizyloxy-imino)-ethyl]-phenyl}-butyl) ester (Compound 10 &amp; Table 2) has an EC50 of 1.15nM in the above assay and is at least 1000 fold selective for EDG-1 compared to EDG-3, EDG-5, EDG-6 and EDG-8.<br><br><br>
B.	In vitro: FLIPR calcium fhix assay<br>
Compounds of the invention are tested for agonist activity on EDG-1, EDG-3, EDG-5, and EDG-6 with a FLIPR calcium flux assay. Briefly, CHO cells expressing an EDG receptor are maintained in F-12K medium (ATCC), containing 5% EBS, with 500ug/ml of G418. Prior to the assay, the cells are plated in 384 black clear bottom plates at the density of 10,000 cells/well/25jxl in the medium of F-12K containing 1% FBS. The second day, the * cells are washed three times (25 pi/each) with washing buffer. About 25 jxl of dye are added to each well and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C and 5% CO2. The cells are then washed four times with washing buffer (25 (il/each). The calcium flux is assayed after adding 25 ^1 of SEQ2871 solution to each well of cells. The same assay is performed with cells expressing each of the different EDG receptors. Titration in the FLIPR calcium flux assay is recorded over a 3-minute interval, and quantitated as maximal peak height percentage response relative to EDG-1 activation.<br>
C.	In vivo: Screening Assays for measurement of blood lymphocyte depletion and<br>
assessment of heart effect<br>
Measurement of circulating lymphocytes: Compounds are dissolved in DMSO and further diluted with deionized water. Mice (C57bl/6 male, 6-10 week-old) are administered 20[xg of compound (diluted in 200 (J.1 water, 4%DMSO) via intra-peritoneal (IP) injection under short isoflurane anesthesia. Water (200 µl), 4% DMSO, and FTY720 (10ng) are included as negative and positive controls, respectively.<br>
Blood is collected from the retro-orbital sinus 18 hours after drug administration under short isoflurane anesthesia. Whole blood samples are subjected to hematology analysis. Peripheral lymphocyte counts are determined using an automated analyzer. Subpopulations of peripheral blood lymphocytes are stained by fluorochrome-conjugated specific antibodies and analyzed using a fluorescent activating cell sorter (Facscalibur). Two mice are used to assess the lymphocyte depletion activity of each compound screened. The result is an ED50, which is defined as the effective dose required displaying 50 % of blood lymphocyte depletion. Compounds of the invention were tested according to the above assay and were preferably found to exhibit an ED50 of less than lmg/kg, more preferably an ED50 of less than 0.5 mg/kg. For example, compound 9 exhibits an ED50 of 0.08 mg/kg.<br><br>
Assessment of Heart Effect: The effects of compounds on cardiac function are nonitored using the AnonyMOUSE ECG screening system. Electrocardiograms are 'ecorded in conscious mice (C57M/6 male, 6-10 week-old) before and after compound administration. ECG signals are then processed and analyzed using the e-MOUSE software. 90 ^g of compound further diluted in 200pl water, 15% DMSO are injected IP. Four mice are used to assess the heart effect of each compound.<br>
D:      In vivo: Antj-angiogenic Activity<br>
Porous chambers containing (i) sphingosine-1-phosphate (5 µM/chamber) or (ii) human VEGF (1 fxg/chamber) in 0.5 ml of 0.8% w/v agar (containing heparin, 20 U/ml) are implanted subcutaneously in the flank of mice. SIP or VEGF induces the growth of vascularized tissue around the chamber. This response is dose-dependent and can be quantified by measuring fee weight and blood content of the tissue. Mice are treated once a day orally or intravenously with a compound of formula I starting 4-6 hours before implantation of the chambers and continuing for 4 days. The animals are sacrificed for measurement of the vascularized tissues 24 hours after the last dose. The weight and blood content of the vascularized tissues around the chamber is determined. Animals treated with a compound of formula I show reduced weight and/or blood content of the vascularized tissues compared to animals treated with vehicle alone. Compounds of Formula I are anti-angiogenic when administered at a dose of about 0.3 to about 3mg/kg.<br>
E:      In vitro: Antitumor Activity<br>
A mouse breast cancer cell line originally isolated from mammary carcinomas is used, e.g. JygMC(A). The cell number is adjusted to 5x105 for plating in fresh medium before the procedure. Cells are incubated with fresh medium containing 2.5mM of thymidine without FCS for 12 hours and then washed twice with PBS, followed by addition of fresh medium with 10% FCS and additionally incubated for another 12 hours. Thereafter the cells are incubated with fresh medium containing 2.5mM of thymidine without FCS for 12 hours. To release the cells from the block, the cells are washed twice with PBS and replated in fresh medium with 10% FCS. After synchronization, the cells are incubated with or without various concentrations of a compound of formula I for 3,6,9,12,18 or 24 hours. The cells<br><br>
are harvested after treatment with 0.2% EDTA, fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol solution, hydrolyzed with 250Dg/ml of RNaseA (type 1-A: Sigma Chem, Co.) at 37°C for 30 minutes and stained with propidium iodide at lOmg/ml for 20 minutes. After the incubation period, the number of cells is determined both by counting cells in a Coulter counter and by the SRB colorimetric assay. Under these conditions compounds of formula I inhibit the proliferation of the tumor cells at concentrations ranging from 10'   to 10  M.<br>
