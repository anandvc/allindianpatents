				<td>This is a divisional application out of Indian Patent Application No. 1755/Del/98.<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 3-Benzyl-4-oxo-<br>
piperidine-3-carboxylic acid alkyl ester derivative of formula c<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION <br>
Growth  hormone  (GH),  which  is  secreted  from  the  pituitary gland, stimulates growth of all tissues of the body that are capable of growing.    In addition, growth hormone is known to have the following basic effects on the metabolic processes of the body:<br>
1.	Increased rate of protein synthesis in substantially all cells of the body;<br>
2.	Decreased rate of carbohydrate utilization in cells of the body; and<br>
3.	Increased mobilization of free fatty adds and use of fatty acids for energy.<br>
Deficiency in growth hormone results in a variety of medical disorders. In children, it causes dwarfism. In adults, the consequences of acquired GH deficiency include profound reduction in lean body mass and concomitant increase in total body fat, particularly in the truncal region. Decreased skeletal and cardiac muscle mass and muscle strength lead to a significant reduction in exercise capacity. Bone density is also reduced. Administration of exogenous growth hormone has been shown to reverse many of the metabolic changes. Additional benefits of therapy have included reduction in LDL cholesterol and improved psychological well-being.<br>
In cases where increased levels of growth hormone were desired, the problem was generally solved by providing exogenous growth hormone or by administering an agent which stimulated growth hormone production and/or release. In either case the peptidyl nature of the compound necessitated that it be administered by injection. Initially the source of growth hormone was the extraction of the pituitary glands of cadavers. This resulted in an expensive product, and carried with it the risk that a disease associated with the source of the pituitary gland could be transmitted to the recipient of the growth hormone (e.g., Jacob-Creutzfeld disease). Recently, recombinant growth hormone has become available which, while no longer carrying any risk of disease transmission, is still a very expensive product which must be given by injection or by a nasal spray.<br>
Most GH deficiencies are caused by defects in GH release, not primary defects in pituitary synthesis of GH. Therefore, an alternative strategy for normalizing serum GH levels is by stimulating its release from somatotrophs. Increasing GH secretion can be achieved by stimulating or inhibiting various neurotransmitter systems in the brain and hypothalamus. As a result, the development of synthetic growth hormone-releasing agents to stimulate pituitary GH secretion are being pursued, and may have several advantages over expensive and inconvenient GH replacement therapy. By acting along physiologic regulatory pathways, the most desirable agents would stimulate pulsatile GH secretion, and excessive levels of GH that have been associated with the undesirable side effects of exogenous GH administration would be avoided by virtue of intact negative feedback loops.<br>
Physiologic and pharmacologic stimulators of GH secretion include arginine, L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), glucagon, vasopressin, and insulin induced hypoglycemia, as well as activities such as sleep and exercise, indirectly cause growth hormone to be released from the pituitary by acting in some fashion on the hypothalamus perhaps either to decrease somatostatin secretion or to increase the secretion of the known secretagogue growth hormone releasing factor (GHRF) or an unknown endogenous growth hormone-releasing hormone or all of these.<br>
Other compounds have been developed which stimulate the release of endogenous growth hormone such as analogous peptidyl compounds related to GRF or the peptides of U.S. Patent 4,411,890. These peptides, while considerably smaller than growth hormones are still susceptible to various proteases. As with most peptides, their potential for oral bioavailability is low. WO 94/13696 refers to certain spiropiperidines and homologues which promote release of growth hormone.<br>
The compounds of WO 94/11012 and WO 94/13696 are reported to be useful in the treatment of osteoporosis in combination with parathyroid hormone or a bisphosphonate.<br>
In one aspect, this invention relates to a method of treating insulin resistant conditions such as Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (NIDDM) and reduced glycemic control associated with obesity and aging in a mammal in need thereof<br>
which comprises administering to said mammal an effective amount of a compound of the formula I, defined below, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
This invention is directed to the use of growth hormone secretagogues specifically growth hormone releasing peptides (GHRP) or GHRP mimetics of formula I, defined below, to improve glycemic control. Agents that increase growth hormone (GH) levels would not be expected to have this effect since it is widely recognized that GH is diabetogenic in animals and in humans. In acromegalics, glucose utilization and suppression of hepatic glucose production are impaired (see Hansen, I., et al., Am J Physiol, 250:E269 (1986)). In this disease of GH excess, impaired glucose handling and hyperinsulinemia have been reversed by pituitary surgery or chemotherapy which reduced GH levels (see Levin S.R., et al., Am J Med, 57:526 (1974), Feek, CM., et al., J Clin Endocrinol 22:532 (1981)). Furthermore, administration of GH to older subjects caused hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia in numerous studies (see Aloia, J.F., et al., J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 43:992 (1976); Binnerts et al., J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 67:1312 (1988); Marcus, R., et al., J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 70:519 (1990)). Therefore, GH therapy is contra-indicated for individuals with diabetes or those at risk for diabetes.<br>
Obesity is a major risk factor for diabetes, and a large fraction of NIDDM patients are obese. Both conditions are characterized by elevated circulating insulin levels and suppressed GH levels. GH treatment of GH-deficient adults (Jorgensen, J.O.L, et al., Lancet 1:1221 (1989)), obese women (Richelsen, B., et al., Am J Physiol, 266:E211 (1994)) and elderly men (Rudman, D., et al, Horm Res 36 (Suppl 1):73 (1991)) has been shown to produce increases in lean body, hepatic and muscle mass while decreasing fat mass. Thus, GH therapy for obesity would seem attractive except for the diabetogenic effects of GH.<br>
An alternative to exogenous GH administration is therapy that stimulates endogenous GH secretion. It has been shown that a substantial pituitary reserve of GH is present in pituitary-intact GH-deficient patients and the elderly so that decreased serum GH levels are due to hyposecretion.<br>
Hyposecretion of GH in several clinical settings (obesity, aging, glucocorticoid suppression) is relatively resistant to stimulation by GHRH (Gertz,<br>
B.J., et al., J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 79:745 (1994); Arvat, E., et al., J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 79:1440 (1994); Maccario, M., et al., Metabolism, 44:134 (1995)). In contrast, administration of a GHRP or combined administration of GHRH and a GHRP in these patients can elicit a robust GH response (Aloi, J.A., et al., J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 79:943; (1994)). Single dose studies of GHRPs have demonstrated the absence of an acute effect on circulating insulin or glucose levels. Insulin and glucose have generally not been monitored in chronic studies except to document the absence of unfavorable changes (Jacks, T., et al., J Endocrinol. 143:399 (1993)).<br>
Prior to the present invention, the use of GHRPs or GHRP mimetics to improve glycemic control has not specifically been explored. The method of treating insulin resistance in a mammal comprising the administration of a compound of formula I is practiced preferentially in patients who have a functional hypothalamic-pituitary axis capable of GH secretory responses to GHRPs and who are diabetics (Type I or Type II), or are insulin resistant, or who show impaired glucose tolerance.<br>
In another aspect, this invention is directed to methods for the treatment or prevention of congestive heart failure, obesity and frailty associated with aging, in a mammal in need thereof, which comprises administering to said mammal simultaneously, sequentially in any order or as a combination a functional somatostatin antagonist such as an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, for example clonidine, xylazine or medetomidine, and a compound of formula I, defined below. In another aspect, this invention provides methods for accelerating bone fracture repair and wound healing, attenuating protein catabolic response after a major operation, and reducing cachexia and protein loss due to chronic illness in a mammal in need thereof, which comprises administering to said mammal simultaneously, sequentially in any order or as a combination an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, such as clonidine, xylazine or medetomidine and a compound of formula I, defined below. Clonidine, which is disclosed in US Patent No. 3,202,660 the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference, xylazine, which is disclosed in US Patent No. 3,235,550 the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference and medetomidine, which is disclosed in US Patent No. 4,544,664 the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. It has been<br>
shown that alpha-2 adrenergic agonists cause release of endogenous growth hormone in human and canine subjects (Cella et al., Life Sciences (1984), 34:447-454; Hampshire J, Altszuler N. American Journal of Veterinary Research (1981), 42:6, 1073-1076; Vaicavi et al., Clinical Endocrinology (1988), 29:309-316; Morrison et al., American Journal of Veterinary Research (1990), 51:1, 65-70;), and that the co-administration of an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist with growth hormone-releasing factor restores defective growth hormone secretion in aged dogs (Arce et al., Brain Research (1990), 537:359-362; Cella et. al., Neuroendocrinology (1993), 57:432-438).<br>
In yet another aspect, this invention provides a process for the synthesis of a compound of the formula Z<br>
(Formula Removed)  <br>
where the process is described below.<br>
Further, this invention is directed to processes for preparing certain intermediates, shown below, which are useful in the synthesis of the compound of formula Z.<br>

The term "halogenated alkyl" is intended to include an alkyl group as defined hereinabove substituted by one or more halogen atoms as defined hereinabove.<br>
The term "halogenated cycloalkyl" is intended to include a cycloalkyl group substituted by one or more halogen atoms as defined hereinabove.<br>
The term "aryl" is intended to include phenyl and naphthyl and aromatic 5-and 6-membered rings with 1 to 4 heteroatoms or fused 5- or 6-membered bicyclic rings with 1 to 4 heteroatoms of nitrogen, sulfur or oxygen. Examples of such heterocyclic aromatic rings are pyridine, thiophene (also known as thienyl), furan, benzothiophene, tetrazole, indole, N-methylindole, dihydroindole, indazole, N-formylindole, benzimidazole, thiazole, pyrimidine, and thiadiazole.<br>
The chemist of ordinary skill will recognize that certain combinations of heteroatom-containing substituents listed in this invention define compounds which will be less stable under physiological conditions (e.g., those containing acetal or aminal linkages). Accordingly, such compounds are less preferred.<br>
The expression "prodrug" refers to compounds that are drug precursors, which following administration, release the drug in vivo via some chemical or physiological process (e.g., a prodrug on being brought to the physiological pH is converted to the desired drug form). Exemplery prodrugs upon cleavage release the corresponding free acid, and such hydrolyzable ester-forming residues of the compounds of this invention include but are not limited to carboxylic acid substituents (e.g., R1 is -(CH2)qC(0)2X6 where X6 is hydrogen, or R2 or A1 contains carboxylic acid) wherein the free hydrogen is replaced by (C1-C4)alkyl, (C2-C12)alkanoyloxymethyl, (C4-C9)1-(alkanoyloxy)ethyl, 1-methyl-1-(alkanoyloxy)-ethyl having from 5 to 10 carbon atoms, alkoxycarbonyl-oxymethyl having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, 1-(alkoxycarbonyloxy)ethyl having from 4 to 7 carbon atoms, 1-methyl-1-(alkoxycarbonyloxy)ethyl having from 5 to 8 carbon atoms, N-(alkoxycarbonyl)aminomethyl having from 3 to 9 carbon atoms, 1-(N-(alkoxycarbonyl)amino)ethyl having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms, 3-phthalidyl, 4-crotonolactonyl, gamma-butyrolacton-4-yl, di-N,N-(C1-C2)alkylamino(C2-C3)alkyl (such as ß-dimethylamfnoethyl), carbamoyl-(C1-C2)alkyl, N,N-di(C1-C2)-alkylcarbamoyl-(C1-C2)alkyl and piperidino-, pyrrolidine- or morpholino(C2-C3)alkyl.<br>
Other exemplary prodrugs release an alcohol of formula I wherein the free<br>
hydrogen of the hydroxyl substituent (e.g., R1 contains hydroxyl) is replaced by<br>
(C1-C6)alkanoyloxymethyl,     1-((C1-C6)alkanoyloxy)ethyl,	1 -methyl- 1-((C1-<br>
C6)alkanoyl- oxy)ethyi, (C1-C6)alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl, N-(C1-C6)alkoxy-carbonylamino-methyl, succinoyl, (C1-C6)alkanoyl, a-amino(C1-C4)alkanoyl, arylacetyl and a-aminoacyl, or α-aminoacyl-α-aminoacyl wherein said α-aminoacyl<br>
moieties are independently any of the naturally occurring L-amino acids found in proteins, P(0)(OH)2, -P(0)(0(C1-C6)alkyl)2 or glycosyl (the radical resulting from detachment of the hydroxyl of the hemiacetal of a carbohydrate).<br>
Prodrugs of compounds of formula I where a carboxyl group in a carboxylic acid of formula I is replaced by an ester may be prepared by combining the carboxylic acid with the appropriate alkyl halide in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate in an inert solvent such as DMF at a temperature of about 0 °C to 100 °C for about 1 to about 24 hours. Alternatively, the acid is combined with the appropriate alcohol as solvent in the presence of a catalytic amount of acid such as concentrated sulfuric acid at a temperature of about 20 °C to 120 °C, preferably at reflux, for about 1 hour to about 24 hours. Another method is the reaction of the acid in an inert solvent such as THF, with concomitant removal of the water being produced by physical (e.g., Dean Stark trap) or chemical (e.g., molecular sieves) means.<br>
Prodrugs of compounds of formula I where an alcohol function has been derivatized as an ether may be prepared by combining the alcohol with the appropriate alkyl bromide or iodide in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate in an inert solvent such as DMF at a temperature of about 0 °C to 100 °C for about 1 to about 24 hours. Alkanoylaminomethyl ethers may be obtained by reaction of the alcohol with a bis-(alkanoylamino)methane in the presence of a catalytic amount of acid in an inert solvent such as THF, according to a method described in US 4,997,984. Alternatively, these compounds may be prepared by the methods described by Hoffman et al. in J. Org. Chem. 1994, 59, p. 3530.<br>
Certain of the above defined terms may occur more than once in the above formula and upon such occurrence each term shall be defined independently of the other.<br>

The compounds utilized in a method of the instant invention all have at least one asymmetric center as noted by the asterisk in the structural formula I, above. Additional asymmetric centers may be present on the molecule depending upon the nature of the various substituents on the molecule. Each such asymmetric center will produce two optical isomers and it is intended that all such optical isomers, as separated, pure or partially purified optical isomers, racemic<br><br>
mixtures or diastereomeric mixtures thereof, be included within the scope of the instant invention. In the case of the asymmetric center represented by the asterisk, it has been found that the absolute stereochemistry of the more active and, thus, more preferred isomer is shown in formula IA. This preferred absolute configuration also applies to formula I.<br><br>
(Formula Removed)  <br>
 (IA) With the R4 substituent as hydrogen, the spatial configuration of the asymmetric center corresponds to that in a D-amino acid.     In most cases this is also designated an R-configuration although this will vary according to the values of R3 and R4 used in making R- or S-stereochemical assignments.<br>
The compounds of formula I utilized in methods of the instant invention are generally isolated in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, such as the salts derived from using inorganic and organic acids. Examples of such acids are hydrochloric, nitric, sulfuric, phosphoric, formic, acetic, trifluoroacetic, propionic, maleic, succinic, D-tartaric, L-tartaric, malonic, methane sulfonic and the like. In addition, certain compounds containing an acidic function such as a carboxy can be isolated in the form of their inorganic salt in which the counter-ion can be selected from sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium, magnesium and the like, as well as from organic bases.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts are formed by taking about 1 equivalent of a compound of formula I and contacting it with about 1 equivalent of the appropriate corresponding acid of the salt which is desired. Work-up and isolation of the resulting salt is well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The present invention includes within its scope pharmaceutical compositions comprising, as an active ingredient, an insulin resistance treating amount of at least one of the compounds of formula I in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Further, the present invention includes within<br>
its scope pharmaceutical compositions comprising, as an active ingredient, at least one alpha-2 adrenergic agonist and at least one of the compounds of fonmula I in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Optionally, the pharmaceutical compositions can further comprise an anabolic agent in addition to at least one of the compounds of formula I or another compound which exhibits a different activity, e.g., an antibiotic growth permittant or with other pharmaceutically active materials wherein the combination enhances efficacy and minimizes side effects. Assay for stimulation of GH release from rat pituicvtes<br>
Compounds that have the ability to stimulate GH secretion from cultured rat pituitary cells are identified using the following protocol. This test is also useful for comparison to standards to determine dosage levels. Cells are isolated from pituitaries of 6-week old male Wistar rats.   Following decapitation, the anterior pituitary lobes are removed into cold, sterile Hank's balanced salt solution without calcium or magnesium (HBSS).  Tissues are finely minced, then subjected to two cycles of mechanically assisted enzymatic dispersion using 10 U/mL bacterial protease (EC 3.4.24.4, Sigma P-6141, St. Louis, Missouri) in HBSS.   The tissue-enzyme mixture is stirred in a spinner flask at 30 rpm in a 5% C02 atmosphere at about 37 °C for about 30 min., with manual trituration after about 15 min. and about 30 min. using a 10-mL pipet. This mixture is centrifuged at 200 x g for about 5 min.   Horse serum (35% final concentration) is added to the supernatant to neutralize excess protease. The pellet is resuspended in fresh protease (10 U/mL), stirred for about 30 min.  more under the previous conditions, and manually triturated, ultimately through a 23-gauge needle.   Again, horse serum (35% final concentration) is added, then the cells from both digests are combined, pelleted (200 x g for about 15 min.), resuspended in culture medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (D-MEM) supplemented with 4.5 g/L glucose, 10% horse serum, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, 1% non-essential amino acids, 100 U/mL nystatin and 50 mg/mL gentamycin sulfate, Gibco, Grand Island, New York) and counted.   Cells<br>

Just prior to GH secretion assay, culture wells are rinsed twice with release medium, then equilibrated for about 30 minutes in release medium (D-MEM<br>
buffered with 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4 and containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C). Test compounds are dissolved in DMSO, then diluted into pre-warmed release medium. Assays are run in quadruplicate. The assay is initiated by adding 0.5 ml_ of release medium (with vehicle or test compound) to each culture well. Incubation is carried out at about 37 °C for about 15 minutes, then terminated by removal of the release medium, which is centrifuged at 2000 x g for about 15 minutes to remove cellular material. Rat growth hormone concentrations in the supernatants are determined by a standard radioimmunoassay protocol described below. Measurement of rat growth hormone<br>
Rat growth hormone concentrations were determined by double antibody radioimmunoassay using a rat growth hormone reference preparation (NIDDK-rGH-RP-2) and rat growth hormone antiserum raised in monkey (NIDDK-anti-rGH-S-5) obtained from Dr. A. Parlow (Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrence, CA). Additional rat growth hormone (1.5U/mg, #G2414, Scripps Labs, San Diego, CA) is iodinated to a specific activity of approximately 30 uCi/ug by the chloramine T method for use as tracer. Immune complexes are obtained by adding goat antiserum to monkey IgG (ICN/Cappel, Aurora, OH) plus polyethylene glycol, MW 10,000-20,000 to a final concentration of 4.3%; recovery is accomplished by centrifugation. This assay has a working range of 0.08-2.5 ug rat growth hormone per tube above basal levels.<br>
Assay for Exoaenouslv-Stimulated Growth Hormone Release in the Rat after Intravenous Administration of Test Compounds<br>
Twenty-one day old female Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratory, Wilmington, MA) are allowed to acclimate to local vivarium conditions (24 °C, 12 hr light, 12 hr dark cycle) for approximately 1 week before compound testing. All rats are allowed access to water and a pelleted commercial diet (Agway Country Food, Syracuse NY) ad libitum. The experiments are conducted in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.<br>
On the day of the experiment, test compounds are dissolved in vehicle containing 1% ethanol, 1 mM acetic acid and 0.1% bovine serum albumin in saline. Each test is conducted in three rats. Rats are weighed and anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (Nembutol®, 50 mg/kg body<br>
weight). Fourteen minutes after anesthetic administration, a blood sample is taken by nicking the tip of the tail and allowing the blood to drip into a microcentrifuge tube (baseline blood sample, approximately 100 ul). Fifteen minutes after anesthetic administration, test compound is delivered by intravenous injection into the tail vein, with a total injection volume of 1 mL/kg body weight. Additional blood samples are taken from the tail at 5, 10 and 15 minutes after compound administration. Blood samples are kept on ice until serum separation by centrifugation (1430xg for 10 minutes at 10°C). Serum is stored at -80 °C until serum growth hormone determination by radioimmunoassay as described above. Assessment of Exogenouslv-Stimulated Growth Hormone Release in the Dog after Oral Administration<br>
On the day of dosing, the test compound is weighed out for the appropriate dose and dissolved in water. Doses are delivered at a volume of 0.5-3 mL/kg by gavage to 2-4 dogs for each dosing regimen. Blood samples (5 ml_) are collected from the jugular vein by direct vena puncture pre-dose and at 0.17, 0.33, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours post dose using 5 mL vacutainers containing lithium heparin. The prepared plasma is stored at -20 °C until analysis. Measurement of Canine Growth Hormone<br>
Canine growth hormone concentrations are determined by a standard radioimmunoassay protocol using canine growth hormone (antigen for iodination and reference preparation AFP-1983B) and canine growth hormone antiserum raised in monkey (AFP-21452578) obtained from Dr. A. Parlow (Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrence, CA). Tracer is produced by chloramine T-iodination of canine growth hormone to a specific activity of 20-40 uCi/ug. Immune complexes are obtained by adding goat antiserum to monkey IgG (ICN/Cappel, Aurora, OH) plus polyethylene glycol, MW 10,000-20,000 to a final concentration of 4.3%; recovery is accomplished by centrifugation. This assay has a working range of 0.08-2.5 ug canine GH/tube.<br>
Assessment of Canine Growth Hormone and Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 Levels in the dog after chronic oral administration<br>
The dogs receive test compound daily for either 7 or 14 days. Each day of dosing, the test compound is weighed out for the appropriate dose and dissolved in water.  Doses are delivered at a volume of 0.5-3 ml/kg by gavage to 5 dogs for<br>
each dosing regimen. Blood samples are collected at days 0, 3, 7, 10 and 14. Blood samples (5 ml) are obtained by direct venipuncture of the jugular vein at pre-dose, 0.17, 0.33, 0.5, 0.754, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours post administration on days 0, 7 and 14 using 5 ml vacutainers containing lithium heparin. In addition, blood is drawn pre-dose and 8 hours on days 3 and 10. The prepared plasma is stored at -20 °C until analysis. Female Rat Study<br>
This study evaluates the effect of chronic treatment with a GHRP mimetic on weight, body composition and non-fasting plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, lactate and lipids in estrogen-deficient and estrogen-replete female rats. Acute responsiveness of serum GH levels to i.v. administration of the GH releasing agent was assessed on the last day of dosing. Body weight was monitored weekly throughout the treatment period; additionally, body composition and plasma levels of glucose, insulin, lactate, cholesterol and triglycerides were assessed at the end of treatment.<br>
Virgin female Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) and underwent bilateral ovariectomy (Ovx) or sham-surgery (Sham) at approximately 12 weeks of age. For sham surgeries, ovaries were exteriorized and replaced into the abdominal cavity. Following surgery the rats were housed individually in 20 cm x 32 cm x 20 cm cages under standard vivarium conditions (about 24 °C with about 12 hours light/12 hours dark cycle). All rats were allowed free access to water and a pelleted commercial diet (Agway ProLab 3000, Agway Country Food, Inc., Syracuse, NY). The experiment was conducted in accordance with NIH Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.<br>
Approximately seven months post-surgery, Sham and Ovx rats were weighed and randomly assigned to groups. Rats were dosed daily by oral gavage with 1 mL of either vehicle (1% ethanol in distilled-deionized water), 0.5 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg of a growth hormone releasing agent for 90 days. Rats were weighed at weekly intervals throughout the study. Twenty-four hours after the last oral dose, the acute response of serum growth hormone (GH) to test agent was assessed by the following procedure. Rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital 50 mg/kg.   Anesthetized rats were weighed and a baseline blood sample (-100 ul)<br>
was collected from the tail vein. Test agent (growth hormone releasing agent or vehicle) was then administered intravenously via the tail vein in 1 ml_. Approximately ten minutes after injection, a second 100 ul blood sample was collected from the tail. Blood was allowed to clot at about 4 °C, then centnfuged at 2000xg for about 10 minutes. Serum was stored at about -70 °C. Serum growth hormone concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay as previously described. Following this procedure, each anesthetized rat underwent whole body scanning by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA, Hologic QDR 1000/W, Waltham MA). A final blood sample was collected by cardiac puncture into heparinized tubes. Plasma was separated by centrifugation and stored frozen as described above.<br>
Plasma insulin is determined by radioimmunoassay using a kit from Binax Corp. (Portland, Maine). The interassay coefficient of variation is £ 10%. Plasma triglycerides, total cholesterol, glucose and lactate levels are measured using Abbott VP™ and VP Super System® Autoanalyzer (Abbott Laboratories, Irving, Texas), using the A-Gent™ Triglycerides, Cholesterol and Glucose Test reagent systems, and a lactate kit from Sigma, respectively. The plasma insulin, triglycerides, total cholesterol and lactate lowering activity of a growth hormone releasing peptide (GHRP) or GHRP mimetic such as a compound of formula I, are determined by statistical analysis (unpaired t-test) with the vehicle-treated control group.<br>
The compounds of formula I utilized in a method of this invention can be administered by oral, parenteral (e.g., intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous or subcutaneous injection, or implant), nasal, vaginal, rectal, sublingual, or topical routes of administration and can be formulated with phanmaceutically acceptable carriers to provide dosage forms appropriate for each route of administration.<br>
Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is admixed with at least one inert pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as sucrose, lactose, or starch. Such dosage forms can also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than such inert diluents, e.g., lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the<br>
dosage forms  may also comprise buffering agents.     Tablets  and  pills  can additionally be prepared with enteric coatings.<br>
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, the elixirs containing inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water. Besides such inert diluents, compositions can also include adjuvants, such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, and sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents.<br>
Preparations according to this invention for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, or emulsions. Examples of non-aqueous solvents or vehicles are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils, such as olive oil and com oil, gelatin, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Such dosage forms may also contain adjuvants such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying, and dispersing agents. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, by incorporating sterilizing agents into the compositions, by irradiating the compositions, or by heating the compositions. They can also be manufactured in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved in sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use.<br>
Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which may contain, in addition to the active substance, excipients such as coca butter or a suppository wax.<br>
Compositions for nasal or sublingual administration are also prepared with standard excipients well known in the art.<br>
The dosage of active ingredient in the compositions of this invention may be varied; however, it is necessary that the amount of the active ingredient be such that a suitable dosage form is obtained. The selected dosage depends upon the desired therapeutic effect, on the route of administration, and on the duration of the treatment. Generally, dosage levels of between 0.0001 to 100 mg/kg of body weight daily are administered to humans and other animals, e.g., mammals, to obtain effective release of growth hormone.<br>
A preferred dosage range in humans is 0.01 to 5.0 mg/kg of body weight daily which can be administered as a single dose or divided into multiple doses.<br>
A preferred dosage range in animals other than humans is 0.01 to 10.0 mg/kg of body weight daily which can be administered as a single dose or divided into multiple doses. A more preferred dosage range in animals other than humans is 0.1 to 5 mg/kg of body weight daily which can be administered as a single dose or divided into multiple doses.<br>

Many of the schemes illustrated below describe compounds which contain protecting groups Prt, Z100 or Z200. Benzyloxycarbonyl groups can be removed by a number of methods including, catalytic hydrogenation with hydrogen in the presence of a palladium or platinum catalyst in a protic solvent such as methanol. Preferred catalysts are palladium hydroxide on carbon or palladium on carbon. Hydrogen pressures from 1-1000 psi may be employed; pressures from 10 to 70 psi are preferred. Alternatively, the benzyloxycarbonyl group can be removed by transfer hydrogenation.<br>
Removal of BOC protecting groups can be carried out using a strong acid such as trifluoroacetic acid or hydrochloric acid with or without the presence of a cosolvent such as dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, ether or methanol at a temperature of about -30 to 70 °C, preferably about -5 to about 35 °C.<br>

Proton and carbon NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian XL-300, Bruker AC-300, Varian Unity 400 or Bruker AC-250 at 25 °C Chemical shifts are expressed in parts per million down field from trimethylsilane Particle beam mass spectra were obtained on a Hewlett-Packard 5989A spectrometer using ammonia as the source of chemical ionization. For initial sample dissolution, chloroform or methanol was employed. Liquid secondary ion mass spectra (LSIMS) were obtained on a Kratos Concept- 1S high resolution spectrometer using cesium ion bombardment on a sample dissolved in a 1:5 mixture of dithioerythritol and dithiothreitol or in a thioglycerol matrix. For initial sample dissolution chloroform or methanol was employed. Reported data are sums of 3-20 scans calibrated against cesium iodide. TLC analyses were performed using E. Merck Kieselgel 60 F254 silica plates visualized (after elution with the indicated solvent(s)) by staining with 15% ethanolic phosphomolybdic acid and heating on a hot plate.<br>
General Procedure A (Peptide coupling using EDC): A 0.2-0.5 M solution of the primary amine (1.0 equivalent) in dichloromethane (or a primary amine hydrochloride and 1.0-1.3 equivalents of triethylamine) is treated sequentially with 1.0-1.2 equivalents of the carboxylic acid coupling partner, 1.5-1.8 equivalents hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate (HOBT) or HOAT and 1.0-1.2 equivalents (stoichiometrically equivalent to the quantity of carboxylic acid) 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and the mixture is<br>
stirred overnight in an ice bath (the ice bath is allowed to warm, thus the reaction mixture is typically held at about 0-20 °C for about 4-6 h and about 20-25 °C for the remaining period). The mixture is diluted with ethyl acetate or other solvent as specified, and the resulting mixture washed twice with 1N NaOH, twice with 1N HCI (if the product is not basic), once with brine, dried over Na2S04, and concentrated giving the crude product which is purified as specified. The carboxylic acid component can be used as the dicyclohexylamine salt in coupling to the primary amine or hydrochloride of the latter; in this case no triethylamine is employed.<br>
