COMPLETE SPECIFICATION [See Section 10] <br><br><br>
UNIVATION TECHNOLOGIES LLC, a Delaware company of Suite  1950, 5555 San Felipe, Houston, Texas 77056, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br>
/<br><br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a method to feed multiple catalysts systems into a polymerization reactor, preferably a gas or slurry phase polymerization reactor.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The demands of polyolefin fabricators are increasingly becoming more and more specific. In an attempt to meet these demands polyolefin producers are attempting to create more and more specialized polyolefins that have particular product configurations. One means to do this comprises using two catalysts in the same reactor to produce intimately mixed polymer blends. The difficulty however lies in selecting compatible catalysts that will actually work together well and reactor conditions that do not benefit one catalyst while hindering another.<br>
Mobil, in PCT patent application WO 99/03899, discloses using a metallocene type catalyst and a Ziegler-Natta type catalyst in the same reactor to produce a bimodal molecular weight distribution (MWD) high-density polyethylene (HDPE). These two catalyst however were fed into the reactor as supported powders.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a method to feed multiple catalysts systems into a polymerization reactor, preferably a gas or slurry phase polymerization reactor. The catalysts, activators and /or catalyst systems are preferably introduced into the reactor in a liquid carrier, preferably in solution. The catalysts, activators, catalysts systems, etc may be combined in different orders and in different amounts. The individual catalysts or activators may be introduced into the reactor directly or they may be combined with one or more other catalysts and or activators prior to being placed in the reactor. Further the catalysts, activators and/or catalyst systems (and the carriers) may be contacted sequentially, in series or in parallel. Each catalyst, however, is independently activated.<br><br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
In a preferred embodiment this invention relates to a method to introduce multiple catalysts, activators, or catalyst systems into a polymerization reactor, preferably a gas phase reactor. For the purposes of this invention the term "catalyst" refers to a metal compound that when combined with an activator polymerizes olefins. For the purposes of this invention, the term "catalyst system" refers to the combination of a catalyst and an activator. For the purposes of this invention the term "activator" is used interchangeably with the term "co-catalyst."<br>
The catalyst system(s), the catalysts and or the activators are preferably introduced into the reactor in one or more liquid carriers, preferably as a solution, suspension or an emulsion. For example, in one embodiment, a solution of two catalyst systems in an alkane such as pentane, hexane, toluene, isopentane or the like is introduced into the gas or slurry phase reactor. In another embodiment the catalyst or activator or both are contacted in a liquid carrier with a surfactant to produced an emulsion, then the emulsion is introduced into a reactor, such as for example, by spraying the emulsion into a particle lean zone. (Particle lean zones are described in U S Patent 5,693,727, incorporated by reference herein.)<br>
The catalysts, activators, catalysts systems, etc may be combined in different orders and in different amounts. In some embodiments the each catalyst may be contacted with the same or different activators. Likewise the catalysts may be contacted with each other first then contacted with the activator(s). Similarly the activator may be contacted with one catalyst first with the second catalyst being added thereafter. Further there may be time periods, anywhere from 1 second to several days or more between each of the contacts.<br>
In the various activation and feed schemes possible in the practice of this invention it is particularly preferred that each catalyst be independently activated. By independently activated is meant that each catalyst has an opportunity to combine or react with an activator without having to compete for the activator with another catalyst. For example in one embodiment the two catalysts are activated in separate chambers then combined before introduction into the reactor. In another embodiment a first catalyst is activated with an activator, thereafter a second catalyst is added to the first catalysts/activator combination and allowed to react/combine with the excess activator. In this embodiment the second catalyst is still activated independently from the first. Likewise in another embodiment two<br><br>
more catalysts can be activated independently at the same time in the same solution as long as sufficient activator for both catalysts to be activated.<br>
In another particularly preferred embodiment, the various catalyst combinations are all combined prior to being introduced into the reactor. The catalyst combinations may be fed into the reactor from multiple injection points, however it is preferred that the same catalyst solution be fed into the reactor through all the injection points.<br>
In particular this invention relates to the following illustrations of combinations. In the following illustrations, A refers to a catalyst or mixture of catalysts, and B refers to a different catalyst or mixture of catalysts. The mixtures of catalysts in A and B can be the same catalysts, just in different ratios. Graphic representations of theses illustrations are Figures 1-9. Further, it is noted that additional solvents or inert gases may be added at many locations.<br>
Illustration 1: A and B plus the activator are mixed off-line and then fed to the reactor.<br>
Illustration 2: A and B are mixed off-line. Activator is added on-line and then fed to the reactor.<br>
Illustration 3: A or B is contacted with the activator (off-line) and then either A or B is added on-line before entering the reactor.<br>
Illustration 4: A or B is contacted with the activator (on-line) and then either A or B is added on-line before entering the reactor.<br>
Illustration 5: A and B are each contacted with the activator off-line. Then A + activator and + cocatalyst are contacted on-line before entering the reactor.<br>
Illustration 6: A and B are each contacted with the activator on-line. Then A + activator and B + activator are contacted on-line before entering the reactor. (This is a preferred configuration since the ratio of A to B and the ratio of activator to A and the ratio of activator to B can be controlled independently.)<br>
Illustration 7: In this example, A or B is contacted with the activator (on-line) while a separate solution of either A or B is contacted with activator off-line. Then both stream of A or B + activator are contacted on-line before entering the reactor.<br><br>
Illustration 8: A is contacted on-line with B. Then, an activator is fed to on-line to ie A+B mixture.<br>
Illustration 9: A is activated with activator off-line. Then A + activator is contacted n-line with B. Then, an activator is fed to in-line to the A+B+ activator mixture.<br>
Illustration 10: A and B are mixed off-line. Then the mixture of Aand B is Dntacted on-line with activator, then additional catalyst A is added on line, thereafter iditional catlayst B is added on-line and then the whole mixture is introduced into the factor.<br>
In any of the above illustrations, a means for mixing and/or creating a certain residence time may be employed. For example a mixing blade or screw may be used to mix" the components or a certain length pipe may be used to obtain a desired contact or residence time between the components.<br>
"On-line" means the material described is in a pipe, tube, or vessel which is directly or indirectly connected to the reactor system.<br>
"Off-line" means the material described is in a pipe, tube, or vessel which is not connected to the reactor system.<br>
In a preferred embodiment this invention relates to a method to polymerize olefins in a gas-phase reactor wherein at least two catalysts and at least one activator are introduced in the polymerization reactor in a liquid carrier.

Preferred activators include alkyl aluminum compounds (such as diethylaluminum chloride), alumoxanes, modified alumoxanes, non-coordinating anions, non-coordinating group 13 metal or metalloid anions, boranes, borates and the like.

There are a variety of methods for preparing alumoxane and modified alumoxanes, non-limiting examples of which are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,665,208, 4,952,540, 5,091,352, 5,206,199, 5,204,419, 4,874,734, 4,924,018, 4,908,463, 4,968,827, 5,308,815, 5,329,032, 5,248,801, 5,235,081, 5,157,137, 5,103,031, 5,391,793, 5,391,529, 5,041,584 5,693,838, 5,731,253, 5,041,584 and 5,731,451 and European publications EP-A-0 561 476, EP-Bl-0 279 586 and EP-A-0 594-218, and PCT publication WO 94/10180, all of which are herein fully incorporated by reference.<br>

Such compounds and the like are described in European publications EP-A-0 570 982, EP-A-0 520 732, EP-A-0 495 375, EP-A-0 426 637, EP-A-500 944, EP-A-0 277 003 and EP-A-0 277 004, and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,153,157, 5,198,401, 5,066,741, 5,206,197, 5,241,025, 5,387,568, 5,384,299, 5,502,124 and 5,643,847, all of which are herein fully incorporated by reference. Other activators include those described in PCT publication WO 98/07515 such as tris (2, 2', 2"- nonafiuorobiphenyl) fluoroaluminate, which is fully incorporated herein by reference. Combinations of activators are also contemplated by the invention, for example, alumoxanes and ionizing activators in combinations, see for example, PCT publications WO 94/07928 and WO 95/14044 and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,153,157 and 5,453,410 all of which are herein fully incorporated by reference. Also, methods of activation such as using radiation and the like are also contemplated as activators for the purposes of this invention.<br>
When two different catalysts are used, the first and second catalyst compounds may be combined at molar ratios of 1:1000 to 1000:1, preferably 1:99 to 99:1, preferably 10:90 to 90:10, more preferably 20:80 to 80:20, more preferably 30:70 to 70:30, more preferably<br><br><br>
0:60 to 60:40. The particular ratio chosen will depend on the end product desired and/or the method of activation. One practical method to determine which ratio is best to obtain the desired polymer is to start with a 1:1 ratio, measure the desired property in the product produced and adjust the ratio accordingly.<br>
Multi-component catalyst systems with similar activity decay rates provide a route for olefin polymerization in which the effects of catalyst residence time in the reactor can be mitigated. The catalysts preferably have a decay rate that is similar as measured by a decay model, be it first or higher order. The decay rates or alternatively, the catalyst half lives, are preferably within about 40% of each other, more preferably about 20% of each other, and most preferably about 10 to 0% of each other. 0% would mean essentially the same.<br>
It is recognized that the decay characteristics can be affected by temperature, monomer pressure, comonomer type and concentration, hydrogen, additives/modifiers/other catalysts, catalyst poisons or impurities in the gas stream, presence of condensing agents or operation in condensirig-mode.<br>
A corollary to this is that one or both of the catalysts can have a fast decay such that they are relatively insensitive to residence time effects in the normal range of reactor operation. One can calculate how much the decay rates can differ between catalysts based upon their respective decay rates, in order that the variation of polymer properties in the reactor is relatively small when there are changes in residence time.<br>
In another embodiment the first catalyst is selected because when used alone it produces a high weight average molecular weight polymer (such as for example above 100, 000, preferably above 150, 000, preferably above 200,000, preferably above 250,000, more preferably above 300,000) and the second catalyst is selected because when used alone it produces a low molecular weight polymer (such as for example below 80,000, preferably below 70,000, preferably below 60,000, more preferably below 50,000, more preferably below 40,000, more preferably below 30,000, more preferably below 20,000 and above 5,000, more preferably below 20,000 and above 10,000).<br>
When three or more catalysts are used multi component catalyst polymerization split can be estimated and controlled by perturbing the feed rate of one or both of the catalyst feed rates to the polymerization reactor and measuring the change in polymer production rate. The invention is especially useful when the catalysts are indistinguishable elementally<br><br>
but can be used with other systems. It is especially applicable in systems where the relative amounts of each catalyst can be easily varied such as for solution feed or hybrid solution feed.<br>
The change in catalyst feed is less than 40%, preferably less than 15% and most preferably about 5 to 10%. There are accompanying changes in the polymer split composition, however, these are relatively small and may be inconsequential as the time¬frame for observing changes in production rate may be short relative to residence time in the reactor. The change in polymer composition is diluted.<br>
The production rate need not line out, but can be estimated mathematically when it is about 30 to 80% of its final value based upon theoretical response of CSTR (continuous stirred tank reactor) to a step change.<br>
The simplest case is for a catalyst with very fast decay so residence time effects are inconsequential (although decay can easily be dealt with using a simple formula). As an example, let catalyst A and B be fed at a 50:50 rate, producing 10,000 pph of resin. Increase catalyst A by 10% and hold B constant so the feed split is now 55:50. The production rate increases from 10,000 to 10,500 pph. The difference of 5000 pph is attributable to the 10% increase of catalyst A, so the initial amount of resin produce by A was 5000 pph and its new value is 5500 pph. The initial polymer split was 50:50 and the new split is 55:50. (In this example, the catalysts were taken to be equally active, but the equation work for other sytems.<br>
The catalyst feed rate or one or both catalysts can be constantly perturbed by small amounts continuously around the aim split (back and forth) so that the net resin composition is always around the aim split. A step change is made and the response measured. The system performance can include an update term based on measured split to account for variations in catalyst productivity and decay.<br>
Catalyst productivity models including the effects of temperature, residence time, monomer partial pressure, comonomer type and concentration, hydrogen concentration, impurities, inerts such as isopentane, and/or operation in or close to condensing mode can be used for each component of a separate addition, multi-component polymerization system for polymerization fraction split control. In response to changes in variables, the feed rates of component catalysts can be adjusted. For example, a change in residence time can be<br><br>
compensated for by forward control that automatically adjusts the catalysts feed rates to a new aim value. Effects of temperature, partial pressure and other variables can also be compensated in a feed forward fashion.<br>
The models can also be used for process control based upon measured polymer split fractions. Ethylene partial pressure, for example could be adjusted by the models based upon the measured split. The concentration of an inert that affects the productivity of one catalyst more than the other could also be adjusted (like isopentane due presumably to its tempered cooling effect).<br>
Most commonly, the catalyst feed rates would be adjusted to move the measured polymer split back to aim. The effects of catalyst decay and residence time are part of the model, so the even the use of catalysts with significant or different decay rates can be controlled.<br>
The instant invention is applicable to gas phase polymerization with solution or liquid feed.<br>
In general the combined catalysts and the activator are combined in ratios of about 1000:1 to about 0.5:1. In a preferred embodiment the catalysts and the activator are combined in a ratio of about 300:1 to about 1:1, preferably about 150:1 to about 1:1, for boranes, borates, aluminates, etc. the ratio is preferably about 1:1 to about 10:1 and for alkyl aluminum compounds (such as diethylaluminum chloride combined with water) the ratio is preferably about 0.5:1 to about 10:1.<br>
Polymerization Process:<br>
The catalysts, activators and catalyst systems described above are suitable for use in any polymerization process, including solution, gas or slurry processes or a combination thereof, most preferably a gas or slurry phase process.<br>
In one embodiment, this invention is directed toward the polymerization or copolymerization reactions involving the polymerization of one or more monomers having from 2 to 30 carbon atoms, preferably 2-12 carbon atoms, and more preferably 2 to 8 carbon atoms. The invention is particularly well suited to the copolymerization reactions involving the polymerization of one or more olefin monomers of ethylene, propylene, butene-1, pentene-1, 4-methyl-pentene-l, hexene-1, octene-1, decene-1, 3-methyl-pentene-l, 3,5,5-<br><br>
tnmethyl-hexene-1 and cyclic olefins or a combination thereof. Other monomers can include vinyl monomers, diolefins such as dienes, polyenes, norbornene, norbornadiene monomers. Preferably a copolymer of ethylene is produced, where the comonomer is at least one alpha-olefin having from 4 to 15 carbon atoms, preferably from 4 to 12 carbon atoms, more preferably from 4 to 8 carbon atoms and most preferably from 4 to 7 carbon atoms.

In a particularly preferred embodiment the process of the invention relates to the polymerization of ethylene and at least one comonomer having from 4 to 8 carbon atoms, preferably 4 to 7 carbon atoms. Particularly, the comonomers are butene-1, 4-methyl-pentene-1, hexene-1 and octene-1, the most preferred being hexene-1 and/or butene-1.<br>
Typically in a gas phase polymerization process a continuous cycle is employed where in one part of the cycle of a reactor system, a cycling gas stream, otherwise known as a recycle stream or fluidizing medium, is heated in the reactor by the heat of polymerization. This heat is removed from the recycle composition in another part of the cycle by a cooling system external to the reactor. Generally, in a gas fluidized bed process for producing polymers, a gaseous stream containing one or more monomers is continuously cycled through a fluidized bed in the presence of a catalyst under reactive conditions. The gaseous stream is withdrawn from the fluidized bed and recycled back into the reactor. Simultaneously, polymer product is withdrawn from the reactor and fresh monomer is added to replace the polymerized monomer. (See for example U.S. Patent Nos. 4,543,399, 4,588,790, 5,028,670, 5,317,036, 5,352,749, 5,405,922, 5,436,304, 5,453,471, 5,462,999, 5,616,661 and 5,668,228 all of which are fully incorporated herein by reference.)<br>
The reactor pressure in a gas phase process may vary from about 10 psig (69 kPa) to about 500 psig (3448 kPa), preferably in the range of from about 100 psig (690 kPa) to<br><br>
aoout 400 psig (2759 kPa), preferably in the range of from about 200 psig (1379 kPa) to about 400 psig (2759 kPa), more preferably in the range of from about 250 psig (1724 kPa) to about 350 psig (2414 kPa).<br>
The reactor temperature in the gas phase process may vary from about 30°C to about 120°C, preferably from about 60°C to about 115°C, more preferably in the range of from about 75°C to 110°C, and most preferably in the range of from about 85°C to about 110°C. Altering the polymerization temperature can also be used as a tool to alter the final polymer product properties.<br>
The productivity of the catalyst(s) or catalyst system(s) is influenced by the main monomer partial pressure. The preferred mole percent of the main monomer, ethylene or propylene, preferably ethylene, is from about 25 to 90 mole percent and the monomer partial pressure is in the range of from about 75 psia (517 kPa) to about 300 psia (2069 kPa), which are typical conditions in a gas phase polymerization process. In one embodiment the ethylene partial pressure is about 220 to 240 psi (1517-1653 kPa). In another embodiment the molar ratio of hexene to ethylene ins the reactor is 0.03:1 to 0.08:1.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the reactor utilized in the present invention and the process of the invention produce greater than 500 lbs of polymer per hour (227 Kg/hr) to about 200,000 lbs/hr (90,900 Kg/hr) or higher of polymer, preferably greater than 1000 lbs/hr (455 Kg/hr), more preferably greater than 10,000 lbs/hr (4540 Kg/hr), even more preferably greater than 25,000 lbs/hr (11,300 Kg/hr), still more preferably greater than 35,000 lbs/hr (15,900 Kg/hr), still even more preferably greater than 50,000 lbs/hr (22,700 Kg/hr) and most preferably greater than 65,000 lbs/hr (29,000 Kg/hr) to greater than 100,000 lbs/hr (45,500 Kg/hr).<br>
Other gas phase processes contemplated by the process of the invention include those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,627,242, 5,665,818 and 5,677,375, and European publications EP-A- 0 794 200, EP-A- 0 802 202 and EP-B- 634 421 all of which are herein fully incorporated by reference.<br>
A slurry polymerization process generally uses pressures in the range of from about 1 to about 50 atmospheres and even greater and temperatures in the range of 0°C to about 120°C. In a slurry polymerization, a suspension of solid, particulate polymer is formed in a liquid polymerization diluent medium to which ethylene and comonomers and often<br><br>
Aydrogen along with catalyst are added. The suspension including diluent is intermittently or continuously removed from the reactor where the volatile components are separated from the polymer and recycled, optionally after a distillation, to the reactor. The liquid diluent employed in the polymerization medium is typically an alkane having from 3 to 7 carbon atoms, preferably a branched alkane. The medium employed should be liquid under the conditions of polymerization and relatively inert. When a propane medium is used the process must be operated above the reaction diluent critical temperature and pressure. Preferably, a hexane or an isobutane medium is employed.<br>
In one embodiment, a preferred polymerization technique of the invention is referred to as a particle form polymerization, or a slurry process where the temperature is kept below the temperature at which the polymer goes into solution. Such technique is well known in the art, and described in for instance U.S. Patent No. 3,248,179 which is fully incorporated herein by reference. The preferred temperature in the particle form process is within the range of about 185°F (85°C) to about 230°F (110°C). Two preferred polymerization methods for the slurry process are those employing a loop reactor and those utilizing a plurality of stirred reactors in series, parallel, or combinations thereof. Non-limiting examples of slurry processes include continuous loop or stirred tank processes. Also, other examples of slurry processes are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,613,484, which is herein fully incorporated by reference.<br>
In another embodiment, the slurry process is carried out continuously in a loop reactor. The catalyst (s) and/or activator(s) as a solution, as a suspension, as an emulsion, or as a slurry in isobutane or as a dry free flowing powder is injected regularly to the reactor loop, which is itself filled with circulating slurry of growing polymer particles in a diluent of isobutane containing monomer and comonomer. Hydrogen, optionally, may be added as a molecular weight control. The reactor is maintained at pressure of about 525 psig to 625 psig (3620 kPa to 4309 kPa) and at a temperature in the range of about 140 °F to about 220 °F (about 60 °C to about 104 °C) depending on the desired polymer density. Reaction heat is removed through the loop wall since much of the reactor is in the form of a double-jacketed pipe. The slurry is allowed to exit the reactor at regular intervals or continuously to a heated low pressure flash vessel, rotary dryer and a nitrogen purge column in sequence for<br><br>
removal of the isobutane diluent and all unreacted monomer and comonomers. The<br>
Iresulting hydrocarbon free powder is then compounded for use in various applications.<br>
In another embodiment the reactor used in the slurry process of the invention is capable of and the process of the invention is producing greater than 2000 lbs of polymer per hour (907 Kg/hr), more preferably greater than 5000 lbs/hr (2268 Kg/hr), and most preferably greater than 10,000 lbs/hr (4540 Kg/hr). In another embodiment the slurry reactor used in the process of the invention is producing greater than 15,000 lbs of polymer per hour (6804 Kg/hr), preferably greater than 25,000 lbs/hr (11,340 Kg/hr) to about 100,000 lbs/hr (45,500 Kg/hr).<br>
In another embodiment in the slurry process of the invention the total reactor pressure is in the range of from 400 psig (2758 kPa) to 800 psig (5516 kPa), preferably 450 psig (3103 kPa) to about 700 psig (4827 kPa), more preferably 500 psig (3448 kPa) to about 650 psig (4482 kPa), most preferably from about 525 psig (3620 kPa) to 625 psig (4309 kPa).<br>
In yet another embodiment in the slurry process of the invention the concentration of ethylene in the reactor liquid medium is in the range of from about 1 to 10 weight percent, preferably from about 2 to about 7 weight percent, more preferably from about 2.5 to about 6 weight percent, most preferably from about 3 to about 6 weight percent.<br>
A preferred process of the invention is where the process, preferably a slurry or gas phase process is operated in the absence of or essentially free of any scavengers, such as triethylaluminum, trimethylaluminum, tri-isobutylaluminum and tri-n-hexylaluminum and diethyl aluminum chloride, dibutyl zinc and the like. This preferred process is described in PCT publication WO 96/08520 and U.S. Patent No. 5,712,352, which are herein fully incorporated by reference.<br>
In another preferred embodiment the one or all of the catalysts are combined with up to 10 weight % of a metal stearate, (preferably a aluminum stearate, more preferably aluminum distearate) based upon the weight of the catalyst system (or its components), any support and the stearate. In an alternate embodiment a solution of the metal stearate is fed into the reactor. In another embodiment the metal stearate is mixed with the catalyst and fed into the reactor separately. These agents may be mixed with the catalyst or may be fed into the reactor in a solution or a slurry with or without the catalyst system or its components.<br><br>
In another preferred embodiment the supported catalysts combined with the activators are tumbled with 1 weight % of aluminum distearate or 2 weight % of an antistat, such as a methoxylated amine, such as Witco's Kemamine AS-990 from ICI Specialties in Bloomington Delaware. In another embodiment, a supported catalyst system of component is combined with 2 to 3 weight % of a metal stearate, based upon the weight of the catalyst system (or its components), any support and the stearate.<br>
More information on using aluminum stearate type additives may be found in USSN 09/113,261 filed July 10, 1998, which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
In a preferred embodiment a slurry of the stearate in mineral oil is introduced into the reactor separately from the metal compounds and or the activators.<br>
Experience with solution catalyst has shown that a smooth MMAO flow rate is better for maintaining a low static level in the reactor. Also, quick changes in MMAO flow, either" up or down, are preferably avoided or else extreme static levels could be generated.<br>
Reduced static levels will result in reduced agglomeration and sheeting episodes.<br>
While solution or slurry is a referenced embodiment, the catalyst and/or the activator may be placed on, deposited on, contacted with, incorporated within, adsorbed, or absorbed in a support. Typically the support can be of any of the solid, porous supports, including microporous supports. Typical support materials include talc; inorganic oxides such as silica, magnesium chloride, alumina, silica-alumina; polymeric supports such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, cross-linked polystyrene; and the like. Preferably the support is used in finely divided form.   Prior to use the support is preferably partially or completely dehydrated. The dehydration may be done physically by calcining or by chemically converting all or part of the active hydroxyls. For more information on how to support catalysts please see US 4,808,561 which discloses how to support a metallocene catalyst system. The techniques used therein are generally applicable for this invention.<br>
In another embodiment NMR (or other) equipment is used to analyze the feed stream composition of the catalyst solution prior to injecting it into a polymerization reactor. The information is then used to control individual feed streams and thus the final polymer product.<br>
In another embodiment a selective poison is added to the polymerization which selectively deactivates one of the catalysts in a controlled manner and thereby controls the<br><br>
 split of polymer being produced. Preferred selective poisons include carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, various internal olefins and dienes, oxygen, Lewis bases such as ethers, esters, and various amines.<br>
In another embodiment if catalyst from one feeder is lost or interrupted during the independent (but mixed) addition of two or more catalyst to a polymerization, the other catalyst feeder(s) are stopped within about 30 minutes, preferably within about 5 minutes, most preferably within about 2 minutes or immediately. The reactor may be killed or mini-killed if residence effects are expected to drive the split off specification when the reactor is operating with no fresh catalyst feed and catalyst feed cannot be restored within a specific period of time dependent upon the performance of the catalysts.<br>
The present invention should be applicable to gas phase polymerization with solution feed or hybrid solution feed system.<br>

In a dry box, 22.45 mmol (6.34 g) 2-acetylpyridine(2,6-diisopropylphenylimine) were charged to a 250 mL round bottom flask equipped with a stir bar and septa. The flask was sealed, removed from the dry box and placed under nitrogen purge. Dry toluene (50 mL) was added and stirred to dissolve the ligand. The vessel was chilled to 0° C in a wet ice bath. Trimethyl aluminum (Aldrich, 2.0 M in toluene) was added dropwise over ten minutes. The temperature of the reaction was not allowed to exceed 10° C. When addition of the trimethyl aluminum was complete, the mixture was allowed to warm slowly to room<br>

Example 1:<br>
An ethylene hexene copolymer was produced in a 14-inch (35.6 cm) pilot plant scale gas phase reactor operating at 85° C and 350 psig (2.4 MPa) total reactor pressure having a water cooled heat exchanger. The reactor was equipped with a plenum having about 1,600 PPH of recycle gas flow. (The plenum is a device used to create a particle lean zone in a fluidized bed gas-phase reactor. See US Patent 5,693,727.) A tapered catalyst injection nozzle having a 0.041 inch (0.10 cm) hole size was position in the plenum gas flow. Prior to starting the catalyst feed, ethylene pressure was about 220 psia (1.5 MPa), 1-hexene concentration was about 0.6 mol % and hydrogen concentration was about 0.25 mol %. Nitrogen was fed to the reactor as a make-up gas at about 5-8 PPH. The catalyst solution was a 1:1 molar ratio of Catalyst 2: Catalyst 3 catalyst in a toluene solution. Catalyst feed was started at 13 cc's per hour, which was sufficient to give the desired production rate of 17 lbs/hr(kg/hr7.7). The catalyst and co-catalyst (MMAO-3A, 1 wt % Aluminum) were mixed in line prior to passing through the injection nozzle into the fluidized bed. MMAO to catalyst was controlled so that the Al:Zr molar ratio was 300:1. 5.0 lbs/hr (2.3 kg/hr) Nitrogen and 20 lbs/hr (9.1 kg/hr) 1-hexene were also fed to the injection nozzle. A bimodal polymer having nominal 0.43 dg/min (I21) and 0.942 g/cc properties was obtained. The resin average particle size was 0.023 inches (0.58 cm). A residual zirconium of 2.2 ppm was measured by x-ray fluorescence.<br><br>

Example 2C. Production of Resin containing three catalyst components<br>
An ethylene hexene copolymer was produced in a 14-inch (35.6 cm) pilot plant scale gas phase reactor operating at 85° C and 350 psig (2.4 MPa) total reactor pressure having a water cooled heat exchanger. Ethylene was fed to the reactor at a rate of about 38 pounds per hour (17.2 kg/hr), hexene was fed to the reactor at a rate of about 0.3 pounds per hour (0.14 kg/hr) and hydrogen was fed to the reactor at a rate of 8 mPPH. Nitrogen was fed to the reactor as a make-up gas at about 4-8 PPH. The production rate was about 30 PPH. The reactor was equipped with a plenum having about 1,600 PPH of recycle gas flow. (The plenum is a device used to create a particle lean zone in a fluidized bed gas-phase reactor.<br><br>
See US Patent 5,693,727.) A tapered catalyst injection nozzle having a 0.055 inch (0.14 cm) hole size was position in the plenum gas flow. Catalyst from Example B was contacted in-line with 1-hexene and 3.55 % Al (MMAO-3A) in hexane for approximately 30 minutes before joining a stream of the mixed catalyst from Example A. The catalyst ratio was kept at 2.2:1 (Example B : Example A). The MMAO-3A was controlled so that the overall Al:Zr molar ratio was 230:1. Nitrogen was also fed to the injection nozzle as needed to maintain a stable average particle size.<br>
A broad molecular weight distribution polymer having nominal 4.69 dg/min I21, 0.02 dg/min I2, 234I21/I2 ratio and 0.948 g/cc properties was obtained. A residual zirconium of 1.18 ppmw was calculated based on a reactor mass balance. The polymer was characterized by SEC (See Figure 1) and determined to be approximately 53 % high molecular weight polymer. The final polymer had an Mn of 12,222, an Mw of 372,661 and an Mw/Mn of 30.49.<br>
