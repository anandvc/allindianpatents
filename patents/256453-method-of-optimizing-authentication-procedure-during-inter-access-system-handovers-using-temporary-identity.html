DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Operation of Related Art - The radio access network (RAN), system architecture (SA) and the core terminal (CT) working groups of the third generation partnership project (3GPP) aim to develop an enhanced UTRAN (E-UTRAN) architecture for next generation wireless systems. The E-UTRAN system is required to co-exist with the current second (2G) and third generation (3G) wireless systems, and in particular, support handovers between the existing systems and the newly evolved E-UTRAN system, specified in the 3GPP TR 23.882 , 3GPP TS 23.401 ark3 3GPP TS 23.402..<br>
The E-UTRAN system is an evolution of the 3GPP UTRAN system, in which the main entities are the user equipment (UE), the enhanced Node B (ENB), Mobility Management Entity (MME), User Plane Entity (UPE) and Inter Access System Anchor (IASA) as shown in the Figure 1. The ENB of the EUTRAN system is expected to have the features of the Node B and the radio network controller (RNC) of the legacy UTRAN system. MME of the System Architecture Evolution (SAE) manages and stores UE context (for idle state: UE/user identities, UE mobility state, user security parameters). It generates temporary identities and allocates them to UEs. It checks the authorization whether the UE may camp on the TA or on the PLMN. It also authenticates the user. UPE of SAE terminates for idle state UEs the downlink data path and triggers/initiates paging when downlink data arrive for the UE. It manages and stores UE contexts, e.g. parameters of the IP bearer service or network internal routing information. It performs replication of the user traffic in case of interception. Inter AS Anchor is the user plane anchor for mobility between different access systems. It performs or supports handover between different access systems.<br>
The GERAN consists of the Base Transceiver Station (BTS) and the Base Station Controller (BSC). The UTRAN consists of the Node B and the Radio Network Controller (RNC). The GPRS Core Network consists of the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) and the Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) as shown in Figure 1.<br>
The integrated WLAN (l-WLAN) system specified in the 3GPP TS 23.234 specifications provides a system and method to integrate legacy UTRAN systems with WLAN systems, as shown in the Figure 2. The l-WI_AN system allows WLAN users to access 3GPP packet switched services.<br>
LIMITATION<br>
Currently there is no efficient mechanism specified to provide temporary identities of the target system to the UE through serving access network during handover preparation phase for seamless handover in the heterogeneous access systems, namely between SAE, WiMAX, l-WLAN and UMTS.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

It is another objection of the invention to generate the temp identities by the target system during the HO preparation phase; so that the UE can use these identities for fast re-authentication during handover or the target system can securely verify the UE identity during handover. It is another object of the invention to illustrate the above invention.<br>
The present invention is related to the scenario where a UE handover between heterogeneous access systems. The method of the invention comprises of a mechanism that provides the UE with protected temporary identities during handover preparation phase, so the UE can be securely identified by the target system during handover and also the temporary identities can be used for fast re- authentication procedures and skipping full authentication procedure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The present invention provides a system and method for providing optimized authentication procedure during handover between the heterogeneous networks. The invention is operated as detailed below-<br>
Authentication Optimization during backward handover in heterogeneous wireless access systems (Alternative 1)<br>
The generalized authentication optimization procedure during backward handover in heterogeneous wireless access systems (Alternative 1) is shown in figure 2. In this alternative, the UE initiates the backward handover procedure. The functionality of the interworking function (IWF) or interworking unit (IWU) is to convert the RAN and the CN containers/protocol/parameters of one access system to another. IWF interface with different network entities, with the entity specific interface protocol. The IWF can be co-located with any other network entity in tne serving networK or in ine target neiworK or alternatively can De a separate entity in the serving network or in the target network. The operation of the UE assisted backward handover is detailed below:<br>
1)	UE sends periodic or event based measurements to the serving access network.<br>
2)	If the serving access system finds that UE measurement is below the threshold or serving access system decides by any other mean that serving RAT cannot be continued, then the serving access system can request the UE to start scanning other RATs or alternatively by L2 or by some other means, the UE decides that the serving RAN cannot be continued and starts scanning the other RATs.<br>
3)	UE decided the target system based on the measurement report compared with the RAT specific handover criteria and ranking orders configured in the UE.<br>
4)	The UE initiates the backward handover procedure by sending handover request message to the target network through the serving network.<br>
5)	The serving network checks for the capabilities and authorizes the UE requested handover. The serving network includes the unused AVs, the security context of the UE, etc., along with the HO request message.<br>
6)	Then the serving network forwards the HO request to the interworking function (IWF).<br>
7)	The IWF converts the serving access network specific parameters to the target specific parameters and forwards the request to the target network.<br>
8)	The IWF lookup the target system parameters in the HO request message<br>
and forwards the HO request to the appropriate target access system entity.<br>
9)	The target system then prepares for the UE handover using the HO request parameters. The target network selects the first AV from the ordered AVs received in the HO request message and derives access system specific keys from the Keys (CK and IK or KaSme) of the selected AV or alternatively, the target system can use the latest keys (for example CK and IK) passed by the serving network to derive the keys. The target system generate the access system specific temporary identity or identities either for NAS or RAN or both for the UE, so that the UE can use these identities either for fast authentication procedure or the target system can securely verify the UE during handover or for both.<br>
10)	After successful HO preparation the target system sends HO response message to the IWF. The target system includes the target system related parameters like entity ID and/or IP address, selected security configuration along with the HO response. The target system also includes the generated temp identities. The temp identities are protected using the keys generated by the target system. If the target system derives key from the AVs, then RAND and AUTN of the selected AV are also included in the HO response.<br>
11)	The IWF then converts the parameters according to the serving system specific parameters and forwards the HO response to the serving network. Then the UE initiate L2 connectivity to the target system.<br>
12)	The	UE generates the target access system specific keys using parameters<br>
included in the HO response. The UE then decrypts the temp IDs issued by the target system.<br>
13) The UE optionally<br>
a.	Passes the temp ID in the L2 attachment request message, if the UE got RAN specific temp identity.<br>
b.	The target network verifies the temp identity of the UE. If they match, then the target system considers the UE as a genuine.<br>
c.	Then the target system sends the L2 attachment response.<br>
2. Or alternatively to the step 13,<br>
a.	The UE does the L2 attachment procedure<br>
b.	Then during the initial L3 or NAS message, the UE passes the temp identity, if the UE got NAS identity, along with the initial L3 or NAS request message.<br>
c.	The target network verifies the temp identity of the UE. If they match, then the target system considers the UE as a genuine.<br>
d.	Then the target system sends the initial L3 or NAS response message.<br>
Authentication Optimization during backward handover in heterogeneous wireless access systems (Alternative 2)<br>
The generalized authentication optimization procedure during backward handover in heterogeneous wireless access systems (Alternative 2) is shown in figure 3. In this alternative, the serving network initiates the backward handover procedure. The functionality of the interworking function (IWF) or interworking unit (IWU) is to convert the RAN and the CN containers/protocol/parameters of one access system to another. IWF interface with different network entities, with the entity specific interface protocol. The operation of the UE assisted backward handover is detailed below:<br>
1.	UE sends periodic or event based measurements to the serving access network.<br>
2.	If the serving access system finds that UE measurement is below the threshold or serving access system decides by any other mean that serving RAT cannot be continued, then the serving access system can request the UE to start scanning other RATs or alternatively by L2 or by some other means, the UE decides that the serving RAN cannot be continued and starts scanning the other RATs.<br>
3.	The send the measurement report of the other RAT to the serving access network.<br>
4.	The serving access network decided the target system based on the measurement report compared with the RAT specific handover criteria and ranking orders configured in the serving network.<br>
5.	The serving network checks for the capabilities and authorizes the UE requested handover. The serving network initiates the backward handover procedure by sending handover request message to the target network through the IWF. The serving network includes the unused AVs, the security context of the UE, etc., along with the HO request message.<br>
6.	The IWF converts the serving access network specific parameters to the target specific parameters and forwards the request to the target network.<br>
7.	The IWF lookup the target system parameters in the HO request message and forwards the HO request to the appropriate target access system entity.<br>
8.	The target system then prepares for the UE handover using the HO request parameters. The target network selects the first AV from the ordered AVs received in the HO request message and derives access system specific keys from the keys (CK and IK or alternatively KASME) of the selected AV or alternatively, the target system can use the latest keys (for example CK and IK) passed by the serving network to derive the keys. The target system generate the access system specific temporary identity or identities either for<br>
NAS or RAN or both for the UE, so that the UE can use these identities either for fast authentication procedure or the target system can securely verify the UE during handover or for both. If the target system derives key from the AVs, then RAND and AUTN of the selected AV are also included in the HO response.<br>
9.	After successful HO preparation the target system sends HO response message to the IWF. The target system includes the target system related parameters like entity ID and/or IP address, selected security configuration along with the HO response. The target system also includes the generated temp identities. The temp identities are protected using the keys generated by the target system.<br>
10.	The IWF then converts the parameters according to the serving system specific parameters and forwards the HO response to the serving network.<br>
11.	The serving network sends the HO command to the UE to perform the handover to the target access system. Then the UE initiate L2 connectivity to the target system.<br>

1. UE sends periodic or event based measurements to the EUTRAN<br>
network.<br>
2.	If ENB/MME finds that UE measurement is below the threshold or MME decides by any other mean that EUTRAN cannot be continued, then ENB/MME can request the UE to start scanning other RATs or alternatively by L2 or by some other means, the UE decides that the EUTRAN cannot be continued and starts scanning the other RATs.<br>
3.	UE sends the l-WLAN measurement report containing the l-WLAN ID and NAI with other parameters to the SAE system. Then the ENB/MME decides to handover the UE to the l-WLAN network.<br>
4.	Using NAI, the MME resolves the l-WLAN AAA server IP address and contacts the AAA server through the logical interworking unit. This logical interworking unit can be located within the MME or within the AAA server or alternatively co-located within any network entity in the SAE system or in the l-WLAN system. The functionality of the interworking unit is to convert the RAN and the CN containers/protocol/parameters of one access system to another.<br>

6.	AAA generates/derive the keys (MSK, TEK and EMSK) using NAI, CK and IK. The AAA server also generated the Temp IDs (pseudonym ID and the fast re-authentication ID). The AAA server protect (encrypt) the Temp IDs using derived TEK and then send it to the UE.<br>
7.	The AAA server sends the HO accept to the MME through the interworking unit. The HO accept message contains the protected temp IDs (pseudonym ID and fast re-authentication ID).<br>
8.	The MME forwards the received parameters in the HO accept message in the HO command message to the UE.<br>
9.	After receiving the HO command from the SAE system to handover to the l-WLAN network, the UE generated the keys (MSK, TEK and EMSK) using the latest or derived CK and IK and decrypts the protected Temp IDs (pseudonym ID and the fast re-authentication ID).<br>

3.	The UE or the WiMAX decides that the target system as LTE/SAE based on the LTE/SAE measurement report compared with the RAT specific handover criteria and ranking orders configured in the UE or in the WiMAX network.<br>
4.	The UE or the WiMAX initiates the backward handover procedure by sending handover request message to the LTE/SAE network through the WiMAX network.

The IWF obtains the IP address of the MME by resolving TAI or alternatively the IWF have the mapping of TAI to the MME.<br>
5.	The MME decides the target ENB and derives the LTE/SAE specific keys and prepares for the UE HO.<br>
6.	The MME passes the security context to the target ENB and setup the RAB for the UE. The ENB generates the RAN specific temp ID CRNTI and pass it to the MME. The MME encrypts the temp identity CRNTI.<br>
7.	After successful HO preparation the MME sends HO response message to the IWF. The MME includes the target system related parameters like ENB ID(s), selected security configuration parameters and the encrypted temp ID CRNTI along with the HO response.<br>
8.	The IWF then converts the parameters according to the serving system specific parameters and forwards the HO response to the UE through AAA, ASN GW and BS.<br>
9.	The BS or the ASN GW sends the HO command to the UE. The HO commend includes target system related parameters like ENB ID(s), selected security configuration parameters and the encrypted temp ID CRNTI.<br>
