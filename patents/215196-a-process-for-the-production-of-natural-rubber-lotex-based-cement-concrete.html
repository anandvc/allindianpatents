				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the production of Natural Rubber Latex based Cement Concrete.<br>
Latex Modified Cement Concretes (LMCCs) contain latex solution besides conventional ingredients such as ordinary Portland cement (OPC ), sand, and aggregates. They are used in civil engineering applications because of their superiority to conventional cement concretes in respect of durability characteristics, while matching them in mechanical and other strength properties.<br>
A patent search made using the key words - latex, modified, cement, and concrete, yielded no references on the process of producing cement based concrete using natural rubber latex (NRL), whereas several patents were listed related to use of synthetic rubber latex. The ingredients mentioned in the processes of the patents on synthetic latex based concrete, are different from the controlling ingredients utilized in the process of the present invention of natural rubber latex based cement concretes.<br>
The direct use of natural rubber latex (NRL) in cement concrete, without any modification is observed to cause formation of agglomerates of cement, thereby preventing good dispersion of cement particles in cement concrete. Moreover, the NRL gets coagulated in the presence of cement particles. Thus, cement concrete produced using the NRL without any modification suffers from the drawbacks of lack of cohesiveness and insufficient workability.<br><br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the production of natural rubber latex based cement concrete (LMCC), which successfully surmounts the problem of coagulation of latex usually associated with cement matrices which leads to insufficient workability of the concrete mix.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for production of natural rubber latex based cement concrete which comprises :<br>
a)	mixing natural rubber latex (NRL) solution and a non-ionic surfactant such as<br>
poly-oxy nonyl phenol ether, adding to the solution an anti-foaming agent<br>
such as silicone emulsion,<br>
b)	adding cement to water under constant stirring to obtain a cement slurry,<br>
adding to the cement slurry the resultant NRL solution prepared in step (a)<br>
under constant stirring to obtain a cement - NRL slurry,<br>
c)	mixing fine and/or coarse aggregates such as sand and/or crushed hard<br>
rocks and the cement - NRL slurry prepared in step (b) to obtain an uniform<br>
mix,<br>
d)	pouring the mix obtained in step ( c) into moulds and covering the said mould<br>
for a period of about 24 hours with a covering sheet being selected from a<br>
group consisting of polyethylene, rubber sheet and wet gunny cloth,<br>
e)	curing of mould as obtained in step (d) with moist water for a period about 5<br>
days,<br>
f)	further curing of moist water cured mould as obtained in step (e) with air<br>
curing for a period of about 21 days to obtain the natural rubber latex based<br>
cement concrete (NR-LMCC).<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the non ionic surfactant such as poly-oxynonyl phenol ether added to the NRL solution may be in the range of 2.5% to 3.5% of the polymeric solids of NRL solution.<br><br>
In an another embodiment of the present invention the anti-foaming agent such as silicone<br>
emulsion added to the NRL solution may be   in the range of 1.5 % to 2.5 % of the<br>
polymeric solids of NRL solution.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention   the cement used may be such as<br>
ordinary Portland cement, sulphate resisting cement, Portland Pozzolana cement.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the water used may be potable water .<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the fine aggregates used may be such as<br>
natural river sand with a fineness modulus in the range of 2.2 to 3.2   and   the coarse<br>
aggregates  used may be  crushed hard rock such as granite with the  maximum size of<br>
aggregate in the range of 10 mm to 12.5 mm.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the ingredients maybe mixed in the following proportions:<br>
1 part by weight of cement: 1 to 3 parts by weight of sand : 0 to 4 parts by weight of coarse aggregate : 0.05 to 0.20 parts by weight of polymeric solids of the NRL : 0.30 to 0.50 part by weight of water, for producing mortar / concrete.<br>
In still another embodiment the curing may be effected in the following manner :<br>
a)	covering the moulds for   a minimum of around 24 hours by a polyethylene/rubber<br>
sheet / wet gunny cloth and<br>
b)	moist / water curing for a minimum of around 5 days and<br>
c)	ambient air curing for a further preferred minimum period of around 21 days.<br><br>
The present invention has been achieved using the following scientific considerations:<br>
The coagulating tendency of Natural rubber latex in the presence of cement concrete is prevented / delayed by use of suitable surfactants so that the latex particles do no coalesce atleast till the completion of pouring and compaction of the cement concrete in the moulds<br>
The addition of surfactant to avoid coagulation causes entrainment of excess amount of air in the cement concrete which reduces the strength of concrete and hence, a suitable de-entraining or anti-foaming chemical is added to the latex.<br>
The curing of latex modified cement concrete essentially consists of :<br>
Moist curing period, so that the cement hydrates and develops sufficient strength. Air drying period, so that the moisture/water in the latex solution is removed / reduced such that the polymeric solid particles of latex coalesce to form a continuous polymeric film inside the cement concrete. The period for the above two modes of curing needed to be properly determined so that both the hydration of cement and coalescence of latex solids occur in the latex modified cement concrete.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the process of the present invention and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>

The mix so obtained is cohesive and does not have coagulation of latex, thereby demonstrating the novelty of the invention. After the curing period of 28 days [1 day in mould under covered conditions + 5 days in water + 21 days in air curing by storing in the ambient conditions ], the test results obtained are:<br>

The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
1.	The   Natural Rubber  Latex based Cement Concrete (NR-LMCC) described in the<br>
present invention have improved impermeability characteristics over conventional<br>
cement concretes with reference to intrusion of moisture, water, oxygen, carbon<br>
dioxide and chloride ions. Therefore, they could be expected to provide good<br>
protection   to   steel   reinforcement   against   corrosion,   particularly   in   severe<br>
environmental conditions such as coastal regions.<br>
2.	Though LMCCs based on synthetic latexes are available, those latexes are based on<br>
petroleum which is a non-renewable source. Hence, natural rubber latex based<br>
concretes, developed in the present invention, would be preferable as they utilize<br>
latexes derived from rubber plants. Thus LMCCs based on NRL are eco-friendly and<br>
sustainable development of these materials can be planned.<br>
3.	The modulus of elasticity of NR-LMCCs is of the same order as that of conventional<br>
concrete and their bond  with conventional cement concrete is also good. Therefore<br>
NR-LMCCs are compatible with conventional cement concrete and can be used for<br>
the repair of distressed concrete structures.<br><br>
4. The impact and abrasion resistance of NR-LMCCs are higher than that of conventional concretes. Hence, they can be used in applications such as overlay material for bridge decks, factory floors and airport pavements.<br><br><br><br>
We claim :<br>
1.       A process for production of natural rubber latex based cement concrete which comprises:<br>

poly-oxy nonyl phenol ether in a ratio of about 50:1 , adding to the solution<br>
an anti-foaming agent such as silicone emulsion,<br>
b)	adding cement to water under constant stirring to obtain a cement slurry,<br>
