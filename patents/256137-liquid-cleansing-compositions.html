EXAMPLES<br>
The invention is further demonstrated in the following examples. The examples are for purposes of illustration and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. In the Examples, as elsewhere in this application, values for n, m, etc. in formulas, molecular weights and degree of ethoxylation or propoxylation are averages. Temperatures are in degrees C unless otherwise indicated. The amounts of the components may be in weight percents based on the standard described; if no other standard is described then the total weight of the composition is to be inferred (active basis). Various names of chemical components include those listed in the CTFA International Cosmeti3c ingredient Dictionary (Cosmetics, Toiletry and Fragrance Association, Inc., 7th ed. 1997).<br>
General Method of Miking Compositions<br>
Using the types and amounts of ingredients listed in the examples, the products are prepared at ambient temperature (approximately 20 -25 degrees C) by adding the DMDM Hydantoin to the water in a vessel equipped with center turbine agitation. The acrylate copolymer is then added to the water phase and mixed. The sodium laureth sulfate is added to the mixture and men neutralized with sodium hydroxide to a pH<br>
range of 6.5 - 7.5 at 25°C. Cocamidopropyl betaine is then added and mixed. The other ingredients are added in order and mixed until uniform. The citric acid is added to adjust the pH to approximately 6.4 - 7.2. The sodium chloride is added to adjust the viscosity to approximately 4300 centipoise (cps), wherein the formulation viscositj is in the range of 2500 - 5500 cps as measured by a Brookfield DV EH- Viscometer using Spindle # 5 at 20 RPM at 25°C.<br>
(Table Remove)Rheology of cleansing liquids is key to a consumer's perception of consistency and dispensing. Consumers perform flow experiments when they use the product How a product flows in a bottle and is dispensed, how the product is pumped and dispensed and how the product is spread out in use to generate lamer are all examples of a shear force being applied.<br>
A series of rheological measurements including strain sweep and creep tests were conducted. All rheological measurements were conducted using a Paar Physica MCR300 Rheometer equipped with a TEK150 P-CF peltier plate, a 50 mm parallel plate (PP50) and a 1 millimeter gap at 23°C.<br>
Strain sweeps are used to define the linear viscoelastic (LVE) region and determine the magnitude of G' (elastic modulus) and G" (viscous modulus) of an intact substance and is expressed as tan (delta) which equals G" over G'. If tan (delta) is greater man 1.0, the substance is viscous dominant and if tan (delta) is smaller than 1.0, the substance is elastic dominant. Creep tests determine the relative contribution of the elastic and viscous elements.<br><br>
(Table Remove)he rheological measurements indicate that the Liquid Hand Soap with the Glucams has a higher elastic portion, a lower tan (delta) and a lower G". The greater the value of G" or tan (delta) the stringier the product, which is consistent with sensory evaluations and not as desirable.<br>
Scosorv Panel — Hand Waflh Dispensing Study<br>
For evaluating aesthetic properties, a composition of Example 1 was compared on the basis of aesthetics for foaming and dispensing from a liquid hand soap container to the composition of Example 2.<br>
Methodology;<br>
Products:<br>
•	Pearlized Liquid Hand Soap with Glucams (control) Example 1<br>
•	Pearlized Liquid Hand Soap without Glucams Example 2<br>
Procedure:<br>
Two products were tested in two phases: a sequential monadic hand wash phase and a<br>
side-by-side dispensing phase.<br>
PfflftJ- Hand Wash Evaluation: Each panelist washed with each product over 2 test sessions. Panelists dispensed the product using their normal habits, then washed their hands with the product (in water temperature about 37°C +/-1°C) and evaluated the product. Each panelist evaluated all products in a balanced/randomized order of<br>
presentation. Panelists answered a series of questions related to the dispensing and hand washing properties of the product.<br>
Part 2- Dispensinf Evaluation: Upon completing the hand wash portion of the study, panelists evaluated the dispensing properties of the 2 products (randomized presentation). Panelists pumped each product twice into a dish to evaluate the dispensing properties. Panelists were instructed to pump as they would normally pump, wait for the pump to recover (count to 10) and then pump the product again. This procedure was repeated with each product. Panelists answered a series of questions related to the dispensing properties in between each product.<br>
Subjects;<br>
79 liquid hand soap users participated in the study.<br>
Results of Comparison of Pearlized Liquid Hand Soap with glucams versus without<br>
Part I Hand wash .and dispensing (see Table 6)<br>
•	Pearlized Liquid Hand Soap without Glucams was rated as having less lather<br>
compared to the Pearlized Liquid Hand Soap with Glucams.<br>
Part II: Dispensing only (see Table 5)<br>
•	The Pearlized Liquid Hand Soap without Glucams was rated as being more stringy<br>
as it was dispensed compared to the Pearlized Liquid Hand Soap with Glucams.<br>
Table 6: Rate the Amount of Lather generated while washing<br><br>
(Table Remove)oam Evaluation Testing - Cylinder Shake The foam characteristics of liquid hand soap products were evaluated using a mechanical cylinder shake method. The procedure uses hard water, synthetic sebum and a Gaum Foam Machine available from Gaum, Inc., Robbinsville, New Jersey.<br>
Hard Water Preparation: In a 2000 milliliter volumetric flask combine 40 grams of magnesium chloride 0 and 45 grams of calcium chloride and fill volumetric to line with deionized water. This will produce 25,000 ppm water hardness. To prepare 250 ppm hard water, put 20 milliliters of 25,000 ppm hard water solution into a 2000 milliliter volumetric flask and fill to the line with deionized water.<br>
Synthetic Sebum Preparation:<br>
The Synthetic Sebum was prepared by melting together the following ingredients at about 71°C while stirring with a spatula.<br>
Palmitic Acid Stearic Acid Coconut Oil Paraffin Spermaceti Olive Oil Squalene Cholesterol Oleic Acid10.0<br>
5.0 15.0 10.0 15.0 20.0<br>
5.00 5.00 10.0<br>
Foam height testing was performed on the compositions in Examples 1 and 2 above. I5 grams of liquid hand soap were added to 84 grams of 250 ppm hard water and 1 gram of Synthetic Sebum. The hard water was prepared by mixing together 40 grams of MgCl- 6H O with 45 grams of CaCl 2-2H2O and diluting to 250 ppm. The test mixture was then heated with moderate agitation and slow heating to 40.5°C. This dispersion was then carefully poured into a 600 ml. graduated cylinder containing a plastic water-filled tube. The cylinder was then mounted onto the center of a Vertical Rotator Assembly and rotated at a constant speed of 30 rpm. The action of the circular mixing of the cylinder and the free falling action of the water-filled tube in the cylinder generated foam which could be measured as foam height using the gradations on the side of the cylinder. After 8 complete revolutions, the Flash Foam Height was measured and after an additional 12 complete revolutions (a total of 20 revolutions) the Maximum Foam Height was measured. At this time the Drainage Time was also measured. Drainage Time is defined as the time measured from the completion of the 20 revolutions to the time at which 100 mis. of apparent liquid has drained. Drainage Time is a measure of the wetness and stability of the foam.<br>
The results of foam evaluation testing indicate that the Pearlized liquid hand soap with Glucams had more flash foam and maximum foam height. The drainage time took less time and represents a more stable foam.<br>
All numerical ranges described herein include all combinations and subcombinations of ranges and specific integers encompassed therein.<br>
Various modifications of the invention, in addition to those described herein, will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing description. Such modifications are also intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims.-<br><br><br><br>
