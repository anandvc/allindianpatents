INHIBITORS OF lAP<br>
The present invention relates generally to novel compounds that inhibit the binding of the Smac protein to Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins (IAPs). The present invention includes novel compounds, novel compositions, methods of their use and methods of their manufacture, where such compounds are generally pharmacologically useful as agents in therapies whose mechanism of action rely on the inhibition of the Smac/IAP interaction, and more particularly useful in therapies for the treatment of proliferative diseases, including cancer.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Programmed cell death plays a critical role in regulating cell number and in eliminating stressed or damaged cells from normal tissues. Indeed, the network of apoptotic signaling mechanisms inherent in most cell types provides a major barrier to the development and progression of human cancer. Since most commonly used radiation and chemo-therapies rely on activation of apoptotic pathways to kill cancer cells, tumor cells which are capable of evading programmed cell death often become resistant to treatment.<br>
Apoptosis signaling networks are classified as either intrinsic when mediated by death receptor-Iigand interactions or extrinsic when mediated by cellular stress and mitochondrial permeabilization. Both pathways ultimately converge on individual Caspases. Once activated, Caspases cleave a number of cell death-related substrates, effecting destruction of the cell.<br>
Tumor cells have devised a number of strategies to circumvent apoptosis. One recently reported molecular mechanism involves the overexpression of members of the IAP (Inhibitor of Apoptosis) protein family. IAPs sabotage apoptosis by directly interacting with and neutralizing Caspases. The prototype IAPs, XIAP and clAP have three functional domains referred to as BIR 1, 2 &amp; 3 domains. BIR3<br><br>
domain interacts directly with Caspase 9 and inhibits its ability to bind and cleave its natural substrate, Procaspase 3.<br>
It has been reported that a proapoptotic rnitochondrial protein, Smac (also known as DIABLO), is capable of neutralizing XIAP and/or clAP by binding to a peptide binding pocket (Smac binding site) on the surface of BIR3 thereby precluding interaction between XIAP and/or clAP and Caspase 9. The present invention relates to therapeutic molecules that bind to the Smac binding pocket thereby promoting apoptosis in rapidly dividing cells. Such therapeutic molecules are useful for the treatment of proliferative diseases, including cancer. In other words, Smac analogs would bind to BIR3 domain of lAPs and will remove the lAP's inhibition of activated Caspase 9 which would then go on to induce apoptosis.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to novel compounds that inhibit the binding of the Smac protein to Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins (lAPs). The present invention includes novel compounds, novel compositions, methods of their use and methods of their manufacture, where such compounds are generally pharmacologically useful as agents in therapies whose mechanism of action rely on the inhibition of the Smac/lAP interaction, and more particularly useful in therapies for the treatment of proliferative diseases, including cancer.<br>

"Hef refers to heteroaryl and heterocyclic rings and fused rings containing aromatic and non-aromatic heterocyclic rings. "Het is a 5-7 membered heterocyclic ring containing 1- 4 heteroatoms selected from N, O and S, or an 8-12 membered fused ring system including at least one 5-7 membered heterocyclic ring containing 1, 2 or 3 heteroatoms selected from N, O, and S. Suitable het substituents include unsubstituted and substituted pyrrolidyl, tetrahydrofuryl, tetrahydrothiofuranyl, piperidyl, piperazyl, tetrahydropyranyl, morphilino, 1,3-diazapane, 1,4-diazapane, 1,4-oxazepane, 1,4-oxathiapane, furyl, thienyl, pyrrole, pyrazole, triazole, 1,2,3-triazole, tetrazolyl, oxadiazole, thiophene, imidazol, pyrrolidine, pyrrolidone, thiazole, oxazole, pyridine, pyrimidine, isoxazolyl, pyrazine, quinoline, isoquinoline, pyridopyrazine, pyrrolopyridine, furopyridine, indole, benzofuran, benzothiofuran, benzindole, benzoxazole, pyrroloquinoline, and the like. The het substituents are unsubstituted or substituted on a carbon atom by halogen, especially fluorine or chlorine, hydroxy, C1-C4 alkyl, such as methyl and ethyl, C1-C4 alkoxy, especially methoxy and ethoxy, nitro, -O-C(O)-C1-C4aIkyl or-C(O)-O-C1-C4alkyl or on a nitrogen by C1-C4 alkyl, especially methyl or ethyl, -O-C(O)-C1-C4alkyl or-C(O)-O-C1-C4alkyl, such as carbomethoxy or carboethoxy.<br>
When two substituents together with a commonly bound nitrogen are het, it is understood that the resulting heterocyclic ring is a nitrogen-containing ring, such as aziridine, azetidine, azoie, piperidine, piperazine, morphiline, pyrrole, pyrazole, thiazole, oxazole, pyridine, pyrimidine, isoxazolyl, and the like.<br>
Halogen is fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, especially fluorine and chlorine.<br><br>
Unless otherwise specified "alkyl" includes straight or branched chain alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl and branched pentyl, n-hexyl and branched hexyl, and the like.<br>
A "cycioalky!" group means C3 to C10 cycloalkyl having 3 to 8 ring carbon atoms and may be, for example, cyclopropyl, cyciobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl or cyclooctyl. Preferably, cycloalkyl is cycloheptyl. The cycloalkyl group may be unsubstituted or substituted with any of the substituents defined below, preferably  ■ halo, hydroxy or C1-C4 alkyl such as methyl.<br>
The amino acid residues include a residue of a standard amino acid, such as alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamine, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, iso!eucineT leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proiine, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine and vaiine. The amino acid residues also include the side chains of uncommon and modified amino acids. Uncommon and modified amino acids are known to those of skill in the art (see for example G. B. Fields, Z. Tiam and G Barany; Synthetic Peptides A Users Guide, University of Wisconsin Biochemistry Center, Chapter 3, (1992)) and include amino acids such as 4-hydroxyproIine, 5-hydroxylysine, desmosineT beta-alanine, alpha, gamma- and beta-aminobutric acid, homocysteine, homoserine, citrulline, ornithine, 2- or 3-amino adipic acid, 6-aminocaproic acid, 2- or 3- aminoisobutric acid, 2,3-diaminopropionic Ik<br>
acid, diphenylalanine, hydroxyproline and the like. If the side chain of the amino acid residue contains a derivatizable group, such as COOH, -OH or amino, the side chain may be derivatized by a substituent that reacts with the derivatizable group. For example, acidic amino acids, like aspartic and glutamic acid, or hydroxy substituted side chains, like those of serine or threonine, may be derivatized to form an ester, or amino side chains may form amide or alkylamino derivatives. In particular, the derivative may be a substituent that facilitates transport aC1-oss a cell membrane. In addition, any carboxylic acid group in the amino acid residue, for example, an alpha carboxylic acid group, may be derivatized as discussed above to form an ester or amide.<br><br>
Substrtuents that facilitate transport of the molecule aC1-oss a cell membrane are known to those of skill in the medicinal chemistry arts (see, for example, Gangewar S., Pautetti G. M.,Wang B., Siahaan T. J., Stella V. J., Borchardt R. T.f Drug Discovery Today, vol. 2. p148-155 (1997) and Bundgaard H. and Moss J., Pharmaceutical Research, vol. 7. p 885 (1990)). Generally, such substituents are lipophillic substituents. Such lipophillic substituents include a C6-C30 alkyl which is saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, including methylene-interrupted polyene, phenyl, phenyl which substituted by one or two C1-C8 alkyl groups, C5-C9 cycloalkyl, C5-C9 cycloalkyl which is substituted by one or two C1-C8 alkyl groups, -Xt-phenyl, -X-rphenyl which is substituted in the phenyl ring by one or two C1-C8 alkyl groups, X1-C5-C9 cycloalkyl or X1-C5-C9 cycloalkyl which is substituted by one or two C1-C8 alkyl groups; where X-i is C1-C24 alkyl which is saturated, monounsaturated or pofyunsaturated and straight or branched chain.<br>
Unsubstituted is intended to mean that hydrogen is the only substituent.<br>
Any of the above defined aryl, het, alkyl, cycloalkyl, or heterocyclic groups may be unsubstituted or independently substituted by up to four, preferably one, two or three substituents, selected from the group consisting of: halo (such as Cl or Br); hydroxy; lower alkyl (such as C1-C3 lower alkyl); lower alkyl which may be substituted with any of the substituents defined herein; lower alkenyl; lower alkynyl; lower alkanoyl; alkoxy (such as methoxy); aryl (such as phenyl or benzyl); substituted aryl (such as fluoro phenyl or methoxy phenyl); amino; mono- or disubstituted amino; amino lower alkyl (such as dimethylamino); acetyl amino; amino lower alkoxy (such as ethoxyamine); nitro; cyano; cyano lower alkyl; carboxy; esterified carboxy (such as lower alkoxy carbonyl e.g. methoxy carbonyl); n-propoxy carbonyl or iso-propoxy carbonyl; alkanoyl; benzoyl; carbamoyl; N-mono- or N,N-disubstituted carbamoyl; carbamates; alkyl carbamic acid esters; amidino; guanidine; urea; ureido; mercapto; sulfo; lower alkylthio; sulfoamino; sulfohamide; benzosulfonamide; sulfonate; sulfanyl lower alkyl (such as methyl sulfanyl); sulfoamino; substituted or<br><br>

Preferably the above mentioned alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or het groups may be substituted by halogen, carbonyl, thiol, S(O), S(O2), -OH, -SH, -OCH3, -SCH3, -CN, -SCN or nitro.<br>
Where the plural form is used for compounds, salts, pharmaceutical preparations, diseases and the like, this is intended to mean also a single compound, salt, or the like.<br>
It will be apparent to one of skill in the art when a compound of the invention can exist as a salt form, especially as an acid addition salt or a base addition salt. When a compound can exist in a salt form, such salt forms are included within the scope of the invention. Although any salt form may be useful in chemical manipulations, such as purification procedures, only pharmaceutically acceptable salts are useful for pharmaceutically products.<br><br>
Pharrnaceutically acceptable salts include, when appropriate, pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts and acid addition salts, for example, metal salts, such as alkali and alkaline earth metal salts, ammonium salts, organic amine addition salts, and amino acid addition salts, and sulfonate salts. Acid addition salts include inorganic acid addition salts such as hydrochloride, sulfate and phosphate, and organic acid addition salts such as alkyl sulfonate, arylsulfonate, acetate, maleate, fumarate, tartrate, citrate and lactate. Examples of metal salts are alkali metal salts, such as lithium salt, sodium salt and potassium salt, alkaline earth metal salts such as magnesium salt and calcium salt, aluminum salt, and zinc salt. Examples of ammonium salts are ammonium salt and tetramethylammonium salt. Examples of organic amine addition salts are salts with morpholine and piperidine. Examples of amino acid addition salts are salts with glycine, phenylalanine, glutamic acid and lysine. Sulfonate salts include mesylate, tosylate and benzene sulfonic acid salts.<br>
In view of the close relationship between the compounds in free form and those in the form of their salts, including those salts that can be used as intermediates, for example in the purification or identification of the compounds, tautomers or tautomeric mixtures and their salts, any reference to the compounds hereinbefore and hereinafter especially the compounds of the formula I, is to be understood as referring also to the corresponding tautomers of these compounds, especially of compounds of the formula I, tautomeric mixtures of these compounds, especially of compounds of the formula 1, or salts of any of these, as appropriate and expedient and if not mentioned otherwise.<br>
Any asymmetric carbon atom may be present in the (R)-, (S)- or (R,S)-configuration, preferably in the (R)- or (S)-configuration. Substituents at a ring at atoms with saturated bonds may, if possible, be present in cis- (= Z-) or trans (= E-) form.

In order to measure the ability of the inventive compounds to bind the BIR3 peptide binding pocket an ELISA and a cell based assays are utilized.<br>
Elisa<br><br>
Compounds are incubated with GST-B1R3 fusion protein and biotinylated SMAC peptide (AVPFAQK) in stretavidin-coated 96 well plates. For XIAP B1R3 Smac Elisa, a GST-BIR3 fusion containing amino acids 248-358 from XIAP is used. For CIAP1 BIR3 Smac Elisa, a GST-B1R3 fusion containing amino acids 259-364 from CIAP1 is used. Following a 30 minute incubation, wells are extensively washed. The remaining GST-BIR3 fusion protein is monitored by ELISA assay involving first, incubation with goat anti-GST antibodies followed by washing and incubation with alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-goat antibodies. Signal is amplified using Attophos (Promega) and read with Cytoflour Ex 450nm/40 and Em 580nm.   IC50s correspond to concentration of compound which displaces half of GST-BIR3 signal. The ICsofor non-biotinylated Smac is 400 nM. The IC5o values of compounds listed in Table 1 in the desC1-ibed ELISA assays ranged from 0.005 - 10<br>
Cell Proliferation Assay<br>
The ability of compounds to inhibit tumor cell growth in vitro is monitored using the CellTiter 96® AGueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega). This assay is composed of solutions of a novel tetrazolium compound [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt; MTS] and an electron coupling reagent (phenazine methosulfate) PMS. MTS is bioreduced by cells into a formazan product, the absorbance of which is measured at 490nm. The conversion of MTS into the aqueous soluble formazan product is accomplished by dehydrogenase enzymes found in metabolically active cells. The quantity of formazan product as measured by the amount of 490nm absorbance is directly proportional to the number of living cells in culture. The IC50 values of compounds listed in Table 1 in the desC1-ibed cell assays ranged from 0.005-50<br><br>
