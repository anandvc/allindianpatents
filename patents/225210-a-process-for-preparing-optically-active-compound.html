				<td>PROCESS FOR PREPARING OPTICALLY ACTIVE SULFOXIDE DERIVATIVE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an industrially<br>
advantageous process for preparing an optically active<br>
sulfoxide derivative having CCR5 antagonism, or a salt<br>
thereof.<br>
Background Art<br>
Prior Art<br>
Conventionally, as a process for preparing an<br>
optically active sulfoxide derivative, separation by a<br>
chiral column is generally employed, except for special<br>
cases. However, such a process is not a fully satisfactory<br>
one from an industrial point of view, because it requires a<br>
special apparatus such as SMB (Simulated moving bed).<br>
