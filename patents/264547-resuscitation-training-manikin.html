				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a manikin for practising resuscitation, primarily chest<br>
compressions and lung ventilation, comprising an inflatable body.<br>
The present applicant, Laerdal Medical AS, has produced and marketed recuscitation<br>
manikins since the 1960's under the trademark Resusci Anne®. The first manikin of this<br>
type had an inflatable body that was connected to a generally rigid head. To facilitate chest<br>
compression a steel ring circumscribed the chest of the inflatable body. The trainee pressed<br>
with his hands against the top of this steel ring, which deformed like a blade spring under<br>
the pressure. The only function of the inflatable body was to give the manikin an<br>
appearance of a human being. The inflatable body had no function in the resuscitation.<br>
The Resusci Anne® manikin and its sister products have developed substantially since this<br>
first model. However, an inflatable body has not been used since. Instead various<br>
embodiments of a rigid body has been used, that contain features adapted for chest<br>
compression, lung inflation and, by the time, several advanced functions. Examples of these<br>
manikins are show in WO 98/30994 and US 5468151.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a low cost resuscitation manikin that can be<br>
packed into a small size for transport and storage.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a resuscitation manikin that gives a<br>
high degree of functional correctness during chest compression and lung inflation.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a resuscitation manikin that contains<br>
few parts and is easy to assemble and use.<br>
One or more of the above objects is achieved by the present invention wherein the inflatable<br>
body is adapted to absorb compression force exerted during simulated chest compression.<br>
2<br><br>
By having an inflatable body that is adapted to absorb compression force, a low cost<br>
mdnikin that can be compacted into a small size is achieved. Preferably the manikin can be<br>
packed in a flat box that can be sent by letter mail.<br>
Since the manikin contains few parts that are easy to produce and assemble, it is possible to<br>
achieve a low sales price and mass production.<br>
Due to its small size, low price and ease of use this manikin can offer quality and affordable<br>
basic life support training to a broader public, also in developing countries, which cannot<br>
afford to by the manikins currently on the market. It also makes it possible for schools,<br>
scout groups and other organisations running life saving courses, to hand out personal<br>
manikins to pupils.<br>
Preferably, the inflatable body of the manikin comprises a chest portion and a head portion,<br>
the inflation chambers of the two portions being in communication with each other, the head<br>
portion acting as an expansion chamber during chest compression. Thereby a realistic chest<br>
compression scenario is achieved in which the chest will yield to force.<br>
Preferably, the inflatable body has a central portion defining a cavity, the cavity being<br>
circumscribed by a generally ring-shaped inflatable portion. Thereby the body will lie stable<br>
on a surface with a minimum of wobbling.<br>
Preferably, the manikin comprises a chest plate, the chest plate acting as a pressure<br>
distributor on the inflatable body, the chest plate being connected to the inflatable body by<br>
elastic means. Thereby an even more realistic scenario during chest compression is<br>
achieved.<br>
Preferably, the manikin comprises a lung part, the lung part being connected to a face mask,<br>
the lung being adapted for inflation through the mouth and/or the nose of the face mask, the<br>
lung having a chest portion positioned substantially parallel to the chest portion of the<br>
inflatable body, the face mask being positioned at the head portion of the inflatable body.<br>
Thereby a capacity for lung ventilation training is achieved.<br>
3<br><br>
Preferably, the cavity of the central portion receiving a portion of the lung during a first<br>
phase of lung inflation. Thereby is a realistic first phase of lung inflation achieved, during<br>
which minimal or no chest heaving occurs.<br>
Preferably, the side of the cavity facing the lung has an elastic means for forcing the portion<br>
of the lung expanded into the cavity substantially out of the cavity. Thereby a substantially<br>
complete emptying of the lung is achieved between each lung inflation.<br>
Preferably the face mask has a chin portion comprising an edge, the edge pinching a portion<br>
of the lung against the inflatable body in a first state, in which first state the head portion is<br>
lying substantially in the same plane as the chest portion of the inflatable body, and the edge<br>
being lifted away from the lung portion when the head portion is tilted relative to the chest<br>
portion, so that the chin portion is lifted simultaneously. Thereby a realistic requirement to<br>
tilt the head of the manikin backwards and lift of the chin is achieved.<br>
Preferably, a chest compression feedback device is integrated in the chest plate, the<br>
feedback device emitting a audible or visible signal when a predetermined compression<br>
force or depth is exceeded, optionally also having a means for indication sufficient lung<br>
inflation. This will provide for enhanced training possibilities as the trainee gets feedback<br>
on the quality of the chest compression and lung inflation.<br>
Preferably, the manikin is adapted to be deflated and folded into a small height together<br>
with a chest plate, lung part and face mask, to facilitate storage and transport.<br>
When in the following and the previous terms indication directions, like underside, rear<br>
side, below, above and the like, are used, these terms refer to the manikin in its position for<br>
used, i.e. chest compression and lung inflation. They are not to be construed to have any<br>
limiting intention on the protective scope of the invention.<br>
The present invention will be described in full detail with reference to a preferred<br>
embodiment shown in the enclosed drawings, in which:<br>
4<br><br>
Figure 15 shows a portion of the manikin of figure 10, showing the neck portion in detail.<br>
The manikin of the present invention has in a first embodiment four main parts, as shown in<br>
figure 1; an inflatable body 1, a lung 2, a face face mask 3 and a chest plate 4.<br>
The inflatable body has a chest portion 5, a neck portion 6 and a head portion 7. These<br>
portions have a common air chamber 8, which can be filled with or emptied of air or gas<br>
through a self-sealing valve 9. The valve 9 may be self sealing. The valve 9 is suitably a<br>
standard valve, inter alia used for bathing toys, air mattresses and the like. To fill the body<br>
the user may use his mouth to blow through the valve or a pump, e.g., a pump suitable for<br>
inflating bathing mattresses.<br>
The air chamber 8 is in chest portion 5 of the body 1 generally ring shaped leaving a central<br>
portion 10 that has no capacity for accommodating air and is circumscribed by the chamber<br>
8, thus forming a cavity in the central part 10. In the central portion a thin sheet may be<br>
present that has one or more holes 11 therethrough. The effect of this chest construction is<br>
that the body will lie with a large contact area against a surface, thus being stable and<br>
without the tendency to wobble. If the chamber 8 extended over the whole of the chest<br>
portion 5, this would result in a more or less spherical chest portion that would have contact<br>
with the underlying surface only at the central part.<br>
The ring-shape of the chest portion 5 adapt chest pressure exercised on the chest plate 4 of<br>
the same magnitude as recommended for chest compression in an average adult person and<br>
provides resistance and deflection of the same magnitude as in the average adult person.<br>
The inflatable body has ears 12 for fastening the face face mask 3, and optionally also ears<br>
(not shown for fastening the chest plate 4.<br>
The lung 2 consists of two plastic foils welded together at the edges. The lung 2 has a chest<br>
portion 13 that has approximately the same shape as and a slightly smaller size than the<br>
chest portion 5 of the body 1, and a neck portion 14 that is a little narrower than the neck<br>
6<br><br>
portion 6 of the body 1. The lung is attached to the face mask 3 at the end of the neck<br>
portion 14, as will be explained in the following.<br>
The face mask is shaped with an appearance of a human face, with inter alia a nose 15, a<br>
mouth 16 chin, forehead and jaw 27. The nose and the mouth have holes 17,18 extending<br>
through the mask. The face mask 3 is made of a relatively soft plastic material that will<br>
yield to finger pressure, but nevertheless is capable to maintain its shape.<br>
The chest plate 4 is made of a relatively stiff plastic material. It has the generally same<br>
shape and size as the chest portion 5 of the body 1. At one edge of the chest plate 4, facing<br>
the face mask 3, the chest plate has a notch 19 that resembles the upper sternal notch of a<br>
human being and at the opposite edge has a protruding feature 20 resembling the Xiphoid<br>
process of a human being. These features 19,20 will assist the trainee in recognising<br>
reference points on the human body. The lower end of the lung may also be fasten to the<br>
chest plate by hooking an ear (not shown) formed on the lung onto the xyphoid process of<br>
the sternum. The chest plate 4 also has nipples 21 painted or otherwise formed on its upper<br>
surface. The upper surface of the chest plate may be covered by a soft material with a high<br>
friction coefficient, e.g. by moulding the soft material onto a part of or the whole upper<br>
surface of the chest plate 4. The soft material will prevent slipping and fatigue on the hands<br>
of the trainee.<br>
An elastic cord 22 is fastened to the chest plate 4. This cord 22 is used to hold the chest<br>
plate 4 against the inflatable body 1. It also has an additional purpose that will be explained<br>
in the following.<br>
Figure 2 shows the manikin assembled and with the body 1 in fully inflated state. As shown<br>
the elastic cord 22 extends around the chest portion 5 of the body 1 and holds the chest plate<br>
5 in position against the body 1. The mask is fastened to the body 1 by threading plastic<br>
pins 23 extending from the side of the mask through holes in the ears 12 on the side of the<br>
head portion 7. The elastic cord 22 may also be the threaded through holes on a similar type<br>
of ears on the side of the chest portion 5.<br>
7<br><br>

components,<br>

Figure 9 shows a longitudinal section through an alternative embodiment of the manikin of<br>
the present invention,<br>
Figure 10 shows an alternative and preferred embodiment of the present invention in<br>
assembled an inflated state,<br>
Figure 11 shows the underside of the manikin according to the embodiment of figure 10,<br>
Figure 12 shows a lung for use in the embodiment of figure 10,<br>
Figure 13 shows the underside of a face mask for use in the embodiment of figure 10,<br>
Figure 14 shows a lung and face mask combination for use in the embodiment of figure 10,<br>
and<br>
5<br><br>
In figure 3 the underside of the manikin is shown. As is evident from this view the inflatable<br>
bddy 1 is symmetrical relative to a horizontal plane and also to a vertikal longitudinal plane<br>
(except for the valve of course). The elastic cord 22 is tensioned enough to form a small<br>
depression in the inflatable body 1, thereby forming a groove 24 extending form the central<br>
portion 10 to the side of the body 1. The purpose of this groove 24 is to conduct air trapped<br>
in the central portion to the outside during compression and let air into the central portion<br>
area to prevent the body from suctioning to the surface on which it is lying.<br>
In figure 4 the body 1 has been deflated and the body 1 is folded over at the intersection<br>
between the chest portion 5 and the neck portion 6 so that the face mask 3 is situated at one<br>
side of the manikin and the chest plate 4 at the opposite side. The side edges of the chest<br>
portion 5 of the body 1 is folded inwardly to a small extent, hi this state the manikin may<br>
for example take up a smaller area than an A4 paper sheet and build less than 4 cm in<br>
height.<br>
Figure 5a - d shows the rear side or inside of the face mask 3. The holes 17,18 through the<br>
nose and the mouth are visible in figures 5a - c. These holes 17,18 extend into a common<br>
cavity 34 at the rear side of the face mask 3. Around this cavity 34 is formed an upwardly<br>
extending flange 25. The opening at the end of the neck portion 14 of the lung is fixed to<br>
this flange 25. This can be done by welding, gluing, snap fit or by any other suitable means.<br>
The fixation may be permanent or non-permanent to allow for a changing of the lung. The<br>
flange 25 may be substantially circular as shown in figure 5a or oblong as shown in figures<br>
5b and c. To stiffen the mask ribs 54 may be formed on the rear side. This will facilitate the<br>
training in use of a barrier ventilation device on top of the manikin's face mask, since the<br>
mask will resist deformation due to the pressure from the mask.<br>
In figure 5c is shown a chin support plate 52 to support the chin portion of the face mask. In<br>
figure 5d is shown a support and coupling plate 53 that functions as a support for the chin<br>
portion and the moth and nose region as well as a coupling piece for a detachable lung 2.<br>
The coupling piece is designed to form a connection between the lung and the mask,<br>
providing for a changeable lung. With a changeable lung it is possible to make the lung<br>
disposable so that it may be disposed of after use. The mask is preferably designed to be<br>
8<br><br>
easy to clean. The support plate and lung coupling piece 52 may be coupled to the flange 25<br>
on'the inside of the face mask 3, trapping the edge of the opening 50 of the lung between<br>
the coupling piece 52 and the flange 25.<br>
Figure 6 shows a longitudinal section though the manikin in a non-influenced state. As is<br>
evident from this view the mask has an edge 26 at the jaw 27 that rests against the neck<br>
portion 14 of the lung 2, pinching the neck portion 14 of the lung between the edge 26 and<br>
the neck portion 6 of the inflated body 1, thus closing the communication between the<br>
opening 28 of the lung 2 and the chest portion 13 of the lung 2. The weight of the mask<br>
creates a sufficient pressure to prevent the trainee from blowing air into the lung 2, unless<br>
the chin portion is lifted.<br>
To be able to blow air into the lung 2, the trainee must tilt the head portion 7 of the body<br>
backwards (see figure 7), just like he is required to do with an unconscious human being.<br>
This backward tilting of the head portion 6 lifts the edge 26 of the jaw 27 off from the neck<br>
portion 14 of the lung 2 and opens the communication down into the chest portion 13 of the<br>
lung 2. Inspiration can be performed as exhaled air resuscitation performed mouth-to-mouth<br>
or mouth-to-nose. A realistic inspiration volume is required to fill the lung sufficiently to<br>
visibly raise the chest. The inflation of the lung 2 will in a first phase have the result that the<br>
lung protrudes down and into the cavity in the central portion 10 of the chest portion 5 of<br>
the body 1. During this phase the chest plate 4 will not lift. Exactly the same effect will take<br>
place when ventilating a human being. The lung will expand inwardly of the body before<br>
the inflation results in a chest heaving. In a second phase the lung will lift the chest plate 4<br>
as shown in figure 7.<br>
The deflation of the lung is facilitated by the chest plate 4 pressing the air out of the lung 2,<br>
also by the aid of the elastic cords 22. Between the lung 2 and the cavity of the central<br>
portion 10 an elastic sheet of material 29 or a plurality of elastic bands may be situated. This<br>
sheet 29 or bands will conveniently be welded or glued to the body 1. The sheet 29 or bands<br>
will act to de-inflate the portion of the lung 2 extending into the cavity of the central portion<br>
10. These functions will also have the effect of spontaneous expiration, as on a real human<br>
being.<br>
9<br><br>
Figure 8 shows the manikin during chest compression, simulating heart compression. A<br>
downward force 30 is exerted against the top surface of the chest plate 4 between the<br>
nipples 21. The upper sternal notch 19 and the sternal xyphoid process 20 will also assist the<br>
trainee in locating the correct position of the hands. The chest plate will distribute the<br>
pressure over the chest portion 5 of the body 1. The pressure will compress the chest portion<br>
5 and force air into the neck portion 6 and the head portion 7, which will expand to some<br>
degree and act as an expansion chamber. The counter pressure exerted by the body 1 gives a<br>
realistic feel of chest compression. Preferably, the deflection should be within the<br>
recommended range of 38 - 51 mm, when the recommended force is exerted.<br>
To facilitate in the learning process, a chest compression indicator, like the one described in<br>
Norwegian Patent Application No. 2002 6218 by the present applicant, and which is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference, may be integrated in the chest plate. This indicator will emit a<br>
sound when the force used for the compression is exceeding a predetermined level. An<br>
indication of correct lung inflation may also be achieved by connecting the chest<br>
compression indicator with the inflatable body 1 by a cord extending through an opening in<br>
the lung. When the lung is inflated the chest plate will be lifted and create a pull in the cord.<br>
When the pulling force exceeds a certain level a sound or visual signal is emitted from the<br>
indicator.<br>
Figure 9 shows an embodiment of the manikin incorporating an additional feature. A small<br>
air bulb 31 is situated on one or each side of the neck portion 6. The neck bulb 31 is<br>
connected via a hose 32 with a balloon pump 33. The balloon pump 33 is situated in the<br>
cavity of the central portion 10. When chest compression is performed, the balloon pump<br>
will be compressed and force air into the small neck bulbs 31. The effect of this is a<br>
simulated neck pulse. Optionally, the balloon pump may be removed from the cavity and<br>
used by an instructor to simulate neck pulse.<br>
Figure 10 shows a second and preferred embodiment of the manikin of the present<br>
invention. It comprises the same main parts as in the previous embodiment, namely an<br>
inflatable body 1, a lung 2, a face mask 3 and a chest plate 4. The differences between the<br>
10<br><br>
embodiment of figure 10 and the embodiment of figure 2 will be explained. A person of<br>
skill will understand that the features that are not specifically mentioned in the following are<br>
substantially similar in the two embodiments.<br>
The chest plate 4 has a soft groove covering a substantial part of the sternum. A piece of<br>
soft material 40 is applied or inserted in this groove 40 to allow for hand placement during<br>
compression simulation with a higher degree of gentleness to the hands of the user and a<br>
reduced risk of slipping. The soft area may be made of the same material as the face mask 3.<br>
The Xiphoid process 20 is retracted so that it is not protruding from the lower edge of the<br>
chest plate. Instead the Xiphoid process is situated fully within a recess 41 at the lower<br>
edge. This gives the user the same reference as in the embodiment of figure 2, but the<br>
chances for the Xiphoid process getting caught in other objects or getting damaged is<br>
reduced.<br>
The elastic cord 22 does not extend all the way under the inflatable body 1. Instead the cord<br>
is divided into two separate cords 22a and 22b that each extends from the chest plate 4 to a<br>
pair of ears 42a and 42b formed on the side of the inflatable body 1. The two ends of each<br>
of the cords may be fastened, preferably detachably, to these ears 42a, 42b in any suitable<br>
way. Since the cord 22 provided an escape passage for air trapped under the inflatable body<br>
1 in the embodiment of figure 2, this function is provided by other means in the<br>
embodiment of figure 10, as will be described below.<br>
Instead of the cords providing an escape passage for the air trapped under the inflatable<br>
body 1 the chest plate 4 is on its underside provided with ribs (not show) that forms a<br>
wrinkle in the inflatable body 1, along which the air may escape. The inflation tube 43 may<br>
serve the same purpose extending under the inflated body part.<br>
The width of the neck portion 6 is indented (not shown in detail) to facilitate a buckling of<br>
the neck when the head is tilted backward. This buckling form a linkage that reduces the<br>
force needed to hold the head in a backward position to a more realistic force.<br>
11<br><br>
The inside of the face mask 3 is provided with ribs that maintain the shape of the face mask<br>
3. The mask has also been shaped at the edge 26 so that a backward tilt of the head is<br>
sufficient to open the airway from the nose and mouth portion to the lung without the need<br>
to lift the jaw 27. The airway may also be opened by lifting at the jaw 27 of the mask only.<br>
Figure 11 shows the manikin from the underside. This shows a modification of the means<br>
for filling the inflatable body 1. A tube 43 is coupled to the inflatable body 1 at 44 between<br>
the neck portion and the central part 10. The central part 10 has, instead of two smaller<br>
holes, a full opening. The tube 43 extends across the opening in the central part 10 and<br>
through an ear 44 formed in the inflatable body 1 at the lower edge thereof. At the outer end<br>
of the tube a closure 45, which may be a similar closure to the type of closure used on<br>
inflatable toys, is present. However, the closure 45 does not have any non-return valve as is<br>
common in inflatable toys. Instead the tube 43 has a resilient portion 46 that may be pinched<br>
off to prevent air form escaping during filling of the inflatable body 1. This allows for a<br>
more rapid deflation of the body 1.<br>
Figure 12 a shows a lung that can be used together with the mask shown in figure 5a, with a<br>
circular flange 25. The lung 2 has a lower fastening band 48 the end thereof having the<br>
shape of an arrow. The lung also comprises a mask connecting portion 49. In this part there<br>
is an opening 50 in one of the walls of the lung. The lung also comprises a leak hole 55 that<br>
is sized to let air escape when the lung is to be deflated. The size of this leak hole 55 is<br>
small enough to not play a significant role in letting air escape when the lung is inflated, but<br>
large enough to let the air escape within a normal exhalation period when the inflation is<br>
stopped. The hole will also act to prevent an over inflation of the lung 2. It will also act to<br>
prevent visible chest rise unless the inflated volume is greater than 250 ml. The hole may<br>
also be provided with a sound generating means, e.g., a whistle, or a visible roll-out<br>
extension.<br>
Figure 12b shows a lung 2 intended for use in the embodiment of figure 10 in detail. It<br>
comprises a neck portion 14 and a chest portion 13 as the lung described in connection with<br>
figure 12a. In addition it comprises a neck band 47 that consists of two parts 47a and 47b<br>
12<br><br>
extending in opposite directions from either side of the neck portion 14. The first part 47a<br>
hds the shape of an arrow and the end of the second part 47b has the shape of a ring. The<br>
mask connecting portion 49 is oblong to fit a mask as described in figures 5b - d.<br>
The neck band 47 is fastened around the neck portion 6 of the inflatable body 1 by threading<br>
the pointed end of the band part 47a through the ring of band part 47b (se figure 15). The<br>
neck band 47 functions as a collar both to hold the lung in place and stretch the neck portion<br>
14 of the lung 2. This will close the airway and prevent air from flowing back to the mask<br>
once the lung is inflated. This function may also be fulfilled with the aid of a rubber band<br>
extending around the neck portion 6.<br>
The lower fastening band 48 may be thread through a second hole 51 in the ear 44 or if<br>
feasible through the same hole as the tube 43. This will further assist in keeping the lung in<br>
place on the inflatable body.<br>
Figures 14a - c shows the lung 2 attached to the face mask 3 with various combinations of<br>
lung and face mask. In figure 14a a mask according to figure 5a is combined with a lung<br>
according to figure 12a. In figure 14b a mask according to figure 5c is coupled to a lung<br>
according to figure 12b. In figure 14c a mask according to figure 5d is coupled to a lung<br>
according to figure 12b.<br>
Additional features are also possible with the present invention.<br>
It is also possible to use a pump (not shown) to inflate (and deflate) the body 1, to avoid<br>
contamination of the valve 9. This may also incorporate a relief valve that will prevent<br>
overfilling of the body and ensure correct filling. To facilitate the correct inflation pressure<br>
of the inflatable body 1, the body may also have indicia printed thereon that form a certain<br>
shape, e.g., a straight line, when the body is filled with correct pressure. Alternatively, the<br>
body may assume a certain, easily distinguishable, shape when the correct pressure is<br>
reached.<br>
13<br><br>
The chest plate may be planar or have a certain topography resembling a human chest.<br>
In stead of an elastic cord other elastic means may also be used to connect the chest plate to<br>
the inflatable body, like elastic net.<br>
An elastic fabric may be wrapped over the chest plate and the chest portion of the body.<br>
This may replace the elastic cords.<br>
The lung may also be situated on top of the chest plate or below the body.<br>
In stead of pinching the neck portion of the lung between the mask and the inflatable body<br>
to block the air passage, a weakening zone in the neck, to which the neck portion of the lung<br>
is fastened with a neck band 47a, 47b, allows air to pass when the head is tilted and/or the<br>
chin is lifted.<br>
The mask and lung may be replaceable as a unit to prevent contamination and avoid<br>
cleaning. The lung may have a closable opening at the bottom that can be used to let a<br>
cleaning fluid, e.g., soap or a mild disinfectantand subsequent flushing with water directly<br>
from the faucet, run though the lung, and for Sing out moisture.<br>
Suitable materials for the various components are:<br>
Inflatable body, mask and lung are preferably made of a soft plastic material, suitably a<br>
thermoplastic like PVC. PVC has a reasonably low cost and is easy the clean. Choosing the<br>
same material type for all these parts reduces the risk for chemical reactions between these<br>
parts.<br>
The chest plate is preferably made of relatively stiff plastic material and suitably a<br>
thermoplastic. This may also be PVC, but more preferably polyamide with a thermoplastic<br>
elastomer (TPE), since this is generally more durable than PVC.<br>
A thermosetting plastic may also be used.<br>
