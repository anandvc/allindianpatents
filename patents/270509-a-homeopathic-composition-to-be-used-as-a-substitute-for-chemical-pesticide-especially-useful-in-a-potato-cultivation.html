				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to homeopathic compositions for providing a substitute for Chemical Fertilizers and pesticides and a process for the preparation of the same.<br>
Further the present invention relates to a composition comprising suphuric acid and osmium Sactim in liquid forms as a substitute for Chemical pesticide for treating various diseases of vegetable plants such as tomato, chilly, bitter gourd, lady finger etc to prevent death of the plant and a process for the preparation of the same.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
A large population of India is directly dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. Every human being is inevitably dependent on agriculture and animals for their food sources. For healthy human civilization the food sources and land particularly agricultural land, must be free from toxicity and must have desired level of nutrients. A large proportion of the land which is used for growing food and crops is toxicated, nutrient deficient and are having poor physical condition. The indiscriminate use of chemical fertilizers is converting fertile land into barren land.<br><br><br>
Further on account of increase in population there is a need to convert barren land into fertile land. There is a growing need to increase the cultivable area to feed the increasing population.<br>
Due to industrial development and improper chemical waste management the toxic level in plant and in their products has been increased considerably, which is taking a toll on the health of animal kingdom including human being.<br>
Today the considerable area of land which can be cultivated and utilized for agriculture has been left wasted and barren due to toxicity or sodic / saline conditions of land.<br>
Homeopathic medicines have been found to be very useful and free from side effects when administered to human beings. However homeopathic medicines have not been used for increasing productivity of land.<br><br><br>
Object of the Invention<br>
The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a homeopathic composition for increasing fertility of agricultural land and a process for the preparation of the same.<br>
It is further objective of the present invention to provide a safe and non toxic composition free from side effects for increasing fertility of agricultural land.<br>
It is yet another objective of the present invention is to develop a composition that can be given easily and whose prolonged usages do not have any adverse effect.<br>
It is still another objective of the present invention to provide a composition which can be inexpensively produced and easily employed / administered.<br>
Yet another objective is to develop a homeopathic composition that can be stored for a longer period.<br>
Additional objects and additional advantages of the present invention will be set forth, in part, in the description that follows, or may be learned from practicing or using the present invention. The objects and advantages may be realized and attained by means of the instrumentalities and combinations particularly recited in the appended claims. It is to be understood that the foregoing detailed<br><br><br>
description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not to be viewed as being restrictive of the invention, as claimed.<br>
Statement of Invention<br>
The present invention aims to provide a cost effective and free from side effects, homeopathic composition in liquid forms for increasing fertility of agricultural land.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The novel features of the invention are set forth in the appended claims hereto. The invention itself, however, as well as a preferred mode of use, further objectives, and advantages thereof, will best be understood by reference to the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments.<br>
Further the present invention relates to a composition comprising suphuric acid and osmium Sactim in liquid forms as a substitute for Chemical pesticide for treating various diseases of vegetable plants such as tomato, chilly, bitter gourd, lady finger etc to prevent death of the plant and a process for the preparation of the same.<br>
The preparation<br>
The unique composition is prepared by mixing liquid extracts of above named<br>
ingredients in the effective ranges shown below.<br><br><br>
For a vial of 500 ml<br>
1.	Sulphuric acid - 125 to 375 ml (25-75% by Volume)<br>
2.	Osmium Sanctum -125 to 375 ml (25-75% by Volume)<br>
3.	Balance rain water<br>
The best results are achieved when the key ingredients mentioned above are used as below.<br>
For a vial of 500 ml<br>
1.	Sulphuric acid - 200 ml (40% by Volume)<br>
2.	Osmium Sanctum - 200 ml (40% by Volume)<br>
3.	Balance rain water<br>
Unique composition<br>
When these individual ingredients are administered separately the results are not encouraging. The unique combination of ingredients in the present invention shows altogether different result and different properties when compared with aggregation of the properties of the components.<br>
Following problems are solved with the help of these homeo compositions<br>
1. Use of chemical fertilizer, pesticides &amp; insecticides does increases productivity, but is too costly. Farmer's profitability gets reduced with use of chemical fertilizer, pesticides &amp; insecticides.<br><br><br>
2.	Production of crops and Quality is affected. Chemical fertilizer, pesticides<br>
&amp; insecticide is found in the crops which is harmful to health.<br>
3.	Shape and size of Fruity vegetables get distorted with chemical fertilizers<br>
and pesticides.<br>
4.	The self life of crop is less with the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides affecting the profitability of farmer and trader both.<br>
5.	Use of chemical fertilizer is converting fertile land into barren land day by day.<br>
6.	Regular use of same chemical fertilizer has reduced the production label. The insects and diseases has acquired immunity from chemical pesticides.<br>
7.	Due to use of chemical fertilizer useful worms and bacteria of soil are getting destroyed.<br>
8.	Water and air pollution is on increase on account of indiscriminate use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.<br>
9.	It is dangerous to human beings. Many types of diseases are being seen on account of indiscriminate use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.<br>
10.	The increasing cost of chemical fertilizers and pesticides is forcing farmers to commit suicide.<br><br>
11.	Soil texture and structure both are getting deteriorated.<br>
12.	Water retention capacity of soil is on decline on account of indiscriminate use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.<br><br><br>
Conclusion<br>
The Use of the Homeopathic compositions ensures following benefits apart from solving the problems associated with indiscriminate use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.<br>
1.	Less investment and more production with good quality for farmer.<br>
2.	No side effect on the soil.<br>
3.	More yield.<br>
4.	Products are fresh with better self life.<br>
5.	Fodder for animals are pure and easily digestibly, thus ensuring good health for animals.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Claims<br>
I claim<br>
1.	A homeopathic composition comprising suphuric acid and osmium Sactim in<br>
liquid forms diluted with rain water as a substitute for Chemical pesticide for<br>
treating various diseases of vegetable plants such as tomato, chilly, bitter<br>
gourd, lady finger etc to prevent death of the plant, wherein various<br>
ingredients are in following proportion for a vial of 500 ml<br>
Sulphuric acid - 125 to 375 ml (25-75% by Volume) Osmium Sanctum -125 to 375 ml (25-75% by Volume) Balance rain water<br>
2.	A homeopathic composition as claimed in claim 1, where various ingredients<br>
are in following proportion for a vial of 500 ml<br>
Sulphuric acid - 200 ml (40% by Volume) Osmium Sanctum - 200 ml (40% by Volume) <br></td>
