ANTI-CORROSION SYSTEM FOR THE COATING OF METALLIC SURFACES AND PROCESS FOR ITS PRODUCTION<br>

a)	Name        : DRESDNER LACKFABRIK NOVATIC GMBH &amp; CO. KG<br>

C) Address      : CLEMENS-MUELLER-STR. 5,<br>

3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed: -<br><br>
The invention relates to an anti-corrosion system for the coating of metallic surfaces of containers and steel structures, as well as a process for the manufacture of such an anti-corrosion system.<br>
Containers and steel structures of variety of designs are usually in use over a longer period of time. This results in to the fact that a highly efficient anti-corrosion system must overtake the long term protection of the metallic material. Depending on the expected corrosive load, for this purpose, coating systems must be selected, wherein their efficiency depends on the selected binding agent, material formula, number of layers and the layer thickness.<br>
Containers, during their long working life, as a result of goods transport, are subject to maximum number of climatic and corrosive loads. Steel structures of the most varied kind from the construction sector or plant construction have long working life, to which maintenance cycles are matched. From this, it results in to the fact that for objects in long use highest grade protective layers must be used for ensuring a long working life or longer maintenance cycles.<br>
The corrosive load of metallic materials is captured grade-wise and in the DIN EN ISO 12944, corrosion protection of Steel Structures, in Part 2 a reference are made to the categories of corrosiveness. The highest protection requirement for a coating system at atmospheric load, in the DIN EN ISO 12944 in case of corrosiveness category C5-M a reference is made to a high protection. The DIN EN ISO 12944 has for the load according to category of corrosiveness C5M high protection duration multi-layer protection systems with overall layer thicknesses, depending on the binding agent of 320 urns to 500 um.<br>
Coating systems, which are exclusively produced with water thinning coating materials in these layer thickness ranges, are so far practically not in use.<br>
Foreign containers are exposed to highly corrosive loads. Anti-corrosion coatings for<br><br>
Containers must be mechanically robust besides the necessary anti-corrosion properties and should have for this a high adhesive strength and permanent elasticity.<br>
Containers and steel structures, depending on the area of deployment, are protected with this 2- or 3-layer protection system on long term basis against corrosion and external influences.<br>
In choosing the anti-corrosion system the expected load at the place of deployment or in-the deployment area of the object to be protected must be taken into consideration, which in turn reflects in the selection of individual components of the coating and the layer thickness of the protection system.<br>
The necessary anti-corrosion systems are mostly 3-layered. 1-component and 2-component coating materials. The best long term corrosion protection is enabled by 2-component epoxy resin (EP) zinc powder primers. 2-component polyurethane (PUR)-top coats enable a long term weather resistance, wherein also 1-component acrylic top paints enable good weather resistance. For overseas containers the dry layer thicknesses of 3-Iayer anti-corrosion systems in the exterior area are between 130 nm and 185 Î¼m,<br>
In automatic large plants for container manufacture due to technological reasons at present solvent based coating materials are in use. The large scale manufacture of containers follows in series production; herein automatic coating chambers and drying chambers are included. As base coat solvent based 2-component EP zinc powder primers dominate in 3-layer systems with 2-component EP intermediate layers and a 2-component PUR top coat.<br>
Compulsory consideration while selecting anti-corrosion systems to be used in the industrial anti-corrosion protection must find the time, in which the complete protection system can be applicable. It means, for reasons of a fast and, if required,<br><br>
Due to automatic production run very short time for re-work work of individual layers are necessary.<br>
The cycle times in automatic large plants of container manufacture are relatively short, also in the automatic spray painting plants. The short cycle times are applicable for the run in the sequence Spray Painting Chamber, Drying Chamber and again Spray Painting Chamber for the next coating process, etc. continuous and demand in a 3-layer system for all coats to be applied very short drying and provisioning times. The coat to be applied last must dry similarly in the cycle regime, wherein the entire coating system must be early water loadable in just after 2 hours. With solvent based coating materials these requirements can be met, also with cycle times of 10 to 15 minutes, however, only with a solvent proportion of above 50%.<br>
The disadvantage of using solvent based or low solvent containing systems on 2-component basis with a solvent content of below 40% lies in the application of multiple coats in the necessary longer waiting period before applying the next coat.<br>
Another disadvantage of solvent based or low solvent 2- component system in the industrial sector with often very large quantities of processed coating materials lies in the considerable emission of solvent. However, less the overall content of the solvent in such 2-component systems, comparatively longer re-work times of individual coats must be taken into consideration. Particularly, when, for the reason of UV stability, a top coat should be applied on the polyurethene (PUR) base. In case of very short re-work time of the previous EP (epoxy) coating with the polyurethene(PUR) top coat, it can result in to side reactions and thus in to surface disturbances. The quick industrial application of an environment friendly multi-coat system with high protective effect according to the category of corrosiveness C5-I or C5-M high protection duration could not be implemented in practise.<br>
Water soluble 1-component and 2-component coating materials are used at present within the container manufacture, if the coating activity follows manually in spray<br><br><br>
painting chambers with the necessary drying or re-work times.<br>
Water soluble 2-component EP zinc powder primer coatings, for intermediate coastings, water soluble 1-component acrylic coasting materials or 2-component EP (epoxy) coating materials and for the top coat water soluble 1-component coating materials on acrylic base or 2-component materials on PUR base are known, however, these cannot be used technically so far in automatic spray painting systems with the usual short cycle times up to the next coating operation, as a result of necessary very short drying and re-work times.<br>
The DE 4336012 Al describes a coating medium and its application for the internal coating of containers. Characterisitic here is coating medium, which consists of a base component and a hardener, wherein in the base component synthetic micaceous iron ore is used. As binding agent for the base component is used an epoxy resin, for the hardener an amine addition compound. In the represented example a modified zinc aluminium phosphate acts as active anti-corrosion pigment.<br>
In the DE 10142687 Al water soluble anti-corrsion coating materials are described, which contains a water soluble, radical polymerisable compound and at least one water dispergent polymerizable post-crosslinking compound and minimum one free radical forming water dispersible compount in case of reaction of actinic radiation, that harden with each other. Anti-corrosion primer on polyester resin or/and epoxy resin based is described, which consists of a mixture of 70 to 95 % Zinc, aluminium, graphite or/and molybdenum sulfide and anti-corrosion pigments as well as of 5 to 30 % of an organic binder, if necessary, additives, based on the dry film. As top coatings special water soluble 2-copmponent PUR lackquer is used. The coats harden by means of UV radiation, chemical post-crosslinking and, if necessary,with additional heating.<br>
In the EP-A 0 761 320 coated steel plates are introduced, which possess an organic protection  coat,  which  were  produced  through  electrolytic  polymerisation  of ionogenic polymerisable organic compounds of watery solution.<br>
The DE 10 2005 061 318 A 1 relates to a preparation and a process for applying anti-corrosionive coats on metallic surfaces, wherein the preparation covers at least a binder system which hardens under atmospheric conditions, a dicarbonic acid-Olefin co-polymer as well as a fine particle filling material, a pigment or a dye. Also contained are as binder dispersions of polyacrylates, styrol acrylates co-polymers, styrol alcali polymers, polyurethenes or Alkali resins. With these binders 3-layered coating systems are formed, which are recommended also for the coating of containers and steel fabrications. The coated metallic surfaces can be exposed here at least to a corrosion load of the category C2 according to DIN EN ISO 12944.<br>
The EP-A 157 133 reveals a binder composition for watery anti-corrosion coatings, which cover a watery dispersion of poly(meth)acrylic copolymers as well as zinc complex salt of polymer polycarbonic acids. The formulations can cover also corrosion inhibitors as well as anti-corrosion pigments.<br>
The WO99/46337 reveals a watery polymer dispersion, for example from alkyl(meth)acrylates, vinyl esters or vinyl aromatic compounds, in combination with an emulsifying agent having phosphate groups and their use as binder for painting dyes or anti-corrosion lacquer.<br>
The US 6,090,894 reveals OH functionalised copolymers and their use for the productions of lacquers for coating of metalls or plastics. The OH functional copolymers will contain through polymer-analogical conversion of epoxy compounds with copolymers containing COOH groups from maleic acid mono or diesters and a-Olefin carbonic acids as well as, if necessary, more monomers. In case of epoxy compounds, these can be, for example, glycidyle compounds, ethylene oxide or preferred propylene oxide.<br>
The invention is based on the task of informing about an industrially applicable anti-<br>
corrosion system by using water soluble components and a process for the production of the same, which can be applied through manual or automatic lacquering processes and allows extraordinarily short rework intervals between the individual layers, wherein a high level of anti-corrosion effect of C5-I or C5-M and a high protection duration according to DIN ISO 12944 should be achieved. These properties are to be combined with high environmental friendliness and lowest possible solvent emission.<br>
According to the invention the task is resolved through a 3-Iayer anti-corrosion system accordding to the independent claim 1. Other advantageous designs are apparent from the relevant sub-claims.<br>
Alternatively the task is resolved through a 2-layer anti-corrosion system according to the independent claim 5. Advantageous designs are apparent from the relevant sub-claims.<br>
The task forming the basis of this invention is further resolved through a process for the production of an anti-corrosion system according to the independent claim 10. Further advantageous designs are to be taken from the depedent claims.<br>
In the invention based process the base coat consisting of water soluble 2-component epoxy resin-hardener combination with zinc powder proportion already after 10-15 minutes with a similarly water soluble intermediate coat on acrylic EP resin base with active anti-corrosion pigmentation and inhibitors. After another 15 minutes the decorative demanding water soluble top coat on an acrylic resin-resin combination base with acrylic EP resin is applied. This coating system characterizes after its completion additionally through a high early water resistance already after 2 hours.<br>
For such kind of coating system only a minor time need to be spent, since the conception of individual layers enables the respective faultless reworking after extraordinarily short time. The present coating systems consist of several protective layers with different functions. From the base coat a high adhesion on the metal base is demanded. This must be useful as shop primer and should fulfil as well the function of actual base coat. The base coat must electro-chemically protect the below substrate through its zinc power content in the pigment. The intermediate coat has the function of a diffusion block and contains similarly active anti-corrosion pigments and Inhibitoren. The top coating must possess a long term and. very good weather resistance with UV stability. From this result preferably well decorative properties like glow-life and color shade stability as well as a minor aging and a minor decomposition of layer.<br>
Application areas for the present systems are the coating and the protection of containers of all kind and transport means, which are deployed in the marine influence area.<br>
Further steel fabrications of all kind, which are subject to a load according to DIN EN ISO 12944 C5-I or C5-M high protection duration.<br>
For the invention it is vital, that the subsequent layers can be applied each after 10-15 minutes on the previous layer, without negatively influencing the claim of the system with respect to corrosion protection and optical properties. This is achieved in the manner that the individual layers are best aligned with each other and ensure through the special formulation an unusually fast water discharge while simultaneous optimum film formation. The coating follows in advantageous manner at temperatures between 8Â°C to 30Â°C and a relative humidity of 40 % to 80%.<br>
A specially advantageous formulation of water soluble 2-component epoxy primer consists in the selected 2-component EP resin/hardener combination, wherein the EP resin has epoxy aquivalent mass of greater than 400 and the hardener is poly amine addition and/or a polyamino amid with an amine equivalent of greater than 120.<br>
Such a primer coat has an EP resin content of 8 to 25 % and a hardener content of 1 to 10 %, from which a mixing ratio in the range of 2:1 to 8:1 results. The epoxy resin hardener combination in combination with the selected pigmentation, containing more than 65 % zinc powder, a Pigment-Volume concentration (PVK) in the range of 10 to 50 Vol.% and special co-solutizers leads to the extreme quick drying and reworkability in a dry layer thickness range from 10 urn to 100 Î¼m.<br>
As co-solutizer polar solvents are deployed, which can be partially or completely mixed with water. Preferred applied are monoalkyl ether of ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol and propylene glycol, like the butyl glycol and variety of alcohols and ketons. Co-solutizers continue to influence so important properties like pigment and substrate crosslinking, drying process and film formation.<br>
The quick drying intermediate coat of the anti-corrosion system for containers and steel fabrications on an acrylated epoxy resin base is formulated in the manner that binder content amounts to between 15 and 30 weight % and a formation of a structure takes place by using lamellar and spherical pigments and filling materials, anti-corrosions pigments and organic inhibitors. The PVK has a range of 10 Vol.% to 60 Vol.%.<br>
In especially advantageous manner top coats are deployed, which consist of an exactly matched combination of acrylic resin and acrylated epoxy resins, wherein whose binder composition can consist of 30 to 70 weight% acrylic epoxi resin in combination with 70 to 30 weight% acrylic resin. The pigmentation consists of lamellar and spheric pigments and filling materials. The PVK can move in a range of 10-50 Vol.%.<br>
From this result quick drying, dense, not water repellent top coats, which overall lead to quick early water resistent total coats. Protective layers result, which are early water resistent as early as after 2 hours. The entire multi-layer structure with a dry layer thickness in the range of 120 urn achieves in corrosion short tests according to DIN EN ISO 12944 the category of corrosiveness C5-I or C5-M and a high protection duration.<br>
The system described according to the invention consisting of 2-3 individual layers can be surprisingly applied completely also as 3-layer structure in a gap of 10-15 minutes per individual layer within 45 minutes. This is valid for generally large scale applied spray process like airless, airless with additional air and for HVLP and high pressure spray process, wherein for manual and automatic spraying processes alike. For example, between 10 and 100 um per individual layer are applied, which result together ideally a layer thickness of 30 to 150 um for the intermediate layer structure and 70 to 300 um for the 3-layer structure.<br>
The system described according to the inveniton has with indicated time-wise sequence and working method in the total structure for the 3-layer system a dry layer thickness of 70 to 300 um, preferably around 120 um, which has surprisingly already 2 hours after end of application a high early water resistance, which represent a non-typically early value for single component and physically drying coats. For the intermediate layer system, acccoding to the invention, layer thicknesses are achieved in the range of 30 to 150 um, preferably around 90 um.<br>
Further, the system described as per invention has a surprisingly high anti-corrosion impact, which equals according to DIN EN ISO 12944 of the category of corrosiveness C5-I or C5-M high protection duration and in general it can be achieved only by complete 2-component systems with clearly greater layer thicknesses.<br>
Of particular advantage is the usage of invention based system and process solution for the user, wherein on the one hand large surface areas on industrial scale need to be coated in short and cyclic intervals, which must be, however, at the same time connected at lowest possible layer thicknesses with a high corrosion protection and very low solvent emission. The coating materials of the coating system are applied within an industrial coating sequence duly air dried above 5Â°C to 30 Â°C air temperature.<br>
The application is done by means of known application methods like airless, airless with air support, HVLP (High Volume Low Pressure)or high pressure spraying in an automatic plant or by manual means.<br>
In an alternative embodiment in the temperature range from 10Â°C to 80Â°C normal or forced warm drying can be carried out, wherein the coating material compositions allow a quick water repelling through an isenthalpic or isothermal temperature guiding during the drying process.<br>
The invention should be explained further in details in the following on the basis oi some execution examples and coating material examples.<br>
