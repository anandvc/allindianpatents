PROCESS FOR PHOTOCURING WITH LIGHT EMITTING DIODES<br>
The present invention is aimed at a process for photocuring certain thick layer ethylenically unsaturated systems with a light emitting diode (LED) light source.<br>
Light emitting diode light sources have been used for example for dental applications. For example as disclosed in U.S. Pat. apps. 2002113217, 2002115037 and 2001046652, CA 2332190, JP 2000271155, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,200,134 and 6,159,005, EP 780104, EP 780103, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,316,473 and 6,007,965. The relevant disclosures of the U.S. applications and Patents are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
It has been difficult to efficiently cure certain thick section coatings, gel coats, composites and adhesives. For example thick sections that are thicker than about 10 mils [= about 0.25 mm].<br>
Surprisingly, the present process provides for good surface cure and good through cure without surface wrinkling for thick sections. Also surprisingly, the present process cures thick sections faster than thin layers. This is especially surprising as the opposite is true with conventional light sources such as ultraviolet or visible light.<br>
Subject of the invention therefor is a process for curing ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable compounds,<br>
which process comprises<br>
adding to said compounds at least one acylphosphine oxide photoinitiator<br>
and irradiating the mixture so obtained with radiation from a light emitting diode<br>
source.<br>
Advantageously,   mixtures   of   monoacylphosphine   oxide   and   bisacylphosphine   oxide<br>
photoinitators are employed.<br>
Also advantageously, mixtures of either monacylphosphine oxide or bisacylphosphine oxide<br>
photoinitators with a-hydroxyketone photoinitiators are employed.<br>
Likewise,   mixtures   of   monoacylphosphine   oxide,    bisacylphosphine   oxide   and   a-<br>
hydroxyketone photoinitiators are employed.<br><br>
in particular, the present process is suitable for thick coatings, thick gel coats, thick multi-ply composites or thick adhesive layers.<br>
Thick coatings are greater than about 10 mils [= about 0.25 mm], for example from greater than 10 mils to about 30 mils [= about 0.76 mm]. The present thick coatings are for example coatings for metal, plastic or glass. The coatings are for example acrylate based coatings.<br>
Present adhesives are thick layer adhesives, for example greater than about 10 mil, for example from greater than about 10 mil [= about 0.25 mm] to about 30 mil [= about 0.76 mm]. Adhesives are for example laminating, structure or pressure sensitive adhesives, such as for example pressure sensitive hot-melt adhesives.<br>
Said adhesives can be hot melt adhesives as well waterborne or solvent borne adhesives. In particular suitable are pressure-sensitive adhesives, for example uv-curable hot melt pressure sensitive adhesives. Said adhesives for example comprise at least one rubber component, at least one resin component as tackyfier and at least one oil component, for example in the weight ratio 30:50:20. Suitable tackyfier are natural or synthetic resins. The person skilled in the art is aware of suitable corresponding compounds as well as of suitable oil components or rubbers.<br>
The gel coats are also greater than about 10 mil [= about 0.25 mm], for example from greater than about 10 mil to about 30 mils [= about 0.76 mm] thick. The gel coats are typically white, containg high loading of TiO2, for example between about 10% and about 25% by weight based on the entire formulation.<br>
For example the present coatings, adhesive layers and gel coats are greater than about 11, 12, 13, 14 or greater than about 15 mil [greater than about 0.28, 0.31, 0.325, 0.36 or greater than about 0.38 mm].<br>
Composites are multi-ply thick systems, for example from greater than about 25 mil [about 0.64 mm], for example from about 25 mil to about 300 mil [about 7.6 mm]. Composites comprise for example from about 2 to about 8 plys. Composite materials are for example styrenic polyesters, which may contain glass fibers and other assistants. The composite composition is made up of a self-supporting matrix material, for example a glass-fiber fabric,<br><br>
or else, for example, plant fibers (cf. K.-P. Mieck and T. Reussmann in Kunststoffe 85 (1995), 366-370), which is impregnated with the photocuring formulation. Shaped articles which are produced from composite compositions are of high mechanical stability and resistance.<br>
Composites according to this invention are used for example in boats, chipboard or plywood panels coated on both sides with glass fiber-reinforced plastic, pipes, containers and the like. Other examples of composites are UP resin coatings for moldings containing glass fibers (GRP), e.g. corrugated sheets and paper laminates. Paper laminates may also be based on urea or melamine resins. The coating is produced on a support (for example a sheet) prior to the production of the laminate. A further advantage is that the composite composition can be removed in a part-cured, plastic state from the light source and can be shaped. Complete curing is carried out subsequently.<br>
The present composites are for example clear.<br>
The LED light sources according to the invention operate at low heat. For example the LED light sources operate at about 390 nm plus or minus 30 nm, at about 250 mW/cm2. The LED light sources operate at low heat, for example below the bp of volatiles in the resin, for example below the bp of styrene at atmospheric pressure.<br>
The acylphosphine oxide photoinitiators are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,324,744, 4.737,593, 5,942,290, 5.534,559. 6.020,528, 6,486,228 and 6,486,226, the relevant disclosure of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>

Other suitable photoinitiators according to this invention, with or without acylphosphine oxide photoinitiators, are for example oxime esters as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,596,445, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. A suitable oxime ester photoinitiator is for example <br><br>
Another class of suitable photoinitiators according to this invention, with or without acylphosphine oxide photoinitiators, are for example phenyl glyoxalates, for example as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,048,660, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. For example phenyl glyoxalates of the formula<br><br>

The photopolymerizable mixtures may contain various additives in addition to the photoinitiator. Examples of these are thermal inhibitors, which are intended to prevent premature polymerization, examples being hydroquinone, hydroquinone derivatives, p-methoxyphenol, beta-naphthol or sterically hindered phenols, such as 2,6-di(tert-butyI)-p-cresol. The shelf life in the dark can be increased, for example, by using copper compounds, such as copper naphthenate, copper stearate or copper octoate, phosphorus compounds, for example triphenylphosphine, tributylphosphine, triethyl phosphite, triphenyl phosphite or tribenzyl phosphite, quaternary ammonium compounds, such as tetramethylammonium chloride or trimethylbenzylammonium chloride, or hydroxylamine derivatives, such as N-diethylhydroxylamine. In order to keep out atmospheric oxygen during the polymerization, paraffin or similar waxlike substances can be added; these migrate to the surface on commencement of the polymerization because of their low solubility in the polymer, and form a transparent surface layer which prevents the ingress of air. It is likewise possible to apply an oxygen barrier layer. Light stabilizers which can be added are UV absorbers, for example well known commercial UV absorbers of the hydroxyphenylbenzotriazole, hydroxyphenyl-benzophenone, oxalamide or hydroxyphenyl-s-triazine type. It is possible to use individual such compounds or mixtures thereof, with or without the use of sterically hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS). Sterically hindered amines are for example based on 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine.<br>

To accelerate the photopolymerization it is possible to add amines, for example triethanolamine, N-methyldiethanolamine, ethyl p-dimethylaminobenzoate or Michler's ketone. The action of the amines can be intensified by the addition of aromatic ketones of the benzophenone type. Examples of amines which can be used as oxygen scavengers are substituted   N,N-dialkylanilines  as  described   in  EP-A-339  841.     Further accelerators,<br><br>
coinitiators and autoxidizers are thiols, thioethers, disulfides and phosphines, as are described, for example, in EP-A-438 123 and GB-A-2 180 358.<br>
The photopolymerization can also be accelerated by the addition of photosensitizers, which shift or broaden the spectral sensitivity. These are, in particular, aromatic carbonyl compounds, such as benzophenone derivatives, thioxanthone derivatives, anthraquinone derivatives and 3-acylcoumarin derivatives, and also 3-(aroylmethylene)thiazolines, and also eosine, rhodamine and erythrosine dyes.<br>
The curing procedure can be assisted, in particular, by compositions which are pigmented (for example with titanium dioxide), and also by adding a component which forms free radicals under thermal conditions, for example an azo compound such as 2,2!-azobis(4-methoxy-2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile), a triazene, a diazo sulfide, a pentazadiene or a peroxy compound, such as a hydroperoxide or peroxycarbonate, for example t-butyl hydroperoxide, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,753,817.<br>
The novel compositions can also include a photoreducible dye, for example xanthene, benzoxanthene, benzothioxanthene, thiazine, pyronine, porphyrin or acridine dyes, and/or a trihalomethyl compound which can be cleaved by radiation. Similar compositions are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,229,253.<br>
Other conventional additives are -depending on the intended application- fluorescent whiteners, fillers, pigments, dyes, wetting agents or levelling assistants. Thick and pigmented coatings can also contain glass microbeads or powdered glass fibers, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,768, for example.<br>
The ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable compounds can contain one or more than one olefinic double bond. They may be low molecular (monomeric) or high molecular (oligo-meric) compounds.<br>
Typical examples of monomers containing one double bond are alkyl or hydroxyalkyl acrylates or methacrylates, for example methyl, ethyl, butyl, 2-ethylhexyl and 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, isobornyl acrylate, and methyl and ethyl methacrylate. Further examples of these monomers are acrylonitrile, acrylamide, methacrylamide, N-substituted (meth)acrylamides,<br><br>
vinyl esters such as vinyl acetate, vinyl ethers such as isobutyl vinyl ether, styrene, alkylstyrenes, halostyrenes, N-vinylpyrrolidone, vinyl chloride and vinylidene chloride.<br>

Examples of high molecular weight (oligomeric) polyunsaturated compounds are acrylated epoxy resins, acrylated polyethers, acrylated polyurethanes and acrylated polyesters. Further examples of unsaturated oligomers are unsaturated polyester resins, which are usually prepared from maleic acid, phthalic acid and one or more diols and which have molecular weights of greater than about 500. Unsaturated oligomers of this type are also known as prepolymers.<br>
Typical examples of unsaturated compounds are esters of ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids and polyols or polyepoxides, and polymers containing ethylenically unsaturated groups in the chain or in side groups, including unsaturated polyesters, polyamides and polyurethanes and copolymers thereof, polybutadiene and butadiene copolymers, polyisoprene and isoprene copolymers, polymers and copolymers containing (meth)acrylic groups in side-chains, as well as mixtures of one or more than one such polymer.<br>
Illustrative examples of unsaturated carboxylic acids are acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid, itaconic acid, cinnamic acid, unsaturated fatty acids such as linolenic acid or oleic acid.<br>
Suitable polyols are aromatic, aliphatic and cycloaliphatic polyols. Aromatic polyols are typically hydroquinone, 4,4'-dihydroxydiphenyl, 2,2-bis(4-hydroxypheny|)propane, as well as novolacs and cresols. Polyepoxides include those based on the cited polyols, for instance on the aromatic polyols and epichlorohydrin. Further suitable polyols are polymers and copolymers which contain hydroxyl groups in the polymer chain or in side groups, for example polyvinyl alcohol and copolymers thereof or hydroxyalkyl polymethacrylates or copolymers thereof. Other suitable polyols are oligoesters carrying hydroxyl end groups.<br><br>
Illustrative examples of aliphatic and cycloaliphatic polyols are alkylenediols containing for example 2 to 12 carbon atoms, including ethylene glycol, 1,2- or 1,3-propanediol, 1,2-, 1,3-or 1,4-butanediol, pentanediol, hexanediol, octanediol, dodecanediol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, polyethylene glycols having molecular weights of for instance 200 to 1500, 1,3-cyclopentanediol, 1,2-, 1,3-or 1,4-cyclohexanediol, 1,4-dihydroxymethylcyclohexane, glycerol, tris(n-hydroxyethyl)amine, trimethylolethane, trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol and sorbitol.<br>
The polyols may be esterified partially or completely with one or with different unsaturated carboxylic acids, in which case the free hydroxyl groups of the partial esters may be modified, for example etherified, or esterified with other carboxylic acids.<br>
Illustrative examples of esters are: Trimethylolpropane triacrylate, trimethylolethane triacrylate, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate, trimethylolethane trimethacrylate, tetramethylene glycol dimethacrylate, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, tetraethylene glycol diacrylate, pentaerythritol diacrylate, pentaerythritol triacrylate, pentaerythritol tetraacrylate, dipentaerythritol diacrylate, dipentaerythritol triacrylate, dipentaerythritol tetraacrylate, dipentaerythritol pentacrylate, dipentaerythritol hexacrylate, tripentaerythritol octacrylate, pentaerythritol dimethacrylate, pentaerythritol trimethacrylate, dipentaerythritol dimethacrylate, dipentaerythritol tetramethacrylate, tripentaerythritol octamethacrylate, pentaerythritol diitaconate, dipentaerythritol trisitaconate, dipentaerythritol pentaitaconate, dipentaerythritol hexaitaconate, ethylene glycol diacrylate, 1,3-butanediol diacrylate, 1,3-butanediol dimethacrylate, 1,4-butanediol diitaconate, sorbitol triacrylate, sorbitol tetraacrylate, pentaerythritol-modified triacrylate, sorbitol tetramethacrylate, sorbitol pentacrylate, sorbitol hexacrylate, oligoester acrylates and methacrylates, glycerol di- and-triacrylate, 1,4-cyclohexanediacrylate, bisacrylates and bismethacrylates of polyethylene glycol having molecular weights of 200 to 1500, or mixtures thereof. Polyfunctional monomers and oligomers are available for example from UCB Chemicals, Smyrna, Georgia, and Sartomer, Exton, Pennsylvania.<br>
Suitable ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable compounds are also the amides of identical or different unsaturated carboxylic acids of aromatic, cycloaliphatic and aliphatic polyamines containing for instance 2 to 6, for example 2 to 4, amino groups.    Exemplary of such<br><br>
polyamines are ethylenediamine, 1,2- or 1,3-propylenediamine, 1,2-, 1,3-or 1,4-butylene-diamine, 1,5-pentylenediamine, 1,6-hexylenediamine, octylenediamine, dodecylenediamine, 1,4-diaminocyclohexane, isophoronediamine, phenylenediamine, bisphenylenediamine, bis-(P-aminoethyl) ether, diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, bis(p-aminoethoxy)ethane or bis(p-aminopropoxy)ethane. Other suitable polyamines are polymers and copolymers which may contain additional amino groups in the side-chain and oligoamides containing amino end groups.<br>
Exemplary of such unsaturated amides are: methylenebisacrylamide, 1,6-hexamethylene-bisacrylamide, diethylenetriaminetrismethacrylamide, bis(methacrylamidopropoxy)ethane, p-methacrylamidoethylmethacrylate, N-[(p-hydroxyethoxy)ethyl]acrylamide.<br>
Suitable unsaturated polyesters and polyamides are derived typically from maleic acid and diols or diamines. Maleic acid can be partially replaced by other dicarboxylic acids such as fumaric acid, itaconic acid, citraconic acid, mesaconic acid or chloromaleic acid. To control the reactivity of the polyester and to influence the crosslinking density and hence the product properties, it is possible to use in addition to the unsaturated dicarboxylic acids different amounts of saturated dicarboxylic acids such as phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, tetrahydrophthalic acid, succinic acid or adipic acid. The unsaturated polyesters can be used together with ethylenically unsaturated comonomers such as styrene. The polyesters and polyamides can also be derived from dicarboxylic acids and ethylenically unsaturated diols or diamines, especially from those with long chains containing typically from 6 to 20 carbon atoms. Polyurethanes are typically those derived from saturated or unsaturated diisocyanates and unsaturated and saturated diols.<br>
Suitable polyester acrylates or acrylated polyesters are obtained by reacting oligomers, typically epoxides, urethanes, polyethers or polyesters, with acrylates such as hydroxyethyl acrylate or hydroxypropyl acrylate.<br>
Polybutadiene and polyisoprene and copolymers thereof are known. Suitable comonomers include olefins such as ethylene, propene, butene, hexene, (meth)acrylates, acrylonitrile, styrene or vinyl chloride. Polymers containing (meth)acrylate groups in the side-chain are also known. They may typically be reaction products of epoxy resins based on novolak with (meth)acrylic acid, homo- or copolymers of polyvinyl alcohol or their hydroxyalkyl derivatives<br><br>
which are esterified with (meth)acrylic acid or homo- and copolymers of (meth)acrylates which are esterified with hydroxyalkyl(meth)acrylates.<br>
Monomers are for instance alkyl- or hydroxyalkyl acrylates or methacrylates, styrene, ethylene glycol diacrylate, propylene glycoi diacrylate, neopentyl glycol diacrylate, hexamethylene glycol diacrylate or bisphenol A diacrylate, 4,4'-bis(2-acryloyloxyethoxy)di-phenylpropane, trimethylolpropane triacrylate, pentaerythritol triacrylate or tetraacrylate, for instance acrylates, styrene, hexamethylene glycol or bisphenol A diacrylate, 4,4'-bis(2-acryloyloxyethoxy)diphenylpropane or trimethylolpropane triacrylate.<br>
Oligomeriq polyunsaturated compounds are for instance polyester acrylates or unsaturated polyester resins which are prepared from maleic acid, fumaric acid, phthalic acid and one or more than one diol, and which typically have molecular weights from about 500 to 3000.<br>
Unsaturated carboxylic acids are for example acrylic acid and methacrylic acid.<br>
The photopolymerizable compounds are used by themselves or in any desired mixtures. It is suitable to use mixtures of polyol(meth)acrylates.<br>
Binders may also be added to the unsaturated photopolymerizable compounds. The addition of binders is particularly useful if the photopolymerizable compounds are liquid or viscous substances. The amount of binder may be from 5-95, for example 10-90, for instance 40-90, percent by weight, based on the entire composition. The choice of binder will depend on the field of use and the desired properties therefore, such as the ability of the compositions to be developed in aqueous and organic solvent systems, adhesion to substrates and susceptibility to oxygen.<br>
Suitable binders are typically polymers having a molecular weight of about 5,000 to 2,000,000, for instance 10,000 to 1,000,000. Illustrative examples are: Homo- and copolymers of acrylates and methacrylates, including copolymers of methyl methacrylate/ethyl acrylate/methacrylic acid, poly(alkylmethacrylates), poly(alkylacrylates); cellulose esters and ethers such as cellulose acetate, cellulose acetobutyrate, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose; polyvinyl butyral, polyvinyl formal, cyclized rubber, polyethers such as polyethylene oxide, polypropylene oxide, polytetrahydrofuran; polystyrene, polycarbonate, polyurethane, chlorinated polyolefins, polyvinyl chloride, copolymers of vinyl chloride/vinylidene chloride,<br><br>
copolymers of vinyliclene chloride with acrylonitrile, methyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate, polyvinyl acetate, copoly(ethylene/vinyl acetate), polymers such as polycaprolactam and poly(hexamethylene adipamide), polyesters such as poly(ethylene glycol terephthalate) and poly(hexamethylene glycol succinate).<br>
The unsaturated compounds can also be used in admixture with non-photopolymerizable film-forming components. These components may be physically drying polymers or solutions thereof in organic solvents, for example nitrocellulose or cellulose acetobutyrate. The photo-polymerizable unsaturated monomers may be a component of a free radical-ionic curable blend, such as a free radical-cationic curable blend. Also of importance are systems that undergo both thermal and photo-induced curing cycles, such as are used in powder coatings, laminates, certain adhesives and conformal coatings.<br>
Mixtures of a prepolymer with polyunsaturated monomers which, additionally contain a further unsaturated monomer are suitable. The prepolymer in this instance primarily determines the properties of the film and, by varying it, the skilled person can influence the properties of the cured film. The polyunsaturated monomer acts as crosslinking agent that renders the film insoluble. The mono-unsaturated monomer acts as reactive diluent with the aid of which the viscosity is lowered without having to use a solvent. Moreover, properties of the cured composition such as curing rate, crosslinking density and surface properties are dependent on the choice of monomer.<br>
Unsaturated polyester resins are usually used in two-component systems, together with a mono-unsaturated monomer, for example with styrene.<br>
Binary electron-rich/electron-poor monomer systems are often employed in thick pigmented coatings. For example, vinyl ether/unsaturated polyester systems are employed in powder coatings and styrene/unsaturated polyester systems are used in gel coats.<br>
A suitable process is that wherein the ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable compounds are a mixture of at least one oligomeric compound and at least one monomer.<br>
An interesting process is that wherein the ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable compounds are a mixture of 1) unsaturated polyesters, especially those that are prepared<br><br>
from maleic acid, fumaric acid and/or phthalic acid and one or more than one diol, and which have molecular weights of 500 to 3,000, and 2) acrylates, methacrylates or styrene or combinations thereof.<br>
An important process is also that wherein the ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable compounds are a mixture of 1) unsaturated polyesters and 2) acrylates or methacrylates or combinations thereof.<br>
Another interesting process is that wherein the ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable compounds are a mixture of 1) unsaturated polyester acrylates and 2) acrylates or methacrylates or combinations thereof.<br>
Coating of the substrates can be carried out by applying to the substrate a liquid composition, a solution or a suspension. The choice of solvents and the concentration depend principally on the type of composition and on the coating technique. The solvent should be inert, i.e. it should not undergo a chemical reaction with the components and should be able to be removed again, after coating, in the course of drying. Examples of suitable solvents are ketones, ethers and esters, such as methyl ethyl ketone, isobutyl methyl ketone, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone, N-methylpyrrolidone, dioxane, tetra-hydrofuran, 2-methoxyethanol, 2-ethoxyethanol, 1 -methoxy-2-propanol, 1,2-dimethoxy-ethane, ethyl acetate, n-butyl acetate and ethyl 3-ethoxypropionate. The solution is applied uniformly to a substrate by means of known coating techniques, for example by spin coating, dip coating, knife coating, curtain coating, brushing, spraying, especially by electrostatic spraying, and reverse-roll coating. It is also possible to apply the photosensitive layer to a temporary, flexible support and then to coat the final substrate, for example a copper-clad circuit board, by transferring the layer via lamination.<br>
The invention is further described in the following Examples. Unless otherwise indicated, parts and percentages are by weight, based on the weight of the entire formulation.<br>
Example 1 - gel coat:<br>

added to control viscosity. Styrene is present at 35 % by weight, based on the weight of the<br><br>
entire formulation. The other components are rutile TiO2, 15% by weight and as photoinitiator, bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phenylphosphine, 2% by weight. The mixture is drawn down on the glass substrate and cured to a glassy solid state. The LED source has a narrow output between 380 and 400 nm, CW power of 250 mW/cm2. Lamp distance is about 12 mm above the sample. The film thickness is about 20 mils.<br>
