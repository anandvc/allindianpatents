This invention relates to fire extinguishing and fire/bum resistance. An invention for producing several natural herbal mixtures for imparting fire resisting properties to normally flammable materials, both living and non-living, and also for producing a herbal spray fire extinguisher<br>
A)	Conventional fire extinguishers and their defects:<br>
Conventional fire extinguishers suffer from several problems as environmental pollution heavy weight, high cost, difficult operation and hazards to health.<br>
Some of the fire extinguishers are known to generate CFCs which are known to be damaging the Ozone layer and therefore have been widely discouraged internationally <br>
No fire extinguishers of today use only natural or biodegradable materials as inputs.<br>
Lastly no fire extinguishers of today are capable of preventing burning or producing fire resistance to inflammable materials such as paper, cloth, wood, plastic materials, etc.<br>
Claim : Natural herbal fire extinguisher, fire resistant and prevention liquid spray.<br>
Description : Natural, organically derived biodegradable, non-CFC generating, low-cost fire extinguishing liquid and / or semi-solid having the additional inherent capabilities of preventing burning and flammability of normally materials such as but not limited to paper, cloth, plastics, wood and plant, animal and human tissues, skin or body parts, upon being sprayed or coated or applied on by this spray.<br>
B)	PROCESS<br>
This mixture is produced from the liquid extracts of plants origins either, in isolation or in combination of one or more of the following resources:<br>
1)	Rosa Alba<br>
2)	Aloe Vera<br>
3)	Chrysanthermum<br><br><br><br><br>
(i)        This invention relates to fire extinguishing and fire/bum resistance.<br>
An invention for producing several natural herbal mixtures for imparting fire resisting properties to normally flammable materials, both living and non living, and also for producing a herbal spray fire extinguisher.<br>
(ii) Conventional fire extinguishers such as various commercial models of Carbon dioxide generating mechanisms (by means of chemical reactions involving certain acids) suffer from several problems and deficiencies such as creating environmental damage due to chemical littering at the spot of extinguishing, heavy weight, difficult to operate and also high cost. These extinguishers based on other mechanisms of gas generation also release CFCs which are known to be damaging the ozone layer. At present there is no mechanism of herbal, biodegradable  non-CFC generating, environment friendly, easy to operate and low cost for fire extinguisher purposes. Also there exist no such herbal fire extinguishers which also impart even limited fire/bum resistance to flammable objects such as paper  cloth, plastic material etc. As a result, once a conventional commercial fire extinguisher is used to extinguish fire, there exists a fresh chance of fire coming up again on the same material on which fire was extinguished and for extinguishing the new fire a new fire extinguisher will be required as the previous one may have been exhausted in putting down the previous fire.<br>
(iii) In the present invention a new herbal biodegradable environment friendly, non CFC generating low cost, easy to use fire extinguisher is being presented. Various herbs/plants (17 varieties as discussed in preliminary specifications) have been investigated with experimental methods to arrive at and identify suitable plant for this purpose. The plant Aloe Vera (English) (Kumara in Sanskrit) has been experimentally confirmed to have fire extinguishing and bum resisting properties. By following the following process of procedure it is possible to construct a herbal biodegradable fire extinguishing liquid which can be used in a spraying device.<br>
(iv) Objective of this invention is to develop and produce a herbal, biodegradable non CFC generating fire extinguisher cum fire/bum resistance provider for flammable objects such as paper, cloth, plastic material etc.<br>
(v) A process for the preparation of a herbal and biodegradable liquid formulation for using as a fire extinguisher and imparter of fire/bum resistance comprising the steps of<br>
a.   collecting the leaves of the plant Aloe Vera and peeling the skin of the leaves in a known manner to obtain the jelly like material<br><br>
b.	the said jelly like material obtained in step (a) is agitated in an agitator to<br>
obtain a homogeneous material<br>
c.	filtering the said homogeneous material in a conventional manner to<br>
obtain the superfine liquid of Aloe Vera<br>
d.	to the said superfine liquid formed in step "C "optionally the adjuvant<br>
such as herein described are added in 1 to 5 : 5 to 1 weight /weight ratio<br>
(vi)      The following stepwise procedure has to be followed to produce this invention in fire extinguisher:<br>
Step 1: The raw leaves of the live plant of Aloe Vera (Kumari in Sanskrit) have to be procured and their skin is to be peeled away.<br>
Step 2: The jelly like material that remains as balance of the leaves (after the skin of the leaves is peeled away) has to be taken in adequate quantities (say in units of 1 kg at a time) and this jelly like substance is required to be liquified by agitating it in a mixer.<br>
Step 3: The liquified jelly like content of the leaves of Aloe Vera need to be filtered in various filtering devices (including cloth filtering) and the superfine liquid so obtained (without any solid or semisolid jelly like substance left out) can be now used for fire extinguishing purpose.<br>
Step 4: The above obtained superfine liquid has to be filled up in any spraying device (e.g. the one used in spraying pesticides in fields). Now the fire extinguisher is ready for use. Upon any flame of fire this liquid can be sprayed and the flame of fire concerned will be immediately put down or instantaneously extinguished. The size of the flame will determine the size of the spraying device and therefore the quantity of liquid spray required to extinguish the fire concerned. (This liquid can be stored and its shelf life is several years).<br>
Step 5: After extinguishing the fire the material concerned (paper, cloth, etc.) will be absorbing the liquid sprayed on it. Therefore additional adequate spraying needs to be performed even after the fire is already extinguished.<br>
Step 6: After such adequate spraying the flammable material will become fire/bum resistant for 20 to 30 minutes following the last spraying (adequately). During this period of 20 to 30 minutes any fresh fire or flame will not be able to bum the concerned material at all. But once the sprayed liquid evaporates completely after about 20-30 minutes duration (depending on the materials absorption characteristics) the material concerned can catch fire if inflamed.<br>
Step 7: For imparting similar fire resistance to human/animal body parts/skin (instead of flammable objects as described in Step 6) the adjuvants as:<br><br>
a)	milky extract from the leaves of the plant Calotraplies Gigentea, or<br>
b)	the transparent liquid extract from stem and roots of the banana plant, or<br>
c)	Til oil or gingelly oil<br>
are to be optionally mixed with the superfine liquid extract of Aloe Vera.<br>
These adjuvants for the purpose as indicated above (in either (a) or (b) or (c)) may be added to superfine liquid extract of Aloe Vera in the ratio 1 to 5 : 5 to 1 or 1 to 3 : 3 to 1 or preferred ratio 1:1.<br>
Experimental details:<br><br>
Sl.No.	Flammable Material	Minimum Duration of continuous<br>
exposure to fiame required to catch fire<br>
or bum<br><br><br>
	Dry	Wet (with water)	Coated (adequate) with Aloe Vera<br>
1	Paper (News Paper)	0.5 sec.	3 sec.	30 sec. or more<br>
2	Cotton cloth (thin cloth)	1.0 sec.	5 sec.	30 sec. or more<br>
3	Plastic Materials (polythene)	0.3 sec	N.A	30 sec. or more<br>
4	Human body parts/skin	1.0 sec	1 Sec.	10 sec. or more<br>
The above are for chemical or combustion  fire, will cause short circuit due to conduction of water put off or extinguish electric fires without acting short circuit (electrical conductivity of Aloe Vera 0.5).	‘or electric fire wetness or water r. Only Aloe Vera solution will as a good conductor or causing liquid has been found to be about<br>
