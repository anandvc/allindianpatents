Description<br>
A transmission mechanism for dual-direction rotation, washing machine and method for creating dual-direction washing, and relevant inner basket and agitator<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates generally to a transmission mechanism suitable to be used in a washing machine, particularly to a transmission mechanism for creating dual-direction rotation. The present invention<br>
'<br>
relates also to a washing machine for creating dual-direction washing. Furthermore, the present invention relates to a washing method in a washing machine, which method can realize dual-directional washing. The present invention relates to an agitator and an inner basket for using in the washing machine.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is well known that washing machines are widely used in domestic and the industrial application. According to the arrangement of the inner<br>
basket in a washing machine, conventional washing machines can be<br><br>
divided  into   two  types:  the  vertical  type  and  the  horizontal  type.<br>
Generally, a vertical type of a washing machine includes an inner basket,<br>
an outer basket, a agitator, a driving system and a control system. In the<br><br>
vertical type of a washing machine, an inner basket is disposed]! vertically in the outer basket, and an agitator is installed on an agitator shaft and is disposed on the bottom of the inner basket. The driving system has an output end and an input end. The agitator shaft is connected to |he output end of the 'driving system. During washing, generally the inner basket does not rotate, while the agitator rotates in two opposite |directions alternately. The agitator agitates the water inside the inner basket to rotate and realize washing. However, it has been found that there are a few defects in such a type of the existing washing machine. During washing,<br><br>
2 <br>
the impact'strength of the water produced by the agitator is-relatively weak, cloths are prone to be tangled and it is quite difficult to increase the ratio of washing to cleanness. In order to overcome the above-mentioned<br><br>
defects, a design of a washing machine with a rotating basket has been developed in the washer's manufacturer, wherein the inner basket is not fixed and is kept in the form of a free float. When the agitator rotates, the inner basket creates a counter-action against the impacting force of the water caused by the rotation of the agitator, so as to make the inner basket to rotate in a opposite direction likely to achieve the "rubbing" effect. However, the rubbing effect obtained by such a arrangement is still not<br>
satisfactory, Because a driving power is not imparted to the inner basket,<br>
i<br>
the rotation capability of the inner basket is quite little, and thib agitator on the only rotates bottom of the inner basket alternately. Thus, the "rubbing" effect obtained by this washing method is not substantially improved, and the problem of tangling cloths can not be solved well. In a horizontal type of a washing machine, two rolling cylinders which rotate in opposite directions are disposed horizontally. They are connected to two driving power sources and rotate in the opposite directions, klthough such a type of a washing machine can realize a better "rubbing" effect, its structure is quite complicated and its cost is higher in manufacture. In order to overcome the defects in the existing washing machine, the present invention provides a transmission mechanism for creating dual-directional rotation suitable to be used in a washing machine. Particularly,<br>
this transmission mechanism is suitable for a washing machine in a<br>
vertical type]<br><br>
It is an mechanism transmission vertical type<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
	.	.<br>
FIG.l shows a transmission mechanism 8 for creating dual-fdirectional<br>
;<br>
rotation suitable to be used in a washing machine in accordance with an<br>
	.	<br>
embodiment  of the  present  invention.  The  transmission  mechanism includes a<br>
substantially cylinder-shaped gearbox 13. The gearbox 13 is<br>
longitudinally provided with shaft holes in the upper and lower end walls<br>
6 <br>
thereof in: a longitudinal direction, respectively. A hollow inner basket shaft 11 extends through the shaft hole arranged in the upper lend wall of the gearbox 13 and is rotatably disposed in the gearbox. The lower end of the hollow inner basket shaft 11 extends downwards through the upper end wall into the gearbox 13. An agitator shaft 10 is concentrically disposed inside the hollow inner basket shaft 11 and can rotate therein. A main drive shaft 20 extends through the shaft hole arranged in the lower end wall of the gearbox 13 and can rotate in the gearbox. The upper end of the main drive shaft 20 is disposed inside the gearbox 13, and the lower end thereof extends downwards and outwards through the lower<br><br>
end wall ot the gearbox 13. Referring to FIGS. 2-6, two pairs of gear axles 16, 29 are symmetrically disposed in the radial direction with respect to the longitudinal axis of the gearbox 13, respectively. Each of pairs of the gear axles 16, 29 is rotatably disposed in axle holes arranged in the upper and lower end wall of the gearbox 13, respectively. As shown in FIGs. 3, 5 and 6, each of the pair of gear axles 16 is provided with a gear part 28 in an inverted cross section, which consists of two integrally formed gears 28,, 282 with different diameters, and each of the pair of gear axles 29 is provided with a gear part 15 thereon, which<br>
Jeach of a pair of gear parts 28 has two gears 28, ajnd 282. In28 and 15<br><br>
includes  three   integrally  formed  gears   15,,   152,   153 with  different'<br>
diameters. Alternatively, these three gears can also have same diameter. In this case, ch of a pair of gear parts 15 has three gears 15;;,, 152, and<br>
153, while<br>
another embodiment of the invention, the pairs of the gear parts'<br>
can be directly formed on the pairs of the corresponding gear axles 16<br>
and 29, respectively (not shown). When the agitator shaft 10 jis inserted<br>
into the inside of the hollow inner basket shaft 11, a gap remains between<br>
the agitator and the inner wall of the inner basket shaft so that the agitator<br>
j	.	i<br>
and the inner basket shaft do not interfere with each other and can be<br>
rotated separately. The lower end of the agitator shaft 10 extends beyond<br>
the lower end of the inner basket shaft 11 and a gear 30 is disposed<br>
thereon. Thje gear 30 meshes with the second gear 152 of each of the pair<br>
of gear parts 15 respectively. The lower end of the inner basket shaft 11 is<br>
also provided with a gear 12, which meshes with the second gear 282 of<br>
7<br><br>
each of the pair of gear parts 28 respectively. When the gears !30 and 12<br>
mesh with the second gears 152 and 282, respectively, the third gear 153 of<br>
each of the pair of gear parts 15 meshes with the first gear 28, !|of each of<br>
the pair of gear parts 28 correspondingly. In an embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the second and third gears 152 and 153 of each of the<br>
pair of gear parts 15 can be formed as a gear having a thickness equal to<br>
or larger than the sum of thickness of gears 30 and 28,. Therefore, they<br>
can  mesh  with the gear 30  and the  gear 28,,  simultaneously  and	<br>
respectively. A gear 24 is installed at the upper end of the main drive<br>
shaft 20 disposed inside the gearbox 13. The gear 24 meshes with the first<br><br>
gear 15, of each of the pair of gear parts 15, respectively. The Slower end<br><br>
of the maijn drive shaft 20 can be connected to a drive powder source<br><br>
which can<br><br>
be a drive power input end.<br><br>
The dual-directional rotation according to the present invention is<br>
achieved by means of the above-described transmission mechanism 8.<br>
	j<br>
Referring FIGs.3 and 7, when a drive power source such as an electrical<br>
motor 9 inputs a drive power via a pulley 7 disposed at the lower end of<br>
the main drive shaft 20, the motor 9 drives the main drive shaft 20 to<br>
rotate for example in a clockwise direction, thus the gear ;24 is also<br>
rotated in a clockwise direction. The rotation of the gear 24 causes each<br>
of the paii]<br>
of gear parts 15 to rotate in a counter-clockwise direction by<br><br>
the gear 30, of each of] rotate in a<br>
means of the corresponding gears 15, thereon respectively. Furthermore,<br>
..<br>
rotates in a clockwise direction via the corresponding gear 152<br>
the pair of gear parts 15, so as to cause the agitator .shaft 10 to<br>
clockwise direction. At the same time when the agitator rotates<br>
in the clockwise direction, with the rotation of the corresponding gears<br>
153 of the pair of gear parts 15 in a counter-clockwise direction, which<br>
meshes with the corresponding first gears 28, of the pair of gear parts 28,<br>
the gear parts 28 rotate in a reverse direction thereto, i.e. in a! clockwise<br>
direction. Then, the gear 12 rotates in a counter-clockwise direction via<br>
corresponding gear 282 of the pair of the gear parts 28, so 'as to cause<br>
I	|<br>
the inner basket shaft ll to rotate in a counter-cfockwise direction. Thus,<br><br>
it can be achieved that the agitator shaft 10 and the inner basket shaft 11 rotate in opposite directions to each other. Naturally, the agitator shaft and<br>
8 <br>
the inner'basket shaft can also rotate to each other in reverse directions opposed 'to above-described rotating directions, which depends on a rotating direction selected when the drive power source is inputted. Similarly, if the drive power from the drive power source drives the main drive shaft 20 to rotate in a counter-clockwise direction, finally a rotation of the agitator shaft 10 in a counter-clockwise direction is achieved, and the inner basket shaft 11 rotates in a clockwise direction.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, an embodiment of a washing machine for a dual-<br>
direction washing including a transmission mechanism 8 for creating dual-directional rotation in accordance with the present invention is shown. The washing machine, which is generally shown by a reference number 1, includes an outer basket 3, an inner basket 4, an agitator 5, and a transmission mechanism 8 as described above. In the washing machine, both the outer basket and the inner basket are barrel-shaped, arid the inner basket is located inside the outer basket. The upper end of the inner basket shaft 11 is fixedly installed on a bottom wall of the inner basket 4, and the upper end of the agitator shaft 10 disposed inside the hollow inner basket shaft 11 extends beyond the upper end of the inner basket shaft and is fixedly installed on the agitator 5. This arrangement realizes that the inner basket 4 and the agitator 5 can rotate in two opposite directions with respect to each other when the inner basket shaft 11 rotates in an opposite direction opposed to the direction in which the agitator shaft 10 rotates. A pulley 7 is installed at the lower end of the main drive shaft 20, and can be connected to a pulley which is arranged in a drive power source, such as an electrical motor 9. Thus, the electrical motor can drive the main drive shaft to rotate. In the transmission mechanism of the washing machine in accordance with the present invention, the inner basket shaft 11, the agitator shaft 10 and the main drive shaft 2p locate at the same axis.I<br>
In a washing machine incorporating a transmission mechanism for creating dual-direction rotation in accordance with the present invention, the dual-direction washing is achieved by means of the transmission mechanism'.; In order to achieve that the inner basket 4 and theiiagitator 5 rotate in two opposite directions with respect to each other during<br><br><br>
9 <br>
washing, the transmission mechanism of the invention is provided with<br>
two drivel power output ends in addition to a drive power input end,<br>
wherein one of the drive power output ends is connected to a agitator 5 to<br>
cause it   p rotate in a first direction, for example in the:! clockwise<br>
direction; while the other of the drive power output ends is connected to<br>
an inner basket 4 to cause it to rotate in a second direction opp'osed to the<br>
first direction, for example in a counter-clockwise direction Thus, the<br>
transmission mechanism of the invention has two drive power output<br>
ends to create driving rotations in two opposite directions. Hereinafter,<br>
operation of the washing machine of the invention is described in more<br>
details.<br>
During washing, the electrical motor 9 drives the main drive shaft 20<br>
and causes it to rotate in a first direction via the pulley 7. The gear 24 of<br>
the main drive shaft 20 makes the first gears 15, of the pair of gear parts1 15 which<br>
mesh with the gear 24, respectively, to rotate in a second<br>
direction, so that the second gears 152 of the pair of gear parlts 15 drive<br>
the gear 30 which mesh with them respectively to rotate in the first<br>
direction. Thus, the agitator shaft 10 follows rotation of the gear 30 and<br>
causes the agitator 5 to rotate in the first direction. At the same time, the<br>
third gears 153 of the pair of gear parts 15 drive the first gears; 28, of the<br>
pair of gear parts 28 which mesh with the gear 24, respectively, to rotate<br>
in the first direction, so that the second gears 282 of the pair of gear parts<br>
28 drive the gear 12 which meshes with them respectively to rotate in the<br>
second direction. Consequently, the inner basket shaft 11 follows rotation<br>
of the gear 12 and causes the inner basket 4 to rotate in the second!		<br>
direction. <br>
A duali-directional washing method in accordance with the present<br>
invention can be realized by the washing machine for a dual-direction<br>
washing in a such manner that an agitator shaft and an inner basket shaft<br>
are connected to output ends of a transmission mechanism, respectively,<br>
and an input end of the transmission mechanism is coupled to a drive<br>
ji power source, for example an electrical motor 9. When the agitator shaft<br>
rotates in a direction, the inner basket shaft is driven to rotate^ in another<br>
direction opposed to the rotation direction of the agitator shaft. In an<br>
10<br><br>
alternative embodiment of the present invention, the 'transmission mechanism can be provided with two output ends and two: input ends, each of the input ends is coupled to the respective one of t|wo different<br>
drive power sources, and two output ends are respectively connected to<br>
	•<br>
an agitator shaft and an inner basket shaft. Thus, a drive ppwer source<br>
drives the agitator shaft, and another drive power source drives the inner<br>
basket shaft.	<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, an embodiment of an agitator 5 inji accordance with the present invention is shown, wherein the agitator is a;|disk-shaped member, and an upward or convex protrusion is formed on the upper surface of the disk-shaped member to make the agitator to), disturb the water stream in an inner basket and to further promote the agitation of the water. In a non-illustrated embodiment, at least one inward protrusion in the radial direction can also be formed on the sidewall of the inner basket.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, another embodiment of an agitator 5 in accordance with the present invention is shown, wherein the jagitator is a barrel-shaped member and its inner bottom surface is a plane. But, an upward or convex protrusion (not shown) is also formed on this bottom surface. Further as shown, an inward protrusion in the radialjjdirection is provided on the inner sidewall of the agitator so as to increase the water area covered by the agitator and to raise the flow rate of the water. Alternatively, the inner sidewall can also be a smooth surface,!<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, still another embodiment of an agitator 5 in accordance with the present invention is shown, wherein the agitator is a<br>
