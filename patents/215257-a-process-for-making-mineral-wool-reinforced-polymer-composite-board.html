				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a process for making mineral wool reinforced polymer composite board using a composition useful for domestic and industrial applications in construction Sector and Furniture/Interior Decoration.<br>
Mineral wool (fibres) are produced by melting rock or steel slag or any other similar material and by centrifuging the molten glassy rocks. These fibres are generally known as Mineral wool. These fibres have thin diameter and available commercially in different forms. These fibres can be used in development of boards / panels/ doors shutters / windows.<br>
Development of new light weight products using mineral fibres with polymers has a potential of substitution of wood in domestic as well as Industrial applications to preserve the wood and protect Forests and Environment. These fibres can replace the carcinogenic asbestos fibres from several applications such as insulations, roofing, partitions, etc. controlling pollution problem created by asbestos fibres. Mineral fibres composites can be used in making boards, panels, table tops, furniture etc. The main problems associated with the development of these composites lies in the physical properties of mineral fibres which are fragile in nature and there fore a little higher pressure than a minimum required will crush the fibres.<br>
Several fibres such as asbestos, glass, aramid, etc. have been used by plastic industry as reinforcement. Addition of fibres in polymers have both technological as well as economical advantages. Among technological advantages, increased modulus, high heat deflection temperature, mechinability, dimensional stability are important. From economical point of<br>
view , these fibres reduce the cost of final product because difference in price of synthetic plastics is very high as compared to mineral fibres.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a composition for making mineral wool reinforced polymer composite.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for making mineral wool reinforced polymer board.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a composite product of mineral wool reinforced polymer composite for making boards, panels, door shutters, windows for domestic and industrial applications.<br>
The composite product consist core of mineral wool, thermosetting binder, with or without coupling agents and facing of fibre reinforced polymer sheet/ laminated sheet/ ply sheet/ metal sheet for making panels, boards shutters and windows. The facing is fixed to the core with suitable adhesive.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a composition for making mineral wool reinforced polymer composite which comprises:<br>
Mineral wool	10 to 90 wt%<br>
Thermosetting polymer	10 to 80 wt%<br>
Coupling agent	0 to 20 wt%<br>
as defined herein.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the thermosetting polymer used may be such as phenol formaldehyde, urea formaldehyde, melamine formaldehyde, polyurethane, Epoxy resin, polyester resin, vinyl esters.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the coupling agent used may be such as silane, titanate, zirconate.<br>
The composition of the present invention for making mineral wool reinforced polymer composite is not a mere admixture but a synertistic mixture having distinct properties which are not a mere aggregation of the properties of the individual ingredients.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for making mineral wool reinforced polymer composite board using a composition comprising mineral wool 10 to 90 wt%, thermosetting polymer 10 to 80 wt%, coupling agent as defined herein 0 to 20 wt%, which comprises impregnating a mineral wool slab 10-90 wt% with coupling agent solution by conventional manner, drying the resultant impregnated slab, impregnating by conventional methods the slab so obtained with thermosetting polymer solution, followed by drying, pressing the dried slab in the pressure range of 1 Kpa to 1 Mpa and a temperature in the range of 60° to 160°C, to obtained a reinforced polymer composite board.<br>
The present invention provides a method of making composite product which consist of core making and laminating a sheet over the core. Mineral wool is reinforced in polymer matrix which acts as binder for developing the core, comprises 10-90 wt% of mineral wool (fibre) in free form or pretreated bonded form. Developed core is laminated by an adhesive to a ply sheet / metal sheet/ laminated sheet/ fibre reinforced polymer sheet to form board, panel / door shutter/ window etc. The polymer used is of thermosetting type.<br>
The above will be explained with the help of the example which however should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example d<br>
'.'••• For making core slab/ board/ sheet of panel/ door shutter/ window. The following material are taken to make the above core.<br>
1.	Mineral wool slab	-    1 part<br>
2.	Thermosetting polymer         -    1 part<br>
phenol formaldehyde<br>
3.	Thining agent	-    2 parts or<br>
methylated spirit	as required<br>
The above mineral wool slab of 50mm thickness was placed in a mould of the required size. The phenol formaldehyde was diluted with methylated spirit to form a polymer solution. This polymer solution was poured over the slab and pressed to squeezout the excess polymer solution.<br>
The soaked slab was then dried under sun and subsequently pressed between tvvo hot plates to reduce the thickness required level and cured at 150°C temperature in the air circulatory oven for 20 minutes. A final thickness of 10mm was achieved.<br>
•<br>
Density was0.58g/cm3.<br>
The light weight, boards, panels/ door shutters, windows are thereafter made by a laminating the core with surfacing materials such as fibre reinforced polymeric sheet/ laminated sheet/ ply sheet- metal sheet with other suitable adhesives.<br>
Boards thus made were tested and the following physical properties which are adequate for making panels, door shutters, windows are mentioned below :<br>
1.	Density'	0.5 to 1.0 gm/cc<br>
2.	Modulus of rupture	11 MPa - 70 MPa<br>
3.	Water absorption	20-22%<br>
4.	Flammability	Fire resistance<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are :<br>
(1)	The panels door shutters windows thus made as per the invention<br>
will protect environment and save the wood.<br>
(2)	Mineral wool reinforced polymer matrix provides a wood<br>
i<br>
substitute and are environment friendly products.<br>
(3)	The mineral wool reinforced polymer composites   would<br>
substitute   wood  in several domestic   and   industrial<br>
applications in construction sector.<br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	A process for making mineral wool reinforced polymer composite<br>
board using a composition comprising mineral wool    10     to     90<br>
wt%,   thermosetting polymer   10 to 80 wt%,   coupling agent as<br>
defined herein     0 to 20 wt%,   which comprises impregnating a<br>
mineral wool slab 10-90 wt%   with coupling agent solution by<br>
conventional  manner,     drying the resultant impregnated  slab,<br>
impregnating by conventional   methods the slab so obtained with<br>
thermosetting polymer solution, followed by drying, pressing the<br>
dried slab in the pressure range of 1   Kpa to  1  Mpa and a<br>
temperature in the range of 60° to 160°C, to obtained a reinforced<br>
polymer composite board.<br>
2.	A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the thermosetting polymer<br>
used is   selected from a group comprising epoxy, polyurethane,<br>
phenolic melamine, polyester resin, phenol formaldehyde, urea<br>
formaldehyde, vinyl esters.<br>
3.	A process as claimed in claims 1 and 2 wherein the coupling agent<br>
used is selected from silane, titanate or zirconate.<br>
4.	A process for making mineral wool reinforced polymer composite<br>
board substantially as herein described with reference to the<br>
