				<td>The present invention relates to process for the treatment of a steel works slag.<br>
The present invention relates in a general manner to treated LD scoriae having the properties of a hydraulic binding material and a process for obtaining such LD scoriae by treatment of steel works slag.<br>
More particularly, the invention relates to a treatment of steel works slag giving treated LD scoriae, the mineralogical composition of which makes them synthetic materials having enhanced performances when used for construction (granulates for concrete or roads, hydraulic binding materials or binding materials with hydraulic potential).<br>
The production of hydraulic products or products with hydraulic potential from raw materials without emission of CO2 encounters difficulties inherent in their unfavourable chemistry and mineralogy for the production of a binding material.<br>
By unfavourable is meant that the product obtained will not be usable on its own or optionally in a mixture with Portland cement because it will not show the resistance required by the standards or because it will generate problems relating to the swelling or destruction of the structures. This is the case for the LD scoriae(scoriae derived from solidified and crushed steel works slag).<br>
The LD scoriae are by-products of the refining of haematite pig iron (smeltings poor in phosphorus) by the process of oxygen insufflation. This is a material rich in iron and lime having a mean mineralogical composition which is located in the set consisting of dicalcium silicates, calcium ferrite and metal oxides and the average chemical composition of the principal compounds of which is the following:<br><br>
-|0 use in cement.<br><br>
The treatment described in this patent consists of adding to the liquid<br>
slag at least one compound capable of forming alumina, of supplying the <br>
   quantity of heat necessary to dissolve the compound in the slag and of<br><br>
subjecting the slag to mixing with oxygen.<br>
15	The quantity of the compound(s) capable of forming alumina added to<br>
the liquid slag is such that the treated slag contains 5 to 25% by weight of<br>
   alumina. I<br>
Although the patent FR-2.546.530 indicates that the slag thus treated       can be used as hydraulic binding material, in particularly for the manufacture of<br>
2)     cement, this treatment does not make it possible to obtain a hydraulic binding material on its own, capable of replacing Portland cement entirely.<br>
It has now been found that it is possible to treat steel works slag so as to<br>
confer  on   it a  mineralogical  composition  lying   in  the  range  of specific<br>
mineralogical  compositions such that the steel  works—stag  thus  treated<br><br>
constitutes a hydraulic binding material on its own, capable of replacing Portland cement entirely.<br>
The subject of the present invention is therefore a process for the treatment of steel works slag leading to treated steel works slag (LD scoriae) having a specific mineralogical composition as a result of which these treated slags constitute hydraulic binding materials on their own.<br>
The subject of the present invention is also treated LD scoriae having a specific mineralogical composition making them suitable for use as hydraulic binding materials on their own.<br>
The process for the treatment of a steel works slag according to the invention comprises:<br>
-	the injection into the liquid slag of gaseous oxygen or a mixture of gases<br>
containing oxygen gas;<br>
-	the addition to the liquid slag and the dissolution in this latter of a source of<br>
alumina and a source of lime and optionally a source of silica and/or iron;<br>
-	the cooling of the slag until the latter solidifies, characterised in that the<br>
quantities of the source of alumina and of lime, and the optional sources of<br>
silica and iron added are such and the rate of cooling is such that the<br>
treated and solidified steel works slag has a mineralogical composition<br>
having one of the following constitutions:<br>
-	(a) an amorphous vitreous phase;<br>
-	(b) a first set of phases (1) constituted, in percentage by weight, of 10-40<br>
CA, 20-50 C2AS, 30-50 C6AF2 and 10-30 C2S;<br>
-	(c) a second set of phases (2) constituted, in percentage by weight, of 20-40<br>
C2F, 10-30 C2AS, 20-50 C6AF2 and 10-40 C2S; and<br>
-	(d) a mixture of an amorphous vitreous phase and the first or second set of<br>
phases.<br>
-	It will be recalled that according to the standard notation of cement makers:<br>
C = CaO A = AI2O3<br>
F = Fe203<br>
P = PO4<br>
The above phases are not pure compounds but may contain in solid solution impurities such as iron, magnesia (MgO), phosphorus (P2O5), sulfur, etc.<br>
The treated LD scoriae according to the invention are characterized by the fact that they possess a mineralogical composition such as defined above.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the steel works slag is<br>
poured into a vat or ladle, the bath of slag is brought to or maintained at a<br>
temperature of 1350°C to 1550°C, preferably 1350°C to 1500°C and usually at<br>
1450°C, subjected in the vat to mixing with oxygen by injection of gaseous<br>
oxygen or of a mixture of gases containing gaseous oxygen, such as a mixture<br>
of air and oxygen by means of, for example, a torch as described in the patent<br>
FR-2.546.530.	<br>
As is known, this injection of oxygen not only ensures the mixing of the<br>
bath of slag but also the oxidation of the iron and the ferrous oxide (FeO)<br>
present in the slag to ferric oxide (Fe2O3). The injection of oxygen can be done<br>
by injecting pure oxygen, air or a mixture of oxygen and air. The injection is<br>
done in general so as to obtain a pressure of oxygen or the mixture of gases in<br>
equilibrium with the bath of slag of 102 to 5.105 Pa, and preferably 105 to 5.105<br>
Pa.<br>
This injection of oxygen or mixture of gases containing gaseous oxygen generally lasts about 30 minutes.<br>
As a function of the chemical composition of the steel works slag to be treated and the desired ultimate use of the treated slag, during the mixing a defined quantity of a source of alumina , for example pure alumina or bauxite, and a defined quantity of a source of lime, for example lime or limestone (calcium carbonate) and, if necessary, defined quantities of a source of silica, for example silica, or a source of iron, for example hematite, are added to and dissolved in the liquid slag.<br>
The additions may be readily made by means of suitable hoppers. In genral the dissolution of the additions to the liquid slag does not require the external supply of heat.<br><br>
In fact, the temperature of molten slag is usually higher than or equal to 1600°C and, since for the treatment, the temperature of the slag is maintained at 1350-1500°C, it is possible to use the heat differential for the dissolution of at least a part of the additions.<br>
Moreover, as is known, the oxidation of iron metal or ferrous iron oxide (FeO) to ferric oxide (Fe2O3) is exothermic and the heat released during this reaction can also be used to dissolve the additives.<br>
Preferably, the adducts are introduced into the ladle before molten liquid slag originating from the converter in order to ensure protection of the heat resistant materials of the ladle.<br>
In general, the quantity of the source of alumina added is such that the proportion of alumina in the treated LD scoria obtained is greater than 25% by weight, preferably of the order of 30% by weight or more and the quantity of the source of lime added is such that the proportion of lime in the treated LD scoria obtained is equal to or higher than 40% by weight.<br>
The treated LD scoriae obtained contain 1% by weight or less and preferably do not contain free lime in a detectable quantity.<br>
In view of the compositions of the steel works slag, the quantities of alumina and lime added usually vary from 700 to 1100 kg and from 400 to 800 kg, respectively, for 1000 kg of treated slag.<br>
After dissolution of the additions, the bath of slag is then cooled at a slow or rapid rate of cooling until the slag solidifies, i.e. usually to a temperature of the order of 1100 to 1200°C, suitable for obtaining one of the mineralogical compositions according to the invention.<br>
With slow cooling, the treated slag has a mineralogical composition which may vary from a composition constituted only of the first set of phases (1) or of the second set of phases (2) to a composition constituted of a mixture of a vitreous phase and the first or second set of phases, preferably of the second set of phases. When the mineralogical composition of the treated slag comprises both a vitreous phase and the first or second set of phases, the —vitreous—phase—may—represent-up-lo ,95%_by_weight of the_sIag treated<br><br>
Preferably, the vitreous phase represents from 5 to 15% by weight and better 5 to 10% by weight of the slag treated.<br>
With rapid cooling, a treated slag constituted entirely of an amorphous vitreous phase is obtained.<br>
In the framework of the present invention, by rapid cooling is meant rates of cooling leading to treated LD scoriae constituted of 100% of a vitreous phase and by slow cooling is meant rates of cooling leading to treated LD scoriae constituted either of a first or second set of phases (1) and (2) or to a mixture of one of these sets with a vitreous phase.<br>
These rates of cooling depend principally on the proportions of Si02 and AI203required for the treated LD scoria.<br>
The table below gives as examples the ranges of rates of cooling to be used as a function of the proportions of SiO2 and AI2O3 required for the treated LD scoria in order to obtain either 100% vitreous phase or 5% by weight or less of vitreous phase.<br>
By using rates of cooling between the two limits, mixtures are obtained containing in variable proportions the sets of phases (1) or (2) and the vitreous phase.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 By using rates of cooling between the rates indicated in the table, mixtures of the set (1) or (2) and the vitreous phase are obtained in variable proportions<br><br>
The cooling may be carried out by any suitable means, such as cooling by air or by water, preferably by air.<br>
This cooling is continued until the slag solidifies, classically at a temperature of 1100-1200°C.<br>
The treated LD scoriae obtained can be crushed to form granulates. These granulates can be used alone as hydraulic binding materials or also be mixed with cements to replace in total or in part the sands classically used.<br>
The following examples illustrate the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
A steel works slag with the following characteristics is treated by the process of the invention:<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br><br>
(C2S/C3P)SS = solid solution of dicalcium silicate and tricalcium phosphate.<br>
The steel works slag in the liquid state run off into a ladle is ground and oxidised at 1350°C by insufflation of oxygen by means of a torch. The oxygen flow rate is regulated in order to obtain an oxygen pressure in equilibrium with the bath of slag of 5.105Pa.<br>
Prior to running off the slag the following additions were introduced into the ladle:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
After dissolution of the additions, the insufflation of oxygen is stopped and the slag is cooled with air at a rate of 5°C/second until the temperature reaches 1100°C.<br>
The treated LD scoria obtained has the following mineralogical composition:<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
The treated scoria obtained is crushed and sieved so as to exhibit the size distribution of a standardised sand. The size distribution is given in the table below:<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
A mortar is prepared under normal conditions with Portland cement (1 part by weight) and a sand constituted half of standardised sand and half of the treated scoria (3 parts by weight). For comparison, a mortar constituted of Portland cement (1 part by weight) and standardised sand (3 parts by weight) was also prepared under standard conditions.<br>
From these mortars, prismatic test pieces 4 cm x 4 cm x 16 cm are formed by puddling with a water/cement ratio (W/C) of 0.5.<br>
The resistances to deformation and compression are determined on the test pieces. The results obtained are shown below:<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
It can be seen that by using a sand constituted of 50% by weight of standardised sand and 50% by weight of scoria treated according to the invention, a significant gain in resistance is obtained.<br>
Some of the test pieces not having been subjected to the mechanical tests were used for the swelling test ASTM C151 and AAHTO T107. The test proved negative (no swelling).<br>
The above tests were repeated by replacing the Portland cement by Fondu cement (cement based on calcium aluminate). The results below show a significant gain in resistance when the scoria treated according to the invention was used.-<br>
 (Table Removed)<br><br><br>
The swelling test ASTMC 151 and AASHTO T107 also proved to be negative.<br>
This example shows that the granulate obtained starting from the treated LD scoria of the invention is better than sand, i.e. a granulate usually used in the formulation of mortars.<br>
Example 2<br>
Different steel works slags with the following characteristics were treated by the process of the invention:<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
The steel works slags in the liquid state, run off in a ladle, are mixed and oxidised as in Example 1 under the conditions indicated below.<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
After dissolution of the additions, the insufflation of air and oxygen is stopped and the slags are cooled under the conditions below: <br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The treated LD scoriae obtained are constituted of 100% of an amorphous vitreous phase.<br>
The scoriae obtained by the treatment are ground at 3500 cm2/g. Mixed with water, the following amounts of heat are released: <br>
(Table Removed)<br><br><br>
The treated scoriae above are used as cement under standardised conditions (W/C = 0.5; prismatic test pieces 4 cm x 4 cm x 16 cm) and the setting time and the resistance to compression (Rc) are determined. The results are given in the table below:<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
The above examples show that the treatment of the invention makes it possible to obtain a treated LD scoria having on its own the characteristics of a hydraulic binding material.<br>
A sand constituted of half standardised sand and half crushed scoria No.2 is added to Portland cement. Starting from this mixture prismatic test pieces are formed under standardised conditions (W/C = 0.5; test pieces 4 cm x 4 cm x 16 cm) and the setting time and the resistance to compression are determined. The results are given below: <br>
(Table Removed)<br><br><br>
Example 3<br>
The steel works slags with the following characteristics are treated by the process of the invention"<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
The steel works slags in the liquid state, run off into a ladle, are mixed and oxidised under the conditions shown below:<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
As in Example 1, the following additives had been introduced into the ladle prior to the run off of the slags:<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
After dissolution of the additives, insufflation is stopped and the slags are cooled under the conditions below:<br>
 (Table Removed)<br><br><br>
The LD scoriae obtained have the following mineralogical compositions: (Table Removed)<br><br><br>
The scoriae obtained by the treatment are ground at 3500 cm2/g. Mixed with water, the following amounts of heat are released:<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br><br>
The treated scoriae above are used as cement under standardised conditions (W/C = 0.5; prismatic test pieces 4 cm x 4 cm x 16 cm) and the setting time and the resistance to compression (Rc) are determined. The results are given in the table below:<br>
 (Table Removed)<br><br><br>
The above tests show that the treated LD scoriae according to the invention having as mineralogical composition the first or second set of phases exhibit on their own properties of a hydraulic binding material.<br>
In all of the examples the resistances to deformation (Rf) and to compression (Rc) were determined according to the standards NF EN 196-1.<br><br><br><br>
