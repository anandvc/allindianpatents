THIA20LE   PYRAZOLOPYRIMIDINES  AS   CRFl   RECEPTOR  ANTAGONISTS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to novel thiazole pyrazolopyrimidine compounds, 5      pharmaceutical compositions thereof, and use thereof as CRFl receptor antagonists in the treatment of psychiatric and neuroendocrine disorders, neurological diseases, and metabolic syndrome.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
10	Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) is a 41 amino acid peptide that is the primary<br>
physiological regulator of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) derived peptide secretion from the anterior pituitary gland. In addition to its endocrine role at the pituitary gland, immunohistochemical localization of CRF has demonstrated that the hormone has a broad extrahypotbalamic distribution in the central nervous system and produces a wide<br>
15      spectrum of autonomic, electrophysiological and behavioral effects consistent with a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator role in the brain. There is also evidence that CRF plays a significant role in integrating the response in the immune system to physiological, psychological, and immunological stressors.<br>
CRF has been implicated in psychiatric disorders and neurological diseases<br>
20     including depression and anxiety, as well as the following: Alzheimer's disease,<br>
Huntington's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, migraine, alcohol and substance abuse and associated withdrawal symptoms, obesity, metabolic syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Cushing's disease, hypertension, stroke, irritable bowel syndrome, stress-induced gastric<br>
25     ulceration, premenstrual syndrome, sexual dysfunction, premature labor, inflammatory disorders, allergies, multiple sclerosis, visceral pain, sleep disorders, pituitary tumors or ectopic pituitary-derived tumors, chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia.<br>
CRF receptor subtypes, CRFl and CRF2, have been identified and are distributed heterogeneously within the brain thereby suggesting potential functional diversity. For<br>
30     example, widely distributed brain CRFl receptors are strongly implicated in emotionality accompanying exposure to environmental stressors. Significantly, CRFl, not CRF2, receptors appear to mediate select angiogenic like behaviors. A more discrete<br><br>
WO 2008/036579<br><br>
PCTAJS2007/078605<br><br>
septal/hypothalmic distribution and the availability of alternative endogenous Iigands suggest a different functional role for the CRF2 receptor. For example, a novel CRF-family neuropeptide with preferential affinity for CRF2 relative to CRFI receptors is reported to suppress appetite without producing the profile of behavioral activation 5      observed with selective CRF1 agonism. in other cases, CRF2 agonism produces similar effects to those reported for CRF1 antagonists or CRF1 gene deletion. For example, while CRF2 agonists have been proposed as antiobesity agents, CRF1 antagonists may be an important treatment for obesity as well.<br>
Certain pyrrolo[2,3-pyrimidines, pyrroio[3,2-tf]pyrimidines, pyrazolo[l,5-<br>
10     a]pyrimidines, ],2,3-triazolo[4,5-blpyridines, and pyrazolori.S-al-l.S.S-triazines, useful as CRF antagonists, are described in WO 94/13676, WO 97/29109, WO 98/08847, and WO 98/03510.<br>
The present invention provides novel thiazole pyrazolopyrimidines useful as CRFI receptor antagonists. In view of the above, it is desirable to discover new<br>
15      efficacious and selective antagonists of CRFI as potentially valuable therapeutic agents for the treatment of psychiatric and neuroendocrine disorders, neurological diseases, and metabolic syndrome. Further, since a majority of commercial CNS and cardiovascular drugs exhibit unfavorable bioavailability and pharmacokinetic profiles, it is also desirable to discover new compounds with favorable bioavailability and pharmacokinetic profiles<br>
20      relative to known CRF antagonists such as CP154526 and NBI30775.<br>

pharmacokinetic profiles relative to some known CRF antagonists (e.g.,<br>
CP154526 and NBI30775), such as Example 15.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are preferably formulated as 25     pharmaceutical compositions administered by a variety of routes. Preferably, such compositions are for oral administration. Such pharmaceutical compositions and processes for preparing same are well known in the art (see, e.g., Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, A. Gennaro, et al., edsâ 19lh ed.. Mack Publishing Co., 1995).<br>
A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention comprising a compound such as herein described, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient showed surprising and enhanced effects. Therefore, the said composition is synergistic in nature.<br>
30	The compounds of Formula 1 are generally effective overawide dosage range.<br>
For example, dosages per day normally fall within the range of about 0.0001 to about 30<br><br>
WO 2008/036579<br><br>
PCTAJS2007/078605<br><br>
mg/kg of body weight. In some instances dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect, and therefore the above dosage range is not intended to limit ihe scope of the invenlion in any way. Jt will be understood thai 5      the amount of the compound actually administered will be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound or compounds administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, and the severity of the patient's symptoms. The compounds of Formula I are CRF-1 antagonists and, as such, are useful for<br>
10      treating a condition which is treatable by reducing CRF1 receptor tone or stimulation. Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), a 41 amino acid peptide that is the primary physiological regulator of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) derived peptide secretion from the anterior pituitary gland [J. Rivicr ct al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci (USA) 80:4851 (1983); W. Vale et al., Science 213:1394 (1981)], has been linked to a number of medical<br>
15      conditions. For example, in addition to its endocrine role at the pituitary gland,<br>
immunohistochemical localization of CRF has demonstrated that the hormone has a broad extrahypothalamic distribution in the central nervous system and produces a wide spectrum of autonomic, electrophysiological and behavioral effects consistent with a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator role in the brain [W. Vale ei al., Rec. Prog. Horm.<br>
20     Res. 39:245 (1983); G. F. Koob, Persp. Behav. Med. 2:39 (1985); E. B. De Souza et al., J. Neurosci. 5:3189 (1985)]. There is also evidence that CRF plays a significant role in integrating the response in the immune system to physiological, psychological, and immunological stressors [see, e.g., J. E. Blalock, Physiological Reviews 69:1 (1989); J. E. Morley, Life Sci. 41:527 (1987)].<br>
25	CRF is involved in psychiatric disorders and neurological diseases including<br>
depression and anxiety [D. M. Nielsen, Life Sci. 78:909-919; H. E. Kunzel et al., J. Psychiatr. Res. 37:525-533; D. R. Gehlert ct al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 509:145-153]. A role for CRF has also been postulated in the etiology and pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and amyotrophic lateral<br>
30     sclerosis, as they relate to the dysfunction of CRF neurons in the central nervous system [for a review, see: E. B. De Souze, Hosp. Practice 23:59 (19&amp;8)]. Chronic administration of CRF has been shown to produce impairment of the dopamine system suggesting a role<br><br>
WO 2008/036579<br><br>
PCT/US2007/078605<br><br>
in Parkinson's disease [E. Izzo et al., Pharmacol Biochem. Behav. 81:701-708 (2005)]. Other neurological disorders in which CRF is involved include epilepsy [T. Z. Baram et al., Brain Res. 770:89-95 (1997)] and migraine [T. C. Theoharides et al., Endocrinology 136:5745-5750 (1995)]. CRF has been implicaled in alcohol and substance abuse and 5      associated withdrawal symptoms [D. H. Overstreet et al., Pharmacol Biochem. Behav. 77:405-413; Y. Shaham ct al., Psychopharmacohgy (Berl) 137:184-190]. Moreover, there is evidence that CRF has a role in various endocrine disorders and cardiovascular diseases such as obesity [E. Timofeeva and D. Richard, Neuroendocrinology 66:327-340 (1997)], metabolic syndrome [A. M. Ward et al., Metabolism 53:720-726(2004)],<br>
10     congenital adrenal hyperplasia [D. P. Merke and G. B. Cutler Jr., Endocrinol. Metab. Clin. North Am. 30:121-135 (2001)], Cushing's disease [M. Labeuret al., Curr. Drug Targets Immune Endocr. Metabol. Disord. 4:335-342 (2004)], hypertension [R. J. Briscoe, ct al., Brain Res. 881:204-207 (2000)], and stroke [S. L. Stevens et al., J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 23:1151-1159(2003)]. Gastric disturbances such as irritable bowel<br>
15      syndrome [Y. Tacheet a\.,EurJ. Surg. Suppl: 16-22 (2002)] and stress-induced gastric ulceration [K. E. Gabry et al., Mol Psychiat&gt;y 7:474-483, 433 (2002)] have been shown to be related to CRF. In addition, there is indication that CRF has a role in various areas of human female health, for example, premenstrual syndrome [F. Facchinetti et al., Psychosom. Med. 56:418-422 (1994)], infertility [L. Ghizzoni et al., Endocrinology<br>
20      138:4806-4811 (1997)], sexual dysfunction [ J. E. Jones et al., Am. J. Physiol Regul<br>
Jntegr. Comp. Physiol. 283:R591-597 (2002)], and premature labor [P. D. Wadhwa et al., Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol 191:1063-1069 (2004)]. There is also evidence that CRF has a significant role in the immune system indicating therapeutic potential for treating inflammatory disorders [A. Gravanis and A. N. Margioris, Curr. Med. Chem. 12:1503-<br>
25       1512 (2005)], allergies [L. K. Singh et. al., Brain Behav. Immun. 13:225-239 (1999)], multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune disorders [C. Benou et al., J. Immunol. 174:5407-5413 (2005)]. In addition to the preceding, CRF has been implicated in visceral pain [M. Nijsen et al., Neurogastroenterol Motil \l-A11-4yi (2005)], sleep disorders [T. M. Buckley and A. F. Schatzbcrg, J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 90:3106-<br>
30     3114(2005)], pituitary tumors or ectopic pituitary-derived tumors [K. D. Dieterich et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 83:3327-3331 (1998)], chronic fatigue syndrome and<br><br>
WO 2008/036579<br><br>
PCT/US2 007/078605<br><br>
fibromyalgia [G. Neeck and L. J. Crofford, Rheum. Dis. Clin. North Am. 26:989-1002 (2000)).<br>
CRF receptor subtypes, CRFI and CRF2^ have been identified and are distributed helerogeneously within the brain [D. T. Chalmers et al, TIPS 17:166-72 (1996)] thereby 5      suggesting potential functional diversity [S. C. Heinnchs et ai., Regul. Peptides 71:15 (1997)]. For example, widely distributed brain CRF1 receptors are strongly implicated in emotionality accompanying exposure to environmental stressors [G. Liebsch et al., Regul. Peptides 59: 229-39 (1995); D. W. Schulz, PNAS 93: 10477-82 (1996)]. Significantly, CRF 1, not CRF2, receptors appear to mediate select anxiogenic like behaviors [Heinnchs<br>
10     et al., 1997}- A more discrete septal/hypothalmic distribution [D. T. Chalmers et al., J. Neurosci. 15(10): 6340-50 (1995)] and the availability of alternative endogenous ligands [J. Vaughan et al., Nature 378:287-92 (1995)] suggest a different functional role for the CRF2 receptor [Heinnchs et al., 1997]. For example, a novel CRF-family neuropeptide with preferential affinity for CRF2 relative to CRF1 receptors is reported to suppress<br>
15      appetite without producing the profile of behavioral activation observed with selective CRF1 agoiiism (H. Tezval et alâ PNAS 101(25): 9468-9473 (2004)]. In some cases, CRF2 agonism produces similar effects to those reported for CRF 1 antagonists or CRF1 gene deletion [S. C. Hcinrichs, Trends in Pharmacological Sciences 20{8):3l 1-5 (1999)]. For example, while CRF2 agonists have been proposed as antiobesity agents, CRF 1<br>
20     antagonists may be an important treatment for obesity as well [C. Contoreggi et al., Neuroendocrinohgy 80(2): 111-23 (2004)]-<br>

In Scheme 1, Step 1, the pyrazolo[l ,5-a]pyrimidine-7-one of formula (1) is convened to 7-chloro-2,5-dimethyl- pyrazolo[I,5-a]pyriiriidme using phosphorous 5      oxychloride and dimethylaniline in an inert solvent, such as toluene, at ihe reflux temperature of the solvent.<br>
In Step 2, a Grignard reagent of formula (-3) (X = CI or Br) is reacted with the chloride of formula (2), in an inert solvent such as toluene, at reflux temperature to provide the 7-aIkyl pyrazolopyrimidine of formula (4).<br>
10	Alternatively, a 7-alkyl pyrazolopyrimidine of formula (4) can be obtained as<br>
shown in Steps 3,4, and 5. In Step 3 ethyl acetoacetatc is acylated with an acid halide of formula (4a) in ihe presence of magnesium chloride to provide a diketo-ester of formula (4b). The diketo-cstcr of formula (4b) is decarboxylated under Krapcho conditions to provide the diketone of formula (4c). For example, (4b) is heated in dimethyl sulfoxide at<br>
15      a temperature of about 130 to 170 Â°C to pcrformme decarboxylation. In Step 5, the diketone of formula (4c) is cyclizcd with 3-amino-5-metbylpyrazole to give the 7-alkyl pyrazolopyrimidine of formula (4) in a protic solvent such as methanol, cthanol, or acetic acid. Preferred conditions use acetic acid at a temperature of about 0 to 60 Â°C. The pyrazolopyrimidine of formula (4) is function a lized to an iodo<br>
20      pyrazolopyrimidine of formula (5) in Step 6 using an excess of N-iodosuccinimide in acetonitrile.<br>
In Scheme 1, Step 7 or 8, the iodo pyrazolopyrimidine of formula (5) is reacted wiih a thiazotc zinc halide in al-Jegishi cross-coupling reaction to provide a thiazolvl pyrazolopyrimidine of formula (6a) or (6b) (Jensen, J.; Skjacrbaek, N.; Vcdso, P.<br>
25      Synthesis 2001, 128). The thiazole zinc halide is generated using methods well known to those skilled in the art. For example, in Slep 7, 2-trimelliylsilanyithiazole is treated with n-, sec-, or te/7-butyl lithium, followed by lithium-zinc exchange with ZnClj. The organozinc reagent is coupled with the iodo pyrazolopyrimidine of formula (5) in the presence of a palladium catalyse for example, dichloro[I,r-bis(diphcnyl-<br>
30 phosphino)ferrocene]palladium (IT) dichloromeihane, in an inert solvent, such as THF, at reflux temperature for about 12 to 36 hours, to provide a thiazole pyrazolopyrimidine of formula (6a).<br><br>

Altcrnaiivcly, in Slep 8, a thiazole zinc bromide is generated using 5-bromo-4-mcthylthiazole and zinc metal, and used in the Negishi cross-coupling essentially as described for Step 7, to provide a thiazole pyrazolopyrimidine of formula (6b).<br>
In Scheme \, Step 9, a thiazole of formula (6a,b) is brominated to give a bromo or 5      dibromo thiazole of formula (7), wherein R3b = Br or CH3. The thiazole is brominated with either 1 or 2 eq of N-bromosuccinimide, depending on whether RSa is CH3 or H, respectively.<br>
An alkyl thiazole of formula (8a-c) is obtained from either a thiazole of formula (6a,b) in Step ]l,orfromabromothiazoleofformula(7) in Step 10. In Step 10, halogen-<br>
10     lithium exchange with n-, sec-, or /-butyl lithium provides a thiazole lithium reagent, which is subsequently reacted with electrophiles, such as alkylhalides, like iodomethyi methylether or iodobutane. In Step 11, the thiazole lithium reagent is formed via dcprotonation using n.-, sec-, or ier/-butyl lithium and then subsequently reacted with an electrophile, like iodomethyi methylether or iodobutane.<br>
15	It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that the thiazole ring system is<br>
readily funationalized and that thiazole intermediates such as 2-trimethylsiIanyl-thiazole (Dondoni, A.; et. al. J. Org. Chem. 1988, 53, 1748) can be readily prepared. 5-Bromo-4-mcthylthiazolc is obtained by bromination of 4-mcthyhhiazole with bromine in acetic acid (Collins, I. J., et. al. W02003093252,13 Nov 2003). 2,5-Dimethyl-4//-<br>
20     pyrazolo[l,5-a]pyrirnidine-7-one (1) is readily prepared by condensation of ethyl acetoacetate and 5-meihyl-2H-pyrazol-3-ylamine in refluxing acetic acid.<br>

In Step 1, a bromothiazole of formula (7) is coupled with a heterocyclic zinc reagent in a Negishi cross-coupling reaction to provide a thiazole heterocycle of formula (9). For example, 1-methyl-1,2,4-triazoIe is treated with n~, sec-, or/er/-butyI lithium, followed by zinc chloride, at about -80 to -65 Â°C, and reacted in situ with a bromothiazole 10      of formula (7). The reaction is performed preferentially in an inert solvent, such as THF, in the presence of a palladium catalyst, such as dichloro[lJ*-bis(diphenyI-phosphino)fejrocene]palladium (II) dichloromethane or<br>
tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (0). The reaction is warmed to reflux temperature. Alternatively, the heterocyclic zinc reagent is formed from a haloheterocycie, such as 4-15     iodopyridine and zinc metal.<br>
In Scheme 2, Step 2, an intermediate 2-formyl thiazole is formed via halogen-lithium exchange usingn-, sec-, or r-butyl lithium followed by reaction with N-formyl morpholine.

In Step 3, a bromothiazole of formula (7) undergoes a displacement reaction with an amine of formula-NR"Rb or with morpholine to provide an aminolhiazole of formula (11).

It will be recognized by one skilled in the art that a 4-bromothiazole, such as thai 15      of formula (12) is readily manipulated to other functionality. For example, in Step 1, die bromide can be dehalogenated with cuprous chloride to give a thiazole of formula (13) which is subsequently chlorinated with N-chlorosuccinimide to provide a 4-chloroihiazole of formula (14).<br>
In Scheme 3, Step 3, a 4-bromothiazole of formula (12) is displaced with sodium 20      methoxide in the presence of copper (1) iodide in methanol at about 100 to 120 Â°C in an<br><br>

The dimethylpyrrole is treated with hydroxylamine in acetic acid at a temperature of about 60 to 100 Â°C, for about 4 to 8 h, preferably for about 6 h. In Step 3, to form the thiazole acetamiUe of formula (18), the same conditions are<br>
10     used as in Step 2, with the exception that the reaction is continued for about 72 h. In Scheme 4, Step 4, a 2-aminothiazole of formula (19) is converted to a 2-bromothiazole of formula (20) using a modified Sandmeyer reaction. Preferred conditions use an alkylnitrile, such as r-butylnitritc, and copper (II) bromide, in acetonitrile at a temperature of about 60 to 80 Â°C.<br>
15	In Step 5, a 2-bromothiazole of formula (20) undergoes a displacement reaction<br>
with an amine of formula ~NRÂ°Rb or with morpholine to provide an aminothiazole of formula (21). The reaction is performed in an inert solvent, such as methanol, THF, or dioxane, or is trealed neat, with an excess of the amine at a temperature of about 70 to 110 Â°C. Alternatively the reaction is performed with the reacting amine and an excess of<br>
20      triethylamine, or an inorganic base, such as cesium carbonate. Also contemplated in the synthesis of aminoihiazoles of formula (21) are various deprotection steps, such as removal of a /^r/-butyl ester carbamic acid (BOC), as may be required or beneficial for carrying out the reactions above wherein -NR3R carries additional amine functionality as defined for formula 1. The selection and use of suitable protecting groups is well known<br>
25      and appreciated in the art (see for example, Proieciing Groups in Organic Synthesis, Theodora Greene (Wiley-Interscience)).<br>
In Scheme 4, Step 6, a 2-bromothiazole of formula (20) is coupled with a heterocyclic zinc reagent in a Negishi cross-coupling reaction to provide a thlazole heterocyele of formula (20a) in a manner similar to that as described for Scheme 2, Step<br>

For example, 2,4-dichlorothiazole can be reacted with morpholine to give the 2-morpholino-thiazole of formula (22).   2,4-Dichlorothiazole can also be exhaustively brominated to provide 2,5-<br>
20      dibromo-4-chloTOthiazole. Subsequent bromine-lithium exchange with n-butyl lithium in THF at -90 Â°C and quench with water provides 2-bromo-4-chlorothiazole [J. Chem. Soc.

The limitations of plasmid-based human CRF1 expression, in terms of generating a recombinant cell line with sufficient receptor density to develop a binding assay, are overcome by using a Phoenix retroviral expression system licensed from Stanford. The stable HEK-hCRFl cell line is used to prepare membranes and binding reactions (200 pL)<br>
10     are set up as follows: 50 pX of'"i-sauvagine (0.2 nM final), 50 uX compound and 100 uX CRFJ membrane (25 pg/reaction). The reactions are incubated at room temperature for 2 h and then terminated by filtration through pre-treated FB Millipore glass fiber filter plates (96 well). The plates arc washed twice with ice-cold assay buffer (50 mM tris, 12.5 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM MgCh, 0.05% BSA, pH 7.2), air dried over night<br>
15      and counted with 100 uL Microscint 40 in a MicroBeta counter. Non-specific binding (NSB) is determined in the presence of 0.5 uM non-labeled sauvagine. Triplicate determinations are typically run and the median data points plotted by Graph Pad Prism. Using this assay, the exemplified compounds of the present invention inhibit the binding of ,iSI-Sauvagine (4 nM) in roller/adherent cells with a Ki (inhibition constant)<br>

Non-specific binding (NSB) is determined in the presence of 0.5 pM non-labeled<br>
sauvagine. Alternatively, compounds are evaluated using a Scintillation Proximity assay.<br>
This assay is set up as follows: 50 pL of I2SI-Sauvagine (0.2 nM final concentration), 50 5      pL compound or non-labelled sauvagine (NSB) and 100 pL containing 250 pg wheat<br>
germ agglutinin (WGA) SPA beads and CRF2 membrane (1.5 pg/reaction). Plates are - -incubated for 4-5 h at roonvtemperature and then centrifuged at 200 X g for 10 min.<br>
Bound radioactivity is assessed using a Wallac Trilux scintillation counter. Binding is<br>
assessed typically using triplicate determinations and the median data points plotted by 10     Graph Pad Prism. Compounds are initially screened at a fixed concentration and, if<br>
sufficient activity is noted, subsequent concentration-response curves are generated.<br>
Particular exemplified compounds of the present invention are tested in the CRP2<br>
binding assay and exhibit weak affinity for the CRF2 receptor. For example, Example 15<br>
exhibits 11% inhibition at a concentration of 50 pM. This result suggests that the 15      compounds of the present invention are selective for the CRF1 receptor, (relative to<br>
CRF2).<br>

Bioavailability and Pharmacokinetic Properties<br>
20	The volume of distribution (Vdist) relates the amount of the drug in the body to<br>
the concentration of the drug in the blood or plasma. The volume of distribution refers to the fluid volume that would be required to contain the total amount of the drug in the body a! the same concentration as in the blood or plasma: Vdist - amount of drug in the body/ concentration of drug in blood or plasma (Goodman and Gillman's). For a 10 mg 25      dose and a plasma concentration of 10 mg/L, the volume of distribution would be 1 liter. The volume of distribution reflects the extent to which the drug is present in the extravascular tissue. A large volume of distribution reflects the tendency of a compound to bind to the tissue components compared with plasma protein binding. In a clinical setting, Vdist can be used to determine a loading dose to achieve a steady state 30     concentration.<br>
To test for volume of distribution, Male Sprague Dawlcy rats (N=3) arc administered a single 1 mg/kg intravenous dose of compound. Multiple plasma samples<br><br>
WO 2008/036579<br><br>
PCT/US2007/078605<br><br>
are collected at time points from 0.08 to 24 hours post-dose. The plasma samples are<br>
analyzed by LC/MS/MS to determine the plasma concentrations. Plasma<br>
pharmacokinetic calculations are performed to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters<br>
including Vdist and plasma clearance (Clp).<br>
5	Compounds of the present invention preferably have favorable bioavailability<br>
profiles. For example, a majority of commercial CNS and cardiovascular drugs exhibit a human Vdist of 
10     L/Kg, respectively, when analyzed separately. Example 15 of the present invention, when analyzed separately, exhibits a rat Vdist of only 7.2 L/Kg following a single intravenous dose of I mg/kg.<br>
Further, the plasma clearance (CLp) is a measure of the rale of removal of the drug from the body. Following an intravenous dose and first-order kinetics, the plasma<br>
15      clearance may be determined using the following equation: CLp = Dose/ AUC, where AUC is the total area under the curve that describes the concentration of the drug in the plasma as a funciion of time from zero to infinity. Reference CRF antagonists CP154526 and NBI37582 exhibit rat clearance (CLp) of 83 and 306 mL/min/kg, respectively, when analyzed separately, following a single intravenous dose, while Example 15 of the present<br>
20      invention, when analyzed separately, exhibits a rat CLp of only 23.6 mL/min/kg.<br><br>
