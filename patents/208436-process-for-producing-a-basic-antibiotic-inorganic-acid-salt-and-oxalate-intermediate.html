COMPLETE SPECIFICATION [See Section 10; Rule 13]<br>
"PROCESS FOR PRODUCING A BASIC ANTIBIOTIC-INORGANIC ACID SALT,<br>
AND OXALATE INTERMEDIATE"<br>
EISAI R&amp;D MANAGEMENT CO.,  LTD.,  of 6-10, Koishikawa 4-chome, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
Description Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel and<br>
industrially-excellent process for producing a basic<br>
antibiotic inorganic acid salt, for example, an<br>
industrially-excellent production process for producing an<br>
inorganic acid salt of an excellent antimicrobial agent having<br>
strong antimicrobial action on gram-positive bacteria and<br>
gram-negative bacteria, disclosed in JP-A 8-73462. More<br>
specifically, it relates to industrially-excellent production<br>
process for producing, for example, (1R,5S,6S) - 6 - [(R) -1 -<br>
hydroxyethyl]-1-methyl-2-{(2S,4S)-2-[(3R)-pyrrolidine-3-yl-<br>
(R)-hydroxy]methyl}pyrrolidine-4-ylthio]-1-carbapen-2-em-3 -<br>
carboxylic acid'hydrochloride, a novel oxalate useful as a production intermediate, and a process for producing it.<br>
Prior Art<br>
In order to produce a basic antibioticinorganic acid salt, it is general to produce a free form, purify by column chromatography etc., and react the product with an inorganic acid.<br>
For example, in the process disclosed in JP-A 8-73462,<br><br><br>
WO96/01261 or Example 9 of EP-A 773222 as a process for producing (1R, 5S, 6S) -6- [ (R) -1-hydroxyethyl] -l-methyl-2- { (2S,"4S) -2-[ (3R)-pyrrolidine-3-yl - (R)-hydroxy]methyl}pyrrolidine-4 -<br>
ylthio] -1- carbapen- 2 - em- 3 - carboxylic acid "hydrochloride etc . , the objective product is obtained by subjecting a p-nitrobenzyl ester compound to catalytic reduction, purifying by reversed-phase silica gel_chromatography, conversing the product to a hydrochloride, and subjecting it to freeze-drying.<br>
In the above-mentioned process in the prior art, the purification by chromatography is performed.  Thus, a solvent is used in a large amount.  Therefore, costs for the production rise to a considerable degree.  Additionally, many problems as follows arise: difficulty in industrial processing in large amount, the possibility of the generation of thermal cruelty (thermal decomposition) at the time of concentrating fractions, a problem of the remaining of the solvent in the final product, a problem about disposal of waste liquid and environment pollution by transpiration of the solvent.  Thus, it cannot be said that the process is a process suitable for industry.<br>
Moreover, it is necessary to perform subtle adjustment of pH when the free form is produced (neutralized) or converted to the hydrochloride. Thus, the process requires much labor and cost in industrial production. Moreover, freeze-drying is required in the last step, and results additional problems as follows: a further rise in the production costs, unsuitability thereof for processing in large amount and necessity of much<br><br>
time.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Thus, the present inventors made eager investigations to pursue a novel production process excellent in viewpoints such as production costs, operability (workability, safety and non- toxicity) , the purity of final products, and the protection of the environment.<br>

Next, the basic antibiotic"oxalate (II) according to the present invention is a starting material for producing the<br>
above-mentioned basic antibiotic•inorganic acid salt (I) by salt-exchange, and specific examples thereof include an oxalate of the above-mentioned basic antibiotic.<br>

Preferred are alkali earth metal halide (IV) and alkali earth metal sulfides (V).<br><br><br>
More specific examples of the alkali earth metal halides (IV) include beryllium fluoride, magnesium fluoride, calcium fluoride, strontium fluoride, barium fluoride, beryllium chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, strontium chloride, barium chloride, beryllium bromide, magnesium bromide, calcium bromide, strontium bromide, barium bromide, beryllium iodide, magnesium iodide, calcium iodide, strontium iodide, barium iodide etc.<br>

Examples of the alkali earth metal sulfates (V) include beryllium sulfate, magnesium sulfate and calcium sulfate.<br>
The following will describe the process for producing the compound of the present invention in more detail. (See the following chemical reaction formula, wherein the ring A means a basic antibiotic; R1C means a protected functional group used in organic synthesis; Ak-E means an alkali earth metal; and B means an inorganic acid.)<br><br><br>
The present step is a step of conducting deprotection<br>
reaction in the case that a basic antibiotic'oxalate has a protected functional group in the molecule thereof.<br>
The protected function group herein means a group obtained by protecting a functional group such as a hydroxyl group, an amino group or a carboxyl group and used in organic synthesis. The deprotection reaction can be conducted in an ordinary manner such as hydrolysis or reduction. (2)   Step 2<br>
The present step is a step of subjecting the basic antibiotic'oxalate (II) to salt-exchange with an alkali earth metal salt (III) of an inorganic acid, to give the target basic antibiotic'inorganic acid salt (I).<br>
Herein, the amount of the alkali earth metal salt (III) of the inorganic acid used is not limited and is usually from 0.7 to 2.0 equivalents, preferably from 0.8 to 1.5 equivalent, and more preferably from 0.9 to 1.3 equivalent.<br>
Herein, the solvent used is not limited.  Specific examples thereof include water, lower alcohols, ketone solvents, ester solvents, ether solvents, formamide solvents and dimethylsulfoxide.  These may be used alone or in the form of a mixture thereof.  Among these, water and lower alcohols are preferred.<br>
The manner of carrying out (operating) the salt-exchange is not limited.  Usually, a solution wherein a necessary amount<br><br><br>
of the alkali earth metal salt (III) of the inorganic acid is dissolved is dropwise added to a solution of the basic antibioticoxalate (II).<br>
Herein, a solvent wherein an alkali earth metal'oxalate which is by-produced by the salt-exchange is insoluble is selected at this time, the alkali earth metal"oxalate is precipitated and can easily be by filtration.  Therefore, this case is more suitable for industry.<br>
The target basic antibiotic•inorganic acid salt (I) is in a solution state at this stage.  Accordingly, extracting operation is necessary.  However, by concentration of the solvent or addition of a poor solvent (solvent having low solubility), it can easily be precipitated as crystal.<br>
In the case of concentrating the solvent, it may be completely dried.  It is however allowable to concentrate it partially into a small-amount solution, cool the resultant solution or cause the resultant solution to stand still, thereby precipitating the target crystals.<br>
In the case of using the poor solvent, the kind thereof is not limited. In general, methanol, n-propanol, isopropanol etc. are preferred.<br>
In the present invention, the step 2 may be performed after the step 1 is performed to isolate and/or purify the basic antibiotic'oxalate (II) .  However, the steps 1 and 2 may be continuously performed by the so-called one-spot reaction. In this case, the deprotection reaction solution can be<br><br>
used, as it is, for the salt-exchange. As a result, column chromatography, pH adjustment and freeze-drying become unnecessary. Therefore, this case is excellent in industrial operability, reduction in production costs, processing in large amount and environment protection.<br>

is a novel compound and is useful for a production intermediate.<br>
Herein, the oxalate (II-I) of the carbapenem compound according to the present invention is represented by the following formula.<br><br>

with other than R6; R1 represents hydrogen or methyl group; R2 and R5 are the same as or different from each other and each represents hydrogen or a hydroxyl-protecting group; R3 represents a carboxyl-protecting group; R4 represents hydrogen, a lower alkyl group or an amino-protecting group; R6 represents (1) hydrogen, (2) an optionally protected hydroxyl group, carbamoyl, formimidoyl, acetoimidoyl or a lower alkyl group which may be substituted with a substituent represented by the formula:<br>
(wherein R7 and R8 are the same as or different from each other and each represents hydrogen, a lower alkyl group or an amino-protecting group) or (3) an amino-protecting group or an imono-protecting group; and m is 0 or 1.<br>

The present step can be conducted in a conventional way for conversion to oxalates.  Usually, 0.7 to 2.0 equivalents<br><br><br>
