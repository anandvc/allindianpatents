AIR KNIFE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0001]       This invention pertains generally to a fluid discharge apparatus, and more particularly to an apparatus for producing an air curtain.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002]       Devices that produce a curtain of air such as air knives are used in a variety of different applications for cleaning and drying purposes. For example, an air knife can be used to blow dirt and other debris off objects such as parts, sheets or webs including conveyors. An air knife can also be used to help cool or dry such objects.<br>
[0003]       To optimize performance, the air curtain preferably forms a knife-edge as it hits the objects being cleaned or dried. This maximizes the force per unit area produced by the air curtain. The velocity of the discharging air and the thickness of the air curtain are two key factors involved in producing a good knife-edge.<br>
[0004]       Unfortunately, many existing air knives produce air curtains that have a great deal of turbulence. This turbulence reduces the velocity of the air curtain and also can cause the air to fan out as it exits the air knife leading to a relatively wider air curtain. The decreased velocity and increased width reduce the impact of the air curtain adversely affecting the performance and effectiveness of the air knife.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]       The present invention provides a fluid discharge apparatus for producing a curtain of air. The apparatus comprises a body member having an air inlet chamber and an air outlet chamber. The air outlet chamber is in fluid communication with the air inlet chamber. The body member defines a discharge orifice through which fluid is discharged from the body member with the discharge orifice being in fluid communication with the air outlet chamber. The air outlet chamber has a pair of opposing sidewalls with each of the sidewalls having an angled sidewall portion. The angled sidewall portions are arranged to converge towards each other as the angled sidewall portions extend in a downstream direction towards the discharge orifice so as<br><br>
to define a generally V-shaped lead-in section that guides and directs fluid towards the discharge orifice. The discharge orifice is defined by first and second edges with the first edge being defined by an extended wall portion that extends downstream past the second edge so as to define a deflection surface for the discharging fluid that extends past the discharge orifice.<br>

[0015]       FIG. 10 is a side sectional view of the blade portion of the air knife of FIG. 1 taken in the plane of line 10-10 in FIG. 8.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0016]       Referring now more particularly to the drawings, FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate an exemplary air knife 10 constructed in accordance with the present invention. The illustrated air knife 10 produces a thin curtain of air that can be used, for example, to clean, cool or dry objects. The air knife 10 can also be used in other applications and the present invention should not be limited to any particular application. In addition, while the present invention is described in connection with producing an air curtain, it will be understood that the air knife of the present invention can be used to discharge other fluids as well.<br><br>
[0017]       Tn the illustrated embodiment the air knife 10 generally includes a base portion 12, a blade portion 14 and an intermediate shim (not shown). The base and blade portions 12, 14 can be made of any suitable material that can be machined or formed in the desired shape such as, for example, stainless steel or aluminum. As best shown in FIGS. 4-6, the base portion 12 includes an elongate cylindrical bore that defines a first air inlet chamber 18. The base portion 12 further includes a first channel 20, which is formed in an inner mating face of the base portion. A plurality of longitudinally spaced slots 22 (see FIG. 3) extend between the air inlet chamber 18 and the channel 20 so as to define multiple passageways communicating between the air inlet chamber and the channel.<br>
[0018]       As shown in FIGS. 8-10, a corresponding second channel 24 is formed in an inside mating face of the blade portion 14. When the base and blade portions 12, 14 are assembled together as shown in FIG. 2, the channels 20,24 in the faces of the two portions align so as to define an air outlet chamber 26. The air outlet chamber 26 communicates with an elongate discharge orifice 28 through which air is discharged from the air knife. The discharge orifice 28 of the air knife is defined by outer edges of the base and blade portions 12, 14, which are spaced apart by virtue of the shim arranged between the blade and base portions. [0019]       In accordance with one important aspect of the present invention, the air outlet chamber 26 and the discharge orifice 28 are configured so as to minimize the amount of turbulence in the air discharging through the discharge orifice: This ensures that the curtain formed by the discharging air forms a knife-edge that produces an optimal force per unit area. To this end, as best shown in FIG. 2, the sidewalls 27 of the air outlet chamber 26 angle towards each other as they extend towards the discharge orifice 28. In particular, each of the sidewalls 27 of the air outlet chamber 26 has an angled portion 29 at the end of the respective sidewall closest the discharge orifice 28. Each of the angled portions 29 has a planar configuration and the two angled portions 29 converge with each other as they extend towards the discharge orifice 28 such that the angled portions form a V-shaped lead-in section that guides and directs the air towards the discharge orifice 28. In the illustrated embodiment, the angled portion 29 of each of the sidewalls 27 extends at an angle of approximately 45° relative to the remainder of the respective sidewall. The angled portions 29 of the sidewalls 27 preferably extend at an angle of between approximately 40° and approximately 50°.<br><br>
(0020]        To further smooth and direct the flow of discharging air thereby reducing turbulence, the outer edge of the blade portion 14 includes an extended flat portion 30 that continues downstream from the angled lead-in portion 29 of the outlet chamber 26 defined by the blade portion as shown in FIG. 2. The extended flat portion 30 extends beyond the relatively sharper outer edge of the base portion 12 at the downstream end of the angled lead-in portion 29 of the outlet chamber 26 defined by the base portion 12. Thus, the extended flat portion 30 overhangs or extends past the discharge orifice 28 and defines a deflection surface for the discharging air. More specifically, as air is discharged through the discharge orifice 28, the extended flat portion 30 deflects the discharging air and directs it into a sharper, more uniform curtain. Because of this extended flat portion 30 on the blade portion 12, when the base, blade and shim portions 12, 14, 16 are assembled together, the outer surface 32 of the blade portion 14 extends beyond the outer surface 34 of the base portion 12. Thus, the front face 36 of the assembly has an uneven configuration as shown in FIG. 2. According to one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the length of the extended flat portion 30 is approximately 0.2126 cm.
