HIGH-PERFORMANCE CHAMBER MiXER FOR CATALYTIC OIL<br>
SUSPENSIONS AS A REACTOR FOR THE DEPOLYMERISATION AND<br>
POLYMERISATION OF HYDROCARBON CONTAINING RESIDUAL<br>
SUBSTANCES TO MIDDLE DISTILLATE IN THE CYCLE<br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing Diesel oil from hydrocarbon containing residua! substances in an oil cycle with solid deposition and product distillation for the Diesel product<br>
!n the previously mentioned patent specification, the components of the Input and output are dealt with only in general manner. The goal of the supplementary application is to precisely describe these components and to explain them in an embodiment. These precisions become possible since the high-performance chamber mixer is able to produce a high negative pressure, and thus all of the input problems can be solved based thereon. An embodiment of the present invention is described in more detail below by way of the drawings. There show:<br>
Figure 1 a schematic representation of a plant for performing the method according to the invention;<br>
Figure 2 a schematic representation of the plant of figure 1.<br>
By v/ay of figure 1, first, the method is explained. For the purpose of a clogging-free input, on the suction side of a high-performance chamber mixer 1, an input container 2 having three input openings is disposed. At the upper end of the input container 2 there is the first input opening, the residual substance input 4, which adjoins the input container 2 through an input system 3 acting in crushing and metering manner.<br>
The substances to be input, residua! substance dry 5, residual oil from the plant or as a residual substance 6, lime or soda as a neutralising agent 7 and the catalyst 8 in the mixing hopper 9, enter this input system 3 through the hopper 9 and the<br><br>
collecting container 4. Both the hopper 9 and the collecting container 4 are equipped with vibrators ensuring continuous inflow.<br>
The other two openings at the input container 2 are a cycle catalyst oil supply 10 from an oil collection container 15 and a collection catalyst oil supply 11 from an oil collection container 15 disposed at the discharge of this oil collection container 15. Thereby, it is made possible that the catalyst oil also retains the lime residues<br>
in the cycle.<br>
On the pressure side of the high-performance chamber mixer 1, a pressure line 12 is attached. It passes the product vapour-oil mixture produced in the high-performance chamber mixer 1 into an evaporator 14. It has a distribution gutter 13 dividing the entering oil-vapour mixture into a plurality of partial jets through perforated sheets in an annular nozzle with open end, which wet the wall, and which results in a surface of the liquid in the evaporator 14 as large as possible.<br>
Thereby, it is achieved that almost the entire product separates in vaporous state from the liquid and is able to deposit upwards in a distillation column 18, and no product will enter the oil collection container 15, if possible. Repeated cleavage of already generated product In the Diesel boiling region would reduce the production amount and decrease the product in quality.<br>
The input system 3 is turned on and off and speed controlled by a level controlling container 16 indicating and controlling the level in the oil collection container 15, respectively. At the lower end of the level controlling container 16, a pump 17 is disposed, which passes a small amount of oil to the input system 3 in order to<br>
protect it from obstructions.<br>
On the vapour side of the product, the product vapour is purified from the entrained oil particles by fractioned distillation in the distillation column 18 and condensed in the condenser 19. The water portions arising in the condensation are retained in the condenser 19 by a partition on the input side due to their higher specific gravity.<br><br>
From there, the water portion enters a pH measuring container 20 by exchange with the product located there with the water settling downwards. In the pH measuring container 20, there is a pH measuring probe 23 and a conductivity probe 22. Upon reaching the water at the conductivity probe 22. a certain amount of water is discharged into a product water container 21 and from there discharged into an overflow pipe.<br>
The lighter product, Diesel or fuel oil, enters a product line 24 on the output side through the separating sheet in the condenser, wherein vaporous product portions enter a product container 25 through a line 26 like the product in the product line 24. A small portion of the product gets back in controlled manner into the distillation column into one of the upper bases 27 through the line 25.<br>
Therein, the control is adjusted such that the amount controls the return in the column. It generates a different product quality for summer Diesel with an average boiling temperature of 290°C, for winter Diesel with an average boiling temperature of 270 '°C, and for kerosene with an average boiling temperature of 240 °C. Cooling the condenser is effected with cycle water and a heat exchanger 38 with cycle water pump.<br>
Behind the product container, there is a vacuum pump 37 which keeps the entire system under negative pressure. The sucked gas is added in the current generator as intake air or purified in a catalytic exhaust air purification. As gases sucked off from the plant, the carbon dioxides derived from the biologic substances and the small gas amounts possibly derived from leaks result.<br>
Thereby, it is ensured that no combustible product can exit the plant. To this end, the vacuum pump controls the amount of input and the amount of output of the non-reactive, inorganic residues discharged at the lower end of the plant.<br><br>
The non-reactive portions of the input substance and the salts forming by the ion-exchanging catalyst and the added lime or soda enter a heat chamber 32 through a control valve 30 and a hot sludge pump 31.<br>
It is electrically heated to 550°C and has a heat-resistant evaporation container with the sludge entry on the inner side, a vapour return line to the evaporator and a screw output 33 for the heated inorganic substances entering a residual container 34. On average, it is 1 to 3 % of the input substance.<br>
The substances collected in the residual container 34 are subsequently mixed with the water of the container 21. The substances depositing in the suspension, metal, glass and ceramics, are separated and the suspension is filtered. The filter residue is re-utilisable catalyst. The liquid contains the formed salts and is passed into the waste water.<br>
The containers have relieve and pressure balance lines like the input container 2 connected to the distillation column through a vent chamber with check valve 35. Furthermore, all of the heat carrying parts are doubly isolated with an alumina fibre mat on the surface and an isolating mat-thereon. On the outside, a cover sheet is disposed, which is formed as a closed chamber on the turbine, which can withstand a small overpressure.<br>
In one embodiment, the method is explained. A high-performance chamber mixer<br>
