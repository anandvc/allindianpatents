				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> <br><br>
The present invention relates to. a crystalline hydrate of a substituted : nicotinanilide derivative and method for their preparation. The derivative is of the formula I<br><br>
vA R1  is phenyl which is substituted by halogen,<br>
R2  is methyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, chlorine, bromine or iodine,<br>
R3  is trifluoromethyl or chlorine,<br>
which are present as hydrates. The present invention furthermore encompasses the preparation of suspension concentrates and suspoemulsions using the abovementioned active ingredient hydrate and methods for controlling phytopathogenic fungi or undesired attack by insects or mites and/or for regulating the growth of plants via dilution of the abovementioned formulations.<br>
The fungicidal action of pyridylamides of the formula I (A=A2), a class of essentially water-insoluble compounds, and methods for their preparation are known (EP-A2 545099). These compounds can be obtained industrially by crystallization from an organic solvent.<br><br>
If it is desired to formulate water-insoluble compounds for the purpose of applying them in liquid form to the pests or plants in question, there are essentially two possibilities:<br>
1.	The active ingredient is formulated as an emulsion concentrate (EC).<br>
2.	The active ingredient is formulated as an aqueous suspension concentrate (SC). Here, an organic phase which may optionally comprise further adjuvants or active ingredients may be added to the SC. The formulation prepared is termed a suspoemulsion (SE) .<br>
It is advantageous to provide aqueous formulations, taking into . consideration the pollution of the environment by organic solvents as are used in large amounts in ECs.<br>
SCs consist essentially of an aqueous phase in which the active ingredient, besides adjuvants, is suspended. The preparation of SCs is known to the skilled worker. For example, SCs can be prepared by milling the abovementioned active ingredient in the presence of various adjuvants and water as continuous medium (Mollet, H. and Grubemann, A. "Formulierungstechnik" [Formulation technology], WILEY-VCH, 2000, p. 133 et seq.).<br>
The term adjuvants is understood as meaning inn the present context formulation auxiliaries such as surfactants, thickeners, solvents, antifoams, bactericides and antifreeze agents.<br>
Said SCs can be used for the preparation of SEs. This is the case as a rule when the active ingredient(s) present in the suspension is/are to be combined with liquid active ingredients which are not miscible with water, or with oily active ingredients or with an organic active ingredient solution of a water-insoluble active ingredient in a readymix. The preparation of SEs is known to the skilled worker; for example, SEs can be prepared by the method described in EP-A 707445.<br>
When the abovementioned SCs are prepared, it is necessary to grind the active ingredient as finely as possible in the presence of water and further adjuvants.<br>
In the case of the abovementioned nicotinanilide derivatives, surprisingly, this is not possible since they form a loamy solid . during the preparation of an SC,   which does not allow the milling procedure to be continued.<br><br>
It is an object of the present invention to modify the active ingredient in such a way that it can be ground with adjuvants in the presence of water.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by providing the corresponding hydrates of nicotinanilide derivatives. Surprisingly, we have found that, in contrast to the anhydrates, the hydrates can be ground without problems.<br>
The present invnetion claims hydrates of nicotinanilide derivatives of the formula I:<br><br>
R1  is phenyl which is substituted by halogen,<br>
R2  is methyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, chlorine, bromine or iodine,<br>
R3  is trifluoromethyl or halogen, the linkage of Al in position 2 and of A2 in position 3 relative to the parent compound I being preferred.<br>
Especially preferred in this context are hydrates of nicotinanilide derivatives of the formula II:<br><br><br>
in which<br>
R1  is phenyl which is substituted by halogen, and<br>
R3  is halogen.<br>
The phenyl radical is preferably monosubstituted to trisubstituted by halogen.<br>
Halogen is understood as meaning, in the present context, fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, especially preferably<br>
chlorine.<br>
The compound 2-chloro-N-(4'-chlorobiphenyl-2-yl)nicotinamide is very specially preferred.<br>
Especially preferred among the abovementioned hydrates of the nicotinanilide derivatives are the corresponding monohydrates.<br>
The preparation of the amide compounds of the formula I or II is known, for example, from EP-A-545 099 or EP-A-589 301 or can be effected by analogous methods.<br>
The present invention furthermore relates to methods for the preparation of the abovementioned hydrates.<br>
In one embodiment (method 1), the method encompasses the following steps:<br>
a)	dissolving the anhydrate of I in a water-soluble organic solvent, and<br>
b)	precipitating the hydrate of I by addition of water.<br>
The term water-soluble solvent refers in this context to a solvent which is soluble in water to at least 5%.<br>
The ratio between water and organic phase in step a) of the abovementioned method is generally 1:10 to 10:1, preferably 1:3 to 3:1.<br>
Water-soluble organic solvents which can be used in this context are cyclic ethers such as dioxane or tetrahydrofuran, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol or pentanol, and dimethylformamide or N-methylpyrrolidone, or mixtures of the above. The use of tetrahydrofuran is preferred.<br><br>
In a further embodiment (method 2), the method encompasses the following steps:<br>
a)	mixing an organic solution comprising the anhydrate of I with water,<br>
b)	heating the mixture prepared in step a) at a temperature of 30-150°C,<br>
c)	cooling the resulting solution.<br>
In step a) of the abovementioned method, the ratio between water and organic phase is generally 10:1 to 1:10, preferably 1:3 to 3:1.<br>
Organic solvents which can be used in this context are cyclic ethers such as dioxane or tetrahydrofuran, ketones such as acetone, cyclohexanone or MEK, or aromatic solvents such as benzene, toluene, xylene or solvents such as dimethylformamide or - N-methylpyrrolidone, or mixtures of the above.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of method 2, the solution in step b) is incubated at a temperature of preferably 30-70°C, especially preferably 3 0-60°C, and subsequently suitably cooled.<br>
In a further embodiment (method 3), the method encompasses the following steps:<br>
a)	mixing the solid anhydrate of I with water,<br>
b)	heating the mixture prepared in step a) at a temperature of 30-150°C until the anhydrate has been converted into the hydrate, or<br>
c)	incubating the mixture prepared in step a) with exposure to shearing forces until the anhydrate has been converted into the hydrate.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the abovementioned method, the " ' solution in step b) is incubated at a temperature of preferably 30-70°C, especially preferably 30-60°C, and subsequently suitably cooled.<br>
The incubation period in step b) is from 30 minutes to 48 hours. At least 50%, preferably at least 70%, of the anhydrate is converted into the hydrate.<br><br>
The incubation in step c) is carried out over a period of at least 3 0 minutes to 48 hours.<br>
The exposure of the mixture to strong shearing forces, which is described in step c), can be effected by milling in suitable mills. Mills with a short residence time of the product, such as rotor-stator mills, have proved to be particularly advantageous in this context.<br>
In both of the abovementioned methods, the conversion rate of anhydrate into the hydrate can be monitored by means of a suitable analytical method, such as, for example, IR spectroscopy or X-ray powder diffractometry.<br>
The conversion of hydrate/anhydrate can be quantified by IR, for example by the shift of characteirstic bands (for example C=0 stretching vibration). Thus, for example, the C=0 stretching vibration shifts from 1650cm-1 to 1660cm-1 from 2-chloro-N-(4'-chlorobiphenyl-2-yl)nicotinamide anhydrate to 2-chloro-N-(4'-chlorobiphenyl-2-yl)nicotinamide monohydrate. The disappearance of the band at 1650cm"1 thus indicates complete conversion of the anhydrate into the hydrate.<br>
In method 3, the preparation of the respective hydrate by one of i the abovementioned methods can even be carried out in the presence of adjuvants ("direct method").<br>
The present invention also relates to suspoemulsions (SE) or suspension concentrates (SC)   comprising, as essential component, the hydrate of an active ingredient I, with A preferably being A2.<br>
For the preparation of SCs, for example, the hydrate of the nicotinanilide derivative is milled in water in the presence of ' surfactants, and if appropriate of further adjuvants.<br>
In a possible embodiment of the abovementioned preparation procedure, the surfactants are first homogenized together with the antifreeze agent and water, and a nicotinanilide derivative hydrate which has been prepared by a method according to the invention is then added. The resulting mash can subsequently be comminuted directly in a mill, for example a stirred ball mill. Other suitable mills are mentioned in Mollet, H. and Grubemann, A. "Formulierungstechnik" [Formulation technology], WILEY-VCH, 2000. To achieve the desired fineness, it may be necessary to repeat the milling step several times.<br><br>
When the desired particle size distribution of preferably 40% smaller than 2 microns and 100% smaller than 12 microns has been achieved, thixotropic agents may, as a rule, be added to the suspension.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the hydrate is prepared via steps a) and b) of method 3, suitable adjuvants previously having been added to the mixture as it is produced. Directly thereafter, the mixture prepared is milled finely as described above, milling in a stirred ball mill is especially preferred in this context.<br>

Morwet®D425 by Witco).<br>
Viscosity-regulating additives which are suitable for the abovementioned formulation types are compounds which impart pseudoplastic flow behavior to the formulation, i.e. high viscosity in the state of rest and low viscosity in the state of motion.<br>

To widen the spectrum of action or achieve specific effects, for example, the additional protection against insects, arachnids or mites, the abovementioned formulations can be combined with further agrochemical active ingredients which, in the latter case, can be incorporated together with suitable additives. The term additive refers in this context to a selection of the abovementioned surfactants and other adjuvants. In the case of an SC formulation, additional active ingredients can be dissolved in the aqueous phase or suspended in finely-ground form. In the case of an SE formulation, the SC according to the invention comprises a further active ingredient emulsified in liquid or dissolved form in the formulation, in addition to the suspended active ingredient.<br>

Especially suitable are mixtures of aromatic hydrocarbons like the solvents which are commercially available under the names Solvesso® (manufacturer: Esso) or Shellsol® (manufacturer: Shell). Solvents on a purely aliphatic basis which may be used are liquid paraffin (for example Linpar®: Ci4~Ci7-hydrocarbon fraction from Wintershall), but also native oils such as rapeseed oil and soya oil, as long as they are capable of dissolving the active ingredient sufficiently. Moreover, esters of natural and synthetic fatty acids or polycarboxylic acids and mixtures of these (for example acetates such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, but also acetates of higher alcohols (C5-C2o-cLic:ohols) /  dialkyl adipate, alkyl glutarate or alkyl citrate) may be used.<br>

Regulation of the growth of plants can be effected by the growth regulators which have already been mentioned further above or by<br>
using fertilizer.<br><br>
A preferred embodiment of the abovementioned method is a method of controlling phytopathogenic fungi.<br>
All of the abovementioned methods can be carried out by suitably diluting an SC  or SE formulation according to the invention and applying the dilution to the respective pest or to the materials, plants, soil and seeds to be protected from the respective pests, it being possible for the respective SC or SE formulation additionally to comprise a further fungicidal active ingredient.<br>
In this context, the compositions according to the invention or the substances can be applied pre-emergence or post-emergence. If the active ingredients in question are less well tolerated by specific crop plants, application techniques can be used in which the dilute SC  or SE formulations are sprayed, with the aid of the spraying apparatus, in such a way that the agrochemical active ingredients come into as little contact as possible, if any, with the leaves of the sensitive crop plants while reaching the bare soil surface (post-directed, lay-by).<br>
The application rates of active ingredient are from 0.001 to 3.0, preferably from 0.01 to 1.0, kg/ha, depending on the intended aim of the control measures, the season, the target plants and the growth stage.<br>
In the following text, the method according to the invention is illustrated with reference to examples, but it is not limited thereto:<br>
Example 1<br>
A)	Preparation of the anhydrate<br>
2-Chloro-N-(4'-chlorobiphenyl-2-yl)nicotinamide was obtained at . the end of the synthesis as hot xylenic solution. Upon cooling slowly, virtually all of the active ingredient crystallized from xylene. After filtration, residual xylene was removed by drying in a vacuum drying oven, whereby the active ingredient was obtained in the form of the anhydrate. The physical properties are compiled in Table 1.<br>
B)	Preparation of the hydrate<br>
1 g of 2-chloro-N-(4'-chlorobiphenyl-2-yl)nicotinamide anhydrate was dissolved in 20 ml of THF at 40°C and the solution was then poured into 2 0 ml of water. The material which had precipitated was filtered off with suction and dried at 40°C in a drying oven.<br><br>
The physical properties of the<br>
2-chloro-N-(4'-chlorobiphenyl-2-yl)nicotinamide monohydrate thus<br>
prepared are shown in Tabelle 1.<br>
C) Analysis of the conversion of hydrate/anhydrate<br>
The IR spectra were recorded with an FT IR spectrometer. The samples were either prepared as KBr disks or measured using what is known as a single-reflexion diamond ATR measuring unit (Durascope, Resultec).<br>
When the measurement was carried out using the single-reflexion diamond ATR measuring unit, the suspension comprising the solid to be tested was applied to a clay plate or filter paper. The solid which remained after removal of the water was subsequently applied to the single-reflexion diamond ATR measuring unit.<br>
The IR spectra shown in Figures 1 to 4 (see also Table 1) furthermore illustrate the differences between<br>
2-chloro-N-(4'-chlorobiphenyl-2-yl)nicotinamide monohydrate and 2-chloro-N- (4'-chlorobiphenyl-2-yl)nicotinamide anhydrate. Thus, IR spectroscopy can be used for monitoring the conversion rate.<br>
The X-ray powder diagrams shown in Figures 5 to 6 (see also Table 1) were recorded using standard methods as are described, for example, in H.P. Klug and L.E. Alexander, X-Ray Diffraction Procedures (1974) or R. Jenkins and R.L. Snyder, X-Ray Powder Diffractometry (1996). The measurements were carried out with Cu-Ka radiation in a Siemens D-5000 diffractometer in the range of diffraction angles 2 0=4°- 35° at a step size of 0.02°.<br><br><br>
Example 2<br>
The trade names of the adjuvants used for formulating the , hydrate/anhydrate of Example 1 are compiled in Table 2.<br><br>
A)	Formulations of the anhydrate<br>
500 g of 2-chloro-N-(4'-chlorobiphenyl-2-yl)nicotinamide anhydrate were added to a mixture of 30 g of Wettol Dl, 40 g of Pluronic PE 10500, 4 g of Proxel GXL, 50 g of propylene glycol and 5 g of Silikon SRE in approx. 300 ml of water. After the mixture had been stirred briefly, it was pumped through a Dyno KDL mill (1.2 mm beads, milling space 1.2 1) at a rate of 2 1/h. After only a short time, the mill became clogged and had to be switched off. The suspension collected in the receiver also started to solidify.<br>
B)	Formulations of the hydrate<br>
500 g of 2-chloro-NM4'-chlorobiphenyl-2-yl)nicotinamide monohydrate were combined as described under A with adjuvants. After the mixture had been stirred briefly, it was pumped through a Dyno KDL mill (1.2 mm beads, milling space 1.2 1) at a rate of 2 1/h. The milling process was carried out without problems. No clogging of the mill or crystallization in the receiver was observed. After eight milling passes, a sufficiently fine particle size of 70% 
C)	Characterization and comparison of the resulting formulations<br><br>
While the procedure described under Example 2 A) gave a loamy crystal slurry even before the preparation was complete (formulation A) which had to be discarded, the process described under B) (formulation B) gave a storage-stable formulation in which no further crystallization was observed.<br>
The particle size of the resulting formulation B was measured using a Malvern Mastersizer (see Table 3). The data shown are the percentage of the particles which are smaller than 2^m.<br><br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of the hydrate by direct conversion<br>
A)	Mechanical method<br>
2 5 kg of 2-chloro-N-(4'-chlorobiphenyl-2-yl)nicotinamide anhydrate are added to a mixture of 1.5 kg of Wettol® Dl, 2 kg of Pluronic®PE 10500, 200 g of Proxel® GXL, 2.5 kg of propylene glycol and 250 g of Silikon®SRE in approx. 15 1 of water.<br>
For conversion into the hydrate, the mixture was passed repeatedly throught a rotor-stator mill of type PuC (gap width 0.2 mm, throughput 200-300 1/h). After each pass, the degree of conversion of the anhydrate into the hydrate was monitored by IR spectroscopy. The conversion was complete after 4 to 7 passes. The subsequent fine-milling by Dyno mill was carried out without problems. Storage-stable goods complying with specification were obtained.<br>
B)	Thermal method<br>
In a heatable stirred vessel, 2 5 kg of<br>
2-chloro-N-(4'-chlorobiphenyl-2-yl)nicotinamide anhydrate are mixed as described in the mixing specification 3 A) with adjuvants and water. The mixture was stirred for 5 hours at 50°C using a propeller mixer. An IR spectroscopy check revealed that complete conversion into the hydrate had taken place during this period. After cooling to 30°C, the product was milled in a stirred<br><br>
ball mill (Dyno type); after 8 passes at a throughput of 100 1/h, product complying with specification was obtained.<br>
