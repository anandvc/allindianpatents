				<td>Rapid developments in biotechnology, such as genetic engineering and downstream processing have effectively made possible the production of recombinant protein molecules. As the world moves towards more biological protein based therapies and as more companies produce recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA) derived molecules the efficiency of the process assumes significance.<br>
In addition to (the ideal culture conditions and better expression systems, the importance of simplification of protein purification technology for the production of recombinant protein molecules in commercially viable quantities is necessitated today than ever before. A decrease in the number of purification steps, improvements of the yields, preservation of the biological activity, use of techniques strictly selected on the basis of their simplicity, high performance and reproducibility, and possible use of automated<br>
techniques are major objectives in defining conditions.<br><br><br>
Biomolecules produced by rDNA technology can be endo or Intracellular proteins ('inside' the cell); Periplasmic (part of the cell wall) or extracellular proteins ('outside5 the cell in the culture-medium). They can be produced using a variety of organisms like E.coli; S.cerevisiae; P.pastdris etc. The present invention relates specifically to endocellular rDNA derived biomolecules produced in E.coli as 'inclusion bodies'or 'refractile' bodies.<br>
Endocellular proteins have to be purified from a cell extract containing a complex mixture of molecules (proteins, lipids, nucleic acids) that result from cell lysis. Then isolation, identification, and purification of the factor under investigation require a more or less complex technology that includes extraction, centrifugation and various separation techniques. This calls for different chromatographic techniques when the expected protein has to be highly purified. Chromatography is of greatest interest because it<br><br>
produces very good separation and opens way to many prospects. It is based essentially upon the various interactions between the molecules to be separated and the stationary phase constituting the support. These different techniques can be used separately or in combination.<br><br>
Brief Summary of the Invention<br>
Inclusion bodies containing the protein of interest can be produced as a general flow chart as listed in Figure 1. The present invention is limited to the use of Reversed Phase High<br>
■» s<br><br>
performance Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC) as a purification and subsequently combined with refolding step in the production of highly pure refolded active rDNA derived proteins.<br>
Ion exchange and gel filtration are widely used in commercial production of recombinant molecules. These are known techniques that practically grew up with protein chemistry. These previous methods used for the purification of rDNA derived proteins (either from yeast or E.coli) likel cationic chromatography, gel filtration (or even reversed phase HPLC for tjiat-matter) resulted in yields that were low. Also the purified protein sometimes had clips or cleavages, which were still held together by disulfide bonds. In addition, further refolding parameters like different pH, oxidation and reduction systems using mercaptoethanol, DTT, glutathione and affinity chromatography like heparin sepharose column were also necessitated making the purification process lengthy and complex.<br>
Reversed phase was developed primarily for the analysis of small molecules and its potential was mostly unrealized until the introduction of wide pore RP adsorbents in the 1980's.<br>
Even after this its use was mostly limited to analytical scale due to the misconceptions about its practicality in the process scale and due to the apprehensions of loss of biological activity especially for recombinant proteins. This loss of biological activity is often attributed to the solvents used.<br>
Though many a commercial chromatographic processes use RP today, it is mainly for what are referred colloquially as 'polishing' steps in the tertiary or end stage purification process. It is evident to those skilled in the art that this technique has not been used in the initial stages especially with respect Uo purification of endocellular recombinant DNA molecules produced in E.coli.<br><br>
Thus there is need in the art of purification some rDNA derived molecules from E.Coli where in simplified quick procedure is followed leading to highly pure form with good<br>
t<br>
activity and the procedure should be ensured free of problems of purification and refolding. The present invention provides such possibility over other related methods.<br>
It is aim of this invention to show that this technique can used in the initial stages to provide a simple and trouble free method of purification of some recombinant DNA derived proteins free from host proteins wherein at least 90- 95% pure recombinant proteins can.be obtained. The method employs RP-HPLC using polystyrene based wide pore matrix wherein unfolded protein form of recombinant protein was isolated and used for refolding in a novel way. This process enables protein to be converted to active folded form in a simplified unique step which is combined with RPHPLC method that greatly increases the yield and reduce the need for elaborate multi stage processes.<br>
This process has demonstrated in three different molecules but is not limited in any way to these three molecules. It is the claim of this invention that this process can be used for<br>
a purification of range of rDNA derived inclusion body proteins produced in E.coli.<br>

The process has been demonstrated1 in,,at least three rDNA derived biomolecules, like but not limited to recombinant human platelet derived growth factor-B; recombinant human interferon alpha 2b; recombinant human interferon gamma lb.<br>
A skin wound is defined as a breach in the continuity of any body tissue caused by a minimal direct; injury to the skin. There are many instances where a quick closure of the wounded skin will promote a! beneficial response. Chronic, non healing wounds have plagued healthcare practitioners for decades. In this regard PDGF-BB has been shown to be active in promoting wound healing in several animal models. Human platelet-derived growth, factor has been shown to be the major mitogenic protein in serum for mesenchymal derived cells. A number of studies reported that platelet extracts or purified PDGF-BB induces either cell multiplication or DNA synthesis in cultured smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts and glial cells. Furthermore PDGF BB is a potent chemoattractant for cells that are responsive to it as a mitogen. This is also somewhat unusual in that mitogens generally do not also act as chemotactic agents.<br>
PDGF-BB has therapeutic applications for the treatment of injuries, which require the proliferation of fibroblasts or smooth muscle cells to heal. In this regard PDGF-BB has been shown to be active in promoting wbund healing in several animal models. Lynch et al. disclose the use of insulin like growth factor (IGF-1) and purified PDGF-BB to<br><br>
promote healing of dermal wounds in pigs. These two growth factors showed a synergestic effect in promoting the healing. Lynch et al also found that c combination PDGF-BB and IGF-1 promotes bone and cementum formation in a dog model of periodontitis. In addition Greenhalgh et al demonstrated enhanced healing of full-thickness skin wounds in genetically diabetic mice treated with recombinant PDGF-BB as compared to control animals. Thomason et al disclose that recombinant PDGF-BB accelerates the gain in tensile strength of healing skin wounds in rats and promotes wound healing in diabetic rats.<br>
Interferons are proteins naturally occurring in the body, which has antiviral, anti proliferative and immunoregulatory activity. In particular, it inhibits replication of a variety of RNA- and DNA-containing viruses, inhibits the growth of malignant cells, affects the expression of a variety of oncogenes and activates natural killer cells. Recombinant human interferon alpha is used for the treatment of hairy cell leukemia, AIDS-related ^Kaposi's sarcoma and chronic hepatitis B and C. Before recombinant DNA technology, interferon alpha (leukocyte interferon) used to be prepared from natural sources, human leukocyte. Today, recombinant interferons are prepared from microbial source, e.g!, £. coli and therefore, after their isolation from the micro organism or from the culture 'medium they are initially contaminated by a series of microbial impurities presence of which is prohibitive for a therapeutic use of the proteins produced this way.<br>
Recombinant DNA derived preparations should be highly pure and homogeneous with required biological activity. The purification of the recombinant material, therefore, plays a particularly important role.<br>
Example 1-Recombinant Human Interferon Alpha 2b (rhIFNa2b)<br>
The E.C6U was used for the manufacture of incorporating the gene for expression of rhIFNa2b in a suitable vecfor, E coli cells containing rhIFNa2b were harvested after fermentation, centrifuged, washed and lysed by sonication.   The inclusion bodies were<br><br>
recovered by centriftigation and washed with buffers containing urea, high salt and detergent. Finally, the inclusion bodies were washed with distilled water. The rhIFNa2b was extracted with 6M GuanidineCl and diluted by 50 fold dilution in 100 mM Tris-HCl5 10 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 buffer containing 0.1 M L-arginine. The diluted solution was concentrated by ultrafiltration using lOkD cutoff membrane and loaded on to reverse phase polystyrene column equilibrated with 0.1% TFA solution. The bound protein is eluted using 30-60% acetonitrile over 60 min. The recombinant rhINF-lb eluting at 40% acetonitrile is pooled, diluted to 10 fold and diafiltered and used for subsequent purposes. The diafiltered sample was passed through 0.2u filter and the turbidity was removed. The diafiltered sample is almost 90% pure and has the activity comparing to the WHO standards. The diafiltered solution was fractionated on Superdex 75 to remove any aggregates.   , •<br>

The column was washed thoroughly with the starting buffer and the bound protein is eluted using 20-60% acetonitrile over 60 min. The monomelic form of rhlFNylb eluting at 40% acetonitrile is pooled, after analysis by SDS-PAGE. The pure monomer pooled fractions were concentrated and used for purposes. The pooled fraction was diluted ten fold in tris CI (50mM), pH 7.0 buffer and left couple of hours for 12 h for refolding.
