				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an earth block forming machine including<br>
opposed compaction chambers each receiving a reciprocal compacting member<br>
to form solid building blocks by compacting soil. The compacting members are<br>
reciprocated by a hydraulically actuated linkage mechanism connected to the<br>
compacting members to produce a very high compaction force while employing a<br>
relatively low hydraulic pressure. Each compaction chamber includes a vertically<br>
spaced and aligned inlet and outlet provided with a hydraulically powered<br>
openable and closable plate to enable inlet of a quantity of soil into each<br>
compaction chamber from a supply bin and discharge of the formed earth blocks<br>
from the compaction chambers.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
Earth block or adobe building blocks have been used in the construction<br>
of various buildings for many years and continue to be an important building<br>
material. Original adobe block construction involved the positioning of a slurry<br>
material in a mold and letting it dry and cure for an extended period of time. Over<br>
the years, various machines have been provided for compacting soil into earth<br>
blocks which can be stacked as walls and floors for any kind of structure without<br>
the use of mortar or other type of binder material to lock the blocks together.<br>
Also, various types of presses have been developed for compressing or<br>
compacting various materials.<br>
The following U. S. patents disclose various developments in earth block<br>
machines and presses for various purposes.<br>
1,864,769 2,524,683 3,225,409<br>
2,265,771 2,537,920 4,153,404<br>
2,388,679 3,142,105 4,579,706<br>
A number of block forming machines have been patented and built since<br>
the 1930s. Few are still on the market. The first ones had mobility but they were<br>
repeating the technologies of the time: mixture of the material with water and<br>
dropping the same in forms having the block size. In most, the blocks were dried<br>
by the sun (see patent Nos. 1,864,769, 2,524,683 and 3,142,105).<br>
One of the first machines using a hydraulic press of 1000 psi is described<br>
in patent No. 2,265,771. The mold is made of disassembling plates which makes<br>
it easier to charge and discharge the machine. The same inventor patented an<br>
advanced machine producing various shaped blocks (patent No. 2,388,679).<br>
These machines started to use ordinary soil. The block machine<br>
described in patent No. 3,225,409, by using a ram to compress the soil, tries to<br>
produce more blocks per cycle. A continuous supply of soil is described in patent<br>
No.4, 153,404. The soil flow is governed by retaining plates which open at the<br>
proper time.<br>
The block forming machine described in patent No. 4,579,706 also uses<br>
the direct force of a ram to compress soil supplied through a bin. To increase<br>
production, two molds are used, one on each side of a cylinder end. The rod,<br>
protruding out of the cylinder ends, controls the compressing blocks of each<br>
mold. The compression of the soil is done in sequence. All the ram machines<br>
described above use the ram directly on the soil to be compressed. For this<br>
reason, the hydraulic pressure in the rams is very high. This results in after-<br>
shock problems.<br>
The above patents disclose various types of presses including machines<br>
for making earth blocks or adobe blocks including rams which are directly<br>
actuated by a piston rod aligned with a pressure operated cylinder with the ram<br>
being reciprocally received in a compaction chamber or mold. Such direct<br>
application of force by the pressure operated cylinder requires extremely high<br>
fluid pressure in order to obtain an adequate compacting or compressing force<br>
on the ram. The prior art does not disclose an arrangement in which opposed<br>
rams are actuated by fluid pressure actuated linkage mechanisms having a<br>
unique force increasing relationship with the rams and an assembly applying<br>
hydraulically actuated force to the linkage mechanisms.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is an energy saving mobile machine allowing for high<br>
volume production of compressed soil into earth blocks which can enable<br>
construction of truly affordable housing. This invention, by using on-site soil to<br>
produce the blocks, not only saves energy in the production process but also in<br>
all related uses of the blocks. This invention eliminates the need for construction<br>
of a factory, truck loading of the blocks, transportation to the construction site<br>
and unloading of the blocks all of which contribute heavily to the depletion of<br>
energy. This invention will produce blocks which require no mortar or any other<br>
type of binder to lock the blocks together. This invention addresses the needs of<br>
worldwide low cost housing, emergency military quarters and other low cost<br>
structures. This invention requires less energy to produce its product than any<br>
other form of block forming technology and provides the quickest and least<br>
expensive type of construction. Building materials such as wood, which in<br>
developing countries requires forest destruction, adversely impact the<br>
environment and require vast amounts of energy for reforestation. This invention<br>
will produce blocks with a potential life span equaling or exceeding that of all<br>
existing building materials, in addition to being 100% recyclable, and have less<br>
impact on the environment than any other building material extracted from the<br>
earth.<br>
One advantage of this earth block forming machine over other soil<br>
compacting machines on the market is its ability to achieve high compaction with<br>
low hydraulic pressure. Current machines require hydraulic pressure of 4000 to<br>
5000 psi to drive their ramming systems which causes constant breakdowns<br>
within the hydraulic mechanism. In contrast, this invention"s hydraulic system will<br>
operate at 750 psi. This low hydraulic pressure in turn will drive a leverage<br>
ramming system which will compress the blocks at approximately 3000 psi. The<br>
leverage ramming system contrasts with the direct hydraulic force used by<br>
current machines to drive the ramming system. This invention, by using a<br>
leverage system, is not impacted by the perpetual stress experienced by the<br>
other block forming machines using direct hydraulic ramming. The current block<br>
forming machines on the market produce between 300 to 400, 12" X 10" X 4",<br>
blocks per hour. This invention will produce 1200 or more 12" X 10" X 4" blocks<br>
per hour achieving a compressive resistance as high or higher than that of the<br>
other machines.<br>
The positive energy impact of this invention is twofold. First, the<br>
production of blocks to be manufactured by this invention will use less energy<br>
than current block machines. Second, this invention has a dual ramming system<br>
which uses the same amount of energy as the single ramming system of other<br>
machines, while tripling production of the other machines thereby reducing the<br>
energy to produce one block by 66%. In addition to this twofold energy saving in<br>
the manufacturing process, there are substantial savings from the elimination of<br>
transportation of blocks from the manufacturing source to the construction site.<br>
Many areas suitable for large scale, low cost, housing projects and areas where<br>
emergency military quarters are needed, are long distances from a<br>
manufacturing source. This often requires transporting high volumes of building<br>
materials hundreds of miles. This invention eliminates this need of transporting<br>
blocks, resulting in major energy savings. One further source of energy saving<br>
would be the exceptional insulation qualities provided by earth blocks.<br>
Adobe building blocks have been used in construction for thousands of<br>
years. Throughout North and South America, Africa, the Middle East and other<br>
parts of the world, adobe blocks continue to be an important building material.<br>
The invention takes the ancient adobe method of making blocks to a state of the<br>
art technology. The invention eliminates the weeks and months of curing time<br>
required by conventional adobe blocks. As quickly as the invention produces<br>
blocks, the blocks can be stacked as walls and floors for any kind of structure.<br>
Block manufacturing plants are normally located in places where the<br>
prime raw material is abundant and easy to obtain. The blocks are then<br>
transported to the place of use, in many cases hundreds of miles. This invention<br>
eliminates the cost of transportation, thereby saving vast amounts of fuel by<br>
fabricating the blocks at the place of use. Thus, every building site becomes an<br>
instantaneous block factory. There are several block forming machines on the<br>
market that produce blocks at the place of use. However, these machines have<br>
severe problems caused by the constant high pressure of the fluid used in their<br>
hydraulic system. In addition, the aftershock caused by releasing the high<br>
pressure during their working cycle is very deleterious. These adverse effects<br>
reduce the effective working time of the machines by over 60%. The mean<br>
pressure used by these machines is 5000 psi. The machine of this invention<br>
uses a pressure of only 750 psi and compresses the soil at a higher pressure.<br>
This is made possible through the use of a mechanical leverage system driven<br>
by a low-pressure hydraulic system. This machine compresses soil at up to 3000<br>
psi and thus obtains a solid block which is better than the blocks obtained with<br>
the traditional method.<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide an earth block<br>
forming machine utilizing opposed compaction chambers or molds and opposed<br>
compacting members or rams reciprocal in relation to the compacting chambers<br>
with a hydraulically actuated power mechanism connected to the compacting<br>
members by a mechanical leverage system that enables an extremely high<br>
compaction or compression pressure to be exerted on soil in the compaction<br>
chambers while using a reduced hydraulic pressure.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide an earth block forming<br>
machine in accordance with the preceding object in which the hydraulic<br>
mechanism includes a pair of opposed generally aligned hydraulic piston and<br>
cylinder assemblies with the piston of each of the assemblies being connected to<br>
a pair of links which move the opposed compacting members in a reciprocal<br>

A further object of the invention is to provide an earth block forming<br>
machine in accordance with the preceding objects in which each of the<br>
compaction chambers includes a vertically spaced inlet opening and outlet<br>
opening in which the inlet openings are communicated with a supply bin for soil<br>
to be compressed into a solid building block.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide an earth block forming<br>
machine in accordance with the preceding objects in which the inlets and outlets<br>
are opened and closed by sliding plates actuated by hydraulically powered piston<br>
and cylinder assemblies operated independently of the piston and cylinder<br>
assemblies for reciprocating the compacting members.<br>
Another significant object of this invention is to provide an earth block<br>
forming machine that is hydraulically operated to compress soil at a very high<br>
pressure until the soil becomes a solid building block with the soil to be<br>
compressed being supplied from a supply bin into a pair of opposed, aligned and<br>
spaced compaction chambers each of which receives a reciprocal compacting<br>
member with the compacting members being in opposed aligned relation and<br>
connected to a pair of links at their proximal ends with the links converging and<br>
pivotally connected to the piston of one of a pair of opposed hydraulically<br>
operated piston and cylinder assemblies whereby the links will be moved from a<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In describing the preferred embodiment of the present invention as<br>
illustrated in the drawings, specific terminology will be resorted to for the sake of<br>
clarity. However, the invention is not intended to be limited to the specific<br>
embodiment illustrated and terms so selected; it being understood that each<br>
specific term includes all technical equivalents which operate in a similar manner<br>
to accomplish a similar purpose.<br>
Referring specifically to the drawings, the earth block forming machine of<br>
the present invention is generally designated by reference numeral 10, and<br>
includes a vertically disposed supply bin 12 receiving a quantity of soil to be<br>
compressed into solid earth blocks for use as building blocks in constructing any<br>
suitable type of building, housing or the like. The earth block forming machine<br>
includes a pair of opposed, horizontally disposed, aligned compaction chambers,<br>
generally designated by reference numeral 14, each of which reciprocally<br>
receives a compacting member or ram, generally designated by reference<br>
numeral 16, that is reciprocated by a hydraulically powered assembly, generally<br>
designated by reference numeral 18, with a mechanical leverage system,<br>
generally designated by numeral 20, interconnecting the hydraulically powered<br>
assembly 18 and the compacting members 16.<br>
The supply bin 12 includes a peripheral wall 22 oriented vertically and<br>
including an inverted V-shaped central baffle 24 which combines with the<br>
generally rectangular peripheral wall 22 to define a pair of horizontally spaced,<br>
vertically disposed soil discharge areas 26. Each of the compaction chambers 14<br>
includes a pair of parallel side walls 28 oriented vertically and extending<br>
horizontally in spaced parallel relation to each other as illustrated in Figure 2.<br>
The side walls 28 are interconnected by an end wall 30 perpendicular to the side<br>
walls 28 and rigidly fixed thereto as illustrated in Figures 1-3. The top of the<br>
compaction chamber 14 includes an inlet opening 32 and the bottom of the<br>
compaction chamber 14 includes an outlet opening 34. The openings 32 and 34<br>
are vertically aligned with the inlet opening 32 being in communication with the<br>
discharge area 26 for supplying soil 36 to be compressed into the compaction<br>
chamber 14 so that the compacting member 16 can compact the soil into a solid<br>
block that can be discharged from the outlet 34 after it has been compressed.<br>
The vertical orientation of the inlet and outlet enables gravity flow of soil into the<br>
compaction chamber 14 and gravity discharge of the blocks from the outlet 34 of<br>
the compaction chamber onto a conveyor or other structure to collect the blocks<br>
for use.<br>
The top of the compaction chamber is closed by a sliding plate 38 and the<br>
outlet 34 is closed by a sliding plate 40 which are horizontally received in and<br>
guided by grooves 42 in the side plates 28 with the distal end of the plates being<br>
received in grooves 50 in the end wall 30 as illustrated in Figures 2 and 3.<br>
Each of the compacting members or rams 16 includes a piston or ram 52<br>
slidable in the compaction chamber between the side plates 28 and between the<br>
closure plates 38 and 40 as illustrated in Figures 1-4. The piston 52 is connected<br>
to an elongated rod or bar 54 that extends longitudinally of the structure defining<br>
the compaction chambers 14 and centrally between longitudinal frame members<br>
44 which interconnect the compaction chambers 14 and supports the bin 12. The<br>
rods 54 are connected to the respective pistons 52 by a transverse pin or bolt 56.<br>
The end of the rod 54 remote from the piston 52 is provided with a pair of<br>
opposed lugs or brackets 58 rigid therewith with the brackets extending vertically<br>
from the top and bottom of the rod 54 as illustrated in Figure 1. The brackets 58<br>
are associated with the leverage system 20 in a manner to reciprocate the piston<br>
52 upon actuation of the hydraulic assembly 18. The leverage system 20 is<br>
oriented symmetrically above and below the longitudinal center of the earth block<br>
forming machine in generally vertical alignment.<br>
Each leverage system includes a pair of links 60 and 62. Each of the links<br>
60 and 62 has a bifurcated end 63 pivotally connected to the brackets or lugs 56<br>
by a pivot pin 64. The ends of the links 60 and 62 remote from the lugs 58 are<br>
positioned in overlying relation to each other and are connected to a piston rod<br>
66 extending from a hydraulic cylinder 68 by a pivot pin 70. The hydraulic<br>
assembly illustrated includes a pair of hydraulically powered piston and cylinders<br>
oriented in transverse, generally perpendicular relation to the longitudinal axis of<br>
the compaction chambers 14 and the compacting members 16. As the piston<br>
rods 66 are extended and retracted, the links 60 and 62 of each leverage system<br>
20 will move from an outwardly converging acute angular relation as illustrated in<br>
Figure 1 to a generally aligned relation as illustrated in Figure 3 thereby causing<br>
the piston or ram 52 to move outwardly toward the end wall 30 of the compaction<br>
chamber 14 to compress the soil 36 as illustrated in Figure 1 into a solid soil<br>
block 72 as illustrated in Figure 3.<br>
Each of the compression rods or bars 54 connected to the pistons or rams<br>
52 has its inner end guided by a pair of opposed guide surfaces 74 supported<br>
from frame 44 engaged by rollers 76 (see Figs. 3 and 5) journalled on the end of<br>
an axle or shaft 56 rigid with the rod or bar 54. The rollers 76 engage the guide<br>
surfaces 74 to guide and stabilize the end of the rod 54 remote from the piston<br>
52 during its reciprocation between the positions illustrated in Figures 1 and 3<br>
thus stabilizing the longitudinal movement of the bar 54 and maintaining the<br>
piston 52 in appropriate alignment with the side walls 28 and the plates 38 and<br>
40 for relative sliding movement of the piston 52 in the compaction chamber 14.<br>
The hydraulic cylinders 68 are supported for pivotal movement by<br>
trunnions 78 which extend outwardly and are journalled in sockets 80 (Figure 2)<br>
in a side frame structure 46 extending from frame 44 which enables the piston<br>
and cylinder assemblies to rock slightly or pivot slightly when the amount of soil<br>
36 in one of the compaction chambers or molds 14 is greater than in the other,<br>
thus enabling the soil in the opposed compaction chambers to be equally<br>
compressed and enable the piston and cylinder assemblies to compensate for<br>
the different volumes of soil in the compaction chambers.<br>
When it is desired to adjust the spacing of the piston 52 in relation to the<br>
end wall 30, an adjustable stopper 82 is provided to regulate the effective length<br>
of extension of the piston rod 66 when pressure is supplied to the piston and<br>
cylinder assembly.<br>
The top plate 38 on each of the compaction chambers 14 has its inner<br>
end connected to a piston rod 84. The piston rods 84 extend into a hydraulic<br>
cylinder 86 with a piston on the inner end of each piston rod in a conventional<br>
manner so that when pressure is supplied to or exhausted from the cylinder 86,<br>
the plates 38 will be moved outwardly simultaneously to the closed position or<br>
inwardly to an open position by being moved inwardly toward each other.<br>
Likewise, the bottom plates 40 which close the outlet 34 are connected to piston<br>
rods 88 which are received in a cylinder 90 with the pistons in the cylinder 90<br>
being extended or retracted as the hydraulic pressure is supplied to or exhausted<br>
from the cylinder 90 in a well known manner. This structure enables the closure<br>
plates 38 and 40 to be operated in a manner to open the upper plates 38 after<br>
compacted blocks have been discharged and the bottom plates 40 closed. This<br>
will admit the soil 36 into the compaction chambers after which the upper plates<br>
38 are closed and the pistons or rams 52 are moved outwardly to compress and<br>
compact the block 72. After compaction, the bottom plates 40 are retracted<br>
along with the piston or ram 52 so that the compacted block 72 will be<br>
discharged by gravity onto a conveyor to move the finished block to a position of<br>
use or storage. The bottom plates 40 are then closed and the top plates 38<br>
opened while the piston 52 remains retracted so that soil can fill the compaction<br>
chamber by gravity after which the top plates 38 are closed and the pistons 52<br>
extended and moved toward the end plates 30 for compacting the blocks.<br>
In this machine which is hydraulically operated, the soil will be<br>
compressed at a very high pressure until it becomes a solid block. The machine<br>
is symmetrical, excluding the bin 12, with respect to the common axis of the<br>
vertically oriented cylinders 68 and about the longitudinal axis of the compaction<br>
chambers 14 and the path of movement of the compacting members 16. In<br>
Figure 1, the earth block forming machine is at the beginning of the cycle with<br>
the cylinder 86 retracting the plates 38 thus permitting the soil in the bin to fall<br>
onto the bottom plates 40 which are in closed position. When the compaction<br>
chamber or mold is filled with soil, the top plates 38 are returned to their closed<br>
position and the piston rods 66 are moved towards each other with the pins 70<br>
also moving towards each other. The ends of the links 60 and 62 connected to<br>
the lugs 58 are moved away from each other in a horizontal direction with the<br>
pistons 52 thus being moved outwardly by the piston rods or bars 54. The<br>
illustration in Figure 3 shows the final position of the components when the soil<br>
has been compacted into earth blocks 72. After the earth blocks have been<br>
compressed, the plates 40 and pistons or rams 52 are retracted after a small<br>
time delay and as the plates 40 are fully retracted, the blocks drop onto a<br>
conveyor and are removed. In asmuch as it is difficult to have exactly the same<br>
amount of soil in each of the compaction chambers or molds and to exert the<br>
exactly the same hydraulic pressure on each of the vertical cylinders, the vertical<br>
cylinders 68 are trunnion mounted on pin 78. This allows the cylinders 68 to<br>
oscillate and the pins 70 to move arcuately horizontally to compensate for the<br>
different volumes of soil in the compaction chambers depending upon the<br>
quantity of the soil. Also depending upon the quality of the soil, the distance of<br>
the piston 52 and its adjacency to the end plate 30 of the compaction chamber<br>
can be changed by use of the adjustable stopper 82 which regulates the rod<br>
reaction of the vertical hydraulic cylinders 68.<br>
When the piston rods 66 of hydraulic cylinders 68 reach their maximum<br>
extension, the position of the links 60, 62 is almost horizontal, about 5° from<br>
horizontal alignment as illustrated in Figure 3. The force P of the hydraulic<br>
cylinders have two equal components: T is transmitted to the piston rods or bars<br>
54 by means of the pins 64. The horizontal component of force component T is<br>
H. H compresses the soil in the mold. Note that the total force compressing the<br>
soil in the compaction chamber 14 is 2H. The vertical component of force<br>
component T is V acting on pin 64 of the top links is elided by the vertical<br>
component V of the force component T acting on the lower links.<br>
The movement of piston rod or bar 54 is restrained along a horizontal axis<br>
by guide rollers 76.<br>
V = T • sina, where a is the angle formed by the link with horizontal.<br>
Also, P/2 = H • tana.<br>
When forming a 12" X 10" X 4" block or brick, the required force 2H to<br>
produce a pressure of 3,000 psi is 144,000 lbs. Therefore, H is 72,000 lbs.<br>
P = 2 • 72,000 • tana = 144,000 tan 5° = 12,598 lbs.<br>
A 6" bore hydraulic cylinder has a cross-sectional area of: 28.26 in2. The<br>
pressure to generate above load is:<br>
P = 12,598 / 28.26 = 446 psi<br>
A 5" bore hydraulic cylinder has a cross-sectional area of 19.625 in2. and<br>
P = 12,598/19.625 = 692 psi<br>
A 4" bore hydraulic cylinder has a cross-sectional area of 12.56 in2 and<br>
P = 12,589 / 12.56 = 1002.3 psi<br>
Theoretically there is no vertical force on piston rod or bar 54, making its<br>
motion easy. The size of the selected hydraulic cylinder is a 5" bore. Since a 750<br>
psi hydraulic fluid pressure is used, the load required is easily obtained.<br>
The machine is perfectly symmetric with respect to the hydraulic cylinder<br>
axes and includes a left side mold and a right side mold. The soil enters the mold<br>
or soil chambers by gravity through the discharge areas 26 in bin 12. The<br>
compression is done by the rams or pistons 52, which are connected to the<br>
compressing bars 54. When the hydraulic cylinders 68 extend the piston rods 66<br>
and the link ends 63 move outwardly in opposite directions, the two soil<br>
compressing rams or pistons 52 move in the same direction. The soil is<br>
compressed up to 3000 psi and becomes solid as rams or pistons 52 reach the<br>
end of their travel.<br>
To remove the blocks 72, the bottom plates 40 are slid inward, allowing<br>
the block to fall on a belt conveyor (not shown). The pistons 52 move inward at<br>
the same time. When the lower plates 40 closes the outlet and the hydraulic<br>
cylinders 86 and piston rods 84 retract and top plates 38 retract inwardly, leaving<br>
an opening for the soil to drop onto the lower plates 40. the position of the top<br>
plate controls the soil quantity needed to form the right size block.<br>
The compressing bar 54 is guided in its motion by two opposed guide<br>
surfaces 74 and two rollers 76. The high compression load on the soil is reached<br>
when the links 60 and 62 reach an almost horizontal position as shown in Figure<br>
The foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the<br>
invention. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur<br>
to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact<br>
construction and operation shown and described, and, accordingly, all suitable<br>
modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
