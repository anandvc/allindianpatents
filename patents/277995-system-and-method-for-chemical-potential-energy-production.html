<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The abundant, low-cost production of potent fuels, which can be used in intrinsically clean energy processes, i.e. processes which do not produce and emit greenhouse gases and other pollutants is a challenging task.<br>
<br>
Steam reforming is generally used to produce hydrogen from hydrocarbons. Steam reforming of natural gas, sometimes referred to as steam methane reforming (SMR), is the most common method of producing <br>
<br>
commercial bulk hydrogen, as well as hydrogen, used in the industrial synthesis of ammonia.<br>
<br>
The steam reforming of methane and other hydrocarbons (Reaction 1 below), is generally followed by a water shift reaction to convert CO to H2. The syn-gas (i.e. synthetic mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide) produced in the reforming process, can also be used as enriched gas fuel, or converted to liquid fuels such as methanol. Methane CH4 can be reformed with steam or carbon dioxide to form a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen (syn-gas) as follows: CH4 + H2O 
<br>
CH4 + CO2 «¦ 2CO + 2H2 ??=247.3 kJ/mol (2) where ?? is the enthalpy of the reaction. At high temperatures (700— 11000C) and in the presence of a metal-based catalyst, steam reacts with methane to yield carbon monoxide and hydrogen.<br>
<br>
GENERAL DESCRIPTION<br>
<br>
One clean fuel production process is solar-driven methane reforming which has been studied extensively [I]. Reaction (2) above can be reversed to produce energy upon demand, to operate in a closed loop, and therefore to provide a means for storage and transportation of solar energy. Reactions with solids such as metal oxides and carbon at high temperature [2-4] provide other solar thermo-chemical cycles for fuel production, without adding CO2 to the environment.<br>
<br>
Another example - electrolysis of water - is a simple method for clean fuel (hydrogen) production. However, it has a low attainable efficiency due to the need of using electricity. Recently, Stoots, C. M., O'Brien, J. E., Herring, J. S., Condie, K. G. and Hartvigsen, J. J. "Idaho National Laboratory Experimental Research in High Temperature Electrolysis for Hydrogen and Syngas Production," Proceedings of the 4th International Topical Meeting on High Temperature Reactor Technology HTR2008, September 28-October 1, 2008, Washington, DC USA have suggested <br>
<br>
performing high temperature electrolysis, possibly using a clean energy source, such as solar radiation. The higher temperature reduces the amount of electricity required for the process.<br>
<br>
Yet another method is thermolysis - heating the substance to a temperature where the free energy is equal or larger than zero and it dissociates spontaneously [2]. Although thermolysis of water/steam or carbon dioxide does not require electricity, it requires very high temperatures of above 3000K and 2500K, respectively.<br>
<br>
Another clean fuel production process is the photo-catalytic process, which requires neither electricity, nor high temperature. In this process, a high- energy photon initiates an endothermic reaction that produces fuel. However, the efficiency of this method is very low (about 1%) [5-7].<br>
<br>
Multi-stage thermo-chemical processes do not require electricity and have practical working temperatures. For example, some thermo-chemical methods of water decomposition can have up to 50% overall heat-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency and operate in medium-to-high working temperatures (T
<br>
CO2 electrolysis can use different metal electrodes, and liquid or solid polymer electrolytes as shown by [8], and more recently by Stoots, C. M., O'Brien, J. E., Herring, J. S., Condie, K. G. and Hartvigsen, J. J. in the Proceedings of the 4th International Topical Meeting on High Temperature Reactor Technology HTR2008, September 28-October 1, 2008, Washington, DC USA. The maximum efficiency of a non-polluting electrolysis system depends on the efficiency of a clean source electricity system, for example, a photovoltaic- <br>
<br>
driven system. During electrolysis, carbon may deposit on the electrodes, which decreases their efficiency, and eventually stops the process.<br>
<br>
Stevens et. al. [8] have shown a current reduction of 40% over 100 min for electrochemical reduction of CO2. According to these experiments, the maximum energy storage efficiency of CO gas (as fuel) was 35%.<br>
<br>
Photo-catalytic reduction to CO in high pressure has been investigated by Hori et al. [9] and the direct reduction of CO2 to methane gas was studied by Dey et al. [10]. These processes have low rate reduction and require costly and/or corrosive materials. There is a need in the art for a novel approach capable of providing an adequate solution for efficient, high rate production of clean and low-cost synthetic fuel.<br>
<br>
There is thus provided, according to one broad aspect of the invention, a system for producing one or more compounds with high chemical potential energy, the system comprising: an electron source including a cathode and configured and operable to emit electrons utilizing for example a thermionic (TI) effect; an electric field generator generating an electric field having an energy sufficient to dissociate CO2 and/or H2O reactant gas molecules; and an anode spaced apart from the cathode at a predetermined distance defining a reaction gas chamber configured and operable to cause interaction between the electrons with CO2 and/or H2O gas molecules via a dissociative electrons attachment (DEA) mechanism within the chamber, such that electrons having the required energy dissociate CO2 and/or H2O gas molecules into CO and/or H2 and O2. The reactant gas molecules are therefore at least one of CO2 and H2O and the product compounds are O2 and at least one of CO and H2.<br>
<br>
In some embodiments, the electric field generator is exposed to thermal energy emitted from at least one of the electron source and a thermal energy source.<br>
<br>
In some embodiments of the invention, the system includes a thermal energy source (heat source) configured and operable to supply thermal energy <br>
<br>
(radiation) to the electron source thereby raising the electron source temperature and generating thermionic (TI) electrons emission and/or to an electric field generator (e.g. single or plural thermoelectric devices and/or cascades, or a single or plural Stirling Engine) for generating an electric field. Therefore, in some embodiments, the electric field generator comprises at least one thermoelectric device and/or cascade of thermoelectric devices and operates for utilizing temperature difference generated by the thermal energy source. Alternatively, the electric field generator comprises at least one Stirling engine operating for utilizing temperature difference generated by the thermal energy source.<br>
<br>
In some embodiments of the invention, the system includes, instead of just the anode described above, an intermediate electrode adjacent to a gas components separator (e.g. a membrane), both placed in between the anode and the cathode. This configuration enables (a) an additional means of CO2 or H2O dissociation, via electrolysis, and (b) a means for separating between the product compounds of CO and H2 in one side, and O2 in the other side. Therefore, the intermediate electrode is configured and operable to dissociate the reactant gas molecules via electrolysis on the surface of the separator and the gas components separator is configured and operable to separate between O2 and the other product compounds.<br>
<br>
The inlet reactant gas is either CO2, or H2O or both. The CO2, and H2O may be introduced into the process on the same side of the separation membrane, or on opposite sides of it. The product compounds exiting the reaction chamber are either CO or H2, or a mixture of both of them. The ions conducted in the membrane are either negative oxygen ions, or protons (H+), or both. Oxygen molecules exit the system on the anode side.<br>
<br>
The present invention combines photo, thermal, electric and chemical (PTEC) processes to develop a new method, maximizing the efficiency and the conversion rate of thermal radiation to chemical potential, in the form of CO2 reduction to CO and O2 and H2O reduction to H2 and O2 in the same system. The <br>
<br>
dissociation of CO2 and H2O may occur in the same system simultaneously or either one of them can be preformed alone. The ratio of CO to H2 is controlled during the process and the mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen can be used directly as a synthesis gas (syn-gas) gaseous fuel (e.g. in power or chemical plants), or converted to methanol or other hydrocarbons, which can be used, for example, as transportation fuels. The CO2 and water generated during the burning of these fuels can be trapped, returned to the power plant and reduced again. This method enables clean fuel production on a very large-scale, wherever thermal energy is available. In some embodiments, the system comprises a gas components separator configured and operable to separate between the oxygen ions and CO and/or H2 molecules resulting from CO2 and/or H2O dissociation. The separator may comprise a membrane configured for allowing only certain gas component such as oxygen ions (CT) to pass therethrough (e.g. transmitting negative oxygen ions). Such membranes may be made of ceramic material, such as for example,<br>
<br>
Yitria Stabilized Zriconia (YSZ). Its surface facing the chamber containing CO2 has a cathode and the other surface has an anode to extract the electrons from the oxygen ions, attached to a means to transfer these electrons back to the cathode.<br>
<br>
In some embodiments of the invention, both the CO2 and the H2O are supplied to the system on the cathode side of the membrane. In this case, the separator is used to separate O~ ions from the H2 and CO; it conducts O~ ions from the cathode to the anode. The rates of CO2 and H2O dissociation are controlled by the working temperature and by. the flow rate of CO2 and H2O entering the cathode side. In another embodiment of the invention, the CO2 is supplied to the system on the cathode side of the membrane and H2O is supplied to the system on the anode side of the membrane. In this case, the separator can be used to separate H+ ions (protons) from OH". The same separator can be used to conduct simultaneously O~~ ions from the cathode to the anode side and H+ ions from the anode to the cathode side. These ion conductions can be done in both directions <br>
<br>
simultaneously, or in each direction separately. The rates of the O~ and H+ ion conductions are controlled by the working temperature and by the flow rate of CO2 on the cathode side and H2O on the anode side.<br>
<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the system includes a thermal energy source (heat source) configured and operable to supply thermal energy (e.g. concentrated sunlight radiation) to the heating elements of at least one Stirling engine, which generates an electric field at a relatively high efficiency.<br>
<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the system includes a separated means of generating the electric field (e.g. a separated solar electric generating system).<br>
<br>
The thermal (heat) source may include a solar energy collector, which may for example include a set of reflectors configured to collect sunlight radiation, concentrate it and reflect it towards the electron source.<br>
<br>
In some embodiments of the invention, the electron source includes a thermionic cathode or a photocathode. The thermionic cathode may be associated with the electric field generator or a separate electric field generator operable to apply an electric potential onto the electron source, reducing the potential barrier of the cathode and enhancing the number of emitted electrons.<br>
<br>
In some embodiments, the thermionic cathode is coated by a protective coating, to be protected from exposure to gaseous environment including CO2,<br>
<br>
CO, O~ and O2. The protective coating may include an oxide metal layer, and may be configured to enable electron transmission via tunneling by reducing the work function of the cathode.<br>
<br>
In some embodiments of the invention, the system includes a magnetic field source, operable to adjust the electron motion such that it maximizes the probability of the electron - CO2 dissociative attachment reaction.<br>
<br>
In some embodiments of the invention, the CO2 gas is pre-heated by the gases and/or by the hot-side of the reactor walls before entering the reaction chamber. <br>
<br>
In some embodiments of the invention, the CO2 gas is excited by exposure to at least one of radiation electron beam (e.g. from a laser source), magnetic field, and electric field, that increases its vibration energy as it enters the reaction chamber. This improves the probability of the electron - CO2 dissociative attachment reaction.<br>
<br>
Preferably, the system includes an electron collector configured and operable to collect the emitted electrons, which do not combine with the CO2 molecules.<br>
<br>
The system of the invention is operable with high heat-to-chemical potential conversion efficiency, estimated to reach above 40%, and is operable at temperatures in the range of about 6000C - 15000C.<br>
<br>
In some embodiments, the electron source, the electric field generator, the reaction gas chamber and the membrane are integrated in a single module (e.g. cell). According to another broad aspect of the present invention, there is also provided a system for producing one or more compounds with high chemical potential energy. The system comprises an electron source including a cathode and configured and operable to emit electrons; an electric field generator generating an electric field; an anode spaced apart from the cathode; an intermediate electrode and a gas components separator both placed in between the anode and the cathode; the intermediate electrode being configured and operable to dissociate the reactant gas molecules via electrolysis on the surface of the separator; the reactant gas molecules being at least one of CO2 and H2O, the product compounds are O2 and at least one of CO and H2 respectively. It should be noted that the system of the present invention provides one or more product compounds having relatively high energy of formation from one or more chemical compounds having relatively low energy of formation. The chemical potential energy of the product compounds can be transformed to other forms of energy such as heat, work or electricity by a chemical reaction. <br>
<br>
According to another broad aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for production of one or more compounds with high chemical potential energy. The method comprises supplying CO2 (e.g. by separating it from other combustion emission gases) and/or H2O reactant gas molecules to a reactor including a cathode an anode and a separator in between the anode and the cathode; applying an electric field between the anode and the cathode having an energy sufficient to dissociate reactant gas molecules via a dissociative electrons attachment (DEA) mechanism and/or to reduce the reactant gas molecules by electrolysis; separating between O2 and the other product compounds molecules; and discharging the product compounds molecules.<br>
<br>
The dissociation/reduction of CO2 to CO and O2 and Of H2O to H2 and O2 may be carried out as follows: an electron source comprising a thermionic cathode is heated by a heat source to release free electrons therefrom; electrons are emitted from the thermionic cathode using a thermionic (TI) effect; an electric field is generated such as to supply an energy field sufficient to dissociate gas molecules using dissociative attachment effect; introducing the electrons and the gas molecules into a reactor (e.g. reaction chamber), where the electrons dissociate gas molecules to the product compounds.<br>
<br>
The heating of the electron source preferably includes supplying thermal energy (e.g. solar radiation) to the electron source thereby raising the electron source temperature and generating thermionic electrons emission from the thermionic cathode. The generation of the electric field may include concentration of the thermal energy and directing it onto an electric field generator. The thermionic (TI) effect and the electric field generation may be activated by the same thermal energy source, e.g. a solar energy concentrator. The latter may include collection of sunlight radiation, concentration thereof and reflection towards the electron source.<br>
<br>
In some embodiments of the invention, gas molecules may be pre-heated before their introduction into the reaction chamber. The pre-heating of gas <br>
<br>
molecules may be performed using the same thermal energy source operable to activate the thermionic (TI) effect and the electric field generation, for example using at least one heat exchanger.<br>
<br>
The number of emitted electrons may be enhanced by applying an electric field to the electron source.<br>
<br>
The negative oxygen ions may be conducted through a membrane towards an electron collector; the excess electrons released by the oxygen ions may be combined to form O2 molecules; and the electrons may be recycled back to the electron source. Additionally, the electrons, which did not interact with gas molecules, may also be recycled.<br>
<br>
In some embodiments, the electric field may be used to perform electrolysis of the gas (CO2 and/or H2O) on the surface of the membrane, either subsequent to or independent of the dissociative attachment process. The oxygen ions are then conducted through the membrane follow the electrolysis. The method comprises supplying the CO2 and H2O gas molecules on the same side of the separator, or on opposite sides of the separator.<br>
<br>
In some embodiments, the CO2 is introduced on the cathode side of the membrane, while the H2O is introduced on the anode side of the membrane. In this case, the dissociations of CO2 and H2O take place on opposite sides of the membrane and the membrane conducts oxygen ions from the cathode to the anode and protons (H+) from the anode to the cathode.<br>
<br>
In some embodiments, the method comprises CO2 trapping by separating CO2 from other combustion emission gases and recycling.<br>
<br>
The method may comprise coating at least a part of the thermionic cathode to enable electron transmission via tunneling.<br>
<br>
In other embodiments, the method comprises exposing the gas molecules to a radiation or an electrons beam, magnetic, or electric field (e.g. fluctuating field at different orientation) to increase the vibration energy of the gas molecules. <br>

<br>
electrons are collected and returned to the electron source 112. The system components are integrated in a compact cell. By coupling energy conversion methods, the system of the present invention utilizes nearly all the input energy (minus re-radiation losses) in either its thermal, electric or chemical conversion mechanisms.<br>
<br>
The solar energy collector 110 may include one or more reflectors (e.g. mirrors) which collect and concentrate sunlight, and reflect it towards the electron source 112 to raise its temperature. As illustrated in the example of Fig. IB, the solar energy collector 110 may include a single mirror shaped as a parabolic dish. It should be understood that any other heat source that can provide the required temperature and energy flux to the electron source could be used instead of solar radiation.<br>
<br>
The electron source may be a high efficiency electron source using the thermionic effect, operating in a CO2/CO/O2/O" gas surrounding. The thermionic effect refers to the thermionic emission of a flow of charged electrons from a heated surface, caused by thermal vibrational energy, overcoming the electrostatic forces holding electrons to the surface. The electron source may be formed by a thermionic cathode associated with an appropriate electric field enhancing the electron emission. The required temperatures may be achieved by concentrating solar radiation towards the cathode.<br>
<br>
The lifetime of some of these cathodes can be thousands of hours, but in some cases they should preferably be protected (e.g. by coating) from exposure to a gaseous environment. Some of these high current cathode materials are sensitive to carbon dioxide, carbon-monoxide, oxygen and hydrogen. The cathode may therefore be coated with a thin oxide layer of a few nanometers to protect its surface from atoms and ions bombardment. Furthermore, the coating may enable electron transmission via tunneling, assuring that the effective work function is reduced, while protecting the thermionic material from reaction chamber gases, namely CO2, CO, O" and O2. Several combinations of metals and their oxides may be used; such as Al/Aluminum oxide/Au or Al combinations, <br>
<br>
Ta/Tantalum oxide/Pt combination, Titanium/Titanium-oxide,<br>
<br>
Scandium/Scandium-oxide, Zirconium/Zirconium-oxide, Tungsten/Tungsten- oxide, and Hafnium/Hafnium-oxide. Other combinations like Tungsten/Scandium oxide and Lanthanum Hexaboride/oxide are also possible. Carbides, nitrides and other materials may also be used as thermionic electron sources (cathodes).<br>
<br>
It should be noted that the number of emitted electrons is increased when the electric field, e.g. between the cathode 112 and the intermediate electrode 117, is increased. The electric field reduces the potential barrier of the cathode surface and then, more electrons can escape from the cathode surface. The applied voltage determines the electron energy. The characteristics of the barrier, after applying the electric field, depend on the field intensity, the distance between the cathode and the anode, the coating thickness and the dielectric constant. The tunneling distance also depends on the electrons energy. The number of electrons passing through this oxide metal layer by tunneling depends on the oxide (insulator) layer width and on the electric field applied on the layer. As the temperature increases, the Fermi energy distribution is changed, increasing the energy of the electrons, which increases their tunneling probability. The cathode-anode distance should allow creation of a sufficiently high electric field inside the insulator, but the field should not be higher than the breakdown value. The desired electric field can be obtained by varying the field voltage and the cathode-anode spacing.<br>
<br>
It should also be noted that different thermionic cathode/coating combinations having different electron emission capability as a function of temperature, applied voltage, electric field intensity and the adjacent medium (vacuum, inert gas, CO2 gas) may be used. The working temperatures may be in the range of about 6000C- 15000C. Each of these thermionic cathode/coating combinations has different potential barrier, which yields different electron tunneling probability for a given applied electric field. For a maximum dissociative probability of the CO2 molecule, the electron should have energy of <br>
<br>
about 4.4 eV. After the release of the electrons, if the applied voltage is higher than needed (4.4 V), another set of decelerating electric fields can be applied to reach the needed electron energy.<br>
<br>
Since the system operates at high temperatures (6000C - 15000C)5 the electric field generator (e.g. a thermoelectric device or a Stirling engine) may generate the electric field needed for the Thermo-Field (T-F) emission (i.e. the combined effect of temperature and electric field emission). The use of a thermoelectric or a Stirling engine device in combination with the thermionic cathode enables: (f) operation at high temperature and (if) use of the excess thermal energy generated from the thermionic cathode to heat the thermoelectric device or a Stirling engine, which generate electric potential, and then the inlet gas. A Stirling engine, which has a relatively high heat-to-electricity conversion efficiency, could be used instead of the thermoelectric cascade. By properly combining the various energy conversion processes, the system efficiency is maximized.<br>
<br>
The free electrons, energized by the electric field, enter the main chamber, where they collide with heated reactant gas molecules (CO2 and/or H2O). At least a portion of the thermal energy may be used to heat the reactant gas, to emit electrons from the electron source and to generate electric potential in the electric field generator. The product compounds leaving the system can also be used to pre-heat the incoming reactant gas. When the electrons impact the gas molecule, the dissociative attachment process described by equations (3 a) and (3b) above is initiated and CO and/or H2 are produced. The product O~ ions exit chamber 116 via the separator 118, which is in the form of a gas separation membrane (based on electric field separation). The CO and/or H2 exit the system directly from the main chamber 116. The electrons energy level is raised to energy cross-section required for the DEA reaction by the electrical field generator and the electron source. The electron energy cross section determines the probability of the process to occur. The electron energy cross sections peak at 4.4eV, 8.8eV and 13.2eV. Between these values, the probability drops sharply. For high <br>
<br>
temperature (1200K), the probability of 4.4eV and 8.8eV are about the same. Therefore, the preferable choice for the electron energy is the lower energy requirement (4.4eV).<br>
<br>
The number of electrons combining with the CO2 and/or H2O and creating O~ ions should be maximized. Electrons, which do not combine with the gas by dissociative attachment, can react with the CO2 and/or H2O by means of electrolysis on the intermediate electrode 117. Electrons are separated from the ions and collected on the electron collector (anode) 120 and returned to the electron source 112. It is desirable that only electrons from the O" ions would reach that stage.<br>
<br>
Recombination and other adverse reactions such as the following reactions (4-6), should be avoided:<br>
<br>
CO + O- =&gt; CO2 +e~ (4)<br>
<br>
O~ + 2CO2 =&gt; CO~ + CO2 (5) CO; +CO =&gt; 2CO2 + e~ (6)<br>
<br>
To this end, the CO must be separated from the O~ ions. This can be done using ceramics membrane materials, which allow only certain atoms (e.g. oxygen ions) to pass through them. Yitria stabilized Zriconia (YSZ) can be used to conduct oxygen molecules for CO/O~ separation. The oxygen ions are then separated from the CO molecules by applying an electric field. The CO molecules continue their trajectory while the oxygen ions are drawn through the YSZ membrane towards the anode. The drift velocity of the ions should allow higher diffusion rate than their production in main chamber 116. When reaching the anode 120, the electrons are dissociated from the O~ ions and pass therethrough back to the electron source 112. The oxygen is then separated from the CO. O2 molecules are formed, once the surplus electrons are given up and exit the system adjacent to the anode 120.<br>
<br>
YSZ and other ceramics membranes can conduct electrons at a certain temperature range. It should be noted that other materials, such as the combination of Pt-YSZ, might be useful in the process together with, or instead <br>
<br>
of YSZ. Mn/Fe-based perovskite type oxide having high oxygen permeability at high temperature can also be used. In the DEA process, the membrane oxygen permeability rate should be higher than the O~ ions production rate.<br>
<br>
It should be noted that as the temperature increases, the mobility of the oxygen is increased. A stronger electric field also increases the ions mobility and therefore the ability to separate them from the CO gas. At energy levels lower than 5eV, the probability that other processes, besides (4)-(6), would occur is very low (the cross section for electron attachment is too low). To have a maximum attachment cross section, the electron energy required in the system of the present invention is about 5eV.<br>
<br>
Electrolysis can take place across the intermediate electrode 117, the separator 118 and the anode 120 in two ways:<br>
<br>
(a) Both CO2 and H2O are introduced into the main chamber 116. Then, preferably but not necessarily, following the dissociative electrons attachment (DEA), CO2 and H2O molecules that remain in the chamber are dissociated via electrolysis. The product O" is conducted through the membrane, while the CO and H2 exit the main chamber.<br>
<br>
(b) CO2 is introduced to the main chamber 116, while H2O is entered into the chamber on the anode side of the membrane. O~ resulting from CO2 dissociation is then conducted through the membrane from the intermediate electrode to the anode, while H+ is conducted in the opposite direction, from the anode to the cathode, as illustrated in Fig. IB. It should be understood that the conduction of O~ and H+ are taking place in different mechanisms, which do not compete with one another. One the protons reach the intermediate electrode 117 they react with electrons and recombine to form H2, which exits in the system together with the CO.<br>
<br>
Reference is made to Fig. 2 schematically representing an example of a method of the invention for producing fuel, and the efficiencies of the various steps. In some embodiments, the method uses concentrated solar radiation for reducing CO2 to CO via a combination of dissociative electrons attachment <br>
<br>
(DEA) and high temperature electrolysis. This technique combines photo, thermal, electric and chemical processes to maximize the efficiency and the conversion rate of solar radiation to chemical potential in the form of CO2 reduction to CO and O2. More specifically, an electron/electricity process occurs by photons (sun power) interaction with a thermionic cathode, resulting in emission of electrons (step 1), and thermoelectric generation of an appropriate electric field (step 2) to thereby supply the required energy field. Then, the fuel synthesis occurs, including CO2 reduction by the dissociative attachment of electrons (eq. 3a-3b above) (step 3) and electrolysis (step 4), followed by separation of CO and oxygen, de-ionization of the oxygen ions and recycling these electrons (step 5), resulting in the CO fuel formation. The same process can be done for water dissociation, either separate from, or simultaneously with the CO2 dissociation process.<br>
<br>
As indicated above, carbon monoxide and/or hydrogen can then be used directly as a gaseous fuel (e.g. in power or chemical plants) or converted to methanol or hydrocarbons. The CO2 generated during the burning of these fuels is trapped, returned to the power plant and reduced again.<br>
<br>
Thus, according to the invention, the reduction of CO2 to CO and O2 is performed via dissociative electrons attachment method (DEA) and high temperature electrolysis, using a series of coupled energy conversion steps.<br>
<br>
The conversion of concentrated solar energy to free electrons with prescribed energy by combining thermionic and either several thermoelectric stages or Stirling engine, is most efficient when the upper temperature is in the range of about 1000°C-1400°C. The dissociative electrons attachment (DEA) process then uses the free electrons, which interact with the gas molecules. Some of these steps are actually done in mass spectrometers and similar devices that produce negative or positive ions in high vacuum. The efficiency of the process is enabled by the use of concentrated solar energy (the required concentration ration would typically be larger than 2000), the use of high temperature (T=IOOO- 14000C), and the coupling of several energy conversion steps to minimize losses, <br>
<br>
and the use of the best fitted materials for the thermionic cathode and the membrane adjacent to the anode.<br>
<br>
A similar method can be used for water splitting via reaction (3b): Processes (3 a) and (3b) are both in the gas phase and use free electrons at a specific energy range (cross section) to create a negative molecule. The molecule is then dissociated to produce a fuel such as H2 or CO. Molecules that were not dissociated via DEA can be dissociated via electrolysis. Negative oxygen ions are separated from the fuel (CO &amp; H2), and the electrons are released and circulated back to start the process over. The thermionic (TI) and electric field generations processes are arranged as a combined cycle (the region surrounded by a dash-line in Fig. 2), meaning the heat that is not utilized by TI process can be used at a lower temperature for the electric field generator. The electron energy and the electric potential are then used to initiate the dissociative attachment (DEA) process of pre-heated CO2, the subsequent electrolysis, and the separation of the O~ from the CO and/or H2. Thus, the energy is converted to chemical potential in the form of fuel made of CO and/or H2.<br>

The combined cycle efficiency is: ?cc = ?T? + ?TE - ?T? ¦ ?TE (9) where the thermionic efficiency is marked as ?T? and the thermoelectric efficiency is marked as ?TE .<br>

The thermoelectric efficiency ?TE is the electrical power generated by the thermoelectric generator divided by the incoming heat rate that reaches it from <br>
<br>
the TI cathode (e.g. via re-radiation, etc.), or directly from the heat source (e.g. solar radiation). The electrical work is used to provide the electrons (from the TI cathode) with the needed kinetic energy: The fuel production process includes the DEA, the electrolysis and the separation processes, has an efficiency defined as:<br>

<br>
The optical efficiency of the solar concentrator ?OPT is defined as the power of the radiation reaching the thermionic surface, divided by the solar radiation upon the concentrator: <br>
The maximum system efficiency can be estimated with the following assumptions. For a solar flux of 1000 W/m2, and a total current of 200 A (assuming 20 A/cm2) and assuming that ?Fue? = 1 , 1H OPT = 0.9 , the theoretical system efficiency will be 55%. For a total current of 300 A (30 A/cm2), the maximum theoretical efficiency will increase to 84%.<br>
<br>
It is useful to compare the efficiency of the process of the present invention to that of CO2 or H2O reduction via electrolysis only, without the other components of the present invention. In the latter, the maximum efficiency depends on the efficiency of the electricity production. For example, if the maximum efficiency of a solar-driven electricity generation would reach about 40% (which is very high relative to existing methods), the system efficiency of fuel production via electrolysis could then reach about 35%. Therefore, the efficiency of the system of the present invention is considerably higher than that of CO2 or H2O electrolysis.<br>
<br>
Reference is made to Fig. 3 presenting an example of a configuration of a module of the system of the present invention. It should be noted that the system module 200 does not include a solar energy collector, although the system configuration allows its addition later. The figure illustrates the dissociation of CO2 and H2O in the same system.<br>
<br>
The system 200 includes an electron source including a thermionic cathode 202 exposed to concentrated sunlight, (an electric field generator illustrated by a thermoelectric element 214 or a cascade of several such elements, or another device such as Stirling engine (e.g. free piston), an intermediate <br>
<br>
electrode 204A spaced from the cathode 202 at a predetermined distance defining a main reaction chamber zone, a separator illustrated by a YSZ membrane 206, and the anode 204B. The anode 204B is used to separate H+ ions (protons) from OHT. The membrane 206 is used to conduct O~ ions from the intermediate electrode 204A to the anode 204B, and H+ ions from the anode 204B to the intermediate electrode 204A. CO2 inlet 208A and H2O inlet 207A are provided for supplying the CO2 gas and the H2O gas respectively. The inlet gases flow first via a first heat exchanger 210B, where they are heated by the exiting O2, and then through a second heat exchanger 210A, where they are heated by the existing syngas (mixture of CO and H2). Further downstream, the inlet gases enter the housing of the module, flowing adjacent to the hot internal components (e.g. 214) and are further heated before the CO2 enters the main reaction zone between the thermionic cathode 202 and intermediate electrode 204A, while the H2O enters the reaction zone adjacent to Anode 204B. Outlet 209A exits the product syngas (CO and H2) to storage via the heat exchanger 210A. Outlet 209B exits the O2 to storage via the second heat exchanger 210B.<br>
<br>
The distance between the intermediate electrode 204A and the cathode 202 may be changed to adjust the influence of the electric field and the applied potential. The intermediate electrode 204A enables the performance of electrolysis and the adjustment of the electric fields in the reaction zone (between 202 and 204A) and across the membrane (between 204A and 204B). The system 200 may be designed to operate under pressures of 0.1-10 atmospheres and at temperatures of 600°- 15000C. The anode 204 is connected to the cathode 202 to recycle the electrons. An electric field may be generated from an external power source and controlled independently, either in addition to or without using the electric field generator 214. The thermoelectric (TE) or Stirling generator 214 may be heated, either from an independent source, or by re-radiation from the thermionic cathode to then generate the required electric potential. The cathode should have a high current density and be able to sustain many hours of <br>
<br>
continuous work at high temperature. The current density depends on the temperature and the electric field.<br>
<br>
Reference is made to Fig. 4 illustrating one possible way of using CO gas produced in the method of the present invention. CO may be produced by using CO2 supplied by emission of a turbine using solar energy and the method of the present invention. After exiting the production stage, the CO is stored and used as a combustion fuel to drive the turbine and generate electricity. The CO2 formed in the combustion process is then returned to the CO production stage, and so on. Figs 5, 6 and 7 provide a sample of the data obtained from measurements with the main components of the system of the present invention.<br>
<br>
Reference is made to Fig. 5 illustrating laboratory measurements of I-V (Current- Voltage) curves in an electrolytic cell, configured by using the teachings of the present invention. The current is generated by the conduction of oxygen through the separating membrane and therefore indicates the rate of CO2 reduction via the electrolysis. A remarkable increase in the reaction rate occurs as the temperature increases from 6400C (Curves D and G) to 9500C (Curves C, E and F). A smaller increase is seen as the temperature increases from 9500C to 12500C and 14000C (curves B and A, respectively). The cell improvement indicated in the figure legend is primarily in the intermediate electrode and the anode. As described above, the system of the present invention may combine this electrolysis cell with a thermionic cathode and reaction chamber. Measurements with these components are presented in Fig.6.<br>
<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 6A and 6B illustrating a thermionic Electron Emission from a cathode made of CeB6 into CO2 gas at a temperature of 11500C (6A) and at a temperature of 13200C (6B). The current ratios refer to the electron current at a given test pressure, relative to the current at the maximum vacuum used in the measurements. The graphs show the ability of a cell based on the principles of the present invention to efficiently emit electrons using the thermionic effect at a pressure of up to one atmosphere. The reduction of current <br>
<br>
with increasing pressure is relatively small, indicating that operation at -lbar is feasible.<br>
<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 7 illustrating the evolution of CO and H2 concentration inside an electrolytic reaction cell. The test temperature in this case is 6500C. At the beginning of the tests, the reaction cell is evacuated and then is filled with CO2 at about 1.1 bars. As the temperature is increased and the electric potential is applied, the CO concentration in the cell increases over time. In this test, the cell is surrounded by air with a humidity of about 9.5gram-H2O per 1 kg- air. As seen in the figure, the concentration of H2 inside the cell also increases due to electrolysis of the H2O in the surrounding air and conduction of protons through the membrane into the cell. <br>
