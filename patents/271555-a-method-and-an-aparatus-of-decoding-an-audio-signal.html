MODE FOR INVENTION<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred<br>
embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are<br>
illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
First of all, 'coding' in the present invention should<br>
be understood as the concept including both encoding and<br>
decoding.<br>
Secondly, 'information' in this disclosure is the<br>
terminology that covers values, parameters, coefficients,<br>
elements and the like and may be interpreted different in<br>
some cases, by which examples of the present invention are<br>
non-limited. Although a stereo signal is used as an example<br>
for an audio signal in this disclosure, the audio signal can<br>
have at least three or more channels.<br>
In general, in case of using an output unit having a<br>
stereo channel for a stereo signal, a listener receives an<br>
audio signal from left and right channels. The audio signal<br>
can be mainly divided into a left channel signal and a right<br>
channel signal. Each of the channel signals can include a<br>
having directionality and an ambient component signal giving<br>
a stereo effect without directionality.<br>
For instance, the source component signal can be a<br>
sound of a singer on a stage, a sound of a musical<br>
instrument on a stage or the like for example. In case of<br>
movie, the source component signal can be conversations<br>
performed in front of listener, various sound effects or the<br>
like to enable the listener to sense a direction of the<br>
sound. On the contrary, the ambient component signal can<br>
include reverberant sound attributed to a listener-located<br>
physical environment, a sound of applause of audience, noise<br>
or the like. And, the ambient component signal play a role<br>
in enabling a listener to sense a feeling for a currently-<br>
located space, a stereo effect or the like. Namely, the<br>
source component signal is a signal heard in a specific<br>
direction and is generally generated in front of a listener.<br>
And, the ambient component signal is the sound heard in all<br>
directions without directionality.<br>
The terminology 'front' used in this disclosure<br>
indicates a front side or a fore side. For instance, a front<br>
of a device(or unit) indicates a fore side seen by a screen<br>
part of the device(or unit). Disposing an output device(or<br>
unit) in a lateral rear side means that the output device(or<br>
unit) is disposed to have an output direction of 45°~135°<br>
with reference to a plane in which a screen part of a<br>
decoding device of an audio signal exists. And, disposing an<br>
output unit in a lateral front side means that the output<br>
device(or unit) is disposed to have an output direction of<br>
0°~45o or 135°~180° with reference to a plane in which a<br>
screen part of a decoding device of an audio signal exists.<br>
FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 are schematic diagrams of a general<br>
stereo recording environment.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, it is able to record a signal of a<br>
stereo channel by setting environment and position at which<br>
a listener can be located. Referring to FIG. 2, after<br>
signals have been acquired from an entity generating a<br>
source component signal using sever microphones, it is able<br>
to generate a stereo signal by mixing the acquired signals<br>
appropriately using a mixer.<br>
FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram for arrangement of a<br>
general output unit for outputting a stereo signal recorded<br>
by the method shown in FIG. 1 or FIG. 2.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, when a stereo signal is reproduced,<br>
since an output unit(30a, 30b) of a stereo signal is<br>
generally located in front of a listener, the listener<br>
recognizes the stereo signal as if all sounds come from a<br>
front side. In this case, although a source component signal<br>
located in front is delivered to the listener without<br>
distortion, it is unable to deliver the ambient component<br>
signal coming from lateral and rear sides of the listener in<br>
a recording environment. Of course, as a stereo signal<br>
outputted from an output unit(30a, 30b) is reflected or<br>
absorbed in accordance with a listener-located environment,<br>
a reverberant sound can be heard. Yet, this is different<br>
from the ambient component signal of the recording<br>
environment. Hence, the listener is unable to listen to the<br>
ambient component signal in recording.<br>
In an apparatus for decoding an audio signal and method<br>
thereof according to the present invention, ambient<br>
component signal included in a stereo signal is extracted<br>
and used. Therefore, it is able to obtain an audio signal<br>
having a stereo effect enhanced.<br>
FIG. 4 is a schematic diagram for a method of<br>
outputting an audio signal according to one embodiment of<br>
the present invention.<br>
As mentioned in the foregoing description, a source<br>
component signal has the characteristic of directionality,<br>
whereas an ambient component signal does not have the<br>
directionality. A listener is able to recognize the<br>
directionality when the same signal arrives at both ears of<br>
the listener with either a level difference or a time<br>
difference or with both of the level difference and the time<br>
difference. Hence, the source component signal having the<br>
directionality has high correlation between two channels<br>
including the source component signal, whereas the ambient<br>
component signal enables the two channels to have low<br>
correlation. In order to extract the ambient component<br>
signal, a method of decoding an audio signal according to<br>
one embodiment of the present invention extracts component<br>
signals having low inter-channel correlation from component<br>
signals included in a stereo channel.<br>
In FIG. 4, a source component signal s indicates a<br>
signal that represents a direct sound located in a direction<br>
determined by a gain factor a. Ambient component signals n1<br>
and n2 indicate an ambient sound in a recording environment.<br>
And, 'x1' and 'x2' indicate output signals of left and right<br>
channels of the stereo signal, respectively. Moreover, the<br>
stereo signal can be outputted to the stereo channel with<br>
specific direction information. And, the direction<br>
information can include level difference information, time<br>
difference information or the like. On the contrary, the<br>
ambient component signal can be determined by a reproduction<br>
environment, an auditory sensible width, or the like. The<br>
output signals shown in FIG. 4 can be represented as Formula<br>
1 using the source component signal s, the ambient component<br>
signals n1 and n2 and the gain factor a for determining a<br>
direction of the source component signal.<br><br>
In order to effectively analyze a non-linear stereo<br>
signal including a plurality of simultaneously activated<br>
object signals, Formula 1 should be independently analyzed<br>
using plurally divided frequency bands and time domain. In<br>
this case, the X1(n) and X2(n) can be represented as follows.<br><br>
The 'i' indicates a frequency band index and the 'k'<br>
indicates a time band index.<br>
FIG. 5 is a graph of a time-frequency domain for<br>
analyzing a stereo signal. Each time-frequency domain<br>
includes indexes i and k. And, a source component signal S,<br>
ambient component signals N1 and N2 and a gain factor A can<br>
be independently estimated. In the following description,<br>
the frequency band index i and the time band index k shall<br>
be omitted.<br>
And, it is able use such a signal model as Formula 3.<br>
[Formula 3]<br><br>
In this case, h_head_Li and h_head _Ri correspond to<br>
head parts of a transfer function indicating a relation that<br>
an ith entity is included in channels L and R.<br>
h_tail_Li and h_tail_Ri correspond to tail parts of the<br>
transfer function and include reverberant components of s_i<br>
introduced into the respective channels. And, '*' indicates<br>
convolution. In this case, the ambient component signal<br>
corresponds to of the right side in Formula 3.<br>
Besides, mathematical modeling of the source component<br>
signal and the ambient component signal is possible through<br>
various signal models. Yet, in the audio signal decoding<br>
apparatus and method of the present invention, the source<br>
component signal and the ambient component signal are<br>
estimated and modified using the signal model represented as<br>
Formula 1 and Formula 2, which non-limits various examples<br>
of the present invention.<br>
A bandwidth of a frequency band for analysis of a<br>
stereo signal can be selected to be equal to that of a<br>
specific band and can be determined according to<br>
characteristics of the stereo signal. In each frequency band,<br>
S, N1, N2 and A can be estimated per t millisecond. If X1 and<br>
X2 are given as stereo signal, estimated values of S, N1, N2<br>
and A can be determined according to the analysis per time-<br>
frequency domain. And, a power of X1 can be estimated as<br>
Formula 4.<br>
[Formula 4]<br><br>
In Formula 4, E{.} indicates an average.<br>
Assume that powers of N1 and N2 are equal to each other.<br>
And, assume that the dependent signals having external<br>
influence have the same power in left and right channels of<br>
a stereo channel ( PN = PN1 = PN2 ) .<br>
Besides Pn=Pn1=Pn2, it is able to use such assumption<br>
as A2PN1=PN2 and the like for example.<br>
Moreover, if a stereo signal is represented as time-<br>
frequency domain, it is able to estimate gain information<br>
(A), power of source component signal (Ps) , power of ambient<br>
component signal (PN) and normalized cross-correlation (F).<br>
The normalized cross-correlation (F) between stereo channels<br>
can be represented as Formula 5.<br><br>
It is able to determine A,PS,PN using PX1,PX2,F . And the<br>
relation formula for the PX1,PX2,F can be represented as<br>
Formula 6.<br>
[Formula 6]<br><br>
Formula 6 is summarized for A,PS,PN into Formula 7.<br>
[Formula 7]<br><br>
And, values of the B and C can be represented as<br>
Formula 8.<br>
[Formula 8]<br><br>
Source component signal S and minimum square estimated<br>
values of N1 and N2 are calculated as the function of A , Ps<br>
and pN. And, for each of the i and the k, the source<br>
component signal S can be estimated as follows.<br>
[Formula 9]<br><br>
In Formula 9, ?1, and ?2 are real weights. In this case,<br>
estimation error can be represented as Formula 10.<br>
[Formula 10]<br><br>
The weights ?1 and ?2 become optimal on a least mean<br>
square when the estimation error E is orthogonal to X1 and X2.<br>
[Formula 11]<br><br>
Namely, when E{EX1}=0 and E{EX2}=0 , it is able to<br>
obtain two equations of Formula 12 from Formula 10 and<br>
Formula 11.<br>
[Formula 12]<br><br>
From Formula 12, the weights ?1, and ?2 can be<br>
calculated into Formula 13.<br>
[Formula 13]<br><br>
Similarly, N1 and N2 can be estimated. The estimated<br>
value of N1 is represented as Formula 14.<br>
[Formula 14]<br><br>
And, estimation error can be calculated as follows.<br>
[Formula 15]<br><br>
The weights ?1 and ?2 are calculated into Formula 16 in<br>
a manner that the estimation error E is orthogonal to X1 and<br>
X2.<br><br>
Moreover, the estimation value of N2 is calculated in a<br>
manner similar to that of N1. The N2 is represented as<br>
Formula 17 and weights of the N2 are calculated as Formula<br>
18.<br><br>
Thus, after minimum square estimation values of <br>
and have been calculated, they are post-scaled so that<br>
powers of the estimation values become<br>
identical to Ps and PN=PN1=PN2 . The power of Ps can be<br>
represented as Formula 19.<br>
[Formula 19]<br><br>
In order to obtain the estimation value of S having the<br>
power shown in Formula 19, is called as Formula 20.<br>
[Formula 20]<br><br>
In the same manner for can be scaled as<br>
Formula 21 and Formula 22.<br><br>
Meanwhile, FIGs. 6 to 10 are graphs of relations of<br>
various variables calculated until the are<br>
obtained. First of all, the normalized power of the gain<br>
factors A, S and AS ca be represented as a function of the<br>
level difference of stereo signal and the normalized cross-<br>
correlation F. This is shown in FIG. 6.<br>
In FIG. 7, weights ?1 and ?2 for calculating minimum<br>
square estimation value of S are represented as a function<br>
of the level difference of stereo signal and the normalized<br>
cross-correlation F and are shown on the two upper graphs,<br>
respectively. And, a post-scaling factor for in Formula 19<br>
is represented as a lower graph in FIG. 7.<br>
In FIG. 8, weights ?3 and ?4 for calculating minimum<br>
square estimation value of N1 are represented as a function<br>
of the level difference of stereo signal and the normalized<br>
cross-correlation F and are shown on the two upper graphs,<br>
respectively. And, a post-scaling factor for in Formula<br>
19 is represented as a lower graph in FIG. 8.<br>
In FIG. 9, weights ?s and ?6 for calculating minimum<br>
square estimation value of N2 are represented as a function<br>
of the level difference of stereo signal and the normalized<br>
cross-correlation F and are shown on the two upper graphs,<br>
respectively. And, a post-scaling factor for in Formula<br>
19 is represented as a lower graph in FIG. 9.<br>
FIG. 10 is a graph of ambient decomposition of a stereo<br>
signal (e.g., folk song) including voice (e.g., vocal,<br>
voice) listened at a center when the stereo signal is<br>
outputted via an output unit. And, the estimated s , A , n1<br>
and n2 are shown in FIG. 10. A source component signal S<br>
(e.g., vocal) and ambient component signals n1 and n2 (e.g.,<br>
BGM) are depicted on a time domain. And, a gain factor A is<br>
depicted on all time-frequency tiles.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, compared to the ambient component<br>
signals n1 and n2 , the estimated source component signal S is<br>
observed as relatively strong. This matches the fact that<br>
the source component signal is dominant at the center in<br>
recording. Thus, it is apparent to those skilled in the art<br>
that the source and ambient component signals included in<br>
recording a stereo signal can be estimated by the audio<br>
signal decoding method according to the present invention.<br>
As mentioned in the above description, an apparatus for<br>
decoding an audio signal according to the present invention<br>
estimates ambient component signals and a source component<br>
signal, extracts the ambient component signal using the<br>
estimated signals, and then modifies the extracted ambient<br>
component signal. Therefore, it is able to obtain an audio<br>
signal of which stereo effect is further enhanced.<br>
FIG. 11 is a schematic block diagram of an apparatus<br>
1100 for decoding an audio signal according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
First of all, an audio signal receiving unit 1110<br>
receives an audio signal inputted from an outside of the<br>
audio signal decoding apparatus. The inputted audio signal<br>
includes a plurality of channels which may correspond to a<br>
stereo channel or a multi-channel including at least three<br>
channels. And, the audio signal can include ambient<br>
component signals and source component signals. And, theses<br>
signals can be included to correspond to the channels,<br>
respectively. For instance, in case that the audio signal<br>
includes two source component signals (e.g., vocall and<br>
vocal2), each of the source component signals is included in<br>
the corresponding channel with a time difference and/or a<br>
level difference.<br>
An ambient component signal extracting unit 1120<br>
receives the audio signal and then extracts the ambient<br>
component signal of each of the channels based on<br>
correlation between the signals included to correspond to<br>
each other. In doing so, the ambient component signal<br>
extracting unit 1120 is able to estimate the ambient<br>
component signal using Formulas 1 to 22, by which examples<br>
of the present invention are non-limited. The correlation<br>
used in extracting the ambient component signal can be<br>
estimated each predetermined time or each predetermined<br>
frequency band. Generally, the ambient component signal has<br>
low correlation between component signals included in each<br>
channel, whereas the source component signal has high<br>
correlation.<br>
An ambient component signal modifying unit 1130<br>
receives the extracted ambient component signal and is then<br>
able to modify the ambient component signal to have a<br>
prescribed stereo effect using surround effect information.<br>
In this case, the surround effect information can be<br>
included in a bitstream indicating the audio signal inputted<br>
to the audio signal receiving unit 1110 or can be stored in<br>
the ambient component signal modifying unit 1130 of the<br>
audio signal decoding apparatus of the present invention.<br>
Besides, the surround effect information can be inputted by<br>
a listener via a listener inputting device (not shown in the<br>
drawing).<br>
The surround effect information can include level<br>
information applied to the ambient component signal or at<br>
least one of a delay effect, a filter and a gain value. By<br>
modifying the ambient component signal, it is able to<br>
improve the degradation of the stereo effect generated when<br>
the stereo signal, as shown in FIG. 3, is reproduced in the<br>
front side only. The level information enables the<br>
generation of an ambient component signal, of which level is<br>
low or is modified large by applying a level size of the<br>
extracted ambient component signal. The surround effect<br>
information can be phase information applied to the ambient<br>
component signal. And, the phase information can enhance the<br>
stereo effect of the ambient component signal by adjusting a<br>
phase of the ambient component signal. In particular, it is<br>
able to enhance the stereo effect of the audio signal by<br>
increasing reverberation in a manner of delaying an output<br>
of the ambient component signal by applying a delay effect,<br>
which is an example of the surround effect information, to<br>
the ambient component signal. The corresponding detailed<br>
functions and roles of the ambient component signal<br>
modifying unit 1130 will be explained with reference to FIG.<br>
audio signal receiving unit 1110 can include flag<br>
information indicating whether the signal output unit 1150<br>
outputs at least one of the source component signal and the<br>
audio signal. The signal output unit 1150 can include a<br>
single output unit or can include at least two output units.<br>
In case that the signal output unit 1150 includes the at<br>
least two output units, functions and configurations of the<br>
output units may differ from each other and can be disposed<br>
in various configurations. Details regarding the signal<br>
output unit 1150 will be explained with reference to FIGs.<br>
16 to 25 later.<br>
In an apparatus for decoding an audio signal according<br>
to another embodiment of the present invention, the ambient<br>
information signal modifying unit 1130 applies a filter,<br>
which is an example of the surround effect information, to<br>
an ambient information signal is then able to modify a<br>
stereo signal outputted by the signal output unit 1150 to be<br>
similar to a signal (L0R0 ) of a general 5.1-channel output<br>
signal listened to by a listener.<br>
FIG. 12 is a diagram for a general 5.1-channel<br>
configuration and a path of a signal introduced into a<br>
listener. As shown in FIG. 12, GX_Y indicates a transfer<br>
function for transferring a signal to a ear Y from a speaker<br>
X. For instance, GL_R indicates a transfer function for a<br>
sound of a channel L to enter a right ear of a listener and<br>
GC_R indicates a transfer function for a sound of a channel<br>
C to enter a right ear of a listener. And, the GX_Y is named<br>
a head-related transfer function (hereinafter called 'HRTF').<br>
The signals (L0R0) entering the listener's ears can be<br>
represented as Formula 23 with reference to FIG. 12.<br><br>
By referring to this, a stereo signal (L',R' ) outputted<br>
from the audio signal decoding apparatus of the present<br>
invention can be represented as Formula 24.<br><br>
The L' and Rr indicate output signals of channels,<br>
respectively. D(L) and D(R) indicate source component<br>
signals of channel L and R input signals, respectively. A(L)<br>
and A(R)® indicate ambient component signals. G_L and G_R<br>
indicate filters applied to ambient sound components of the<br>
channels, respectively.<br>
Thus, the ambient component signal modifying unit 1130<br>
is able to modify the ambient component signal to have a<br>
prescribed ambient effect using a filter applied to the<br>
corresponding ambient component signal. The filter can be<br>
included in a bitstream indicating the audio signal inputted<br>
to the audio signal receiving unit 1110. The filter can be<br>
stored in the ambient component signal modifying unit 1130<br>
of the audio signal decoding apparatus of the present<br>
invention. The filter can be inputted via an input device<br>
(not shown in the drawing) by a listener. The G_X can be a<br>
fixed value or a variable value that varies according to a<br>
listener's request. The G_X can provide an effect that the<br>
ambient component signal is reproduced at a random virtual<br>
position instead of a position of the conventional output<br>
unit L or R. Therefore, the G_X can use the HRTF or can be<br>
configured by considering cross-talk of the HRTF, by which<br>
examples of the present invention are non-limited.<br>
FIG. 13 is a diagram for an output of a stereo signal<br>
including a ambient component signal modified using the<br>
filter of Formula 24.<br>
Referring to FIG. 13, in case that an audio signal<br>
decoded according to one embodiment of the present invention<br>
is outputted by two output units 1310 and 1320, a listener<br>
is able to hear source component signals from the output<br>
units 1310 and 1320 disposed in front of the listener. On<br>
the contrary, the listener senses filter-applied ambient<br>
component signals as if they are outputted from positions of<br>
virtual output units 1330 and 1340, respectively. As the<br>
effect of using lateral/rear output units for the ambient<br>
component signals additionally is obtained to enhance the<br>
stereo effect, the listener is able to enjoy the stereo<br>
sound effectively using the stereo signal and device.<br>
An audio signal decoding apparatus according to another<br>
embodiment of the present invention is able to give a stereo<br>
effect to an audio signal by modifying an extracted source<br>
component. And, a corresponding audio signal decoding<br>
apparatus is explained with reference to FIG. 14 and FIG. 15<br>
as follows.<br>
FIG. 14 is a schematic block diagram of an audio signal<br>
decoding apparatus 1400 having a source component modifying<br>
unit according to another embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
First of all, the audio signal decoding apparatus 1400<br>
mainly includes a ambient component signal extracting unit<br>
1420, a ambient component signal modifying unit 1430, a<br>
source component signal extracting unit 1440, a source<br>
component signal modifying unit 1450 and a signal output<br>
unit 1460. Since the ambient component signal extracting<br>
unit 1420, the ambient component signal modifying unit 1430,<br>
the source component signal extracting unit 1440 and the<br>
signal output unit 1460 play the same functions and roles of<br>
the elements having the same names of the former audio<br>
signal decoding apparatus 1100 shown in FIG. 11, their<br>
details will be omitted in the following description.<br>
The source component signal modifying unit 1420<br>
receives a source component signal extracted by the source<br>
component signal extracting unit 1440 and is then able to<br>
modify the source component signal to enhance a stereo<br>
effect. The source component signal modifying unit 1420 is<br>
able to use a filter capable of giving a surround effect or<br>
an extension effect to the source component signal, by which<br>
examples of the present invention are non-limited.<br>
FIG. 15 is a schematic partial block diagram of<br>
portions of an audio signal decoding apparatus for modifying<br>
a source component signal using a filter for giving an<br>
extension effect. In the present invention, the extension<br>
effect means the effect of increasing distances of source<br>
component signals included in a channel signal in a space.<br>
And, an output signal including the extension effect applied<br>
source component signals can provide a stereo effect as if<br>
being listened to a wide space such as an auditorium, a<br>
stadium and the like. A source component signal extracting<br>
unit 1540, of which function and role are equivalent to<br>
those of the former source component signal extracting unit<br>
1140, extracts a source component signal from the inputted<br>
audio signal. Meanwhile, the source component signal<br>
extending unit 1550 receives the source component signal and<br>
then generates a source component signal, of which distance<br>
between the source components is extended, by applying a<br>
filter of giving an extension effect to the received source<br>
component signal.<br>
Thus, in the audio signal decoding apparatus according<br>
to the present invention, an ambient component signal and/or<br>
a source component signal is extracted from an audio signal<br>
and is then modified. The modified ambient and/or source<br>
component signal is mixed and then outputted. Therefore, it<br>
is able to increase the stereo effect generated by the<br>
ambient or environmental influence in the recording<br>
environment. And, it is able to obtain an audio signal<br>
having the enhanced stereo effect using the stereo signal<br>
and device only as if using a multi-channel.<br>
Unlike the former embodiment for further enhancing the<br>
stereo effect of the stereo signal in a manner of mixing a<br>
modified ambient component signal and a modified source<br>
component signal together and then outputting the mixed<br>
signal via a single output unit, another embodiment of the<br>
present invention proposes an audio signal decoding<br>
apparatus having an output unit for outputting an ambient<br>
component signal separate from an audio signal including a<br>
source component signal and/or a channel signal.<br>
FIG. 16 is a schematic block diagram of an apparatus<br>
1600 for decoding an audio signal according to another<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 16, the audio signal decoding<br>
apparatus 1600 have the same functions and roles of the<br>
former decoding apparatus 1100 shown in FIG. 11 in part.<br>
Hence, details of an audio signal receiving unit 1601, an<br>
ambient component signal extracting unit 1620, an ambient<br>
component signal modifying unit 1630 and a source component<br>
signal extracting unit 1640 are omitted in the following<br>
description. And, the audio signal decoding apparatus 1600<br>
can further include a source component signal modifying unit<br>
(not shown in the drawing) for enhancing a stereo effect of<br>
a source component signal by receiving the source component<br>
signal from the source component signal extracting unit 1640<br>
and then applying a filter for giving an extension effect or<br>
a surround effect.<br>
The ambient component signal modified by the ambient<br>
component signal modifying unit 1630 is outputted via a<br>
first signal output unit 1650 and the source component<br>
signal or the audio signal received by the audio signal<br>
receiving unit 1610 is outputted via a second signal output<br>
unit 1660. And, both of the source component signal and the<br>
audio signal can be outputted via the second signal output<br>
unit 1660. Moreover, the audio signal received by the audio<br>
signal receiving unit 1610 can include flag information<br>
indicating whether at least one of the source component<br>
signal and the audio signal is outputted by the signal<br>
output unit 1650. In the following description, the second<br>
signal output unit 1660 is non-limited to the function of<br>
outputting the source component signal but is understood as<br>
outputting the source component signal and the audio signal<br>
or the audio signal. And, the audio signal of the present<br>
invention includes a plurality of channel signals including<br>
the source component signal and the ambient component signal.<br>
Each of the first signal output unit 1650 and the<br>
second signal output unit 1660 is configured with a single<br>
unit or can be configured with at least two units. For<br>
instance, in case that an output system of an audio signal<br>
is a stereo system, the first signal output unit 1650 can<br>
include two first signal output units corresponding to left<br>
and right channels, respectively. And, the second signal<br>
output unit 1660 can include two second signal output units<br>
corresponding to left and right channels, respectively.<br>
Although the present invention relates to a case that<br>
the output system of the audio signal includes the stereo<br>
system, it can be a multi-channel system configured in a<br>
manner that each of the first and second signal output units<br>
1650 and 1660 includes at least three units.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the audio signal decoding apparatus further includes a first<br>
signal output unit for outputting a modified ambient<br>
component signal only as well as a second output unit for<br>
outputting an audio signal or a source component signal,<br>
thereby enhancing a stereo effect of the audio signal.<br>
Moreover, by disposing the first signal output unit and the<br>
second signal output unit to differing in output directions<br>
from each other, a listener is enabled to listen to the<br>
audio signal having the enhanced stereo effect. The first<br>
and second signal output units for providing the stereo<br>
effect enhanced audio signal are explained with reference to<br>
FIGs. 17 to 22 as follows.<br>
First of all, in an audio signal decoding apparatus<br>
such as a TV, an audio system and the like, a signal output<br>
unit should be disposed within a limited space as long as a<br>
separate output unit separated from the decoding apparatus<br>
is used. Generally, a second signal output unit for<br>
outputting an audio signal or a source component signal has<br>
an output direction toward a listener (hereinafter named<br>
Afront side') . And, it is effect to deliver a stereo effect<br>
if a first signal output unit for outputting an ambient<br>
component signal is disposed in rear or lateral side of a<br>
listener. Yet, due to the disposition within the limited<br>
space, the first signal output unit is disposed around the<br>
second signal output unit.<br>
FIG. 17 is a graph for disposition of first and second<br>
signal output units. A second signal output unit 1710 has an<br>
x-direction output direction. And, first signal output units<br>
1720a and 1720b have output directions differing from that<br>
of the second signal output unit 1710.<br>
Referring to FIG. 17, the first signal output unit<br>
1720a outputting a ambient component signal can be disposed<br>
to have an output direction not in parallel with that of the<br>
second signal output unit 1710 and may not exit on a plane<br>
where the second signal output unit 1710 is located.<br>
Moreover, referring to FIG. 17, the first signal output unit<br>
1720b is located on the same place of the x-y plane where<br>
the second signal output unit 1710 is located and can have<br>
an output direction not in parallel with that of the second<br>
signal output unit 1710.<br>
The second signal output unit 1710 is responsible for a<br>
reproduction of an audio signal or a source component signal<br>
and the first signal output unit 1720a or 1720b having the<br>
output direction not in parallel with that of the second<br>
signal output unit 1710 is responsible for a reproduction of<br>
an ambient component signal. Therefore, compared to the case<br>
of reproducing the stereo signal using the second signal<br>
output unit 1710 only, this case can provide a listener with<br>
the audio signal having the enhanced stereo effect.<br>
FIG. 18 and FIG. 19 schematically show an audio signal<br>
decoding apparatus, in which a first signal output unit for<br>
outputting an ambient component signal is disposed to have<br>
an output direction different from that of a second signal<br>
output unit for outputting an audio signal or a source<br>
component signal, and a method of reproducing an audio<br>
signal using the same. In FIG. 18 and FIG. 19, a channel<br>
signal is an example of an audio signal inputted to an audio<br>
signal receiving unit of the present invention, includes an<br>
ambient component signal and a source component signal, and<br>
indicates a signal outputted on each channel.<br>
Referring to FIG. 18, first signal output units 1850a<br>
and 1850b have output directions toward lateral rear sides<br>
with reference to output directions of second signal output<br>
units 1860a and 1860b, respectively. Ambient component<br>
signals are inputted to the first signal output units 1850a<br>
and 1850b from a ambient component signal modifying unit<br>
1830, respectively. Source component signals from a source<br>
component signal extracting unit 1840 or an audio signal<br>
from an audio signal receiving unit (not shown in the<br>
drawing) is inputted to the second signal output units 1860a<br>
and 1860b. The ambient component signal modofying unit 1830<br>
and the source signal component extracting unit 1840 are<br>
equivalent to the former ambient component signal modifying<br>
unit 1130 and the former source component signal extracting<br>
unit 1140 shown in FIG. 11, of which details will be omitted<br>
in the following description.<br>
As the first signal output unit 1850a/1850b has the<br>
output direction toward the lateral rear side, an ambient<br>
component signal outputted in the lateral rear direction can<br>
have an increased effect of being reflected by a wall of a<br>
12 and FIG. 13 in the following description.<br>
A source component signal extracting unit 1140 receives<br>
the audio signal inputted to the audio signal receiving unit<br>
1110 and the ambient component signal extracted by the<br>
ambient component signal extracting unit 1120 and then<br>
extracts the source component signal by removing the ambient<br>
component signal from the audio signal. And, it is able to<br>
use the estimated source component signal (S), which is<br>
estimated by performing the procedures of Formulas 1 to 22<br>
on the audio signal inputted to the audio signal receiving<br>
unit 1110, as the source component signal extracted by the<br>
source component signal extracting unit 1140.<br>
A signal output unit 1150 outputs a stereo signal to an<br>
external environment of the audio signal decoding apparatus<br>
by receiving and combining the source component signal<br>
extracted by the source component signal extracting unit<br>
1140 and the ambient component signal modified by the<br>
ambient component signal modifying unit 1130 together. The<br>
signal output unit 1150 is able to output the audios signal<br>
received by the audio signal receiving unit 1110, i.e., a<br>
channel signal instead of the source component signal<br>
extracted by the source component signal extracting unit<br>
1140 and is also able to output the source component signal<br>
and the received audio signal together with the ambient<br>
component signal. And, the audio signal received by the<br>
rear or lateral side. Moreover, a path for delivering an<br>
ambient component signal to a listener can be provided in<br>
more various ways, whereby a stereo effect of the audio<br>
signal can be increased due to a natural delay effect and<br>
the like.<br>
Referring to FIG. 19, first signal output units 1950a<br>
and 1950b have output directions toward lateral front sides<br>
with reference to the output directions of the first signal<br>
output units 1850a and 1850b shown in FIG. 18 and output<br>
directions of second signal output units 1960a and 1960b,<br>
respectively. Ambient component signals are inputted to the<br>
first signal output units 1950a and 1950b from a ambient<br>
component signal modifying unit 1930, respectively. Source<br>
component signals from a source component signal extracting<br>
unit 1940 or an audio signal from an audio signal receiving<br>
unit (not shown in the drawing) is inputted to the second<br>
signal output units 1960a and 1960b. Details of the ambient<br>
component signal modifying unit 1930 and the source signal<br>
component extracting unit 1940 will be omitted in the<br>
following description.<br>
As the first signal output unit 1950a/1950b has the<br>
output direction toward the lateral front side, a ambient<br>
component signal outputted in the lateral front direction<br>
can have a further increased effect of being reflected by a<br>
wall of a lateral side. Moreover, comparing to the former<br>
audio signal decoding apparatus shown in FIG. 18, since<br>
spaces required for the first signal output units 1950a and<br>
1950b and the second signal output units 1960a and 1960b are<br>
narrow, the present invention is more useful for an audio<br>
signal decoding apparatus having a narrow space for an<br>
output unit.<br>
In an audio signal decoding apparatus according to the<br>
present invention, first and second signal output units for<br>
outputting an ambient component signal and a source<br>
component signal can consecutively configure a single output<br>
unit. FIG. 20 shows a TV including an audio signal decoding<br>
apparatus having the first and second signal output units<br>
configured in a single output unit. In this disclosure, the<br>
TV is taken as an example. Yet, it can be widely applicable<br>
to a device including an audio signal decoder.<br>
Referring to FIG. 20, an output unit 2010 and 2020<br>
includes two units L and R which are disposed in a vertical<br>
direction. The output unit 2010 and 202 includes a first<br>
signal output unit for outputting a ambient component signal<br>
and a second signal output unit for outputting an audio<br>
signal or a source component signal. And, an enlarged<br>
internal diagram for the output unit 2101 located to the<br>
left of the screen part is shown in a bottom part of FIG. 20.<br>
The left output unit 2010 includes a first signal output<br>
unit 2011 and a second signal output unit 2012. And, it is<br>
able to dispose the first and second signal output units<br>
2011 and 2012 to differ from each other in output direction.<br>
For instance, the output direction of the second signal<br>
output unit 2012 is disposed toward a front side, while the<br>
output direction of the first signal output unit 2011 is<br>
disposed toward a lateral rear side or a lateral front side.<br>
Moreover, it is able to divert or shift the output<br>
directions of the first and second signal output units 2011<br>
and 2012 based on characteristic information. The<br>
characteristic information can be determined according to<br>
characteristics of a sound source or an operation mode<br>
thereof. The characteristics or operation mode of the sound<br>
source can be included in a bitstream indicating an audio<br>
signal inputted to an audio signal decoding apparatus or can<br>
be stored in the ambient component signal modifying unit<br>
1130 of the audio signal decoding apparatus according to the<br>
present invention. Moreover, the characteristics or<br>
operation mode of the sound source can be inputted via a<br>
listener input device (not shown in the drawing) by a<br>
listener.<br>
For instance, in case that a listener attempts to<br>
reproduce a stereo signal having no surround effect only,<br>
the listener inputs a preset 2ch mode using a remote<br>
controller or the like. If so, the audio signal decoding<br>
apparatus receives it and is then able to divert a disposed<br>
direction of the first signal output unit 2011 so that the<br>
output direction of the first signal output unit 2011 is<br>
identical to that of the second signal output unit 2012.<br>
This diversion of the disposed direction can be obtained by<br>
the mechanical rotation or by a signal processing method.<br>
According to another embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the output unit including the first and second<br>
signal output units can have various configurations. FIG. 21<br>
shows an example the output unit. The output unit can<br>
include a plurality of units. And, each of a plurality of<br>
the units can include a first signal output unit or a second<br>
signal output unit. Referring to FIG. 21, an output unit<br>
having a cylindrical configuration is easily rotatable,<br>
increases a stereo effect by outputting a different signal<br>
to each partitioned area, and controls an output direction<br>
of each unit according to the characteristic information.<br>
The cylindrical configuration of the output unit does not<br>
limit examples of the present invention only if each example<br>
includes a plurality of units in a rotatable configuration.<br>
In an audio signal decoding apparatus according to the<br>
present invention, a first signal output unit or a second<br>
signal output unit can include a plurality of units as well<br>
as an output unit. In this case, a plurality of the units<br>
can output signals of different frequency bands and an<br>
output direction of each of the units can be adjusted<br>
according to unit characteristic information. The unit<br>
characteristic information can be determined according to<br>
characteristics of a sound source. The characteristics of<br>
the sound source can be included in a bitstream indicating<br>
an audio signal inputted to an audio signal decoding<br>
apparatus or can be stored in the ambient component signal<br>
modifying unit 1130 of the audio signal decoding apparatus<br>
according to the present invention. Moreover, the<br>
characteristics of the sound source can be inputted via a<br>
listener input device (not shown in the drawing) by a<br>
listener.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the present<br>
invention, it is able to enhance a stereo effect of an audio<br>
signal in a manner of disposing a first signal output unit<br>
for outputting an ambient component signal over the screen<br>
part. FIG. 22 shows a TV as an example of an audio signal<br>
decoding apparatus having first and second signal output<br>
units disposed vertical to each other in a front side where<br>
the screen part is located, in which the first signal output<br>
unit is disposed over the screen part. Referring to FIG. 22,<br>
an output unit includes a first signal output unit 2210 for<br>
outputting a ambient component signal and second signal<br>
output units 2220 and 2230 for outputting source component<br>
signals. And, the second signal output units can be located<br>
to the left and right sides of a screen part 2240. The first<br>
signal output unit 2210 is located in the same plane of the<br>
second signal output units 2220 and 2230 and the screen part<br>
2240 and can be disposed over the screen part 2240 to be<br>
vertical to the second signal output units 2220 and 2230.<br>
Referring to FIG. 22, when the first signal output unit<br>
2210 of the TV is disposed over the screen part 2240 to be<br>
vertical to the second signal output units 2220 and 2230, a<br>
ambient component signal is outputted from the first signal<br>
output unit 2210 and is then reflected using a ceiling. Thus,<br>
comparing to the case that the first signal output unit is<br>
located in lateral rear or front of the second signal output<br>
unit, the case that the first signal output unit 2210 is<br>
located at the top further includes the step of reflection<br>
due to collision with the ceiling, whereby a stereo effect<br>
of an audio signal can be further enhanced. Moreover, the<br>
first signal output unit 2210 is not only located over the<br>
screen part 2240 to be vertical to the second signal output<br>
units 2220 and 2230 but also disposed over the screen part<br>
2240 by configuring various angles.<br>
In FIG. 22, shown is the case that the first signal<br>
output unit 2210 is located over the screen part 2240. The<br>
first signal output unit 2210 can be located over the audio<br>
decoding apparatus to be vertical to the front side<br>
including the screen part and the second signal output unit<br>
or can be located over a backside opposing the front side.<br>
And, the first signal output unit can be disposed to form a<br>
specific angle with a plane using a physical or electrical<br>
method.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the present<br>
invention, proposed is a decoding apparatus and method for<br>
enhancing a stereo effect of an audio signal in a manner of<br>
re-modifying an ambient component signal by considering an<br>
environment where an audio signal decoding apparatus is used.<br>
This is explained in detail with reference to FIG. 23 as<br>
follows.<br>
Referring to FIG. 23, an apparatus for decoding an<br>
audio signal according to the present invention mainly<br>
includes an audio signal extracting unit 2310, an ambient<br>
component signal extracting unit 2320, an environment<br>
information generating unit 2330, an ambient component<br>
signal modifying unit 2340, a source component signal<br>
extracting unit 2350, a first signal output unit 2360 and a<br>
second signal output unit 2370. The audio signal extracting<br>
unit 2310, the ambient component signal extracting unit 2320,<br>
the source component signal extracting unit 2350, the first<br>
signal output unit 2360 and the second signal output unit<br>
2370 have the same functions and roles of the audio signal<br>
extracting unit 1110, the ambient component signal<br>
extracting unit 1120, the source component signal extracting<br>
unit 1140, the first signal output unit 1650 and the second<br>
signal output unit 1660 shown in FIG. 11 or FIG. 16. And,<br>
their details will be omitted in the following description.<br>
The audio signal decoding apparatus further includes a<br>
source component signal modifying unit (not shown in the<br>
drawing) for modifying an extracted source component signal,<br>
whereby a stereo effect of an audio signal can be enhanced.<br>
The environment information generating unit 2330<br>
transfers various preset modes to a listener input device<br>
(not shown in the drawing) and is then able to output preset<br>
environment information corresponding to a mode selected by<br>
a listener. As an example of the preset mode, there exists a<br>
wall-mounted mode or a stand mode in case of TV. The<br>
environment information generating unit 2330 outputs the<br>
environment information corresponding to the wall-mounted<br>
mode or the stand mode to the ambient information signal<br>
modifying unit 2340. The environment information<br>
corresponding to the wall-mounted mode may be set to a<br>
narrower distance between an audio signal decoding apparatus<br>
and a reflecting plane rather than the stand mode. Meanwhile,<br>
a listener is able to directly input environment information<br>
to the environment information generating unit 2330. For<br>
instance, a listener is able to input a distance between a<br>
backside of the audio signal decoding apparatus and a<br>
reflecting plane, a distance between a topside of the<br>
apparatus and a ceiling, a distance between a lateral side<br>
of the apparatus and a reflecting plane and the like using<br>
an input device. And, the environment information generating<br>
unit 2330 is then able to generate the environment<br>
information.<br>
Moreover, the environment information can include<br>
information on ambient characteristics between the audio<br>
signal decoding apparatus and a listening position. For<br>
instance, the information on the ambient characteristic can<br>
include a distance between the decoding apparatus and the<br>
listening position. An optimal listening position for<br>
maximizing a stereo effect of an audio signal can be varied<br>
by the distance between the audio signal decoding apparatus<br>
and the listening position. Hence, the environment<br>
information generating unit 2330 receives the distance via<br>
the listener input device, generates the environment<br>
information and is then able to output the generated<br>
environment information to the ambient component signal<br>
modifying unit 2340. Moreover, the environment information<br>
generating unit 2330 is able to estimate a position of a<br>
listener using a separate detecting device (not shown in the<br>
drawing). For instance, the environment information<br>
generating unit 2330 is able to estimate a distance between<br>
the audio signal decoding apparatus and a listener using<br>
such a separate sound sensor as a microphone, a remote<br>
controller or the like.<br>
An audio signal decoding apparatus and method according<br>
to the present invention can further enhance a stereo effect<br>
of an audio signal in a manner of modifying an ambient<br>
component signal based on the above-generated environment<br>
information.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the present<br>
invention, by outputting an ambient component signal to be<br>
more delayed than a source component signal or by giving an<br>
extension effect to a source component signal, it is able to<br>
enhance a stereo effect of an audio signal. FIG. 24 is a<br>
schematic diagram of an audio signal decoding apparatus<br>
further including an output delaying unit 2451. Referring to<br>
FIG. 24, a first signal output unit 2450 for outputting an<br>
ambient component signal includes an output delaying unit<br>
2451 and an output unit 2452 and is able to output an<br>
ambient component signal at a time delayed more than a<br>
source component signal outputted by a second signal output<br>
unit 2460. Hence, an effect of giving a stereo effect can be<br>
obtained by maximizing a reverberant effect of an audio<br>
signal.<br>
FIG. 25 is a schematic diagram of an audio signal<br>
decoding apparatus further including an extension effect<br>
applying unit 2561. Referring to FIG. 25, a second signal<br>
output unit 2560 for outputting a source component signal<br>
includes an extension effect applying unit 2561 and an<br>
output unit 2562. The extension effect applying unit 2561<br>
brings an effect of extending a distance of each source<br>
component signal outputted from the second signal output<br>
unit 2560, whereby an audio signal can be listened to in a<br>
wider space.<br>
Moreover, an audio signal decoding apparatus according<br>
to the present invention includes both an output delaying<br>
unit within a first signal output unit and an extension<br>
effect applying unit within a second signal output unit,<br>
thereby enhancing a stereo effect of an audio signal.<br>
According to the present invention, the above-described<br>
decoding/encoding method can be implemented in a program<br>
recorded medium as computer-readable codes. The computer-<br>
readable media include all kinds of recording devices in<br>
which data readable by a computer system are stored. The<br>
computer-readable media include ROM, RAM, CD-ROM, magnetic<br>
tapes, floppy discs, optical data storage devices, and the<br>
like for example and also include carrier-wave type<br>
implementations (e.g., transmission via Internet). And, a<br>
bitstream generated by the encoding method is stored in a<br>
computer-readable recording medium or can be transmitted via<br>
wire/wireless communication network.<br>
While the present invention has been described and<br>
illustrated herein with reference to the preferred<br>
embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to those skilled in<br>
the art that various modifications and variations can be<br>
made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of<br>
the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present<br>
invention covers the modifications and variations of this<br>
invention that come within the scope of the appended claims<br>
and their equivalents.<br>
