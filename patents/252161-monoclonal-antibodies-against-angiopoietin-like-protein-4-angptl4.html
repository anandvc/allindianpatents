V.       DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS<br>
[064] It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description<br>
and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and<br>
are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.<br>
[065]  In this application, the use of the singular includes the plural<br>
unless specifically stated otherwise. In this application, the word "a" or "an"<br>
means "at least one" unless specifically stated otherwise. In this application,<br>
the use of "or" means "and/or" unless stated otherwise. Furthermore, the use<br>
of the term "including," as well as other forms, such as "includes" and<br>
"included," is not limiting. Also, terms such as "element" or "component"<br>
encompass both elements or components comprising one unit and elements<br>
or components that comprise more than one unit unless specifically stated<br>
otherwise.<br>
[066]  The section headings used herein are for organizational<br>
purposes only and are not to be construed as limiting the subject matter<br>
described. All documents, or portions of documents, cited in this application,<br>
including but not limited to patents, patent applications, articles, books, and<br>
treatises are hereby expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety for<br>
any purpose. In the event that one or more of the incorporated literature and<br>
similar materials defines a term that contradicts that term's definition in this<br>
application, this application controls.<br>
A.       Certain definitions<br>
[067] The terms "polypeptide," "peptide," and "protein" are used<br>
interchangeably herein to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues. The<br>
terms apply to amino acid polymers containing naturally occurring amino<br>
acids as well as amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acid<br>
residues is an artificial chemical analogue of a corresponding naturally<br>
occurring amino acid. The amino acid polymers can be of any length.<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
[068]  The term "antibody," as used herein, refers to an intact antibody<br>
or a fragment of an antibody that competes with the intact antibody for antigen<br>
binding. Antibody fragments include, but are not limited to, Fab, Fab1, F(ab')2,<br>
Fv, scFv, Fd, diabodies, and other antibody fragments that retain at least a<br>
portion of the variable region of an intact antibody. See, e.g., Hudson et al.<br>
(2003) Nature IVIed. 9:129-134. In certain embodiments, antibody fragments<br>
are produced by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact antibodies. In<br>
certain embodiments, antibody fragments are produced by recombinant DNA<br>
techniques.<br>
[069]  The term "native polypeptide" refers to a naturally occurring<br>
polypeptide. The term "native antibody" refers to a naturally occurring<br>
antibody.<br>
[070]  The term "monoclonal antibody" refers to an antibody from a<br>
substantially homogeneous population of antibodies that specifically bind to<br>
the same epitope. In certain embodiments, a monoclonal antibody is secreted<br>
by a hybridoma. In certain such embodiments, a hybridoma is produced<br>
according to certain methods known to those skilled in the art. See, e.g.,<br>
Kohlerand Milstein (1975) Nature, 256:495-499). In certain embodiments, a<br>
monoclonal antibody is produced using recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g.,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567). In certain embodiments, a monoclonal antibody<br>
refers to an antibody fragment isolated from a phage display library (see, e.g.,<br>
Clackson et al. (1991) Nature 352: 624-628, and Marks et al. (1991) J. Mol.<br>
Biol. 222: 581-597). For various other monoclonal antibody production<br>
techniques, see, e.g., Hariow and Lane (1988) Antibodies: A. Laboratory<br>
Manual (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY).<br>
[071] A "chimeric" antibody refers to an antibody made up of<br>
components from at least two different sources. In certain embodiments, a<br>
chimeric antibody comprises a portion of an antibody derived from a first<br>
species fused to another molecule, e.g., a portion of an antibody derived from<br>
a second species. In certain such embodiments, a chimeric antibody<br>
comprises a portion of an antibody derived from a non-human animal fused to<br>
a portion of an antibody derived from a human. In certain such embodiments,<br>
a chimeric antibody comprises all or a portion of a variable region of an<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
antibody derived from a non-human animal fused to a constant region of an<br>
antibody derived from a human.<br>
[072] A "humanized" antibody refers to a non-human antibody that has<br>
been modified so that it more closely matches (in amino acid sequence) a<br>
human antibody. A humanized antibody is thus a type of chimeric antibody.<br>
In certain embodiments, amino acid residues outside of the antigen binding<br>
residues of the variable region of the non-human antibody are modified. In<br>
certain embodiments, a humanized antibody is constructed by replacing all or<br>
a portion of a complementarity determining region (CDR) of a human antibody<br>
with all or a portion of a CDR from another antibody, such as a non-human<br>
antibody, having the desired antigen binding specificity. In certain<br>
embodiments, a humanized antibody comprises variable regions in which all<br>
or substantially all of the CDRs correspond to CDRs of a non-human antibody<br>
and all or substantially all of the framework regions (FRs) correspond to FRs<br>
of a humsn antibody. In certain such embodiments, a humanized antibody<br>
further comprises a constant region (Fc) of a human antibody.<br>
[073]  The term "human antibody" refers to a monoclonal antibody that<br>
contains human antibody sequences and does not contain antibody<br>
sequences from a non-human animal. In certain embodiments, a human<br>
antibody may contain synthetic sequences not found in native antibodies.<br>
The term is not limited by the manner in which the antibodies are made. For<br>
example, in various embodiments, a human antibody may be made in a<br>
transgenic mouse, by phage display, by human B-lymphocytes, or by<br>
recombinant methods.<br>
[074]  The term "neutralizing antibody" or "antibody that neutralizes"<br>
refers to an antibody that reduces at least one activity of a polypeptide<br>
comprising the epitope to which the antibody specifically binds. In certain<br>
embodiments, a neutralizing antibody reduces an activity in vitro and/or in<br>
vivo.<br>
[075]  The term "antigen-binding site" refers to a portion of an antibody<br>
capable of specifically binding an antigen. In certain embodiments, an<br>
antigen-binding site is provided by one or more antibody variable regions.<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
[076]   The term "epitope" refers to any polypeptide determinant<br>
capable of specifically binding to an immunoglobulin or a f-cell receptor. In<br>
certain embodiments, an epitope is a region of an antigen that is specifically<br>
bound by an antibody. In certain embodiments, an epitope may include<br>
chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids, sugar<br>
side chains, phosphoryl, or sulfonyl groups. In certain embodiments, an<br>
epitope may have specific three dimensional structural characteristics (e.g., a<br>
"conformational" epitope) and/or specific charge characteristics.<br>
[077]   An epitope is defined as "the same" as another epitope if a<br>
particular anti body specifically binds to both epitopes. In certain<br>
embodiments, polypeptides having different primary amino acid sequences<br>
may comprise epitopes that are the same. In certain embodiments, epitopes<br>
that are the same may have different primary amino acid sequences.<br>
Different antibodies are said to bind to the same epitope if they compete for<br>
specific binding to that epitope.<br>
[078]  An antibody "specifically binds" an antigen when it preferentially<br>
recognizes the antigen in a complex mixture of proteins and/or<br>
macromolecules. In certain embodiments, an antibody comprises an<br>
antigen-binding site that specifically binds to a particular epitope. In certain<br>
such embodiments, the antibody is capable of bind ing different antigens so<br>
long as the different antigens comprise that particular epitope. In certain<br>
instances, for example, homologous proteins from different species may<br>
comprise the same epitope. In certain embodiments, an antibody is said to<br>
specifically bind an antigen when the dissociation constant (KQ) is 
certain embodiments, when the dissociation constant is s 100 nM, and in<br>
certain embodiments, when the dissociation constant is 
[079]  The term "ANGPTL4" refers to an angiopoietin like protein 4<br>
from any vertebrate or mammalian source, including, but not limited to,<br>
human, bovine, chicken, rodent, mouse, rat, porcine, ovine, primate, monkey,<br>
and guinea pig, unless specified otherwise. The term also refers to fragments<br>
and variants of native ANGPTL4 that maintain at least one in vivo or in vitro<br>
activity of a native ANGPTL4. The term encompasses full-length<br>
unprocessed precursor forms of ANGPTL4 as well as mature forms resulting<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
from post-translational cleavage of the signal peptide and forms resulting from<br>
proteolytic processing of the fibrinogen domain. In certain embodiments, a<br>
full-length, unprocessed mouse ANGPTL4 has the amino acid sequence set<br>
forth in SEQ ID NO: 1. In certain embodiments, a full-length, unprocessed<br>
mouse ANGPTL4 has the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 50.<br>
In certain embodiments, a full-length, unprocessed human ANGPTL4 has the<br>
amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:2.<br>
[080] The term "AngptW" refers to a nucleic acid encoding ANGPTL4.<br>
[081]  The term "LPL" refers to a lipoprotein lipase from any vertebrate<br>
or mammalian source, including, but not limited to, human, bovine, chicken,<br>
rodent, mouse, rat, porcine, ovine, primate, monkey, and guinea pig. In<br>
certain embodiments, a lipoprotein lipase catalyzes the hydrolysis of<br>
triacylglycerol in chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs) into<br>
diacylglycerol and a free fatty acid anion. In certain embodiments, a<br>
lipoprotein lipase is also able to hydrolyze diacylglycerol.<br>
[082] The term "agent" refers to a chemical compound, a mixture of<br>
chemical compounds, a biological macromolecule, or an extract made from<br>
biological materials.<br>
[083] The term "antagonist" refers to an agent that reduces an activity<br>
ofANGPTL4.<br>
[084]  The term "agonist" refers to an agent that increases an activity<br>
ofANGPTL4.<br>
[085]  The term "patienf includes human and animal subjects. In<br>
certain embodiments, a patient is a mammal. In certain such embodiments, a<br>
patient is a human.<br>
[086] A "fragment" of a reference polypeptide refers to a contiguous<br>
stretch of amino acids from any portion of the reference polypeptide. A<br>
fragment may be of any length that is less than the length of the reference<br>
polypeptide.<br>
[087] A "variant" of a reference polypeptide refers to a polypeptide<br>
having one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions, or insertions relative<br>
to the reference polypeptide.<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
[088] A "conservative" amino acid substitution refers to the<br>
substitution of an amino acid in a polypeptide with another amino acid having<br>
similar properties, such as size or charge. In certain embodiments, a<br>
polypeptide comprising a conservative amino acid substitution maintains at<br>
least one activity of the unsubstituted polypeptide. A conservative amino acid<br>
substitution may encompass non-natura lly occurring amino acid residues,<br>
which are typically incorporated by chemical peptide synthesis rather than by<br>
synthesis in biological systems. These i nclude, but are not limited to,<br>
peptidomimetics and other reversed or inverted forms of amino acid moieties.<br>
[089]  Naturally occurring residues may be divided into classes based<br>
on common side chain properties:<br>
1)	hydrophobic: norleucine, Met, Ala, Val, Leu, lie;<br>
2)	neutral hydrophilic:   Cys, Ser, Thr, Asn, Gin;<br>
3)	acidic: Asp, Glu;<br>
4)	basic: His, Lys, Arg;<br>
5)	residues that infiuen ce chain orientation: Giy, Pro; and<br>
6)	aromatic: Trp.Tyr, Phe.<br>
[090]  For example, non-conservative substitutions may involve the<br>
exchange of a member of one of these classes for a member from another<br>
class. Such substituted residues may be introduced into regions of a human<br>
antibody that are homologous with non-h uman antibodies, or into the non-<br>
homologous regions of the molecule.<br>
[091]  In making substitutions, according to certain embodiments, the<br>
hydropathic index of amino acids may be considered. Each amino acid has<br>
been assigned a hydropathic index on the basis of its hydrophobicity and<br>
charge characteristics. They are: isoleucine (+4.5); valine (+4.2); leucine<br>
(+3.8); phenylalanine (+2.8); cysteine/cystine (+2.5); methionine (+1.9);<br>
alanine (+1.8); glycine (-0.4); threonine (-O.7); serine (-0.8); tryptophan (-0.9);<br>
tyrosine (-1.3); proline  (-1.6); histidine (-3.2); glutamate (-3.5); glutamine (-<br>
3.5); aspartate (-3.5); asparagine (-3.5); lysine (-3.9); and arginine (-4.5).<br>
[092] The importance of the hydropathic amino acid index in<br>
conferring interactive biological function o n a protein, in certain instances, is<br>
understood in the art. Kvte et a/.. J. Mol. BioL 157:105-131 (1982). It is<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
known that in certain instances, certain amino acids may be substituted for<br>
other am ino acids having a similar hydropathic index or score and still retain a<br>
similar biological activity. In making changes based upon the hydropathic<br>
index, in certain embodiments, the substitution of amino acids whose<br>
hydropathic indices are within ±2 is included. In certain embodiments, those<br>
which are within ±1 are included, and in certain embodiments, those within<br>
±0.5 are included.<br>
[0Q3]   It is also understood in the art that the substitution of like amino<br>
acids can be made effectively on the basis of hydrophilicity, particularly where<br>
the biologically functional protein or peptide thereby created is intended for<br>
use in imrnunological embodiments, as in the present case. In certain<br>
embodiments, the greatest local average hydrophilicity of a protein, as<br>
governed by the hydrophilicity of its adjacent amino acids, correlates with its<br>
immunogenicity and antigenicity, i.e., with a biological property of the protein.<br>
[094]  The following hydrophilicity values have been assigned to these<br>
amino acid residues: arginine (+3.0); lysine (+3.0); aspartate (+3.0 ±1);<br>
glutamate (+3.0 ± 1); serine (+0.3); asparagine (+0.2); glutamine (-M3.2);<br>
glycine (0); threonine (-0.4); proline (-0.5 + 1); alanine (-0.5); histidine (-0.5);<br>
cysteine(-1.0); methionine (-1.3); valine (-1.5); leucine (-1.8); isoleucine (-<br>
1.8); tyros ine (-2.3); phenylalanine (-2.5) and tryptophan (-3.4). In making<br>
changes based upon similar hydrophilicity values, in certain embodiments, the<br>
substitutio n of amino acids whose hydrophilicity values are within ±2 is<br>
included, in certain embodiments, those which are within ±1 are included, and<br>
in certain embodiments, those within ±0.5 are included. One may also identify<br>
epitopes from primary amino acid sequences on the basis of hydrophilicity.<br>
These regions are also referred to as "epitopic core regions."<br>

[096] A skilled artisan will be able to determine su itable variants of a<br>
polypeptide as set forth herein using well-known techniques. In certain<br>
embodiments, one skilled in the art may identify suitable areas of the<br>
molecule that may be changed without destroying activity by targeting regions<br>
not believed to be important for activity. In certain embod iments, one can<br>
identify residues and portions of the molecules that are conserved among<br>
similar polypeptides. In certain embodiments, even areas that may be<br>
important for biological activity or for structure may be subject to conservative<br>
amino acid substitutions without destroying the biological activity or without<br>
adversely affecting the polypeptide structure.<br>
[097]  Additionally, in certain embodiments, one skilled in the art can<br>
review structure-function studies identifying residues in similar polypeptides<br>
that are important for activity or structure. In view of such a comparison, in<br>
certain embodiments, one can predict the importance of arnino acid residues<br>
in a protein that correspond to amino acid residues which are important for<br>
activity or structure in similar proteins. In certain embodiments, one skilled in<br>
the art may opt for chemically similar amino acid substitutions for such<br>
predicted important amino acid residues.<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
[098]  In certain embodiments, one skilled in the art can also analyze<br>
the three-dimensional structure and amino acid sequence in relation to that<br>
structure in similar polypeptides. In certain embodiments, in view of such<br>
information, one skilled in the art may predict the alignment of amino acid<br>
residues of an antibody with respect to its three dimensional structure. In<br>
certain embodiments, one skilled in the art may choose not to make radical<br>
changes to amino acid residues predicted to be on the surface of the protein,<br>
since such residues may be involved in important interactions with other<br>
molecules. Moreover, in certain embodiments, one skilled in the art may<br>
generate test variants containing a single amino acid substitution at each<br>
desired amino acid residue. In certain embodiments, the variants can then be<br>
screened using activity assays known to those skilled in the art.   In certain<br>
embodiments, such variants could be used to gather information about<br>
suitable variants. For example, in certain embodiments, if one discovered that<br>
a change to a particular amino acid residue resulted in destroyed, undesirably<br>
reduced, or unsuitable activity, variants with such a change may be avoided.<br>
In other words, in certain embodiments, based on information gathered from<br>
such routine experiments, one skilled in the art can readily determine the<br>
amino acids where further substitutions should be avoided eithe r alone or in<br>
combination with other mutations.<br>
[099]  A number of scientific publications have been devoted to the<br>
prediction of secondary structure. See, e.g., Moult J., Curr. Op. in Biotech..<br>
7(4):422-427 (1996), Chou et a/., Biochemistry. 13(2):222-245 (1974); Chou<br>
et a/., Biochemistry, 113(2):211-222 (1974); Chou et a/., Adv. Enzvmol. Relat.<br>
Areas Mol. BioL 47:45-148 (1978); Chou etal., Ann. Rev. Biochem.. 47:251-<br>
276 and Chou etal., Biophys. J.. 26:367-384 (1979). Moreover, computer<br>
programs are currently available to assist with predicting second ary structure.<br>
One method of predicting secondary structure is based upon hornology<br>
modeling. For example, two polypeptides or proteins which have a sequence<br>
identity of greater than 30%, or similarity greater than 40% often have similar<br>
structural topologies. The growth of the protein structural database (PDB) has<br>
provided enhanced predictability of secondary structure, including the<br>
potential number of folds within a polypeptide's structure. See, e.g., Holm et<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
al., Nucl. Acid. Res.. 27(1):244-247 (1999). It has been suggested (Brenner<br>
et al., Curr. Op. Struct. BioL 7(3):369-376 (1997)) that there are a limited<br>
number of folds in a given polypeptide or protein and that once a critical<br>
number of structures have been resolved, structural prediction will become<br>
dramatically more accurate.<br>
[0100] Additional methods of predicting secondary structure include<br>
"threading" (see, e.g., Jones, D., Curr. Opin. Struct; BioL 7(3):377-87 (1997);<br>
Sippl et al., Structure. 4(1 ):15-19 (1996)), "profile analysis" (see, e.g., Bowie<br>
et al., Science. 253:164-170 (1991); Gribskov et a/., Meth. Enzvm.. 183:146-<br>
159 (1990); Gribskov et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Set 84(13):4355-4358 (1987)),<br>
and "evolutionary linkage" (see, e.g., Holm era/., Nucl. Acid. Res.. 27(1):244-<br>
247 (1999), and Brenner era/., Curr. OP. Struct. BioL 7(3):369-376 (1997)).<br>
[0101] In certain embodiments, a variant of a reference antibody<br>
includes a glycosylation variant wherein the number and/or type of<br>
glycosylation sites have been altered relative to the amino acid sequence of<br>
the reference antibody. In certain embodiments, a variant of a polypeptide<br>
comprises a greater or a lesser number of N-linked glycosylation sites relative<br>
to a native polypeptide. An N-linked glycosylation site is characterized by the<br>
sequence: Asn-X-Ser or Asn-X-Thr, wherein the amino acid residue<br>
designated as X may be any amino acid residue except praline. The<br>
substitution of amino acid residues to create this sequence provides a<br>
potential new site for the addition of an N-linked carbohydrate chain.<br>
Alternatively, substitutions which eliminate this sequence will remove an<br>
existing N-linked carbohydrate chain. In certain embodiments, a<br>
rearrangement of N-linked carbohydrate chains is provided, wherein one or<br>
more N-linked glycosylation sites (typically those that are naturally occurring)<br>
are eliminated and one or more new N-linked sites are created. Exemplary<br>
antibody variants include cysteine variants wherein one or more cysteine<br>
residues are deleted from or substituted for another amino acid (e.g., serine)<br>
relative to the amino acid sequence of the reference antibody. In certain<br>
embodiments, cysteine variants may be useful when antibodies must be<br>
refolded into a biologically active conformation such as after the isolation of<br>
insoluble inclusion bodies. In certain embodiments, cysteine variants have<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
fewer cysteine residues than the native polypeptide. In certain embodiments,<br>
cysteine variants have an even number of cysteine residues to minimize<br>
interactions resulting from unpaired cysteines.<br>
[0102] According to certain embodiments, amino acid substitutions are<br>
those which: (1) reduce susceptibility to proteolysis, (2) reduce susceptibility<br>
to oxidation, (3) alter binding affinity for forming protein complexes, (4) alter<br>
binding affinities, and/or (4) confer or modify other physiochemical or<br>
functional properties on such polypeptides. According to certain<br>
embodiments, single or multiple amino acid substitutions (in certain<br>
embodiments, conservative amino acid substitutions) may be made in a<br>
naturally-occurring sequence (in certain embodiments, in the portion of the<br>
polypeptide outside the domain(s) forming intermolecular contacts). In certa in<br>
embodiments, a conservative amino acid substitution typically may not<br>
substantially change the structural characteristics of the reference sequence<br>
(e.g., in certain embodiments, a replacement amino acid should not tend to<br>
break a helix that occurs in the reference sequence, or disrupt other types of<br>
secondary structure that characterizes the reference sequence). Examples of<br>
certain art-recognized polypeptide secondary and tertiary structures are<br>
described, for example, in Proteins. Structures and Molecular Principles<br>
(Creighton, Ed., W. H. Freeman and Company, New York (1984));<br>

Publishing, New York, N.Y. (1991)); and Thornton et at. Nature 354:105<br>

[0105] The term "effective dose" or "effective amount" refers to an<br>
amount of an agent, e.g., a neutralizing antibody, that results in the reduction<br>
of symptoms in a patient or results in a desired biological outcome. In certain<br>
embodiments, an effective dose or effective amount is sufficient to reduce at<br>
least one activity of ANGPTL4. In certain embodiments, an effective dose or<br>
effective amount is determined as described below, Part V.G.<br>
[0106] The term "treatment" encompasses both therapeutic and<br>
prophylactic/preventative measures unless otherwise indicated. Those in<br>
need of treatment include, but are not limited to, individuals already having a<br>
particular condition or disorder as well as individuals who are at risk of<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
acquiring a particular condition or disorder (e.g., those needing<br>
prophylactic/preventative measures). The term "treating" refers to<br>
administering an agent to a patient for therapeutic and/or<br>
prophylactic/preventative purposes.<br>
[0107] A "therapeutic agent" refers to an agent that may be<br>
administered in vivo to bring about a therapeutic and/or<br>
prophylactic/preventative effect.<br>
[0108] A "therapeutic antibody" refers to an antibody that may be<br>
administered in vivo to bring about a therapeutic and/or<br>
prophylactic/preventative effect.<br>
[0109] The terms "isolated nucleic acid" and "isolated polynucleotide"<br>
are used interchangeably and refer to a polynucleotide of genomic, cDNA, or<br>
synthetic origin or some combination thereof. An "isolated polynucleotide11 (1)<br>
is not associated with all or a portion of a polynucleotide in which the "isolated<br>
polynucleotide" is found in nature, (2) is linked to a po lynucleotide to which it<br>
is not linked in nature, or (3) does not occur in nature as part of a larger<br>
sequence.<br>
B.       Structure of native antibodies and certain antibody<br>
fragments<br>
[0110] A native antibody typically has a tetrameric structure. A<br>
tetramer typically comprises two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each<br>
pair having one light chain (in certain embodiments, about 25 kDa) and one<br>
heavy chain (in certain embodiments, about 50-70 kDa). In a native antibody,<br>
a heavy chain comprises a variable region, VH, and three constant regions,<br>
CH1 , CH2, and CH3. The VH domain is at the amino-terminus of the heavy<br>
chain, and the CH3 domain is at the carboxy-terminus.   In a native antibody, a<br>
light chain comprises a variable region, VL, and a constant region, Q.. The<br>
variable region of the light chain is at the amino-termin us of the light chain. In<br>
a native antibody, the variable regions of each light/heavy chain pair typically<br>
form the antigen binding site. The constant regions are typically responsible<br>
for effector function.<br>
[0111] Native human light chains are typically classified as kappa and<br>
lambda light chains. Native human heavy chains are typically classified as<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
mu, delta, gamma, alpha, or epsilon, and define the antibody's isotype as IgM,<br>
IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE, respectively. IgG has subclasses, including, but not<br>
limited to, lgG1, lgG2, lgG3, and lgG4. IgM has subclasses including, but not<br>
limited to, lgM1 and lgM2. IgA has subclasses including, but not limited to,<br>
lgA1 and lgA2. Within native human light and heavy chains, the variable and<br>
constant regions are typically joined by a "J" region of about 12 or more amino<br>
acids, with the heavy chain also including a "D" region of about 10 more<br>
amino acids. See, e.g., Fundamental Immunology (1989) ch. 7 (Paul, W., ed.,<br>
2nd ed. Raven Press, N.Y.).<br>
[0112] In a native antibody, the variable regions typically exhibit the<br>
same general structure in which relatively conserved framework regions (FRs)<br>
are joined by three hypervariable regions, also called complementarity<br>
determining regions (CDRs). The CDRs from the two chains of each pair<br>
typically are aligned by the framework regions, which may enable binding to a<br>
specific epitope. From N-terminus to C-terminus, both light and heavy chain<br>
variable regions typically comprise the domains FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2,<br>
FR3, CDR3 and FR4. The CDRs on the heavy chain are referred to as H1,<br>
H2, and H3, while the CDRs on the light chain are referred to as L1, L2, and<br>
L3. Typically, CDR3 is the greatest source of molecular diversity within the<br>
antigen-binding site. H3, for example, in certain instances, can be as short as<br>
two amino acid residues or greater than 26. The assignme nt of amino acids<br>
to each domain is typically in accordance with the definitions of Kabat et al.<br>
(1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunoloqical Interest (National Institutes of<br>
Health, Publication No. 91-3242, vols. 1-3, Bethesda, MD); Chothia &amp; LeskjL<br>
Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987); or Chothia et al. Nature 342:878-883 (1989).<br>
In the present application, the term "CDR" refers to a CDR from either the light<br>
or heavy chain, unless otherwise specified.<br>
[0113] A "Fab" fragment comprises one light chain and the CH1 and<br>
variable region of one heavy chain. The heavy chain of a Fab molecule<br>
cannot form a disulfide bond with another heavy chain molecule. A" Fab'"<br>
fragment comprises one light chain and one heavy chain that comprises<br>
additional constant region, extending between the CH1 and CH2 domains. An<br>
23<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
interchain disulfide bond can be formed between two heavy chains of a Fab'<br>
fragment to form a "F(abV molecule.<br>
[0114] An "Fv" fragment comprises the va liable regions from both the<br>
heavy and light chains, but lacks the constant regions. A single-chain Fv<br>
(scFv) fragment comprises heavy and light chain variable regions connected<br>
by a flexible linker to form a single polypeptide chain with an antigen-binding<br>
region. Exemplary single chain antibodies are discussed in detail in WO<br>
88/01649 and U.S. Patent Nos. 4,946,778 and 5,260,203. In certain<br>
instances, a single variable region (one-half of an Fv) may have the ability to<br>
recognize and bind antigen, albeit with lower affinity than the Fv.<br>
[0115] As used herein, the term "heavy chain" refers to a polypeptide<br>
comprising sufficient heavy chain variable region sequence to confer antigen<br>
specificity either alone or in combination with a light chain.<br>
[0116] As used herein, the term "light chain" refers to a polypeptide<br>
comprising sufficient light chain variable region sequence to confer antigen<br>
specificity either alone or in combination with a heavy chain.<br>

chimeric monoclonal antibodies. In certain embodiments, neutralizing<br>
monoclonal antibodies are humanized monoclonal antibodies. In certain<br>
embodiments, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are human monoclonal<br>

monoclonal antibodies are useful as therapeutic antibodies in humans.<br>
[0123] In certain embodiments, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are<br>
antibody fragments. Exemplary antibody fragments include, but are not<br>
limited to, Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, Fv, scFv, Fd, diabodies, and other antibody<br>

[0124] Exemplary neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, designated<br>

within residues 21 to 174 of mouse ANGPTL4 (SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO:<br>
50). Those antibodies also neutralize ANGPTL4 activity. Thus, antibodies<br>
that bind the same epitope (e.g., in either human or mouse ANGPTL4) would<br>

[0125] In certain embodiments, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are<br>
provided that bind to the same epitope to which monoclonal antibody 14D12<br>
binds. In certain embodiments, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are<br>
provided that bind to the same epitope to which monoclonal antibody 15F2<br>

1.       Chimerized and humanized monoclonal antibodies<br>
[0128] In certain embodiments, non-human antibodies are chimerized.<br>
In certain embodiments, mouse monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind<br>
human ANGPTL4 are chimerized.   Certain exemplary methods for making<br>
chimeric antibodies are provided, for example, in Morrison et al. (1984) Proc.<br>
Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 81:6851-6855: Neuberger et al. (1984) Nature 312:604-<br>
608; Takeda et al. (1985) Nature 314:452-454; and U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
6,075,181 and 5,877,397.<br>
[0129] In certain embodiments, non-human antibodies are<br>
"humanized." In certain embodiments, mouse monoclonal antibodies that<br>
specifically bind human ANGPTL4 are humanized. In certain embodiments,<br>
27<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
mouse monoclonal antibodies raised against mouse ANGPTL4, but which<br>
specifically bind (i.e., cross react) with human ANGPTL4, are humanized. In<br>
certain embodiments, humanized antibodies retain their binding specificity<br>
and have reduced immunogenicity (e.g., reduced human anti-mouse antibody<br>
(HAMA) response) when administered to a human.   In certain embodiments,<br>
humanization is achieved by methods including, but not limited to, CDR<br>
grafting and human engineering, as described in detail below.<br>
[0130] In certain embodiments of humanized antibodies, one or more<br>
complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from the light and heavy chain<br>
variable regions of an antibody with the desired binding specificity (the "donor"<br>
antibody) are grafted onto human framework regions (FRs) in an "acceptor"<br>
antibody. Exemplary CDR grafting is described, e.g., in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
6,180,370, 5,693,762, 5,693,761, 5,585,089, and 5,530,101; Queen et al.<br>
(1989) Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 86:10029-10033.   In certain embodiments,<br>
one or more CDRs from the light and heavy chain variable regions are grafted<br>
onto consensus human FRs in an acceptor antibody. To create consensus<br>
human FRs, in certain embodiments, FRs from several human heavy chain or<br>
light chain amino acid sequences are aligned to identify a consensus amino<br>
acid sequence.<br>
[0131] In certain embodiments, certain FR amino acids in the acceptor<br>
antibody are replaced with FR amino acids from the donor antibody. In<br>
certain such embodiments, FR amino acids from the donor antibody are<br>
amino acids that contribute to the affinity of the donor antibody for the target<br>
antigen. See, e.g., in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,180,370, 5,693,762, 5,693,761,<br>
5,585,089, and 5,530,101; Queen et al. (1989) Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA<br>
86:10029-10033. In certain embodiments, computer programs are used for<br>
modeling donor and/or acceptor antibodies to identify residues that are likely<br>
to be involved in binding antigen and/or to contribute to the structure of the<br>
antigen binding site, thus assisting in the selection of residues, such as FR<br>
residues, to be replaced in the donor antibody.<br>
[O132] In certain embodiments, CDRs from a donor antibody are<br>
grafted onto an acceptor antibody comprising a human constant region. In<br>
certain such embodiments, FRs are also grafted onto the acceptor. In certain<br>
28<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
embodiments, CDRs from a donor antibody are derived from a single chain Fv<br>
antibody.   In certain embodiments, FRs from a donor antibody are derived<br>
from a single chain Fv antibody. In certain embodiments, grafted CDRs in a<br>
humanized antibody are further modified (e.g., by amino acid substitutions,<br>
deletions, or insertions) to increase the affinity of the humanized antibody for<br>
the target antigen. In certain embodiments, grafted FRs in a humanized<br>
antibody are further modified (e.g., by amino acid substitutions, deletions, or<br>
insertions) to increase the affinity of the humanized antibody for the target<br>
antigen.<br>
[0133] In certain embodiments, non-human antibodies may be<br>
humanized using a "human engineering" method. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,766,886 and 5,869,619. In certain embodiments of human engineering,<br>
information on the structure of antibody variable domains (e.g., information<br>
obtained from crystal structures and/or molecular modeling) is used to assess<br>
the likelihood that a given amino acid residue in a variable region is (a)<br>
involved in antigen binding, (b) exposed on the antibody surface (i.e.,<br>
accessible to solvent), or (c) buried within the antibody variable region (i.e.,<br>
involved in maintaining the structure of the variable region). Furthermore, in<br>
certain embodiments, human variable region consensus sequences are<br>
generated to identify residues that are conserved among human variable<br>
regions. In certain embodiments, that information provides guidance as to<br>
whether an amino acid residue in the variable region of a non-human antibody<br>
should be substituted.<br>
[0134] Certain neutralizing antibodies comprise a heavy chain<br>
comprising CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 of 14D12. Certain neutralizing<br>
antibodies comprise a heavy chain comprising CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 of<br>
15F2. Certain neutralizing antibodies comprise a heavy chain comprising<br>
CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 of 90B4. Certain neutralizing antibodies comprise a<br>
heavy chain comprising at least one CDR of 14D12. Certain neutralizing<br>
antibodies comprise a heavy chain comprising at least one CDR of 15F2.<br>
Certain neutralizing antibodies comprise a heavy chain comprising at least<br>
one CDR of 90B4. Certain neutralizing antibodies comprise a heavy chain<br>
comprising at least two CDRs of 14D12. Certain neutralizing antibodies<br>
29<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
comprise a heavy chain comprising at least two CDRs of 15F2. Certain<br>
neutralizing antibodies comprise a heavy chain comprising at least two CDRs<br>
of 90B4.<br>
[0135] Certain neutralizing antibodies comprise a light chain comprising<br>
CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 of 14D12. Certain neutralizing antibodies comprise<br>
a light chain comprising CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 of 15F2. Certain<br>
neutralizing antibodies comprise a light chain comprising CDR1, CDR2, and<br>
CDR3 of 90B4. Certain neutralizing antibodies comprise a light chain<br>
comprising at least one CDR of 14D12. Certain neutralizing antibodies<br>
comprise a light chain comprising at least one CDR of 15F2. Certain<br>
neutralizing antibodies comprise a light chain comprising at least one CDR of<br>
90B4. Certain neutralizing antibodies comprise a light chain comprising at<br>
least two CDRs of 14D12. Certain neutralizing antibodies comprise a light<br>
chain comprising at least two CDRs of 15F2.  Certain neutralizing antibodies<br>
comprise a light chain comprising at least two CDRs of 90B4.<br>
2.	Antibody isotypes<br>
[0136] In certain embodiments, an antibody against ANGPTL4 is of any<br>
isotype selected from IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE. In certain embodiments,<br>
an antibody against ANGPTL4 is of the IgG isotype. In certain such<br>
embodiments, an antibody is of the subclass lgG1, lgG2, lgG3, or lgG4. In<br>
certain embodiments, an antibody against ANGPTL4 is of the IgM isotype. In<br>
certain such embodiments, an antibody is of the subclass lgM1 or lgM2. In<br>
certain embodiments, an antibody against ANIGPTL4 is of the IgA isotype. In<br>
certain such embodiments, an antibody is of the subclass lgA1 or lgA2. In<br>
certain embodiments, an antibody against AN GPTL4 comprises a human<br>
kappa light chain and a human lgG1 or lgG2 heavy chain. In certain<br>
embodiments, an antibody against ANGPTL4 comprises a mouse kappa light<br>
chain and a mouse lgG1 or lgG2 heavy chain.<br>
3.	Modified antibodies<br>
[0137] In various embodiments, an antibody is modified to alter one or<br>
more of its properties. In certain embodiments, a modified antibody may<br>
possess advantages over an unmodified antibody, such as increased stability,<br>
increased time in circulation, or decreased immunogenicity (see, e.g., U.S.<br>
30<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
Patent No. 4,179,337). In certain embodiments, an antibody is modified by<br>
linking it to a nonproteinaceous moiety. In certain embodiments, an antibody<br>
is modified by altering the glycosylation state of the antibody, e.g., by altering<br>
the number, type, linkage, and/or position of carbohydrate chains on the<br>
antibody. In certain embodiments, an antibody is altered so that it is not<br>
glycosylated.<br>
[0138] In certain embodiments, one or more chemical moieties are<br>
linked to the amino acid backbone and/or carbohydrate residues of the<br>
antibody. Certain exemplary methods for linking a chemical moiety to an<br>
antibody are known to those skilled in the art.  Such methods include, but are<br>
not limited to, acylation reactions or alkylation reactions. See, for example,<br>
EP 0 401 384; Malik etaj. (1992), Exp. Hematol. 20:1028-1035; Francis<br>
(1992), Focus on Growth Factors. 3(2):4-10, published by Mediscript,<br>
Mountain Court, Friern Barnet Lane, London N20 OLD, UK; EP 0 154 316; EP<br>
0 401 384; WO 92/16221; WO 95/34326; WO 95/13312; WO 96/11953; WO<br>
96/19459 and WO 96/19459. In certain embodiments, any of these reactions<br>
are used to generate an antibody that is chemically modified at its amino-<br>
terminus.<br>
[0139] In certain embodiments, an antibody is linked to a detectable<br>
label, such as an enzymatic, fluorescent, isotopic or affinity label. In certain<br>
such embodiments, a detectable label allows for the detection or isolation of<br>
the antibody. In certain embodiments, a detectable label allows for the<br>
detection of an antigen bound by the antibody.<br>
[0140] In certain embodiments, an antibody is modified by linking it to<br>
one or more polymers. In certain embodiments, an antibody is linked to one<br>
or more water-soluble polymers. In certain such embodiments, linkage to a<br>
water-soluble polymer reduces the likelihood that the antibody will precipitate<br>
in an aqueous environment, such as a physiological environment. In certain<br>
embodiments, a therapeutic antibody is linked to a water-soluble polymer. In<br>
certain embodiments, one skilled in the art can select a suitable water-soluble<br>
polymer based on considerations including, but not limited to, whether the<br>
polymer/antibody conjugate will be used in the treatment of a patient and, if<br>
31<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
so, the pharmacological profile of the antibody (e.g., half-life, dosage, activity,<br>
antigenicity, and/or other factors).<br>
[0141] Certain exemplary clinically acceptable, water-soluble polymers<br>
include, but are not limited to, polyethylene glycol (PEG); polyethylene glycol<br>
propionaidehyde; copolymers of ethylene glycol/propylene glycol;<br>
monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol; carboxymethylcellulose; dextran; polyvinyl<br>
alcohol (PVA); polyvinyl pyrrolidone, poly-1, 3-dioxolane; poly-1,3,6-trioxane;<br>
ethylene/maleic anhydride copolyrner; poly-p-amino acids (either<br>
homopolymers or random copolymers); poly(n-vinyl pyrrolidone)polyethylene<br>
glycol; polypropylene glycol homopolymers (PPG) and other polyalkylene<br>
oxides; polypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide copolymers; polyoxyethylated<br>
polyols (POG) (e.g., glycerol) and other polyoxyethylated polyols;<br>
polyoxyethylated sorbitol, polyoxyethylated glucose, colonic acids or other<br>
carbohydrate polymers; and Ficoll, dextran, or mixtures thereof. Certain<br>
exemplary PEGs include, but are not limited to, certain forms known in the art<br>
to be useful in antibody modification, such as mono-(Ci-Cio) alkoxy- or<br>
aryloxy-PEG. In certain embodiments, PEG propionaidehyde may have<br>
advantages in manufacturing due to its stability in water.<br>
[0142] In certain embodiments, a water-soluble polymer is of any<br>
molecular weight. In certain embod iments, a water-soluble polymer is<br>
branched or unbranched. In certain embodiments, a water-soluble polymer<br>
has an average molecular weight of about 2 kDa to about 100 kDa, including<br>
all points between the end points of the range. In certain embodiments, a<br>
water-soluble polymer has an average molecular weight of about 5 kDa to<br>
about 40 kDa. In certain embodiments, a water-soluble polymer has an<br>
average molecular weight of about 10 kDa to about 35 kDa. In certain<br>
embodiments, a water-soluble polymer has an average molecular weight of<br>
about 15 kDa to about 30 kDa.<br>
[0143] In certain embodiments, an antibody is linked to PEG (i.e., an<br>
antibody is "pegylated"). In various embodiments, PEG has low toxicity in<br>
mammals. See Carpenter et al. (1971) Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol.. 18, 35-40.<br>
Notably, a PEG adduct of adenosine deaminase was approved in the United<br>
States for use in humans for the treatment of severe combined<br>
32<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
immunodeficiency syndrome. In various embodiments, PEG may reduce the<br>
immunogenicity of antibodies. For example, in certain embodiments, linkage<br>
of PEG to an antibody having non-human sequences may reduce the<br>
antigenicity of that antibody when administered to a human.<br>
[0144] In certain embodiments, a polymer is linked to o ne or more<br>
reactive amino acid residues in an antibody. Certain exemplary reactive<br>
amino acid residues include, but are not limited to, the alpha-amino group of<br>
the amino-terminal amino acid, the epsilon amino groups of lysine side<br>
chains, the sulfhydryl groups of cysteine side chains, the carboxyl groups of<br>
aspartyl and glutamyl side chains, the alpha-carboxyl group of the carboxy-<br>
terminal amino acid, tyrosine side chains, and activated glycosyl chains linked<br>
to certain asparagine, serine or threonine residues. Certain exemplary<br>
activated forms of PEG ("PEG reagents") suitable for direct reaction with<br>
proteins are known to those skilled in the art. For example, in certain<br>
embodiments, PEG reagents suitable for linkage to amino groups include, but<br>
are not limited to, active esters of carboxylic acid or carbonate derivatives of<br>
PEG, for example, those in which the leaving groups are N-<br>
hydroxysuccinimide, p-nitrophenol, imidazole or 1-hydroxy-2-n itrobenzene-4-<br>
sulfonate. In certain embodiments, PEG reagents containing rnaleimido or<br>
haloacetyl groups are used to modify sulfhydryl groups. In certain<br>
embodiments, PEG reagents containing amino, hydrazine and/or hydrazide<br>
groups may be used in reactions with aldehydes generated by periodate<br>
oxidation of carbohydrate groups in proteins.<br>
[0145] In certain embodiments, a water-soluble polymer has at least<br>
one reactive group. In certain embodiments, an activated derivative of a<br>
water-soluble polymer, such as PEG, is created by reacting the water-soluble<br>
polymer with an activating group. In certain embodiments, an sctivating group<br>
may be monofunctional, bifunctional, or multifunctional. Certain exemplary<br>
activating groups that can be used to link a water-soluble polymer to two or<br>
more antibodies include, but are not limited to, the following groups: sulfone<br>
(e.g., chlorosulfone, vinylsulfone and divinylsulfone), maleimide, sulfhydryl,<br>
thiol, triflate, tresylate, azidirine, oxirane and 5-pyridyl. In certai n<br>
embodiments, a PEG derivative is typically stable against hydrolysis for<br>
33<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
extended periods in aqueous environments at pHs of about 11 or less. In<br>
certain embodiments, a PEG derivative linked to another molecule, such as<br>
an antibody, confers stability from hydrolysis on that molecule.   Certain<br>
exemplary homobifunctional PEG derivatives include, but are not limited to,<br>
PEG-bjs-chlorosulfone and PEG-bjs-vinylsulfone (see WO 95/13312).<br>
D.      Certain methods of making monoclonal antibodies<br>
1.       Certain hybridoma methods<br>
[0146] In certain embodiments, monoclonal antibodies are produced by<br>
standard techniques. In certain embodiments, monoclonal antibodies are<br>
produced by hybridoma-based methods. Certain such methods are known to<br>
those skilled in the art. See, e.g., Kohler et al. (1975) Nature 256:495-497;<br>
Harlow and Lane (1988) Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual Ch. 6 (Cold Spring<br>
Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). In certain such embodiments, a<br>
suitable animal, such as a mouse, rat, hamster, monkey, or other mammal, is<br>
immunized with an immunogen to produce antibody-secreting cells. In certain<br>
embodiments, the antibody-secreting cells are B-cells, such as lymphocytes<br>
or splenocytes. In certain embodiments, lymphocytes (e.g., human<br>
lymphocytes) are immunized in vitro to generate antibody-secreting cells.<br>
See, e.g., Borreback et al. (1988) Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 85:3995-3999.<br>
[0147] In certain embodiments, antibody secreting cells are fused with<br>
an "immortalized" cell line, such as a myeloid-type cell line, to produce<br>
hybridoma cells. In certain embodiments, hybridoma cells that produce the<br>
desired antibodies are identified, for example, by ELISA. In certain<br>
embodiments, such cells can then be subcloned and cultured us ing standard<br>
methods. In certain embodiments, such cells can also be grown in vivo as<br>
ascites tumors in a suitable animal host. In certain embodiments, monoclonal<br>
antibodies are isolated from hybridoma culture medium, serum, or ascites<br>
fluid using standard separation procedures, such as affinity chromatography.<br>
Guidance for the production of hybridomas and the purification of monoclonal<br>
antibodies according to certain embodiments is provided, for exa mple, in<br>
Harlow and Lane (1988) Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual Ch. 8 (Cold Spring<br>
Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY).<br>
34<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
[0148] In certain embodiments, mouse monoclonal antibodies are<br>
produced by immunizing genetically altered mice with an immunogen. In<br>
certain such embodiments, the mice are ANGPTL4-deficient mice, which<br>
partially or completely lack ANGPTL4 function. In certain such embodiments,<br>
the mice are "knockout" mice that lack all or part of a gene encoding<br>
ANGPTL4. In certain embodiments, such knockout mice are immunized with<br>
mouse ANGPTL4. In certain embodiments, such knockout mice are<br>
immunized with human ANGPTL4.<br>
[0149] In certain embodiments, human monoclonal antibodies are<br>
raised in transgenic animals (e.g., mice) that are capable of producing human<br>
antibodies. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 6,075,181 A and 6,114,598 A; and<br>
WO 98/24893 A2. For example, in certain embodiments, human<br>
immunoglobulin genes are introduced (e.g., using yeast artificial<br>
chromosomes, human chromosome fragments, or germline integration) into<br>
mice in which the endogenous Ig genes have been inactivated. See, e.g.,<br>
Jakobovits et al. (1993) Nature 362:255-258; Tomizuka et al. (2000) Proc.<br>
Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 97:722-727; and Mendez et al. (1997) Nat. Genet.<br>
15:146-156 (describing the XenoMouse II® line of transgenic mice).<br>
[0150] In certain embodiments, such transgenic mice are immunized<br>
with an immunogen. In certain such embodiments, lymphatic cells (such as<br>
B-cells) from mice that express antibodies are obtained. In certain such<br>
embodiments, such recovered cells are fused with an "immortalized" cell line,<br>
such as a myeloid-type cell line, to produce hybridoma cells. In certain such<br>
embodiments, hybridoma cells are screened and selected to identify those<br>
that produce antibodies specific to the antigen of interest. Certain exemplary<br>
methods and transgenic mice suitable for the production of human<br>
monoclonal antibodies are described, e.g., in Jakobovits et al. (1993) Nature<br>
362:255-258; Jakobovits (1995) Curr. Qpin. Biotechnol. 6:561-566: Lonberg et<br>
al. (1995) Int. Rev. Immunol. 13:65-93; Fishwild et al. (1996) Nat. Biotechnol.<br>
14:845-851; Mendez et al. (1997) Nat. Genet. 15:146-156: Green (1999) J^<br>
Immunol. Methods 231:11-23; Tomizuka et al. (2000) Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci.<br>
USA 97:722-727; and reviewed in Little et al. (2000) Immunol. Today 21:364-<br>
370; and WO 98/24893. In certain embodiments, human monoclonal<br>
35<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
antibodies against ANGPTL4 are suitable for use as therapeutic antibodies.<br>
See Part V.G., below.<br>
2.       Certain display-based methods<br>
[0151] In certain embodiments, human monoclonal antibodies are<br>
produced using a display-based method, such as, for example, any of those<br>
described below.<br>
[0152] In certain embodiments, a monoclonal antibody is produced<br>
using phage display techniques. Certain exemplary antibody phage display<br>
methods are known to those skilled in the art and are described, for example,<br>
in Hoogenboom, Overview of Antibody Phage-Displav Technology and Its<br>
Applications, from Methods in Molecular Biology: Antibody Phage Display:<br>
Methods and Protocols (2002) 178:1-37 (O'Brien and Aitken, eds., Human<br>
Press, Totowa, NJ). For example, in certain embodiments, a library of<br>
antibodies are displayed on the surface of a filamentous phage, such as the<br>
nonlytic filamentous phage fd or M13. In certain embodiments, the antibodies<br>
are antibody fragments, such as scFvs, Fabs, Fvs with an engineered<br>
intermolecular disulfide bond to stabilize the VH-VL pair, and diabodies. In<br>
certain embodiments, antibodies with the desired binding specificity can then<br>
be selected. Certain exemplary embodiments of antibody phage display<br>
methods are described in further detail below.<br>
[0153] In certain embodiments, an antibody phage-display library can<br>
be prepared using certain methods known to those skilled in the art. See, e<br>
.g., Hoogenboom, Overview of Antibody Phaoe-Displav Technology and Its<br>
Applications, from Methods in Molecular Biology: Antibody Phaqe Display:<br>
Methods and Protocols (2002) 178:1 -37 (O'Brien and Aitken, eds., Human<br>
Press, Totowa, NJ). In certain embodiments, variable gene repertoires are<br>
prepared by PCR amplification of genomic DNA or cDNA derived from the<br>
mRNA of antibody-secreting cells. For example, in certain embodiments,<br>
cDNA is prepared from mRNA of B-cells. In certain embodiments, cDNA<br>
encoding the variable regions of heavy and light chains is amplified, for<br>
example, by PCR.<br>
[0154] In certain embodiments, heavy chain cDNA and light chain<br>
cDNA are cloned into a suitable vector. In certain embodiments, heavy chain<br>
36<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
cDNA and light chain cDNA are randomly combined during the cloning<br>
process, thereby resulting in the assembly of a cDNA library encoding diverse<br>
scFvs or Fabs. In certain embodiments, heavy chain cDNA and light chain<br>
cDNA are ligated before being cloned into a suitable vector. In certain<br>
embodiments, heavy chain cDNA and light chain cDNA are ligated by<br>
stepwise cloning into a suitable vector.<br>
[0155] In certain embodiments, cDNA is cloned into a phage display<br>
vector, such as a phagemid vector. Certain exemplary phagemid vectors,<br>
such as pCES1, are known to those skilled in the art.  In certain<br>
embodiments, cDNA encoding both heavy and light chains is present on the<br>
same vector. For example, in certain embodiments, cDNA encoding scFvs<br>
are cloned in frame with all or a portion of gene III, which encodes the minor<br>
phage coat protein pill. In certain such embodiments, the phagemid directs<br>
the expression of the scFv-plll fusion on the phage surface. Alternatively, in<br>
certain embodiments, cDNA encoding heavy chain (or light chain) is cloned in<br>
frame with all or a portion of gene III, and cDNA encoding light chain (or<br>
heavy chain) is cloned downstream of a signal sequence in the same vector.<br>
The signal sequence directs expression of the light chain (or heavy chain) into<br>
the periplasm of the host cell, where the heavy and light chains assemble into<br>
Fab fragments. Alternatively, in certain embodiments, cDNA encoding heavy<br>
chain and cDNA encoding light chain are present on separate vectors. In<br>
certain such embodiments, heavy chain and light chain cDNA is cloned<br>
separately, one into a phagemid and the other into a phage vector, which both<br>
contain signals for in vivo recombination in the host cell.<br>
[0156] In certain embodiments, recombinant phagemid or phage<br>
vectors are introduced into a suitable bacterial host, such as E. coli. In certain<br>
embodiments using phagemid, the host is infected with helper phage to<br>
supply phage structural proteins, thereby allowing expression of phage<br>
particles carrying the antibody-pill fusion protein on the phage surface.<br>
[0157] In certain embodiments, "synthetic" antibody libraries are<br>
constructed using repertoires of variable genes that are rearranged in vifro.<br>
For example, in certain embodiments, individual gene segments encoding<br>
heavy or light chains (V-D-J or V-J, respectively) are randomly combined<br>
37<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
using PCR. In certain such embodiments, additional sequence diversity can<br>
be introduced into the CDRs, and possibly FRs, e.g., by error prone PCR. In<br>
certain such embodiments, additional sequence diversity is introduced into<br>
CDR3, e.g., H3 of the heavy chain.<br>
[0158] In certain embodiments, "naTve" or "universal" phage display<br>
libraries are constructed as described above using nucleic acid from an<br>
unimmunized animal. In certain embodiments, the unimmunized animal is a<br>
human. In certain embodiments, "immunized" phage display libraries are<br>
constructed as described above using nucleic acid from an immunized animal.<br>
In certain embodiments, the immunized animal is a human, rat, mouse,<br>
hamster, or monkey. In certain such embodiments, the animals are<br>
immunized with any of the immunogens described below.<br>
[0159] Certain exemplary universal human antibody phage display<br>
libraries are available from commercial sources. Certain exemplary libraries<br>
include, but are not limited to, the HuCAL® series of libraries from MorphoSys<br>
AG (Martinstreid/Munich, Germany); libraries from Crucell (Leiden, the<br>
Netherlands) using MAbstract® technology; the n-CoDeR™ Fab library from<br>
Biolnvent (Lund, Sweden); and libraries available from Cambridge Antibody<br>
Technology (Cambridge, UK).<br>
[0160] In certain embodiments, the selection of antibodies having the<br>
desired binding specificity from a phage display library is achieved by<br>
successive panning steps. In certain embodiments of panning, library phage<br>
preparations are exposed to antigen. In certain such embodiments, th e<br>
phage-antigen complexes are washed, and unbound phage are discarded. In<br>
certain such embodiments, bound phage are recovered and subseque ntly<br>
amplified by infecting E. coli. In certain such embodiments, monoclonal<br>
antibody-producing phage may be cloned by picking single plaques. In<br>
certain embodiments, the above process is repeated.<br>
[0161] In certain embodiments, the antigen used in panning is any of<br>
the immunogens described below. In certain embodiments, the antigen is<br>
immobilized on a solid support to allow purification of antigen-binding p hage<br>
by affinity chromatography. In certain embodiments, the antigen is<br>
biotinylated, thereby allowing the separation of bound phage from unbound<br>
38<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
phage using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. In certain embodiments,<br>
the antigen may be immobilized on cells (for direct panning), in tissue<br>
cryosections, or on membranes (e.g., nylon or nitrocellulose membranes).<br>
Other variations of certain panning procedures may be routinely determined<br>
by one skilled in the art.<br>
[0162] In certain embodiments, a yeast display system is used to<br>
produce monoclonal antibodies. In certain such systems, an antibody is<br>
expressed as a fusion protein with all or a portion of the yeast AGA2 protein,<br>
which becomes displayed on the surface of the yeast cell wall. In certain such<br>
embodiments, yeast cells expressing antibodies with the desired binding<br>
specificity can then be identified by exposing the cells to fluorescently labeled<br>
antigen. In certain such embodiments, yeast cells that bind the antigen can<br>
then be isolated by flow cytometry. See, e.g., Boder et al. (1997) Nat.<br>
Biotechnol. 15:553-557.<br>
3.        Certain affinity maturation methods<br>
[0163] In certain embodiments, the affinity of an antibody for a<br>
particular antigen is increased by subjecting the antibody to affinity maturation<br>
(or "directed evolution") in vitro. In vivo, native antibodies undergo affinity<br>
maturation through somatic hypermutation followed by selection. Certain in<br>
vito methods mimic that in vivo process, thereby allowing the production of<br>
antibodies having affinities that equal or surpass that of native antibodies.<br>
[0164] In certain embodiments of affinity maturation, mutations are<br>
introduced into a nucleic acid sequence encoding the variable region of an<br>
antibody having the desired binding specificity. See, e.g., Hudson et al.<br>
(2003) Nature Med. 9:129-134; Brekke et al. (2002) Nature Reviews 2:52-62.<br>
In certain embodiments, mutations are introduced into the variable region of<br>
the heavy chain, light chain, or both. In certain embodiments, mutations are<br>
introduced into one or more CDRs. In certain such embodiments, mutations<br>
are introduced into H3, L3, or both. In certain embodiments, mutations are<br>
introduced into one or more FRs. In certain embodiments, a library of<br>
mutations is created, for example, in a phage, ribosome, or yeast display<br>
library, so that antibodies with increased affinity may be identified by standard<br>
screening methods. See, e.g., Boder et al. (2000) Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA<br>
39<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
97:10701-10705; Foote et al. (2000) Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 97:10679-<br>
10681; Hoogenboom, Overview of Antibody Phaae-Displav Technology and<br>
Its Applications, from Methods in Molecular Biology: Antibody Phaqe Display:<br>
Methods and Protocols (2002) 178:1-37 (O'Brien and Aitken, eds., Human<br>
Press, Totowa, NJ); and Hanes et al. (1998) Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA<br>
95:14130-14135.<br>
[0165] In certain embodiments, mutations are introduced by site-<br>
specific mutagenesis based on information on the antibody's structure, e.g.,<br>
the antigen binding site. In certain embodiments, mutations are introduced<br>
using combinatorial mutagenesis of CDRs. In certain embodiments, all or a<br>
portion of the variable region coding sequence is randomly mutagenized, e.g.,<br>
using E. coli mutator cells, homologous gene rearrangement, or error prone<br>
PCR. In certain embodiments, mutations are introduced using "DNA<br>
shuffling." See, e.g., Crameri et al. (1996) Nature Med. 2:100-102; Fermer et<br>
al. (2004) Tumor Biology 25:7-13.<br>
[0166] In certain embodiments, "chain shuffling" is used to generate<br>
antibodies with increased affinity. In certain embodiments of chain shuffling,<br>
one of the chains, e.g., the light chain, is replaced with a repertoire of light<br>
chains, while the other chain, e.g., the heavy chain, is unchanged, thus<br>
providing specificity. In certain such embodiments, a library of chain shuffled<br>
antibodies is created, wherein the unchanged heavy chain is expressed in<br>
combination with each light chain from the repertoire of light chains. In certain<br>
embodiments, such libraries may then be screened for antibodies with<br>
increased affinity.   In certain embodiments, both the heavy and light chains<br>
are sequentially replaced. In certain embodiments, only the variable regions<br>
of the heavy and/or light chains are replaced. In certain embodiments, only a<br>
portion of the variable regions, e.g., CDRs, of the heavy and/or light chains<br>
are replaced. See, e.g., Hudson et al. (2003) Nature Med. 9:129-134; Brekke<br>
et al. (2002) Nature Reviews 2:52-62; Kang et al. (1991) Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci.<br>
USA 88:11120-11123; Marks etal. (1992) Biotechnology 10.779-83.<br>
[0167] In certain embodiments, mouse monoclonal antibodies that<br>
specifically bind human ANGPTL4 (including, but not limited to, mouse<br>
monoclonal antibodies raised against mouse ANGPTL4 but which specifically<br>
40<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
bind (i.e., cross react) with human ANGPTL4) are subject to sequential chain<br>
shuffling.  In certain embodiments, for example, the heavy chain of a given<br>
mouse monoclonal antibody is combined with a new repertoire of human light<br>
chains, and antibodies with the desired affinity are selected. In certain such<br>
embodiments, the light chains of the selected antibodies are then combined<br>
with a new repertoire of human heavy chains, and antibodies with the desired<br>
affinity are selected. Thus, in certain embodiments, human antibodies having<br>
the desired antigen binding specificity and affinity are selected.<br>
[0168] Alternatively, in certain embodiments, the heavy chain of a given<br>
mouse monoclonal antibody is combined with a new repertoire of human light<br>
chains, and antibodies with the desired affinity are selected from this first<br>
round of shuffling. In certain embodiments, the light chain of the original<br>
mouse monoclonal antibody is combined with a new repertoire of human<br>
heavy chains, and antibodies with the desired affinity are selected from this<br>
second round of shuffling. In certain embodiments, human light chains from<br>
the antibodies selected in the first round of shuffling are then combined with<br>
human heavy chains from the antibodies selected in the second round of<br>
shuffling. Thus, in certain embodiments, human antibodies having the desired<br>
antigen binding specificity and affinity are selected.<br>
[0169] In certain embodiments, a "ribosome display" method is used<br>
that alternates antibody selection with affinity maturation. In certain<br>
embodiments of a ribosome display method, antibody-encoding nucleic acid is<br>
amplified by RT-PCR between the selection steps. Thus, in certain<br>
embodiments, error prone polymerases may be used to introduce mutations<br>
into the nucleic acid. A nonlimiting example of such a method is described in<br>
detail in Hanes et al. (1998) Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 95:14130-14135.<br>
4.        Certain recombinant methods<br>
[0170] In certain embodiments, a monoclonal antibody is produced by<br>
recombinant techniques. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567.  In certain<br>
such embodiments, nucleic acid encoding monoclonal antibody chains are<br>
cloned and expressed in a suitable host cell. For example, in certain<br>
embodiments, RNA can be prepared from cells expressing the desired<br>
antibody, such as mature B-cells or hybridoma cells, using standard methods.<br>
41<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
In certain embodiments, the RNA can then be used to make cDNA using<br>
standard methods. In certain embodiments, cDNA encoding a heavy or light<br>
chain polypeptide is amplified, for example, by PCR, using specific<br>
oligonucleotide primers. In certain embodiments, the cDNA is cloned into a<br>
suitable expression vector. In certain embodiments, the expression vector is<br>
then transformed or transfected into a suitable host cell, such as a host cell<br>
that does not endogenously produce antibody. Certain exemplary host cells<br>
include, but are not limited to, E. coli, COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary<br>
(CHO) cells, and myeloma cells. In certain embodiments, wherein heavy and<br>
light chains are coexpressed in the same host, reconstituted antibody may be<br>
isolated.<br>
[0171] In certain embodiments, cDNA encoding a heavy or light chain<br>
can be modified. For example, in certain embodiments, the constant region of<br>
a mouse heavy or light chain can be replaced with the constant region of a<br>
human heavy or light chain. In this manner, in certain embodiments, a<br>
chimeric antibody can be produced which possesses human antibody<br>
constant regions but retains the binding specificity of a mouse antibody.<br>
[0172] In certain embodiments, recombinant antibodies can be<br>
expressed in certain cell lines. In certain embodiments, sequences encoding<br>
particular antibodies can be used for transformation of a suitable mammalian<br>
host cell. According to certain embodiments, transformation can be by any<br>
known method for introducing polynucleotides into a host cell. Certain<br>
exemplary methods include, but are not limited to, packaging the<br>
polynucleotide in a virus (or into a viral vector) and transducing a host cell with<br>
the virus (or vector) and using certain transfection procedures known in the<br>
art, as exemplified by U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,399,216, 4,912,040, 4,740,461, and<br>
4,959,455. In certain embodiments, the transformation procedure used may<br>
depend upon the host to be transformed. Certain exemplary methods for<br>
introduction of heterologous polynucleotides into mammalian ceils are known<br>
in the art and include, but are not limited to, dextran-mediated transfection,<br>
calcium phosphate precipitation, polybrene mediated transfection, protoplast<br>
fusion, electroporation, encapsulation of the polynucleotide(s) in liposomes,<br>
and direct microinjection of the DNA into nuclei.<br>
42<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
[0173] Certain exemplary mammalian cell lines available as hosts for<br>
expression are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, many<br>
immortalized cell lines available from the American Type Culture Collection<br>
(ATCC), including but not limited to, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells,<br>
HeLa cells, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, monkey kidney cells (COS),<br>
human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (e.g., Hep G2), and a number of other<br>
cell lines. In certain embodiments, cell lines may be selected by determining<br>
which cell lines produce high levels of antibodies that specifically bind<br>
ANGPTL4.<br>
E.       Certain polypeptide immunogens<br>
[0174] In certain embodiments, to generate antibodies, an animal is<br>
immunized with an immunogen.   In certain embodiments, an immunogen is a<br>
polypeptide comprising ANGPTL4. In certain embodiments, an immunogen is<br>
a polypeptide comprising a fragment of ANGPTL4. In certain embodiments,<br>
an immunogen is a polypeptide comprising the N-terminal coiled-coil domain<br>
of ANGPTL4.<br>
[0175] In certain embodiments, an immunogen comprises a mouse<br>
ANGPTL4. In certain embodiments, an immunogen comprises a mouse<br>
ANGPTL4 comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1. In certain<br>
embodiments, an immunogen comprises a mouse ANGPTL4 comprising the<br>
amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 50. In certain embodiments, an<br>
immunogen comprises a fragment of mouse ANGPTL4. In certain<br>
embodiments, an immunogen comprises a fragment of SEQ ID NO: 1 from<br>
residue 21 to residue 174. In certain embodiments, an immunogen comprises<br>
a fragment of SEQ ID NO: 50 from residue 21 to residue 174. In certain<br>
embodiments, an immunogen comprises any peptide of about 10-20<br>
contiguous amino acids from residue 21 to residue 174 of SEQ ID NO: 1. In<br>
certain embodiments, an immunogen comprises any peptide of about 10-20<br>
contiguous amino acids from residue 21 to residue 174 of SEQ ID NO: 50. In<br>
certain embodiments, an immunogen comprises a peptide selected from any<br>
of SEQ ID NOs: 40 to 48. In certain embodiments, an immunogen comprises<br>
a peptide selected from SEQ ID NOs: 40, 41, 42, and 43. In certain<br>
embodiments, an immunogen comprises a peptide comprising one or more<br>
43<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
amino acid sequences selected from SEQ ID NOs: 40,41, 42, and 43. In<br>
certain embodiments, an immunogen comprises a peptide comprising SEQ ID<br>
NOs: 41, 42, and 43.   In certain such embodiments, a peptide is selected that<br>
is likely to be immunogenic. In certain such embodiments, a peptide is<br>
selected that is predicted to be hydrophilic and/or likely to be exposed on the<br>
surface of native mouse ANGPTL4 in its folded state. Exemplary guidance for<br>
selecting suitable immunogenic peptides is provided, for example, in Ausubel<br>
et al. (1989) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Ch. 11.14 (John Wiley &amp;<br>
Sons, NY); and Harlow and Lane (1988) Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual Ch.<br>
5 (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY).<br>
[0176] Certain exemplary algorithms are known to those skilled in the<br>
art for predicting whether a peptide segment of a protein is hydrophilic and<br>
therefore likely to be exposed on the surface of the protein. Certain such<br>
algorithms use the primary sequence information of a protein to make such<br>
predictions. Certain such algorithms are based on the method of, for<br>
example, Hopp and Woods (1981) Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 78:3824-3828,<br>
or Kyte and Doolittle (1982) J. Mol. Biol. 157:105-132. Certain exemplary<br>
algorithms are known to those skilled in the art for predicting the secondary<br>
structure of a protein based on the primary amino acid sequence of the<br>
protein. See, e.g., Corrigan et al. (1982) Comput. Programs Biomed. 3:163-<br>
168. Certain such algorithms are based on the method of, for example, Chou<br>
and Fasman (1978) Ann. Rev. Biochem. 47:25-276. In certain embodiments,<br>
peptide segments that are predicted to form B-turns, and are therefore likely<br>
to be exposed on the surface of a protein, may be selected as immunogens.<br>
[0177] In certain embodiments, an immunogen comprises a human<br>
ANGPTL4. In certain embodiments, an immunogen comprises a human<br>
ANGPTL4 comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2. In certain<br>
embodiments, an immunogen comprises a fragment of SEQ ID NO:2 from<br>
residue 21 to residue 169. In certain embodiments, an immunogeh comprises<br>
any peptide of about 1O-20 contiguous amino acids from residue 21 to residue<br>
169 of SEQ ID NO:2. In certain such embodiments, a peptide is selected that<br>
is likely to be immunogenic. In certain such embodiments, a peptide is<br>
selected that is predicted to be hydrophilic and/or likely to be exposed on the<br>
44<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
surface of native human ANGPTL4 in its folded state. Exemplary guidance<br>
for selecting suitable immunogenic peptides is provided, for example, in<br>
Ausubel et al. (1989) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Ch. 11.14 (John<br>
Wiley &amp; Sons, NY); and Haiiow and Lane (1988) Antibodies: A Laboratory<br>
Manua I Ch. 5 (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY).<br>
[0178] In certain embodiments, an animal is immunized with an<br>
immunogen and one or more adjuvants. In certain embodiments, an adjuvant<br>
is used to increase the immunological response, depending on the host<br>
species. Certain exemplary adjuvants include, but are not limited to, Freund's<br>
adjuvant (complete and incomplete), mineral salts such as aluminum<br>
hydroxide or aluminum phosphate, surface active substances, chitosan,<br>
lysolecithin, pluronic polyols, polyanions, peptides, oil emulsions, and<br>
potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin)<br>
and Corynebacteiium parvum. In certain embodiments, the immune response<br>
to an irnmunogen, e.g., a peptide immunogen, is enhanced by coupling the<br>
immunogen to another immunogenic molecule or "carrier protein." Certain<br>
exemplary carrier proteins include, but are not limited to, keyhole limpet<br>
hemocyanin (KLH), tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid, ovalbumin, cholera<br>
toxoid, and immunogenic fragments thereof. For exemplary guidance in<br>
coupling peptide immunogens to carrier proteins, see, e.g., Ausubel et al.<br>
(1989) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Ch. 11.15 (John Wiley &amp; Sons,<br>
NY); and Harlow and Lane (1988) Antibodies: A. Laboratory Manual Ch. 5<br>
(Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY).<br>
[O179] In certain embodiments, any of the above immunogens can be<br>
produced using standard recombinant methods.  For example, in certain<br>
embodiments, a polynucleotide encoding a mouse or human ANGPTL4 or a<br>
fragment of that polynucleotide may be cloned into a suitable expression<br>
vector.  In certain embodiments, the polynucleotide comprises the nucleic acid<br>
sequence of SEQ ID NO:3 or SEQ ID NO:4. In certain embodiments, the<br>
recombinant vector is then introduced into a suitable host cell. In certain<br>
embodiments, the polypeptide is then isolated from the host cell by standard<br>
methods. For certain exemplary methods of recombinant protein expression,<br>

(John Wiley &amp; Sons, NY).<br>
F.       Certain assays<br>
1.       Certain binding assays<br>
[0180] In certain embodiments, antibodies are screened for binding to<br>
AMGPTL4 using certain routine methods that detect binding of antibody to<br>
antigen. For example, in certain embodiments, the ability of a monoclonal<br>
antibody to bind ANGPTL4 is assayed by standard immunoblotting methods,<br>
such as Western blot. See, e.g., Ausubel et al. (1992) Current Protocols in<br>
Molecular Biology Ch. 10.8 (John Wiley &amp; Sons, NY); Harlow and Lane (1988)<br>
Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring<br>
Harbor, NY). In certain embodiments, ANGPTL4 to be used in such assays<br>
may be isolated or may be present in a complex mixture of proteins and/or<br>
macromolecules.<br>
[0181] In certain embodiments, the ability of a monoclonal antibody to<br>
bind ANGPTL4 is assayed using a competitive binding assay, which<br>
eva luates the ability of a candidate antibody to compete with a known anti-<br>
ANGPTL4 antibody for binding to ANGPTL4. In certain such embodiments,<br>
the known anti-ANGPTL4 antibody is any of the monoclonal antibodies<br>
described below in Part VI.J. In certain embodiments, a competitive binding<br>
assay is performed using ELISA. See, e.g., Hariow and Lane (1988)<br>
Anti bodies: A Laboratory Manual Ch. 14 (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold<br>
Spring Harbor, NY).<br>
[0182] In certain embodiments, a binding assay is used to quantify the<br>
binding kinetics (e.g., rate constant) or the binding affinity (e.g., association or<br>
dissociation constant) of an antibody against ANGPTL4. In certain<br>
embodiments, the kinetics or affinity of binding is determined in the "solid-<br>
phase" by immobilizing antigen (e.g., ANGPTL4) on a solid support. The<br>
immobilized antigen "captures" antibody from solution.   In certain<br>
embodiments, the kinetics or affinity of binding is determined in the "solid-<br>
phase" by immobilizing antibody (e.g., antibody against ANGPTL4) on a solid<br>
support. The immobilized antibody "captures" antigen from solution.<br>
46<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
[0183] In certain embodiments, binding kinetics or binding affinity is<br>
determined using ELISA-based methods. In certain embodiments, binding<br>
kinetics or binding affinity is determined using biosensor-based technology,<br>
such as Biacore surface plasmon resonance technology (Biacore,<br>
Piscataway, NJ). Certain such methods are known to those skilled in the art.<br>
See, e.g., McCafferty et al. (eds.) (1996) Antibody Engineering: A Practical<br>
Approach (IRL, Oxford, UK); Goldberg et al. (1993) Curr. Opin. Immunol.<br>
5:278-281; Karlsson et al. (1991) J. Immunol. Methods 145:229-240;<br>
Malmqvist (1993) Curr. Opin. Immunol. 5:282-286; for review, see<br>
Hoogenboom, Overview of Antibody Phage-Displav Technology and Its<br>
Applications, from Methods in Molecular Biology: Antibody Phage Display:<br>
Methods and Protocols (2002) 178:1-37 at 19 (O'Brien and Aitken, eds.,<br>
Human Press, Totowa, NJ).<br>
[0184] In certain embodiments, the binding kinetics or binding affinity of<br>
a Fab fragment that specifically binds to ANGPTL4 is determined. In certain<br>
instances, Fab fragments have the property of not multimerizing.<br>
Multimerization can, in certain instances, complicate the measurement of<br>
binding kinetics and binding affinity in "solid phase" methods. See, e.g.,<br>
Hoogenboom, Overview of Antibody Phage-Displav Technology and Its<br>
Applications, from Methods in Molecular Biology:   Antibody Phage Display:<br>
Methods and Protocols (2002) 178:1-37 at 19 (O'Brien and Aitken, eds.,<br>
Human Press, Totowa, NJ). Thus, in certain embodiments, a Fab fragment<br>
that specifically binds to ANGPTL4 is suitable for use in a binding assay in<br>
which antigen is immobilized to a solid support, such as, for example, an<br>
ELISA-based assay or a Biacore assay. In certai n embodiments, Fab<br>
fragments are generated from an intact antibody that specifically binds to<br>
ANGPTL4 using enzymatic methods. In certain embodiments, Fab fragments<br>
are produced by expressing nucleic acids encoding Fab fragments in a<br>
recombinant expression system, such as those described above, Part V.D.3.<br>
[0185] In certain embodiments, the binding kinetics or binding affinity of<br>
an antibody against ANGPTL4 is determined using "solution phase" methods.<br>
In such methods, the kinetics or affinity of binding is measured for an<br>
antibody-antigen complex in solution. Certain such methods are known to<br>
47<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
those skilled in the art. A nonlimiting example of such a method is the "kinetic<br>
exclusion assay," or "KinExA." See, e.g., Blake et al. (1996) J. Biol. Chem.<br>
271:27677-27685; Drake et al. (2004-) Anal. Biochem. 328:35-43 (comparing<br>
Biacore "solid phase" and KinExA "solution phase" methods). In certain<br>
embodiments, instrumentation for performing KinExA is supplied by Sapidyne<br>
Instruments, Inc. (Boise, ID).<br>
[0186] In certain embodiments, the binding kinetics or binding affinity of<br>
a multivalent antibody or an antibody that multimerizes is determined using a<br>
solution phase method. In certain instances, the measurement of the binding<br>
kinetics or the binding affinity of a mu Itivalent antibody or an antibody that<br>
multimerizes is amenable to solution phase analysis.<br>
[0187] In certain embodiments, the binding affinity of an anti-ANG PTL4<br>
antibody, as measured by its KD, is about 10^M or less. In certain<br>
embodiments, the binding affinity of an anti-ANGPTL4 antibody is about 10'7<br>
M, about 10"8 M, or about 10~9 M or less. In certain such embodiments, an<br>
anti-ANGPTL4 antibody may be used as a therapeutic antibody. See, e.g.,<br>
Hudson et al. (2003) Nature Med. 9:129-134. In certain embodiments,<br>
binding affinities of less than 10"9M (e.g., binding affinities from about 50O pM<br>
to about 0.5 pM, including but not limited to, binding affinities from about 100<br>
pM to about 5 pM) are achievable, e.g., using affinity maturation techniques.<br>
See, e.g., Boder et al. (2000) Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 97:10701-10705.<br>
[0188] In certain embodiments, a monoclonal antibody that was raised<br>
against mouse ANGPTL4 is screened for specific binding to human ANG PTL4<br>
using certain routine detection methods, e.g., such as those described herein.<br>
The ability of a monoclonal antibody to bind both mouse and human<br>
ANGPTL4 (i.e., to demonstrate "cross-reactivity") indicates the presence of<br>
the same epitope in mouse and human ANGPTL4. In certain embodiments of<br>
detection methods that use denaturing conditions (e.g., Western blot), cross-<br>
reactivity indicates that a mouse monoclonal antibody binds to the same<br>
"linear" epitope in mouse and human A.NGPTL4. In certain embodiments of<br>
detection methods that use non-denaturing conditions, cross-reactivity<br>
indicates that a mouse monoclonal antibody binds to the same epitope (e.g., a<br>
linear epitope or a conformational epitope) in mouse and human ANGPTL4.<br>
48<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
2.	Certain methods for epitope mapping<br>
[0189] In various embodiments, the epitope to which a monoclonal<br>
antibody binds is identified by any of a number of assays. Certain exemplary<br>
assays are described, for example, in Moms, Methods in Molecular Biology<br>
Vol.66: Epitope Mapping Protocols (1996) (Humana Press, Totowa, NJ). For<br>
example, epitope mapping may be achieved by gene fragment expression<br>
assays or peptide-based assays. In certain embodiments of a gene fragment<br>
expression assay, for example, nucleic acids encoding fragments of<br>
ANGPTL4 are expressed in prokaryotic cells and isolated. In certain such<br>
embodiments, the ability of a monoclonal antibody to bind those fragments is<br>
then assessed, e.g., by immunoprecipitation or immunoblotting. In certain<br>
embodiments, nucleic acids encoding fragments of ANGPTL4 are transcribed<br>
and translated in vitro in the presence of radioactive amino acids. The<br>
radioactively labeled fragments of ANGPTL4 are then tested for binding to a<br>
monoclonal antibody. In certain embodiments, fragments of ANGPTL4 are<br>
generated by proteolytic fragmentation. In certain embodiments, an epitope is<br>
identified using libraries of random peptides displayed on the surface of phage<br>
or yeast. In certain embodiments, an epitope is identified by testing a library<br>
of overlapping synthetic peptide fragments of ANGPTL4 for binding to a<br>
monoclonal antibody. In certain embodiments, an epitope is identified using a<br>
competition assay, such as those described below.<br>
3.	Certain competition assays<br>
[0190] In certain embodiments, monoclonal antibodies that bind to the<br>
same epitope of ANGPTL4 as a monoclonal antibody of interest are identified.<br>
In certain embodiments, such monoclonal antibodies are identified by epitope<br>
mapping, e.g., as described above. In certain embodiments, such monoclonal<br>
antibodies are identified by routine competition assays. See, e.g., Hartow and<br>
Lane (1988) Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual ch. 14 (Cold Spring Harbor<br>
Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). In a nonlimiting exemplary competition<br>
assay, ANGPTL4 or a fragment thereof is immobilized onto the wells of a<br>
multiwell plate. In certain such embodiments, the monoclonal antibody of<br>
interest is labeled with a fluorescent label (in certain embodiments, fluorescein<br>
isothiocyanate) by standard methods. In certain such embodiments, mixtures<br>
49<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
of the labeled monoclonal antibody of interest and an un labeled test<br>
monoclonal antibody are added to the wells. In certain such embodiments,<br>
the fluorescence in each well is quantified to determine the extent to which the<br>
unlabeled test monoclonal antibody blocks the binding of the labeled<br>
monoclonal antibody of interest. In certain embodiments, monoclonal<br>
antibodies are deemed to share an epitope if each blocks the binding of the<br>
other by 50% or greater. Exemplary competition assays are also described,<br>
e.g., in Morris, Methods in Molecular Biology Vol.66: Epitope Mapping<br>
Protocols (1996) (Humana Press, Totowa, NJ). A nonlimiting exemplary<br>
competition assay is provided below, Part VI.O.<br>
4.        Certain assays for identifying neutralizing antibodies<br>
[0191] In certain embodiments, monoclonal antibodies are screened for<br>
those that are neutralizing antibodies, i.e., those that reduce an activity of<br>
ANGPTL4 in vivo and/or in vitro. In certain embodiments, an activity of<br>
ANGPTL4 is the ability of ANGPTL4 to inhibit LPL Thus, in certain<br>
embodiments, a neutralizing antibody is identified by its ability to increase LPL<br>
activity in the presence of ANGPTL4. In certain such embodiments, a<br>
neutralizing antibody increases LPL activity by at least about 20%, 30%, 40%,<br>
50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or 95%, relative to a control antibody. Certain<br>
exemplary assays for measuring LPL activity in vivo and in vitro are provided<br>
below, Part VI.D. and VI.I, respectively.<br>
[0192] In certain embodiments, a neutralizing antibody that reduces an<br>
activity of ANGPTL4 in vivo is identified by its ability to decrease the level of at<br>
least one serum lipid. Certain exemplary serum lipids include, but are not<br>
limited to, triglycerides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids. In certain such<br>
embodiments, a neutralizing antibody decreases the level of at least one<br>
serum lipid by at least about 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%,<br>
90%, or 95%, relative to a control antibody. In certain embodiments, a<br>
neutralizing antibody that reduces an activity of ANGPTL4 in vivo is identified<br>
by its ability to counteract or confer protection from certain effects of a fat-<br>
containing diet. Certain exemplary effects include, but are not limited to,<br>
weight gain, obesity, glucose intolerance (hyperglycemia), insulin insensitivity<br>
(hyerpinsulinemia), hepatic steatosis (fatty liver), and intramyocellular lipid<br>
50<br><br>

accumulation. Certain exemplary assays for measuring such effects are<br>
provided below, Part VI.C, VI.E., and VI.F.<br>
G.      Certain pharmaceutical compositions and methods of<br>
treatment using neutralizing monoclonal antibodies<br>
[0193] In certain embodiments, a neutralizing antibody may be used as<br>
a therapeutic antibody. Certain exemplary neutralizing antibodies to be used<br>
as therapeutic antibodies include, but are not limited to, chimeric antibodies,<br>
humanized antibodies, and human antibodies. Those skilled in the art are<br>
familiar with the use of certain antibodies as therapeutic agents. For example,<br>
over a dozen antibodies have been approved by the FDA for use as<br>
therapeutic agents since the mid-1980s. See, e.g., Hudson et al. (2O03)<br>
Nature Med. 9:129-134; Gura (2002) Nature 417:584-586; Brekke et al.<br>
(2002) Nature Reviews 2:52-62. Certain FDA-approved antibodies include<br>
those used to treat various cancers, inflammation, and viral infections and to<br>
prevent transplant rejection. See, e.g., Gura (2002) Nature 417:584-586;<br>
Brekke et al. (2002) Nature Reviews 2:52-62. Furthermore, over a dozen<br>
antibodies are currently in clinical trials. See, e.g., Brekke et al. (2002) Nature<br>
Reviews 2:52-62.<br>
[0194] In certain embodiments, methods are provided fortreati ng a<br>
disorder of lipid metabolism comprising administering an effective am ount of a<br>
neutralizing antibody against ANGPTL4. In certain embodiments, methods<br>
are provided for treating an acute disorder of lipid metabolism comprising<br>

ANGPTL4. In certain embodiments, methods are provided for treating a<br>
chronic disorder of lipid metabolism comprising administering an effective<br>

that raises high density lipoprotein (HDL). Nonlimiting examples of such<br>
agents include, but are not limited to, cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP)<br>
inhibitors.<br>
[0199] In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition is<br>
provided that comprises an effective amount of an antibody to ANGPTL4 and<br>
a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier, solubilizer, emulsifier,<br>
preservative and/or adjuvant. In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical<br>
composition is provided that comprises an effective amount of an antibody to<br>
ANGPTL4 and an effective amount of at least one additional therapeutic<br>
agent, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier, solubilizer,<br>
emulsifier, preservative and/or adjuvant. In certain embodiments, the at least<br>
one additional therapeutic agent is selected from those described above.<br>
[0200] In certain embodiments, formulation materials for<br>
pharmaceutical compositions are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and<br>
concentrations employed.<br>
. [0201] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprises formulation materials for modifying, maintaining or preserving, for<br>
example, the pH, osmolarity, viscosity, clarity, color, isotonicity, odor, sterility,<br>
stability, rate of dissolution or release, adsorption or penetration of the<br>
composition. In certain embodiments, suitable formulation materials include,<br>
but are not limited to, amino acids (for example, glycine, glutamine,<br>
asparagine, arginine and lysine); antimicrobials; antioxidants (for example,<br>
ascorbic acid, sodium sulfrte and sodium hydrogen-sulfrte); buffers (for<br>
example, borate, bicarbonate, Tris-HCI, citrates, phosphates and other<br>
organic acids); bulking agents (for example, mannitol and glycine); chelating<br>

hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin); fillers; monosaccharides, disaccharides,<br>
and other carbohydrates (for example, glucose, mannose and dextrins);<br>

example, polyvinylpyrrolidone); low molecular weight polypeptides; salt-<br>
forming counterions (for example, sodium); preservatives (for example,<br>
benzalkonium chloride, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, thimerosal, phenethyl<br>
alcohol, methylparaben, propylparaben, chlorhexidine, sorbic acid and<br>
hydrogen peroxide); solvents (for example, glycerin, propylene glycol and<br>
polyethylene glycol); sugar alcohols (for example, mannitol and sorbrtol);<br>
suspending agents; surfactants or wetting agents (for example, pluronics,<br>
PEG, sorbitan esters, polysorbates (for example, polysorbate 20 and<br>
polysorbate 80), triton, tromethamine, lecithin, cholesterol, and tyloxapa I);<br>
stability enhancing agents (for example, sucrose and sorbitol); tonicity<br>
enhancing agents (for example, alkali metal halides (for example, sodium or<br>
potassium chloride), mannitol, and sorbitol); delivery vehicles; diluents;<br>
excipients; and pharmaceutical adjuvants. (Remington's Pharmaceutical<br>
Sciences, 18th Edition, A.R. Gennaro, ed., Mack Publishing Company (1 990).<br>
[0202] In certain embodiments, an antibody to ANGPTL4 or other<br>
therapeutic molecule is linked to a half-life extending vehicle. Certain<br>
exemplary half-life extending vehicles are known in the art. Certain such<br>
vehicles include, but are not limited to, the Fc domain, polyethylene glycol,<br>
and dextran. Certain such vehicles are described, e.g., in published PCT<br>
Application No. WO 99/25044.<br>
[0203] In certain embodiments, an optimal pharmaceutical composition<br>
will be determined by one skilled in the art depending upon, for example, the<br>
intended route of administration, delivery format, and desired dosage. See,<br>
e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, supra. In certain embodiments,<br>
such compositions may influence the physical state, stability, rate of in vfvo<br>
release, or rate of in vivo clearance of a neutralizing antibody.<br>
[0204] In certain embodiments, a primary vehicle or carrier in a<br>
pharmaceutical composition may be either aqueous or non-aqueous in nature.<br>
55<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
For example, in certain embodiments, a suitable vehicle or carrier may be<br>
water for injection, physiological saline solution, or artificial cerebrospinal fluid,<br>
possibly supplemented with other materials common in compositions for<br>
parenteral administration. Certain exemplary vehicles include, but are not<br>
limited to, neutral buffered saline and saline mixed with serum albumin. In<br>
certain embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions comprise Tris buffer of<br>
about pH 7.0-8.5, or acetate buffer of about pH 4.0-5.5, which may further<br>
include sorbitol or a suitable substitute therefor. In certain embodiments, a<br>
composition comprising an antibody to ANGPTL4, with or without at least one<br>
additional therapeutic agents, may be prepared for storage by mixing the<br>
selected composition having the desired degree of purity with optional<br>
formulation agents (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, supra) in the form<br>
of a lyophilized cake or an aqueous solution. In certain embodiments, a<br>
composition comprising an antibody to ANGPTL4, with or without at least one<br>
additional therapeutic agent, may be formulated as a lyophilizate using<br>
appropriate excipients such as sucrose.<br>
[0205] In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition is<br>
selected for parenteral delivery. In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical<br>
composition is selected for inhalation or for delivery through the digestive<br>
tract, such as orally. Certain exemplary techniques for preparing<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable compositions are within the skill of one skilled in<br>
the art.<br>
[0206] In certain embodiments, formulation components are present in<br>
concentrations that are acceptable to the site of administration. In certain<br>
embodiments, buffers are used to maintain the composition at physiological<br>
pH or at a slightly lower pH, typically within a pH range of from about 5 to<br>
about 8.<br>
[0207] In certain embodiments, when parenteral administration is<br>
contemplated, a pharmaceutical composition may be in the form of a pyrogen-<br>
free, parenteraily acceptable aqueous solution comprising the desired<br>
antibody to ANGPTL4, with or without additional therapeutic agents, in a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. In certain embodiments, a vehicle for<br>
parenteral injection is sterile distilled water in which the antibody to ANGPTL4,<br>
56<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
with or without at least one additional therapeutic agent, is formulated as a<br>
sterile, isotonic solution, properly preserved. In certain embodiments, the<br>
preparation can involve the formulation of the desired molecule with an agent,<br>
such as injectable microspheres, bio-erodible particles, polymeric compounds<br>
(such as polylactic acid or polyglycolic acid), beads or liposomes, thst may<br>
provide for the controlled or sustained release of the product which may then<br>
be delivered via a depot injection. In certain embodiments, hyaluron ic acid<br>
may also be used, and may have the effect of promoting sustained duration in<br>
the circulation. In certain embodiments, implantable drug delivery devices<br>
may be used to introduce the desired molecule.<br>
[0208] In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition may be<br>
formulated for inhalation. In certain embodiments, an antibody to AMGPTL4,<br>
with or without at least one additional therapeutic agent, may be formulated as<br>
a dry powder for inhalation. In certain embodiments, an inhalation solution<br>
comprising an antibody to ANGPTL4, with or without at least one additional<br>
therapeutic agent, may be formulated with a propellant for aerosol delivery. In<br>
certain embodiments, solutions may be nebulized.<br>
[0209] In certain embodiments, a formulation may be administered<br>
orally. In certain embodiments, an antibody to ANGPTL4, with or witf-iout at<br>
least one additional therapeutic agent, that is administered in this fashion may<br>
be formulated with or without carriers customarily used in the compounding of<br>
solid dosage forms such as tablets and capsules. In certain embodiments, a<br>
capsule may be designed to release the active portion of the formulation at<br>
the point in the gastrointestinal tract when bioavailabifity is maximized and<br>
pre-systemic degradation is minimized. In certain embodiments, at least one<br>
additional agent can be included to facilitate absorption of the antibody to<br>
ANGPTL4 with or without any additional therapeutic agents. In certai n<br>
embodiments, diluents, flavorings, low melting point waxes, vegetable oils,<br>
lubricants, suspending agents, tablet disintegrating agents, and/or binders<br>
may also be employed.<br>
[0210] In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprises an effective amount of an antibody to ANGPTL4, with or without at<br>
least one additional therapeutic agent, in a mixture with non-toxic exci pients<br>
57<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. In certain embodiments, by<br>
dissolving the tablets in sterile water, or another appropriate vehicl e, solutions<br>
may be prepared in unit-dose form. Certain exemplary excipients include, but<br>
are not limited to, inert diluents (for example, calcium carbonate, sodium<br>
carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, lactose, and calcium phosphate); binding<br>
agents (for example, starch, gelatin, and acacia); and lubricating agents (for<br>
example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, and talc).<br>
[0211] Additional pharmaceutical compositions will be evident to those<br>
skilled in the art, including formulations comprising an antibody to ANGPTL4,<br>
with or without at least one additional therapeutic agent, in sustained- or<br>
controlled-delivery formulations. Certain exemplary sustained- or controlled-<br>
delivery formulations include, but are not limited to, liposome carriers, bio-<br>
erodible microparticles, porous beads, and depot injections. Certain<br>
exemplary techniques for preparing certain formulations are known to those<br>
skilled in the art. In certain embodiments, sustained-release preparations<br>
may include semipermeable polymer matrices in the form of shaped articles,<br>
e.g. films or microcapsules. Certain exemplary sustained release matrices<br>
include, but are not limited to, polyesters, hydrogels, polylactides (see, e.g.,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,773,919 and EP 058,481), copolymers of L-glutamic acid<br>
and gamma ethyl-L-glutamate (see, e.g., Sidman etal. (1983) Biopolymers<br>
22:547-556), poly (2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) (see, e.g., Langer ef al.<br>
(1981) J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 15:167-277 and Langer (1982) Chem. Tech.<br>
12:98-105), ethylene vinyl acetate (Langer etal., supra), and poly-D
hydroxybutyric acid (EP 133,988). In certain embodiments, sustained release<br>
compositions may include liposomes, which can be prepared, in certain<br>
embodiments, by any of several methods known in the art. See e.g., Eppstein<br>
etal. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 82:3688-3692; EP 036,676; EP<br>
088,046; and EP 143,949.<br>
[0212] In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition to be<br>
used for in vivo administration typically is sterile. In certain embodiments, this<br>
may be accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes. In<br>
certain embodiments, where the composition is lyophilized, sterilization using<br>
this method may be conducted either prior to or following lyophilization and<br>
58<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
reconstitution. In certain embodiments, the composition for parenteral<br>
administration may be stored in lyophilized form or in a solution. In certain<br>
embodiments, parenteral compositions generally are placed into a container<br>
having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial<br>
having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle.<br>
[0213] In certain embodiments, once the pharmaceutical composition<br>
has been formulated, it may be stored in sterile vials as a solution,<br>
suspension, gel, emulsion, solid, or as a dehydrated or lyophilized powder. In<br>
certain embodiments, such formulations may be stored either in a ready-to-<br>
use form or in a form (e.g., lyophilized) that is reconstituted prior to<br>
administration.<br>
[0214] In certain embodiments, kits for producing a single-dose<br>
administration unit are provided. In certain embodiments, the kits may each<br>
contain both a first container having a dried protein and a second container<br>
having an aqueous formulation. In certain embodiments, kits containing<br>
single or multi-chambered pre-filled syringes (e.g., liquid syringes and<br>
lyosyringes) are included.<br>
[0215] In certain embodiments, the effective amount of a<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising an antibody to ANGPTL4, with or<br>
without at least one additional therapeutic agent, to be employed<br>
therapeutically will depend, for example, upon the context and objectives of<br>
treatment. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the appropriate dosage<br>
levels for treatment, according to certain embodiments, will thus vary<br>
depending, in part, upon the molecule delivered, the indication for which the<br>
antibody to ANGPTL4, with or without at least one additional therapeutic<br>
agent, is being used, the route of administration, and the size (body weight,<br>
body surface or organ size) and/or condition (the age and general health) of<br>
the patient. In certain embodiments, the clinician may titer the dosage and<br>
modify the route of administration to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect. In<br>
certain embodiments, a typical dosage may range from about 0.1 ng/kg of<br>
patient body weight, up to about 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors<br>
mentioned above. In certain embodiments, the dosage may range from 0.1<br>
ng/kg up to about 100 mg/kg; 1 |ig/kg up to about 100 mg/kg; or 5 jag/kg up to<br>
59<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
about 100 mg/kg, including all points (including fractions) between any of the<br>
foregoing endpoints. In certain embodiments, the dosage is between about<br>
10 mg/kg body weight and about 60 mg/kg body weight In certain<br>
embodiments, the dosage is about 10 mg/kg body weight, about 20 mg/kg<br>
body weight, about 30 mg/kg body weight, about 40 mg/kg body weight, about<br>
50 mg/kg body weight, or about 60 mg/kg body weight.<br>
[0216] In certain embodiments, a suitable dosage may be determined<br>
based on animal studies, such as those provided below, for exa mple, in Parts<br>
VI.P, R, and T to Y.<br>
[0217] In certain embodiments, the frequency of dosing will take into<br>
account the pharmacokinetic parameters of an antibody to ANG PTL4 and, if<br>
applicable, any additional therapeutic agents in the formulation used. In<br>
certain embodiments, a clinician will administer the composition until a dosage<br>
is reached that achieves the desired effect. In certain embodiments, the<br>
composition may therefore be administered as a single dose, or as two or<br>
more doses (which may or may not contain the same amount of the desired<br>
molecule) over time, or as a continuous infusion via an implantation device or<br>
catheter. In certain embodiments, further refinement of the appropriate<br>
dosage is routinely made by those skilled in the art and is within the ambit of<br>
tasks routinely performed by them. In certain embodiments, appropriate<br>
dosages may be ascertained through use of appropriate dose-response data.<br>
In certain embodiments, a patient receives one dose of a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising an antibody to ANGPTL4. In certain embodiments, a<br>
patient receives one, two, three, or four doses per day of a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising an antibody to ANGPTL4. In certain em bodiments, a<br>
patient receives one, two, three, four, five, or six doses per week, of a<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising an antibody to ANGPTL-4. In certain<br>
embodiments, a patient receives one or two doses per month of a<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising an antibody to ANGPTL-4.<br>
[0218] In certain embodiments, the route of administration of the<br>
pharmaceutical composition is in accord with known methods, e.g. orally,<br>
through injection by intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracerebral (intra-<br>
parenchymal), intracerebroventricular, intramuscular, intra-ocular, intraarterial,<br>
60<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
intraportal, or intralesional routes; by sustained release systems or by<br>
implantation devices. In certain embodiments, the compositions may be<br>
administered by bolus injection or continuously by infusion, or by implantation<br>
device.<br>
[0219] In certain embodiments, the composition may be administered<br>
locally via implantation of a membrane, sponge or another appropriate<br>
material onto which the desired molecule has been absorbed or<br>
encapsulated. In certain embodiments, where an implantation device is used,<br>
the device may be implanted into any suitable tissue or organ, and delivery of<br>
the desired molecule may be via diffusion, timed-release bolus, or continuous<br>
administration.<br>
[0220] In certain embodiments, it may be desirable to use a<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising an antibody to ANGPTL4, with or<br>
without at least one additional therapeutic agent, in an ex vivo manner. In<br>
certain such instances, cells, tissues and/or organs that have been removed<br>
from the patient are exposed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising an<br>
antibody to ANGPTL4, with or without at least one additional therapeutic<br>
agent, after which the cells, tissues and/or organs are subsequently implanted<br>
back into the patient.<br>
[0221] In certain embodiments, an antibody to ANGPTL4, with or<br>
without at least one additional therapeutic agent is delivered by implanting<br>
certain cells that have been genetically engineered, using methods such as<br>
those described herein, to express and secrete the polypeptides. In certain<br>
embodiments, such cells may be animal or human cells, and may be<br>
autoiogous, heterologous, or xenogeneic. In certain embodiments, the cells<br>
may be immortalized. In certain embodiments, in order to decrease the<br>
chance of an immunological response, the cells may be encapsulated to avoid<br>
infiltration of surrounding tissues. In certain embodiments, the encapsulation<br>
materials are typically biocompatible, semi-permeable polymeric enclosures<br>
or membranes that allow the release of the protein produces) but prevent the<br>
destruction of the cells by the patient's immune system or by other detrimental<br>
factors from the surrounding tissues.<br>

WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
H.      Certain methods of detection and diagnosis<br>
[0222] In certain embodiments, antibodies against ANGPTL4 are used<br>
to detect the presence of ANGPTL4 in vivo or in vitro. In certain<br>
embodiments, the level of ANGPTL4 in vivo is correlated with a medical<br>
condition, such as a disorder of lipid metabolism, thereby allowing diagnosis<br>
of the medical condition. Certain exemplary medical conditions that may be<br>
diagnosed by an antibody against ANGPTL4 are set forth above.<br>
[0223] Certain exemplary detection methods are known in the art and<br>
include, but are not limited to, ELISA, radioimmunoassay, immunoblot,<br>
Western blot, immunofluorescence, and immunoprecipitation. In certain<br>
embodiments, antibodies against ANGPTL4 are modified so that they may be<br>
directly detected, for example, by linking the antibody to a label. Certain<br>
exemplary labels include, but are not limited to, fluorophores, chromophores,<br>
radioactive atoms, electron-dense reagents, enzymes, and ligands. In certain<br>
embodiments, antibodies against ANGPTL4 are detected by using a labeled<br>
"secondary" antibody that binds to a class of antibodies (e.g., a goat anti-<br>
mouse antibody).<br>
I.        Certain screening methods for ANGPTL4 antagonists and<br>
agonists<br>
[0224] In certain embodiments, a method of screening for an agent that<br>
binds to ANGPTL4 is provided. In certain embodiments, a screening method<br>
comprises exposing ANGPTL4 to one or more candidate agents under<br>
suitable conditions and assessing binding of ANGPTL4 to the one or more<br>
candidate agents. In certain embodiments, a screening method comprises<br>
using an antibody against ANGPTL4 in a competitive binding assay. In<br>
certain such embodiments, a first binding mixture comprising an antibody<br>
against ANGPTL4 and ANGPTL4 is used. The amount of binding between<br>
ANGPTL4 and the antibody in the first binding mixture (Mo) is measured. A<br>
second binding mixture comprising the antibody, ANGPTL4, and an agent to<br>
be screened is also used. The amount of binding between ANGPTL4 and the<br>
antibody in the second binding mixture (M1 is measured. The amount of<br>
binding in the first binding mixture is compared with the amount of binding in<br>
the second binding mixture, for example, by calculating the M1/Mo ratio. An<br>
62<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
agent is considered to be capable of binding ANGPTL4 if the amount of<br>
binding of antibody to ANGPTL4 in the second binding mixture is less than the<br>
amount of binding of antibody to ANGPTL4 in the first binding mixture. In<br>
certain embodiments, an agent that binds ANGPTL4 decreases the binding of<br>
antibody to ANGPTL4 by at least about 10% (i.e., M-1/Mo<o.9 by at least></o.9>
about 30% (i.e., M1Mo
least about 70% (i.e., Mi/M0
at least about 90% (i.e., M1/M0
M1/M0
[0225] In certain embodiments, the ANGPTL4 to be used in any of the<br>
screening methods described above is the N-terminal coiled-coil domain of<br>
ANGPTL4 or a fragment thereof. Based on the applicants' observation that<br>
certain antibodies that bind within the N-terminal coiled-coil domain of<br>
ANGPTL4 have neutralizing activity (see below, Part VI.L and VI.P.), an<br>
agent (e.g., an antibody or a non-antibody agent) identified by a screening<br>
method as binding to the N-terminal coiled-coil domain of ANGPTL4 is a<br>
candidate antagonist of ANGPTL4 activity. In certain embodiments,<br>
antagonist activity is verified by demonstrating that the candidate antagonist<br>
neutralizes ANGPTL4 in an in vivo or in vitro assay, such as those describe in<br>
Part VI.D. and VI.I. In certain embodiments, antagonists of ANGPTL4 are<br>
used in the treatment of disorders of lipid metabolism.<br>
[0226] In certain embodiments, methods of screening for agents that<br>
bind to the fibrinogen domain of ANGPTL4 are provided. Based on the<br>
applicants' observation that an antibody (6G11) that binds within the<br>
fibrinogen domain of ANGPTL4 enhances ANGPTL4 activity (see Part VI.L,<br>
VI.P), an agent (e.g., an antibody or a non-antibody agent) identified by a<br>
screening method as binding to the fibrinogen domain of ANGPTL4 is a<br>
candidate agonist of ANGPTL4 activity. In certain embodiments, agonist<br>
activity is verified by demonstrating that the candidate agonist enhances<br>
ANGPTL4 in an in vitro assay, such as the assay describe in Part Vl.l., or by<br>
administering the candidate agonist in vivo and testing for increased levels of<br>
one or more serum lipids. In certain embodiments, agonists of ANGPTL4 are<br>
used in the treatment of certain disorders related to excessive weight loss,<br>
63<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and the cachexia (wasting)<br>
associated with diseases such as cancer, cystic fibrosis, and AIDS.<br>
[0227] Certain exemplary agents that can be screened for binding to<br>
ANGPTL4 include, but are not limited to, antibodies, small molecules (e.g.,<br>
organic compounds, organometallic compounds, salts of organic and<br>
organometallic compounds, saccharides, amino acids, nucleosides, and<br>
nucleotides), aptamers, peptides, and peptide mimetics. Certain exemplary<br>
peptides include soluble peptides, which include, but are not limited to,<br>
members of random peptide libraries (see, e.g., Lam et al. (1991) Nature<br>
354:82-84; Houghten et al. (1991) Nature 354:84-86) and members of<br>
combinatorial chemistry-derived molecular libraries m ade of D- and/or L-<br>
configuration amino acids; and phosphopeptides, which include, but are not<br>
limited to, members of random or partially degenerate, directed<br>
phosphopeptide libraries (see, e.g., Songyang (1993) Cell 72:767-778).<br>
[0228] In certain embodiments, computer modeling and searching<br>
technologies permit identification of compounds, or the improvement of<br>
already identified compounds, that bind ANGPTL4. Certain exemplary<br>
molecular modeling systems include, but are not limited to, the CHARMM and<br>
QUANTA programs (Polygen Corporation, Waltham, IN/1A). CHARMM<br>
performs the energy minimization and molecular dynamics functions.<br>
QUANTA performs the construction, graphic modeling and analysis of<br>
molecular structure. QUANTA allows interactive construction, modification,<br>
visualization, and analysis of the behavior of molecules with each other.<br>
J.       Nucleic acid antagonists of ANGPTL4-<br>
[0229] in certain embodiments, an isolated nucleic acid that decreases<br>
the expression of a nucleic acid encoding ANGPTL4 is provided. In certain<br>
embodiments, the nucleic acid encoding ANGPTL4 encodes mouse<br>
ANGPTL4. In certain embodiments, the nucleic encoding ANGPTL4 encodes<br>
human ANGPTL4. In certain embodiments, the isolated nucleic acid is an<br>
antisense nucleic acid. In certain such embodiments, the antisense nucleic<br>
acid is a single stranded DNA molecule that promotes the degradation of a<br>
target mRNA by an RNaseH-based mechanism. In certain embodiments, an<br>
antisense nucleic acid is an oligonucleotide of about 8-30 nucleotides in<br>
64<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
length (including all points between the end points). In certain embodiments,<br>
an antisense nucleic acid is an oligonucleotide of about 18-26 nucleotides in<br>
length.<br>
[0230] In certain embodiments, an antisense nucleic acid encompasses<br>
an RNA molecule that reduces expression of a target nucleic acid by an RNA<br>
interference (RNAi)-based mechanism. Certain exemplary RNA molecules<br>
suitable for RNAi include, but are not limited to, short interfering RNAs<br>
(siRNAs), microRNAs (mRNAs), tiny non-coding RNAs (tncRNAs), and small<br>
modulatory RNA (smRNA). For review of certain exemplary RNAi<br>
mechanisms and RNA molecules for use in RNAi, see, e.g., Novina et al.<br>
(2004) Nature 430:161-164.<br>
[0231] In certain embodiments, an siRNA that decreases expression of<br>
a nucleic acid encoding ANGPTL4 is provided. In certai n embodiments, an<br>
siRNA is an oligonucleotide of about 18-26 nucleotides in length (including all<br>
points between the endpoints). In certain embodiments, an siRNA is an<br>
oligonucleotide of about 20-24 nucleotides in length, or an oligonucleotide of<br>
about 21-23 nucleotides in length. In certain embodiments, an siRNA is<br>
double-stranded RNA. In certain embodiments, an siRMA will induce the<br>
degradation of a target mRNA molecule that is complementary to the<br>
antisense strand of the siRNA. See, e.g., Novina et al. (2004) Nature<br>
430:161-164.<br>
[0232] The activity of an antisense nucleic acid, such as an antisense<br>
DNA molecule or an siRNA, is often affected by the secondary structure of the<br>
target mRNA. See, e.g., Vickers et al. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278:7108-7118.<br>
Thus, in certain embodiments, an antisense nucleic acid is selected that is<br>
complementary to a region of a target mRNA that is avai lable for base-pairing.<br>
In certain embodiments, a suitable region of a target mRNA is identified by<br>
performing a "gene walk," e.g., by empirically testing a number of antisense<br>
oligonucleotides for their ability to hybridize to various regions along a target<br>
mRNA and/or to reduce target mRNA expression. See, e.g., Vickers et al.<br>
(2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278:7108-7118; Hill et al. (1999) Am. J. Respir. Cell<br>
Mol. Biol. 21.728-737. In certain embodiments, a suitable region of a target<br>
mRNA is identified using an mRNA secondary structure prediction program or<br>
65<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
related algorithm to identify regions of a target mRNA that do not hybridize to<br>
any other regions of the target mRNA. See, e.g., Hill et al. (1999) Am. J.<br>
Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 21:728-737. In certain embodiments, a combination of<br>
both of the above methods is used to identify a suitable region of a target<br>
mRNA. See e.g., Hill et al. (1999) Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 21:728-737.<br>
[0233] In certain embodiments, a method of reducing ANGPTL4 activity<br>
by reducing expression of a nucleic acid encoding ANGPTL4 is provided. In<br>
certain embodiments, the method comprises reducing expression of a nucleic<br>
acid encoding ANGPTL4 in a cell in vitro or in vivo. In certain embodiments,<br>
the method comprises administering an antisense nucleic acid that reduces<br>
expression of a nucleic acid encoding ANGPTL4 to a cell in vitro or in vivo. In<br>
certain embodiments, the nucleic acid encoding ANGPTL4 encodes human<br>
ANGPTL4. In certain embodiments, the nucleic acid encoding ANGPTL4<br>
encodes mouse ANGPTL4.<br>
[0234] In certain embodiments, a method of treating a disorder of lipid<br>
metabolism, such as any of those described above (Part V. G.), is provided. In<br>
certain embodiments, the method comprises administering to a patient an<br>
effective amount of an antisense nucleic acid that reduces expression of a<br>
nucleic acid encoding ANGPTL4. In certain embodiments, antisense nucleic<br>
acid is delivered to an organ that expresses a nucleic acid encoding<br>
ANGPTL4. Certain studies have shown that ANGPTL4 is induced under<br>
fasting conditions in the liver, the pituitary, and adipose tissue. Ge et al.<br>
(2004) J. Lipid Res. 45:2071-2079. Thus, in certain embodiments, antisense<br>
nucleic acid is delivered to the liver, the pituitary, or adipose tissue. Certain<br>
exemplary guidance for the in vivo administration of antisense nucleic acids<br>
and the sustained delivery of antisense nucleic acids in vivo, including<br>
sustained delivery to specific organs such as the liver, is provided, for<br>
example, in Khan et al. (2004) J. Drug Targeting 12:393-404. in certain<br>
embodiments, sustained delivery is achieved by administering antisense<br>
nucleic acid that is encapsulated or otherwise contained by a biodegradable<br>
polymer. For example, in certain embodiments, antisense nucleic acid may<br>
be contained within poly(glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres (e.g., 0.5-20 um;<br>
66<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
3000 MW). In certain embodiments, the antisense nucleic acid is conjugated<br>
to a lipophilic moiety. See Khan et al. (2004) J. Drug Targeting 12:393-404.<br>
VI.      Examples<br>
A.	Mouse care and dietary studies<br>
[0235] Mouse studies were performed according to federal guidelines.<br>
Mice were housed at 24°C on a fixed 12 hour light/12 hour dark cycle and had<br>
ad libitum access to water and rodent chow (22% calories from fat) (product<br>
no. 5001; Purina, St. Louis, MO) or high fat diet (60% calories from fat)<br>
(product no. D12492; Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ.) as indicated<br>
below. Mice that were fed HFD received that diet from the age of 4-5 weeks<br>
onward.  Mice referred to below as being in the "fasted state" were deprived of<br>
food for 16 hours.<br>
B.	In vivo overexpression of ANGPTL4 caused hyperlipidemia<br>
1.       Overexpression of mouse ANGPTL4<br>
[0236] cDNA encoding full-length mouse ANGPTL4 (SEQ ID NO:1)<br>
was inserted into the Ad E1-deleted region of the adenovirus vector pFAD,<br>
thereby placing the cDNA under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter.<br>
See Hitt et al., "Construction and propagation of human adenovirus vectors,"<br>
in Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook Vol. 1, pp. 500-512 (J.E. Celis, ed.,<br>
2nd ed. 1998). The resultant construct, Ad5-mAngptl-4T, was used to infect<br>
CHO cells. As a control, cDNA encoding {5-galactosidase was inserted into<br>
the Ad E1 -deleted region of the adenovirus vector pFAD, thereby placing the<br>
cDNA under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The resultant<br>
construct, Ad5-p-gal, was also used to infect CHO cells. Expression of either<br>
the mouse ANGPTL4 cDNA or the (3-galactosidase cDNA was confirmed by<br>
Western blot of infected CHO cell extracts.<br>
[0237] Ad5-mAngptl-4T or Ad5-(3-gal was injected at 5 x 1010 vp into<br>
C57BL/6J mice via the tail vein. Blood samples from adenovirus-infected<br>
mice were collected at various time points after infection. Triglyceride and<br>
cholesterol levels in serum were measured using the Cobas Integra 500<br>
(Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Free fatty acid (FFA) levels in serum were<br>
measured using the NEFA C kit (99475409, Wako, Richmond, VA).<br>
67<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
[0238] As shown in Figures 1A, 1B, and 1C, mice injected with Ad5-<br>
mAngpti-4T (filled squares) showed increased fasted serum levels of<br>
triglyceride, total cholesterol, and free fatty acid (FFA) relative to the control<br>
mice injected with Ad5-|3-gal (open squares). Specifically, fasted serum levels<br>
of triglyceride and FFA in Ad5-mAngptl-4T-injected mice increased within two<br>
days after injection and reached a peak after 4 days (Figures 1A and 1C). At<br>
day 4, triglyceride was increased by about 18 fold, and FFA by about 9 fold, in<br>
mice injected with Ad5-mAngptl-4T relative to control mice. Fasted serum<br>
level of total cholesterol also increased significantly in mice injected with Ad5-<br>
mAngptl-4 relative to control mice (Figure 1B). Fasted serum triglyceride and<br>
cholesterol levels three days after injection with either Ad5-mAngptl-4T or<br>
Ad5-B-gal are also shown in Figures 2 and 3.<br>
2.       Overexpression of human ANGPTL4<br>
[0239] To determine the effects of human ANGPTL4 on mice, human<br>
ANGPTL4 was overexpressed in wild-type mice. cDNA encoding full-length<br>
human ANGPTL4 (SEQ ID NO:2) was inserted into the Ad E1-deleted region<br>
of the adenovirus vector pFAD, thereby placing the cDNA under the control of<br>
the cytomegalovirus promoter. The resulting construct, Ad5-hAngptl4T, or the<br>
control construct, Ad5-($-gal, was injected at 5 x 1010 vp into the tail vein of<br>
C57BL/6J mice. Trig lyceride and cholesterol levels in serum were measured<br>
four days after injection. As shown in Figures 4 and 5, human ANGPTL4<br>
significantly raised fasted serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels relative to<br>
the control construct.   Human ANGPTL4 had no effect on glucose levels in<br>
mice in this study. (Data not shown.) These results demonstrate that human<br>
ANGPTL4 is capable of raising fasted serum lipid levels in mice similar to<br>
mouse ANGPTL4.<br>
C.       Angptl4 knockout mice had reduced serum lipid levels<br>
[0240] Angptl4 was "knocked out" in mice to determine if lack of<br>
ANGPTL4 would have the opposite effect on serum lipid levels as<br>
overexpression of ANGPTL4 (i.e., to determine if lack of ANGPTL4 would<br>
decrease serum lipid levels). To knock out Angptl4 in mice, an ES cell clone<br>
with a retroviral vector inserted into the Angptl4 locus was injected into<br>
C57BL/6-Tyrc"Brd host blastocysts. See Zambrowicz et al. (1998) Nature<br>
68<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
392:608-611. Chimeric mice were generated and bred to C57BL/6-Tyrc"Brd<br>
mice. The resulting Angptl4+/- offspring were interbred to produce Angptl4"'<br>
mice. Tail DNA was genotyped by quantitative dot blots (Bio-Rad, Hercules,<br>
CA) using the neomycin phosphotransferase gene fragment and a fragment<br>
containing exon 1 of the murine Csk gene (MMU05247) as probes to detect<br>
virus integration and a single-copy endogenous gene, respectively.<br>
[0241] Knockout mice had moderately reduced viability, as shown in<br>
Figure 29. Furthermore, some pups were found to have a distended<br>
abdomen and intestinal, lymphangiectasia before weaning.<br>
[0242] In addition, knockout mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) had lower<br>
survival rates than wild-type mice fed a HFD. See Figure 30. Some dead<br>
knockout mice were found to have distended abdomens, and some were<br>
found to have chronic inflammation and/or lipid-laden macrophages in their<br>
mesenteric lymph nodes. In addition, some mice were found to have dilated<br>
lymphatics.<br>
[0243] To assess the effect of Angptl4 deficiency on serum lipid levels<br>
in mice fed a standard ("chow") diet, serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels<br>
were examined in the fed and fasted states of knockout mice and wild-type<br>
mice. The results are shown in Figure 6 ("n" indicates the number of mice<br>
used). Serum triglyceride levels in knockout mice ("HOM") in the fasted state<br>
were 70% lower than serum triglyceride levels in wild-type mice in the fasted<br>
state (Figure 6A). Total serum cholesterol levels and free fatty acid (FFA)<br>
levels in knockout mice in the fasted state were also significantly lower than<br>
total serum cholesterol levels and free fatty acid (FFA) levels in wild-type mice<br>
in the fasted state (Figure 6B and 6C).<br>
[0244] Figure 25, panel A, shows fasted serum triglyceride, total<br>
cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL), and low density lipoprotein (LDL)<br>
levels in male wild-type, heterozygous, and knockout mice fed a standard<br>
("chow") diet. Fasted serum triglyceride levels for heterozygous male mice<br>
were 41 % lower than for wild-type male mice in that experiment. Fasted<br>
serum triglyceride levels for knockout male mice were 59% lower than for<br>
wild-type male mice in that experiment. Fasted total cholesterol levels for<br>
69<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
heterozygous and knockout male mice were 10% and 21% lower,<br>
respectively, than for wild-type male mice in that experiment.<br>
[0245] Figure 25, panel B, shows fasted serum triglyceride, total<br>
cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL), and low density iipoprotein (LDL)<br>
levels in female wild-type and knockout mice fed a standard ("chow") diet.<br>
Fasted serum triglyceride levels for knockout female mice were 27% lower<br>
than for wild-type female mice in that experiment. Fasted total cholesterol<br>
levels for knockout female mice were 33% lower than for female wild-type<br>
male mice in that experiment Fasted HDL levels for female knockout mice<br>
were 31% lower than for female wild-type mice in that experiment.<br>
[0246] The effects of Angptl4 deficiency on serum lipid levels of<br>
knockout and wild-type mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO) were also<br>
examined. Knockout mice and wild-type mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD)<br>
to induce DIO. Serum lipid levels in those mice were then examined in the<br>
fed and fasted states. As shown in Figures 6A and 6B, serum triglycerides<br>
and total cholesterol levels were significantly reduced in knockout mice in both<br>
the fed and fasted states. Additionally, FFA levels were also significantly<br>
reduced in knockout mice in the fasted state. See Figure 6C.<br>
[0247] Figure 26 shows fasted serum triglyceride, total cholesterol,<br>
H DL, and LDL levels in wild-type and knockout male mice fed a high fat diet<br>
(HFD). In that experiment, fasted serum triglyceride levels in knockout male<br>
mice fed a HFD diet were 77% lower than in wild-type mice fed a HFD. The<br>
fasted total cholesterol level in knockout male mice fed a HFD diet were 35%<br>
tower than in wild-type mice fed a HFD in that experiment.<br>
[0248] Additionally, knockout mice were protected from DIO to a<br>
significant extent. Wild-type mice fed an HFD developed marked obesity in<br>
comparison with wild-type mice on a standard diet. See Figures 7A and 7B.<br>
However, body weight gain and body fat gain were significantly decreased for<br>
the Angptl4 knockout mice fed either standard or HFD. See Figures 7A-7D.<br>
The majority of decreased body weight is attributed to a decrease in the<br>
amount of body fat and not a decrease in lean body mass.<br>
[0249] Figure 27, panel A, shows total grams of body fat in male wild-<br>
type (BWT) and knockout ("Horn") mice fed a high fat diet (HFD). The<br>
70<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
knockout male mice fed a HFD had significantly lower body fat than the wild-<br>
type male mice fed a HFD. Figure 27, panel B, shows total grams of body fat<br>
over time in female wild-type ("WT) and knockout ("Horn") mice fed a HFD.<br>
That experiment shows a trend toward lower body fat in the female knockout<br>
mice fed a HFD versus the female wild-type mice fed a HFD.<br>
[0250] Male knockout mice fed a HFD had similar food intake as male<br>
wild-type mice fed a HFD. See Figure 28, panel A. Male knockout mice fed a<br>
HFD also had similar levels of fecal fat content as male wild-type mice fed a<br>
HFD. See Figure 28, panel B.<br>
[0251] Overall, these results showed that Angptl4 deficiency lowered<br>
serum lipids and conferred protection against obesity.<br>
D.      Angptl4 knockout mice did not show decreased adipocyte<br>
LPL activity in the fasted state<br>
[0252] Endogenous LPL activity in adipose tissue (epididymal fat pad<br>
tissue) from wild-type and knockout mice in the fed and fasted states was<br>
examined. Tissue samples (0.3-1.0 g) were homogenized in ice-cold<br>
homogenization buffer (0.025 M NH3(pH 8.2), BSA1 mg/ml, 5 mM EDTA,<br>
heparin 5 lU/ml, and protease inhibitor cocktail) using a Kinematica<br>
homogenizer. Following centrifugation at 3,000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C, the<br>
supernatant was collected.<br>
[0253] LPL activity in the supernatant was measured by the amount of<br>
oleic acid released from a substrate, glycerol-tri[9,10(n)-3H]oleate, based on<br>
the assay of Bergo et al. (1996) Biochem. J. 313:893-898). 100 ul of<br>
supernatant was added to an equal volume of substrate solution (2 mM<br>
glycerol tri[9,10 (n)-3H]oleate (131 kbeq/jimol), 189 ng/ml of L-CX-<br>
phosphatidylcholine, 14 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 140 mM Tris-HCI<br>
(pH 8.0), 15% glycerol, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum) for 1<br>
hour at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by adding 3.25 ml of<br>
methanol/chloroform/hexane mixture (141:125:100, v/v/v) and 1.05 ml of 0.1<br>
M K2CO3-boric acid buffer (pH 10.5). Following vigorous vortexing and<br>
centrifugal separation at 3,000 g for 15 minutes at room temperature, the<br>
amount of 3H in 1 ml aliquots of the aqueous/methanol phase was determined<br>
using a Beckman Coulter LS6500 liquid scintillation counter<br>
71<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
[0254] In wild-type mice, endogenous LPL activity was significantly<br>
decreased in the fasted state relative to endogenous LPL activity in the fed<br>
state. See Figure 8. This result was consistent with previous observations<br>
that ANGPTL4 expression is induced in the fasted state, thereby decreasing<br>
LPL activity. See, e.g., Ge et al. (2004) J. Lipid Res. 45:2071-2079. In<br>
knockout mice, however, endogenous LPL activity was not decreased in the<br>
fasted state relative to endogenous LPL activity in the fed state. That result<br>
was consistent with the absence of ANGPTL4 in knockout mice.<br>
E.       Angptl4 knockout mice were protected from hepatic<br>
steatosis (fatty liver)<br>
[0255] HFD has been associated with hepatic steatosis (fatty liver). To<br>
determine if Angptl4 deficiency protects against HFD-induced hepatic<br>
steatosis, localized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was<br>
used to measure lipid levels in livers from wild-type and knockout mice on<br>
HFD and standard diet. Both liver fat concentration and the degree of fatty<br>
infiltration were evaluated.<br>
[0256] In vivo MRS was performed using a 7 Tesla 16 cm bore<br>
PharmaScan system (Bruker BioSpin, Billerica, MA) using a birdcage coil with<br>
38 mm inner diameter for radio-frequency transmitting and receiving. Mice<br>
were anesthetized with 1.5-2% isoflurane with their body temperature<br>
maintained by a pre-warmed water circulation system inside the magnet.<br>
Their respiratory activity was constantly monitored. The volume of interest<br>
(VOI) was selected based on a series of T1 scout images covering the whole<br>
liver and by carefully avoiding vessels and adipose tissues. Localized 1H-<br>
MRS was obtained using a PRESS sequence (TE = 28 ms, TR= 1.0 s, 196<br>
averages, water suppression: off, VOI: 1.8X1.8X1.8 mm3, or 2X2X2 mm) with<br>
respiratory synchronization. The integral of the area under the water and fat<br>
peaks was used to calculate the fat content (% fat). See Thomsen et al.<br>
(1994) Magnetic Resonance Imaging 12:487-495.<br>
[0257] Livers from wild-type mice on HFD showed significantly higher<br>
lipid levels relative to livers from wild-type mice on standard ("chow") diet<br>
See Figure 9A. However, livers from knockout ("HOM") mice on HFD did not<br>
show significantly increased lipid levels relative to livers from knockout mice<br>
72<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
on standard diet. Further, livers from knockout mice on HFD showed<br>
significantly lower lipid levels relative to livers from wild-type mice on HFD.<br>
Consistent with these results, Oil red O staining of liver sections from<br>
knockout mice on HFD revealed significantly reduced number and size of lipid<br>
droplets relative to liver sections from wild-type mice on HFD. See Figure 9B.<br>
Moreover, the number and size of lipid droplets in liver sections of knockout<br>
mice on HFD resembled those of wild-type mice on standard diet These<br>
results indicate that Angptl4-deficient mice were protected against HFD-<br>
induced hepatic steatosis.<br>
[0258] The intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) content of skeletal muscle was<br>
also measured in knockout and wild-type mice to determine if this tissue, like<br>
liver, was protected from lipid accumulation in knockout mice. For<br>
determination of the intramyocellular lipid content, in vivo MRS studies were<br>
performed on a 7 Tesla 16 cm bore PharmaScan system using a birdcage coil<br>
with 19 mm inner diameter for radio-frequency transmitting and receiving.<br>
Mice were anesthetized with 1.5-2% isoflurane, as described above, and<br>
positioned inside the coil with their hind-limbs aligned along the longitudinal<br>
axis of the magnet. The volume of interest (VOI) of 1.5X1.5X1.5 mm3 was<br>
selected in the left or right M. tibialis anterior, avoiding vascular structures and<br>
gross adipose tissue depots. Localized 1H-MRS was obtained using a<br>
PRESS sequence (TE = 16 ms, TR= 2.0 s, 292 averages, CHESS water<br>
suppression), to ensure that the peaks of IMCL and extramyocellular lipid<br>
(EMCL) were clearly distinct in the spectrum. The integral of the area under<br>
the ICML and tCr (total creation) peaks was used to calculate the ICML<br>
content (the ICML/tCr ratio). (The tCr concentrations for the M. tibialis<br>
anterior in obese ZDF rats at 8 weeks and 15 months of age were 136+/-2.2<br>
and 132+/-1.0 nmol/g dry weight, respectively. See Kuhlmann et al. (2003)<br>
Diabetes 52:138-44.)<br>
[0259] Knockout mice on HFD showed significantly lower<br>
intramyocellular lipid content than did wild-type mice on HFD. See Figure 10.<br>
Thus, Angptl4 deficiency protected important tissues, such as liver and<br>
skeletal muscle, from lipid accumulation.<br>
73<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
F.       Angptl4 knockout mice were protected from glucose<br>
intolerance<br>
[0260] Higher levels of hepatic and intramyocellular lipid content are<br>
known to be associated with insulin insensitivity. In addition, HFD is known to<br>
be associated with glucose intolerance. To determine if Angptl4 deficiency<br>
protected against those effects, serum levels of glucose and insulin in v^ild-<br>
type and knockout mice were examined.<br>
[0261] Wild-type and knockout mice were fed a HFD. After 16 hours of<br>
fasting, blood glucose was measured by Accu-Check Advantage (2138930,<br>
Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Immediately thereafter, 2 g glucose/kg body weight<br>
was administered by oral gavage in a 20% sterile glucose solution. Blood<br>
glucose was subsequently measured at several time points. See Figure 11,<br>
panel C. In that experiment, knockout mice fed a HFD were more glucose<br>
tolerant than wild-type mice fed a HFD, meaning that knockout mice receiving<br>
an oral gavage of 2 g glucose/kg body weight had lower blood glucose levels<br>
over time than wild-type mice receiving the same treatment. That result was<br>
statistically significant.<br>
[0262] Wild-type and knockout mice were fed a HFD. After 6 hours of<br>
fasting at the start of the light cycle, blood glucose was measured.<br>
Immediately thereafter, 750 mU/kg body weight of insulin (Humulin R, El i Lilly)<br>
was injected intraperitoneally using a 75 mU/ml solution of insulin. Blood<br>
glucose was subsequently measured at several time points. See Figure 11,<br>
panel D. In that experiment, knockout mice fed a HFD were more insulin<br>
sensitive than wild-type mice fed a HFD, meaning that the injection of 75<br>
mU/ml of insulin resulted in lower glucose levels over time than wild-type mice<br>
receiving the same treatment. That result was statistically significant.<br>
[0263] Fasted serum levels of glucose and insulin in wild-type mice on<br>
HFD were significantly higher than those in wild-type mice on standard d iet,<br>
indicating HFD-induced hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. See Figure 11,<br>
panels A and B. However, fasted serum levels of both glucose and insulin in<br>
knockout mice on HFD were not significantly different from levels in wild-type<br>
mice or knockout mice fed a standard diet, indicating that Angptl4 deficiency<br>
74<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
afforded protection from HFD-induced hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia.<br>
See Figure 11, panels A and B.<br>
G.      Overexpression of mouse ANGPTL4 raised serum lipid<br>
levels in knockout mice<br>
[0264] To determine if overexpression of mouse ANGPTL4 could<br>
rescue any of the phenotypes of Angptl4 knockout mice, the Ad5-mAngptl-4T<br>
construct (described above, Part VLB. 1.) was injected at 5 x 1010 vp into the<br>
tail vein of knockout mice. As a control, the Ad5-|3-gal construct (described<br>
above, Part VI.B.1.) was injected at 5 x 1010 vp into the tail vein of knockout<br>
mice. Three days after injection, the knockout mice injected with the Ad5-<br>
mAngptl-4T construct showed significantly higher levels of fasted serum<br>
triglycerides and cholesterol than did knockout mice injected with a control<br>
construct. See Figures 12 and 13. In fact, the levels of triglycerides and<br>
cholesterol in knockout mice injected with the Ad5-mAngptl-4T construct were<br>
comparable to those in wild-type mice injected with the Ad5-mAngptl-4T<br>
construct. Compare Figures 12 and 13 with Figures 2 and 3. Those results<br>
demonstrated that overexpression of mouse ANGPTL4 reversed the reduced<br>
serum iipid levels of Angptl4 knockout mice.<br>
H.       Production and purification of mouse ANGPTL4<br>
[0265] To express recombinant ANGPTL4, CHO cells were infected<br>
with 1.5 x 1011 vp of recombinant adenovirus Ad5-mAngptl-4T (described<br>
above, Part VI.B.1.). The medium was changed to serum-free medium (EX-<br>
CELL 325-PF CHO medium, 14335, JRH, Lenexa, KS) 16-24 hours later.<br>
The conditioned medium was harvested and then replaced with fresh serum-<br>
free medium every 24-36 hours for a total of 5 harvests.<br>
[0266] Conditioned medium (1 L) was loaded onto a 10-12 ml column<br>
of Nickel-Chela ting Resin (R801-01, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The column<br>
was washed with 5 column volumes of wash buffer (10 mM imidazole, 20 mM<br>
Tris pH 7.8, 500 mM NaCI). Bound ANGPTL4 was eluted with elution buffer<br>
(500 mM imidazole, 20 mM Tris pH 7.8, 500 mM NaCI) and collected in a<br>
series of 1.5 ml fractions. The presence of ANGPTL4 in the collected fractions<br>
was determined by western blot and simply blue staining. Fractions<br>
containing ANGPTL4 were pooled together, aliquoted, and frozen at -70°C.<br>

I.        Inhibition of LPL activi ty by ANGPTL4<br>
[0267] The effect of mouse ANGPTL4 on LPL activity was determined<br>
using an in vitro assay. LPL activity was measured by the amount of oleic<br>
acid released from a substrate, glycerol-tri[9,10(n)-3H]oleate, as follows<br>
(based on the method of Shimizugawa et al. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277:33742-<br>
33748).<br>
[0268] A solution of reconstituted bovine LPL (L2254, Sigma, St. Louis,<br>
MO) was incubated with an equal volu me of substrate solution (2 mM glycerol<br>
tri[9,10 (n)-3H]oleate (131 kbeq/nmol), 189 ng/ml of L-a-phosphatidylcholine,<br>
14 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 140 mM Tris-HCI (pH 8.0), 15%<br>
glycerol, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum) in the presence of 0 to<br>
400 nM mouse ANGPTL4 (produced as described above, Part VI.H.) for 1<br>
hour at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by adding 3.25 ml of<br>
methanol/chloroform/hexane mixture (141:125:100, v/v/v) and 1.05 ml of 0.1<br>
M K2C03-boric acid buffer (pH 10.5). Following vigorous vortexing and<br>
centrifugal separation at 3,000 g for 15 minutes at room temperature, the<br>
amount of 3H in 1 ml aliquots of the aqueous/methanol phase was determined<br>
using a Beckman Coulter LS6500 liquid scintillation counter. One unit of LPL<br>
activity was defined as the release of 1 nmol of 3H-labeled oleic acid per<br>
minute at 37°C from the substrate. Mo use ANGPTL4 inhibited bovine LPL<br>
with an IC50 (concentration required for 50% inhibition) of about 25 nM. See<br>
Figure 14.<br>
J.       Generation of monoclonal antibodies against ANGPTL4 in<br>
Angptl4 knockout mice<br>
[0269] To generate monoclonal antibodies against mouse ANGPTL4,<br>
Angptl4 knockout mice were primed and then boosted every two to three<br>
weeks with purified mouse ANGPTL4 p reduced as described above, Part<br>
VI.H. Complete and Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant was also used for the<br>
priming and the boosting, respectively.   After two to three boosts, serum titers<br>
were monitored by ELISA. Once suitab ly high titers were achieved,<br>
splenocytes were harvested from the immunized mice and fused with<br>
myeloma cells (P3/NSI/1-Ag4-1) using PEG1500 as a fusion agent. The<br>
resulting cell fusion products were diluted into hybridoma medium and seeded<br>
76<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
into 96-well tissue culture plates. After 1 day, HAT medium was added to the<br>
hybridoma cultures. The medium was changed every three or four days as<br>
necessary. After ten to fourteen days of selection and culture, hybridomas<br>
were screened by ELISA with mouse ANGPTL4 used as an antigen. Nine<br>
monoclonal antibodies, designated 14D12,15F2, 2G12,10E4,1A4, 5A6,<br>
14D2, and 6G11, showed specific binding to mouse ANGPTL4.<br>
[0270] Monoclonal antibodies were also raised against a peptide<br>
having the sequence of LAPTHLDNGVDKTSRGKR, corresponding to amino<br>
acid residues 151-168 of full-length mouse ANGPTL4 (SEQ ID NO:1). (The<br>
peptide is identical to amino acid residues 151-168 of SEQ ID NO:1, except<br>
that the C-terminal amino acid of the peptide is arginine, whereas the amino<br>
acid at position 168 of SEQ ID NO:1 is lysine.) The peptide was conjugated<br>
to KLH prior to injection. A monoclonal antibody against that peptide was able<br>
to specifically bind to full length mouse ANGPTL4. That monoclonal antibody<br>
was designated 4A8.<br>
K.      ELISA methods<br>
[0271] Antibodies were screened for binding to mouse ANGPTL4 using<br>
ELISA. Ninety-six well Nunc Maxi-Sorp ImmunoPlates™ (Nunc #446612,<br>
Roskilde, Denmark) were coated by adding 50 Ml per well of a 2.5 ug/ml<br>
solution of ANGPTL4 in coating buffer (BupH™ Carbonate-Bicarbonate<br>
Buffer, Pierce #28382, Rockford, IL) overnight at 4°C. Coating buffer was<br>
removed and the plate was blocked by adding 250 ul per well of blocking<br>
buffer (1 % Blocker™ BSA, Pierce #37525, in PBS) for two hours at room<br>
temperature. 50 ul of hybridoma supernatant (undiluted or diluted in blocking<br>
buffer) or isolated anti-ANGPTL4 antibody (undiluted or diluted in blocking<br>
buffer) were added to the wells and incubated for at least one hour at room<br>
temperature. Wells were washed four times with PBS/Tween 20. 100 ml of<br>
diluted (1:5,000 to 1:10,000) HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Pierce<br>
#31446) were added to the wells and incubated for one hour at 37°C. Wells<br>
were washed six times with PBS/Tween 20. Anti-ANGPTL4 antibody was<br>
detected by adding 50 ul of TIVIB (tetramethyl benzidine) solution<br>
(ImmunoPure® TMB Substrate Kit, Pierce #34021) to the wells for 5 to 10<br>
77<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
minutes. Plates were read spectrophotometrically at 450 nm using a<br>
microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).<br>
L       In vitro neutralizing activity of monoclonal antibodies<br>
[0272] Monoclonal antibodies were assayed for their ability to<br>
neutralize ANGPTL4 activity in the in vitro assay for LPL activity discussed<br>
above, Part Vl.l. Separate LPL activity assays were conducted in the<br>
presence of 25 nM mouse ANGPTL4 and about 125 nM of each of the above<br>
nine monoclonal antibodies. The results are shown in Figure 15. For each<br>
antibody, neutralizing activity is demonstrated by the antibody's ability to<br>
increase LPL activity, i.e., to "rescue," LPL from inhibition by ANGPTL4.<br>
Rescuing activity is indicated in Figure 15 by the percentage increase in LPL<br>
activity in the presence of both ANGPTL4 and anti-ANGPTL4 antibod y<br>
relative to LPL activity in the presence of ANGPTL4 alone. Five of the nine<br>
antibodies, 4A8,14D12,15F2, 2G12, and 10E4, resulted in an increase in<br>
LPL activity, indicating that those antibodies rescued LPL activity by<br>
neutralizing ANGPTL4 activity. In particular, antibodies 4A8,14D12, and<br>
15F2 rescued LPL activity by over 50%. Four of the nine antibodies, 1A4,<br>
5A6,14D2, and 6G11, appeared to further inhibit LPL, indicating that those<br>
antibodies are capable of enhancing ANGPTL4 activity.<br>
M.      Isotyping<br>
[0273] The isotypes of 14D12,15F2, 4A8,, and 6G11 were dete rmined<br>
by standard methods. 4A8 and 6G11 are of the lgG1 isotype, and 14D12 and<br>
15F2 are of the lgG2a isotype. (See the third and fourth columns of Table 2<br>
below, Part VI.P.)<br>
N.       Epitope mapping of monoclonal antibodies<br>
[0274] Monoclonal antibodies 14D12, 15F2, and 6G11 were tested for<br>
binding to the N-termina! coiled-coil domain of mouse ANGPTL4 (from amino<br>
acids 21-174 of SEQ ID NO:1) and the C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain of<br>
mouse ANGPTL4 (from amino acids 174-410 of SEQ ID NO:1) using ELISA.<br>
14D12 and 15F2 specifically bound to the N-terminal coiled-coil domain of<br>
mouse ANGPTL4. 6G11 specifically bound to the C-terminal fibrinoge n-like<br>
domain of mouse ANGPTL4.<br>

WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
O.      Epitope binning<br>
[0275] To determine if monoclonal antibodies 14D12,15F2, and 4A8<br>
bind the same epitopes, epitope binning was performed using Luminex® 100<br>
multiplex technology and the Luminex® 100™ analyzer(Luminex Corporation,<br>
Austin, TX). See Jia et al. (2004) J. Immunol. Methods 288:91-98. Epitope<br>
binning typically utilizes an antibody sandwich-type competition assay, in<br>
which a "probe" antibody is tested for binding to an antigen that is bound by a<br>
"reference" antibody. If the probe antibody binds to the same epitope as the<br>
reference antibody, it will not bind efficiently to the antigen, because that<br>
epitope is masked by the reference antibody.<br>
[0276] To perform epitope binning, differentially labeled xMAP™<br>
carboxylated microspheres (Luminex, Austin, TX) were protected from light<br>
and coated with capture antibody (rabbit monoclonal anti-mouse IgG).<br>
Coated microspheres having a given label were then allowed to selectively<br>
capture one of three reference antibodies (14D12,15F2, or 4A8), so that each<br>
reference antibody was associated with a different label. The differentially<br>
labeled microspheres were combined and added to the wells of a microwell<br>
plate. The microspheres were dispensed into the wells and incubated<br>
overnight at 4°C. Mouse ANGPTL4 was added to the wells and incubated<br>
with agitation at 25°C for 1 hour followed by washing. One of three probe<br>
antibodies (14D12,15F2, or 4A8) was added to each well and incubated at<br>
25°C for 1 hour followed by washing. Biotinylated detection antibody ( rabbit<br>
monoclonal anti-mouse IgG) was added to the wells to detect binding of<br>
ANGPTL4 by the probe antibody. Streptavidin-PE was added to the wells and<br>
incubated for 30 minutes. For each well, the Luminex® 100™ analyzer (a dual<br>
laser, flow-based, sorting and detection platform) was used to detect the<br>
particular label associated with each microsphere (and thus the identity of the<br>
reference antibody) and the magnitude of PE-derived signal associated with<br>
each microsphere. The magnitude of PE-derived signal is directly<br>
proportional to the amount of probe antibody bound to the mouse ANG PTL4.<br>
[0277] The results are shown in Figure 16. When 4A8 was used as a<br>
probe antibody (first set of three bars), it bound mouse ANGPTL4 when both<br>
14D12 and 15F2 were used as reference antibodies, as indicated by a strong<br>
79<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
fluorescence signal (black and white bars). Thus, 4A8 does not bind the<br>
same epitope as 14D12 and 15F2. When 14D12 was used as a probe<br>
antibody (second set of three bars), it bound mouse ANGPTL4 when 4.A8 was<br>
used as a reference antibody, but it demonstrated weak binding when 15F2<br>
was used as a reference antibody (compare gray and white bars). Thu s,<br>
14D12 and 15F2 likely bind to the same epitope. Similarly, when 15F2 was<br>
used as a probe antibody (last set of three bars), it bound mouse ANGPTL4<br>
when 4A8 was used as a reference antibody, but it demonstrated weak,<br>
binding when 14D12 was used as a reference antibody (compare gray and<br>
black bars), thus confirming that 14D12 and 15F2 likely bind to the sam e<br>
epitope.<br>
[0278] A second epitope binning experiment was performed using a<br>
BIACORE ®3000 system (Biacore AB, Uppsala Sweden) according to the<br>
manufacturer's instructions. The BIACORE ®3000 system allows real time<br>
biomolecular interaction analysis using surface plasmon resonance<br>
technology. Essentially, the ability of an antigen-antibody complex to inhibit<br>
the binding of free antibody is used to determine common epitope binding in a<br>
process of competitive inhibition.<br>
[0279] The experiment was performed using antibodies 14D12,15F2,<br>
90B4,16B10, 4A8, and 9C10. The antibodies were either directly<br>
immobilized on the BIACORE chip or linked to the chip by capture with chip<br>
bound anti-mouse IgG Fc. In order to determine the epitope bin for each<br>
antibody, the bound antibody was incubated with N-mANGPTL4 and either<br>
the same antibody in solution or a different antibody in solution. The system<br>
was then allowed to reach equilibrium. Based on reciprocal binding inhibition,<br>
the following epitope bins were assigned: Bin I contained 14D12 and 15F2,<br>
Bin II contained 90B4 and 16B10, Bin III contained only 4A8 and Bin IV<br>
contained 9C10. Those results are consistent with the first epitope binning<br>
experiment, discussed above.<br>
P.       In vivo administration of monoclonal antibodies with<br>
neutralizing activity recapitulated the knockout phenotype<br>
[0280] Antibodies with in vitro neutralizing activity were administered to<br>
mice to determine if such antibodies could recapitulate the phenotype of<br>
80<br><br><br>
WO 2006/074228PCT/US2006/000184<br>
Angptl4 knockout mice. To administer the antibodies in vivo, mice fed a<br>
standard diet ("chow-fed" mice) or mice with HFD-induced DIO were injected<br>
with 30 ug of a monoclonal antibody in a volume of 10 ul per gram of body<br>
weight, as indicated below in Table 2. Anti-KLH antibody was administered<br>
as a control antibody. Fasted serum levels of triglyceride, cholesterol, and<br>
FFA were measured after four days.<br>
Table 2.<br><br>
Groups (n=8mice/group)	Diet	MAb (30mg/kg)	Isotype<br>

3	Chow-Fed	4A8	lgG1<br>
4	Chow-Fed	14D12	lgG2a<br>
5	Chow-Fed	15F2	lgG2a<br>
6	Chow-Fed	6G11	lgG1<br>

11	HFD	15F2	lgG2a<br>
12	HFD	6G11	lgG1<br><br>
[0281] The results are shown in Figures 17-19. In mice fed a standard<br>
diet, a single administration of 14D12 significantly reduced fasted serum<br>
triglyceride levels by 72.7% and 67.0% (in two independent studies), fasted<br>
total cholesterol levels by 27.1% and 21.3% (in two independent studies), and<br>
fasted FFA levels by 44.3% (in a single study). Similarly, a single<br>
administration of 15F2 reduced fasted serum triglyceride levels by 67.6% and<br>
71.8% (in two independent studies), fasted total cholesterol levels by 22.8%<br>
and 28.0% (in two independent studies), and fasted FFA levels by 39.3% (in a<br>
single study). Those observations are consistent with the ability of 14D12 and<br>
15F2 to rescue LPL activity in vitro. However, a single administration of 4A8<br>
had no significant effect on fasted serum triglyceride, cholesterol, and FFA<br>
levels (see bar graphs, Figures 17-19), even though that antibody was able to<br>
81<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
rescue LPL activity in vitro. In contrast, a single adm inistration of 6G11 raised<br>
fasted serum triglyceride levels by 66.4%, which is consistent with the ability<br>
of that antibody to further inhibit LPL activity in vitro. .Administration of 6G11<br>
had no significant effect on fasted total cholesterol and FFA levels (see bar<br>
graphs, Figures 18-19).<br>
[0282] The results obtained using mice with HFD-induced DIO are<br>
shown in Figures 20-21. A single administration of 14D12 reduced fasted<br>
serum triglyceride levels by 53.2% and fasted total ch olesterol levels by<br>
27.6%. Similarly, 15F2 reduced fasted serum triglyceride levels by 56.6% and<br>
cholesterol levels by 31.0%. 4A8 had no significant effect on either fasted<br>
serum triglyceride or total cholesterol levels (see bar graphs, Figures 20-21).<br>
A single administration of 6G11 significantly raised fasted serum triglyceride<br>
levels by 60.9% but had no significant effect on fasted total cholesterol levels<br>
(see bar graph, Figure 21). FFA levels were not measured in DIO mice.<br>
[0283] The above results showed that administration of certain<br>
antibodies that neutralize ANGPTL4 activity recapitulated the decreased<br>
serum lipid levels seen in Angptl4 knockout mice. Based on those results, it is<br>
expected that administration of such antibodies would recapitulate other<br>
aspects of the Angptl4 knockout phenotype, for example, increased<br>
endogenous LPL activity in the fasted state, increased protection from hepatic<br>
steatosis and intramyocellular lipid accumulation, and increased protection<br>
from glucose tolerance.<br>
[0284] Neutralizing antibodies were also administered over the course<br>
of five weeks to assess the effects of continued admin istration. Mice with<br>
HFD-induced DIO were injected once a week with 14D12,15F2, or an<br>
isotype-matched control antibody (antiKLH) for five weeks. The dosage was<br>
30 ug of monoclonal antibody in a volume of 10 pi per gram of body weight.<br>
Fasted serum lipid levels were measured and compared with fasted serum<br>
lipid levels from mice receiving only a single administration of antibody. As<br>
shown in Figures 22-23, a single administration of 14D 12 decreased fasted<br>
serum triglycerides by 53.22% and cholesterol by 27.58%, whereas weekly<br>
administration of 14D12 over the course of five weeks decreased fasted<br>
serum trigiycerides by 59.36% and cholesterol by 44.2 i %. Similarly, a single<br>
82<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
administration of 15F2 decreased fasted serum triglycerides by 56.61% and<br>
cholesterol by 30.97%, whereas weekly administration of 15F2 over the<br>
course of five weeks decreased fasted serum triglycerides by 64.45% and<br>
cholesterol by 32.73%. In this study, weekly administration of 14D12 or 15F2<br>
over five weeks did not have a significant effect on FFA, glucose tolerance, or<br>
body weight, compared to a single administration. (Data not shown.) These<br>
results showed that continued administration of antibodies that neutralize<br>
ANGPTL4 activity maintained or further lowered fasted serum triglyceride and<br>
total cholesterol levels relative to a single administration.<br>
[0285] Fasted serum levels of ketone bodies (KB) were also measured<br>
in DIO mice injected weekly with 14D12,15F2, or a control antibody (antiKLH)<br>
for five weeks as described above. DIO mice injected with 14D12 or 15F2<br>
had significantly higher levels of ketone bodies than did DIO mice injected<br>
with control antibody. See Figure 24. It is known that ketone bodies are<br>
produced when the body breaks down lipids. Thus, increased levels of<br>
ketone bodies may be a possible mechanism by which hepatic and<br>
intramyocellular lipid levels are reduced in mice injected with neutralizing<br>
antibody.<br>
Q.      Generation in Angptl4 knockout mice of monoclonal<br>
antibodies that cross-react with human and mouse<br>
ANGPTL4<br>
[0286] Monoclonal antibodies that cross-react with both human and<br>
mouse ANGPTL4 were raised in Angptl4 knockout mice using N-mANGPTL4,<br>
which contains a portion of the amino terminal domain of mouse ANGPTL4.<br>
[0287] A polynucleotide sequence encoding amino acids 23 to 180 of<br>
mouse ANGPTL4 was cloned into expression vector pET22b(+) (Novagen).<br>
That vector encodes an N-terminal pelB leader sequence, as well as a C-<br>
terminal His tag. The resulting expression vector is called pET-N-<br>
mANGPTL4. Following translation of the protein and removal of all but 11<br>
amino acids of the pelB sequence, N-mANGPTL4 has the sequence shown in<br>
SEQ ID NO: 10. That sequence contains 11 amino acids from the pelB<br>
sequence, followed by amino acids 23 to 180 of mouse ANGPTL4 (underlined<br>
in Table 6), followed by a 2 amino acid linker and the His tag.<br>
83<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
[0288] N-mANGPTL4 is expressed and purified from E. coli as -follows.<br>
Ten ml of LB containing 50 ug/ml of chloramphenicol and 100 |jg/ml of<br>
carbenicillin is inoculated with one colony of E. coli transformed with p&gt; ET-N-<br>
mANGPTL4. The culture is incubated at 37 °C overnight. The 10 ml culture is<br>
then transferred to 500 ml of LB without antibiotics and incubated at 3"7°C<br>
until the OD600 reaches 0.6 (about 2 hours). IPTG is added to a final<br>
concentration of 1 mM and the culture is incubated with shaking at 20O rpm at<br>
30°C for 4 hours. The culture is then placed on ice for 5 minutes. The cells<br>
are pelleted by centrifuging at 8000 rpm in a JLA16.25 rotor for 15 minutes.<br>
The pellet is then resuspended in 50 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5,<br>
O.5 M NaCI, 1% Triton X-100,1x protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and 0.25<br>
ml PMSF (0.1 M in isopropanol)). The lysed cells are then centrifuged at<br>
9700 rpm in a JA25.5 rotor for 30 minutes. The supernatant is removed and<br>
further clarified by centrifuging it at 28,000 rpm in an SW28 rotor for 3O<br>
minutes. Recombinant N-mANGPTL4 can then be purified from the clarified<br>
supernatant using Probond (Ni) chromatography (Invitrogen).<br>
[0289] To purify recombinant N-mANGPTL4 from the insoluble pellet<br>
remaining after centrifuging the lysed cells, the pellet is washed with 3O ml<br>
lysis buffer and centrifuged at 9700 rpm in a JA25.5 rotor. The wash step is<br>
repeated twice, for a total of three washes. Insoluble protein from the pellet is<br>
then dissolved in 10 ml of denaturing buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 6 M<br>
Guanadine HCI). The solution is then centrifuged at 28,000 rpm in a JA25.5<br>
rotor for 30 minutes. The supernatant is then loaded onto a 5 ml Probond<br>
resin column. The column is washed with 50 ml of washing buffer (50 mM<br>
Tris, pH 8.0,1 M NaCI, 8 M urea, 15 mM imidazole). Recombinant protein is<br>
refolded in the column with a 50 ml gradient going from washing buffer to<br>
renaturing buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0,1 M NaCI, 0.5% Tween 20). The<br>
recombinant protein is then eluted with elution buffer (renaturing buffer A/vith<br>
250 mM imidazole). The fractions containing recombinant protein are<br>
collected and dialyzed against storage buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0,100 mM<br>
NaCI, 0.2% Tween 20). The purified N-mANGPTL4 is aliquoted and stored at<br>
-70 °C.<br>
84<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
[0290] The mice were primed with 40 ug of N-mANGPTL4 in Complete<br>
Freund's Adjuvant intraperitoneally. The mice were boosted after two weeks<br>
with 30 ug of N-mANGPTL4 in Incomplete Freud's Adjuvant (IFA)<br>
intraperitoneally, and then boosted again after another two weeks with 20 ug<br>
N-mANGPTL4 in IFA intraperitoneally. Alternatively, chitosan based<br>
adjuvants can be used. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,912,000; 5,965,144;<br>
and 5,980,912. One week after the second boost, serum titers were<br>
measured by ELISA, as described above in Example K, except the wells were<br>
coated with 50 ul of 0.25 ug/ml mANGPTL4. Two weeks after the second<br>
boost, the mice were boosted with 10 ug purified mouse ANGPTL4 produced<br>
as described above, Part VI.H., in IFA intraperitoneally. One week after the<br>
third boost, serum titers were again measured by ELISA as described above<br>
in this paragraph. About two and a half weeks after the third boost, the mice<br>
were boosted with 10 ug N-mANGPTL4 intravenously.<br>
[0291] Splenocytes were harvested three days later from the<br>
immunized mice and fused with myeloma cells (NSI) using PEG1500 as a<br>
fusion agent. The resulting cell fusion products were diluted into hybridoma<br>
medium and seeded into 96-well tissue culture plates. After 1 day, HAT<br>
medium was added to the hybridoma cultures. The medium was changed<br>
every three or four days as necessary.<br>
[0292] After ten to fourteen days of selection and culture, hybridomas<br>
were screened by ELISA to identify those that express antibody that cross-<br>
reacts with human and mouse ANGPTL4. ELISAs were performed as<br>
discussed above in Example K, except the plates were coated with 50 ul of a<br>
0.25 ug/ml solution of protein and each antibody was separately tested<br>
against both mouse ANGPTL4 and human ANGPTL4. Mouse ANGPTL4 and<br>
human ANGPTL4 were purified from the conditioned medium of CHO cells<br>
infected with Ad5-mAngptl4T and Ad5-mAngptl4T, respectively, as discussed<br>
above in Example H. Fifteen monoclonal antibodies that cross-reacted with<br>
mouse and human ANGPTL4 were selected. The isotypes of the selected<br>
antibodies were determined, and are shown in Table 3.<br>

R.        In vivo activity of monoclonal antibodies against A.NGPTL4<br>
[0293] Antibodies 14D12,19C9,18G3,18A2, 9C10, and 90B4, as well<br>
as anti-KLH as a control, were tested for certain in vivo activities in mice as<br>
follows. Thirty mg/kg body weight of antibody was injected into a C57 albino<br>
wild type mouse intraperitoneally. Each antibody was tested in five mice.<br>
After four days, fasted serum triglyceride and total cholesterol levels were<br>
measured. The fasted serum triglyceride levels of the antibody-injected mice<br>
in that experiment are shown in Figure 31. Antibodies 14D12 and 9OB4<br>
reduced fasted serum triglycerides to a statistically significant extent, by<br>
73.6% and 54.9%, respectively. Fasted total cholesterol levels of the<br>
antibody-injected mice in that experiment are shown in Figure 32. Antibodies<br>
14D12 and 90B4 reduced fasted total cholesterol to a statistically sig nificant<br>
extent, by 25.2% and 22.2%, respectively.<br>

S.       Relative binding affinity of monoclonal antibodies against<br>
ANGPTL4<br>
[0294] The binding affinity of antibodies 90B4,15F2, and 14D12 were<br>
determined for each of N-mANGPTL4 and N-hANGPTL4 by EL ISA. N-<br>
hANGPTL4 was expressed and purified from bacteria as described above for<br>
N-mANGPTL4 in Example Q. A polynucleotide sequence encoding amino<br>
acids 24 to 175 of human ANGPTL4 was cloned into expression vector<br>
pET22b(+), which encodes an N-terminal pelB leader sequence and a C-<br>
terminal His tag. Following translation of the protein and removal of all but 11<br>
amino acids of the pelB sequence, N-hANGPTL4 has the sequence shown in<br>
SEQ ID NO: 11. That sequence contains 11 amino acids from the pelB<br>
sequence, followed by amino acids 24 to 175 of human ANGPTL4 (underlined<br>
in Table 6), followed by a 2 amino acid linker and the His tag. ELISAs were<br>
performed as discussed above in Example K, except the plates were coated<br>
with 50 ml of 0.25 ug/ml of protein (N-mANGPTL4 or N-hANGPTL4) per well.<br>
Binding was measured at 0 mg/ml, 0.08 mg/ml, 0.4 mg/ml, 2 mg/m I, and 10<br>
mg/ml antibody. The results of that experiment are shown in Figure 33. 90B4<br>
had greater affinity for both N-mANGPTL4 (panel A) and N-hANGPTL4 (panel<br>
B) than either 15F2 or 14D12. 15F2 had greater affinity for N-mANGPTL4<br>
than 14D12, but comparable affinity as 14D12 for N-hANGPTL4.<br>
T.        Dose response of 14D12 in lowering serum triglycerides<br>
[0295] Five C57 albino wild-type mice fed a HFD were injected<br>
subcutaneously with the specific concentrations discussed below/ of either<br>
14D12 antibody or anti-KLH antibody. After 4 days and 7 days, the percent<br>
reduction in total triglycerides relative to time 0 was determined.  The antibody<br>
concentrations tested in that experiment were 0.3 mg/kg body weight, 1 mg/kg<br>
body weight, 3 mg/kg body weight, 10 mg/kg body weight, 30 mg/kg body<br>
weight, and 90 mg/kg body weight. The results of that experiment are shown<br>
in Figure 34. After 4 days, administration of 10 mg/kg body weight, 30 mg/kg<br>
body weight, and 90 mg/kg body weight resulted in a statistically significant<br>
reduction in serum triglycerides. See Figure 34, panel A. That effect<br>
continued, and remained statistically significant after 7 days. See Figure 34,<br>
panel B.<br>

U.       Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of monoclonal<br>
antibodies against ANGPTL4<br>
[0296] to determine the pharmacodynamics of 14D12, C57 albino mice<br>
were injected with 30 pg/g body weight of 14D12 and their fasted serum<br>
triglyceride and total cholesterol levels were measured after certain time<br>
intervals set forth in Table 4, below. Mice were fed a regular ("chow") diet. A<br>
total of eight groups of three mice each were used in the experiment. One<br>
group of three mice was not injected with antibody and was used as baseline.<br>
The remaining seven groups of mice received 14D12 injections. The mice<br>
were injected, fasted, and bled according to the following schedule:<br>
Table 4<br><br>
Group	Dav injected	Dav fasted	Dav bled	Timepoint (dav)<br><br>
1	3	3	4	1<br>
2	2	3	4	2<br>

4	4	7	8	4<br>
5	3	7	8	5<br>
6	2	7	8	6<br>
7	1	7	8	7<br>
[0297] To determine the pharmacokinetics of 14D12, four C57 albino<br>
mice were injected with 30 mg/kg body weight of 14D12 at 8 a.m. on day 1.<br>
Four additional C57 albino mice were injected with 30 rng/kg anti-KLH at 8<br>
a.m. on day 1 as a control. Each mouse was then bled after 1 hour, 5 hours,<br>
1 0 hours, 1 day, 2 days, 4 days, 7 days, 10 days, and 14 days, and the<br>
concentration of antibody in the blood determined as follows. An ELISA was<br>
performed as discussed above in Example K, except each well was coated<br>
with 50 ul of 0.5 ug/ml of N-mANGPTL4. The following dilutions of mouse<br>
serum were tested by ELISA: 1:103,1:104,1:10s, 1:106. Standards<br>
containing 0.08 ug/ml, 0.4 ug/ml, 2 ug/ml, and 10 ug/ml of 14D12 were tested<br>
in parallel with the mouse serum dilutions.<br>
[0298] The results of those experiments are shown in Figure 35. Panel<br>
A shows a plot of 14D12 concentration and fasted serum triglyceride levels<br>
88<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
over time. 14D12 concentration peaks at about 24 hours after injection, while<br>
fasted serum triglyceride concentration reaches a minimum about 96 hours<br>
after injection, and remains lowered until at least 336 hours after injection,<br>
when the experiment ended. Panel B shows a plot of 14D12 concentration<br>
and fasted total cholesterol levels over time. As stated above, 14D12<br>
concentration peaks at about 24 hours after injection. Fasted total cholesterol<br>
reaches a minimum about 168 hours after injection, and remains lowered until<br>
at least 336 hours after injection, when the experiment ended.<br>
V.       Administration of monoclonal antibodies against ANGPTL4<br>
in mice that overexpress human ANGPTL4<br>
[0299] To determine whether certain monoclonal antibodies can reduce<br>
fasted serum triglycerides and total cholesterol in mice that overexpress<br>
human ANGPTL4, Ad5-hAngptl4T (described in Example B.2., above) was<br>
injected at 1 x 109 lU/mouse into the tail veins of C57 albino mice. A total of<br>
four groups of five mice each were injected with Ad5-hAngptl4T. Each of the<br>
four groups were also injected with 30 mg/kg of an antibody at the same time<br>
as virus infection. The antibodies injected were anti-KLH, 14D12,15F2, and<br>
9OB4. After four days, fasted serum triglyceride and total cholesterol levels<br>
were measured in the mice.<br>
[0300] Figure 36 shows fed serum triglyceride levels in the mice in that<br>
experiment. Each of the five mice in each group is represented by a different<br>
symbol in Figure 36. Mice injected with anti-KLH had serum triglyceride levels<br>
of between about 750 mg/dl and about 1900 mg/dl.  Three of the mice<br>
injected with 14D12 had serum triglyceride levels below those of mice injected<br>
with anti-KLH. The remaining mice injected with 14D12 had elevated<br>
triglyceride levels relative to mice injected with anti-KLH. Three of the mice<br>
injected with 15F2 had serum triglyceride levels well below those of mice<br>
injected with anti-KLH, while the remaining two mice injected with 15F2 had<br>
serum triglyceride levels that were similar to mice injected with anti-KLH.<br>
Finally, three of the mice injected with 90B4 had serum triglyceride levels<br>
below those of mice injected with anti-KLH, while two of the mice injected with<br>
90 B4 had elevated serum triglyceride levels relative to mice injected with anti-<br>
KLH.<br>
89<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
[0301] The results show that about half of the mice injected with<br>
antibodies against ANGPTL4 had reduced serum triglyceride levels relative to<br>
the mice injected with anti-KLH antibody. Some mice injected with antibodies<br>
against ANGPTL4 had elevated serum triglyceride levels, which may be due<br>
to the variation of Ad-hANGPTL4T infection and possible expression in the<br>
liver.<br>
[0302] Figure 37 shows the fasted total cholesterol levels in the mice in<br>
that experiment Each of the five mice in each group is represented by the<br>
same symbol as in Figure 36. All five of the mice injected with anti-KLH had<br>
total cholesterol levels of between about 180 mg/dl and about 240 mg/dl.<br>
Three of the mice injected with 14D12 had total cholesterol levels below those<br>
of mice injected with anti-KLH. The remaining two mice injected with 14D12<br>
had total cholesterol levels above those of mice injected with anti-KLH. Four<br>
of the mice injected with 15F2 had total cholesterol levels below those of mice<br>
injected with anti-KLH, while one mouse injected with 15F2 had a total<br>
cholesterol level comparable to mice injected with anti-KLH. Finally, two of<br>
the mice injected with 90B4 had total cholesterol levels lower than those of<br>
mice injected with anti-KLH, while one of the mice injected with 90B4 had a<br>
comparable cholesterol level to mice injected with anti-KLH, and one of the<br>
mice injected with 90B4 had a total cholesterol level greater than mice<br>
injected with anti-KLH.<br>
[0303] Overall, about half of the mice infected with Ad5-hANGPTL4T<br>
and injected with antibodies against ANGPTL4 had total cholesterol levels<br>
lower than mice infected with Ad5-hANGPTL4T and injected with anti-KLH.<br>
Again, the mice infected with Ad5-hANGPTL4T and injected with antibodies<br>
against ANGPTL4 that had elevated cholesterol levels may be the result of<br>
variation of Ad5-ANGPTL4T infection and possible expression in the liver.<br>
[0304] These results demonstrate that injection with antibodies 14D12,<br>
15F2, and 90B4 may reduce serum triglycerides and total cholesterol in mice<br>
overexpressing human ANGPTL4.<br>

W.      Administration of monoclonal antibodies against ANGPTL4<br>
in LDLr knockout mice<br>
[O305] LDLr knockout mice have been found to have elevated serum<br>
cholesterol levels, especially when fed a high fat diet See, e.g., Ishibashi et<br>
al. (1993) J. Clin. Invest. 92 :883-93. To determine if certain monoclonal<br>
antibodies against ANGPTL4 could reduce serum cholesterol and triglyceride<br>
levels in LDLr knockout mice, the follwing experiment was performed. Three<br>
groups of fifteen 12- to 13-week old LDLr knockout mice (Jackson<br>
Laboratories, strain B6.129S7-Lo7/mfHB7J) were injected with vehicle alone, 30<br>
mg/kg anti-KLH, or 30 mg/kg 14D12 intraperitoneally. Each mouse received<br>
one injection per week for fifteen weeks. A fourth group of fifteen mice was<br>
left untreated. All mice were fed a Clinton diet (Research Diets, product no.<br>
D12107 beginning on the day of the first injection.<br>
[0306] Fasted serum triglyceride levels were determined in each mouse<br>
at the end of 15 weeks. See Figure 38. Serum triglyceride levels in mice<br>
injected with 14D12 were significantly lower than serum triglyceride levels in<br>
mice injected with anti-KLH, vehicle, or mice that were untreated.<br>
[0307] Fasted total cholesterol levels were determined in each mouse<br>
at the end of 15 weeks. See Figure 39. Total cholesterol levels in mice<br>
injected with 14D12 were significantly lower than total cholesterol levels in<br>
mice injected with anti-KLH, vehicle, or mice that were untreated.<br>
[0308] In that experiment, LDLr knockout mice injected with 14D12<br>
each week for 14 weeks showed no difference in glucose tolerance or insulin<br>
levels relative to LDLr knockout mice injected with anti-KLH or vehicle each<br>
week for 14 weeks. Furthermore, in that experiment, there was no difference<br>
in body fat content, body fat percentage, or lean body mass between mice<br>
injected with 14D12 each week for 8 weeks and mice injected with anti-KLH<br>
or vehicle each week for 8 weeks. Finally, the percentage of plaque in the<br>
aortic tree of mice injected with 14D12 each week for 15 weeks was not<br>
statistically significantly different from the percentage of plaque in the aortic<br>
tree of mice injected with either anti-KLH or vehicle each week for 15 weeks in<br>
that experiment. (Data not shown.)<br>
91<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
[0309]  Those results showed that 14D12 can lower serum triglyceride<br>
and total cholesterol levels in LDLr knockout mice. In that experiment,<br>
monoclonal antibody 14D12, however, did not cause increased glucose<br>
tolerance or changes in insulin levels in those mice. In that experiment,<br>
monoclonal antibody 14D12 did not alter body composition in those mice or<br>
reduce the percentage of plaque in the aortic tree. In addition, at the end of<br>
the experiment, one of thirteen LDLr knockout mice that received 15 weekly<br>
injections of 14D12 had a distended abdomen, while two of thirteen LDLr<br>
knockout mice that received 15 weekly injections of 14D12 had typical lesions<br>
in the mesenteric lymph nodes and lymphatics.  Finally, serum inflammatory<br>
cytokines were not elevated in LDLr knockout mice who received 15 weekly<br>
injections of 14D12 relative to mice who received anti-KLH or vehicle. (Data<br>
not shown.)<br>
[0310] Next, the effect of a single injection of 14D12 in LDLr knockout<br>
mice was determined. Each mouse received a single intraperitoneal injection<br>
of 30 mg/kg body weight of either anti-KLH or 14D12. Six mice were injected<br>
with 14D12 and five mice were injected with anti-KLH. After four days, fasted<br>
serum triglyceride and total cholesterol levels in the mice were determined.<br>
[0311] Fasted serum triglyceride levels are shown in Figure 42. A<br>
single injection of 14D12 resulted in a 68.8% reduction in serum triglycerides<br>
after 4 days. That result was statistically significant. Fasted total cholesterol<br>
levels are shown in Figure 43. 14D12 did not reduce cholesterol levels to a<br>
statistically significant extent in that experiment.<br>
[0312] Those results demonstrated that a single injection of the<br>
monoclonal antibody against ANGPTL4 tested in that experiment resulted in a<br>
significant reduction in serum triglycerides in LDLr knockout mice.<br>
X.       Administration of monoclonal antibodies against ANGPTL4<br>
in ApoE knockout mice<br>
[0313] ApoE knockout mice have been found to develop spontaneous<br>
hypercholesterolemia. See, e.g., Piedrahita et al. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad.<br>
Sci. USA 89(10):4471-5; and Zhang et al. (1992) Science 258(5081 ):468-71.<br>
To determine if certain monoclonal antibodies against ANGPTL4 can reduce<br>
serum cholesterol and trigyleride levels in ApoE knockout mice, the following<br>
92<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
experiment was performed. Three groups of fifteen 14-week old ApoE<br>
knockout mice (Taconic Aminal Models, strain B6.129P2-&gt;Apoe'm7UncN11)<br>
were injected with vehicle alone, 30 mg/kg anti-KLH, or 30 mg/kg 14D12<br>
intraperitoneally. Each mouse received one injection per week for fifteen<br>
weeks. A fourth group of fifteen mice was left untreated. All mice were fed a<br>
Western diet (Research Diets, product no. D12079B) beginning on the day of<br>
the first injection.<br>
[0314] Fasted serum triglyceride levels were determined in each mouse<br>
at the end of 15 weeks. See Figure 40. Serum triglyceride levels in mice<br>
injected with 14D12 were significantly lower than serum triglyceride levels in<br>
mice injected with anti-KLH or mice that were untreated. However, serum<br>
triglyceride levels in mice injected with 14D12 were not significantly lower than<br>
serum triglyceride levels in mice treated only with vehicle in that experiment.<br>
[0315] Fasted total cholesterol levels were determined in each mouse<br>
at the end of 15 weeks. See Figure 41. Total cholesterol levels in mice<br>
injected with 14D12 were not significantly lower than total cholesterol levels in<br>
mice injected with anti-KLH or vehicle in that experiment, but were<br>
significantly lower than total cholesterol levels in mice left untreated.<br>
[0316] In that experiment, there was no difference in body fat content,<br>
body fat percentage, or lean body mass between mice injected with 14D12<br>
each week for 15 weeks and mice injected with anti-KLH or vehicle each<br>
week for 15 weeks. Furthermore, the percentage of plaque in the aortic tree<br>
of mice injected with 14D12 each week for 15 weeks not statistically<br>
significantly different from the percentage of plaque in the aortic tree of mice<br>
injected with either anti-KLH or vehicle each week for 15 weeks in that<br>
experiment. (Data not shown.)<br>
[0317] Those results showed that 14D12 can lower serum triglyceride<br>
levels in ApoE knockout mice. In that experiment, however, monoclonal<br>
antibody 14D12 did not reduce total cholesterol levels in ApoE knockout mice.<br>
In that experiment, monoclonal antibody 14D12 also did not alter body<br>
composition in those mice or reduce the percentage of plaque in the aortic<br>
tree. In addition, at the end of the experiment, three out of fifteen ApoE<br>
knockout mice that received 15 weekly injections of 14D12 had a distended<br>
93<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
abdomen, while thirteen out of fifteen of the ApoE knockout mice that received<br>
15 weekly injections of 14D12 had typical lesions in the mesenteric lymph<br>
nodes and lymphatics. Finally, six out of fifteen of the ApoE knockout mice<br>
that received 15 weekly injections of 14D12 had chylous ascites. Serum<br>
inflammatory cytokines were not elevated in ApoE knockout mice who<br>
received 15 weekly injections of 1 4D12 relative to mice who received anti-<br>
KLH or vehicle. (Data not shown.)<br>
[0318] Next, the effect of a single injection of 14D12 in ApoE knockout<br>
mice was determined. Each mouse received a single intraperitoneal injection<br>
of 30 mg/kg body weight of either anti-KLH or 14D12. Six mice were injected<br>
with 14D12 and seven mice were injected with anti-KLH. After four days,<br>
fasted serum triglyceride and tota I cholesterol levels in the mice were<br>
determined.<br>
[0319] Fasted serum triglyceride levels are shown in Figure 44. A<br>
single injection of 14D12 resulted in a 55.4% reduction in serum triglycerides<br>
after 4 days. That result was statistically significant. Fasted total cholesterol<br>
levels are shown in Figure 45. A single injection of 14D12 resulted in a 39.5%<br>
reduction in serum triglycerides after 4 days. That result was also statistically<br>
significant.<br>
[0320] Those results demonstrated that a single injection of monoclonal<br>
antibody 14D12 can results in a significant reduction in serum triglycerides<br>
and total cholesterol levels in ApoE knockout mice.<br>
Y.       Administration of a monoclonal antibody against ANGPTL4<br>
to db/db mice<br>
[0321] Db/db mice have been found to display obesity and diebetic<br>
phenotypes. See, e.g., Chen et al. (1996) Cell 84:491-495; and Chua Jr et<br>
al. (1996) Science 271 :994-996. To determine the effect of certain<br>
monoclonal antibodies against ANGPTL4 on obesity and diabetes<br>
parameters, the following experiment was performed.<br>
[0322] Each mouse in a first group of ten db/db mice was injected with<br>
30 mg/kg body weight of anti-KLH subcutaneously. Each mouse in a second<br>
group of ten db/db mice was injected with 30 mg/kg body weight of 14D12<br>
subcutaneously. Fasted serum triglyceride levels were measured prior to<br>
94<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
injection, and then measured one week after injection. The mice then<br>
received weekly injections, and the fasted serum triglyceride leve Is were<br>
measured after 8 weekly injections. Mice were fed a chow diet.<br>
[0323] The results are shown in Figure 46. Panel A shows fasted<br>
serum triglyceride levels one week after a single injection with anti-KLH or<br>
14D12. In that experiment, injection of 14D12 reduced serum trig lycerides to<br>
a statistically significant extent. Panel B shows fasted serum triglycerides in<br>
mice after 8 weekly injections with 14D12 or anti-KLH. In that experiment,<br>
14D12 reduced serurn triglycerides by 56%, which was statistically significant.<br>
[0324] Serum glucose and insulin levels were not changed by 14D12<br>
injection in that experiment. Body weights of the mice were also not changed<br>
by 14D12 injection in that experiment.<br>
Z.       Sequencing of certain monoclonal antibodies against<br>
ANGPTL4<br>
[0325] The heavy chain and light chain variable regions of 14D12,<br>
15F2, and 90B4 were cloned and sequenced using a modified version of the<br>
method described in Gilliland et al (1996) Tissue Antigens 47:1-2O. The<br>
method was modified to use RACE and PCR primers suitable for the mouse<br>
genetic background.  An alignment of the heavy chain variable regions,<br>
including a consensus sequence (SEQ ID NO: 15), is shown in Figure 47. In<br>
addition, the percent homology of the heavy chain variable regions between<br>
each of the antibodies is shown in that Figure. The heavy chain variable<br>
regions of 14D12 (SEQ ID NO: 12) and 15F2 (SEQ ID NO: 13) are 99%<br>
identical, while the heavy chain variable region of 90B4 (SEQ ID MO: 14) is<br>
only 40% identical to the heavy chain variable regions of 14D12 and 15F2.<br>
[0326] An align ment of the light chain variable regions, including a<br>
consensus sequence (SEQ ID NO: 19), is shown in Figure 48. The percent<br>
homology of the light chain variable regions is shown as well. The light chain<br>
variable regions of 15F2 (SEQ ID NO: 17) and 90B4 (SEQ ID NO: 18) are<br>
99% identical, while the light chain variable region of 14D12 (SEQ ID NO: 16)<br>
is only 52% and 51% identical to the light chain variable regions of 15F2 and<br>
90B4, respectively.<br>

AA.    Epitope mapping of certain monoclonal antibodies against<br>
ANGPTL4<br>
[0327] To identify the epitopesfor monoclonal antibodies 15F2,14D12,<br>
and 90B4, the following experiment was performed. Various fragments of<br>
mouse ANGPTL4 were translated in vitro. The location of the fragments are<br>
shown in Table 5 and the sequence of the fragments are shown in Table 6<br>
(SEQ ID NOs: 40 to 48). The starting amino acid and ending amino acid in<br>
Table 5 refer to the amino acid sequence of mANGPTL4 shown in SEQ ID<br>
NO: 50.<br>
Table 5<br><br>

gs4-5	F124	L151<br>
[0328] Each fragment was expressed from a construct that was<br>
generated using PCR. Each PCR-derived construct contained a T7 promoter,<br>
a sequence encoding a His6 tag, a sequence encoding a small-ubiquitin-like<br>
modifier (SUMO), and the sequence encoding the ANGPTL4 fragment. The<br>
PCR constructs were translated in vitro using RTS E. coli Linear Template<br>
Generation Set (Roche Diagnostics) and RTS 100 £ coli HY kit (Roche<br>
Diagnostics), both as directed by the manufacturer. The ANSPTL4 portion of<br>
a fragment is referred to as °gs1," "gs2," etc., as shown in Table 5. The in<br>
vitro translated protein fragments, including the His tag and SUMO sequence,<br>
are referred to as "His-SUMO-gs1," "His-SUMO-gs2," etc., as shown in Figure<br>
49.<br>
96<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
[0329] The in vitro translated protein fragments were separated on four<br>
SDS-PAGE gels, along with N-mANGPTL4, and transferred to four<br>
nitrocellulose blots. The blots were then blocked for 1 to 2 hours with TBS<br>
containing 5% nonfat dried milk (TBS-NFDM). After blocking, the blots were<br>
rinsed with TBS containing 0.5% Tween-20 (TBS-Tween) four times for five<br>
minutes each rinse. The blots were then incubated in TBS-NFDM containing<br>
tester antibody (14D12,15F2, 90B4, or anti-His) overnight at 4°C. The blots<br>
were rinsed with TBS-Tween four times for five minutes each rinse and then<br>
incubated in TBS-NFDM containing a 1:6000 dilution of HRP-coupled goat<br>
anti-mouse antibody (Southern Biotechnology Associates) for 1 hour. The<br>
blots were rinsed with TBS-Tween four times for five minutes each rinse and<br>
then developed using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate<br>
(Pierce Biotechnology) as directed by the manufacturer. Alternatively, blots<br>
can be developed using the Western Breeze™ Immunodetection Kit<br>
(Invitrogen).<br>
[0330] The results of that experiment are shown in Figure 49. Antibody<br>
14D12 bound only to N-mANGPTL4 in that experiment. 14D12 did not<br>
appear to bind to any of the other fragments in that experiment. That result<br>
may be due to the fact that 14D12 is a weaker binder than 15F2 and 90B4.<br>
See, e.g., Example S and Figure 33. Antibody 15F2 bound His-SUMO-gs1.<br>
That result suggests that 15F2 binds at least to a region between Q24 and<br>
P98 of mANGPTL4 (SEQ ID NO: 40). Antibody 90B4 bound to His-SUMO-<br>
gs2 and His-SUMO-gs4. That result suggests that the 90B4 epitope contains<br>
portions of mANGPTL4 between L49 and P98 (SEQ ID NO: 41) and between<br>
E99 and L151 (SEQ ID NO: 43).<br>
BB.    siRNA<br>
[0331] Oligonucleotides for use as siRNAs were identified using the<br>
SWiARTselection™ process (Dharmacon, Inc., Lafayette, CO). This process<br>
uses a multi-component algorithm for identifying siRNAs with a high<br>
probability of potent and specific degradation of the target mRNA. Four<br>
double stranded RNA oligonucleotides for use as siRNAs were identified<br>
using this process. The sequences of the four oligonucleotides are set forth in<br>
SEQ ID NOs:5-8.<br>
97<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
[0332] The oligonucleotides are used to induce the degradation, and<br>
thus the expression, of mRNA encoding human ANGPTL4. The four<br>
oligonucleotides are combined within a single reagent, the SMARTpoo^<br>
reagent (Dharmacon, Inc., Lafayette, CO), which is resuspended in a buffered<br>
RNase-free solution to a final concentration of about 20uM. The<br>
oligonucleotides are transfected into cultured cells using standard transfection<br>
methods at a concentration of about 1 -200 nM siRNA.<br>
[0333] A cell-based assay is used to confirm that the oligonucleotides<br>
induce the degradation of mRNA encoding human ANGPTL4 in vitro. Hela<br>
cells transfected with the oligonucleotides are seeded onto 6-well plates and<br>
allowed to grow overnight in a 37°C incubator with 5% CO2 supplement.<br>
Seeding density is about 100,000 cells/well. The oligonucleotides are<br>
transfected into cells the next day at a final concentration of about 10-100 nM<br>
in 1 ml growth medium. Cells are harvested 48 hours after transfection. Total<br>
RNA is isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy kit. Fhe amount of Angptl4 mRNA<br>
is analyzed by Northern blot analysis.<br>
[0334] While the above examples describe, inter alia, certain<br>
neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against mouse ANGPTL4 and the in vivo<br>
effects of those antibodies in mice, one skilled in the art would readily<br>
recognize that neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against human ANGPTL4<br>
may be generated, and such antibodies would have the same or similar in<br>
vivo effects in humans. That conclusion is based, in part, on the observation<br>
that human and mouse ANGPTL4 are evolutionary conserved proteins that<br>
share structural and functional features. See, e.g., Ge et al. (2004) J. Biol.<br>
Chem. 279:2038-2045. For example, human and mouse ANGPTL4 share<br>
about 77% amino acid sequence identity. Human and mouse ANGPTL4 also<br>
share common secondary structural elements, e.g., an N-terminal coiled-coil<br>
domain and a C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain.   Furthermore, human<br>
ANGPTL4 has a similar function as mouse ANGPTL4, as demonstrated by<br>
the ability of human ANGPTL4 to raise serum lipid levels when overexpressed<br>
in mice. See Part VI.B.2.<br>
98<br><br>
WO 2006/074228	PCT/US2006/000184<br>
[0335] It is also generally recognized in the art that mice are routinely<br>
used as models for the treatment of various conditions and diseases using<br>
neutralizing antibodies. For example, neutralizing antibodies have been used<br>
to treat prion disease, diabetes, and inflammation in mice. See, e.g., White et<br>
al. (2003) Nature 422:80-83; Cailleau et al. (1997) Diabetes 46:937-940; and<br>
Lochner et al. (2002) J. Immunol. Methods 259:149-157. In the latter study,<br>
monoclonal antibodies that neutralize mouse IL-18 were raised in IL-18<br>
deficient mice. Those mouse monoclonal antibodies were capable of<br>
suppressing lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response in wild-type<br>
mice. Thus, one skilled in the art would conclude that the foregoing examples<br>
support the use of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against human<br>
ANGPTL4 in the treatment of human medical conditions.<br>
