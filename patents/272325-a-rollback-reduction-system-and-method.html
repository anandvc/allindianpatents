ANTI-ROLLBACK CONTROL FOR HYBRID AND CONVENTIONAL POWERTRAIN VEHICLES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to vehicle control systems, and more particularly to a control system for reduction of vehicle rollback.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
When a vehicle is stopped on an incline, vehicle rollback may occur between release of a brake pedal and depression of an accelerator pedal. To conserve fuel and energy, a hybrid vehicle turns off an engine by cutting fuel delivery while a vehicle is stopped. The driver resumes vehicle travel by releasing the brake pedal and depressing the accelerator pedal. Typically, the engine is not restarted until the end of a brake pedal release stroke when the brake has been fully released. When the hybrid vehicle is stopped on an incline, a certain amount of brake pressure is necessary to hold the vehicle on the incline. During the brake pedal release stroke, prior to restarting of the engine, the brake pressure may become insufficient to hold the vehicle on the incline and vehicle rollback may occur.<br>
Similarly, vehicle rollback may occur in a conventional powertrain vehicle which utilizes a neutral-idle mode. A transmission in such a vehicle is moved to neutral while the vehicle is stopped to conserve fuel and reduce idle vibration. When the vehicle is stopped on an incline, the vehicle is held by a brake system. Typically, the vehicle exits the neutral-idle mode and engages a vehicle clutch at the end of the brake pedal release stroke. Vehicle rollback may occur prior<br>
 <br>
2<br>
to the vehicle exiting neutral idle mode when the brake pressure is no longer sufficient to hold the vehicle on the incline.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a rollback reduction system for a vehicle having an engine. The rollback reduction system includes a grade sensor that generates a grade signal and a brake sensor that generates a brake signal. A control module calculates a brake release rate based on the brake signal and restarts the engine based on the grade signal and the brake release rate.<br>
[0005] In one feature, the control module restarts the engine when the brake release rate is greater than a predetermined release rate.<br>
In other features, the control module generates a filtered brake signal, calculates a brake-off threshold based on a moving average of the brake signal, and restarts the engine when the filtered brake signal is less than the brake-off threshold.<br>
In another feature, the rollback reduction system restarts the engine by generating an engine restart signal. The engine restart signal is reset when the grade signal is less than a predetermined grade and when the brake signal is greater than a predetermined brake minimum.<br>
Another embodiment of the rollback reduction system includes a brake sensor that generates a brake signal, a vehicle speed sensor that generates a speed signal, and an engine rotational speed sensor that generates an engine rotational speed sensor. The control module calculates a brake release rate based on the brake signal, an acceleration rate based on the speed signal, a braking force based on the brake signal, a driving force based on the engine rotational speed signal. The control module calculates a grade estimate based on a<br>
 <br>
3<br>
predetermined vehicle mass, the acceleration rate, the driving force, and the braking force. The control module restarts the engine based on the grade estimate and the brake release rate.<br>
Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The present invention will become more fully understood from the detailed description and the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
[0011] FIG. 1 is a schematic illustration of an exemplary hybrid vehicle that is operated based on a rollback reduction system according to the present invention;<br>
<br>
FIG. 2 is a flowchart illustrating steps performed by the rollback reduction system to generate and reset an engine restart signal according to the present invention;<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The following description of the preferred embodiment(s) is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses. For purposes of clarity,<br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
 <br>
4<br>
the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify similar elements. As used herein, the term module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 1, a rollback reduction system 10 for a hybrid vehicle is shown. The rollback reduction system 10 may also be implemented in a conventional powertrain vehicle, as discussed below. A control module 12 regulates operation of an engine 14 and an electric motor 16. The control module 12 controls fuel injection and spark to selectively turn off and restart the engine 14. The control module 12 also controls an electric motor 16. The engine 14 and the electric motor 16 are coupled via a belt-alternator-starter system 18. The electric motor may also be coupled to the engine by a chain drive, a clutch system, or other device. The electric motor 16 supplements the engine 14 to produce drive torque to a transmission 20 which in turn produces drive torque to the drive shaft (not shown), which drives wheels of the vehicle. To restart the engine 14, the electric motor 16 is rotated at a speed sufficient to allow the engine 14 to start.<br>
In a conventional powertrain vehicle, the drive torque is provided by the engine 14 alone. In a vehicle rollback reduction system 10 implemented in a conventional powertrain vehicle, the control module 12 regulates the mode of the transmission 20. In neutral-idle mode, the transmission 20 is shifted into neutral. Upon exiting neutral-idle mode, the clutch is reapplied.<br>
 <br>
5<br>
In use, an accelerator pedal 22 is operated by the driver. An accelerator sensor 24 senses a position of the accelerator pedal 22 and generates an accelerator signal that is received by the control module 12. A brake pedal 26 is also operated by the driver. A brake sensor 28 senses application of force on the brake pedal 26. The brake sensor 28 generates a brake signal (BRK) that corresponds to the application of force on the brake pedal 26 and that is received by the control module 12. The brake pedal 26 may be connected to a brake system 30. In an alternate embodiment, the control module 12 may control the brake system 30.<br>
The brake system 30 is subject to brake wear caused by use of the brake system 30 over time. The brake sensor 28 may comprise a brake pressure sensor that is sensitive to the amount of brake pressure being applied to the brake pedal 26 by the driver. A brake pressure sensor provides a brake signal that is independent of brake wear. The brake pressure sensor provides a brake signal that corresponds to a percentage of the maximum possible brake pressure. Alternatively, the brake sensor 28 may comprise a brake pedal position sensor that is sensitive to the displacement of the brake pedal 26 by the driver. A brake pedal position sensor provides a brake signal that is dependent on brake wear. The brake pedal 26 displacement required to achieve a desired braking effect will increase as the brake system 30 suffers brake wear. For this reason, the brake pressure sensor may be preferable to the brake pedal position sensor.<br>
A vehicle speed sensor 34 generates a vehicle speed signal (VS), which is received by the control module 12. The vehicle speed sensor 34 may be connected to the transmission 20. The vehicle speed sensor 34 may alternately be connected to other vehicle components, such as the wheels, the anti-lock brake system, etc., to generate VS.<br>
 <br>
6<br>
A grade sensor 32 generates a grade signal (Grade), which corresponds to the degree of inclination of the vehicle. The grade sensor 32 may comprise an inclinometer. The control module 12 receives the grade signal from the grade sensor 32.<br>
In an alternate embodiment, the grade may be estimated by the control module 12 based on the formula Force = Mass x Acceleration. In such an embodiment, grade is estimated based on the vehicle mass (M), vehicle acceleration (A), vehicle driving force (F Drive), and resistance factors. Resistance factors may include a predetermined rolling resistance force (FRolling), and an aerodynamic resistance force (FAero). The mass of the vehicle multiplied by vehicle acceleration (M x A) is equal to the sum of the forces acting on the vehicle, including the gravitational force exerted on the vehicle as a result of the current grade (FGrade ). Thus, FGrade may be estimated based on the formula:<br>
M X A = Fdrive — FGrade -- F Aero — F rolling — F Brake<br>
Or (solving for Fgrade):<br>
FGrade = Fdrive - FAero — Frolling - Fbrake — (M X A)<br>
where FBrake is the brake application force, calculated based on the brake signal. A is calculated based on VS. A is a positive number when the vehicle is accelerating, and a negative number when the vehicle is decelerating.<br>
Fdrive is calculated according to the following formula:<br>
FDrive = Tdrive / RR<br>
where TDrive is the drive wheel torque and RR is the tire effective rolling radius. FRolling, RR, and M are constants for a given vehicle. TDrive is based on a rotational speed of the engine (ERPM), which is generated by an engine rotational speed sensor 33. ERPM is received by the control module 12 (shown by dashed line in FIG. 1).<br>
FAero is calculated based on the following formula:<br>
FAero = Veh.Drag X Veh.Frontal area X VS2 X P<br>
 <br>
7<br>
where VehDrag is a predetermined vehicle drag coefficient, Veh.Frontal area is a predetermined projected frontal area of the vehicle, VS is described above, and P is the air density.<br>
Air density is estimated based on air temperature and air pressure. The control module 12 receives an air temperature signal generated by an air temperature sensor 35 and an air pressure signal that is generated by an air pressure sensor 37 (shown by dashed line in Fig. 1). The air temperature sensor 35 and the air pressure sensor 37 may be located in the intake manifold (not shown) or at other suitable locations.<br>
[0026] Once FGrade is calculated, the grade estimate may be calculated based on the following formula:<br>
sin(grade) = FGrade / (M * G),<br>
where FGrade and M are described above, and G is the gravitational constant (9.8 mis2).<br>
The control module 12 restarts the engine 14 based on an engine restart signal (ERS). ERS is based upon BRK, Grade (or the grade estimate), VS, and a brake pedal release rate, which is calculated based on BRK When ERS is generated (i.e., when the ERS is set to on) in a hybrid vehicle, the control module 12 restarts the engine and creates forward drive torque by increasing the target RPM of the engine 14 and/or electric motor 16. When ERS is generated in a conventional powertrain vehicle, the transmission 20 exits neutral-idle mode. These steps are taken despite the fact that the brake pedal 26 may remain somewhat depressed and despite the fact that the accelerator pedal 22 may not yet be depressed.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 2, steps for generating and resetting ERS are shown. Control begins with step 102. In step 104, control determines whether ERS is on. When ERS is on, control determines whether ERS should be reset starting with step 106. In step 106, control determines whether Grade (or grade estimate) is less<br>
 <br>
8<br>
than a predetermined minimum grade (GradeMin). GradeMin is chosen to correspond to a grade that is relatively flat. When Grade is less than GradeMin, control determines whether BRK is greater than a predetermined brake minimum (BRKMin) in step 108. When BRK is greater than BRKMln, the brake pedal 26 is being depressed and control resets ERS in step 110 by setting ERS to off. When BRK is not greater than BRKwim, control loops back to step 106.<br>
In step 106, when control determines that Grade is not less than GradeMin, control proceeds to step 112. In step 112, control calculates a Brake-on threshold (BRKOn) as a function of Grade and VS. BRKon may be determined by reference to a tabulated lookup table saved in a memory device (not shown) accessible by the control module 12. An exemplary lookup table for BRKOn is set forth in Table 1 below. Grade is given as a percentage, such that 0% represents horizontal, and 100% represents vertical. BRKon is given as a percentage, such that 0% represents no braking by the driver, and 100% represents maximum braking by the driver. Table 1 is configured for use with a brake sensor 28 which utilizes a brake pressure sensor rather than a brake pedal position sensor. Table 1 : BRKOn Lookup Table<br>
<br>
Grade	Vehicle Speed (Kph) 0 25 !	50	<br>
	0%	2	2	2<br>
	4%		4	3	3<br>
8%		6	5	4<br>
	12%	8	6	5<br>
	16%	10	8	6<br>
 <br>
9<br>
Control determines whether BRK is greater than or equal to BRKOn in step 114. When BRK is greater than or equal to BRKon, control resets ERS in step 110. When BRK is not greater than or equal to BRKOn, control loops back to step 106. As an example, when the vehicle is traveling on a grade of 8%, at a speed of 25 Kph, and the driver applies 5% of the maximum brake pressure, ERS is reset.<br>
In step 104, when ERS is off, control determines whether to generate ERS starting with step 116. In step 116, when BRK is less than or equal to BRKMIH, the brake pedal 26 is not being depressed and control generates ERS, by setting ERS to on in step 118. When BRK is not less than or equal to BRKMIH, control determines whether Grade is less than GradeMm in step 120. In step 120, when Grade is less than GradeMm, control loops back to step 116. In this way, when Grade is less than GradeMm, ERS is not generated unless BRK is less than or equal to BRKMin.<br>
In step 120, when Grade is not less than GradeMm, control calculates the brake release rate in step 122, according to the following formula: brake release rate = - ABRK/ dt,<br>
where ABRK is the change in BRK, and dt is the change in time.<br>
When the brake pedal 26 is being released, BRK will decrease, and ABRK / dt will be a negative number. When the brake pedal 26 is released slowly, ABRK/ dt will be a relatively small negative number, and the brake release rate will be a relatively small positive number. When the brake pedal 26 is released quickly, ABRK / dt will be a relatively large negative number, and the brake release rate will be a relatively large positive number. Control compares -ABRK/ dt to a predetermined release rate threshold (Rel.Thresh) in step 124. When -ABRK / dt is greater than or equal to Rel.Thresh, the brake pedal 26 is being released at a rapid rate, and control proceeds to step 126. When<br>
 <br>
10<br>
-ABRK / dt is not greater than or equal to Rel.-mresh, the brake pedal 26 is not being released at a rapid rate, and control loops back to step 116.<br>
In step 126, control calculates the moving average of BRK (BRKMovmgAvg). BRKwiovrngAvg is the average of BRK over a predetermined time interval. The time interval may be a predetermined number of clock cycles, such as 12 clock cycles. In such case, BRKMovmgAvg is the average of BRK over the 12 most recent clock cycles.<br>
[0035] In step 128, control calculates a filtered brake pressure (BRKFmered)- If the driver depresses the brake pedal 26 with a "fidgety foot" in an unsteady manner, then the BRK will not be stable. To counter the fidgety foot, BRK is debounced or filtered in step 128. Control filters BRK by calculating the moving average of BRK over a relatively short time interval. BRKFmered may be calculated as the moving average of the BRK over 1 clock cycle.<br>
Control then calculates a braking percentage (Braking-%) in step 130. Braking-% is a function of Grade, and increases as Grade increases. Braking-% may be determined from a lookup table. On a steep incline Braking-% may be 85%. On a less steep incline Braking-% may be 75%. In an alternate embodiment, Braking-% may be a predetermined percentage, such as 80%, for all grades.<br>
Control calculates a brake-off threshold (BRKOff) in step 132 according to the following formula:<br>
BRKoff = Braking-% x BRKMovingAvg,<br>
where Braking-% and BRKMovingAvg were calculated in previous steps 126 and 130. BRKOff corresponds to the point during the brake release stroke when ERS is generated.<br>
 <br>
11<br>
Control compares BRKFiltered with BRKOff in step 134. When BRKFiltered is less than or equal to BRKOff, control generates ERS in step 118. Otherwise, control loops back to step 116. In this way, ERS is generated in two instances: (1) when BRK is less than or equal to BRKMin in step 116; and (2) when -ABRK / dt is greated than or equal to Rel.Thresh in step 124, and BRKFilltered is less than or equal to BRKOff in step 134.<br>
After control generates or resets ERS in steps 118 or 110, control sets the target RPM (RPMTarget) for the engine 14 and electric motor 16 based on ERS and Grade in step 130. Control then loops back to step 104.<br>
[0040] Referring now to FIG. 3, the steps for setting RPMTarget based on ERS and Grade are shown. It is understood that the steps described in FIG. 3 are encapsulated in step 130 of FIG. 2. Control begins with step 150. Control determines whether ERS is on in step 152. When ERS is on, control determines whether Grade is greater than or equal to a predetermined maximum grade (GradeMax) in step 154. GradeMax corresponds to a relatively steep grade. When Grade is greater than or equal to GradeMax, control sets RPMTarget to at least RPMcreepMax in step 156. RPMCreep max corresponds to the RPM necessary for the engine 14 and electric motor 16 (or the engine 14 alone in a convention powertrain vehicle) to creep the vehicle forward on an incline greater than or equal to GradeMax- When control determines in step 154 that Grade is not greater than or equal to GradeMax, then control sets RPMTarget to at least RPMCreeP, where RPMcreep corresponds to the RPM necessary to creep the vehicle forward on an incline less than GradeMax. In step 156 and 158, if RPMTarget is already set to a level higher than RPMCreePMax or .RPMCreeP, respectively, then RPMTarget would remain at that higher level. In a conventional powertrain vehicle, in step 156 and 158 control also directs the transmission 20 to exit neutral-idle mode.<br>
 <br>
12<br>
In step 152, when control determines that ERS is off, control determines whether Grade is greater than or equal to GradeMax in step 160 When Grade is greater than or equal to GradeMax, control sets RPMiarget to RPM|dieHold in step 159. RPMidieHoid is the RPM necessary to provide a sufficient amount of torque to the transmission 20 and drive shaft to hold the vehicle on the current incline. When control determines in step 160 that Grade is not greater than or equal to GradeMax, then control turns the engine off by setting RPMTarget to 0 in step 161. After RPMTarget has been set 156, 158, 159, and 161, control ends in step 162.<br>
In a conventional powertrain vehicle, Control may direct the transmission to enter neutral-idle mode in step 161. Likewise, control may direct the transmission to exit neutral-idle mode in steps 156 and 158.<br>
It is understood that the description of the manner in which control sets RPMTarget contained in FIG. 3 is exemplary only, and that a number alternate embodiments exist. For example, RPMTarget could be set based on ERS only. In such an embodiment RPMTarget would be 0 when ERS is reset and RPMcreep when ERS is generated.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 4, a signal flow diagram illustrates the signal processing executed by the control module12 to generate and reset ERS. Variable input signals include: Grade 200, which is received from the grade sensor 32 (or estimated by the control module 12); BRK 202, which is received from the brake sensor 28; and the VS 204, which is received from the vehicle speed sensor 34. In addition, predetermined input signals include: GradeMm 206, BRKwim 208, and Rel.Thresh 210. The output includes ERS 212.<br>
Two "if-then-else" modules 214, 216 are utilized. In general, an If-then-else module is configured with three inputs: an "if input, a "then" input, and an "else" input. When the "if" input is on, the<br>
 <br>
13<br>
output is the same as the "then" input. Otherwise, the output is the same as the "else" input.<br>
The output of a first if-then-else module 214 corresponds to ERS 212. The output signal of a comparator module 218 is on when Grade 200 is less than or equal to GradeMm 206. In such case, ERS 212 corresponds to the output of a comparator module 220. The comparator module 220 is on when BRK 202 is less than or equal to BRKMin 208. If Grade 200 is not less than or equal to GradeMin 206, then the output of the comparator module 218 is off, and ERS 212 corresponds to the output of the other if-then-else module 216. When the "if" input of the second if-then-else module 216 is on, then ERS 212 is on as well.<br>
When BRK 202 is less than or equal to BRKMin 208, the output of an Or module 222 is on, and the "if" input of the second if-then-else module 216 is on, as well as the ERS 212. BRK 202 is received by the -ABRK / dt calculating module 224, the BRKFlltered calculating module 226, and the BRKwovingAvg calculating module 228. Grade 200 is received by the Braking-% calculating module 230 and the BRKon calculating module 232.<br>
BRKotf 236 corresponds to the output of a multiplier module 238, which multiplies BRKwiovmgAvg, as determined by the BRKMovingAvg calculating module 228, by Braking-%, as determined by the Braking-% calculating module 230. When -ABRK / dt, is greater than or equal to Rel.jhresh 210, as determined by comparator module 234, and when BRKfitered is less than or equal to BRKOff 236, as determined by comparator module 240, the output of an And module 242, as well as ERS 212, will be set to on.<br>
A feedback signal 244 is received by a second And module 246. When BRK 202 is greater than or equal to BRKOn, as determined by comparator 248, the output of the And module 246 is off, as well as ERS 212.<br>
