				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS TO CONTROL HYDRAULIC PRESSURE<br>
FOR COMPONENT LUBRICATION IN AN ELECTRO-MECHANICAL<br>
TRANSMISSION<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]     This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/982,863 filed on October 26, 2007 which is hereby incorporated herein<br>
by reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002]   This disclosure pertains to control systems for electro-mechanical<br>
transmissions.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003]   The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0004]   Devices transforming electrical energy into a torque or transforming a<br>
torque into electrical energy operate with some efficiency. Some measure of<br>
the input is transformed into the output. However, in either operation, some<br>
measure of the input is lost, primarily as heat rejected to the device.<br>
[0005]   Known powertrain architectures include torque-generative devices,<br>
including internal combustion engines and electric machines, which transmit<br>
torque through a transmission device to an output member. One exemplary<br>
powertrain includes a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
 <br>
transmission which utilizes an input member for receiving motive torque from<br>
a prime mover power source, preferably an internal combustion engine, and an<br>
output member. The output member can be operatively connected to a<br>
driveline for a motor vehicle for transmitting tractive torque thereto. Electric<br>
machines, operative as motors or generators, generate a torque input to the<br>
transmission, independently of a torque input from the internal combustion<br>
engine. The electric machines may transform vehicle kinetic energy,<br>
transmitted through the vehicle driveline, to electrical energy that is storable in<br>
an electrical energy storage device. A control system monitors various inputs<br>
from the vehicle and the operator and provides operational control of the<br>
powertrain, including controlling transmission operating state and gear<br>
shifting, controlling the torque-generative devices, and regulating the electrical<br>
power interchange among the electrical energy storage device and the electric<br>
machines to manage outputs of the transmission, including torque and<br>
rotational speed. A hydraulic control system is known to provide pressurized<br>
hydraulic fluid for a number of functions throughout the powertrain.<br>
[0006]   Operation of the above devices within a hybrid powertrain vehicle<br>
require management of numerous torque bearing shafts or devices<br>
representing connections to the above mentioned engine, electrical machines,<br>
and driveline. Input torque from the engine and input torque from the electric<br>
machine or electric machines can be applied individually or cooperatively to<br>
provide output torque. Various control schemes and operational connections<br>
between the various aforementioned components of the hybrid drive system<br>
are known, and the control system must be able to engage to and disengage the<br>
various components from the transmission in order to perform the functions of<br>
 <br>
the hybrid powertrain system. Engagement and disengagement are known to<br>
be accomplished within the transmission by employing selectively operable<br>
clutches.<br>
[0007]   Clutches are devices well known in the art for engaging and<br>
disengaging shafts including the management of rotational velocity and torque<br>
differences between the shafts. Clutches are known in a variety of designs and<br>
control methods. One known type of clutch is a mechanical clutch operating<br>
by separating or joining two connective surfaces, for instance, clutch plates,<br>
operating, when joined, to apply frictional torque to each other. One control<br>
method for operating such a mechanical clutch includes applying the hydraulic<br>
control system implementing fluidic pressures transmitted through hydraulic<br>
lines to exert or release clamping force between the two connective surfaces.<br>
Operated thusly, the clutch is not operated in a binary manner, but rather is<br>
capable of a range of engagement states, from fully disengaged, to<br>
synchronized but not engaged, to engaged but with only minimal clamping<br>
force, to engaged with some maximum clamping force. The clamping force<br>
available to be applied to the clutch determines how much reactive torque the<br>
clutch can carry before the clutch slips.<br>
[0008]   The hydraulic control system, as described above, utilizes lines filled<br>
with hydraulic fluid to selectively activate clutches within the transmission.<br>
However, the hydraulic control system is also known to perform a number of<br>
other functions in a hybrid powertrain. For example, as described above, an<br>
electric machine utilized within a hybrid powertrain generates heat. Known<br>
embodiments utilize hydraulic fluid from the hydraulic control system to cool<br>
the electric machine in a machine cooling function. Additionally, known<br>
 <br>
embodiments utilize hydraulic fluid to lubricate mechanical devices, such as<br>
bearings. Also, hydraulic circuits are known to include some level of internal<br>
leakage.<br>
[0009]   Hydraulic fluid is known to be pressurized within a hydraulic control<br>
system with a pump. The pump can be electrically powered or preferably<br>
mechanically driven. In addition to this first main hydraulic pump, hydraulic<br>
control systems are known to also include an auxiliary hydraulic pump. The<br>
internal impelling mechanism rotates operates at some speed, drawing<br>
hydraulic fluid from a return line and pressurizing the hydraulic control<br>
system. The supply of hydraulic flow by the pump or pumps is affected by a<br>
number of factors, including but not limited to the speed of the pumps, the<br>
back pressure exerted by the hydraulic line pressure (PLINE), and the<br>
temperature of the hydraulic fluid (TOIL).<br>
[0010]   The resulting or net PLINE within the hydraulic control system is<br>
impacted by a number of factors. FIG. 1 schematically illustrates a model of<br>
factors impacting hydraulic flow in an exemplary hydraulic control system, in<br>
accordance with the present disclosure. As one having ordinary skill in the art<br>
will appreciate, conservation of mass explains that, in steady state, flow<br>
entering a system must equal the flow exiting from that system. As applied to<br>
FIG. 1, a flow of hydraulic oil is supplied to the hydraulic control system by<br>
the pumps. The flow exits the hydraulic control system through the various<br>
functions served by the hydraulic control system. This exemplary<br>
embodiment includes the following functions: hydraulic oil fills clutch<br>
mechanisms in order to provide clamping force required to lock the clutch, as<br>
described above; hydraulic oil provides cooling of the electric machines and<br>
 <br>
other components as required; hydraulic oil is used to lubricate portions of the<br>
transmission; and hydraulic oil flows through leakage internal to the hydraulic<br>
circuit. PLINE describes the resulting charge of hydraulic oil maintained in the<br>
system: for any flow through a system, the resulting pressure within the<br>
system depends upon the flow resistance within the system. Higher flow<br>
resistance in the system results in higher system pressures for a given flow.<br>
Conversely, lower flow resistance in the system results in lower system<br>
pressures for a given flow. Applied to FIG. 1, PLINE or the pressure within the<br>
hydraulic control system, changes depending upon usage of the hydraulic<br>
control system. For example, filling a previously unfilled transmission clutch<br>
consumes a significant amount of flow from the hydraulic control system.<br>
The orifice leading to the clutch includes low resistance in order to draw the<br>
significant amount of hydraulic oil over a short time span. As a result, during<br>
the clutch filling process, PLINE in an otherwise unchanged hydraulic control<br>
system will reduce. Conversely, for a given set of functions served by the<br>
hydraulic control system, PLINE varies based upon the flow supplied by the<br>
pumps. For any given set of flow restrictions associated with the functions<br>
served, increased flow from the pumps will result in higher PLINE.<br>
[0011]   The lubrication function served by the hydraulic control system<br>
includes some flow of hydraulic oil to the electric machine or machines<br>
utilized by the hybrid powertrain, for example, to keep a bearing from failing<br>
due to frictional forces within the bearing. Such frictional forces and the<br>
resulting stresses and heat upon the bearing increase with the speed of the<br>
device driving the bearing. Bearings are designed to work with an adequate<br>
level of lubrication to reduce the frictional forces within the bearing. If such a<br>
 <br>
bearing is starved of adequate lubrication, then forces, stresses, and heat<br>
within the bearing quickly deviate from designed levels.<br>
[0012]   Known control methods to lubricate devices within the hybrid<br>
powertrain include utilizing the hydraulic control system to provide a flow<br>
through a fixed orifice loop. In such an exemplary arrangement, the resulting<br>
flow to the coolant loop will increase proportionally to an increase in PLINE.<br>
Additionally, a pressure-sensitive valve is known to be utilized, wherein<br>
increasing PLINE opens the valve, lowering the flow resistance of the orifice<br>
created by the valve. As a result, flow will increase non-linearly with<br>
increasing PLINE. with extra flow resulting from an incremental increase in<br>
PLINE Such mechanical valves are beneficial because no sensor is needed, and<br>
the primary sources of error in a pressure-sensitive valve, lag and hysteresis,<br>
generally will not significant deviation from flow levels required for<br>
lubrication.<br>
[0013]   As is well known in the art and as described above, lubrication<br>
required for bearings associated with operation of an electric machine increase<br>
as the rotational speed of the electric machine increases. However, as<br>
described above, the rate of hydraulic oil and, therefore, the flow of the<br>
hydraulic oil flowing to the device through a lubrication loop equipped with<br>
either a fixed orifice or a pressure-sensitive valve only increase only with<br>
PLINE. Because PLINE is frequently directly driven by an engine, and because<br>
electric machine operation is not tied to engine operation, PLINE will not<br>
necessarily increase as an electric machine speed increases. As a result,<br>
situations can occur where high electric machine speeds and low PLINE result<br>
in the electric machine not receiving sufficient lubrication. Such a condition<br>
 <br>
can be avoided by designing the flow restriction of the coolant loop to provide<br>
sufficient lubrication for all foreseeable operating conditions of the electric<br>
machine, but such a design requires an excessive flow of hydraulic oil during<br>
periods when the lubrication requirements of the electric machine do not<br>
warrant the design. Additionally, valves are known to modulate flow based<br>
upon a control signal. Such control signals however are based upon sensor<br>
readings; are reactive to changes, for example, in temperature and generally<br>
include a lag time; require expensive sensors; and are subject to sensor failure.<br>
A method to control lubrication flow in a hydraulic control system by<br>
modulating PLINE based upon speeds of torque generative devices would be<br>
beneficial.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0014]   A method for controlling hydraulic line pressure for component<br>
lubrication in an electro-mechanical transmission mechanically-operatively<br>
coupled to an internal combustion engine and an electric machine, and adapted<br>
to selectively transmit mechanical power to an output member includes<br>
monitoring a speed of the engine, monitoring a speed of the electric machine,<br>
determining a minimum line pressure required to lubricate the engine based<br>
upon the speed of the engine, determining a minimum line pressure required to<br>
lubricate the electric machine based upon the speed of the electric machine,<br>
controlling a minimum line pressure of a hydraulic control system to at least<br>
satisfy a larger value of the minimum line pressure required to lubricate the<br>
engine and the minimum line pressure required to lubricate the electric<br>
machine.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0022]   Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating certain exemplary embodiments only and not for the<br>
 <br>
purpose of limiting the same, FIGS. 2 and 3 depict an exemplary electro-<br>
mechanical hybrid powertrain. The exemplary electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
powertrain in accordance with the present disclosure is depicted in FIG. 2,<br>
comprising a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
transmission 10 operatively connected to an engine 14 and first and second<br>
electric machines ('MG-A') 56 and ('MG-B') 72.  The engine 14 and first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72 each generate power which can be<br>
transmitted to the transmission 10. The power generated by the engine 14 and<br>
the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 and transmitted to the<br>
transmission 10 is described in terms of input torques, referred to herein as TI,<br>
TA, and TB respectively, and speed, referred to herein as NI, NA, and NB,<br>
respectively.<br>
[0023]   The exemplary engine 14 comprises a multi-cylinder internal<br>
combustion engine selectively operative in several states to transmit torque to<br>
the transmission 10 via an input shaft 12, and can be either a spark-ignition or<br>
a compression-ignition engine. The engine 14 includes a crankshaft (not<br>
shown) operatively coupled to the input shaft 12 of the transmission 10. A<br>
rotational speed sensor 11 monitors rotational speed of the input shaft 12.<br>
Power output from the engine 14, comprising rotational speed and output<br>
torque, can differ from the input speed, NI, and the input torque, TI, to the<br>
transmission 10 due to placement of torque-consuming components on the<br>
input shaft 12 between the engine 14 and the transmission 10, e.g., a hydraulic<br>
pump (not shown) and/or a torque management device (not shown).<br>
[0024]   The exemplary transmission 10 comprises three planetary-gear sets<br>
24,26 and 28, and four selectively engageable torque-transmitting devices,<br>
 <br>
i.e., clutches Cl 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75. As used herein, clutches refer<br>
to any type of friction torque transfer device including single or compound<br>
plate clutches or packs, band clutches, and brakes, for example. A hydraulic<br>
control circuit 42, preferably controlled by a transmission control module<br>
(hereafter TCM') 17, is operative to control clutch states. Clutches C2 62 and<br>
C4 75 preferably comprise hydraulically-applied rotating friction clutches.<br>
Clutches Cl 70 and C3 73 preferably comprise hydraulically-controlled<br>
stationary devices that can be selectively grounded to a transmission case 68.<br>
Each of the clutches Cl 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 is preferably<br>
hydraulically applied, selectively receiving pressurized hydraulic fluid via the<br>
hydraulic control circuit 42.<br>
[0025]   The first and second electric machines 56 and 72 preferably comprise<br>
three-phase AC machines, each including a stator (not shown) and a rotor (not<br>
shown), and respective resolvers 80 and 82. The motor stator for each<br>
machine is grounded to an outer portion of the transmission case 68, and<br>
includes a stator core with coiled electrical windings extending therefrom.<br>
The rotor for the first electric machine 56 is supported on a hub plate gear that<br>
is operatively attached to shaft 60 via the second planetary gear set 26. The<br>
rotor for the second electric machine 72 is fixedly attached to a sleeve shaft<br>
hub 66.<br>
[0026]   Each of the resolvers 80 and 82 preferably comprises a variable<br>
reluctance device including a resolver stator (not shown) and a resolver rotor<br>
(not shown). The resolvers 80 and 82 are appropriately positioned and<br>
assembled on respective ones of the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72. Stators of respective ones of the resolvers 80 and 82 are operatively<br>
 <br>
connected to one of the stators for the first and second electric machines 56<br>
and 72. The resolver rotors are operatively connected to the rotor for the<br>
corresponding first and second electric machines 56 and 72. Each of the<br>
resolvers 80 and 82 is signally and operatively connected to a transmission<br>
power inverter control module (hereafter 'TPIM') 19, and each senses and<br>
monitors rotational position of the resolver rotor relative to the resolver stator,<br>
thus monitoring rotational position of respective ones of first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72. Additionally, the signals output from the<br>
resolvers 80 and 82 are interpreted to provide the rotational speeds for first<br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72, i.e., NA and NB, respectively.<br>
[0027]   The transmission 10 includes an output member 64, e.g. a shaft,<br>
which is operably connected to a driveline 90 for a vehicle (not shown), to<br>
provide output power, e.g., to vehicle wheels 93, one of which is shown in<br>
FIG. 2. The output power is characterized in terms of an output rotational<br>
speed, No and an output torque, To. A transmission output speed sensor 84<br>
monitors rotational speed and rotational direction of the output member 64.<br>
Each of the vehicle wheels 93, is preferably equipped with a sensor 94 adapted<br>
to monitor wheel speed, VSS-WHL, the output of which is monitored by a<br>
control module of a distributed control module system described with respect<br>
to FIG. 3, to determine vehicle speed, and absolute and relative wheel speeds<br>
for braking control, traction control, and vehicle acceleration management.<br>
[0028]   The input torques from the engine 14 and the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72 (TI, TA, and TB respectively) are generated as a result of<br>
energy conversion from fuel or electrical potential stored in an electrical<br>
energy storage device (hereafter 'ESD') 74. The ESD 74 is high voltage DC-<br>
 <br>
coupled to the TPIM 19 via DC transfer conductors 27. The transfer<br>
conductors 27 include a contactor switch 38. When the contactor switch 38 is<br>
closed, under normal operation, electric current can flow between the ESD 74<br>
and the TPIM 19. When the contactor switch 38 is opened electric current<br>
flow between the ESD 74 and the TPIM 19 is interrupted. The TPIM 19<br>
transmits electrical power to and from the first electric machine 56 by transfer<br>
conductors 29, and the TPIM 19 similarly transmits electrical power to and<br>
from the second electric machine 72 by transfer conductors 31, in response to<br>
torque commands for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 to<br>
achieve the input torques TA and TB. Electrical current is transmitted to and<br>
from the ESD 74 in accordance with whether the ESD 74 is being charged or<br>
discharged.<br>
[0029]   The TPIM 19 includes the pair of power inverters (not shown) and<br>
respective motor control modules (not shown) configured to receive the torque<br>
commands and control inverter states therefrom for providing motor drive or<br>
regeneration functionality to meet the commanded motor torques TA and TB.<br>
The power inverters comprise known complementary three-phase power<br>
electronics devices, and each includes a plurality of insulated gate bipolar<br>
transistors (not shown) for converting DC power from the ESD 74 to AC<br>
power for powering respective ones of the first and second electric machines<br>
56 and 72, by switching at high frequencies. The insulated gate bipolar<br>
transistors form a switch mode power supply configured to receive control<br>
commands. There is typically one pair of insulated gate bipolar transistors for<br>
each phase of each of the three-phase electric machines. States of the<br>
insulated gate bipolar transistors are controlled to provide motor drive<br>
 <br>
mechanical power generation or electric power regeneration functionality.<br>
The three-phase inverters receive or supply DC electric power via DC transfer<br>
conductors 27 and transform it to or from three-phase AC power, which is<br>
conducted to or from the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 for<br>
operation as motors or generators via transfer conductors 29 and 31<br>
respectively.<br>
[0030]   FIG. 3 is a schematic block diagram of the distributed control module<br>
system. The elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of an overall<br>
vehicle control architecture, and provide coordinated system control of the<br>
exemplary powertrain described in FIG. 2. The distributed control module<br>
system synthesizes pertinent information and inputs, and executes algorithms<br>
to control various actuators to achieve control objectives, including objectives<br>
related to fuel economy, emissions, performance, drivability, and protection of<br>
hardware, including batteries of ESD 74 and the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72. The distributed control module system includes an<br>
engine control module (hereafter 'ECM') 23, the TCM 17, a battery pack<br>
control module (hereafter 'BPCM') 21, and the TPIM 19. A hybrid control<br>
module (hereafter 'HCP') 5 provides supervisory control and coordination of<br>
the ECM 23, the TCM 17, the BPCM 21, and the TPIM 19. A user interface<br>
CUT) 13 is operatively connected to a plurality of devices through which a<br>
vehicle operator controls or directs operation of the electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
powertrain. The devices include an accelerator pedal 113 ('AP') from which<br>
an operator torque request is determined, an operator brake pedal 112 ('BP'), a<br>
transmission gear selector 114 ('PRNDL'), and a vehicle speed cruise control<br>
(not shown). The transmission gear selector 114 may have a discrete number<br>
 <br>
of operator-selectable positions, including the rotational direction of the output<br>
member 64 to enable one of a forward and a reverse direction.<br>
[0031]   The aforementioned control modules communicate with other control<br>
modules, sensors, and actuators via a local area network (hereafter 'LAN') bus<br>
6. The LAN bus 6 allows for structured communication of states of operating<br>
parameters and actuator command signals between the various control<br>
modules. The specific communication protocol utilized is application-specific.<br>
The LAN bus 6 and appropriate protocols provide for robust messaging and<br>
multi-control module interfacing between the aforementioned control<br>
modules, and other control modules providing functionality such as antilock<br>
braking, traction control, and vehicle stability. Multiple communications<br>
buses may be used to improve communications speed and provide some level<br>
of signal redundancy and integrity. Communication between individual<br>
control modules can also be effected using a direct link, e.g., a serial<br>
peripheral interface ('SPI') bus (not shown).<br>
[0032]   The HCP 5 provides supervisory control of the powertrain, serving to<br>
coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19, and BPCM 21.<br>
Based upon various input signals from the user interface 13 and the<br>
powertrain, including the ESD 74, the HCP 5 generates various commands,<br>
including: the operator torque request ('TO_REQ') a commanded output torque<br>
('TCMD') to the driveline 90, an engine input torque command, clutch torques<br>
for the torque-transfer clutches Cl 70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75 of the<br>
transmission 10; and the torque commands for the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72, respectively. The TCM 17 is operatively connected to the<br>
hydraulic control circuit 42 and provides various functions including<br>
 <br>
monitoring various pressure sensing devices (not shown) and generating and<br>
communicating control signals to various solenoids (not shown) thereby<br>
controlling pressure switches and control valves contained within the<br>
hydraulic control circuit 42.<br>
[0033]    The ECM 23 is operatively connected to the engine 14, and functions<br>
to acquire data from sensors and control actuators of the engine 14 over a<br>
plurality of discrete lines, shown for simplicity as an aggregate bi-directional<br>
interface cable 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine input torque command<br>
from the HCP 5. The ECM 23 determines the actual engine input torque, TI,<br>
provided to the transmission 10 at that point in time based upon monitored<br>
engine speed and load, which is communicated to the HCP 5. The ECM 23<br>
monitors input from the rotational speed sensor 11 to determine the engine<br>
input speed to the input shaft 12, which translates to the transmission input<br>
speed, NI. The ECM 23 monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to<br>
determine states of other engine operating parameters including, e.g., a<br>
manifold pressure, engine coolant temperature, ambient air temperature, and<br>
ambient pressure. The engine load can be determined, for example, from the<br>
manifold pressure, or alternatively, from monitoring operator input to the<br>
accelerator pedal 113. The ECM 23 generates and communicates command<br>
signals to control engine actuators, including, e.g., fuel injectors, ignition<br>
modules, and throttle control modules, none of which are shown.<br>
[0034]   The TCM 17 is operatively connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to determine states of transmission<br>
operating parameters. The TCM 17 generates and communicates command<br>
signals to control the transmission 10, including controlling the hydraulic<br>
 <br>
control circuit 42. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include estimated<br>
clutch torques for each of the clutches, i.e., Cl 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75,<br>
and rotational output speed, No, of the output member 64. Other actuators and<br>
sensors may be used to provide additional information from the TCM 17 to the<br>
HCP 5 for control purposes. The TCM 17 monitors inputs from pressure<br>
switches (not shown) and selectively actuates pressure control solenoids (not<br>
shown) and shift solenoids (not shown) of the hydraulic control circuit 42 to<br>
selectively actuate the various clutches Cl 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 to<br>
achieve various transmission operating range states, as described hereinbelow.<br>
[0035]   The BPCM 21 is signally connected to sensors (not shown) to<br>
monitor the ESD 74, including states of electrical current and voltage<br>
parameters, to provide information indicative of parametric states of the<br>
batteries of the ESD 74 to the HCP 5. The parametric states of the batteries<br>
preferably include battery state-of-charge, battery voltage, battery temperature,<br>
and available battery power, referred to as a range PBAT_MIN to PBAT_MAX.<br>
[0036]   Each of the control modules ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19 and BPCM<br>
21 is preferably a general-purpose digital computer comprising a<br>
microprocessor or central processing unit, storage mediums comprising read<br>
only memory ('ROM'), random access memory ('RAM'), electrically<br>
programmable read only memory ('EPROM'), a high speed clock, analog to<br>
digital ('A/D') and digital to analog ('D/A') circuitry, and input/output<br>
circuitry and devices ('I/O') and appropriate signal conditioning and buffer<br>
circuitry. Each of the control modules has a set of control algorithms,<br>
comprising resident program instructions and calibrations stored in one of the<br>
storage mediums and executed to provide the respective functions of each<br>
 <br>
computer. Information transfer between the control modules is preferably<br>
accomplished using the LAN bus 6 and SPI buses. The control algorithms are<br>
executed during preset loop cycles such that each algorithm is executed at<br>
least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the non-volatile memory<br>
devices are executed by one of the central processing units to monitor inputs<br>
from the sensing devices and execute control and diagnostic routines to<br>
control operation of the actuators, using preset calibrations. Loop cycles are<br>
executed at regular intervals, for example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100<br>
milliseconds during ongoing operation of the powertrain. Alternatively,<br>
algorithms may be executed in response to the occurrence of an event.<br>
[0037]   The exemplary powertrain selectively operates in one of several<br>
operating range states that can be described in terms of an engine state<br>
comprising one of an engine on state ('ON') and an engine off state ('OFF'),<br>
and a transmission state comprising a plurality of fixed gears and continuously<br>
variable operating modes, described with reference to Table 1, below.<br>

 <br>
[0038]   Each of the transmission operating range states is described in the<br>
table and indicates which of the specific clutches Cl 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4<br>
75 are applied for each of the operating range states. A first continuously<br>
variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode I, or MI, is selected by applying clutch Cl 70<br>
only in order to "ground" the outer gear member of the third planetary gear set<br>
28. The engine state can be one of ON ('MI_Eng_On') or OFF<br>
('MI_Eng_Off). A second continuously variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode II, or<br>
MII, is selected by applying clutch C2 62 only to connect the shaft 60 to the<br>
carrier of the third planetary gear set 28. The engine state can be one of ON<br>
('MII_Eng_On') or OFF ('MII_Eng_Off). For purposes of this description,<br>
when the engine state is OFF, the engine input speed is equal to zero<br>
revolutions per minute ('RPM'), i.e., the engine crankshaft is not rotating.  A<br>
fixed gear operation provides a fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed<br>
of the transmission 10, i.e., NI/No, is achieved. A first fixed gear operation<br>
('FG1') is selected by applying clutches Cl 70 and C4 75. A second fixed<br>
gear operation ('FG2') is selected by applying clutches Cl 70 and C2 62. A<br>
third fixed gear operation ('FG3') is selected by applying clutches C2 62 and<br>
C4 75. A fourth fixed gear operation ('FG4') is selected by applying clutches<br>
C2 62 and C3 73. The fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed increases<br>
with increased fixed gear operation due to decreased gear ratios in the<br>
planetary gears 24, 26, and 28. The rotational speeds of the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72, NA and NB respectively, are dependent on internal<br>
rotation of the mechanism as defined by the clutching and are proportional to<br>
the input speed measured at the input shaft 12.<br>
 <br>
[0039]   In response to operator input via the accelerator pedal 113 and brake<br>
pedal 112 as captured by the user interface 13, the HCP 5 and one or more of<br>
the other control modules determine the commanded output torque, TCMD,<br>
intended to meet the operator torque request, TO_REQ, to be executed at the<br>
output member 64 and transmitted to the driveline 90. Final vehicle<br>
acceleration is affected by other factors including, e.g., road load, road grade,<br>
and vehicle mass. The operating range state is determined for the transmission<br>
10 based upon a variety of operating characteristics of the powertrain. This<br>
includes the operator torque request, communicated through the accelerator<br>
pedal 113 and brake pedal 112 to the user interface 13 as previously described.<br>
The operating range state may be predicated on a powertrain torque demand<br>
caused by a command to operate the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72 in an electrical energy generating mode or in a torque generating mode.<br>
The operating range state can be determined by an optimization algorithm or<br>
routine which determines optimum system efficiency based upon operator<br>
demand for power, battery state of charge, and energy efficiencies of the<br>
engine 14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. The control<br>
system manages torque inputs from the engine 14 and the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72 based upon an outcome of the executed<br>
optimization routine, and system efficiencies are optimized thereby, to manage<br>
fuel economy and battery charging. Furthermore, operation can be determined<br>
based upon a fault in a component or system. The HCP 5 monitors the torque-<br>
generative devices, and determines the power output from the transmission 10<br>
required to achieve the desired output torque to meet the operator torque<br>
request. As should be apparent from the description above, the ESD 74 and<br>
 <br>
the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 are electrically-operatively<br>
coupled for power flow therebetween. Furthermore, the engine 14, the first<br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72, and the electro-mechanical<br>
transmission 10 are mechanically-operatively coupled to transmit power<br>
therebetween to generate a power flow to the output member 64.<br>
[0040]   FIG. 4 depicts a schematic diagram of the hydraulic control circuit 42<br>
for controlling flow of hydraulic fluid in the exemplary transmission. A main<br>
hydraulic pump 88 is driven off the input shaft 12 from the engine 14, and an<br>
auxiliary pump 110 controlled by the TPIM 19 to provide pressurized fluid to<br>
the hydraulic control circuit 42 through valve 140. The auxiliary pump 110<br>
preferably comprises an electrically-powered pump of an appropriate size and<br>
capacity to provide sufficient flow of pressurized hydraulic fluid into the<br>
hydraulic control circuit 42 when operational. The hydraulic control circuit 42<br>
selectively distributes hydraulic pressure to a plurality of devices, including<br>
the torque-transfer clutches Cl 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75, active cooling<br>
circuits for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 (not shown), and a<br>
base cooling circuit for cooling and lubricating the transmission 10 via<br>
passages 142, 144 (not depicted in detail). As previously stated, the TCM 17<br>
actuates the various clutches to achieve one of the transmission operating<br>
range states through selective actuation of hydraulic circuit flow control<br>
devices comprising variable pressure control solenoids ('PCS') PCS1 108,<br>
PCS2 114, PCS3 112, PCS4 116 and solenoid-controlled flow management<br>
valves, X-valve 119 and Y-valve 121. The hydraulic control circuit 42 is<br>
fluidly connected to pressure switches PS1, PS2, PS3, and PS4 via passages<br>
122, 124, 126, and 128, respectively. The pressure control solenoid PCS1 108<br>
 <br>
has a control position of normally high and is operative to modulate the<br>
magnitude of fluidic pressure in the hydraulic circuit through fluidic<br>
interaction with controllable pressure regulator 107 and spool valve 109. The<br>
controllable pressure regulator 107 and spool valve 109 interact with PCS1<br>
108 to control hydraulic pressure in the hydraulic control circuit 42 over a<br>
range of pressures and may provide additional functionality for the hydraulic<br>
control circuit 42. Pressure control solenoid PCS3 112 has a control position<br>
of normally high, and is fluidly connected to spool valve 113 and operative to<br>
effect flow therethrough when actuated. Spool valve 113 is fluidly connected<br>
to pressure switch PS3 via passage 126. Pressure control solenoid PCS2 114<br>
has a control position of normally high, and is fluidly connected to spool valve<br>
115 and operative to effect flow therethrough when actuated. Spool valve 115<br>
is fluidly connected to pressure switch PS2 via passage 124. Pressure control<br>
solenoid PCS4 116 has a control position of normally low, and is fluidly<br>
connected to spool valve 117 and operative to effect flow therethrough when<br>
actuated. Spool valve 117 is fluidly connected to pressure switch PS4 via<br>
passage 128.<br>
[0041]   The X-Valve 119 and Y-Valve 121 each comprise flow management<br>
valves controlled by solenoids 118, 120, respectively, in the exemplary<br>
system, and have control states of High (' 1') and Low ('0'). The control states<br>
refer to positions of each valve to which control flow to different devices in<br>
the hydraulic control circuit 42 and the transmission 10. The X-valve 119 is<br>
operative to direct pressurized fluid to clutches C3 73 and C4 75 and cooling<br>
systems for stators of the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 via<br>
fluidic passages 136, 138, 144, 142 respectively, depending upon the source of<br>
 <br>
the fluidic input, as is described hereinafter. The Y-valve 121 is operative to<br>
direct pressurized fluid to clutches Cl 70 and C2 62 via fluidic passages 132<br>
and 134 respectively, depending upon the source of the fluidic input, as is<br>
described hereinafter. The Y-valve 121 is fluidly connected to pressure switch<br>
PS1 via passage 122.<br>
[0042]   The hydraulic control circuit 42 includes a base cooling circuit for<br>
providing hydraulic fluid to cool the stators of the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72. The base cooling circuit includes fluid conduits from the<br>
valve 140 flowing directly to a flow restrictor which leads to fluidic passage<br>
144 leading to the base cooling circuit for the stator of the first electric<br>
machine 56, and to a flow restrictor which leads to fluidic passage 142 leading<br>
to the base cooling circuit for the stator of the second electric machine 72.<br>
Active cooling of stators for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72<br>
is effected by selective actuation of pressure control solenoids PCS2 114,<br>
PCS3 112 and PCS4 116 and solenoid-controlled flow management valves X-<br>
valve 119 and Y-valve 121, which leads to flow of hydraulic fluid around the<br>
selected stator and permits heat to be transferred therebetween, primarily<br>
through conduction.<br>
[0043]   An exemplary logic table to accomplish control of the exemplary<br>
hydraulic control circuit 42 to control operation of the transmission 10 in one<br>
of the transmission operating range states is provided with reference to Table<br>

[0044]   A Low Range is defined as a transmission operating range state<br>
comprising one of the first continuously variable mode and the first and<br>
second fixed gear operations. A High Range is defined as a transmission<br>
operating range state comprising one of the second continuously variable<br>
mode and the third and fourth fixed gear operations. Selective control of the<br>
X-valve 119 and the Y-valve 121 and actuation of the solenoids PCS2 112,<br>
PCS3 114, PCS4 116 facilitate flow of hydraulic fluid to actuate clutches Cl<br>
70, C2 63, C3 73, and C4 75, and provide cooling for the stators the first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72.<br>
[0045]   In operation, a transmission operating range state, i.e. one of the fixed<br>
gear and continuously variable mode operations, is selected for the exemplary<br>
 <br>
correlation between PLINE, the determinative factor in flow through the coolant<br>
loop, and the cooling load or cooling capacity required by the operation of the<br>
electric machine or machines. As a result, it is preferable to control the flow<br>
through the coolant loop based upon the cooling requirements of the electric<br>
machine. A method is described to control electric machine cooling by<br>
modulating PLINE based upon electric machine cooling requirements predicted<br>
by electric machine speeds.<br>
[0047]   FIG. 5 illustrates an information flow diagram describing an<br>
exemplary determination of the minimum PLINE that will meet lubrication<br>
requirements based upon an engine speed and electric machine speeds, in<br>
accordance with the present disclosure. Control system 200 is depicted<br>
including input speed to minimum pressure conversion blocks 210, 220, and<br>
230 and max block 240. The pictured system is useful to monitor a hybrid<br>
powertrain consisting of an engine and a first and second electric machine, all<br>
requiring lubrication supplied by the hydraulic control system. However, it<br>
will be appreciated that the number of input can be modulated for a system<br>
utilizing a single electric machine or more than two electric machines, and the<br>
disclosure is not intended to be limited to the specific embodiments described<br>
herein. Minimum pressure conversion blocks 210, 220, and 230 monitor<br>
inputs NI, NA, and NB, respectively. Each conversion block utilizes a look-up<br>
table or an algorithm to determine a minimum PLINE or PMIN required to supply<br>
lubrication to each respective torque generative device. These PMIN values are<br>
provided as input to max block 240, and the maximum PMIN is utilized to<br>
provide the minimum PLINE required to provide adequate lubrication or PMIN<br>
LUBE.<br>
 <br>
[0048]   As described above, the hydraulic control system provides a flow of<br>
hydraulic oil to a number of functions. The method described above provides<br>
PMIN LUBE to a control system operating hydraulic pumps and modulating<br>
service of flow to the various functions in order to maintain a required PLINE.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates an information flow diagram describing an exemplary<br>
determination of the minimum PLINE that will meet requirements of functions<br>
served by a hydraulic control system, in accordance with the present<br>
disclosure. In addition to PMIN LUBE, PMIN terms are provided for each of the<br>
other functions, including, in this exemplary embodiment, clutch operation, a<br>
base cooling loop, and an active cooling loop. Returning to FIG. 6, control<br>
system 300 includes max block 302 and max block 304. Max block 304<br>
operates by methods described above and provides a PMIN LUBE. By other<br>
means known in the art, a PMIN CLUTCH, PMIN BASE COOLING, PMIN ACTIVE COOLING<br>
are additionally provided as inputs to max block 302. Among the various PMIN<br>
terms received as inputs to max block 302, the highest value is selected and is<br>
utilized to control the hydraulic control system and the included hydraulic<br>
pumps.<br>
[0049]   The measurements and calculations required to determine the various<br>
terms described above are performed cyclically, with the operations occurring<br>
in a loop or a combination of loops. As will be appreciated by one having<br>
ordinary skill in the art, sample rates will vary and are influenced by speeds of<br>
the computerized processors involved, the required sample rates for accurate<br>
control of PLINE, and various other factors.<br>
[0050]   It is understood that modifications are allowable within the scope of<br>
the disclosure. The disclosure has been described with specific reference to<br>
 <br>
the preferred embodiments and modifications thereto. Further modifications<br>
and alterations may occur to others upon reading and understanding the<br>
specification. It is intended to include all such modifications and alterations<br>
insofar as they come within the scope of the disclosure.<br>
