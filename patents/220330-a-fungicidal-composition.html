				<td>yet. These compounds, however, are expected to have a mechanism of action different from conventional control agents for rice blast, for example, because control effect can also be attained against strains resistant to kasugamycin, organic phosphorus agents and strobilurin compounds and, in addition, fungicidal activity is exhibited without inhibition of biosynthesis of melanin in culture media.<br>
Strobilurin fungicidal compounds have been reported to have excellent control effect or high fungicidal activity against a plurality of fungal diseases of paddy rice including rice blast, or various fungal diseases or pathogenic fungi as fungi causative of these diseases that pose cultivation problems of barley and wheat, vegetables, and fruit trees. The excellent control effect of strobilurin compounds and the mechanism of action thereof are described, for example, in Noyaku Handobukku (Agricultural Chemical Handbook) 2001 (published in 2001 by Japan Plant Protection Association), and Ippan Itaku Shiken Seisekisho (General Contract Test Report) (published by Japan Plant Protection Association).<br>
Rice blast is the most serious disease involved in paddy rice cultivation. Rice blast is a plant disease induced by parasitism of fungi of the genus Pyricularia which are a kind of mold fungi and belong to deuteromycetes. Up to now, many excellent control agents and methods for rice blast have been reported.<br>
In some cases, however, even after the application of such control agents, an outbreak of rice blast takes place under certain meteorological conditions, such as unseasonably cool summer weather and very long rainy seasons, and due to unfavorable cultivation conditions, such as unsatisfactory management of seedlings and fertilizing. For these reasons, the development of control agents having better control effect against rice<br>
The present invention relates to a fungicidal composition.<br>

(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein<br>
R represents a hydrogen atom; -COR1 or -COOR1, wherein R1 represents an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms; -COCH2OCH3; or -COCH2OCOCH3. In this publication, the physicochemical properties of the above compounds and control effect of the above compounds against rice blast are also described. Furthermore, the publication describes that the above compounds are excellent in therapeutic effect against rice blast, as well as in residual activity and prophylactic effect, and that these effects are different from the therapeutic effect of conventional rice blast control agents.<br>
The mechanism of action of the compounds represented by formula (1) has not been fully elucidated<br>
blast has been desired. Further, a recent increase in the number of farmers with a side job and an increase in the number of aged people engaging in agriculture have led to a demand for the development of a technique that can extend a period during which disease control can be carried out, and can reduce the number of applications and amount of labor. Furthermore, the development of chemical agents, which can exhibit control effect simultaneously against a plurality of diseases, has been desired from the viewpoints of labor saving and a reduction in amount of an agricultural chemical to be applied.<br>
[SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION]<br>
As a result of evaluation of overall effect of the above-described plurality of activities, duration time of these activities, etc., the present inventors have now found that a mixture composition comprising a compound represented by formula (1) (2,3-dimethyl-6-t-butyl-8-fluoro-4-quinolinol derivative) and at least one compound selected from the group consisting of strobilurin fungicides does not sacrifice the activity of each ingredient and, at the same time, develops synergistic effect and exhibits excellent^ control effect against rice blast. Further, in this connection, it has been found that the above composition has excellent control effect against rice blast, a representative disease of paddy rice, at low dose for a long period of time, when the composition has been applied at proper timing, as well as when the application time has been delayed past the proper timing. The present invention has been made based on such finding.<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a chemical agent which has excellent control effect against diseases of paddy rice and has excellent control effect at low dose for a long period of time<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
even when the application time has been delayed from proper application timing.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a fungicidal composition comprising as active ingredients<br>
a compound of formula (1) or an acid addition salt thereof:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein<br>
R represents a hydrogen atom; -COR1 or -COOR1, wherein R1 represents an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms; -COCH2OCH3; or -COCH2OCOCH3, and<br>
at least one compound selected from the group consisting of strobilurin fungicides.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for controlling a disease of rice, comprising the step of applying an effective amount of the above fungicidal composition to an area to be treated.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided use of the above fungicidal composition, for the production of a control agent for a disease of paddy rice.<br>
The fungicidal composition according to the present invention comprises a mixture of two compounds different from each other in mechanism of action and fungicidal spectrum. The fungicidal composition according to the present invention has excellent control effect against rice blast, as well as against other fungal diseases of paddy rice, for example, sheath blast, ear burn due to Helminthosporium leaf spot, Cercospora leaf spot or the<br>
like, dicoloration of grains of rice caused, for example, by the genus Curvularia and the genus Alternaria, and false smut.  According to the fungicidal composition of the present invention, the ingredients in the fungicidal composition act together in a synergistic fashion to provide  unexpected  and  significant  control  effect. Therefore, according to the fungicidal composition of the   present   invention,   the   necessary   chemical application rate per area can be reduced.  In addition, according to the fungicidal composition of the present invention, excellent control effect can be attained at a lower dose compared with using each ingredient of the composition separately.   Further,  in this case,  the control effect is durable for a long period of time. Therefore, according to the fungicidal composition of the  present  invention,   the  necessary  number  of treatments of plants can be reduced.  Further, the total amount of the chemical agent used for a target plant during the cultivation period can be reduced.   The fungicidal   composition  according   to   the  present invention can exhibit excellent control effect when the composition has been applied for control treatment at proper timing, and even when the application time has been delayed past the proper timing.   The fungicidal composition  according  to  the present  invention  can realize  simultaneous  control  against a plurality of diseases and, at the same time, can reduce the risk of the development of resistance of fungi.  The fungicidal composition according to the present invention can be expected  to  greatly  contribute  to  labor-saving  in agriculture, environmental protection, and stable food production.<br>

The total amount of the active ingredients may be properly selected by taking into consideration formulation, application method, service environment, and other conditions of the fungicidal composition. For example, when the fungicidal composition is in a wettable powder form, the total amount of the active ingredients is 5 to 50% by weight, preferably 10 to 30% by weight. On the other hand, when the fungicidal composition is in a dust form, the total amount of the<br>
active ingredients is 0.5 to 5.0% by weight, preferably 1.0 to 2.0% by weight.<br>
In the fungicidal composition according to the present invention, the mixing ratio between the compound of formula (1) or an acid addition salt thereof and at least one compound selected from the group consisting of strobilurin fungicides is in the range of 1 : 100 to 100 : 1, preferably in the range of 1 : 20 to 20 : 1.<br>
When the fungicidal composition according to the present invention is used, the fungicidal composition as such may be used directly. If necessary, the fungicidal composition may be diluted with a diluting liquid, such as water, followed by treatment, for example, application to an area to be treated, admixing into the area to be treated, application to water surface in the area to be treated, or immersion in the area to be treated. Specific examples of the treatment include application to plant per se (application to stems and leaves), application to raising seedling boxes, application to soil (admixing with soil or application to side stripes) , application to field water (application to water surface or application to regular paddy field), and application to seeds (seed treatment).<br>
According  to  another  aspect  of  the  present invention, there is provided a method for controlling a disease of rice,  comprising the step of applying an effective amount of the fungicidal composition according to the present invention to an area to be treated.  The term "area to be treated" refers to an area which should be treated with the fungicidal composition according to the present invention for rice disease control purposes. Examples of such areas include rice plants,  raising seedling  boxes,   soils,  field  water,  and  seeds. Preferably, the area to be treated is rice plant, soil, or field water.<br>
The amount of the fungicidal composition according<br>
to the present invention used may be properly varied depending upon service environment, growth state of object plants, mixing ratio of active ingredients, formulations, application time, application method, and target disease to be controlled. In general, the amount of the fungicidal composition used is 1 to 1,500 g, preferably 10 to 150 g, per 10 ares in terms of the total amount of the active ingredients. For example, when the fungicidal composition is applied to a rice plant, the amount of the fungicidal composition used is 5 to 500 g, preferably 10 to 100 g, per 10 ares in terms of the total amount of the active ingredients.<br>
The fungicidal composition according to the present invention may be used as a mixture, for example, with other fungicides, insecticides, miticides, herbicides, plant growth-regulating agents, or fertilizers.<br>
In general, the fungicidal composition according to the present invention is previously formed into a desired formulation in the above-described manner.

Evaluation tests<br>
Test A:  Control  effect against  rice blast by<br>
application before spread of rice blast (test in<br>
suitable timing for control)<br>
A potting compost was placed in a plastic vat (about  30  cm  x  50  cm) ,  and  seed  rice  (variety: Koshihikari) after forcing of germination was inoculated into the vat, followed by dense planting cultivation. This rice was used for the test.<br>
The rice was raised for about 2 weeks in a glass greenhouse under conditions of 25°C in the daytime and 20°C in the night-time. At the time when the rice was grown to a three or four leaf stage, diseased leaves, which had been previously inoculated with rice blast fungi (race 037) and had developed rice blast, were placed on the densely planted rice, followed by standing under humidified conditions for inoculation of rice blast fungi for 24 hr. The rice plant was then again returned to within the glass greenhouse. Seven or eight days after that, the presence of lesions was observed, followed by first chemical application. In this case, a test chemical liquid was diluted with a 10% aqueous acetone  solution  (with  5,000-fold diluted Neoesterin<br>
 (tradename; manufactured by KUMIAI CHEMICAL INDUSTRY CO., LTD.) as a spreader added thereto) to predetermined concentrations. Each of the test chemical liquids thus prepared was applied in an amount of 15 ml per vat by means of a spray gun. When second chemical application is carried out, six or seven days after the first chemical application, the second chemical application was carried out in the same manner as in the first chemical application.<br>
After the chemical application, the rice was controlled in the glass greenhouse. During this period, at one to two days intervals, the rice was placed under humidified conditions for 24 hr to accelerate the development and spread of rice blast.<br>
Ten days after the final chemical application, for 40 plants per vat, the lesion area of the surface of a blade located one leaf below the uppermost leaf was observed, and the percentage lesion area in the treated plot was determined. The percentage lesion area in the nontreated plot was also determined in the same manner as in the treated plot. For each test chemical agent, the protective value was determined from the results obtained on the treated plot and the results obtained on the nontreated plot by the following equation.<br>
Protective value = [1 - (percentage lesion area in treated plot/percentage lesion area in nontreated plot)] x 100<br>
The prophylactic effect and residual effect of the test chemical agent can be determined by a method in which, after the elapse of predetermined days after the treatment with the chemical agent, observation is made on whether or not the percentage lesion area is increased. Accordingly, the prophylactic effect and residual effect were determined based on whether or not the final protective value was increased.<br>
The test was carried out for each group consisting<br>
of chemical agents indicated in Tables Al to A3 below. The chemical application was carried out once or twice. The results were as shown in Tables Al to A3.<br>

Test B:  Control effect against rice blast by<br>
application after spread of rice blast (application<br>
delay test)<br>
A potting compost was placed in a plastic vat (about  30  cm x  50  cm) ,  and  seed  rice  (variety: Koshihikari) after forcing of germination was inoculated into the vat, followed by dense planting cultivation. This rice was used for the test.<br>
The rice was raised for about 2 weeks in a glass greenhouse under conditions of 25°C in the daytime and 20°C in the night-time. At the time when the rice was grown to a three or four leaf stage, diseased leaves, which had been previously inoculated with rice blast fungi (race 037) and had developed rice blast, were placed on the densely planted rice, followed by standing under humidified conditions for inoculation of rice blast fungi for 24 hr. The rice plant was then again returned to within the glass greenhouse. Seven or eight days after that, the presence of lesions was observed. Thereafter, the rice was again placed under humidified conditions for 24 hr to accelerate the second infection and to spread rice blast in the vat. After the elapse of about three or four days after the acceleration of the spread of rice blast, very small secondary lesion was confirmed, followed by the first chemical application.<br>
The other test conditions, for example, test chemical liquid conditions, application method, application intervals, rice blast development and control method after the initiation of the application, calculation of percentage lesion area, and calculation of protective value, were the same as those in test A. When the second chemical application was carried out, the chemical application intervals were the same as those in test A.<br>
The test was carried out for each group consisting of chemical agents indicated in Tables Bl to B4 below.<br>
The results were as shown in Tables Bl to B4.<br>
