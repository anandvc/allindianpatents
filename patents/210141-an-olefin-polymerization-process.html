BRIDGED METAL COMPLEXES<br>
This invention relates to certain bridged Group 4 transition metal complexes possessing a unique bridging structure and to olefin polymerization catalysts obtained from such complexes. In one form, this invention embodies Group 4 transition metal complexes containing a unique bridged, or divalent ligand structure having two anionic, deiocalized n-bonded ligands attached thereto. In a second embodiment the invention relates to Group 4 transition metal complexes containing a unique bridged ligand containing one of the foregoing anionic, deiocalized n-bonded moieties and one anionic amido or phosphide moiety. In a third embodiment the invention relates to Group 4 transition metal complexes containing a unique bridged ligand containing two anionic amido and/ or phosphide groups. In all cases the unique bridge consists of either boron or aluminum atoms which are further ligated with nitrogen containing groups.  .<br>
In Anew. Chem. Int. Ed. End.. 36. 21, p2338-2340 (1997) and in Phosphoms. Sulfur, and Silicon, 124 &amp; 125, p561-565 (1997) amido substituted boron bridged ferrocenophanes useful for fuming poly(ferrocenes) by a ring opening polymerization were disclosed. The synthesis and characterization of Group 1 and 2 metal and tin complexes of 1,2-bis(dimethylamino)-1,2-di-9-fluorenyldiboranes were disclosed in Chem. Ber.. 127, p1901-1908. (1994), Diboranes having structure similar to those employed in the foregoing study were disclosed by the same researchers in Eur. J. Indoor. Chem., p505-509 (1998). Fen'ocenophane derivatives of similar misbrands for further molecular property studies were disclosed by J’ Roanoke. Chem., 530 pi 17-120 (1997). In Oraanometallics, 16, p4546-4550 (1997) boron bridged anta metallocenes complexes including dimethylsulfide and phosphine adducts thereof of possible use in Ziegler-Natta-type olefin polymerizations were disclosed. Non-bridged metallocenes such as 1-t-butyl-4,4,bis(Ti’-cyclopentadienyl)-2-(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidino)-1-aza-2-bora-4-titana-cyclobutane are disclosed in Chem. Ber. (1987), 120(5), 863-5.<br>
In the patent literature, bridged metal complexes for use as olefin polymerization catalyst components, including such complexes containing one or more boron atoms in the bridge are generically disclosed by EP-A-416,815 and WO 98/39369.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 are the crystal structures (ORTEP) of the compounds of Examples 2 and 5 respectively.<br><br>
The present invention relates to certain bridged Group 4 transition metal complexes and to olefin polymerization catalysts obtained from such, said complexes coH'esponding to the following formulas:<br><br><br><br><br>
wherein Z, T, R’ and R’ are as defined above;<br>
Y’ and Y’' are an anionic, cyclic or non-cyclic, Tc-bonded group. NR\ or PR’ and<br>
R"* is hydrogen or a trimethylsilyl group. Such ligand groups of Formula 1A or<br>
2A are readily prepared by contacting sources of the anionic groups (Y’'R’)" and<br>
(Y’'R"*)', particularly the Grignard or alkali metal salts thereof, with the neutral compound TZY’ or (TZ)2Y’2, where Y’ is a leaving group, especially halide, either as neat reagents or in an inert solvent, employing temperatures from -100 ‘C to 150 -C. Additionally, according to the present invention there is provided a process for preparing complexes of formula 1 and formula 2 in high racemic purity in the +2 formal oxidation state by contacting ligand structures of formula 1A or 2A where R"* is trimethylsilyl, or deprotonated diamines derivatives of ligand structures of formula 1A or formula 2A, with a Group 4 precursor of the formula 3:<br>
wherein M and Y’ are defined as above,<br>
R’ independently each occurrence is hydrogen, a hydrocarbyl group, a tri(hydrocart3yl)silyl group, or a tri(hydrocarbyl)silylhydrocariDyl group, said Regroups containing up to 20 atoms not counting hydrogen; and<br>
LB is a Lewis base, especially an ether, amine, or phosphine of up to 20 cartons.<br>
The reaction is desirably conducted in an inert solvent, especially an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocardon or ether, employing temperatures from -100 ‘c to 150 ‘C. This technique is similar to that disclosed in United States patent application 265,641, filed March 10,1999. differing in that different starting reagents are employed.<br>
Further according to the present invention there are provided catalyst compositions suitable for the polymerization of addition polymerisable monomers<br><br>
comprising one or more metal complexes of formulae 1 or 2 in combination with one or more activating cocatalysts or activated by use of an activating technique. Finally, according to the present invention there is also provided a polymerization process comprising contacting one or more addition polymerisable monomers with a catalyst composition comprising one or more metal complexes of formula 1 or 2 in combination with one or more activating cocatalysts or activated by use of an activating technique. The polymerization is preferably performed under solution, slurry, suspension, or high pressure process conditions, and the catalyst composition or individual components thereof may be used in a heterogeneous state, that is, a supported state or in a homogeneous state as dictated by process conditions. The catalysts of the present invention can be used in combination with one or more additional catalysts of the same or different nature either simultaneously or sequentially in the same or in separate reactors-Catalyst compositions according to the present invention possess improved catalytic efficiencies and improved thermal stability allowing for use under higher operating temperatures compared to catalysts comprising conventional metal complexes.<br>
All references to the Periodic Table of the Ele’nents herein shall refer to the Periodic Table of the Elements, published and copyrighted by CRC Press, Inc., 1997. Also, any references to a Group or Groups shall be to the Groups or Groups reflected in this Periodic Table of the Elements using the lUPAC system for numbering groups. By the term Vbonded" as used herein is meant that bonding occurs through an interaction involving delocalized electrons. Finally, by the term, "leaving group" is meant a ligand that is readily displaced by another ligand under ligand exchange conditions.<br>
The present Group 4 transition metal complexes contain a unique bridging group: (T-Z) or (T-Z)2. which imparts improved catalytic properties when used in combination with one or more activating cocatalysts or activating techniques in the presence of addition polymerisable monomers. While not desiring to be bound by theory, it is believed that the improvement in catalytic properties for such complexes may be due to the electronic properties of the ZT, Y’ and Y’ moieties.<br>

In general the complexes of the current invention can be prepared by first converting the ligands represented in formulas la and 2a to a dianionic salt (where R'* is H) via reaction within a metal amide such as sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide or lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide. The dianionic ligand derivative is then reacted with a metal complex precursor such as MY’, MY’a. or MY’a (and the corresponding Lev’s base adducts). where Y’ is defined as above. Alternatively, reactions employing the neutral ligand, where R** is hydrogen, in combination with the metal precursors M(NR’2)4 or MR’4 can be employed. (Preparation of the ligands of formula 2a where Y’ and Y’ are each an NR’ group can be readily accomplished by contacting a diboron tatrahydrocarbyloxide compound of the formula ((R’O)2B)2, where R'‘ is C1-10 hydrocarbyl, or two R’ groups together are C2.20 dihydrocarbyl, especially bis(catecholato)diboron with an alkali metal Ci’ dihydrocarbylamide, especially lithium dimethylamide.) All of the foregoing reactions are conducted in an inert solvent such as a hydrocarbon solvent or an etheral solvent in the temperature range of-100 2Cto150 2C.<br>
An especially useful metal complex precursor reagent corresponds to the formula 3:<br><br><br>
defined and Y’ each occurrence is chloride. Employment of this precursor in the reaction with ligands of this invention renders the resulting metal complex in high racemic purity, which is especially useful in the stereospecific polymerization of a-olefins.<br>
Alternatively, where R'* in structures of formula 1a and 2a Is a trimethylsilyl group the ligand can be reacted directly with any of the above metal complex precursors of formula 3, employing similar reaction conditions.<br>
The recovery of the desired Group 4 transition metal complex is accomplished by separation of the product from any alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts and devolatilization of the reaction medium. Extraction into a secondary solvent may be employed if desired. Alternatively, if the desired product is an insoluble precipitate, filtratiori or other separation techniques may be employed. Final purification, if required, may be accomplished by recrystallization from an inert solvent, employing low temperatures if needed.<br>
The complexes are rendered catalytically active by combination with acitvating cocatalysts or use of activating techniques that are previously known in the art for use with Group 4 metal olefin polymerization complexes.

Suitable ion forming compounds useful as cocatalysts in one embodiment of the present invention comprise a cation which is a Bronsted acid capable of donating a proton, and a compatible, noncoordinating anion, A'. As used herein, the term "noncoordinating" means an anion or substance which either does not coordinate to the Group 4 metal containing precursor complex and the catalytic derivative derived therefrom, or which is only weakly coordinated to such complexes thereby remaining sufficiently labile to be displaced by a neutral Lewis base. A noncoordinating anion specifically refers to an anion which when functioning as a charge balancing anion in a cationic metal complex does not transfer an anionic substituent or fragment thereof to said cation thereby forming neutral complexes. "Compatible anions" are anions which are not degraded to neutrality when the initially formed complex decomposes and are noninterfering with desired subsequent polymerization or other uses of the complex.<br>
Preferred anions are those containing a single coordination complex comprising a charge-bearing metal or metalloid core which anion is capable of balancing the charge of the active catalyst species (the metal cation) which may be formed when the two components are combined.

The technique of bulk electrolysis involves the electrochemical oxidation of the metal complex under electrolysis conditions in the presence of a supporting electrolyte comprising a noncoordinating, inert anion. In the technique, solvents, supporting electrolytes and electrolytic potentials for the electrolysis are used such that electrolysis byproducts that would render the metal complex catalytically inactive are not substantially formed during the reaction. More particularly, suitable solvents are materials that are: liquids under the conditions of the electrolysis (generally temperatures from 0 to lOCC), capable of dissolving the supporting electrolyte, and inert. Inert solvents" are those that are not reduced or oxidized under the reaction conditions employed for the electrolysis. It is generally possible in view of the desired electrolysis reaction to choose a solvent and a supporting electrolyte that are unaffected by the electrical potential used for the desired electrolysis. Preferred solvents include difluorobenzene (all isomers), dimethoxyethane (DME), and mixtures thereof.<br>
The electrolysis may be conducted in a standard electrolytic cell containing an anode and cathode (also referred to as the working electrode and counter electrode respectively). Suitable materials of construction for the cell are glass, plastic, ceramic and glass coated metal. The electrodes are prepared from inert conductive materials, by which are meant conductive materials that are unaffected by the reaction mixture or reaction conditions. Platinum or palladium are preferred inert conductive materials. Normally an ion permeable membrane such as a fine glass frit separates the cell into separate compartments, the wording electrode compartment and counter electrode compartment. The working electrode is immersed in a reaction medium comprising the metal complex to be activated, solvent, supporting electrolyte, and any other materials desired for moderating the electrolysis or stabilizing the resulting complex. The counter electrode is immersed in a mixture of the solvent and supporting electrolyte. The desired voltage may be determined by theoretical calculations or experimentally by sweeping the cell using a reference electrode such as a silver electrode immersed in the cell electrolyte. The background cell cun’ent, the current<br><br>
draw in the absence of the desired electrolysis, is also determined. The electrolysis is completed when the consent drops from the desired level to the background level. In this manner, complete conversion of the initial metal complex can be easily detected.<br>
Suitable supporting electrolytes are salts comprising a cation and a compatible, noncoordinating anion, A-. Preferred supporting electrolytes are salts corresponding to the formula G’A*; wherein:<br>
G* is a cation which is nonreactive towards the starting and resulting complex, and<br>
A' is as previously defined.<br>
Examples of cations, G*, include tetrahydrocarbyl substituted ammonium or phosphonium cations having up to 40 nonhydrogen atoms. Preferred cations are the tetra(n-butylammonium)- and tetraethylammonium- cations.<br>
During activation of the complexes of the present invention by bulk electrolysis the cation of the supporting electrolyte passes to the counter electrode and A-migrates to the working electrode to become the anion of the resulting oxidized product. Either the solvent or the cation of the supporting electrolyte is reduced at the counter electrode in equal molar quantity with the amount of oxidized metal complex formed at the working electrode. Preferred supporting electrolytes are tetrahydrocarbylammonium salts of tetrakis(perfluoroafyl) borates having from 1 to 10 carbons in each hydrocarbyl or perfluoroaryl group, especially tetra(n-butylammonium)tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) borate.<br>
A further recently discovered electrochemical technique for generation of activating cocatalysts is the electrolysis of a disilane compound in tithe presence of a source of a noncoordinating compatible anion. This technique is more fully disclosed and claimed in the previously mentioned United States Patent application serial number 304,314, published in equivalent form as WO96/08519.<br>
The foregoing electrochemical activating technique and activating cocatalysts may also be used in combination. An especially preferred combination is a mixture of a tri(hydrocartDyl)aluminum ortri(hydrocartDyl)borane compound having from 1 to 4 cations in each hydrocarbyl group with an oligomeric or polymeric alumoxane compound.<br>
The molar ratio of catalyst/cocatalyst employed preferably ranges from 1:10,000 to 100:1. more preferably from 1:5000 to 10:1, most preferably from 1:1000 to 1:1. Alumoxane, when used by itself as an activating cocatalyst. is employed in large quantity, generally at least 100 times the quantity of metal complex on a molar<br><br>
basis. Tris(pentafiuorophenyl)borane, where used as an activating cocatalyst is employed in a molar ratio to the metal complex of foci 0.5:1 to 10:1, more preferably from 1:1 to 6:1 most preferably from 1:1 to 5:1. The remaining activating cocataiysts are generally employed in approximately equimolar quantity with the metal complex. The catalysts, whether or not supported in any of the foregoing methods, may be used to polymerize ethylenically and/or acetylenically unsaturated monomers having from 2 to 100,000 carbon atoms either alone or in combination. Preferred monomers include the C2-20 a-olefins especially ethylene, propylene, isobutylene, 1-<br>
butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 3-methyl-1-pentene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 1-octene, 1-decene, long chain macromolecular a-olefins, and mixtures thereof. Other preferred monomers include styrene. C1-4 alkyl substituted styrene, tetrafluoroethylene,<br>
vinylbenzocyclobutane, ethylidenenorbomene, 1,4-hexadiene, 1.7-octadiene, vinylcyclohexane, 4-vinylcyclohexene, divinylbenzene, and mixtures thereof with ethylene. Long chain macromolecular a-olefins are vinyl terminated polymeric remnants formed in situ during continuous solution polymerization reactions. Under suitable processing conditions such long chain macromolecular units are readily polymerized into the polymer product along with ethylene and other short chain olefin monomers to give small quantities of long chain branching in the resulting polymer.<br>
Preferred monomers include a combination of ethylene and one or more comonomers selected from monovinyl aromatic monomers, 4-vinyicyclohexene, vinylcyclohexane, norbomadiene, ethylidene-nort3omene, C3-10 aliphatic a-olefins<br>
(especially propylene, isobutylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 3-methyl-1-pentene, 4-methyI-1-pentene, and 1-octene), and 04,40 dienes. Most preferred monomers are<br>
mixtures of ethylene and styrene; mixtures of ethylene, propylene and styrene; mixtures of ethylene, styrene and a nonconjugated diene, especially ethylidenenoriDomene or 1,4-hexadiene, and mixtures of ethylene, propylene and a nonconjugated diene, especially ethylidenenorbomene or 1,4-hexadiene.<br>
In general, the polymerization may be accomplished at conditions well known in the prior art for Ziegler-Natta or Kaminski-Sinn type polymerization reactions, that is, temperatures from 0-250**C, preferably 30 to 200'O and pressures from atmospheric to 10,000 atmospheres. Suspension, solution, slurry, gas phase, solid state powder polymerization or other process condition may be employed if desired. A support, especially silica, alumina, or a polymer (especially poly(tetrafluoroethylene) or a poiyolefin) may be employed, and desirably is employed when the catalysts are used in a gas phase polymerization process. The support is<br><br>
preferably employed in an amount to provide a weight ratio of catalyst (based on metal):support from 1:100,000 to 1:10, more preferably from 1:50,000 to 1:20, and most preferably from 1:10,000 to 1:30,<br>
In most polymerization reactions the molar ratio of catalyst:polymerizable compounds employed is from 10"‘‘:1 to 10'‘1, more preferably from 10'®:1 to 10"‘:1.<br>
Suitable solvents use for solution polymerization are inert liquids. Examples include straight and branched-chain hydrocartDons such as isobutane, butane, pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, and mixtures thereof; cyclic and alicyclic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane, cycloheptane, methylcyclohexane, methylcycloheptane, and mixtures thereof; perfluorinated hydrocarbons such as perfluorinated C4.-10 alkanes, and alkyl-substituted aromatic compounds such as<br>
benzene, toluene, xylene, and ethylbenzene. Suitable solvents also include liquid olefins which may act as monomers or comonomers.<br>
The catalysts may be utilized in combination with at least one additional homogeneous or heterogeneous polymerization catalyst in the same reactor or in separate reactors connected in series or in parallel to prepare polymer blends having desirable properties. An example of such a process is disclosed in WO 94/00500, equivalent to U. S. Serial Number 07/904,770. as well as U. S. Serial Number 08/10958, filed January 29,1993.<br>
Utilizing the present catalysts, a-olefin homopolymers and copolymers having densities from 0,85 g/cm’ to 0.96 g/cm’ and melt flow rates from 0.001 to 1000.0 dg/min are readily attained in a highly efficient process.<br>
The catalysts of the present invention are particularity advantageous for the production of ethylene homopolymers and ethylene/a-olefin copolymers having high levels of long chain branching. The use of the catalysts of the present invention in continuous polymerization processes, especially continuous, solution polymerization processes, allows tore elevated reactor temperatures which favor the foliation of vinyl terminated polymer chains that may be incorporated into a growing polymer, thereby giving a long chain branch. The use of the present catalyst compositions advantageously allows for the economical production of ethylene/a-olefin copolymers having processability similar to high pressure, free radical produced low density polyethylene.<br>
The present catalyst compositions may be advantageously employed to prepare olefin polymers having improved processing properties by polymerizing ethylene alone or ethylene/a-olefin mixtures with low levels of a "H" branch inducing<br><br>
diene. such as norbomadiene, 1,7-octadiene, or 1,9-decadiene. The unique combination of elevated reactor temperatures, high molecular weight (or low melt indices) at high reactor temperatures and high comonomer reactivity advantageously allows for the economical production of polymers having excellent physical properties and processability. Preferably such polymers comprise ethylene, a €3,20 <x-olefin></x-olefin>
and a "H""branching comonomer. Preferably, such polymers are produced in a solution process, most preferably a continuous solution process.<br>
The catalyst composition may be prepared as a homogeneous catalyst by addition of the requisite components to a solvent or diluent in which polymerization will be conducted. The catalyst composition may also be prepared and employed as a heterogeneous catalyst by adsorbing, depositing or chemically attaching the requisite components on an inert inorganic or organic particulates solid. Examples of such solids include, silica, silica gel, alumina, clays, expanded clays (aerogels), aluminosilicates, trialkylaluminum compounds, and organic or inorganic polymeric materials, especially polyolefins. In an prefen-ed embodiment, a heterogeneous catalyst is prepared by reacting an inorganic compound, preferably a tri(Ci’ alkyl aluminum compound, with an activating cocatalyst. especially an ammonium salt of a hydroxyaryl(trispentafluoro-phenyl)borate, such as an ammonium salt of (4-hydroxy-3,5-ditertiarybutylphenyl)tris-(pentafluorophenyl)borateor(4-hydroxyphenyl)-tris(pentafluorophenyl)borate. This activating cocatalyst is deposited onto the support by coprecipitating, imbibing, spraying, or similar technique, and thereafter removing any solvent or diluent. The metal complex is added to the support, also by adsorb  depositing or chemically attaching the same to the support, either subsequently, simultaneously or prior to addition of the activating cocatalyst.<br>
When prepared in heterogeneous or supported form, the catalyst composition is employed in a slurry or gas phase polymerization. As a practical limitation, slurry polymerization takes place in liquid diluents in which the polymer product is substantially insoluble. Preferably, the diluent for slurry polymerization is one or more hydrocarbons with less than 5 cardoon atoms. If desired, saturated hydrocardon such as ethane, propane or butane may be used in whole or part as the diluent. Likewise the a-olefin monomer or a mixture of different a-olefin monomers may be used in whole or part as the diluent. Most preferably at least a major part of the diluent comprises the a-olefin monomer or monomers to be polymerized.<br>
At all times, the individual ingredients as well as the recovered catalyst components must be protected from oxygen and moisture. Therefore, the catalyst<br><br>
components and catalysts must be prepared and recovered in an oxygen and moisture free atmosphere. Preferably, therefore, the reactions are performed in the presence of an dry, inert gas such as, for example, nitrogen.<br>
The polymerization may be carried out as a batch wise or a continuous polymerization process A continuous process is prefemed, in which event catalyst, ethylene, comonomer, and optionally solvent are continuously supplied to the reaction zone and polymer product continuously removed therefrom.<br>
Without limiting in any way the scope of the invention, one means for carrying out such a polymerization process is as follows: In a stirred-tank reactor, the monomers to be polymerized are introduced continuously together with solvent and an optional chain transfer agent. The reactor contains a liquid phase composed substantially of monomers together with any solvent or additional diluent and dissolved polymer. If desired, a small amount of a "H"-branch inducing diene such as norbomadiene, 1,7-octadiene or 1,9-decadiene may also be added. Catalyst and cocatalyst are continuously introduced in the reactor liquid phase. The reactor temperature and pressure may be controlled by adjusting the solvent/monomer ratio, the catalyst addition rate, as well as by cooling or heating coils, jackets or both. The polymerization rate is controlled by the rate of catalyst addition. The ethylene content of the polymer product is determined by the ratio of ethylene to comonomer in the reactor, which is controlled by manipulating the respective feed rates of these components to the reactor. The polymer product molecular weight is controlled, optionally, by controlling other polymerization variables such as free temperature, monomer concentration, or by the previously mention chain transfer agent, such as a stream of hydrogen introduced to the reactor, as is well known in the art. The reactor effluent is contacted with a catalyst kill agent such as water. The polymer solution is optionally heated, and the polymer product is recovered by flashing off gaseous monomers as well as residual solvent or diluent at reduced pressure, and, if necessary, conducting further devolatilization in equipment such as a devolatilizing extruder. In a continuous process the mean residence time of the catalyst and polymer in the reactor generally is from about 5 minutes to 8 hours, and preferably from 10 minutes to 6 hours. By using a catalyst that incorporates large amounts of hindered monovinyl monomer, hindered monovinyl homopolymer formed from residual quantities of the monomer are substantially reduced<br>
Ethylene homopolymers and ethylene/a-olefin copolymers are particularity suited for preparation according to the invention. Generally such polymers have densities from 0.88 to 0.96 g/mi. Typically the molar ratio of a-olefin comonomer to<br><br>
ethylene used in the polymerization may be varied in order to adjust the density of tie resulting polymer. When producing materials with a density range of from 0,91 to 0.93 the comonomer to monomer ratio is less than 0,2. preferably less than 0.05. even more preferably less than 0.02, and may even be less than 0.01. In the above polymerization process hydrogen has been found to effectively control the molecular weight of the resulting polymer. Typically, the molar ratio of hydrogen to monomer is less than about 0.5, preferably less than 0.2. more preferably less than 0.05, even more preferably less than 0,02 and may even be less than 0,01.

  /ac-aiisopropylamidoborane-bis-ri'-(2-methyl-4-phenylinden-1-yl)zirconium TI’-1 ,4-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene<br>
In a glass flask, 0.922 ml of a toluene solution of methylbis(octyl)ammonium hydroxyphenyltris(pentafluorophenyl)borate (amounting to 0.070 mmoles based on boron) and 0.110 ml of a 1.9 M toluene solution of triethyl aluminum (0.058 mmoles) were added along with 0.290 ml additional toluene. The mixture was stirred for 5 minutes on a mechanical shaker. About one half (0.550 ml) of the resulting solution was added to a flask containing 0.500 g of thoroughly dried silica (Grace-Davison 948 silica, heated 250 °C, 4 h). The mixture was shaken by hand to break-up clumps and then mechanically agitated for an additional 10 minutes. Next 8 ml of mixed hexanes was added to form a slunk, which was mechanically stirred for an additional 15 minutes. To this mixture, 3.5 ml of a 0.005 M toluene solution of rao-diisopropylamidoborane-bis-Ti’-(2-methyl-4-phenylinden-1 -yl)zirconium TI'‘-I ,4-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene (Example 14) was added. The mixture was agitated 2 h on the mechanical shaker, filtered on a glass frit, washed (3x) with 10 ml mixed hexanes and dried under reduced pressure.<br>
The resulting blue colored, dried, supported catalyst was analyzed by neutron activation for zirconium content and found to contain 31.8 female zirconium/g formulated supported catalyst.<br>
Solution Polvethvlene Polymerization<br>
Mixed hexanes and 1-octene were purified by sparging with purified nitrogen followed by passage through columns containing alumina (A-2, available from Larches Inc.) and Q5 reactant (available from Engelhard Chemicals Inc.) at 50 psig using a purified nitrogen pad. All transfers of solvents and solutions described below were accomplished using a gaseous pad of dry, purified nitrogen or argon. Gaseous feeds to the reactor were purified by passage through columns of A-204 alumina (available from Larches Inc.) and Q5 reactant. The alumina were previously activated by treatment at 375°C with nitrogen and Q5 reactant was activated by treatment at 200**C with 5 percent hydrogen in nitrogen.<br>
Batch reactor polymerizations were conducted in a two liter Parr reactor equipped with an electrical heating jacket, internal serpentine coil for cooling, and a bottom drain valve. Pressures, temperatures and block valves were computer monitored and controlled. Mixed alkanes solvent (about 740 g) and 1-octene (118 g) were measured in a solvent shot tank fitted with a differential pressure transducer or weigh cell. These liquids were then added to the reactor from the solvent shot tank.<br><br>
I ne contents of the reactor were stirred at 1200 rpm. Hydrogen was added by differential expansion (A 25 psi, 170 kPa) from a 75 ml shot tank initially at 300 psig (2.1 Mpa). The contents of the reactor was then heated to the desired run temperature under 500 psig (3.4 Mpa) of ethylene pressure. The catalyst composition (as a 0.0050 M solution in toluene) and cocatalyst were combined in the desired ratio in the glove box and transferred from the glove box to the catalyst shot tank through 1/16 in (0.16 cm) tubing using toluene to aid in the transfer. The catalyst tank was then pressurized to 700 psig (4.8 Mpa) using nitrogen. After the contents of the reactor had stabilized at the desired run temperature of 140°C, the catalyst was injected into the reactor via a dip tube. The temperature was maintained by allowing cold ethylene glycol to pass through the internal cooling coils. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 15 minutes with ethylene provided on demand. Additional injections of catalyst composition prepared and injected in the same manner were employed where indicated. The contents of the reactor were then expelled into a 4 liter nitrogen purged vessel and quenched with isopropyl alcohol. Approximately 10 ml of a toluene solution containing approximately 67 mg of a hindered phenol antioxidant (Irganox"   from Ciba Geigy Corporation) and 133 mg of a phosphorus stabilizer (Irgafos*’ 168 from Ciba Geigy Corporation) were added. Volatile materials were removed from the polymers in a vacuum oven that gradually heated the polymer to MO'‘C ovemight and cooled to at least 50**C prior to removal from the oven. After completion of the polymerizaiton, the reactor was washed with 1200 ml of mixed hexanes solvent at 150°C before reuse. Results are contained in Table 1.<br><br><br><br>

Solution PolvproDVlene Polymerization<br>
The above reaction conditions were substantially repeated excepting about 625 g of mixed alkanes solvent and either 150 g of propylene (P) for homopolymer formation, or a mixture of 150 g propylene and 7 g ethylene (E) for copolymer formation were used. Hydrogen was added as a molecular weight control agent by differential pressure expansion from a 75 ml addition tank at about 17-25 psi (120-170 kPa). The reactor was heated to the polymerization temperature and the desired metal complex along with a cocatalyst, as dilute solutions in toluene, were mixed at an appropriate molar ratio, transcended to a catalyst addition tank, and injected into the reactor (three injections of 1 ‘imole, 3 ‘amole and 5 ‘mole based on zirconium over about 30 minutes for run 16, two injections of 5 ‘imole based on zirconium over about 20 minutes for run 17, and a single addition for all other runs.

Slunk Polymerization<br>
The previous reaction conditions were substantially repeated excepting a supported catalyst was employed, the temperature was between 20-C and 60 -C, and no solvent was used. All feeds were passed through columns of alumina and a decontaminant (0-5"® catalyst available from Engelhard Chemicals Inc.) prior to<br><br>
introduction into the reactor. Catalyst and cocatalysts were handled in a glovebox containing an atmosphere of argon or nitrogen. A stirred 2.0 liter reactor was charged with about 500 g of propylene. Hydrogen was added by differential pressure expansion from a 75 ml addition tank at 40 psi (280 kPa). The reactor was adjusted to the initial polymerization temperature (25 -C) and a slunk of the supported catalyst composition (40 tag, 1.27 emote Zr) in mixed hexanes was injected into the reactor. The temperature was maintained at 25 -C for 20 minutes then increased to 60 -C over 6.5 minutes (2.8 minutes for run 33) and maintained at 60 -C for a total run time of 40 minutes.<br>
Upon completion, the reactor contents were removed and about 10 ml of a toluene solution containing approximately 67 mg of a hindered phenol antioxidant (Irganox™ 1010 from Ciba Geigy Corporation) and 133 mg of a phosphorus stabilizer (Irgafos"‘ 168 from Ciba Geigy Corporation) were added. The polymer was recovered by drying in a vacuum oven set at 140 °C for about 20 hours. Results are contained in Table 3.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
