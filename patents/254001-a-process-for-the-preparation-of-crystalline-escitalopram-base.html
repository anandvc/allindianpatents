				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF ESCITALOPRAM OR ITS ACID ADDITION SALTS<br>
Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates an improved process for the preparation of Escitalopram,   which   is   the   S-enantiomer   of well   known   antidepressant   drug Citalopram,    i.e.    (S)-l-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-l-(4-flouorphenyl)-l,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofuran carbonitrile or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Background of Invention<br>
Citalopram is a well-known antidepressant drug that has now been in the market for some years and has the following structure shown in figure 1:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
It is a selective centrally acting serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) reuptake inhibitor, accordingly having antidepressant activities.<br>
Citalopram was first disclosed in DE 2,657,013, corresponding to US 4,136,193. This patent publication outlines a process for preparation of Citalopram from the corresponding 5-bromo derivatives by reaction with cuprous cyanide in a suitable solvent. US'193 describes the C-alkylation reaction of 5-cyanophthalane with 3-N,N'-dimethylaminopropyl chloride using sodium hydride as a base in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) medium. 13 volumes of DMSO is used in this reaction with respect to 5-cyanophthalane. After the completion of the reaction Citalopram base is isolated as oil, which is purified by high vacuum distillation (0.03mm at 175-180°C) and then converted into acid addition salts by conventional methods. A main drawback of this process is the need to purify the oily Citalopram base using high vacuum distillation (0.03mm) at 175-180°C. Achieving such a high vacuum at plant level is difficult and apart from these constraints, the process has another drawback in that Citalopram base having a cyano group at the 5th position of the bicyclic ring system may  decompose  during  high  vacuum  distillation  at  high  temperature  to  form<br><br>
Citalopram carboxamide as one of the impurity, resulting in poor quality product and yield.<br>
Another drawback of US'193 is the use of 13 volumes of DMSO as a reaction<br>
medium for generation of sodium salt of DMSO (demsil ion). DMSO being a very<br>
polar solvent may result in the formation of impurities such as l-[3-<br>
(dimethylamino)propyl]-l-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-acetyl-l,3-dihydroisobenzofuran (acetyl<br>
Citalopram),	l-[3-(dimethylarnino)propyl]-l-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-acetyl-l,3-<br>
dihydroisobenzofuran     carboxamide     (amide),     l-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-l-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-acetyl-l,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carboxalic  acid  (acid)  and   l-[3-(methylamino)propyl]-l-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-acetyl-l,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile (desmethyl) are formed during the workup due to the degradation and decomposition of the reaction mass, resulting in poor quality of Citalopram.<br>
US Patent No.4,650,884 discloses diol of formula (II), 4-[4-(dimethylamino)-l-<br>
(4'-fluorophenyl)-l-hydroxy-l-butyl]-3-(3-hydroxy	methyl)-benzonitrile,	its<br>
preparation and use as an intermediate in the preparation of Citalopram. Further processes for the preparation of Citalopram by exchange of 5-halogen or CF3-(CF2)n-SO2-O-, n being 0-8, with cyano are disclosed in WO0011926 and WO0013648.<br>
Escitalopram, the pharmaceutical activity thereof and crystalline oxalate are disclosed in US Patent no. 4,943,590. Methods for the preparation of Escitalopram along with the disclosure of Escitalopram free base existing as an oil as well as the oxalic, pamoic and L-(+)-tartaric acid addition salts of Escitalopram are disclosed in US'590.<br>
In US'590, two routes are disclosed, both of them starting with racemic diol. In the first route (scheme 1) the diol is reacted with enantiomerically pure derivatives such as (+) or (-)-a-methoxy-a-trifluoromethylphenyl acetyl chloride to form a mixture of diastereomeric esters, which are separated by HPLC or fractional crystallization, where upon the ester with the right stereochemistry is enantioselectively converted into Escitalopram. In the second route the diol is separated into enantiomers by stereo selective crystallization with an enantiomerically pure acid such as (+)-di-p-toluoyltartaric acid, whereupon the S-enantiomer of the diol is enantioselectively converted to Escitalopram. Both of theses routes involve consumption of expensive, enantiomerically pure reagents, and give relatively low yields resulting in products which are economically infeasible for industrial production.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br><br>
Scheme-1<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
In WO 03/006449 process for the preparation of Escitalopram is disclosed. According to this publication the diol 4-[4-(dimethylamino)-l-(4'-fluorophenyl)-l-hydroxy-l-butyl]-3-(3-hydroxy methyl)-benzonitrile is separated into its enantiomers by chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. The obtained enantiomerically pure isomer can be transformed into Escitalopram by treating with p-toluene sulphonyl chloride in the presence of base such as triethylamine. This process requires additional chromatographic purification to get pure Escitalopram. The salt is subjected to crystallization in a solvent medium to get enantiomerically enriched crystalline form (scheme 2).<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
Scheme 2<br>
WO 03/087081 discloses the process in which the racemic diol intermediate is treated with optically active acid such as (+)-di-/?-toluoyl tartaric acid to form a diastereiomeric salt. It is subjected to enantiomeric selective cyclization to get 5-substituted Escitalopram, which is replacement of bromine by a nitrile group to get pure Escitalopram (scheme 3).<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br>
Scheme-3<br>
There is no method, which enables one, a priori; to forecast which solvent system is effective in separating a given pair of enantiomers in highly pure form and in high yields. Therefore there is a need to develop an improved process for Escitalopram production that can be employed commercially. Especially such an improved process would be welcome considering the difficulties associated with the commercial application of the above-mentioned processes for the preparation of Escitalopram. Keeping this aspect into consideration, we aimed to develop a simple and economical process for commercial production of Escitalopram.<br><br>
Objects of the invention<br>
It is, therefore, an important object of the present invention to provide an improved and economically feasible process for the preparation of Escitalopram upon limitations in the prior art.<br>

According to process of the present invention, racemic diol compound of formula III is treated with pure optically active acid in a mixture of solvents to get an enantiomerically pure diol of formula IIIA. The optically active acid used herein is selected from the group consisting of but not limited to tartaric acid, dibenzoyl tartaric acid, di-p-toluoyl tartaric acid, bis-napthyl phosphoric acid, and 10-camphor sulphonic acid preferably di-p-toluoyl tartatic acid. The reaction is carried out in a solvent selected from the group consisting of lower alcohol having 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol and butyl alcohol; acetonitrile; acetone or mixture thereof preferably in a mixture of methanol and isopropyl alcohol. The reaction is carried out firstly at a temperature of 40-60°C and then at a temperature of 20-25°C for a period of 6-24 hrs. The reaction mixture is then cooled to 0-5°C to get the solid material, which is separated by filtration to get a compound of formula IIIA with a chiral purity of greater than 99%.<br>
The compound of formula IIIA is optionally purified using a mixture of solvents to get the chiral purity in the range of 99.5-99.8%. The solvent used herein is selected from the group consisting of but not limited to methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl acetate and acetone or mixture thereof preferably methanol and isopropyl alcohol or methanol and ethanol. The purification is carried out by dissolving the compound of formula IIIA in a mixture of solvent at a temperature of 40-60°C and then cooled to 0-5°C. Solid material is filtered to get the compound of formula IIIA with a chiral purity in the range of 99.5-99.8%.<br>
The compound of formula IIIA is treated with base to get converted into a free diol (chirally pure), which is then subjected to stereo selective cyclization to get a compound of formula II i.e. Escitalopram base in chirally pure form with chiral purity greater than 99%.<br>
The enantiomerically pure optically active acid salt of diol is then converted to<br>
optically pure diol by treating with a base in presence of water or optionally in a<br>
mixture of water and water immiscible solvent. The base used herein is selected from<br>
the group consisting of organic and inorganic base. Organic base are selected from the<br>
group of triethyl amine whereas inorganic base are selected from the group of alkali<br>
metal carbonates, bicarbonates and their hydroxides and liquid ammonia. The reaction<br>
is carried out at a basic pH range of 7.0-9.0 preferably 8.0-8.5 and at a temperature<br>
range of 0°C to room temperature. The resulting solution is then extracted with water<br>
immiscible organic solvents to get the optically pure diol compound. The solvent used<br><br>
herein is selected from the group consisting of toluene, chloroform, dichloromethane and dichloroethane preferably dichloromethane. Optically pure diol as such i.e. without isolation, is further subjected to stereo selective cyclization by reacting with a methane sulphonyl chloride or p-toluene sulphonyl chloride in presence of triethyl amine and a solvent system i.e. dichloromethane. After completion of the reaction, liquor ammonia is added to the reaction mass and separated the layers. The organic layer is washed with water and extracted with 10-20% aqueous acid. The aqueous acid group is selected from the group consisting of hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid and acetic acid preferably acetic acid.

The solvent used herein is selected from the group consisting of methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, n-propanol, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, and dimethylsulfoxide preferably isopropyl alcohol. The pH of the resulting solution is adjusted to basic by employing base selected from sodium, potassium hydroxide, and ammonia solution. The preferred base employed to precipitate the Escitalopram base, is liquid ammonia. The reaction mass is cooled to 0-5°C and the solid is separated by filtration to get crystalline Escitalopram base with a chiral purity in the range of 99.5-99.8%.<br>
The crystalline Escitalopram base is then converted to its acid addition salts by reacting it with acid in presence of solvent. The solvent used herein is selected from the group consisting of methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran or mixtures thereof preferably isopropyl alcohol. The amount of acid used herein is 1.0 equivalent to the Escitalopram base. The acid used herein is selected from the group consisting of oxalic acid, hydrochloric acid, and hydrobromic acid, preferably oxalic acid. The reaction mixture is stirred for 2-10 hours at 20-25°C. The separated acid addition salts are filtered and washed with solvent to get pure Escitalopram acid addition salts.<br>
The Escitalopram acid addition salt is further purified by employing simple purification in a solvent. The solvent used herein for purification is selected from the group consisting of methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl acetate, acetone or mixtures thereof preferably mixture of methanol and ethyl acetate or methanol and isopropyl alcohol.<br>
The racemic diol of formula III is prepared according to the process already disclosed in prior art i.e. in WO2005077927.<br><br>
In conclusion, this is an improved, economical and a high yielding process for the industrial production of highly pure Escitalopram base as well as Escitalopram acid addition salts using novel solvent system.<br>
