				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a device for holding<br>
electrical heating element coils inside furnaces for annealing<br>
steel products.<br>
In most of the mini steel plants, annealing of steel<br>
products is performed in batch-type annealing furnaces which<br>
are lined internally with refractory bricks having sinusoidally<br>
curved grooves for fixing electrical heating element coils<br>
thereinto. The drawbacks of refractory brick lining and holding<br>
system of heating element coil in refractory having high thermal<br>
mass are s (a) a large amount of heat energy is absorbed in<br>
the bricks during heating, which is lost during cooling thereof,<br>
when the furnace is switched off and (b) time required for both<br>
heating and cooling of the furnace is too long, leading to<br>
increased idle time and hence loss in productivity of the furnat<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a device<br>
for holding electrical heating element coils inside ceramic fib<br>
lined annealing furnaces in replacement of the existing<br>
refractory brick works to reduce Toss of heat energy, and the<br>
time for heating and cooling of the furnaces.<br>
The invented device comprises basically a metallic<br>
socket which is welded to the inner surface of the furnace shell<br>
after removing the ceramic bricks therefrom, the socket having<br>
a cylindrical bore with threaded internal surface; a threaded<br>
metallic plug with a groove on its outer flat surface, which is<br>
fitted in the bore of the socket in the manner of fixing a bolt<br>
in a nut; a whistle shaped metallic pipe which is fitted on the<br>
outer flat surface of the plug by welding the narrow end of the<br>
pipe in the groove of the plug; a ceramic bush v/ith a hexagonal<br>
nut embedded therein, which is fitted inside the pipe; a metallic<br>
rod having a threaded end which is fitted in the hexagonal nut<br>
embedded in the ceramic bush and a flared end which is introduced<br>
into the central hole of a non-metallic bobbin on which the<br>
electrical heating element coils i.e. of super kanthal are wound<br>
in the space between the two flanges thereof at the required pitch<br>
i.e. 64 mm so that the heat generated in all the zones inside the<br>
furnaces is uniformly distributed, the furnaces being lined<br>
internally with ceramic fibre upto the end of the rod lying outsic<br>
the central hole of the bobbin.<br>
The invention is described fully and particularly<br>
without restricting its scope in any manner v/ith reference to<br>
the accompanying drawings in which -<br>
Figure 1 is a partly sectional elevation of the<br>
invented device.<br>
Figure 2 is a sectional view of the furnace.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, the device comprises a metallic<br>
socket 1 having a threaded bore 1a and being fixed to the inner<br>
wall 2 of furnace shell 3 by welding; a metallic plug 4 having<br>
a threaded round survace 4a and a flat surface 4b with a groove 5<br>
cut along a diameter thereof, fitted into the socket like a bolt<br>
in a screw; a whistle-shaped metallic pipe 7 having a narrov/er<br>
round end 6 which is fixed perpendicularly to the flat surface 4b<br>
of the plug 4 at the centre of the groove 5 by welding, a conical<br>
part 6a and a cylindrical wider part 7a; a non-metallic bush 8<br>
v/ith a hexagonal nut 9 embedded therein, fitted tightly in the<br>
conical and cylindrical parts of the pipe 7, being introduced<br>
through the open end 10 thereof; a round metallic rod 11 having<br>
a narrower threaded part 12 which is introduced into bush 8 from<br>
the open end 10 of pipe 7 and fixed therein by screwing into the<br>
hexagonal nut 9, and an unthreaded wider part 12a v/ith a flared<br>
end 13; and a non-metallic bobbin 16 having a narrower flange 17,<br>
a wider flange 18, a central bore 14 extended throughout the<br>
bobbin length and two slots 15, 15a cut on the wall of the central<br>
bore 14 in the diametrically opposite positions starting from the<br>
narrower flange 17 and extending upto the middle part of the<br>
bobbin length, into which the flared end 13 of the unthreaded wider<br>
part 12a of the rod 11 is introduced upto the middle part of the<br>
bobbin length and fixed in the central bore 14 by turning the<br>
bobbin 90° round the axis thereof, the space along the bobbin<br>
length lying between the narrower and wider flanges being provided<br>
for holding the super kanthal electrical heating element coils by<br>
winding therearound at a preferred pitch 64 mm for heating<br>
uniformly different zones inside the furnaces to a temperature of<br>
950°C in ambient atmosphere, without causing any adverse effect<br>
on the bush and bobbin.<br>
Typical dimensions and materials of the various<br>
components of the device are presented in Table I.<br>
The performance of a number of annealing furnaces<br>
fitted v/ith the invented device, instead of the conventional<br>
refractory bricks, for holding the electrical heating element<br>
coils has been studied over a period in a steel plant. The<br>
loss of heat energy in the furnace has been reduced by 25-30%.<br>
The time for heating and cooling of the furnaces has been also<br>
reduced appreciably with consequent reduction in the idle time<br>
of the furnace.<br>
