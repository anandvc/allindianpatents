				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention refers to pharmaceutical compositions comprising 3-aza-bicyclo[3.2.1]octane derivatives of general formula (I), their dimers of general formula (II) or (111) hereinafter reported, or mixtures thereof, useful in the treatment of pathologies in which the neurotrophine functions, particularly of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), are altered. State of the art<br>
Numerous proteins and polypeptide factors regulate cell growth and/or survival. The first of such factors which was identified and functionally characterised is NGF. Later on, other proteins belonging to the same NGF family were identified that exert their activity on different populations of nervous cells. All these proteins are collectively referred to as"neurotrophic".<br>
NGF, upon interaction with specific surface receptors, prevents neuronal cell death during embryonal development and throughout adult life, NGF administration was proven advantageous in pathological conditions, such as degenerative and ischaemic disorders of Central Nervous System (CNS), spinal lesions, and toxicity of excitory amino acids. In fact, together with other neurotrophic factors, NGF promotes neuronal regeneration and supports neuronal functions. Therapeutic uses of NGF have been limited by its poor ability to get across the blood-brain-barrier, partly due to the molecular size of the native factor. Thus, the development of non-peptidic compounds able to specifically mimic the activities of the natural ligand is a useful approach to obviate such limitations. Relevant examples of such compounds are: a) phorbol esters, that mimic NGF presumably by modifying PKCc activity; b) ganglioside and other unrelated lipidic compounds, that promote neuritic outgrowth from dorsal root ganglia, or other sympathetic, neurones; c) Triap (l,1,3-triciano-2-ammino-1-propene), a small compound able to support survival and induce neuritic growth in PC12 cells. In all of the above cases, activity of molecules is not mediated by interactions with NGF receptors. Development of new non-peptidic compounds able to interact with specific receptors, thus behaving as agonists or antagonists, of human neurotrophins is of utmost importance, since they may be used as drugs for treatment of disorders related to a defective or excessive activity of neurotrophins.<br><br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Now, the Applicants have unexpectedly found that 3-aza-bicyclo[3.2.1]octane derivatives of general formula (I) and their dimers of general formula (II) and (ill) as reported hereinafter, are active as agonists of human neurotrophines, therefore they are useful for preparation of pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of diseases in which the neurotrophine functions, particularly the NGF functions, are involved in defect.<br>

The compounds above cited are indeed already described in J. Org. Chem. 1999, 64, 7347, Organic Letters, 2000, 2, 3987-3990, Bioorganic &amp; Med Chem 2001, 9, 1625,-1632, Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2002, 873-880, and in the European Application Patent No. 00104135.9-2117 and in the International Application No. WO 01/64686; in such documents the preparation methods of the compounds are also described.<br>
The novel derivatives of 3-aza-bicyclo[3.2.1]octanes of general formula (I) and their dimers of general formula (II) and (III) may be prepared with the following process. The new compounds of general formula (I) and their correspondent dimers of formula (II) and (III), described for the first time in the present application may be prepared according the procedure described as following and represented in the following Scheme 1:<br><br><br>
Protected alpha amino aldehydes (3a) or alpha amino ketones (3b) or alpha amino alcohols (3c) were reacted with - activated derivatives of tartaric acid as for example diacetyloxytartaric anydride 4 (R,R o S,S)&gt; - or with acid tartaric derivatives as for example the protected mono-methylester 6 (R,R or S,S), in the presence of coupling and activating agents - or by reductive amination with protected derivatives of erithrolactole 5 (R, R prepared from D-arabinose or S,S prepared from L-arabinose). The correspondent amides 7 e 9 (in the scheme 1 are shown only the R, R enantiomers, but the enantiomers S,S were prepared analogously) or amine 8 (in the scheme 1 are shown only the R,S enantiomers, but the S,R enantiomers were prepared analogously). In the case of amide alcohol 9 the correspondent aldehyde or ketone 10 are obtained by oxidation. When R3 is H in the amine 8, a Fmoc protection can be made. The further cyclisation of compounds 7, 8 e 10 (Scheme 1) occurs by treatment with SOCfe and MeOH (reaction condition i) followed by treatment with sulfuric acid adsorbed on S1O2 in refluxing toluene (reaction conditions ii) or by treatment with trifluoro acetic acid (TFA) pure or in methylene chloride (reaction conditions iii). Thus, starting from amides 7 and  10, the compounds I wherein X = O and R6 = -COOMe in<br><br>
configuration exo were prepared. In the case of amine 8 compounds I, wherein X = H, H and the group R6 = -CH2OH in endo configuration were prepared. The configuration R,R or S,S of stereocenters at C-1 bridgehead and at C-7 (bearing the carboxylic or hydroxymethyl group) is depending from that of tartaric acid or from starting erithrolactole. The compounds I may be modified according to Scheme 2. Scheme 2<br><br>
The compounds of formula (I) (amide type), wherein X = O may be reduced, by using the complex BH3 dimethyl sulfide, either to correspondent amino esters I (X = H, H, R6 = COOMe), or to correspondent amino alcohol I (X=H, H e R6 = CH2OH). Such compounds may be deprotected to nitrogen atom. The hydrolysis of amino ester I (X = H, H, Re = COOMe) may be done either in acid or basic conditions, giving to the correspondent amino acid I (X = H, H, R6 = COOH). The amino acid is also obtained by Jones oxidation or by using PDC in DMF, from amino alcohol I (X=H, H e Re = CH2OH), also after the change of the benzyl group to Boc or Fmoc. By activation of the carboxylic group an amide bond with an amine NHR7R8 or an amino acid is formed. Otherwise, the activated carboxylic group of the amino acid I, is reacted with another unit of I having the deprotected nitrogen, to give the dimers of general formula (II) present in Table 3.<br><br>
Otherwise, two units of a compound of formula (I) in each form, is reacted with a spacer Q, to give the dimers of general formula (III). The example shown in the scheme 2 includes but is not limited to the reaction of a diamine (Q) with two units of an activated carboxylic acid to give dimers of formula (III) reported in Table 4 . The present 3-aza-bicyclo[3.2.1]octane derivatives of general formula (I) and their dimers of general formula (II) and (III), in free form or in form of pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts, may be used for preparation of pharmaceutical compositions following usual methods of pharmaceutical preparation.<br>
Such pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated in conventional way, and may include one or more eccipients and/or diluent pharmaceutical^ acceptable. Administration of such formulations is feasible through any conventional route, such as parenteral, in the form of solution or suspension, oral, ocular, nasal, topical, etc.<br>
The formulation of the 3-aza-bicyclo[3.2.1]octane derivatives of formula (I) and of their dimers of formula (II) and (III) according to the invention include tablets, capsules, pills, pellets, solutions, dispersions, suspensions, liposomal formulations, microspheres, nanospheres, creams and ointments, emulsions and aerosols, that can also be prepared in a way that allows a controlled or retarded release of the active compound.<br>
Such pharmaceutical compositions may comprise at least one among the present compounds of formula (I), (II) and (III), or mixtures thereof, as active principle, possibly even in combination with other active principle or co-adjuvant, selected according to the pathologic conditions.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds of the invention are suitable for pharmaceutical treatment of pathologic conditions related to the activity of neurotrophins.<br>
The present derivatives of 3-aza-bicyclo[3.2.1] octane derivatives of general formula (I) and their dimers of general formula (II) showed neurotrophin agonist activity, especially of NGF, as they have the property of interacting with the NGF receptor complex at defined affinity levels. The agonist compounds have the property of inducing the biological signal of neurotrophins.  The neurotrophin<br><br>
agonist   compounds   are   suitable   for,   e.g.,   preparation   of   pharmaceutical compositions useful in the treatment of:<br>
i) neurodegenerative, inflammatory, toxic, traumatic, or vascular disorders of the central, peripheral, or autonomic nervous system (such as Alzheimer Disease (AD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Huntington disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, Down syndrome, nervous deafness, Meniere"s disease), neural damages secondary to hypoxia, ischaemia, burns, chemotherapy, toxic compounds of various origin (including alcohol), infections (such as polio or HIV virus), trauma (including surgical trauma) originating axotomy of motoneurons, sensorial, motor, or sensorimotor neuropathies, or autonomic dysfunctions secondary to diverse pathologies (such as diabetes, renal insufficiency, or other systemic diseases), genetic disorders (such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, Refsum disease, abetalipoprotenemia, Tangier disease, Krabbe disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, Fabry disease, Dejerine-Sottas disease), nervous pathologies of diverse origin (such as diffuse athrophy of cerebral cortex, Lewy body dementia, Pick"s disease, mesolimbocortical dementia, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, thalamic degeneration, cortico-striatal-spinal degeneration, cortico-basal ganglionic degeneration, cerebro-cerebellar degeneration, familial dementia with spastic paraparesis, polyglucosan bodies disease, Shy-Drager synfrome, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, deforming muscular dystony, Hallervorden-Spatz disease, Meige"s syndrome, familial shivering, Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, chorea-acanthocytosis syndrome, Friedreich"s ataxia, Holmes" corticocerebellar familial atrophy, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease, progressive spinal muscular atrophy, spastic paraplegia, peroneal muscular atrophy, hypertrophic interstitial polyneuropathy, polyneuritic ataxic heredopathy), some ocular pathologies (such as optic nerve neuropathies, retinal degeneration, ophtalmoplegy, glaucoma), corneal diseases of diverse origin (such as neurotrophic ulcers, post-traumatic or post-infective corneal disorders), pathologies from reduced motility of the gastro-intestinal tract or from urinary bladder atony (such as interstitial cystitis or diabetic cystitis), endocrine neoplastic pathologies (such as prolactinoma), clinical conditions in which stimulation of learning processes is advantageous (in particular, in dementias and in post-<br><br>
traumatic conditions), besides all pathological conditions originating from apoptotic<br>
processes of neural cells;<br>
ii) acquired immunodeficiency diseases due to reduced or absent bioavailability of<br>
NGF (such immunodificiency of ageing);<br>
iii) conditions in which stimulation of neoangiogenesis may be advantageous (such<br>
as myocardial infarction,  stroke,  cerebral aneurysms,  gastro-duodenal  ulcers,<br>
wound healing, peripheral vasculopathies);<br>
iv) certain ocular pathologies (such as corneal pathologies of diverse origin and<br>
glaucoma).<br>
The present 3-aza-bicyclo[3.2.1]octane derivatives of general formula (I), and their<br>
dimers of general formula (tl) and (ill) above reported, are also suitable for the<br>
preparation of culture and storage media useful for conservation of explanted<br>
corneas destined to transplantation.<br>
Moreover, when labelled with suitable reagents (contrast agents, radioisotopes,<br>
fluorescent agents, etc.), and possibly processed with any other procedure useful<br>
for medical imaging purposes, the present 3-aza-bicyclo[3.2.1]octane derivatives<br>
of general formula (I), and their dimers of general formula (II) and (III), may be<br>
used for the imaging analysis of tissues and organs containing neurotrophine<br>
receptors, either in vitro or in vivo, in particular such labelled compounds may be<br>
used either for monitoring the use and efficacy of drugs or for the diagnosis of<br>
mammal diseases in which the neurothrophine receptors are involved.<br>
In general, the present compounds having  neurotrophin agonistic activity, in<br>
particular   NGF   agonistic   activity,   were   proven   adequate   to   substitute   for<br>
neurotrophin and NGF biologic activity.<br>
Furthermore, the present neurotrophin agonistic compounds can be used to<br>
promote in vivo, in vitro, or ex vivo growth and/or survival of neural cells, including,<br>
but not limited to: dopaminergic, cholinergic, sensorial neurons, striatal cells,<br>
cortical cells, cells of the corpus striatum, hippocampus, cerebellum, olfactory<br>
bulbs, peri-aqueductal cells, cells of the raphe nuclei, of the locus coeruleus, of the<br>
dorsal root ganglia, sympathetic neurons, lower motoneurons, nervous stem cells,<br>
or cells anyhow deriving from the neural plaque.<br>

BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY<br>
The biological activity of 3-aza-bicyclo(3.2.1)octanes of formula (I) and their dimeric forms of formula (II) and (III) was evaluated in different assays: induction of survival of PC12 cells in serum-free conditions, induction of proliferative activity in<br><br>
PC3  prostatic carcinoma  cell  line,   induction  of VGF  polypeptide  synthesis,<br>
displacement of 1251-NGF binding to specific surface receptor, and induction of<br>
Trk-A autophosphorylation. In all of these assays human recombinant (hr)NGF<br>
was used as internal standard.<br>
Effect of compounds on PC12 cell survival in serum-free conditions.<br>
The biological activity of 3-aza-bicyclo(3.2.1)octanes of formula  (I) and their<br>
dimeric forms of formula (II) and (III) was tested as ability to induce the survival of<br>
PC12 cells in serum-free conditions by using hrNGF as internal standard.<br>
PC12 cells were detached from tissue flasks with PBS-EDTA (physiological saline<br>
solution added with ethylendiaminotetraacetic acid) and washed once with PBS to<br>
avoid residual amounts of serum. The cells were then diluted in RPMI-1640<br>
medium without phenol red supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin and<br>
cultured in 96 well plates at the final concentration of 5 x l03/well. Standard curve<br>
was performed by adding in triplicate cultures different concentrations of hrNGF, in<br>
the range between 1-25 ng/ml. The compounds were instead added, in triplicate,<br>
at the final concentrations of 1, 10, 100 nM The cells were then cultured for 60<br>
hours at 37Â°C in a humidified, 5% CO2, atmosphere. Then 10 \i\ of (3-[4.5-<br>
dimethylthiazol-2yl]-2.5-diphenyltetrazolium    bromide    (MTT,     0.5    mg/ml    in<br>
isopropanol) were added to each well and plates, protected from the light, were left<br>
at 37Â°C for 4 hours. At the end of incubation, 100 \ti of 50% dimethylformamide (in<br>
20% SDS, pH 7.4) were added to each well. Colorimetric reaction was detected<br>
with a 96 well plate reader by recording the absorbance at 570 nm. Results were<br>
expressed as survival induced by compounds/spontaneous survival -100<br>
Figure 1  shows the results obtained with 10 ^M of the most representative<br>
compounds and with 1 nM of hrNGF.<br>
Effect of compounds on proliferative activity of PC3 cell line.<br>
The ability of 3-aza-bicyclo(3.2.1)octanes of formula (I) and their dimeric forms of<br>
formula (II) and (III) with substitutions reported in Table 1-4 to induce proliferation<br>
of PC3 cell line, in serum-free conditions, was tested by using hrNGF as internal<br>
standard.<br>
PC3 cells were cultured in triplicate in 24 well plates at the final concentration of<br>
104 cells/ml (final volume of 500 Âµl )in RPMI 1640 medium in the presence or<br><br>
absence of 1, 10, 100 nM of the compounds or of different concentration (between 1-25 ng/ml) of hrNGF as internal standard. Cells were incubated for 60 hours in humidified, 5% C02, atmosphere. At the end of incubation 0.5 ÂµCi of 3H-thymidine were added to each well for 8 hours. Cells were then washed 6 times with PBS, lysed with 0.1 % Triton-X100 in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, and the radioactivity was recorded in a p-scintillation counter. Results were expressed as ratio between 3H-thymidine incorporation (mean Â± SD) of stimulated cultures and 3H-thymidine incorporation of non stimulated cultures. Figure 2 shows the results obtained with 10 jiM of selected compounds or with 1 nM hrNGF as internal standard. Induction of VGF production bv PC12 cells<br>
The ability of 3-aza-bicyclo(3.2.1)octanes of formula (I) and their dimeric forms of formula (II) and (III) with substitution reported in Table 1-4 was tested also as ability to induce VGF production by PC12 cells. 5 x 106 PC12 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 1, 10, 100 ÂµM of the compounds or of 4 nM hrNGF as internal standard for 24 hours in humidified, 5% COz, atmosphere. Cells were lysed in 0.25% NP-40 in PBS supplemented with 1 mM PMSF (phenyl-methyl) and 1 mM leupeptin and protein concentration was measured in each sample by Bradford assay. Equal amounts of proteins (30 M-9) were loaded in 8% SDS-polyacrilamide gel, electrophoresed, blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane and stained with monoclonal antibodies anti-VGF followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Reaction was visualized by Enhanced Chemiluminiscent Reagent (ECL, Amersham) following the manifacturer instruction.<br>
Figure 3 shows the results obtained with 10 nM of the selected (n. 91, 9, 323, 270) compounds or with 10 nM hrNGF. VGF is induced by the selected compounds as well as by hrNGF.<br>
Displacement of ,25I-NGF binding to PC12 cells<br>
The ability of selected compounds to displace the binding of NGF to specific surface receptor was evaluated through the classic binding techniques of iodinated ligand.<br>
PC12 cells were detached from tissue flasks with PBS-EDTA, washed with HKR medium (10 mM Hepes, 125 mM NaCI, 4.8 mM KCI, 1.3 mM CaCI2, 1.2 mM MgS04, 1.2 mM KH2P04, 1g/l glucose, 1g/l BSA) and incubated in triplicate in<br><br>
HKR medium with 0.1 nM 125I-NGF in the presence or absence of variable concentrations of the compounds to be assayed or of hrNGF as internal standard. Displacement curve was obtained by analyzing the resultant cell bound radioactivity in the presence of the compounds or of hrNGF with adequate software (Graphit 4).<br>
Figure 4 a shows the displacement curve obtained with the compound n.9 used as competitor The analysis of data revealed a Kd of 165 nM Â± 0.05. Figure 4b shows the displacement curve obtained by using hrNGF as competitor. The analysis of data revealed a Kd of 114 pM Â± 0.01 as already reported. Trk-A autophosphorylation<br>
To evaluate the ability of the compounds 3-aza-bicyclo(3.2.1)octanes of formula (I) and their dimeric forms of formula (II) and (III) reported in Table 1-4 to induce Trk-A autophosphorylation, PC12 cells were cultured in medium supplemented with 5% FBS for 48 hours, washed and equilibrated in serum-free medium for 2 hours. 2.5 x 106 ceils were then stimulated with 10 ÂµM of selected compounds for 30 min or with 10 nM hrNGF as positive control. Cells were then lysed with 0.5% Triton-X100 in PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors (PMSF, aprotinin, pepstatin, leupeptin) and phosphatase inhibitors. Protein concentrations in each sample was evaluated by Bradford assay and equal amounts (50 Âµg) of proteins were loaded onto SDS-polyacrilamide gel, electrophoresed and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes was sained with rabbit anti-(Tyr 490 and Tyr 674/675) phosphorylated Trk-A (Cell Signaling Technology) used at the final dilution of 1:1000. After washing, membranes were stained with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and the reaction was visualised by using ECL reagents following manufacturing instructions.<br>
Figure 5 shows the results obtained with the compounds 272, 325, 9, 91 and with hrNGF used as internal standard. The selected compounds are able to induce Trk-A autophosphorylation thus triggering the transduction of biological signals. Synergic activity<br>
The synergic activity of multiple combinations of 3-aza-bicyclo(3.2.1)octanes of formula (I) and their dimeric forms of formula (II) and (III) was evaluated in the PC12 survival assay in serum-free condition.<br><br>
PC12 cells were seeded in 96 well plates at the concentration of 5 x l03/well and cultured in triplicate in the presence or absence of 5 ÂµM of selected compounds or of multiple combination of the same compounds at the final concentration of 10 ÂµM. 0,5 nM hrNGF was used as internal standard. After 60 hours at 37Â°C in a humidified, 5% C02, atmosphere, 10 Âµlof (3-[4.5-dimethylthiazol-2yl]-2.5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, 0.5 mg/ml in isopropanol) were added to each well and plates, protected from the light, were left at 37Â°C for 4 hours. At the end of incubation, 100 yd of 50% dimethylformammide (in 20% SDS, pH 7,4) were added to each well. Colorimetric reaction was detected with a 96 well plate reader by recording the absorbance at 570 nm. Results were expressed as survival induced by compounds/spontaneous survival *100. Figure 6 shows as selected combinations of 2 compounds (91 and 325) induce survival activity higher than the addition of activities induced by the single compound.<br><br><br>
