RECORDING INK. INK MEDIA SET. INK CARTRIDGE. INK RECORDED<br>
MATTER. INKJET RECORDING APPARATUS. AND INKJET RECORDING<br>
METHOD<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a recording ink suitably used for inkjet<br>
recording, an ink media set using the recording ink, an ink cartridge, an ink recorded<br>
matter, an inkjet recording apparatus, and an inkjet recording method.<br>
Background Art<br>
Inkjet recording methods are methods of printing by jetting ink droplets to<br>
make them adhere on a recording medium such as paper. As inks used in the inkjet<br>
recording methods, generally, a solution or dispersion liquid is used in which various<br>
colorants such as dyes and pigments are dissolved or dispersed in water or a mixture<br>
of water and a high-boiling point organic solvent, and to maintain moisture retention,<br>
a large amount of a wetting agent composed of a high-boiling point organic solvent<br>
is further contained therein. Such a wetting agent composed of a high-boiling point<br>
organic solvent contributes to prevention of drying of nozzle ports because of its<br>
low-volatility (evaporativity) and water-retention ability. When such an ink is used<br>
for recording on paper having high-ink permeation, for example, with regular paper,<br>
however, the wetting agent contained in the ink is hardly volatile, resulting in<br>
frequent ink strike through.<br>
Meanwhile, when a conventional ink containing a large amount of wetting<br>
agent is used for recording on paper which has low liquid absorbability such as offset<br>
printing coated paper (hereinafter, may be referred to as "coated paper"), ink beading<br>
and ink bleeding are liable to occur in portions with a large amount of the ink, such<br>
as solid parts, due to its low-permeation rate of the ink provided on a surface of the<br>
coated paper thereinto, it takes some time to dry a recorded image because the<br>
wetting agent is hardly likely to evaporate, causing offset smear due to spurs, smear<br>
during conveyance, and paper stain and/or paper-sticking at paper stacked section in<br>
a paper-feed unit, etc. Thus, such a conventional ink is inappropriate in practical<br>
use.<br>
In order to solve the problems, it has been desired to provide an inkjet<br>
recording method that allows ink bleeding to hardly occur even with the use of<br>
printing coated paper, allows ink to dry quickly, allows for high-image density and<br>
high-image quality even when an ink is printed on regular paper, and allows nozzle<br>
clogging to hardly occur even during long-time stoppage of printing operation.<br>
For example, Patent Literature 1 proposes an inkjet ink containing an<br>
extremely small amount of a wetting agent. According to the proposal, it is possible<br>
to obtain high-quality image with high-image density without substantially causing<br>
ink strike through even when regular paper is used. However, in this proposal, no<br>
resin is contained in the ink, and particularly when a pigment ink is used, the fixing<br>
ability of image is poor. Further, improvements in drying rate of ink when the ink is<br>
printed on offset coated paper are not disclosed nor suggested in the proposal.<br>
Patent Literature 2 proposes a quick-drying dye ink. In Examples of this<br>
proposal, however, the amount of a wetting agent is contained 6 times the amount of<br>
a colorant used with no addition of resin; high-quality paper is used, and printing<br><br>
coated paper, which extremely hardly absorbs liquid, is not intended for use.<br>
Patent Literature 3 proposes a quick-drying ink relating to inkjet recording<br>
based on energization heat generation. However, the ink provided in this proposal<br>
contains a large amount of electrolyte with no addition of resin, the fixing ability of<br>
image is poor, and an ink-flying method is employed which is essentially different<br>
from piezo-type inkjet method.<br>
Further, each of Patent Literature 4 and Patent Literature 5 proposes a<br>
combination of a micro-capsulated pigment and printing paper. However, in these<br>
proposals, the inks have generally used ink compositions. Thus, in order to improve<br>
the drying properties thereof, heating by microwave energy is required.<br>
Patent Literature 6 proposes an ink containing wax fine particles and resin<br>
fine particles. In this proposal, the wax fine particles are used in place of a wetting<br>
agent, in terms of capability of imparting moisture retention. However, the wax fine<br>
particles having moisture retention tend to be poor in fixing property and dryness.<br>
Patent Literature 7 proposes an ink containing a resin emulsion, a polymer<br>
dispersant and a pigment. The ink provided in this proposal contains a small amount<br>
of a wetting agent, but the total dissolved solid content is low. Therefore, sufficient<br>
image density and sufficient color-development may not be obtained.<br>
Patent Literature 8 proposes as an ink suitable for non-porous recording<br>
media, such as film, an ink resin emulsion which contains an aqueous liquid vehicle<br>
with an acid function polymer colloid particle dispersed therein, and a pigment<br>
colorant in which polymer molecules are bonded to each other, and proposes an ink<br>
containing a polymer dispersant and a pigment. In the Examples of this proposal, a<br>
high-boiling point wetting agent (water-soluble organic solvent) is contained about<br>
3.5 times the solid component, and in drying process of image recorded with the ink<br>
by leaving it under normal environments, it becomes necessary to heat and dry the<br>
ink by means of a heat gun due to its slow drying.<br>
Further, Patent Literature 9 describes a pigment ink in order to<br>
simultaneously achieve two opposed objects of an object of preventing nozzle<br>
clogging and another object of quick drying of ink on a recording medium after<br>
recorded. In the pigment ink, the amount of glycerine contained (X), which is<br>
effective in preventing nozzle clogging, and the amount of isopropanol contained<br>
(Y), used as a high-volatile solvent, which is effective in drying a recoded image, are<br>
specified within the ranges, 1 
This technique does not disclose a recording ink allowing for obtaining highly sharp<br>
images that are close in quality to recorded matters produced by commercial printing<br>
or printed matters for publication without substantially causing ink beading and<br>
without any problems with the drying rate of ink even when the ink is printed on<br>
printing coated paper which has low liquid absorbability, in view of adjustments of<br>
the ratio of three components of the colorant amount, the amount of solid contents<br>
and the amount of the water-soluble organic solvent having a high-boiling point of<br>
280°C or higher, besides additive amounts, and the contents. Patent Literature 10<br>
discloses an inkjet ink in which a difference in weight ratio between nonvolatile<br>
components contained in a recording liquid (including resin and wax) and coloring<br>
material components falls in the range of from 0.1 to 10 at 25°C for the purpose of<br>
improving the image density when printed on non-coated paper and improving<br>
abrasion resistance of printed matters. Patent Literature 11 discloses an ink<br>
containing as essential components a dye and a solvent for dissolving the dye and<br>
further containing a fluorochemical surfactant for exhibiting quick-drying properties<br>
by decreasing the surface tension of the ink so as to improve the wettability of the<br>
ink to a target recording medium and a large amount of an organic solvent for<br>
improving solubility of the fluorochemical surfactant in the ink, and described that<br>
the surface tension of the ink at 25°C and the ink viscosity thereof at 20°C are<br>
reduced to improve the frequency responsiveness of discharge ink by making<br>
uniform dispersibility of the components in the ink responsive to high-speed<br>
printing, thereby ejecting small droplets of ink. Patent Literature 12 describes an ink<br>
in which a pigment and a micro emulsion are contained in an aqueous medium, the<br>
micro emulsion has an average particle diameter of 50 nm or less, the amount of the<br>
micro emulsion contained is 0.5% by mass to 10% by mass based on the total mass<br>
of the ink, and with the use of the ink, the density of printed matters, when printed<br>
on non-coated paper, is increased, thereby improving abrasion resistance of the<br>
printed matters. However, these proposals do not disclose a technique allowing for<br>
obtaining highly sharp images that are close in quality to recorded matters produced<br>
by commercial printing or printed matters for publication without substantially<br>
causing ink beading and without any problems with the drying rate of ink even when<br>
printed on printing coated paper which has low liquid absorbability, in view of<br>
adjustments of the ratio of three components of the colorant amount, the amount of<br>
solid contents and the amount of the water-soluble organic solvent having a high-<br>
boiling point of 280°C or higher, besides additive amounts, and the contents.<br>
Thus, it has not been intended to apply such conventional inkjet recording<br>
inks to recording media which have low-liquid absorbability, like printing coated<br>
paper such as offset printing coated paper, and in the conventional inkjet recording<br><br>
media, such a technique has not yet been developed that reduces the amount of a<br>
liquid component(s) (primarily, wetting agent) which has a boiling point higher than<br>
that of water and is liquid in ink, with focusing on the ratio with the amount of solid<br>
components in the ink to thereby improve the permeation property of the ink, and<br>
determines the amount of the liquid component(s) so as to fall in the range where<br>
troubles such as a change in the orbit of the ejected ink (ejection curve) and non-<br>
ejection of ink during printing or during short-time stoppage of printing operation,<br>
and nozzle clogging during long-time stoppage of printing operation can be avoided.<br>

A recording ink of the present invention contains a solid component<br>
containing a colorant and a resin and being solid in ink at 25°C, a liquid component<br>
having a boiling point higher than that of water and being liquid in ink at 25°C, and<br>
water. By setting a ratio (A/B) of the total amount of a water-soluble organic solvent<br>
having a high-boiling point of 280°C or higher (A) contained in the liquid<br>
component to the total amount of the solid component (B) contained in the recording<br>
ink to a value within the range of from 1.1 to 2.5, it is possible to provide an inkjet<br>
recording apparatus that allows nozzle clogging to hardly occur even during long-<br>
time stroppage of printing operation, and an inkjet recording method. By setting a<br>
ratio (C/B) of the total amount of the liquid component (C) in the recording ink to<br>
the total amount of the solid component (B) in the recording ink to a value within the<br>
range of from 1.85 to 3.10, it is possible to provide an inkjet recording apparatus that<br>
allows ink bleeding to hardly occur even with the use of printing coated paper which<br>
has low-liquid absorbability, allows for obtaining highly sharp images that are close<br>
in quality to recorded matters produced by commercial printing or printed matters<br>
for publication without substantially causing any problems with the drying rate and<br>
without substantially causing a change in the orbit of the ejected ink (otherwise<br>
referred to as "ejection curve") and non-ejection of ink during printing or during<br>
short-time stoppage of printing operation.<br>
Further, by setting the total amount of the solid component in the recording<br>
ink to a value within the range of from 8.5% by mass to less than 15% by mass, it is<br>
possible to reduce the additive amount of the liquid component necessary for<br>
preventing nozzle clogging, making it possible for ink bleeding to hardly occur as<br>
well as to possible to further increase the drying rate.<br>
The main constituent of the liquid component having a boiling point<br>
higher than that of water and being liquid in ink at 25°C is a so-called wetting agent,<br>
however, when a conventional ink containing a large amount of wetting agent is used<br>
on printing coated paper such as offset printing coated paper, it results in occurrence<br>
of ink bleeding caused by insufficient ink absorbability and slow drying. According<br>
to the following Lucas-Washburn's equation, which is a basic equation for<br>
calculating the permeation constant of liquid into a porous material, it is known that<br>
a permeation distance "h" is proportional to one-half root of a time length "t" and<br>
minus one-half root of a viscosity tj.<br>
H = (R-ytcose/2Ti)1/2<br>
However, in the equation, "h" represents a permeation distance, "t"<br>
represents a time length required for permeation, "R" represents a thin hole diameter,<br>
"0" represents a contact angle, and "tj" represents a dynamic viscosity.<br>
This equation shows that when a recording medium is set, a time length<br>
required for absorption of a same quantity of liquid is proportional to the viscosity of<br>
the liquid and is inversely proportional to the surface tension of the liquid and cos0.<br>
When the surface tension of an ink is not changed, there is a means of reducing the<br>
ink viscosity (to be exact, the viscosity of the liquid component in the ink).<br>
In this case, the ink viscosity varies depending on the amount of a wetting<br>
agent used, and thus it is considered that the amount of the wetting agent is reduced<br>
within a reasonable range where the ink viscosity can be lowered. However, when<br>
the amount of the wetting agent is excessively reduced to the level where the<br>
function of the wetting agent cannot be sufficiently exhibited, the following troubles<br>
are liable to occur. The direction of ink ejection shifts (ejection curve or<br>
displacement of dropping position of ink droplets), non-ejectoin of ink occurs due to<br>
nozzle clogging during long-time stoppage of printing operation, and so on.<br>
Meanwhile, the main constituent of the solid component in the ink is a<br>
colorant and a resin to be contained in the ink for improving the fixing ability. The<br>
main roll of the wetting agent in the ink is to prevent aggregation of the solid<br>
component and adhesion thereof onto a nozzle plate.<br>
In an ink which adheres on a nozzle plate, the moisture content is reduced<br>
primarily due to evaporation of water with a lapse of time, however, a wetting agent<br>
having a high-boiling point and a small amount of water remain, and this makes it<br>
possible to prevent aggregation and contact of a particulate solid component in the<br>
ink, and thus the binding of the solid component can be prevented.<br>
In an ink dropped on a recording medium, a liquid component is removed<br>
from the vicinity of the surface of the recording medium because of permeation of<br>
the liquid component into the medium. The main constituents of the liquid<br>
component of the ink are water and a wetting agent. Even when a wetting agent<br>
having high-viscosity is used as the wetting agent, and the amount of the wetting<br>
agent used is small, the viscosity of the liquid component (containing water) is low.<br>
Therefore, water and the wetting agent are removed from the vicinity of the surface<br><br>
of the recording medium without separating each other, the solid content (a pigment<br>
and a resin as a fixing agent) of the ink remains in image area on the surface of the<br>
recording medium, a slight amount of the wetting agent remains, and thus sufficient<br>
fixing property can be exhibited.<br>
Similarly to the required amount of a binder resin to the solid component<br>
in the ink, it is considered that the required amount of the liquid component<br>
(primarily, a wetting agent) having a boiling point higher than that of water, in the<br>
ink and being liquid in ink at 25°C and used for preventing the binding of the solid<br>
component is substantially proportional to the additive amount of the solid<br>
component in the ink. In this way, when the amount of the solid component is small,<br>
the required amount of the liquid component becomes small, and when the amount<br>
of the solid component is large, the required amount of the liquid component<br>
becomes large.<br>
Therefore, the recording ink of the present invention contains a solid<br>
component containing a colorant and a resin and being solid in ink at 25°C, a liquid<br>
component having a boiling point higher than that of water and being liquid in ink at<br>
25°C and water, wherein the total amount of the solid component contained in the<br>
recording ink is within the range of from 8.5% by mass to less than 15% by mass; a<br>
ratio (A/B) of the total amount of a water-soluble organic solvent having a high-<br>
boiling point of 280°C or higher (A) contained in the liquid component to the total<br>
amount of the solid component (B) contained in the recording ink is set to a value<br>
within the range of from 1.1 to 2.5; and a ratio (C/B) of the total amount of the liquid<br>
component (C) in the recording ink to the total amount of the solid component (B) in<br>
the recording ink to a value within the range of from 1.85 to 3.10. By setting the<br><br>
value of the ratio (C/B) within the range, it is possible to obtain highly sharp images<br>
that are close in quality to recorded matters produced by commercial printing or<br>
printed matters for publication without substantially causing beading and without<br>
any problems with the drying rate of ink even when printed on printing coated paper<br>
which has low liquid absorbability.<br>
An ink cartridge of the present invention includes a container to<br>
accommodate the recording ink of the present invention. The ink cartridge is<br>
suitably used in printers and the like base on inkjet recording system. When the ink<br>
accommodated in the ink cartridge is used and an image etc. is printed on printing<br>
coated paper having low liquid absorbability, it is possible to increase the drying rate<br>
of the ink and to record highly sharp images that are close in quality to recorded<br>
matters produced by commercial printing or printed matters for publication.<br>
An inkjet recording apparatus of the present invention includes at least an<br>
ink jetting unit configured to jet the recording ink of the present invention so as to<br>
record an image, by applying energy to the ink. In the inkjet recording apparatus, the<br>
ink jetting unit applies energy to the recording ink of the present invention and jets<br>
the recording ink so as to record an image. As a result, when the recording ink is<br>
printed on printing coated paper which has low liquid absorbability, it is possible to<br>
increase the drying rate of the ink and to obtain highly sharp images that are close in<br>
quality to recorded matters produced by commercial printing or printed matters for<br>
publication.<br>
An inkjet recording method of the present invention includes at least<br>
jetting the recording ink of the present invention so as to record an image by<br>
applying energy to the ink. In the ink jetting step of the inkjet recording method, the<br><br>
recording ink of the present invention is jetted by applying energy to the recording<br>
ink so as to record an image. As a result, when the recording ink is printed on<br>
printing coated paper which has low liquid absorbability, it is possible to increase the<br>
drying rate of recorded image and to obtain highly sharp images that are close in<br>
.quality to recorded matters produced by commercial printing or printed matters for<br>
publication.<br>
When the inkjet recording method of the present invention is employed,<br>
nozzle clogging is least likely to occur even during long-time stoppage of printing<br>
operation.<br>
The phrase "long-time stoppage" means that a nozzle is left intact in a state<br>
where its nozzle section is capped with a capping unit and stopped for a day or<br>
longer time.<br>
An ink media set of the present invention includes the recording ink of the<br>
present invention, and a recording medium which has a support and a coating layer<br>
i on at least one surface of the support, wherein the amount of pure water transferred<br>
to the recording medium for a contact time of 100 ms measured by a dynamic<br>
scanning liquid absorptometer is 2 mL/m2 to 35 mL/m2, and the amount of pure<br>
water transferred to the recording medium for a contact time of 400 ms is 3 mL/m2 to<br>
40 mL/m2.<br>
In the ink media set of the present invention, the recording ink of the<br>
present invention is combined with a recording medium in which the transfer amount<br>
of pure water is within the predetermined range, whereby an image having glossiness<br>
and high-uniformity of density can be recorded without causing beading in solid<br>
portions.<br><br>
An ink recorded matter of the present invention has an image that is<br>
formed on a recording medium by the use of the recording ink of the present<br>
invention. When the recording ink is printed on a substantially smooth printing<br>
paper having low liquid absorbability, the drying rate is increased, and a highly sharp<br>
image that is close in quality to recorded matters produced by commercial printing or<br>
printed matters for publication can be held on the recording medium as the ink<br>
recorded matter of the present invention.<br>
In the present invention, "beading" means a phenomenon where in inkjet<br>
recording, during a time span from the time when a first ink droplet is dropped on a<br>
surface of a recording medium until the next ink droplet is dropped on the surface,<br>
the first droplet cannot be sufficiently absorbed into the recording medium and<br>
remains in a liquid state on the surface of the recording medium, part of the droplet<br>
remained is then mixed with droplets dropped thereafter, and a colorant in the ink<br>
(organic pigment, etc.) partially becomes a mass, resulting in nonuniform density. In<br>
recently generally used printers, this phenomenon has relationship to the amount of<br>
ink absorbed to a recording medium for a relatively short period of contact time up<br>
to 100 ms at the latest. For instance, in a green image portion, the beading level<br>
varies depending upon the amount of a yellow (Y) ink (or a cyan (C) ink) absorbed<br>
into a recording medium (transfer amount) during the time span from the time when<br>
the yellow (Y) ink (or the cyan (C) ink) is dropped on a surface of the recording<br>
medium until the C ink (or the Y ink) is dropped on the surface of the recording<br>
medium. Beading is likely to occur in secondary colors of green, red, and blue,<br>
however, when the amount of the ink absorbed into a recording medium is small, ink<br>
beading may occur in primary colors of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black.<br><br>
The present invention can solve various conventional problems and<br>
provide a recording ink allowing for obtaining recorded matters produced by<br>
commercial printing or printed matters for publication without substantially causing<br>
ink beading and without any problems with the ink drying rate of image recorded<br>
&gt; with ink even when printed on printing coated paper which has low liquid<br>
absorbability; an ink media set using the recording ink, an ink cartridge, ink recorded<br>
matters, an inkjet recording apparatus that allows nozzle clogging to hardly occur<br>
even during long-time stoppage of printing operation, and an inkjet recording<br>
method.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invnetion<br>
(Recording Ink)<br>
A recording ink of the present invention contains at least a solid<br>
component containing a colorant and a resin and being solid in ink at 25°C and a<br>
liquid component having a boiling point higher than that of water and being liquid in<br>
ink at 25°C, and water and further contains other components in accordance with the<br>
necessity.<br>
9<br>
In the recording ink of the present invention, the total amount of the solid<br>
component contained in the recording ink is within the range of from 8.5% by mass<br>
to less than 15% by mass, more preferably within the range of 9% by mass to 14%<br>
by mass, and particularly preferably within the range of 10% by mass to 12% by<br>
mass.<br>
By setting the total amount of the solid component contained in the<br>
recording ink to less than 15% by mass, it is possible to reduce the additive amount<br>
of the liquid component required for preventing nozzle clogging, and thus it allows<br>
ink beading to hardly occur and the drying rate of recorded image can be further<br>
improved.<br>
When the total amount of the solid component contained in the recording<br>
ink is more than 15% by mass, the amount of the liquid component (primarily,<br>
wetting agent) having a boiling point higher than that of water and being liquid in<br>
ink at 25°C and required for preventing nozzle clogging becomes large, and thus the<br>
amount of the wetting agent remained in recorded image areas in the vicinity of the<br>
surface of the recording medium becomes large, and the drying rate becomes slow.<br>
This prevents binding of the solid component itself (a pigment and a resin as a fixing<br>
agent per se) and binding between the solid component and the recording medium,<br>
resulting in a degradation in fixing ability. In the meanwhile, when the total amount<br>
of the solid component contained in the recording ink is less than 8.5% by mass, the<br>
amount of the liquid component including water contained in the ink is large, and<br>
therefore, unfavorably, the drying rate becomes slow, and cockling and curling are<br>
liable to occur on the recording medium.<br>
The ratio (A/B) of the total amount of a water-soluble organic solvent<br>
having a high-boiling point of 280°C or higher (A) contained in the liquid<br>
component to the total amount of the solid component (B) contained in the recording<br>
ink is set to a value within the range of 1.1 to 2.5, preferably within the range of 1.2<br>
to 2.0, and more preferably within the range of 1.4 to 1.8. By setting the value of the<br>
ratio (A/B) to 1.1 to 2.5, it is possible to provide an inkjet recording apparatus and an<br><br>
inkjet recording method each of which allows nozzle clogging to hardly occur even<br>
during long-time stoppage of printing operation (the long-time reliability is<br>
improved). When the ratio (A/B) is less than 1.1, nozzle clogging is likely to occur<br>
during long-time stoppage of printing operation, and even when actions for<br>
maintenance and recovery are carried out, the problem with nozzle clogging may not<br>
be sometimes resolved.<br>
When the ratio (A/B) is more than 2.5, the ink absorbability (permeability)<br>
and the drying property of image degrade, and the fixing ability (abrasion resistance)<br>
degrades.<br>
The ratio (C/B) of the total amount of the liquid component (C) in the<br>
recording ink to the total amount of the solid component (B) in the recording ink is<br>
set to a value within the range of from 1.85 to 3.10, and more preferably within the<br>
range of from 1.90 to 2.60. By setting the value of the ratio (C/B) to 1.85 to 3.10, it<br>
is possible to provide an inkjet recording apparatus and an inkjet recording method<br>
that allow for obtaining highly sharp images that are close in quality to recorded<br>
matters produced by commercial printing or printed matters for publication without<br>
substantially causing ink beading and without any problems with ink drying rate<br>
even when printed on printing coated paper which has low liquid absorbability, and<br>
without causing a change in the orbit of the ejected ink (otherwise, referred to as<br>
"ejection curve") and non-ejection of ink during printing or during short-time<br>
stoppage of printing operation (the short-term reliability is improved). When the<br>
ratio (C/B) is less than 1.85, a change in the orbit of ejected ink (otherwise, referred<br>
to as "ejection curve") is likely to occur during printing or during short-time<br>
stoppage of printing operation, although the drying rate of the ink is increased.<br><br>
When the ratio (C/B) is more than 3.10, ink beading is likely to occur due to a<br>
degradation in permeability of the ink, and the drying rate of recorded image<br>
becomes slow, resulting in a degradation in fixing ability (abrasion resistance).<br>
in ink at 25°C &gt;<br>
As the liquid component having a boiling point higher than that of water<br>
and being liquid in ink at 25°C, the most part of the liquid component is a wetting<br>
agent having a high boiling point, and further, ink property controlling agents, such<br>
as penetrant and surfactant, also belong to the liquid component.<br>
The ratio of the total amount of the liquid component having a boiling<br>
point higher than that of water and being liquid in ink at 25°C to the total amount of<br>
the solid component in the recording ink is 1.85 to 3.10. The smaller the amount of<br>
the liquid component having a boiling point higher than that of water and being<br>
liquid in ink at 25°C, the shorter the drying rate of the ink becomes, however, to<br>
prevent a change in the orbit of ejected ink (also referred to as "ejection curve") and<br>
non-ejection of ink during printing or during short-time stoppage of printing<br>
operation, attributable to an increase in the ink viscosity caused by drying of ink in<br>
the vicinity of a nozzle, more strict control will be required.<br>
Further, with the use of an ink less containing the total amount of the<br>
liquid component having a boiling point higher than that of water and being liquid in<br>
ink at 25°C in the recording ink, the drying of recorded images quickly proceeds<br>
even when recorded on paper that hardly absorbs liquid, such as coated paper for<br>
offset printing, and it is possible to obtain images with high-glossiness and less<br>
conspicuity of beading.<br><br>
When the total amount of the liquid component having a boiling point<br>
higher than that of water and being liquid in ink at 25°C contained in the recording<br>
ink is more than 33% by mass, the drying rate of recorded image on printing coated<br>
paper such as offset printing coated paper lowers, and ink strike-through may<br>
frequently occur when printed on regular paper. However, the smaller the amount of<br>
the liquid component having a boiling point higher than that of water and being<br>
liquid in ink at 25°C contained in the liquid component, the more the drying rate is<br>
increased.<br>
Note that in the liquid component having a boiling point higher than that<br>
of water and being liquid in ink at 25°C, a wetting agent having a boiling point<br>
higher than that of water is contained, and a penetrant and a surfactant, if they have a<br>
boiling point higher than that of water and are liquid in ink at 25°C, are contained.<br>
In short, it aims to improve the permeability (absorbability) and the drying property<br>
of the ink so as to prevent the occurrence of beading and to shorten the drying rate<br>
even when printed on paper having low liquid absorbability like printing coated<br>
paper by reducing the amount of liquid which is more hardly dry than water as much<br>
as possible.<br>
- Wetting agent (water-soluble organic solvent and solid wetting agent) -<br>
A wetting agent typified by the liquid component having a boiling point<br>
higher than that of water and being liquid in ink at 25°C is not particularly limited<br>
and may be suitably selected in accordance with the intended use, as long as it is<br>
liquid in ink at 25°C. Examples thereof include polyhydric alcohols, polyhydric<br>
alcohol alkyl ethers, polyhydric alcohol aryl ethers, nitrogen-containing heterocyclic<br>
compounds, amides, amines, sulfur-containing compounds, propylene carbonates,<br>
and ethylene carbonates. These may be used alone or in combination.<br>
Examples of the polyhydric alcohols include ethylene glycol, diethylene<br>
glycol, triethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol,<br>
tripropylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,3-butanediol, 2,3-<br>
butanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 3-methyl- 1,3-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, 1,6-<br>
hexanediol, 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, tetraethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol,<br>
glycerine, 1,2,6-hexanetriol, 1,2,4-butanetriol, 1,2,3-butanetriol, andpetriol.<br>
Examples of the polyhydric alcohol alkyl ethers include ethylene glycol<br>
monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, diethylene glycol monomethyl<br>
ether, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, diethylene glycol monobutyl ether,<br>
triethylene glycol, triethylene glycol monomethyl ether, triethylene glycol<br>
monobutyl ether, triethylene glycol isobutyl ether, tetraethylene glycol monomethyl<br>
ether, propylene glycol monoethyle ether, dipropylene glycol monobutyl ether,<br>
tripropylene glycol monomethyl ether, and tripropylene glycol monobutyl ether.<br>
Examples of the polyhydric alcohol aryl ethers include ethylene glycol<br>
monophenyl ether, and ethylene glycol monobenzyl ether.<br>
Examples of the nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds include N-<br>
methyl-2-pyrrolidone, N-hydroxyethyl-2-pyrrolidone, 2-pyrrolidone, 1,3-<br>
dimethylimidazolidinone, and e-caprolactam.<br>
Examples of the amides include formamide, N-methylformamide, and<br>
N,N-dimethylformamide.<br>
Examples of the amines include monoethanol amine, diethanolamine,<br>
triethanolamine, monoethylamine, diethylamine, and triethylamine.<br><br>
Examples of the sulfur-containing compounds include dimethylsulfoxide,<br>
sulforan, thiodiethanol, and thiodiglycol.<br>
Among these, from the perspective of the jetting stability of ink, glycerine,<br>
2-pyrrolidone, diethylene glycol, thiodiethanol, polyethylene glycol, triethylene<br>
glycol, 1,2,6-hexanetriol, 1,2,4-butanetriol, petriol, 1,5-pentanediol, N-methyl-2-<br>
pyrrolidone, 1,3-butanediol, 3-methyl-l,3-butanediol are preferable. Of these,<br>
glycerine, 1,3-butanediol, 3-methyl- 1,3-butanediol, 2-pyrrolidone, and N-methyl-2-<br>
pyrrolidone are particularly preferable.<br>
In order to prevent such troubles with a change in the direction of ink<br>
ejected during printing (ejection curve or displacement of dropping position of ink<br>
droplets), non-ejection of ink due to nozzle clogging during long-time stoppage and<br>
the like, it is preferable that the liquid component having a boiling point higher than<br>
that of water and being liquid in ink at 25°C be contained in a large amount in the<br>
ink, however, in particular, to prevent the occurrence of non-ejection due to nozzle<br>
clogging during long-time stoppage, it is preferable that the rate (A/B) of the total<br>
amount of the water-soluble organic solvent having a high-boiling point of 280°C or<br>
higher (A) to the total amount of the solid component (B) in the recording ink be 1.1<br>
to 2.5. As the water-soluble organic solvent having a high-boiling point, glycerin is<br>
particularly preferable because it has a high-boiling point (290°C), hardly evaporates<br>
and has a high equilibrium moisture regain in low-humidity environment.<br>
Note that in the present invention, the boiling point is a boiling point<br>
measured under a normal atmospheric pressure of 760 mmHg (1,013.3 hPa).<br>
Examples of the solid wetting agent include sugars, sugar alcohols,<br>
hyaluronic acid salts, trimethylolpropane, and 1,2,6-hexanetriol.<br><br>
By setting the ratio of the total amount of the liquid component having a<br>
higher boiling point and being liquid in ink at 25°C, containing a wetting agent as<br>
the main constituent, to the total amount of the solid component in the recording ink<br>
to a value within the range of from 1.85 to 3.10, the drying rate can be increased. As<br>
^constituents being liquid in ink at 25°C other than water and wetting agents, which<br>
are further added in accordance with die necessity, there are the following penetrant<br>
and surfactant. Note that the phrase "being liquid in ink at 25°C" means that it is<br>
liquid in an ink placed under the conditions of normal temperature and normal<br>
pressure (25°C, 1 atmosphere). However, when the additive amount of constituents<br>
) other than wetting agent is small and when the total amount of the liquid component<br>
having a boiling point higher than that of water and being liquid in ink at 25°C<br>
approximates the use amount of the wetting agent, it makes no difference.<br>
- Penetrant -<br>
The amount of the penetrant is calculated with the inclusion of it in the<br>
&gt; amount of the liquid component having a higher boiling point and being liquid in ink<br>
at 25°C, provided that the penetrant has a higher boiling point than that of water and<br>
being liquid in ink at 25°C.<br>
For the penetrant, a polyol compound having 8 to 11 carbon atoms or a<br>
glycol ether compound is used. At least any one of the polyol compound and the<br>
i glycol ether compound has effect of accelerating the penetration to paper and<br>
preventing the occurrence of ink bleeding and is a partially aqueous compound<br>
having a solubility of 0.1% by mass to 4.5% by mass in water at 25°C.<br>
Examples of the polyol compound having 8 to 11 carbon atoms include 2-<br>
ethyl-l,3-hexanediol, and 2,2,4-trimetyl-l,3-pentanediol.<br><br>
Examples of the glycol ether compound include polyhydric alcohol alkyl<br>
ether compounds, and polyhydric alcohol aryl ether compounds.<br>
Examples of the polyhydric alcohol alkyl ether compounds include<br>
ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, diethylene glycol<br>
&gt; monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, diethylene glycol monobutyl<br>
ether, tetraethylene glycol monomethyl ether, and propylene glycol monoethyl ether.<br>
Examples of the polyhydric alcohol aryl ether compounds include ethylene<br>
glycol monophenyl ether, and ethylene glycol monobenzyl ether.<br>
The amount of the penetrant as the liquid component having a boiling<br>
i point higher than that of water and being liquid in ink at 25°C contained in the<br>
recording ink is preferably 0% by mass to 10% by mass, and more preferably 0.5%<br>
by mass to 5% by mass.<br>
- Surfactant -<br>
The surfactant is added in accordance with the necessity as described<br>
above, and is calculated with the inclusion of it in the amount of the liquid<br>
component having a higher boiling point and being liquid in ink at 25°C, provided<br>
that the surfactant has a higher boiling point than that of water and is liquid in ink at<br>
25°C.<br>
The surfactant is not particularly limited and may be suitably selected from<br>
among surfactants that will not impair the dispersion stability, in view of the<br>
combination of the type of colorant, wetting agent and penetrant etc. used, in<br>
accordance with the intended use. However, when printed on printing paper, it is<br>
preferable to use a surfactant having low surface tension and high leveling property,<br>
and at least one selected from silicone surfactants and fluorochemical surfactants is<br>
preferable. Of these, fluorochemical surfactants are particularly preferable.<br>
As the fluorochemical surfactant, the number of fluorine-substituted<br>
carbon atoms is preferably 2 to 16, and more preferably 4 to 16. When the number<br>
of fluorine-substituted carbon atoms is less than 2, the effect of fluorine may not be<br>
obtained, and when the number exceeds 16, it may cause a problem with storage<br>
stability of the ink.<br>
Examples of the fluorochemical surfactants include perfluoroalkyl sulfonic<br>
compounds, perfluoroalkyl carboxylic compounds, perfluoroalkyl phosphoric ester<br>
compounds, perfluoroalkyl ethylene oxide adducts, and polyoxyalkylene ether<br>
polymer compounds having perfluoroalkyl ether group at side chains thereof. Of<br>
these, polyoxyalkylene ether polymer compounds having perfluoroalkyl ether group<br>
at side chains thereof are particularly preferable because they are free of foaming<br>
property.<br>
Examples of the perfluoroalkyl sulfonic compounds include perfluoroalkyl<br>

The surfactants are not particularly limited to those disclosed above, and<br>
they may be used alone or in combination. Even when such a surfactant cannot be<br>
readily dissolved in recording ink as singularly used, it can be dissolved and be<br>
present stably therein when mixed with other surfactants.<br>
Of these surfactants, those represented by any one of the following<br>
Structural Formulas (1) to (5) are preferably used.<br>
D R1-0-(CH2CH20 D h-R2 D D Structural Formula (1)<br><br>
In Structural Formula (1), R1 represents an alkyl group that may be<br>
branched, having from 6 to 14 carbon atoms or a perfluoroalkyl group that may be<br>
branched, having from 6 to 14 carbon atoms; R2 represents a hydrogen atom or an<br>
alkyl group that may be branched, having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms; and h is an<br>
&gt; integer of 5 to 20.<br>
D R'-COCKCHzCHzOV-ien Structural Formula (2)<br>
In Structural Formula (2), R1 represents an alkyl group that may be<br>
branched, having from 6 to 14 carbon atoms; R2 represents a hydrogen atom or an<br>
alkyl group that may be branched, having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms; and h is an<br>
integer of 5 to 20.<br>
In Structural Formula (3), R3 represents a hydrocarbon group, for example,<br>
an alkyl group that may be branched, having from 6 to 14 carbon atoms is<br>
exemplified; and k is an integer of 5 to 20.<br>
CH3<br>
R4_o_ (CH2CH20) L- (CH2CH20) p-H Structural Formula (4)<br>
In Structural Formula (4), R4 represents a hydrocarbon group such as an<br>
alkyl group that may be branched, having from 6 to 14 carbon atoms; L is an integer<br>
of 5 to 10; p is an integer of 5 to 20; propylene glycol chain(s) and ethylene glycol<br>
chain(s) may be polymerized in block or at random.<br>
In Structural Formula (5), each of q and r is an integer of 5 to 20.<br>
The amount of the surfactant contained in the recording ink is preferably<br>
0.01% by mass to 3.0% by mass, and more preferably 0.5% by mass to 2% by mass.<br>
However, the total amount of the liquid component having a boiling point higher<br>
than that of water and being liquid in ink at 25°C is 20% by mass or less and more<br>
preferably 15% by mass or less. When the amount of the surfactant is less than<br>
0.01% by mass, the effect of adding the surfactant may sometimes be impaired, and<br>
when more than 3.0% by mass, the permeation property of the ink to a recording<br>
medium becomes higher than necessary, which may lead to a degradation in image<br>
density and the occurrence of ink strike-through.<br><br>
The total amount of the resin component contained in the solid component<br>
is preferably 40% by mass or more and 95% by mass or less to the solid component<br>
containing a colorant and a resin and being solid in ink at 25°C. When the amount<br>
of the resin component is less than 40% by mass, the fixing ability and the glossiness<br>
of the colorant may be degraded. Meanwhile, to increase the image density to some<br>
extent, 5% by mass or more of the colorant is necessary to the total amount of the<br>
solid component.<br><br>
The reason why the amount of the resin component is large in the solid<br>
component in this way is to improve the fixing ability, the image sharpness and the<br>
glossiness.<br>
Here, the resin component is a polymeric solid component other than<br>
colorant molecules having color-developing groups, and includes resins that wrap<br>
around the colorant and/or make the colorant dispersed. Further, the resin<br>
component also includes a resin emulsion that is added when necessary.<br>
It should be noted that the phrase "being solid in ink at 25°C" means that it<br>
is solid in an ink placed under the conditions of normal temperature and normal<br>
pressure (25°C, 1 atmosphere), the environment used in common inkjet printing.<br>
- Resin -<br>
The resin is not particularly limited and may be suitably selected in<br>
accordance with the intended use as long as it is solid in ink at 25°, however, it is<br>
preferably resin fine particles from the perspective that a large amount of resin can<br>
be added.<br>
For the resin fine particles, resin fine particles being present as a resin<br>
emulsion, in a state of being dispersed in water as a continued phase are used in<br>
production of ink. The resin emulsion may contain a dispersant such as surfactant<br>
when necessary.<br>
The amount of resin fine particles as the component having a dispersed<br>
phase (the amount of resin fine particles contained in the resin emulsion solution: it<br>
is not the amount of resin fine particles in a produced recording ink) is preferably<br>
10% by mass to 70% by mass.<br>
For the particle diameter of the resin fine particles, in view of being used<br>
particularly in an inkjet recording apparatus, the volume average particle diameter<br>
thereof is preferably 10 nm to 1,000 nm, and more preferably 100 run to 300 nm.<br>
This particle diameter is a particle diameter in a resin emulsion, however, in the case<br>
of being in a stable recording ink, it makes no difference between the particle<br>
diameter in a resin emulsion and the particle diameter in a recording ink. The larger<br>
the volume average particle diameter, the more the additive amount of the emulsion<br>
can be increased. When the volume average particle diameter is smaller than 100<br>
nm, the additive amount of the emulsion may not sometimes be increased, and when<br>
the volume average particle diameter is larger than 300 nm, the reliability may<br>
sometimes degrade. However, a resin emulsion having a particle diameter outside<br>
the range may be possibly used. This is general tendency and does not depend upon<br>
the type of emulsion.<br>
The volume average particle diameter can be measured using, for example,<br>
a particle size analyzer (MICROTRACK MODEL UPA9340, manufactured by<br>
NIKKISO CO., LTD.).<br>
Specifically, an emulsion aqueous solution was diluted to within the<br>
optimum range for signal level, and the transparency was set to "Yes", and the<br>
following provisional conditions were set: refractive index-1.49; partial density:<br>
1.19; spherical particles-Yes; and medium-water. Herein, the volume average<br>
particle diameter was set to a value of 50%.<br>
The resin fine particles with the dispersed phase are not particularly<br>
limited and may be suitably selected in accordance with the intended use. Examples<br>
thereof include urethane resins, polyester resins, acrylic resins, vinyl acetate resins,<br><br>
styrene resins, butadiene resins, styrene-butadiene resins, vinyl chloride resins,<br>
acrylic styrene resins, and acrylic silicone resins.<br>
For the resin emulsion, suitably synthesized one or a commercially<br>
available product may be used.<br>
Examples of the commercially available resin emulsions are MICROGEL<br>
E-10O2 and E-50O2 (styrene-acrylic resin emulsion, manufactured by Nippon Paint<br>
Co., Ltd.), BONCOAT 4001 (acrylic resin emulsion, manufactured by Dainippon Ink<br>
and Chemicals, Inc.), BONCOAT 5454 (styrene-acrylic resin emulsion,<br>
manufactured by Dainippon Ink and Chemicals, Inc.), SAE-1014 (styrene-acrylic<br>
resin emulsion, manufactured by Nippon Zeon Company Limited), CYBINOL SK-<br>
200 (acrylic resin emulsion, manufactured by Saiden Chemical Co., Ltd.), PRIMAL<br>
AC-22 and AC-61 (acrylic resin emulsion, manufactured by Rohm &amp; Haas Japan<br>
K.K.), NANOCRYL SBCX-2821 and 3689 (acrylic silicone resin emulsion,<br>
manufactured by Toyo Ink Mfg. Co., Ltd.), and #3070 (methyl methacrylate polymer<br>
resin emulsion, manufactured by Mikuni Color Ltd.). Of these, acrylic silicone<br>
emulsions are particularly preferable from the viewpoint of its excellence in fixing<br>
ability.<br>
The glass transition temperature of the resin component in the acrylic<br>
silicone emulsion is preferably 25°C or lower,<br>
and more preferably 0°C or lower. When the glass transition temperature is higher<br>
than 25°C, the resin itself becomes brittle, resulting in a cause of degradation in<br>
fixing ability. Particularly when used on printing paper having smooth surface and<br>
hardly absorbs water, the fixing ability may possibly degrade. However, a resin<br>
component having a glass transition temperature of 25°C or higher may be possibly<br>
used.<br>
Here, the glass transition temperature can be measured using, for example,<br>
a differential scanning calorimeter (manufactured by Rigaku Denki Co., Ltd.).<br>
Specifically, a resin film sample piece obtained by drying a resin emulsion aqueous<br>
solution at normal temperature was heated from a temperature near -50°C, and the<br>
glass transition temperature was determined based on a temperature at which the<br>
resin film sample piece had an uneven portion.<br>
- Colorant -<br>
The colorant is not particularly limited as long as it is solid in an ink at<br>
25°, and any of pigment and dye can be suitably used.<br>
When a pigment is used as the colorant, an ink with excellence in light<br>
resistance can be obtained. The pigment is not particularly limited, and commonly<br>
pigments used for inkjet recording are used. For example, the following pigments<br>
are preferably used:<br>
(1) pigment having a hydrophilic group on its surface<br>
(2) polymer emulsion pigment containing a water-insoluble or substantially water-<br>
insoluble coloring material in a polymer fine particle<br>
(3) microcapsulated pigment in which a pigment is covered with a resin having a<br>
hydrophilic group<br>
The pigment (1) is a pigment whose surface is modified so that at least one<br>
hydrophilic group is bonded to the surface directly or via other atomic group. For<br>
the surface modification, a method of chemically bonding a specific functional group<br>
(functional groups such as sulfone group and carboxyl group) to the surface, a<br><br>
method of subjecting the surface to a wet-process oxidation treatment using at least<br>
any one of a hypohalous acid and salt thereof, or the like may be used. Among these<br>
pigments, an embodiment is particularly preferable in which a carboxyl group is<br>
bonded to the surface of the pigment and the pigment is dispersed in water. Since<br>
the surface of the pigment is modified and a carboxyl group is bonded thereto in this<br>
way, the dispersion stability is improved. Besides, high-quality image print can be<br>
obtained and the water resistance of printed recording medium is further improved.<br>
Since an ink according to this embodiment is excellent in<br>
re-dispersibility, it allows for performing excellent printing with simple cleaning<br>
operation, without causing the occurrence of nozzle clogging even when printing<br>
operation is stopped for a long time and the moisture content of the ink near<br>
nozzles of an inkjet head evaporates.<br>
The volume average particle diameter of the self-dispersible type<br>
pigment in ink is preferably 0.01 |im to 0.16 |im.<br>
For example, as a self-dispersible type carbon black, those having<br>
ionicity are preferable, and anionicly charged ones and cationicly charged ones are<br>
more suitable.<br>
Examples of the anionic hydrophilic group are -COOM-, -SO3M-,<br>
-PO3HM-, -PO3M2-, -SO2NH2-, and -SO NHCOR (M represents any one of a<br>
hydrogen atom, an alkaline metal, ammonium, and organic ammonium; R represents<br>
any one of an alkyl group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, a phenyl group that may<br>
have a substituent, and a naphthyl group that may have a substituent). Among these<br>
pigments, a color pigment with -COOM- and/or -SO3M- bonded to a surface of the<br>
color pigment is preferably used.<br><br>
For "M" in the hydrophilic group as the alkaline metal, lithium, and<br>
potassium are exemplified. For "M" in the hydrophilic group as the organic<br>
ammonium, monomethyl to trimethyl ammoniums, monoethyl to triethyl<br>
ammoniums, and monomethanol to trimethanol ammoniums are exemplified. With<br>
respect to the method of obtaining the anionicly charged color pigment, as a method<br>
of introducing -COONa to a surface of a color pigment, for example, a method of<br>
subjecting the color pigment to an oxidation treatment with hypochlorous soda;<br>
julfonation method, and a method of reacting with diazonium salt are exemplified.<br>
For the cationic hydrophilic group, quaternary ammonium group is<br>
preferable, the following quaternary ammonium groups are more preferable. In the<br>
jresent invention, a compound with any one of these groups is bonded to a surface<br>
of carbon black is suitably used as a coloring material.<br>
A method of producing a cationic self-dispersible type carbon black with a<br>
hydrophilic group bonded to the surface thereof is not particularly limited and may<br><br>
be suitably selected in accordance with the intended use. For example, as a method<br>
of bonding an N-ethylpyridyl group represented by the following Structural Formula<br>
to the surface of the carbon black, a method of treating carbon black with 3-amino-<br>
N-ethylpyridium bromide is exemplified.<br><br>
The hydrophilic group may be bonded to the surface of the carbon black<br>
via other atomic group. Examples of the other atomic group include alkyl groups<br>
having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, phenyl groups that may have a substituent or naphthyl<br>
groups that may have a substitutent. Specific example of the case where the<br>
hydrophilic group is bonded to the surface of carbon black via other atomic group<br>
are -C2H4COOM (M represents an alkaline metal or a quaternary ammonium),<br>
-PhSC^M (Ph represents a phenyl group, M represents an alkaline metal or a<br>
quaternary ammonium), and -CsHioNrV.<br>
For the pigment (2), the polymer emulsion containing a coloring material<br>
means at least any one of a polymer emulsion with a pigment included in polymer<br>
fine particles and a polymer emulsion in which a pigment is adsorbed to the surface<br>
of polymer fine particles. Examples thereof include those described in Japanese<br>
Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. 2001-139849.<br>
In this case, all the pigment particles are not necessarily included in or<br>
adsorbed to polymer fine particles, and the pigment may be dispersed in the<br>
emulsion within the range where the effects of the present invention are not<br>
impaired.<br>
The phrase "water-insoluble or substantially water-insoluble" means that<br>
10 parts by mass or more of the coloring material are not dissolved to 100 parts by<br>
mass of water at 20°C. The word "dissolved" means that separation of the coloring<br>
material and/or sedimentation of the coloring material is not visually observed on the<br>
surface layer of the aqueous solution or the bottom layer thereof.<br>
The polymer constituting the polymer emulsion is not particularly limited<br>
and may be suitably selected in accordance with the intended use. Examples of the<br>
polymer include vinyl polymers, polyester polymers, polyurethane polymers, and<br>
polymers disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) Nos. 2000-<br>
53897 and 2001-139849. Of these, vinyl polymers, and polyester polymers are<br>
particularly preferable.<br>
The volume average particle diameter of polymer fine particles (colorant<br>
fine particles) containing the coloring material in the ink is preferably 0.01 u,m to<br>
0.16 µm.<br>
When the pigment (2) is used, an ink which is excellent in light resistance<br>
and fixing ability can be obtained.<br>
In the pigment (3), a pigment is dispersed in water by covering the<br>
pigment with a hydrophilic water-insoluble resin to make a resin layer on the surface<br>
of the pigment have hydrophilic properties. Examples thereof include those<br>
i described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. 20O2-67473.<br>
When the pigment (3) is used, an ink which is excellent in light resistance<br>
and fixing ability can be obtained.<br>
It is considered that the pigments (2) and (3) are similar to each other in<br>
terms that a pigment and a resin are integrated into one compound. Any one of the<br>
pigments (2) and (3) can be suitably used in the present invention.<br>
When any of the pigments (1), (2), and (3) is made to have an ink<br>
composition ratio according to the present invention, the improvements in drying<br>
and high-color tone property are remarkably exhibited.<br>
The color-developing component of the colorant is not particularly limited<br>
and may be suitably selected in accordance with the intended use. For example, the<br>
color-developing component may be any of an inorganic pigment and an organic<br>
pigment.<br>
Examples of the inorganic pigment include titanium oxide, iron oxide,<br>
calcium carbonate, barium sulfate, aluminum hydroxide, barium yellow, cadmium<br>
red, chrome yellow, and carbon black. Of these, carbon black etc. are preferable.<br>
Examples of the carbon black are those produced by known methods such as the<br>
contact method, furnace method, thermal method.<br>
Examples of the organic pigment include azo pigments, polycyclic<br>
pigments, dye chelates, nitro pigments, nitroso pigments, and aniline black. Of<br>
these, azo pigments and polycyclic pigments are more preferable. Examples of the<br>
«<br>
azo pigments include azo lake, insoluble azo pigments, condensed azo pigments, and<br>
chelate azo pigments. Examples of the polycyclic pigment include phthalocyanine<br>
pigments, perylene pigments, perinone pigments, anthraquinone pigments,<br>
quinacridone pigments, dioxadine pigments, indigo pigments, thioindigo pigments,<br>
isoindolinone pigments, and quinophthalone pigments. Examples of the dye chelates<br>
include basic dye type chelates, acidic dye type chelates.<br><br>
The color of the pigment is not particularly limited and may be suitably<br>
selected in accordance with the intended use. For example, pigments for black color,<br>
and pigment for color ink are exemplified. These pigments may be used alone or in<br>
combination.<br>
Examples of the pigments for black color include carbon black (C.I.<br>
Pigment Black 7) such as furnace black, lamp black, and channel black; metal<br>
pigments such as copper and iron (C.I. Pigment Black 11), titanium oxide, etc.; and<br>
organic pigments such as aniline black (C.I. Pigment Black 1).<br>

When a dye is used as the colorant, an ink which is excellent in color tone<br>
can be obtained. Examples of the dye include oil-soluble dyes, and dispersed dyes.<br>
In the recording ink, it is preferable that the resin component be 40% by<br>
mass to 95% by mass to the total amount of the solid component (for example, the<br>
total amount of a resin and a colorant used). Therefore, the amount of the colorant<br>
contained in the solid component is preferably 60% by mass or less. In the resin<br>
component based on the calculation at this point, the amount of resin covering the<br>
colorant used is also included. More specifically, the total amount of the resin<br>
components including resins covering the colorant used is 40% by mass or more<br>
among the total solid component that is equal to the amount of resin plus the amount<br>
of the colorant.<br>

preferable in view of the use thereof in the recording ink, which is an aqueous<br>
medium.<br>
For the antifoaming agent, a commercially available product may be used.<br>

The recording ink of the present invention is produced by dispersing or<br>
dissolving in an aqueous medium a solid component containing a colorant and a<br>
resin and being solid in ink at 25°C, and a liquid component having a boiling point<br>
higher than that of water and being liquid in ink at 25°C, water and other<br>
components in accordance with the necessity, and further agitating and mixing these<br>
components when necessary. It should be noted that the colorant and the resin are<br>
preliminarily dissolved or dispersed in water to prepare a solution or dispersion<br>
liquid, and the solution or dispersion liquid is used. The dispersion treatment can be<br>
carried out by means of a sand mill, homogenizer, ball mill, paint shaker, ultrasonic<br>
dispersing device, or the like. The agitation/mixing can be carried out by means of<br>
an agitator using common stirring blades, a magnetic stirrer, a high-speed dispersing<br>
device, or the like.<br>
- Measurement method of solid component amount and liquid component amount -<br>
The amount of the solid component that is solid in ink at 25°C and the<br>
amount of the liquid component that is liquid in ink at 25°C can be measured by<br>
calculation, provided that the formulation of the ink has been known. When the<br>
formulation of the ink is unclear, the amounts thereof can be measured, for example,<br>
by separating only the solid component from the ink. For example, an ink sample is<br>
centrifugalized at 500,000 G or higher at room temperature (25°C) for 24 hours to<br>
precipitate a solid component in the ink sample, thereby the separation between solid<br><br>
phase and liquid phase can be achieved. Further, depending on the type of colorant<br>
and the type of the water-dispersible resin used, the solid-liquid separation can be<br>
done by a salting-out method or an agglomeration method using a solvent, and the<br>
solid component separeated out is then dried for use in measurement,<br>
i When a pigment is used as the colorant, the ratio between the colorant and<br>
the resin can be determined based on the reduction rate of the mass obtained by a<br>
thermal mass analysis. During the measurement, to prevent the resin and the<br>
pigment from burning, the temperature of the ink sample is increased to 500°C at an<br>
increasing rate of 10°C/min under an inert gas atmosphere, and then a change in<br>
mass is measured. Since a slight amount of moisture content and wetting agent<br>
component still remains in the solid matter after the separation between solid phase<br>
and liquid phase, the mass of the solid matter determined at a temperature of 200°C<br>
where almost all the moisture content and wetting agent has evaporated is defined as<br>
the total mass of the solid matter, the mass of the solid matter determined at a<br>
temperature of 500°C where a large amount of the resin has thermally decomposed<br>
and evaporated is defined as the mass of the pigment, and the ratio between the mass<br>
of the pigment and the mass of the resin can be measured based upon the following<br>
mathematical expression.<br>
Mass of pigment/(total mass of solid matter - mass of pigment)<br>
Further, when a certain pigment with low heat resistance such as azo<br>
pigment is used, the pigment has thermally decomposed by the time the temperature<br>
reaches 500°C, and thus it is difficult to measure the amount of the pigment.<br>
However, the amount of the pigment can be measured by making the resin<br>
component dissolved in a solvent to extract the solid matter from the solvent. Based<br><br>
on the mass of the ink sample before/after the extraction, the rate of the amount of<br>
the pigment contained in the solid matter is determined, and the total mass of the<br>
solid matter is determined by a thermal mass analysis. Thereafter, the mass of the<br>
pigment in the solid matter can be measured by the use of the expression, the mass of<br>
the ink sample is multiplied by the rate of the amount of the pigment.<br>
When the molecular structure of the colorant used is clearly determined,<br>
the amount of the solid content of the colorant can be measured by the following<br>
manner. When a pigment or a dye is used as a colorant, the amount of the solid<br>
content of the colorant can be measured by a nuclear magnetic resonance analysis<br>
(NMR). When an inorganic pigment with heavy metal atom contained in its<br>
molecular frame, a metal-containing organic pigment, or metal-containing dye is<br>
used as a colorant, the amount of the solid content of the colorant can be measured<br>
by a fluorescent X-ray analysis.<br>
The qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis on a liquid component<br>
can be carried out by gas chromatography analyses (GC, BC-AED, etc.).<br>
Physical properties of the recording ink of the present invention are not<br>
particularly limited and may be suitably selected in accordance with the intended<br>
use. For example, the viscosity, surface tension, pH etc. are preferably within the<br>
following ranges.<br>
The viscosity of the recording ink is preferably 10 mPa-s or less at 25°C,<br>
and more preferably 7 mPa-s or less at 25°C. When the viscosity is higher than 10<br>
mPa-s, it may become difficult to ensure the ejection stability, and the drying<br>
property may degrade. However, such an ink having high-viscosity may be possibly<br>
used depending upon the structure of the inkjet head.<br><br>
The surface tension of the recording ink at 25°C is preferably 35 mN/m or<br>
lower, and more preferably 30 mN/m or lower. When the surface tension is higher<br>
than 35 mN/m, ink leveling is least likely to take place on a recording medium,<br>
leading to longer time required for drying.<br>
The recording ink preferably has a pH of 7 to 10.<br>
The color of the recording ink of the present invention is not particularly<br>
limited and may be suitably selected in accordance with the intended use. For<br>
example, yellow, magenta, cyan, black are exemplified. When recording is<br>
performed using two or more colors of them in combination, a multi-color image can<br>
be recorded, and when recording is performed using all of these colors as an ink set,<br>
a full-color image can be recorded.<br>
The recording ink of the present invention can be suitably used in printers<br>
each equipped with an inkjet head such as a so-called "piezo-type inkjet head" in<br>
which a vibrating plate constituting the wall surface of an ink flow passage is<br>
deflected by using an piezoelectric element as a pressure generating unit that is<br>
configured to pressurize an ink contained in an ink flow passage, the volume inside<br>
the ink flow passage is changed to thereby eject ink droplets (see Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. 2-51734); a so-called "thermal-type inkjet head"<br>
in which an ink is heated with a thermal energy in an ink flow passage using a heat<br>
generating resistor to generate gas bubbles (see Japanese Patent Application Laid-<br>
Open (JP-A) No. 61-59911); and a so-called "electrostatic type inkjet head" in which<br>
a vibrating plate constituting the wall surface of an ink flow passage is placed at a<br>
position opposed to electrodes, the volume inside the ink flow passage is changed by<br>
deflecting the vibrating plate by an electrostatic force generated between the<br><br>
vibrating plate and the electrodes to thereby eject ink droplets (see Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. 6-71882).<br>
The recording ink of the present invention can be suitably used in various<br>
fields, and can be suitably used in image recording apparatuses (printers, etc.) based<br>
upon inkjet recording method. For example, the recording ink can be used in<br>
printers etc. having a function of heating paper to be recorded and the recording ink<br>
at a temperature of 50°C to 200°C during printing or before/after printing to thereby<br>
accelerate fixing of print to the paper, and can be particularly suitably used in the<br>
following ink cartridge, ink recorded matter, inkjet recording apparatus, and inkjet<br>
recording method of the present invention.<br>
(Ink cartridge)<br>
The ink cartridge of the present invention has a container to accommodate<br>
the recording ink of the present invention and futher has other members suitably<br>
selected in accordance with the necessity.<br>
The container is not particularly limited, and the shape, structure, size,<br>
material and the like may be suitably selected in accordance with the intended use.<br>
For example, a container having at least an ink bag formed of an aluminum laminate<br>
film, a resin film, etc. is preferably exemplified.<br>
Hereinafter, the ink cartridge will be described with reference to FIGS. 1<br>
and 2. FIG. 1 is a diagram showing one example of an ink cartridge 10 according to<br>
the present invention, and FIG. 2 is a diagram exemplarily showing the ink cartridge<br>
shown in FIG. 1 with the inclusion of a case (exterior case).<br>
The ink cartridge 10 is, as shown in FIG. 1, filled with an ink from an ink<br>
inlet port 42 to an ink bag 41, the gas contained therein is evacuated, and the ink<br><br>
inlet port 42 is closed by heat sealing. During the use of the ink, the ink bag 41 is<br>
pricked at an ink ejection port 43 composed of a rubber member with a needle<br>
provided on the main body of a printer, thereby supplying the ink to the printer.<br>
The ink bag 41 is formed of a wrapping member such as aluminum<br>
laminate film allowing for free air permeability. The ink bag 41 is, as shown in FIG.<br>
2, housed in a cartridge case 44 that is usually made of plastic and is detachably<br>
mounted to various types of inkjet recording apparatuses.<br>
(Inkjet recording apparatus and inkjet recording method)<br>
The inkjet recording apparatus of the present invention has at least an ink<br>
jetting unit, and further has other units suitably selected in accordance with the<br>
necessity, for example, a stimulus generating unit, a controlling unit, and the like.<br>
The inkjet recording method of the present invention includes at least an<br>
ink jetting step, and further includes other steps suitably selected in accordance with<br>
the necessity, for example, a stimulus generating step, a controlling step, and the<br>
like.<br>
The inkjet recording method of the present invention can be suitably<br>
carried out by the inkjet recording apparatus of the present invention. The ink jetting<br>
step can be suitably carried out by the ink jetting unit. The other steps can be<br>
»<br>
suitably carried out by the other units.<br>
- Ink jetting step and ink jetting unit -<br>
The ink jetting step is a step of forming an image by applying a stimulus to<br>
the recording ink of the present invention so as to jet the recording ink.<br>
The ink jetting unit is a unit configured to jet the recording ink of the<br>
present invention by applying a stimulus to the recording ink so as to form an image.<br><br>
The ink jetting unit is not particularly limited and may be suitably selected in<br>
accordance with the intended use. For example, as the ink jetting unit, various types<br>
of recording heads (ink ejection heads) are exemplified. In particular, an ink jetting<br>
unit having a head provided with a plurality of nozzle rows and a sub tank to house a<br>
&gt; liquid supplied from a liquid storage tank and to supply the liquid to the head, is<br>
preferable.<br>
The sub tank preferably has a negative pressure generating unit configured<br>
to generate a negative pressure in the sub tank, an air releasing unit configured to<br>
release air in the sub tank, and a detecting unit configured to detect the presence or<br>
i absence of ink depending on a difference in electric resistivity.<br>
The stimulus can be generated by, for example, the stimulus generating<br>
unit. The stimulus is not particularly limited and may be suitably selected in<br>
accordance with the intended use. Examples thereof include heat (temperature),<br>
pressure, vibration, and light. These may be used alone or in combination. Of these,<br>
i heat, and pressure are preferred.<br>
Examples of the stimulus generating unit include heater, pressurizer,<br>
piezoelectric element, vibration generating device, ultrasonic oscillator, and light.<br>
Specifically, as the stimulus generating unit, the following are exemplified: a<br>
»<br>
piezoelectric actuator such as a piezoelectric element; a thermal actuator that uses a<br>
thermoelectric conversion element such as heat-generating resistor and employs<br>
phase transition caused by film boiling of a liquid; a shape memory alloy actuator<br>
that uses a metal phase transition caused by temperature variations, or an<br>
electrostatic actuator using electrostatic forces.<br>
An aspect of the jetting of the recording ink is not particularly limited and<br>
varies depending on the type of the stimulus. For example, when the stimulus is<br>
"heat", there is a method in which the recording ink in the recording head is given<br>
heat energy in accordance with a recording signal by the use of a thermal head, for<br>
example, to generate air bubbles in the recording ink by the heat energy, thereby the<br>
recording ink is ejected and jetted as liquid droplets from nozzle holes of the<br>
recording head. When the stimulus is "pressure", there is a method in which a<br>
voltage is applied to a piezoelectric element which is bonded at a place called<br>
pressure chamber in the ink flow passage in a recording head, thereby the<br>
piezoelectric element bends, the inner volume of the pressure chamber is reduced,<br>
thereby the recording ink is ejected and jetted as liquid droplets from nozzle holes of<br>
the recording head.<br>
The method of jetting a recording ink by applying a voltage to a<br>
piezoelectric element is preferred. The piezo method is advantageous in jetting an<br>
ink containing resin components, and is an effective method which causes less<br>
nozzle clogging particularly when an ink containing less amount of wetting agent is<br>
used.<br>
Further, in order to prevent nozzles from coming off, it is preferable that a<br>
piezoelectric element be applied with a voltage having an intensity by which the ink<br>
is not ejected, and the operation of scanning the recording head be performed<br>
without ejecting an ink from the recording head. Further, it is preferable that the<br>
operation of ejecting ink droplets in an ink reservoir be performed before the<br>
recording head has performed idle scanning operation for one page.<br>
Further, the ink jetting unit preferably has a scraping-off unit configured to<br>
scrape off an ink that adheres on an idle ejection receiver. As the scraping-off unit,<br>
any one of a wiper and a cutter is preferable.<br>
The controlling unit is not particularly limited and may be suitably<br>
selected in accordance with the intended use, as long as it is capable of controlling<br>
the operations of the units described above. Examples of the controlling unit include<br>
instruments such as a sequencer and computer.<br>
Here, it is preferable that in the ink jetting unit, on a plate surface of the<br>
inkjet head for jetting an ink, with ink ejection ports provided thereon, an ink<br>
repellent layer be provided.<br>
The surface roughness (Ra) of the ink repellent layer is preferably 0.2 urn<br>
or less. By adjusting the surface roughness (Ra) of the ink repellent layer to 0.2 µm<br>
or less, unwiped portions can be reduced.<br>
FIGS. 13, 14A to 14C are cross-sectional views of a nozzle plate<br>
used in the present invention.<br>
In this embodiment, a nozzle plate 232, which serves as a plate base of an<br>
inkjet head, is produced by an Ni electrocasting. On a surface of the nozzle plate<br>
232, an ink repellent layer 231 is formed, which is a silicone resin film having a<br>
thickness of 1 angstrom (0.1 nm) or more. The surface roughness (Ra) of the ink<br>
repellent layer 231 is preferably 0.2 µm or less, and the thickness of the ink repellent<br>
layer 231 is preferably 0.1 µm or more, and more preferably 0.5 µm or more.<br>
When the inkjet head is filled with an ink, as shown in FIG. 14C, a<br>
meniscus (liquid surface) P is formed at a boundary portion between the ink repellent<br>
layer 231 formed of a silicone resin film and the nozzle plate 232.<br><br>
The ink ejection ports are formed on the inkjet head such that the cross-<br>
section area of each of the ink ejection ports measured at a plane, which is<br>
perpendicular to a center line of each of the ink ejection ports in the ink repellent<br>
layer formed near each of ink ejection ports on the plate surface on which a plurality<br>
&gt;of the ink ejection ports (nozzles) for ejecting ink are provided, gradually becomes<br>
larger with distance from the surface of the plate base.<br>
The shape of of the ink repellent layer near each of the ink ejection ports is<br>
preferably a rounded surface. Further, it is preferable that the curvature radius of a<br>
curved line of the ink repellent layer near each of the ink ejection ports, measured at<br>
a plane including the center line of each of the ink ejection ports, be larger than the<br>
thickness of the ink repellent layer.<br>
Further, it is preferable that a curved line of the ink repellent layer, formed<br>
from the outside edge of each of the ink ejection ports of the ink repellent layer to a<br>
portion near each of the ink ejection ports at a cross-section as a plane including the<br>
center line of each of the ink ejection ports be a substantially circular-arc curved line,<br>
and the curvature radius of the circular arc be larger than the thickness of the ink<br>
repellent layer.<br>
Furthermore, it is preferable that a tangent line of the ink repellent layer<br>
that passes the outside edge of each of the ink ejection ports of the ink repellent<br>
layer, at the cross-section as a plane including the center line of each of the ink<br>
ejection ports be formed with an angle less than 90 degrees with respect to the<br>
surface of the nozzle member including the outside edge thereof.<br>
Ports of the nozzle plate 232 are provided such that a cross-section thereof<br>
measured at a plane perpendicular to the center line represented with an alternate<br><br>
long and short dash line in FIGS. 14Ato 14C is substantially circular, centering on<br>
the center line. Further, the ink repellent layer 231 formed on the ink ejection<br>
surface of the nozzle plate 232 is formed such that the cross-sectional area of each of<br>
the ports (each of the openings) measured at a plane perpendicular to the center line<br>
gradually becomes larger with distance from the nozzle plate 232.<br>
More specifically, as shown in FIG. 14A, in each of the ports of the ink<br>
repellent layer 231, a curved line formed from the outside edge of one port (here,<br>
each of the ports is explained as one port for convenience) in the nozzle plate 232 to<br>
a portion near the port is formed in a round shape with a curvature radius "r". The<br>
curvature radius r is preferably larger than the thickness "d" of the ink repellent layer<br>
231 other than the vicinity of the port.<br>
The thickness d is a thickness of portions of the ink repellent layer 231<br>
other than the round portion of the port on the ink repellent layer 231, and the<br>
thickness d is preferably the maximum thickness of the ink repellent layer.<br>
In this way, the edge of the port provided on the ink repellent layer 231,<br>
which communicates with the port of the nozzle plate 232, is formed with a smooth<br>
curved line having no pointed portions. This configuration makes it possible to<br>
avoid such troubles that the ink repellent layer 231 delaminates from the nozzle plate<br>
232 even when the injection head is wiped with a wiper formed of a material such as<br>
rubber is caught on such pointed portions.<br>
Further, as shown in FIG. 14B, it is preferable that a tangent line formed so<br>
as to pass the outside edge of each of the ink ejection ports on the ink repellent layer<br>
231 at the cross-section as a plane including the center line of one port (each of the<br>
ink ejection ports) of the nozzle plate 232 be formed with an angle 0 less than 90<br><br>
degrees with respect to the surface of the nozzle plate 232 including the outside edge<br>
of the port of the nozzle 232, which communicates with the outside edge of the port.<br>
By providing an angle 0 of less than 90 degrees between the tangent line at<br>
the outside edge of the port of the ink repellent layer 231 and the surface of the<br>
i nozzle plate 232, it is possible to stably form a meniscus (liquid surface) P at the<br>
boundary portion between the ink repellent layer 231 and the nozzle plate 232 and to<br>
significantly reduce the possibility of forming the meniscus P at other positions. As<br>
a result, a meniscus-formed surface can be made stable, and thus excellent ink-<br>
jetting stability can be obtained when an image is formed with an image forming<br>
i apparatus using the inkjet head equipped with the nozzle plate 232.<br>
As the silicone resin used in this embodiment, a liquid silicone resin of<br>
room-temperature-curable type is preferable, and a liquid silicone resin associated<br>
with hydrolysis reaction is more preferable. In the Examples to be described<br>
hereinbelow, a silicone resin SR2411 manufactured by DOW CORNING TORAY<br>
, SILICONE CO., LTD. was used.<br>
Table 1 described below shows the edge shape formed from the outside<br>
edge of one port of nozzle plate 232 to a portion near the edge of the port, and<br>
evaluation results as to ink residue build up around the nozzle, edge delamination,<br>
and ink-jetting stability.<br>
(Table 1<br>
The results shown in Table 1 demonstrated that the use of an inkjet head in<br>
which the shape of an edge portion in an ink repellent layer 231 (near the outside<br>
edge of a port) with the inclusion of substantially-pointed portions caused ink<br>
residue build up around the nozzle and edge delamination after being wiped.<br>
The use of an inkjet head having a round port edge caused no ink residue.<br>
In comparison, the use of an inkjet head having an angle of r 
15A caused partial edge delamination, and when an inkjet head having 6 &gt; 90° as<br>
shown in FIG. 15B was used, the jetting of ink droplets was unstable.<br>
Further, as shown in FIG. 15C, when an inkjet head having r 
inkjet head having 0 &gt; 90° was used, there may be a case where a meniscus (liquid<br>
surface) P is formed at the boundary portion between an ink repellent layer 231 and a<br>
nozzle plate 232, and there may be a case where a meniscus Q is formed at a<br>
protrusion toward the center of the port in an ink repellent layer 231' (a portion at<br>
which the cross-sectional area perpendicular to the center line of the port becomes<br>
the smallest). For this reason, there is a possibility that the ink-jetting stability varies<br>
when an image is recorded in an inkjet recording apparatus using an inkjet head<br>
including the nozzle plate 232.<br>
Next, the method of producing a nozzle member for an inkjet head *<br>
according to the above-noted embodiment.<br>
FIG. 16 is a view showing a structure of an inkjet head in which a silicone<br>
resin is applied to a nozzle plate surface using a dispenser 234 according to this<br>
embodiment to form an ink-repellency layer 231.<br>
Specifically, on the ink ejection side surface of a nozzle 232 produced by<br>
an Ni electrocasting, the dispenser 234 for applying a silicone solution is placed, and<br>
by performing scanning operation with the dispenser 234 while ejecting silicone<br>
from the tip of a needle 235 so that a nozzle plate 232 and the tip of the needle 235<br>
i are kept at a predetermined interval, it was possible to selectively form a silicone<br>
resin film on the ink ejection surface of the nozzle plate 232 as illustrated in FIG. 13<br>
and FIGS. 14Ato 14C.<br>
For the silicone resin used in this embodiment, a liquid silicone resin of<br>
room-temperature-curable type SR2411 (viscosity: 10 mPa-s manufactured by DOW<br>
CORNING TORAY SILICONE CO., LTD.) was ued. However, a slight amount of<br>
silicone flow into nozzle holes and onto the back surface of the nozzle plate was<br>
observed. The silicone resin film selectively formed in this way had a thickness of<br>
1.2 jim and a surface roughness (Ra) of 0.18 |im.<br>
In the coating hole of the tip of the needle 235 according to this<br>
embodiment, a width (coating width) required for coating a target of the nozzle plate<br>
232, is ensured, as shown in FIG. 17A. With this configuration, the entire surface of<br>
a coating target can be completely coated by just moving a dispenser (not shown)<br>
once in a coating direction.<br>
In other words, the moving direction of the dispenser required for the<br>
coating operation can be set to only one direction, and this configuration makes it<br>
possible to cut out the need of changing the moving direction of the dispenser and of<br>
moving it in an opposite direction.<br>
Here, the tip of a common needle 235 is far narrower than the coating<br>
width required for coating a nozzle plate 232, which is a coating target, and<br><br>
therefore, in order to complete coating of the entire surface of the coating target,<br>
there is a need to change the moving direction of the dispenser by 90° for coating<br>
operation and to move the dispenser in plural directions such as in an opposite<br>
direction. Therefore, there has been a difficulty in uniformly coating the entire<br>
&gt; surface of a coating target.<br>
According to this embodiment, the width of the coating hole of the tip of<br>
the needle 235 is ensured by only the coating width, i.e., a width required for coating<br>
the nozzle plate 232. This configuration makes it possible to uniform the thickness<br>
of a coating solution throughout the surface of a coating target and to obtain precise<br>
) surface finishing.<br>
FIG. 18 is a diagram showing coating operation using a dispenser 234<br>
according to this embodiment. The basic configuration is similar to that shown in<br>
FIG. 11, however, a nozzle plate surface is coated with silicone while the dispenser<br>
jetting a gas 236 from a nozzle hole (port) of the nozzle plate 232. The gas 236 may<br>
ibe suitably selected from various gases as long as the gas is least likely to chemically<br>
react with the silicone used for coating. For example, it may be air. By coating a<br>
nozzle plate surface while jetting the gas 236 from the nozzle hole(s) in this way, a<br>
silicone resin film can be formed on only portions of the nozzle plate surface except<br>
for the nozzle hole(s) on the nozzle plate 232.<br>
 When a similar silicone resin is made to proceed to a predetermined depth<br>
by applying the silicone resin without jetting the gas 236 as mentioned above and<br>
thereafter the gas 236 is jetted from the nozzle 232, an ink repellent layer composed<br>
of the silicone resin can be formed to the predetermined depth of the nozzle wall (for<br>
example, to the depth of several micro meters or so). That is, in addition to the ink<br><br>
repellent layer 231 formed on the ink ejection surface side, a thin ink repellent layer<br>
23 la (an ink repellent layer formed on the inner wall of a port) can be formed to the<br>
predetermined depth from the outside edge of a port of the nozzle plate 232.<br>
The ink repellent layer 231 formed thus on the nozzle plate is wiped using<br>
an EPDM rubber (rubber hardness: 50 degrees). As a result, the ink repellent layer<br>
231 could keep excellent ink repellency even when wiped 1,000 times. Further, a<br>
nozzle member with such an ink repellent layer formed thereon was soaked in an ink<br>
at 70°C for 14 days. Thereafter, the ink repellency on a same level as that in the<br>
initial stage could be maintained.<br>
FIG. 20 is a view showing one example of an inkjet head of the present<br>
invention, and showing a state where a nozzle hole is formed by excimer laser<br>
processing. A nozzle plate 243 is prepared by bonding a resin component 221 and a<br>
high-stiffness component 225 with a thermoplastic adhesive 226. On a surface of the<br>
resin component, on which the high-stiffness component 225 is not formed, an SiCh<br>
thin layer, a thin layer 222, and a fluorine-based water-repellent layer 223 are formed<br>
in this order. A nozzle hole 244 having a desired diameter is formed on the resin<br>
component 221, and on the high-stiffness component 225, a nozzle-communicating<br>
port 227 that communicates with the nozzle hole 244 is formed. The SiO2 thin layer<br>
222 is formed by application of a relatively small amount of heat, i.e, by a method<br>
allowing for forming a layer at a temperature within the range where the resin<br>
component is not thermally affected. Specifically, sputtering, ion beam evaporation,<br>
ion plating, CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition), and P-CVD (Plasma-Chemical<br>
Vapor Deposition) etc. are suitably employed.<br>
It is advantageous in terms of process step time and material cost to make<br>
the SiO2 thin layer 222 have a required minimum thickness with which the<br>
adhesiveness can be ensured. This is because when the SiO2 thin layer 222 is thickly<br>
formed, it will cause some trouble in nozzle hole processing with the use of an<br>
excimer laser. Specifically, even when the resin component 221 is neatly processed<br>
in the form of a nozzle hole, part of the SiO2 thin layer 222 cannot be satisfactorily<br>
processed, leaving unprocessed portions. Thus, it can be said that the thickness<br>
range of 1 angstrom to 300 angstroms (0.1 nm to 30 nm) is suitable as a thickness<br>
range where the adhesiveness thereof can be ensured and no unprocessed portion of<br>
the SiO2 thin layer 222 is left at the time of processing with an excimer laser. The<br>
thickness range of 10 angstroms to 100 angstroms (1 nm to 10 nm) is more suitable.<br>
In the experimental results, the adhesiveness between the SiO2 thin layer 222 and the<br>
resin component 221 was satisfactory, and there was no problem with processed<br>
results with the use of excimer laser even when the thickness of the SiO2 thin layer<br>
was 30 angstroms (3 nm). When the thickness was set to 300 angstroms (30 nm),<br>
unprocessed portions were slightly observed, but this was in the usable range; and<br>
when the thickness was set to be thicker than 300 angstroms (30 nm), significantly<br>
large unprocessed portions occurred, and nozzle deformation which was on the level<br>
where no practical use is expected was observed.<br>
For the material of the ink repellent layer, any materials can be used, as<br>
long as it is a water-shedding material. Specific examples thereof include fluorine-<br>
based water-repellent materials and silicone-based water-repellent materials.<br>
With respect to the fluorine-based water-repellent materials, various<br>
materials have been known. Herein, required water-repellency is obtained by<br><br>
depositing a mixture (product name: OPTOOL DSX, manufactured by Daikin<br>
Industries, Ltd) of a perfluoropolyoxetane with a modified perfluoropolyoxetane so<br>
as to be a thickness of 1 angstrom to 30 angstroms (0.1 nm to 3 nm). In the<br>
experimental results, even when the thickness of the OPTOOL DSX was set to 10<br>
angstroms, 20 angstroms, and 30 angstroms, there was no difference found in the<br>
water repellency, and wiping durability. Therefore, in view of cost, the thickness of<br>
the ink repellent layer is more preferably 1 angstrom to 20 angstroms (0.1 nm to 2<br>
nm). However, from the perspective of reliability, although it depends on an ink<br>
used, the properties of the inkjet head may be maintained for a long time with the use<br>
of a thickly formed water-repellent layer. Thus, in this case, it is preferable that the<br>
thickness be set to 100 angstroms to 200 angstroms (10 nm to 20 nm). Further, on<br>
the surface of the fluorine-based water repellent layer 223, an adhesive tape 224 is<br>
affixed, the adhesive tape 224 is obtained by applying a resin film with an adhesive<br>
material and serves as an auxiliary function at the time of processing with an<br>
i excimer laser. A silicone-based water repellent material can be used as well.<br>
It is preferable that the silicone-based water repellent material be a liquid<br>
silicone resin of room temperature curable type or an elastomer; and any one of the<br>
materials be applied onto a surface of a base, and then left in the air at room<br>
«<br>
temperature so as to be hardened by polymerization, thereby forming an ink repellent<br>
i film (layer) .<br>
The silicone-based water repellent material may also be a liquid silicone<br>
resin of heat curable type or an elastomer; and an ink repellent film (layer) may be<br>
formed by applying any one of the materials onto a surface of a base, and heating the<br>
material so as to be cured.<br><br>
Further, the silicone-based water repellent material may also be a liquid<br>
silicone resin of ultraviolet curable type or an elastomer; and an ink repellent film<br>
(layer) may be formed by applying any one of the materials onto a surface of a base,<br>
and irradiating the material with an ultraviolet ray so as to be cured.<br>
It is preferable that the viscosity of the silicone-based water repellent<br>
material be 1,000 cp (centipoise) or less.<br>
FIG. 21 is a view showing a structure of an excimer laser processor used<br>
for processing nozzle holes. An excimer laser beam 82 emitted from a laser<br>
oscillator 81 is reflected by mirrors 83, 85, and 88 so as to be led to a processing<br>
table 90. In the optical path the laser beam 82 reaches the processing table 90, a<br>
beam expander 84, a mask 86, a field lens 87, and an image forming optical system<br>
89 are arranged at predetermined positions so that an optimum beam reaches a<br>
process target. The process target (nozzle plate) 91 is placed on the processing table<br>
90 and is to be exposed to the laser beam 82. The processing table 90 is an XYZ<br>
table, which has been widely known, and is configured such that the process target<br>
91 can be moved to a desired position if necessary so as to be exposed to a laser<br>
beam. Here, the laser is explained with utilization of an excimer laser, however,<br>
various types of lasers can be used, as long as it is an ultraviolet laser having a short<br>
wavelength, which allows for abrasion processing.<br>
FIGS. 22A to 22F are views showing production steps for producing a<br>
nozzle plate in the production method of an inkjet head of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 22A shows a base of a nozzle-forming component. Here, as a resin<br>
film 221, a polyimide film, CAPTON (product name), which is free of particles,<br>
produced by Dupont Co. is used, for example. In ordinary polyimide films, particles<br><br>
such as SiC&gt;2 (silica) are added in view of handleability (slipperiness) in apparatuses<br>
for handling roll films. When nozzle hole processing is carried out with the use of<br>
excimer laser, processability with excimer laser of SiO2 (silica) particles was poor,<br>
and nozzle deformation may be caused. For this reason, in the present invention, a<br>
i film with no addition of SiO2 (silica) particles is used. As a base material for nozzle<br>
plate, a polyimide film, UPILEX manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd. may be used.<br>
Since particles contained in UPILEX are very fine and do not cause troubles in<br>
processing, the film can be directly used.<br>
FIG. 22B is a view showing a step of forming an SiO2 thin layer 222 on a<br>
i surface of a resin film 221. The SiO2 thin layer 222 is suitably formed by sputtering<br>
in a vacuum chamber, and the thickness thereof is preferably about 1 angstrom to<br>
300 angstroms (0.1 nm to 30 nm). In this embodiment, the SiO2 thin layer 222 is<br>
formed so as to have a thickness of 10 angstroms to 100 angstroms (1 nm to 10 nm).<br>
In the sputtering method, firstly Si is sputtered, and then O2 ion is applied to the Si<br>
i surface, and an SiO2 film (layer) is formed. By the use of this method, the<br>
adhesiveness of the SiO2 layer to the resin film 221 is improved, a homogenous and<br>
dense film can be obtained, and it is more effective in improving the wiping<br>
durability of a water repellent layer.<br><br>
FIG. 22C is a view showing a step of applying a fluorine-based water<br>
 repellant 223a onto the SiO2 thin layer. For the coating method, spin-coater, roll-<br>
coater, screen printing, spray coater can be used, however, a film deposition by<br>
vacuum evaporation is more effective because the adhesiveness of the water<br>
repellent layer can be improved. By forming the SiO2 thin layer 222 in the step of<br>
FIG. 22B, and carrying out the vacuum evaporation in the same vacuum chamber<br><br>
with leaving the workpiece as it is, further favorable effect can be obtained.<br>
Conventionally, after forming an SiO2 thin layer 222, the workpiece has been taken<br>
out once from a vacuum chamber. Thus, it is considered that the adhesiveness is<br>
impaired due to adhesion of impurities to the surface of the SiO2 thin layer. For the<br>
 fluorine-based water repellent material, various materials have been known,<br>
however, in this embodiment, as a fluorine amorphous compound,<br>
perfluoropolyoxetane, modified perfluoropolyoxetane or a mixture thereof is used.<br>
The use of any one of these makes it possible to obtain necessary water repellency.<br>
Note that "OPTOOL DSX" manufactured by Daikin Industries, Ltd. may be referred<br>
 to as "alkoxysilane terminal -modified perfluoropolyether".<br>
FIG. 22D is a view showing a step of leaving the water repellency layer in<br>
the air after evaporation thereof. In this step, the fluorine-based water repellant 223a<br>
and the SiO2 thin layer 222 are chemically bonded each other via moisture content in<br>
the air, thereby forming a fluorine-based water repellent layer 223.<br>
 FIG. 22E is a view showing a step of affixing an adhesive tape 224 to the<br>
water repellency layer. At this point in time, it is necessary to affix the tape 224 so<br>
as not to induce air bubbles. This is because a nozzle hole which is holed at a<br>
position where air bubbles exist tends to degrade in quality due to extraneous matter<br>
induced during processing.<br>
 FIG. 22F is a view showing a step of processing a nozzle hole 244. In this<br>
step, an excimer laser is applied to the workpiece from the polyimide film 221 side<br>
to thereby form the nozzle hole 244. After processing the nozzle hole 244, the<br>
adhesive tape 224 is pealed off. Here, description on a high-stiffness component 225<br>
used for improving the stiffness (rigidity) of the nozzle plate 243, which has been<br><br>
explained in FIG. 20, is omitted. If the high-stiffness component 225 is used in these<br>
process steps, it is advisable to form it between the step shown in FIG. 22D and the<br>
step shown in FIG. 22E.<br>
FIG. 23 is a view showing the outline of an apparatus used when an inkjet<br>
head is manufactured by a method for producing an inkjet head of the present<br>
invention.<br>
This apparatus is manufactured according to a process method called<br>
"Metamode process", which has been developed by OCLI (Optical Coating<br>
Laboratory Inc.) in U.S. and has been used in production of reflection preventive<br>
films and anti-fouling films for display. As shown in FIG. 23, at four locations<br>
around a drum 210, an Si sputter 2O2 serving as a station, an O2 ion gun 203, an Nb<br>
sputter 204, and an OPTOOL deposition 205 are arranged, and all of them are in a<br>
chamber for vacuum deposition. Firstly, Si is sputtered by the Si sputter 2O2. Then,<br>
O2 ions are applied to the Si by the use of the O2 ion gun 203 to produce SiO2.<br>
Subsequently, Nb and OPTOOL DSX are respectively suitably deposited by the Nb<br>
sputter 204 and the OPTOOL deposition 205. When a reflection preventive film is<br>
produced, layers of Nb and SiO2 with a necessary number are stucked in a<br>
predetermined thickness and then deposited. In the present invention, the function of<br>
»<br>
reflection preventive film is not necessary. Therefore, Nb is unnecessary, and it is<br>
necessary only to deposit one SiO2 layer and one OPTOOL DSX layer. As described<br>
above, by using this apparatus, it is possible to carry out vacuum evaporation of<br>
OPTOOL DSX in the same vacuum chamber without moving the workpiece after<br>
forming the SiO2 thin layer 122 in the vacuum chamber.<br>
The critical surface tension of the ink repellent layer is preferably 5 mN/m<br>
to 40 mN/m, and more preferably 5 mN/m to 30 mN/m. When the critical surface<br>
tension is higher than 40 mN/m, an ink becomes excessively wet to the nozzle plate<br>
in the long-time use, and thus when printing operation is repeatedly carried out, ink<br>
ejection curve and abnormal particulation may occur, and when the critical surface<br>
tension is higher than 40 mN/m, an ink becomes excessively wet to the nozzle plate<br>
from the initial stage of printing operation, and therefore ink ejection curve and<br>
abnormal particulation may occur.<br>
Actually, each of ink repellent materials shown in Table 2 was applied onto<br>
i an aluminum base, and the applied material was heated, dried, and thereby a nozzle<br>
plate provided with an ink repellent layer was produced. The critical surface tension<br>
of the ink repellent layer was measured. Table 2 shows the measurement results.<br>
The critical surface tension can be measured by Zisman method.<br>
Specifically, a liquid whose surface tension has been known is dropped on an ink<br>
i repellent layer, a contact angle 6 thereof is measured, the surface tension of the<br>
liquid is polotted along x axis, and cos 9 is plotted along y axis. As a result, a<br>
decreasing straight line can be obtained (Zisman Plot). A surface tension obtained<br>
when Y is equal to 1 (0 = 0) on the straight line can be calculated as a critical surface<br>
tension yc. Besides the Zisman method, the critical surface tension can be calculated<br>
by Fowkes method, Owens and Wendt method, or Van Oss method.<br>
Similarly to the above-mentioned method for producing an inkjet head, an<br>
inkjet head was produced using the the ink repellent layer-provided nozzle plate. A<br>
cyan ink stated below was used in the inkjet head, and the ink was jetted. The ink<br>
jetting process was videographed and observed. As a result, it was confirmed that<br><br>
the ink was normally participated when any of the nozzle plates produced was used,<br>
and there was no problem with the ejection stability. Table 2 shows the test results.<br><br>
In a vessel, 20.0% by mass of copper phthalocyanine pigment-containing<br>
polymer fine particle dispersion, 23.0% by mass of 3-methyl-l,3-butadiol, 8.0% by<br>
mass of glycerine, 2.0% by mass of 2-ethyl-l,3-hexanediol, 2.5% by mass of FS-300<br>
(produced by DuPont Co.) as a fluorochemical surfactant, 0.2% by mass of<br>
PROXEL LV (produced by Avecia) as an antiseptic/antifungal agent, 0.5% by mass<br>
of 2-amino-2-ethyl-l,3-propanediol, and an appropriate amount of ion exchange<br>
water were added so that the total amount thereof was 100% by mass. Thereafter,<br>
the mixture was filtered through a membrane filter having an average pore diameter<br>
of 0.8 \ym. Through the above process, a cyan ink was produced.<br>
Hereinafter, one aspect of performing the ink-jet recording method of<br>
• the present invention by the ink-jet recording apparatus of the present invention will<br>
be explained with reference to the drawings. FIG. 3 is a schematic explanatory view<br>

feed tray 2 for feeding paper that is loaded thereon into the apparatus main body 1, a<br>
paper discharge tray 3 for storing paper which has been loaded into the apparatus<br>
main body 1 and on which images have been recorded (formed), and an ink cartridge<br>
loading section 6. An operation unit 7 composed of operation keys, a display and the<br>
like is placed on the upper surface of the ink cartridge loading section 6. The ink<br>
&gt; cartridge loading section 6 has a front cover 8 capable of opening and closing to<br>

) 5) by a guide rod 11, which is a guide member laterally passed between left and right<br>
side plates (not shown), and a stay 12; and the carriage 13 is moved for scanning in<br>
the direction indicated by the arrow A in FIG. 5 by a main scanning motor (not<br>

installed in the carriage 13 such that a plurality of ink ejection outlets are aligned in<br>
the direction intersecting the main scanning direction and that the ink droplet<br>
ejection direction faces downward.<br>
For each of the ink-jet recording heads composing the recording head 14,<br>
lit is possible to use, for example, a head provided with any of the following actuators<br>
as a energy-generating unit for ejecting a recording ink: a piezoelectric actuator such<br>
as a piezoelectric element, a thermal actuator that uses a thermoelectric conversion<br>
element such as an exothermic resistive element and utilizes phase change caused by<br>
film boiling of a liquid, a shape-memory-alloy actuator that utilizes metal phase<br><br>
change caused by temperature change, and an electrostatic actuator that utilizes<br>
electrostatic force.<br>
Also, the carriage 13 incorporates sub tanks 15 of each color for supplying<br>
the inks of each color to the recording head 14. Each sub tank 15 is supplied and<br>
replenished with the recording ink from the ink cartridge 10 loaded into the ink<br>
cartridge loading section 6 shown in FIG. 3, via a recording ink supply tube (not<br>
shown).<br>
Meanwhile, as a paper feed unit for feeding sheets of paper 22 loaded on a<br>
paper loading section (pressure plate) 21 of the paper feed tray 2, there are provided<br>
a half-moon roller (paper feed roller 23) which feeds the sheets of paper 22 one by<br>
one from the paper loading section 21, and a separation pad 24 which faces the paper<br>
feed roller 23 and is formed of a material with a large friction coefficient. This<br>
separation pad 24 is biased toward the paper feed roller 23 side.<br>
As a conveyance unit for conveying the paper 22, which has been fed from<br>
this paper feed unit, under the recording head 14, there are provided a conveyance<br>
belt 31 for conveying the paper 22 in the conveyance direction (indicated by the<br>
arrow B in FIG. 5) by means of electrostatic adsorption; a counter roller 32 for<br>
conveying the paper 22, which is sent from the paper feed unit via a guide 25, such<br>
that the paper 22 is sandwiched between the counter roller 32 and the conveyance<br>
belt 31; a conveyance guide 33 for making the paper 22, which is sent upward in the<br>
substantially vertical direction, change its direction by approximately 90° and thusly<br>
correspond with the conveyance belt 31; and an end pressurizing roller 35 biased<br>
toward the conveyance belt 31 side by a pressing member 34. Also, there is<br>
provided a charging roller 36 as a charging unit for charging the surface of the<br><br>
conveyance belt 31.<br>
The conveyance belt 31 is an endless belt and is capable of moving in<br>
circles in the belt conveyance direction, spanned between a conveyance roller 37 and<br>
a tension roller 38. On the back of the conveyance belt 31, a guide member 77 is<br>
placed correspondingly to a region where printing is carried out by the recording<br>
head 14. Additionally, as a paper discharge unit for discharging the paper 22 on<br>
which images or the like have been recorded by the recording head 14, there are<br>
provided a separation pawl 51 for separating the paper 22 from the conveyance belt<br>
31, a paper discharge roller 52 and a paper discharge small roller 53, with the paper<br>
discharge tray 3 being placed below the paper discharge roller 52.<br>
A double-sided paper feed unit 61 is mounted on a rear surface portion of<br>
the apparatus main body 1 in a freely detachable manner. The double-sided paper<br>
feed unit 61 takes in the paper 22 returned by rotation of the conveyance belt 31 in<br>
the opposite direction and reverses it, then refeeds it between the counter roller 32<br>
and the conveyance belt 31. Additionally, a manual paper feed unit 62 is provided<br>
on an upper surface of the double-sided paper feed unit 61.<br>
In the ink jet recording apparatus 1, the paper 22 is separated one by one<br>
and fed from the paper feed unit, the paper 22, which is fed upward in the<br>
substantially vertical direction, is guided by the guide 25, and conveyed such that the<br>
paper 22 is sandwiched between the conveyance belt 31 and the counter roller 32.<br>
The distal end of the paper is guided by the conveyance guide 33 and pressed against<br>
the conveyance belt 31 by end pressurizing roller 35, and the conveyance direction<br>
thereof is changed by approximately 90°.<br>
At this point in time, the conveyance belt 31 is charged by the charging<br>
roller 36, and the paper 22 is conveyed by the conveyance belt 31 by means of<br><br>
electrostatic adsorption. By driving the recording head 14 according to the image<br>
signal, while moving the carriage 13, ink droplets are ejected from the recording<br>
head 14 to record information, data or an image for one line on the paper 22 which<br>
remains stationary, and then the paper 22 is conveyed a predetermined distance for<br>
irecording the next line. On receipt of a recording completion signal or such a signal<br>
as indicates that the rear end of the paper 22 has reached the recording region,<br>
recording operation is finished, and the paper 22 is discharged onto the paper<br>
discharge tray 3.<br>
Once the amount of recording ink remaining in the sub tanks 15 has been<br>
detected as too small, a required amount of recording ink is supplied from the ink<br>
cartridge 10 into the sub tanks 15.<br>
It should be noted that although the ink-jet recording method of the present<br>
invention has been explained referring to an example in which it is applied to a<br>
serial-type (shuttle-type) ink-jet recording apparatus where a carriage performs<br>
scanning, the ink-jet recording method of the present invention can also be applied to<br>
line-type ink-jet recording apparatuses provided with line-type heads.<br>
The recording head 14, which is named generically a plural recording<br>
heads) is composed, for example, as shown in FIG. 6, of a liquid droplet ejection<br>
head 14a and a liquid droplet ejection head b. The liquid droplet ejection head 14a<br>
has a nozzle column 14yn composed of a plurality of nozzles N that eject yellow (Y)<br>
ink droplets and a nozzle column 14mn composed of a plurality of nozzles N that<br>
eject magenta (M) ink droplets. The liquid droplet ejection head b has a nozzle<br>
column 14cn composed of a plurality of nozzles N that eject cyan (C) ink droplets<br>
and a nozzle column 14kn composed of a plurality of nozzles N that eject black (Bk)<br>
ink droplets.<br>
It should be noted that FIG. 6 illustrates an example that two color inks are<br>
supplied from two different sub tanks to one recording head, i.e., four color inks of<br>
yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (C), and black (Bk) are supplied from four different<br>
sub tanks to two recording heads, thereby allowing for four-color printing. However,<br>
the following configuration may be employed: four recording heads each having two<br>
nozzle columns are prepared, and each different-color sub tank is allocated to each of<br>
the four recording heads, in other words, with the use of four recording heads each<br>
having two nozzle columns and four sub tanks, thereby allowing for four-color<br>
printing of four color inks of yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (C), and black (Bk).<br>
The example shown in FIG. 6 depicts an inkjet printer (IPSIO G505,<br>
manufactured by Richo Company Ltd.) where nozzles ejecting different color inks<br>
are arranged in columns on one recording head.<br>
In an inkjet printer (IPSIO G707, manufactured by Richo Company Ltd.),<br>
which is not illustrated in the drawings, four recording heads having the same<br>
structure as above are provided, and each color inks of yellow ink, magenta, cyan<br>
and black is supplied to each of the four recording heads.<br>
It is possible to prevent a nozzle section from coming off by performing<br>
idle scanning, in which a piezoelectric element is applied with a voltage having an<br>
intensity by which the ink is not ejected, and to prevent nozzles from coming off by<br>
frequently performing so-called idle ejection, in which ink droplets are ejected in an<br>
ink reservoir. It is preferable to perform idle ejection of ink droplets once during a<br>
time for printing at least one page.<br>
For each of the ink-jet recording heads composing the recording head 14,<br>
it is possible to use, for example, a head provided with any of the following actuators<br>
as a energy-generating unit for ejecting a recording ink: a piezoelectric actuator such<br>
as a piezoelectric element, a thermal actuator that uses a thermoelectric conversion<br>
element such as an exothermic resistive element and utilizes phase change caused by<br>
film boiling of a liquid, a shape-memory-alloy actuator that utilizes metal phase<br>
change caused by temperature change, and an electrostatic actuator that utilizes<br>
electrostatic force. It should be noted that in Examples, which will be described<br>
hereinbelow, inkjet recording heads each using a piezoelectric actuator (a<br>
piezoelectric element) as an energy generation unit are employed.<br>
The carriage 13 incorporates a sub tank 15 (when the color inks are<br>
differentiated from each other, reference numerals 15y, 15m, 15c and 15k are used so<br>
as to correspond to each of the nozzle columns), which is a container for supplying<br>
the inks of each color to each nozzle columns of 14yn, 14mn, 14cn and 14kn of the<br>
recording head 14. Each of the sub tanks 15 is replenished and supplied with each of<br>
the color inks from the main tank (ink cartridge) 10 which houses each of the color<br>
inks (when the color inks are differentiated from each other, reference numerals lOy,<br>
10m, 10c and 10k are used so as to correspond to each of the nozzle columns) via<br>
ink supply tubes 16. Specifically, the main tank 10 houses the inks of each color of<br>
yellow (Y), cyan (C), magenta (M), and black (Bk), however, the main tank 10k<br>
accommodates a much larger amount of ink than in the main tanks lOy, 10m and 10c<br>
which accommodate the color inks other than black color ink.<br>
Hereinafter, the details of an ink supply device being a liquid supply<br>
device in the above-noted recording apparatus will be explained with reference to<br>
FIGS. 7 to 9. FIG. 7 is an exploded perspective view showing a liquid supply<br><br>
device. FIG. 8 is an enlarged exploded perspective view of the liquid supply device<br>
shown in FIG. 7. FIG. 9 is an explanatory side view showing one of the sub tanks.<br>
The ink supply device is composed of subtanks 15 which are liquid supply<br>
containers for supplying inks to the recording head 14 (14a, 14b) with being installed<br>
to the carriage 13, as described above, and main tanks (ink cartridges) 10 for<br>
supplying and replenishing the sub tanks 15 with the inks via supply tubes 16.<br>
In one of the sub tanks 15, to a container main body (case main body) 101<br>
forming an ink housing 100 for housing an ink, a film component having flexibility<br>
(flexible film component) 102 for sealing an opening (one face of the subtank 15) of<br>
the ink housing 100 is affixed with an adhesive or by welding. Further, inside of the<br>
ink housing 100, a spring 103, which is an elastic component for biasing the film<br>
component 102 outward, is provided between the case main body 101 and the film<br>
component 102.<br>
The film component 102 may have a single layer structure, however, as<br>
shown in FIG. 10A, may have a two-layer structure where a first layer 102a and a<br>
second layer 102b composed of different types of materials are laminated, for<br>
example, it may have a laminate structure where film components of polyethylene<br>
and nylon are laminated, or as shown in FIG. 10B, it may have a structure where a<br>
»<br>
silica deposition layer 102c is formed as the first layer 102a. With such a structure,<br>
the liquid resistance to ink can be assuredly ensured. Also, the inclusion of a silica<br>
deposition layer in the film component 102 makes it possible to improve the liquid<br>
resistance to ink to be housed.<br>
The thickness of the film component 102 is preferably 10 µm to 100 µm.<br>
When the thickness is less than 10 µm, damage attributable to deterioration with<br><br>
time is like to occur, and when the thickness is more than 100 (im, the flexibility<br>
thereof degrades and it may be difficult to efficiently generate negative pressure.<br>
On the film component 102, a bulge 102a being a convex along the spring<br>
103 is formed, and a reinforcing member 104 is further affixed to the exterior surface<br>
of the film component 102, corresponding to the bulge portion. By providing the<br>
convex on the flexible film component 102, the elastic component (spring) 103 can<br>
be held in a stable manner. In this case, it is possible to readily form a convex on the<br>
flexible film component 102 by forming a convex on a sheet film component.<br>
Further, to the case main body 101, an ink introduction path section 111 is<br>
provided to supply ink, and a connection unit 112 for connecting the ink introduction<br>
path section 111 to the ink supply tube 16, which is connected to the ink cartridge 10,<br>
is detachably mounted.<br>
Between the ink cartridge 10 and the sub tank 15, a liquid sending pump as<br>
described below is provided so as to pressure-send the ink from the ink cartridge 10<br>
to the sub tank 15.<br>
Further, a connecting member 113 is attached to the downside of the case<br>
main body 101 so as to supply the ink from the ink housing 100 to the recording<br>
head 14. On the connecting member 113, an ink supply paths 114 are formed from<br>
the recording head 14, and a filter 115 is provided between the connecting member<br>
113 and the ink housing 100.<br>
In addition, the upper part of the case main body 101, an air flow passage<br>
121 for discharging air from the ink housing 100 is formed. The air flow passage<br>
121 includes an inlet flow passage part 122 whose port faces the ink housing 100 and<br>
a flow passage part 123 (referred to as "orthogonal flow passage part") led from the<br><br>
the inlet flow passage part 122. The air flow passage 121 is communicated with an<br>
air release hole 131 provided to the case main body 101 at the downstream side, and<br>
at the place downstream the air release hole 131, in a state of use, a storage section<br>
126 is formed in continuation of the air release hole 131.<br>
In the air release hole 131, an air release valve mechanism 132 for<br>
switching between a sealed state and an air released state of inside the sub tank 15 is<br>
provided. The air release valve mechanism 132 is structured such that a valve seat<br>
134, a ball 135 serving as a valving element and a spring 136 for biasing the ball 135<br>
toward the valve seat 134 are housed in a holder 133.<br>
Hereinafter, the function of the storage section 126 will be explained.<br>
When the main body of the liquid supply device is tilted or swung, an ink is highly<br>
likely to intrude into the air flow passage 121. Then, the storage section 126 is<br>
structured such that the ink entered from the air flow passage 121 can be stored<br>
therein, thereby preventing the air release valve mechanism 132 from causing<br>
defective operation. For example, even when the liquid supply device is dropped<br>
during transportation and ink intrudes into the air flow passage, the ink is to intrude<br>
into the air release hole 131 and into the air release valve mechanism 132 configured<br>
to open and close the air release hole 131 and to set therein.<br>
»<br>
On the top of the case main body 101, two detection electrodes 141 and<br>
142 for detecting that the amount of ink remaining in the sub-tanks 15 has been too<br>
small (this state is called "ink near-end") are mounted. A conduction state between<br>
the detection electrodes 141 and 142 changes depending on a difference between a<br>
state where both the detection electrodes 141 and 142 are soaked in an ink and a<br>
state where at least one of them is not soaked in the ink, thereby the state of "ink<br>
near-end" can be detected.<br>
The inkjet recording apparatus of the present invention is, as shown in<br>
FIGS. 11 and 12, equipped with a nozzle condition maintenance/recovery<br>
mechanism (hereinafter, may be referred to as "sub-system") 71 which maintains and<br>
recovers the nozzle condition of the recording head 14 and is placed in a non-<br>
printing area, which is one side (or both sides) of the scanning direction of the<br>
carriage 13. FIG. 11 is a top view of the condition maintenance/recovery<br>
mechanism, and FIG. 12 is a schematic explanatory view showing one example of<br>
units for maintaining the inkjet recording apparatus. The sub-system 71 is equipped<br>
with capping member 72A and 72B for capping each of nozzle surfaces of recording<br>
heads 14a and 14b, a wiper blade for wiping the nozzle surfaces. An idle ejection<br>
receiver is provided between the capping members 72A and the wiper blade 73 at the<br>
time when an ink is ejected. The idle ejection receiver is structured so that ink is<br>
ejected therein and flows downstream to a waste liquid tank. Because ink is likely to<br>
adhere to the place where ink is ejected, a wiper is provided so as to automatically<br>
scrape off adhered ink.<br>
Hereinbelow, the condition maintenance/recovery mechanism 71 relating<br>
i<br>
to the inkjet recording apparatus of the present invention will be further described in<br>
detail.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 11 and 12, when a motor 231 normally rotates, a pump<br>
gear 233, an intermediate gear 234, an intermediate gear 235 and an intermediate<br>
gear 236 are driven to rotate, and a tube pump 220 is activated to suck the inside of<br>
the rightmost cap (on the side of recording area) which is connected with the pump<br><br>
220 and a tube 219. Gears other than those mentioned above are not activated<br>
because a one-direction clutch 237 as an operating thereof is disconnected.<br>
When the motor 231 rotates in a reverse direction, the one-direction clutch<br>
_237 is connected, functions connected from the motor to a cam shaft rotate,<br>
i Although the tube pump 220 rotates in a reverse direction, it is configured so that it<br>
is not actuated as a pump.<br>
To a cum shaft 221, a carriage lock-cum 227, cap-cums 222B and 222A, a<br>
wiper cum 224, a wiper cleaner cum 228 and a home position sensor cum 241 are<br>
mounted so as to integrally rotate.<br>
i A carriage lock 215 is biased upward (in the locking direction) by a<br>
compression spring (not shown). The carriage lock 215 is moved up and down by a<br>
carriage lock arm 217 that makes contact with the cum surface of the carriage lock-<br>
cum 227.<br>
Caps 72A and 72B and a cap holder 212A are moved up and down by the<br>
. cap-cums 222a and 222B.<br>
A wiper 73 is moved up and down by the wiper cum 224.<br>
A wiper cleaner 218 is biased in a direction away from the wiper 73 by a<br>
spring and moves in the wiping direction by the wiper cleaner cum 228. The wiper<br>
*<br>
73 descends down while being sandwiched by the wiper cleaner 218 and the idle<br>
ejection receiver, thereby the ink adhering to the wiper 73 is scraped off into the idle<br>
ejection receiver.<br>
To the main body of the condition maintenance/recovery unit, a sensor<br>
(photo-interruptor/not shown) is fixed, and the unit is configured such that when the<br>
caps come to the lowest end by the home position sensor cum 241, an HP lever is<br><br>
made to work, the sensor is in an open state to thereby detect the home position of a<br>
motor (except for the motor of the pump).<br>
When the power source is on, the caps 72A and 72B are moved up and<br>
down irrespective of the positions of the cap holders 212Aand 212B (the positions<br>
are not detected until the movement starts), the home positions of the caps 72A and<br>
72B are detected (during ascending), subsequently, they move a predetermined<br>
distance toward the lowest end. Thereafter, the carriage moves left and right to<br>
detect the positions of the caps, then comes back to the place where the caps are<br>
positioned, and then capped.<br>
As the sequential order of the motor when it rotates in the reverse<br>
direction, the caps ascend (the carriage lock ascends at a substantially same timing),<br>
the caps descend (the carriage lock descends at a substantially same timing), the<br>
home position sensor is opened, the wipe ascends, the wiper cleaner starts its<br>
operation (to press the wiper against the idle ejection receiver), the wiper descends<br>
initial position. The series of the operations are repeated.<br>
The inkjet recording apparatus and the inkjet recording method of the<br>
present invention can be used in various fileds of recording based on inkjet recording<br>
method, and can be particularly suitably used, for example, in inkjet recording<br>
i printers, facsimiles, copiers, printer/facsimile/copier complex apparatuses.<br>
(Ink Media Set)<br>
An ink media set of the present invention includes the recording ink of the<br>
present invention and a recording medium and further includes other components in<br>
accordance with the necessity.<br><br><br>
The recording medium has a support, and a coating layer applied onto at<br>
least one surface of the support and further has other layers in accordance with the<br>
necessity.<br>
In the recording medium, the amount of purified water transferred to the<br>
recording medium for a contact period of 100 ms measured by a dynamic scanning<br>
absorptometer is 2 mL/m2 to 35 mL/m2, and more preferably 2 mL/m2 to 10 mL/m2.<br>
When the amount of pure water transferred to the recording medium for a<br>
contact period of 100 ms is too small, ink beading is likely to occur, and the transfer<br>
amount is too large, the ink dot diameter after recorded may become too smaller than<br>
the desired dot diameter.<br>
The amount of pure water transferred to the recording medium for a<br>
contact period of 400 ms measured by a dynamic scanning absorptometer is 3 mL/m2<br>
to 40 mL/m2, and more preferably 3 mL/m2 to 10 mL/m2.<br>
When the transfer amount for a contact period of 400 ms is too small, spur<br>
trace is likely to occur, and the transfer amount is too large, the glossiness of image<br>
portions that have been dried is liable to degrade.<br>
Here, the dynamic scanning absorptometer (DSA, Japan TAPPI Journal,<br>
«<br>
vol. 48, May 1994, pp. 88-92, Shigenori Kuga) is an apparatus which can precisely<br>
measure the amount of liquid absorbed in a very short period of time. The dynamic<br>
scanning absorptometer automatically conducts the measurement by a method in<br>
which the rate of liquid absorption is directly read on the basis of the transfer of a<br>
meniscus in a capillary, a sample is shaped like a disc, a liquid absorption head is<br>
spirally moved for scanning on the sample, the scanning rate is automatically<br><br>
changed in accordance with a preset pattern, and measurement is repeated according<br>
to the required number of points per sample. A head for supplying liquid to a paper<br>
sample is connected to the capillary via a Teflon (trademark) tube, and the position<br>
of the meniscus in the capillary is automatically read by an optical sensor.<br>
Specifically, the amount of purified water transferred was measured using a dynamic<br>
scanning absorptometer (K350 series, type D, manufactured by Kyowaseiko<br>
Corporation). The transfer amount for a contact period of 100ms and the transfer<br>
amount for a contact period of 400ms can be calculated by means of interpolation<br>
based upon the measurement values of the transfer amounts at contact periods close<br>
to the above-mentioned contact periods.<br>
- Support -<br>
The support is not particularly limited and may be suitably selected in<br>
accordance with the intended use. Examples thereof include paper made mainly<br>
from wood fiber, and sheet-like materials such as unwoven fabrics made mainly<br>
from wood fiber and synthetic fiber.<br>
The paper is not particularly limited and may be suitably selected from<br>
known materials in accordance with the intended use. For instance, wood pulp or<br>
recycled pulp is used therefor. Examples of the wood pulp include leaf bleached<br>
kraft pulp (LBKP), needle bleached kraft pulp (NBKP), NBSP, LBSP, GP and TMP.<br>
Examples of the raw material for the recycled pulp include articles shown<br>
in the "Used Paper Standard Quality Specification List" released by Paper Recycling<br>
Promotion Center, such as high-quality white paper, white paper with lines and<br>
marks, cream-colored paper, card, medium-quality white paper, low-quality white<br>
paper, simili paper, white-colored paper, Kent paper, white art paper, medium-quality<br><br>
colored paper, low-quality colored paper, newspaper and magazine. Specific<br>
examples thereof include used paperboards and used papers of the following papers:<br>
printer papers such as uncoated computer paper, thermosensitive paper and pressure-<br>
sensitive paper that are related to information; OA (office automation) related papers<br>
such as paper for PPC (plain paper copier); coated papers such as art paper, coated<br>
paper, finely'coated paper and matte paper; and uncoated papers such as high-quality<br>
paper, high color quality paper, notebook, letter paper, packing paper, fancy paper,<br>
medium-quality paper, newspaper, woody paper, super wrapping paper, simili paper,<br>
pure white roll paper and milk carton. More specific examples thereof include<br>
i chemical pulp paper and high-yield pulp-containing paper. Each of these may be<br>
used alone or in combination.<br>
The recycled pulp is generally produced by a combination of the following<br>
four steps.<br>
(1) Defibration: used paper is treated with mechanical force and chemicals<br>
i using a pulper and thusly fiberized, and printing ink is separated from the fiber.<br>
(2) Dust removal: foreign matter (plastic, etc.) and dust contained in the used<br>
paper is removed by a screen, a cleaner or the like.<br>
(3) Ink removal: the printing ink that has been separated from the fiber using a<br>
surfactant is removed from the system by a flotation method or washing method.<br>
i(4) Bleaching: the whiteness of the fiber is enhanced utilizing oxidation or<br>
reduction.<br>
When the recycled pulp is mixed with other pulp, it is desirable that the<br>
mixture ratio of the recycled pulp in the whole pulp be 40% or less so as to prevent<br>
curl after recording.<br><br>
For an internally added filler used in the support, a conventionally known<br>
pigment as a white pigment is used, for instance. Examples of the white pigment<br>
include white inorganic pigments such as light calcium carbonate, heavy calcium<br>
carbonate, kaolin, clay, talc, calcium sulfate, barium sulfate, titanium dioxide, zinc<br>
oxide, zinc sulfide, zinc carbonate, satin white, aluminum silicate, diatomaceous<br>
earth, calcium silicate, magnesium silicate, synthetic silica, aluminum hydroxide,<br>
alumina, lithopone, zeolite, magnesium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide; and<br>
organic pigments such as styrene-based plastic pigments, acrylic plastic pigments,<br>
polyethylene, microcapsules, urea resins and melamine resins. Each of these may be<br>
used alone or in combination.<br>
Examples of an internally added sizing agent used in producing the<br>
support include neutral rosin sizing agents used in neutral papermaking, alkenyl<br>
succinic anhydrides (ASA), alkyl ketene dimers (AKD) and petroleum resin sizing<br>
agents. Among these, neutral rosin sizing agents and alkenyl succinic anhydrides are<br>
particularly suitable. Although any of the alkyl ketene dimers only needs to be<br>
added in small amounts due to its strong sizing effect, it may be unfavorable in terms<br>
of conveyance at the time of ink-jet recording because the friction coefficient of a<br>
recording paper (medium) surface decreases and the surface easily becomes slippery.<br>
»<br>
- Coating Layer -<br>
The coating layer includes a pigment and a binder, and further includes a<br>
surfactant and other components in accordance with the necessity.<br>
For the pigment, an inorganic pigment or a combination of an inorganic<br>
pigment and an organic pigment can be used.<br>
Examples of the inorganic pigment include kaolin, talc, heavy calcium<br><br>
carbonate, light calcium carbonate, calcium sulfite, amorphous silica, titanium white,<br>
magnesium carbonate, titanium dioxide, aluminum hydroxide, calcium hydroxide,<br>
magnesium hydroxide, zinc hydroxide and chlorites. Among these, kaolin is<br>
particularly preferable in that it is superior in gloss developing property and makes it<br>
possible to yield a texture which approximates that of paper for offset printing.<br>
Examples of the kaolin include delaminated kaolin, calcined kaolin, and<br>
engineered kaolin produced by surface modification or the like. In view of gloss<br>
developing property, it is desirable that 50% by mass or more of the whole kaolin be<br>
occupied by kaolin having a particle size distribution in which 80% by mass or more<br>
of the particles are 2jim or less in diameter.<br>
The amount of the kaolin added is preferably 50 parts by mass or more<br>
based on 100 parts by mass of the binder. When the amount is less than 50 parts by<br>
mass, sufficient effectiveness may not be obtained with respect to glossiness.<br>
Although the maximum value of the amount is not particularly limited, it is desirable<br>
in terms of coating suitability that the amount be 90 parts by mass or less, in view of<br>
the kaolin's fluidity, especially thickening properties in the presence of high shearing<br>
force.<br>
Examples of the organic pigment include water-soluble dispersions<br>
containing styrene-acrylic copolymer particles, styrene-butadiene copolymer<br>
particles, polystyrene particles, polyethylene particles, etc. Each of these organic<br>
pigments may be used in combination.<br>
The amount of the organic pigment added is preferably 2 parts by mass to<br>
20 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of the whole pigment of the coating<br>
layer. The organic pigment is superior in gloss developing property and smaller in<br><br>
specific gravity than an inorganic pigment, thereby making it possible to obtain a<br>
coating layer which is bulky, highly glossy and excellent in surface coating property.<br>
When the amount is less than 2 parts by mass, such effects cannot be obtained.<br>
When it is greater than 20 parts by mass, the fluidity of a coating solution degrades,<br>
which leads to decrease in coating operationality and which is economically<br>
unfavorable as well.<br>
Examples of the form of the organic pigment include dense type, hollow<br>
type and doughnut type. However, in light of a balance among the gloss developing<br>
property, the surface coating property, and the fluidity of the coating solution, it is<br>
desirable that the average particle diameter be 0.2 (im to 3.0 jim, and it is further<br>
desirable to employ a hollow type with a void ratio of 40% or more.<br>
For the binder, an aqueous resin is preferably used.<br>
For the aqueous resin, at least either a water-soluble resin or a water-<br>
dispersible resin can be suitably used. The water-soluble resin is not particularly<br>
limited and may be suitably selected in accordance with the intended use. Examples<br>
thereof include polyvinyl alcohol and modified products of polyvinyl alcohol such as<br>
anion-modified polyvinyl alcohol, cation-modified polyvinyl alcohol and acetal-<br>
modified polyvinyl alcohol; polyurethane; polyvinylpyrrolidone and modified<br>
»<br>
products of polyvinylpyrrolidone such as copolymers of polyvinylpyrrolidone and<br>
vinyl acetate, copolymers of vinylpyrrolidone and dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate,<br>
copolymers of quaternized vinylpyrrolidone and dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate<br>
and copolymers of vinylpyrrolidone and methacrylamide propyl trimethyl<br>
ammonium chloride; celluloses such as carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl<br>
cellulose and hydroxypropyl cellulose; modified products of cellulose such as<br><br>
cationated hydroxyethyl cellulose; synthetic resins such as polyester, polyacrylic<br>
acid (ester), melamine resins, modified products thereof, and copolymers of<br>
polyester and polyurethane; and poly(meth)acrylic acid, poly(meth)acrylamide,<br>
oxidized starch, phosphoric acid-esterified starch, self-modifying starch, cationated<br>
starch, various types of modified starch, polyethylene oxide, sodium polyacrylate<br>
and sodium alginate. Each of these may be used alone or in combination.<br>
Among these, polyvinyl alcohol, cation-modified polyvinyl alcohol,<br>
acetal-modified polyvinyl alcohol, polyester, polyurethane, copolymers of polyester<br>
and polyurethane, and the like are particularly preferable in terms of ink absorption.<br>
The water-dispersible resin is not particularly limited and may be suitably<br>
selected in accordance with the intended use. Examples thereof include polyvinyl<br>
acetate, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers, polystyrene, styrene-(meth)acrylic acid<br>
ester copolymers, (meth)acrylic acid ester polymers, vinyl acetate-(meth)acrylic acid<br>
(ester) copolymers, styrene-butadiene copolymers, ethylene-propylene copolymers,<br>
polyvinyl ethers and silicone-acrylic copolymers. Also, the water-dispersible resin<br>
may contain a crosslinking agent such as methylolated melamine, methylolated urea,<br>
methylolated hydroxypropylene urea or isocyanate or may be a copolymer with self-<br>
crosslinking ability that includes N-methylolacrylamide or other unit. A plurality of<br>
these aqueous resins can be used at the same time.<br>
The amount of the aqueous resin added is preferably 2 parts by mass to<br>
100 parts by mass, more preferably 3 parts by mass to 50 parts by mass, based on<br>
100 parts by mass of the pigment. The amount of the aqueous resin added is<br>
determined such that the liquid absorption properties of the recording medium are<br>
within a desired range.<br><br>
When a water-dispersible colorant is used as the colorant, a cationic<br>
organic compound is not necessarily required, and a cationic organic compound is<br>
not particularly limited and may be suitably selected in accordance with the intended<br>
use. Examples thereof include monomers, oligomers and polymers of primary to<br>
tertiary amines that form insoluble salts by reacting with functional groups such as<br>
sulfonic acid group, carboxyl group and amino group in direct dye or acid dye<br>
present in water-soluble ink; and monomers, oligomers and polymers of quaternary<br>
ammonium salts. Among these, oligomers and polymers are preferable.<br>
Examples of the cationic organic compound include dimethylamine-<br>
epichlorhydrin polycondensates, dimethylamine-ammonia-epichlorhydrin<br>
condensates, poly(trimethylaminoethyl methacrylate-methylsulfate), diallylamine<br>
hydrochloride-acrylamide copolymers, poly(diallylamine hydrochloride-sulfur<br>
dioxide), polyallylamine hydrochloride, poly(allylamine hydrochloride-diallylamine<br>
hydrochloride), acrylamide-diallylamine copolymers, polyvinylamine copolymers,<br>
dicyandiamide, dicyandiamide-ammonium chloride-urea-formaldehyde condensates,<br>
polyalkylene polyamine-dicyandiamide ammonium salt condensates,<br>
dimethyldiallylammonium chloride, polydiallylmethylamine hydrochloride,<br>
poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride), poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride-<br>
?<br>
sulfur dioxide), poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride-diallylamine hydrochloride<br>
derivatives), acrylamide-diallyldimethylammonium chloride copolymers, acrylate-<br>
acrylamide-diallylamine hydrochloride copolymers, polyethylenimine, ethylenimine<br>
derivatives such as acrylamine polymers, and modified products of polyethylenimine<br>
alkylene oxides. Each of these may be used alone or in combination.<br>
Among these, any one of low-molecular cationic organic compounds such<br><br>
as dimethylamine-epichlorhydrin polycondensates and polyallylamine hydrochloride<br>
and any one of relatively high-molecular cationic organic compounds such as<br>
poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) are preferably combined together. The<br>
combination makes it possible to increase image density more than in the case of<br>
independent use and further reduce feathering.<br>
The cation equivalent of the cationic organic compound measured in<br>
accordance with a colloid titration method (using potassium polyvinyl sulfate and<br>
toluidine blue) is preferably 3meq/g to 8meq/g. When the cation equivalent is in this<br>
range, a favorable result can be obtained with respect to the range of the amount of<br>
the cationic organic compound dried and attached.<br>
Here, in the measurement of the cation equivalent in accordance with the<br>
colloid titration method, the cationic organic compound is diluted with distilled<br>
water such that the solid content stands at 0.1% by mass, and pH adjustment is not<br>
made.<br>
The amount of the cationic organic compound dried and attached is<br>
preferably 0.3g/m2 to 2.0g/m2. When the amount of the cationic organic compound<br>
dried and attached is less than 0.3g/m2, such effects as sufficient increase in image<br>
density and reduction in feathering may not be obtained.<br>
The surfactant is not particularly limited and may be suitably selected in<br>
accordance with the intended use, and any one of an anionic surfactant, a cationic<br>
surfactant, an amphoteric surfactant and a nonionic surfactant can be used therefor.<br>
Among these, a nonionic surfactant is particularly preferable. By addition of the<br>
surfactant, the water resistance of images improves, image density increases, and<br>
bleeding can be reduced.<br><br>
Examples of the nonionic surfactant include higher alcohol ethylene oxide<br>
adducts, alkylphenol ethylene oxide adducts, fatty acid ethylene oxide adducts,<br>
polyhydric alcohol fatty acid ester ethylene oxide adducts, higher aliphatic amine<br>
ethylene oxide adducts, fatty acid amide ethylene oxide adducts, ethylene oxide<br>
adducts of fats, polypropylene glycol ethylene oxide adducts, fatty acid esters of<br>
glycerol, fatty acid esters of pentaerythritol, fatty acid esters of sorbitol and sorbitan,<br>
fatty acid esters of sucrose, alkyl ethers of polyhydric alcohols, and fatty acid amides<br>
of alkanolamines. Each of these may be used alone or in combination.<br>
The polyhydric alcohols are not particularly limited and may be suitably<br>
selected in accordance with the intended use. Examples thereof include glycerol,<br>
trimethylolpropane, pentaerythrite, sorbitol and sucrose. As to the ethylene oxide<br>
adducts, ones in which an alkylene oxide, for example propylene oxide or butylene<br>
oxide, is substituted for part of ethylene oxide to such an extent that their water<br>
solubility can be maintained are also effective. The substitution ratio is preferably<br>
150% or less. The HLB (hydrophile-lipophile balance) of the nonionic surfactant is<br>
preferably 4 to 15, more preferably 7 to 13.<br>
The amount of the surfactant added is preferably 0 parts by mass to 10<br>
parts by mass, more preferably 0.1 parts by mass to 1.0 part by mass, based on 100<br>
»<br>
parts by mass of the cationic organic compound.<br>
Further, other components may be added to the coating layer in accordance<br>
with the necessity, to such an extent that the object and effects of the present<br>
invention are not impaired. Examples of the other components include additives<br>
such as alumina powder, a pH adjuster, an antiseptic agent and an antioxidant.<br>
The method for forming the coating layer is not particularly limited and<br><br>
may be suitably selected in accordance with the intended use. For instance, a<br>
method in which the support is impregnated or coated with a coating layer solution<br>
can be employed. The method of impregnating or coating the support with the<br>
coating layer solution is not particularly limited and may be suitably selected in<br>
accordance with the intended use. For instance, the impregnation or the coating can<br>
be carried out using a coating machine such as a conventional size press, gate roll<br>
size press, film transfer size press, blade coater, rod coater, air knife coater, curtain<br>
coater or the like. Among these, in view of cost, the support is preferably<br>
impregnated or coated with the coating layer solution using a conventional size<br>
press, gate roll size press, film transfer size press, etc. installed in a papermaking<br>
machine, and finished using an on-machine coater.<br>
The amount of the coating layer solution applied is not particularly limited<br>
and may be suitably selected in accordance with the intended use. It is preferably<br>
0.5g/m2 to 20g/m2, more preferably lg/m2 to 15g/m2, as a solid content.<br>
If necessary, the coating layer solution may be dried after the impregnation<br>
or the coating, in which case the drying temperature is not particularly limited and<br>
may be suitably selected in accordance with the intended use, however, the range of<br>
approximately 100°C to 250°C is preferable.<br>
The recording medium may further include a back layer formed on the<br>
back surface of the support, and other layers formed between the support and the<br>
coating layer and between the support and the back layer. It is also possible to<br>
provide a protective layer on the coating layer. Each of these layers may be<br>
composed of a single layer or a plurality of layers.<br>
Commercially available coated paper for offset printing, commercially<br>
available coated paper for gravure printing, or the like may be used for the recording<br>
medium, besides media for ink-jet recording, provided that its liquid absorption<br>
properties are within the above-mentioned ranges of the present invention.<br>
(Ink Recorded Matter)<br>
An ink recorded matter on which an image, information or data is recorded<br>
by means of the inkjet recording apparatus and the inkjet recording method of the<br>
present invention is an ink recorded matter of the present invention. The ink<br>
recorded matter has an image that has been formed on a recording medium using the<br>
recording ink of the present invention.<br>
The recording medium is not particularly limited and may be suitably<br>
selected in accordance with the intended use. Examples thereof include regular<br>
paper, coated paper for printing, glossy paper, specific paper, fabrics, films, and OHP<br>
sheets. These may be used alone or in combination. Among these recording media,<br>
at least any one of regular paper and coated paper for printing is preferable.<br>
Regular papers are advantageous in their inexpensiveness. Coat papers for<br>
printing are advantageous in that they are relatively inexpensive as compared to<br>
glossy papers and can give a smooth and glossy image, but the drying property<br>
thereof is poor and it has been difficult to use with a commonly used ink. However,<br>
the drying property of coated paper has become able to improve by using the<br>
recording ink of the present invention.<br>
The coated papers for printing are recording media each of which has a<br>
support and a coating layer applied onto at least one surface of the support, in which<br>
the amount of pure water transferred to the recording medium for a contact period of<br><br>
100 ms measured by a dynamic scanning absorptometer is 2 mL/m2 to 35 mL/m2,<br>
and the amount of pure water transferred to the recording medium for a contact<br>
period of 400 ms is 3 mL/m2 to 40 mL/m2. These transfer amounts are low as<br>
compared to those of commercially available conventional inkjet papers. In other<br>
words, the liquid absorbability of the coated paper for printing is lower than those of<br>
the conventional inkjet papers.<br>
Of these coated papers for printing, it is particularly effective to to use the<br>
recording ink of the present invention on a recording medium which has a relatively<br>
high liquid absorbability. Specifically, the amount of pure water transferred to the<br>
recording medium for a contact period of 100 ms measured by a dynamic scanning<br>
absorptometer is 7 mL/m2 to 20 mL/m2, and the amount of pure water transferred to<br>
the recording medium for a contact period of 400 ms is 9 mL/m2 to 30 mL/m2.<br>
When the transfer amount of a liquid for a contact period of 100 ms is<br>
lower than the above noted range, ink beading is likely to occur, and when the<br>
transfer amount is higher than the above noted range, the ink dot diameter after<br>
recorded may become too smaller than the desired dot diameter. The transfer<br>
amount of liquid for a contact period of 400 ms is lower than the above noted range,<br>
spur trace is likely to occur due to insufficient drying property, and the glossiness of<br>
image portions that have been dried is liable to degrade. Note that these phenomena<br>
relates to the drying time, and the recording ink of the present invention in which the<br>
amount of the liquid component having a high boiling point is within an appropriate<br>
range can exhibit an effect in improving the drying property to some extent even<br>
when recorded on paper of which the transfer amount of a liquid is lower than the<br>
above noted range. These papers having low liquid absorbability are commercially<br>
available as coated paper for gravure printing.<br>
The ink recorded matters have high image quality, cause less ink bleeding,<br>
are excellent in stability with time, and can be suitably used for various applications,<br>
as documents with various printed letters (characters) or images recorded on their<br>
surfaces thereof.<br>

Hereinafter, the present invention will be further described in detail<br>
referring to specific Examples, however, the present invention is not limited to the<br>
disclosed Examples. On the contrary, the present invention is intended to cover<br>
various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and<br>
scope of the appended claims. »<br>

Next, the surface tension, pH and viscosity of the recording inks obtained<br>
in each of Examples 1 to 8 and Comparative Examples 1 to 5 were measured as<br>
described below. Table 3 shows the measurement results.<br><br>
The pH of each of the recording inks was measured at 23°C by means of a<br>
pH meter (Model HM3A, manufactured by Toa Denpa Kogyo K.K.).<br><br>
The viscosity of each of the recording inks was measured using a<br>
viscometer (Model RE500, manufactured by TOKI SANGYO CO., LTD.) using a<br>
cone 34xR24, at 180 rpm, at the timing of 3 minutes later of the start of the<br>
measurement, at a temperature of 25°C.<br><br>

Next, an inkjet printing test was carried out according to the following<br>
manner using each of the recording inks of Examples 1 to 8 and Comparative<br>
Examples 1 to 5.<br>
i <br>
Each of the recording inks obtained was jet-printed using an inkjet printer<br>
(GX5000, manufactured by Ricoh Company Ltd.). On a nozzle plate surface of the<br>
inkjet printer, a silicone resin film (room temperature-curable silicone resin, SR2411,<br>
produced by DOW CORNING TORAY SILICONE CO., LTD.) was provided, the<br>
i thickness of the resin film was 1.2 |im, the surface roughness (Ra) was 0.18 (im, and<br>
the critical surface tenstion was 21.6 mN/m. The inkjet printing was carried out at a<br>
temperature of 23°C, a relative humidity of 50%, with the use of high-grade regular<br>
paper/fine mode. The drive waveform of an inkjet head was adjusted so that the<br>
amount of each ink ejected became constant.<br>
 As a recording medium, the after-mentioned coated paper for gravure<br>
printing was used. The amount of pure water transferred to the paper for gravure<br>
printing (to the recording medium) measured by a dynamic scanning absorptometer<br>
for a contact time of 100 ms was 8.5 mL/m2, and the amount of pure water<br>
transferred to the recording medium measured by a dynamic scanning absorptometer<br><br>
for a contact time of 400 ms was 14.8 mL/m2. The transfer amount of pure water<br>
was measured at 23°C and 50%RH.<br><production of coated paper for gravure printing><br>
Hydroxyether derived from potato starch (SOLVICOTE 100, produced by<br>
Avebe Inc.) was gelatinized to prepare a starch solution with a concentration of 13%,<br>
and a no-sized, acid-free pressed paper having a basis weight of 76g/m2 and an ash<br>
content of 13% was coated with the starch solution of 60°C on both sides thereof<br>
using a transfer-type roll coater so that the amount of the solid content adhered was<br>
0.3g/m2. This size-pressed paper was dried, followed by a super-calender treatment<br>
in which the front surface and back surface of the size-pressed paper were coated<br>
with a coating solution by means of a blade coater to form a coat layer so that the<br>
dried solid content for each of the coat layers was 12g/m2. The coating solution was<br>
prepared-so that 2 parts of starch (MS-4600, produced by Nihon Shokuhin Kako Co.,<br>
Ltd.) and 7 parts of a latex (L-1457, produced by Asahi Kasei Corporation) with 100<br>
parts of a pigment.<br>
Subsequently, beading, image drying property, ejection stability in inkjet<br>
printing test, and inkjet printing test results after long-time stoppage of printing<br>
operation of each of obtained image prints were evaluated in accordance with the<br>
following manner. Table 4 shows the evaluation results.<br><br>
The presence or absence of beading in a cyan or green-color solid image<br>
portion was visually observed and evaluated based on the following criteria.<br>
[Evaluation criteria]<br>
A: No beading occurred, and thus a uniform print was obtained.<br><br>
B: A slight tendency of beading was observed.<br>
C: The occurrence of beading was clearly observed.<br>
D: The occurrence of beading in a considerable amount of beading was<br>
observed.<br>
E: The occurrence of beading in a substantial amount was observed.<br><br>
A cyan-color solid image of 12 cm square was printed, and 10 seconds<br>
later, a filter paper was applied to the solid image portion, and the amount of the<br>
cyan ink transferred to the filter paper was evaluated based on the following levels of<br>
the drying property.<br>
[Level of Drying Property]<br>
Level 1 .....A large amount of the ink was transferred to a filter paper.<br>
Level 2.....A relatively large amount of the ink was transferred to a filter<br>
paper.<br>
Level 3......A small amount of the ink was transferred to a filter paper.<br>
Level 4.....A slightly amount of the ink was transferred to a filter paper<br>
when observed closely.<br>
Level 5......The ink was not transferred at all to a filter paper.<br>
test (evaluation of short-term reliability) &gt;<br>
Under the environment of a temperature of 25°C and a relative humidity of<br>
20%, each of the recording inks of Examples and Comparative Examples was set at<br>
an inkjet printer (GX5000, manufactured by Ricoh Company Ltd.) and then the<br>
intermittent ejection stability of each of the inks was evaluated. Firstly, a nozzle<br><br>
check pattern was recorded, and it was confirmed that no nozzle clogging was<br>
caused. Then, an idle scanning operation of the carriage was executed without<br>
ejecting the ink for 30 seconds. After that, the ink was dropped and printed on an<br>
inkjet matte coated paper while jetting 20 droplets of the ink from each of all<br>
nozzles, and then a recovery operation was carried out (purged 50 droplets). A series<br>
of the above operations was repeated 10 times, thereby evaluating the ejection<br>
stability of each of the recording inks. Enlarged photographs of dots formed by 20<br>
droplets, in particular, a dot formed by a first droplet dropped, were taken during<br>
printing. The obtained photographs were visually observed, and the jetting state<br>
(presence or absence of ejected ink, inkjet direction) was evaluated based on the<br>
following criteria.<br>
[Criteria for judgment in evaluation of inkjet direction of dot formed by first droplet]<br>
A.....There was no change in the orbit of the ejected ink and nozzles were<br>
arranged in a row.<br>
B.....The orbit of the ejected ink slightly changed, and a dot formed by a<br>
first droplet did not overlap a dot formed by a secondarily dropped droplet.<br>
C......A dot formed by a first droplet crossed the line of a dot formed by<br>
a secondarily dropped droplet.<br>
D......No ejected ink was found.<br>

nozzle clogging) &gt;<br>
Under the environment of a temperature of 25°C and a relative humidity of<br>
20%, each of the recording inks of Examples and Comparative Examples was set at<br>
an inkjet printer (GX5000, manufactured by Ricoh Company Ltd.) and it was<br><br>
confirmed that no nozzle clogging was caused. Thereafter, the inkjet recording head<br>
was uncapped by pulling down a cap unit (in a state where nozzles were likely to<br>
dry, acceleration test), and then the nozzles were left intact for 24 hours. Thereafter,<br>
a nozzle check pattern was recorded, and the extent of nozzle clogging was<br>
determined and evaluated based on the following criteria.<br>
[Evaluation Criteria]<br>
A: There was no nozzle clogging (non-ejection of ink) observed.<br>
B: Nozzle clogging was observed in one nozzle to less than 10 nozzles.<br>
C: Nozzle clogging was observed in ten nozzles to less than 30 nozzles.<br>
D: Nozzle clogging was observed in 30 nozzles to less than 100 nozzles.<br>
E: Nozzle clogging was observed in 100 or more nozzles.<br>
When the recording ink of Comparative Example 4 was used, abrasion and<br>
cockling were observed on the filter paper surface.<br>
The results shown in Table 4 demonstrate that the use of each of the<br>
recording inks of Examples 1 to 8 made it possible to obtain printed images hardly<br>
causing color stain (ink stain) even when grazed within one minute after being<br>
printed, without substantially causing problems with drying time, and also made it<br>
possible to obtain printed images having image shrpness and quality close to those of<br>
printed matters.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
A recording ink of the present invention allows for obtaining a high quality<br>
image that is close in quality to recorded matters produced by commercial printing<br>
and printed matters, without substantially causing problems with drying time.<br>
Therefore, the recording ink can be suitably used in ink media sets, ink cartridges,<br>
ink recorded matters, inkjet recording apparatuses, and inkjet recording methods.<br>
An inkjet recording apparatus and an inkjet recording method of the<br>
present invention can be used in various fields of recording based on inkjet recording<br>
method, and can be particularly suitably used, for example, in inkjet recording<br>
printers, facsimiles, copiers, printer/facsimile/copier complex apparatuses.<br>
