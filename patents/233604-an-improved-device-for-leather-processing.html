				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an improved device for leather processing. The device of the present invention has potential application in pre-tanning, tanning and post tanning wet operations in leather processing industry.<br>
The wet processing of hides and skins are conventionally done in pit, vat, paddle and wooden drum. While using pit and vat, the hides/skins are put into the process liquor and handled manually. It has prompted -the tanners to use paddle to impart the agitation in the liquor by rotation of the blades of the paddle using motor and gearbox, thereby providing mechanical agitation to the stock to be processed. Much better effect of the desired mechanical action under dynamic condition on the hide/skin to be processed is however provided in a tanning drum, which has been in use since 1903. Rotational movement of the drum ensures that the skins/hides are first lifted up by the shelves or pegs and then allowed to fall down under gravity to the processing liquor, resulting in considerable mechanical action. As re'ported by Sharphouse (Leather Technician's Hand book -- year 1S71, Appendix 7 Pages 543 to 547 published by Leather producer's association) and K.T. Sarkar author and publisher (Theory and practice of leather manufactures -5th edition, year 1997- pages 732-761) this conventional drumming is associated with the following limitations.<br>
a)	It involves the possibility of damage of the sides/skins under processing,<br>
by scrapping, scuffing, knotting, shape distortion, wrinkling, grain pebbling,<br>
loosening of fiber structure or loss in area.<br>
b)	It is associated with difficulty in thorough cleaning of the stock, which lets<br>
out lot of water adding to the effluent disposal problem.<br>
c)	It involves the inconvenience in opening the drum for unloading and other<br>
intermittent checking.<br>
d)	Since the float of the drum cannot go beyond the axle level, the capacity<br>
utilization is very low to the tune of only 35% of the volume of the drum.<br>
e)	Moreover, the turbulence generated in a tanning bath due to the rotational<br>
movement of the device results not only in reduced diffusion of chemicals,<br>
but also in enhanced friction among the surfaces of the skins/hides, thereby<br>
contributing to the degradation of the quality of the final leather.<br>
g) To process in short float as a measure against effluent problems, which<br><br>
requires strengthening of drum drives, a higher motor power is required for<br>
safe and efficient running.<br>
h) Normally, the required starting torque, which plays an important role in the<br>
selection of motor for any application, is very high to the tune of 3 times of<br>
the running torque due to the following reasons.<br>
1 .concentrated load of the hide/skin<br>
2.Self-weight of the wooden tanning drum,<br>
3.Friction because of the journal bearings and<br>
4.The possible spur gear errors.<br>
It is thus obvious that the motors used for running the drums are usually<br>
oversized to take care of starting torque, resulting in poor efficiency under<br>
normal running condition.<br>
The above limitations have prompted the researchers to explore better options for leather processing device. Tombetti et al (Abstract published in Journal of American Leather Chemists Association, 75, 62, 1980) developed a pressure vessel for leather tanning, a assembly of which is shown in fig. 1 of the drawings accompanying this specification. The pressure vessel comprises, a rotating inner drum (2) divided into three perforated compartments, each having a door (6), housed in a stationary exterior casing (1) provided with a door (7) and an inlet for chemical and water housed on a frame assembly (3), the said inner drum (2) being rotated with the help of main shaft (4), held by two bearings and housing (5) and connected to a power transmission assembly source (8), the pressure inside the inner drum (2) being generated with the help of a pneumatic system (9).<br>
It has been possible to enhance the capacity utilization to about 60% due to the provision of plurality of compartments provided in the pressure vessel. Moreover, the distribution of load, while the vessel is in motion ensures that the starting torque required for running the device is around 2 times of the running torque, thereby suggesting economy in energy consumption.<br><br>
Nevertheless, the pressure vessel is also associated with the following limitations.<br>
Association of moving parts with the inner vessel, which is connected to a rotating main shaft, has greater implication of wear and tear, that is likely to result in leakage of air, thereby causing loss of pressure inside the vessel. The stationary outer shell does not provide any option for automatic unloading of the leathers, which have to be taken out manually, thereby implying more labor as well as time.<br>
Our copending Indian patent application No. 791/DEL/2000 as shown in fig. 2,3 &amp; 4 of the drawings, has been an,attempt towards obviating the aforesaid limitations by way of providing an improved tanning device comprising a perforated inner vessel (15) having shelves more than one (17) and a door (16). The said inner vessel (15) being housed on non-corrosive chemical resistant rollers (18) fixed on the inner wall of the outer vessel (22) made up of a non-corrosive material capable of withstanding pressure of minimum 5 Kg/cm2, and the said outer vessel (22) being provided with a leak-proof packing (21) and dome shaped caps (20) on either side, the said outer shell being provided with inlet for chemicals and water (23), conventional regulated temperature device (24), discharge for liquid (26), a pressure nozzle (25) connected to a compressor and regulator externally (not shown in the drawing) for developing air pressure inside the vessel. The entire oscillating exterior shell (10) along with all accessories defined herein before being placed on center shaft (not shown in the drawing) being attached to the frame assembly (11). A conventional rocking mechanism (13) being provided on the outer shell and-connected to the normal power transmission assembly (12) in turn connected to the mechanism for rotating action (14) thereby ensuring rocking action as well as rotational movement of the inner perforated vessel (15) with the help of non corrosive chemical resistance gear (19) fixed on the outside of the inner vessel (15).<br>
The main advantages of this device over the known pressure vessel are the following.<br>
1.Unlike the known pressure vessel, where only rotary motion is possible, this device provides option for both oscillatory as well as rotary motion.<br><br>
2.The outer shell of the device undergoes rocking action, which enables an<br>
operator to adjust it in a convenient position so as to unload the processed<br>
stock by gravity automatically, thereby not only doing away with the extra<br>
labor associated with unloading, but also in reducing unloading tiine.<br>
3.Since the inner vessel is rotated by the rollers fixed to the inside of the.<br>
outer shell of the device, no leakage of internal pressure is envisaged and at<br>
the same time long life is ensured for the device.<br>
4.Unlike the existing systems, the starting torque of the device is only about<br>
1.5 times of the running torque as against much higher values for the existing<br>
devices, thereby reducing the power requirement considerably.<br>
5..Capacity utilization of the device is around 70% as against 45% in the<br>
existing wooden drum.<br>
6.Even without opening the vessel door, the critical parameters like pH,<br>
temperature of the float can be measured only by opening the outlet.<br>
However, the device is still constrained by the following limitations.<br>
The device provides a two-vessel system having an outer casing as well as<br>
an inner vessel, thereby escalating not oniy the fabrication complexities, but<br>
also cost.<br>
An external energy source is required in the form of an air compressor to<br>
form a pneumatic system, thereby adding to cost.<br>
The device does not provide, like the conventional tanning drums, any option<br>
for automatic mixing of chemicals inside the-drum, thereby implying the<br>
requirement of proper mixing of chemicals.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved device<br>
for leather processing, which obviates the drawbacks stated above.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a single vessel<br>
system exhibiting both oscillatory as well as rotary motions like upward and<br>
downward directions with less noise.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a leather-tanning<br>
device to employ pressure technique and at the same time to maintain the<br>
internal pressure while processing leathers.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a device<br>
exhibiting provision for automatic unloading of the processed stock.<br>
Another objective of the  present invention  is to increase the capacity<br><br>
utilization of the vessel to more than 75%.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to ensure that the power<br>
consumption and the processing time are reduced as compared to those in<br>
the similar oper=ations in respect of the devices known in the existing art.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a device to<br>
process in short float as a measure against effluent problems by consuming<br>
lesser energy compared to the conventional tanning drum.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention  is to provide a device<br>
exhibiting provision for the chemical addition manually or mechanically.<br>
The present invention provides an improved device for leather processing<br>
comprising a vessel containing perforated dummy doors and compartments<br>
with pegs as well as friction disk fixed along the exterior periphery of the<br>
vessel. The leathers to be wet processed-are subjected to mechanical action<br>
in   terms   of   both   rocking   action   as   well   as   rotational   movement<br>
simultaneously.    The perpetual motion of    the device helps to create<br>
pressure generation for quickening the process and for addition of chemical<br>
solution continuously. The processing takes place under pressure generated<br>
inside the vessel and with the support of multiple mechanical actions,<br>
resulting in higher exhaustion of bath with less processing time and energy<br>
requirement and higher capacity utilization to produce good quality leather.<br>

The device is essentially a frame assembly (30) housing a vessel (27)<br>
divided into more than one perforated compartment (41) fitted with pegs. The<br>
compartments help in distributing the load throughout the vessel, thereby<br>
reducing the starting torque. Not less than two-friction disks (28) are fixed<br>
along the exterior periphery of the vessel (27).  Friction disks (28) are<br>
positioned on friction roller (34), that rotates by the driving mechanism (38)<br>
connected to a power transmission source (39), through the connecting<br>
shafts (35), thereby enabling the vessel (27) to exhibit upward and downward<br>
rotary motion. A supporting roller assembly (40), positioned at one side of the<br>
disk (28) ensures that no slip occurs to the frame assembly (30) during the<br>
motion. There are two dome shaped, caps (31) on either side along the<br>
horizontal axis of the vessel (27). Both the caps are connected internally to<br>
perforated dummy door (42) along with leak proof packing (44) and are also<br>
provided with inlet (46) fixed at the center as well as outlet (45) at the bottom<br>
to drain out liquid. At least one of the dome shaped caps (31) is openable to<br>
ensure that the hides/skins to be processed can be put inside as well as<br>
taken out. The opening as well as closing of the dome shaped caps (31) is<br>
controlled by conventional locking mechanism (29). The entire unit, as<br>
described above, is connected to another known oscillating/rocking assembly<br>
(36), which drives its motion from another power transmission source (37),<br>
thereby ensuring rotary as well as oscillatory motion of the vessel (27). The<br>
bottom of the oscillating/rocking assembly (36), is provided with morti than<br>
one source for air generation (47), air chamber (48), valves (49) air lifter (50)<br>
and container (51), ail connected internally, thereby forming a pneumatic<br>
system,   which   is   used   for   continuous   addition   of   chemicals   during<br>
processing. After all the chemicals are added to the vessel through the<br>
opened valve, air from the air chamber is led into the system, thereby<br>
generating   inside   the   vessel   pneumatic   pressure,   that   quicken   the<br>
processing. The entire assembly, as described above, is held by a main shaft<br>
(32) supported by two bearings.  After taking the hide/skin to be processed<br>
inside the vessel (27) through the dummy door (42), the same is closed and<br>
the power transmission source (39) is switched on to start the rotary motion of the vessel (27). Then the power transmission source (37) is switched on to start the oscillatory motion of the vessel (27). The oscillatory motion of the (joyi/to facilitates d^avvinf1 ^ '*-'-? frorp ths sourc^ for Qensrsiiriri pjr ^47^ fixed at the bottom of the oscillatory assembly (36), and subsequent passing of the same air to the air lifter (50) through the air chamber (48) with the help of connecting lines and valves (49) facilitates letting the liquid from the container (51) into the vessel (27). Necessary chemicals are then ad'ded to the vessel from time to time. The persisting drawing of air after the transfer of the chemical solution from the container (51) to the vessel (27) facilitates generating of pneumatic pressure, which not only helps in uniform mixing of chemicals but also accelerates the processing. This rotary cum oscillatory motion of the vessel (27) ensures the stock under processing to multiple mechanical actions. Intermittent monitoring, if necessary, may be done by opening an aperture (43) provided on the external periphery of the vessel (27). At the end of the processing, the cap (31) is opened and the processed stock is unloaded by gravity.<br>
The novelty and non-obviousness of the present invention lies not only in providing a single vessel system exhibiting both oscillatory as well as rotary motion, thereby facilitating float turbulence as well as mixing of chemicals coupled with effective movement as well as automatic unloading of the hides/skins under processing, but also in using the oscillatory system of the device as a source for the generation of pressure inside the vessel and the pressure generated thereby being used as a pneumatic source for continuous addition of chemicals, thereby avoiding use of any external pneumatic source, resulting in economic utilization of energy and also providing a cost effective option for leather processing.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration only and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
101 Kgs of limed buffalo pelt, duly fleshed and washed thoroughly, were<br>
taken in the fiber reinforced plastic vessel having three perforated<br>
compartments. The perforated dummy door and the dome'shaped cap, both<br>
made of fiber reinforced plastic, wpr then Hosed bv using bolt and nut<br>
assembly installed in the device. The leak-proof material used for the vessel<br>
was nytrile rubber. Water, measuring 100 Lts., was added to the vessel<br>
through the inlet for washing operations. The rotary and oscillatory<br>
mechanisms of the vessel were then switched on one by one. The vessel<br>
containing the pelt started oscillating at 8 oscillations per minute (opm) and<br>
rotating at 10 revolutions per minute (rpm) with the help of teflon rollers<br>
mounted on the mild steel connecting shafts. The drive in respect of the<br>
oscillatory and rotary motions of the vessel was drawn by the hydraulic<br>
system and gearbox unit respectively. The direction of rotation of the vessel<br>
changed for every 10 minutes to upward and downward just by changing the<br>
change over switch for easy mixing of chemicals with the water and for<br>
quickening the process.	. «<br>
After a period of 15 minutes, the device was switched off and the water was drained out by opening the outlet. The same procedure was adopted for washing the pelt for second time. Water, measuring 70 Lt., was added to the vessel through the inlet for deliming operations, 1 kg of ammonium suifate was then dissolved in 5 lit. of water and the resulting solution was taken in the container, connected to the air pump, air chamber and valves through connecting lines.<br>
The device was switched on in the similar manner. The oscillatory motion of the device facilitated drawing of air from the air pump fixed at the bottom of the oscillatory assembly and subsequent passing of the same air to the air lifter through the air chamber with the help of connecting line and valve. The opening of the valve placed between the air chamber and the container facilitated in letting the liquid from the container into the vessel. As soon as all the liquid had been drawn in the vessel, the continued drawing of air facilitates the generation of phnumatic pressure, which was measured to be 3 kg/cm2, inside the vessel.<br>
After a period of 90 minutes, the vessel was switched off and the aperture was opened for pelt pH checking. The completion of deliming was confirmed<br>
using phenolphthalein indicator. The aperture was then closed and the vessel was kept in such a position that the outlet was opened and faced downward, thereby letting the water out by gravity. Then the out let of the domed shaped cap was clo?^ The subsequent operation of washina, pickling, chrome tanning was carried out in a similar way. Completion of pickling was confirmed by opening the aperture in a way as already mentioned above.<br>
Exhaustion of chrome was also checked in a similar way by opening the outlet and taking out a sample of the chrome liquor in a glass container. Finally vessel was switched off and the domed shaped cap with the perforated dummy door was opened. The vessel was then positioned in a slanting condition by adjusting the oscillatory mechanism, which was stopped as soon as the vessel had assumed the said position. The rotary system was then switched on whereby the tanned wet blue was drawn out automatically by gravity. The leathers were then piled.<br>
Example 2<br>
54 kgs of shaved weight wet blue were taken in the stainless steel vessel having two perforated compartments. The perforated dummy door both made of stainless steel, and the dome shaped cap of the vessel were then closed by using cam assembly installed in the device. The leak-proof material used for the vessel was spongy rubber. Water, measuring 50 Lt, was added to the vessel through the inlet for washing operation by adding 130 grams of formic acid and run for 30 minutes. After that the water was drained out by just opening the out let. The rotary and oscillatory mechanism of the vessel was then switched on one by one. The drive in respect of the oscillatory and rotary motions of the vessel was drawn by the cam mechanism and gearbox unit respectively. The direction of rotation of the vessel changed for every 10 minutes to upward and downward automatically by timer controlled system for easy mixing of chemicals with the water for quickening the process.<br>
The vessel containing the wet blue started oscillating at 10 opm, and rotating at 10 rpm with the help of the cast iron friction rollers mounted on the stainless steel connecting shaft. Water, measuring 50 Lts., was added to the vessel through the inlet for chrome tanning. 2.5 kgs Basic Chromium Sulfate<br>
powder dissolved in 5 lit. of pickle water and the resulting solution was added in one feed into the vessel through the inlet by manually. After a period of 40 minutes the vessel was switched off. The completion of chrome exhaustion was checked by collection the chrome liquor in a glass container.<br>
Then 320 grams of soda ash dissolved in 2 litres of water and the resulting solution was added in 3 feeds by manually. Then the drum was rotated as well as oscillated for a period of 30 minutes. The completion of neutralization operation was confirmed by opening the openable aperture for checking the pH of the leather. The aperture was then closed and the vessel was kept in such a position that the outlet was opened and faced downward, thereby letting the water out by gravity. The device was again switched on after closing the same outlet.<br>
Water, measuring 50 Its., was added to the vessel through the inlet for Fatliquoring, dying and fixing operations'. Then 5.6 Kgs of synthetic fat liquor was emulsified well in hot water. The resulting fatliquor emulsion was added in to the oscillating vessel through the inlet. After a period of 35 minutes 350 grams of black dye was taken and mixed with 1 lit of water and the resulting solution added into the vessel, while allowing the device to oscillate for another 35 minutes and then 500 gms of formic acid, dissolved in 5 lit. of water was added to the vessel through the inlet in three feeds. After a period of 30 minutes the device was switched off. Then checked for exhaustion and for penetration. Finally the tanned leather was taken out by opening the domed shaped cap with the perforated dummy door kept the vessel in a convenient position and rotate the vessel for few minutes so as to unload the processed stock by gravity automatically and were piled.<br>
Example 3<br>
185 Kgs assorted crust was taken in the in the stainless steel vessel having thee perforated compartments. The dome shaped cap with the perforated dummy door made of fibre glass reinforced polymer of the vessel was then closed by using rack and pinion mechanism installed in the device. The leak-proof material used for the vessel was nytrile rubber. Water, measuring 200 Its., was added to the vessel through the inlet for wetback operation by adding 1.5 kgs of wetting agent and 600 grams of ammonia. The rotary and oscillatory mechanisms of the vessel were then switched on one by one. The<br>
vessel containing the leather started oscillating at 4 opm and rotating at 6<br>
rpm with the help of the nytrile rubber rollers mounted on the cast iron<br>
connecting shafts. The drive in respect of the oscillatory and rotary motions<br>
of  the   vessel   was   drawn   by  tho   spatial   mechanism   anri   belt   drive<br>
respectively. The direction of rotation of the vessel changed for every 10<br>
minutes to upward and downward automatically by timer controlled system<br>
for easy mixing of chemicals with the water and for quickening the process.<br>
After 6 hours the device was switched off and the leather was checked by<br>
opening the aperture.   The wetting back was found o.k.   After closing! the<br>
aperture the device was switched on and kept the vessel in such a position<br>
that the outlet was opened and faced downward, thereby letting the water out<br>
by gravity. Then the outlet was closed.   Water, measuring 100 Lts., was<br>
added to the vessel through the inlet for Fatliquoring, dying and fixing<br>
operations. Then 18 Kgs of synthetic fatliquor was emulsified well in hot<br>
water. The resulting solution was taken in the container. Then device was<br>
switched on in the similar manner. The oscillatory motion of the device<br>
facilitated drawing of air from the air pump fixed at the bottom of the<br>
oscillatory assembly and subsequent passing of the same air to the air lifter<br>
through the air chamber with the help of connecting line and valve.   The<br>
opening of the valve placed between the air chamber and the container<br>
facilitated in letting the liquid from the container into the vessel. As soon as<br>
all the liquid had been drawn in the vessel, the continued drawing of air<br>
facilitates the generation of pneumatic pressure, which was measured to be<br>
2 kg/cm2, inside the vessel. After a period of 45 minutes 5 kgs of black dye<br>
was taken and mixed with 6 lits of water and the resulting solution added into<br>
the vessel as per the said method. The vessel was allowed to oscillate and<br>
rotate for another 60 minutes and then 750 gms of formic acid, dissolved in 5<br>
lit. of water was added to the rotating vessel through the inlet continuously.<br>
After a period of 30 minutes the device was switched off. Then the aperture<br>
was opened.   The liquor was collected for checking exhaustion of liquor.<br>
After that processed leather was taken out for checking uniform penetration<br>
of dye materials and found o.k. Finally the tanned leathers was taken out by<br>
opening the domed shaped cap with the dummy door and kept the vessel in<br>
a convenient position and rotate the vessel for few minutes so as to unload<br>
the processed stock by gravity automatically and were piled.<br>
Example 4<br>
vessel having two perforated compartments. The dome shaped cap with the perforated dummy door of the vessel, made of stainless steel were then closed by using rack and pinion assembly installed in the device. The leak-proof material used for the vessel was spongy rubber. Water, measuring 150 Lt., was added to the vessel through the inlet for washing operation by adding 400 grams of formic acid. After 30 minutes the device was switched off and kept the vessel in such a position that the outlet was opened and faced downward, thereby letting the water out by gravity. Then the outlet was closed.<br>
The rotary and oscillatory mechanisms of the vessel were then switched on one by one. The drive in respect of the oscillatory and rotary motions of the vessel was drawn by the hydraulic system and gearbox unit respectively. The direction of rotation of the vessel changed for every 10 minutes to upward and downward automatically by timer controlled system for easy mixing of chemicals with the water and for quickening the process. The vessel containing the wet blue started oscillating at 8 opm, and rotating at 8 rpm with the help of the cast iron friction rollers mounted on the stainless steel connecting shafts. Water, measuring 150 Its., was added to the vessel through the inlet for chrome tanning. 7.5 kgs of Basic Chromium Sulfate powder dissolved in 15 lit. of water and the resulting solution was added in one feed into the vessel through the inlet by manually. After a period of 40 minutes the vessel was switched off. The completion of chrome exhaustion was checked by collection the chrome liquor by opening the outlet. After that the outlet was closed. Then 1 Kg of soda ash dissolved in 10 litres of water and the resulting solution was added in 3 feeds by manually for a period of 30 minutes. Then the drum was rotated as well as oscillated for another period of 30 minutes. The completion of neutralization operation was confirmed by opening the openable aperture for checking the pH of the leather, which was found to be 4.5. The aperture was then closed and the vessel was kept in such a position that the outlet was opened and faced<br>
downward, thereby letting the water out by gravity. The device was again switched on after closing the same outlet. Water, measuring 150 Lts., was added to the vessel through the inlet for Fatliquoring, dying and fixing operations- Then 16 Kgs of synthetic fat liquor was emulsified weil in hot water. The resulting fatliquor emulsion was added in to the oscillating vessel through the inlet. After a period of 35 minutes 1 kg of black dye was taken and mixed with 3 lit of water and the resulting solution added into the vessel, while allowing the device to oscillate for another 35 minutes and then 1.5 Kgs of formic acid, dissolved in 10 lit. of water was added to the vessel through the inlet in three feeds. After a period of 30 minutes the device was switched off for checking. Finally the tanned leather was taken out by opening the domed shaped cap with the perforated dummy door, kept the vessel in a convenient position and oscillate the vessel for few minutes so as to unload the stock by gravity automatically and were piled.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are the following.<br>
I.The vessel of the device undergoes rocking action, which enables an operator to adjust it in a convenient position so as to load and unload the processed stock by gravity automatically, thereby not only doing away with the extra labor associated with loading and unloading, but also in reducing time.<br>
2.Since the light weight vessel is rotated by the friction rollers, the starting torque and the running torque of the device are equal, as against much higher values (three times) for the existing tanning drum, thereby reducing the power requirement considerably.<br>
S.The use of fabrication friendly materials like fiber reinforced plastic and stainless steel ensures ease in fabrication for the vessel, which is provided as a molded single unit structure for material saving,<br>
4.	Unlike in the conventional tanning drum,  the device of the present<br>
invention ensures, the parameter like cross section pH of the leather and<br>
liquor pH can be measured by opening the aperture without opening the<br>
vessel main door thereby saving time at least 2 minutes for each time of<br>
monitoring.       »<br>
5.	Unlike in the conventional tanning drum,  the device of the present<br>
invention facilitates with short float for leather processing, resulting in better<br>
absorption of chemicals, higher exhaustion of bath and less effluent load to<br>
reduce the cost in production are ensured.<br>
B.This gentle multiple mechanical actions of the device facilitates easy<br>
movement of the goods inside the vessel to reduce the friction of skin<br>
slippage for quality improvement.<br>
7.This vessel, is divided into compartments for distribution of working load<br>
(float  + skin/side)  and  occupies  75 to  80  %  of the  volume  of each<br>
compartment  as   in   the   conventional   tanning   drum   concentrated   load<br>
occupies only 35%.<br>
8.  Unlike in the conventional tanning drum where feeding of chemicai<br>
solution  normally made  manually,  the  device  of the  present  invention<br>
facilitate addition of chemical solution  into the vessel with the help of<br>
perpetual motion of the device.<br>
9.Unlike in the conventional tanning drum where direction of rotation of the<br>
drum normally in one direction, the device of the present invention facilitate<br>
both   upward and   downward direction of the vessel apart from oscillatory<br>
motion to reduce the processing time.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
