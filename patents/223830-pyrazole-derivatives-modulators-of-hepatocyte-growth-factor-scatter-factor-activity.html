Priority Information<br>
[0001] This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No.:<br>
60/435,533, filed December 21,2002; and U.S. Utility Application No.: 10/740,708,<br>
filed December 18, 2003; the entire contents of each of the above-referenced<br>
applications are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002] Scatter factor (SF; also known as hepatocyte growth factor [HGF], and<br>
hereinafter referred to and abbreviated as HGF/SF) is a pleiotropic growth factor<br>
that stimulates cell growth, cell motility, morphogenesis and angiogenesis. HGF/SF<br>
is produced as an inactive monomer (~100 kDa) which is prcteolytically converted<br>
to its active form. Active HGF/SF is a heparin-binding heterodimeric protein<br>
composed of a 62 kDa a chain and a 34 kDa b chain. HGF/SF is a potent mitogen<br>
for parenchymal liver, epithelial and endothelial cells (Matsumoto, K, and<br>
Nakamura, T. , 1997, Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) as a tissue organizer for<br>
organogenesis and regeneration. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 239, 639-44;<br>
Boros, P. and Miller, C.M., 1995, Hepatocyte growth factor: a multifunctional<br>
cytokine. Lancet 345, 293-5). It stimulates the growth of endothelial cells and also<br>
acts as a survival factor against endothelial cell death (Morishita, R, Nakamura, S,<br>
Nakamura, Y, Aoki, M, Moriguchi, A, Kida, I, Yo, Y, Matsumoto, K, Nakamura, T,<br>
Higaki, J, Ogihara, T, 1997, Potential role of an endothelium-specific growth factor,<br>
hepatocyte growth factor, on endothelial damage in diabetes. Diabetes 46:138-42).<br>
HGF/SF synthesized and secreted by vascular smooth muscle cells stimulates<br>
endothelial cells to proliferate, migrate and differentiate into capillary-like tubes in<br>
vitro (Grant, D.S, Kleinman, H.K., Goldberg, I.D., Bhargava, M.M., Nickoloff, B.J.,<br>
Kinsella, J.L., Polverini, P., Rosen, E.M., 1993, Scatter factor induces blood vessel<br>
formation in vivo. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:1937-41; Morishita, R.,<br>
Nakamura, S., Hayashi, S., Taniyama, Y., Moriguchi, A., Nagano, T., Taiji, M.,<br>
Noguchi, H., Takeshita, S., Matsumoto, K., Nakamura, T., Higaki, J., Ogihara, T.,<br>
1999, Therapeutic angiogenesis induced by human rccombinant hepatocyte growth<br>
factor in rabbit hind limb ischemia model as cytokine supplement therapy.<br>
Hypertension 33:1379-84). HGF/SF-containing implants in mouse subcutaneous<br>
tissue and rat cornea induce growth of new blood vessels from surrounding tissue.<br>
HGF/SF protein is expressed at sites of neovascularization including in tumors<br>
(Jeffers, M., Rong, S., Woude, G.F. , 1996, Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor-<br>
Met signaling in tumorigenicity and invasion/metastasis. J. Mol. Med. 74:505-13;<br>
Moriyama, T., Kataoka, H., Koono, M., Wakisaka, S., 1999, Expression of<br>
hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor and its receptor c-met in brain tumors:<br>
evidence for a role in progression of astrocytic tumors Int. J. Mol. Med. 3:531-6).<br>
These findings suggest that HGF/SF plays a significant role in the formation and<br>
repair of blood vessels under physiologic and pathologic conditions. Further<br>
discussion of angiogenic proteins may be found in U.S. Patents 6,011,009 and<br>
5,997,868, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.<br>
[0003] In certain embodiments, the present invention is directed toward the<br>
identification of small organic molecules that exhibit HGF/SF activity and are thus<br>
useful in the treatment or prevention of condition or diseases, in which HGF/SF<br>
activity is desirable.<br>

construed as an admission that such reference is available as "Prior Art" to the<br>
instant application.<br>

CH2CH2OH; -CH2NH2; -CH2SO2CH3; -C(=O)RX; -CO2(RX); -C(=O)N(RX)2; -<br>
OC(=O)RX; -OCO2RX; -OC(=O)N(RX)2; -N(RX)2; -ORX; -SRX; -S(O)RX; -S(O)2RX; -<br>
NRX(CO)RX; -N(RX)CO2RX; -N(RX)S(O)2RX; -N(RX)C(=O)N(RX)2; -S(O)2N(RX)2;<br>

aliphatic, alicyclic, heteroaliphatic, heterocyclic, aryl, heteroaryl, alkylaryl,<br>
alkylheteroaryl, heteroalkylaryl or heteroalkylheteroaryl, wherein any of the<br>
aliphatic, alicyclic, heteroaliphatic, heterocyclic, alkylaryl, or alkylheteroaryl<br>
substituents described above and herein may be substituted or unsubstituted,<br>
branched or unbranched, saturated or unsaturated, and wherein any of the aryl or<br>
heteroaryl substituents described above and herein may be substituted or<br>
unsubstituted. Additional examples of generally applicable substituents are<br>
illustrated by the specific embodiments shown in the Examples that are described<br>
herein.<br>
[0016] In general, the term "aromatic moiety", as used herein, refers to a stable<br>
mono- or polycyclic, unsaturated moiety having preferably 3-14 carbon atoms, each<br>
of which may be substituted or unsubstituted. In certain embodiments, the term<br>
"aromatic moiety" refers to a planar ring having p-orbitals perpendicular to the plane<br>
of the ring at each ring atom and satisfying the Huckel rule where the number of pi<br>
electrons in the ring is (4n+2) wherein n is an integer. A mono- or polycyclic,<br>
unsaturated moiety that does not satisfy one or all of these criteria for aromaticity is<br>
defined herein as "non-aromatic", and is encompassed by the term "alicyclic".<br>
[0017] In general, the term "heteroaromatic moiety", as used herein, refers to a<br>
stable mono- or polycyclic, unsaturated moiety having preferably 3-14 carbon<br>
atoms, each of which may be substituted or unsubstituted; and comprising at least<br>
one heteroatom selected from O, S and N within the ring (i.e., in place of a ring<br>
carbon atom). In certain embodiments, the term "heteroaromatic moiety" refers to a<br>
planar ring comprising at least one heteroatom, having p-orbitals perpendicular to<br>
the plane of the ring at each ring atom, and satisfying the Huckel rule where the<br>
number of pi electrons in the ring is (4n+2) wherein n is an integer.<br>
[0018] It will also be appreciated that aromatic and heteroaromatic moieties, as<br>
defined herein may be attached via an alkyl or heteroalkyl moiety and thus also<br>
include -(alkyl)aromatic, -(heteroalkyl)aromatic, -(heteroalkyl)heteroaromatic, and<br>
-(heteroalkyl)heteroaromatic moieties. Thus, as used herein, the phrases "aromatic<br>
or heteroaromatic moieties" and "aromatic, heteroaromatic, -(alkyl)aromatic, -<br>
(heteroalkyl)aromatic, -(heteroalkyl)heteroaromatic, and -<br>
(heteroalkyl)heteroaromatic" are interchangeable. Substituents include, but are not<br>
limited to, any of the previously mentioned substituents, i.e., the substituents recited<br>
for aliphatic moieties, or for other moieties as disclosed herein, resulting in the<br>
formation of a stable compound.<br>
[0019] The term "aryl", as used herein, does not differ significantly from the<br>
common meaning of the term in the art, and refers to an unsaturated cyclic moiety<br>
comprising at least one aromatic ring. In certain embodiments, "aryl" refers to a<br>
mono- or bicyclic carbocyclic ring system having one or two aromatic rings<br>
including, but not limited to, phenyl, naphthyl, tetrahydronaphthyl, indanyl, indenyl<br>
and the like.<br>
[0020] The term "heteroaryl", as used herein, does not differ significantly from<br>
the common meaning of the term in the art, and refers to a cyclic aromatic radical<br>
having from five to ten ring atoms of which one ring atom is selected from S, O and<br>
N; zero, one or two ring atoms are additional heteroatoms independently selected<br>
from S, O and N; and the remaining ring atoms are carbon, the radical being joined<br>
to the rest of the molecule via any of the ring atoms, such as, for example, pyridyl,<br>
pyrazinyl, pyrimidinyl, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, and the like.<br>
[0021] It will be appreciated that aryl and heteroaryl groups (including bicyclic<br>
aryl groups) can be unsubstituted or substituted, wherein substitution includes<br>
replacement of one or more of the hydrogen atoms thereon independently with any<br>
one or more of the following moieties including, but not limited to: aliphatic;<br>
alicyclic; heteroaliphatic; heterocyclic; aromatic; heteroaromatic; aryl; heteroaryl;<br>

one, two, or three halogen atoms attached thereto and is exemplified by such groups<br>
as chloromethyl, bromoethyl, trifluoromethyl, and the like.<br>
[0028] The term "amino", as used herein, refers to a primary (-NH2), secondary<br>
(-NHRX), tertiary (-NRxRy) or quaternary (-N+RxRyRz) amine, where Rx, Ry and Rz<br>

is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) a compound as otherwise described<br>
herein, or a metabolite or residue thereof. Pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives<br>
thus include among others pro-drugs. A pro-drug is a derivative of a compound,<br>
usually with significantly reduced pharmacological activity, which contains an<br>
additional moiety, which is susceptible to removal in vivo yielding the parent<br>
molecule as the pharmacologically active species. An example of a pro-drug is an<br>
ester, which is cleaved in vivo to yield a compound of interest. Another example is<br>
an N-methyl derivative of a compound, which is susceptible to oxidative metabolism<br>
resulting in N-demethylation, particularly on the 1 position of the 3(5)-<br>
monosubstituted pyrazole derivatives of the invention. Pro-drugs of a variety of<br>
compounds, and materials and methods for derivatizing the parent compounds to<br>
create the pro-drugs, are known and may be adapted to the present invention.<br>
Certain exemplary pharmaceutical compositions and pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
derivatives will be discussed in more detail herein below.<br>
[0033] The term "tautomerization" refers to the phenomenon wherein a proton<br>
of one atom of a molecule shifts to another atom. See, Jerry March, Advanced<br>
Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms and Structures, Fourth Edition, John<br>
Wiley &amp; Sons, pages 69-74 (1992). The term "tautomer" as used herein, refers to the<br>
compounds produced by the proton shift. For example, compounds of formula II<br>
(and more generally, compounds of formula I where R1 is hydrogen), can exist as a<br>
tautomer as shown below:<br>
[0034] Thus, the present invention encompasses the 3-monosubstituted pyrazole<br>
compounds described herein (e.g., compounds of formula I, II, and related formulae<br>
IIA, IIB, IIc, etc.), as well as their tautomeric 5-monosubstituted pyrazole<br>
counterparts. Likewise, any compound shown as 5-monosubstituted pyrazole<br>
embraces its corresponding 3-monosubstituted tautomer.<br>
[0035] The term "C(5)-positional isomer" as used herein refers to 1,5-<br>
disubstituted counterparts of the 1,3-disubstituted pyrazole compounds described<br>
herein. For example, the invention encompasses compounds of the formula (IIIB)<br>
and its C(5)-positional isomer (IIIB):<br>
[0036] Thus, whether or not explicitly specified, the present invention<br>
encompasses the 1,3-disubstituted pyrazole compounds described herein (e.g.,<br>
compounds of formula I, III, and related formulae IIIA, IIIs, IIIC, IIId, etc.), as well<br>
as their C(5)-positional pyrazole counterparts. Likewise, any compound shown as<br>
1,5-disubstituted pyrazole embraces its corresponding 1,3-disubstituted positional<br>
isomer.<br>
[0037] By the term "protecting group", as used herein, it is meant that a<br>
particular functional moiety, e.g., O, S, or N, is temporarily blocked so that a<br>
reaction can be carried out selectively at another reactive site in a multifunctional<br>
compound. In preferred embodiments, a protecting group reacts selectively in good<br>
yield to give a protected substrate that is stable to the projected reactions; the<br>
protecting group must be selectively removed in good yield by readily available,<br>
preferably nontoxic reagents that do not attack the other functional groups; the<br>
protecting group forms an easily separable derivative (more preferably without the<br>
generation of new stereogenic centers); and the protecting group has a minimum of<br>
additional functionality to avoid further sites of reaction. As detailed herein,<br>
oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen and carbon protecting groups may be utilized. For example,<br>
in certain embodiments, as detailed herein, certain exemplary oxygen protecting<br>
groups are utilized. These oxygen protecting groups include, but are not limited to<br>
methyl ethers, substituted methyl ethers (e.g., MOM (methoxymethyl ether), MTM<br>
(methylthiomethyl ether), BOM (benzyloxymethyl ether), PMBM or MPM (p-<br>
methoxybenzyloxymethyl ether), to name a few), substituted ethyl ethers,<br>
substituted benzyl ethers, silyl ethers (e.g., TMS (trimethylsilyl ether), TES<br>
(triethylsilylether), TIPS (triisopropylsilyl ether), TBDMS (t-butyldimethylsilyl<br>
ether), tribenzyl silyl ether, TBDPS (t-butyldiphenyl silyl ether), to name a few),<br>
esters (e.g., formate, acetate, benzoate (Bz), trifluoroacetate, dichloroacetate, to<br>
name a few), carbonates, cyclic acetals and ketals. In certain other exemplary<br>
embodiments, nitrogen protecting groups are utilized. These nitrogen protecting<br>
groups include, but are not limited to, carbamates (including methyl, ethyl and<br>
substituted ethyl carbamates (e.g., Troc), to name a few) amides, cyclic imide<br>
derivatives, N-Alkyl and N-Aryl amines, imine derivatives, and enamine derivatives,<br>
to name a few. Certain other exemplary protecting groups are detailed herein,<br>
however, it will be appreciated that the present invention is not intended to be<br>
limited to these protecting groups; rather, a variety of additional equivalent<br>
protecting groups can be readily identified using the above criteria and utilized in the<br>
present invention. Additionally, a variety of protecting groups are described in<br>

[0038] As used herein, the term "isolated" when applied to the compounds of the<br>
present invention, refers to such compounds that are (i) separated from at least some<br>
components with which they are associated in nature or when they are made and/or<br>
(ii) produced, prepared or manufactured by the hand of man.<br>
[0039] As used herein the term "biological sample " includes, without limitation,<br>
cell cultures or extracts thereof; biopsied material obtained from an animal (e.g.,<br>
mammal) or extracts thereof; and blood, saliva, urine, feces, semen, tears, or other<br>
body fluids or extracts thereof; or purified versions thereof. For example, the term<br>
"biological sample" refers to any solid or fluid sample obtained from, excreted by or<br>
secreted by any living organism, including single-celled micro-organisms (such as<br>
bacteria and yeasts) and multicellular organisms (such as plants and animals, for<br>
instance a vertebrate or a mammal, and in particular a healthy or apparently healthy<br>
human subject or a human patient affected by a condition or disease to be diagnosed<br>
or investigated). The biological sample can be in any form, including a solid<br>
material such as a tissue, cells, a cell pellet, a cell extract, cell homogenates, or cell<br>
fractions; or a biopsy, or a biological fluid. The biological fluid may be obtained<br>
from any site (e.g. blood, saliva (or a mouth wash containing buccal cells), tears,<br>
plasma, serum, urine, bile, seminal fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, amniotic fluid,<br>
peritoneal fluid, and pleural fluid, or cells therefrom, aqueous or vitreous humor, or<br>
any bodily secretion), a transudate, an exudate (e.g. fluid obtained from an abscess<br>
or any other site of infection or inflammation), or fluid obtained from a joint (e.g. a<br>
normal joint or a joint affected by disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis,<br>
gout or septic arthritis). The biological sample can be obtained from any organ or<br>
tissue (including a biopsy or autopsy specimen) or may comprise cells (whether<br>
primary cells or cultured cells) or medium conditioned by any cell, tissue or organ.<br>
Biological samples may also include sections of tissues such as frozen sections taken<br>
for histological purposes. Biological samples also include mixtures of biological<br>
molecules including proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and nucleic acids generated by<br>
partial or complete fractionation of cell or tissue homogenates. Although the sample<br>
is preferably taken from a human subject, biological samples may be from any<br>
animal, plant, bacteria, virus, yeast, etc. The term animal, as used herein, refers to<br>
humans as well as non-human animals, at any stage of development, including, for<br>
example, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, worms and single cells. Cell<br>
cultures and live tissue samples are considered to be pluralities of animals. In certain<br>
exemplary embodiments, the non-human animal is a mammal (e.g., a rodent, a<br>
mouse, a rat, a rabbit, a monkey, a dog, a cat, a sheep, cattle, a primate, or a pig).<br>
An animal may be a transgenic animal or a human clone. If desired, the biological<br>
sample may be subjected to preliminary processing, including preliminary<br>
separation techniques.<br>

and N(Re)2.<br>
[0136] It will be appreciated that each of the compounds described herein<br>
and each of the subclasses of compounds described above (I-XII) may be<br>
substituted as described generally herein, or may be substituted according to any one<br>
or more of the subclasses described above and herein [e.g., i)-liv)].<br>
[0137] Some of the foregoing compounds can comprise one or more<br>
asymmetric centers, and thus can exist in various isomeric forms, e.g., stereoisomers<br>
and/or diastereomers. Thus, inventive compounds and pharmaceutical compositions<br>
thereof may be in the form of an individual enantiomer, diastereomer or geometric<br>
isomer, or may be in the form of a mixture of stereoisomers. In certain<br>
embodiments, the compounds of the invention are enantiopure compounds. In<br>
certain other embodiments, mixtures of stereoisomers or diastereomers are provided.<br>
[0138] Furthermore, certain compounds, as described herein may have one<br>
or more double bonds that can exist as either the Z or E isomer, unless otherwise<br>
indicated. The invention additionally encompasses the compounds as individual<br>
isomers substantially free of other isomers and alternatively, as mixtures of various<br>
isomers, e.g., racemic mixtures of stereoisomers. In addition to the above-<br>
mentioned compounds per se, this invention also encompasses pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable derivatives of these compounds and compositions comprising one or<br>
more compounds of the invention and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
excipients or additives.<br>
[0139] Compounds of the invention may be prepared by crystallization of<br>
compound of formula (I), (II) and (III) under different conditions and may exist as<br>
one or a combination of polymorphs of compound of general formula (I), (TI) and<br>
(III) forming part of this invention. For example, different polymorphs may be<br>
identified and/or prepared using different solvents, or different mixtures of solvents<br>
for recrystallization; by performing crystallizations at different temperatures; or by<br>
using various modes of cooling, ranging from very fast to very slow cooling during<br>
crystallizations. Polymorphs may also be obtained by heating or melting the<br>
compound followed by gradual or fast cooling. The presence of polymorphs may be<br>
determined by solid probe NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, differential<br>
scanning calorimetry, powder X-ray diffractogram and/or other techniques. Thus,<br>
the present invention encompasses inventive compounds, their derivatives, their<br>
tautomeric forms, their stereoisomers, their C(5)-positional isomer their polymorphs,<br>
their pharmaceutically acceptable salts their pharmaceutically acceptable solvates<br>
and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions containing them. Tautomeric forms<br>
of compounds of the present invention include, for example the 3- and 5-substituted<br>
pyrazole tautomers of any of the aforementioned disubstituted compounds of general<br>
Formula II and related formulas. Likewise, C(5)-positional isomers of the 1,3-<br>
disubstituted pyrazoles of general Formula I and III and related formulas are<br>
encompassed within the scope of the present invention. Thus, the invention<br>
encompasses 1,5-disubstituted pyrazoles.<br>
[0140] 2) Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
[0141] As discussed above this invention provides novel compounds that<br>
have biological properties useful for the treatment of any of a number of conditions<br>
or diseases in which HGF/SF or the activities thereof have a therapeutically useful<br>
role, or in some instances, where antagonism thereof is useful.<br>
[0142] Accordingly, in another aspect of the present invention,<br>
pharmaceutical compositions are provided, which comprise any one or more of the<br>
compounds described herein (or a prodrug, pharmaceutically acceptable salt or other<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof), and optionally comprise a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In certain embodiments, these compositions<br>
optionally further comprise one or more additional therapeutic agents.<br>
Alternatively, a compound of this invention may be administered to a patient in need<br>
thereof in combination with the administration of one or more other therapeutic<br>
agents. For example, additional therapeutic agents for conjoint administration or<br>
inclusion in a pharmaceutical composition with a compound of this invention may<br>
be an approved agent to treat the same or related indication, or it may be any one of<br>
a number of agents undergoing approval in the Food and Drug Administration that<br>
ultimately obtain approval for the treatment of any disorder related to HGF/SF<br>
activity. It will also be appreciated that certain of the compounds of present<br>
invention can exist in free form for treatment, or where appropriate, as a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof. According to the present invention,<br>
a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative includes, but is not limited to,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, salts of such esters, or a pro-drug or other<br>
adduct or derivative of a compound of this invention which upon administration to a<br>
patient in need is capable of providing, directly or indirectly, a compound as<br>
otherwise described herein, or a metabolite or residue thereof.<br>
[0143] As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to<br>
those salts which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use<br>
in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity,<br>
irritation, allergic response and the like, and are commensurate with a reasonable<br>
benefit/risk ratio. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of amines, carboxylic acids, and<br>
other types of compounds, are well known in the art. For example, S.M. Berge, et<br>
al. describe pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in J. Pharmaceutical<br>
Sciences, 66: 1-19 (1977), incorporated herein by reference. The salts can be<br>
prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds of the<br>
invention, or separately by reacting a free base or free acid function with a suitable<br>
reagent, as described generally below. For example, a free base function can be<br>
reacted with a suitable acid. Furthermore, where the compounds of the invention<br>
carry an acidic moiety, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may,<br>
include metal salts such as alkali metal salts, e.g. sodium or potassium salts; and<br>
alkaline earth metal salts, e.g. calcium or magnesium salts. Examples of<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic acid addition salts are salts of an amino group<br>
formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid,<br>
phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and perchloric acid or with organic acids such as<br>
acetic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid or<br>
malonic acid or by using other methods used in the art such as ion exchange. Other<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts include adipate, alginate, ascorbate, aspartate,<br>
benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bisulfate, borate, butyrate, camphorate,<br>
camphorsulfonate, citrate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate,<br>
ethanesulfonate, formate, fumarate, glucoheptonate, glycerophosphate, gluconate,<br>
hernisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxy-ethanesulfonate,<br>
lactobionate, lactate, laurate, lauryl sulfate, malate, maleate, malonate,<br>
methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, oleate, oxalate,<br>
palmitate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, phosphate, picrate,<br>
pivalate, propionate, stearate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, thiocyanate, p-<br>
toluenesulfonate, undecanoate, valerate salts, and the like. Representative alkali or<br>
alkaline earth metal salts include sodium, lithium, potassium, calcium, magnesium,<br>
and the like. Further pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, when appropriate,<br>
nontoxic ammonium, quaternary ammonium, and amine cations formed using<br>
counterions such as halide, hydroxide, carboxylate, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate,<br>
loweralkyl sulfonate and aryl sulfonate.<br>
[0144] Additionally, as used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
ester" refers to esters that hydrolyze in vivo and include those that break down<br>
readily in the human body to leave the parent compound or a salt thereof. Suitable<br>
ester groups include, for example, those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
aliphatic carboxylic acids, particularly alkanoic, alkenoic, cycloalkanoic and<br>
alkanedioic acids, in which each alkyl or alkenyl moiety advantageously has not<br>
more than 6 carbon atoms. Examples of particular esters include formates, acetates,<br>
propionates, butyrates, acrylates and ethylsuccinates.<br>
[0145] Furthermore, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs" as<br>
used herein refers to those prodrugs of the compounds of the present invention<br>
which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact<br>
with the issues of humans and lower animals with undue toxicity, irritation, allergic<br>
response, and the like, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and<br>
effective for their intended use, as well as the zwitterionic forms, where possible, of<br>
the compounds of the invention. The term "prodrug" refers to compounds that are<br>
rapidly transformed in vivo to yield the parent compound of the above formula, for<br>
example by hydrolysis in blood, or N-demethylation of a compound of the invention<br>
where R1 is methyl. A thorough discussion is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella,<br>
Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and<br>
in Edward B. Roche, ed., Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, American<br>
Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference. By way of example, N-methylated pro-drugs of<br>
the 3(5)-monosubstituted pyrazoles of the invention are embraced herein.<br>
[0146] As described above, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present<br>
invention additionally comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which, as<br>
used herein, includes any and all solvents, diluents, or other liquid vehicle,<br>
dispersion or suspension aids, surface active agents, isotonic agents, thickening or<br>
emulsifying agents, preservatives, solid binders, lubricants and the like, as suited to<br>
the particular dosage form desired. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sixteenth<br>
Edition, E. W. Martin (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1980) discloses various<br>
carriers used in formulating pharmaceutical compositions and known techniques for<br>
the preparation thereof. Except insofar as any conventional carrier medium is<br>
incompatible with the compounds of the invention, such as by producing any<br>
undesirable biological effect or otherwise interacting in a deleterious manner with<br>
any other components) of the pharmaceutical composition, its use is contemplated<br>
to be within the scope of this invention. Some examples of materials which can<br>
serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, sugars<br>
such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches such as corn starch and potato starch;<br>
cellulose and its derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose<br>
and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatine; talc; excipients such as<br>
cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil; safflower<br>
oil, sesame oil; olive oil; corn oil and soybean oil; glycols; such as propylene glycol;<br>
esters such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents such as<br>
magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogenfree water;<br>
isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as<br>
well as other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and<br>
magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents,<br>
sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also<br>
be present in the composition, according to the judgment of the formulator.<br>
[0147] Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, but are not<br>
limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions,<br>
suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid<br>
dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for<br>
example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl<br>
alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl<br>
benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in<br>
particular, cottonseed, groundnut (peanut), corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame<br>
oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters<br>
of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can<br>
also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents,<br>
sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.<br>
[0148] Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or<br>
oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable<br>
dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable<br>
preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a<br>
nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-<br>
butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are<br>
water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition,<br>
sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium.<br>
For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or<br>
diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of<br>
injectables.<br>
[0149] The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by<br>
filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in<br>
the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile<br>
water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use.<br>
[0150] In order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is often desirable to slow<br>
the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may<br>
be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension or crystalline or amorphous<br>
material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends<br>
upon its rate of dissolution that, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline<br>
form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is<br>
accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. Injectable<br>
depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in<br>
biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the<br>
ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate<br>
of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers<br>
include (poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are<br>
also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are<br>
compatible with body tissues.<br>
[0151] Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably<br>
suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention<br>
with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene<br>
glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at<br>
body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the<br>
active compound.<br>
[0152] Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets,<br>
pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is<br>
mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such<br>
as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as<br>
starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for<br>
example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone,<br>
sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as<br>
agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates,<br>
and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption<br>
accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as,<br>
for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin<br>
and bentonite clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium<br>
stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In<br>
the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering<br>
agents.<br>
[0153] Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers<br>
in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar<br>
as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid<br>
dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with<br>
coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the<br>
pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and<br>
can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or<br>
preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner.<br>
Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances<br>
and waxes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in<br>
soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as<br>
well as high molecular weight polethylene glycols and the like.<br>
[0154] The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form with<br>
one or more excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees,<br>
capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric<br>
coatings, release controlling coatings and other coatings well known in the<br>
pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid dosage forms the active compound<br>
may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose and starch.<br>
Such dosage forms may also comprise, as in normal practice, additional substances<br>
other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting aids such as<br>
magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets<br>
and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. They may<br>
optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they<br>
release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the<br>
intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding<br>
compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.<br>
[0155] The present invention encompasses pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
topical formulations of inventive compounds. The term "pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable topical formulation", as used herein, means any formulation which is<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable for intradermal administration of a compound of the<br>
invention by application of the formulation to the epidermis. In certain embodiments<br>
of the invention, the topical formulation comprises a carrier system.<br>
Pharmaceutically effective carriers include, but are not limited to, solvents (e.g.,<br>
alcohols, poly alcohols, water), creams, lotions, ointments, oils, plasters, Hposomes,<br>
powders, emulsions, microemulsions, and buffered solutions (e.g., hypotonic or<br>
buffered saline) or any other carrier known in the art for topically administering<br>
Pharmaceuticals. A more complete listing of art-known carriers is provided by<br>
reference texts that are standard in the art, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical<br>
Sciences, 16th Edition, 1980 and 17th Edition, 1985, both published by Mack<br>
Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., the disclosures of which are incorporated herein<br>
by reference in their entireties. In certain other embodiments, the topical<br>
formulations of the invention may comprise excipients. Any pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipient known in the art may be used to prepare the inventive<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable topical formulations. Examples of excipients that can<br>
be included in the topical formulations of the invention include, but are not limited<br>
to, preservatives, antioxidants, moisturizers, emollients, buffering agents,<br>
solubilizing agents, other penetration agents, skin protectants, surfactants, and<br>
propellants, and/or additional therapeutic agents used in combination to the<br>
inventive compound. Suitable preservatives include, but are not limited to, alcohols,<br>
quaternary amines, organic acids, parabens, and phenols. Suitable antioxidants<br>
include, but are not limited to, ascorbic acid and its esters, sodium bisulfite,<br>
butylated hydroxytoluene, butylated hydroxyanisole, tocopherols, and chelating<br>
agents like EDTA and citric acid. Suitable moisturizers include, but are not limited<br>
to, glycerine, sorbitol, polyethylene glycols, urea, and propylene glycol. Suitable<br>
buffering agents for use with the invention include, but are not limited to, citric,<br>
hydrochloric, and lactic acid buffers. Suitable solubilizing agents include, but are not<br>
limited to, quaternary ammonium chlorides, cyclodextrins, benzyl benzoate, lecithin,<br>
and polysorbates. Suitable skin protectants that can be used in the topical<br>
formulations of the invention include, but are not limited to, vitamin E oil, allatoin,<br>
dimethicone, glycerin, petrolatum, and zinc oxide.<br>
[0156] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable topical<br>
formulations of the invention comprise at least a compound of the invention and a<br>
penetration enhancing agent. The choice of topical formulation will depend or<br>
several factors, including the condition to be treated, the physicochemical<br>
characteristics of the inventive compound and other excipients present, their stability<br>
in the formulation, available manufacturing equipment, and costs constraints. As<br>
used herein the term " penetration enhancing agent " means an agent capable of<br>
transporting a pharmacologically active compound through the stratum corneum and<br>
into the epidermis or dermis, preferably, with little or no systemic absorption. A<br>
wide variety of compounds have been evaluated as to their effectiveness in<br>
enhancing the rate of penetration of drugs through the skin. See, for example,<br>
Percutaneous Penetration Enhancers, Maibach H. I. and Smith H. E. (eds.), CRC<br>
Press, Inc., Boca Raton, Fla. (1995), which surveys the use and testing of various<br>
skin penetration enhancers, and Buyuktimkin et al, Chemical Means of Transdermal<br>
Drug Permeation Enhancement in Transdermal and Topical Drug Delivery Systems,<br>
Gosh T. K., Pfister W. R., Yum S. I. (Eds.), Interpharm Press Inc., Buffalo Grove,<br>
111. (1997). In certain exemplary embodiments, penetration agents for use with the<br>
invention include, but are not limited to, triglycerides {e.g., soybean oil), aloe<br>
compositions (e.g., aloe-vera gel), ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol,<br>
octolyphenylpolyethylene glycol, oleic acid, polyethylene glycol 400, propylene<br>
glycol, N-decylmethylsulfoxide, fatty acid esters (e.g., isopropyl myristate, methyl<br>
laurate, glycerol monooleate, and propylene glycol monooleate) and N-methyl<br>
pyrrolidone.<br>
[0157] In certain embodiments, the compositions may be in the form of<br>
ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants or<br>
patches. In certain exemplary embodiments, formulations of the compositions<br>
according to the invention are creams, which may further contain saturated or<br>
unsaturated fatty acids such as stearic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, palmito-oleic<br>
acid, cetyl or oleyl alcohols, stearic acid being particularly preferred. Creams of the<br>
invention may also contain a non-ionic surfactant, for example, polyoxy-40-stearate.<br>
In certain embodiments, the active component is admixed under sterile conditions<br>
with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers<br>
as may be required. Ophthalmic formulation, eardrops, and eye drops are also<br>
contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. Formulations for<br>
intraocular administration are also included. Additionally, the present invention<br>
contemplates the use of transdermal patches, which have the added advantage of<br>
providing controlled delivery of a compound to the body. Such dosage forms are<br>
made by dissolving or dispensing the compound in the proper medium. As<br>
discussed above, penetration enhancing agents can also be used to increase the flux<br>
of the compound across the skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing a<br>
rate controlling membrane or by dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or<br>
gel.<br>
[0158] It will also be appreciated that the compounds and pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of the present invention can be formulated and employed in<br>
combination therapies, that is, the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions can<br>
be formulated with or administered concurrently with, prior to, or subsequent to, one<br>
or more other desired therapeutics or medical procedures. The particular<br>
combination of therapies (therapeutics or procedures) to employ in a combination<br>
regimen will take into account compatibility of the desired therapeutics and/or<br>
procedures and the desired therapeutic effect to be achieved. It will also be<br>
appreciated that the therapies employed may achieve a desired effect for the same<br>
disorder (for example, an inventive compound may be administered concurrently<br>
with another anti-inflammatory agent), or they may achieve different effects (e.g.,<br>
control of any adverse effects). In non-limiting examples, one or more compounds<br>
of the invention may be formulated with at least one cytokine, growth factor or other<br>
biological, such as an interferon, e.g., alpha interferon, or with at least another small<br>
molecule compound. Non-limiting examples of pharmaceutical agents that may be<br>
combined therapeutically with compounds of the invention include: antivirals and<br>
antifibrotics such as interferon alpha, combination of interferon alpha and ribavirin,<br>
Lamivudine, Adefovir dipivoxil and interferon gamma; anticoagulants such as<br>
heparin and warfarin; antiplatelets e.g., aspirin, ticlopidine and clopidogrel; other<br>
growth factors involved in regeneration, e.g., VEGF and FGF and mimetics of these<br>
growth factors ; antiapoptotic agents; and motility and morphogenic agents.<br>
[0159] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions of the<br>
present invention further comprise one or more additional therapeutically active<br>
ingredients (e.g., anti-inflammatory and/or palliative). For purposes of the invention,<br>
the term "Palliative " refers to treatment that is focused on the relief of symptoms of<br>
a disease and/or side effects of a therapeutic regimen, but is not curative. For<br>
example, palliative treatment encompasses painkillers, antinausea medications and<br>
anti-sickness drugs.<br>
[0160] 3) Research Uses, Clinical Uses, Pharmaceutical Uses and<br>
Methods of Treatment<br>
[0161] Research Uses<br>
[0162] According to the present invention, the inventive compounds may be<br>
assayed in any of the available assays known in the art for identifying compounds<br>
having the ability to modulate HGF/SF activity and in particular to agonize or mimic<br>
the activities of HGF/SF. For example, the assay may be cellular or non-cellular, in<br>
vivo or in vitro, high- or low-throughput format, etc.<br>
[0163] Thus, in one aspect, compounds of this invention which are of<br>
particular interest include those with HGF/SF-like activity, which:<br>
• exhibit HGF/SF activity;<br>
• exhibit the ability to mimic or agonize HGF/SF activities;<br>
• stimulate cell proliferation;<br>
• exhibit anti-apoptotic activity;<br>
• exhibit antifibrotic activity;<br>
• exhibit angiogenic activity; and/or<br>
• are useful for the treatment of HGF/SF-related conditions, diseases and<br>
disorders.<br>
[0164] Clinical uses of compounds with HGF/SF-like activity<br>
[0165] 1. Fibrotic Liver Disease: Liver fibrosis is the scarring response of<br>
the liver to chronic liver injury; when fibrosis progresses to cirrhosis, morbid<br>
complications can develop. In fact, end-stage liver fibrosis or cirrhosis is the seventh<br>
leading cause of death in the United States, and afflicts hundreds of millions of<br>
people worldwide; deaths from end-stage liver disease in the United States are<br>
expected to triple over the next 10-15 years, mainly due to the hepatitis C<br>
epidemic 1. In addition to the hepatitis C virus, many other forms of chronic liver<br>
injury also lead to end-stage liver disease and cirrhosis, including other viruses such<br>
as hepatitis B and delta hepatitis, chronic alcoholism, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis,<br>
extrahepatic obstructions (stones in the bile duct), cholangiopathies (primary biliary<br>
cirrhosis and sclerosing cholangitis), autoimmune liver disease, and inherited<br>
metabolic disorders (Wilson's disease, hemochromatosis, and alpha-1 antitrypsin<br>
deficiency).<br>
[0166] Treatment of liver fibrosis has focused to date on eliminating the<br>
primary injury. For extrahepatic obstructions, biliary decompression is the<br>
recommended mode of treatment whereas patients with Wilson's disease are treated<br>
with zinc acetate. In chronic hepatitis C infection, interferon has been used as<br>
antiviral therapies with limited response: ~20% when used alone or ~ 50% response<br>
when used in combination with ribavirin. In addition to the low-level of response,<br>
treatment with interferon with or without ribavirin is associated with numerous<br>
severe side effects including neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, depression,<br>
generalized fatigue and flu-like symptoms, which are sufficiently significant to<br>
necessitate cessation of therapy. Treatments for other chronic liver diseases such as<br>
hepatitis B, autoimmune hepatitis and Wilson's disease are also associated with<br>
many side effects, while primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis and<br>
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease have no effective treatment other than liver<br>
transplantation.<br>
[0167] The advantage of treating fibrosis rather than only the underlying<br>
etiology, is that antifibrotic therapies should be broadly applicable across the full<br>
spectrum of chronic liver diseases. While transplantation is currently the most<br>
effective cure for liver fibrosis, mounting evidence indicates that not only fibrosis,<br>
but even cirrhosis is reversible. Unfortunately patients often present with advanced<br>
stages of fibrosis and cirrhosis, when many therapies such as antivirals can no longer<br>
be safely used due to their side effect profile. Such patients would benefit<br>
enormously from effective antifibrotic therapy, because attenuating or reversing<br>
fibrosis may prevent many late stage complications such as infection, asciites, and<br>
loss of liver function and preclude the need for liver transplantation. The<br>
compounds of the invention are beneficial for the treatment of the foregoing<br>
conditions, and generally are antifibrotic and/or antiapoptotic agents for this and<br>
other organ or tissues.<br>
[0168] 2. Hepatic Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury: Currently, transplantation is<br>
the most effective therapeutic strategy for liver fibrosis. However, in spite of the<br>
significant improvement in clinical outcome during the last decade, liver dysfunction<br>
or failure is still a significant clinical problem after transplantation surgery.<br>
Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury to the liver is a major alloantigen-independent<br>
component affecting transplantation outcome, causing up to 10% of early organ<br>
failure, and leading to the higher incidence of both acute and chronic rejection.<br>
Furthermore, given the dramatic organ shortage for transplantation, surgeons are<br>
forced to consider cadaveric or steatotic grafts or other marginal livers, which have a<br>
higher susceptibility to reperfusion injury. In addition to transplantation surgery,<br>
liver IR injury is manifested in clinical situations such as tissue resections (Pringle<br>
maneuver), and hemorrhagic shock.<br>
[0169] The damage to the postischemic liver represents a continuum of<br>
processes that culminate in hepatocellular injury. Ischemia activates Kupffer cells,<br>
which are the main sources of vascular reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation<br>
during the initial reperfusion period. In addition to Kupffer cell-induced oxidant<br>
stress, with increasing length of the ischemic episode, intracellular generation of<br>
ROS by xanthine oxidase and in particular mitochondria may also contribute to liver<br>
dysfunction and cell injury during reperfusion. Endogenous antioxidant compounds,<br>
such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione, alphatocopherol, and beta-<br>
carotene, may all limit the effects of oxidant injury but these systems can quickly<br>
become overwhelmed by large quantities of ROS. Work by Lemasters and<br>
colleagues, has indicated that in addition to formation of ROS, intracellular calcium<br>
dyshomeostasis is a key constributor to liver IR injury. Cell death of hepatocytes and<br>
endothelial cells in this setting is characterized by swelling of cells and their<br>
organelles, release of cell contents, eosinophilia, karyolysis, and induction of<br>
inflammation, characteristic of oncotic necrosis. More recent reports indicate that<br>
liver cells also die by apoptosis, which is morphologically characterized by cell<br>
shrinkage, formation of apoptotic bodies with intact cell organelles and absence of<br>
an inflammatory response.<br>
[0170] Indeed, minimizing the adverse effects of IR injury could<br>
significantly increase the number of patients that may successfully undergo liver<br>
transplantation. Pharmacologic interventions that reduce cell death and/or enhance<br>
organ regeneration represent a therapeutic approach to improve clinical outcome in<br>
liver transplantation, liver surgery with vascular exclusion and trauma and can<br>
therefore reduce recipient/patient morbidity and mortality. The compounds of the<br>
invention are beneficial for the treatment of the foregoing conditions.<br>
[0171] 3. Cerebral Infarction. Stroke and cerebrovascular disease are a<br>
leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the US: at least 600,000 Americans<br>
develop strokes each year, and about 160,000 of these are fatal. Research on the<br>
pathophysiological basis of stroke has produced new paradigms for prevention and<br>
treatment, but translation of these approaches into improved clinical outcomes has<br>
proved to be painfully slow. Preventive strategies focus primarily on reducing or<br>
controlling risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and<br>
lifestyle; in patients with severe stenosis, carotid endarterectomy may be indicated.<br>
Cerebral angioplasty is used investigationally, but the high restenosis rates observed<br>
following coronary angioplasty suggest this approach may pose unacceptable risk<br>
for many patients. Therapeutic strategies focus primarily on acute treatment to<br>
reduce injury in the ischemic penumbra, the region of reversibly damaged tissue<br>
surrounding an infarct. Thrombolytic therapy has been shown to improve perfusion<br>
to the ischemic penumbra, but it must be administered within three hours of the<br>
onset of infarction. Several neuroprotective agents that block specific tissue<br>
responses to ischemia are promising, but none have yet been approved for clinical<br>
use. While these therapeutic approaches limit damage in the ischemic penumbra,<br>
they do not address the underlying problem of inadequate blood supply due to<br>
occluded arteries. An alternative strategy is to induce formation of collateral blood<br>
vessels in the ischemic region; this occurs naturally in chronic ischemic conditions,<br>
but stimulation of vascularization via therapeutic angiogenesis has potential<br>
therapeutic benefit.<br>
[0172] Recent advances in imaging have confirmed the pathophysiological<br>
basis of the clinical observations of evolving stroke. Analysis of impaired cerebral<br>
blood flow (CBF) in the region of an arterial occlusion supports the hypothesis that a<br>
central region of very low CBF, the ischemic core, is irreversibly damaged, but<br>
damage in surrounding or intermixed zones where CBF is of less severely reduced,<br>
the ischemic penumbra, can be limited by timely reperfusion. Plate recently<br>
reviewed the evidence suggesting that therapeutic angiogenesis may be useful for<br>
treatment or prevention of stroke. First, analysis of cerebral vasculature in stroke<br>
patients showed a strong correlation between blood vessel density and survival and a<br>
higher density of microvessels in the ischemic hemisphere compared to the<br>
contralateral region. Second, studies in experimental models of cerebral ischemia<br>
indicate expression of angiogenic growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth<br>
factor (VEGF) or HGF/SF is induced rapidly in ischemic brain tissue. Third,<br>
administration of VEGF or HGF/SF can reduce neuronal damage and infarct volume<br>
in animal models. Similar evidence provided the rationale for developing<br>
therapeutic angiogenesis for treating peripheral and myocardial ischemia, which has<br>
been shown to produce clinical improvements in early studies in humans. The<br>
compounds of the invention are beneficial for the treatment of the foregoing<br>
conditions.<br>
[0173] 4. Ischemic heart disease is a leading cause of morbidity and<br>
mortality in the US, afflicting millions of Americans each year at a cost expected to<br>
exceed $300 billion/year. Numerous pharmacological and interventional approaches<br>
are being developed to improve treatment of ischemic heart disease including<br>
reduction of modifiable risk factors, improved revascularization procedures, and<br>
therapies to halt progression and/or induce regression of atherosclerosis. One of the<br>
most exciting areas of research for the treatment of myocardial ischemia is<br>
therapeutic angiogenesis. Recent studies support the concept that administration of<br>
angiogenic growth factors, either by gene transfer or as a recombinant protein,<br>
augments nutrient perfusion through neovascularization. The newly developed,<br>
supplemental collateral blood vessels constitute endogenous bypass conduits around<br>
occluded native arteries, improving perfusion to ischemic tissue. Some of the best-<br>
studied cytokines with angiogenic activity are vascular endothelial growth factor<br>
(VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and hepatocyte growth factor/scatter<br>
factor (HGF/SF). The compounds of the invention are beneficial for the treatment<br>
of the foregoing conditions.<br>
[0174] 5. Renal Disease. Chronic renal dysfunction is a progressive,<br>
degenerative disorder that ultimately results in acute renal failure and requires<br>
dialysis as an intervention, and renal transplantation as the only potential cure.<br>
Initiating conditions of renal dysfunction include ischemia, diabetes, underlying<br>
cardiovascular disease, or renal toxicity associated with certain chemotherapeutics,<br>
antibiotics, and radiocontrast agents. Most end-stage pathological changes include<br>
extensive fibrinogenesis, epithelial atrophy, and inflammatory cell infiltration into<br>
the kidneys.<br>
[0175] Acute renal failure is often a complication of diseases including<br>
diabetes or renal ischemia, procedures such as heminephrectomy, or as a side effect<br>
of therapeutics administered to treat disease. The widely prescribed anti-tumor drug<br>
cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (cisplatin), for example, has side effects that include<br>
a high incidence of nephrotoxicity and renal dysfunction, mainly in the form of renal<br>
tubular damage that leads to impaired glomerular filtration. Administration of<br>
gentamicin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, or cyclosporin A, a potent<br>
immunosuppressive compound, causes similar nephrotoxicity. The serious side<br>
effects of these effective drugs restrict their use. The development of agents that<br>
protect renal function and enhance renal regeneration after administration of<br>
nephrotoxic drugs will be of substantial benefit to numerous patients, especially<br>
those with malignant tumors, and may allow the maximal therapeutic potentials of<br>
these drugs to be realized. The compounds of the invention are beneficial for the<br>
treatment of the renal diseases mentioned above.<br>
[0176] 6. Lung (Pulmonary) Fibrosis. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)<br>
accounts for a majority of chronic interstitial lung diseases, and has an estimated<br>
incidence rate of 10.7 cases for 100,000 per year, with an estimated mortality of 50-<br>
70%. IPF is characterized by an abnormal deposition of collagen in the lung with an<br>
unknown etiology. Although the precise sequence of the pathogenic sequelae is<br>
unknown, disease progression involves epithelial injury and activation, formation of<br>
distinctive subepithelial fibroblast/myofibroblast foci, and excessive extracellular<br>
matrix accumulation. The development of this pathological process is preceded by<br>
an inflammatory response, often dominated by macrophages and lymphocytes,<br>
which is mediated by the local release of chemoattractant factors and upregulation of<br>
cell-surface adhesion molecules. Lung injury leads to vasodilatation and leakage of<br>
plasma proteins into interstitial and alveolar spaces, as well as activation of the<br>
coagulation cascade and deposition of fibrin. Fibroblasts migrate into this<br>
provisional fibrin matrix where they synthesize extracellular matrix molecules. In<br>
non-pathogenic conditions, excess fibrin is usually degraded by plasmin, a<br>
proteinase that also has a role in the activation of matrix metalloproteinases<br>
(MMPs). Activated MMPs degrade extracellular matrix and participate in fibrin<br>
removal, resulting in the clearance of the alveolar spaces and the ultimate restoration<br>
of injured tissues. In pathological conditions, however, these processes can lead to<br>
progressive and irreversible changes in lung architecture, resulting in progressive<br>
respiratory insufficiency and an almost universally terminal outcome in a relatively<br>
short period of time. Fibrosis is the final common pathway of a variety of lung<br>
disorders, and in this context, the diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis implies the<br>
recognition of an advanced stage in the evolution of a complex process of abnormal<br>
repair. While many studies have focused on inflammatory mechanisms for initiating<br>
the fibrotic response, the synthesis and degradation the extracellular matrix represent<br>
the central event of the disease. It is this process that presents a very attractive site<br>
of therapeutic intervention.<br>
[0177] The course of IPF is characterized by progressive respiratory<br>
insufficiency, leading to death within 3 to 8 years from the. onset of symptoms.<br>
Management of interstitial lung disease in general, and in particular idiopathic<br>
pulmonary fibrosis, is difficult, unpredictable and unsatisfactory. Attempts have<br>
been made to use antiinflammatory therapy to reverse inflammation, relief, stop<br>
disease progression and prolong survival. Corticosteroids are the most frequently<br>
used antiinflammatory agents and have been the mainstay of therapy for IPF for<br>
more than four decades, but the efficacy of this approach is unproven, and toxicities<br>
are substantial. No studies have compared differing dosages or duration of<br>
corticosteroid treatment in matched patients. Interpretation of therapy efficacy is<br>
obscured by several factors including heterogeneous patient populations, inclusion<br>
of patients with histologic entities other than usual interstitial pneumonia, lack of<br>
objective, validated endpoints, and different criteria for "response." Cytotoxic drugs<br>
such as Azathioprine and cyclophosohamide have also being used in combination<br>
with low dose oral corticosteroids. The results of such treatments vary from no<br>
improvement to significant prolongation of survival. Overall, currently available<br>
treatments for lung fibrosis are sub-optimal. Potential new therapies have emerged<br>
from the use of animal models of pulmonary fibrosis and recent advances in the<br>
cellular and molecular biology of inflammatory reactions. Such therapies involve the<br>
use of cytokines, oxidants and growth factors that are elaborated during the fibrotic<br>
reaction. Despite the use of newer strategies for treatment, the overall prognosis for<br>
patients with interstitial lung disease has had little quantifiable change, and the<br>
population survival remains unchanged for the last 30 years. Interferon gamma<br>
(IFN) may be effective in the treatment of IPF in some patients but its role is<br>
controversial. Literature indicated that IFN-gamma may be involved in small airway<br>
disease in silicotic lung. Others showed that IFN gamma mediates, bleomycin-<br>
induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. Recently, hepatocyte growth factor<br>
(HGF), also known as scatter factor (SF) has emerged as a attractive target for the<br>
development of antifibrotic agents. The compounds of the invention are beneficial<br>
for the treatment of the foregoing condition, among other fibrotic diseases.<br>
[0178] Exemplary assays<br>
[0179] Efficacy of the compounds of the invention on the aforementioned<br>
disorders and diseases or the potential to be of benefit for the prophylaxis or<br>
treatment thereof may be demonstrated in various studies, ranging from biochemical<br>
effects evaluated in vitro and effects on cells in culture, to in-vivo models of disease,<br>
wherein direct clinical manifestations of the disease can be observed and measured,<br>
or wherein early structural and/or functional events occur that are established to be<br>
involved in the initiation or progression of the disease. The positive effects of the<br>
compounds of the invention have been demonstrated in a variety of such assays and<br>
models, for a number of diseases and disorders. One skilled in the art can readily<br>
determine following the guidance described herein whether a compound of the<br>
invention is an HGF/SF mimick and is useful therapeutically in the same manner as<br>
HGF/SF, or is an antagonist and is useful where the activities of HGF/SF are not<br>
desired or are to be inhibited.<br>
[0180] 1. In vitro stimulation of proliferation and scatter<br>
a. Endothelial cell proliferation. Proliferation of human umbilical vein<br>
endothelial cells and monkey bronchial epithelial cells ([3H]-thymidine<br>
incorporation) by compounds of the invention produce a response similar to that of<br>
HGF/SF.<br>
b. Renal cell scatter. The ability to scatter cultured MDCK cells is highly<br>
specific for compounds with HGF/SF activity. Compounds of the invention scatter<br>
MDCK cells in a manner similar to HGF/SF.<br>
[0181] 2. Cellular Signaling<br>
a. Phosphorylation of c-met. In both human umbilical vein endothelial cells<br>
(HUVECs) and MDCK cells the instant compounds induce phosphorylation of c-<br>
met in a dose-dependent manner similar to HGF/SF. The assay is performed by<br>
immunoprecipitation of phosphorylated c-met followed by SDS-PAGE and<br>
chemiluminescence detection, standardized to total c-met.<br>
b. Intracellular signaling induced by compounds of the invention and<br>
HGF/SF. In HUVECs the compounds induce phosphorylation of extracellular<br>
receptor kinase (ERK) (as determined by immunoprecipitation followed by SDS-<br>
PAGE and chemiluminescence) similar to HGF/SF. In addition, the<br>
phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin and an Akt inhibitor prevents<br>
compound- and HGF/SF-induced endothelial cell proliferation, suggesting that both<br>
the instant compounds and HGF/SF exert biological effects through the same<br>
intracellular signaling pathways.<br>
c. HGF and compounds of the invention stimulate nitric oxide production in<br>
endothelial cells. HUVECs are incubated with either vehicle, HGF/SF, instant<br>
compounds, or SNAP for 24 hours, loaded with the nitric oxide-sensitive<br>
fluorescence indicator DAF 2-DA and imaged under a laser scanning confocal<br>
microscope. HGF/SF, instant compounds and SNAP all cause a significant increase<br>
in fluorescence indicating robust production of nitric oxide.<br>
[0182] 3. Anti-apoptotic activity<br>
a. HGF/SF and instant compounds have significant anti-apoptotic activity in<br>
cultured cell lines. Like HGF/SF, the compounds are able to significantly block<br>
adriamycin-induced apoptosis in MDCK cells. Pretreatment with either HGF/SF or<br>
compound significantly improves the cell viability of both HUVEC and MDCK cell<br>
lines.<br>
b. Protection from apoptosis in NIH-3T3 cells transfected with c-met<br>
receptor. NIH-3T3 cells transfected with the gene for the c-met receptor confers the<br>
ability for both HGF/SF and compounds of the invention to protect the cells from<br>
adriamycin-induced apoptosis (MTT assay). There is no protection from apoptosis<br>
by compounds in non-transfected cells lacking the c-met receptor, demonstrating the<br>
requirement of c-met for the cyto-protective actions of HGF/SF and instant<br>
compounds.<br>
[0183] 4. Angiogenesis<br>
a. Aortic ring assay. Thoracic artery rings from rats are embedded in<br>
Matrigel and grown for 5 days in the presence or absence of HGF/SF or compounds<br>
of the invention. Treatment with compounds of the invention causes an increased<br>
outgrowth from the rings similar to that seen with HGF/SF.<br>
b. In vivo Matrigel assay. Matrigel mixed with a compound of the invention<br>
or vehicle is injected into the abdominal subcutaneous tissue of C57BL/6 mice.<br>
When harvested 10 days later, the compound is found to induce blood vessel<br>
formation into the Matrigel plugs, demonstrating that the compound can exert its<br>
angiogenic effects in vivo.<br>
c. Mouse hindlimb ischemia model. In a mouse hindlimb ischemia model<br>
treatment with a compound of the invention produces greater recovery of hindlimb<br>
blow flow (as measured by laser Doppler imaging). Improved flux is associated<br>
with an increased number of capillaries in the ischemic muscle.<br>
d. Hindlimb ischemia in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. In female NOD<br>
mice subjected to hindlimb ischemia, hindlimb blood flow (measured using a Laser<br>
Doppler imager) demonstrates recovery by administration of a compound of the<br>
invention.<br>
e. Angiogenesis in full-thickness cutaneous wounds. In full thickness<br>
cutaneous wounds in pigs significant increases are observed in capillary numbers<br>
after treatment with a compound of the invention, or Ad5-HGF/SF (an adenoviral<br>
vector expressing the gene for HGF/SF).<br>
[0184] 5. Hepatic Disease<br>
a. Antifibrotic Activity in Hepatic Stellate Cells. Serum starved (activated)<br>
LX2 cells (an immortalized human hepatic stellate cell line) that are treated with<br>
HGF/SF or a compound of the invention show a decrease in collagen I mRNA<br>
expression, as well as expression of other fibrotic marker genes, related to<br>
significant antifibrotic activity.<br>
b. Liver Disease endpoints. The rat model of thioacetamide (TAA)-induced<br>
liver fibrosis and the rat bile duct ligation model of fibrosis showed improvements<br>
by the compounds of the invention, in a panel of functional and histological tests:<br>
gross morphology, mass, portal pressure, presence of ascites, enzymes (AST, ALT),<br>
collagen content, interstitial fibrosis and alpha-smooth muscle actin and MMP-2.<br>
[0185] 6. Protection Against Renal Dysfunction<br>
a. Clinical model: arterial occlusion. In a mouse model of transient<br>
unilateral renal artery occlusion, male ICR mice were anesthetized and the left renal<br>
artery occluded with a microvascular clamp. After 30 minutes, the clamp was<br>
removed and the kidney allowed to reperfuse. Ten minutes into reperfusion the<br>
nonischemic contralateral kidney was excised. Animals were treated daily with<br>
vehicle or compound of the invention (lmg/kg, i.p.) until the day of sacrifice.<br>
Serum creatinine, BUN and urine protein levels, measured at 1,4 and 7 days<br>
postischemia were used to determine the ability of compounds of the invention to<br>
restore function to injured kidneys. In order to create a more severe renal injury,<br>
animals were subjected to 45 minutes of ischemia.<br>
b. Protection against HgCl2-induced renal injury. In a study mice were<br>
injected with a high dose of HgCl2 (7 mg/kg, s.c.) and divided into treatment groups.<br>
Animals in the first group received vehicle or a compound of the invention (1<br>
mg/kg, i.p.) on the day of toxin injection and daily thereafter for 3 days, and were<br>
euthanized on day 4. Blood samples collected prior to HgCl2 injection, on day 2 and<br>
on day 4 were analyzed for serum creatinine. In the second group, treatment with<br>
vehicle or compound began on the day following toxin injection (i.e., 24h delayed<br>
treatment) and daily thereafter until day 6. Mice were euthanized on day 7. Blood<br>
samples collected prior to HgCl2 injection, on day 4 and day 7 were analyzed for<br>
serum creatinine and BUN. Serum creatinine, BUN, and evelopment of tubular<br>
necrosis were measured to indicate positive clinical activity.<br>
c. Protection against ureteral obstruction. The effects of the compounds of<br>
invention on renal injury secondary to ureteral obstruction were examined in a<br>
mouse model of transient unilateral renal artery occlusion. Kidneys from mice<br>
subjected to unilateral ureteral obstruction for 2 weeks were examined for<br>
histological evidence of injury and protection by compound treatment.<br>
Immunohistochemical staining was performed for fibronectin, proliferating cell<br>
nuclear antigen, and TUNEL (for an assessment of apoptosis). Trichrome staining<br>
was also performed to assess the extent of collagen formation as an indication of<br>
interstitial fibrosis.<br>
[0186] 7. Cerebral infarction / stroke<br>
a. Neuroprotective Effects in Brain Tissue. Cerebral infarction was induced<br>
in rats by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 24 hr. Test compound or<br>
vehicle was administered by i.p. at 2 mg/kg at -24, 0, and 8 hr. Sections of the brain<br>
were then examined for cell death by staining with a tetrazolium compound (2,3,5-<br>
Triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride, or TTC). Normal rat brains exhibit a red<br>
staining due to TTC reduction whereas areas containing dead cells are white.<br>
[0187] 8. Myocardial Infarction<br>
a. Ability of the compounds of the invention to inhibit apoptosis in a rat<br>
model of myocardial infarction (as mentioned above). Hearts from rats subjected to<br>
left coronary artery ligation are treated with compound (or vehicle control) by direct<br>
injection and 24 hours later sectioned and TUNEL stained. There is a significant<br>
reduction in the number of apoptotic nuclei in rats treated with compound.<br>
b. Clinical model. In a rat ischemia model, myocardial infarction was<br>
induced by anterior descending artery occlusion. The infarction was evident by an<br>
increase in positive TUNEL staining, indicating DNA fragmentation in late-stage<br>
apoptosis. Treatment with compounds of the invention greatly reduced the extent of<br>
TUNEL staining.<br>
[0188] 9. Transplantation and Organ Preservation<br>
a. The viability of organs and tissues harvested and transported for<br>
transplant is currently optimally maintained by bathing and transport in storage<br>
solutions such as the University of Wisconsin (UW) cold storage solution (100 mM<br>
KH2PO4, 5 mM MgSO4 100 mM potassium lactobionate, 1 mM allopurinol, 3 mM<br>

[0189] 10. Lung fibrosis<br>
[0190] In order to assess the effects of C6 on pulmonary fibrosis we used a<br>
well-established mouse model of bleomycin-induced lung injury. Male C57BL/6<br>
mice (20-30g, n=10/group) were treated with bleomycin (0.06U/20 gram body<br>
weight) or saline via intratracheal administration. Bleomycin-treated mice were<br>
divided into 2 groups. Compounds of the invention (1mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle was<br>
administered daily until sacrifice on day 12. Right lung samples from the mice were<br>
then harvested for analysis. Tissues were sectioned and stained with modified<br>
Masson's Trichrome and analyzed for interstitial fibrosis. The Ashcroft scale was<br>
used to obtain a numerical fibrotic score with each specimen being scored<br>
independently by two histopathologists, and the mean of their individual scores<br>
considered as the fibrotic score.<br>
[0191] 11. Diabetes mellitus<br>
a. Compounds of the invention reduces hyperglycemia in diabetic mice.<br>
Normal CD-I mice were induced to develop hyperglycemia (diabetes) by i.v.<br>
injection with 100 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ) followed by measurement of blood<br>
glucose in a week. The animals were treated with test compound at 2 mg/kg or<br>
vehicle daily starting the same day of STZ injection. Glucose samples were taken<br>
from the tail vein at day 7 with Ascensia ELITE blood glucose test strips (Bayer),<br>
and the blood glucose concentration was determined by glucose meters (Bayer).<br>
STZ induced diabetes, as shown by a significant increase in blood glucose levels<br>
compared to that in normal mice. Compounds of the invention reduced blood<br>
glucose levels.<br>
[0192] As detailed in the exemplification herein, in assays to determine the<br>
ability of compounds to stimulate cell growth among other HGF/SF-like activities<br>
measured in vitro, certain inventive compounds exhibited ED50 values = 50 µM. In<br>
certain other embodiments, inventive compounds exhibit ED50 values = 40 µM. In<br>
certain other embodiments, inventive compounds exhibit ED50 values = 30 µM. In<br>
certain other embodiments, inventive compounds exhibit ED50 values = 20 µM. In<br>
certain other embodiments, inventive compounds exhibit ED50 values = 10 µM. In<br>
certain other embodiments, inventive compounds exhibit ED50 values = 7.5 µM. In<br>
certain embodiments, inventive compounds exhibit ED50 values = 5 µM. In certain<br>
other embodiments, inventive compounds exhibit ED50 values = 2.5 µM. In certain<br>
embodiments, inventive compounds exhibit ED50 values = 1 µM. In certain other<br>
embodiments, inventive compounds exhibit ED50 values = 750 nM. In certain other<br>
embodiments, inventive compounds exhibit ED50 values = 500 nM. In certain other<br>
embodiments, inventive compounds exhibit ED50 values = 250 nM. In certain other<br>
embodiments, inventive compounds exhibit ED50 values = 100 nM. In other<br>
embodiments, exemplary compounds exhibited ED50 values = 75 nM. In other<br>
embodiments, exemplary compounds exhibited ED50 values = 50 nM. In other<br>
embodiments, exemplary compounds exhibited ED50 values = 40 nM. In other<br>
embodiments, exemplary compounds exhibited ED50 values = 30 nM. In other<br>
embodiments, exemplary compounds exhibited ED50 values = 20 nM. In other<br>
embodiments, exemplary compounds exhibited ED50 values = 10 nM. In other<br>
embodiments, exemplary compounds exhibited ED50 values = 5 nM.<br>
[0193] In certain other embodiments, certain compounds of the invention<br>
have HGF/SF antagonist activity and may be assayed in any of the available assays<br>
known in the art for identifying compounds having the ability to modulate HGF/SF<br>
activity and/or to antagonize HGF/SF. For example, the assay may be cellular or<br>
non-cellular, in vivo or in vitro, high- or low-throughput format, etc.<br>
[0194] Certain compounds of the invention of particular interest include<br>
those with HGF/SF antagonistic activity, which:<br>
• modulate HGF/SF activity;<br>
• exhibit the ability to antagonize HGF/SF;<br>
• inhibit cell proliferation;<br>
• exhibit apoptotic activity;<br>
• exhibit anti-angiogenic activity; and/or<br>
• are useful for the treatment of HGF/SF-induced disorders.<br>
Such assays are, for examples<br>
1. Inhibition of dysproliferative cell growth<br>
2. Inhibition of scatter / metastasis<br>
3. Inflammatory joint disease model<br>
4. Rheumatoid arthritis model<br>
[0195] Clinical uses of compounds with HGF/SF antagonistic activity<br>
[0196] Hyperproliferative disorders. In other cases where abnormal or<br>
excessive cellular proliferation is the cause of pathology, such as in dysproliferative<br>
diseases including cancer, inflammatory joint and skin diseases such as rheumatoid<br>
arthritis, and neovascularization in the eye as a consequence of diabetic retinopathy,<br>
suppression of cellular proliferation is a desired goal in the treatment of these and<br>
other conditions. In either case, therapy to promote or suppress proliferation may be<br>
beneficial locally but not systemically, and for a particular duration, and<br>
proliferation-modulating therapies must be appropriately applied. Certain<br>
compounds of the invention are beneficial for the treatment of cancer and other<br>
dysproliferative diseases and conditions. In certain embodiments, inventive<br>
compounds that antagonize HGF/SF activity may be used for this purpose.<br>
[0197] Conditions and diseases amenable to prophylaxis or treatment with<br>
the HGF/SF antagonist compounds of the invention include but are not limited to<br>
those in which abnormal vascular or cellular proliferation occurs. Such conditions<br>
and diseases include as in dysproliferative diseases including cancer and psoriasis,<br>
various inflammatory diseases characterized by proliferation of cells such as<br>
atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, and neovascularization in the eye as a<br>
consequence of diabetic retinopathy, suppression of cellular proliferation is a desired<br>
goal in the treatment of these and other conditions. As certain of the compounds of<br>
the invention have been found to possess antiproliferative activity on cells, as well<br>
as antiangiogenic activity, both activities may be beneficial in the treatment of, for<br>
example, solid tumors, in which both the dysproliferative cells and the enhanced<br>
tumor vasculature elicited thereby are targets for inhibition by the agents of the<br>
invention. In either case, therapy to promote or suppress proliferation may be<br>
beneficial locally but not systemically, and for a particular duration, and<br>
proliferation modulating therapies must be appropriately applied. The invention<br>
embraces localized delivery of such compounds to the affected tissues and organs, to<br>
achieve a particular effect.<br>
[0198] Expression of scatter factor (HGF/SF), and its receptor, c-Met, is<br>
often associated with malignant progression (metastasis) of human tumors, including<br>
gliomas. Overexpression of HGF/SF in experimental gliomas enhances<br>
tumorigenicity and tumor-associated angiogenesis (i.e., growth of new blood<br>
vessels). More recent studies showed that human glioblastomas are HGF/SF-c-Met<br>
dependent and that a reduction in endogenous HGF/SF or c-Met expression can lead<br>
to inhibition of tumor growth and tumorigenicity. Thus, targeting the HGF/SF-c-Met<br>
signaling pathway using a compound as characterized above is an important<br>
approach in controlling tumor progression.<br>
[0199] Examples of cancers, tumors, malignancies, neoplasms, and other<br>
dysproliferative diseases that can be treated according to the invention include<br>
leukemias such as myeloid and lymphocytic leukemias, lymphomas,<br>
myeloproliferative diseases, and solid tumors, such as but not limited to sarcomas<br>
and carcinomas such as fibrosarcoma, myxosarcoma, liposarcoma, chondrosarcoma,<br>
osteogenic sarcoma, chordoma, angiosarcoma, endotheliosarcoma,<br>
lymphangiosarcoma, lymphangioendotheliosarcoma, synovioma, mesothelioma,<br>
Ewing's tumor, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, colon carcinoma, pancreatic<br>
cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, squamous cell carcinoma,<br>
basal cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, sweat gland carcinoma, sebaceous gland<br>
carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, papillary adenocarcinomas, cystadenocarcinoma,<br>
medullary carcinoma, bronchogenic carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, hepatoma, bile<br>
duct carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, Wilms' tumor,<br>
cervical cancer, testicular tumor, lung carcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma, bladder<br>
carcinoma, epithelial carcinoma, glioma, astrocytoma, medulloblastoma,<br>
craniopharyngioma, ependymoma, pinealoma, hemangioblastoma, acoustic<br>
neuroma, oligodendroglioma, meningioma, melanoma, neuroblastoma, and<br>
retinoblastoma.<br>
[0200] The present invention is also directed to treatment of non-malignant<br>
tumors and other disorders involving inappropriate cell or tissue growth by<br>
administering a therapeutically effective amount of an agent of the invention. For<br>
example, it is contemplated that the invention is useful for the treatment of<br>
arteriovenous (AV) malformations, particularly in intracranial sites. The invention<br>
may also be used to treat psoriasis, a dermatologic condition that is characterized by<br>
inflammation and vascular proliferation; benign prostatic hypertrophy, a condition<br>
associated with inflammation and possibly vascular proliferation; and cutaneous<br>
fungal infections. Treatment of other hyperproliferative disorders is also<br>
contemplated. The agents may also be used topically to remove warts, birthmarks,<br>
moles, nevi, skin tags, lipomas, angiomas including hemangiomas, and other<br>
cutaneous lesions for cosmetic or other purposes.<br>
[0201] As noted above, other uses of the compounds herein include<br>
intentional ablation or destruction of tissues or organs in a human or animal, for<br>
example, in the area of animal husbandry, and in the field of reproductive biology, to<br>
reduce the number of developing embryos; as an abortifacient, and as a means to<br>
achieve a biochemical castration, particularly for livestock and domesticated animals<br>
such as pets.<br>
[0202] As mentioned above, vascularization of the vitreous humor of the eye<br>
as a consequence of diabetic retinopathy is a major cause of blindness, and<br>
inhibition of such vascularization is desirable. Other conditions in which<br>
vascularization is undesirable include certain chronic inflammatory diseases, in<br>
particular inflammatory joint and skin disease, but also other inflammatory diseases<br>
in which a proliferative response occurs and is responsible for part of all of the<br>
pathology. For example, psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disease<br>
characterized by prominent epidermal hyperplasia and neovascularization in the<br>
dermal papillae. Proliferation of smooth muscle cells, perhaps as a consequence of<br>
growth factors, is a factor in the narrowing and occlusion of the macrovasculature in<br>
atherosclerosis, responsible for myocardial ischemia, angina, myocardial infarction,<br>
and stroke, to name a few examples. Peripheral vascular disease and arteriosclerosis<br>
obliterans comprise an inflammatory component.<br>
[0203] Moreover, localized ablation of tissues or even organs using<br>
antiproliferative or antiangiogenic compounds as characterized herein may find use<br>
in treatment of certain central nervous system diseases or conditions which<br>
otherwise may require dangerous invasive procedures; removal of cosmetically<br>
undesirable cutaneous lesions are farther targets for the antiproliferative agents of<br>
the invention. In reproductive biology, such antiproliferative agents may be used as<br>
abortifacients or for non-surgical castration, particularly for use in livestock and<br>
domesticated animals. These are also merely illustrative of the uses of the instant<br>
agents.<br>
[0204] Pharmaceutical Uses and Methods of Treatment<br>
[0205] As discussed above, certain of the compounds as described herein<br>
exhibit activity generally as modulators of HGF/SF activity. More specifically,<br>
compounds of the invention demonstrate the ability to agonize HGF/SF activity.<br>
Thus, in certain embodiments, compounds of the invention are useful for the<br>
treatment of any of a number of conditions or diseases in which HGF/SF or the<br>
activities thereof have a therapeutically useful role, in particular antifibrotic and<br>
antiapoptotic activities. Thus, compounds of the invention are useful for the<br>
treatment of any condition, disease or disorder in which HGF/SF would have a<br>
beneficial role.<br>
[0206] Accordingly, in another aspect of the invention, methods for the<br>
treatment of HGF/SF activity related disorders are provided comprising<br>
administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I), (II)<br>
or (III) as described herein, to a subject in need thereof. In certain embodiments, a<br>
method for the treatment of HGF/SF activity related disorders is provided<br>
comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of an inventive<br>
compound, or a pharmaceutical composition comprising an inventive compound to a<br>
subject in need thereof, in such amounts and for such time as is necessary to achieve<br>
the desired result.<br>
[0207] In certain embodiments, the method involves the administration of a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of the compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
derivative thereof to a subject (including, but not limited to a human or animal) in<br>
need of it. Subjects for which the benefits of the compounds of the invention are<br>
intended for administration include, in addition to humans, livestock, domesticated,<br>
zoo and companion animals.<br>
[0208] As discussed above this invention provides novel compounds that<br>
have biological properties useful for modulating, and preferably mimicking or<br>
agonizing, HGF/SF activity. In certain embodiments, the inventive compounds are<br>
useful for the treatment of wounds for acceleration of healing (wound healing may<br>
be accelerated by promoting cellular proliferation, particularly of vascular cells),<br>
normalization of myocardial perfusion as a consequence of chronic cardiac ischemia<br>
or myocardial infarction, development or augmentation of collateral vessel<br>
development after vascular occlusion or to ischemic tissues or organs, flbrotic<br>
diseases, hepatic disease including fibrosis and cirrhosis, lung fibrosis, renal failure,<br>
renal fibrosis, cerebral infarction (stroke), diabetes mellitus, and vascularization of<br>
grafted or transplanted tissues or organs. Renal conditions for which compounds of<br>
the invention may prove useful include: radiocontrast nephropathy; fibrosis<br>
secondary to renal obstruction; indication for renal trauma and transplantation; renal<br>
failure secondary to chronic diabetes and/or hypertension.<br>
[0209] Thus, as described above, in another aspect of the invention, a<br>
method for the treatment of disorders related to HGF/SF activity is provided<br>
comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of<br>
formula (I), (II) or (III) as described herein, to a subject in need thereof. In certain<br>
embodiments of special interest the inventive method is used for the treatment of, in<br>
the case of HGF/SF agonists or mimics, hepatic disease, stroke, myocardial<br>
infarction and other ischemic or fibrotic diseases; and in the case of HGF/SF<br>
antagonists, cancer or other dysproliferative diseases. In certain embodiments,<br>
compounds of Formula II are HGF/SF agonists or mimics. In certain other<br>
embodiments, compounds of Formula III are agonists. In yet other embodiments,<br>
certain compounds of Formula III are antagonists. In another aspect, agonists may<br>
be used to preserve organs and tissues identified for transplantation, and may be<br>
infused into the donor, perfused into the harvested organs and tissues or provided as<br>
a bath, and administered to the recipient. It will be appreciated that the compounds<br>
and compositions, according to the method of the present invention, may be<br>
administered using any amount and any route of administration effective for the<br>
treatment of conditions or diseases in which HGF/SF or the activities thereof have a<br>
therapeutically useful role. Thus, the expression "effective amount" as used herein,<br>
refers to a sufficient amount of agent to modulate HGF/SF activity (e.g., mimic<br>
HGF/SF activity), and to exhibit a therapeutic effect. The exact amount required<br>
will vary from subject to subject, depending on the species, age, and general<br>
condition of the subject, the severity of the infection, the particular therapeutic<br>
agent, its mode and/or route of administration, and the like. The compounds of the<br>
invention are preferably formulated in dosage unit form for ease of administration<br>
and uniformity of dosage. The expression "dosage unit form" as used herein refers<br>
to a physically discrete unit of therapeutic agent appropriate for the patient to be<br>
treated. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compounds<br>
and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician<br>
within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific therapeutically effective<br>
dose level for any particular patient or organism will depend upon a variety of<br>
factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the<br>
activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed; the<br>
age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of<br>
administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific<br>
compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or<br>
coincidental with the specific compound employed; and like factors well known in<br>
the medical arts.<br>
[0210] Furthermore, after formulation with an appropriate pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier in a desired dosage, the pharmaceutical compositions of this<br>
invention can be administered to humans and other animals orally, rectally,<br>
parenterally, intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously,<br>
intradermally, intra-ocularly, topically (as by powders, ointments, or drops),<br>
buccally, as an oral or nasal spray, or the like, depending on the severity of the<br>
disease or disorder being treated. In certain embodiments, the compounds of the<br>
invention may be administered at dosage levels of about 0.001 mg/kg to about 50<br>
mg/kg, preferably from about 0. 1 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg for parenteral<br>
administration, or preferably from about 1 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg, more<br>
preferably from about 10 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg for oral administration, of<br>
subject body weight per day, one or more times a day, to obtain the desired<br>
therapeutic effect. It will also be appreciated that dosages smaller than 0.001 mg/kg<br>
or greater than 50 mg/kg (for example 50-100 mg/kg) can be administered to a<br>
subject. In certain embodiments, compounds are administered orally or parenterally.<br>
[0211] Moreover, pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more<br>
compounds of the invention may also contain other compounds or agents for which<br>
co-administration with the compound(s) of the invention is therapeutically<br>
advantageous. As many pharmaceutical agents are used in the treatment of the<br>
diseases and disorders for which the compounds of the invention are also beneficial,<br>
any may be formulated together for administration. Synergistic formulations are<br>
also embraced herein, where the combination of at least one compound of the<br>
invention and at least one other compounds act more beneficially than when each is<br>
given alone. Non-limiting examples of pharmaceutical agents that may be combined<br>
therapeutically with compounds of the invention include (non-limiting examples of<br>
diseases or conditions treated with such combination are indicated in parentheses):<br>
antivirals and antifibrotics, such as interferon alpha (hepatitis B, and hepatitis C),<br>
combination of interferon alpha and ribavirin (hepatitis C), Lamivudine (hepatitis<br>
B), Adefovir dipivoxil (hepatitis B), interferon gamma (idiopathic pulmonary<br>
fibrosis, liver fibrosis, and fibrosis in other organs); anticoagulants, e.g,,heparin and<br>
warfarin (ischemic stroke); antiplatelets e.g., aspirin, ticlopidine and clopidogrel<br>
(ischemic stroke); other growth factors involved in regeneration, e.g., VEGF and<br>
FGF and mimetics of these growth factors; antiapoptotic agents; and motility and<br>
morphogenic agents.<br>
Treatment Kit<br>
[0212] In other embodiments, the present invention relates to a kit for<br>
conveniently and effectively carrying out the methods in accordance with the present<br>
invention. In general, the pharmaceutical pack or kit comprises one or more<br>
containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of the invention. Such kits are especially suited for the delivery of<br>
solid oral forms such as tablets or capsules. Such a kit preferably includes a number<br>
of unit dosages, and may also include a card having the dosages oriented in the order<br>
of their intended use. If desired, a memory aid can be provided, for example in the<br>
form of numbers, letters, or other markings or with a calendar insert, designating the<br>
days in the treatment schedule in which the dosages can be administered.<br>
Alternatively, placebo dosages, or calcium dietary supplements, either in a form<br>
similar to or distinct from the dosages of the pharmaceutical compositions, can be<br>
included to provide a kit in which a dosage is taken every day. Optionally<br>
associated with such container(s) can be a notice in the form prescribed by a<br>
governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceutical<br>
products, which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture, use or sale<br>
for human administration.<br>

[0223] The starting materials, intermediates, and compounds of this<br>
invention may be isolated and purified using conventional techniques, including<br>
filtration, distillation, crystallization, chromatography, and the like. They may be<br>
characterized using conventional methods, including physical constants and spectral<br>
data.<br>
[0224] General Reaction Procedures:<br>
[0225] Unless mentioned specifically, reaction mixtures were stirred using a<br>
magnetically driven stirrer bar. An inert atmosphere refers to either dry argon or dry<br>
nitrogen. Reactions were monitored either by thin layer chromatography, by proton<br>
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or by high-pressure liquid chromatography<br>
(HPLC), of a suitably worked up sample of the reaction mixture.<br>
[0226] General Work Up Procedures:<br>
[0227] Unless mentioned specifically, reaction mixtures were cooled to room<br>
temperature or below then quenched, when necessary, with either water or a<br>
saturated aqueous solution of ammonium chloride. Desired products were extracted<br>
by partitioning between water and a suitable water-immiscible solvent (e.g. ethyl<br>
acetate, dichloromethane, diethyl ether). The desired product containing extracts<br>
were washed appropriately with water followed by a saturated solution of brine. On<br>
occasions where the product containing extract was deemed to contain residual<br>
oxidants, the extract was washed with a 10% solution of sodium sulphite in saturated<br>
aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution, prior to the aforementioned washing<br>
procedure. On occasions where the product containing extract was deemed to<br>
contain residual acids, the extract was washed with saturated aqueous sodium<br>
bicarbonate solution, prior to the aforementioned washing procedure (except in those<br>
cases where the desired product itself had acidic character). On occasions where the<br>
product containing extract was deemed to contain residual bases, the extract was<br>
washed with 10% aqueous citric acid solution, prior to the aforementioned washing<br>
procedure (except in those cases where the desired product itself had basic<br>
character). Post washing, the desired product containing extracts were dried over<br>
anhydrous magnesium sulphate, and then filtered. The crude products were then<br>
isolated by removal of solvent(s) by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure, at an<br>
appropriate temperature (generally less than 45 0°C).<br>
[0228] General Purification Procedures:<br>
[0229] Unless mentioned specifically, chromatographic purification refers to<br>
flash column chromatography on silica, using a single solvent or mixed solvent as<br>
eluent. Suitably purified desired product containing elutes were combined and<br>
concentrated under reduced pressure at an appropriate temperature (generally less<br>
than 45°C) to constant mass. Final compounds were dissolved in 50% aqueous<br>
acetonitrile, filtered and transferred to vials, then freeze-dried under high vacuum<br>
before submission for biological testing.<br>

available or readily accessibly through laboratory synthesis by anyone reasonably<br>
familiar with the art. Described generally below, are procedures and general<br>
guidance for the synthesis of compounds as described generally and in subclasses<br>

[0232] Mono-substituted pyrazoles (C(3) and C(5) tautomers)<br>
[0233] The skilled practitioner will recognize that C(3)- and C(5)-substituted<br>
1H-pyrazole tautomers typically exist as mixtures which rapidly interconvert in<br>
solution. Because of this rapid proton transfer, 3- and 5-substituted pyrazole<br>
tautomers do not normally have separate existance. The tautomers may, however,<br>
exist in solution predominantly in one form. See, for example, T.L. Gilchrist,<br>
"Heterocyclic Chemistry" 2nd Edition, Longman Scientific and Technical, 1992; p<br>
287; which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0234] Thus, the synthetic guidance provided herein is relevant to both 3-<br>
and 5-substituted pyrazole tautomers.<br>
[0235] In certain exemplary embodiments, compounds of formula (II) where<br>
R3 is -CH=CH-R may be prepared as follows:<br>
[0236] For example, the preparation of 4-bromocrotonaldehyde (3) may be<br>
achieved using a modification of a literature method (Kinoshita, M. et al. Bull.<br>
Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1987, 60, 2151-2162). Conversion of 3 to 4 may be carried out<br>
using the method described in the literature (Natchev, I. A. Tetrahedron 1988, 44,<br>
1511-1522), involving treatment of aldehyde 3 with triethylorthoformate in the<br>
presence of ammonium nitrate. The crude product may be purified by distillation.<br>
Conversion of 4 to 5 may be conducted as described by Natchev. As above, the<br>
product may be purified by distillation. Conversion of 5 to the final desired reagent<br>
6 may be accomplished using known methods (See, for example, Almirante, N. et al.<br>
Tetrahedron Lett. 1998, 39, 3287).<br>
[0237] An alternate procedure with easier purification methods and higher<br>
yields is described by Bellassoued and Majidi (J. Org. Chem. 1993, 58,2517-2522),<br>
illustrated in Scheme 2. Treatment of an aldehyde with reagent 7 in the presence of<br>
0.1 equiv. ZnBr gave the vinylogous aldehydes (acrylaldehydes), in yields ranging<br>
from 65% to 95%. Reagent 7 is commercially available.<br>
 In certain embodiments, new analogues were prepared using a two-<br>
step synthetic method beginning with aryl aldehydes (R-CHO, Scheme 2).<br>
Vinylogation of the aryl aldehydes was achieved via treatment with a,cc-<br>
bis(trimethylsilyl)-/-butylacetaldimine (7) in the presence of ZnBr2, as described in<br>
the literature (Bellassoued, M.; Majidi, A. J. Org. Chem. 1993, 58, 2517), to afford<br>
the 3-arylacrylaldehydes R-CH=CH-CHO. The 3-arylacrylaldehydes were<br>
converted to the final products via treatment with diethoxyphosphorylacetaldehyde<br>
tosylhydrazone (8), as described in the literature (Almirante, N.; Cerri, A.; Fedrizzi,<br>
G.; Marazzi, G.; Santagostino, M. Tetrahedron Lett. 1998, 39, 3287).<br>
[0239] It will be appreciated that the two-step reaction sequence illustrated<br>
in Scheme 2 is general in nature, and one skilled in the art will recognize that the<br>
method could be used to prepare analogues in which R represents virtually any type<br>
of aryl, alkyl, heteroaryl, or heterocyclic functional group. The following represent<br>
non-limiting examples of the synthetic method, and are illustrated in Figure 1 below.<br>
[0240] Example 1. 3-(2,3-methylenedioxyphenyl)acrylaIdehyde. To a<br>
solution of 2,3-methylenedioxybenzaldehyde (150 mg) in 5 mL THF was added 22<br>
mg of ZnBr2. With stirring, 250 mg of a,a-bis(trimethylsilyl)-/-butylacetaldimine<br>
(7) was added, and stirring was continued overnight. The solution was cooled to 10<br>
°C, then hydrolyzed by the addition of a solution of ZnCI2 (22 mg) in diethyl<br>
ether/water (5 mL each), followed by stirring at room temperature for 1 h. The<br>
solids were removed by filtration through Celite and the filtrate extracted with<br>
diethyl ether (2X). The combined ether extracts were washed with water and brine,<br>
dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated to provide the title<br>
compound as a brown oil (150 mg): 1H NMR (CDC13) S 6.09 (s, 2 H), 6.14 (s, 1 H),<br>

mg) in 6 mL of THF was added 92 mg of 60% NaH in portions, and the solution<br>
was stirred for 15 min. The solution was cooled to 0 °C, and then a solution of the<br>
product from Example 1 in THF was added dropwise. The reaction was then stirred<br>
at room temperature for 1 h, then at reflux for 1 h. The reaction mixture was<br>
partitioned between 5% NaH2PO4 and ethyl acetate. The organic layer was<br>
separated, washed with water and brine, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and<br>
concentrated to provide the crude title product as a yellow oil. Purification via semi-<br>
preparative HPLC afforded a pure sample as a yellow solid: 1H NMR (CDCl3) d<br>

To a solution of 2-chloro-5-trifluoromethylbenzaldehyde (300 mg) in 5 mL THF<br>
was added 40 mg of ZnBr2. With stirring, 360 mg of a,a-bis(trimethylsilyl)-t-<br>
butylacetaldimine (7) was added, and stirring was continued overnight. The solution<br>
was cooled to 10 °C, then hydrolyzed by the addition of a solution of ZnCl2 (40 mg)<br>
in diethyl ether/water (3 mL each), followed by stirring at room temperature for 1 h.<br>
The solids were removed by filtration through Celite and the filtrate extracted with<br>
diethyl ether (2X). The combined ether extracts were washed with water and brine,<br>
dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated to provide the title<br>
compound as a light brown oil (220 mg): 1H NMR (CDCl3) d 6.09 (s, 2 H), 6.14 (s,<br>
1 H), 6.86-6.98 (m, 4 H), 7.43 (d, 1 H, J= 9.6 Hz), 9.69 (d, 1 H, J= 4.5 Hz).<br>

pyrazole. To a solution of diethoxyphosphorylacetaldehyde tosylhydrazone (8, 400<br>
mg) in 5 mL of THF was added 92 mg of 60% NaH in portions, and the solution<br>
was stirred for 15 min. The solution was cooled to 0 °C, and then a solution of the<br>
product from Example 3 in THF was added dropwise. The reaction was then stirred<br>
at room temperature for 1 h, then at reflux for 1 h. The reaction mixture was<br>
partitioned between 5% NaH2PO4 and ethyl acetate. The organic layer was<br>
separated, washed with water and brine, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and<br>
concentrated to provide the title product as a yellow solid: lH NMR (CDCl3) d 6.61<br>

[0244] Example 5. 3-(2-trifluoromethylphenyl)acrylaldehyde. To a<br>
solution of 2-trifluoromethylbenzaldehyde (260 mg) in 5 mL THF was added 200<br>
mg of ZnBr2. With stirring, 400 mg of a,a-bis(trimethylsilyl)-t-<br><br>
butylacetaldimine<br>
(7) was added, and stirring was continued overnight. The solution was cooled to 10<br>
°C, then hydrolyzed by the addition of a solution of ZnCk (200 mg) in diethyl<br>
ether/water (3 mL each), followed by stirring at room temperature for 1 h. The<br>
solids were removed by filtration through Celite and the filtrate extracted with<br>
diethyl ether (2X). The combined ether extracts were washed with water and brine,<br>
dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated to provide the crude title<br>
compound as an oil. The product was purified via silica gel column chromatography<br>
to afford a white powder (130 mg): 1H NMR (CDCl3) d 6.70 (dd, 1 H, J= 9.6, 4.5<br>
Hz), 7.55 (t, 1 H, J= 4.5 Hz), 7.63 (t, 1 H, J= 4.5 Hz), 7.76 (d, 2 H, J= 4.8 Hz),<br>

[0245] Example 6. 3(5)-[2-(2-trifluoromethylphenyl)vinyl]-lH-pyrazole.<br>
To a solution of diethoxyphosphorylacetaldehyde tosylhydrazone (8, 250 mg) in 5<br>
mL of THF was added 60 mg of 60% NaH in portions, and the solution was stirred<br>
for 15 min. The solution was cooled to 0 °C, and then a solution of the product from<br>
Example 5 (150 mg) in THF was added dropwise. The reaction was then stirred at<br>
room temperature for 1 h, then at reflux for 1 h. The reaction mixture was<br>
partitioned between 5% NaH2PO4 and ethyl acetate. The organic layer was<br>
separated, washed with water and brine, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and<br>

[0246] Example 7. 3(5)-[2-(2-thienyl)vinyl]-1H-pyrazole. To a solution<br>
of diethoxyphosphorylacetaldehyde tosylhydrazone (4, 75 g) in 400 mL of THF was<br>
added 11.6 g of 60% NaH in portions, and the solution was stirred for 15 min. The<br>
solution was cooled to 0 °C, and then a solution of 3-(2-thienyl)acrylaldehyde<br>
(prepared from 2-thienaldehyde and acetaldehyde as described in Heskin, H., Miller,<br>
R. E.; Nord, F. F. J. Org. Chem. 1951, 16, 199) in 100 mL THF was added<br>
dropwise. The reaction was then stirred at room temperature for 1 h, then at reflux<br>
for 1 h. The reaction mixture was partitioned between 5% NaH2PO4 and ethyl<br>
acetate. The organic layer was separated, washed with water and brine, dried over<br>
magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated to provide the crude title product as a<br>
brown oil. Purification via silica gel column chromatography afforded 8.3 g of a<br>
yellow powder. Trituration with dichloromethane/hexane afforded 4.4 g of yellow<br>
powder having &gt;98% purity: 1H NMR (CDC13) d 6.47 (d, 1 H, J= 1.5 Hz), 6.93 (d,<br>
1 H, J= 9.9 Hz), 6.99 (dd, 1 H, J= 3.9,2.1 Hz), 7.06 (d, 1 H, J= 2.1 Hz), 7.20 (d, 1<br>

[0247] Scheme 3 shows some exemplary reactants and the corresponding<br>
intermediate and product. Following flash column chromatography, the desired<br>
intermediates were obtained in 60-95% yields. Conversion to the final analogues<br>
using reagent 8 gave compounds falling within the scope of compounds of Formula<br>
II.<br>
[0249] 1.3- and 1.5-Disubstituted pvrazoles (C(3) and C(5)-positional<br>
isomers)<br>
[0250] In certain other embodiments, compounds of general Formula HI of<br>
the invention may be synthesized by any of several methods. In certain<br>
embodiments, in Method A, illustrated below, 3-bromopyrazole (commercially<br>
available) will undergo alkylation or acylation by reaction with an acyl chloride or<br>
alkyl halide in a suitable polar aprotic solvent such as dichloromethane and base<br>
such triethylamine to form the intermediate compound. Coupling reaction with a<br>
boronic acid, using a palladium catalyst, base such as K2CO3 or CSCO3, and<br>
warming in an aprotic solvent such as benzene, toluene, or xylene will provide the<br>
target pyrazoles. Alternatively, 3-bromopyrazole may be coupled with vinyl<br>
compounds in the presence of a catalyst prepared in situ from 2.5% Pd(AcO)2 with<br>
5% mono-sulfonated triphenylphosphine (TPPTS) in an aqueous solvent such as<br>
water and ethanol. (Ref. Genet, J.P., Blart, E.; Savignac, M., Synlett, 1992, 715-<br>
[0251] As discussed above, lH-pyrazole-type compounds such as 3-Bromo-<br>
lH-pyrazole, typically exist as a mixture of tautomers. Therefore, acylation of 3-<br>
Bromo-lH-pyrazole with RC(=O)C1 leads to a mixture of C(3)- and C(5)-positional<br>
isomers, as depicted below:<br>
[0252] Therefore, method A allows the preparation of both C(3)- and C(5)-<br>
positional isomers of compounds of the invention, e.g.:<br>
[0253] For example, using Method A, above, for the preparation of a related<br>
compound (4-chlorophenyl)[3-(2-(2-thienyl)vinyl)-lH-pyrazol-l-yl]methanone<br>
described in US Patent 6,610,726, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety,<br>
one may react 3-bromopyrazole with 4-chlorobenzoyl chloride (commercially<br>
available, for example, from Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wisconsin) to<br>
provide the first intermediate in Method A. Then reaction of this material with<br>
epsilon-2-(thienylethenyl)boronic acid (commercially available, for example, from<br>
Combi-Blocks Inc., San Diego, California) forms the desired product. Compounds<br>
corresponding to those described in Formulae IIIDl, IIId2 and IIId3 herein may be<br>
likewise prepared from the corresponding benzoyl chlorides as well as many<br>
different types of boronic acid analogs that are commercially available or readily<br>
synthesized.<br>
[0254] For example, the following procedure may be used to prepare 1,3-<br>
(and 1,5-) disubstituted pyrazole compounds of general Formula (III).<br>
[0255] Example 8. 3(5)-[2-(phenyl)vinyl]-l-(4-chlorobenzoyl)-lH-<br>
pyrazole. To a solution of the product from Example 7 (3.2 g) in 60 mL<br>
dichloromethane was added 5.7 g Na2CO3 powder, and the solution was then cooled<br>
to 0 °C. 4-Chlorobenzoyl chloride (3.2 g) was added dropwise, the ice bath was<br>
removed, and the reaction was allowed to stir at room temperature overnight. The<br>
solids were removed by filtration, the filter pad was rinsed with dichloromethane,<br>
and the combined filtrates were concentration to a small volume. Hexane was added<br>
to the concentrated solution, resulting in precipitation of the desired product as a<br>
yellow powder, which was collected via vacuum filtration, rinsed with hexane, and<br>
air dried (4.7 g): lH NMR (CDC13) d 6.72 (d, 1 H, J= 1.8 Hz), 6.97 (d, 1 H, J= 9.9<br>
Hz), 7.03 (dd, 1H,J= 3.0, 2.1 Hz), 7.14 (d, 1 H, J= 2.1 Hz), 7.27 (d, 1 H, J= 2.1<br>
Hz), 7.33 (d, 1 H, J= 9.9 Hz), 7.49 - 7.52 (m, 3 H), 8.08 (dt, 1H,J= 5.4, 1.5 Hz),<br>
8.17 (dt, 2 H, 7= 5.4,1.5 Hz), 8.39 (dd, 1 H, J= 1.5, 0.6 Hz).<br>
[0256] In Method B, depicted below, cinnamaldehydes undergo reaction<br>
with hydrazides to form hydrazone intermediates. The dianion of the corresponding<br>
hydrazones undergo reaction with esters, amides, acid anhydrides, acid chlorides and<br>
alkyl carbonates to form target pyrazoles. (ref. Tetrahedron Lett. 1983, 24(31),<br>
3239-3242).<br>
[0258] The foregoing are merely exemplary of synthetic routes to the<br>
compound of the invention. The foregoing compounds, compositions and methods<br>
of the invention are illustrated by the following examples, which are merely<br>
exemplary of aspects of the invention and are not limiting.<br>
[0259] 2) Biological Activity:<br>
[0260] 1. Assessment of HGF/SF-like activity: The following assay was<br>
performed to assess the HGF/SF-like activity of the compounds of the invention.<br>
Endothelial cells (HUVECs) were seeded in 48 well plates at a density of 10,000 to<br>
20,000 cells per well in the normal growth medium (EGM-2- Clonetics) containing<br>
2% fetal bovine serum, FGF, VEGF, IGF, ascorbic acid, EGF, GA, heparin and<br>
hydrocortisone. The cells were grown normally in the growth medium for 24 hr at<br>
37° C and 5% CO2. The cells were then rinsed with RPMI-1% BSA and starved for<br>
1-2 hrs. The stock solutions of the compounds of the invention were made at a<br>
concentration of 10 mg/ml in DMSO and diluted in RPMI-1% BSA at a final<br>
concentrations of 0.01 micromolar to 25 micromolar. The cells were then washed<br>
and treated with the compounds and incubated for another 24 hr at 37°C. Then 3H<br>
thymidine (0.5 microgram/ml in RPMI-BSA) was added to the cells and incubated<br>
at 37° C for 4 to 5 hours. The unincorporated thymidine was removed by washing<br>
the cells four times with lx PBS. Then the cells were lysed with 0.5M NaOH for 30<br>
min and the radioactivity counted in the beta counter. A similar proliferation assay<br>
using monkey bronchial epithelial cells (4MBR-5) was also employed.<br>
[0261] The following compounds demonstrated activity in the<br>
[0262] 2. Antifibrotic Activity of HGF and compounds of the invention in<br>
vitro and in vivo. The antifibrotic effects of HGF and compounds of the invention in<br>
the immortalized human hepatic stellate cell line LX2 are determined. Serum<br>
starved LX2 cells are treated for 24 hours with HGF at 100 ng/ml and compounds of<br>
the invention at doses ranging from 12 to 24 ug/ml. RNA is then isolated and real<br>
time PCR was performed to evaluate changes in collagen I mRNA. Results indicate<br>
a 90% and 70% decrease in collagen I mRNA expression in cells treated with instant<br>
compounds and HGF, respectively. Additional experiments to determine the effects<br>
of HGF and compounds on TGFb-1, bPDGF-R and MMP-1 mRNA are also<br>
performed to more completely characterize activities of these compounds which can<br>
contribute to their antifibrotic effects.<br>
[0263] Evaluation of the antifibrotic effects of small-molecule HGF agonists<br>
in two distinct rat models of liver fibrosis. A rat model of thioacetamide (TAA)-<br>
induced liver fibrosis and the rat bile duct ligation model of fibrosis showed<br>
improvements by the compounds of the invention. In the TAA model, rats were<br>
treated with TAA (200 mg/kg) three times a week for 6 weeks, at which point they<br>
were sacrificed. In the bild duct ligation model, rats were subjected to bile duct<br>
ligation for 4 weeks and sacrificed. In both models, test compound was injected, i.p.<br>
daily, for the entire duration of fibrosis induction. A panel of functional and<br>
histological tests were conducted: gross morphology, mass, portal pressure,<br>
presence of ascites, enzymes (AST, ALT), collagen content, interstitial fibrosis and<br>
alpha-smooth muscle actin and MMP-2.<br>
[0264] 3. HGF/SF Agonists activate HGF signaling pathways.<br>
Phosphorylation of c-met. Since the biological activity of HGF is mediated through<br>
phosphorylation of its receptor, c-met, the ability of compounds of the invention to<br>
phosphorylate c-met was tested. HUVECs and MDCK cells are incubated with<br>
either HGF (80 ng) or instant compounds (12 mM or 25 raM) for 15 min. without<br>
wishing to be bound to any particular theory, we propose that certain compounds of<br>
the invention induce phosporylation of c-met in a concentration-dependent fashion<br>
in both HUVECs and MDCK cells, showing that the compounds activate HGF/c-<br>
met intracellular signaling pathways and subsequent biologic activity similar to<br>
HGF. In addition, the same pattern of c-met phosphorylation was demonstrated for<br>
the above compounds in melanocytes.<br>
[0265] Intracellular signaling induced by instant compounds and HGF. To<br>
determine whether compound-mediated c-met phosphorylation induces the same<br>
intracellular signaling cascades as HGF, we stimulated endothelial cells with the<br>
instant compounds, and assayed extracellular receptor kinase (ERK)<br>
phosphorylation. Briefly, cell lysates are immunoprecipitated with anti-ERK<br>
antibodies, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes.<br>
Western blot analyses are then performed by probing for total ERK using antibodies<br>
that do not distinguish between the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms;<br>
the membranes were then stripped and re-probed with antibodies that recognize only<br>
phosphorylated ERK. Unstimulated cells contain little phosphorylated ERK. Under<br>
identical cell culture conditions, however, instant compounds significantly increase<br>
the intracellular levels of phosphorylated ERK, while total ERK remains unaffected.<br>
These results are similar to phosphorylated ERK levels observed in the presence of<br>
HGF. Further evidence that compound-induced intracellular signaling events<br>
convey biologic activity was obtained in experiments with the phosphoinositide 3-<br>
kinase inhibitor wortmannin and an Akt inhibitor. Both wortmannin and Akt<br>
inhibitor prevent compound- and HGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation,<br>
showing that both compound and HGF exert biological effects through the same<br>
intracellular signaling pathways.<br>
[0266] 4. Protection against Adriamycin-induced apoptosis. To provide<br>
further evidence that compounds of the invention activate HGF signaling pathways<br>
via c-met to exert bioactivity, we transfected NIH-3T3 cells which do not express c-<br>
met with the gene for the c-met receptor and measured the ability of both HGF and<br>
instant compounds to protect against adriamycin-induced apoptosis. NIH3T3 cells<br>
were pre-treated with HGF (50 ng/ml) or compound (12 mg/ml) for 48 hr. Cells<br>
were then exposed to adriamycin (ADR) (15 raM) for 2 hr, and post-incubated for<br>
48 hr before performing the MTT assay. Transfection of the NIH-3T3 cells<br>
conferred the ability for both HGF and instant compounds to protect the cells from<br>
adriamycin-induced apoptosis. There was no protection from apoptosis by either<br>
compound in non-transfected cells lacking the c-met receptor. This experiment<br>
demonstrates the requirement of the c-met receptor for the cyto-protective actions of<br>
both HGF and compounds of the invention.<br>
[0267] 5. Stimulation of nitric oxide production. HGF and compounds of the<br>
invention may exert their anti-apoptotic effects in part through stimulation of nitric<br>
oxide production. We incubated HUVECs with either HGF or instant compounds<br>
and measured NO production using the nitric oxide-sensitive fluorescence indicator<br>
DAF 2-DA. The results indicate that both HGF and compounds of the invention<br>
stimulate nitric oxide production. Without wishing to be bound to any particular<br>
theory, we propose that the anti-apoptotic activities of both HGF and compounds of<br>
the invention may be mediated by nitric oxide production.<br>
[0268] 6. Aortic ring assay. Thoracic aortas from 100 gm Sprague Dawley<br>
rats are isolated under sterile conditions and cut into rings of approximately 0.8 to<br>
1.0 mm in length. The rings are embedded in Matrigel in the bottom of 48 well<br>
culture plates and instant compound (25 mM) or HGF (100 ng/ml, as positive<br>
control) was added in 200 ml of serum-free tissue culture medium (Human<br>
endothelial-SFM basal growth medium plus 1% bovine serum albumin). An<br>
inventive compound or HGF was replenished on day 4; on day 5, the rings were<br>
photographed and examined for outgrowths. The inventive compound and HGF<br>
stimulated equivalent endothelial cell outgrowth from isolated aortic rings. Without<br>
wishing to be bound to any particular theory, we propose that inventive compounds<br>
are capable of activating proliferation of cells required for angiogenesis.<br>
[0269] 7. Renal cell scatter.The instant compounds are further tested for<br>
HGF activity in a standard scatter assay, which is specific for HGF. In these studies,<br>
compound scattered MDCK cells in a manner similar to HGF. This study is the first<br>
demonstration of the ability to scatter MDCK cells by a non-peptide compound.<br>
The ability to scatter cultured MDCK cells is highly specific for HGF, since many<br>
hormones and growth and attachment factors (including insulin, transferrin, PDGF,<br>
bFGF, VEGF, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, epidermal growth factor and<br>
fibronectin) do not exhibit this activity. Without wishing to be bound by any<br>
particular theory, this result supports the hypothesis that the actions of the<br>
compounds of the invention are mediated through stimulation of the c-met receptor.<br>
[0270] 8. HGF and Compounds of the Invention have significant anti-<br>
apoptotic activity in cultured cell lines. Using the MTT cell viability assay we tested<br>
the ability of compounds of the invention to protect cells from adriamycin-induced<br>
apoptosis. Like HGF, the compounds significantly blocked adriamycin-induced<br>
apoptosis in MDCK cells. Adriamycin alone decreased cell viability to 56% of<br>
untreated cells. Pretreatment with either HGF or compound significantly improved<br>
the cell viability of both cell lines tested (94% and 90% respectively). Compound or<br>
HGF alone had no effect on cell viability.<br>
[0271] 9. Compound-mediated Therapeutic Angiogenesis. Compounds of<br>
the invention induce angiogenesis in vivo, providing clear evidence that compounds<br>
can mediate HGF-like biologic activity by inducing c-met phosphorylation and<br>
activating specific intracellular signaling cascades. To test whether this activity can<br>
be used to therapeutic advantage, the ability of compounds to induce blood vessel<br>
growth was tested in vivo. In this assay compounds or vehicle (control, RPMI<br>
media + 1% BSA) was mixed with Matrigel, a matrix of reconstituted basement<br>
membrane. Samples were injected subcutaneously into mice. After 10 days, mice<br>
were sacrificed for histologic and morphometric analysis of Matrigel plugs. Plugs<br>
containing compound show a greater density of cells. These results are similar to<br>
above studies that demonstrated that HGF dose-dependently increases the vessel<br>
area in this in vivo assay.<br>
[0272] 10. Therapeutic angiogenesis by compound in a mouse hindlimb<br>
ischemia model. Peripheral ischemia was induced in the left hindlimb of normal<br>
C57BL/6 mice via excision of the femoral artery. Following anesthesia with<br>
ketamine (100mg/kg)/xylazine (5mg/kg), an incision was made in the middle portion<br>
of the left hindlimb and the femoral artery dissected out up to the saphenous artery.<br>
The proximal and distal segments were ligated and the artery and all of its side<br>
branches excised. Laser Doppler scanning was performed before and after the<br>
surgery to document decreased blood flow to the affected hindlimb. A compound of<br>
the invention (25 mg in a volume of 0.5 ml in RPMI medium with 1% BSA) is<br>
injected i.p. daily. Control mice were injected with the vehicle solution. Mice were<br>
anesthetized and scanned with the Laser Doppler Imaging system on day 7 prior to<br>
sacrifice of the animals for histological analysis of the hindlimb muscles to<br>
quantitate angiogenesis.<br>
[0273] A Laser Doppler Imaging System (Moor Instruments, Inc.) was used<br>
to measure recovery of blood flow after ischemia. Low power laser light is directed<br>
across the tissue surface in a raster pattern to construct a 2 dimensional image.<br>
Moving blood cells shift the frequency of incident light according to the Doppler<br>
principle. The back-scattered light at the detectors causes constructive and<br>
destructive mixing of shifted light from moving blood and non-shifted light from<br>
static tissue. Intensity fluctuations are processed to give parameters of flux, which is<br>
proportional to tissue blood flow. Flux values of the areas of interest in the hindlimb<br>
are then compared between the left, ischemic hindlimb and the right, non-ischemic<br>
hindlimb and expressed as a fraction (ischemic/non-ischemic), with a value of 1<br>
representing normal flow. Doppler images demonstrated increased flux in mice one<br>
week after compound injection compared to vehicle injection. Mice treated with<br>
compound showed greater recovery than vehicle-injected mice. This level of<br>
recovery was similar to that observed after injection of a naked DNA plasmid (ASF)<br>
containing the gene for HGF. This improved flux was associated with an increased<br>
number of hindlimb muscle capillaries in the ischemic limb. These data demonstrate<br>
that compound significantly improves blood flow and increases the number of<br>
capillaries in the ischemic hindlimbs of mice treated.<br>
[0274] 11. Compounds of the invention prevent increased creatinine by renal<br>
ischemia. Male C57BL/6 mice are anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and the left<br>
renal vessels are occluded with a clamp for 30 minutes. Following release of the<br>
occlusion, the right kidney is removed and the mouse sutured closed. Mice are<br>
injected daily with either a compound of the invention (25 mg) or vehicle (RPMI<br>
1640 + 1% BSA) and blood creatinine levels were analyzed over a period of 1 week<br>
to assess the extent of renal damage in response to ischemia. Treatment with a<br>
compound of the invention prevented the initial large increase in serum creatinine<br>
(Scr), which was observed in vehicle treated mice on day one.<br>
[0275] 12. Protection against ureteral obstruction. Male C57BL/6 mice (20-<br>
30g) were anesthetized with ketamine (100mg/kg, i.p.) and xylazine (5mg/kg, i.p),<br>
and placed on a homeothermic table to maintain body temperature. The abdomen<br>
was opened with a midline incision, and complete ureteral obstruction was<br>
performed by double-ligating the left ureter using 4-0 silk. Vehicle and compound<br>
treated (1mg/kg, i.p.) animals were divided into 3 groups. The first group received<br>
treatment at the time of surgery and daily thereafter until time of sacrifice (day 14 in<br>
all groups); the second group was treated 4 days post occlusion and daily thereafter<br>
until day 14; the third group was treated 7 days post occlusion and daily thereafter<br>
until day 14. Serum creatinine, BUN and urine protein levels, measured at 14 days<br>
postobstruction were used to determine the ability of the compounds to restore<br>
function to injured kidneys.<br>
[0276] 13. Protection from Renal damage by Compounds of the Invention.<br>
Compounds of the invention decrease the incidence of tubular necrosis in the<br>
mercuric chloride model of kidney failure. In a small pilot study mice were injected<br>
with a high dose of HgCl2 (7 mg/kg, s.c.) on day 0 and injected daily with either a<br>
compound of the invention or vehicle as described above. Mice were sacrificed on<br>
day 4, blood was analyzed for creatinine and the kidneys were examined in a blinded<br>
fashion for renal damage. Serum creatinine was higher in vehicle treated mice than<br>
in compound-treated mice.<br>
[0277] 14. Effect of compounds of the invention on Bleomycin-induced<br>
apoptosis of bronchial epithelial cells. Compounds of the invention were shown to<br>
inhibit bleomycin-induced apoptosis of bronchial epithelial cells, a well-established<br>
mouse model of lung injury. Male C57BL/6 mice (20-30g, n=10/group) were treated<br>
with bleomycin (0.06U/20 gram body weight) or saline via intratracheal<br>
administration. Bleomycin-treated mice were divided into 2 groups. Compounds of<br>
the invention (1mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle was administered daily until sacrifice on day<br>
12. Right lung samples from the mice were then harvested for analysis. Tissues were<br>
sectioned and stained with modified Masson's Trichrome and analyzed for<br>
interstitial fibrosis. The Ashcroft scale was used to obtain a numerical fibrotic score<br>
with each specimen being scored independently by two histopathologists, and the<br>
mean of their individual scores considered as the fibrotic score.<br>
[0278] 15. Assessment of HGF/SF-antagonist activity: To evaluate inhibitors<br>
of HGF/SF activity, compounds may be evaluated directly for anti-proliferative<br>
activities, such as the inhibition of cellular proliferation, inhibition of tumor growth,<br>
inhibition of scatter, and inhibition of gene expression, in any of the appropriate<br>
aforementioned assays. For example, in a cell proliferation assay, Endothelial cells<br>
(HUVECs) were seeded in 48 well plates at a density of 10,000 to 20,000 cells per<br>
well in the normal growth medium (EGM-2-Clonetics) containing 2% fetal bovine<br>
serum, FGF, VEGF, IGF, ascorbic acid, EGF, GA, heparin and hydrocortisone. The<br>
cells were grown normally in the growth medium for 24 hr at 37 degrees C and 5%<br>
CO.sub.2. The cells were then rinsed with RPMI-1% BSA and starved for 1-2 hrs.<br>
The stock solutions of all the compounds were made at a concentration of 10 mg/ml<br>
in DMSO and diluted in RPMI-1% BSA at a final concentrations of 1 to 12<br>
microgram/ml. The cells were then washed and treated with the compounds and<br>
incubated for another 24 hr at 37 degrees C. Then .sup.3 H thymidine (0.5<br>
microgram/ml in RPMI-BSA) was added to the cells and incubated at 37 degrees C.<br>
for 4 to 5 hours. The unincorporated thymidine was removed by washing the cells<br>
four times with PBS. Then the cells were lysed with 0.5M NaOH for 30 min and the<br>
radioactivity counted in the beta counter.<br>
{0279] In other experiments, human iliac artery endothelial cells were used<br>
under similar conditions as those described above.<br>
[0280] 16. Effect on growth of tumor cells. The activity of the compounds<br>
herein to promote or inhibit the growth of tumor cells was evaluated using human<br>
endometrial cancer cells.<br>
