				<td>SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR SELECTING A SERVING BASE STATION<br>
ACCORDING TO A DROP OF A MOBILE SUBSCRIBER STATION IN A<br>
BROADBAND WIRELESS ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a broadband wireless aceess<br>
communication system, and more particularly to an apparatus and a method for<br>
selecting a serving base station according to a drop of a mobile subscriber station<br>
during a communication.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
Recently, extensive studies and research have been being carried out for<br>
the 4th generation ("4G") communication systems in order to provide subscribers<br>
with services having a superior quality of service ("QoS") at higher transmission<br>
speeds. In particular, studies are being actively carried out in relation to the 4G<br>
communication systems in order to provide high speed services having a superior<br>
QoS through broadband wireless access communication systems, such as wireless<br>
local area network ("LAN") communication systems and wireless metropolitan<br>
area network ("MAN") communication systems. while ensuring the mobility of<br>
the broadband wireless access communication systems.<br>
The wireless MAN communication system has a wide service coverage<br>
area and provides data at a higher transmission speed than a LAN system, and as<br>
such the wireless MAN communication system is adaptable for a high-speed<br>
communication service. However, the wireless MAN communication system does<br>
not take into consideration the mobility of a user, that is, subscriber station ("SS").<br>
so a handover, which is required when the SS moves at a high speed, is not taken<br>
into consideration in the wireless MAN communication system. The wireless<br>
MAN communication system is one type of broadband wireless access<br>
communication system and has a wider service coverage area and higher<br>
transmission speed as compared with those of a wireless LAN communication<br>
system.<br>
In order to provide a broadband transport network for a physical channel<br>
of the wireless MAN communication system, an IEEE (Institute of Electrical and<br>
Electronics Engineers) 802.16a communication system utilizing an orthogonal<br>
frequency division multiplexing ("OFDM") scheme and an orthogonal frequency<br>
division multiple access ("OFDMA") scheme has been suggested.<br>
As the IEEE 802.16a communication system applies the OFDM/OFDMA schemes<br>
to the wireless MAN system, the physical channel signals can be transmitted<br>
through a plurality of sub-carriers so that a high-speed data transmission is<br>
possible. In short, the IEEE 802.16a communication system is a broadband<br>
wireless access communication system using the OFDM/OFDMA schemes.<br>
EP 0325713 discloses an improved cellular telephone communication system is<br>
described having operational steps which prevent a call from being dropped due<br>
to a radiotelephone (130) not receiving a handoff instruction from its host base<br>
site (115). The system includes a switch controller (122) for determining that the<br>
radiotelephone requires a handoff from a first base site coverage area (110) to a<br>
second base site coverage area (112) and for communicating a handoff message<br>
to the associated first (115) and second base site equipment (119). The first<br>
base site equipment then transmits the handoff message to the radiotelephone.<br>
If the radiotelephone does not receive the message, it determines that the call<br>
has been lost, siezes a signalling channel from the second base site, and<br>
requests, via the second base site a call reconnection by transmitting a special<br>
message. The second base site then informs the radiotelephone of the handoff<br>
instruction and the handoff is completed with a successful reconnection of the<br>
call.<br>
Hereinafter, a structure of a conventional IEEE 802.16a communication system<br>
will be described with reference to Figure 1.<br>
Figure 1 is a structure diagram schematically illustrating the conventional IEEE<br>
802.16a communication system.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, the IEEE 802.16a communication system has a single cell<br>
structure and includes a base station (BS) 100 and a plurality of SSs 110, 120<br>
and 130 managed by the base station 100. The base station 100 conducts<br>
communications with the SSs 110, 120 and 130 using the OFDM/OFDMA<br>
schemes.<br>
Hereinafter, a structure of a downlink frame of the IEEE 802.16a communication<br>
system will be described with reference to Figure 2.<br>
Figure 2 is a structure diagram schematically illustrating the structure of the<br>
downlink frame of the IEEE 802.16a communication system.<br>
Referring to Figure 2, the downlink frame includes a preamble fields 200, a<br>
broadcast control field 210, and a plurality of time division multiplex ("TDM")<br>
fields 220 and 230. A synchronous signal, that is, a preamble sequence for<br>
synchronizing the SSs with the base stations, is transmitted through the<br>
preamble field 200. The broadcast control field 210 includes a DL<br>
(downlink)_MAP field 211 and a UL (uplink)_MAP field 213. The DL_MAP field<br>
211 is a field for transmitting a DL_MAP message. Information elements ("IEs")<br>
included in the DL_MAP message are represented in Table 1.<br>
As shown in Table 1. the DL. MAP message includes a plurality of IEs,<br>
such as Management Message Type representing a message type to be transmitted,<br>
PHY (physical) Synchronization Field corresponding to modulation demodulation<br>
schemes applied to a physical channel for achieving synchronization. DCD Count<br>
representing a count according to the variation of a configuration of a downlink<br>
channel descript ("DCD") message including a downlink burst profile, Base<br>
Station II), and Number of DI. MAP Elements n representing the number of<br>
elements remaining after the Base Station ID. Although it is not shown in Table 1,<br>
the DL MAP message also includes information related to the ranging codes<br>
assigned to each ranging, which will be described later.<br>
In addition, the UI. MAP field 213 is a field for transmitting a UL MAP<br>
message. IEs included in the UL. MAP message are represented in Table 2.<br>
As shown in Table 2, the 2.the UL_MAP message includes a plurality of IEs.<br>
such as Management Message Type representing a message type to be transmitted.<br>
Uplink Channel II) representing an available uplink channel ID. UCD Count<br>
representing a count according to the variation of a configuration of an uplink<br>
channel descript ("UCD") message including an uplink burst profile, and Number<br>
of UL_MAP Elements n representing the number of elements remaining after the<br>
UCD count. The Uplink Channel ID is allocated only to a medium access control<br>
("MAC") sub-layer. The TDM field s 220 and 230 are field s corresponding to<br>
time slots which are allocated according to the TDM. TDM A (time division<br>
multiple access) schemes corresponding to the SSs. The base station transmits<br>
broadcast information to the SSs, which are managed by the base station, through<br>
the DL MAP field 211 of the downlink frame by using a predetermined center<br>
carrier. As the SSs are powered on, the SSs monitor all frequency bands, which<br>
arc preset in the SSs, in order to detect a reference channel signal, such as a pilot<br>
channel signal having the highest carrier to interference and noise ratio ("CINR").<br>
An SS selects a base station, which has transmitted to the SS the pilot<br>
signal having the highest CINR, as a base station for the SS. The SS can then<br>
recognize information controlling the uplink and the downlink of the SS and<br>
information representing a real data transmission reception position by checking<br>
the DL MAP field 211 and the UL_MAP field 213 of the downlink frame<br>
transmitted from the base station.<br>
A configuration of the UCD message is represented in Table 3.<br>
Table 3<br>
As shown in Table 3. the UCD message includes a plurality of IEs. such as<br>
Management Message Type representing a message type to be transmitted,<br>
Uplink channel ID representing an available uplink channel ID. Configuration<br>
Change Count counted in the base station, mini-time slot size representing a size<br>
of a mini-lime slot of an uplink physical channel, Ranging Backoff start<br>
representing a start point of backoff using an initial ranging, that is, representing a<br>
size of an initial backoff window using the initial ranging. Ranging Backoff End<br>
representing an end point of backoff using an initial ranging, that is, representing<br>
a size of a final backoff window, Request Backoff start representing a start point<br>
of backoff for contention data and requests, that is, representing a size of an initial<br>
backoff window, and Request Backoff End representing an end point of backoff<br>
for contention data and requests, that is. representing a size of a final backoff<br>
window. A backoff value is a waiting time required for the next ranging if the<br>
present ranging fails. If the SS fails to perform the ranging, the base station must<br>
transmit the backoff value, i.e. the waiting lime for the next ranging, to the SS.<br>
For instance, if the backoff value is determined as "10" based on the ranging<br>
backoff start and the ranging backoff end. the SS must perform the next ranging<br>
after by passing 210 ranging chances (1024 ranging chances) according to a<br>
truncated binary exponential backoff algorithm.<br>
A structure of an uplink frame of the IEEE 802.16a communication<br>
system will be described with reference to FIG. 3.<br>
FIG. 3 is a structure diagram schematically illustrating the structure of the<br>
uplink frame of the IEEE 802.16a communication system.<br>
Prior to explaining FIG. 3, a description will be made in relation to<br>
rangings. such as an initial ranging, a maintenance ranging, that is, a periodic<br>
ranging, and a bandwidth request ranging, used for the IEEE 802.16a<br>
communication system.<br>
First, the initial ranging will be described. The initial ranging is carried out<br>
in order to synchronize the base station with the SS, in which a time offset and a<br>
transmit power between the SS and the base station are precisely adjusted. That is,<br>
alter the SS has been powered on, the SS receives the DL MAP message and the<br>
Ul._MAP 'UCD message in order to synchronize with the base station. Then, the<br>
initial ranging is carried out with respect to the SS in order to adjust the lime<br>
offset and the transmit power of the SS in relation to the base station. Herein,<br>
since the IEEE 802.16a communication system uses the OFDM/OFDMA<br>
schemes, ranging sub-channels and ranging codes are required for the initial<br>
ranging. Thus, the base station assigns available ranging codes to the SS<br>
according to the object or the type of rangings.<br>
In detail, the ranging codes are created by segmenting a pseudo-random<br>
noise (""PN") sequence having a predetermined bit length into predetermined<br>
ranging code units. In general, two ranging sub-channels, having a 53-bit length,<br>
forms one ranging channel and a PN code is segmented through a ranging channel<br>
having a 106-bit length, thereby forming the ranging codes. Such ranging codes<br>
are assigned to the SS, for instance, a maximum of 48 ranging codes (RC #1 to<br>
RC #48) can be assigned to the SS. At least two ranging codes are used for the<br>
initial ranging, the periodic ranging and the bandwidth request ranging as default<br>
values with respect to each SS. That is, the ranging codes are differently assigned<br>
according to the initial ranging, the periodic ranging and the bandwidth request<br>
ranging. For instance, N ranging codes are assigned for the initial ranging, M<br>
ranging codes are assigned for the periodic ranging, and L ranging codes are<br>
assigned for the bandwidth request ranging. As mentioned above, the assigned<br>
ranging codes are transmitted to the SS through the UCD message and the SS<br>
performs the initial ranging by using the ranging codes included in the UCD<br>
message in match with objects of the ranging codes.<br>
Second, the periodic ranging will be described. The periodic ranging is<br>
periodically carried out by means of the SS having the time offset and the<br>
transmit power adjusted through the initial ranging, in such a manner that the SS<br>
can adjust the channel status with respect to the base station. The SS performs the<br>
periodic ranging by using ranging codes assigned thereto for the periodic ranging.<br>
Third, the periodic ranging will be described. The bandwidth request<br>
ranging is carried out by means of the SS having the time offset and the transmit<br>
power adjusted through the initial ranging, wherein the SS requests a bandwidth<br>
assignment in order to communicate with the base station.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 3, the uplink frame consists of an initial<br>
maintenance opportunities filed 300 using the initial ranging and the maintenance<br>
ranging, that is, the periodic ranging, a request contention opportunities filed 310<br>
using the bandwidth request ranging, and SS scheduled data fields 320<br>
including uplink data of the SSs. The initial maintenance opportunities filed 300<br>
includes a plurality of access burst intervals including the real initial ranging and<br>
the periodic ranging and a collision interval created because of the collision<br>
between the access burst intervals. The request contention opportunities filed 310<br>
includes a plurality of bandwidth request intervals including the real bandwidth<br>
request ranging and a collision interval created because of the collision between<br>
the bandwidth request intervals. In addition, the SS scheduled data fileds 320<br>
consist of a plurality of SS scheduled data fileds (first SS scheduled data filed to<br>
SS Nth scheduled data filed) and SS transition gaps formed between the SS<br>
scheduled data fileds (first SS scheduled data filed to SS Nth scheduled data filed).<br>
An uplink interval usage code ("UIUC") filed is provided for recoding<br>
information representing the usage of the offset recorded in the offset filed. The<br>
UIUC field is shown in Table 4.<br>
As shown in Table 4. if "2" is recorded in the UIUC filed, the starting<br>
offset used for the initial ranging is recorded in the offset filed. If "3" is recorded<br>
in the UIUC filed, the starting offset used for the bandwidth request ranging or<br>
the maintenance ranging is recorded in the offset filed. As mentioned above, the<br>
offset filed is provided to record starting offset values used for the initial ranging,<br>
the bandwidth request ranging or the maintenance ranging corresponding to<br>
information recorded in the UIUC filed. Information related to the characteristics<br>
of a physical channel transmitted from the UIUC filed is recorded in the UCD.<br>
A ranging process between the base station and the SS in the IEEE<br>
802.16a communication system will be described with reference to FIG. 4.<br>
FIG. 4 is a signal flow diagram illustrating the ranging process between<br>
the base station and the SS in the IEEE 802.16a communication system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, as an SS 400 is powered on, the SS 400 monitors all<br>
of the frequency bands, which arc preset in the SS 400. in order to detect a pilot<br>
channel signal having the highest CINR. In addition, the SS 400 selects a base<br>
station 420 which has transmitted the pilot signal having the highest CINR to the<br>
SS 400 as a base station for the SS 400, so the SS 400 receives the preamble of<br>
the downlink frame transmitted from the base station 420. thereby obtaining<br>
system synchronization with respect to the base station 420.<br>
As described above, when the system synchronization is attained between<br>
the SS 400 and the base station 420, the base station 420 transmits the DL_MAP<br>
message and the UL_MAP message to the SS 400 (steps 411 and 413). Herein, as<br>
described above with reference to Table 1. the DL_MAP message notifies the SS<br>
400 of the information required for the SS 400 to obtain the system<br>
synchronization with respect to the base station 420 in the downlink and<br>
information about a structure of the physical channel capable of receiving<br>
messages transmitted to the SS 400 from the downlink. In addition, as describe<br>
above with reference to Table 2, the UL_ MAP message notifies the SS 400 of the<br>
information about a scheduling period of the SS 400 in the uplink and the<br>
structure of the physical channel. In addition, the DL_MAP message is<br>
periodically broadcast to all of the SSs from the base station 420. If a<br>
predetermined SS, that is, if the SS 400 can continuously receive the UL MAP<br>
message, it will be represented that the SS 400 is synchronized with the base<br>
station 420. That is, the SS 400 receiving the 1)1. MAP message can receive all of<br>
the messages transmitted to the downlink. In addition, as described above with<br>
reference to Table 3, if the SS 400 fails to access to the base station 420, the base<br>
station 420 transmits the UCD message including the information representing<br>
the available backoff value to the SS 400.<br>
The SS 400. which has been synchronized with the base station 420.<br>
transmits a ranging request ("RNG_REQ") message to the base station 420 (step<br>
415). Upon receiving the RNG REQ message from the SS 400. the base station<br>
420 transmits a ranging response ("RNG RSP") message including information<br>
required for correcting frequency for the ranging, time and transmit power to the<br>
SS 400 (step 417).<br>
A configuration of the RNG_REQ message is represented in Table 5.<br>
Table 5<br>
In Table 5, the "Downlink Channel ID" is a downlink channel identifier<br>
included in the RNG_REQ message received in the SS through the UCD and the<br>
"Pending Until Complete" is a priority of transmitted ranging responses. If the<br>
"Pending Until Complete'" is "0". a previously} transmitted ranging response has a<br>
priority, and if the "Pending Until Complete" is not "0", a presently transmitted<br>
ranging response has a priority.<br>
A configuration of (he RNG RSP message is represented in Table 6.<br>
In Table 6, the "Uplink Channel ID" is an ID of an uplink channel<br>
included in the RNGREQ message. Since the IEEE 802.16a communication<br>
system shown in FIG. 4 relates to a fixed SS, that is. since the IEEE 802.16a<br>
communication system shown in FIG. 4 does not take into consideration the<br>
mobility of the SS, the base station 420 communicating with the SS 400 becomes<br>
a serving base station.<br>
The IEEE 802.16a communication system has the signal cell structure in<br>
which the mobility of the SS is not considered. Meanwhile, an IEEE. 802.16e<br>
communication system is defined as a communication system in which the<br>
mobility of the SS is added to the IEEE 802.16a communication system. Thus, the<br>
IEEE 802.16e communication system must consider the mobility of the SS under<br>
a multi-cell environment. In order to ensure the mobility of the SS under the<br>
multi-cell environment, the operations of the SS and the base station must be<br>
changed. To this end, various studies have been carried out relating to a handover<br>
of the SS in order to provide for the mobility to the SS under the multi-cell<br>
environment.<br>
A structure of a conventional IEEE 802.16e communication system will<br>
be described with reference to FIG. 5.<br>
FIG. 5 is a structure diagram schematically illustrating the structure of the<br>
conventional IEEE 802.16e communication system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, the IEEE 802.16e communication system has a multi-<br>
cell structure consisting of cells 500 and 550 and includes a first base station 510<br>
for managing the cell 500, a second base station 540 for managing the cell 550,<br>
and a plurality of mobile subscriber stations ("MSSs") 511, 513, 530, 551. and<br>
553. The MSS signify an SS having mobility. The base stations 510 and 540<br>
communicate with the MSSs 511, 513, 530, 551. and 553 using the<br>
OFDM OFDMA schemes. From among the MSSs 511, 513, 530, 551, and 553,<br>
the MSS 530 is positioned in a boundarv cell formed between the cell 500 and the<br>
cell 550, that is. the MSS 530 is positioned in a handover region, Thus. the MSS<br>
530 must be provided with a handover function in order to realize the mobility of<br>
the MSS 530.<br>
In the IEEE 802.16e communication svstem, a MSS receives pilot<br>
channel signals transmitted from a plurality of base stations and measures the<br>
CTNR of the pilot channel signals. In addition, the MSS selects a base station,<br>
which has transmitted a pilot signal having a highest CTNR, as a base station of<br>
the MSS. That is. the MSS regards the base station transmitting the pilot signal<br>
having the highest CINR as a serving base station of the MSS. After selecting the<br>
serving base station, the MSS receives the downlink frame and the uplink frame<br>
transmitted from the serving base station. Herein, the downlink frame and the<br>
uplink frame of the IEEE 802.16e communication system have structures<br>
identical to those of the downlink frame and the uplink frame of the IEEE<br>
802.16a communication system described with reference to FIGS. 2 and 3.<br>
The serving base station transmits a mobile neighbor advertisement<br>
("MOB_NBR_ADV") message to the MSS. A configuration of the<br>
MOBNBR_ADV message is represented in Table 7.<br>
As shown in Table 7, the MOB_ NBR_ADV message includes a plurality<br>
of IEs. such as Management Message Type representing a message type to be<br>
transmitted. Configuration Change Count representing the number of<br>
configurations to be changed. N NEIGHBORS representing the number of<br>
neighbor base stations, Neighbor BS-ID representing identifiers of neighbor base<br>
stations, Physical Frequency representing a physical channel frequency of the<br>
neighbor base stations, and TLV (type length variable) Encoded Neighbor<br>
Information representing variable information about the neighbor base stations.<br>
After receiving the MOB_NBR ADV message, the MSS transmits a<br>
mobile scanning interval allocation request ("MOB_SCN_RHQ") message to the<br>
serving base station if it is necessary to scan the CINRs of the pilot channel<br>
signals transmitted from the neighbor base stations. A scan request time of the<br>
MSS for scanning the CINRs of the pilot channel signals transmitted from the<br>
neighbor base stations docs not directly relate to the CINR scanning operation, so<br>
it will not be further described below. A configuration of the MOB SCN REQ<br>
message is represented in Table 8.<br>
As shown in Table 8. the MOB_ SCN_ REQ message includes a plurality<br>
of IEs, such as Management Message Type representing a message type to be<br>
transmitted, and Scan Duration representing a scan interval for scanning the<br>
CINRs of the pilot channel signals transmitted from the neighbor base stations.<br>
The scan duration is formed in a frame unit. In Table 8. the Management Message<br>
Type for the MOB SCNREQ message is not yet defined (Management Message<br>
Type = undefined).<br>
After receiving the MOB SCN REQ message, the serving base station<br>
transmits a mobile scanning interval allocation response ("MOB_ SCN RSP')<br>
message including scan information, which must be scanned by the MSS, to the<br>
MSS. A configuration of the MOB SCN RSP message is represented in Table 9.<br><br>
As shown in Table 9. the MOB_SCN_ RSP message includes a plurality of<br>
IEs, such as Management Message Type representing a message type to be<br>
transmitted. Connection ID ("CID") of the MSS, which has transmitted the<br>
MOBSCNREQ message and Duration. In Table 9. the Management Message<br>
Type for the MOB_SCN_ RSP message is not yet defined (Management Message<br>
Type = undefined). The Duration represents an area in which the MSS scans the<br>
CINR of the pilot channel signal. After receiving the MOB_SCN_ RSP message<br>
including the scanning information, the MSS scans the CINRs of the pilot signals<br>
of the neighbor base stations included in the MOB_ SCN_ RSP message<br>
corresponding to scanning information parameters.<br>
In order to provide the handover function in the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system, the MSS must measure the CINRs of the pilot channel<br>
signals transmitted from the neighbor base stations and the base station of the<br>
MSS, that is. the serving base station. If the CINR of the pilot channel signals<br>
transmitted from the serving base station is less than the CINRs of the pilot<br>
channel signals transmitted from the neighbor base stations, the MSS sends a<br>
signal requesting the handover to the serving base station.<br>
A handover process according to the request of the MSS in the<br>
conventional IEEE 802.16e communication system will be described with<br>
reference to FIG. 6.<br>
FIG. 6 is a signal flow diagram illustrating the handover process<br>
according to the request of the MSS in the conventional IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6. a serving base station 610 transmits an<br>
MOB_NBR_ADV message to an MSS 600 (step 611). Upon receiving the<br>
MOB_ NBR_ ADV message from the serving base station 610, the MSS 600<br>
obtains information related to the neighbor base stations and transmits an<br>
MOB_ SCN_ REQ message to the serving base station 610 if it is necessary to<br>
scan ("scan" and "measure" will be used synonymously with respect to<br>
determining CINRs) the CINRs of pilot channels signals transmitted from the<br>
neighbor base stations (step 613). A scan request time of the MSS 600 for<br>
scanning the CINRs of the pilot channel signals transmitted from the neighbor<br>
base stations does not directly relate to the CINR scanning operation, so it will<br>
not be further described below. The serving base station 610 receiving the<br>
MOB_ SCN _REQ message transmits an MOB_SCN_ RSP message including<br>
scanning information, which must be scanned by the MSS 600, to the MSS 600<br>
(step 615). Upon receiving the MOB_SCN_RSP message including scanning<br>
information from the serving base station 610, the MSS 600 scans parameters<br>
included in the MOB_SCN_RSP message, that is, the MSS 600 scans the CINRs<br>
of the pilot channel signals of the neighbor base stations obtained through the<br>
MOB_ NBR_ADV message (step 617). Although a process for measuring the<br>
CINR signal of the pilot channel signal transmitted from the serving base station<br>
610 is not separately illustrated in FIG. 6. the MSS 600 may continuously<br>
measure the CINR of the pilot channel signal transmitted from the serving base<br>
station 610.<br>
After scanning the CINRs of the pilot channel signals transmitted from<br>
the neighbor base stations, if the MSS 600 decides to change the serving base<br>
station thereof (step 619), that is, if the MSS 600 decides to replace the serving<br>
base station 610 with a new base station having a structure different from the<br>
structure of the serving base station 610, the MSS 600 transmits a mobile MSS<br>
handover request ("MOB_MSSHO_RHQ") message to the serving base station<br>
610. Herein, a base station, which can be selected as the new base station due to<br>
the handover of the MSS 600. is called a "target BS". A configuration of the<br>
MOB_MISSIO_ REQ message is represented in Table 10.<br><br>
As shown in Table 10. the MOBMSSIfO REQ message includes a<br>
plurality of IEs, such as Management Message Type representing a message type<br>
to be transmitted, and a scanning result of the MSS 600. In Table 10,<br>
NRecommended represents the number of neighbor base stations, which have<br>
transmitted pilot channel signals having CINRs greater than a predetermined<br>
CINR. detected through the scanning operation of the MSS 600 for the CINRs of<br>
the pilot channel signals transmitted from the neighbor base station. That is. the<br>
N Recommended represents the number of neighbor base stations capable of<br>
performing the handover for the MSS 600. The MOBMSSIIO REQ message<br>
also includes identifiers of the neighbor base stations represented by the<br>
NRecommended, the CINRs of the pilot signals transmitted from the neighbor<br>
base stations, and a service level expected to be transmitted to the MSS 600.<br>
The serving base station 610 receives the MOBMSSHOREQ message<br>
transmitted from the MSS 600 and detects a list of target base stations allowing<br>
the handover of the MSS 600 based on N Recommended information of the<br>
MOBMSSHOREQ message (step 623). In the following description, the list of<br>
target base stations allowing the handover of the MSS will be referred to as a<br>
"handover-support target base station list" for the purpose of convenience.<br>
According to FIG. 6, a first target base station 620 and a second target base station<br>
630 may exist in the handover-support target base station list. Of course, the<br>
handover-support target base station list may include a plurality of target base<br>
stations. The serving base station 610 transmits a handover notification<br>
("IK) notification") message to the target base stations included in the handover-<br>
support target base station list, such as the first target base station 620 and the<br>
second target base station 630 (steps 625 and 627). A configuration of the<br>
I K) notification message is represented in fable 11.<br>
Table 11<br><br>
As shown in Table 11, the HO notification message includes a plurality of<br>
Il-s. such as an ID of the MSS 600 to be handed-over to the first target base<br>
station 620 or the second target base station 630. an expected handover start time<br>
of the MSS 600, a bandwidth provided from the target base station, that is. a<br>
bandwidth provided from a new serving base station according to a request of the<br>
MSS 600, and a service level provided to the MSS 600. The bandwidth and the<br>
service level requested by the MSS 600 arc identical to the expected service level<br>
information recorded in the MOB MSSHOREQ message described with<br>
reference to I;l(i. 10.<br>
The first and second target base stations 620 and 630 receive the<br>
HO notification message from the serving base station 610 and transmit an<br>
HOnotificalion response message to the serving base station 610 (steps 629 and<br>
631). A configuration of the HO notification response message is represented in<br>
Table 12.<br>
Table 12<br><br><br>
As shown in Table 12, the HO notification response message includes a<br>
plurality of IF-s, such as an ID of the MSS 600 to be handed-over to the target<br>
base stations, ACK/NACK representing a response of the target base stations with<br>
regard to a handover request of the MSS 600, and information related to the<br>
bandwidth and the service level which must be provided from each target base<br>
station when the MSS 600 is handed-ovcr to the target base station.<br>
The serving base station 610 receives the MO notification response<br>
message from the first and second target base stations 620 and 630 and analyzes<br>
the H()_notification response message in order to select a final base station<br>
capable of providing an optical bandwidth and an optical service level to the MSS<br>
600 when the MSS 600 is handed-over to the base station. For instance, if the<br>
service level provided from the first target base station 620 is less than the service<br>
level requested by the MSS 600 and the service level provided from the second<br>
target base station 630 is identical to the sen ice level requested by the MSS 600,<br>
the serving base station 610 selects the second target base station 630 as the final<br>
target base station performing a handover operation in relation to the MSS 600.<br>
Thus, the serving base station 610 transmits an HOnotification conform message<br>
to the second target base station 630 in response to the HOnotification response<br>
message (step 633). A configuration of the HO notification confirm message is<br>
represented in Table 13.<br>
Table 13<br><br>
As shown in fable 13, the HOnotification confirm message includes a<br>
plurality of IHs. such as an ID of the MSS 600 to be handed-over to the selected<br>
target base station, and information about a bandwidth and a service level which<br>
must be provided from the selected target base station when the MSS 600 is<br>
handed-over to the selected target base station.<br>
In addition, the serving base station 610 transmits a mobile handover<br>
response ("MOB_HO_RSP") message to the MSS 600 in response to the<br>
MOB_MSSHO_REQ message (step 635). The MOB_HO__RSP message includes<br>
information about the target base station performing the handover operation in<br>
relation to the MSS 600. A configuration of the MOB HO RSP message is<br>
represented in Table 14.<br>
Table 14<br><br>
As shown in Table 14. the MOB HORSP message includes a plurality of<br>
Uis, such as Management Message Type representing a message type to be<br>
transmitted, an expected handover start time, and target ser\ing stations selected<br>
from the serving base stations. In addition. N Recommended of the<br>
MOB IK) RSP message represents the number of target base stations capable of<br>
providing the bandwidth and service level requested b&gt; the MSS 600 among<br>
target base stations included in the handover-support target base station list. The<br>
MOBHORSP message is marked with the identifiers of the target base stations<br>
represented by the N_Recommcndcd and a service level expected to be provided<br>
to the MSS 600 from the target base station. Although FIG. 6 illustrates that the<br>
information of one target base station, that is, information about the second target<br>
base station 630, is only included in the MOB_HO_ RSP message from among the<br>
target base stations included in the handover-support target base station list, if<br>
there arc a plurality of target base stations capable of providing the bandwidth and<br>
service level requested by the MSS in the handover-support target base station list,<br>
the MOB_HO_ RSP message may include information related to the plurality of<br>
target base stations.<br>
Upon receiving the MOB_HO_ RSP message, the MSS 600 analyzes<br>
information included in the MOB_HO_ RSP message in order to select a target<br>
base station for performing the handover operation in relation to the MSS 600.<br>
After selecting the target base station, the MSS 600 transmits a mobile handover<br>
indication ("MOB_HO_ IND") message to the serving base station 610 in<br>
response to the MOBHO RSP message (step 637). A configuration of the<br>
MOB_HO_IND message is represented in Table 15.<br>
Table 15<br><br>
As shown in Table 15. the MOBHO IND message includes a plurality of<br>
IEs, such as Management Message Type representing a message type to be<br>
transmitted, an identifier of a final target base station selected by the MSS 600,<br>
and TLV Encoded Information representing variable Encoded information.<br>
The serving base station 610 receiving the MOB 110 IND message<br>
recogni/es that the MSS 600 will be handed-over to the target base station, that is,<br>
the second target base station 630 based on the MOB _HO IND message so that<br>
the serving base station 610 releases a link connecting the serving base station<br>
610 to the MSS 600 (step 639). If the link connecting the MSS 600 to the serving<br>
base station 610 has been released, the MSS 600 is handed-over to the second<br>
target base station 630.<br>
The handover process according to the request of the base station in the<br>
conventional IEEE 802.16e communication system will be described with<br>
reference to FIG. 7.<br>
FIG. 7 is a signal flow diagram showing the handover process according<br>
to the request of the base station in the conventional IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system.<br>
It is noted that the handover process according to the request of the base<br>
station may occur when an overload is applied to the base station so that it is<br>
necessary to distribute the load of the base station to neighbor base stations or<br>
when it is necessary to deal with the status variation of the uplink of the MSS.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7. a serving base station 710 transmits an<br>
MOBNBR ADV message to an MSS 700 (step 711). Upon receiving the<br>
MOB_NBR_ADV message from the serving base station 710, the MSS 700<br>
obtains information relating to the neighbor base stations and transmits an<br>
MOBSCN RHQ message to the serving base station 710 if it is necessary to<br>
scan the CINRs of pilot channels signals transmitted from the neighbor base<br>
stations (step 713). A scan request time of the MSS 700 for scanning the CINRs<br>
of the pilot channel signals transmitted from the neighbor base stations does not<br>
directly relate to the CINR scanning operation, so it will not be further described<br>
below. The serving base station 710 receiving the MOB SCN REQ message<br>
transmits an MOB_SCN RSP message including the scanning information,<br>
which must be scanned by the MSS 700, to the MSS 700 (step 715). Upon<br>
receiving the MOB SCN RSP message including the scanning information from<br>
the serving base station 710. the MSS 700 scans the parameters included in the<br>
MOB SCN RSP message, that is, the MSS 700 scans the CINRs of the pilot<br>
channel signals of the neighbor base stations obtained through the<br>
MOBNBR ADV message (step 717). Although a process for measuring the<br>
CINR signal of the pilot channel signal transmitted from the serving base station<br>
710 is not separately illustrated in FIG. 7, the MSS 700 may continuously<br>
measure the CINR of the pilot channel signal transmitted from the serving base<br>
station 710.<br>
When the serving base station 710 determines that it is necessary to<br>
perform the handover of the MSS 700 managed by the serving base station 710<br>
(step 719), the serving base station 710 transmits an HO_notification message to<br>
the neighbor base stations (steps 721 and 723). Herein, the HO_notification<br>
message includes information relating to a bandwidth and a service level which<br>
must be provided from a target base station, that is, a new serving base station of<br>
the MSS 700. In FIG. 7, the neighbor base stations of the serving base station 710<br>
are first and second target base stations 720 and 730.<br>
Upon receiving the HOnotification message, the first and second target<br>
base stations 720 and 730 transmit the HOnotification response message to the<br>
serving base station 710 in response to the IlO_notification message (step 725<br>
and 727). As described with reference to Table 12, the HOnotification response<br>
message includes ACK/NACK representing a response of the target base stations,<br>
that is, a response of the neighbor base stations with regard to the handover<br>
requested by the serving base station 710, and information about a bandwidth and<br>
a sen ice level of the target base stations, which must be provided to the MSS 700.<br>
The serving base station 710 receives the HOnotification response<br>
message from the first and second target base stations 720 and 730 and selects the<br>
target base stations capable of providing an optimal bandwidth and an optimal<br>
service level to the MSS 700. For instance, if the service level provided from the<br>
first target base station 720 is less than the service level requested by the MSS<br>
700 and the service level provided from the second target base station 730 is<br>
identical to the service level requested by the MSS 700, the serving base station<br>
710 selects the second target base station 730 as a final target base station<br>
performing a handover operation in relation to the MSS 700. Thus, the serving<br>
base station 710 selecting the second target base station 730 as a final target base<br>
station transmits an HO notification conform message to the second target base<br>
station 730 in response to the HO notification response message (step 729).<br>
The serving base station 710 transmits the MOB HO RSP message to the<br>
MSS 700 (step 731) after transmitting the HO_notificalion conform message to<br>
the second target base station 730. The MOB IIO RSP message includes<br>
NRecommended information selected by the serving base station 710. that is.<br>
information related to the bandwidth and the service level which must be<br>
provided to the MSS 700 from the selected target base stations (the second target<br>
base station 730 in FIG. 7) and target base stations. Upon receiving the<br>
MOB_HO_ RSP message, the MSS 700 recognizes that the handover is requested<br>
by the serving base station 710 so that the MSS 700 selects the final target base<br>
station performing the handover operation in relation to the MSS 700 based on<br>
N_Recommended information included in the MOB_ HO_ RSP message. After<br>
that, the MSS 700 transmits the MOB_HO_ IND message to the serving station<br>
710 in response to the MOB_HO_RSP message (step 733). As the<br>
MOB_HO_ IND message is received in the serving base station 710, the serving<br>
base station 710 recognizes that the MSS 700 will be handed-over to the target<br>
base station based on the MOB_HO_ IND message so that the serving base station<br>
710 releases a link connecting the serving base station to the MSS 700 (step 735).<br>
If the link connecting the MSS 700 to the serving base station 710 has been<br>
released, the MSS 700 is handed-over to the second target base station 730.<br>
As described above, according to the conventional IEEE- 802.16e<br>
communication system, the MSS is handed-over to the neighbor base station. The<br>
MSS is handed-over to the target base station, which is different from the serving<br>
base station, when the CINR of the pilot cannel signal of the serving base station<br>
becomes reduced so that it is impossible for the MSS to properh communicate<br>
with the serving base station, or when the handover is requested by the MSS or<br>
the serving base station. However, if an MSS drop occurs during the handover<br>
operation in the conventional IEEE 802.16e communication system, the MSS<br>
monitors all of the frequency bands in a similar way as to the operation of the<br>
MSS after the MSS is powered on in order to detect a pilot channel signal having<br>
the highest CINR and selects the base station, which has transmitted the pilot<br>
channel signal having the highest CINR, as a base station for the MSS. In<br>
addition, if an MSS drop occurs while the MSS is communicating with the<br>
serving base station in the conventional IEEE 802.16e communication system, the<br>
MSS monitors all of the frequency bands in the same manner as the MSS drop so<br>
as to detect a pilot channel signal having the highest CINR and selects the base<br>
station, which has transmitted the pilot channel signal having the highest CINR,<br>
as a base station for the MSS.<br>
According to the above two cases, the MSS monitors all of the frequency<br>
bands although the MSS is communicating with the serving base station,<br>
requiring a relatively long period of time for selecting the serving base station,<br>
thereby lowering sen ice quality. Therefore, it is necessary to provide an<br>
improved procedure capable of allowing the MSS subject to the drop during a<br>
communication to resume communication with a minimum time delay.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present<br>
invention will be more apparent from the following detailed description taken in<br>
conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following detailed description,<br>
representative embodiments of the present invention will be described. In addition,<br>
a detailed description of known functions and configurations incorporated herein<br>
will be omitted when it may obscure the subject matter of the present invention.<br>
The present invention provides a method for selecting a serving base<br>
station when an mobile subscriber station("MSS") is subject to a drop during a<br>
communication in an IEEE(Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)<br>
802.16e communication system, a broadband wireless access communication<br>
system. In the following description, the expression "an MSS is subject to a drop"<br>
and "a drop occurs in an MSS" are used to describe a call drop. According to the<br>
present invention, the MSS may instantly select a serving base station(BS) when<br>
the MSS is subject to the drop during a communication, so that the MSS can<br>
reestablish the communication with regard to the serving base station within a<br>
short period of time. In addition, the present invention provides a method for<br>
assigning a ranging code, that is, a drop ranging code in order to minimize the<br>
time required for network re-entry of the MSS when the MSS is subject to the<br>
drop in the IEEE 802.16e communication system.<br>
The IEEE 802.16e communication system is a broadband wireless access<br>
communication system utilizing an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing<br>
("OFDM") scheme and an orthogonal frequency division multiple access<br>
("OFDMA") scheme. Since the IEEE 802.16e communication system uses the<br>
OFDM/OFDMA schemes, the physical channel signals can be transmitted<br>
through a plurality of sub-carriers so that a high-speed data transmission is<br>
possible. In short, the IEEE 802.16e communication system is a broadband<br>
wireless access communication system capable of providing for the mobility of<br>
the MSS by using a multi-cell structure.<br>
The drop signifies that the MSS is disconnected from the serving base<br>
station during a communication. The drop is a release of" a link connecting the<br>
MSS to the serving base station, that is, a call release. The present invention has<br>
been made under the assumption that the drop occurs in the MSS after the MSS<br>
has received a mobile neighbor advertisement ("MOB_ NBR _ADV") message. If<br>
the drop occurs in the MSS, a periodic ranging cannot be normally carried out<br>
between the MSS and the serving base station. As described above in relation to<br>
the prior art, the periodic ranging is periodically carried out by means of the MSS<br>
having a time offset and its transmit power adjusted through an initial ranging, in<br>
such a manner that the MSS can adjust a channel status with respect to the base<br>
station.<br>
A process for detecting a drop by means of an MSS using a periodic<br>
ranging procedure will be described with reference to FIG. 8.<br>
FIG. 8 is a flowchart illustrating the process for detecting the drop by<br>
means of the MSS using the periodic ranging procedure in an IEEE 802.16c<br>
communication system according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, the MSS that obtains an initial synchronization with<br>
respect to the serving base station transmits a ranging request ("RNG_ REQ")<br>
message to the serving base station (step 801). A configuration of the RNG_ REQ<br>
message is identical to the configuration of the RNG_ REQ message, which has<br>
been described with reference to Table 5. so it will not be further described below.<br>
In step 803, the MSS waits for a ranging response ("RNG_ REQ") message, which<br>
is a response message to the "RNG_ REQ" message. A configuration of the<br>
RNG_RSP message is identical to the configuration of the RNG_ RSP message,<br>
which has been described with reference to Table 6, so it will not be further<br>
described below. In step 805. the MSS determines whether or not the RNGRSP<br>
message is transmitted thereto from the serving base station. If the RNGRSP<br>
message is transmitted to the MSS from the serving base station, the procedure<br>
goes to step 807. In step 807. since the ranging process has been completed, the<br>
MSS is normally operated.<br>
If the RNGRSP message has not been transmitted to the MSS from the<br>
serving base station in step 805, the procedure goes to step 809. In step 809, the<br>
MSS determines whether or not the number of transmission times of the<br>
RNG_REQ message exceeds the number of times for the RNG_ REQ RETRIES<br>
(""RNG_ REQ RETRIES"). Herein, the number of times for the RNG REQ<br>
RETRIES represents the maximum number of transmission times of the<br>
"RNG_ REQ" message by means of the MSS in a state in which the MSS does not<br>
receive the RNG_RSP message from the base station. If it is determined that the<br>
number of transmission times of the RNG_ REQ message does not exceed the<br>
number of times for the "RNG_ REQ RETRIES in step 809, the procedure returns<br>
to step 801. If it is determined that the number of transmission times of the<br>
RNG_REQ message exceeds the number of times for the RNG_REQ RETRIES<br>
in step 809, the procedure goes to step 811. In step 811, the MSS detects the drop<br>
occurring in the MSS..<br>
A process for detecting a drop by means of a serving base station using a<br>
periodic ranging procedure will be described with reference to FIG. 9.<br>
FIG. 9 is a flowchart illustrating the process for detecting the drop by<br>
means of the serving base station using the periodic ranging procedure in an IEEE<br>
802.16c communication system according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, the serving base station that obtains an initial<br>
synchronization with respect to the MSS waits for RNG_ REQ message<br>
transmitted from the MSS (step 901). In step 903, the serving base station<br>
determines whether or not the RNG REQ message is transmitted thereto from the<br>
MSS. If the RNG_ REQ message is transmitted to the serving base station from<br>
the MSS. the procedure goes to step 905. In step 905, the serving base station<br>
transmits the RNGRSP message to the MSS in response to the RNG REQ<br>
message.<br>
If the RNG_RFQ message has not been transmitted to the serving base<br>
station from the MSS in step 903. the procedure goes to step 907. In step 907, the<br>
serving base station determines whether or not the number of transmission times<br>
of the RNG REQ message exceeds the number of times for the RNG REQ<br>
RHTRIES. Herein, the serving base station may increase the number of<br>
transmission times for the RNGREQ message by 1 if the serving base station<br>
does not receive the RNG REQ message within a predetermined time<br>
(RNG REQTimeout). If it is determined that the number of transmission times<br>
of the RNGREQ message docs not exceed the number of times for the<br>
RNGREQ RETRIES in step 907, the procedure returns to step 901. If it is<br>
determined that the number of transmission times of the RNGREQ message<br>
exceeds the number of times for the RNG REQ RETRIES in step 907, the<br>
procedure goes to step 909. In step 909. the serving base station detects the drop<br>
occurring in the MSS. Accordingly, in the same manner as the normal handover<br>
procedure, the serving base station releases a link, that is, releases a call with<br>
regard to the MSS which is subject to the drop.<br>
A process for detecting a drop by using a downlink status will be<br>
described with reference to FIG. 10.<br>
FIG. 10 is a flowchart illustrating the process for detecting the drop by<br>
means of an MSS using the downlink status in an IEEE 802.16c communication<br>
system according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, the MSS initializes a value of<br>
CONSECUTIVE BAD FRAME, which is a parameter for counting the number<br>
of frames having inferior quality ("bad frame"). as "0"<br>
(CONSECUTIVEBAD 1-RAME - 0) (step 1001). The bad frame signifies a<br>
frame having inferior qualil&gt;, which cannot be used for data communication even<br>
if errors created in the frame have been corrected. In step 1003, the MSS remains<br>
in a waiting state. In step 1005, the MSS receives the downlink frame. In step<br>
1007, the MSS performs a evelie redundancy check (CRC) with respect to the<br>
received downlink frame. In step 1009. the MSS determines whether or not an<br>
error occurs in the downlink frame.<br>
If it is determined that the error is not generated from ihe downlink frame<br>
in step 1009, the procedure returns to step 1001. If it is determined that the error<br>
is generated from the downlink frame in slep 1009, the procedure goes to step<br>
1011. In step 1011, the MSS determines that the received downlink frame is a bad<br>
frame, so the MSS increase the value of the CONSECUTIVE_BAD_FRAME<br>
by 1 (CONSECUTIVE. BAD_FRAME = CONSECUTIVE .BAD_FRAME - I).<br>
In step 1013. the MSS determines whether or not the value of the<br>
CONSECUTIVE BADFRAMF. exceeds a predetermined limit number of bad<br>
frames ("LIMITBADFRAME'")- If it is determined that the value of the<br>
CONSECUTIVE_BAD_FRAME does not exceed the LIMIT_BAD_FRAME in<br>
step 1013, the procedure returns to step 1003. If it is determined that the value of<br>
the CONSECUTIVE_BAD_FRAME exceeds the LIMIT_BAD_ FRAME in step<br>
1013, the procedure goes to step 1015. In step 1015, the MSS detects the drop<br>
occurring the MSS.<br>
As described with reference to FIGS. 8 to 10, since the link connecting<br>
the MSS to the serving base station may be released if the MSS is subject to the<br>
drop, the MSS must search the serving base stations in order to reestablish a<br>
communication with regard to a new serving base station. According to the prior<br>
art, the MSS detecting the drop must monitor all of the frequency bands in the<br>
similar way as to the operation of the MSS after the MSS is powered on in order<br>
to detect a reference channel, that is. a pilot channel signal having a highest CINR<br>
and selects the base station, which has transmitted the pilot channel signal having<br>
the highest CINR. as a target base station for the MSS. The MSS also receives a<br>
preamble of the downlink frame transmitted from the target base station and<br>
obtains a system synchronization with respect to the target base station, thereby<br>
selecting the target base station as a new serving base station. A new serving base<br>
station different from the present serving base station of the MSS. that is, a<br>
serving station capable of performing the handover operation with regard to the<br>
MSS, becomes the target station. According to the present invention, the drop<br>
may occur in the MSS during a communication after the MSS has received the<br>
MOB_ NBR_ ADV message, so it is not necessary to carry out the step of monitor<br>
all of the frequency bands preset in the MSS in the similar way as the operation of<br>
the MSS after the MSS is powered in order to detect the pilot channel signal<br>
having a highest CINR for selecting the serving base station based on the pilot<br>
channel signal. According to the present invention, the new serving base station is<br>
selected from among target base stations capable of serving as a new serving base<br>
station when the drop occurs in the MSS. therebv minimizing a communication<br>
delay.<br>
According to the present invention, the MSS which is subject to the drop<br>
during communication after receiving the MOB_NBR_ADV message may select<br>
the serving base station in a different way as compared with the MSS which is<br>
subject to the drop during the handover operation. For this reason, a procedure of<br>
the MSS for selecting the serving base station will be described below by<br>
considering the two cases of the MSS, that is, a non-handover state of the MSS<br>
and a handover state of the MSS.<br>
FIG. 11 is a flowchart illustrating a procedure for selecting a serving base<br>
station when a drop occurs during a non-handover state of an MSS in an IEEE<br>
802.16e communication system according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 11, the MSS detects the drop occurring in the MSS in<br>
step 1101. In step 1103, the MSS detects information related to neighbor base<br>
stations included in the MOB_ NBR_ ADV message, which has been transmitted<br>
to the MSS from the serving base station before the drop occurs in the MSS, and<br>
sets a parameter i. used for monitoring the frequency bands of the neighbor base<br>
stations, to "0" (i = 0). A configuration of the MOB NBR ADV message is<br>
identical to the configuration of the MOB_NBR_ADV message, which has been<br>
described with reference to fable 7, and the information relating to the neighbor<br>
base stations includes the number of the neighbor base stations, identifiers of the<br>
neighbor base stations, and a physical channel frequency. In addition, the<br>
parameter i represents the number of neighbor base stations subject to the<br>
frequency band monitoring. In step 1105, the MSS sequentially selects the<br>
information about the neighbor base stations one by one (i :~ i 1) in order to<br>
monitor the frequency bands of the neighbor base stations.<br>
In step 1107. the MSS determines whether or not the target base station is<br>
detected through the frequency band monitoring for the neighbor base stations. As<br>
mentioned above, the target base station signifies a base station capable of serving<br>
as a new serving base station of the MSS. For instance, a base station providing a<br>
pilot channel signal having a CINR higher than a predetermined CINR can be<br>
selected as a target base station. If it is determined that the target base station is<br>
not detected through the frequency band monitoring for the neighbor base stations<br>
in step 1107, the procedure goes to step 1111. In step 1111, the MSS determines<br>
whether or not the parameter i representing the number of neighbor base stations<br>
subject to the frequency band monitoring is less than the number of neighbor base<br>
stations (N_NFIGHBORS) included in the MOB_ NBR_ADV message. If it is<br>
determined that the parameter i representing the number of neighbor base stations<br>
subject to the frequency band monitoring is less than the N_ NEIGHBORS in step<br>
1111, the procedure returns to step 1105.<br>
If it is determined that the parameter i representing the number of<br>
neighbor base stations subject to the frequency band monitoring is not less than<br>
the N_NEIGHBORS in step 1111. the procedure goes to step 1113. In step 1113,<br>
since the MSS fails to select the target base station from among the neighbor base<br>
stations, the MSS monitors all of the frequency bands preset in the MSS. In step<br>
1115, the MSS determines whether or not the target base station is detected. If it<br>
is determined that the target base station is not detected in step 1115, the<br>
procedure returns to step 1113. If it is determined that the target base station is<br>
delected in step 1115. the procedure goes to step 1109.<br>
If it is determined that the target base station is detected through the<br>
frequency band monitoring for the neighbor base stations in step 1107, the<br>
procedure goes to step 1109. In step 1109, the MSS selects one target base station<br>
from among the detected target base stations as a new serving base station for the<br>
MSS. If a plurality of target base stations are detected through step 1107. the MSS<br>
selects one target base station as a new serving base station for the MSS based on<br>
the value of the CINR.<br>
A procedure for selecting a serving base station when a drop occurs in an<br>
MSS after the MSS has transmitted an MOB_MSSHO_REQ message while a<br>
handover operation is being carried out at the request of the MSS in an IEEE<br>
802.16e communication system will be described with reference to FIG. 12.<br>
FIG. 12 is a flowchart illustrating the procedure for selecting the serving<br>
base station when the drop occurs in the MSS after an MSS has transmitted an<br>
MOB_ MSSHO_REQ message while the handover operation is being carried out<br>
at the request of the MSS in an IEEE 802.16e communication system according<br>
to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 12. the MSS detects the drop occurring in the MSS in<br>
step 1201. In step 1203. the MSS detects information related to neighbor base<br>
stations included in the MOB_ MSSHO_REQ message, which has been<br>
transmitted to the serving base station before the drop occurs in the MSS.<br>
Information related to the neighbor base stations included in the<br>
MOB_ MSSHO_REQ message is information relating to N_RECOMMENDED,<br>
which represents the number of base stations transmitting to the MSS the pilot<br>
channel signal having a C1NR greater than a predetermined CINR, obtained by<br>
scanning the CINRs of the pilot channel signals transmitted from<br>
N_NEIGHBORS included in the MOB_NBR_ADV message. That is. the<br>
information relating to the neighbor base stations included in the<br>
MOB_ MSSHO_REQ message is information relating to the neighbor base<br>
stations capable of serving as a target base station for the MSS, which are selected<br>
from among N_NEIGHBORS included in the MOB_NBR_ ADV message.<br>
In step 1205, the MSS sequentially orders the detected neighbor base<br>
stations according to the value of the CINR and sets a parameter i, used for<br>
monitoring the frequency bands of the neighbor base stations, to "0" (i = 0). The<br>
parameter i represents the number of neighbor base stations subject to the<br>
frequency band monitoring. In step 1207, the MSS sequentially selects the<br>
information related to the neighbor base stations one by one (i - i +l) in the order<br>
of the CINR value of the neighbor base stations in order to monitor the frequency<br>
bands of the neighbor base stations.<br>
In step 1209, the MSS determines whether or not the target base station is<br>
detected through the frequency band monitoring for the neighbor base stations.<br>
The target base station is a base station capable of serving as a new serving base<br>
station of the MSS. For instance, a base station providing a pilot channel signal<br>
having a CINR greater than a predetermined CINR can be selected as a target<br>
base station. If it is determined that the target base station is not detected through<br>
the frequency band monitoring for the neighbor base stations in step 1209, the<br>
procedure goes to step 1213. In step 1213, the MSS determines whether or not the<br>
parameter i representing the number of neighbor base stations subject to the<br>
frequency band monitoring is less than the number of neighbor base stations<br>
(N_RECOMMENDED) included in the MOB_MSSHO_REQ message. If it is<br>
determined that the parameter i representing the number of neighbor base stations<br>
subject to the frequency band monitoring is less than the N_ RECOMMENDED<br>
included in the MOB_ MSSHO_ REQ message in step 1213, the procedure returns<br>
to step 1207.<br>
If it is determined in step 1213 that the parameter i representing the<br>
number of neighbor base stations subject to the frequency band monitoring<br>
exceeds the N_ RECOMMENDED, the procedure goes to step 1215. In step 1215,<br>
since the MSS fails to select the target base station from among the neighbor base<br>
stations, the MSS monitors all of the frequency bands preset in the MSS In step<br>
1217. the MSS determines whether or not the target base station is detected. If it<br>
is determined that the target base station is not detected in step 1217. the<br>
procedure returns to step 1215. If it is determined that the target base station is<br>
detected in step 1217, the procedure goes to step 1211.<br>
If it is determined that the target base station is detected through the<br>
frequency band monitoring for the neighbor base stations in step 1209, the<br>
procedure goes to step 1211. In step 1211, the MSS selects one target base station<br>
from among the delected target base stations as a new serving base station for the<br>
MSS. If a plurality of target base stations are detected through step 1209. the MSS<br>
selects one target base station as a new serving base station for the MSS based on<br>
the value of the CINR.<br>
FIG. 13 is a flowchart illustrating the procedure for selecting the serving<br>
base station when the drop occurs in the MSS before the MSS has received the<br>
MOB HO RSP message while the handover operation is being carried out at the<br>
request of the serving base station in an IEEE 802.16e communication system<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Prior to explaining FIG. 13, it should be noted that if the drop occurs in<br>
the MSS before the MSS has received the MOB_ HO_ RSP message while the<br>
handover operation is being carried out at the request of the serving base station,<br>
it may be equal to a case in which the drop occurs in the MSS after the MSS,<br>
receiving a mobile scanning interval allocation response ("MOB_ SCN_ RSP")<br>
message during the non-handover of the MSS, has scanned the CINRs of pilot<br>
channel signals transmitted from the neighbor base stations. Therefore, although<br>
FIG. 13 shows the procedure for selecting the serving base station when the drop<br>
occurs in the MSS before the MSS has received the MOB_HO_ RSP message, if<br>
the drop occurs in the MSS before the MSS has received the MOB_ HO_ RSP<br>
message while the handover operation is being carried out at the request of the<br>
serving base station, it may be equal to a case in which the drop occurs in the<br>
MSS after the MSS receiving the MOB_SCN_ RSP message during the non-<br>
handover of the MSS has scanned the CINRs of pilot channel signals transmitted<br>
from the neighbor base stations.<br>
Referring to FIG. 13, the MSS detects the drop occurring in the MSS in<br>
step 1301. In step 1303, the MSS detects information related to the neighbor base<br>
stations included in the MOB_NBR _ADV message, which has been transmitted<br>
to the MSS from the serving base station before the drop occurs in the MSS. In.<br>
step 1305. the MSS sequentially orders the detected neighbor base stations in the<br>
order of the value of the CINR and sets a parameter i, used for monitoring the<br>
frequency bands of the neighbor base stations, to "0" (i = 0). The parameter i<br>
represents the number of neighbor base stations subject to the frequency band<br>
monitoring. In step 1307. the MSS sequentially selects the information related to<br>
the neighbor base stations one by one (i = i -l) in the order of the CINR value of<br>
the neighbor base stations in order to monitor the frequency bands of the neighbor<br>
base stations.<br>
In step 1309, the MSS determines whether or not the target base station is<br>
detected through the frequency band monitoring for the neighbor base stations. If<br>
it is determined that the target base station is not detected through the frequency<br>
band monitoring for the neighbor base stations in step 1309, the procedure goes to<br>
step 1313. In step 1313, the MSS determines whether or not the parameter i<br>
representing the number of neighbor base stations subject to the frequency band<br>
monitoring is less than the number of neighbor base stations (N_ NEIGHBORS)<br>
included in the MOB_NBR_ ADV message. If it is determined that the parameter<br>
i representing the number of neighbor base stations subject to the frequency band<br>
monitoring is less than the N_NLIGHBORS included in the MOB_ NBR_ADV<br>
message in step 1313. the procedure returns to step 1307.<br>
If it is determined in step 1313 that the parameter i representing the<br>
number of neighbor base stations subject to the frequency band monitoring<br>
exceeds the N_ NEIGHBORS included in the MOB_ NBR_ ADV message, the<br>
procedure goes to step 1315. In step 1315, since the MSS fails to select the target<br>
base station from among the neighbor base stations, the MSS monitors all of the<br>
frequency bands preset in the MSS. In step 1317, the MSS determines whether or<br>
not the target base station is detected. If it is determined that the target base<br>
station is not detected in step 1317, the procedure returns to step 1315. In addition,<br>
if it is determined that the target base station is detected in step 1317, the<br>
procedure goes to step 1311.<br>
If it is determined that the target base station is detected through the<br>
frequency band monitoring for the neighbor base stations in step 1309. the<br>
procedure goes to step 1311. In step 1311, the MSS selects one target base station<br>
from among the detected target base stations as a new serving base station for the<br>
MSS. If a plurality of target base stations are detected through step 1317, the MSS<br>
selects one target base station as a new serving base station for the MSS based on<br>
the value of the CINR.<br>
FIG. 14 is a flowchart illustrating the procedure for selecting the serving<br>
base station when the drop occurs in the MSS after the MSS has received an<br>
MOB_HO_RSP message during the handover operation in an IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Prior to explaining FIG. 14, it should be noted that the MOB_ HO_RSP<br>
message is transmitted from the MSS to the serving base station during the<br>
handover operation carried out at the request of the MSS or the serving base<br>
station and the handover operation performed at the request of the MSS must be<br>
differentiated from the handover operation performed at the request of the serving<br>
base station in the method for selecting the serving base station shown in FIG. 14.<br>
Referring to FIG. 14. the MSS detects the drop occurring in the MSS in<br>
step 1401. In step 1403, the MSS detects information related to the neighbor base<br>
stations included in the MOB_HO RSP message, which has been transmitted to<br>
the MSS from the serving base station before the drop occurs in the MSS. As<br>
described with reference to 'fable 14, the information related to the neighbor base<br>
stations included in the MOBUO RSP message represents information related to<br>
the N RECOMMENDED target base stations, which are selected from handover-<br>
support target base stations and capable of providing the bandwidth and service<br>
level requested by the MSS.<br>
In step 1405, the MSS sequentially orders the detected neighbor base<br>
stations in the order of the service level and sets a parameter i, used for<br>
monitoring frequency bands of the neighbor base stations, to "0" (i - 0). Then, the<br>
procedure goes to step 1407. The parameter i represents the number of neighbor<br>
base stations subject to the frequency band monitoring. In step 1407, the MSS<br>
sequentially selects the neighbor base stations one by one (i =- i - l) in the order of<br>
the service level provided from the neighbor base stations so as to monitor the<br>
frequency bands of the neighbor base stations.<br>
In step 1409, the MSS determines whether or not the target base station is<br>
detected through the frequency band monitoring for the neighbor base stations. If<br>
it is determined that the target base station is not detected through the frequency<br>
band monitoring for the neighbor base stations in step 1409, the procedure goes to<br>
step 1413. In step 1413, the MSS determines whether or not the parameter i<br>
representing the number of neighbor base stations subject to the frequency band<br>
monitoring is less than the number of neighbor base stations<br>
(N_RECOMMENDF.D) included in the MOB_HO_RSP message. If it is<br>
determined that the parameter i representing the number of neighbor base stations<br>
subject to the frequency band monitoring is less than the N_ RECOMMENDED<br>
included in the MOB HO RSP message in step 1413, the procedure returns to<br>
step 1407.<br>
If it is determined in step 1413 that the parameter i representing the<br>
number of neighbor base stations subject to the frequency band monitoring<br>
exceeds the NRECOMMENDED included in the MOBHO RSP message, the<br>
procedure goes to step 1415. In step 1415. since the MSS fails to detect the target<br>
base station from among the neighbor base stations, the MSS monitors all of the<br>
frequency bands preset in the MSS. In step 1417, the MSS determines whether or<br>
not the target base station is detected. If it is determined that the target base<br>
station is not detected in step 1417, the procedure returns to step 1415. If it is<br>
determined that the target base station is detected in step 1417, the procedure goes<br>
to step 1411.<br>
If it is determined that the target base station is detected through the<br>
frequency band monitoring for the neighbor base stations in step 1409, the<br>
procedure goes to step 1411. In step 1411. the MSS selects one target base station<br>
from among the detected target base stations as a nev\ serving base station for the<br>
MSS. If a plurality of target base stations are detected through step 1417, the MSS<br>
selects one target base station as a new serving base station for the MSS based on<br>
the value of the CINR, etc.<br>
FIG. 15 is a flowchart illustrating the procedure for selecting the serving<br>
base station when the drop occurs in the MSS after the MSS has transmitted the<br>
MOB HOIND message during the handover operation in the IEEE 802.16c<br>
communication system according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Prior to explaining FIG. 15, it should be noted that the MOB_ IIO_ INI)<br>
message is transmitted from the MSS to the serving base station during the<br>
handover operation carried out at the request of the MSS or the serving base<br>
station and the handover operation performed at the request of the MSS must be<br>
differentiated from the handover operation performed at the request of the serving<br>
base station in the method for selecting the serving base station shown in FIG. 14.<br>
Referring to FIG. 15. the MSS detects the drop occurring in the MSS in<br>
step 1501. In step 1503, the MSS detects related to the neighbor base stations<br>
included in the MOB_HO_ IND message, which has been transmitted to the<br>
serving base station before the drop occurs in the MSS. The MOB_HO_IND<br>
message includes information related to the final target base station of the MSS. A<br>
configuration of the MOB_HO_IND message is identical to the configuration of<br>
the MOB_HO_IND message described with reference to Table 15. so it will not<br>
be further described below.<br>
In step 1505, the MSS monitors the frequency band of the target base<br>
station detected from the MOB_HO_IND message. Then, the procedure goes to<br>
step 1507. In step 1507, the MSS determines whether or not the target base station<br>
detected from the MOB_HO_IND message is detected as a target base station of<br>
the MSS. If it is determined that the target base station detected from the<br>
MOB_HO_IND message is not detected as a target base station of the MSS in<br>
step 1507, the procedure goes to step 1403 shown in FIG 14. In addition, if it is<br>
determined that the target base station detected from the MOB_HO_IND message<br>
is not detected as a target base station of the MSS in step 1507, the procedure<br>
goes to step 1509. Tn step 1509, the MSS selects the detected target base station as<br>
a new serving base station for the MSS.A ranging procedure of an MSS by using<br>
a drop ranging code for allowing the MSS to reestablish communication within a<br>
short period of time when the drop occurs in the MSS in an IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system will be described with reference to FIG. 16.<br>
FIG. 16 is a signal How diagram illustrating the ranging procedure of the<br>
MSS by using a drop ranging code when the drop occurs in the MSS in the IEEE<br>
802.16e communication system according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Prior to explaining FIG. 16, the rangings used for the IEEE: 802.16e<br>
communication system are classified into an initial ranging, a maintenance<br>
ranging, that is. a periodic ranging, and a bandwidth request ranging in the same<br>
manner as the rangings used for the IEEE 802.16a communication system. The<br>
initial ranging, the periodic ranging, and the bandwidth request ranging used for<br>
the IEEE 802.16e communication system are identical to those of the IEEE<br>
802.16a communication system, so they will not be further described below.<br>
As described above with regard to the prior art, the base station must<br>
assign the available ranging codes according to the objects of the rangings, that is,<br>
according to the type of the rangings. In the IEEE 802.16e communication system,<br>
the ranging codes are created by segmenting a pseudo-random noise ("PN'")<br>
sequence having a predetermined bit length (for example. 215-1 bits) into<br>
predetermined ranging code units. For instance, a maximum of Q ranging codes<br>
(RC #1 to RC #Q) can be created.<br>
In the current IEEE 802.16e communication system, the Q ranging codes<br>
are differently assigned according to the objects of the rangings, that is according<br>
to the initial ranging, the periodic ranging and the bandwidth request ranging. For<br>
instance, N ranging codes are assigned for the initial ranging. M ranging codes<br>
arc assigned for the periodic ranging, and L ranging codes are assigned for the<br>
bandwidth request ranging. The total number (Q) of the ranging codes is equal to<br>
the sum of the N ranging codes for the initial ranging, the M ranging codes for the<br>
periodic ranging and the L ranging codes for the bandwidth request ranging (Q =<br>
N + M + L).<br>
However, according to the present invention, the Q ranging codes are<br>
differently assigned for the purpose of four rangings, that is, the initial ranging,<br>
the periodic ranging, the bandwidth request ranging and the drop ranging. For<br>
instance, A ranging codes are assigned for the initial ranging, B ranging codes arc<br>
assigned for the periodic ranging, C ranging codes are assigned for the bandwidth<br>
request ranging, and D ranging codes are assigned for the drop ranging. Herein,<br>
the total number (Q) of the ranging codes is equal to the sum of the A ranging<br>
codes for the initial ranging, the B ranging codes for the periodic ranging, the C<br>
ranging codes for the bandwidth request ranging, and the D ranging codes for the<br>
drop ranging (Q = A - B - C + D).<br>
In addition, the drop ranging suggested by the present invention signifies a<br>
ranging carried out for primarily reestablishing a communication when the drop<br>
occurs during communication. An operation of the drop ranging is actually<br>
similar to that of the initial ranging. When the MSS having the drop performs the<br>
drop ranging by using drop ranging codes, the base station determines that the<br>
MSS tries to reestablish the communication with regard to the base station after<br>
the drop occurs in the MSS, so the base station primarily reestablishes the<br>
communication with respect to the MSS.<br>
Referring to FIG. 16, when an initial synchronization is achieved between<br>
an MSS 1600 and a serving base station 1610 (step 1611), the MSS 1600 receives<br>
a Dl. MAP message, an UL MAP message, a DCD message, and an UCD<br>
message from the serving base station 1610 (step 1613). As described above, in<br>
one embodiment of the present invention, the UL MAP message includes an<br>
information of drop ranging codes. The servjng base station 1610 is a new serving<br>
base station selected by the MSS 1600 after the drop occurs in the MSS 1600.<br>
The MSS 1600 transmits the drop ranging code to the serving base station<br>
1610 (step 1615) in such a manner that the serving base station 1610 can<br>
recognize that the MSS 1600 is attempting to reestablish a communication after<br>
the drop occurs in the MSS 1600. Upon receiving the drop ranging code from the<br>
MSS 1600, the serving base station 1610 may recognize that the MSS 1600 is<br>
attempting to reestablish the communication with regard to the serving base<br>
station 1610 after the drop, so the serving base station 1610 transmits the<br>
DL_ MAP message, the UL_MAP message, the DCD message, and the UCD<br>
message to the MSS 1600 (step 1617). The UL_ MAP message transmitted to the<br>
MSS 1600 in step 1617 may include information related to the time slot<br>
assignment for allowing the MSS 1600 to transmit the RNG REQ message<br>
through a time slot.<br>
The MSS 1600 transmits the RNG REQ message including coded<br>
information and information related to a former serving base station, which<br>
communicates with the MSS 1600 before MSS 1600 has been subject to the drop,<br>
to the serving base station 1610 through a time slot corresponding to the time slot<br>
assignment information included in the UL_MAP message in order to reestablish<br>
the communication with respect to the serving base station 1610 (step 1619). The<br>
serving base station 1610 then transmits the RNG RSP message to the MSS 1600<br>
in response to the RNG_ REQ message (step 1621).<br>
Since the MSS 1600 is an MSS for reestablishing communication with<br>
regard to the serving base station 1610 after the drop, the serving base station<br>
primarily assigns resources to the MSS 1600 in such a manner that the MSS 1600<br>
can perform the network-entry procedure in a contention-free manner. The<br>
network-entry procedure of the MSS 1600 includes registration and<br>
authentication between the MSS 1600 and the serving base station. Upon<br>
receiving the RNGRSP message from the serving base station 1610, the MSS<br>
1600 performs the nelwork-entry procedure in relation to the serving base station<br>
1610 (step 1623).<br>
A drop ranging procedure of an MSS by using a drop ranging lime slot<br>
for allowing the MSS to reestablish communication within a short period of lime<br>
when the drop occurs in the MSS in an IEEE 802.16e communication system will<br>
be described with reference to FIG. 17.<br>
FIG. 17 is a signal flow diagram illustrating the drop ranging procedure of<br>
the MSS. which is subject to the drop, by using the drop ranging time slot in the<br>
IEEE 802.16e communication system according to one embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 17. when an initial synchronization is achieved between<br>
an MSS 1700 and a serving base station 1710 (step 1711), the MSS 1700 receives<br>
a DLMAP message, an UL_MAP message, a DCD message, and an UCD<br>
message from the serving base station 1710 (step 1713). As described above, in<br>
one embodiment of the present invention, the UL_MAP message includes an<br>
information of drop ranging time slots. The serving base station 1710 is a new<br>
serving base station selected by the MSS 1700 after the drop occurs in the MSS<br>
1700. The UL_MAP message may include information related to a drop ranging<br>
offset, that is, information related to a drop ranging time slot. A drop ranging<br>
information element (Drop_Ranging IF.) of the ULMAP message according to<br>
the present invention is represented in Table 16.<br>
Table 16<br><br>
In addition, the MSS 1700 transmits the RNG_ REQ message to the<br>
serving base station 1710 using the drop ranging time slot (step 1715) in such a<br>
manner that the serving base station 1710 can recognize that the MSS 1700 is<br>
attempting to reestablish the communication with regard to the serving base<br>
station 1710 after the drop occurs in the MSS 1700. Upon receiving the<br>
RNG_ REQ message from the MSS 1700, the serving base station 1710 may<br>
recognize that the MSS 1700 is attempting to reestablish the communication after<br>
the drop, so the serving base station 1710 transmits the RNG_ RSP message to the<br>
MSS 1700 in response to the RNG_ REQ message (step 1717). Since the MSS<br>
1700 is an MSS for reestablishing communication with regard to the serving base<br>
station 1710 after the drop, the serving base station 1710 primarily assigns<br>
resources to the MSS 1700 in such a manner that the MSS 1700 can perform the<br>
network-entry procedure in a contention-free manner. Upon receiving the<br>
RNG RSP message from the serving base station 1710, the MSS 1700 performs<br>
the network-entry procedure in relation to the serving base station 1710 (step<br>
1719).<br>
As described above, according to the present invention, the number of<br>
target base stations, which must be monitored for allowing the MSS to reestablish<br>
a communication with regard to the target base station when the MSS is subject to<br>
the drop while making communication with the serving base station, can be<br>
reduced so that the MSS can reestablish the communication with regard to the<br>
target base station within a short period of time in a broadband wireless access<br>
communication system using the OFDM /OFDMA schemes, such as the IEEE<br>
802.16e communication system. In addition, v\hen the MSS reestablishes the<br>
communication with regard to the serving base station in the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system, the MSS notifies the new serving base station of the<br>
reestablishment of the communication by using the drop ranging codes. Thus, the<br>
new serving base station may primarily assign resources to the MSS such that the<br>
MSS can reestablish communication with regard to the new serving base station<br>
within a short period of time, thereby improving service quality of the IEEE<br>
802.16e communication system.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to<br>
certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in<br>
the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended<br>
