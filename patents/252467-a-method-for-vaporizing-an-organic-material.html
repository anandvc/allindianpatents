				<td>DELIVERING PARTICULATE MATERIAL<br>
TO A VAPORIZATION ZONE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of physical vapor<br>
deposition of particulate material.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
An OLED device includes a substrate, an anode, a holetransporting<br>
layer made of an organic compound, an organic luminescent layer<br>
with suitable dopants, an organic electron-transporting layer, and a cathode.<br>
OLED devices are attractive because of their low driving voltage, high luminance,<br>
wide-angle viewing and capability for full-color flat emission displays. Tang et<br>
al. described this multilayer OLED device in their U.S. Patent Nos. 4,769,292 and<br>
4,885,211.<br>
Physical vapor deposition in a vacuum environment is the principal<br>
means of depositing thin organic material films as used in small molecule OLED<br>
devices. Such methods are well known, for example Barr in U.S. 2,447,789 and<br>
Tanabe et al. in EP 0 982 411. The organic materials used in the manufacture of<br>
OLED devices are often subject to degradation when maintained at or near the<br>
desired rate dependant vaporization temperature for extended periods of time.<br>
Exposure of sensitive organic materials to higher temperatures can cause changes<br>
in the structure of the molecules and associated changes in material properties.<br>
To overcome the thermal sensitivity of these materials, only small<br>
quantities of organic materials have been loaded in sources and they are heated as<br>
little as possible. In this manner, the material is consumed before it has reached<br>
the temperature exposure threshold to cause significant degradation. The<br>
limitations with this practice are that the available vaporization rate is very low<br>
due to the limitation on heater temperature, and the operation time of the source is<br>
very short due to the small quantity of material present in the source. In the prior<br>
art, it has been necessary to vent the deposition chamber, disassemble and clean<br>
the vapor source, refill the source, reestablish vacuum in the deposition chamber<br>
and degas the just-introduced organic material over several hours before resuming<br>
operation. The low deposition rate and the frequent and time consuming process<br>
associated with recharging a source has placed substantial limitations on the<br>
throughput of OLED manufacturing facilities.<br>
A secondary consequence of heating the entire organic material<br>
charge to roughly the same temperature is that it is impractical to mix additional<br>
organic materials, such as dopants, with a host material unless the vaporization<br>
behavior and vapor pressure of the dopant is very close to that of the host material.<br>
This is generally not the case and as a result, prior art devices frequently require<br>
the use of separate sources to co-deposit host and dopant materials.<br>
A consequence of using single component sources is that many<br>
sources are required in order to produce films containing a host and multiple<br>
dopants. These sources are arrayed one next to the other with the outer sources<br>
angled toward the center to approximate a co-deposition condition. In practice,<br>
the number of linear sources used to co-deposit different materials has been<br>
limited to three. This restriction has imposed a substantial limitation on the<br>
architecture of OLED devices, increases the necessary size and cost of the vacuum<br>
deposition chamber and decreases the reliability of the system.<br>
Additionally, the use of separate sources creates a gradient effect in<br>
the deposited film where the material in the source closest to the advancing<br>
substrate is over represented in the initial film immediately adjacent the substrate<br>
while the material in the last source is over represented in the final film surface.<br>
This gradient co-deposition is unavoidable in prior art sources where a single<br>
material is vaporized from each of multiple sources. The gradient in the deposited<br>
film is especially evident when the contribution of either of the end sources is<br>
more than a few percent of the central source, such as when a co-host is used.<br>
FIG. 1 shows a cross-sectional view of such a prior-art vaporization device 5,<br>
which includes three individual sources 6, 7, and 8 for vaporizing organic<br>
material. Vapor plume 9 is preferably homogeneous in the materials from the<br>
different sources, but in fact varies in composition from sided to side resulting in a<br>
non-homogeneous coating on substrate 15.<br>
A further limitation of prior art sources is that the geometry of the<br>
vapor manifold changes as the organic material charge is consumed. This change<br>
requires that the heater temperature change to maintain a constant vaporization<br>
rate and it is observed that the overall plume shape of the vapor exiting the<br>
orifices can change as a function of the organic material thickness and distribution<br>
in the source, particularly when the conductance to vapor flow in the source with a<br>
full charge of material is low enough to sustain pressure gradients from nonuniform<br>
vaporization within the source. In this case, as the material charge is<br>
consumed, the conductance increases and the pressure distribution and hence<br>
overall plume shape improve.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an effective way<br>
of transferring particulate material from a container to a vaporization zone.<br>
This object is achieved by 1. A method for vaporizing particulate<br>
material and condensing it onto a surface to form a layer, comprising:<br>
(a) providing a quantity of first particulate material in a first<br>
container and a quantity of second particulate material in a second container<br>
spaced apart from the first container, the first and second containers respectively<br>
having first and second openings;<br>
(b) transferring the first particulate material through the first<br>
opening in the first container into a manifold and vaporizing the first particulate<br>
material in the manifold;<br>
(c) transferring the second particulate material through the<br>
second opening in the second container into the manifold and vaporizing the<br>
second particulate material in the manifold, whereby the first and second<br>
vaporized particulate materials are mixed; and<br>
(d) delivering the mixed vaporized materials from the manifold<br>
to the surface to form the layer.<br>
It is an advantage of the present invention that the continuous<br>
heating of material during operation of prior art devices is eliminated in that only<br>
a small portion of particulate material is heated, for a short period of time and at a<br>
controlled rate. The bulk of particulate material is maintained at a temperature<br>
that can be as much as 300°C cooler than the desired rate-dependant vaporization<br>
temperature. This can be particularly advantageous when vaporizing organic<br>
materials.<br>
It is a further advantage of the present invention that it can<br>
maintain a steady vaporization rate with a continuously replenished charge of<br>
particulate material and with a steady heater temperature. The device thus allows<br>
extended operation of the source with substantially reduced risk of degrading even<br>
very temperature-sensitive organic materials.<br>
It is a further advantage of the present invention that it permits<br>
materials having different vaporization rates and degradation temperature<br>
thresholds to be co-sublimated in the same source.<br>
It is a further advantage of the present invention that it permits<br>
linear vaporization rate control by controlling the volumetric metering rate or<br>
controlling the feed pressure of the compacted particulate material.<br>
It is a further advantage of the present invention that it can rapidly<br>
stop and reinitiate vaporization and achieve a steady vaporization rate quickly by<br>
controlling the metering rate of the particulate material, minimizing contamination<br>
of the deposition chamber walls and conserving the particulate materials when a<br>
substrate is not being coated.<br>
It is a further advantage that the present device achieves<br>
substantially higher vaporization rates than in prior art devices with substantially<br>
reduced material degradation. Further still, no heater temperature change is<br>
required as the source material is consumed.<br>
It is a further advantage of the present invention that it can provide<br>
a vapor source in any orientation, which is frequently not possible with prior-art<br>
devices.<br>
It is a further advantage of some embodiments of this invention<br>
that it can remove adsorbed gases from the particulate material through the use of<br>
heat and vacuum as a much smaller quantity of particulate material is conveyed<br>
through the device.<br>
It is a further advantage of some embodiments of this invention<br>
that it can permit a temporal gradation in concentration of one or more of the<br>
particulate material components by varying the feed rate of one or more of the<br>
components relative to the other material components.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Turning now to FIG. 2, there is shown a three-dimensional view of<br>
one embodiment of an apparatus according to the present invention for vaporizing<br>
particulate materials and condensing them onto a surface to form a layer.<br>
Vaporization apparatus 10 includes manifold 20, attached feeding apparatus 40,<br>
and attached feeding apparatus 45. Feeding apparatus 40 includes at least first<br>
container 50 and feeding path 60. Feeding apparatus 45 includes at least second<br>
container 55 spaced from first container 50 and feeding path 65. First container<br>
50 is provided with a quantity of a first particulate material, such as a powder in<br>
one embodiment. Second container 55 is provided with a quantity of second<br>
particulate material. Feeding apparatus 40 can also include third container 70, and<br>
feeding apparatus 45 can also include fourth container 75. Third container 70 is<br>
associated with first container 50 and the first particulate material. Fourth<br>
container 75 is associated with second container 55 and the second particulate<br>
material. Third container 70 and fourth container 75 can receive first and second<br>
particulate materials, respectively, and transfer them to first container 50 and<br>
second container 55, respectively, as will become apparent. Manifold 20 includes<br>
one or more apertures 30 through which vaporized particulate material can exit to<br>
a substrate surface. Manifold 20 is shown in an orientation whereby it can form a<br>
layer on a horizontally-oriented substrate, but it is not limited to this orientation.<br>
Manifold 20 can be oriented vertically and can form a layer on a vertical substrate.<br>
Manifold 20 had been described in detail by Long et al. in commonly-assigned,<br>
above-cited U.S. Patent Application No. 10/784,585. Feeding apparatus 40 and<br>
feeding apparatus 45 are shown attached to opposite sides of manifold 20, but they<br>
can also be attached to the same side of manifold 20, or to the bottom of manifold<br>
20 if the manifold is in a vertical orientation. The nature of the attachment of<br>
feeding apparatus 40 to manifold 20 will become clear.<br>
Turning now to FIG. 3, there is shown a cross-sectional view of<br>
one embodiment of a portion of the above vaporization apparatus for feeding<br>
particulate material according to the present invention whereby particulate<br>
material is effectively fluidized and transferred to the auger structure. First<br>
container 50 holds first particulate material 160, which can be in the form of a<br>
finely divided powder and is desirably of a uniform size, and which feeds into<br>
auger structure 80 in feeding path 60. Auger structure 80 passes through the<br>
interior of first container 50 and feeds into the manifold described above (not<br>
shown for clarity). At least a portion of auger structure 80 is rotated by motor 90<br>
so as to transfer the first particulate material at a controlled volumetric rate or<br>
pressure along feeding path 60 to a vaporization zone where the component<br>
material is vaporized and subsequently delivered to a substrate to form a layer.<br>
Feeding path 60, and therefore first particulate material in feeding path 60, can be<br>
maintained at a temperature below the desired vaporization temperature of the<br>
component material. To facilitate the movement of first particulate material 160<br>
to auger structure 80, first particulate material 160 is fluidized by agitating first<br>
particulate material 160 by using an agitating device, e.g. piezoelectric structure<br>
130 or an electromechanical vibrator. Such fluidized material is more readily<br>
transferred to auger structure 80 by gravity feed.<br>
The addition of optional third container 70 to hold additional first<br>
particulate material 100 provides several additional advantages. A large quantity<br>
of first particuliate material 100 can be charged in the apparatus, allowing<br>
continuous operation of the device for extended periods of time. By sensing the<br>
quantity of particulate material in first container 50, e.g. by measuring the height<br>
of the column of first particulate material 160, one can selectively meter the<br>
amount of first particulate material transferred from second container 70 to first<br>
container 50 and provide a substantially constant volume of first particulate<br>
material 160 iri first container 50, e.g. ±5 cm3. In practice, 10 cm3 of particulate<br>
material is loaded in first container 50. Some embodiments described herein have<br>
great process latitude with respect to reliable particulate material feeding over a<br>
wide range of particulate material height in the container and can be run nearly to<br>
exhaustion without failing to feed particulate material. However, it is believed<br>
that multi-component mixing homogeneity is fostered if an optimum powder<br>
height is established and maintained in first container 50 to within ±10%. This<br>
minimizes variations in the feeding rate of first particulate material 160 to feeding<br>
path 60. Also, third container 70 can be arranged to be refillable without affecting<br>
the operation of first container 50, allowing the device to be continuously operated<br>
for even longer periods of time. First particulate material 100 is maintained in<br>
third container 70 by e.g. screens 110 and 120, whose mesh size is chosen to<br>
prevent the free flow of particulate material. Screens 110 and 120 can also be the<br>
mechanism for providing measured quantities of first particulate material 100 to<br>
move from third container 70 to first container 50. Screens 110 and 120 may be<br>
contacted by agitating devices (not shown) that can be actuated to cause a quantity<br>
of particulate material 100 to pass through the screen mesh. Such devices include<br>
those to vibrate the screen, or a movable arm immediately above or below the<br>
screen to allow selective agitation of screens 110 and 120. A commercial flour<br>
sifter is one sqch device well adapted for use in this application. In these sifters,<br>
three screens are used and the top surface of each screen is contacted by rotatable<br>
anns that extend radially from the center of the sifter. The arms have a V shaped<br>
cross section so as to force the powdered particulate material 100 into a<br>
converging space between the ami and the screen as the aim rotates to thereby<br>
force a controlled volume of powder through the screen. A sensing system based<br>
on the height of first particulate material 160 in first container 50 (or on an<br>
integrated signal derived from the deposition rate and time of operation) can serve<br>
to actuate the devices agitating screens 110 and 120 so as to maintain a nearly<br>
constant volume of particulate material 160 in first container 50. Agitating<br>
devices such as piezoelectric structures 140 prevent the buildup of particulate<br>
material 100 m the feed path to first container 50. Piezoelectric structures can be<br>
vibrated with multiple frequencies, e.g. a siren effect, to prevent the buildup of<br>
particulate material 100 at vibrational nodes. Feeding apparatus 45 of FIG. 2<br>
operates in an analogous manner with second container 55, fourth container 75,<br>
feeding path 65, and motor 35. Feeding apparatus 45 may also include an<br>
analogous separate agitating device for fluidizing the second particulate material<br>
by agitating it and thereby transferring it to an auger structure, an analogous<br>
means for measuring the height of the column of second particulate material in<br>
second container 55 and for metering the amount of second particulate material<br>
transferred from fourth container 75 to second container 55, and an analogous<br>
separate second auger structure that passes through the interior of second<br>
container 55 to move the second particulate material down feeding path 65 and<br>
transfer it to manifold 20.<br>
For proper operation of feeding apparatus 40 and 45, it is important<br>
to maintain a uniform feed rate of particulate material 160. Particulate material<br>
160 is generally provided in a powdered form. One important strategy for<br>
providing a free flow of particulate material 160 is to prevent bridging, a<br>
characteristic behavior of particulate materials such as powders that can occur<br>
when the powder particles self-assemble into a load-bearing structure about an<br>
opening or aperture and thereby obstruct the flow of powder through the opening.<br>
Bridging effects can occur, for example, when the dimensions of an aperture are<br>
too small to overcome a tendency of a particulate material to resist flow. Factors<br>
that may cause bridging can include particulate size relative to the aperture<br>
dimensions, humidity, electrostatic attraction between particles, vacuum levels,<br>
and friction. To alleviate this problem, the dimensions of an opening 230 at the<br>
interface of first container 50 and feeding path 60, as shown in FIG. 3 for<br>
example, must be sufficiently sized to overcome the bridging characteristics of the<br>
powdered material. This sizing requirement is best detennined empirically, taking<br>
into account worst-case conditions for the particular particulate material 160 that<br>
must be supplied, in a free flowing manner, to feeding path 60. Maintaining a<br>
nearly constant volume of particulate material 160 in first container 50 also helps<br>
to promote a constant feed rate of particulate material 160 to auger structure 80.<br>
By properly sizing opening 230 and maintaining a sufficient volume of particulate<br>
material 160 in first container 50, a uniform feed rate can be achieved for many<br>
types of powdered particulate material 160, providing a fluidized flow without<br>
requiring any supplemental form of agitation.<br>
Where the opening 230 must be narrow, feed rate uniformity can<br>
be assured when the particulate material 160 in proximity to the infeed portion of<br>
the screw auger is maintained in a fluidized state by an agitating device. This can<br>
be accomplished by slowly agitating particulate material 160 immediately above<br>
the auger screw or by inducing vibration, e.g. by piezoelectric structure 130, into<br>
particulate material 160 that is tuned to induce liquid-like behavior of the<br>
powdered particulate material 160 but is not so energetic as to cause gas-like<br>
behavior.<br>
Turning now to FIG. 4, there is shown in farther detail a crosssectional<br>
view of one embodiment of a portion of the above apparatus for feeding<br>
and vaporizing particulate material 160 according to the present invention. Auger<br>
structure 80 transfers first particulate material 160 along feeding path 60 into<br>
manifold 20 and heating element 170. Heating element 170 can be e.g. a heated<br>
screen and has been previously described in detail by Long et al. Manifold 20<br>
includes a vaporization zone which is defined as the region of feeding path 60<br>
immediately adjacent to heating element 170. A thin cross-section of particulate<br>
material 160 is heated to the desired rate-dependent temperature, which is the<br>
temperature of heating element 170, by virtue of contact and thermal conduction,<br>
whereby the thin cross-section of first particulate material 160 vaporizes.<br>
Similarly, feeding apparatus 45 of FIG. 2 transfers the second particulate material<br>
160 into manifold 20 at a second heating element, where the second particulate<br>
material 160 vaporizes in manifold 20. The first and second vaporized particulate<br>
materials 160 are mixed in manifold 20, and subsequently delivered to a substrate<br>
surface to form a layer. The auger structure 80 and its rotation rate control the<br>
rate at which particulate material 160 is fed to heating element 170. This linearly<br>
controls the rate of vaporization and therefore the rate at which particulate<br>
material 160 leaves the manifold in the vapor state. Thus the feed rate of<br>
particulate material 160 to the auger structure and to the vaporization zone<br>
controls the deposition rate of the vaporized component material onto the desired<br>
surface. With two such structures, as in FIG. 1, the relative feed rates of the first<br>
and second particulate materials 160 to the respective auger structures and the<br>
respective vaporization zones controls the relative partial pressures of the first and<br>
second particulate materials 160 in the manifold, and hence their relative<br>
deposition rates and concentrations in the deposited layer. One useful example is<br>
wherein one of particulate materials 160 is a host material and the other is a<br>
dopant.<br>
Additionally, base 180 can be included. Base 180 is a heatdissipating<br>
structure to prevent much of the heat from heating element 170 from<br>
traversing the length of feeding path 60, and thus keeps the bulk of particulate<br>
material 160 significantly cooler than the conditions it experiences in the<br>
vaporization zone immediately adjacent to heating element 170. Means of heat<br>
dissipation for base 180 have been described by Long et al. in commonlyassigned,<br>
above-cited U.S. Patent Application 10/784,585. A steep thermal<br>
gradient thereby created protects all but the immediately vaporizing material from<br>
the high temperatures. The vaporized component vapors rapidly pass through<br>
heating element 170 and can enter into the heated manifold 20. The residence<br>
time of particulate material 160 at the desired vaporization temperature is very<br>
short and as a result, thermal degradation is greatly reduced. The residence time<br>
of particulate material 160 at elevated temperature, that is, at the rate-dependent<br>
vaporization temperature, is orders of magnitude less than prior art devices and<br>
methods (seconds vs. hours or days in the prior art), which permits heating<br>
organic particulate materials 160 to higher temperatures than in the prior art.<br>
Thus, the current device and method can achieve substantially higher vaporization<br>
rates, without causing appreciable degradation of organic components of<br>
particulate material 160.<br>
Particulate material 160 can include a single component, or can<br>
include two or more different vaporizable components, such as organic material<br>
components, each one having a different vaporization temperature. The<br>
vaporization temperature can be determined by various means. For example, FIG.<br>
5 shows a graphical representation of vapor pressure versus temperature for two<br>
organic materials commonly used in OLED devices. The vaporization rate is<br>
proportional to the vapor pressure, so for a desired vaporization rate, the data in<br>
FIG. 5 can be used to define the required heating temperature corresponding to the<br>
desired vaporization rate. In the case where particulate material 160 includes two<br>
or more organic components, the temperature of heating element 170 is chosen<br>
such that the vaporization is feed-rate limited, that is, the vapor pressure at the<br>
heating element temperature is substantially above the desired partial pressure of<br>
that component in the manifold, so that each of the organic material components<br>
simultaneously vaporizes.<br>
Pressure develops in manifold 20 as vaporization proceeds, and<br>
streams of vapor exit manifold 20 through the series of apertures 30 shown in<br>
FIG. 2. Because only a small portion of particulate material 160—the portion<br>
resident in the vaporization zone—is heated to the rate-dependent vaporization<br>
temperature, while the bulk of the material is kept well below the vaporization<br>
temperature, it is possible to interrupt the vaporization by a means for interrupting<br>
heating at heating element 170, e.g. stopping the movement of auger structure 80.<br>
This can be done when a substrate surface is not being coated so as to conserve<br>
particulate material 160 and minimize contamination of any associated apparatus,<br>
such as the walls of a deposition chamber, which will be described below.<br>
Because heating element 170 can be a fine mesh screen that<br>
prevents powder or compacted material from passing freely through it, the<br>
manifold can be used in any orientation. For example, manifold 20 of FIG. 2 can<br>
be oriented down so as to coat a substrate placed below it. This is an advantage<br>
not found in the heating boats of the prior art.<br>
Turning now to FIG. 6a, there is shown a cross-sectional view of<br>
one embodiment of an auger structure useful in this invention. The auger<br>
structure 80 includes an auger screw 85 that is turned by motor 90. The distance<br>
between the threads of the screw helix and the thread height are chosen to be<br>
sufficiently large that powder tends not to pack into and rotate with the helix, but<br>
rather to remain at the bottom of a horizontally oriented auger tube and be<br>
transported linearly by virtue of the relative motion between the screw and the<br>
auger tube. For example, an auger screw with a 2.5 mm pitch screw lead and a<br>
0.8 mm thread height has been found to be an effective combination in<br>
transporting and consolidating organic material powders in a horizontal<br>
orientation.<br>
The inventors have found that auger dimensions have an affect on<br>
maintaining a uniform flow rate. Similar to the bridging effects noted above with<br>
respect to the size of opening 230, proper auger sizing and screw thread pitch is<br>
best determined empirically, considering worst-case conditions for the particular<br>
composition of particulate material 160.<br>
The inventors have also found that the angle of auger screw threads<br>
can be optimized to facilitate free flow of particulate material 160 along feeding<br>
path 60. While optimal screw thread angle may vary somewhat depending on the<br>
particular component materials of powdered particulate material 160, it has been<br>
determined that screw thread angles ranging from not less than about 4 degrees to<br>
no more than about 15 degrees relative to the rotational axis of auger structure 85<br>
provide optimal flow conditions for particulate materials 160 that are<br>
conventionally used.<br>
Various materials and surface treatments of the auger shaft have<br>
been found to facilitate auger operation, allowing increased feed rates. While<br>
stainless steel may provide acceptable performance, additional benefit may be<br>
obtained by surface treatments such as electropolishing or by coatings, such as a<br>
coating of titanium nitride.<br>
While continuous auger rotation at a sustained rate may provide an<br>
acceptable level of performance, added benefits may be obtained by pulsing the<br>
auger, providing rotation of the auger shaft in a repeated incremental fashion. A<br>
pulsing action reduces the tendency for powdered particulate material 160 to<br>
rotate with the auger screw by reducing the effective coefficient of friction<br>
between the auger screw and the particulate material. The powder feeding<br>
efficiency of auger structure 85 is thereby improved. Pulsing behavior may also<br>
be advantageous where it becomes useful to vary the feed rate over an interval, for<br>
example.<br>
In the horizontal orientation, particulate material 160 travels along<br>
the bottom of auger screw 85 in a tumbling and dispersed form. At the terminal<br>
end of auger screw 85, a powder pressure of 1 Mpa can be developed that<br>
increases the bulk density of particulate material 160 to the point where it serves<br>
as a vapor seal, preventing vaporized material in the manifold having a pressure<br>
greater than the ambient vacuum level from flowing back along the auger screw to<br>
the powder source container. As shown in FIG. 6b, the terminal end of auger<br>
screw 85 is configured to have a thread-free portion 135 having a constant circular<br>
cross section over a small length to constrain the consolidated powdered<br>
participate material 160 to form a narrow annular or tubular shape. This narrow<br>
annular shape substantially improves the thermal contact and temperature<br>
uniformity through particulate material 160, between the temperature-controlled<br>
auger screw 85 and the temperature-controlled feeding path 60. This<br>
configuration additionally assures good temperature uniformity of particulate<br>
material 160 at a given transverse cross section relative to a circular cross section<br>
and substantially increases the attainable temperature gradient in particulate<br>
material 160 between the auger structure and the heating element. The powdered<br>
particulate material 160 is extruded from the auger structure in a tubular shape and<br>
is sufficiently consolidated that it can maintain the tubular extruded form for at<br>
least several millimeters upon exiting the support of the auger tube. This solid<br>
form prevents pressurized vapor, resulting from organic material vaporization,<br>
from flowing back into the auger structure and enables the powdered particulate<br>
material 160 to bridge the short gap between the end of the temperature-controlled<br>
auger structure and the heating element.<br>
Thermal modeling of a powder dispensing system having this<br>
annular configuration where the heating element is spaced 130 |im from the end of<br>
the auger structure 85 indicates that an average axial thermal gradient of 0.5°C/|im<br>
can be achieved through that portion of particulate material 160 spanning heating<br>
element 170 and the terminal end of the auger structure when the temperature<br>
differential between the two is 270°C. There can therefore be a 100°C<br>
temperature drop through the first 200 |im of consolidated powdered particulate<br>
material 160. This gradient prevents the usual leaching of more volatile<br>
constituents from bulk volumes of mixed-component organic materials and<br>
enables a single source to co-deposit multiple organic materials. This large<br>
gradient is further instrumental in maintaining particulate material 160 in a<br>
consolidated powder form at the exit of the auger tube even when organic<br>
component materials that liquefy before vaporizing are employed.<br>
The auger structure 80 shown in FIG. 6a is effective at transporting<br>
particulate material 160 powders horizontally, but is not as effective in<br>
transporting particulate material 160 vertically, since the particulate tends to<br>
simply rotate with the screw and not advance along the length of the structure.<br>
Turning now to FIG. 6c, there is a relief view of another embodiment of an auger<br>
structure 95 useful in this invention. In this embodiment, auger structure 95<br>
includes two or more auger screws, e.g. auger screws 85a, 85b, and 85c, with<br>
identical interlaced helical threads. All of the auger screws 85a, 85b, and S5c<br>
rotate in the same direction. Particulate material 160 that is packed between the<br>
threads of one auger screw, e.g. 85a, will be removed as the material rotates into<br>
contact with the interlaced thread of the second rotating auger screw, e.g. 85b,<br>
because the facing portions of adjacent screws move in opposite directions.<br>
Auger structure 95 thus overcomes the orientation restrictions of the single-screw<br>
auger structure of FIG. 6a while retaining the ability to consolidate powdered<br>
particulate material 160 into a solid shape and form a vapor seal. The discharge<br>
portion of auger structure 95 would have an elongated cross-section that can<br>
extend across the entire length of the manifold so as to inject material<br>
substantially uniformly along its length.<br>
Turning now to FIG. 6d, there is a cross-sectional view of another<br>
embodiment of an auger structure 105 useful in this invention. Auger structure<br>
105 includes a rotating helical thread 115, a stationary center portion 125, and a<br>
stationary outer tube, which in this case is feeding path 60. In this embodiment,<br>
only a portion of auger structure 105—the portion comprising helical threads<br>
115—rotates and is turned by motor 90. Powdered particulate material 160<br>
feeding with circular cross section helical threads has been demonstrated. The<br>
thread consisted of a steel wire 0.7 mm diameter formed into a helix of 5 mm<br>
outside diameter and 2.5 mm pitch. Smooth wires of other materials such as<br>
titanium and stainless steel are also suitable. The wire can also have a noncircular<br>
cross section, with a rectangular cross section being particularly<br>
advantageous as it provides additional rigidity to prevent the helical thread from<br>
changing dimensions as it encounters torsional resistance while pushing the<br>
powdered particulate material 160. Stationary center portion 125, in cooperation<br>
with feeding path 60, substantially prevents all but a thin film of powdered<br>
particulate material 160 from rotating with the auger. Auger structure 105 does<br>
not rely on gravity to accumulate powdered particulate material 160 and will<br>
operate in any orientation. Auger structure 105 also consolidates the powdered<br>
particulate material 160 into a thin annular shape that substantially improves the<br>
thermal contact between particulate material 160 and temperature-controlled<br>
feeding path 60 and stationary center portion 125. These characteristics are<br>
significant in enabling the controlled vaporization of mixed component organic<br>
materials, and organic materials that liquefy before vaporizing. Thus this<br>
embodiment overcomes the orientation restrictions of the first auger structure<br>
while retaining the ability to consolidate the powdered particulate material 160<br>
into a solid shape and form a vapor seal.<br>
The above embodiments of this invention, based primarily on<br>
vaporization apparatus 10 of FIG. 2, are useful at atmospheric pressure and<br>
pressures down to about one-half atmosphere. Experimentally, it has been<br>
observed that fine powder is considerably more difficult to meter in a partial<br>
vacuum below half an atmosphere. The powdered particulate material 160<br>
agglomerates as residual air molecules are removed, and undergoes a reduction of<br>
the elastic coupling between particles that is effective in communicating<br>
vibrational energy through powdered particulate material 160 under atmospheric<br>
conditions. This effect negatively influences the powder-feeding uniformity of<br>
the auger structure. Therefore, a different agitating device can be necessary.<br>
Turning now to FIG. 7, there is shown a cutaway view of another embodiment of<br>
an agitating device useful in the present invention for overcoming the limitations<br>
in low-pressure conditions. This embodiment employs three piezoelectric<br>
structures as the agitating device. Piezoelectric structures 150 and 155 are<br>
inclined at a steep angle and form opposite walls of a funnel at the bottom of first<br>
container 50. The bottom portion 190 of these two piezoelectric structures is not<br>
supported and leads directly to the infeed portion of auger structure 80. The<br>
unsupported portions of the piezoelectric structures have high vibration amplitude<br>
and are effective in fluidizing particulate material 160 in proximity to their<br>
surfaces. The third piezoelectric structure 130 is mounted below auger structure<br>
80 and imparts vibration whose amplitude is essentially perpendicular to the<br>
vibration of the other two piezoelectric structures. The piezoelectric structures are<br>
driven by a frequency sweeping circuit. The changing frequency is instrumental<br>
in preventing the formation of nodes and improves the powder feeding efficiency<br>
considerably. Auger structure 80 can be any of the above-described auger<br>
structures.<br>
FIG. 8 is a cutaway view of another embodiment of an agitating<br>
device useful in the present invention for overcoming the limitations in lowpressure<br>
conditions. Opening 230 represents the lower end of the above-described<br>
first container 50. Rotating thread type device 210 includes left- and right-hand<br>
helically wound wires on a common shaft. Rotating thread type device 210 is<br>
positioned above the infeed portion of the auger structure such that the wires are<br>
substantially tangent to the threads of auger structure 80. The rotating thread<br>
should not interfere with the auger screw threads, but it will continue to operate<br>
effectively with as much as 1 mm clearance. Rotating thread type device 210 is<br>
slowly rotated via gear drive 220, by motor 90, which also turns auger structure<br>
80. In practice, the rotational speed of the rotating thread type device 210 can<br>
vary depending on the particle size and properties of the particular particulate<br>
material 160, but a practical guide is to have the axial slew rate of the rotating<br>
thread match the axial slew rate of the threads of the auger screw. The wires of<br>
rotating thread type device 210 tend to push particulate material 160 toward the<br>
center of opening 230 and prevent powder bridging over auger structure SO.<br>
Auger structure 80 can be any of the above-described auger structures. This<br>
agitating device is well adapted to feeding mixed-component organic materials as<br>
it imparts very little energy to particulate material 160 and is therefore not likely<br>
to cause particle separation by size or density.<br>
FIG. 9 is a cross-sectional view of another embodiment of an<br>
apparatus according to the present invention for vaporizing particulate materials<br>
160 and condensing them onto a surface to form a layer. In this embodiment, first<br>
container 50 and second container 55 are spaced apart, but positioned in such a<br>
way that the feeding paths (represented by first auger structure 250 and second<br>
auger structure 255, respectively) terminate in close proximity. First particulate<br>
material 240 in first container 50 is fluidized and then transferred by first auger<br>
structure 250 into mixing chamber 260 in manifold 20. Second particulate<br>
material 245 irt second container 55 is fluidized and then transferred by second<br>
auger structure 255 into mixing chamber 260 in manifold 20, where it mixes with<br>
first particulate material 240. The mixed first and second particulate materials<br>
240 and 245 are vaporized by heating element 170, and can be delivered to a<br>
substrate surface by manifold 20. The relative feed rates of the first and second<br>
particulate material 240 and 245 to the respective auger structures and the<br>
respective vaporization zones controls the relative concentrations of materials in<br>
the deposited layer, as well as the deposition rate. Such an apparatus can enable a<br>
gradient in dopant concentration through the thickness of a deposited layer, or can<br>
create a smooth transition from one layer to the next by adjusting the<br>
concentration of the first particulate material 240 from 100 % to 0 % while the<br>
second host particulate material 245 concentration is simultaneously adjusted<br>
from 0 % to 100 %. Multiple auger screw systems can be repeated along the<br>
length of the source to independently feed different particulate materials so as to<br>
deposit a series of layers in this way.<br>
In practice, the apparatus described herein is operated as follows.<br>
A first organic particulate material 160, which is useful in forming a layer on an<br>
OLED device, is provided into third container 70, and a second organic particulate<br>
material 160 is provided into fourth container 75. The first particulate material<br>
160 is transferred in a controlled manner to first container 50 and the second<br>
particulate material 160 to second container 55 in such a way as to maintain a<br>
substantially constant volume of particulate materials in the first and second<br>
containers. Each particulate material 160 can be fluidized by means described<br>
herein and thereby transferred to a respective auger structure, which transfers the<br>
particulate materials 160 to one or more vaporization zones as described herein.<br>
At least one component of the particulate material 160 is vaporized in the<br>
vaporization zone(s) into a manifold 20, which delivers the vaporized material to<br>
the surface of an OLED substrate to form a layer, as will be described below.<br>
As has been noted hereinabove, vacuum levels may tend to<br>
complicate the problem of metering out uniform amounts of finely powdered<br>
organic materials 160. Referring back to FIG. 2, it can be observed that a<br>
continuous column of particulate material 160 is maintained in feeding path 60.<br>
In one embodiment, this column of particulate material 160, if suitably<br>
compacted, can be utilized as a type of vacuum seal, where particulate<br>
characteristics of particulate material 160 allow. With this arrangement, a high<br>
vacuum level can be present for particulate material 160 at heating element 170<br>
and in the manifold 20. A lower vacuum level can then be maintained at first<br>
container 50, which may even be at atmospheric pressure. Even a partial seal<br>
could be advantageous. This sealing effect could also be used to isolate ambient<br>
gases used for storage of organic particulate material 160 in first container 50<br>
and/or for organic particulate material 100 in second container 70. With some<br>
materials, for example, it is beneficial to store materials under an inert gas such as<br>
argon or helium.<br>
Turning now to FIG. 10, there is shown an embodiment of a device<br>
of this disclosure including a deposition chamber enclosing a substrate.<br>
Deposition chamber 280 is an enclosed apparatus that permits an OLED substrate<br>
285 to be coated with organic material transferred from manifold 20. Manifold 20<br>
is supplied with organic material via feeding path 60 as described above. For<br>
clarity of illustration, only a single feeding path is shown. Deposition chamber<br>
280 is held under controlled conditions, e.g. a pressure of 1 torr or less provided<br>
by vacuum source 300. Deposition chamber 280 includes load lock 275 which<br>
can be used to load uncoated OLED substrates 285, and unload coated OLED<br>
substrates. OLED substrate 285 can be moved by translational apparatus 295 to<br>
provide even coating of vaporized organic material over the entire surface of<br>
OLED substrate 285. Although vaporization apparatus is shown as partially<br>
enclosed by deposition chamber 280, it will be understood that other arrangements<br>
are possible, including arrangements wherein the entire vaporization apparatus,<br>
including any container or containers for holding powdered particulate material<br>
160, is enclosed by deposition chamber 280.<br>
In practice, an OLED substrate 285 is placed in deposition chamber<br>
280 via load lock 275 and held by translational apparatus 295 or associated<br>
apparatus. The vaporization apparatus is operated as described above, and<br>
translational apparatus 295 moves OLED substrate 285 perpendicular to the<br>
direction of emission of organic material vapors from manifold 20, thus delivering<br>
mixed vaporized organic material to the surface of OLED substrate 285 to<br>
condense and form a layer of organic material on the surface.<br>
Turning now to FIG. 11, there is shown a cross-sectional view of a<br>
pixel of a light-emitting OLED device 310 that can be prepared in part according<br>
to the present invention. The OLED device 310 includes at a minimum a<br>
substrate 320, a cathode 390, an anode 330 spaced from cathode 390, and a lightemitting<br>
layer 350. The OLED device can also include a hole-injecting layer 335,<br>
a hole-transporting layer 340, an electron-transporting layer 355, and an electroninjecting<br>
layer 360. Hole-injecting layer 335, hole-transporting layer 340, lightemitting<br>
layer 350, electron-transporting layer 355, and electron-injecting layer<br>
360 include a series of organic layers 370 disposed between anode 330 and<br>
cathode 390. Organic layers 370 are the organic material layers most desirably<br>
deposited by the device and method of this invention. These components will be<br>
described in more detail.<br>
Substrate 320 can be an organic solid, an inorganic solid, or a<br>
combination of organic and inorganic solids. Substrate 320 can be rigid or<br>
flexible and can be processed as separate individual pieces, such as sheets or<br>
wafers, or as a continuous roll. Typical substrate materials include glass, plastic,<br>
metal, ceramic, semiconductor, metal oxide, semiconductor oxide, semiconductor<br>
nitride, or combinations thereof. Substrate 320 can be a homogeneous mixture of<br>
materials, a composite of materials, or multiple layers of materials. Substrate 320<br>
can be an OLED substrate, that is a substrate commonly used for preparing OLED<br>
devices, e.g. active-matrix low-temperature polysilicon or amorphous-silicon TFT<br>
substrate. The substrate 320 can either be light transmissive or opaque, depending<br>
on the intended direction of light emission. The light transmissive property is<br>
desirable for viewing the EL emission through the substrate. Transparent glass or<br>
plastic are commonly employed in such cases. For applications where the EL<br>
emission is viewed through the top electrode, the transmissive characteristic of the<br>
bottom support is immaterial, and therefore can be light transmissive, light<br>
absorbing or light reflective. Substrates for use in this case include, but are not<br>
limited to, glass, plastic, semiconductor materials, ceramics, and circuit board<br>
materials, or any others commonly used in the formation of OLED devices, which<br>
can be either passive-matrix devices or active-matrix devices.<br>
-20-<br>
An electrode is formed over substrate 320 and is most commonly<br>
configured as an anode 330. When EL emission is viewed through the substrate<br>
320, anode 330 should be transparent or substantially transparent to the emission<br>
of interest. Common transparent anode materials useful in this invention are<br>
indium-tin oxide and tin oxide, but other metal oxides can work including, but not<br>
limited to, aluminum- or indium-doped zinc oxide, magnesium-indium oxide, and<br>
nickel-tungsten oxide. In addition to these oxides, metal nitrides such as gallium<br>
nitride, metal selenides such as zinc selenide, and metal sulfides such as zinc<br>
sulfide, can be used as an anode material. For applications where EL emission is<br>
viewed through the top electrode, the transmissive characteristics of the anode<br>
material are immaterial and any conductive material can be used, transparent,<br>
opaque or reflective. Example conductors for this application include, but are not<br>
limited to, gold, indium, molybdenum, palladium, and platinum. The preferred<br>
anode materials, transmissive or otherwise, have a work function of 4.1 eV or<br>
greater. Desired anode materials can be deposited by any suitable means such as<br>
evaporation, sputtering, chemical vapor deposition, or electrochemical means.<br>
Anode materials can be patterned using well known photolithographic processes.<br>
While not always necessary, it is often useful that a hole-injecting<br>
layer 335 be formed over anode 330 in an organic light-emitting display. The<br>
hole-injecting material can serve to improve the film formation property of<br>
subsequent organic layers and to facilitate injection of holes into the holetransporting<br>
layer. Suitable materials for use in hole-injecting layer 335 include,<br>
but are not limited to, porphyrinic compounds as described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,720,432, plasma-deposited fluorocarbon polymers as described in U.S. Patent<br>
No. 6,208,075, and inorganic oxides including vanadium oxide (VOx),<br>
molybdenum oxide (MoOx), nickel oxide (NiOx), etc. Alternative hole-injecting<br>
materials reportedly useful in organic EL devices are described in<br>
EP0891 121 Al andEP 1 029 909 AJ.<br>
While not always necessary, it is often useful that a holetransporting<br>
layer 340 be formed and disposed over anode 330. Desired holetransporting<br>
materials can be deposited by any suitable means such as<br>
evaporation, sputtering, chemical vapor deposition, electrochemical means,<br>
thermal transfer, or laser thermal transfer from a donor material, and can be<br>
deposited by the device and method described herein. Hole-transporting materials<br>
useful in hole-transporting layer 340 are well known to include compounds such<br>
as an aromatic tertiary amine, where the latter is understood to be a compound<br>
containing at least one trivalent nitrogen atom that is bonded only to carbon<br>
atoms, at least one of which is a member of an aromatic ring. In one form the<br>
aromatic tertiary amine can be an arylamine, such as a monoarylamine,<br>
diarylamine, tiriarylamine, or a polymeric arylamine. Exemplary monomeric<br>
triarylamines are illustrated by Klupfel et al. in U.S. Patent No. 3,180,730. Other<br>
suitable triarylamines substituted with one or more vinyl radicals and/or<br>
comprising at least one active hydrogen-containing group are disclosed by<br>
Brantley et al. in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,567,450 and 3,658,520.<br>
A more preferred class of aromatic tertiary amines are those which<br>
include at least two aromatic tertiary amine moieties as described in U.S. Patent<br>
Nos. 4,720,432 and 5,061,569. Such compounds include those represented by<br>
structural Formula A.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Qi and Ch are independently selected aromatic tertiary amine moieties; and<br>
G is a linking group such as an arylene, cycloalkylene, or alkylene group<br>
of a carbon to carbon bond.<br>
In one embodiment, at least one of Ql or Q2 contains a polycyclic<br>
fused ring structure, e.g., a naphthalene. When G is an aryl group, it is<br>
conveniently a phenylene, biphenylene, or naphthalene moiety.<br>
A useful class of triarylamines satisfying structural Formula A and<br>
containing two triarylamine moieties is represented by structural Formula B.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
where:<br>
RI and R2 each independently represent a hydrogen atom, an aryl group, or<br>
an alkyl group or RI and R2 together represent the atoms completing a cycloalkyl<br>
group; and<br>
R3 and R4 each independently represent an aryl group, which is in turn<br>
substituted with a diaryl substituted ammo group, as indicated by structural<br>
Formula C.<br>
wherein Rs and Rg are independently selected aryl groups. In one embodiment, at<br>
least one of RS or R6 contains a polycyclic fused ring structure, e.g., a<br>
naphthalene.<br>
Another class of aromatic tertiary amines are the tetraaryldiamines.<br>
Desirable tetraaryldiamines include two diarylamino groups, such as indicated by<br>
Formula C, linked through an arylene group. Useful tetraaryldiamines include<br>
those represented by Formula D.<br>
each Are is an independently selected arylene group, such as a phenylene<br>
or anthracene moiety;<br>
n is an integer of from 1 to 4; and<br>
Ar, R-j, RS, and Rg are independently selected aryl groups.<br>
In a typical embodiment, at least one of Ar, R7, Rg, and R is a<br>
polycyclic fused ring structure, e.g., a naphthalene.<br>
The various alkyl, alkylene, aryl, and arylene moieties of the<br>
foregoing structural Formulae A, B, C, D, can each in turn be substituted. Typical<br>
substituents include alkyl groups, alkoxy groups, aryl groups, aryloxy groups, and<br>
halogens such as fluoride, chloride, and bromide. The various alkyl and alkylene<br>
moieties typically contain from 1 to about 6 carbon atoms. The cycloalkyl<br>
moieties can contain from 3 to about 10 carbon atoms, but typically contain five,<br>
six, or seven carbon atoms--e.g., cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and cycloheptyl ring<br>
structures. The aryl and arylene moieties are usually phenyl and phenylene<br>
moieties.<br>
The hole-transporting layer in an OLED device can be formed of a<br>
single or a mixture of aromatic tertiary amine compounds. Specifically, one can<br>
employ a triarylamine, such as a triarylamine satisfying the Formula B, in<br>
combination with a tetraaryldiamine, such as indicated by Formula D. When a<br>
triarylamine is employed in combination with a tetraaryldiamine, the latter is<br>
positioned as a layer inteiposed between the triarylamine and the electroninjecting<br>
and transporting layer. The device and method described herein can be<br>
used to deposit single- or multi-component layers, and can be used to sequentially<br>
deposit multiple layers.<br>
Another class of useful hole-transporting materials includes<br>
polycyclic aromatic compounds as described in EP 1 009 041. In addition,<br>
polymeric hole-transporting materials can be used such as poly(N-vinylcarbazole)<br>
(PVK), polythiophenes, polypyrrole, polyaniline, and copolymers such as<br>
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxytiiiophene)/poly(4-styrenesulfonate) also called<br>
PEDOT/PSS.<br>
Light-emitting layer 350 produces light in response to hole-electron<br>
recombination. Light-emitting layer 350 is commonly disposed over holetransporting<br>
layer 340. Desired organic light-emitting materials can be deposited<br>
by any suitable means such as evaporation, sputtering, chemical vapor deposition,<br>
electrochemical means, or radiation thermal transfer from a donor material, and<br>
can be deposited by the device and method described herein. Useful organic lightemitting<br>
materials are well known. As more fully described in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
4,769,292 and 5,935,721, the light-emitting layers of the organic EL element<br>
include a luminescent or fluorescent material where electroluminescence is<br>
produced as a result of electron-hole pair recombination in this region. The lightemitting<br>
layers can include a single material, but more commonly include a host<br>
material doped with a guest compound or dopant where light emission comes<br>
primarily from the dopant. The dopant is selected to produce color light having a<br>
particular spectrum. The host materials in the light-emitting layers can be an<br>
electron-transporting material, as defined below, a hole-transporting material, as<br>
defined above, or another material that supports hole-electron recombination. The<br>
dopant is usually chosen from highly fluorescent dyes, but phosphorescent<br>
compounds, e.g., transition metal complexes as described in WO 98/55561, WO<br>
00/18851, WO 00/57676, and WO 00/70655 are also useful. Dopants are<br>
typically coated as 0.01 to 10 % by weight into the host material. The device and<br>
method described herein can be used to coat multi-component guest/host layers<br>
without the need for multiple vaporization sources.<br>
Host and emitting molecules known to be of use include, but are<br>
not limited to, those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,768,292; 5,141,671;<br>
5,150,006; 5,151,629; 5,294,870; 5,405,709; 5,484,922; 5,593,788; 5,645,948;<br>
5,683,823; 5,755,999; 5,928,802; 5,935,720; 5,935,721; and 6,020,078.<br>
Metal complexes of 8-hydroxyquinoline and similar derivatives<br>
(Formula E) constitute one class of useful host materials capable of supporting<br>
electroluminescence, and are particularly suitable for light emission of<br>
wavelengths longer than 500 nm, e.g., green, yellow, orange, and red.<br>
wherein:<br>
M represents a metal;<br>
n is an integer of from 1 to 3; and<br>
Z independently in each occurrence represents the atoms completing a<br>
nucleus having at least two fused aromatic rings.<br>
From the foregoing it is apparent that the metal can be a<br>
monovalent, divalent, or trivalent metal. The metal can, for example, be an alkali<br>
metal, such as lithium, sodium, or potassium; an alkaline earth metal, such as<br>
magnesium or calcium; or an earth metal, such as boron or aluminum. Generally<br>
any monovalent, divalent, or trivalent metal known to be a useful chelating metal<br>
can be employed.<br>
Z completes a heterocyclic nucleus containing at least two fused<br>
aromatic rings, at least one of which is an azole or azine ring. Additional rings,<br>
including both aliphatic and aromatic rings, can be fused with the two required<br>
rings, if required. To avoid adding molecular bulk without improving on function<br>
the number of ring atoms is usually maintained at 18 or less.<br>
The host material in light-emitting layer 350 can be an anthracene<br>
derivative having hydrocarbon or substituted hydrocarbon substituents at the 9 and<br>
10 positions. For example, derivatives of 9,10-di-(2-naphthyl)anthracene<br>
constitute one class of useful host materials capable of supporting<br>
electroluminescence, and are particularly suitable for light emission of<br>
wavelengths longer than 400 nm, e.g., blue, green, yellow, orange or red.<br>
Benzazole derivatives constitute another class of useful host<br>
materials capable of supporting electroluminescence, and are particularly suitable<br>
for light emission of wavelengths longer than 400 nm, e.g., blue, green, yellow,<br>
orange or red. An example of a useful benzazole is 2, 2', 2"-(l,3,5~<br>
phenylene)tris[l -phenyl-1 H-benzimidazolej.<br>
Desirable fluorescent dopants include perylene or derivatives of<br>
perylene, derivatives of anthracene, tetracene, xanthene, rubrene, coumarin,<br>
rhodainine, quinacridone, dicyanomethylenepyran compounds, thiopyran<br>
compounds, polymethine compounds, pyrilium and thiapyrilium compounds,<br>
derivatives of distryrylbenzene or distyrylbiphenyl, bis(azinyl)methane boron<br>
complex compounds, and carbostyryl compounds.<br>
Other organic emissive materials can be polymeric substances, e.g.<br>
polyphenylenevinylene derivatives, dialkoxy-polyphenylenevinylenes, poly-paraphenylene<br>
derivatives, and polyfluorene derivatives, as taught by Wolk et al. in<br>
commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 6,194,119 Bl and references cited therein.<br>
While not always necessary, it is often useful that OLED device<br>
310 includes an electron-transporting layer 355 disposed over light-emitting layer<br>
350. Desired electron-transporting materials can be deposited by any suitable<br>
means such as evaporation, sputtering, chemical vapor deposition, electrochemical<br>
means, thermal transfer, or laser thermal transfer from a donor material, and can<br>
be deposited by the device and method described herein. Preferred electron-<br>
transporting materials for use in electron-transporting layer 355 are metal chelated<br>
oxinoid compounds, including chelates of oxine itself (also commonly referred to<br>
as 8-quinolinol or 8-hydroxyquinoline). Such compounds help to inject and<br>
transport electrons and exhibit both high levels of performance and are readily<br>
fabricated in the form of thin films. Exemplary of contemplated oxinoid<br>
compounds are those satisfying structural Formula E, previously described.<br>
Other electron-transporting materials include various butadiene<br>
derivatives as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,356,429 and various heterocyclic<br>
optical brighteners as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,539,507. Benzazoles<br>
satisfying structural Formula G are also useful electron-transporting materials.<br>
Other electron-transporting materials can be polymeric substances,<br>
e.g. polyphenylenevinylene derivatives, poly-para-phenylene derivatives,<br>
polyfluorene derivatives, polythiophenes, polyacetylenes, and other conductive<br>
polymeric organic materials such as those listed in Handbook of Conductive<br>
Molecules and Polymers, Vols. 1-4, H.S. Nalwa, ed., John Wiley and Sons,<br>
Chichester(1997).<br>
An electron-injecting layer 360 can also be present between the<br>
cathode and the electron-transporting layer. Examples of electron-injecting<br>
materials include alkaline or alkaline earth metals, alkali halide salts, such as LiF<br>
mentioned above, or alkaline or alkaline earth metal doped organic layers.<br>
Cathode 390 is formed over the electron-transporting layer 355 or<br>
over light-emitting layer 350 if an electron-transporting layer is not used. When<br>
light emission is through the anode 330, the cathode material can include nearly<br>
any conductive material. Desirable materials have good film-forming properties<br>
to ensure good contact with the underlying organic layer, promote electron<br>
injection at low voltage, and have good stability. Useful cathode materials often<br>
contain a low work function metal (
cathode material is include of a Mg:Ag alloy wherein the percentage of silver is in<br>
the range of 1 to 20 %, as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,885,221. Another<br>
suitable class of cathode materials includes bilayers includes a thin layer of a low<br>
work function metal or metal salt capped with a thicker layer of conductive metal.<br>
One such cathode includes a thin layer of LiF followed by a thicker layer of Al as<br>
-27-<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 5,677,572. Other useful cathode materials include,<br>
but are not limited to, those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,059,861; 5,059,862;<br>
and 6,140,763.<br>
When light emission is viewed through cathode 390, it must be<br>
transparent or nearly transparent. For such applications, metals must be thin or<br>
one must use transparent conductive oxides, or a combination of these materials.<br>
Optically transparent cathodes have been described in more detail in U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,776,623. Cathode materials can be deposited by evaporation, sputtering, or<br>
chemical vapor deposition. When needed, patterning can be achieved through<br>
many well known methods including, but not limited to, through-mask deposition,<br>
integral shadow masking as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,276,380 and EP 0 732<br>
868, laser ablation, and selective chemical vapor deposition.<br>

The invention has been described in detail with particular reference<br>
to certain preferred embodiments thereof, namely for delivery of organic<br>
particulate materials to a vaporization zone. However, it can be appreciated that<br>
the present invention applies more broadly to particulate materials, including<br>
organic and other types of particulate materials. The term "particulate materials"<br>
can include a broad range of substances in particulate form, including, but not<br>
limited to, crystals, nanotubes, powders, needles, flakes, and other solid materials<br>
that can be classified as discontinuous, for example. Moreover, the particulate<br>
materials may be provided in a mixture containing a quantity of inert material or<br>
materials acting as a carrier for the component material. Inert earners could<br>
include other types of solid materials as well as pastes and liquids, particularly<br>
liquid materials having higher viscosities. Any inert material selected must be<br>
compatible with the vaporization process, such that the inert carrier is<br>
appropriately discarded before or during the vaporization of the component<br>
particulate material. For example, the inert carrier can be selected from materials<br>
having a much higher vaporization temperature than the desired particulate<br>
component material. As just one example, particulate material 100 (FIG. 3) could<br>
be a mixture containing sand and the particulate component material that is to be<br>
vaporized. The utilization of such an inert earner, with suitable mixing<br>
techniques, would allow the metering of minute quantities of a component<br>
particulate material, such as an organic particulate material, for vaporization.<br>
