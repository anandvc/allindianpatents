				<td>Method of impregnating a carrier matrix with solid<br>
and/or liquid compounds using compressed gases, and<br>
materials thus impregnated<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to a method of<br>
impregnating a carrier matrix with solid and/or liquid<br>
compounds using compressed gases or gas mixtures, and<br>
materials impregnated in this manner.<br>
In the last 20 years, the use of compressed gases as<br>
solvent has developed markedly in industry. After the<br>
extraction of natural substances, for example methods<br>
of decaffeination, principally played a role in the<br>
1980s, the potential use of compressed gases has<br>
shifted in the 1990s to the "material sciences":<br>
supercritical gases are thus now being used, inter<br>
alia, in chemical processes for reducing the viscosity<br>
of solutions or for producing ultrafine particles. In<br>
the very near future, it is expected that supercritical<br>
gases will increasingly be used in chemical process<br>
engineering.<br>
Because of its inert properties, its toxicological<br>
safety, availability and physical and physicochemical<br>
properties, carbon dioxide plays the most important<br>
role concerning supercritical solvents in process<br>
engineering in general (McHugh &amp; Krukonis,<br>
Supercritical Fluid Extraction, 2nd Edition,<br>
Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston, 1994) .<br>
An important motivation for using gases in the<br>
supercritical state is frequently their markedly lower<br>
viscosity compared with "liquid" solvents and the fact<br>
that the density in the supercritical state can be<br>
continuously controlled within a wide range by varying<br>
the process pressure. Since the density of the<br>
supercritical gas, in a simplified consideration,<br><br>
correlates with its dissolving power, this gives the<br>
ideal prerequirements for carrying out selective<br>
extractions or separations. In the prior art, many<br>
processing examples are described in which the<br>
selectivity of extraction, in particular in the case of<br>
natural substances plays a critical role, which<br>
justifies the use of supercritical gases from economic<br>
aspects (Stahl et al., Verdichtete Gase zur Extraktion<br>
und Raffination [compressed gases for extraction and<br>
refining], Springer, Heidelberg, 1987).<br>
On account of the abovementioned properties, gases in<br>
the compressed state, however, can be used not only for<br>
selective extraction of substances, that is to say for<br>
separations, but also for impregnation, that is to say<br>
depositing what are termed "impregnation materials"<br>
onto a carrier matrix. Here, again, the very high<br>
diffusivity, owing to their low viscosity, of the<br>
supercritical gases, that is to say their ability to<br>
penetrate very readily into a "compact" and only poorly<br>
accessible matrix, plays an important role. An<br>
impregnation material can be deposited in a targeted<br>
manner in the carrier matrix via targeted control of<br>
the solution properties.<br>
In the prior art, for example, according to German<br>
patent DE 21 27 642, aroma substances are first<br>
extracted from tea and collected, the caffeine is<br>
thereupon removed from the tea and then the aroma<br>
substances are restored to the decaffeinated tea<br>
("restoration by impregnation"). The aroma substances<br>
are extracted here using dry carbon dioxide, while the<br>
caffeine is extracted using water as entrainer.<br>
Applying the aroma substances to the tea matrix is<br>
simple in processing terms, since the aroma substance<br>
fraction has a very high solubility in the carbon<br>
dioxide and the tea matrix is readily accessible. In<br>
addition, it is of no importance how "deep" the aroma<br>
substances penetrate into the matrix, since a fairly<br><br>
uniform distribution cm the individual particles of the<br>
tea is sufficient.<br>
There are, in the prior art, as described by the<br>
example above, methods using supercritical gases in<br>
which impregnation materials are deposited on a carrier<br>
matrix and, assuming an appropriate solubility of the<br>
impregnation material in the gas and relatively easy<br>
accessibility of the carrier matrix, can also be intro-<br>
duced into a carrier matrix. However,, if the solubility<br>
of the impregnation materials in the gas is low and the<br>
accessibility of the carrier matrix is restricted, for<br>
example due to adverse distribution coefficients of the<br>
impregnation materials between gas and carrier matrix,<br>
no satisfactory methods are available for being able to<br>
introduce the impregnation materials into the carrier<br>
matrix economically. Low solubility is taken to mean,<br>
in particular, if 30 to 100 parts (sparingly soluble),<br>
100 - 1000 parts (slightly soluble) or 1000 or more<br>
parts, in particular up to 10,000 parts (very slightly<br>
soluble) of the solvent are required to dissolve 1 part<br>
of impregnation material.<br>
An object of the present invention was thus to develop<br>
a method for impregnating a carrier matrix with solid<br>
and/or liquid compounds using compressed gases, in<br>
which the impregnation materials can be transported<br>
efficiently from the surface into the interior of the<br>
respective carrier matrix, in which case an application<br>
spectrum as broad as possible is to be covered.<br>
This object was achieved according to the invention by<br>
the means that the solid and/or liquid compound(s)<br>
(impregnation material) and the insoluble carrier<br>
matrix are brought into contact with a compressed gas<br>
(mixture) at gas densities of at least 0.15 to 1.3 kg/1<br>
under at least 2, preferably at least 3, more pref-<br>
erably at least 5, and particularly preferably at least<br>
10, unsymmetrical pressure change cycles (pulsations)<br><br>
in such a manner that, per individual pulsation of a<br>
period of at least 5 s to 60 min, preferably from at<br>
least 50 s to 20 min, particularly preferably of at<br>
least 100 s to 10 min, the respective time period to<br>
achieve the pressure maximum is greater than the time<br>
period of the pressure reduction to the minimum.<br>
This method thus exploits the differing solubility of<br>
the impregnation materials at different densities of<br>
the compressed gases in the near-critical region, in<br>
order to transport the impregnation material actively<br>
from the exterior into the interior of the carrier<br>
matrix. The near-critical region is generally defined<br>
by a reduced temperature of a compressed gas in the<br>
range from 0.9 to 1.5 and a reduced pressure in the<br>
range from 0.8 to 5, these said differential quantities<br>
each being the ratios of the working temperature and<br>
the working pressure to the critical temperature and<br>
the critical pressure, respectively.<br>
Surprisingly, by means of the inventive method and in<br>
particular the pulsations, it is possible to utilise<br>
kinetic dissolution effects in order to achieve active<br>
material transport of the impregnation materials into<br>
the carrier matrix from the exterior into the interior:<br>
when the pressure is increased in. the supercritical<br>
state, the density of the gas increases and thus also<br>
its dissolving power for the impregnation materials.<br>
Starting from a low gas density and proceeding towards<br>
a higher density, this leads to an influx of the gas<br>
into the carrier matrix, with the high diffusivity of<br>
the gas system in the supercritical state being a<br>
particular advantage. In addition, it has been found<br>
that, on account of the increasing gas density, the<br>
impregnation materials simultaneously are dissolved<br>
better in the gas and together with the influx of the<br>
gas are transported into the matrix. If adsorption and<br>
mass partition effects in the matrix are then excluded,<br>
when the gas density is reduced, that is a pressure<br><br>
reduction, the impregnation material would exit again<br>
from the matrix together with the gas efflux. However,<br>
surprisingly, this is essentially avoided by the time<br>
period for pressure reduction being shorter than the<br>
time . period for pressure increase. This is because<br>
during a short expansion time, the desired material<br>
irreversibly precipitates out in the matrix, while<br>
during the preceding slower pressure increase,<br>
sufficient time remains for the impregnation materials<br>
to dissolve in the gas(mixture) and be transported with<br>
it into the matrix. These effects could not be<br>
predicted in this clarity.<br>
The number of pressure pulsations, the time of the<br>
pulsation cycles and the pressure and density<br>
differences, respectively, generally depend on the<br>
impregnation material, the carrier matrix which is to<br>
be impregnated, the plant-specific preconditions, and<br>
the targeted extent to which the desired impregnation<br>
materials are to be distributed into/in the matrix.<br>
Inter alia, it is to be considered as essential to the<br>
invention that the time period to achieve the<br>
respective peak maximum (tt0 max) per pulsation is<br>
greater than the time period for the pressure reduction<br>
to the peak minimum (tt0 min) : tt0 max &gt; tto min. Depending<br>
on the size of the production plant, the duration of an<br>
individual pulsation is at least 5 s to 60 min,<br>
preferably at least 50 s to 20 min, particularly<br>
preferably at least 100 s to 10 min. It has proved to<br>
be expedient in terms of the process, if<br>
tto max » tto min/ where tto max is in particular 5 to 30<br>
times, preferably 9 to 25 times, greater than tt0 min<br>
since then back-transport of the impregnation materials<br>
from the carrier matrix can be most effectively<br>
suppressed. However, the minimum time period for<br>
pressure and density reduction, respectively, can also<br>
be limited by the fact that the carrier matrix becomes<br>
"unstable", that is to say is damaged, by the rapid<br><br>
density change, and, in particular, formally<br>
"collapses". However, the course of the process can be<br>
set empirically in such a manner that this damage to<br>
the matrix can be excluded.<br>
The present method can be used for producing a<br>
multiplicity of products and intermediates in which<br>
impregnation materials are introduced into a carrier<br>
matrix. Suitable representatives of impregnation<br>
materials have proved to be all biologically active<br>
compounds, such as pharmaceutical, agrochemical and<br>
cosmetic active compounds, technical substances, for<br>
example surface-active or surface-modifying<br>
compositions (hydrophobization or hydrophilization) or<br>
organometallic compounds. Compounds which are used in<br>
this context are, in particular, vitamins, nutra-<br>
ceuticals, plant-treatment compositions, insecticides,<br>
fungicides, herbicides (that is to say biocides in<br>
general), phytohormones, for example cytokinins, but<br>
also aroma substances, pigments and other impregnation<br>
materials which have another functionality, such as<br>
dispersants, emulsifiers or chemically reactive<br>
compounds, for example surface-reactive compounds. It<br>
is thus also possible in the context of the present<br>
invention that, after introducing the impregnation<br>
materials into the carrier matrix, a chemical reaction<br>
is induced in-situ in the process, for example by a<br>
temperature increase or feeding in reaction initiators,<br>
in order to achieve chemical bonding of the<br>
impregnation material on the carrier matrix.<br>
The sole precondition for suitability as an<br>
impregnation material is its ability to dissolve in the<br>
compressed gas(mixture).<br>
Preferred representatives of carrier matrices are all<br>
materials of biological origin, for example foods,<br>
feeds, seed material, and other organic and inorganic<br>
carrier matrices which preferably have large and/or<br><br>
poorly accessible internal surface areas. This also<br>
includes carrier matrices which increase their volume<br>
under the process conditions, which is generally<br>
achieved by swelling, and as a result of which the<br>
external surface areas and also their internal surface<br>
areas increase.<br>
In particular, compounds which are suitable are<br>
according to the invention synthetic, semi-synthetic<br>
and natural organic polymers, for example polyethylenes<br>
(PE), polypropylenes (PP) or polyglycolic acids (for<br>
example polylactic-glycolic acid, PLGA) or<br>
carbohydrates, for example starches and cyclodextrins,<br>
in addition inorganic carrier materials, in particular<br>
those having large internal surface areas, for example<br>
silicon dioxides, such as precipitated or pyrogenic<br>
silicic acids or silica gels, alumosilicates or other<br>
catalyst base materials, for example zeolites, and<br>
aluminium oxides, activated carbons, titanium dioxides,<br>
bentonites, which can all be used in chemically or<br>
physically modified form. The carrier matrices having<br>
an open or closed pore internal structure can be<br>
(pre)swollen, or can be extruded or foamed matrices.<br>
In practice, in the present method, a very large<br>
density range of the compressed, that is to say near-<br>
critical or supercritical, gases or gas mixtures can be<br>
utilised; it is in the limits essential to the<br>
invention of at least 0.15 to 1.3 kg/1, preferably from<br>
at least 0.4 to 1.0 kg/1, and particularly preferably<br>
from at least 0.5 to 0.9 kg/1. In order to be able to<br>
establish these densities by process engineering, the<br>
process pressures according to the invention vary from<br>
at least 5 to 800 bar, with pressure ranges from at<br>
least 30, in particular at least 50 to 500 bar, being<br>
preferred. The process temperature should preferably be<br>
above the critical temperature of the gas or gas<br>
mixture used, in particular at least 31°C to 200°C,<br><br>
preferably at least 40°C to 150°C, particularly<br>
preferably at least 50°C to 100°C.<br>
The choice of suitable gas or suitable gas mixtures<br>
also depends essentially on the impregnation material<br>
or the mixture of different impregnation materials<br>
which are being introduced into the carrier matrix.<br>
Fundamentally, therefore, gases/gas mixtures come into<br>
consideration whose critical state parameters are<br>
within industrially practicable limits. Inter alia the<br>
critical temperature of the gas system is particularly<br>
important, which, at excessive values, may cause<br>
thermal damage to both the impregnation materials and<br>
also the carrier matrix. Suitable gases for the present<br>
method have thus proved to be carbon dioxide, propane,<br>
butane, ethane, ethylene, dimethyl ether, ammonia,<br>
halogenated hydrocarbons, comprising fluorinated, chlo-<br>
rinated, brominated and iodated branched or unbranched<br>
hydrocarbons from C1 to C4, in particular partially or<br>
completely fluorinated hydrocarbons, or their mixtures.<br>
A precondition for being able to carry out the method<br>
of the invention is that the impregnation materials, in<br>
the pressure peak maximum, have partly a substantially<br>
higher solubility in the gas(mixture) than in the<br>
pressure trough minimum. In contrast, the impregnation<br>
matrix, that is to say the carrier matrix, under the<br>
given processing conditions, must be insoluble both in<br>
the near-critical and also in the supercritical state<br>
of the gas(mixture). The absolute pressure minimum is<br>
set in this case by the minimum dissolving power of the<br>
gas(mixture) for the impregnation material and the<br>
absolute pressure maximum is set by the maximum<br>
solubility of the impregnation materials in the<br>
compressed gas(mixture).<br>
The pressure range from the absolute pressure minimum<br>
to the absolute pressure maximum is the range in which<br><br>
operations can take place in principle, but which need<br>
not be exploited completely.<br>
Preferably, the pressure in the pressure maximum of a<br>
pulse, is 1.1 times, more preferably 1.3 times, still<br>
more preferably 1.5 times, still more preferably twice,<br>
most preferably 5 times, the pressure at the pressure<br>
minimum. In addition, it is preferred to set the<br>
pressure in the pressure maximum in such a manner that<br>
it is at least 1 bar, preferably at least 5 bar, more<br>
preferably at least 10 bar, and most preferably at<br>
least 20 bar, higher than the pressure in the pressure<br>
minimum. In this case the dissolving power of the<br>
gas(mixture) in the pressure maximum is preferably at<br>
least twice, preferably at least 10 times, better than<br>
the dissolving power of the gas(mixture) in the<br>
pressure minimum.<br>
In order to achieve the most effective mass transport<br>
of the impregnation materials from the surface into the<br>
interior of the carrier matrix, the density difference<br>
during the individual pulsation should be as large as<br>
possible. The most expedient practical lower limit of<br>
the density minimum then occurs when the gases or the<br>
gas mixtures no longer have any dissolving power for<br>
the impregnation materials. With respect to density,<br>
there is, for the method, in principle, no upper limit<br>
in the peak maximum. However, since the method is based<br>
on the principle of transport of the gas influx or gas<br>
efflux in the carrier matrix at different densities, it<br>
is in practice no longer expedient, and also generally<br>
uneconomic, to use more than 10 times the supercritical<br>
pressure of the corresponding gas or gas mixture, since<br>
the density then experiences markedly lower changes<br>
than in the near-critical state range of the gas<br>
system.<br>
With respect to the individual pulsations which always<br>
consist of the sum of the two time periods for pressure<br><br>
increase and pressure reduction, the invention<br>
envisages that their periods can differ from one<br>
another. That is to say the period of an individual<br>
pulsation can be shorter or also longer than the<br>
preceding and/or subsequent pulsation, an individual<br>
pulsation lasting from at . least 5 s to 60 min,<br>
preferably from at least 50 s to 20 min, particularly<br>
preferably from at least 100 s to 10 min.<br>
However, in certain method variants, it can also be<br>
necessary that the respective time periods within<br>
different individual pulsation periods differ from one<br>
another, which means nothing other than that the time<br>
periods for the pressure increase and/or the time<br>
periods for the pressure reduction differ from one<br>
another from individual pulsation to individual<br>
pulsation. However, it is important that even in these<br>
cases, per individual pulsation, the time period for<br>
the pressure increase is always greater than the time<br>
period for the pressure reduction. It is also possible<br>
to choose the pressure minima and/or pressure maxima<br>
differently in the individual pulses.<br>
However, liquid aids that improve in particular the<br>
solubility of the impregnation materials, can also be<br>
added to the near-critical gas or to the gas mixtures,<br>
particularly preferably at atmospheric pressure. Such<br>
suitable aids are, for example, water or organic<br>
solvents selected from the group consisting of short-<br>
chain alcohols, ketones and esters, branched or<br>
unbranched, having chain lengths from C1 to C10,<br>
preferably C1 to C8, particularly preferably from C2 to<br>
C3, and/or having surface activity, which can be used,<br>
typically, in concentrations up to 20% by weight,<br>
preferably from 1% by weight to 10% by weight,<br>
particularly preferably from 2% by weight to 5% by<br>
weight. However, in principle, entrainers can also be<br>
used, which, for example, set a suitable pH environment<br>
in the process gas. Those which are suitable, in<br><br>
particular, for this are organic amines, for example<br>
triethylamine or ammonia, which can additionally<br>
improve the solubility of the impregnation materials.<br>
In this case the aids and/or entrainers which are<br>
mentioned as preferred, but also all other suitable<br>
aids and/or entrainers, can also be added to the<br>
impregnation material, which again should preferably be<br>
performed at atmospheric pressure. Other substances<br>
which can be used not only as actual impregnation<br>
materials, but also as aids, are surface-active<br>
substances, since they themselves have good solubility<br>
in the supercritical gas(mixture) (what are termed<br>
"gasophilic surfactants"). Using the surfactants not<br>
only improves the solubility of certain impregnation<br>
materials in the gas(mixture), the surfactants acting<br>
in this case as aid, they also facilitate the<br>
penetration of the impregnation materials into the<br>
carrier matrix, since the diffusivity of the mass<br>
system impregnation materials/gas(mixture) is increased<br>
by a further reduction in surface tension. However, if<br>
the "gasophilic surfactants" are used as actual<br>
impregnation materials, the purpose of the impregnation<br>
process can be modification of the surface properties<br>
of the carrier matrix, for example the improvement or<br>
reduction of their water-wettability and the associated<br>
properties.<br>
Regarding the embodiment of the method in the context<br>
of the present invention, various variants are<br>
possible, since the inventive method is limited<br>
generally to the transport of the impregnation<br>
materials into the carrier matrix, and does not claim<br>
the manner in which the impregnation, materials are to<br>
be deposited on the surface of the carrier matrix.<br>
Typically, the method is carried out in an autoclave,<br>
and preferably in a discontinous batch process.<br><br>
In a special variant, a preliminary stage is provided<br>
for the inventive method, in which preliminary stage,<br>
after the autoclave is filled with the carrier matrix<br>
and the impregnation materials, the plant system is<br>
brought, by the suitable gas(mixture), to the corre-<br>
sponding pressure at which the impregnation materials<br>
exhibit the abovedescribed solubility behaviour. The<br>
gas or the gas mixture is then, in the supercritical<br>
state, circulated in such a manner that the impreg-<br>
nation materials are distributed on the carrier matrix<br>
and the concentration gradient of the active compounds<br>
in the bed of the carrier matrix achieves an acceptable<br>
minimum value. The process pressure, and thus the<br>
density of the gas system, is then reduced in such a<br>
manner that the impregnation materials settle (preci-<br>
pitate; are deposited) on the surfaces of the carrier<br>
matrix. Although, in this procedure, owing to the good<br>
diffusivity of the gas(mixtures) in the supercritical<br>
state, some of the active compounds can already pene-<br>
trate into the interior of the carrier matrix, but a<br>
significant proportion always remains on the surface of<br>
the carrier matrix, since this proportion of impreg-<br>
nation material separates there from the gas phase of<br>
the intergranular volume. Then, as described above, the<br>
actual pulsation that is essential to the invention is<br>
carried out, in order to achieve transport from the<br>
exterior to the interior of the carrier matrix.<br>
From practical, and especially economic, aspects, an<br>
alternative procedure can also be suitable, especially<br>
if the solubility of the impregnation materials, even<br>
in the supercritical state of the gas(mixture), is only<br>
low, and a long process time is required for recirc-<br>
ulating the gas or the gas mixture in the autoclave, to<br>
achieve the desired distribution in the carrier matrix<br>
packed bed, that is to say to minimise its concen-<br>
tration gradient in the packed bed. For these cases,<br>
the invention provides precoating the carrier matrix<br>
with the impregnating materials by means of conven-<br><br>
tional technology, such as, in particular, the known<br>
methods for spray coating, in particular in the<br>
fluidized bed, or else melt coating. In this case the<br>
impregnating materials are applied to the wall of the<br>
carrier matrix particles, without the impregnating<br>
materials being able to penetrate, at any rate<br>
essentially, into the internal region of the matrix<br>
particles. The material thus prepared is then also<br>
subjected to the pulsation process essential to the<br>
invention for impregnation, as a result of which the<br>
impregnation materials are only then transported into<br>
the interior of the carrier matrix. This procedure can<br>
have enormous economic advantages, since the actual<br>
transport path which must be overcome by the<br>
impregnating material that is dissolved in the<br>
gas (mixture) is very short, that is to say only from<br>
the surface of the matrix particles into their<br>
interior. In addition, via this procedure, the<br>
individual loading of the matrix particles with<br>
impregnating material can be controlled and ensured<br>
markedly better.<br>
The present method thus has great potential,<br>
especially, for introducing pharmaceutical active<br>
compounds into a suitable carrier matrix having a large<br>
internal surface area, as required in the production of<br>
preparations having delayed release of active compound.<br>
A further application example is impregnating or<br>
disinfecting seed material, the critical advantage of<br>
the inventive process being that the plant treatment<br>
composition does not, as hitherto in the prior art,<br>
remain solely in the outer regions of the seed grain,<br>
but can be introduced into the internal region of the<br>
seed body. For certain applications, this can lead to<br>
an improved effect with simultaneously lower dosages.<br>
Finally, the impregnating materials used can also be<br>
organometallic substances which are to be introduced<br><br>
into a matrix, as is customary in particular in the<br>
production of supported catalysts.<br>
In addition to the inventive method with its preferred<br>
variants, the present invention also relates to all<br>
impregnated substances produced using this method.<br>
The examples below are intended to illustrate the<br>
advantages of the inventive method and the substances<br>
produced therewith.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1: Impregnation of a compact plant material<br>
(rice grains) with lipophilic impreg-<br>
nating materials (ß-carotene as marker<br>
substance)<br>
1.1 Unsymmetrical pulsation cycles (invention):<br>
100 ml of a vegetable oil which contained approximately<br>
3% by weight of p-carotene (impregnation material) was<br>
sprayed, using a fine nozzle, onto 2 kg of commercial<br>
husked rice grains as carrier matrix (bulk density<br>
approximately 0.6 kg/1) at room temperature in an<br>
agitating drum, while the drum charge was mixed<br>
thoroughly for approximately 30 minutes. This achieved<br>
a uniform application of the coloured oil onto the<br>
surface of the rice grains. Study of the cross section<br>
of a single grain by light microscopy showed that only<br>
the edge region of the cross-sectional area had red<br>
staining due to the pigment. The starting material thus<br>
pretreated was then introduced into an insert vessel<br>
(volume 3.5 1) that was closed at the top and bottom<br>
with metal sinter plates. The insert vessel which was<br>
completely filled with rice grains was inserted into<br>
the pressure autoclave of a high-pressure extraction<br>
system. The autoclave was first brought at 50°C (set by<br>
means of jacket heating) to a pressure of 150 bar<br><br>
(pressure minimum) with carbon dioxide. The pressure<br>
was then slowly increased to 500 bar over a period of<br>
5 min, using a high-pressure pump (pressure maximum)<br>
and then rapidly reduced back to 100 bar in the course<br>
of 15 s via a pressure control valve. This pulsation<br>
operation was repeated in the same manner 20 times.<br>
After expanding the system to atmospheric pressure, the<br>
rice grains were taken out and the result of<br>
impregnation was compared with the starting material.<br>
The red-stained pigment zone had disappeared from the<br>
edge regions and in the light microscope, an even<br>
staining of the starch body over the entire cross<br>
section of the rice grain with p-carotene was observed.<br>
1 .2 Symmetrical pulsation cycles (comparison):<br>
Rice grains were pretreated in a similar manner to<br>
Example 1.1, the actual impregnation being carried out<br>
symmetrically in the same pressure range with 20<br>
pulsations, that is to say the time for the pressure<br>
rise to the maximum was identical to the time for<br>
pressure reduction to the minimum, that is to say in<br>
each case 2.5 min.<br>
Study by light microscopy of the cross section of a<br>
rice grain thus treated showed only an unclear and<br>
washed out pigment zone in the edge region, but the<br>
pigment p-carotene was not distributed over the entire<br>
cross-sectional area of the grain.<br>
Example 2: Impregnation of a porous inorganic<br>
carrier matrix (Endobon®) with a pharma-<br>
ceutical active compound (ketoprofen)<br>
5 g of ketoprofen were dissolved in 150 ml of methanol<br>
and the solution, together with 15 g of Endobon®<br>
(Merck; porous hydroxyapatite granules; 0 2.8 to<br>
5.6 mm), was transferred to a round-bottomed flask. The<br><br>
solvent was removed under reduced pressure on a rotary<br>
evaporator with agitation.<br>
The starting material thus pretreated was introduced<br>
into an insert vessel (volume 0.5 1) which was sealed<br>
at the top and bottom with metal sinter plates. The<br>
insert vessel was inserted into the pressure autoclave<br>
of a high-pressure extraction system. The autoclave was<br>
first, at 50°C (set using jacket heating), brought to a<br>
pressure of 100 bar (pressure minimum) with carbon<br>
dioxide which contained 1% by weight of methanol as<br>
entrainer. The pressure was then slowly increased to<br>
250 bar (pressure maximum) over a period of 3 min,<br>
using a high-pressure pump, and then rapidly reduced to<br>
100 bar via a pressure control valve in the course of<br>
20 s. This pulsation operation was repeated 10 times in<br>
the same manner. After expanding the system to<br>
atmospheric pressure, the impregnated carrier matrix<br>
was removed.<br>
For characterization, the release rate of ketoprofen on<br>
the carrier matrix was determined in a dissolution test<br>
and compared with a starting material that had not been<br>
subjected to the pulsation impregnation, and with a<br>
sample which had been treated with symmetrical<br>
pulsation cycles (1.5 min in each case for pressure<br>
rise and decrease) . The sample from Example 2<br>
(invention) showed the longest release curve, followed<br>
by the symmetrically treated pulsation material<br>
(comparison); the shortest release curve was shown by<br>
the precoated starting material that had not been<br>
subjected to a pressure treatment.<br>
The experimental result makes clear, by the example of<br>
ketoprofen, that release is slowest (sustained release)<br>
from the internal surfaces, and that using the<br>
inventive process the active transport into the<br>
internal surface of the carrier matrix can be carried<br>
out most effectively.<br><br>
Example 3: Impregnation of a porous organic carrier<br>
polymer (Accurel®) with a silicone oil<br>
20 g of Accurel® granules (Akzo; high-porosity<br>
polypropylene) were introduced into an insert vessel<br>
(volume 0.5 1) which was closed at the top and bottom<br>
with metal sinter plates. The insert vessel was<br>
inserted into the pressure autoclave of the high-<br>
pressure extraction system. The autoclave was first, at<br>
96°C (set by means of jacket heating), brought to a<br>
pressure of 100 bar with propane. 10 g of silicone oil<br>
(dimethylpolysiloxane having a viscosity of<br>
10,000 mPas) were then pumped in upstream of the<br>
autoclave and recirculated together with 1 kg of<br>
propane isothermically and isobarically, in order to<br>
achieve uniform distribution of the silicone oil in the<br>
packed bed of the Accurel carrier matrix. The pressure<br>
was then reduced to 43 bar, which decreased the<br>
solubility of the silicone oil in the propane.<br>
In 8 pulsation cycles the pressure was then increased<br>
from 43 bar (pressure minimum) to 70 bar (pressure<br>
maximum) (time for pressure rise: 2 min) and decreased<br>
(time for pressure drop: 5 s). The system was then<br>
brought to atmospheric pressure and the result of<br>
impregnation was evaluated.<br>
In contrast to Accurel samples that had been removed<br>
from the autoclave before the inventive pulsation and<br>
on which surfaces silicone oil was clearly adherent,<br>
the silicone oil in the samples impregnated according<br>
to Example 3 had virtually completely disappeared from<br>
the surface of the polypropylene matrix and migrated<br>
into the interior of the polymeric carrier. The result<br>
was markedly worse when, for comparison, symmetrical<br>
pulsation cycles were carried out in a similar pressure<br>
range (1 min in each case for the pressure rise and<br>
drop).<br><br>
The invention thus relates in particular to a method of<br>
impregnating a carrier matrix with solid and/or liquid<br>
compounds using compressed gases which is essentially<br>
characterized in that the solid and/or liquid<br>
compound(s) (impregnating material) and the insoluble<br>
carrier matrix are brought into contact with a<br>
compressed gas(mixture) at gas densities between 0.15<br>
and 1.3 kg/1 under at least two unsymmetrically<br>
preceding pressure-change cycles (pulsations) in such a<br>
manner that, per individual pulsation of a duration<br>
between 5 s and 60 min, the respective time period to<br>
achieve the pressure maximum is greater than the time<br>
period for pressure reduction to the minimum, the<br>
absolute pressure minimum being established by the<br>
minimum dissolving power of the gas(mixture) for the<br>
impregnating material and the absolute pressure maximum<br>
being established by the maximum solubility of the<br>
impregnating materials in the compressed gas(mixture).<br>
The method is distinguished in that not only a<br>
multiplicity of impregnation materials, for example<br>
biologically active compounds, industrial substances or<br>
organometallic compounds, can be used but also carrier<br>
matrices of biological origin and organic or inorganic<br>
substances, which all have large and/or poorly<br>
accessible internal surface areas. By means of this<br>
method, which is preferably carried out using<br>
compressed carbon dioxide, propane, butane, ethane or<br>
ammonia, not only can untreated carrier material be<br>
handled but also already precoated material. As a<br>
result, impregnated materials are obtained whose<br>
internal surfaces are substantially homogeneously<br>
coated with the impregnation materials and which can be<br>
used, especially, in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical,<br>
cosmetic and technical sectors.<br><br>
