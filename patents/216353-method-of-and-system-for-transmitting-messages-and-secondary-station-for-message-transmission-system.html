				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method of, and system for,<br>
transmitting messages and also to a primary station and a secondary station<br>
for use in the system. An example of such a system is an answer back paging<br>
system and for convenience reference will be made to an answer back paging<br>
system but it is to be understood that the teachings of the present invention<br>
can be applied to other 2-way messaging systems.<br>
Background Art<br>
Answer back paging systems have been disclosed for example in<br>
WO96/14716. In an elementary form such a system requires a paging network<br>
controller (PNC) to arrange for a message to be transmitted to a predetermined<br><br>
addressee. The addressee on receiving a call is able to transmit a simple reply<br>
by way of a low power transmitter incorporated into the pager. The above<br>
mentioned Patent Specification discloses a system in which a series of<br>
messages are transmitted to respective addressees and the PNC? then<br>
transmits invitations for the addressees to transmit their replies substantially<br>
simultaneously as pseudo random data sequences which are de-spread at the<br>
PNC and the replies forwarded to the respective party requiring the reply. In<br>
order to avoid having to apply power control techniques in the pagers to ensure<br>
that replies are received by the PNC at comparable power levels, the PNC<br>
transmits its invitations at stepwise increasing (or decreasing) power levels and<br>
only those pagers just able to receive a respective one of the invitations<br>
transmit their replies A feature of this known method is that relatively striot<br>
control of the received power is necessary.<br>
PCT Patent Application IB97/00492 discloses a variant of the above<br>
mentioned method which for convenience of description will be referred to as<br>
progressive elimination. In this technique the PNC transmits a series of<br>
messages on a downlink to individually addressed pagers The PNC then<br>
transmits a control signal on the down-link inviting those pagers wishing to<br>
make an up-link transmission, for example a reply to a message, request for<br>
service or a registration request, to transmit them substantially simultaneously<br>
as pseudo-random data sequences. The PNC analyses those of the up-link<br>
transmissions which are intelligible and then repeats the invitation which<br>
includes acknowledgements of those up-link transmissions that have been<br>
analysed successfully, consequently only those pagers who had responded the<br>
first time but had not received an acknowledgement need retry.<br>
Essentially these known techniques require each pager to store a<br>
number of pseudo-random data sequences, each one specific to a particular<br>
type of response. However this leads to some inflexibility when processing<br>
group messages, responding individually to several stored messages and<br>
fragmented messages.<br>

operation of answer back massaging systems.<br>

data sequences, the pseudo random,data sequence being used by a secondary<br>
station being dependent on at least the address assigned to the secondary<br>
station and/or information contained in the message.<br>

data sequences, the pseudo-random data sequence being generated by a<br>
secondary station at any one time being dependent on at least the address<br>
assigned to the secondary station and/or information contained in the message.<br>

Modes for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Referring to Figure 1. the message transmission system comprises a<br>
paging network controller (PNC) 10 having a message entry port 12 Which<br>
receives pager addresses and associated messages from an operator equipped<br>
with a personal computer (PC) or direct!, from a subscriber having a PC and<br>
a modem. The PNC 10, which comprises directories containing information<br>
such as pager radio identity codes (RICs), areas to be paged, frequencies,<br>
pager types, prevailing protocols, for example POCSAG {(or CCIR Radiopaging<br>
Code No 1) and ERMES, and status of the pagers, assembles the messages<br>
and their associated RICs together with other relevant information into data<br>
packets which are forwarded to a paging area controller (PAC) 14 which<br>
formats the RICs and associated messages into a format which can be<br>
transmitted by base statidn transmitters (or transmitter section of a base station<br>
transceiver) 16 to two-way pagers 18,20 respectively, by way of a down-link.<br>
If a two-way pager 20 identifies that a message is being transmitted<br>
having its RIC, it receives the message and decodes it. If the user wishes to<br>
send a brief response then, by means of an integral key pad, he selects a pre-<br>
stored response and when invited by the PAC 16 it transmits its response by<br>
way of an up-link. The response signals may be sent simultaneously as<br>
pseudo-random data sequences (PROS).<br>
One or more receivers (or receiver sections of a transceiver) 22 are<br>
provided for receiving the responses and for relaying them to the PAC 14 in<br>
which they are decoded and sent as data packets to the PNC 10. The PNC 10<br>
comprises means for analysing the signals and for matching the responses with<br>
the messages transmitted on the down-link.<br>
Those responses which are matched are relayed to the respective users<br>
in any suitable form, for example by e-mail or by transmission as one-way<br>
paging messages. Alternatively the responses are sent to a message<br>
answering service operated by the paging network. In" either case an<br>
acknowledgement is sent to the respective 2-way pager 20. However, not all <br>
the responses are matched because for example strong responses smother the<br>
weak responses as a result of the near-far effect. If the PNC 10 determines<br>
that only a small proportion of the messages transmitted on the down-link have<br>
received responses then it issues a general invitation to those pagers which<br>
have not responded to the message: or have not received an<br>
acknowledgement, to transmit or re-transmit their responses on the up-link.<br>
The newly received responses are analysed, matched where possible and<br>
acknowledgements are transmitted. If it is determined that the total number of<br>
successful responses is still below a statistically determined threshold level, the<br>
cycle is repeated by transmitting another invitation signal on the down-link. The<br>
process is repeated until either a predetermined number of cycles have elapsed<br>
or the threshold level has been exceeded and it is evident that no more<br>
intelligible responses to the batch of messages are recoverable.<br>
In the case of substantially simultaneously transmitted PRDS response<br>
signals, each time a batch of response signals is received, those response<br>
signals which are analysed successfully will generally have the greatest power<br>
levels at the antenna of the receiver 22. Thus as they will be eliminated from<br>
the pool of response signals, then when the next invitation signal is transmitted,<br>
signals from weaker sources, that is, the more distant pagers, will be decoded<br>
and matched. This sequence of operations is referred to herein as Progressive<br>
Elimination.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates an example of a system in which response s comprise<br>
PRDS signals which are transmitted simultaneously in response to an invitation<br>
signal on the down-link. In Figure 2 messages (not shown) already have been<br><br>
transmitted on the down-link. A first inVitation INV1 is transmitted on the down-<br>
link The pagers which have detected a message addressed to them resppnd<br>
to the invitation signal INV1 by transmitting a code sequence within a defined<br>
time slot RES1. A search routine SCH is initiated following expiry of the time<br>
slot. in the search routine, codes stored in the PNC 10 (Figure 1) are<br>
successively compared with the response data sequences and one by one the<br>
responses to particular ones of the messages are identified. However, due to<br>
the near/far problem only the strongest of the response signals are detected<br>
and these are eliminated from the next search by acknowledgement signals<br>
being transmitted on a down-link to inform those pagers which, have been<br>
successful not to the respond to the subsequent invitation signals INV2 and<br>
INV3 in the sequence.<br>
It is anticipated that in a practical system the majority of the pagers 18,<br>
 "<br>
20 (Figure 1) will be some distance from the antenna(s) of the receiver(s) 22<br>
which means that they will have a low power at the antenna. Accordingly,<br>
although the durations of the time slots RES1, RES2 and RES3 may be equal,<br>
as shown, it is preferable that variable slot lengths be allocated according to<br>
the anticipated number of responses, for example a low number of relatively<br>
high powered responses and a high number of relatively low powered<br>
responses. Short slots are allocated initially so that the few, strong powers<br>
contending against low n"oise and interference can be eliminated efficiently.<br>
Longer slots are then allocated to accommodate the weak received powers<br>
contending against significant levels of noise and interference.<br>
If desired the pagers 18, 20 may have power control on their<br>
transmitters in order to vary the strength of their response signals and in sp<br>
doing reduce the number of invitation/response cycles.<br>
In a refinement of the embodiment, described with reference to Figure 2,<br>
Figure 3 shows dividing the population of the pagers into two groups and<br>
interleaving the transmission of messages and invitations for one group Gp i<br>
on the down-link with analysing the responses on the up-link from the other<br>
group Gp2.<br>
 One method of dividing the pager population is to assign the odd<br>
numbered pagers to one group, say Gpi, and the even numbered pagers to a<br>
second group, say Gp2. An alternative method is for the pagers to measure<br>
the strength (RSSI) of the received down-link signal and by using a pre-set<br>
threshold determine to which one of say two groups they belong.<br>
One method of issuing an invitation message whilst simultaneously<br>
informing those pagers whose responses have been analysed successfully is<br>
to send the messages M1 to 114 in an ordered sequence as shown in Figure<br>
4A and in the invitation signal, Figure 4B, providing a field FD with a<br>
corresponding number of time slots on a 1 to 1 basis, thus slot 3 corresponds<br>
to message M3. When the first invitation signal INV1 is transmitted, say all the<br>
bits in the field FD are zero indicating that no responses have been received.<br>
However, after the first round of analyses, acknowledgements are transmitted<br>
to say the pagers to which the messages M1, M3, M4, M9, M11 and M13 were<br>
addressed by changing the bits in slots 1 3, 4, 9, 11 and 13 of the field FD<br>
from "0" to "1". Further bits are changed as more of the messages are<br>
acknowledged.<br>
The number of cycles in which invitations are transmitted may be fixed.<br>
However, if it is determined that the number of successfully decoded responses<br>
exceeds a statistically determined threshold value, then further iterations are<br>
stopped.<br>
Figure 5 shows in block schematic form a PNC 10 coupled to a PAC 14<br>
and a base station transmitter 16 and a receiver 22. The entry port 12 is<br>
coupled to a microcontroller 24 to which are connected directories 26 to 36<br>
relating respectively to RICs, paging areas, frequencies, pager types, prevailing<br>
protocols and status. A message store 38 is coupled to the microcontroller 24<br>
for storing messages as they are received at the entry port 12. The store 38<br>
has an area 40 for storing indications confirming that a response to a<br>
respective message has been received and acknowledged. An output 42 from<br>
the microcontroller 24 is coupled to the PAC 14 to supply data packets to be<br>
formatted prior to being transmitted by the transmitter 16.<br>
Responses received by the receiver 22 are relayed to a signal analyser<br>
44 by way of the PAC 14. As each response is analysed successfully, it is<br>
forwarded to the microcontroller 24 for matching with the messages in the store<br>
38. Once matched, the microcontroller arranges for an acknowledgement to<br>
be transmitted when sending the next invitation signal on the down-link. At the<br>
appropriate moment the recipients of the responses are informed, for example<br>
by e-mail or a one-way paging message, or the responses are stored together<br>
with the respective pager number so that a subscriber can interrogate the store<br>
at his or her convenience. Once the microcontroller 24 has decided that for all<br>
practical purposes all the responses have been received, it erases the<br>
messages in message store 38 in readiness for receiving more messages by<br>
way of the entry port 12. More conveniently the store 33 can comprise two<br>
halves with one half handling the acknowledgements of the messages already<br>
sent on the down-link and the other half storing messages to be sent.<br>
Figure 6 is a flow chart showing the sequence of operations involved in<br>
transmitting messages, receiving responses and acknowledging responses<br>
 Block 50 represents start. Block 52 relates to the transmission of a sequence<br>
of messages and this is followed in block 54 by the transmission of an invitation<br>
signal. Block 56 relates to the reception of the PRDS responses which are<br>
then analysed and matched with their respective messages, block 58. Block<br>
60 relates to the transmission of the acknowledgements.. In block 62 a check<br>
is made to see if the number of successful responses exceeds a threshold<br>
value indicating that as many as possible responses have been received; If the<br>
answer is No(N) the flow chart proceeds to block 64 in which a check is made<br>
to see if the predetermined maximum number of invitations has been exceeded.<br>
If the answer is No(N) the flow chart reverts to the block 54. A Yes(Y) answer<br>
from the blocks 62 and 64 causes the flow chart to revert to the block 52 and<br>
the cycle is repeated.<br>
Referring to Figure 7, the pager 20 comprises a receiver 68 connected<br>
to a decoder 70 which in turn is coupled to a control processor 72. The<br>
processor 72 operates in accordance with a program stored in a read-only<br>
memory 74. The processor also includes an address stjore (not shown) which<br>
contains the unique addresses of that pager. In the event of the pager<br>
receiving a message then this is stored in a random access memory 76. The<br>
messages can be displayed subsequently on a LCD panel 80 which has its<br>
associated driver 78 coupled to the control processor 72. Annunciating devices<br>
which may comprise an acoustic transducer 82, a light emitting transducer 84<br>
and a vibrator 86 are coupled to the control processor 72. A keypad 86<br>
provides a man machine interface whereby a user can instruct the processor<br>
to carry out various functions, for example to display a stored message on the<br>
panel 80 A transmitter 90 is coupled to an output of the processor 72 and to<br>
an antenna 92. A receiver power control stage 94 is coupled between the<br>
processor 72 and the receiver 68 in order to practice battery conservation in<br>
accordance with the provisions of the paging protocol being followed. In the<br>
event of the pager sending response signals as PRDS signals then the control<br>
processor 72 comprises means for determining the sequence to be transmitted<br>
having regard the identity of the pager and/or information in the original down-<br>
link message The PRDS is then relayed to the transmitter 90 for onward<br>
transmission. If as an option power control is to be applied to the transmitter<br>
90 then a power control signal is supplied by the processor 72 through a<br>
control line 96.<br>
Further the signals transmitted on the up-link may also comprise<br>
requests for services, such as registration, and accordingly the present<br>
invention is equally applicable to processing such requests for services in the<br>
same way as a response with the exception there will be no match with an<br>
outgoing message.<br>
The method of determining the up-link PRDS enables a greater flexibility<br>
to be obtained when responding to down-link messages. Referring to Figure<br>
8 a response PRDS is generated using two 12-tap linear feedback shift<br>
registers 100, 102 and one 6-tap linear feedback shift register 104, the outputs<br>
of which are coupled to an exclusive - OR (XOR) gate 106 Each shift register<br>
comprises an n bit XOR mask 108, 110, 112 and an n-bit shift register 114,<br>
116, 118, where n = 12 for sequence generators 100, 102 and n = 6 for<br>
sequence generator 104. All the sequence generators 100, 102, 104 are<br>
clocked together.<br>
Figure 9 illustrates an example of a n-bit sequence generator which is<br>
known per se and accordingly will not be described in detail.<br>
In the present example, the default parameters ha, hb and hc of the<br>
masks 108, 112 and 110, respectively, are 829h, 30h and B64h, respectively,<br>
and those of the shift registers 114, 118 and 116, viz a, b and c are 001h,<br>
([X]DIV2N)DIV212, and ([X]DIV2N)MOD212, where the subscript "h" represents<br>
hexadecimal, [X] refers in the POCSAG Standard to the 21 bit address and<br>
frame of the pager"s RIC and [N] is an operator defined constant betvtfeen 3<br>
and 7 inclusive. The default, phase is determined by (212DIV2N)x([X]MOD2N).<br>
In the following description the following parameters along with their default<br>
values are required by the pager.<br>
They are explained in more detail in the subsequent description:<br>
Phase Step: 8<br>
Transmit: Enabled<br>
Prior to transmission, pagers are required to initialise the sequence<br>
generator to the given phase. Note that phase zero of a sequence corresponds<br>
to the register as initially loaded. Phase n is achieved by clocking the registers<br>
n times. If directed, pagers may use different parameters.<br>
Note that parameters "ha", "hb", and "hc" define the PIN. family. AII pagers<br>
in a given system shall use the same family. Parameters "b" and "c" define the<br>
code sequence. An Answerback Code refers to both the Sequence and the<br>
Phase.<br>
When transmission is required the sequence generator is clocked to<br>
generate the chip sequence. The point in time where clocking is required to<br>
start shall be in accordance with the following rules:<br>
i. Pagers only respond after receipt of an Invitation Control<br>
Sequence ICS<br>
ii. The transmit sequence shall start at the point where the<br>
beginning of tne second synchronisation codeword following the<br>
end of the invitation message is due.<br>
Examples of this are shown in Figure 10.<br>
iii. The first bit of the transmit sequence shall commence as the first<br>
bit of the synchronisation codeword begins as shown in Figure<br>
11. Tolerance for this shall be + 100 microseconds.<br>
iv. Transmission length is determined by the Invitation Command<br>
Sequence. Registers are clocked L time? where L is specified<br>
by the [Length] parameter in the Invitation Control Sequence.<br>
v. The chip rate of the code sequence shall be 9600 chips per<br>
second with a tolerance of 10 ppm.<br>
Prior to modulation, the chip sequence generated shall be filtered such<br>
that the total interference in the adjacent 25 kHz channel is -50 dBc.<br>
In the following, two way command sequences will be described.<br>
The basic principles are as follows:<br>
Pagers only transmit in response to an invitation sent by the paging PNC<br>
system. More than one pager may transmit at a time as each pager<br>
uses a different sequence. Pagers do not need to be pre-programmed<br>
with special return channel RICs or other information.<br>
Pagers use Control Sequences that are embedded in POCSAG (or CCIR<br>
Radiopaging Code No. 1) messages to determine how to respond and<br>
when. Control Sequences are sent as part of a normal text message to<br>
the user, and some can be sent on their own as a special pager<br>
message.<br>
Characters are defined in one of two ways as follows:<br> ASCII character in hexadecimal format. The valid range is<br>
from  to .<br>
"Character": ASCII character as displayed.<br>
For example "A" and  define the same character. Note that in<br>
accordance with the POCSAG standard, the least significant bit or each<br>
character is transmitted first.<br>
Control Characters are any character from  to  inclusive and<br>. Printable characters are any other character.<br>
Table 1 summarises the Control Sequences and these commands are<br>
defined in detail subsequently. Control sequences leceived incorrectly, or<br>
sequences incorrectly structured must be ignored by the pager.<br>
Note that cf these sequences only three (the invitation, the response<br>
allocation, and the fast invitation control sequences) are essential for efficient<br>
two-way communication. All other control sequences provide various<br>
enhancements. For operators who wish to implement automatic<br>
Acknowledgements only, only the fast in station control sequence is required.<br>
The Invitation Control Sequence ICS defines how a pager should<br>
respond. The ICS can be sent to an individual pager, or to a group of pagers.<br>
The ICS is used in conjunction with the Response Allocation Control Sequence<br>
RACS.<br>
A Fast Invitation Control Sequence FICS may be sent instead of a<br>
RACS/ICS pair.<br>
Pagers send a response immediately.<br>
The Invitation Control Sequence ICS defines for the pager the following:<br>
The type of answers that are permitted.<br>
A reference parameter.<br>
A slot number which is used when implementing the Progressive<br>
Elimination technique described previously.<br>
The following are optional parameters:<br>
The length of time pagers are to transmit.<br>
A time stamp.<br>
Some recognition bits. When Progressive Elimination is used pagers use<br>
these bits to determine if their transmission was received, and if re-transmission<br>
is required.<br>
The Invitation Control Sequence ICS has the following format:<br> "I" [Type][ReflCS][Slot]{[Length]}{[Time]}{[REC]}<br>
where:<br>
[Type] Defines what type of Answerback responses are permitted<br>
from pagers, and which optional parameters are to be<br>
used. [Type] can be a value between  and <br>
inclusive. It shall be interpreted as a 6 bit number as<br>
follows:<br>
If bit 5 is set: Solicited Response Invitation<br>
bit 0 Acknowledgements. If this (least significant)<br>
bit is set, the pager may send an<br>
acknowledgement response<br>
bit 1 Displayed responses. If this bit is set, the<br>
pager may send a displayed response.<br>
bit 2 User answer ready response to a specific<br>
message. If this bit is set, the pager may<br>
send a specific user answer ready response<br>
bit 3 User answer ready response to any message.<br>
If this bit is set, the pager may send a general<br>
user answer ready response.<br>
bit 4 User answer responses. If this bit is set, the<br>
pager may send actual answers to a<br>
message.<br>
If bit 5 is clear. Unsolicited Response Invitation<br>
bits 0 to 4 Unsoljcited Response Number (URN), where<br>
bits 0 to 4 define a 5 bit number between 0<br>
and 31 inclusive.<br>
Solicited and unsolicited responses are described later.<br>
[ReflCSJ Defines a unique identity to the invitation. [ReflCS] is a<br>
single character that may have one of 95 values between<br> and  inclusive. This enables pagers to keep<br>
track of series and related Invitation Control Sequences<br>
ICSs. <br>
Pagers may only transmit Acknowledgements to, a<br>
message when [ReflCS] matches [RefRACS] in |the RACS.<br>
For other types of responses to a message, a time-limit is<br>
specified in the [Time] parameter in the Response<br>
Allocation Control Sequence RACS.<br>
[Slot] This is used to implement Progressive Elimination, and<br>
defines the Invitation Control Sequences ICSs of the<br>
series. [Slot] is a single character between 30h and 3Fh<br>
inclusive. Its value is determined from the least significant<br>
4 bits. If Progressive Elimination is not to be used, then; it<br><br>
always contains 0 ().<br>
{[Length]} A parameter that is not present if [Type] is . Defines<br>
the number of times the sequence generator in the pager<br>
should be clocked, L, as follows:<br>
bit 4 and bit 5 set: L = 2N, where N is a number<br>
between 0 and 15 inclusive<br>
defined by bits 0 to 3.<br>
bit 4 clear, bit 5 set: L = 3x2N.<br>
bit 4 set, bit 5 clear: L = 5x2N.<br>
bit 4 and bit 5 clear: L = 75x2N.<br>
{[Time]} A parameter that is not present if [Type] is  or .<br>
It contains 3 characters with the following format: dhm; d<br>
has one of 31 day values from 1 to 31: h has one of 24<br>
hour values from 0 to 23; m has one of 60 minute values<br>
from 0 to 59; In all cases these values are determined<br>
from the least significant 6 bits of the character sent, where<br>
characters between  and  are used.<br>
It defines the current time.<br>
Alternatively if [Time] is "i" () pagers use their own<br>
internal clock to determine the present time.<br>
{[REC]} This parameter is not present if [Slot] is 0 (). It<br>
contains recognition bits that inform pagers that responses<br>
were received by the paging system. The use of this<br>
parameter is described later<br>
This command must terminate the message.<br>
The Response Allocation Code Sequence RACS is always sent<br>
embedded in a message, and defines a message as requiring a response. It<br>
may be sent to a single pager or to a group of pagers. Note that pagers do not<br>
transmit a response until an ICS has been received.<br>
The definition of the ICS and RACS as separate control sequences<br>
ensure that if required, a number of pagers transmit their responses at the<br>
same time.<br>
The RACS defines for the pager the following:<br>
A Type parameter. It restricts the type of responses permitted for the<br>
message, and defines which optional parameters are to be used.<br>
The following are optional parameters:<br>
A Reference parameter. This is used in conjunction with the reference<br>
parameter in the ICS.<br>
A time stamp to limit non-Acknowledgement responses.<br>
The Allocated Response Bit ARB to be used for the current message.<br>
This is used to implement Progressive Elimination, and is used in<br>
conjunction with the [REC] parameter in the ICS to enable a pager to<br>
determine if a response is required or if a previous response was<br>
received.<br>
A time stamp for the ARB.<br>
An Answerback Code to use for the message.<br>
The Response Allocation Code Sequence RACS has the following<br>
format: <br>"T"[Type]{[RefRACS]}{[Tirne]}{[ARB]}{[TimeARB]}{[Code]}<br>
[Type] Restricts pagers to provide only a subset of responses to<br>
the message. [Type] is one character that may have a<br>
value between  and  inclusive. It spall be<br>
interpreted as a 6 bit number as follows:<br>
bit 0 Acknowledgements. If this (least significant)<br>
bit is set, the pager may send an ACK<br>
response to this message.<br>
bit 1 Displayed responses. If this bit is set, the<br>
pager may send a DISP response to this<br>
message.<br>
bit 2 User answer ready response to a specific<br>
message. If this bit is set, the pager may<br>
send ANR, FLG or ANSn responses to this<br>
message.<br>
bit 3 Allocating REC Bit. If set, [ARB] is included in<br>
the RACS.<br>
bit 4 Separate time-out for ARB. If set, [TimeARB]<br>
is included in the RACS. It may only be set if<br>
bit 3 is set.<br>
bit 5 Code present If set [Code] is included in the<br>
RACS.<br>
{[RefRACS]} A parameter that is only present if bit 0 of [Type] is set. It<br>
defines a unique identity for the response. It is a single<br>
character that may have one of 95 values between <br>
and  inclusive.<br>
Pagers may only transmit Acknowledgements to a<br>
message when [RefRACS] matches [ReflCS] in the ICS.<br>
For other types of responses to a message, the time-limit<br>
specified in the [Time] parameter is used.<br>
{[Time]} A parameter that sets a time-limit for pager transmissions<br>
that are not Acknowledgements. This parameter is not<br>
present if both bits 1 and 2 of the [Type] parameter are<br>
clear.<br>
Responses cannot be sent to messages outside this time-<br>
limit. The time limit is specified in one of two ways - by<br>
use of a time stamp, or by use of the pagers internal clock.<br>
If a time stamp is used, [Time] is identical in format to the<br>
ICS [Time] parameter. Its contents are the current time,<br>
plus the required invitation window. Responses can only<br>
be made to messages when the ICS [Time] parameter is<br>
less than that in [Time].<br>
If the pager"s internal clock is to be used then [Time] is a<br>
single character from  to  inclusive. Responses<br>
can only be made fpr the message for the next [Time] with<br>
the following meanings:  to  time limit in<br>
minutes using least significant 4 bits;  30 minutes;<br> 60 minutes;  120 minutes;  180 minutes;<br> 360 minutes;  12 hours;  24 hours; all<br>
other values reserved.<br>
For example if [Time] is "e" (). then pagers can only<br>
send responses to messages over the next 5 minutes. If<br>
[Time] is "JFI" () then pagers an only<br>
send responses to messages when the ICS contains a<br>
time stamp before 0632 on the 10th of the month.<br>
{[ARB]} This parameter is only present if bit 3 of [Type] is set and<br>
defines a REC bit for the pager.<br>
For calls to a single pager: This parameter contains two<br>
hexadecimal characters that each have a value between "0"<br>
and "9", "A" and "F; inclusive. Together they make a 2 digit<br>
hexadecimal number in the range of "00" to "FF".<br>
For calls to a group of pagers: This parameter contains<br>
three characters "Gn1n2", where n1n2 are two hexadecimal<br>
characters that each have a value between "0" and "9", "A"<br>
and "F" inclusive. Together they make a 2 digit<br>
hexadecimal number in the range "00" to "FF".<br>
Alternatively it may contain one character "L". This<br>
instructs pagers to use the previous value of [ARB].<br>
{[TimeARB]} This parameter is only present if bii 4 of [Type] is set.<br>
The format of the contents of this parameter are identical<br>
to that in [Time]. It defines the time-limit that applies to<br>
[ARB]. If this parameter is not present:<br>
if [Time] is present, it defines the time-limit<br>
that applies to [aRB].<br>
otherwise [ARB] applies only when [RefRACS]<br>
matches [ReflCS] in the Invitation Control<br>
Sequence ICS.<br>
{[Code]} This parameter is only present if bit 5 of [Type] is set.<br>
This parameter defines the code to be used by the pager<br>
for all responses to this message only. It may be used<br>
instead of the Temporary Sequence Allocation Control<br><br>
Sequence TSACS and Temporary Phase Allocation<br>
Control Sequence TPACS.<br>
[Code] contains 2, 3 or 5 characters formatted as follows:<br>
2 characters: [Phase]<br>
3 characters: [Init b][lnit c]<br>
5 characters: [Init b][lnit c] [Phase]<br>
where<br>
[Init b] Contain one character, The least significant<br>
6 bits define the "b" 6 bit initialiser. Bit 7 is<br>
ignored and may have any value.<br>
[init c] Contains two characters. The least significant<br>
6 bits of each character together define the c"<br>
12 bit initialiser. The first of the two<br>
characters contain the most significant 6 bits,<br>
the second the least significant. ln both<br>
characters bit 7 is ignored and may have any<br>
value.<br>
[Phase] Contains two characters. The least significant<br>
6 bits of each character together define a 12<br>
bit number between 0 and 4095. The first of<br>
the two characters contain the most significant<br>
6 bits, the second the least significant. In<br>
both characters bit 7 is ignored and may have<br>
any value.<br>
This command requires a delimiter as the length of the RACS is not<br>
known.<br>
The Fast Invitation Control Sequence FICS is a combination of the<br>
Invitation Control Sequence ICS and the Response Allocation Control<br>
Sequence RACS, and can be sent to an individual pager, or to a group of<br>
pagers. Pagers may send a response immediately.<br>
The FICS has the following format:<br>"F"[Length]<br>
where [Length] is identical to that in the ICS command.<br>
Note that the FICS is equivalent to the following ICS and RACS:<br><ieh>"I"[Ref][Length]"T"[Ref]<br>
where [Ref] is any character. It is limited to Acknowledgment responses<br>
only and cannot be used to implement Progressive Elimination<br>
This command does not require a delimiter as the length of the FICS is<br>
known.<br>
The Embedded Answer Control Sequence (EACS) is used to enable a<br>
user to give an answer to a message The EACS may only be sent in the<br>
same message as the RACS and only applies to that message.<br>
Two forms of embedded answer are supported. In the first, actual reply<br>
messages are sent embedded within the message. In the second, a pre-<br>
defined dictionary of responses is specified. In this case only one EACS may<br>
be transmitted in the message.<br>
These forms must be used exclusively. A message may contain an<br>
EACS of either form, but may not contain an EACS of both forms.<br>
In the first form, the EACS has the following format:<br>"R"[Answer]<br>
[Answer] Is any string using printable characters. Characters that<br>
are not in the range  to  inclusive are not<br>
permitted.<br>
This command is delimited with the control character of any command<br>
that may follow (for example another EACS, or an POC), or the end, of the<br>
message.<br>
One or more EACS of this form may be sent in the message. On receipt<br>
of such a message, the pager will prompt the user to select an answer. There<br>
is also an additional implicit EACS. It shall not be sent by the paging System,<br>
but can be selected by the user as a response if desired. This shall be:<br>
"None of these"<br>
For example a message may be:<br>
Can you meet me at McDonalds tonight  R6pmR7pm<br>R8pm RNd Rl will call you later.<br>
On receipt of such a message, the pager will prompt the user to select<br>
an answer from:<br>
6pm<br>
7pm<br>
8pm<br>
No<br>
I will call you later<br>
None of these<br>
In the second form, canned answers that have been pre-stored in a<br>
pager may be used. Only one EACS may be sent in the message with the<br>
following format:<br>"rx"<br>
where x is a single hexadecimal digit between "0" and "9", "A" and "F"<br>
inclusive.<br>
This identifies one of 16 canned answer dictionaries in the pager. Note<br>
that dictionaries can be of any length up to 256 entries. Canned answer<br>
dictionaries are optional, and as many as required are defined by the operator.<br>
The command in this form does not require a delimiter as its length is<br>
known.<br>
The Restore Default Allocation Control Sequence RDACS is used to<br>
restore the default feedback masks, initialisers, and phases used by the pager.<br>
It may be sent in bojth personal messages and group messages. This<br>
command removes the effects of the PPFACS, PSACS and PPACS.<br>
The RDACS may be sent at any time, but must be sent in a message<br>
that contains the RACS. This enables the paging system to determine if the<br>
RDACS was received correctly.<br>
The RDACS has the following format:<br>"D"<br>
and has no parameters. This command does no} require a delimiter as<br>
the length of the RDACS is known.<br>
The End of Command (EOC) control sequence may be sent in any<br>
message as a delimiter to mark the end of a Control Sequence if required.<br>
Note that any other control character or the end of message also mark the end<br>
of a control sequence.<br>
The EOC has the following format:<br>"E"<br>
and has no parameters.<br>
The Temporary Sequence Allocation Control Sequence TSACS may be<br>
sent in both personal messages and group messages. The TSACS may only<br>
be sent in the same message as the RACS that does not contain the [Code]<br>
parameter, and applies only to responses for that message.<br>
The TSACS has the following format:<br>"x"[lnit b][Init c]<br>
[Init b] Contains one character. The least significant 6 bits define<br>
the "b" 6 bit initialiser. Bit 7 is ignored and may have any<br>
value.<br>
[Init c] Contains two characters. The bast significant 6 bits of<br>
each character together define the "c" 12 bit initialiser. The<br>
first of the two characters contain the most significant 6<br>
bits, the second the least significant. In both characters bit.<br>
7 is ignored and may have any value.<br>
Note that if the TSACS is sent as a group call both the sequence and<br>
phase are temporarily adjusted as will be described later.<br>
The Temporary Phase Allocation Control Sequence TPACS may only be<br>
sent to the unique RIC of a pager, and may not be sent as a group call. It is<br>
used to override the default phase used by the pager. The TPACS may only<br>
be sent in the same message as the RACS that does not contain the [Code]<br>
parameter, and only applies to responses to that message.<br>
 The TPACS has the following format:<br>"z"[Phase]<br>
[Phase] Contains two characters. The least significant 6 bits of<br>
each character together define a 12 bit number between 0<br>
and 4095. The first of the two characters contain the most<br>
significant 6 bits, the second the least significant. In both<br>
characters bit 7 is ignored and may have any value.<br>
The phase of a sequence that a pager uses shall be [Phase]. The use<br>
of this parameter will be described later in connection with Table 2.<br>
This command does not require a delimiter as the length of the JPACS<br>
is known.<br>
The Transmit Enable/Inhibit Command Sequence (TEICS) may be sent<br>
to inhibit or to enable a pager transmitting. The TEICS has the following<br>
format:<br>"A1 Disable<br>"a" Enable<br>
This command changes the Transmit parameter in the pager. If enabled,<br>
pagers may transmit. If disabled pagers may not transmit, and may only<br>
function as a one way pager.<br>
This command does not require a delimiter as the length of the TEICS<br>
is known.<br>
The Permanent P.N. Family Allocation Control Sequence (PPFACS) may<br>
only be sent to the unique RIC of a pager, and may not be sent as a group call.<br>
It is used to override the default XOR feedback masks used by the sequence<br>
generator.<br>
The PPFACS may only be sent in the same message as the RACS that<br>
does not contain the [Code] parameter, and applies to that and all subsequent<br>
messages.<br>
All pagers in a paging system shall use the same family. This command<br>
must be sent to a roaming pagers that use a different default family.<br>
The PPFACS has the following format:<br>"P"[Mask h,][Mask hb][Mask hc]<br>
[Mask ha] Contains two characters. The least significant 6 bits of<br>
each character together define the "ha" 12 bit feedback<br>
mask 108 (see Figure 8). The first of the two characters<br>
contain the most significant 6 bits, the second the least<br>
significant. In both characters bit 7 is ignored and may<br>
have any value.<br>
[Mask hb] Contains one character. The least significant 6 bits define<br>
the "hb"6 bit feedback mask 112 (Figure 8). Bit 7 is ignored<br>
and may have any value.<br>
[Mask hj Contains two characters. The least significant 6 bits of<br>
each character together define the hc" 12 bit feedback<br>
mask 110 (Figure 8). The first of the two characters<br>
contain the most significant 6 bits the second thu least<br>
significant. In both characters bit 7 is ignored and may<br>
have any value.<br>
This command does not require a delimiter as the length of the PPFACS<br>
is known.<br>
The Temporary P.N.Family Allocation Control Sequence TPFACS may<br>
only be sent to the unique RIC of a pager, and may not be sent as a group calf.<br>
It is used to override the default XOR feedback masks used by thej sequence<br>
generator. The TPFACS may only be sent in the same message as the RACS<br>
that does not contain the [Code] parameter, and applies only to responses for<br>
that message.<br>
The TPFACS has the following format:<br>"Q"[Mask ha][Mask hb][Mask hc]<br>
where parameters are as described above for the PPFACS. This<br>
command does not require a delimiter as the length of the TPFACS is known.<br>
The Permanent Sequence Allocation Control Sequence PSACS may only<br>
be sent to the unique RIC of a pager, and may not be sent as a group call. It<br>
is used to override the default sequence registers useed by the pager. The<br>
PSACS may only be sent in the same message as the RACS that does not<br>
contain the [Code] parameter, and applies to that and all subsequent<br>
messages.<br>
The PSACS has the following format:<br>"W"[lnit b][lnit c]<br>
where parameters are as described above for the TSACS.<br>
This command does not require a delimiter as the length of the PSACS<br>
is known.<br>
The Permanent Phase Allocation Control Sequence PPACS may only be<br>
sent to the unique RiC of a pager, and may not be sent as a group call. It is<br>
used to override the default phase used by the pager. The PPACS may only<br>
be sent in the same message as the RACS that does not contain the [Code]<br>
parameter, and applies to that and all subsequent messages.<br>
The PPACS has the following format:<br>"Y"[Phase]<br>
[Phase] Contains two characters. The least significant 6 bits of<br>
each character together define a 12 pit number between 0<br>
and 4095. The first of the two characters contain the most<br>
significant 6 bits, the second the least significant. In both<br>
characters bit 7 is ignored and may have any value.<br>
This command does not require a delimiter as the length of the PPACS<br>
is known.<br>
The Phase Step Definition Sequence PSDCS defines the phase step<br>
between permitted codes. It would typically be used to reprogram roaming<br>
pagers.<br>
The PSDCS has the following tormat:<br>"S"[Phase Step]<br>
where<br>
[Phase Step] Contains one character that may have any value. The<br>
least significant 6 bits define the Phase Step to be used by<br>
the pager. Bit 7 is ignored and may have any value.<br>
This command does not require a delimiter as the length of the PSDCS<br>
is known.<br>
In some cases there may be a requirement to Send a control character<br>
as a character in part of a message to be displayed to the user. In such cases<br>
an escape control character is defined by the operator.<br>
In the embodiments of the present invention two way pagers do not use<br>
tone calls. Instead paging calls where a single address codeword is used shall<br>
be interpreted as an acknowledgement to a transmission by a pager. They are<br>
an alternative to using the REC parameter in the invitation Control Sequence<br>
ICS.<br>
For POCSAG pagers, the function bits used in the address codeword,<br>
that is bits 20 and 21, identify the ICS to which the pager responded. The<br>
function bits match the two least significant bits of the ICS [ReflCS] parameter.<br>
The use of such calls is optional.<br>
The use of the previously described command sequences in a paging<br>
system and how a pager should respond to the command sequences to<br>
implement two way paging will now be described.<br>
The following applies:<br>
Two types of transmission may be sent by pagers:<br>
i) Solicited These are expected transmissions made by<br>
pagers as a result of a message.<br>
ii) Unsolicited These are unexpected transmissions made by<br>
pagers - for example when registering<br>
roaming, or when the user is requesting<br>
information.<br>
Pagers can only transmit a response after an Invitation Control Sequence,<br>
ICS or a Fast Invitation Control Sequence FICS has been received. The<br>
parameters in the control sequences are used to determine if and what type of<br>
responses are permitted. Except when inviting unsolicited responses, the ICS<br>
is used in conjunction with the RACS. The FICS is usad on its own.<br>
Pagers may transmit one of several codes in response to a message.<br>
The meanings of different codes are defined later.<br>
Answerback codes fall into one of three categories:<br>
i) Default These have already been defined in<br>
connection with the description of Figures 8<br>
and 9<br>
ii)Permanent On occasion, pagers may be instructed to use<br>
different answerback codes for responses to<br>
messages. Such instructions are typically<br>
given to roaming pagers. The RDACS causes<br>
pagers to resume use of Default codes.<br>
iii) Temporary Messages may include answerback codes to<br>
be used by pagers for that message only.<br>
Subsequent responses to messages use<br>
Default or Permanent Codes.<br>
Operators may use one of two basic strategies:<br>
1) Invite pagers to respond immediately to a message. This is achieved by<br><br>
sending the ICS and RACS in the same message, or by sending the<br>
FICS. In general only a few pagers would transmit respqnses at the<br>
same time.<br>
2) Invite pagers to respond together. This is achieved by (sending the<br>
RACS in individual messages, and then by sending the ICS as a group<br>
call. This technique is required if the same frequency is to be used for<br>
uplink and downlink transmissions.<br>
A total of 218 sequences are available for use by pagers to transmit<br>
responses to messages. Depending on the Phase Step, up to 512 codes are<br>
available per sequence. This means that up to 227 codes are available for use.<br>
 These codes can be used for one of two purposes - as reserved codes<br>
for individual pagers, or as spare codes for general use.<br>
The constant [N] and parameter [Phase Step] (as described previously<br>
in connection with code generation) provide a number of options. For Phase<br>
Step values of 8 and 16, these are as shown in Table 2.<br>
Command Sequences defined previously enable codes (Doth sequences<br>
and phases) to be allocated on a message by message basis. Three strategies<br>
are available:<br>
1) Never use sequence or phase re-allocation and have no spare sequences.<br>
This strategy means that only one two-way message may be sent to a<br>
pager at a time.<br>
2) Use phase re-allocation only. In this case a set number of pagers would<br>
share the Phases of their given sequence. For example if [N] is 4 and<br>
[Phase Step] is 8, 16 pagers would share all 256 phases of the same<br>
sequence.<br>
3) Always use both sequence and phase re-allocation. In this case [N]<br>
should be set to a higher number and the Spare Sequences should always<br>
be used for messages.<br>
Various hybrids could be used. Note that if roaming is to be supported,<br>
roaming pagers may, need to have their [Phase Step] parameter re-<br>
programmed.<br>
A pager may transmit one of a number of sequences which each have a<br>
different meaning. To limit base-station processing, the ICS can restrict the<br>
transmission from pagers to a sub-set by appropriate use of the [Type]<br>
parameters in both the ICS and RACS.<br>
Transmissions which are solicited by a paging network controller include:<br>
ACK: Acknowledgement. This informs the paging network<br>
controller that the message was received correctly.<br><br>
DISP: Displayed. This informs the paging network controller that<br>
the message was received correctly and displayed to the<br>
user.<br>
ANR: Answer Ready. This informs the paging network controller<br>
that a user answer to the message is ready.<br>
FLG: Any answer Ready This informs the paging network<br>
controller that a user answer to any message is ready.<br>
ANSn: An actual answer to the message, where n is a number.<br>
Unsolicited transmissions comprise.<br>
REG: Registration.<br>
DAT: Data, where higher uplink data rates are used.<br>
The pseudo-random data sequence to be used by a pager is defined<br>
above in connection with the description of Figures 8 and 9. However it can<br>
be changed by receipt of commands defined in Table 1.<br>
A pager shall use Answerback Phases as follows:<br>
Phase - ACK or REG Message Acknowledgement or<br>
Registrat n<br>
Phase + Phase Step - DISP Message Displayed<br>
Phase + 2 x Phase Step - ANR or FLO Answer Ready<br>
Phase + 3 x Phase Step - ANSO "None of These"<br>
Phase + 4 x Phase Step - ANS1 User Answer 1<br>
Phase + 5 x Phase Step - ANS2 User Answer 2<br>
Phase + (N-3) x Phase Step - ANSN User Answer N<br>
where the default Phase of a pager and the Phase Step are as defined,<br>
previously. The Phase Step can be changed by commands defined in Table 1.<br>
The following constraints apply:<br>
REG and FLG responses may not be sent on a temporary Sequence or<br>
Phase.<br>
If more than one message is sent to a pager that requires responses, then<br>
the RACS [Code] parameter, or TSACS and TPACS should be used.<br>
If a pager has responses ready for more than one message, the response<br>
to the oldest message should be given. The exception is when fragmented<br>
messages are sent and other rules apply.<br>
The following rules must be used to determine if a response is permitted<br>
to be sent by the pager. Reference is made to the ICS, RACS, and the FICS.<br>
If Progressive Elimination is to be used, then the rules defined later in<br>
connection with a discussion of Progressive Elimination also apply.<br>
Acknowledgements responses ACK to a message may only be sent if the<br>
following conditions apply:<br>
Either all of the following:<br>
The RACS [Type] parameter permits acknowledgements.<br>
The ICS [Type] parameter permits acknowledgements.<br>
The RACS [RefRACS] and ICS [ReflCS] parameter are identical<br>
The ICS is the first ICS received after the RACS.<br>
Or:<br>
A FICS is sent.<br>
In addition the following apply:<br>
The message has been received and all errors corrected<br>
The message is less than a day old.<br>
DISP responses to a message may only be sent if, all the following<br>
conditions apply:<br>
The message has been displayed to the user. Note that this is a pager<br>
dependent function.<br>
The RACS [Type] parameter permits displayed responses.<br>
The ICS [Type] paiameter permits displayed responses.<br>
The RACS [Time] parameter is greater than the ICS [Time] parameter.<br>
The message is less than 16 days old.<br>
If a previous DISP transmission for the message has been sent and not<br>
acknowledged.<br>
No more than [R] DISP transmissions have beerr made to the message.<br>
where [R] is defined by the operator. For example if R is 3, then only 3<br>
DISP transmissions may be made to a message, not counting re-transmissions<br>
due to Progressive Elimination.<br>
The ANR, FLG and ANSn responses are used to convey user answers to<br>
a message. Their use is as follows: <br>
ANR: A user answer is ready to be transmitted. This type of<br>
response enables an operator to determine if answers are<br><br>
ready before searching for them, reducing processing loads.<br>
FLG: This response is only used if more than one message has<br>
been sent to a pager that have answers. It indicates that an<br>
answer is ready to any outstanding message.<br>
ANSn: This is an actual answer to a message.<br>
This enables one of three strategies to be used:<br>
1) Request ANR responses, then request ANSn responses.<br>
This should be used when a high nurjnber of responses are<br>
anticipated.<br>
2) Request FLG responses, then request ANSn responses.<br>
3) Just request ANSn responses. This should be used when<br>
the number of expected responses is low.<br>
ANR responses to a message may only be sent if all the following conditions<br>
apply<br>
The user has an answer to the message. Note that this is a pager<br>
dependent function.<br>
The RACS [Type] parameter permits user answer responses.<br>
The ICS [Type] parameter permits specific user answer ready responses.<br>
The RACS [Time] parameter is greater than the ICS [Time] parameter.<br>
The message is less than 16 days old.<br>
No more than [R] ANR transmissions have been made to the message.<br>
FLG responses may only be sent if all the following conditions apply:<br>
The user has an answer to any message. Note that this is a pager<br>
dependent function.<br>
The RACS [Type] parameter permits user answer responses.<br>
The ICS [Type] parameter permits genera! user answer ready responses.<br><br>
The RACS [Time] parameter is greater than the ICS [Time] parameter.<br>
The message is less than 16 days old.<br>
No more than [R] FLG transmissions have been made to the message.<br><br>
ANSn responses to a message may only be sent if all the following conditions<br>
apply:<br>
The user has selected that answer to the message. Note that this is a<br>
pager dependent function.<br>
The RACS [Type] parameter permits user answer responses.<br>
The ICS [Type] parameter permits user answer responses.<br>
The RACS [Time] parameter is greater than the ICS [Time] parameter.<br>
The message is less than 16 days old.<br>
No more than [R] ANSn transmissions have been made to the message<br>
where [R] is the same as for DISP responses.<br>
Registration responses REG may only be sent if the following conditions<br>
apply:<br>
There is a need to send a REG command. (This is application<br>
dependent.)<br>
The ICS [Type] parameter indicates Unsolicited Responses (bit 5 is clear).<br>
The URN defined in the ICS [Type] parameter is less than or equal to 18<br>
().<br>
The Answerback Code used by the pager for registration shall be the<br>
default code described in connection with ihe description of Figures 8 and 9,<br>
or the permanent code is modified by commands in Table 1. This code is<br>
further modified as follows:<br>
The URN defines a mask that shall be applied to b and c shift registers<br>
118 and 116, respectively, of the sequence generator (Figure 8). The mask<br>
shall be ANDed with the values in the shift registers and the result stored in<br>
shift registers 116 and 116.<br>
The Phase used by the pager remains unmodified. Note that if the URN<br>
is 0, then the sequence also remains unmodified.<br>
The use of the URN enables the operator to identify pagers wishing to<br>
register on an iterative basis. This prevents base stations having to took for<br>
many thousands of answerback codes.<br>
Two way messaging is not limited to personal calls. For two way calls to<br>
a group of pagers two techniques are available:<br>
1) Use Default or Permanent Codes<br>
2) Use Temporary Codes.<br>
Group Calls using default or permanent codes is the simplest mechanism<br>
for sending group two-way messages. The following apply:<br>
Group calls are received on a common RIC that is shared by other pagers.<br>
Temporary codes are not defined in the message.<br>
Pagers respond to group two-way calls as with personal calls.<br>
The pager does not need to know the difference between Group RICs and<br>
Personal RICs, and each pager responds with its unique code.<br>
Note that there are two limitations with this technique:<br>
i) Only one such two way call may be sent at a time.<br>
ii) The number of codes available for answers is limited.<br>
Group calls using temporary codes is a more complex mechanism for<br>
" sending group calls, but it overcomes the limitations when default or permanent<br>
codes are used. The.following apply:<br>
Each pager must have a common RIC with Group Call ID enabled and<br>
each pager must have a unique sub-address [2]. Group calls are (defined<br>
as those where at least one wild card character is used.<br>
All group calls shall include a temporary sequence and phase either using<br>
the [Code] parameter of the RACS or by using the TSACS and TPACS<br>
commands. <br>
The Phase used by a pager shall be:<br>
{[Phase Step] x [CN] x [sub-address + Phase]) MOD 212<br>
The Sequence used by the pager shall be:<br>
([Init b][lnit c]+([Pha,se Step]x[CN]x[sub-address + Phase])DIV212)MOD 218<br>
where [Phase Step] is as described previously, and<br>
[Init b][lnit c] and [Phase] is as defined in the [Code] parameter of the<br>
RACS, or as in the TSACS and TPACS.<br>
[CN] defines the number of possible responses to the message and can be<br>
calculated as follows:<br>
If the RACS [Type] parameter permits ACKs, rack=1, else rack=0.<br>
If the RACS [Type] parameter permits DISPs, rdisp=1, else rdisp=0.<br>
If the RACS [Type] parameter permits ANRs, ranr=1, else ranr=0.<br>
If ranr=1; if canned dictionary is used, ranr=256 else ranr=1 + Number of<br>
possible answers.<br>
K ranr=0; ranr=0.<br>
CN =rack+rdisp+ranr+rans<br>
Progressive Elimination is particularly applicable if receiver sites are likely<br>
to suffer, from the near-far problem associated with CDMA transmissions. If in<br>
a distributed paging system with many receiver sites this problem is considered<br>
insignificant, then this technique is optional.<br>
If Progressive Elimination is not to be used, the ICS [Slot] parameter shall<br>
always be 0.<br>
Progressive Elimination is implemented as follows<br>
Several ICSs are sent as a series.<br>
Ail pagers respond to the first ICS<br>
A second ICS is then transmitted that includes the [REC] parameter. This<br>
informs pagers if their response was or was not received.<br>
Only pagers that have not had their response received re-transmit in<br>
response to the second ICS.<br>
A third and subsequent ICS may be sent that each include the [REC]<br>
parameter.<br>
Typically, the [Length] parameter is set to a low value for the first ICS, and<br>
increased in subsequent ICSs in the series.<br>
At the end of the Answerback series, there may be some pagers that have<br>
still not had their responses detected by the paging system. In such cases the<br>
paging system may retransmit the original message. The operator may specify<br>
a maximum number of times that a message should be transmitted.<br>
|n order to prevent pagers being confused between different series, the<br>
[ReflCS] and. [Slot] parameters in the ICS are used as follows:<br>
The [ReflCS] parameter is the same for each series and is increased by<br>
one for the next saries. If [ReflCS] reaches  it shall be reset to<br>.<br>
The Slot parameter is 0 for the first ICS of a series, and increased by 1 for<br>
each ICS of the series. It resets to 0 only whenthe {ReflCS] parameter<br>
increases.<br>
The [REC] parameter is only present when [Slot] is non zero.<br>
For example a series may be: , ,<br>, .<br>
The next series will then be: , ,<br>, <br>
The next: , <br>, .<br>
etc.<br>
The ICS [REC] parameter is used in conjunction with the RACS; [ARB]<br>
parameter, and they are used to implement Progressive Elimination.<br>
It is used by pagers who sent a transmission in the previous ICS of a<br>
Progressive Elimination series to determine if their transmission was received.<br>
It contains a variable number of bits that identify pagers whose response was<br>
received, where one bit identifies a pager.<br>
Pagers determine which bit that they are associated with as follows:<br>
For calls to single pagers, the bit number is uniduely defined from the<br>
[ARB] parameter in the RACS counting from 0. (For example where [ARB]<br>
is 5, this corresponds to the sixth bit.)<br>
For calls to a group of pagers, the bit number is the pager numbef in the<br>
group + n1n2, defined in the [ARB] parameter in the RACS.<br>
The following rules apply:<br>
If the bit is set to 1, then the pager is required to send a response.<br>
If the bit is set to 0," a previous response was received and retransmission<br>
is not required.<br>
If the ICS [Slot] parameter is 0, (there is no [REC] parameter), then the<br>
pager is required to send a respond<br>
The ICS [REC] parameter may finish early and contain less bits than<br>
expected. Bits truncated from [REC] shall have an assumed value of 0.<br>
The [ARB] value may have a time limit. This enables it to be re-used for<br>
other pagers in later transmissions. If a time limit is set (the RACS [TimeARB]<br>
parameter exists) then Progressive Elimination may only be used up to the time<br>
specified.<br>
Note that if a time limit is not specified, the [ARB] value appliesvto all<br>
Progressive Elimination sequences for responses to the message.<br>
A description will now be given on how the Control Sequences and pager<br>
responses may be used<br>
In order to facilitate understanding of these various uses Progressive<br>
Elimination will not be considered.<br>
Figure 12 is a timing diagram showing the paging system PS transmitting<br>
an invitation control sequence ICS, the message being received by an<br>
individual pager PG which transmits an acknowledgement ACK.<br>
If the ACK is not received, the paging system may continue to repeat the<br>
message as determined by the operator.<br>
There are instances when the paging system wants to be informed when<br>
the message is displayed to the user. This is shown in Figure 12. In some<br>
cases both ACK and DISP responses may be made by a pager - such as when<br>
a pager user does not immediately look at a message. In other cases, just the<br>
DISP response is sufficient.<br>
As shown in Figure 13, an ACK is sent by the pager PG in response to a<br>
message including ICS. The paging system PS requests to be informed when<br>
the message has been displayed to the user by sending a "Request for DISP" .<br>
message, which may have to be repeated. Once the user has read the<br>
message; the pager transmits DISP.<br>
Note that "Request for DISP" means that an ICS is sent where the [Type]<br>
parameter has bits 1 and 5 set. The ICS may be sent in a personal or group<br>
message.<br>
In the case of messages requiring an answer the ANR, FLG, and ANSn<br>
responses are used tc convey user answers to a message.<br>
This enables one of three strategies to be used:<br>
1) Request ANR responses, then request ANSn responses.<br>
2) Request FLG responses, then request ANSn responses.<br>
3) Just request ANSn responses.<br>
In order to minimise processing at the paging network controller PNC. user<br>
answers to a message are given in two responses. In the first response, the<br>
pager sends a "ANR" indicating to the PNC that an answer is available. The<br>
PNC then sends another ICS to the pager requesting the answer. In response<br>
the pager sends the user answer to the message.<br>
The PNC has to then search for all possible answers for that message.<br>
The signalling sequence between the paging system PS and the pager PG<br>
is shown in Figure 13.<br>
Briefly, the paging system sends a message, including RACS and ICS, to<br>
the pager. The pager acknowledges receipt by sending ACK. The paging<br>
system requests an answer by transmitting ANR, which is repeated] after a time "<br>
interval during which the user reads the message and gives an answer. The<br>
answer ANR is transmitted and in response to its receipt the paging system<br>
sends a request for ANSn, which is responded to by the pager.<br>
Note that "Request for ANR" means that an ICS is sent wher the [Type]<br>
parameter has bits 2 and 5 set. "Request for ANSn means that an ICS is sent<br>
where the [Type] parameter has bits 4 and 5 set.<br>
An alternative method to minimise processing at the paging network<br>
controller PNC requires the pager when sending its first response to send a<br>
"FLG" indicating to the paging network controller that an answer to any<br>
message is available. The base station then sends another ICS to the pager<br>
requesting the answer. In response the pager sends the user answer to the<br>
message. This is shown in Figure 15 which in many respects is similar to<br>
Figure 14 except that instead of the paging system sending "Request for ANR"<br>
and the pager sending "ANR", the paging system sends "Request for FLG" and<br>
the pager sends "FLG"<br>
The base station has to then search for all possible answers for all<br>
previous messages.<br>
Note that "Request for FLG" means that an ICS is sent where the [Type]<br>
 parameter has bits 2 and 5 set. "Request for ANSn" means that an ICS is sent<br>
where the [Type] parameter has bits 4 and 5 set.<br>
If the number of responses from pagers is low, the paging njetwork<br>
controller may request answers directly without sending an ANR or FLG<br>
request in the ICS as shown in Figures 14 and 15. Instead the paging system<br>
sends "Request for ANSn" to which the pager responds by sending ANSn.<br>
Note that "Request for ANSn" means that an ICS is sent where the [Type]<br>
parameter has bits 4 and 5 set.<br>
The base station has to search for all possible answers from all pagers for<br>
all previous messages.<br>
Registration enables pagers to register onto a paging system. There are<br>
two uses for this - the first is to inform the paging system the location of the<br>
pager. The second is so that a service can be requested. The following<br>
serves as an example:<br>
User requests service by a registration call with flag bit set. This request<br>
may be sent in response to the paging system, issuing a global ICS,<br>
requesting unsolicited responses.<br>
Message to pager includes EACS describing services available.<br>
User selects response (e.g. traffic news)<br>
Message to pager providing information.<br>
Sending long messages as a series of fragments is Automatic ReQuest<br>
ARQ protocols can be applied. For example one ACK can be used to<br>
acknowledge receipt of several fragments. Rules for sending two-way<br>
fragmented messages shall be as follows:<br>
i. All but the last fragment may be sent as a one-way or two-way<br>
message. The last fragment must be a two-way message.<br>
ii. Acknowledgement of a two-way fragment shall be interpreted as<br>
meaning that all fragments up to and including that fragment are<br>
received successfully.<br>
iii. All but the last two-way fragment shall only use ACK responses.<br>
The last fragment may use ACK, DISP, ANR, FLG and ANSn<br>
responses, which apply to the whole message.<br>
iv. For fragmented messages with embedded answers, the numbering<br>
of the answers and enabling the user to select a response shall be<br>
permitted only after all fragments have been successfully received<br>
and the message reconstructed.<br>
Operators may use these rules to implement several ARO schemes<br>
without the pager requiring to know which protocol is being used The following<br>
sub-sections describe how some standard ARQ schemes could be<br>
implemented.<br>
In the case of requesting one ARQ for the whole message, the paging<br>
system sends all but the last fragment as a one-way message. Successful<br>
acknowledgement of the last fragment means that all the other fragments were<br>
received successfully<br>
If the message is not acknowledged, then the whole message will need to<br>
be re-transmitted. However note that it should be possible for a pager to<br>
rebuild a message from fragments of different transmissions. This is a very<br>
simple although inefficient scheme - the main purpose of which is to reduce<br>
system message delays for other users.<br>
An alternative approach is termed stop and wait in which each fragment<br>
is sent as a two-way message. The paging system waits for successful<br>
acknowledgement before sending the next fragment.<br>
In another approach each fragment is sent as a two-way message without<br>
waiting for successful acknowledgement of the previous fragment. Each<br>
fragment will require a different Answerback Code, if after prompting the pager<br>
does not acknowledge the latest fragment, the system shall re-transmit all<br>
fragments after that which was acknowledged.<br>
In a further approach each fragment is sent as a two-way message without<br>
waiting for successful acknowledgement of the previous fragment. Each<br>
fragment will require a different Answerback Code. If after prompting the pager<br>
does not acknowledge the latest fragment, the system shall re-transmit only the<br>
one fragment after that which was acknowledged.<br>
Combinations of these different approaches maybe used. For example<br>
the stop and wait may be combined with the single ARQ, where every Nth<br>
fragment is a two-way message.<br>
From reading the present disclosure, other modifications will be apparent<br>
to persons skilled in the art. Such modifications may involve other features<br>
which are already known in the design, manufacture and use of message<br>
transmission systems or component parts thereof and which may be used<br>
instead of or in addition to features already described herein.<br>
