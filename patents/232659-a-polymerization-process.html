This invention relates to a catalyst component dispersion comprising an ionic compound in solid form, to a nonsupported solid catalyst comprising a transition metal compound, an ionic compound, and an organometal compound, to a supported solid catalyst comprising a transition metal compound, an ionic compound, an organometal compound, and a support material, to a method for preparing the catalyst component dispersion, to a method for preparing the solid catalysts, to a method for activating a catalyst suitable for addition polymerization, and to an addition polymerization process using the solid catalysts.<br>
Homogeneous ionic transition metal catalysts are known for their high catalytic activity in addition polymerizations, especially those of olefins and diolefins, and are capable of providing olefinic polymers of narrow molecular weight distributions and, for example when ethylene is copoiymerized with a further alpha-olefin, narrow comonomer distributions. Under polymerization conditions where polymer is formed as solid particles, for example, in gas phase or slurry phase polymerizations, these homogeneous (soluble) catalysts form polymer deposits on reactor walls and stirrers ""which deposits should be removed frequently as they prevent an efficient heat-exchange necessary for cooling the reactor contents, prevent the regular or continuous removal of polymer from the reactor, and cause excessive wear of the moving parts in the reactor. The polymers produced by these soluble catalysts further have undesirable particle characterisdcs such as a low bulk density which limits the commercial utility of both the polymer and the process. Therefore, there is a need to provide catalysts that would overcome such problems.<br><br>
Several supported catalysts have been proposed for use in particle forming polymerization processes. Support materials in the prior art are typically employed in combination with catalytic components to obtain the formation of polymer particles of desirable particle size and morphology. Secondly, support materials are used to increase catalytic activity per unit of active components by depositing such components on a support material having a relatively high surface area. Furthermore, support materials are employed for anchoring thereon the catalytic components to avoid the presence of significant amounts of catalyst which under particle forming polymerization conditions becomes solubilized and gives rise to particles of undesired size and morphology, said particles contributing to the formation of polymer deposits . at reactor walls and other moving parts in the reactor.<br>
EP-327649 and EP-725086 describe sohd catalysts using alumoxanes as cocatalysi. EP-327649 relates to a nonsupported olefin polymerization catalyst composed of a transition metal compound and an alumoxane having an average particle size of 5 to 200 micrometers and a specific surface area of 20 to 1.000 m'/g. EP-725086 describes a solid component of a catalyst for ethylene and alpha-olefins (co)polymerization comprising a metailocene supported on an inorganic solid carrier, where a carbon atom of one of the T)-cyclopenladienyl rings coordinated to the transition metal is covatently bonded to a metal atom of the inorganic solid carrier. This solid component is typically used with an organic aluminum oxy-derivative which is usually alumoxane.<br>
Supported nonalumoxane catalysts are disclosed, for example, in EP-418044, EP-522581,WO-91/09882, WO-94/03506, WO-9403509, and WO-9407927. These describe supported catalysis obtained by combining a transition metal compound, an activator component comprising a cation capable of reacting with a transition metal compound and a bulky, labile anion capable of stabilizing the metal cation formed as a result of reaction between the metal compound and the activator component, and a catalyst support material. In EP-522581 and WO-9407927 additionally an organometal compound, typically an organoaluminum compound is employed.<br><br>
EP-727443 describes an olefin polymerization catalyst obtainable by contacting a transition metal compound, an organometallic compound, and a solid catalyst component comprising a carrier and an ionized ionic compound capable of forming a stable anion on reaction with said transition metal compound, wherein said ionized ionic compound comprises a calionic component and an anionic component and said cationic component is fixed on the surface of the carrier.<br>
WO-96/Q4319 describes a catalyst composition comprising a metal oxide support having covalentty bound to the surface thereof directly through the oxygen atom of the metal oxide, an activator anion that is also ionically bound to a catalytically acti\e transition metal compound.<br>
WO-93/11172 relates to polyanionic moieties comprising a plurality of noncoordinating anionic groups pendant from and chemically bonded to a core component. The core component may be across-linked polystyrene or polydivinylbenzene polymeric core or a polyanionic Lewis basic core substrate readable with a Lewis acid. The polyanionic moieties are used in a noncoordinating association with cationic transition metal compounds.<br>
Copending U,S, Application Serial No. 08/610,647, filed March 4, 1996, corresponding to WO-96/28480, describes supported catalyst components comprising a suppon material, an organometal compound, an activator compound comprising a cation which is capable of reacting with a transition metal compound to fonn a catalytically active transition metal complex and a compatible anion having up to 100 nonhydrogen atoms and containing at least one substituent comprising a moiety having an active hydrogen. When combined with a transition metal compound, the resulting supported catalysts are very useful additioti polymerization catalysts.<br>
It would be desirable to provide a solid catalyst and solid catalyst dispersions, and components or precursors therefor, which do not require an aiumoxane component and which can be used in parVicie formation polymerization processes without requiring a support material.<br><br>
It would also be desirable to provide a solid catalyst, including precursors therefor, which when used in a polymerization process are capable of producing polymers at good catalyst efficiencies.<br>
It is a further object to provide a solid catalyst, including precursors therefor, which when used in a particle forming poiymerization process give reduced amounts of particles otjjndesired size and morphology.

According to a further aspect the invention provides a supported solid catalyst comprising (aV \b). and (c) as described hereinbefore, as well as (d) a support material.<br>
Suitable support materials (d), also referred to as caniers or carrier materials, which may optionally be used in the present invention include those support materials which are typically used in the art of supported catalysts, and more in particular the art of supported olefin addition polymerization supported catalysts. Examples include porous resinous materials, for example, polyolefins such as polyethyienes and polypropyienes or copolymers of styrene-divinylbenzene, and solid inorganic oxides including oxides of Group 2, 3,4. 13. or 14 metals, such as silica, alumina, magnesium oxide, titanium oxide, thorium oxide, as well as mixed oxides of silica. Suitable mixed oxides of silica include those of silica and one or more Group 2 or 13 metal oxides, such as silica-magnesia or silica-alumina mixed oxides. Silica, alumina, and mixed oxides of silica and one or more Group 2 or 13 metal oxides are preferred support materials. Preferred examples of such mixed oxides are the silica-aluminas. The most preferred support material is silica. The shape of the silica particles is not critical and the silica may be in granular, spherical, agglomerated, fumed or other form.<br>
Support materials suitable for the presenfinvention preferably have a surface area as determined by nitrogen porosimetry using the B.E.T. method from 10 to about 1000 m"/g, and preferably from about 100 to 600 m"/g. The pore volume of the support, as determined by nitrogen adsorption, is typically up to 5 cm /g.<br><br>
advantageously between 0.1 and 3 cmVg, preferably from about 0.2 to 2 cmVg. The average particle size is not critical but typically is from 0.5 to 500 pm, preferably from 1 to 200 jjra, more preferably to 100 pm.<br>
Preferred supports for use in the present invention include highly porous silicas, aluminas, aluminosilicates, and mixtures thereof. The most preferred support material is silica. The support material may be in granular, agglomerated, pellelized, or any other physical form. Suitable materials include, but are not limited to, silicas available from Grace Davison (division of W.R. Grace &amp; Co.) under the designations SD 3216.30, Davison Syloid ™245, Davison 948 and Davison 952, and from Crosfield under the designation ES70, and from Degussa AG under the designation Aerosil ™812; and aluminas available from Akzo Chemicals Inc. under the designation Ketzen™ Grade B.<br>
The support material may be subjected to a heat treatment and/or chemical treatment to reduce the water content or the hydroxyl content of the support material. Both dehydrated support materials and support materials containing small amounts of water can be used. Typical, chemical dehydration or dehydroxylation agents are reactive metal hydrides, alkyls and halides such as aluminum alkyls, alkyl silicon halides and the like. Prior to its use, the support material can be subjected to a thermal treatment at 100°C to lOOOC, preferably at about 200°C to about 850°C in an inert atmosphere or under reduced pressure. Typically, this treatment is carried out for about 10 minutes to about 72 hours, preferably from about 0.5 hours to 24 hours.<br>
The support material, optionaUy thermally treated, may preferably be combined with a further organometal metalloid compound, more preferably an organoaluminum compound, most preferably a trialkylaluminura compound in a suitable diluent or solvent, preferably one in which the organometal compound is soluble. Typical solvents are hydrocarbon solvents having from 5 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably aromatic solvents such as toluene and xylenes, or aliphatic solvents of 6 to 10 carbon atoms, such as hexane, heptane, octane, nonane, decane, and isomers thereof, cycloaliphatic solvents of 6 to 12 carbon atoms such as cyclohexane, or mixtures of any of these.<br><br>
The support material is combined with the organometai compound at a temperature of -ZOC to ISOX. preferably at 20°C to 100°C. The contact time is not critical and can vary from 5 minutes to 72 hours, and is preferably from 0.5 hours to 36 hours. Agitation is preferably applied.<br>
An alternative pretreatment of the support material involves a treatment with alumoxane. The alumoxane may be contacted with the support material in the manner described above or the alumoxane may be generated in situ on the support material by contacting an alkyialuminum, preferably trialkylaluminum compound, with a support material containing water.<br>
The pretreated support material is preferably recovered prior to its further use.<br>
Pretreated support materials do not contain the tethering groups, such as, for example, surface hydroxy) groups, which are typically found in various support materials, especially silicas and silica containing support materials. Pretreated support materials may contain terminal residues of a material used for pretreatment, such as, for example, an alumoxane residue or the residue of a trialkylaluminum compound, such as -AIR2. Certain of these residues, in particular an alumoxane residue or the residue of a trialkylaluminum compound, are capable of reacting with the moiety having an active hydrogen of the anion (a)(2) of the ionic compound. However, if a pretreated silica is used in a process, and at some point in the process a compound which is the reacuon product of (a) an ionic compound and (c) an organometai or metalloid compound, or a substantially inactive catalyst precursor are brought into contact, reaction to form a covaleni bond with tethering to the support is not possible, since all potentially reactive groups which could enter into a reaction resulting in tethering have been blocked or capped.<br>
In various aspects of this invention where a support material is employed, including catalyst components and catalysts, as well as corresponding aspects which are nonsupported, whether as homogeneous solutions, solids or dispersions, an alternative expression of each of those aspects is one that is essentially free of alumoxane.<br><br>
According to the present invention, the ionic compound (a) can be formed into a dispersion of solid particles (a) by a controlled precipitation. This dispersion can be used as such in the preparation of a solid catalyst suitable for addition polymerization processes, thereby maintaining the dispersed nature. A range of suitable particle sizes for the solid dispersed catalyst can be obtained by selecting the solvents and nonsolvents, temperature conditions and the specific catalyst components. No intermediate recovery or separation steps are required and the final solid catalyst, preferably still in dispersed form, may be employed as such in an addition polymerization process. Alternatively, the particulate solid (a) and the solid catalyst, and any solid intermediate product, can be recovered from the diluent in which it is dispersed by removing the liquid or nonsolvent employing techniques such as filtration, vacuum drying, spray drying, and combinations thereof. Prior to its use. the paniculate solid (a), the solid catalyst, and any solid intermediate product, may be redispersed in a suitable liquid diluent.<br>
The catalyst component dispersion of the present invention can be prepared by converting a solution of the ionic compound (a), in a diluent (solvent) in which (a) is soluble, into a dispersion comprising component (a) in solid form.<br>
Ii may be desirable to use a method wherein the converting is done in the presence of (b) a transition metal compound and wherein the catalyst component is a substantially inactive catalyst percursor; or wherein the converting is done in the presence of (c) an organometal or metalloid compound wherein the metal or metalloid is selected from the Groups 1 -14 of the Periodic Table of the Elements and the catalyst component is a reaction product of (a) and (c), or, alternatively, it may be desirable to employ the method such that the catalyst component excludes (b) a transidon metal compound, excludes (c) an organometal or metalloid compound wherein the metal or metalloid is selected from the Groups 1-14 of the Periodic Table of the Elements, or excludes both (b) and (c).<br>
A solution of ionic compound (a) in a diluent can be obtained by using an ippropriale solvent in which (a) is soluble. The diluent in which (a) is dissolved is not critical. Preferably, the diluent is compatible with the other catalyst components and<br><br>
under polymeri2ation conditions, so that it does not need to be removed prior to its further use. Suitable solvents for (a) include aromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene, benzene, ethylbenzene. propylbenzene, butylbenzene. xylenes, chlorobenzene, and the like.<br>
When a solvent is used in which (a) is not sufficiently soluble, or in order to assist in or speed up dissolution of (a), heating may be applied or solubilizing agents may be used, or a combination of both. The solubilizing agent to be used is compatible with ihe catalyst components, in a sense chat it does not adversely affect the beneficial properties of the catalyst. Heating is preferably done at temperatures not higher than the decomposition temperature of (a). During the dissolution of (a) stirring is advantageously applied,<br>
Preferably, the solution of (a) contains from 0.0001 to 100 mole of (a) per liter, more preferably from 0.001 to 10 mole per liter. Any nondissolved (a) is preferably removed by. for example, filtration techniques, prior to further using the solution of (a).<br>
The solution of (a) is then converted into a dispersion comprising (a) in solid form. The conversion of the solution of (a) to a dispersion of (a) can be carried out. for example, by a process wherein the dispersion comprising component (a) is generated by cooling a solution of (a) in a diluent in which (a) is soluble, by contacting a solution of (a) in a diluent in which (a) is soluble with a diluent in which (a) is insoluble or sparingly soluble, by evaporating diluent from a solurion of (a), by adding one or more precipitating agents to a solution of (a), or a combinauon of two or more of these techniques, to achieve a controlled precipitation or solidification such that a dispersion of (a) is formed. It will be clear to a person skilled in the art that the distinction between a solvent and a nonsolvenl for a particular ionic compound (a) will primarily depend on the nature of the particular compound (a), on the temperature, and relative amount of (a) to be dissolved. For a given ionic compound (a), the skilled person can easily determine what solvent and temperamre conditions are to be used to obtain a solurion of the desired concentration, On the other hand, given the solution of (a), the<br><br>
skilled person can easily determine the conditions and means to obtain the dispersion of (a) having the desired solids concentration.<br>
When precipitating agents are used, they are preferably compatible with the catalyst components, such that the beneficial properties of the catalyst are not adversely affected.<br>
The nonsolvent employed for generating the dispersion of (a) is not critical. Preferably, the nonsolvent is compatible with the other catalyst components and under polymerization conditions, so that it does not need to be removed prior to further use. Preferred nonsolvents are, for example, pentane, hexane, heptane, decane. dodecane, kerosene, and higher aliphatic hydrocarbons of up to 30 carbon atoms.<br>
The dispersion comprising component (a) is preferably generated by contacting a solution of (a) in a diluent in which (a) is soluble with a diluent in which (a) is insoluble or sparingly soluble. The diluent in which (a) is soluble is preferably selected from the group consisting of toluene, benzene, and xylenes, and the diluent in which (a) is insoluble or sparingly soluble is preferably selected from the group consisting of pentane, hexane, heptane, and octane.<br>
In contacting the solution of (a) with the nonsolvent, the amount of nonsolvent is usually lOio 10,000 parts by weight, preferably 100 to 1,000 parts by weight per i 00 parts by weight of the solution of (a). The contacting temperature is usually from -100 to 300°C, preferably from -50 to 130 °C, and most preferably from 10 to n0°C.<br>
When the solvent, in which (a) is dissolved, needs to be removed after contacting with the nonsolvent, the solvent is preferably selected so that it has a lower boiling point than that of the nonsolvent. The solvent can then be easily removed by healing the dispersion or by applying reduced pressure.<br>
The solid catalysts, eidier supported or nonsupported, according lo the present invention can be prepared by combining, in any order, components (a), (b), (c), and optionally (d) in case of a supported catalyst, wherein during at least one step in the preparation of the solid catalyst, component (a) dissolved in a diluent in which (a) is<br><br>
soluble, optionally in the presence of one or more of components (b), (c), and (d) or the contact product of (a) with one or more of (b), (c), and (d), is converted into solid form, optionally followed by recovering the solid catalyst. After this step the other components (b), {c) and optionally (d), to the extent they have not been added before, are contacted with (a) in solid form, preferably dispersed in solid form.<br>
According to an aspect of this invention, the methodology of which is similar to that described above for the preparation of dispersions of catalyst components, it is desirable ihat during the at least one step in the preparation of the solid catalyst, a dispersion comprising component (a) in solid form is generated by cooling a solution of (a) in a diluent in which (a) is soluble, by contacting a solution of (a) in a diluent in which (ai is soluble with a diluent in which (a) is insoluble or sparingly soluble, by evaporating diluent from a solution of (ai, by adding one or move precipitating agents to a solution of (a'l, or a combination of two or more of these techniques.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment for the preparation of the nonsupported or supponed solid catalyst, during the at least one step in the preparation of the solid catalyst, a dispersion comprising component (a) in solid form is generated by contacting a solution of (a) in a diluent in which (a) is soluble, optionally in the presence of one or more of components (b), (c). and (d) or the contact product of (a) with one or more of (b), (c), and (d), with a diluent in which (a) is insoluble or sparingly soluble.<br>
In all the process steps subsequent to the dispersion formation step, it is preferred not to use temperature conditions or types or quantities of solvents that would redissolve compound (a). The methods that can be used to generate the dispersion of (a) are essentially those which have been described above in relation to the formation of the catalyst component dispersion.<br>
In the method for preparing the nonsupported or supported solid catalyst, the dispersion comprising component (a) can be formed first whereupon the other components (b). (c), and optionally (d) can be combined in arbitrary order. Further, the dispersion comprising component (a) can be formed in the presence of one or more<br><br>
of the other components (b), (c) and optionally (d). Exemplary embodiments are given below.<br>
In one embodiment for preparing the nonsupported or supported solid catalyst, the dispersion comprising component (a) is first contacted with component (b) and the resulting product is subsequently contacted with component (c). Component (b) is preferably employed dissolved in a suitable solvent, such as a hydrocarbon solvent, advantageously a C5-IQ aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon or a C.\Q aromatic hydrocarbon. The contact temperature is not critical provided it is below the decomposition temperature of the transition metal. Component (c) can be used in a neat form, that is. as is, or dissolved in a hydrocarbon solvent, which may be similar to the one used for dissolving component (b).<br>
In a funher embodiment for preparing the nonsupported or supported solid catalyst, components (b) and (c) are first contacted, preferably in a suitable solvent, and then contacting the resulting product with the dispersion comprising component (a). The solvent or solvents used for contacting (b) and (c) are of such nature or are used in such quantities, or a combination thereof, that when the resulting product is contacted with the dispersion comprising (a), component (a) is not substantially redissoived.<br>
In some of the methods of preparing a supported solid catalyst, including the precipitation methods described above, the manner in which component (d) is added is not critical. Component (d) can be added during one of the steps in the preparation of the solid catalyst. The support material (d) can be added after the components (a), (b), and (c) have been combined with each other, or (d) can be combined with at least one of the components prior to combining the resulting product with the remaining component or components.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment for the preparation of a supported solid catalyst, component (a) dissolved in a solvent is first combined with component (d), whereupon a dispersion of (a) is generated in the manner as described above in relation to the generation of the dispersion of (a). The combining of component (d) with the<br><br>
solution of component (a) may be carried out while forming a slurry, that is. using an excess amount ol liquid, or alternatively, only so much of the solution of component (a) is used that no slurry is formed. Advantageously in the latter situation, the volume of the solution of component (a) does not exceed substantially, and is preferably about equal to, the pore volume of component (d). After this contacting step, coiitponenl (a) is converted into solid form, preferably by combining the contact product of (a) and (d) with a diluent in which (a) is insoluble or sparingly soluble. The amount of solids relative to the amount of nonsolvent is not critical but typically is from 0.001 to 50 weight percent.<br>
When component (d) is contacted with a solution of (a), (d) is preferably used after it has been pretreated to remove substantially all water and surface hydroxyl groups, and especially by treatment with an aluminumalkyl, more preferably with an aluminumtriaikyl compound. It is advantageous to contact the solution of (a) with component (c), preferably with one molar equivalent of (c), prior to contacting the same with component (d). A highly preferred support material for use in these embodiments is pretreated silica.<br>
Typical, yet not critical, temperatures for any of the steps except the dispersion formation step are -50 to 150°C. Preferably, each of the contacting steps is carried out while stirring or agitating. All steps in the present process should be conducted in the absence of oxygen and moisture.<br>
In an alternative method for the preparation of solid supported catalysts, it is desirable that the support material used is a pretreated support material with a pore volume of from 0.1 to 5 cm/g and in the supported catalyst the anion (a)(2) is not chemically bonded to the support (d), and wherein the volume of the solution of (a), optionally in the presence of one or both of (b) and (c), is from 20 volume percent to 200 volume percent of the total pore volume of the support material used. Preferred embodiments are those wherein the volume of the solution is from 70 volume percent to i 30 volume percent of the total pore volume of the support material used, or wherein the volume of the solution is substantially equal to the total pore volume of the support material used. Some aspects of this method may be similar to various<br><br>
aspects ol processes for the preparation of supported catalyst, variously refened to as incipient impregnation or incipient wetness techniques, as disclosed in U.S. Patents No.'s 5.602,067: 5.625.015; and PCT applications WO-95/12622; WO-96/23005; WO-96/16093; WO-97y02397; and WO-97/24375, ail of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
In attemative aspects of this embodiment, as mentioned in the two paragraphs immediately above, it may be desirable that the solution of (a) is produced in the presence of (b), or in the presence of (c), or in the presence of (b) and (c).<br>
Generally, in this aspect it is desirable that the solid catalyst is produced by adding the solution of (a), optionaily containing one or both of (b) and (c), to substantially dr\' pretreated support material, followed by removal of the diluent.<br>
In another alternative for the preparation of the supported catalyst, it is desirable that the support material used is a pretreated support material with a pore volume of from 0.1 to 5 cm/g and in the supported catalyst the anion (a)(2) is not chemically bonded to the support (d), and wherein the volume of the solution of (a), optionally in the presence of one or both of (b) and (c), is greater than 200 volume percent of the total pore volume of the support material used. In alternative aspects of this embodiment- it may be desirable that the solution of (a) is produced in the presence of (b), or in the presence of (c), or in the presence of (b) and (c). In this aspect it may be desirable that the solid catalyst is produced by adding Uie solution of (a), optionally containing one or both of (b) and (c), to substantially dry pretreated support material, followed by removal of the diluent, or it may be added to a slurry of (d) in a diluent, followed by removal of the diluent.<br>
The nonsupported or supported solid catalyst may be stored or shipped in free flowing form under inert conditions after removal of the solvent.<br>
The combining of components (a) and (b) in equimolar amounts does not result in a catalyst composition that has substantial activity in addition polymerization<br>
processes. Upon combining this composidon with component (c) an active catalyst<br><br>
composition is surprisingly formed. Therefore, a further embodiment provides a method for activating a substantially inactive catalyst precursor to form a catalyst suitable for addition polymerization wherein a substantially inactive catalyst precursor comprising an ionic compound (a) and a transition metal compound (b) and. optionally, component (d). is contacted with organometal compound (c) to form an active catalyst. In one aspect, preferably, the substantially inactive catalyst precursor is in a solid form, either supported or nonsupported, more preferably dispersed in a diluent, while in an alternative aspect wherein no support is used all the materials are used in solution form and the activation process produced a homogenous solution of a catalyst suitable for solution polymerization.<br>
Preferably, according to this activating method, a dispersion of a nonsupported or supported solid substantially inactive catalyst precursor, comprising (a),(b) and optionally (d), and the organometal compound (c) are each separately added, preferably directly, into an addition polymerization reactor containing addition poiymerizable monomer or monomers, preferably under addition polymerizable conditions. The catalys': components can be added separately to the reactor or to specific locations in the reactor which enables the catalyst to be activated only in the reactor or in a specific location in the reactor, which offers a more controllable polymerization reaction. This is especially advantageous where the addition polymerization reactor is operated under slurry phase or gas phase polymerization conditions.<br>
The relative amounts of the components to be used in the compositions and processes of the present invention will now be described. The relative amount of ionic compound (a) to gramatoms of transition metal in compound (b), is not critical but generally is in the range from 0.1 to 500 mole of (a) per gramatoms of (b). Preferably, 0,5 to 100 mole of (a) per gramatoms of (b) is used, most preferably from about I to 3 mole of (a) per gramatoms of (b).<br>
The ratio between organometal compound (c) and the ionic compound (a) is not critical, but generally lies within the range of 0.05 to 1,000 mole of (c) per mole of<br><br>
(a). Preferably, the ratio is from 0.5 to 100 mole (c) per mole (a), most preferably from about 1 to 50 mole (c) per mole (a).<br>
The amount of optional component (d) to be used in the present invention is also not critical, however, typical values range from 0.1 imo! to 2 mmoi of ionic compound (a) per gram of support material. Preferably, from [0 to 1,000 \imol of ionic compound (a) is used per gram of support material.<br>
The solid catalyst can be used as such or after being subjected to prepolymerization. The prepolymerization can be carried out by any known methods such as by bringing a small amount of one or more polymerizable monomers into contact with the solid catalyst. The monomers which can be used in the prepolymerization are not particularly limited and include the olefins and dioiefins mentioned hereinafter. It is preferable to use for the prepolymerization the same monomer as used in the subsequent polymerization. The prepolymerization temperature may usually range from -20°C to 100 °C , preferably from -10 to 70 °C , more preferably from 0 to 50 "C.<br>
The prepolymerization may be carried out batchwise or continuously under atmospheric pressure or elevated pressures. The prepolymerization may be carried out in the presence of a molecular weight controlling agent such as hydrogen. The prepolymerization is carried out in the absence or presence of a solvent or diluent. When a solvent or diluent is used it is preferably an inert hydrocarbon, such as the ones described hereinafter with respect to the polymerization process. Preferably the solvent or diluent used does not substantially redissolve the solid catalyst comprising ionic compound (a). The prepolymerization is typically carried out to form a prepolymerized catalyst, that is polymer is formed on the solid catalyst particles, having from 0.1 to 100 g of polymer per 1 g of solid catalyst, preferably from 1 to 10 g of polymer per g of solid catalyst. Typical particle sizes of prepolymerized catalysts are in the range of 1 to 200 p.m, preferably in the range from 10 to 100 (im.<br>
The solid catalysts of the present invention, optionally prepolymerized, may be used in an addition polymerization process wherein one or more addition<br><br>
polymerjzabie monomers are contacted with the solid catalyst of the invention under addition polymerization conditions.<br>
Suitable addition polymerizable monomers include ethylenicaily unsaturated monomers, acetylenic compounds, conjugated or nonconjugated dienes, polyenes, and carbon monoxide. Preferred monomers include olefins, for examples alpha-olefins having from 2 to about 20, preferably from about 2 to about 12, more preferably from about 2 to about 8 carbon atoms and combinations of two or more of such alpha-olefins. Particularly suitable alpha-olefins include, for example, ethylene, propylene, i-butene. l-pentene,4-methylpentene-l, l-hexene, l-heptene, 1-octene, 1-nonene, 1-decene, 1-undecene,<br>
l-dodecene. l-tridecene, l-tetradecene, i-pentadecene, or combinations thereof. Preferably, the aipha-oiefins are ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, 4-methyl-pentene-l, 1 -pentene. 1 -hexene, 1 -octene, and combinations of ethylene andJor propylene with one or more of such other alpha-olefins. Most preferably, ethylene or propylene is used as one of the addition polymerizable monoiners. Suitable dienes include those having from 4 to 30 carbon atoms, especially those having 5 to 18 carbon atoms. Typical of these are a.co -dienes, a-internal dienes, including those dienes which are typically used for preparing EPDM type elastomers. Typical examples include 1,3-butadiene. 1,3-and 1,4-pentadiene, 1,3-, 1,4-, and 1,5-hexadiene, 1,7-octadiene, 1.9-decadiene, and lower alkyl substituted analogues of any of these. Other preferred monomers include styrene, halo- or alkyl substituted styrenes, tetrafluoroethylene, vinylcyclobutene. dicyclopentadiene, and ethyhdene norbomenes. Suitable addition polymerizable monomers include also any mixtures of the above-mentioned monomers.<br>
The solid catalyst can be formed in situ in the polymerization mixture by introducing into the mixture the catalyst components (a), (b), (c), and optionally (d).<br>
The solid catalysts of this invention, both supported and nonsupported, as well as the homogeneous catalysts, may be used in various catalysts systems, either alone or with other catalyst components or other catalysts, where the catalyst of this invention is an integral part of the catalyst system.<br><br>
The catalyst may be used in the polymerization reaction in a concentration of 10' to 10 ■' moles, based on transition metal, per liter diluent or reaction volume, but is preferably used in a concentration of less than 10", preferably from 10' to 9x10" moles per liter diluent or reaction volume.<br>
The solid catalysts can be advantageously employed in a high pressure, solution, slurry, or gas phase polymerization process. For a solution polymerization process it is desirable to redissolve the solid catalyst or to employ homogeneous solutions of the catalyst components. A high pressure process is usually carried out at temperatures from 100°C to 400°C and at pressures above 500 bar. A slurry process typically uses an inert hydrocarbon diluent and temperatures of from about 0°C up to a temperature just below the temperature at which the resulting polymer becomes substantially soluble in the inert polymerization medium. Preferred temperatures are from about 30°C, preferably from about 60°C to about 115°C, preferably to about lOOC. The solution process is carried out at temperatures from the temperature at which the resulting polymer is soluble in an inert solvent up to about 275°C. Generally, solubility of the polymer depends on its density. For ethylene copolymers having densities of 0.86 g/cm', solution polymerization may be achieved at temperatures as low as about 60°C. Preferably, solution polymerization temperatures range from about 75°C , more preferably from about 80°C. and typically from about I30°C to about 260°C. more preferably to about 170°C. Most preferably, temperatures in a solution process are between about SCC and 150°C. As inert solvents typically hydrocarbons and preferably aliphatic hydrocarbons are used. The solution and slurry processes are usually carried out at pressures between about 1 to 100 bar. Typical operating conditions for gas phase polymerizations are from 20°C to 100°C. more preferably from 40°C to SCC. In gas phase processes the pressure is typically from subatmospheric to 100 bar.<br>
Preferably for use in gas phase polymerization processes, the solid catalyst has a median particle diameter from about 20 to about 200 jtm, more preferably from about 30 (jm to about 150 m, and most preferably from about 50 pm to about 100 }im. Preferably for use in slurry polymerization processes, the support has a median<br><br>
particle diameter from about 1 pm to about 200 fini. more preferably from about 5 fxm to about 100 urn. and most preferably from about 10 fjm to about 80 (jm. Preferably for use in solution or high pressure polymerizalion processes, the support has a median particle diameter from about 1 pm to about 40 }xm, more preferably from about 2 pm to about 30 pm, and most preferably from about 3 |im to about 20 fim.<br>
In the polymerizalion processes of the present invention impurity scavengers may be used which serve to protect the solid catalyst from catalyst poisons such as water, oxygen, and polar compounds. These scavengers can generally be used in amounts depending on the amounts of impurities. Typical scavengers include organometal compounds, and preferably trialkylaluminum or boron compounds and alumoxanes. Further, antistatic agents may be introduced into the reactor to prevent agglomeration or sticking of polymer or catalyst to the reactor walls.<br>
In the present polymerization processes also molecular weight control agents can be used, such as hydrogen or other chain transfer agents. The polymers that are prepared according to such polymerization process may be combined with any conventional additives, such as UV stabilizers, antioxidants, anti-slip or anti-blocking agents, which may be added in conventional ways, for example, downstream of the polymerization reactor, or in an extrusion or molding step.<br>
Upon or after removal of the polymerization mixture or product of from the polymerization reactor, the supported catalyst may be deactivated by exposure to air or water, or through any other catalyst deactivating agent or procedure.<br>
Suitable solvents for the various polymerization processes are inert liquids. Examples include straight and branched-chain hydrocarbons such as isobutane, butane, pentane, hexane. heptane, octane, and mixtures thereof; cyclic and alicyciic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane, cycloheptane, methylcyclohexane, methylcycloheptane, and mixtures thereof; perfluorinated hydrocarbons such as perfluorinated C4_|o alkanes, and the like and aromatic and alky]-substituted aromatic compounds such as benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene and the like. Suitable solvents also include liquid olefins which may act as monomers or comonomers<br><br>
including ethylene, propylene, butadiene. 1-butene, cyclopentene, 1-hexene, i-heptene. 4-vinylcyciohexene, vinylcyclohexane, 3-methyl-i-pentene, 4-methyl-l-pentene. 1.4-hexadiene, l-octene, 1-decene, styrene, divinylbenzene, allylbenzene, vinyltoluene (including all isomers alone or in admixture), and the like. Mixtures of the foregoing are also suitable.<br>
The catalyst systems may be utilized in combination with at least one additional homogeneous or heterogeneous polymerization catalyst in separate reactors connected in series or in parallel to prepare polymer blends having desirable properties. An example of such a process is disclosed in WO-94/00500, equivalent to U.S. Serial Number 07/904,770, as well as U.S. Serial Number 08/10958, filed January 29, 1993, the teachings of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Utilizing the catalyst systems of the present invention, particularly for solution polymerization, copolymers having high comonomer incorporation and correspondingly low density, yet having a low melt index may be readily prepared. That is, high molecular weight polymers are readily attained by use of the present catalysts even at elevated reactor temperatures. This result is highly desirable because the molecular weight of a-olefin copolymers can be readily reduced by the use of hydrogen or similar chain transfer agent, however increasing the molecular weight of a-olefin copolymers is usually only attainable by reducing the polymerization temperature of the reactor. Disadvantageously, operation of a polymerization reactor at reduced temperatures significantly increases the cost of operation since heat must be removed from the reactor to maintain the reduced reaction temperature, while at the same time heat must be added to the reactor effluent to vaporize the solvent. In addition, productivity is increased due to improved polymer solubility, decreased solution viscosity, and a higher polymer concentration. Utilizing the present catalysts, a-olefin homopolymers and copolymers having densities from 0.85 g/cm to 0.96 g/cm-, and melt flow rates from O.OOI to 10.0 dg/min are readily attained in a high temperature process.<br>
The solid catalysts of the present invention, also when used in a slurry process or gas phase process, not only are able to produce ethylene copolymers of densities<br><br>
typical for high density polyethylene, in the range of 0.980 to 0.940 g/cm"\ but surprisingly, also enable the production of copolymers having substantially lower densities. Copolymers of densities lower than 0.940 g/cm and especially lower than 0.930 g/cm" down to 0.880 g/cm' or tower can be made while providing free flowing polymers, retaining good bulk density properties and while preventing or substantially eliminating reactor fouling. The present invention is capable of producing olefin polymers and copolymers having weight average molecular weights of more than 30,000, preferably more than 50,000, most preferably more than 100,000 up to 1,000,000 and even higher. Typical molecular weight distributions Mv/Mn range from 1.5 to 15, or even higher, preferably between 2.0 and 8.0.<br>
The catalyst systems of the present invention are particularly advantageous for the production of ethylene homopolymers and ethylene/a-olefin copolymers having high levels of long chain branching, especially in solution polymerizations and in gas phase polymerization processes. The use of the catalyst systems of the present invention in continuous polymerization processes, especially continuous, solution polymerizauon processes, allows for elevated reactor temperatures which favor the formation of vinyl terminated polymer chains that may be incorporated into a growing polymer, thereby giving a long chain branch. The use of the present catalysts system advantageously allows for the economical production of ethylene/a-olefin copolymers having processability similar to high pressure, free radical produced low density polyethylene.<br>
In another aspect of the processes of this invention, a preferred process is a high temperature solution polymerization process for the polymerization of olefins comprising contacting one or more C2-2O ct-olefms under polymerization conditions with a catalyst system of this invendon at a temperahire from about lOOC to about 250°C. More preferred as a temperature range for this process is a temperamre from about 120°C to about 200°C, and even more preferred is temperature from about I50=C to about ZOOC.<br>
The present catalysts system may be advantageously employed to prepare olefin polymers having improved processing propenies by polymerizing ethylene alone<br><br>
or ethylene/a-olefin mixtures with low levels of a "H" branch inducing diene, such as norbomadiene. 1.7-octadiene, or 1,9-decadiene. The unique combination of elevated reactor temperamres. high molecular weight (or low melt indices) at high reactor temperatures and high comonomer reactivity advantageously allows for the economical production of polymers having excellent physical properties and processability. Preferably such polymers comprise a Ci,.2Q a-olefin, including ethylene, and a "H'-branching comonomer. Preferably, such polymers are produced in a solution process, most preferably a continuous solution process. Alternatively, such polymers may be produced in a gas phase process or a slurry process, as disclosed in U. S. Application Serial No. 08/857817 filed May 16, 1997; U.S. Application No. 08/857816 filed May 16, 1997; and PCT Application No. PCT/US97/08466 filed May 16, 1997. all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
As previously mentioned, the present catalyst system is particularly useful in the preparation of EP and EPDM copolymers in high yield and productivity. The process employed may be either a solution or slurry process both of which are previously known in the art. Kaminsky, J.Poly.Sci.. Vol. 23, pp. 2151-64 (1985) reported the use of a soluble bis(cyclopentadienyl) zirconium dimethyl-alumoxane catalyst system for solution polymerization of EP and EPDM elastomers. U.S. 5.229,478 disclosed a slurry polymerization process utilizing similar bis(cyclopentadienyl) zirconium based catalyst systems.<br>
In general terms, it is desirable to produce such EP and EPDM elastomers under conditions of increased reactivity of the diene monomer component. Hie reason for this was explained in the above-identified '478 patent in the following manner, which still remains true despite the advances attained in such reference. A major factor affecting production costs and hence the utility of an EPDM is the diene monomer cost. The diene is a more expensive monomer material than ethylene or propylene. Further, the reactivity of diene monomers with previously known metallocene catalysts is lower than that of ethylene and propylene. Consequently, to achieve the requisite degree of diene incorporation to produce an EPDM with an acceptably fast cure rate, it has been necessary to use a diene monomer concentration which, expressed as a percentage of the total concentration of monomers present, is in<br><br>
subslantiai excess compared to the percentage of diene desired to be incorporated into the final EPDM product. Since substantial amounts of unreacted diene monomer n:iust be recovered from the polymerization reactor effluent for recycle, the cost of production is increased unnecessarily.<br>
Further adding to the cost of producing an EPDM is the fact that, generally, the exposure of an olefin polymerization catalyst to a diene, especially the high concentrations of diene monomer required to produce the requisite level of diene incorporation in the final EPDM product, often reduces the rate or activity at which the catalyst will cause polymerization of ethylene and propylene monomers to proceed. Correspondingly. lower throughputs and longer reaction limes have been required, compared to the production of an ethylene-propylene copolymer elastomer or other a-olefin copolymer elastomer.<br>
The present catalyst system advantageously allows for increased diene reactivity thereby preparing EPDM polymers in high yield and productivity. Additionally, the catalyst system of the present invention achieves the economical production of EPDM polymers with diene contents of up to 20 weight percent or higher, which polymers possess highly desirable fast cure rates.<br>
The nonconjugated diene monomer can be a straight chain, branched chain or cyclic hydrocarbon diene having from about 6 to about 15 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable nonconjugated dienes are straight chain acyclic dienes such as 1,4-hexadiene and 1,6-octadiene; branched chain acyclic dienes such as 5-methyl'l,4-hexadietie; 3,7-dimethyl- i ,6-octadiene; 3,7-dimethyl-1,7-octadiene and mixed isomers of dihydromyricene and dihydroocinene; single ring alicyclic dienes such as 1,3-cyclopentadiene; 1,4-cyclohexadiene; 1,5-cyclooctadiene and 1,5-cyciododecadiene; and multi-ring alicyclic fused and bridged ring dienes such as tetrahydroindene. methyl tetrahydroindene, dicyclopentadiene; bicyclo-(2,2,l)-hepta-2, 5-diene: alkenyl. alkylidene, cycloalkenyl and cycloalkylJdene norbomenes such as 5-methylene-2-norbomene (MNB); 5-propenyl-2-norbomene, 5-isopropylidene-2-norbomene, 5-(4-cyclopentenyl)-2-norbomene. 5-cyclohexyl!dene-2-norbomene, 5-vinyl-2-norbomene and norbomadiene.<br><br>
Of the dienes typically used to prepare EPDMs, the particularly preferred dienes are 1,4-hexadiene (HD), 5-ethylidene-2-norbomene (ENB), 5-vinytidene-2-norbomene (VNB), 5-methylene-2-norbomene (MNB), and dicyciopentadiene (DCPD). The especially preferred dienes are 5-ethylidene-2-norbomene (ENB) and 1,4-hexadiene (HD).<br>
The preferred EPDM elastomers may contain about 20 up to about 90 weight percent ethylene, more preferably about 30 to 85 weight percent ethylene, most preferably about 35 to about 80 weight percent ethylene.<br>
The alpha-oiefins suitable for use in the preparation of elastomers with ethylene and dienes are preferably CT,.\Q alpha-oiefins. Illustrative nonlimiting examples of such aipha-olefins are propylene, 1-bulene, 1-pentene. l-hexene,4-methy]-I-pentene. 1-heptene. 1-octene. 1-decene, and 1-dodecene. The alpha-olefin is generaiiy incorporated into the EPDM polymer at about 10 lo about 80 weight percent, more preferably at about 20 to about 65 weight percent. The nonconjugated dienes are generally incorporated into the EPDM at about 0.5 to about 20 weight percent; more, preferably at about I to about 15 weight percent, and most preferably at 3 to about 12 weight percent. If desired, more than one diene may be incorporated simultaneously, for example HD and ENB, with total diene incorporation within the limits specified above.<br>
At all times, the individual ingredients as well as the recovered catalyst components must be protected from oxygen and moisture. Therefore, the catalyst components and catalysts must be prepared and recovered in an oxygen and moisture-free atmosphere. Preferably, therefore, the reactions are performed in the presence of a dry, inert gas such as, for example, nitrogen.<br>
The polymerization may be carried out as a batchwise or a continuous polymerization process. A continuous process is preferred, in which event catalyst components, ethylene, a-olefin, and optionally solvent and diene are continuously supplied to the reaction zone and polymer product continuously removed therefrom. Within the scope of the terms "continuous" and "continuously" as used in this context are those processes in which there are intermittent additions of reactants and removal<br><br>
of products at small regular intervals, so that, over time, the overall process is continuous.<br>
In a preferred manner of operation, the polymerization is conducted in a continuous solution polymerization system comprising two reactors connected in series or parallel. In one reactor a relatively high molecular weight product (Mw from 300,000 to 600.000, more preferably 400,000 to 500,000) is formed while in the second reactor a product of a relatively low molecular weight (Mw 50,000 to 300,000) is formed. The final product is a blend of the two reactor effluents which are combined prior to devolatiiization to result in a uniform blend of the two polymer products. Such a dual reactor process allows for the preparation of products having improved propenies. In a preferred embodiment the reactors are connected in series, that is effluent from the firsi reactor is charged to the second reactor and fresh monomer, solvent and hydrogen is added to the second reactor. Reactor conditions are adjusted such that the weight ratio of polymer produced in the first reactor to that produced in the second r.actor is from 20:80 to 80:20. In addition the temperature of the second reactor is con'joiled to produce the lower molecular weight product. This system beneficially allow for production of EPDM products having a large range of Mooney viscosities, as well as excellent strength and processability. Preferably the Mooney viscosity (ASTMD1646-94,MLi+4 @125°C) of the resulting product is adjusted to fall in the range from I to 200, preferably from 5 to 150 and most preferably from 10 to 110.<br>
The polymerization process of the present invention can be employed to advantage in the gas phase copolymerization of olefins. Gas phase processes for the polymerization of olefins, especially the homopolymerization and copolymerization of ethylene and propylene, and the copolymerization of ethylene with higher a-olefins such as, for example, 1-butene, I-hexene, 4-methyl-l-penteneareweHknown in the art. Such processes are used commercially on a large scale for the manufacture of high density polyethylene (HDPE), medium density polyethylene (MDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) and polypropylene.<br><br>
The gas phase process employed can be. for example, of the type which employs a mechanically stirred bed or a gas fluidized bed as the polymerization reaction zone. Prefened is the process wherein the polymerizalion reaction is carried out in a vertical cylindrical polymerization reactor containing a fluidized bed of polymer particles supported or suspended above a perforated plate, the fluidization grid, by a flow of fluidization gas.<br>
The gas employed to fluidize the bed comprises the monomer or monomers to be polymerized, and also serves as a heat exchange medium to remove the heat of reaction from the bed. The hot gases emerge from the top of the reactor, normally via a tranquilization zone, also known as a velocity reduction zone, having a wider diameter than the fluidized bed and wherein fine particles entrained in the gas stream have an opportunity to gravitate back into the bed. It can also be advantageous to use a cyclone to remove ultra-fine particles from the hot gas stream. The gas is then normally recycled to the bed by means of a blower or compressor and one or more heat exchangers to strip the gas of the heat of polymerization.<br>
A preferred method of cooling of the bed, in addition to the cooling provided by the cooled recycle gas, is to feed a volatile liquid to the bed to provide an evaporative cooling effect, often referred to as operation in the condens-ing mode. The volatile liquid employed in this case can be, for example, a volatile inert liquid, for example, a saturated hydrocarbon having about 3 to about 8, preferably 4 to 6, carbon atoms. In the case that the monomer or comonomer itself is a volatile liquid, or can be condensed to provide such a liquid, this can suitably be fed to the bed to provide an evaporative cooling effect. Examples of olefin monomers which can be employed in this manner are olefins containing about three to about eight, preferably three to six carbon atoms. The volatile liquid evaporates in the hoi fluidized bed to form gas which mixes with the fluidizing gas. If the volatile liquid is a monomer or comonomer, it will undergo some polymerization in the bed. The evaporated liquid then emerges from the reactor as part of the hot recycle gas, and enters the compression/heat exchange part of the recycle loop. The recycle gas is cooled in the heat exchanger and, if the temperature to which the gas is cooled is below the dew point, liquid will precipitate from the gas. This liquid is desirably recycled<br><br>
continuously to the fiuidiied bed. It is possible to recycle the precipitated liquid to the bed as liquid droplets carried in the recycle gas stream. This type of process is described, for example in EP-89691; U.S. 4,543.399; WO-94/25495 and U.S. 5.352.749. which are hereby incorporated by reference. A particularly preferred method of recycling the liquid to the bed is to separate the liquid from the recycle gas stream and to reinject this liquid direcdy into the bed, preferably using a method which generates fine droplets of the liquid within the bed. This type of process is described in BP Chemicals' WO-94/28032, which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The polymerization reaction occurring in the gas fluidized bed is catalyzed by the continuous or semi-continuous addition of catalyst. Such catalyst can be supported on an inorganic or organic support material as described above. The catalyst can also be subjected to a prepolymerization step, for example, by polymerizing a small quantity of olefin monomer in a liquid inert diluent, to provide a catalyst composite comprising catalyst particles embedded in olefin polymer particles.<br>
TTie polvmer is produced directly in the fluidized bed by catalyzed copolymerization of the monomer and one or more comonomers on the fluidized particles of catalyst, supported catalyst or prepolymer within the bed. Start-up of the polymerization reaction is achieved using a bed of preformed polymer particles, which are preferably similar to the target polyolefin, and conditioning the bed by drying with inert gas or nitrogen prior to introducing the catalyst, the monomers and any other gases which it is desired to have in the recycle gas stream, such as a diluent gas, hydrogen chain transfer agent, or an inert condensable gas when operating in gas phase condensing mode. The produced polymer is discharged continuously or discontinuously from the fluidized bed as desired.<br>
The gas phase processes suitable for the practice of this invention are preferably condnuous processes which provide for the continuous supply of reactants to the reaction zone of the reactor and the removal of products from the reacdon zone of the reactor, thereby providing a steady-state environment on the macro scale in the reaction zone of the reactor.<br><br>
Typically, the fiuidized bed of the gas phase process is operated at temperatures greater than SOC. preferably from about 60°C to about 1 LQ°C, more preferably from about 70C to about ! !0°C.<br>
Typically the molar ratio of comonomer to monomer used in the polymerization depends upon the desired density for the composition being produced and is about 0.5 or less. Desirably, when producing materials with a density range of from about 0.91 to about 0,93 the comonomer to monomer ratio is less than 0.2. preferably less than 0.05, even more preferabiy less than 0.02, and may even be less than 0.01. Typically, the ratio of hydrogen to monomer is less than about 0.5, preferably less than 0.2, more preferably less than 0.05, even more preferably less than 0.02 and may even be less thanO.OI.<br>
The above-described ranges of process variables are appropriate for the gas phase process of this invention arid may be suitable for other processes adaptable to the practice of this invention,<br>

For the preferred polyolefm polymer compositions of this invention, which may be produced by the polymerization processes of this invention using the catalyst systems of this invention, the long chain branch is longer than the short chain branch that results from the incorporation of one or more a-olefin comonomers into the polymer backbone. The empirical effect of the presence of long chain branching in the copolymers of this invention is manifested as enhanced Theological properties which<br><br>
are indicated by higher flow activation energies, and greater [21/I2 than expected from the other structural properties of the compositions.<br>
Further, highly preferred polyolefin copolymer compositions of this invention have reverse molecular architecture, that is, there is a molecular weight maximum which occurs in that 50 percent by weight of the composition which has the highest weight percent comonomer content. Even more preferred are polyolefin copolymer compositions which also have long chain branches along the polymer backbone, especially when produced with a catalyst system of this invention having a single metallocene complex of this invention in a single reactor in a process for the polymerization of an a-olefin monomer with one or more olefin comonomers. more especially when the process is a continuous process.<br>
Measurement of comonomer content vs. log molecular weight bv GPC/FTIR<br>
The comonomer content as a function of molecular weight was measured by coupling a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) to a Waters \50°C Gel Permeation Chromatograph (GPC). The setting up, calibration and operation of this system together with the method for data treatment has been described previously (L.J. Rose et al, "Characterisation of Polyethylene Copolymers by Coupled GPC/FTIR" in "Characterisation of Copolymers", Rapra Technology, Shawbury UK. 1995, ISBN 1-85957-048-86.) In order to characterize the degree to which the comonomer is concentrated in the high molecular weight part of the polymer, the GPC/FTIR was used to calculate a parameter named comonomer partition factor, Cpf. Mn and Mw were also determined using standard techniques from the GPC data.<br>
Comonomer Partitioning Factor (GPC-FTIR)<br>
The comonomer partitioning factor Cpf is calculated from GPC/FTIR data. It characterizes the ratio of the average comonomer content of the higher molecular weight fractions to the average comonomer content of the lower molecular weight fractions. Higher and lower molecular weight are defined as being above or below the median molecular weight respectively, that is, the molecular weight distribution is divided into two parts of equal weight. Cpf is calculated from the following equation:<br><br><br>
normalized weight fraction as determined by GPC/FTIR for the n FTIR data points above the median molecular weight, c; is the mole fraction comonomer content and wj is the normalized weight fraction as determined by GPC/FTIR for the m FTIR data      points beiow the median molecular weight. Only those weight fractions, wj or w; which have associated mole fraction comonomer content values are used to calculate CpC- For a valid calculation, it is required that n and m are greater than or equal to 3. FTIR data corresponding to molecular weight fractions below 5,000 are not included in the calculation due to the uncertainties present in such data.<br>
For the poiyolefin copolymer compositions of this invention, Cpf desirably is equal to or greater than 1.10, more desirably is equal to or greater than 1.15, even more desirably is equal to or greater than ! .20, preferably is equal to or greater than 1.30, more preferably is equal to or greater than 1.40, even more preferably is equal to or greater than 1.50. and still more preferably is equal to or greater than 1.60.<br>
ATREF-DV<br>
ATREF-DV has been described in U.S. Patent No. 4,798,081, which is hereby incorporated by reference, and in "Determination of Short-Chain Branching Distributions of Ethylene copolymers by Automated Analytical Temperature Rising Elution Fractionation" (Auto-ATREF), J. of Appl Pol Sci: Applied Polymer Symposium 45. 25-37 (1990). ATREF-DV is a dual detector analytical system that is capable of fraciionaling semi-crystalhne polymers like Linear Low Density Polyethylene (LLDPE) as a function of crystallization temperature while simultaneously estimating the molecular weight of the fractions. With regard to the fractionation, ATREF-DV is analogous to Temperamre Rising Elution Fractionation (TREF) analysis that have been published in the open literature over the past 15 years. The primary difference is that this Analytical - TREF (ATREF) technique is done on a<br><br>
small scale and fractions are not actually isolated. Instead, a typical liquid chromatographic (LC) mass detector, such as an infrared single frequency detector, is used to quantify the crystallinity distribution as a function of elution temperature. This distribution can then be transformed to any number of alternative domains such as short branching frequency, comonomer distribution, or possibly density. Thus, this transformed distribution can then be interpreted according to some structural variable like comonomer content, although routine use of ATREF for comparisons of various LLDPE"s IS often done directly in the elution temperature domain.<br>
To obtain ATREF-DV data, a commercially available viscometer especially adapted for LC analysis, such as a Viskotek™ is coupled with the IR mass detector. Together these two LC detectors can be used to calculate the intrinsic viscosity of the ATREF-DV eluant. The viscosity average molecular weight of a given fraction can then be estimated using appropriate Mark Houwink constants, the corresponding intrinsic \ iscosity, and suitable coefficients to estimate the fractions concentration (dl/g) as it passes through the detectors. Thus, a typical ATREF-DV report will provide the weight fraction polymer and viscosity average molecular weight as a function of elution temperature. Mpf is then calculated using the equation given.<br>
Molecular Weight Partitioning Factor<br>
The molecular weight partitioning factor Mpf is calculated from TREF/DV data. It characterizes the ratio of the average molecular weight of the fractions with high comonomer content to the average molecular weight of the fractions with low comonomer content. Higher and lower comonomer content are defined as being below or above the median elution temperature of the TREF concentration plot respectively, that is, the TREF data is divided into two parts of equal weight. Mpf is calculated from the following equation:<br><br><br>
the normalized weight fraction as determined by ATREF-DV for the n data points in the fractions below the median etution temperature. M; is the viscosity average molecular weight and w; is the normalized weight fraction as determined by ATREF-DV for the m data points in the fractions above the median elution temperature. Only those weight fractions, wj or w; which have associated viscosity average molecular weights greater than zero are used to calculate Mpf. For a valid calculation, it is required that n and m are greater than or equal to 3.<br>
For the polyolefin copolymer compositions of this invention, Mpf desirably is equal to or greater than 1.15, more desirably is equal to or greater than 1.30, even more desirably is equal to or greater than 1.40, preferably is equal to or greater than 1.50, more preferably is equal to or greater than 1.60, even more preferably is equal to or greater than L.70.<br>
Having described the invention the following examples are provided as further illustration thereof and arc not to be construed as limiting. Unless stated to the contrary all parts and percentages are expressed on a weight basis.<br>

Gas Phase Examples<br>
The polymerization examples which follow were carried out in a 13 liter gas phase reactor having a four inch diameter thirty inch long fluidization zone and an eight inch diameter ten inch long velocity reduction zone which are connected by a transition section having tapered walls. Typical operating ranges were 40 to 100°C, 6 to 25 bar total pressure and up to 8 hours reaction time. Ethylene, comonomer, hydrogen and nitrogen entered the bottom of the reactor where they passed through a gas distributor plate. The flow of the gas was 2 to 8 times the minimum particle fluidization velocity. See Fluidization Engineering, 2nd Ed., D. Kunii and O. Levenspiel, 1991. Butterworth-Heinemann. Most of the suspended solids disengaged in the velocity reduction zone. The reactanl gases exited the lop of the velocity reduction zone and passed through a dust filter to remove any fines. The gases then passed through a gas booster pump. The polymer was allowed to accumulate in the reactor over the course of the reaction. The total system pressure was kept constant during iiie reaction by regulating the flow of monomer into the reactor. Polymer was removed from the reactor to a recovery vessel by opening a valve located al the bottom of the fluidization zone. The polymer recovery vessel was kept at a lower pressure than the reactor. The pressures of ethylene, comonomer and hydrogen reported refer to partial pressures.<br>
The mode of reactor operation which was employed is referred to as semi-batch. The catalyst was prepared and loaded into a catalyst injector in an inert<br><br>
atmosphere glovebox. The injector was removed from the glovebox and inserted into the top of the reactor. Appropriate amounts of ethylene, 1 -butene, hydrogen and nitrogen were introduced into the reactor to bring the total pressure to the desired reaction temperature. The catalyst was then injected and the polymer was usually allowed to form for 30 to 90 minutes. The total system pressure was kept constant during the reaction by regulating the flow of monomer into the reactor. Upon completion of the run the reactor was emptied and the polymer powder was collected.<br>
