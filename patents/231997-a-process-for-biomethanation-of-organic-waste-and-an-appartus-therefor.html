				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
  This invention  relates  to  a  proc.ess  and apparatus for biomethanation of organic waste„<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The  disposal  of  municipal   solid  waste  &amp;<br>
orqanic waste presents a serious problem in developing countries because of the harmful environmental effects<br>
associated with it„ known processes consist in introducing the or panic waste into a reactor and the<br>
process of fermentation or digestion takes place in the presence of an inocu„ H disadvantage associated with<br>
such a known process is the formation of scum,, Such a scum 'forms an upper layer" and prevents a further<br>
digestion and release of biogas,, Agitation of the slurry cannot be efficiently effected in view of the<br>
volume o f the slurry„ Thus ,, anotherr method known in the art is that of the pretreatment of the orqanic or<br>
leafy biomass waste,, Thus,, the waste is preshaved and pulverized to effect, a size reduction,, However, such a<br>
step contributes to the end cost of the process,, Thus, the known processes are associated with various<br><br>
limitation such as large area requirement , emission of toxic <br>
material and high energy requirement. Even by adequate shredding <br>
to cut the fibrous portion, the scum formation can be delayed but <br>
not completely eliminated . Continuous stirring of the material <br>
requires additional power and in large scale it is even more difficult to maintain a homogeneous mixture. Periodical removal of the scum is also done in certain designs. Such problems will not arise in the present design since there is extraction of soluble organic material in the initial stage and hence no additional arrangements needed for preventing the floating problem associated with the lighter materials.<br>
OBJECTS  OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
An object of this invention is to propose a novel process and apparatus for biomethanation of organic waste.<br>
      Another object of this invention is to propose a process and apparatus for bimethanation of preparation is not needed which requires a pretreatment process such as shredding to fine particle size and mixing of sold with water.<br><br><br>
Still another object, of this invention is  to propose   a process and apparatus for  biomethanation  of organic  waste  and wherein a scum layer  is  no  longer for med„<br>
Yet  another object of this invention  is  to propose  a process and apparatus for  biomethanation  of organic  waste  and  wherein  the  retention  time   for d iciest ion is reduced,,<br>
A  futhers  object of this invention is t o propose  a process and apparatus for biomethanation  of organic  waste and which operates at. high  total  solids c: o n c e n t. r a t i o n „<br>
A  still further object of this invention  is to propose a process and apparatus for biomethanation of organic waste which utilizes a low water requirement  in comparison to the conventional apparatuses,,<br>
Yet a  further object of this invention is to propose  a process and apparatus for  biomethanation  of organic  waste  which produces a  high  quality  organic manure<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF. THE_ INVENTION<br>
According to this in vent, ion there is provided<br>
a process for the biomethanation of organic waste which comprises in a first, step of disgestion of the organic<br>
waste in the presence of water to extract the organic acids. in the absence of the addition of microbes to<br>
the biomass, subjecting the leachate obtained by the first step of digestion to a second step of digestion in<br>
the presence of methanogenic consortium to obtain methane a as,,<br>
Further ace:: or ding to this invention there  is<br>
provided an apparatus for carrying out the process of biomethanation of organic: waste comprising a solid bed<br>
reactor having an inlet for introduction of water to produce a leachate comprising essentially of organic<br>
acids. a storage tank for receiving the leachate and wherein the pH of the leachate is ad lusted to a<br>
neutral pH,, a second reactor for receiving said leachate from the storage tank,, said second reactor having a<br>
gas outlet,,<br>
In ace: or dance with this invention,, the organic waste material is packed into a solid bed reactor. In distinction to the known art, the solid<br><br>
waste material does not require a ore treat merit of shaving and pulverization. Water is introduced into the<br>
reactor at. a controlled rate of 0=5 1/m to 1,,5 1/m. The leachate from the reactor is fed to a tank through a<br>
collector. and where the pH is raised by addition of alkali. The 1eachate is then fed to an up flow<br>
anaerobic sludge blanket reactor and wherein a digestion is caused in the presence of an inoculum.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO DRAWINGS<br>
Further   objects  and  advantages  of   this invention  will  be  more  apparent  "from  the   ensuing description   when   read  in   conjunction   with   the accompanying drawings and wherein s<br>
shows a schematic view of the apparatus for carrying  out. the process of the present invention, and<br>
Fig,, 2     shows the solid bed reactor  employed in  the apparatus of fig,, 1,,<br>
Referring   to   the   drawings,   and   with<br>
particular reference to fig,, 1 , the apparatus comprises <br>
solid  bed reactor' 1 for digestion of the leafy  biomass<br>
waste,,  Microbes are not introduced into reactor .1.  and,,<br><br>
instead the microbes Present in the biomass is used  for<br>
the  step  of  digestion.  Water  is  added  to  reactor" through  a  spray  la  so as  to  enhance  the  leaching<br>
process,,   The  step  of digestion is  continued  for  a period  of  approximately  7  days  and  till the  acid<br>
concentration  and  COD  becomes constant.  The leachate formed by the step of digestion essentially consists of<br>
organic acids which is introduced into collector 2  from reactor .1 <br>
The  leachate from collector 2 is  introduced<br>
into a storage tank 3 and  where the pH is  increased to a   neutral pH „  Though  fig,, 1 illustrates a  collector<br>
2.,  the  leachate  from  reactor  1.  may  be  introduced directly  to  collector 3 from reactor 1„  A pump  4  is<br>
connected  to  the outlet of storage tank 3   so  as  to pump the effluent to  an up flow anaerobic, sludge blanket<br>
reactor  5  in which microbes are introduced  so  as  to produce   methane  gas  The  microbes  introduced  into<br>
reactor 5 are methanogenic  consortium<br>
Reactor" 5 has a lied 6 of stone chips so as to uniformly distribute the effluent or leachate within<br>
said reactor,, When leachate is introduced through inlet 12 of reactor 5,, microbes act on it so as to cause a<br>
further  step  of  deoradation ,,  and  the  organic  acid<br><br>
present in the leachate further breaks down into methane gas and CO2 which escape through outlet 8..  The exhaust 1 each at. e1 is collected 'from liquid outlet 9,,<br>
As shown in Fiq., I,, solid bed reactor 1 is connected to a reservoir .1(3 through a pump 11,, Thus,<br>
the organic acid formed by the step of digestion in solid bed reactor 1 is recycled through reservoir 10 so<br>
as to increase the concentration of the acid,,<br>
Reactor  5 has a temperature  control  system<br>
comprising a heat convector 7 connected to a heat convector control system 13,, A temperature monitor 14<br>
is connected to a  thermocouple 15.<br>
Reference  is  now  made  to  Fig,,  2,  which<br>
illustrates the solid bed reactor to comprise a reactor .1 covered by a lid 16. A pipe 17 connects a<br>
sprinkler la to a water source so as to enhance the process. The biomass is supported on a perforated base<br>
1.8,, which can be slided. A water seal 19 is provided at the upper end of reactor 1.<br>
Reactor   1   is   supported    on<br>
Reservoir 10. A pump 11 connects reservoir reactor 1 so as to recyle -the acid and thereby increase<br>
its concentration,. A level indicator 20 is provided with  reservoir 10.<br><br><br>
