				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention concerns a pump impeller and more precisely a pump impeller for<br>
centrifugal-or half axial pumps for pumping of fluids, mainly sewage water.<br>
In literature there are lot of types of pumps and pump impellers for this purpose<br>
described, all however having certain disadvantages. Above all this concerns<br>
problems with clogging and low efficiency.<br>
Sewage water contains a lot of different types of pollutants, the amount and structure<br>
of which depend on the season and type of area from which the water emanates. In<br>
cities plastic material, hygiene articles, textile etc are common, while industrial areas<br>
may produce wearing particles. Experience shows that the worst problems are rags<br>
and the like which stick to the leading edges of the vanes and become wound<br>
around the impeller hub. Such incidents cause frequent service intervals and a<br>
reduced efficiency.<br>
In agriculture and pulp industry different kinds of special pumps are used, which<br>
should manage straw, grass, leaves and other types of organic material. For this<br>
purpose the leading edges of the vanes are swept backwards in order to cause the<br>
pollutants to be fed outwards to the periphery instead of getting stuck to the edges.<br>
Different types of disintegration means are often used for cutting the material and<br>
making the flow more easy. Examples are shown in SE-435 952, SE-375 831 and<br>
US-4 347 035.<br>
As pollutants in sewage water are of other types more difficult to master and as the<br>
operation times for sewage water pumps normally are much longer, the above<br>
mentioned special pumps do not fullfil the requirements when pumping sewage<br>
water, neither from a reliability nor from an efficiency point of view.<br>
A sewage water pump quite often operates up to 12 hours a day which means<br>
that the energy consumption depends a lot on the total efficiency of the pump.<br>
Tests have proven that it is possible to improve efficiency by up to 50% for a<br>
sewage pump according to the invention as compared with known sewage<br>
pumps. As the life cycle cost for an electrically driven pump normally is totally<br>
dominated by the energy cost (c:a 80%), it is evident that such a dramatic<br>
increase will be extremely important.<br>
In literature the designs of the pump impellers are described very generally,<br>
especially as regards the sweep of the leading edges. An unambiguous<br>
definition of said sweep does not exist.<br>
Tests have shown that the design of the sweep angle distribution on the leading<br>
edges is very important in order to obtain the necessary self cleaning ability of<br>
the pump impeller. The nature of the pollutants also calls for different sweep<br>
angles in order to provide a good function.<br>
Literature does not give any information about what is needed in order to obtain<br>
a gliding transport of pollutants outwards in a radial direction along the leading<br>
edges of the vanes. What is mentioned is in general that the edges shall be<br>
obtuse-angles, swept backwards, etc. See SE-435 952.<br>
When smaller pollutants such as grass and other organic material are pumped,<br>
relatively small angles may be sufficient in order to obtain the radial transport<br>
and also to disintegrate the pollutants in the slot between pump impeller nd the<br>
surrounding housing. In practice, disintegration is obtained by the particles being<br>
cut through contact with the impeller and the housing when the former rotates<br>
having a periphery velocity of 10 to 25 m/s. This cutting process is improved by<br>
the surfaces being provided with cutting devices, slots or the like. Compare SE-<br>
435 952. Such pumps are used for transport of pulp, manure, etc.<br>
When designing a pump impeller having vane leading edges swept<br>
backwards in order to obtain a self cleaning, a conflict arises<br>
between the distribution of the sweep angle, performance and<br>
other design parameters. In general it is true than an increased<br>
sweep angle means a less risk for clogging, but at the same time<br>
the efficiency decreases.<br>
The invention brings about a possibility to design the leading edge<br>
of the vane in an optimum way as regards obtaining of the<br>
different functions and qualities for reliable and economic pumping<br>
of sewage water containing pollutants such as rags, fibres, etc.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a pump impeller of a<br>
centrifugal- or half axial type to be used in a pump for pumping<br>
sewage water, characterized in that the impeller is provided with<br>
one or several vanes, the leading edges of which being swept<br>
backwards towards the periphery, the exact sweep angle, defined<br>
in every point on the leading edge as the angle between the<br>
normal to the leading edge and the relative velocity of the pumped<br>
medium at that point, has a value within an area limited by the<br>
interval 40-55 degrees at the connection of the leading edge to the<br>
hub and 60-75 degrees at the periphery and having a mainly even<br>
variation therebetween.<br>
Preferably, the angle between the normal to the leading edge and<br>
the relative velocity of the pumped medium at each point on the<br>
leading edge, has a value within an area limited by the interval 45-<br>
55 degrees at the connection of the leading edge to the hub and<br>
62-72 degrees at the periphery and having a mainly even variation<br>
therebetween.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the leading edge of the vane is located<br>
essentially in a plane perpendicular to the impeller shaft where the absolute<br>
velocity of the pumped medium is mainly axial. The connection of the leading<br>
edge to the hub may be located adjacent the end of said hub.<br>
The first component, shown in Fig 5, quantifies a band of the sweep angle<br>
distribution which admits a good function and efficiency. The range is connected<br>
to size, periphery velocity and material friction. The independent variable that is<br>
used to describe this, here called normalized radius, is defined as follows :<br>
Normalized radius = (r — r1) / (r2 — r1) Equation 1<br>
where r1 is the radius of the hub connection, r2 out to the periphery of the<br>
leading edge and where the radius according to a cylinder coordinate system<br>
having origo in the center of the impeller shaft, defines the shortest distance<br>
between the actual point and a point on the extension of the impeller shaft.<br>
The basics in this part of the invention being that the sweep angle of the leading<br>
edge is increased considerably outwards, from a minimum of 40 degrees at the<br>
hub connection to a minimum of 55 degrees at the periphery. The upper limit,<br>
60-75 degrees, defines a border line above which the frequency as well as the<br>
reliability are influenced in a negative way.<br>
The second part of the invention concerns a special embodiment which has the<br>
very advantageous ability that the sweep angle will be almost independent of the<br>
operation point, i.e. different flows and heads, which also corresponds with<br>
different velocity triangles (C,U, W).<br>
The definition of the sweep angle will be described below with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig 1 shows a three dimensional view of a pump impeller according to the<br>
invention, Fig 2 a radial cut through a schematically drawn pump according to<br>
the invention, while Fig 3 shows a schematic axial view of the inlet of the<br>
impeller. Fig 4 shows an enlargement of an area on the leading edge of an<br>
impeller vane, while Fig 5 is a diagram showing the relation between the back<br>
sweep of the leading edge and a standard radius according to the invention.<br>
In the drawings, 1 stands for an impeller hub, 2 a vane having a leading edge 3.<br>
4 stands for the connection of the leading edge to the hub and 5 the periphery of<br>
the edge. 6 stands for the normal to the edge in a certain point. 7 stands for the<br>
wall of the pump housing, 8 the end of the hub, 9 the direction of rotation, a<br>
sweep angle, WR the projected relative velocity, the velocity of the fluid in a corotating <br>
coordinate system, and z the impeller shaft direction.<br>
In order to design a desired pump impeller geometry in an optimum way, a<br>
correct definition of said sweep angle is a provision. The exact sweep angle a is<br>
in general a function of the geometry of the leading edge in a meridional view (r -<br>
z) as well as in an axial view (r - ?), see Figs 2 and 3.<br>
The exact definition will be a function of the curve that describes the form of the<br>
leading edge 3 and the local relative velocity W at that curve. This can be<br>
mathematically stated in the following way :<br>
With traditional designations of the velocity triangle (C, U, W) the relative velocity W<br>
(r)is a function of the position vector r in a co-rotating cylindric coordinate system.<br>
In the normal way the relative velocity W (r,?,z ) can also be explained in its<br>
components (Wr, W?, Wz ).<br>
The three dimensional curve along the leading edge 3 can in a corresponding corotating <br>
coordinate system be described as a function R which depends on the<br>
position vector r, i. e. R = R (r, ?, z ).<br>
An infinitesimal vector which is in parallel with the leading edge in every point can be<br>
defined as dR. From the definition of scalar product an expression is obtained for the<br>
sweep angle a, defined as the angle between the normal to dR and Wr, where Wr is<br>
defined as the orthogonal projection of WR onto the direction of W at zero<br>
incidence. This means that WR and W are equal at or close to the nominal<br>
operating point, sometimes referred to the best efficiency point.<br>
a = p/2- arccos[(dR.WR)/(|dR | -|Wr|)] Equation 2<br>
At the nominal operation point of the pump impeller the following is generally valid:<br>
W= Wr. i. e. the current angle bn and the vane angle are equal, where:<br>
bN = arccos (W?/ I W |) Equation 3<br>
if it is assumed that the absolute inlet velocity does not have any circumferencial<br>
component, i. e. We equals with the periphery velocity of the impeller.<br>
By using these definitions and assumptions it will be shown below that µ is<br>
independent of the flow. The conditions are that the leading edge lies in a<br>
plane that is essentially perpendicular to the direction z of the impeller shaft and that<br>
the leading edge is located where the absolute inlet velocity is essentially axial,<br>
which means that the radial component of Wr is near zero. For the same reasons<br>
the circumferencial component of Wr, i. e in ? direction, equals with the peripheral<br>
velocity of the impeller and is independent of the flow. The axial component of Wr<br>
gives a neglectable contribution to a as dRz is zero according to the above . This<br>
follows from the definition of scalar product. Accordingly the flow dependant variable<br>
I Wr I does not influence a in Equation 2, since the numerator as well as the<br>
denominator change proportionally.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the leading edge of the vane is<br>
located in a plane essentially perpendicular to the impeller shaft. With the knowledge<br>
that a pump very often operates within a broad field as concerns volume flow and<br>
head, the preferred embodiment admits that the self cleaning ability can be kept<br>
independant of different operation conditions.<br>
The third part of the invention concerns a preferred embodiment where the<br>
connection of the leading edge to the hub is located adjacent the end 8 of the hub 1,<br>
i. e. the latter has no central protruding tip. This diminishes the risk for pollutants<br>
being wound around the central part of the impeller.<br>
