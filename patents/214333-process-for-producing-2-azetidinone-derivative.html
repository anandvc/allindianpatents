				<td>PROCESS FOR PRODUCING 2-AZETIDINONE DERIVATIVE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to a process for producing a 2-azetidinone derivative.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
2-Azetidinone derivatives are important as reactive compounds for forming the subsituent at the 13-position of an anticancer compound having the following structure.<br><br>
As such a reactive compound, use is made of, for example, a compound (1) having the following structure (TIPS: triisopropylsilyl group, Boc: tertiary butoxycarbonyl group (hereinafter ^^tertiary" will be abbreviated as ^^t-", i.e., "t-butoxycarbonyl group")<br>
  (1)<br><br>
This compound (1) is obtained by subjecting a racemic compound (2) (PMP: paramethoxyphenyl group (4-methoxYphenyl group) , Ac: acetyl group, the acetoxy group at the 3-position and the 3-fluoro-2-pyridyl group at the 4-position being in the cis-configuration):<br>
  (2)<br>
to deprotection of Ac at the 3-position, conversion into TIPS, recrystallization, elimination of PMP at the 1--position, and separation by column chromatography (which will be sometimes abbreviated as column hereinafter) to give a compound (3):<br>
  (3)<br>
followed by separation with the use of an optical resolution column and attachment of a protective group.<br>
The process for obtaining the compound (1) from the racemic compound (2) suffers from a problem that troublesome procedures (epimerization, replacement of the solvent for recrystallization, isolation by the column, etc.) are needed and yet only a low yield can be achieved. To obtain the compound (1) , there arises an additional problem that the compound (3)<br><br>
should be separated by using an optical resolution column in the step prior to the final step, which results in an increase in the cost in case of mass production.<br>
The present invention aims at providing a production process whereby an optically active 2-azetidinone derivative can be easily produced in a large amount at a low cost.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>

the  above-described  compound  wherein  R^  is  a 4-methoxyphenyl group or a bis(4-methoxyphenyl)methyl group;<br>
the above-described compound wherein R^ is a methyl group, etc.<br>
In the present invention, the compound represented by formula (I) (which will be called the compound (I) hereinafter and the same will apply to compounds represented by other formulae) is treated with an enzyme capable of asymmetrically hydrolyzing an ester (which will be sometimes simply called an ^^enzyme" hereinafter) to thereby give the compound (II) . Usually another compound (III) is formed together with the compound (II) as shown in the following reaction scheme.<br><br><br>
It is preferable herein that in the compound (I), the acylo^cy group at the 3-position and R^ at the 4-position are in the cis-configuration. In this case, the compound (I) is a racemate having the (3R, 4S) and (3S, 4R) forms, the compound (II) is in the (3R, 4S) form and the compound (III) is in the (3S, 4R) form. Since the (3S, 4R) form of the compound (I) is selectively ester-hydrolyzed by the enzyme, the (3R, 4S) form of the compound (I) , namely, the compound (II) selectively remains. In case where the compound (II) has crystalline nature, the compound (II) may be separated from the mixture of the compound (II) with the compound (III) by usual recrystallization using a suitable solvent without resort to a column. It is advantageous that, even though R^COO at the 3-position of the compound (II) is ester-hydrolyzed into OH and a desired protective group is introduced thereinto, the R-configuration at the 3-position and the S-configuration at the 4-position are sustained, and even though the amino group at the 1-position is eliminated or protected, the R-configuration at the 3-position and the S-configuration at the 4-psotion are sustained. Owing to these characteristics,<br><br>
the above-described compound (1) can be formed without resort to optical resolution by using a column, whereby an extremely high efficiency can be established (see, Examples and Referential Examples).<br>
The enzyme to be used in the present invention is not particularly restricted, so long as it is capable of stereo-selectively hydrolyzing the ester bond at the 3-position of the (3S, 4R) form of the compound (I).<br>
A higher optical purity of the compound (III) obtained by the above-described reaction brings about the higher ester hydrolysis selectivity of the (3S, 4R) form of the compound (I) .  Therefore, it is favorable to employ such an enzyme.<br>
It is preferable that the enzyme to be used in the present invention has an optical purity of the compound (III) of 80%ee or above, still preferably 90%ee or above and particularly preferably 95%ee or above.<br>
As the enzyme to be used in the present invention, a lipase is preferable. It is still preferable to use a lipase originating in a microorganism, for example, a lipase originating in a microorganism belonging to the genus Pseudomonas or Aspergillus.<br>
It is also preferable to use an immobilized lipase. Examples thereof include lipases immobilized on ceramics or diatomaceous earth.<br>
As specific examples of the lipase, Amano PS, Amano PS-CI,<br><br>
Amano PS-DI and Amano AK (manufactured by Amano Enzyme) , etc. may be cited.<br>
To treat the compound (I) with the above-described enzyme, it is required to bring the compound (I) into contact with the enzyme. Although the contact method is not particularly restricted, it is preferable to dissolve the compound (I) in an appropriate solvent and then bring the enzyme into contact with the compound (I) .<br>
The contact time of bringing the above-described enzyme into contact with the compound (I) may be properly determined to achieve the desired hydrolysis ratio and optical purity. In the present invention, when an immobilized lipase is used as the enzyme, the reaction can proceed even if the contact time with the compound (I) is a short time. Illustratively, the contact time is preferably 0.5 to 48 hours, more preferably 0.5 to 24 hours, and most preferably 0.5 to 18 hours.<br>
The solvent is not particularly restricted, so long as it would not inhibit the ester-hydrolysis reaction as described above. For example, use can be made of an organic solvent such as toluene, isopropyl ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, acetonitrile, isopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, acetone, or a mixture thereof with water. In case of using a mixture of an organic solvent with water, it is preferable that the mixing ratio (by volume) of water is 5% or more but not more than 80%. In case of using ethanol as the organic<br><br>
solvent, the mixing ratio of water is preferably adjusted to 40%.<br>
The reaction temperature may be properly determined depending on the solvent. Namely, the reaction temperature is preferably controlled to about 40°C in case of using an ethyl acetate or toluene-based solvent, or to about 25°C in case of using an ethanol-based solvent.<br>
Stirring may be performed by using a stirrer, stirring blades, a shaker or the like. An adequate device may be suitably selected.<br>
The relation between the concentration of the substrate, i.e., the compound (I) and the amount of the enzyme may be suitably controlled. In general, the selectivity of the enzyme would be lowered with an increase in the substrate concentration. Also, the selectively would be lowered with a decrease in the enzyme amount. It is preferable to control the substrate concentration to about 5% and the enzyme amount to about 0.4 (enzyme mass/substrate mass).<br>
The pH of the reaction system is usually adjusted to the optimum pH value of the enzyme during the reaction. In the present invention, the initial pH value little differs from the pH value after the completion of the reaction. Thus, there arises a merit that no pH control is needed.<br>
After the completion of the enzymatic reaction, the enzyme is filtered off and the solvent is concentrated under<br><br>
reduced pressure. Then the residue is extracted with a solvent, concentrated under reduced pressure and recrystallized from an appropriate solvent.  Thus, the compound (II) can be obtained at a high purity (99% or above) and a high optical purity (99%ee or above).<br>
Water-containing methanol is preferable as the solvent for crystallization. In particular, a methanol/water mixture (17:19 by voliome) is preferable therefor.<br>
The compound (II) thus obtained is a novel optically active compound.<br>
In the compound (I) and the compound (II) , the substituents R^, R^ and R^ remain unchanged after the reaction.<br>
Next, the substituents R^, R^ and R^ will be illustrated in greater detail.<br>
R^ represents a phenyl group or a pyridyl group which may respectively have one or more substituent (s) selected from the group consisting of a halogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a halogenoalkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, an alkoxyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a nitro group, a carbamoyl group and a cyano group, preferably a halogen atom or an alkoxyl group.<br>

substituent(s), an alkanoyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms which may have substituent (s) , an alkenoyl group having 2 to 6 carbon atoms which may have substituent(s), an aryl group which may have substituent (s) , an aryloyl group which may have substituent(s) or an aralkyl group which may have substituent(s).<br>

The phenyl group may have one or more substituent(s) selected from the group consisting of a halogen aitom, an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a halogenoalkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, an alkoxyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a ni tro group, a carbamoyl group and a cyano group, preferably an alkoxyl group. The aralkyl group has a structure wherein an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms is substituted by one or more aryl group(s), and the aryl moiety may have one or more Substituent(s) selected from the group consisting of a halogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a halogenoalkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, an alkoxyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a nitro group, a carbamoyl group and a cyano group.<br>
It is particularly preferable that R^ is a 4-methoxyphenyl group or a bis(4-methoxyphenyl)methyl group.<br>
R^ represents an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms which may have substituent (s) or an alkenyl group having 2 to 6 carbon atoms which may have substituent(s).   It is<br><br>
