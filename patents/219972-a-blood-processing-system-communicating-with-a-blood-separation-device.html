				<td>Blood processing systems (10) and related methods place first (PP1) and second (PP2) fluid actuated pump stations in in-line communication between a source and a destination. The systems and methods apply fluid pressure pump strokes to the first and second pump stations to convey fluid from the source to the destination. The systems and methods switch between a first flow mode and a second flow mode. The first flow draws a fluid volume into the first pump station from the source and expel a fluid volume from the second pump station to the destination. In the second flow mode, the pump strokes draw a fluid volume into the second pump station from the source and expel a fluid volume from the first pump station to the destination. The pump strokes are synchronized so that flow from the source is essentially continuous while fluid flow to the destination is pulsatile.</td>

Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to systems and methods for processing and collecting blood, blood constituents, or other suspensions of cellular material. Background of the Invention<br>
Today people routinely separate whole blood, usually by centrifugation, into its various therapeutic components, such as red blood cells, platelets, and plasma.<br>
Conventional blood processing methods use durable centrifuge equipment inassociation with single use, sterile processing systems, typically made of plastic. The operator loads the disposable systems' upon the centrifuge before processing and removes them"afterwards.,<br>
Conventional blood centrifuges are of a size that does not permit easy transport between collection sites. Furthermore, loading and unloading operations can sometimes be time consuming and tedious-      
In addition, a need exists for further improved systems and methods for collecting blood components in a way that lends itself to use in high volume, on line blood collection environments, where higher yields of critically<br><br>
