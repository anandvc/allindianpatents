				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
NITROGEN-CONTAINING HETEROCYCLIC CARBOXAMIDE<br>
DERIVATIVES OR SALTS THEREOF AND ANTIVIRAL<br>
AGENTS COMPRISING THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to antiviral<br>
agents comprising a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic<br>
carboxamide derivative or a salt thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Nowadays, antiviral agents are selected and<br>
put to use in accordance with the objective viruses.<br>
For instance, Acyclovir and Vidarabine are used against<br>
herpes viruses; Gancicrovir and Foscarnet are used<br>
against cytomegalo virus; and interferon is used<br>
against hepatitis viruses.<br>
Influenza virus is a central virus of the<br>
cold syndrome, which has attacked human being<br>
periodically to cause many deaths amounting to tens<br>
millions. Although the number of deaths shows a<br>
tendency of decrease in the recent years owing to the<br>
improvement in hygienic and nutritive conditions, the<br>
prevalence of influenza is repeated every year, and it<br>
is apprehended that a new virus may appear to cause a<br>
wider prevalence.<br>
For prevention of influenza virus, vaccine is<br>
used widely, in addition to which low molecular weight<br><br>
substances such as Amantadine and Ribavirin are also<br>
used.<br>
Amantadine is used for prevention and<br>
treatment of influenza. Its function mechanism is said<br>
to consist in inhibiting the fusion between influenza<br>
virus and cell membrane, and it is effective against A-<br>
type influenza virus. Its problems are, however, that<br>
it is ineffective against B type influenza virus, its<br>
resistant virus appears, and it causes side effects<br>
such as nerve disturbance. Although Rimantadine which<br>
is a derivative of Amantadine has a more improved<br>
antiviral activity, the problem of side effect is not<br>
overcome by it. Ribavirin which is a guanosine<br>
derivative shows a viral RNA polymerase-inhibitory<br>
activity and is effective upon A type and B type<br>
influenza viruses. Its internal use, however, brings<br>
about no sufficient clinical effect.<br>
The present invention provides an antiviral<br>
agent exhibiting a preventive effect and a therapeutic<br>
effect against various viruses, especially influenza<br>
viruses.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventors have conducted<br>
researches and studies on compounds showing an<br>
antiviral activity against various viruses, especially<br>
influenza viruses. As a result, it has been found that<br>
pyrazine carboxamide derivatives have an anti-influenza<br><br>
virus activity. The inventors conducted further<br>
studies to find that nitrogen-containing heterocyclic<br>
carboxamide derivatives represented by the following<br>
general formula [1]:<br><br>
wherein ring A represents a substituted or unsubsti-<br>
tuted pyrazine, pyrimidine, pyridazine or triazine<br>
ring; R1 represents 0 or OH; R2 represents a hydrogen<br>
atom, an acyl group or a substituted or unsubstituted<br>
carbamoylalkyl or carboxyalkyl group; and the broken<br>
line represents a single bond or a double bond;<br>
or salts thereof exhibit an excellent antiviral<br>
activity against A-, B- and C-type of influenza viruses<br>
and other various viruses, these compounds have low<br>
cytotoxicity and are useful as an antiviral agents of<br>
high safety, as well as that novel N-containing<br>
heterocyclic carboxamide derivatives represented by the<br>
following general formula [1a]:<br><br><br>
wherein ring A' represents a pyrazine ring substituted<br>
with a halogen atom, a hydroxyl group or an oxide<br>
group; R1 represents 0 or OH; R2 represents a hydrogen<br>
atom, an acyl group or a substituted or unsubstituted<br>

depending upon the age, body weight and symptom of the<br>
patient. Usually 1 to 10 mg/kg of the nitrogen-<br>
containing heterocyclic carboxamide derivative or a<br>
salt thereof can be administered to an adult either at<br>
once or in several portions.<br>
Next, antiviral activity and cytotoxicity of<br>
the nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxamide<br>
derivatives of the present invention represented by<br>
general formula [1] or salts thereof will be explained.<br>
Sample: A nitrogen-containing heterocyclic<br>
carboxamide derivative represented by general formula<br>
[1] or a salt thereof was dissolved in dimethyl<br>
sulfoxide to prepare a solution having a concentration<br>
of 10 mg/mL. At the time of use, the solution was<br>
diluted with a culture medium to a predetermined<br>
concentration and then put to use.<br>
As the host cell of influenza virus, MDCK<br>
cell (canine kidney cell) was used. For the<br><br>
cytotoxicity test, Vero cell (monkey kidney cell) was<br>
used.<br>
Culture medium: In the multiplication of<br>
MDCK cell and Vero cell and in the cytotoxicity test<br>
using Vero cell, E'-MEM (product of Nissui) to which<br>
10% fetal bovine serum had been added was used.<br>
In the measurement of antiviral activity, E'-<br>
MEM (product of Nissui) to which 1% bovine serum<br>
albumin had been added was used.<br>
Test Example 1 (Anti-influenza activity)<br>
MDCK cells were seeded to a 6-well plate<br>
(product of CORNING) at 5 x 105 cells/well, and cultured<br>
overnight at 35°C in 5% CO2-air atmosphere. Then, the<br>
cultured MDCK cells on the plate was treated with<br>
influenza virus A/PR/8/34 strain diluted with a serum-<br>
free culture medium at the concentration of 200 PFU/mL,<br>
at 0.5 mL/well for one hour to achieve inoculation and<br>
adsorption. After completion of the inoculation and<br>
adsorption, an E'-MEM culture medium containing 0.6%<br>
Agar Noble, 1% bovine serum albumin and 3 μg/mL<br>
acetyltrypsin and also containing a test compound at a<br>
prescribed concentration was added to the cells. After<br>
sufficient coagulation, the plate was turned upside<br>
down, and cultured for 3 days. After completion of the<br>
culture, the alive cells were dyed with 1% Neutral Red.<br>
Then, the cells were fixed with 10% formalin. The agar<br>
medium was removed therefrom with running water.<br><br>
25<br>
Thereafter, the number of plaques was counted. The<br>
plaque inhibition rate was expressed in percentage<br>
calculated in comparison with control containing no<br>
test compound.<br>
The results are shown in Table 5, wherein the<br>
test compound number are the same as those in Tables 1<br>
to 4.<br><br>
Test Example 2 (Cytotoxic activity)<br>
A culture medium containing a predetermined<br>
concentration of test compound was added to a 96-well<br><br>
plate (product of CORNING) in 100 μl/well. Then, Vero<br>
cells were adjusted to the concentration of 2 x 104<br>
cells/mL with culture medium. The solution was added<br>
to the plate at 100 μL/well, and cultured at 37°C in 5%<br>
CO2-air atmosphere for 4 days. When the culture was<br>
completed, the number of alive cells was counted<br>
according to the XTT method [for example, see CANCER<br>
RESEARCH, Vol. 48, Pages 4827-4833 (1988)].<br>
As a result, the 50% cell growth inhibitory<br>
concentration (IC50) of 3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide<br>
(compound No. 1) was 250 μg/mL or more.<br>
