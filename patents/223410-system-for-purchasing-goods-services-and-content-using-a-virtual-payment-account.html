				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>A virtual payment system for ordering and paying for goods, services and content over an internetwork is disclosed. The virtual payment system is a secure, closed system comprising registered buyer and seller computers (50, 51). A buyer computer becomes registered by applying for a virtual payment account. A seller computer becomes registered by applying for a seller account. A buyer can instantly open an account on-line. Once an account is established, a digital certificate is stored on the registered participant&#x27;s computer. The buyer can then order from a seller and charge it to the virtual payment account. When the product is shipped, the seller notifies a commerce gateway component (52), which in turn notifies the credit processing server that applies the charges to the buyer&#x27;s virtual payment account.</td>

Cross-Reference to Related Applications<br>
This application is a Continuation-In-Part of prior United States Application<br>
No. 09/370,949, filed August 9,1999, priority from the fxling date of which is hereby<br>
claimed under 35 U.S.C. §. 120. This application also claims the benefit of<br>
Provisional Application No. 60/140,039, filed June 18, 1999, the benefit of which is<br>
hereby claimed under 35 U.S.C. § 119.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention generally relates to a system for purchasing goods, services and content<br>
using a virtual payment account from one or more other computers connected via common<br>
communications links and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus for ordering<br>
goods, services and.content from computers connected to the Internet using a virtual<br>
payment account.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Communication networks are well known in the computer communications<br>
field. By definition, a network is a group of computers and associated devices that<br>
are connected by communications facilities or links. Network communications can<br>
be of a permanent nature, such as via cables, or can be of a temporary nature, such as<br>
-connections made through telephone, or radio links. Networks may vary in size, from<br>
a local area network (LAN) consisting of a few computers or workstations and related<br>
devices; to a wide area network (WAN) which interconnects computers and LANs<br>
that are geographically dispersed; to a remote access service (RAS) which<br>
interconnects remote computers via temporary communication links. An<br>
internetwork, in turn, is the joining of multiple computer networks, both similar and<br>
dissimilar, by means of gateways or routers that facilitate data transfer and<br>
conversion from various networks. A well-known abbreviation for the term<br>
internetwork is "Internet." As currently understood, the capitalized term "Internet"<br>
refers to the collection of networks and routers that use the Transmission Control<br>
Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) to communicate with one another.<br>
A representative section of the Internet 40 is shown in FIGURE 1 (Prior Art)<br>
in which a plurality of local area networks (LANs) 44 and a wide area network<br>
(WAN) 46 are interconnected by routers 42. The routers 42 are generally special<br>
purpose computers used to interface one LAN or WAN to another. Communication<br>
links within the LANs may be twisted wire pair, or coaxial cable, while<br>
communication links between networks may utilize 56 Kbps analog telephone lines,<br>
or 1 Mbps digital T-l lines and/or 45 Mbps T-3 lines. Further, computers and other<br>
related electronic devices can be remotely connected to either the LANs 44 or the<br>
WAN 46 via a modem and temporary telephone link. Such computers and electronic<br>
devices 48 are shown in FIGURE 1 as connected to one of the LANs 44 by a dotted<br>
line. It will be appreciated that the Internet comprises a vast number of such<br>
interconnected networks, computers and routers and that only a small, representative<br>
section of the Internet 40 is shown in FIGURE 1.<br>
The Internet has recently seen explosive growth by virtue of its ability to link<br>
computers located throughout the world. As the Internet has grown, so has the World<br>
Wide Web (WWW). The WWW is a vast collection of interconnected or "hypertext"<br>
documents (also known as "Web pages") written in HyperText Markup Language<br>
(HTML) that are electronically stored at "Web sites" throughout the Internet. A Web<br>
site is a server connected to the Internet that has mass storage facilities for storing<br>
hypertext documents and that runs administrative software for handling requests for<br>
those stored hypertext documents. A hypertext document normally includes a<br>
number of hyperlinks, i.e., highlighted portions of text that link the document to<br>
another hypertext document possibly stored at a Web site elsewhere on the Internet.<br>
Each hyperlink is associated with a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that provides<br>
the exact location of the linked document on a server connected to the Internet. Thus,<br>
whenever a hypertext document is retrieved from any Web server, the document is<br>
considered to be retrieved from the WWW.<br>
A user is allowed to retrieve hypertext documents from the WWW, i.e., a user<br>
is allowed to "surf the Web," via a Web browser. A Web browser, such as<br>
NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR® or MICROSOFT® Internet Explorer, is a software<br>
program implemented by a Web client, i.e., a user's computer, to provide a graphical<br>
user interface to the WWW. Upon request from the user via the Web browser, the<br>
Web client accesses and retrieves the desired hypertext document or Web page from<br>
the appropriate Web server using the URL for the document and a protocol known as<br>
HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP is a higher-level protocol than TCP/IP<br>
and is designed specifically for the requirements of the WWW. It is used on top of<br>
TCP/IP to transfer hypertext documents between servers and clients.<br>
At the advent of the WWW, the information stored on the Internet was freely<br>
transferred back and forth between those parties interested in the information.<br>
However, the WWW is quickly becoming a channel of commercial activity, whereby<br>
a vast number of companies have developed their own Web sites for advertising and<br>
selling their goods and services. Commercial activity that takes place by means of<br>
connected computers is known as electronic commerce, or e-commerce, and can<br>
occur between a buyer and a seller through an on-line information service, the<br>
Internet, a bulletin board system (BBS), or between buyer and seller computers<br>
through electronic data interchange (EDI). A buyer (also referred to as a user,<br>
consumer or purchaser in the context of e-commerce) may "visit the Web site" of a<br>
company or seller, i.e., retrieve the hypertext documents located on the Web server of<br>
a particular seller, and order any good or service that the seller has to offer. If that<br>
good or service is in the form of electronically stored information, such as a book, a<br>
video, a computer game, etc., the buyer may simply download the good or service<br>
from the company's Web site to his or her computer for immediate consumption and<br>
use. If the good or service is of a more tangible nature, such as an appliance or article<br>
of clothing ordered from an on-line catalog, a more conventional method of delivery,<br>
e.g., the postal service or a common carrier, is used.<br>
A common method of payment for e-commerce purchases is electronic credit,<br>
or e-credit. E-credit is a form of electronic commerce often involving credit card<br>
transactions carried out over the Internet. Traditional e-credit purchases are paid for<br>
by a major credit card, wherein the buyer is required to transmit his or her credit<br>
information, for example, an account number and expiration date, over the Internet to<br>
the company's Web site. Many buyers are concerned about the security and<br>
confidentiality of such electronic transmissions. Furthermore, many buyers do not<br>
have a major credit card with which to make such purchases. Alternative billing<br>
systems, such as providing credit information by facsimile or postal service, are much<br>
less convenient and often prove enough of a barrier to prohibit the sale altogether.<br>
Finally, the traditional methods of billing and payment do not adequately protect the<br>
seller or buyer from fraudulent purchases.<br>
Accordingly, a more effective method and apparatus for ordering and billing<br>
for goods, services and content over a network, and ultimately the Internet, is needed.<br>
The method and apparatus should protect the seller and buyer from fraudulent<br>
purchases. Additionally, the method and apparatus should provide an element of<br>
non-repudiation to all transactions. The method and apparatus should also prevent<br>
buyers with histories of nonpayment from purchasing additional goods, services<br>
and/or content. Finally, the method and apparatus should allow a buyer without a<br>
major credit card to purchase goods, services and content over the network.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a computer program for ordering products<br>
from computers connected to the Internet, wherein the buyer is automatically billed<br>
for the ordered good, service or content based on a virtual payment account<br>
maintained by a commerce gateway.<br>
In accordance with other aspects of the present invention, a commerce<br>
gateway interfaces with a credit processing server to handle the monetary aspects<br>
involved in purchasing goods, services and/or content. The credit processing server<br>
interfaces with one or more financial institutions that physically handle the buyer's<br>
account. For example, a buyer can pay for purchases electronically by transferring<br>
funds from a bank account held by the buyer at a financial institution, or by prepaying<br>
for the purchases by sending a check to the provider of the commerce gateway.<br>
Alternatively, reward points earned by using the virtual payment account can be<br>
applied towards purchases.<br>
In accordance with still other aspects of the present invention, the credit<br>
processing server or commerce gateway communicates with one or more identity<br>
bureaus in order to determine a buyer's identity before creating a virtual payment<br>
account.<br>
In accordance with still other aspects of the present invention, the credit<br>
processing server communicates with one or more credit bureaus in order to<br>
determine a credit limit for a buyer's virtual payment account.<br>
In accordance with yet other aspects of the present invention, a virtual<br>
payment account can have associated sub-accounts. A sub-account can have a credit<br>
limit that is less than the main account credit limit. A sub-account can limit the seller<br>
sites from which goods, services and/or content can be purchased.<br>
In accordance with further aspects of the present invention, purchases must be<br>
made by a registered buyer from a registered seller. Security is ensured via<br>
authentication of the parties to a transaction. Authentication can be performed by<br>
verification of a digital certificate, or a digital signature, or by alternate authentication<br>
methods.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
As previously described and shown in FIGURE 1, the Internet 40 is a<br>
collection of local area networks (LANs) 44, wide area networks (WANs) 46, remote<br>
computers 48 and routers 42 that use the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet<br>
Protocol (TCP/IP) to communicate with each other. The World Wide Web (WWW),<br>
on the other hand, is a vast collection of interconnected, electronically stored<br>
information located on servers connected throughout the Internet 40. Many<br>
companies are now selling goods, services and access to their premium content over<br>
the Internet using the WWW. In accordance with the present invention, a buyer<br>
orders goods, services and/or content (referred to interchangeably herein as<br>
"products") over the Internet 40 via a Web browser and is automatically billed for the<br>
purchase using his or her virtual payment account without transferring sensitive<br>
account information, such as account number and expiration date, over the<br>
Internet 40. The virtual payment account allows a buyer to settle transactions of the<br>
virtual payment account using a prepaid or credit account. In one actual embodiment<br>
of the present invention, the virtual payment account uses bank electronic funds<br>
transfers, for example, using the Automated Clearing House (ACH) standard which is<br>
maintained by the National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) - the<br>
standards group promoting electronic commerce standards. In another embodiment,<br>
the virtual payment account can be funded using a traditional paper check, with the<br>
buyer mailing a check, e.g., via the postal service, to the providers of the virtual<br>
payment account system. Alternatively, funds transfer services and electronic bill<br>
payment services, such as CHECKFREE®, may be used. Reward points earned<br>
through use of the virtual payment account can also be applied to the buyer's virtual<br>
payment account to pay for products.<br>
More specifically, as shown in FIGURE 2, the buyer purchases goods,<br>
services, and/or premium content from a seller server 51, i.e., a computer owned by<br>
the seller which sponsors or sells the product, by placing an order with the seller<br>
server from a computer 50 connected to the Internet 40. The order is processed and<br>
confirmed by a commerce gateway 52 connected to a LAN 44 located elsewhere in<br>
the Internet 40. The commerce gateway 52 is also connected to a credit processing<br>
server 53, via the LAN 44. The credit processing server 53 communicates with one or<br>
more identity bureaus 56 to verify the identity of the buyer. After verifying the<br>
identity of the buyer the credit processing server 53 communicates with one or more<br>
credit bureaus 58 in order to determine the credit worthiness of a buyer.<br>
In one actual embodiment of the present invention described herein, the<br>
identity bureau 56 is a server provided and maintained by an agency for verifying the<br>
identity of the buyer and the credit bureau 58 is a server provided and administrated<br>
by a credit agency for processing credit reports for buyers. The identity bureau 56<br>
and credit bureau 58 can be located on the LAN 44 or elsewhere on the Internet 40.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the credit processing server can establish a point-<br>
to-point connection with a remote identity bureau or credit bureau that is not<br>
connected to either the LAN 44 nor the Internet 40. It will be appreciated that other<br>
methods of communication between the credit processing server 53 and identity<br>
bureau 56 or credit bureau.58. may be used, for example, a secure Virtual Private<br>
Network (VPN) maintained and operated by the identity bureau or credit bureau<br>
exclusively for the purpose of identity checking or credit rating, respectively.<br>
Finally, in yet other embodiments, the identity and credit bureaus may not<br>
actually offer a server at all. Rather, a customer service representative for the identity<br>
or credit bureaus may process the identity or credit report and manually provide the<br>
report to an administrator of the present invention who manually enters the report to<br>
the credit processing server 53.<br>
The credit processing server 53 also communicates with one or more financial<br>
institutions 59 for the purpose of obtaining the buyer's payment, i.e., a transfer of<br>
funds for the purchase of products. As is the case with the identity and credit<br>
bureaus 58, the financial institutions 59 may be other servers in electronic<br>
communication with the credit processing server 53, customer service representatives<br>
in more traditional communication with the credit processing server 53, or some<br>
combination thereof.<br>
Finally, in addition to the commerce gateway 52, the LAN 44 includes an<br>
administrative computer 54 used to administer buyer and seller information and<br>
services provided by the commerce gateway 52 and credit processing server 53.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment of the present invention shown in FIGURE 2,<br>
the LAN 44 is insulated from the Internet 40 by a firewall 55 that tracks and controls<br>
the flow of all data passing through it. The firewall 55 protects the LAN 44 from<br>
malicious in-bound data traffic. The LAN 44 is a bus network interconnecting the<br>
various computers and servers. The LAN 44 shown in FIGURE 2 can be formed of<br>
various coupling media such as glass or plastic fiber-optic cables, coaxial cables,<br>
twisted wire pair cables, ribbon cables, etc. In addition, one of ordinary skill in the<br>
art will appreciate that the coupling medium can also include a radio frequency<br>
coupling media or other intangible coupling media. Any computer system or number<br>
of computer systems, including but not limited to workstations, personal computers,<br>
laptop computers, personal data assistants, servers, remote computers, etc., that is<br>
equipped with the necessary interface hardware may be connected temporarily or<br>
permanently to the LAN 44, and thus, the Internet 40. However, if temporarily<br>
connected via a telephone link to another device connected to the LAN 44, the<br>
interface hardware of both the remote computer 48 and the device to which it is<br>
connected must contain a modem.<br>
Also shown in FIGURE 2 is an exemplary authentication device 205 whose<br>
purpose will be described in more detail below. In one embodiment of the current<br>
invention, the authentication device may be a personal data assistant (PDA) with a<br>
wireless modem. However, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate mat the "<br>
authentication device may be a laptop computer, a cellular telephone, a pager or any<br>
device capable of receiving a remote message.<br>
Finally, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that while only one<br>
buyer computer 50, and one seller server 51 are depicted in FIGURE 2, numerous<br>
buyer computers and seller servers equipped with the hardware and software<br>
components described below may be connected to the Internet 40. It will also be<br>
appreciated that the term "buyer" used herein can be applied to any purchaser of<br>
goods and/or services and can be applied equally to an individual, non-commercial<br>
purchaser, a business or a commercial purchaser. In other words, the term "buyer"<br>
can apply to any purchaser and the term "seller" can apply to any vendor or merchant,<br>
be they on individual, non-commercial seller, a business or a commercial seller.<br>
Relevant Buyer Computer, Seller Server, Commerce Gateway, and Credit Processing<br>
Server Components<br>
FIGURE 3 depicts several of the important components of the buyer's<br>
computer 50. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the buyer's<br>
computer 50 could be any computer used by the buyer to utilize the buyer's virtual<br>
payment account. Additionally, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that<br>
the buyer's computer 50 may include many more components then those shown in<br>
FIGURE 3. However, it is not necessary that all of these generally conventional<br>
components be shown in order to disclose an illustrative embodiment for practicing<br>
the present invention. As shown in FIGURE 3, the buyer's computer includes a<br>
network interface 60 for connecting to a LAN 44 or WAN 46, or for connecting<br>
remotely to a LAN or WAN. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the<br>
network interface 60 includes the necessary circuitry for such a connection, and is<br>
also constructed for use with the TCP/IP protocol, the particular network<br>
configuration of the LAN or WAN it is connecting to, and a particular type of<br>
coupling medium.<br>
The buyer's computer 50 also includes a processing unit 61, a display 62 and a<br>
memory 63. The memory 63 generally comprises a random access memory (RAM),<br>
a read-only memory (ROM) and a permanent mass storage device, such as a disk<br>

paying for a product over the Internet 40 in accordance with the present invention.<br>
More specifically, the memory 63 stores a Web browser component 64, such as<br>
NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR® or MICROSOFT® Internet Explorer, and a buyer<br>
authenticator component 65 formed in accordance with the present invention for<br>
authenticating a buyer as a registered participant of the virtual payment system prior<br>
to performing any virtual payment account transactions. It will be appreciated that<br>
these components may be stored on a computer-readable medium and loaded into<br>
memory 63 of the buyer computer 50 using a drive mechanism associated with the<br>
computer-readable medium, such as a floppy or DVD/CD-ROM drive.<br>
As will be described in more detail below, the products ordered by the buyer<br>
are supplied by a seller server 51, described next, following authorization from a<br>
remote server, i.e., a commerce gateway 52 described later, located elsewhere on the<br>
Internet, e.g., on LAN 44 illustrated in FIGURE 2. FIGURE 4 depicts several of the<br>
important components of the seller server 51. Those of ordinary skill in the art will<br>
appreciate that the seller server 51 includes many more components than those shown<br>
in FIGURE 4. However, it is not necessary that all of these generally conventional<br>
components be shown in order to disclose an illustrative embodiment of practicing<br>
the present invention. As shown in FIGURE 4, the seller server 51 includes a<br>

The seller server 51 also includes a processing unit 71, a display 72 and a<br>
memory 73. The memory 73 generally comprises a random access memory (RAM),<br>
read-only memory (ROM), and a permanent mass storage device, such as a hard disk<br>
drive, tape drive, optical drive, floppy disk drive, or combination thereof. In one<br>
actual embodiment of the present invention, the memory contains a product<br>
database 74 that includes the electronically stored good or service ordered by the<br>
buyer. In other embodiments of the present invention, the product database 74 stores<br>
the premium content ordered by the buyer, i.e., the hypertext documents or other<br>
electronically stored information considered of monetary value by the seller. In yet<br>
other embodiments of the present invention, the goods may be tangible goods not<br>
capable of being electronically stored, in which case the product database includes<br>
descriptive information of the products.<br>
The memory 73 also contains a commerce engine component 75 for<br>
purchasing a product from a seller Web site. The commerce engine component 75<br>
may be an existing commerce engine, such as MICROSOFT® Site Server, which<br>
allows for the payment of products ordered over the Internet using a major credit<br>
card, e.g., VISA® or MASTERCARD®. A commerce gateway adapter<br>
component 76 is also provided to allow the commerce engine component 75 to<br>
interface with the commerce gateway 52. The commerce gateway adapter component<br>
uses and provides application programming interface (API) calls to interface with the<br>
commerce engine 75. Also included in memory is a seller authenticator<br>
component 77 for verifying that the seller is an authorized or registered seller of the<br>
virtual payment system of the present invention. It will be appreciated that the<br>
product database 74, the commerce engine component 75, the commerce gateway<br>
adapter component 76 and the seller authenticator component 77 may be stored on a<br>
computer-readable medium and loaded into memory 73 of the seller server 51 using a<br>
drive mechanism associated with the computer-readable medium, such as a floppy or<br>
CD-ROM drive. Finally, memory 73 stores a Web server component 78 for handling<br>
requests for stored information received via the Internet and the WWW.<br>
FIGURE 5 depicts several of the important components of the commerce<br>
gateway 52. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the commerce<br>
gateway 52 includes many more components than those shown in FIGURE 5.<br>
However, it is not necessary that all of these generally conventional components be<br>
shown in order to disclose an illustrative embodiment for practicing the present<br>
invention. As shown in FIGURE 5, the commerce gateway 52 is connected to the<br>
LAN 44 via a network interface 80. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate<br>
that the network interface 80 includes the necessary circuitry for connecting the<br>
commerce gateway 52 to the LAN 44 and the firewall 55, and is constructed for use<br>
with the TCP/IP protocol, the particular network configuration of the LAN 44, and<br>
the particular type of coupling medium.<br>
The commerce gateway 52 also includes a processing unit 81, a display 82<br>
and a memory 83. The memory 83 generally comprises a random access memory<br>
(RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), and a permanent mass storage device, slich as a<br>
hard disk drive, tape drive, optical drive, floppy disk drive, or combination thereof.<br>
The memory 83 stores the program code and data necessary for authorizing a seller<br>
server 51 to supply products to buyers and obtaining payment for the products via a<br>
credit processing server 53 in accordance with the present invention. More<br>
specifically, the memory 83 stores a transaction server component 84 formed in<br>
accordance with the present invention for authorizing a seller to supply the ordered<br>
product and obtaining payment for the ordered product from the credit processing<br>
server 53. Memory 83 also contains an identity bureau adapter 79 formed in<br>
accordance with the present invention for verifying a buyer or seller's identity. Also<br>
stored in memory 83 is an enrollment server component 89 formed in accordance<br>
with the present invention for determining the credit worthiness of an applicant. An<br>
account identification container generator component 88 is also stored in memory 83<br>
for determining an internal account identification. A report server 85 is also stored in<br>
memory 83 for processing request for reports and consolidating information for<br>
requested reports. Also stored in the memory 83 is a credit processing server adapter<br>
component 86 for communicating with a credit processing server 53 described below.<br>
It will be appreciated that the transaction server component 84, the credit processing<br>
server adapter component 86, the account identification container generator<br>
component 88, and the enrollment server component 89 may be stored on a<br>
computer-readable medium and loaded into memory 83 of the commerce gateway 52<br>
using a drive mechanism associated with the computer-readable medium, such as<br>

FIGURE 6 depicts several of the important components of the credit<br>
processing server 53. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the credit<br>
processing server 53 includes many more components than those shown in<br>
FIGURE 6. However, it is not necessary that all of these generally conventional<br>
components be shown in order to disclose an illustrative embodiment for practicing<br>
the present invention. As shown in FIGURE 6, the credit processing server 53 is<br>
connected to the LAN 44 via a network interface 90. Those of ordinary skill in the<br>
art will appreciate that the network interface 90 includes the necessary circuitry for<br>
connecting the credit processing server 53 to the LAN 44 and the firewall 55, and is<br>
constructed for use with the TCP/IP protocol, the particular network configuration of<br>
the LAN 44, and the particular type of coupling medium.<br>
The credit processing server 53 also includes a processing unit 91, a<br>
display 92and a memory 93. The memory 93 generally comprises a random access<br>
memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), and a permanent mass storage device,<br>
such as a hard disk drive, tape drive, optical drive, floppy disk drive, or combination<br>
thereof. The memory 93 stores the program code and data necessary for authorizing<br>
and securing payment for products purchased using a virtual payment account in<br>
accordance with the present invention. More specifically, the memory 93. of the<br>
credit processing server stores credit processing sub-systems including: an<br>
account/billing sub-system 94 for billing a buyer for products purchased using a<br>
virtual payment account; a payment processing sub-system 95 for communicating<br>
with a financial institution 59 in order to process payments received for purchases<br>
made using a virtual payment account; and an account enrollment sub-system 96 for<br>
determining the credit limit for an applicant as determined by information received<br>
from one or more credit bureaus 58.<br>
Also stored in memory 93 are an account database 97 and a financial<br>
database 98 used to store data required for the account/billing sub-system 94, the<br>
payment processing sub-system 95, identity bureau adapter 99 and the account<br>
enrollment sub-system 96 to perform their required functions. It will be appreciated<br>
that the account/billing sub-system 94, the payment processing sub-system 95, the<br>
account enrollment sub-system 96, the account database 97, identity bureau adapter<br>
99 and the financial database 98 may be stored on a computer-readable medium and<br>
loaded into memory 93 of the credit processing system using a drive mechanism<br>
associated with the computer-readable medium, such as floppy or DVD/CD-ROM<br>
drive. It will also be appreciated that the account/billing sub-system 94, the payment<br>
processing sub-system 95, and the account enrollment sub-system 96 can comprise,<br>
either in full or in part, existing, traditional credit card payment systems.<br>
FIGURES 3-6 depict important components of the buyer computer 50, seller<br>
server 51, commerce gateway 52 and credit processing server 53 shown in FIGURE 2<br>
of one embodiment of the present invention. It will be appreciated that many other<br>
implementations and variations are possible. For example, one or more of the credit<br>
processing sub-systems 94, 95, 96 could be included in the commerce gateway 52<br>
instead of in the credit processing server 53. Alternatively, each of the credit<br>
processing sub-systems 94, 95, 96 of the credit processing server could be in a<br>
separate server. Further, additional commerce gateways 52 and credit processing<br>
servers 53 may be located on the LAN 44 or elsewhere on the Internet 40.<br>
Applying for a Virtual Payment Account<br>
Once a virtual payment account is set up, the virtual payment system of the<br>
present invention is a closed system that provides buyers a secure method for<br>
purchasing products over the Internet. The closed system includes only a registered<br>
buyer's computer 50, a registered seller server 51, the commerce gateway 52<br>
(administered by the provider of the virtual payment system) and the credit<br>
processing server 53 (which can also be administered by the provider of the. virtual<br>
payment system). Since the account information necessary for charging the buyer for<br>
the purchase is already in the possession of the commerce gateway 52 and the credit<br>
processing server 53, the closed system of the present invention allows registered<br>
buyers to purchase products from registered sellers without transferring sensitive<br>
account information to the sellers over the Internet. In order to become a member of<br>
the virtual payment system of the present invention, a buyer becomes a registered<br>
user by obtaining a virtual payment account. FIGURE 7 illustrates the actions taken<br>
by the buyer's computer 50, the commerce gateway 52, the credit processing<br>
system 53, and the credit bureau 58 to create a virtual payment account for a buyer.<br>
The interactions of the various components are illustrated and described in detail later<br>
for various transactions performed by the present invention with reference to the<br>
diagrams shown in FIGURES 12, 27 and 42. As shown in FIGURE 7, the process of<br>
applying for a virtual payment account is initiated when a buyer requests 100 an<br>
application form via the Internet using the Web browser 64 installed on the buyer's<br>
computer 50. The buyer may apply for a virtual payment account directly from a<br>
virtual payment account Web site located at the commerce gateway 52 or indirectly<br>
from a registered seller site located at the seller server 51. Once the request 100 for<br>
the application form is received by the commerce gateway 52, the commerce<br>
gateway 52 provides buyer computer 50 the application form 102 so that the buyer<br>
can complete the form displayed in the Web browser 64 of the buyer computer 50.<br>
Upon completion of the application form, the buyer computer 50 submits the<br>
completed application form 104 to the cpmmerce gateway 52. The commerce<br>
gateway 52 then submits the application data 106 from the completed form to the<br>
credit processing server 53 for account and credit limit authorization. The credit<br>
processing server 53 verifies the application data by requesting identity<br>
information 116 from an identity bureau 56. The identity bureau provides the<br>
requested identity information 118 and if the provided identity information<br>
corresponds to the application data then the credit processing server 53 requests<br>
credit information 108 about the buyer from a credit bureau 58. However, in one<br>
actual embodiment of the present invention, if the application data does not conform<br>
to the identity information from the identity bureau 56, then no virtual payment<br>
account is created and the application is forwarded to customer service for review for<br>
possible fraud detection. As noted above, in the actual embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the identity bureau 56 is a server provided and maintained by an agency for<br>
verifying identity and the credit bureau 58 is a server provided and administrated by a<br>
credit agency for processing credit reports. Hence, the credit processing server 53<br>
requests the desired identity and credit information electronically, e.g., via<br>
appropriate database queries, etc., from the identity bureau 56 and credit bureau 58.<br>
Returning to the illustrated embodiment, the credit bureau 58 provides the<br>
requested credit information 110 to the credit processing server 53 via the connection<br>
with the credit processing server 53. The credit processing server 53 then evaluates<br>
the application, identity and credit information by combining the identity information<br>
from the identity bureau and the credit information received from the credit bureau 58<br>
with application data in order to determine a credit score 111. If the score exceeds a<br>
certain threshold, a credit limit is set and the virtual payment account is created 112.<br>
If the score falls below the threshold, a virtual payment account may still be<br>
created 112, however, all purchases must be prepaid, and the account information is<br>
forwarded to a customer service representative for review for a possible later grant of<br>
credit.<br>
Once the virtual payment account is created, the credit processing server 53<br>
returns the result of the evaluation 113, e.g., approval/denial, prepaid account only,<br>
credit limit, etc., to the commerce gateway 52. The commerce gateway then<br>
requests 120 that the buyer authenticator 65 on the buyer computer generate a public<br>
key encryption key pair 122 comprising a secret key and a public key. The buyer<br>
authenticator 65 then submits the public key to the commerce gateway 124. The<br>
commerce gateway 52 digitally signs the public key to generate a digital<br>
certificate 126. As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, a digital<br>
certificate comprises a public key digitally signed by a trustworthy entity. The<br>
commerce gateway 52 sends the digital certificate and an application result page 114<br>
to the buyer computer 50 for display via the buyer computer's Web browser 64.<br>
Finally, the buyer computer stores the digital certificate 128 for use later with the<br>
virtual payment account.<br>
It will be appreciated that the digital certificate may be stored in the<br>
memory 63 of the buyer computer 50, or on some form of device capable of<br>
interfacing with the buyer computer such as but not limited to a secure token, smart<br>
card or as an encrypted file on some other computer readable medium. It will be<br>
appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the order of the operations in<br>
FIGURE 7 may be altered without substantially affecting the operation of the present<br>
invention. For example, the buyer may be notified of the application results, before<br>
generating the public key encryption pairs.<br>
FIGURES 8A-8G are exemplary Web pages provided to the buyer by the<br>
Web browser 64 of the buyer computer 50 in connection with applying for a virtual<br>
payment account as described above. Using the Web page 600 shown. in<br>
FIGURE 8A, the buyer selects the type of virtual payment account they desire to<br>
apply for, e.g., credit or prepaid, and submits the information by clicking "continue."<br>
Next, the Web pages 605, 610 and 615 shown in FIGURES 8B-8D for the application<br>
form are displayed to the buyer via the Web browser 64. In one actual embodiment<br>
of the present invention, the buyer fills out the application form with the appropriate<br>
application data on-line. Alternatively, the buyer can request the application on a<br>
printed form and submit the printed form via facsimile or regular mail, in which case<br>
a customer service representative will enter the information into the account<br>
database 97 of the credit processing server 53 via the administrative user<br>
computer 54. The application data includes information such as social security<br>
number and income that will be used to determine a credit limit for the buyer.<br>
Information entered by the buyer in the application form is also used for demographic<br>
purposes. For example, banner advertisements can be displayed via the Web<br>
browser 64 on the buyer computer 50 and can be targeted to the buyer based on<br>
demographic information, such as the buyer's age and geographic location.<br>
After the buyer completes the application form contained in the Web pages,<br>
605, 610 and 615 shown in FIGURES 8B-8D and the application is processed by the<br>
credit processing server 53, a Web page 620 as shown in FIGURE 8E is transferred<br>
to and displayed by the buyer computer's Web browser 64, which notifies the buyer<br>
of the results of the application process, i.e., account approval and details of his or<br>
her virtual payment account, including the account credit limit. Once the account<br>
approval is complete and the account accepted by the buyer, the commerce<br>
gateway 52 then transmits the buyer authenticator component 65 (which, as described<br>
above, generates a public key encryption key pair) to the buyers computer for<br>
installation as shown in FIGURE 8F. FIGURE 8G shows an exemplary Web<br>
page 630 that allows the buyer to activate their virtual payment account.<br>
Customizing and Modifying a Virtual Payment Account<br>
Once a virtual payment account has been approved and a credit limit set as<br>
described above, the account can be customized by the buyer. Account information<br>
is then stored in the account database 97 of the credit processing server 53.<br>
FIGURES 9A-9C illustrate an exemplary set of Web pages downloaded from the<br>
commerce gateway 52 and displayed by the Web browser 64 of the buyer's<br>
computer 50 for customizing the buyer's virtual payment account. FIGURES 9A-9B<br>
illustrate Web pages 640 and 645 for main account customization. As shown in<br>
FIGURE 9A, the buyer may customize his or her virtual payment account contact<br>
information and preferences. FIGURE 9B illustrates that the main account holder is<br>
able to configure access controls for their account and all sub-accounts as shown in<br>
Web page 645.<br>
As shown in FIGURE 9C, the buyer may also customize sub-accounts for his<br>
or her own use, or for use by a business partner, spouse and/or children. As will be<br>
described in more detail below, the buyer may then impose his or her own spending<br>
limits on the sub-accounts. In one actual embodiment, reward points accrue in the<br>
main account so that the buyer can transfer the reward points to sub-accounts. It will<br>
be appreciated that in other embodiments, reward points could accrue to individual<br>
sub-accounts, if the buyer so desires. Reward or reward points can later be used, for<br>
example, to make a payment for a purchase, to receive seller discounts, to purchase<br>
frequent flyer miles, etc. It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art<br>
that reward points can be earned by the buyer and applied to his or her virtual<br>
payment account in a myriad of different ways.<br>
It will also be appreciated that a similar process is performed for a seller to<br>
become an authorized or registered seller. In one embodiment, a seller can apply to<br>
become a participant by completing an application form on-line.. In another<br>
embodiment, a seller applies to become a participant of the,system using a more<br>
traditional manual application procedure. In yet another embodiment, some<br>
combination of an on-line and manual process is used. It will be appreciated that if<br>
the seller application process is performed in whole or in part on-line, a Web browser<br>
component (not shown in FIGURE 4) is used to display Web pages on the seller's<br>
computer display 72. The seller forms a contract with the provider of the commerce<br>
gateway 52. In one exemplary embodiment, this contract includes terms such as the<br>
billing period and the fee that will be paid to the commerce gateway provider. Since<br>
a seller is selling a product to a buyer who has a virtual payment account, the seller<br>
will not have sub-accounts in the same sense that a buyer has sub-accounts.<br>
However, a seller selling different types of data can have different accounts. For<br>
example, a book store may have a general account and one or more restricted<br>
accounts, for example, the restricted accounts may prohibit sales of adult products to<br>
minors. This can be in the form of a ratine svstem (e.g., G, PG, PG13, NC17, R,<br>
etc.). In a similar manner to the buyer application process, once a seller has been<br>
approved and the seller account customized, a digital certificate is installed on the<br>
seller's computer 51 to identify the seller as a registered seller in the virtual payment<br>
system. The digital certificate is used in combination with a secret key generated by<br>
the seller server 51 and a public key generated by the seller server and sent to the<br>
gateway 52 to encrypt/decrypt messages for greater security.<br>
It will be appreciated, as described earlier, that a seller can apply for a "buyer"<br>
account. In other words, a seller can purchase products as the owner of a virtual<br>
payment account.<br>
Digital Security<br>
The illustrated embodiment also allows a buyer to create a custom package of<br>
sub-accounts. As will be readily recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art, the<br>
buyer may be provided with any number, type or combination of sub-accounts<br>
depending on the desires of those providing and administrating the virtual payment<br>
system of the present invention.<br>
The buyer can add sub-accounts (e.g., supplemental users, young shoppers,<br>
etc.) via the Web pages 650 shown in FIGURE 9C. Sub-accounts can be customized<br>
for young shoppers as shown in FIGURE 9C, for example, by setting spending limits<br>
for the young shopper and identifying only those seller Web sites from which the<br>
young shopper can purchase products.<br>
As will be described in more detail below, once the virtual payment account<br>
has been authorized 114 and customized, a digital certificate is transferred by the<br>
commerce gateway 52 and installed 128 on the buyer computer 50. The digital<br>
certificate is then used in subsequent transactions as a unique credential to identify<br>
the buyer as a registered holder of a virtual payment account. In an actual<br>
embodiment of the present invention, a buyer or seller is identified as a registered<br>
user of the virtual payment system by the commerce gateway 52 verifying the<br>
commerce gateway's digital signature on the digital certificate associated with the<br>
buyer's virtual payment account<br>
It will be appreciated that several levels of security can be imposed on on-line<br>
transactions. Moving from the lowest level to the highest level, there can be: (1) no<br>
security restrictions imposed; (2) minimal security, such as account name and<br>
password verification; (3) intermediate security, such as a digital certificate or secret<br>
key; (4) high security, such as a transaction signed with a digital signature using the<br>
buyer's secret key; or (5) maximum security, such as a digital signature and additional<br>
access controls, such as an account number, a last purchase verification, smart cards,<br>
secure tokens or some combination thereof. As will be described later, in the actual<br>
embodiment of the virtual payment system described herein, the term "digital<br>
certificate" is used to describe the authorization used; however, it will be appreciated<br>
that a higher level of security such as a digital signature, or a digital signature with<br>
additional access controls may be desired in order to ensure the highest level of<br>
security for all parties involved (i.e., the buyer, the seller, the commerce gateway, and<br>
the credit processing server) in virtual payment account transactions.<br>
In one exemplary embodiment of the security transaction, the seller server 51<br>
digitally signs a purchase offer with a certificate issued by the commerce gateway 52<br>
and sends it to the buyer computer 50; the buyer computer 50 digitally signs the<br>
purchase offer with a certificate issued by the commerce gateway 52 and sends it<br>
back to the seller server 51; the seller server 51 then forwards the doubly signed<br>
purchase offer to the commerce gateway 52; the commerce gateway 52 verifies both<br>
signatures and if they are both valid and the transaction is permissible then signs the<br>
doubly signed offer and returns the resulting triply signed purchase offer to the seller<br>
server 51; the seller server verifies the commerce gateway's 52 signature, and if it is<br>
valid, then the purchase transaction is complete. In the aforementioned example, the<br>
seller server 51 may notify the buyer computer 50 or they may not.<br>
Ordering. Products<br>
Once a buyer has created and customized his or her virtual payment account,<br>
he or she can immediately order products via the Internet if he or she was granted<br>
credit during the account application process. If, however, the buyer's virtual<br>
payment account is only a prepaid account, prepayment must be made before the<br>
buyer can order products. In an alternate embodiment, the buyer with only a prepaid<br>
account can order products, however, shipment of the product will be held until the<br>
prepaid account is sufficiently funded to cover the purchase. More specifically, this<br>
would allow any registered buyer to have a form of "digital layaway" and by ordering<br>
products directly from the Web site of any registered seller. It will be appreciated<br>
that in yet another embodiment, buyer and seller will use the same type of virtual<br>
payment accounts and that any buyer can therefore act as a seller and vice versa.<br>
Additionally, it will be appreciated that a seller can be an auction Web site, in which<br>
a buyer uses his or her virtual payment account to pay for the goods, services and/or<br>
content purchased from the auction Web site.<br>
In one actual embodiment of the present invention depicted in<br>
FIGURES 11A-11C, the buyer may "surf the Web" and visit a registered seller's Web<br>
site, such as "Virtual Store," 1100 using the Web browser 64. Once the buyer visits a<br>
registered seller's Web site, the buyer may order and pay for products offered from<br>
that Web site using his or her virtual payment account. More specifically, a buyer<br>
using buyer computer 50 and Web browser 64 may retrieve the Web page 1100<br>
shown in FIGURE 11A from the seller Web site fictitiously known as "Virtual<br>
Store." The buyer makes a selection of a particular product 1105 by manipulating a<br>
graphics cursor with a pointing device, such as a mouse above the selection 1110 and<br>
"single-clicking." It will be appreciated that other pages, for example, a query page<br>
in which the buyer requests products by a keyword, may be displayed. It will also be<br>
appreciated that the Web page 1100 shown in FIGURE 11A is a simplified example.<br>
It is common for a seller site to allow a buyer to select multiple products and place<br>
them in a "shopping cart." The buyer can then view the items in the cart and, if<br>
desired, remove items from the cart. Once the buyer has selected the desired items<br>
for purchase, the buyer indicates a desire to purchase the selected items, for example,<br>
by clicking an "OK" or a "Buy" button. In the simplified example shown in<br>
FIGURE 11 A, the buyer selects an item, such as the Virtual Store Personal<br>
Computer 1105 and presses the "Order" button 1110 to initiate the purchase<br>
transaction.<br>
After initiating the purchase transaction, the seller server 51 provides the Web<br>
browser 64 of the buyer's computer 50 with the Web page 1150 shown in<br>
FIGURE 1 IB which requests shipping information 1160, such as a street address,<br>
from the buyer. Additionally the Web Page 1150 includes various payment options,<br>
i.e., major credit cards, such as VISA® or MASTERCARD®, with electronic<br>
transmission of credit information. In accordance with the present invention, a<br>
virtual payment account option is also displayed as a payment option for registered<br>
sellers. After entering the shipping and payment information 1160 and selecting the<br>
virtual payment option 1155, the buyer can continue by clicking on the "Purchase"<br>
option 1165. In an actual embodiment of the present invention the buyer<br>
authenticator 65 displays a window 1170 requesting the buyer to select their choice of<br>
accounts 1172, along with an authenticating pass phrase 1175. After selecting an<br>
account and entering the correct pass phrase, the buyer clicks "Continue" 1177 to<br>
proceed with the purchase. In response, the seller server 51 calculates the total cost<br>
of the order, including tax and shipping and handling, and the buyer is presented with<br>
a confirmation screen 1180 as shown in FIGURE 11C. After authorizing the<br>
purchase, the buyer may be presented with a payment confirmation screen 1185 as<br>
shown in FIGURE 1 ID. Additionally, the buyer may be presented with an order<br>
confirmation screen 1190 as shown in FIGURE 1 IE.<br>
FIGURE 12 illustrates the logic implemented by the Web browser 64<br>
installed on the buyer computer 50 when the virtual payment account option 1155 is<br>
selected. The logic begins in a block 220 and proceeds to a block 222 where a secure<br>
connection between the buyer computer 50 and commerce gateway 52 is established.<br>
In an actual embodiment of the present invention, the Secure Socket Layer (SSL)<br>
protocol is used for establishing a secure connection. SSL uses public key encryption<br>
incorporated into a Web browser, such as NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR® Web<br>
browser and Netscape's commerce servers, to secure the information being<br>
transferred over the Internet. The logic then proceeds to a block 224 where a buyer<br>
authenticator component 65 on the buyer computer 50 is executed. It will be<br>
appreciated that the buyer authenticator component 65 can also be included, in part or<br>
in whole, in the Web browser 64. The buyer authenticator component 65 is shown in<br>
more detail in FIGURE 13 and described next.<br>
The buyer authenticator 65 determines whether a buyer is a registered holder<br>
of a virtual payment account or put another way, a registered participant in the closed<br>
virtual payment system of the present invention. The logic of FIGURE 13 begins in a<br>
block 243 and proceeds to a block 244 where an authentication request and container<br>
are received from the Web browser 64. The container includes: transaction<br>
information, such as purchase detail; identification of the parties, such as a buyer<br>
identification which identifies the buyer, e.g., the digital certificate previously issued<br>
to the buyer when he or she created the virtual payment account as described above;<br>
and a seller identification, e.g., the digital certificate issued to the seller upon creation<br>
of a seller account; and context, such as transaction date and time. It will be<br>
appreciated that the container is initially empty, and data is then added to the<br>
container by various components. As stated earlier, embodiments of the invention<br>
implement the buyer authenticator 65 in the Web browser 64. In one actual<br>
embodiment, the buyer authenticator 65 is an applet operating from within the Web<br>
browser 64.<br>
Next, in decision block 246, a test is made to determine if a digital certificate<br>
is installed on the buyer computer 50. The digital certificate may be stored in the<br>
buyer computer 50 memory 63 or one some other device associated with the buyer<br>
computer such as a secure token, a smart card or encrypted on some computer<br>
readable medium. It will be appreciated that other methods of digital identification<br>
can be used. If the digital certificate is installed, the digital certificate identification<br>
is inserted into the authentication container and the authentication request and<br>
container are returned to the Web browser in blocks 248 and 250. The container can<br>
be any one of a variety of data formats, for example, one embodiment of the present<br>
invention a proprietary protocol is used. In an actual embodiment of a present<br>
invention, a public key generated by the buyer's computer and signed by the<br>
commerce gateway (thereby forming a digital certificate) is also inserted into the<br>
container. The secret key is never transmitted anywhere in the virtual payment<br>
system of the present invention. The combination of the secret key and the digital<br>
certificate provides a heightened level of security to the buyer authentication process.<br>
A digital signature is generally a document that has been encrypted by the secret key<br>
of a public key pair. Only the public key of the same key pair will be able to decrypt<br>
the document to its original form. This is particularly useful in demonstrating that<br>
only the holder of the secret key is able to sign (encrypt) the document. In practical<br>
terms, signing a large document using public key cryptography can be very time<br>
consuming. Almost equally effective is creating a cryptographic message digest of<br>
the document and then encrypting the digest with the secret key. Therefore those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that anyone knowing the corresponding public<br>
key and the digest algorithm will be able to verify that the message was not altered<br>
and that it originated from the holder of the corresponding secret key. It will be<br>
appreciated that the digital certificate as used herein refers to an authentication<br>
identifier that is recognized by the provider of the virtual payment account that<br>
adheres to the provider's non-repudiation purchase policies.<br>
If, however, in decision block 246 it is determined that a digital certificate is<br>
not installed on the buyer computer 50, the logic proceeds to a decision block 252<br>
where a test is made to determine if "certificate not present" processing should be<br>
performed. Certificate not present processing allows a buyer to manually enter<br>
identification information when a digital certificate is not present. The identification<br>
information can include information such as an e-mail address, a password and<br>
personal information, for example, a mortgage payment amount. If the result of<br>
decision block 252 is positive, the logic proceeds to an alternate authentication in<br>
block 254. The alternate authentication is shown in more detail in FIGURE 14 and<br>
described next.<br>
The logic of FIGURE 14 begins at a block 1401 and proceeds to block 1405<br>
where the authorization options are displayed to the buyer. Next, it is determined in a<br>
block 1410 if the buyer requested an authorization code as the alternate authorization<br>
mechanism. If the buyer did choose to receive an authorization code, then the Web<br>
browser 64 on the buyer computer is sent an authorization code entry form in a block<br>
1415 and the authorization code is sent to an authentication device in a block 1420.<br>
Exemplary authentication devices 2800 or 2900 are shown in FIGURES 28 and 29<br>
respectively. After receiving the authorization code, the buyer enters the code in the<br>
authorization code entry form in a block 1425.<br>
If however at block 1405 the buyer decides not to request an authorization<br>
code, then from block 1410 the logic flows to a block 1450 where an interactive<br>
authentication Web form 3000 is sent to the Web browser 64 on the buyer's<br>
computer 50. An exemplary interactive authentication Web form 3000 is shown in<br>
FIGURE 30. Next in a block 1455 the buyer completes the interactive authentication<br>
Web form 3000.<br>
Next, the completed authorization entry form from block 1425 or 1455 is<br>
transmitted to the commerce gateway 52 in a block 1430. The logic then proceeds to<br>
a.block 1435 where it is determined whether the authentication was successful. If the<br>
authentication was successful the logic ends at a block 1498 returning a successful<br>
authentication. If the authentication was unsuccessful the logic ends at a block 1499<br>
returning an unsuccessful authentication.<br>
Returning to FIGURE 13 the logic then moves to a block 256 where the<br>
information from the alternate authentication process is passed back through the<br>
buyer authenticator 65 and the logic ends at block 262. If there is no digital<br>
certificate installed ("No" in decision block 246) and certificate not present<br>
processing is not going to be performed, for example by a user selecting<br>
"cancel" 3010 in the certificate not present authorization Web page 3000 shown in<br>
FIGURE 30 (or "No" in decision block 252), the buyer likely does not have a virtual<br>
payment account. Accordingly, the logic of FIGURE 13 proceeds to a decision<br>
block 258 where a test is made to determine if the buyer wishes to apply for a virtual<br>
payment account. If the buyer wishes to apply for a virtual payment account, the<br>
logic proceeds to a block 260, in which the buyer is allowed to apply for a virtual<br>
payment account as shown in FIGURE 15 and described next. Otherwise, the buyer<br>
authenticator 65 returns an unsuccessful authorization message to the Web<br>
browser 64 in a block 261 and the logic ends in block 262.<br>
FIGURE 15 illustrates the logic implemented by the Web browser 64 when a<br>
buyer applies for a virtual payment account. It will be appreciated that applying for a<br>
virtual payment account can be invoked by a buyer requesting an account directly<br>
from the commerce gateway 52 or by a buyer who is not registered attempting to<br>
order a product from a registered seller. In either case, the logic for applying for a<br>
virtual payment account via a Web browser 64 begins in a block 270 and proceeds to<br>
a block 272 where a request for an application form is received by the Web<br>
browser 64. Next in a block 273, the request for an application form is sent to the<br>
Web server component 87 of the commerce gateway 52, The requested application<br>
form is then received from the Web server component 87 of the commerce<br>
gateway 52 and displayed in the buyer's Web browser in a block 274.<br>
Next, in a block 275, the completed account "application form is sent to the<br>
commerce gateway 52 and processed by an enrollment server component 89 as<br>
shown in FIGURE 16, and described next. In another embodiment, the account<br>
application is sent to the transaction server component 84 that handles financial<br>
transactions and also handles non-financial transactions, such as enrollment.<br>
The logic of the enrollment server 89 shown in FIGURE 16 begins in a<br>
block 280 and proceeds to a block 282 where a completed application form is<br>
received from the Web browser. Next, in a block 283 identity information, such as<br>
name, employer, current residence, etc., is requested from an identity bureau 56 via<br>
the identity bureau adapter 79 whose logic is shown in FIGURE 27 and described<br>
next.<br>
Accordingly, the logic of FIGURE 27 begins in a block 2705 and proceeds to<br>
a block 2710 where the identity request is received. The request is then formatted to<br>
be compatible with the particular identity bureau in a block 2715. Next, the logic<br>
proceeds to a block 2720 where the formatted request is then sent to identity<br>
bureau 56. The result. of the request is received from the identity bureau in a<br>
block 2725. Next, in a block 2730, the result is then returned to requester. The logic<br>
of FIGURE 27 then ends in a block 2735.<br>
Returning to FIGURE 16, if in a block 284, which in this case is the<br>
enrollment server 89, it is determined that the identity information received from the<br>
identity bureau 56 via the identity bureau adapter 79 corresponds to the information<br>
in the application received in block 282, then processing continues to a block 285<br>
where the enrollment server requests credit information, such as income, length of<br>
time with current employer, length of time at current residence, etc., from a credit<br>
bureau 58 via the credit processing server adapter 86 as shown in FIGURE 21 and<br>
described later with reference to a purchase authorization request.<br>
Upon receipt of the credit information, the logic proceeds to a block 286<br>
where the application is scored based on the identity bureau information and credit<br>
bureau information in combination with internal criteria. The internal criteria<br>
provide a score for the various pieces of credit information. For example, incomes<br>
will be broken down into ranges, with a point value assigned to each range.<br>
Similarly, point values will be assigned based on the time the applicant has lived at<br>
his or her current residence, etc. The points for each piece of credit information are<br>
combined to determine a score for the applicant. The score equates to the credit<br>
worthiness of the buyer and is used to determine if the applicant will receive a credit<br>
account, or if the score falls in an intermediate range, a prepaid account, and if so, to<br>
establish a credit limit for the applicant, i.e., buyer. Next, if the score is above a<br>
threshold logic ends with a successful enrollment result returned to the Web browser<br>
in a block 288. However if the score is below a certain threshold or if the identity<br>
information provided by the identity bureaus 56 does not correspond to that of the<br>
buyer's application, then an unsuccessful result is returned in a block 289. Processing<br>
then returns to FIGURE 15.<br>
In FIGURE 15, once a response is received from the enrollment server 89 a<br>
block 265 examines whether an account was created. If it was then a request is sent<br>
to the buyer computer 50 to generate a public key encryption pair in block 267 and to<br>
submit the public key to the enrollment server 89 on the commerce gateway 52. The<br>
enrollment server then signs the public key to create a digital certificate and returns a<br>
successful enrollment Web page 620, as shown in FIGURE 8E which is received in a<br>
block 276 along with the digital certificate in a block 278. If at block 265 it was<br>
determined that an account was not created then an unsuccessful application Web<br>
page is displayed (not shown) at a block 266. In the case of applying for a virtual<br>
payment account, the result page 620 provides details of the new account for the<br>
buyer, or contains a message informing the buyer that there was an error creating the<br>
account. The logic of FIGURE 15 of applying for a virtual payment account then<br>
ends in a block 279 and processing returns to FIGURE 13.<br>
Referring again to FIGURE 13, after the buyer has applied for a virtual<br>
payment account, the logic returns to decision block 246 where the test to determine<br>
if a digital certificate is installed on the buyer computer 50 is repeated. Depending on<br>
the results of decision block 246, either blocks 248-250 or blocks 252-256 are<br>
repeated for the recent applicant of a virtual payment account. The logic then ends in<br>
a block 262.<br>
While the logic of authenticating a buyer as shown in FIGURE 13 and<br>
described herein uses a digital certificate as the primary means for authenticating a<br>
buyer, it will be appreciated that other methods are possible. For example, a lesser<br>
level of security could be employed, whereby a user could be required to enter<br>
identifying information, such as the information entered in alternate authentication<br>
shown in FIGURE 14. Alternatively, a greater degree of security could be employed<br>
whereby a digital certificate is required, and "certificate not present" processing is not<br>
allowed. Or, an even greater level of security could be used requiring a digital<br>
signature and other verifying information from the buyer.<br>
Returning to FIGURE 12, after buyer authentication is completed in<br>
block 224, the logic proceeds to a decision block 226, where a test is made to<br>
determine if the buyer authentication was successful. If not, the logic proceeds to a<br>
block 227 where an error message is displayed on the buyer computer 50 by the Web<br>
browser 64 notifying the buyer of the failed authentication. The logic of FIGURE 12<br>
ends in a block 242.<br>
However, if the buyer was successfully authenticated, the logic proceeds to a<br>
block 228 where a virtual payment account selection Web page 1170 as shown in<br>
FIGURE 1 IB is displayed. Included in the requested information of the virtual<br>
payment account selection Web page 1170 is an identification of the applicable<br>
account or sub-account to which the purchase should be applied. Next, in a<br>
block 230, sub-account and password information (used to unlock the buyer's digital<br>
certificate) are obtained from the buyer from the information entered in the virtual<br>
payment account selection Web page 1170 of FIGURE 1 IB when the buyer indicates<br>
that the information has been entered by selecting "Continue" 1177. The logic of<br>
FIGURE 12 then proceeds to a block 232 where the sub-account, and an<br>
authentication container are sent to the commerce gateway 52 and processed by the<br>
account identification container generator 88 shown in FIGURE 17 and described<br>
next.<br>
The logic of FIGURE 17 begins in a block 800 and proceeds to a block 802<br>
where the sub-account and authentication container are received from Web<br>
browser 64 of the buyer computer 50. The logic then proceeds to a block 804 where<br>
an internal account identification associated with authentication container is<br>
determined. An empty account identification container is then created in a block 806.<br>
Next, in a block 808, internal account identification and sub-account information is<br>
added to the empty account identification container. The logic then proceeds to a<br>
block 810 where an internal digital signature is applied to the account identification<br>
container. For example, message digest logic can be used by applying an algorithm<br>
that takes a variable length message and produces a fixed length digest as output<br>
using a one-way hashing algorithm that establishes the message as cryptographically<br>
secure. Finally, the account identification container is returned to the Web<br>
browser 64 in a block 812. The logic of FIGURE 17 then ends at a block 814, and<br>
processing returns to FIGURE 12.<br>
Returning to FIGURE 12, after the sub-account and authentication container<br>
are sent to the commerce gateway 52, the logic then proceeds to a block 234 where<br>
the logic waits to receive the account identification container from the account<br>
identification container generator component 88 of the commerce gateway 52. Once<br>
the account identification container is received from the commerce gateway 52, the<br>
logic proceeds to a block 238 where a purchase request is sent to the commerce<br>
engine 75 in the form of a request and account identification container for processing<br>
as shown in FIGURE 18 and described next.<br>
The commerce engine 75 is the component of the seller server 51 that<br>
determines whether or not the order will be processed and whether the requested<br>
product will ultimately be provided to the buyer. It will be appreciated that<br>
commerce engines are well known in the art. The commerce engine component 75<br>
used in conjunction with the commerce gateway adapter component 76 allows the<br>
virtual payment system of the present invention to expand existing technology that is<br>
currently used for traditional credit systems to encompass the virtual payment<br>
account of the present system. It will be further appreciated that while the<br>
embodiment shown and described modifies the commerce engine to achieve this<br>
functionality (which may be possible through existing API calls of the commerce<br>
engine), other embodiments are possible. This expanded commerce engine<br>
functionality is shown in FIGURE 18.<br>
The logic of FIGURE 18 begins in a block 300 and proceeds to a block 302<br>
where a purchase request and account identification container are received from the<br>
Web browser 64 of the buyer computer 50. The logic then proceeds to a decision<br>
block 304 where a test is made to determine whether the purchase request should be<br>
forwarded to the commerce gateway adapter 76. If the purchase request is to<br>
purchase products using a virtual payment account, the request should be forwarded<br>
to the commerce gateway adapter 76 for processing in accordance with the. virtual<br>
payment system of the present invention. In another embodiment, only the request<br>
(without the account identification container) is received from the Web browser in<br>
block 302, and if it is determined in decision block 304 that the purchase request<br>
should be forwarded to the commerce gateway adapter 76, the account identification<br>
is then obtained from the Web browser 64. In either case, if it is determined in<br>
decision block 304, that the purchase request should be forwarded to the commerce<br>
gateway adapter 76, the logic proceeds to a block 306 where the request is forwarded<br>
to the commerce gateway adapter. The commerce gateway adapter 76 is shown in<br>
more detail in FIGURE 19 and described next.<br>
The commerce gateway adapter 76 is a component residing on the seller<br>
server 51 that allows the seller server to communicate directly with the transaction<br>
server component 84 of the commerce gateway 52 in order to expand the<br>
authorization function of the commerce engine 75 to include virtual payment account<br>
transactions. Accordingly, the logic of FIGURE 19 begins in a block 330 proceeds to<br>
a block 332 where the forwarded purchase request and account identification<br>
container are received from the commerce engine 75. Next, in a block 334 the<br>
purchase request and account identification container are sent to the transaction<br>
server 84 in the form of a transaction request for further processing as shown in<br>
FIGURE 20 and described next.<br>
The transaction server component 84 of the commerce gateway 52 is<br>
responsible for interfacing with the other components of the system and determining<br>
whether or not a requested transaction should be applied to a buyer's virtual payment<br>
account. The logic of FIGURE 20 begins in a block 350 and proceeds to a block 352<br>
where the transaction request is received. Next, in a block 353 the account<br>
identification container is decoded and verified. The origin or source of the request<br>
as well as the context, i.e., date and time, of the request are then recorded in<br>
memory 83 of the commerce gateway 52 in a block 354. Next, the logic proceeds to<br>
a decision block 356 where a test is made to determine whether the requested<br>
transaction is permissible. A variety of factors can be considered in making the<br>
determination of whether a requested transaction is permissible. For example,<br>
spending limits cannot be exceeded, and user-imposed limitations, such as those put<br>
on a young shopper account, e.g., sites from which the young shopper can make<br>
purchases and hours during which the young shopper can make purchases as shown<br>
in FIGURE 9C, cannot be violated.<br>
If the transaction is not permissible, the logic proceeds to a block 357 where<br>
an impermissible transaction message is sent to the requester (e.g., the commerce<br>
gateway adapter 76 in the context of a purchase request). The logic of FIGURE 20<br>
then ends in a block 376. If, however, the transaction is permissible, the logic<br>
proceeds from decision block 356 to a block 360 where the transaction request is sent<br>
to a credit processing server adapter 86 for further processing as shown in<br>
FIGURE 21 and described next.<br>
The credit processing server adapter 86 is the component residing on the<br>
commerce gateway 52 that allows commerce gateway 52 components, such as the<br>
transaction server 84 and the enrollment server 89 to communicate directly with the<br>
various sub-systems of the credit processing server 53, which provide for the<br>
application of the requested transaction to the buyer's actual payment account.<br>
Accordingly, the logic of FIGURE 21 begins in a block 380 and proceeds to a<br>
block 382 where the request is received. For example, a purchase authorization<br>
request or a refund request is received from the transaction server 84 and a credit<br>
information request is received from the enrollment server 89. The request is then<br>
formatted to be compatible with the appropriate credit processing sub-system, i.e., the<br>
account/billing sub-system 94, the payment processing sub-system 95 and/or the<br>
account enrollment sub-system 96, on the credit processing server 53 in a block 384.<br>
Next, the logic proceeds to a block 386 where the formatted request is then sent to<br>
credit processing server 53 for processing by the appropriate credit processing<br>
sub-system, as shown in FIGURE 22 and described next.<br>
For any credit processing sub-system, the logic of FIGURE 22 begins in a<br>
block 390 and proceeds to a block 392 where the transaction request is received from<br>
the credit processing server adapter 86. Next, account data and sub-account data are<br>
retrieved in block 394 from the appropriate database, e.g., account database 97 and<br>
financial database 98. Standard credit transaction processing is then performed in a<br>
block 398. Examples of standard transactions for the account/billing sub-system 94<br>
include: creating and maintaining accounts, including holding account information<br>
and account holder information, such as name and address; calculating interest;<br>
calculating minimum monthly payments; generating electronic monthly statements;<br>
and calculating other charges, known as discounts. The discount is the portion of the<br>
transaction amount that will go to the provider of the commerce gateway 52, and can<br>
be determined on a fixed amount per transaction basis, or a percentage of transaction<br>
amount basis. Examples of standard transactions for the payment processing sub-<br>
system 95 include: collecting payments from buyers and applying the payments to the<br>
buyer's account; transferring funds between sellers and buyer, for example by<br>
interfacing with financial institutions 59 for ACH transactions. Examples of standard<br>
transactions for the account enrollment sub-system include: obtaining credit<br>
information from credit bureaus; providing the credit information to the commerce<br>
gateway 52 for scoring; determining a credit score based on the credit information<br>
and providing the score to the commerce gateway; and providing scoring information<br>
to the account/billing sub-system 94 for account creation.<br>
The logic then proceeds to a block 399 where necessary account adjustments<br>
are applied, if applicable. For example, the account balance will be reduced by the<br>
amount of an authorized purchase transaction. In one embodiment of the present<br>
invention, reward points are accrued at the time of purchase, but committed later, for<br>
example during the periodic, e.g., monthly, statement preparation process.<br>
Alternatively, reward points may not accrue until payment is made for the product to<br>
which the points are attributed. Next, the transaction result, such as the credit<br>
information or the purchase authorization, is sent to the credit processing server<br>
adapter 86 in a block 400. The logic of FIGURE 22 then ends in a block 402 and<br>
processing returns to FIGURE 21.<br>
Returning to FIGURE 21, the result of the transaction request is received<br>
from the credit processing sub-system 94, 95 or 96 in a block 387. Next, in a<br>
block 388, the result is then returned to requester, e.g., the result of a purchase<br>
authorization request is returned to the transaction server 84 and credit information,<br>
for example, a credit limit, is returned to the enrollment server 89 in response to<br>
request for a credit information request to be used for establishing a buyer's account.<br>
The logic of FIGURE 21 then ends in a block 389 and processing returns to the<br>
requester, e.g., transaction server 84 (FIGURE 20) or enrollment server 89<br>
(FIGURE 16).<br>
Returning to FIGURE 20, once the transaction server receives the response to<br>
its transaction request, e.g., authorization result of a purchase request, from the credit<br>
processing adapter in a block 363, the logic proceeds to a block 364 where the<br>
transaction record, for example purchase information including amount of purchase,<br>
is stored in memory 83 of the commerce gateway 52. The logic then proceeds to a<br>
decision block 366, where a test is made to determine if the transaction was<br>
successfully processed. If so, the logic proceeds to a block 370 where a transaction<br>
response with a valid status is then sent to the requester (e.g., the commerce gateway<br>
adapter 76 or the Web browser 64, whichever the case may be). If the transaction<br>
was not successfully processed, the logic proceeds from decision block 366 to a<br>
block 374 where a transaction response with an error status is then returned to the<br>
requester in a block 376.<br>
After a valid transaction response 370, an error transaction response 374, or<br>
an impermissible transaction response 357 is sent to the requester, the logic of<br>
FIGURE 20 ends in block 376 and processing returns to the requester. In the case of<br>
a purchase request, the requester is the commerce gateway adapter 76. In one<br>
exemplary embodiment, a record of all transactions is stored in the financial<br>
database 98.<br>
Returning to FIGURE 19, after the response to the purchase request made by<br>
the commerce gateway adapter 76 is received from the transaction server in a<br>
block 336, the logic proceeds to a block 338 where the response including the<br>
transaction status is formatted to be compatible with the commerce engine 75. The<br>
formatted response is then forwarded to the commerce engine in a block 340. The<br>
logic of FIGURE 19 then ends in a block 342 and processing returns to the commerce<br>
engine 75 in FIGURE 18.<br>
Returning to FIGURE 18, once a response is received by the commerce<br>
engine 75 from the commerce gateway adapter 86 in a block 308, the authorized and<br>
ordered product is shipped to the buyer in a block 310. It will be appreciated by those<br>
of ordinary skill in the art that if the ordered product is capable of being downloaded,<br>
e.g., the product is an electronically stored good, a URL for a premium content Web<br>
site, etc., the product will simply be transferred by the seller server 51 to the buyer<br>
computer 50. Otherwise, the product will be shipped or provided by more traditional<br>
methods, e.g., regular mail, hand delivery, etc. Once shipment is complete, the logic<br>
then proceeds to a block 312 where a settlement request is sent to the commerce<br>
gateway 52 in order to initiate movement of funds. In an actual embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the seller submits the transaction into a settlement batch for<br>
payment when the settlement batch for that seller is next processed. The timing of<br>
the processing could be that night or at a later date based on the contract, i.e., terms<br>
of the purchase transaction. FIGURE 41 illustrates an exemplary Web page 4100 for<br>
designating when batches should be processed. Settlement transactions are described<br>
in FIGURE 24 in more detail below with reference to FIGURE 24.<br>
Returning to FIGURE 18, in a block 314, a response confirming fulfillment of<br>
the order is sent to the Web browser 64 of the buyer's computer 50. The logic of<br>
FIGURE 18 then ends in a block 324.<br>
However if at decision block 304, it is determined that the purchase request<br>
should not be forwarded to the commerce gateway 52; the logic proceeds to a<br>
block 316 where standard commerce engine processing is performed. More<br>
specifically, in block 316 traditional credit or debit card authorization is performed<br>
such as approval or denial for the use of a credit card, e.g., VISA® or<br>
MASTERCARD®, for the specified purchase amount. Next, the authorized goods<br>
are shipped in a block 318. The logic then proceeds to a block 320 where a<br>
settlement request is sent to the traditional credit provider, e.g., VISA® or<br>
MASTERCARD®. A response confirming fulfillment of the order is then sent to the<br>
Web browser 64 of the buyer computer 50 in a block 322. The logic of FIGURE 18<br>
then ends in block 324 and processing returns to FIGURE 12.<br>
Returning to FIGURE 12, once the Web browser 64 of the buyer computer 50<br>
receives a response to its purchase request in a block 240, the logic proceeds to a<br>
block 241 where an order confirmation Web page 1190 is displayed as shown in<br>
FIGURE 1 IE. The logic of FIGURE 12 then ends in block 242.<br>
FIGURE 23 is a diagram illustrating the actions taken by the buyer's<br>
computer 50, the seller server 51 and the commerce gateway 52 for ordering products<br>
using a virtual payment account system. This diagram presents a high-level view of<br>
the detailed processing shown in the flow charts described above. In response to an<br>
inquiry into purchasing a product 2305, a seller returns a purchase offer 2310 to the<br>
buyer's computer 50. At this point, the buyer has the option of beginning the<br>
purchasing process as shown in FIGURE 12. To continue the buyer authenticator 65<br>
checks to see which credentials, e.g. certificates, are available to the buyer and selects<br>
all available credentials to be used by the commerce gateway 2315 to authenticate the<br>
buyer. The buyer computer 50 then requests a list of all accounts or sub-accounts<br>
2320 for these credentials from the commerce gateway 52. The commerce gateway<br>
52 returns only those accounts that are usable by the buyer 2325 using the selected<br>
credentials. The buyer computer 50 then generates a purchase confirmation 2330<br>
using one of the accounts on the list returned from the commerce gateway 52. Buyer<br>
computer 50 then sends the purchase confirmation 2335 to the seller server 51. The<br>
seller server 51 requests authorization 2340 from the commerce gateway to verify<br>
that the purchase confirmation is valid. The commerce gateway then returns an<br>
authorization 2350 that the purchase confirmation is valid. The seller server 51 may<br>
then notify 2355 the buyer computer 50 that the purchase confirmation was<br>
authorized. The seller server then prepares the purchase for delivery 2360. At this<br>
point, the seller may request a settlement transaction 2365 from the commerce<br>
gateway 52. Which would then provide a settlement transaction 2370 back to the<br>
seller server 51. The seller server 51 may then notify 2375 the buyer computer 50 of<br>
delivery details. Finally, the good(s) or service(s) that the buyer purchased are<br>
delivered 2380.<br>
If the seller is an auction Web site, the authorization 2340 sent by the<br>
commerce gateway 52 to the seller server 51 includes information such as a buyer<br>
account identification, a seller identification, a seller sale offering, a buyer<br>
authentication, a seller authentication, and a master identification, i.e., identification<br>
of the commerce gateway 52 provider. Particular to this type of response is an<br>
expiration date/time that is used to signal the shorter of the maximum times that the<br>
buyer and the seller are willing to "reserve" funds associated with this transaction. If<br>
the transaction, i.e., settlement request 2365, is not received by the commerce<br>
gateway 52 before the expiration date/time of the transaction, the products and/or<br>
funds will be released back to their owners. At a later time, once the buyer has<br>
committed to the purchase, the buyer releases an authorization to the provider of the<br>
commerce gateway 52 knowing that the seller has proven ability to ship the products<br>
on demand without delay. This initiates the actual settlement of funds and triggers<br>
payment to the seller in the next settlement batch, without any further interaction with<br>
the seller. This payment method supports buyer-initiated, pre-approved purchases<br>
with expiration date/time, such as auction and gift-certificate purchases.<br>
It will be appreciated that FIGURE 23 illustrates processing of a valid<br>
purchase transaction. If there is an error at any time during the processing, e.g., buyer<br>
is not authorized because he or she is not a registered buyer, has exceeded his or her<br>
spending limit, etc., processing will terminate after an appropriate error response has<br>
been returned to the buyer computer 50 for display to the buyer via the Web<br>
browser 64.<br>
Settlement Transaction<br>
When a seller establishes a seller account, a contract is formed defining the<br>
relationship between the seller and the commerce gateway provider. That contract<br>
defines the terms, such as when payments will be funded and what fee shall be given<br>
to the commerce gateway provider. The commerce gateway fee can be a per<br>
transaction fee or a percentage fee based on the amount of a transaction. The logic<br>
for settlement transactions for a virtual payment account is similar to the logic used<br>
for processing standard credit card settlement transactions. After the seller ships the<br>
product, the seller sends a settlement transaction to the commerce gateway 52 as<br>
shown in FIGURE 24. It will be appreciated that the logic performed by the seller<br>
server 51 can be performed by the commerce engine component 75, or some other<br>
component, for example, a Web browser (not shown) residing on the seller server 51,<br>
FIGURE 24 illustrates the logic implemented by seller server 51 when the<br>
seller wishes to perform a settlement transaction. The logic begins in a block 530 and<br>
proceeds to a block 532 where a secure connection between the seller computer 51<br>
and commerce gateway 52 is established, using the same logic shown and described<br>
with reference to the buyer in block 222 of FIGURE 12. The logic then proceeds to a<br>
block 534 where the seller authenticator process is run. The seller authenticator<br>
process is similar to the buyer authenticator process shown in FIGURE 13 and<br>
described above. Next, in a decision block 536 a test is made to determine if the<br>
seller is a registered participant (i.e., seller's digital certificate was issued by the<br>
commerce gateway provider, seller's digital certificate has not expired and seller's<br>
digital certificate has not been revoked). If not, the logic proceeds to a block 538<br>
where a seller authentication error message is displayed on the seller server<br>
display 72, for example, via a Web browser. The logic of FIGURE 24 then ends in a<br>
block 548.<br>
If the seller authenticator process is successful, the logic proceeds from<br>
decision block 536 to a block 544 where a settlement request is sent to the transaction<br>
server 84 on the commerce gateway 52. As shown and described in FIGURE 25, the<br>
transaction server 84 forwards the request to the credit processing server adapter 86,<br>
which in turn forwards the transaction request to the appropriate credit processing<br>
sub-system. In the case of a settlement transaction request, the payment processing<br>
sub-system 95 processes the transaction. The payment processing sub-system<br>
forwards the settlement request to the financial institution 59. The financial<br>
institution funds the transactions into the commerce gateway provider's account. The<br>
commerce gateway provider takes its percentage and pays the sellers their portion.<br>
The financial institution 59 waits for their billing cycle, e.g., monthly, and then<br>
charges the buyers for their purchases plus interest charges. The financial institution<br>
waits for the buyer payments. If the buyer does not pay, standard late payment<br>
processing, such as late notices, finance charges, etc. is performed.<br>
The logic of FIGURE 25 begins in a block 2505 and proceeds to a block 2510<br>
where the settlement request is received. The origin or source of the settlement<br>
request as well as the context, i.e., date and time, of the request are then recorded in<br>
memory 83 of the commerce gateway 52 in a block 2515. Next, the logic proceeds to<br>
a decision block 2520 where a test is made to determine whether the requested<br>
settlement is permissible. A variety of factors can be considered in making the!<br>
determination of whether a requested settlement is permissible. Some factors might<br>
include a settlement request for a transaction that did not have a purchase<br>
confirmation from a buyer, that had a purchase confirmation from a buyer whose<br>
account did not hold sufficient funds, for an auction settlement whose time had<br>
expired or whose credentials were no longer valid. It will be appreciated that yet<br>
other factors may cause a settlement transaction to be impermissible. If the<br>
transaction is not permissible, the logic proceeds to a block 2560 where an<br>
impermissible settlement request message is sent to the requester, i.e., the seller, in<br>
this case. If, however, the transaction is permissible, the logic proceeds from<br>
decision block 2520 to a block 2525 where the transaction request is sent to a credit<br>
processing server adapter 86 for further processing as shown in FIGURE 21 and<br>
described above. Continuing in FIGURE 20, once the transaction server receives the<br>
response to its transaction request, e.g., authorization result of a settlement request,<br>
from the credit processing .adapter in a block 2530, the logic proceeds to a block 2535<br>
where a transaction record, for example purchase information including amount of<br>
purchase, is stored in memory 83 of the commerce gateway 52. The logic then<br>
proceeds to a decision block 2540, where a test is made to determine if the<br>
transaction was successfully processed. If so, the logic proceeds to a block 2545<br>
where a transaction response with a valid status is then sent to the requester, i.e., the<br>
seller in this case. If the transaction was not successfully processed, the logic<br>
proceeds from decision block 2540 to a block 2555 where a transaction response with<br>
an error status is then returned to the requester.<br>
After a valid transaction response 2545, an error transaction response 2555, or<br>
an impermissible transaction response 2560 is sent to the requester, the logic of<br>
FIGURE 25 ends in block 2550 and processing returns to the requester.<br>
Referring back to FIGURE 24, after the transaction server 84 has processed<br>
the settlement transaction and provided the results of the settlement transaction to the<br>
seller's computer 51, the result of the settlement transaction is displayed on the<br>
seller's display 73, for example, via the seller server's Web browser. The logic of<br>
FIGURE 24 then ends in block 548.<br>
Refund Transaction<br>
FIGURE 26 illustrates the logic implemented by the present invention when a<br>
refund transaction is initiated, for example, when a buyer disputes a charge on his or<br>
her virtual payment account. As with any payment dispute, it must be determined<br>
whether the buyer will receive all or a portion of the disputed amount. This process<br>
is external to the virtual payment system of the present invention. The determination<br>
of whether the dispute has merit is determined by the seller. If the seller determines<br>
that the dispute has merit, the seller notifies a customer service representative and a<br>
refund transaction is initiated. In the embodiment shown in FIGURE 26 and<br>
described herein, if it is determined that an amount disputed by a buyer is subject to a<br>
refund, a customer service representative initiates the refund, or chargeback<br>
transaction via the administrative computer 54 shown in FIGURE 2. In one actual<br>
embodiment, the administrative computer is a "dumb terminal" by which the<br>
customer service representative enters information directly into the transaction<br>
server 84 on the commerce gateway 52. In another embodiment, the administrative<br>
computer may have a Web browser that allows the administrator to enter the<br>
information using Web pages available only on the LAN 44 behind the firewall 55,<br>
i.e., the buyer and seller do not have access to these administrative Web pages.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 26, the logic begins in a block 550 and proceeds to a<br>
block 552 where the refund information including account, sub-account and amount<br>
is obtained. The refund transaction information is then sent to the transaction<br>
server 84 by the administrative computer 54 in a block 554 in the form of a refund,<br>
request. Transaction server 84 processing is shown and described with reference to<br>
FIGURE 20.<br>
As also noted above, in processing the refund request, the transaction<br>
server 84 will forward a transaction request to the credit processing server 53 for<br>
processing by the account/billing sub-system 94 as shown in FIGURE 22. A refund<br>
applied to a buyer's virtual payment account causes the buyer's balance to decrease<br>
by the amount of the payment. Still referring to FIGURE 26, after the transaction<br>
server 84 has processed the refund transaction, the result of the transaction processing<br>
is received and displayed by the administrative computer 54. The logic of<br>
FIGURE 26 then ends in a block 558. Unlike the purchase transaction, the refund<br>
transaction is not initiated by the buyer via the Web browser 64; therefore, the buyer<br>
is notified by other means, for example by sending an e-mail message to the buyer's<br>
computer 50. It will also be appreciated that in yet other embodiments of the present<br>
invention, the seller server 51 may initiate the refund request as opposed to the<br>
administrative computer 54.<br>
Buyer Account Management<br>
Other transactions normally associated with an account such as a standard<br>
credit card account are also applicable to the virtual payment account of the present<br>
invention. FIGURES 10A-10C illustrate some examples of Web pages used by a<br>
buyer with a virtual payment account. Processing of these transactions is similar to<br>
other transaction processing as illustrated in flow diagrams and described above, and<br>
therefore will not be discussed in further detail herein. FIGURE 10A illustrates a<br>
Web page 660 containing details of a primary account 632 along with sub-<br>
accounts 634. FIGURE 10B illustrates an exemplary Web page 665 summarizing the<br>
sub-accounts for a master account 634. FIGURE IOC illustrates a transaction<br>
summary Web page 670 for the sub-accounts for a given master account.<br>
Seller Reports<br>
It is often desirable for seller's to have detailed reports available to judge the<br>
current state of their business. Accordingly, the present invention maintains records<br>
of transactions in readily retrievable formats. It is also desirable that competitors not<br>
have access to the same reports on the details of a seller's business. Accordingly, the<br>
present invention provides for secure authenticated access to a seller's reports.<br>
FIGURE 42 illustrates the logic for generating seller reports. The logic starts at a<br>
block 4201 and proceeds to a block 4210 that establishes a secure connection<br>
between the seller computer 51 and the commerce gateway 52. The logic then<br>
proceeds to a block 4215 where the seller is authenticated much as the buyer<br>
authenticator illustrated in FIGURE 13. The flow continues to a block 4220 where a<br>
test is performed to see if the seller has been authenticated. If the authentication was<br>
successful, the logic continues to a block 4225 where the seller requests the<br>
transaction server 84 to generate a report. At a block 4230 the transaction server<br>
retrieves relevant information and generates a report, which in a block 4235 is<br>
received by the seller computer for viewing by the seller. The logic ends in a<br>
block 4299.<br>
In one actual embodiment of the present invention, the commerce gateway 52<br>
requests report information from the credit processing server 53, in particular from<br>
the financial database 98 stored on the credit processing server. It will be appreciated<br>
by those of ordinary skill in the art, that a financial database may be used to store<br>
information forreport generation, yet may also store information relevant for other<br>
purposes.<br>
FIGURES 31, 33, 35, 37 and 39 illustrate exemplary Web pages 3100, 3300,<br>
3500, 3700 and 3900 illustrating exemplary reports available to a seller. FIGURE 31<br>
shows an exemplary Web page 3100 with a graph charting the number of sales<br>
occurring each month during a year-long period. FIGURE 33 shows an exemplary<br>
Web page 3300 with a table indicating the status and information on particular orders<br>
received. FIGURE 35 shows an exemplary Web page 3500 with a table listing<br>
transactions that have already been processed for each order, and the result of that<br>
processing. FIGURE 37 shows an exemplary Web page 3700 with a table listing<br>
item sales and along with relevant statistics such as number of units sold, what<br>
percentage of units have been sold and what percent of overall sales does that item<br>
account for. FIGURE 39 shows an exemplary Web page 3900 with a table listing<br>
transactions that have yet to be processed and are still wait for the next batch of<br>
transaction to be run.<br>
FIGURES 32, 34, 36, 38 and 40 illustrate exemplary Web page forms 3200,<br>
3400, 3600, 3800 and 4000 for customizing seller reports.<br>
While the preferred embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and<br>
described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, it will also be<br>
appreciated that there are other transactions applicable to a virtual payment account<br>
of the present invention, e.g., account closure, credit limit modification, overdue<br>
account notification, etc. It will be appreciated that these transactions can be initiated<br>
by various components of the system, for example a financial institution may institute<br>
a change in a credit limit by sending a request to one of the sub-systems on the credit<br>
processing server. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the requests for<br>
such transactions are processed by the virtual payment system of the present<br>
invention in a manner similar to the processing of the purchase settlement, and refund<br>
transactions described in detail above.<br>

A virtual payment system for ordering and paying for goods, services and content over an<br>
internetwork is disclosed. The virtual payment system is a secure, closed system<br>
comprising registered buyer and seller computers (50, 51). A buyer computer becomes<br>
registered by applying for a virtual payment account. A seller computer becomes<br>
registered by applying for a seller account. A buyer can instantly open an account<br>
on-line. Once an account is established, a digital certificate is stored on the registered<br>
participant's computer. The buyer can then order from a seller and charge it to the virtual<br>
payment account. When the product is shipped, the seller notifies a commerce gateway<br>
component (52), which in turn notifies the credit processing server that applies the<br>
charges to the buyer's virtual payment account.</td>
