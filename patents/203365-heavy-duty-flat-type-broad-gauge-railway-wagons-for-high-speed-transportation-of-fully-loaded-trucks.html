				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to heavy-duty flat-type broad-gauge railway wagons for high-speed transportation of fully-loaded trucks.<br>
The  invention relates,  more particularly,   to the  design and construction of special purpose,  heavy-duty,   flat-type wagons which are provided each with (i) an underframe well into which a truck is rolled on by the driver of the truck,  and (ii) a specially designed and constructed locking device for holding the said truck in the said well securely so as to prevent any displacement thereof in the lateral,  forward,  backward and upward directions during its transportation on broad-gauge  (i.e.   1676 mm wide) railways at a speed up to 75 km/hr with loaded trucks and up to 100 km/hr with unloaded trucks,  with provision for rolling the truck off the well of the wagon at the destination by the driver of the truck after releasing the locking device.<br>
The wagons according to the invention are termed WHEELS ON WHEELS (WOW).<br>
The transportation of loaded trucks in the invented wagons eliminates the cost of loading and unloading of goods into and from the existing wagons by manual or mechanical means, and storage of the goods in godowns at terminal stations of the railways involving risks of damage/pilferage thereof.<br>
At present goods of various kinds such as food grains, coal,  cement,  mineral,  fruits,   vegetables,   textiles and consumer products are transported from one place to another over long distances in existing railway wagons as well as in heavy-duty road trucks.    But because of the main advantage of door delivery of the goods,  at present the transportation by heavy duty road trucks has been receiving preference to that by railway wagons.<br>
-   2    -<br><br>
But transportation of goods in heavy-duty trucks on road ways has a number of disadvantages also,   such as,   (a)  for preventing rapid deterioration of road ways,  heavy-duty trucks of gross weight exceeding 25 tonne i.e.  v/ith pay load exceeding 17 tonne,  are  not permitted to move on road ways,  although the full pay load capacity of such trucks is 40 tonne;     (b) the consumption of precious fuels is high;     (c)  the environment is polluted with discharge of unbumt fuels and burnt obnoxious gases;     (d)  the  speed of transportation is relatively slow and dependent on weather condition and traffic density on road ways; and (e)  the maintenance cost of trucks is high because of rapid wear and tear of their moving parts.<br>
There has already been a wide-spread network of broad-gauge railways in India, which is, for various reasons not fully utilised for freight transportation.<br>
One  object of the  invention is to extend the utilisation of freight-handling capacity of the Indian broad-guage railways by providing suitably designed and constructed heavy-duty flat-type wagons for transportation of fully loaded road trucks with pay load upto 40 tonne thereon at a relatively high speed of upto 75 km/hr and of unloaded trucks of weight 8 tonne at a speed of upto 100 km/hr.<br>
Another object is to save the cost of loading and unloading of goods in and from the existing wagons and storing of goods transported by existing  wagon in godowns at terminal stations of railways,  involving the risks of damage/pilferage of the goods.<br>
-    3    -<br><br>
Other objects are:     (i)  to save consumption of precious fuels required for transportation of goods by heavy-duty road trucks;     (ii) to prevent damage of roadways caused by the movement of heavy-duty trucks thereon,  and pollution of environment by discharge of unburnt fuels and obnoxious burnt gases from road trucks;    (iii) to reduce the maintenance cost of heavy-duty trucks; (iv) to lessen the traffic density on roadways;     (v)  to ensure all-weather rapid transportation of goods over long distances; (vi) to provide rakes of 50 wagons suitable for movements within the moving gauge profile of Indian Railways including electrical routes, bridges etc.;    (vii) to provide rakes of 50 wagons each of a payload upto 48 X 50 = 2400 tonne and suitable for transporting most of the various types of trucks/road vehicles operated in Indian roadways;     (viii) to design wagons with standard fittings and wheels suitable for movement on Indian Railways;  and (ix)  to avoid risks of accidents occurring in Indian roadways because of movement of trucks and to reduce the fatigue of drivers of the trucks.<br>
The invented wagons are  constructed in units of at least five wagons each.    Upto at least ten such units comprising upto at least fifty wagons, are coupled together to form a rake of<br>
the freight trains.    Each such freight train is capable of<br>
truck transporting upto at least fifty heavy-duty trucks, each/with full<br>
payload upto 40 tonne at a speed upto 75 km/hr and without any payload at a speed upto 100 km/hr.<br>
-    4    -<br><br>
Thus the invention provides heavy-duty flat-type broad-gauge railway wagons for high-speed transportation of fully-loaded trucks, characterised in that the wagons are constructed in units, each of upto at least five wagons, formed by joining the adjacent wagons with draw bars and connecting upto at least ten said units with couplers to form a rake of the freight train which is capable of transporting upto at least fifty heavy-duty trucks, each truck carrying its full payload of 40 tonne, at a speed upto 75 km/hour on railway; that wagons are provided one each with wells for holding a fully-loaded heavy-duty truck rolled thereon by the driver of the truck; and that a locking device comprising an assembly formed by clamp frame having the inner surface thereof in tight contact with the bottom outer surface of each wheel of truck, hinges for allowing tilting of clamp frame in the vertical plane, screw, boss and support angle for preventing rotation of the bottom outer surface of wheels; threaded screws, threaded nut, plain shaft, unthreaded nut and shaft of hinges, for preventing rotation of the top outer surface of each wheel; and pipe frame, for preventing upward movement of axle of wheels of truck , is provided for each said wagon for holding a fully-loaded heavy-duty truck in the well thereof securely during transportation of the said truck on railway.<br>
The invention is described in further detail, without restricting the scope of the invention in any manner, with reference to the drawings accompanying the provisional specification in which -<br>

Figure 12 and 13 are enlarged views of the clamping assembly;<br>
Figure 14 and 15 are enlarged views of the pipe frame.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, a unit of five wagons (W1, W2, W3, W4, W5) is<br>
formed by joining the adjacent wagons with draw bars (D1, D2, D3, D4) and<br>
	is provided with couplers (C1, C2) one at<br>
- 6 -<br><br>
each end at the standard height thereof for connecting the same with the locomotive adjacent units of five wagons each included in a freight train comprising upto  ten such units i.e.  upto fifty wagons  moving  on railway  (R).     Five  wagons  (W1,   W2,   W3,   W4,   W5) forming a unit are provided one each with five wells  (L1, L2,  L3, L4,  L5)  onto which five heavy-duty road trucks with full pay loads are rolled and kept locked in position during transportation.<br>
Referring to Fig,  2,   a loaded road truck (T)  is rolled onto well  (L)  of a wagon (W) having coupler (C) at one end and drawbar (D) at the  other end thereof and moving on railway (R). Well  (L)  is provided with a slope plate  (S) at each longitudinal end thereof to allow easy movement of the truck into and out of the well.<br>
Referring to Figs.  3 and 4,  the locking device for holding the loaded truck in the well of a wagon securely during transportation comprises clamp frame  (1)  for holding wheel (7) of the truck in position.    The clamp frame (1) is provided with hinge (6)  for tilting the same in the vertical plane when required.    The inner surface of the clamp frame (1) is held in tight contact with the bottom surface of the truck wheel (7) by means of a turn buckle assembly comprising hinge  (2),  screw (3), boss (4) and support angle (5).<br>
The  axle (9) of two pairs of truck wheels (7) is prevented from upward displacement by means of pipe frame (8).<br>
The outermost surfaces of two pairs of truck wheels (7) as shown in Fig.  4,   are prevented from rotating by additional means comprising threaded screws (10) and threaded nut (11), plain<br>
-    7    -<br><br>
shaft (13) and unthreaded nut (14),  and shaft (12)  for hinge  (2) and hinge  (6) as shown in Pig.  3.<br>
The displacement of the loaded truck rolled onto the well of a wagon in the forward and backward directions is prevented by the combined action of clamp frame (1),   turn buckle assembly (2,  3, 4,  6),  threaded screw (10),  threaded nut (11), shaft (12),  shaft (13)  and nut (14).     The lateral  displacement of the  truck is arrested by the longitudinally raised sides of well (L),  as shown in Fig.  2.     The displacement of the truck in the upward direction is prevented by the action of the pipe frame (8).    Thus the loaded truck is securely held in the well of a wagon of the  invention during the transportation thereof at a high speed upto 75 km/hr.<br>
Referring to Figs.  5 and 6,   rods (15) are angularly welded at spacings 20 mm X 150 mm on the slopy portions of each longitudinal end of well (L)  to prevent slippage  of wheels (7)  of trucks when rolled onto and off the well.<br>
Cross bars (21) of adequate mechanical strength are welded to the  centre girder  (19)  and side sills  (18).<br>
Movable end supports (16)  are provided at both<br>
longitudinal ends (CBC and Draw bar ends)  of ;each wagon, so that loaded trucks can be  rolled onto and off the rake of wagons without any jerking of the rake.<br>
Well bed plates (17) are disposed in the horizonal plane on both sides of the centre girder (19) between two bolsters (19A).     The height of the top surface of the centre girder (19)  and side sills: (18) from the rail level is made higher than that of well<br>
-   8   -<br><br>
bed plate  (17) to prevent any cross-wise movement of the loaded truck on the well surface during the movement of the wagons on rail  (R).<br>
Two rib plates (22) are provided parallelly,   one on each side of centre girder (19)for supporting the load applied thereon by wheels (7)  of trucks.<br>
For attaining increased mechanical strength,  the top surface of rib plates (22) are welded with the bottom surface of well bed plates (17).<br>
Longitudinal support members (20) are provided to share the load applied by the wheels (7)  of trucks on the well bed plates (17).<br>
The preferred sectional views of side  sills (18), centre grider (19)  and cross bars (21)  are shown in Fig.  7, that of bolster (19A) in Fig. 8,  that of end support (16)  in Fig. 9,  that of centre sill at CBC end (16A)  in Fig.   10 and that of longitudinal member (20)  in Fig.   11.<br>
The  type of material selected for use  in the construction of the  invented wagons is the steel of IS 8500 - 1991  Grade 570B Cu with having a minimum yield stress of 450 MPa,  which is much higher than the stresses expected to be applied at all the  component units of the wagon,  as determined by carrying out a Finite Element Analysis.<br>
The design of the  invented wagon has been made keeping in view the attainment of required mechanical strength with minimum tare weight to save energy required for hauling of empty as well as loaded wagons and to reduce the material cost in the fabrication of the wagons.    <br>
- 9   -<br><br>
Referring to Figs.   12,   13,  14 and 15,  in the clamping assembly provided for holding the wheels (7) of trucks on the well bed surface during movement of the wagons,  clamp frame  (1) is strengthened by bracing it with stiffener ribs (20A) to prevent any bending thereof by the  thrust applied thereon by the wheels of the loaded trucks.<br>
The location of hinge (2)  on clamp frame (1)  is selected to be about 40% of its length below the free end of the clamp frame (1).<br>
The turn buckle at the boss (4) end thereof is fitted through a hole specially made in support angle (5).     Shaft (12) for hinges (Fig.  4)  is accommodated in lug hinges (not shown) on base plate (6A).     Clamp frame (1) is hinged in between the lug hinges on the base plate (6A)  for allowing movement of the clamp frame for clamping of the wheel bottom outer surface or lying horizontally on the base plate after its release  from the wheel bottom outer surface, and allows easy movement of truck wheels thereon.<br>
Support angle (5)  is welded to base plate  (5A) which is movable on well surface,  by operating a threaded (scres)  for positioning thereof with respect to the truck wheels (7).<br>
Pipe frame (8) used for arresting upward movement of wheel axle (9) is strengthed by welding therewith rib support (18A)  (Fig.   12).<br>
A Finite element Analysis of the wagon design with respect to measurement of overall  stress at various node points of the wagon frame construction and deformation analysis of wagon (Car 'A'  and 'B')  by using 'Finite Element Package Analysis' has been worked out.<br>
-    10    -<br><br>
While carrying out the analysis,  following considerations have been taken care of -<br>
1.	Draft and Buffing Load of 200 tonne  (2 MN)  to be<br>
experienced by the wagon during acceleration and deceleration<br>
and acting through the Coupler Centre Line.<br>
2.	In addition to the Self Weight distributed throughout<br>
the wagon structure the load due to the loaded truck (48 tonne)<br>
is also considered passing through the 2 (two) front and 8 (eight) Rear Wheels (each front wheel to take 6 tonne load i.e. 2 x 6 = 12 tonne and each Rear Wheel 4.5 tonne i.e.  4.5 x 8 = 36.00 tonne.<br>
3.	To take care for the dynamic effects 40% overestimation<br>
has also been put on the load due  to the loaded truck i.e.  on the<br>
set of Wheels mentioned in SI.   No.2 above.<br>
The Analysis is carried out with the following Load Conditions  :-<br>
i)      Analysis considering Buff/Draft,   Self Weight of wagon and 40% overestimated weight of the  truck,   (wagon loaded with loaded truck).     The Loaded Road Vehicle once Pacing CBC End and once Facing DB End.<br>
ii)      Analysis considering Buff/Draft and Self Weight of the wagon (Empty Wagon).<br>
ill)      Analysis considering Self Weight of wagon and 40% over estimated weight of the truck.   (Wagon loaded with loaded truck but subjected to no Buff/Draft).<br>
'A'  Car has been modelled by using 546 elements and 475  Nodes.<br>
'B'  Car has been modelled by using 550 elements and<br>
472  Nodes.<br>
-11-<br><br>
It has been found by the  analysis that all the stresses are safe and less than the Yield Stress of the High Strength Steel Materials used for fabricating the Load Bearing Members of the invented wagons and satisfy the performance requirements of the invented wagons.<br>
The heavy-duty flat-type broad-gauge  railway wagons for high-speed transportation of fully-loaded trucks,  according to the present invention,  are expected to be  of appreciable economic benefit to the Indian Railways and also to the nation as a whole.<br>
Certain highlights of the (WOW) wagons according to the present invention are  :-<br>
1.      The truck loaded on the wagon is held securely in a manner that there is no relative movement between the truck and wagon.<br>
2.      A wagon classified as  'A'   Class Over Dimension Construction (ODC)  can be transported at a speed of 75 Kmph (Max.) i.e.  speed at which 4-Wheelers are permitted to run on roads.<br>
3.      A truck loaded on the wagon will become  'A'  Class ODC but remain within the limiting guge for 'A'   Class ODC.<br>
4.       In Station Yard,  there is a lateral clearance of 152 mm with respect to the limiting gauge for 'A'  Class ODC for<br>
electrified routes.<br>
5.      Out of Station yard, there is a lateral clearance of 180 mm<br>
and vertical clearance of 97 mm with respect to the limiting gauge for 'A'   Class ODC.<br>
-    12    -<br><br>
6.	The invented (WOW)  wagon is capable of moving at a<br>
maximum speed of 75 Kmph on all sections of Indian Railway Broad<br>
Gauge Network with fully-loaded truck clamped in position<br>
thereon in the manner as described herein before.<br>
7.	Considering the ramifications of the aforestated<br>
features of the  invented wagon,   it is expected that introduction<br>
of the invented (WOW)  wagons will  revolutionise the method of<br>
transportation of freight,  from one point to another point<br>
within the country like India, in the most cost effective way,<br>
where the consumption of 70% petrol and diesel is met through<br>
an expensive import route especially in these  days when the<br>
price of crude  oil has been climbing up.     In addition the<br>
cost of critical  spares e.g.  wheel and bearings,   gear boxes, brake oil and brake mechanism etc.   required for freight movement by trucks on roads will  be completely eliminated through transportation of fully-loaded trucks on the  invented (WOW)  wagon.<br>
