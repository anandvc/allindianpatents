The present invention relates to a method for the manufacture of an austerfitic<br>
product having elevated content of aluminium, and)the use thereof in<br>
applications where high temperature resistance in the form of oxidation resis-<br>
tance and improved mechanical properties are required.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
With increasing application temperatures for steel materials in various high-<br>
temperature applications, today's ferritic materials have, more precisely ferritic<br>
FeCrAI materials, occasionally turned out to be mechanically weak in order to<br>
resist the stresses that arise upon use at high temperatures in the form of fast<br>
changes of temperature, gas flows varying in temperature, direction and/or<br>
composition, and mechanical stresses, such as, e.g., vibrations.<br>
EP-B1-1235682 discloses the use of an austenitic nickel base or cobalt base<br>
alloy that is coated with aluminium or aluminium alloy and rolled to finished<br>
dimension. In such a way, by means of a heat treatment at temperatures above<br>
600 °C, foil of a min. thickness of approx. 50 urn can be manufactured, which<br>
has been tested to approximately 1100 °C. At 1100 °C, the mass of the sample<br>
increased by up to 7,6 % after 400 h. The disadvantage is, in comparison with<br>
conventional FeCrAI material, the relatively high oxidation rate, which is <br>
regarded to be the decisive factor for the service life of the catalyst supporting<br>
material.<br>
Austenitic alloys generally have higher mechanical strength at the same high<br>
temperatures than ferritic alloys. Austenitic materials of high aluminium content<br>
have a considerable improved oxidation resistance in comparison with austeni-<br>
tic materials of lower aluminium contents by virtue of the material having a very<br>
low ductility at typical hot-working temperatures, i.e., at 750 to 1200 °C.<br><br><br>
A metallic material for catalysts with elevated working temperatures and in<br>
increased mechanical load has to meet the following requirements: an improved<br>
mechanical strength in relation to materials used today, as is disclosed in US-B-<br>
5,578,265 and furthermore considerably better oxidation resistance than the<br>
austenitic, high-strength materials disclosed in EP-B1-1235682. In order to<br>
allow the use thereof as supporting material in a catalyst, a foil material of a<br>
thickness of 50 µm should not increase in weight more than 6 % after 400 h of<br>
oxidation in air at 1100 °C, preferably the increase in weight should be below<br>
4 %. An Al alloyed austenitic steel or nickel or cobalt base alloy of more than<br>
4,5 % of Al can be expected to have sufficiently satisfactory mechanical proper-<br>
ties and may, for a foil having a thickness of 50 urn, during certain circum-<br>
stances attain an increase in weight corresponding to 6 % after 400 h at<br>
1100 °C, but by virtue of utmost limited hot workability at Al contents above 4,5<br>
% by weight, such products are not possible to produce as thin strips by means<br>
of conventional methods. Furthermore, the oxidation resistance of such materi-<br>
als are still inferior compared to ferritic materials used today.<br>
Therefore, there is a need for a material that is more heat-resistant and oxida-<br>
tion-resistant and has a higher mechanical strength than those of today., Fur-<br>
ther, though, this material has to have satisfactory or better manufacturing<br>
properties than the materials known hitherto. This is the case for all different<br>
product forms that are used at the above-described conditions, such as strip,<br>
foil, wire, sheet-metal plate and tube.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method where, by<br>
an austenitic substrate alloy of low Al content being coated with an aluminium<br>
composition of higher Al content at a temperature between 100 °C and 600 °C,<br>
the resulting product has an Al content of 4,5-12 % by weight, preferably 5,5-<br>
12% by weight.<br><br><br>
It is an additional object of the present invention to provide an austenitic alloy<br>
material for use in high-temperature applications, manufacturable by said<br>
method.<br>

Description of the Invention<br>
These objects are attained by means of an austenitic product that is<br>
manufactured by coating an austenitic substrate alloy with the following<br>
composition (in % by weight): 20-70 % of Ni, 15-27 % of Cr, 0-5 % of Al, 0-<br>
4 % of Mo and/or W, 0-2 % of Si, 0-3 % of Mn, 0-2 % of Nb, 0-0,5 % of Y, Zr<br>
and/or Hf, 0-0,5 % of Ti, 0-0,1 % of one or more rare earth metals (REM) such<br><br><br>
as, e.g., Ce, La, Sm, 0-0,2 % of C, 0-0,1 % of N, balance Fe and normally<br>
occurring impurities, with an aluminium composition such as aluminium or an<br>
aluminium-based alloy such as is described below.<br>
A preferred composition of the substrate material is (in % by weight) 25-70 % of<br>
Ni, 18-25 % of Cr, 1-4 % of Al, 0-4 % of Mo and/or W, 0-2 % of Si, 0-3 % of<br>
Mn, 0-2 % of Nb, 0-0,5 % of Y, Zr and/or Hf, 0-0,5 % of Ti, 0-0,1 % of one or<br>
more rare earth metals (REM) such as, e.g., Ce, La, Sm, 0-0,1 % of C, 0-<br>
0,05 % of N, balance Fe and normally occurring impurities.<br>
By a two-stage process, the content of aluminium of the final product as well as<br>
its mechanical properties and oxidation resistance can be optimized independ-<br>
ently of each other.<br>
After coating the substrate material with aluminium or an aluminium-based<br>
alloy, the final alloy has a composition consisting of (in % by weight) 25-70 % of<br>
Ni, 15-25 % of Cr, 4,5-12 % of Al, 0-4 % of Mo and/or W, 0-4 % of Si, 0-3 %<br>
of Mn, 0-2 % of Nb, 0-0,5 % of Ti, 0-0,5 % of Y, Sc, Zr and/or Hf, 0-0,2 % of<br>
one or more rare earth metals (REM) such as, e.g., Ce, La, Sm, 0-0,2 % of C,<br>
0-0,1 % of N, balance Fe and normally occurring impurities.<br>
The austenitic substrate material has in itself a good high-temperature strength,<br>
which is increased by the presence of precipitations of Ni (Nb, Al) and, if<br>
required, also by Mo and/or W in solid solution. Additionally increased mechani-<br>
cal stability and resistance to grain growth may be given by the presence of<br>
precipitations of carbides and/or nitrides of any one or some of the elements Ti,<br>
Nb, Zr, Hf.<br>
Carbon in solid solution or as carbides contributes to an increased mechanical<br>
strength at high temperatures. Simultaneously, higher contents of carbon in the<br>
substrate material imply deteriorated properties upon cold working. Therefore,<br><br><br>
the maximal content of carbon in the substrate should be limited to 0,2 % by<br>
weight.<br>
Nitrogen in solid solution or as nitrides contributes to an increased mechanical<br>
strength at high temperatures. Simultaneously, higher contents of nitrogen in<br>
the substrate material imply that embrittling aluminium nitride may be formed in<br>
the production of the substrate or after coating with aluminium or an aluminium-<br>
based alloy. Therefore, the maximal content of nitrogen in the substrate should<br>
be limited to 0,1 % by weight.<br>
The austenitic alloy manufactured according to the invention is used in a coated<br>
and not heat-treated state or after a diffusion annealing. The most favourable<br>
compositions for the substrate alloy are obtained if it contains 1-4 % by weight<br>
of Al. This content of aluminium gives the finished alloy an improved oxidation<br>
resistance and an improved production economy without entailing an increased<br>
risk of production disturbances in comparison with the manufacture of a material<br>
of low content of aluminium. After coating with aluminium or an aluminium-<br>
based alloy, the material should in total contain more than 4,5 % by weight of<br>
Al.<br>
According to the invention, the coating with aluminium or an aluminium-based<br>
alloy should take place within a temperature range of the substrate that is lower<br>
than the melting point of the aluminium, i.e., at a temperature between 100 °C<br>
and 600 °C, preferably 150 °C-450 °C.<br>
Addition of Zr and/or Hf and REM and/or Y and/or Sc gives an increased resis-<br>
tance to peeling and flaking of the formed oxide. The finished product's contents<br>
of said elements may be supplied by addition in the substrate alloy and/or in the<br>
aluminium-based alloy that are used in the coating.<br>
Certain compositions of the alloy according to the invention could be manufac-<br>
tured by conventional metallurgy. However, unlike this, in production by means<br><br><br>
of the process according to the present invention, a material can be obtained,<br>
the microstructure of which is controlled and the oxidation properties and<br>
mechanical properties of which are optimal. It is an additional advantage of the<br>
process according to the present invention that the total content of aluminium of<br>
the final product is not limited by the embrittling effect that contents of alumin-<br>
ium above approx. 4,5 % by weight may give upon later cold and/or hot work-<br>
ing. Furthermore, the method to coat a substrate material with aluminium or an<br>
aluminium-based alloy according to the invention gives a final product, the<br>
contents of which of, e.g., Mo, C, Nb can be considerably higher than in a con-<br>
ventionally manufactured material without the presence of said elements<br>
resulting in any noticeable deterioration of the oxidation properties.<br>
The proper coating of the substrate alloy with aluminium or an aluminium-based<br>
alloy may be effected by processes such as, e.g., dipping in melt, electrolytic<br>
coating, rolling together strips of aluminium or an aluminium alloy from a gas<br>
phase by so-called CVD or PVD technique. The coating with aluminium or alu-<br>
minium-based alloy can be carried out after the substrate alloy has been rolled<br>
or in another way been machined to desired product dimension. During this<br>
process, a diffusion annealing may be carried out in order to provide a homo-<br>
genization of the material and then plastic machining in one or more steps may<br>
be carried out in order to provide the final product. Plastic machining, such as,<br>
e.g., rolling or drawing may also be effected directly on a coated product of<br>
larger dimensions than the desired final dimension. In this case, the pfastic<br>
machining may be followed by annealing.<br>
The content of aluminium in the final product can be varied by means of differ-<br>
ent factors: the thickness of the substrate material in relation to the thickness of<br>
the coating, the content of aluminium in the substrate material as well as the<br>
content of aluminium of the coating.<br>
However, as has been described above, the total content of aluminium in the<br>
finished product always has to be at least 4,5 % by weight in order to secure<br><br><br>
sufficient properties. The product may be used in the form of an annealed,<br>
homogeneous material or a laminate or a material having a concentration gra-<br>
dient of Al with the Al content being higher at the surface than in the centre of<br>
the material.<br>
Depending on the coating process used, various compositions of the applied Al<br>
alloy are more suitable than others. The aluminium alloy contains 0-25 % of Si<br>
and/or 0-2 % by weight of one or more of the elements Ce, La, Sc, Y, Zr, Hf<br>
and/or 0-5 % by weight of one or more of the elements Mg, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni,<br>
Co and/or 0-1 % by weight of one or more of the elements B, Ge, preferably the<br>
aluminium alloy should contain at least 90 % of Al, 0-10 % of Si and/or 0-2 %<br>
by weight of one or more of the elements Ce, La, Sc, Y, Zr, Hf, more preferably<br>
the aluminium alloy should contain at least 95 % of Al, 0-5 % of Si and/or 0-2<br>
% by weight of one or more of the elements Ce, La, Sc, Y, Zr, Hf.<br>
Embodiment examples<br>
In the following, it is shown how the requirements on strength and oxidation<br>
resistance are met by an austenitic Al alloyed material manufactured according<br>
to the method described in the present invention. Furthermore, it is shown that a<br>
material manufactured according to the same method is superior to a rfiaterial<br>
that has the same composition but has been manufactured according to con-<br>
ventional methods, in respect of high-temperature strength, oxidation resistance<br>
and workability.<br>
Example 1<br>
Table 1 indicates examples of compositions of examined alloys. The alloys<br>
according to examples A and B as well as the Comparative examples 1, 2 and 3<br>
were manufactured in the conventional way by pyrometallurgy and hot working.<br><br><br><br>
Comparison example 1 is an alloy that today is used as supporting material in<br>
catalytic converters and that has acceptable oxidation resistance for this use.<br>
Comparison example 2 is an austenitic alloy of high Al content, manufactured<br>
by conventional methods. The yield upon hot working of said alloy was only<br>
approximately 10 %, i.e., 90 % of the material had such internal defects in the<br>
form of, e.g., cracks that it could not be used for further working.<br>
The alloys according to examples A and B have compositions that are suitable<br>
to be used as substrate materials in a coating process where a thin layer of<br>
aluminium or an aluminium-based alloy is deposited on said substrate. From the<br>
alloys according to Examples A and B as well as comparison example 1, 50 urn<br>
thick strips were manufactured via hot rolling and cold rolling. The yield in the<br>
production of the alloys in examples A and B was the same as comparison<br>
example 1.<br><br>
In order to avoid formation of aluminium nitride, the content of nitrogen in the<br>
substrate materials is low. In order to limit this tendency further, Ti, Nb and/or Zr<br>
and/or Hf were added. Addition of these elements results in the formation of<br>
nitrides that are more stable than AIN, which entails a reduced formation of the<br>
latter. Furthermore, the compositions are chosen in order to enable efficient<br>
production of thin strips of the substrate material. For instance, the content of<br>
carbon is below 0,10 %, which allows satisfactory metarial yields in cold working<br>
processes. By the relatively high Al content in the substrates, the necessary<br>
amount of Al that has to be deposited on the substrate is decreased with the<br>
purpose of achieving sufficient Al content in the finished product.<br>
In table 2, it is shown that the substrate alloys have a very good high-tempera-<br>
ture strength; e.g., at 700 °C the ultimate strength of the alloys according to<br>
examples A and B is up to 3 times larger than of the conventional material in<br>
comparison example 1, and at this temperature the yield point in tension is 2,8<br>
to 5 times larger than of comparison example 1. At 900 °C, the yield point in<br>
tension of the alloy according to examples A and B is approximately 5 times<br>
larger of for comparison example 1, while the ultimate strength is at least 3,5<br>
times higher than of comparison example 1.<br><br><br>
Thus, the two substrate alloys used in Examples A and B meet the require-<br>
ments of sufficient mechanical strength and manufacturability as thin foil.<br>
Figure 1 shows results of hot ductility testing, so-called Gleeble testing, where<br>
the reduction of area to fracture is measured as a function of the test tempera-<br>
ture, for the alloys according to Examples A and B and for comparison example<br>
2. In order to be able to hot-work an alloy in practice, the reduction of area to<br>
fracture should exceed 40 %. In order to obtain a reproducibly high yield in hot<br>
working operations, the average reduction of area to fracture should be at least<br>
70 % at a temperature difference of 100 °C.<br>
From figure 1, it is clearly seen that the alloys according to Examples A and B<br>
can be manufactured via hot rolling and/or forging, while the alloy according to<br>
comparison example 2 cannot be manufactured with sufficient yield by means<br>
of conventional methods. One consequence of this is that, in order to be able to<br>
obtain the good oxidation resistance that an alloy according to Comparison<br>
example 2 can be expected to have, the necessary Al content has to be added<br>
after the alloy has been produced in the form of a thin strip. The alloys accord-<br>
ing to Examples A and B are both sufficiently ductile at room temperature and at<br>
elevated temperatures in order to be able to be cold-rolled to very thin strips<br>
with satisfactory productivity, which is seen in that they could be manufactured<br>
without problems down to material thicknesses of 50 urn, and are thereby good<br>
candidate materials to be used as substrate materials for a coating with alu-<br>
minium or an aluminium-based alloy Al.<br>
Example 2<br>
The alloys in examples C and D were manufactured by coating the two surfaces<br>
of cold-rolled, 50 urn thick, strips of the alloy according to examples A and B,<br>
respectively, by vaporization or sputtering with Al in such an amount that the<br>
total Al content corresponded to 5,5-6 % (see table 3). The coating was<br>
effected by a certain heating of the substrate material, however not to such a<br><br><br>
high temperature that melted Al was present on the substrate. The coating with<br>
Al or Al alloy according to the invention should accordingly be effected within a<br>
temperature range of the substrate of 100 °C-660 °C, preferably in the tem-<br>
perature range of 150-450 °C.<br><br>
The alloy according to comparison example 2, which has approximately the<br>
same total composition as the alloy in example C, could, as has been men-<br>
tioned previously, be forged, but only with a very low material yield. Thus, the<br>
limited hot ductility entails that this alloy hardly can be manufactured in the form<br>
of thin strips. However, the same alloy has, as is seen in table 2, a very good<br>
heat resistance; e.g., the ultimate strength at both 700 °C and 900 °C is 3 to 4<br>
times larger than of the conventional material in comparison example 1, and the<br>
yield point in tension is more than 4 times as large at both test temperatures.<br>
Example 3<br>
The thickness of the Al layer obtained on 50 µm thick strip according to example<br>
C was measured by GDOES (Glow Discharge Optical Emission Spectroscopy),<br>
a method that enables accurate measuring of compositions and thicknesses of<br>
thin surface layers. The analysis showed that the sample had a total Al content<br>
of 5-6 % by weight. These samples were oxidized in air at 1000 °C for up to<br>
620 h. The results are shown in Figure 2. The alloy according to Example C has<br>
an oxidation resistance that is comparable with the conventionally manufactured<br>
Fe-Cr-AI alloy of the same thickness (comparison example 1) and has a signifi-<br>
cantly better oxidation resistance than the alloy according to example D. After<br><br>
400 h, the alloy according to example C has increased 2,3 % in weight, while<br>
the alloy according to example D increased 5 % in weight. After the same time,<br>
comparison example 1 has increased approx. 2,2 % in weight.<br>
The alloy according to Example C was oxidation tested at 1100 oC together with<br>
comparison example 1, which is shown in Figure 3. The two materials were<br>
tested in the form of foil of a thickness of 50 µm. After up to 300 h of test time,<br>
the two materials are equally good. After 400 h of testing, both the alloy<br>
according to Example C and comparison example 1 have increased less than<br>
6 % in weight: the alloy according to example C by 5,9 % and comparison<br>
example 1 by 4,3 %. Thus, the alloy according to Example C meets the<br>
requirement of sufficient oxidation resistance for use in catalytic converters,<br>
maximum 6 % increase in weight in 50 µm thickness upon oxidation in 400 h at<br>
1100°C.<br>
Example 4<br>
Examples E and F are the alloys according to examples C and D, respectively,<br>
that have been annealed at 1200 °C for 20 min with the purpose of providing an<br>
equalising of the Al content in the material (see table 4). The ductility of the<br>
material was assessed by means of a bending test where the smallest bending<br>
radius that the material could be bent to without fracturing was determined (see<br>
table 4). The narrowest radius that the material was tested at was 0,38 mm.<br>
None of the materials exhibited any damage after this bending. The radius is<br>
smaller than the one used in the production of catalytic converters. Thereby,<br>
strips manufactured according to the invention have a fully sufficient ductility to<br>
allow the use thereof in catalytic converters. At 900 °C, example E has an ulti-<br>
mate strength of 166 MPa (see table 2), which is more than four times larger<br>
than the material according to comparison example 1 used at present, and fur-<br>
thermore somewhat higher than a conventionally manufactured material<br>
according to comparison example 2, having a similar composition as alloys that<br>
have been manufactured in accordance with the invention.<br><br><br><br>
Example 5<br>
The alloys according to Examples E and F were oxidation tested at 1100 °C<br>
together with the alloy of Example C according to the invention as well as com-<br>
parison examples 1 and 2. The results are shown in Figure 4. Comparison<br>
example 2 was tested in the form of an approx. 3 mm thick plate while Exam-<br>
ples C, E and F were tested in the form of 50 µm thin foil. The alloy in compari-<br>
son example 1 was tested in two different states: in the form of an approx. 3<br>
mm thick plate extracted from a hot-rolled strip, as well as in the form of a foil of<br>
a thickness of 50 urn. The results are summarized in table 5.<br>
It is evident from Figure 4 and table 5 that the oxidation rate of the thin foil of<br>
comparison example 1 is smaller than that of the thick plate. This effect may be<br>
explained by the fact that the thin foil easily can be deformed and thereby<br>
absorb the difference in thermal expansion between the protective oxide and<br>
the metal. Thereby, it is avoided that the oxide fractures upon cooling and<br>
heating, an effect that otherwise means that unprotected metal being exposed<br>
to oxidation. The relatively thick plate cannot be deformed in the same way, and<br>
that sample will thereby be more sensitive to heating and cooling.<br><br><br>
The alloys according to Examples C and E have almost the same composition<br>
as the alloy in comparison example 2, and also here, a similar effect of different<br>
sample thickness would be expected, as for comparison example 1. However,<br>
the relative improvement in oxidation resistance with decreasing sample thick-<br>
ness of the alloy according to the invention is considerably larger than it is of<br>
comparison example 1 (see table 5). This may be regarded to be a highly unex-<br>
pected and valuable effect of the method according to the invention. <br>
Furthermore, the diffusion annealing that differs between Examples C and E<br>
has turned out to give an unexpectedly large additional improvement of the oxi-<br>
dation resistance (see table 5).<br>
To start with, the alloy according to Example F has equally good oxidation<br>
resistance as Example C or comparison example 1 in the form of foil. Testing<br>
was interrupted after 220 h for the alloy according to Example F. However,<br>
comparison between the increase in weight up to 220 h at 1100 °C of examples<br><br>
E and F shows that the alloy according to Example E has the most suitable<br>
combination of composition and way of production as regards oxidation resis-<br>
tance.<br>
Example 6<br>
A 50 µm thick strip of the alloy according to example A was coated with Al by<br>
means of vaporization. Various samples were annealed for different times at<br>
1050 °C in Ar gas. Concentration profiles of Al in the material were determined<br>
by GDOES. The results are shown in figure 5. It is clear that an Al enriched<br>
area is left near the surface of the strip also after 8 h of heat treatment. This<br>
area seems only to be consumed slowly by Al diffusion inwardly in the strip.<br>
Example 7<br>
A 50 urn thick strip of the alloy according to example A was coated with Al by<br>
means of vaporization. A sample was annealed for 50 min at 1150 °C in Ar gas.<br>
The micro structure was analysed by means of SEM (scanning electron micro-<br>
scopy). Figure 6 shows the area closest to the sample surface. Farthest out, a<br>
Fe-Cr rich layer (cf. "0" in figure 6) is formed, inside this, a Ni and Al enriched<br>
area (cf. "1" in figure 6). Layer "2" corresponds to a diffusion zone of slowly<br>
decreasing Al content with increasing distance from the surface. In layer "3" in<br>
figure 6, the composition is the same as in the substrate material.<br>
Examples of application<br>
Supporting material for catalytic conversion<br>
Catalytic conversion is since a number of years a requirement in most industri-<br>
alised countries. The catalytically active material is carried mechanically by a<br>
supporting material. The requirements on the supporting material are, among<br>
other things, that it should have a large surface, withstand temperature varia-<br><br><br>
tions and have sufficient mechanical strength and oxidation resistance at the<br>
operating temperature of the catalytic converter.<br>
Two main types of supporting materials are used today: ceramic and metallic.<br>
The ceramic supporting materials, which frequently are manufactured from<br>
cordierit, are not affected by oxidation, however their brittleness means that the<br>
resistance to impacts and other mechanical stresses as well as to temperature<br>
variations such as fast changes of temperature is very limited. Today, metallic<br>
supporting materials generally are based on thin strips of ferritic Fe-Cr-AI alloys<br>
with additions of small amounts of reactive elements such as rare earth metals<br>
(REM) or Zr or Hf. In order to give the monolith a maximum active surface, the<br>
supporting material should be as thin as possible, usually between 10 µm and<br>
200 pm. Today, a common strip thickness is 50 µm, but considerably enhanced<br>
efficiency of the catalytic converter by virtue of an increased surface/volume-<br>
ratio and/or decreased fall of pressure over the catalytic converter can be<br>
expected upon a reduction of the strip thickness to 30 µm or 20 µm. The high<br>
ductility of the metal gives a good resistance to mechanical and thermal fatigue.<br>
Aluminium in contents above approx. 4,5 % by weight gives, together with the<br>
reactive elements, the material the possibility of forming a thin, protective, alu-<br>
minium oxide upon heating. Furthermore, the reactive elements make the oxide<br>
getting a considerably reduced tendency to peel, i.e., come loose from the<br>
metal upon cooling or mechanical deformation. However, conventional Fe-Cr-AI<br>
alloys have a large disadvantage: they are mechanically very weak at high tem-<br>
peratures, and therefore tend to be greatly deformed also upon small stresses<br>
by virtue of, e.g., acceleration, changes of pressure, mechanical impacts or<br>
changes of temperature.<br>
The invention is not limited to products in small dimensions, such as thin strips<br>
or thin wire. Since an austenrtic material having a content of aluminium that is<br>
larger than 4,5 % by weight cannot be produced with sufficient productivity and<br>
material yield by hot working, it is valuable to be able to manufacture such an<br>
alloy in thicker dimensions by the coating method described in the present<br><br><br>
invention. This may be effected, e.g., by manufacturing a product in the form of,<br>
e.g., sheet-metal plate, strip, foil or a seamless tube, in a substrate alloy, and<br>
then said product is coated, on one or both surfaces with an aluminium alloy in<br>
such an amount that the total content of aluminium of the material exceeds 4,5<br>
% by weight. For instance, a seamless tube having the composition according<br>
to example A may be manufactured by means of conventional methods to the<br>
following dimensions: outer diameter 60,33 mm, wall thickness 3,91 mm. In<br>
order to be able to achieve a total content of aluminium of at least 4,5 % by<br>
weight in such a tube, it needs to be coated with aluminium on the inner and<br>
outer surface with a thickness of at least 0,1 mm. Such an amount may be<br>
applied to the surfaces of the tube by conventional methods, e.g., by dipping in<br>
a melt of an aluminium alloy. If a homogeneous material is desired, a longer<br>
heat treatment at high temperature is required, suitably at least 1000 °C.<br>
Therefore, the finished product should suitably be manufactured in a partly<br>
homogenized form, where the material has an aluminium gradient that<br>
increases towards the surfaces, e.g., by a heat treatment where the material<br>
slowly is heated to 1100 °C and is heat-treated at this temperature for between<br>
5 min and 10 h, depending on the desired aluminium distribution. It is evident to<br>
a person skilled in the art that, if this product should be possible to be manu-<br>
factured with satisfactory productivity, the content of aluminium in the substrate<br>
material should be as high as possible, without causing production disturbances<br>
in the manufacture of the substrate. In this case, a suitable content of aluminium<br>
in the substrate material is 2-4 % by weight. This method can be used to<br>
manufacture a finished product or to manufacture a starting material for contin-<br>
ued plastic machining at low temperature, e.g., a tubular blank for pilgrim step<br>
rolling.<br>
Resistive heating<br>
In industrial furnaces and in consumer goods including resistive heating, such<br>
as hotplates, radiant heaters, flat irons, ovens, toasters, hairdryers, tumble-dry-<br>
ers, drying cupboards, electric kettles, car seat heaters, underfloor heating<br><br><br>
equipment, radiators and other similar products, there is also a need for using<br>
strip, wire or foil having the above-described properties. Availability of a material<br>
having this product specification results in the development of more efficient<br>
heat sources having longer service life and/or higher operation temperature and<br>
efficiency.<br>
Further applications<br>
The alloy produced according to the invention may also be used in other high<br>
temperature applications, such as applications requiring a high oxidation<br>
resistance and good mechanical properties. For example, it could be used in<br>
heat exchangers or as protective plates. Also, it could be used in other<br>
environments such as in reducing atmosphere. In this latter case it could be<br>
advantageous in some cases to pre-oxidise the product before use in order to<br>
assure a stable and dense Al-containing oxide on the surface.<br><br><br>
