				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for treating a laundry item.  The present invention also relates to a cleaning product for laundry,<br>
Laundry cleaning products are extremely well known. Usually a composition in the form of a liquid or powder is added to a laundry washing machine, either directly to the drum or via a dispenser, and washing is carried out using an appropriate selection from a number of pre-programmed cycles.  Accurate dosing may be a problem, particularly when consumers do not read or follow the dosing instructions.  Recently products in the form of laundry compositions packaged in a film of water-soluble polymer have become available.  However, alternative methods of presentation of unit-dosed products are desired. Furthermore, there may be a preconception in the minds of some consumers that the polymer may not dissolve fully or that the polymer might dissolve before the product is added to the wash.  Additionally the product is perceived as being fragile, and it lacks versatility in use.<br>
Compositions for pretreating a laundry item, for example to remove a stain or to assist in stain removal, are also known.  Such compositions are, for example, in the form of a liquid composition which may be applied directly to the laundry item, for example, by spraying.  Typically, however, such compositions need to be rinsed off with water after use, for example, by hand or in a laundry washing machine.<br><br>
We have now found that certain active agents in the form of a solid (preferably in the form of a powder) that can be used to remove soils from laundry, which do not need to be rinsed off with water after use, but can be easily brushed off by the user.<br>
Accordingly, a first aspect of the present invention provides a method for treating a laundry item, which comprises<br>
contacting the laundry item with a cleaning composition in the form of a solid comprising an insoluble active agent that is capable of binding soil, such that soil on the laundry item is bound to the insoluble active agent, and<br>
removing the composition from the laundry item, optionally in the absence of water.<br>
Preferably, the laundry item is contacted with the cleaning composition when it is freshly soiled.  Thus, the cleaning composition may be applied to the laundry item within 30 minutes of the soil occurring, preferably within 10 minutes, for example within 1 minute.  If desired, the laundry item may be wetted or moistened to assist the cleaning composition to contact the stain.<br>
The composition may then be left on the soiled area for sufficient time to allow the insoluble active agent to bind or "catch" the soil/stain particles (by the use of the term soil hereinafter we also includes stains).  This may take less than 1 hour, for example less than 30 minutes, preferably less than 10 minutes.<br><br>
The composition is then removed from the laundry item. Optionally, the composition is removed in the absence of water, for example, by brushing the composition off the laundry item.  In one embodiment, however, the composition is removed using water, for example, by rinsing the laundry item by hand or in a washing machine.  The process of the present invention, therefore, may be carried out before the laundry item is washed by hand or in a laundry washing machine.<br>
The cleaning composition may contain at least one additional active agent, such as a surfactant and/or bleach.  The surfactant or bleach may dissolve at least in part upon contact with the soil.  The surfactant or bleach may be oil soluble and/or water soluble.  Suitable surfactants and bleaches are described in detail below.<br>
Although the cleaning composition may contain a surfactant, the amount of surfactant in the cleaning ccoiposition is preferably less than 30 %wt, more preferably less than 20 %wt, even more preferably less than 10 %wt, for example, less than 5 %wt.  In one embodiment, the composition comprises less than 3 %wt surfactant.  In another embodiment, the composition is substantially free of surfactant.<br>
Any suitable soil catcher may be employed. Unlike detergents or surfactants, which simply aid in the removal of soils from surfaces, the soil catcher actively binds to the soil allowing it to be removed from the surface of the laundry. Once bound, the soil is less likely to be able to redeposit onto the surface of the laundry. Preferred soil catchers have a high affinity to both oily and water-<br><br>
soluble soil.  Preferably, the soil catcher is a mixture of two or more soil catchers, each soil catcher may have a different affinity for different soils.  Preferred soil catchers for oily soils have a non polar structure with high absorption capability. Preferred water based soil catchers are generally charged and have a high surface area in order to attract the soil by electrostatic charge and collect it.<br>
Suitable soil catchers include polymers, such as acrylic polymers, polyesters and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP).  The polymers may be crosslinked, examples of which include crosslinked acrylic polymers and crosslinked PVP. Super absorbing polymers are mainly acrylic polymers and they are useful for the scope of this patent.<br>
Other important polymers are ethylidene norbene polymers, ethylidene norbene/ethylene copolymers, ethylidene norbene/propylene/ethylidene ter-polymers. Inorganic materials may also be employed.  Examples include silica, silicates (e.g. magnesium silicate), zeolites, talc, bentonites and active carbon.  The latter may be used to absorb and/or degrade coloured parts of stain and/or absorb odours.  Alginates, carrageneans and chitosan may also be used.  Preferred water insoluble agents are selected from, at least one of acrylic polymer, polyester, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), silica, silicate, zeolite, talc, bentonites, active carbon, alginates, carrageneans, ethylidene morbene/propylene/ethylidene ter-polymers and chitosan in the manufacture of a cleaning composition as an active agent for binding soil.  Preferably the cleaning composition is a laundry cleaning composition or stain-removing composition.<br><br>
Preferably, the water-insoluble soil catcher compound would comprise a solid cross-linked polyvinyl N-oxide, or chitosan product or ethylidene norbene/propylene/ethylidene ter-polymers or blend of the same, as discussed more fully hereafter. Products made in accordance with the present invention which are suitable for use individually can be provided in a variety forms, but will at least contain a compartment for storing a water-insoluble soil catcher compound and have a plurality of apertures, as previously described.<br>
The laundry devices of the present invention can be used with a variety of water-insoluble soil catcher compounds. These water-insoluble soil catcher compounds can be provided as a solid, gel, and the like.<br>
These soil catcher compounds can deliver the soil catcher benefit by a variety of techniques, including, but not limited to trapping the soil in such a manner that it is unavailable for re-deposition onto a fabric, precipitating out the soil or adsorbing, absorbing or otherwise becoming associated with any extraneous soil in the wash water.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "substantially water insoluble" is intended to mean that the soil catcher compound has a solubility in deionised water at 20°C of less than about 1 gm/litre. A substantially water insoluble soil catcher compound may comprise a water-soluble soil catcher agent which is bound to a water insoluble carrier, or it may comprise a soil catcher agent which in itself is water insoluble. Water insoluble carriers for water-soluble polymeric agents include inorganic materials such as zeolites, clays such as kaolinites, smectites, hectorite<br><br>
types, silicas (or other detergent ingredients) . Additionally, organic water-insoluble materials such as fatty alcohols, esters of fatty acids, or polysaccharides that can form water-insoluble gels upon hydration (e.g. gellan gum, carrageenan gum, agarose etc.) can be used as carriers herein. For the soil catcher agents which are themselves water soluble, water insolubility can be achieved by cross-linking, either starting from the known water-soluble soil catcher polymeric agents, or starting from monomers of these polymers. Other compounds that are suitable as water insoluble soil catcher agents are any compound exhibiting ion exchange properties, preferably anion exchangers. For instance, non-limiting examples of such products are Dowex(R) exchange resins of the Dow Chemical Co. or equivalent from other suppliers; Sephadex(R), Sepharose(R) or Sephacel(R) exchange resins all from Pharmacia Biotech; any other polysaccharide having ion exchange properties such as modified cellulosics, starches; other derivatives of the wood industry such as wood pulp or lignin.<br>
Water soluble polymeric soil catcher agents that are suitable to be bound to insoluble carriers, or to be made insoluble via cross-linking are those polymers known in the art to inhibit the transfer of dyes from coloured fabrics onto fabrics washed therewith. These polymers have the ability to complex or adsorb the fugitive dyes washed out of dyed fabrics before the dyes have the opportunity to become attached to other articles in the wash. Especially suitable polymeric soil catcher agents are polyamine N-oxide polymers, polymers and copolymers of N-vinylpyrrolidone and N-vinylimidazole, vinyloxazolidones,<br><br>
vinylpyridine, vinylpyridine N-oxide, other vinylpyridine derivatives or mixtures thereof.<br>
a) Polyamine N-Oxide Polymers<br>
The polyamine N-oxide polymers suitable for use contain<br>
units having the following structure formula:<br>
P-Ax-R-N-O<br>
wherein P is a polymerisable unit, whereto the R-N-O group can be attached to, when x is 0, or wherein the R-N-0 group forms part of the polymerisable unit or a combination of both;<br>
A is -C(O)0-, -OC(O)-, -C(0)-,-0-,-S",-N
R is aliphatic, ethoxylated aliphatics, aromatic, heterocyclic or alicyclic groups or any combination thereof whereto the nitrogen of the N-0 group can be attached or wherein the nitrogen of the N-0 group is part of these<br>
I  groups.<br>
The N-O group can be represented by the following general structures:<br><br>
wherein Rl, R2, and R3 are aliphatic groups, aromatic, heterocyclic or alicyclic groups or combinations thereof, x or/and y or/and z is 0 or 1 and wherein the nitrogen of the N"0 group can be attached or wherein the nitrogen of the N-O group forms part of these groups.<br><br>
The N-O group can be part of the polymerisable unit P or can be attached to the polymeric backbone or a combination of both.<br>
Suitable polyamine N-oxides wherein the N-O group forms part of the polymerisable unit comprise polyamine N-oxides wherein R is selected from aliphatic, aromatic, alicyclic or heterocyclic groups. One class of said polyamine N-oxides comprises the group of polyamine N-oxides wherein the nitrogen of the N-0 group forms part of the R-group. Preferred polyamine N-oxides are those wherein R is a heterocyclic group such as pyridine, pyrrole, imidazole, pyrrolidine, piperidine, quinoline, acridine and derivatives thereof. Another class of said polyamine N-oxides comprises the group of polyamine N-oxides wherein the nitrogen of the N-0 group is attached to the R-group. Other suitable polyamine N-oxides are the polyamine oxides wherein the N-0 group is attached to the polymerisable unit. Preferred classes of these polyamine N-oxides are the polyamine N-oxides having the general formula above wherein R is an aromatic, heterocyclic or alicyclic groups wherein the nitrogen of the N-O functional group is part of said R group. Examples of these classes are polyamine oxides wherein R is a heterocyclic compound such as pyridine, pyrrole, imidazole and derivatives thereof. Another preferred class of polyamine N-oxides is the polyamine oxides having the general formula above wherein R are aromatic, heterocyclic or alicyclic groups wherein the nitrogen of the N-0 functional group is attached to said R groups. Examples of these classes are polyamine oxides wherein R groups can be aromatic such as phenyl.<br><br>
Any polymer backbone can be used as long as the amine oxide polymer formed has soil catcher properties. Examples of suitable polymeric backbones are polyvinyls, polyalkylenes, polyesters, polyethers, polyamide, polyimides, polyacrylates and mixtures thereof. The amine N-oxide polymers of the present invention typically have a ratio of amine to the amine N-oxide of about 10:1 to about 1:1000000. However the amount of amine oxide groups present in the polyamine oxide polymer can be varied by appropriate copolymerisation or by appropriate degree of N-oxidation. Preferably, the ratio of amine to amine N-oxide is from about 2:3 to about 1:1000000. More preferably from about 1:4 to about 1:1000000, and most preferably from about 1:7 to about 1:1000000. The polymers of the present invention may encompass random or block copolymers where one monomer type is an amine N-oxide and the other monomer type is either an amine N-oxide or not. The amine oxide unit of the polyamine N-oxides has a pKa 
b)  Copolymers of N-vinvlpyrrolidone and N-vinylimidazole The N-vinylimidazole N-vinylpyrrolidone polymers used in the present invention have an average molecular weight range from about 5,000 to about 1,000,000, preferably from about 5,000 to about 200,000. Highly preferred polymers for<br><br>
use in the laundry detergent compositions according to the present invention comprise a polymer selected from N-vinylimidazole N-vinylpyrrolidone copolymers wherein said polymer has an average molecular weight range from about 5,000 to about 50,000; more preferably from about 8,000 to about 30,000; and most preferably from about 10,000 to about 20,000. The average molecular weight range was determined by light scattering as described in Barth H. G. and Mays J. W. Chemical Analysis Vol 113, "Modern Methods of Polymer Characterisation". Highly preferred N-vinylimidazole N-vinylpyrrolidone copolymers have an average molecular weight range from about 5,000 to about 50,000; more preferably from about 8,000 to about 30,000; most preferably from about 10,000 to about 20,000. The N-vinylimidazole N-vinylpyrrolidone copolymers characterised by having said average molecular weight range provide excellent soil catcher  properties. The N-vinylimidazole N-vinylpyrrolidone copolymer of the present invention has a molar ratio of N-vinylimidazole to N-vinylpyrrolidone from about 1 to about 0.2, more preferably from about 0.8 to about 0.3, and most preferably from about 0.6 to about 0.4<br>
c) Polyvinylpyrrolidone<br>
Polyvinylpyrrolidone ("PVP") having an average molecular weight from about 2,500 to about 400,000 can also be utilised; preferably of average molecular weight from about 5,000 to about 200,000; more preferably from about 5,000 to about 50,000; and most preferably from about 5,000 to about 15,000. Suitable polyvinylpyrrolidones are commercially available from ISP Corporation, New York, N.Y. and Montreal, Canada under the product names PVP K-15 (viscosity molecular weight of 10,000), PVP K-30 (average molecular weight of 40,000), PVP K-60 (average molecular<br><br>
weight of 160,000), and PVP K-90 (average molecular weight of 360,000) . Other suitable polyvinylpyrroliclones which are commercially available from BASF include Sokalan HP 165 and Sokalan HP 12; polyvinylpyrrolidones known to persons skilled in the detergent field (see for example EP-A-262,897 and EP-A-256,696).<br>
d)	Polyvinyloxazolidone<br>
One may also utilise polyvinyloxazolidone as a polymeric soil catcher agent. Said polyvinyloxazolidones have an average molecular weight from about 2,500 to about 400,000; preferably from about 5,000 to about 200,000; more preferably from about 5,000 to about 50,000; and most preferably from about 5,000 to about 15,000.<br>
e)	Polyvinylimidazole<br>
One may also utilise polyvinylimidazole as polymeric soil catcher agent. Said polyvinylimidazoles have an average molecular weight from about 2,500'to about 400,000; preferably from about 5,000 to about 200,000; more preferably from about 5,000 to about 50,000; and most preferably from about 5,000 to about 15,000.<br>
f)	Cationic Polymers<br>
Such polymers are those having a cationic group into their polymeric backbone, as shown by the formula:<br>
[P-Catx]n -Zt-Caty<br>
Wherein P represents polymerisable units, Z represents an alkyl, aryl carbonyl ester, ether, amide or amine group,<br>
Cat represents cationic groups, preferably including quaternised N groups or other cationic units, x~0 or 1, y=0<br><br>
or 1, t=0 or 1. Preferred cationic polymers are quaternised polyvinylpyridines.<br>
Water insolubility can, in the case of non-cross linked polymers, also be achieved by selecting very high molecular weight range, or by copolymerising, or by varying the degree of oxidation if appropriate, depending on the polymer. Polymers which are water soluble, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,912,221, may be made insoluble if the molecular weight is increased above 400,000.<br>
g) Cross-Linked Polymers<br>
Cross-linked polymers are polymers whose backbones are interconnected to a certain degree; these links can be of chemical or physical nature, possibly with active groups on the backbone or on branches; cross-linked polymers have been described in the Journal of Polymer Science, volume 22, pages 1035-1039. In one embodiment, the cross-linked polymers are made in such a way that they form a three-dimensional rigid structure, which can entrap dyes in the pores formed by the three-dimensional structure. In another embodiment, the cross-linked polymers entrap the dyes by swelling. Such cross-linked polymers are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,912,221.<br>
Thus, a cross-linked polymer has one or more individual molecular chains linked by side branches to adjacent chains. The cross-links can be formed: (a) between already existing linear or branched polymers, (b) during the polymerisation of multi-functional monomers, or (c) during the polymerisation of dimeric monomers with traces of multi-functional monomers. The cross-linking can also be achieved by various means known in the art. For instance,<br><br>
the cross-links can be formed using radiation, oxidation and curing agents, such as divinylbenzene, epichlorohydrin and the like. Preferably, cross-linked polymers for the purpose of this invention are those obtained by cross-linking a water-soluble soil catcher polymer described above wit-h divinylbenzene (DVB) cross-linking agent during polymerisation of the soil catcher monomer. Cross-linking degree can be controlled by adjusting the amount of divinylbenzene (DVB) cross-linking agent. Preferably, the degree of cross-linking is between about 0.05 %wt of DVB over soil catcher monomer and about 50% of DVB over soil catcher monomer and, more preferably, between about 0.05 %wt of DVB over soil catcher monomer and about 2 5 %wt of DVB over soil catcher monomer. Most preferably, the degree of cross-linking is between about 0 - 1 %wt of DVB over soil catcher monomer and about 5 %wt of DVB over soil catcher monomer. The cross linking forms soil catcher compound particles, at least 90% of which by total weight of particles (and more preferably at least about 95%) have a<br>
d50 particle size of at least about 1 µm, preferably at<br>
least about 50 µm, and more preferably at least about 75<br>
µm, all as measured in their dry state. The d50 particle<br>
size is the particle size or weight median particle diameter which 50 %wt of the particles are larger than, and 50 %wt are smaller than.  It may suitably be determined by mechanical sieving. Most preferably, the cross linking forms soil catcher compounds, at least 90% (and more<br>
preferably at least about 95%) of which have a d50 particle<br>
size of between about 1 µm and about 5 mm, still more preferably between about 50 µm and about 2500 µm, and yet still more preferably between about 75 µm and about 1500<br><br>
µm, all as measured in their dry state. Preferably, the cross-linked polymer is a polyamine N-oxide or a quaternised polyamine.  The person skilled in the art may conveniently obtain such compounds by oxidising or quaternizing cross-linked polyvinylpyridines from Reilly Industries Inc. commercialised under the name Reillex(TM) 402 or Reillex(TM)425 by methods known in the art. For instance, but not exclusively, the method described in U.S. Pat. "No. 5,458,809 can be used to prepare a polyamine N-oxide of interest from the commercially available compounds given above. An example of quaternised polyamine can also be obtained from Reilly Industries under the commercial name Reillex(TM) HPQ.<br>
Super absorbing polymers such as acrylic cross linked polymers are useful within the scope of this patent. Examples are Alcosorb grades from Ciba, Acusol from Rohm &amp; Haas and Cabloc from Degussa.<br>
Other important polymers are ethylidene norbene polymers, ethylidene norbene/ethylene copolymers, ethylidene norbene/propylene/ethylidene ter-polymers.<br>
The soil catcher may be present in the cleaning composition in an amount of 0.01 to 100 %wt of the composition, preferably from 1 to 90 %wt, more preferably from 5 to 50 %wt.<br>
The cleaning composition may optionally contain a filler. Suitable fillers are described in detail below.  The cleaning composition may also contain additives, such as builders, chelating agents, solvents, enzymes, fragrances.<br><br>
and anti-caking agents, as described in further detail below.<br>
The cleaning composition is preferably in the form of a powder.  By "powder" we mean any solid, flowable composition.  Thus the powder may, for example, be in the form of granules or agglomerated particles.  It may, however, be in the form of a loose agglomeration of particles.  The d50 particle size of the particles may range<br>
from 0.001 µm to 10 mm, preferably from 0.01 µm to 2 mm,<br>
and more preferably from 0.1 µm to 2 mm, for example 1 µm<br>
to 1 mm.<br>
The cleaning composition may be enclosed in an enclosing wall or container which is permeable to water and to components dissolved therein.  Such an enclosed product may be used in the washing cycle of a laundry washing machine.<br>
A second aspect of the present invention provides a laundry product having an enclosing wall and containing a composition in the form of a powder, said composition comprising an insoluble active agent which is capable of binding soil, the wall being permeable to water and to components dissolved therein, wherein, after the product has been contacted with water in a laundry washing machine, the insoluble active agent remains within the enclosing wall.<br>
The laundry product of the present invention combines the advantages of a unit-dose product with an active agent which is capable of binding soil or "soil catcher" product.<br><br>
The composition advantageously additionally comprises cleaning agents selected from the group consisting of surfactants, bleaches, activators, enzymes or a mixture thereof.  These active agents are generally water soluble, so dissolve during the wash.  Thus the additional active agents are released over a period of time when exposed to water in the laundry washing machine.<br>
An advantage of the present invention is that the cleaning product is more versatile since the enclosing wall can  have an additional function.  For example the product can be contacted with or rubbed on laundry before it is added into the laundry washing machine.  In this way a pre-treatment can be carried out depending on the nature of the product.<br>
The cleaning product has an enclosing wall which is permeable to water and to components dissolved therein. The enclosing wall may also be permeable to oils and other soil or stain components suspended or dispersed in water. However, the wall is impermeable to the powder held within the product.<br>
The enclosing wall may be have a portion which is insoluble and permeable to water, and another portion which is insoluble and impermeable to water.  In use, a user may hold the product by the impermeable wall section and, for example, press the permeable wall section directly with the stain.  In this way, contact between the user's hands and the contents of the enclosing wall is avoided.<br>
By water permeable we mean having a water permeability of at least 1000 1/mVs at 100 Pa according to DIN EN ISO 9237.  In addition the wall must not be so permeable that<br><br>
it is not able to hold the powder composition.  Thus, for example, the wall may have a mesh size of less Than 250 microns, preferably less than 150 microns, more preferably less than 50 microns.<br>
The product should not be able to move out of the drum, such as by entering the internal pipework of the washing machine and onto the filter.  Thus if it is intended to be added direct to the drum it is generally large, preferably having a minimum length and width of at least 120 mm.<br>
The product is preferably flat, i.e. its thickness is at least 5 times less, preferably at least 10 times less, ideally at least 30 times less, than each of its other two dimensions, the width and the length (which are the same as each other when the product is square or circular in plan).<br>
The product may be placed with the laundry to be washed in an .automatic laundry washing machine.  The closed product preferably resists a laundry wash cycle (2h wash/rinse/spin cycle, 95°C, spinning at 1600rpm) without opening.  The product may be discarded after use.<br>
The product may also be used in a stain treating step prior to placing into an automatic laundry washing machine.  For example, the product may be wet with water and used directly onto the stain by a scrubbing action.  When the composition starts to dissolve, it may be released through the enclosing wall or container to the treated garment area.<br><br>
Alternatively, the laundry product may be placed in a bucket with water and the stained laundry.  After soaking the laundry for a predetermined period of time, the laundry may be removed.  In one embodiment, the laundry is allowed to soak a period of time ranging from 1 minute to overnight, preferably from 10 minutes to 6 hours.<br>
The product may be formed into a flat container or a sachet.  The sachet may measure at least 2 cm across. Preferably, the sachet measures at least 10 cm across.  The sachet is preferably sufficiently large for it to be held conveniently by hand and applied directly to the soiled laundry item.<br>
The sachet may be formed from a sandwich of two webs.  A water permeable sheet or film is present in one of the webs, at least, and forms at least one wall of the container.  The water-permeable outer wall may comprise, for example, a woven, knitted or preferably non-woven material, of textile, polymer or paper.  Suitable polymers include cellular polymer materials.  The material may be in the form of single layer or laminated layers.  Preferably the wall comprises a sheet with a ply of one, two or three layers, such that any non-dissolved or insoluble agent inside the container is too large to pass through the perforation (s) or would have to follow an impossibly tortuous pathway if it were to exit the container through the wall.  Preferably the sheet is a woven or non-woven material.<br>
The product may conveniently comprise two webs sealed together about their periphery, with the contents held inside.  The sealing may be by means of adhesive or<br><br>
dielectric welding or, preferably, heat sealing or, most preferably, ultrasound sealing.  When the sealing is by heat sealing the sheets may comprise a thermoplastic to facilitate this.  The material forming the adhesive strips can be a so  called hot melt comprising various materials, such as APP, SBS, SEES, SIS, EVA and the like, or a cold glue, such as a dispersion of various materials, e.g. SBS, natural rubber and the like, or even a solvent-based or a two-component adhesive system.  Furthermore, the material may be capable of crosslinking to form specific, permanent chemical bonds with the various layers. Polyethylene glycols with different molecular weights can be used as well, having average molecular weights ranging from 1000 to 20000, most preferred ones  are from 2000 to 8000.  The amount of adhesive used is a function of the type of adhesive selected.  However it is generally from 0,2 to 20 g/m2.<br>
Conventional materials used in tea bag manufacture or in the manufacture of sanitary or diaper products may be suitable, and the techniques used in making tea bags or sanitary products can be applied to make flexible products useful in this invention.  Such techniques are described in WO 98/36128, US-A-6,093,474, EP-A-708,628 and EP'A-380,127. US 5,053,270 also describes a method of forming a flexible product useful in this invention.<br>
Conveniently the two webs are non-wovens.  Processes for manufacturing nonwoven fabrics can be grouped into four general categories leading to four main types of nonwoven products, textile-related, paper-related, extrusion-polymer processing related and hybrid combinations.<br><br>
Textiles.  Textile technologies include garneting, carding, and aerodynamic forming of fibres into selectively oriented webs.  Fabrics produced by these systems are referred to as drylaid nonwovens, and they carry terms such as garneted, carded, and airlaid fabrics.  Textile-based nonwoven fabrics, or fibre-network structures, are manufactured with. machinery designed to manipulate textile fibres in the dry state.  Also included in this category are structures formed with filament bundles or tow, and fabrics composed of staple fibres and stitching threads.<br>
In general, textile-technology based processes provide maximum product versatility, since most textile fibres and bonding systems can be utilised.<br>
Paper.  Paper-based technologies include drylaid pulp and wetlaid (modified paper) systems designed to accommodate short synthetic fibres, as well as wood pulp fibres. Fabrics produced by these systems are referred to as drylaid pulp and wetlaid nonwovens.  Paper-based nonwoven fabrics are manufactured with machinery designed to manipulate short fibres suspended in fluid.<br>
Extrusions.  Extrusions include spunbond, meltblown, and porous film systems.  Fabrics produced by these systems are referred to individually as spunbonded, meltblown, and textured or apertured film nonwovens, or'generically as polymer-laid nonwovens.  Extrusion-based nonwovens are manufactured with machinery associated with polymer extrusion.  In polymer-laid systems, fibre structures simultaneously are formed and manipulated.<br><br>
Hybrids.  Hybrids include fabric/sheet combining systems, combination systems   and composite systems.  Combining systems employ lamination technology or at least one basic nonwoven web formation or consolidation technology to join two or more fabric substrates.  Combination systems utilize at least one fabric substrate.  Composite systems integrate two or more basic nonwoven web formation technologies to produce web structures.  Hybrid processes combine technology advantages for specific applications.<br>
Suitable materials for forming the enclosing wall are paper or a polyolefin, such as  polyethylene or polypropylene, or another polymer such as a polyester or polyamide.  Suitably the enclosing wall comprises a water-permeable, water-insoluble web, preferably of one or a mixture of the above materials.  The enclosing wall is preferably a woven or non-woven web.  The materials making up the enclosing wall are preferably in the form of fibres.<br>
The surface of the enclosing wall may be subjected to corona or plasma treatment or a permanent chemical treatment, for example with cationic polymers. All these treatments may give rise to an increase in the affinity of organic molecules to the substrate through ionic or polar interaction. By doing this the free stain molecules in the wash liquor are captured by the wall of the product which work as a filter, reducing the stain re-deposition on fabrics -<br>
The enclosing wall may also be formed of a cellular plastics material.  Suitable cellular plastics for forming the enclosing wall have densities of 1 to 500 kgm-3, preferably from 20 to 80 kgm-3 and with an average pore<br><br>
diameter of at least 0,1 mm, preferably at least 0.4 mm. Ideally, the cellular plastics has a porosity of greater than 50%, preferably greater than 50%, more preferably greater than 70%, most preferably greater than 80%.<br>
The porosity is determined by using a dry automatic densimeter by to measure the apparent volume and true volume of the cellular plastic material.  The porosity is then calculated in accordance with the following equation:<br>
Porosity %=[apparent volume-true volume)/apparent volume] x 100<br>
The "average pore diameter" is a value measured in accordance with ASTM (Designation: D4404-84) and is specifically a value determined by the measurement of the diameter of pores in accordance with a mercury penetration process using a mercury porosimeter manufactured by Porous Material, Inc.<br>
Suitable cellular plastics materials are those readily available for example from Euro foam, Miarka and Menshen and are made from any suitable water-insoluble plastic such as cellulose, polyurethane, polyester, polyether, or blends thereof.<br>
The product of the present invention may have an enclosing wall which has a roughened outer surface.  The roughened outer surface may be provided by the wall being in the form of woven or non-woven fibres.  The roughness of the surface depends on, for example, the diameter of the fibres.  The roughened outer surface may also be provided by ensuring chat an otherwise uniform outer wall has a surface texture.<br><br>
This could be provided, for example, by including particulate matter in the wall or by forming the wall in an appropriate manner.  A. roughened outer surface may provide a number of advantages.  For example, it ensures that the product is less likely to slip out of a consumer's hand, particularly when the product is damp and hence slippery. It also assists a secondary function of the product, that is to provide a pre-treatment of the laundry before it is washed.  The product may simply be contacted with or rubbed on the laundry, especially a stained part thereof, to treat the laundry before washing, for example to remove a stain or assist in stain removal.  Some of the cleaning composition from inside the product may leach outside to assist in this pre-treatment-  It is also possible for an additional agent to be attached to the outside of the product.<br>
The enclosing wall of the product may be a cellulosic material, for example a cellulosic textile or paper material.<br>
The- product of the present invention is preferably such that, after it has been contacted with water in a ware washing machine, less than 8 0 %wt of the cleaning composition remains, preferably less than 50 %wt and most preferably less than 30 %wt.  This is with reference to the product placed in the drum of a standard laundry washing machine, such as a Bosch WFR 3240 washing machine, at a standard washing cycle, in particular a cotton cycle at 40-60°C, and at any water hardness, but preferably at a water hardness of 18 to 24°dH (German degrees) .  Preferably, at least 5, 10, 15, 20 or 25 %wt of the cleaning composition remains in the product after it has thus been contracted<br><br>
with water in a ware washing machine.  The residue in the product is preferably mainly composed of the soil catcher. In another embodiment of the present invention, the product<br>
may open up completely during wash cycle in the wash drum,<br>
*<br>
releasing all its content and binding loose dye and dirt on the product wall.  Preferably a Bosch WFR 3240 laundry washing machine is used at a cotton cycle at 60°C and at a water hardness of 18°dH.  For the avoidance of doubt, even though this test uses a particular laundry washing machine, the laundry treatment product of the present invention can be used in any laundry washing machine at any cycle.  If the product meets the above test, it is capable of being used in any laundry machine at any cycle.<br>

completely reduced to oxides.  The active oxygen sources increase the ability of the compositions to remove oxidisable stains, to destroy malodorous molecules and to kill germs.<br>
The concentration of available oxygen can be determined by methods known in the art, such as the iodimetric method, the permanganometric method and the cerimetric method. Said methods and the criteria for the choice of the appropriate method are described for example in 'Hydrogen Peroxide", W. C. Schumo, C. N. Satterfield and R. L.

To test the effect of Examples 1 to 53 on oil-based stains, 0.1 grams of nut oil was applied directly on blue WFK<br><br>
cotton swatches.  To test the effect of Examples 1 to 53 on water-based stains, 0,15 grams of tea and grape juice were applied on Tic 400 WFK cotton swatches.  The stains were left for 10 minutes before cleaning.<br>
In the cleaning process, 4 grams of the soil catcher powders of Examples 1 to 53 were used to treat the stain. The soiled areas were rubbed with a small sponge in order to improve the contact between the stain and the powder. The powder was then left to work for 10 minutes and then brushed away with 5 scrubbing actions in the vertical direction and 5 in the horizontal direction.<br>
The tea and grape juice stains were evaluated through a spectrophotometer, by measuring the reflectance values. The X Y Z scale was used with a spectrophotometer with the UV-filter at 460 nm. Y = 90 means a complete stain removal (white cotton has a value of 90).<br>
The nut oil stain on blue swatches was evaluated through panel test with a rating between 1 and 5.  A rating of 1 was given in cases where the stain was completely removed. A rating of 5 was given in cases where the stain remained unchanged.<br>
The ease with which the soil catcher powder could be removed from the swatches was also evaluated through panel test by using a rating from 0 to 4, where:<br>
0	= no residue<br>
1	= little residue<br>
2	= medium residue<br>
3	= medium/high residue<br><br>
4   =  high residue (sticky)<br>
The results are shown in the Tables below. 5  Table 5<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
