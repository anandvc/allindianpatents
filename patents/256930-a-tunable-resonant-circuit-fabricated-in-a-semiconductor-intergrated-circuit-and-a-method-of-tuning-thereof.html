1.	Field of Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to a programmable radio transceiver including a<br>
resonant LC circuit, a wideband programmable local oscillator and a built-in control<br>
module.<br>
2.	Discussion of Related Art<br>
Wireless communications continues to grow at unprecedented rates. Today, there<br>
are over 1 billion mobile wireless devices worldwide. There are multiple frequency<br>
bands and communications standards/protocols for cellular, wide area, local area<br>
networks, public safety and military communications throughout the world that make<br>
ubiquitous communications difficult at best.<br>
The demand for individual devices to use combinations of these converged<br>
services is growing rapidly (TAM is expected to exceed $3B by 2006). Many<br>
semiconductor and equipment companies, recognizing this growing market need, have<br>
turned to exotic, expensive materials such as Silicon-Germanium (SiGe) or<br>
microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) to achieve better performance, multi-feature<br>
integrated circuits. Others have turned to high power-consuming techniques such as high<br>
frequency sampling to create solutions.<br>
Presently, to build a subscriber device that can address more than two frequency<br>
bands and different protocols has been costly and physically large. Most device<br>
manufacturers have tried by putting two different chipsets down on a single medium. In<br>
particular, one current design includes, for example, the Nokia D211 WLAN &amp; GPRS<br>
PCMCIA card. This card uses both a multi-chip chipset for the WLAN portion and a<br>
STMicroelectronics chipset for the GPRS functionality. This methodology is costly,<br>
large and in-flexible.<br>
An obstacle in the design of high-density, wideband, tunable integrated circuits in<br>
the GHz range is the need to provide resonant circuits with low losses that can be tuned<br>
over a wide frequency range. The present state of the art relies on circuits including<br>
inductors made from the metal layers in the semiconductor fabrication of application<br>
specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and system-on-chip (SoC) devices that can be<br><br>
modified in such a way as to form flat geometries of rectangular or spiral type of<br>
structures that store magnetic energy. These devices are called spiral inductors. The<br>
amount of inductance of such a device is determined by the number of turns and their<br>
physical size with respect to the chip area. Unfortunately one drawback to these types of<br>
inductor implementations is the inability to scale with technology node size (which<br>
defines parameters such as device gate length). In fact, as the node size in analog CMOS<br>
(complementary metal oxide semiconductor) technology is migrating toward gate lengths<br>
of 130nm and below, the physical dimensions of inductive elements remain essentially<br>
the same, thereby impeding the reduction in total chip area. Additional problems<br>
associated with spiral inductors include their tendency to create conductor losses<br>
(resulting in low quality factor tuning circuits), to induce radiation and to induce<br>
electromagnetic field diffusion (eddy current) effects in the substrate.<br>
There have been attempts made to construct LC resonant circuits with bondwires,<br>
as discussed for example in U.S. Patent No. 6,806,785 to Traub, issued October 19, 2004.<br>
The '785 patent discloses the use of a bond wire to form an inductor that is part of a<br>
narrowband oscillator circuit, describing the oscillator circuit as including voltage-<br>
variable capacitances, bondwire inductors, and a de-attenuation amplifier.<br>
A fundamental building block in many telecommunications transceiver circuits is<br>
a frequency synthesizer. The purpose of the frequency synthesizer is to produce the<br>
required harmonic signals for frequency up-conversion in the transmitter and frequency<br>
down-conversion in the receiver. Frequency synthesis allows the generation of adjustable<br>
frequencies in small, accurate steps (e.g., 200kHz for GSM, 1.728MHz for DECT (digital<br>
enhanced cordless telephone), and the like) that are subsequently used in a mixer to<br>
enable band and channel selection.<br>
The present state-of-the-art in frequency synthesis relies on either integer-N or<br>
fractional-N architectures realized in a phase lock loop (PLL) circuit having a phase<br>
detector, a low-pass filter, and a programmable divider in the feedback loop. One<br>
example of a conventional frequency synthesis circuit including a PLL with a<br>
programmable division factor frequency divider, a phase comparator with filters, a<br>
reference frequency oscillator and a reference divider is described in German Patent<br>
DE10131091 to D. Gapski, issued July 18, 2002. Another example of a frequency<br>
synthesizer including a multiband frequency generator coupled to a multiple VCO<br><br>
configuration oscillator is described in U.S. Patent No. 6,785,525 to Ries, issued August<br>
31.2004. An example of dual frequency synthesis for communication and signal strength<br>
monitoring is described in GB2254971 to W. Torbjorn, published October 12, 1992. In<br>
addition, several examples of direct digital frequency synthesis are described in U.S. Patent<br>
Application 2004264547 to Hinrichs et al, published 2004-12-30, U.S. Patent Application<br>
2004176045 to Frank, published 2004-09-09, and European Patent EP0409127 to Watanabe<br>
Nozomu, published 1991-01 -23.<br>
However, the prior art is unsuitable for deployment in a single multi-band, multi-standard<br>
transceiver where space, cost, and wideband frequency operation is at a premium, for reasons<br>
such as inflexible, narrow-band frequency tuning capability and high component count<br>
implementation.<br>
WO 03/061108 is directed to a voltage-controlled oscillator for use in a phase locked loop for<br>
implementing a direct modulation scheme. However, WO 03/061108 makes no mention of<br>
using connection inductances such as bond wires for the inductance of the resonant circuit.<br>
US 6628170 or WO 99/63656A is directed to an integrated circuit (IC) that includes a<br>
variable gain high frequency low noise amplifier (LNA) and a filter. US 6628170 or WO<br>
99/63656A does not disclose such a tuneable resonant circuit fabricated in a semiconductor<br>
integrated circuit without the use of spiral inductors.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
In view of the disadvantages present in the prior art, it would therefore be desirable to design<br>
and implement an RFIC that does not include spiral inductors and has a local oscillator that is<br>
capable of wide-band tuning so as to service multiple frequency bands. In addition, it may be<br>
desirable to incorporate in the RFIC a built-in test and evaluation module that may provide in<br>
situ monitoring of parameters of the RFIC and is capable of dynamically adjusting<br>
parameters of the RFIC to comply with multiple telecommunication standards.<br>
Aspects and embodiments of the present invention are directed to a programmable mixed-<br>
signal radio transceiver comprising a low cost radio frequency integrated circuit (RFIC),<br>
which is frequency and protocol agnostic. Embodiments of the RFIC provide a fully<br>
integrated radio transceiver with digital inputs and outputs that is programmable and<br>
configurable for multiple radio frequency bands and standards and that is capable of<br>
connecting to many networks, service providers or standards.<br>
According to one embodiment, a tunable resonant circuit fabricated in a semiconductor<br>
integrated circuit comprises at least one transmission line having an inductance, a plurality of<br>
switchable capacitors configured to be switched into and out of the tunable resonant circuit in<br>
response to a first control signal, and at least one variable capacitor that can be varied in<br>
response to a second control signal, wherein a center resonant frequency of the resonant<br>
circuit is electronically tunable responsive to the first and second control<br><br><br>
signals that control a first capacitance value of the plurality of switchable capacitors and a<br>
second capacitance value of the at least one variable capacitor.<br>
In one example, the transmission line comprises a bondwire that interconnects the<br>
integrated circuit and a lead frame. Alternatively, the transmission line may be a<br>
microstrip line or coplanar waveguide line. The plurality of fixed capacitors may be, for<br>
example, metal oxide semiconductor MOS capacitors or metal-insulator-metal (MIM)<br>
capacitors. In another example, the resonant circuit may further comprise a switch<br>
network coupled to the plurality of switchable capacitors, the switch network being<br>
operable, responsive to the first control signal, to switch in and out any of the switchable<br>
capacitors to tune the first capacitive value to provide a selected range of the resonance<br>
frequency. The variable capacitor may be, for example, a varactor diode and the second<br>
capacitance value may be controlled by adjusting a bias voltage of the varactor diode<br>
responsive to the second control signal. The resonant circuit may be coupled to, for<br>
example, a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) to control a tuning range of the VCO. In<br>
another example, the resonant circuit may be coupled to low noise amplifier (LNA)<br>
circuit and a reactance of the resonant circuit may be tuned so as to cancel a reactance of<br>
the low noise amplifier and match an input impedance of the low noise amplifier to a<br>
particular load impedance.<br>
According to another embodiment, a method of tuning a resonant circuit over a<br>
plurality of frequency bands and within one frequency band of the plurality of frequency<br>
bands, the method comprises providing an inductance, providing a first capacitance value<br>
in parallel with the inductance from a plurality of switchable capacitors in response to a<br>
first control signal to tune the resonant circuit the one frequency band, and providing a<br>
second capacitance value in parallel with the inductance in response to a second control<br>
signal to tune the resonant circuit within the one frequency band.<br>
In one example, providing the first capacitance value may includes switching in<br>
and out of the resonant circuit any of the switchable capacitors so as to obtain the first<br>
capacitance value. In another example, the second capacitance value may be provided by<br>
a varactor diode and providing the second capacitance may include varying a bias voltage<br>
of the varactor diode responsive to the second control signal. In another example, the<br>
method may include a step of controlling a tuning range of a voltage controlled oscillator<br>
by coupling the resonant circuit to the voltage controlled oscillator. In another example,<br><br>
the method may include a step of matching an input impedance of a low noise amplifier<br>
to a load by coupling the resonant circuit to the low noise amplifier, and tuning a<br>
reactance of the resonant circuit so as to balance a reactance of the low noise amplifier<br>
and match an input impedance of the low noise amplifier to the load.<br>
According to another embodiment, a frequency synthesizer implemented as a<br>
phase locked loop comprises a voltage controlled oscillator that produces a VCO<br>
frequency signal, a resonant circuit coupled to the voltage controlled oscillator and<br>
adapted to adjust a tuning range of the voltage controlled oscillator, and a divider circuit<br>
coupled to the voltage controlled oscillator and positioned in a forward loop path of the<br>
phase locked loop, the divider circuit being adapted to produce a frequency that is a<br>
divided version of the VCO frequency signal.<br>
In one example, the phase locked loop may comprise a second divider circuit<br>
positioned in a feedback path of the phase locked loop and adapted to provide a divided<br>
output signal, a phase detector coupled to the second divider circuit and adapted to<br>
receive the divided output signal and produce a loop tuning signal, and a reference<br>
frequency source coupled to the phase detector and adapted to produce a reference<br>
frequency signal. The phase detector may be adapted to produce the tuning signal based<br>
on a comparison of the divided output signal and the reference frequency signal. In<br>
another example, the phase locked loop further comprises a mixer positioned in the<br>
forward loop path and adapted to receive the first frequency signal and the VCO<br>
frequency signal and to produce an output signal, wherein the divided output signal is a<br>
divided version of the output signal. In one example, the reference frequency source may<br>
comprise a direct digital synthesizer including a reference crystal oscillator, and a<br>
reference center frequency of the reference frequency signal may be determined by a<br>
control signal received by the direct synthesizer from a microcontroller that is integrated<br>
in a semiconductor chip with the frequency synthesizer. In addition, the a VCO center<br>
frequency of the VCO frequency signal may be tuned based on a combination of the loop<br>
tuning signal and the resonant tuning signal.<br>
According to another example, the resonant circuit coupled to the frequency<br>
synthesizer may be an LC resonant circuit comprising at least one transmission line<br>
having an inductance, a plurality of switchable capacitors configured to be switched into<br>
and out of the tunable resonant circuit in response to a first control signal, and at least one<br><br>
variable capacitor that can be varied in response to a second control signal, wherein a<br>
center resonant frequency of the resonant circuit is electronically tunable responsive to<br>
the first and second control signals that control a first capacitance value of the plurality of<br>
switchable capacitors and a second capacitance value of the at least one variable<br>
capacitor. Furthermore, a resonant center frequency of the resonant tuning signal may be<br>
selected by controlling the first capacitance value such that a resonance of the resonant<br>
circuit falls within a selected frequency band, and by controlling the variable capacitor to<br>
tune the resonant center frequency within the selected frequency band. The VCO center<br>
frequency may be within the selected frequency band.<br>
According to another embodiment, a method of tuning a wideband local oscillator<br>
may include providing an inductance, a first capacitance value and a second capacitance<br>
value, all connected in parallel, to provide a resonant circuit, selecting the first<br>
capacitance value from a plurality of switchable capacitors in response to a first control<br>
signal to tune a resonant frequency signal of the resonant circuit to a selected frequency<br>
band, selecting the second capacitance value in response to a second control signal to tune<br>
the resonant frequency within the one frequency band, and coupling the resonant<br>
frequency signal to a voltage controlled oscillator to tune the local oscillator.<br>
According to another embodiment, a wideband local oscillator may comprise a<br>
voltage controlled oscillator adapted to receive a resonant tuning signal and to generate a<br>
local oscillator signal, the local oscillator signal having a center frequency determined at<br>
least in part by the resonant tuning signal, a resonant circuit including an inductor, a first<br>
capacitance and a second capacitance all connected in parallel, the resonant circuit being<br>
coupled to the voltage controlled oscillator and being adapted to generate the resonant<br>
tuning signal, the first capacitance comprising a plurality of switchable capacitors coupled<br>
to switches that allow selected ones of the plurality of switchable capacitors to be<br>
connected in the resonant circuit, responsive to a capacitor control signal, thereby<br>
determining a value of the first capacitance, the second capacitance comprising at least<br>
one varactor diode adapted to be tuned in response to a diode control signal to determine<br>
a value of the second capacitance, and wherein a frequency the resonant tuning signal is<br>
determined based on the first capacitance value and the second capacitance value in<br>
combination with the inductance.<br><br>
In one example of the wideband local oscillator, the plurality of switchable<br>
capacitors are configured such that by switching into the resonant circuit the selected ones<br>
of the plurality of switchable capacitors, and the first capacitance value is controlled so as<br>
to tune the frequency of the resonant tuning signal to one selected frequency band of a<br>
plurality of frequency bands. In another example, the at least one varactor diode may be<br>
configured such that tuning of a center frequency of the resonant frequency signal within<br>
the one selected frequency band is accomplished by adjusting the second capacitance<br>
value. In another example, controlling which selected ones of the plurality of switchable<br>
capacitors are connected into the resonant circuit may allow selecting of different<br>
frequency bands of the plurality of frequency bands, so as to allow tuning of the resonant<br>
tuning signal over the plurality of frequency bands and within one frequency band of the<br>
plurality of frequency bands.<br>
According to another embodiment, there is provided an integrated evaluation and<br>
test module for a radio transceiver implemented on a semiconductor substrate, the radio<br>
transceiver comprising a receiver chain that generates a radio frequency signal, the<br>
integrated evaluation and test module being integrated on the semiconductor substrate<br>
with the radio transceiver. The evaluation and test module may include a control input<br>
adapted to receive a digital control signal, a signal input adapted to receive a digitized<br>
version of the radio frequency signal from the receiver chain of the radio transceiver, a<br>
processing module coupled to the signal input and adapted to receive and process the<br>
digitized version of the radio frequency signal from the receiver chain of the radio<br>
transceiver, and to provide a digital output signal, and a reference generator adapted to<br>
generate a digital reference signal based on information contained in the digital control<br>
signal. The evaluation and test module may further include a comparator coupled to the<br>
reference generator and to the processing module and adapted to receive the digital output<br>
signal and the digital reference signal, the comparator being configured to compare the<br>
digital output signal with the digital reference signal and to generate an error signal that<br>
identifies discrepancies between the digital output signal and the digital reference signal,<br>
and an adjustment module coupled to the comparator and adapted to receive the error<br>
signal from the comparator and to generate digital adjustment data, the adjustment<br>
module being further adapted to provide the digital adjustment data to at least one<br>
component of the receiver chain of the radio transceiver to adjust at least one parameter<br><br>
of the at least one component so as to modify the radio frequency signal to reduce the<br>
error signal.<br>
In one example, of the integrated evaluation and test module, the processing<br>
module may comprise a processor configured to perform a Fourier transform on the<br>
digitized version of the radio frequency signal from the receiver chain of the radio<br>
transceiver to provide the digital output signal comprising frequency domain information<br>
about the radio frequency signal. In another example, the digital reference signal may<br>
contain frequency domain information corresponding to desired characteristics of the<br>
radio frequency signal. In another example, the comparator may be configured to<br>
compare the frequency domain information from the digital output signal with the<br>
frequency domain information contained in the digital reference signal and to generate the<br>
error signal which contains information about frequency domain variations between the<br>
digital output signal and the digital reference signal. In one example, the adjustment<br>
module includes a finite state machine.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Various illustrative embodiments and aspects thereof will now be described in<br>
detail with reference to the accompanying figures. It is to be appreciated that this<br>
invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the<br>
arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the<br>
drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or of<br>
being carried out in various implementations. Also, the phraseology and terminology<br>
used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. The<br>
use of "including," "comprising," "having," "containing," "involving," and variations<br>
thereof, herein is meant to encompass the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof<br>
as well as additional items.<br>
Aspects and embodiments of the present invention are directed to a programmable<br>
mixed-signal radio transceiver comprising a low cost radio frequency integrated circuit<br>
(RFIC), which is frequency and protocol agnostic. Embodiments of the RFIC provide a<br>
fully integrated radio transceiver with digital inputs and outputs that is programmable and<br>
configurable for multiple radio frequency bands and standards and that is capable of<br>
connecting to many networks, service providers or standards. The RFIC may be used by<br>
device manufacturers to build multi-mode or single mode devices that are low cost and<br>
small in size. The RFIC can be used, for example, in laptops, smartphones, personal<br>
digital assistant devices (PDAs), multi-media devices, public-safety radios, machine-to-<br>
machine communications devices, etc. This device can be used by, for example, IC<br>
solution providers or device designers and will allow manufacturers to use a single low<br>
cost CMOS re-configurable RFIC to increase features while lowering the cost and<br>
complexity of their designs. For example, the RFIC may replace several chips from<br>
various vendors, thereby reducing the size and cost of a radio transceiver device.<br>
The reconfigurable architecture of the RFIC, according to embodiments of the<br>
invention, is unique in its approach to solving the problem of providing multi-standard<br><br>
compatibility, frequency flexibility, and customization with a single-chip IC. For<br>
example, one approach can leverage the high performance and low cost of standard 130<br>
nm bulk CMOS technology and various aspects of the invention to allow for extremely<br>
high levels of integration and small die size. The RFIC may integrate a full transceiver<br>
that operates from, for example, about 400 MHz to 6 GHz and can include, for example,<br>
frequency generation and synthesis components, analog-to-digital converters, digital-to-<br>
analog converters and digital filtering, as discussed in more detail below.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, there is illustrated a block diagram of one embodiment of an<br>
RFIC according to aspects of the invention. As shown in FIG. 1, the RFIC 101<br>
architecture comprises a configurable receiver 100, a configurable transmitter 102, a<br>
frequency synthesizer 104, a built-in test and evaluation (BITE) module 106 and an<br>
integrated microcontroller 108 coupled together via a programming bus 110. In one<br>
embodiment, the frequency synthesizer employs a wide band local oscillator architecture<br>
that comprises a narrowband VCO combined with a programmable divider to generate<br>
local oscillator signals for the radio transceiver, as discussed in detail below. Through the<br>
use of a process running on the microcontroller 108, the programmable receiver 100 and<br>
programmable transmitter 102 can be configured for center operating frequency and<br>
dynamic range, and a number of parameters can be programmed. For example, the<br>
programmable receiver 100 may be configured for selectivity and sensitivity and various<br>
receiver parameters such as input center frequency, power gain, noise figure, bandwidth,<br>
sampling rate, effective number of bits (ENOB) and power consumption. Similarly,<br>
parameters of the programmable transmitter, such as input and output center frequencies,<br>
spurious output levels, noise, and dynamic range, may be configured by the<br>
microcontroller, as discussed in detail below. The microcontroller provides centralized<br>
control for the RFIC and may supply control signals to control multiple system<br>
parameters, as discussed below. Operation of the desired configuration of the<br>
programmable receiver and the programmable transmitter can be facilitated by the BITE<br>
module 106 implementing a closed-loop built in test and calibration. In one embodiment,<br>
the BITE module 106 enables accurate switching of the RF analog chain to different<br>
telecommunication standards as well as the monitoring and adjusting the circuit<br>
performance parameters, as discussed below.<br><br>
The RFIC architecture can further comprise a programmable digital interface 112<br>
coupled to the microcontroller 108 (and other components) via a digital bus 114. The<br>
programmable digital interface may be controlled by the microcontroller and programmed<br>
for parameters such as number of I/Os, common mode level, signal level, clocking speed,<br>
polarity, signal content, etc. The RFIC can also include any or all of a tunable low noise<br>
amplifier 116 and driver amplifier 118, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) 120 and<br>
digital-to-analog converter (DAC) 122, a digital baseband processor module 124, a<br>
memory device 126, a master impedance module 128 and a master clock 130.<br>
According to one embodiment, the RFIC may further comprise a programmable<br>
antenna assembly 174 that is coupled to the programming bus 110, the LNA 116 and the<br>
driver amplifier 118. The programmable antenna assembly may be adapted to receive RF<br>
signals (e.g., radio broadcasts, wireless phone or data signals, etc.) and to transmit RF<br>
signals. The programmable antenna assembly 174 may include components such as a<br>
duplexer to allow simultaneous transmission and reception of RF signals, amplifiers, and<br>
band selection circuitry to allow the antenna assembly to transmit and receive signals in<br>
an appropriate frequency band. These components may be controlled by signals from the<br>
microcontroller via the programming bus.<br>
The RFIC according to embodiments of the invention is a mixed signal device,<br>
that is, a device that inputs, outputs and processes both RF signals and digital signals. To<br>
minimize noise generated by the microcontroller, ADC, DAC, BITE module and other<br>
digital components, tri-state outputs may be used. Tri-state outputs are floating, high<br>
ohmic impedance values in digital circuitry that essentially decouple the output of a<br>
digital circuit from the input of the next stage. The tri-state outputs present a high<br>
impedance to analog circuits such as the RF portions of the RFIC. As a result, any digital<br>
signals (i.e., state transitions from logic low to logic high or vice versa) are prevented<br>
from coupling to the analog circuits and causing noise in the analog circuitry.<br>
According to one embodiment, a radio transceiver device using the RFIC of FIG.<br>
1 may be provided having an architecture that eliminates or reduces the use of spiral<br>
inductors, thereby making the radio transceiver more scalable with improving<br>
semiconductor technologies. Specifically, at least one embodiment includes a<br>
methodology and device for implementing a tunable resonant circuit over a wide<br>
bandwidth (for example, 800 MHz to 2.5 GHz) using transmission lines, such as, for<br><br>
example, bondwires, microstrip lines, or co-planar waveguides, in a microelectronic<br>
integrated circuit such as complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)<br>
technology. According to one embodiment, a programmable resonant LC circuit may be<br>
created using fixed inductors formed by transmission lines in conjunction with fixed and<br>
tunable capacitive elements. This architecture enables the efficient implementation of<br>
wideband tuning circuits for analog circuits in the gigahertz range while eliminating the<br>
current state-of-the-art spiral inductors in resonance or tank circuits. The tunable<br>
resonant circuit can be used, for example, to form part of voltage controlled oscillators<br>
and analog amplifier blocks in the programmable radio transceiver device.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, there is illustrated a block diagram of one embodiment of<br>
bondwires 150 used to couple a circuit to a semiconductor base, such as a lead frame 148.<br>
The bondwires 150 are connected (e.g., soldered) to bonding pads 152 that are printed or<br>
etched on the semiconductor substrate that supports the circuit 180 and on the lead frame<br>
148. According to one embodiment, the circuit 180 may comprise a reactive (LC) tank<br>
circuit that may be tuned for resonant frequency and input impedance, as discussed<br>
further below.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, there is illustrated a block diagram of one embodiment of a<br>
programmable resonant circuit 132 employing an inductor and a variable capacitance.<br>
The resonant circuit 132 includes an inductor 134 that may be formed by a transmission<br>
line structure, such as a bondwire, microstrip lines or coplanar waveguide lines. The<br>
inductor 134 is connected in parallel with tunable capacitive elements 136 and 138<br>
between a first node 140 and a second node 142 that are used to couple the resonant<br>
circuit to other components and/or circuits. In one embodiment, the capacitance of the<br>
variable capacitive elements 136 and 138 may be controlled by control signals 144 from,<br>
for example, the microcontroller and/or BITE module, as discussed in more detail below.<br>
According to one embodiment, the inductor 134 may be provided by the parasitic<br>
inductance associated with semiconductor packaging. More specifically, referring to<br>
FIG. 3, a semiconductor integrated circuit 146, such as the RFIC of the present invention,<br>
is typically coupled to a lead frame 148 using a plurality of bondwires 150. Each of these<br>
bondwires 150 has associated with it a certain inductance that is dependent on the length<br>
of the bondwire, the cross-sectional area of the bondwire and the spacing between<br>
adjacent bondwires. The bondwire 150 has a fixed self-inductance that may be<br><br>
approximately determined from the length and cross-section of the bondwire. In addition,<br>
mutual inductive coupling between closely spaced bondwires affects the inductance of<br>
each bondwire. A particular inductance can therefore be implemented by suitably<br>
adjusting length, cross section, and spacing of the bondwires.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 3 and 4, the resonant LC circuit of FIG. 2 may be implemented<br>
using one or more such bondwires 150 of fixed inductance that interconnect bonding pads<br>
152 on the RFIC 146 and the lead frame 148. In one example, the resonance circuit 132<br>
may comprise at least two mutually coupled bondwire conductors 150. However it is to<br>
be appreciated that the invention is not limited to the use of two bondwires and one or<br>
more wires may be used in various applications. For example, referring to FIG. 11, there<br>
is illustrated a representative circuit diagram of another embodiment of a bondwire<br>
inductor configuration according to aspects of the invention. Three or more bondwires<br>
150 may be connected, end-to-end in a meandering manner as shown in FIG. 11. For<br>
example, a first bondwire 150a may be coupled to a circuit (e.g., circuit 146) on a<br>
semiconductor chip via a coupling capacitor - and a bonding pad 152. The first bondwire<br>
inductor 150a may be coupled to a second bondwire inductor 150b via bonding pads 152<br>
and a first capacitance 188a. The second bondwire inductance may in turn be coupled to<br>
a third bondwire inductor 150c via bonding pads 152 and a second capacitance 188b,<br>
which may also in turn be coupled to a fourth bondwire inductor 150d via bonding pads<br>
and a third capacitance 188c, as shown in FIG. 11. The pattern my be continued<br>
indefinitely to couple as many bondwire inductors together as may be desired for any<br>
given application. The fourth bondwire inductor may then be coupled to the<br>
semiconductor circuit 146 via a bonding pad 152 and another coupling capacitor 166.<br>
The meander-like configuration illustrated in FIG. 11 may be used to increase the<br>
inductance provided the bondwires. The capacitances 188a-c may be variable and may be<br>
used to control the overall reactance provided by the series of bondwire inductors. The<br>
ability to control the reactance may be desirable for a number of reasons, including added<br>
flexibility in controlling the input impedance of, for example, a resonant circuit to which<br>
the bondwire inductor belongs, and in impedance matching to other circuit components to<br>
which the bondwire inductors may be connected.<br>
In addition, it is to be appreciated that the bondwires 150 act as transmission lines<br>
to transport energy between the chip bonding pads 152 and the lead frame. Therefore, the<br><br>
invention is not limited to the use of bondwires and other types of transmission lines, such<br>
as microstrip lines and coplanar waveguide lines may be used instead of or in addition to<br>
bondwires. Accordingly, although for clarity the following discussion will refer primarily<br>
to bondwires, it is to be understood that the principles discussed apply equally to other<br>
types of transmission lines.<br>
The bondwire(s) 150 may be coupled with a tuning circuit that may include the<br>
fixed and variable capacitances that form part of the resonant circuit of FIG. 2. Referring<br>
to FIG. 5, there is illustrated a circuit diagram representing a lumped element model of<br>
the distributed nature of the LC tank circuit depicted in FIG. 2 and in FIGS. 3 and 4.<br>
Essentially, the bondwires 150 act like transmission lines that are terminated at a source-<br>
side 176 by capacitors of the tuning circuit 154, and at a load-side 178 are coupled either<br>
to one another or to ground via a small inductance LpCb that arises from the semiconductor<br>
substrate material. At a particular frequency, the transmission lines which represent the<br>
bondwires 150, can be approximated as a reactance with a fixed inductance Lbw- This is<br>
the inductance used to implement the fixed inductor 134 in the resonant circuit 132 of<br>
FIG. 2. Furthermore, the bonding pads 152 are plates with respect to the ground plane<br>
and thus act as parasitic capacitors Cstray and Cpad. It is to be appreciated that when<br>
selecting the fixed capacitors CI, C2, C3 and variable capacitors Cv in the tuning circuit<br>
154 to achieve a desired resonance, these parasitic capacitors Cstray and Cpad should be<br>
accounted for.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 2, according to one embodiment, the tuning circuit 154<br>
includes two tunable capacitive elements 136, 138. In one embodiment, as illustrated in<br>
FIG. 5, the first tunable capacitive element 136 may comprise a switchable bank of fixed<br>
capacitors 156 (C1, C2, C3) and the second capacitive element 138 may comprise one or<br>
more variable capacitors 158a, 158b. The fixed and variable capacitors serve a dual<br>
purpose, namely selection of a particular resonance center frequency (for example, for the<br>
band selection of a multi-protocol cellular telephone standard), and compensation for<br>
fabrication process variations. Although the use of either fixed or variable capacitors is<br>
possible, both are provided in at least one embodiment of the invention to maximize<br>
flexibility and allow for both course and fine tuning over wide frequency ranges.<br>
According to one embodiment, the switchable bank of fixed capacitors 156 may<br>
comprise a plurality of MOS (metal oxide semiconductor) or MIM (metal-insulator-<br><br>
metal) capacitor banks that may be electronically switched by the control signals 144 (see<br>
FIG. 2). It is to be appreciated that any type of fixed capacitor may be used, however,<br>
MOS or MIM capacitors are common to CMOS and other semiconductor integrated<br>
circuits and may therefore be used in one preferred embodiment. The resonant frequency<br>
of the resonant circuit 132 may be adjusted or tuned over a wide range by switching in<br>
and/or out one or more of the MOS capacitor banks. These fixed capacitors may have<br>
relatively large capacitances, for example, on the order of tens of Pico farads and may<br>
therefore be used to provide course tuning, for example, to select the frequency band of<br>
operation (e.g., 800 MHz, 1900 MHz, 2400 MHz, etc.). Fine tuning of the resonance<br>
circuit may be accomplished by controlling the capacitance of the variable capacitors)<br>
158. In one embodiment, the variable capacitor(s) 158 may be implemented using one or<br>
more varactor diodes whose capacitance can be adjusted through a variable control<br>
voltage. Specifically, for a varactor diode, the junction capacitance is dependent on the<br>
reverse bias voltage VR according to the formula:<br><br>
where C(VR) is the junction capacitance, CJ0 is the junction capacitance under a zero volt<br>
bias voltage, vyo is the so-called "built-in potential", which may be approximately 0.5V,<br>
and n is a technology parameter (dependent on the semiconductor fabrication technology)<br>
that may be approximately equal to 0.5. Generally, the bias voltage VR may be tunable<br>
from approximately 0 - 1.5V, depending on semiconductor fabrication technology.<br>
Therefore, the capacitance values of the varactor diodes may be normally below about<br>
IpF, and the varactors are thus suitable for fine tuning the overall capacitance of the<br>
resonant circuit 132. In one example, one or more banks of varactor diodes may be used<br>
to fine tune the resonant frequency of the resonance circuit over a range of several<br>
megahertz in a band more coarsely selected by switching in and out of the fixed capacitor<br>
bank(s). In addition, different varactor diodes may possess different zero bias junction<br>
capacitance values and thus further flexibility in tuning may be accomplished by creating<br>
one or more banks of varactor diodes with different zero bias junction capacitances.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, there is illustrated an exemplary graph of resonance<br>
frequency as a function of applied bias voltage VR for a simulation of the resonance<br>
circuit of FIG. 5. As additional fixed capacitors are switched in to the circuit of FIG. 5,<br><br>
FIG. 6 illustrates that the resonance frequency decreases for the same bias voltage on the<br>
varactor diodes. Thus, as illustrated in FIG. 6, course tuning (e.g., frequency band<br>
selection) may be accomplished by switching in/out one or more fixed capacitors. For a<br>
given selection of fixed capacitors (e.g., slope CI), FIG.6 illustrates that varying the bias<br>
voltage VR changes the resonant frequency by a small amount, and can therefore be used<br>
for fine tuning within a selected frequency band.<br>
Referring to FIG. 31, there is illustrated another embodiment of a resonant circuit<br>
346 incorporating two bondwire inductors 348. Switches 350 may allow the bondwire<br>
inductors 348 to be coupled to additional bondwires, thereby adjusting the total<br>
inductance in the resonant circuit 346. Further switches 352 may allow the addition of<br>
capacitors 354 and varactor diodes 356 into the resonant circuit for the purpose of<br>
augmenting the inductive reactances of the bondwires 348 with capacitive reactances. In<br>
one embodiment, the switches 350 and/or 352 may be implemented using two MOS<br>
transistors 358a, 358b, as shown in FIG. 32. A digital signal BO and its logical inverse<br>
BO may allow for current flow or no current flow respectively by controlling the voltage<br>
provided by the digital signal BO to exceed the threshold voltage of the MOS transistors.<br>
The value of the digital voltage signal BO may be supplied, for example, by the<br>
microcontroller 108 over the programming bus 110. As discussed further below, a<br>
voltage signal may be supplied from, for example, the BITE module 106 (see FIG. 1), to<br>
tune the reactance of the varactor diode(s). It is to be appreciated that the resonant circuit<br>
illustrated in FIG. 31 may be coupled in either series or parallel to, for example, the<br>
resonant circuit of FIG. 5. In addition, the additional capacitors and varactor diodes could<br>
be configured with one another in shunt or in series.<br>
Thus, tuning of the resonant frequency of the resonant circuit 132 may be<br>
accomplished by switching in and/or out one or more individual or banks of fixed-value<br>
capacitors (e.g., MOS or MIM capacitors) for course tuning (e.g., band selection) and<br>
changing the bias voltage of the one or more varactor diode(s) for fine tuning. Fine<br>
tuning may be used not only to select a particular desired center frequency within a band,<br>
but also to compensate for temperature variation, manufacturing differences in the<br>
inductor values, frequency drift (e.g., with temperature), etc.<br>
According to some embodiments of the invention, the parasitic inductance<br>
inherent to a low-cost, high-volume, high pin count semiconductor assembly is utilized to<br><br>
replace conventional spiral inductors in resonant circuits on an RFIC. In particular, such<br>
embodiments of the invention exploit the bondwires between the lead frame and the bond<br>
pads of the microelectronic circuit and provide, in conjunction with fixed and variable<br>
capacitors, a high quality factor (Q) resonance circuit without the use of spiral inductors.<br>
The Q of a circuit, defined as the ratio of stored energy in the resonance circuit to the<br>
dissipated energy from the resonance circuit, is enhanced when the parasitic resistance in<br>
an inductor-capacitor (LC) loop circuit is reduced. Typically, Q values above 20, under<br>
loaded circuit conditions, are considered high. The Q of an element may be affected by<br>
the element's resistance because higher resistance may tend to result in more dissipated<br>
energy. Like conventional single or dual layer integrated spiral inductors, bondwires<br>
exhibit low resistance, generally less than 25 mΩ per mm. As discussed above,<br>
bondwires 150 also have a reactance (inductance) that is dependent on various<br>
parameters, such as length, cross-section and mutual coupling with adjacent wires, and is<br>
also variable with frequency. Referring to FIG. 9, there is illustrated a graph of simulated<br>
input impedance of a bondwire as a function of frequency over a range of 0.8 GHz to 2.4<br>
GHz. As shown in FIG, 9, the resistance (indicated by line 182) is small and fairly<br>
constant with frequency. The reactance (indicated by line 184) increases with increasing<br>
frequency.<br>
Bondwires generally display an unloaded Q of about 30-60. Referring to FIG. 10,<br>
there is illustrated a graph of simulated unloaded Q as a function of frequency over a<br>
range of 0.8 GHz to 2.4 GHz, for one embodiment of a bondwire 150. The unloaded Q is<br>
calculated as the ratio of the imaginary part of the input impedance of the bondwire (i.e.,<br>
the reactance 184) to the real part of the input impedance of the bondwire (i.e., resistance<br>
182), as shown in the formula below:<br><br>
As shown in FIG. 10, the unloaded Q for the bondwire increases with frequency and may<br>
easily exceed 40 at 3.5 GHz (based on extrapolation). Varactor diodes generally have an<br>
unloaded Q of less than 200, however, the Q can be improved by parallel connecting<br>
several varactor diodes. The overall loaded Q of the resonance circuit may be controlled<br>
by including a resistor 160 in parallel with the inductor and capacitors, as illustrated in<br>
FIG. 2. The Q may be tuned over a wide range by making this parallel resistor<br><br>
programmable. For example, the resistor 160 may be programmable via the control<br>
signals 144 (see FIG. 2).<br>
One advantage of bondwire inductors over conventional spiral inductors is that<br>
bondwire inductors do not take up large chip areas. Also, because the bondwires are<br>
external to the integrated circuit chip 146, little electromagnetic field interference or<br>
coupling into the chip area is induced. However, a disadvantage is that the self-<br>
inductance of the bondwires may vary largely, for example, up to about 30% between<br>
different fabrications, due to process variations such as wire length 162, wire height 164<br>
(see FIG. 4), soldering condition variations, etc. However, this disadvantage may be<br>
mitigated in the resonance circuit of the invention because inductance variations can be<br>
compensated for by a change in either or both of the fixed capacitances (e.g., the MOS<br>
capacitors and/or MIM capacitors) and the variable capacitance (e.g., the varactor<br>
diodes).<br>
As discussed above, there have been attempts to develop narrow-band tuning<br>
circuits that incorporate bondwire inductors. However, in contrast to the prior art, the<br>
unique resonant circuit according to various embodiments of the present invention both<br>
includes a bondwire (or other transmission line) inductor to replace conventional spiral<br>
inductors and makes use of a plurality of fixed capacitors and variable capacitors<br>
controlled by control signals to achieve wideband tuning. Control signals are used to set<br>
a resonant frequency of the resonant circuit by controlling banks of switchable capacitors<br>
and by selecting the number of varactor diodes used in the resonant. In addition, further<br>
control signals are used to set the bias voltage applied to the varactor diodes to achieve<br>
fine tuning and to account for variance in the bondwire inductance due to manufacturing<br>
variability. In addition, closed-loop feedback control may be used to dynamically<br>
compensate for changing operating conditions and to enable automatic programmability<br>
of the resonant frequency range of the resonance circuit, as discussed in detail below.<br>
In many applications, the tunable resonance circuit 132 (see FIG. 2) is coupled to<br>
other circuits, such as, for example, a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO), a low noise<br>
amplifier, a baseband amplifier, and others. Such coupling may be facilitated via tunable<br>
coupling capacitors in order to establish appropriate matching conditions. Referring to<br>
FIG. 2, the first node 140 and the second node 142 of the LC tank circuit 132 can be<br>
coupled to an external circuit, for example, a VCO, via coupling capacitors 166. These<br><br>
coupling capacitors separate the RF path from the DC bias for the varactor diodes and the<br>
VCO. According to one embodiment, the coupling capacitors 166 may be variable (i.e.<br>
having a tunable capacitance value) so as to vary the input impedance of the LC circuit at<br>
a given frequency, thereby improving matching of the LC circuit to the external circuit<br>
(e.g., the VCO). Good matching may be advantageous because it facilitates efficient<br>
power transfer from one circuit to another and improves the overall power efficiency of<br>
the RFIC. As an example, an advantage of one embodiment of the invention is that by<br>
coupling the LC tank circuit to, for example, a VCO, the tuning range and frequency band<br>
of the VCO can be controlled by controlling the resonance of the LC tank circuit.<br>
To further facilitate integration of the tunable resonance circuit 132 with other<br>
analog functional circuits, such as a VCO, a control unit can be employed that enables<br>
automatic resonance frequency selection and fine tuning with a circuit comprising a<br>
microcontroller and a phase lock loop (PLL) circuit. A block diagram of one example of<br>
such a control circuit is illustrated in FIG. 7. As discussed above, a particular frequency<br>
band of operation may be selected by switching in and/or out a particular number of<br>
fixed-value capacitors. According to one embodiment, band selection may be controlled<br>
by a control signal on line 180 from the microcontroller 108. The microcontroller may<br>
receive an input (e.g., via the interface 112 - see FIG. 1) that identifies a desired<br>
operating frequency band. Based on the selected frequency band of operation, the<br>
microcontroller 108 may determine the number of fixed and variable capacitors and send<br>
control signals to the switches 168 to switch in appropriate ones or banks of fixed-value<br>
capacitors and variable capacitors (e.g., varactor diodes). The microcontroller may<br>
further control a bias voltage of the varactor diode(s) to narrow, or more accurately<br>
define, the operating frequency range, as discussed above. The decoder 170 in FIG. 7<br>
converts the digital signals from the microcontroller to analog control signals to operate<br>
the switches 168 and adjust the bias voltages of the varactor diodes. Thus, the<br>
microcontroller enables programmable frequency selection by controlling the capacitance<br>
that is coupled in parallel with the fixed bondwire inductance to select a desired resonant<br>
frequency.<br>
According to one embodiment, compensation for operating fluctuations (e.g.,<br>
temperature drift) may be implemented using feedback control with the built-in test and<br>
evaluation (BITE) module 106, as discussed in detail below. In particular, the BITE<br><br>
module 106 may monitor and correct for frequency deviations and operational drifts<br>
based on an in-situ calibration scheme. In one example, dynamic adjustment of the bias<br>
voltage for the varactors to stabilize the chosen frequency against environmental<br>
fluctuations (temperature, humidity, etc.) as well as operational fluctuations (power<br>
fluctuations) is implemented by a standard phase-lock-loop (PLL) circuit 172 that<br>
generates the correction voltage based on an error signal from the microcontroller 108.<br>
The closed-loop feedback control methods implemented by the BITE module 106 for<br>
calibration and dynamic compensation for variable operating conditions is discussed in<br>
further detail below.<br>
As discussed above, according to one embodiment, the LC tank circuit of the<br>
invention may be coupled to a low noise amplifier (LNA). Low noise amplifiers are<br>
commonly used in radio transceivers to amplify a received RF signal so as to improve the<br>
signal to noise ratio of the received signal to facilitate processing of the signal. To<br>
facilitate signal transfer through the LNA, it is important to provide impedance matching<br>
to the components to which the LNA is connected. Impedance matching, typically to a<br>
source impedance of 50 Ohms, may be particularly important for integrated high<br>
performance multi-band LNAs and may be needed over a wide frequency band.<br>
Referring to FIG. 12, there is illustrated a circuit diagram of one embodiment of<br>
matching an RF source 192 to the input of a transistor-based circuit using an LC tank<br>
circuit 190. The MOS transistors Ml and M2 may form part of an LNA 116 to which the<br>
RF source 192 is being matched using the LC tank circuit 190. FIG. 12 illustrates an<br>
inductively degenerated common source cascade CMOS configuration where the LC tank<br>
circuit 190 is part of the input to the gate of the MOS transistor Ml. It should be<br>
appreciated that other LNA configurations may be used and the principles of the<br>
invention are not limited to the example shown in FIG. 12. It is to be appreciates that the<br>
LC tank circuit 190 may comprise one or more bondwire inductors and any of the<br>
elements discussed above in reference to FIGS. 2-5. Ports Vdc1 and Vdc2 provide a DC<br>
bias voltage for the transistors M1 and M2, respectively. The resistance Rd may be a<br>
current-limiting resistance that is coupled between the transistors and a drain voltage<br>
supply, Vdd.<br>
For the configuration illustrated in FIG. 12, the input impedance seen by the RF<br>
source (i.e., at node 278) can be expressed as<br><br><br>
where Zin is the input impedance, Ls is the source degenerated inductance, gm1 is<br>
the transconductance of transistor Ml, Cgs1 is the total gate-source capacitance of M1, ω<br>
is the angular frequency, and X is the reactance provided by the LC tank circuit 190. In<br>
one example, for a 180 nm node size CMOS process, the source degenerated inductance<br>
may be approximately 0.5 nH to InH, the transconductance may be in a range from about<br>
30 mS to 100 mS, and the gate-source capacitance may be in a range from about 0.7 pF to<br>
1.5pF. It is to be appreciated that although these values may be typical for a 180nm node<br>
size CMOS process, similar values can be found for other technology node sizes. In<br>
addition, the RF source 192 may typically have a 50 Ohm impedance and thus it may be<br>
desirable to match the input impedance Zm may approximate 50 Ohms.<br>
In one example, matching to a 50 Ohm source impedance may be achieved if the<br>
following conditions are met:<br><br>
In other words, the reactance of the LC tank circuit, including a bondwire inductor<br>
configuration, may be controlled to approximately cancel out the reactance of the<br>
transistor circuit (the series combination of the source degenerated inductance and the<br>
total gate-source capacitance) at the target frequency.<br>
Some examples of common target frequencies for an integrated RFIC comprising<br>
elements of the invention may include 1.9 GHz for Digital Enhanced Cordless Telephone<br>
(DECT) and 2.4 GHz for Bluetooth applications. Considering one DECT example, a 50<br>
Ohm input impedance match may be provided for a 1.9 GHz DECT application where Ls<br>
= 0.57 nH and Cgs1 = 1.332 pF, by controlling the reactance to be X = 112.68 Ohms. In<br>
another example, a 50 Ohm input impedance match may be provided for a 2.4 GHz<br>
Bluetooth standard having Ls = 1.2 nH and Cgs1 = 0.703 pF by controlling the reactance of<br>
the LC tank circuit to be X = 208.3 Ohms. In a similar way, matching for other standards,<br>
like GSM and CDMA, can also be implemented.<br><br>
As discussed above with reference to FIGS. 5 and 11, target reactance values for<br>
the LC tank circuit may be implemented by cascading bondwires 150 and by varying<br>
capacitances 156, 158 and 188. In addition, as discussed above with reference to FIG. 9,<br>
the reactance may vary with frequency, as shown by curve 184 and may be augmented by<br>
fixed and variable capacitance such that the target reactance of X is reached.<br>
According to another embodiment, the LC tank circuit including a bondwire<br>
inductor configuration may be coupled to a differential stage low noise amplifier and may<br>
be used to match the input impedance of a differential LNA to, for example, a 50 Ohm or<br>
100 Ohm RF source (RFin+ and RFin. in FIG. 13). Referring to FIG. 13, there is illustrated<br>
one example of a balanced LNA including inductive series feedback (provided by L2, L3,<br>
L4 and L5) and using p-type and n-type MOS transistors 194a, 194b, 194c and 194d. As<br>
shown in FIG. 13, a differential balanced input stage with current sources controlled by<br>
voltages VBP and VBN may be used. Such a circuit may be implemented, for example, in a<br>
0.35 nm CMOS process. It is to be appreciated that the principles of the invention are not<br>
limited to the exemplary LNA configuration illustrated in FIG. 13 and other types of<br>
transistors and configurations may be used. In addition, other node size CMOS processes<br>
may be also used.<br>
In conventional integrated differential LNAs, the inductors L1-L6 may be<br>
implemented as spiral inductors which may have several associated disadvantages, as<br>
discussed above. According to one embodiment of the invention, any or all of the<br>
inductors LI -L6 may be implemented using bondwires, or other types of transmission<br>
lines, as discussed above. Referring to FIG. 14, there is illustrated one example of a<br>
bondwire inductor configuration for the circuit of FIG. 13. Each of the inductors LI -L6<br>
may comprise one or bondwires connected at each end to a bonding pad 152, as discussed<br>
above. The capacitors 196 represent the capacitance presented by the bonding pads. In<br>
one example, the shorts 199 connecting the bonding pads 152 on the lead frame together<br>
may be replaced by fixed or variable capacitors. In addition, on the chip side, the<br>
connections to the bond wires could also include either fixed or variable (or both)<br>
capacitors. These capacitors may be used to achieve particular reactance values so as to<br>
optimize the overall circuit performance at a specific operating frequency or band of<br>
operating frequencies, and/or to provide input impedance matching between the<br>
differential amplifier and the RF input port, as discussed above.<br><br>
It is to be appreciated that the various embodiments of the programmable LC tank<br>
circuit as described herein can be coupled to various RF components of the configurable<br>
RFIC of FIG. 1 to achieve programmable tuning of these components, and so as to tune<br>
the overall RFIC to a desired operating frequency band.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 1, according to at least one embodiment, an integrated<br>
radio transceiver chip may include a frequency synthesizer 104 that is adapted to generate<br>
one or more reference frequencies for use by various components in the RFIC. More<br>
specifically, according to one embodiment, there may be provided a programmable<br>
frequency synthesizer that may generate a wide range of stable frequencies so as to enable<br>
operation of a multi-band, multi-standard radio transceiver. In one embodiment, the<br>
frequency synthesizer employs a wide band local oscillator architecture that comprises a<br>
narrowband VCO combined with a programmable divider to generate local oscillator<br>
signals for the radio transceiver, as discussed in detail below. A wide range of stable<br>
local oscillator frequencies are desirable for a multi-band, multi-standard radio<br>
transceiver. However, having a large number of VCOs and/or reference signal sources<br>
(e.g., reference crystals) may require a large chip surface area and increase the cost of the<br>
radio transceiver due to larger size and increased component count. Therefore, it may be<br>
desirable to minimize the number of VCOs and reference sources in order to obtain a high<br>
degree of integration and high performance for an RFIC.<br>
Referring to FIG. 15, there is illustrated a block diagram of one embodiment of a<br>
frequency synthesizer 104 according to aspects of the invention, The frequency<br>
synthesizer 104 implements a wide band programmable local oscillator (LO) architecture<br>
and is based on a modified direct digital synthesis phase lock loop (PLL) that incorporates<br>
single or multiple digital band switching dividers inside a forward loop path 202 so as to<br>
provide flexibility in generating a large number of stable reference frequencies. As<br>
shown in FIG. 15, the frequency synthesizer 104 may include a voltage controlled<br>
oscillator (VCO) 198 coupled to a programmable LC tank circuit 200 such as described<br>
above. The programmable LC tank circuit 200 allows resonant frequency band selection<br>
of the LC tank circuit, as discussed above, and can be used to control a tuning range of<br>
the VCO 198. In one example, the VCO may have a tuning range of up to ±20% about a<br>
center frequency that can be set, for example, in a range between about 1GHz and 3GHz.<br>
A reference frequency source 204 provides a reference frequency fref to the synthesizer<br><br>
loop via a phase detector 228 and a loop filter 230. The programmable frequency<br>
synthesizer may further comprise a programmable divide-by-N circuit 232 and a mixer<br>
234 in the forward loop 202, an upper or lower sideband selection filter 236, and a divide-<br>
by-M circuit 238 in the feedback loop, each of which are discussed in more detail below.<br>
In one embodiment, a narrowband signal fvco (provided by the VCO in combination with<br>
the LC tank circuit) may be mixed with an N divided version of itself in either a single-<br>
sideband or double-sideband modulator 234. The result of the mixing yields an upper<br>
sideband and a lower sideband which may provide a local oscillator signal on both sides<br>
of the VCO frequency, fvco- Each of these sidebands may have the same percentage<br>
bandwidth as the VCO signal, thus providing a wide range of frequency coverage that is a<br>
function of both the VCO bandwidth and the division ratio.<br>
According to one embodiment, the reference frequency signal source 204 may<br>
include a direct digital synthesizer (DDS) that derives its reference frequency from a<br>
crystal source and generates the reference frequencies. For example, for a multiple<br>
standard radio transceiver, some desirable reference frequencies may include 13 MHz, 26<br>
MHz, 19.2 MHz, 19.6 MHz, 20 MHz, 22 MHz, 40 MHz, and 44 MHz. Of course, it is to<br>
be appreciated that many other reference frequency values may also be generated and the<br>
invention is not limited to the examples given above. One embodiment of a reference<br>
frequency source 204 according to aspects of the invention is illustrated (in block diagram<br>
form) in FIG. 16. A numerically controlled crystal oscillator 206 generates an output<br>
signal on line 208 that is fed to a direct digital synthesis (DDS) circuit 210. The crystal<br>
oscillator 206 may include a crystal 212 attached to an oscillator 214 and controlled via<br>
one or more variable capacitors 216. The DDS circuit 210 receives the signal from the<br>
crystal oscillator 206 on line 208. The DDS circuit 210 also receives a digital<br>
programming signal from, for example, the RFIC microcontroller (see FIG. 1). The<br>
programming signal may indicate to the DDS circuit the desired frequency value of the<br>
reference frequency to be generated. Based on the programming signal 218, the DDS<br>
circuit produces (from the signal on line 208) a digital reference frequency signal. The<br>
DDS also includes a digital-to-analog converter (DAC, not shown) that produces a<br>
sampled analog carrier on line 220. In one example, the DAC is sampled at a reference<br>
clock frequency determined from a clock signal 222. Therefore, a low pass filter (LPF)<br>
224 may be used to eliminate aliasing if necessary. The generated reference frequency fraf<br><br>
is produced on line 226. In one example, the DDS circuit can be implemented in a field<br>
programmable gate array (FPGA).<br>
According to one embodiment, multiple reference frequencies, which may in turn<br>
be used to create multiple local oscillator signals, may be generated using a single crystal<br>
212 that has a fixed output frequency value and thus has good stability performance. The<br>
frequency synthesizer architecture of the invention uses the reference frequency source<br>
described above to produce multiple reference frequencies. Each reference signal may<br>
retain the stability of the original crystal signal, which may be very desirable for radio<br>
transceiver applications.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 15, the VCO 198, as tuned by the LC tank circuit 200,<br>
produces a signal having a frequency fvc0, as shown. The frequency fvc0 is modified by<br>
the divide-by-N circuit 232 and mixer 234 such that a spectrum of fVCo + fvco /N(the<br>
upper side band) and fvc0 - fvco /N (the lower side band) is generated. A subsequent<br>
sideband selection filter 236 may select one of the bands which becomes fout- The<br>
sideband selection filter may significantly extend the frequency coverage of the local<br>
oscillator provided by the frequency synthesizer because the sideband selection filter<br>
allows the local oscillator to have a frequency range that is substantially distant from the<br>
original VCO frequency. Stability of the generated frequencies may be maintained by<br>
feeding back the output signal foul through the divide-by-M circuit 238 into the phase<br>
detector 228. The phase detector may compare the selected sideband signal ((fvc0 ± fvco<br>
/N)/M) with the reference frequency signal generated by the reference frequency source<br>
204 to generate a loop signal on line 240 that may be conditioned through a low pass<br>
filter 230 before being applied to the VCO 198. In this manner, the VCO may be<br>
adjusted to accurately maintain a desired signal frequency. In one example, the phase<br>
detector 228 may be implemented as a standard charge pump circuit.<br>
According to one embodiment, the programmable divide-by-N circuit (where N is<br>
a programmable high speed feed-forward divider ratio) may be implemented as a single<br>
divider or as a combination of dividers. Furthermore, the programmable divide-by-N<br>
circuit 232 may be implemented in conjunction with a single output VCO or a quadrature<br>
output VCO (QVCO),<br>
Referring to FIG. 17, there is illustrated one embodiment of a portion of the<br>
forward loop 202 including the divide-by-N circuit. In the illustrated example, the<br><br>
generated frequency fvc0 is fed into a standard buffer 242 followed by a shunt<br>
configuration of a fixed divide-by-2 circuit 244 and the programmable divide-by-N<br>
circuit 232. The value of N may be an integer or a non-integer and may be determined by<br>
a control signal from, for example, the RFIC microcontroller (see FIG. 1). The output<br>
signals of the fixed divide-by-2 circuit 244 are the frequency components Ii which is the<br>
"in-phase" signal and Qi which is the quadrature signal and which is 90 degrees out of<br>
phase with I|. The output of the programmable divide-by-N circuit 232 similarly includes<br>
an in-phase frequency component signal 12 and a quadrature component signal Q2. These<br>
four signals may be provided to a lower sideband selection circuit and to an upper<br>
sideband selection circuit 248 which may form part of the sideband selection filter 236<br>
(see FIG. 15). The output of the lower sideband selection circuit includes the lower side<br>
band (LSB) frequencies, and the output of the upper sideband selection circuit 248<br>
includes the upper side band (USB) frequencies. As shown in FIG. 17, the USB and LSB<br>
frequencies may be fed to a multiplexer 250 that may be adapted to allow the selection of<br>
either the USB or the LSB frequency signals, depending on the setting of a digital control<br>
signal on line 252. For example, setting the digital control signal to a "0" may select the<br>
LSB signal whereas setting the digital control signal to a "1" may select the USB signal,<br>
or vice versa. The multiplexer may also form part of the sideband selection filter 236.<br>
According to another embodiment, the VCO may be a quadrature VCO 254, as<br>
illustrated in FIG. 18. The quadrature VCO 254 may generate an in-phase signal It (for<br>
example, a cosine signal cos(coit) where coi is the angular frequency of input frequency<br>
fvc0) and a quadrature signal Q, (for example, a sine signal, sin(coit)). One example of<br>
circuit implementations for the lower sideband selection circuit and upper sideband<br>
selection circuit are illustrated in FIGS. 19a and 19b, respectively. Both circuits comprise<br>
the same functional blocks, namely a first mixer 256, a second mixer 258 and a summer<br>
260. For the lower sideband selection circuit, signals II and 12 are applied to the first<br>
mixer 256 and signals Ql and Q2 are applied to the second mixer 258, whereas for upper<br>
sideband selection circuit signals II and Q2 are applied to the first mixer and signals Ql<br>
and 12 are supplied to the second mixer.<br>
For an exemplary explanation of the operation of the sideband selection circuits,<br>
the signals can be assumed to be: Ii = cos(coit), h = cos(a&gt;2t), Qi = sin(wit), Q2 = sin(co2t).<br>
Then, from the circuit configuration in FIG. 19a, the lower sideband output is:<br><br>
LSB = I, *l2 + Q, *Q2 = cos[(co,-ffl2)t]<br>
Similarly, from the circuit configuration of FIG. 19b, the upper sideband output is:<br>
USB = i!*Q2 + Q,*I2 = cos^coj+co^t]<br>
Thus, by selecting one of the USB and LSB, a local oscillator signal is provided<br>
that may be either close in frequency or substantially distant in frequency from the<br>
original VCO frequency, depending on the values of coi and co2. The sideband selection<br>
filter may thus offer great flexibility in the local oscillator frequency range, providing a<br>
wideband local oscillator. The frequency synthesizer according to aspects of the<br>
invention thus allows the generation of an extremely wideband local oscillator signal<br>
from a relatively narrowband crystal reference frequency. Many radio transceiver<br>
applications require a low intermediate frequency (low-IF) or direct conversion to<br>
baseband (zero-IF) architecture to minimize noise and losses and enhance performance.<br>
For these types of applications it may be desirable to have a local oscillator output<br>
frequency that is far from and unrelated to (i.e., not a direct multiple of) the fundamental<br>
VCO frequency. This architecture is readily implemented using the frequency<br>
synthesizer of the invention by programming the division ratio and sideband selection<br>
filter to create a local oscillator signal that is distant in frequency from the VCO signal<br>
and is not an integer multiple of the VCO center frequency.<br>
According to one embodiment, the divide-by-N circuit 232 and mixer 234 in the<br>
forward loop 202 may be cascaded to comprise two or more divider and mixer<br>
configurations as shown in FIG. 20. A first stage 262 (comprising a divide-by-N circuit<br>
232 and a mixer 234) may be cascaded with a second stage 264 (also comprising a divide-<br>
by-N circuit 232 and a mixer 234), separated by a band switch 266. Similarly, further<br>
stages may be cascaded so as to achieve any desired division ratio. The second and<br>
subsequent stages may have either the same divider ratio or different divide ratios. The<br>
band switch 266 may be used to select one or more frequencies to be applied to the<br>
subsequent stage(s).<br>
Referring again to FIG. 15, the feedback loop of the phase-locked loop may<br>
comprise a divide-by-M circuit 238, as known in the art. M may be a fixed or<br>
programmable divide ratio. If programmable, the value of M may be set by a control<br>
signal from, for example, the RFIC microcontroller 108 (see FIG. 1). The divide-by-M<br>
circuit 238 may be implemented based on a number of standard divider circuits, including<br><br>
a digitally programmable multistage noise shaping (MASH) Delta-Sigma modulator, as<br>
known in the art. A factor that may be considered in selecting the type of divider may be<br>
the settling time of the divider. For example, for a GSM-900 standard where the<br>
frequency range extends from 880 MHz to 915 MHz and is based on 200 kHz channel<br>
spacing, the settling time may be around 10 \xs.<br>
Some exemplary tuning ranges that may be achieved with various embodiments of<br>
the wide band programmable LO architecture will now be discussed to provide<br>
illustration and examples. However, it is to be appreciated that the inventive principle are<br>
not limited to the specific examples discussed herein and apply broadly to a<br>
programmable LO that may be tuned over a desired frequency range. Table 1 below<br>
shows examples of the center frequency (fcenter), lower bound frequency (fiow) and upper<br>
bound frequency (fhigh) possible with a VCO having a center frequency of 2 GHz and a<br>
tuning range of ± 15%. It is to be appreciated that the center frequency is arbitrary and<br>
simply serves to illustrate the tuning ratio (fhigh/fiow) of the wideband programmable LO<br>
architecture of the invention. Any center frequency may be selected and may be chosen,<br>
for example, based on the application for which the LO is to be used. Different frequency<br>
ranges can easily be achieved by scaling the VCO center frequency. The tuning ratio<br>
remains the same for different center frequencies. N is the division value of the divide-<br>
by-N circuit (see FIG. 15). By changing the value of N, the VCO center frequency may<br>
be scaled as shown.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 21, there is illustrated a graph of the frequency tuning ranges as<br>
a function of the value of N as taken from Table 1. Lines 268a, 268b, 268c and 268d<br>
represent the upper sideband frequency ranges for each value of N from one to eight,<br><br>
respectively, and lines 270a, 270b, 270c, 260d represent the lower sideband frequency<br>
ranges for each value of N from one to eight, respectively. As can be seen from Tablel<br>
and FIG. 21, all but the lowest two frequency ranges (represented by lines 270a and 270b)<br>
overlap and thus a continuous frequency range from about 637.5 MHz to about 2.3 GHz<br>
is available, and other discrete frequency ranges can be provided. FIG. 21 illustrates that<br>
the wide band programmable LO architecture of the invention provides an equivalent to<br>
an oscillator with a center frequency of 1468.75 MHz, and a tuning range of ± 57%. In<br>
other words, the frequency synthesizer of the invention provides a substantially increased<br>
frequency tuning band compared to that of the original VCO (57% overall versus 15% for<br>
the VCO). The frequency synthesizer of the invention may provide a wide-band<br>
programmable LO that may cover almost two octaves in frequency while maintaining the<br>
same tuning sensitivity (because tuning in fact occurs within each narrow band that are<br>
cascaded to provide a synthetic wide band, as shown in FIG. 21), thereby maintaining<br>
good phase noise.<br>
Table 2 below gives example center frequencies, lower bound frequencies and<br>
upper bound frequencies possible with a VCO having a center frequency of 2 GHz and a<br>
tuning range of+/- 20%. The tuning range of the VCO may be adjusted (e.g., changed<br>
from 15% to 20%) using the resonant LC tank circuit, as discussed above. Again, N is<br>
the divider value for the divide-by-N circuit of FIG. 15.<br><br>
FIG. 22 illustrates the frequency bands of Table 2 as a function of N, similar to<br>
FIG. 21. Lines 272a, 272b, 272c and 272d represent the upper sideband frequency ranges<br>
corresponding to each values of N from one to eight, respectively, and lines 274a, 274b,<br>
274c, and 274d represent the lower sideband frequency ranges for each value of N from<br><br>
one to eight, respectively. As shown, by increasing the VCO tuning range to 20% with<br>
the LC tank circuit, continuity of LO frequencies is available from 400 MHz to 2.4 GHz.<br>
These examples illustrate that the frequency synthesizer architecture described<br>
herein is capable of producing a wideband programmable local oscillator that is tunable<br>
over a very wide frequency range. This allows the use of a single LO for a multiple band,<br>
multiple standard radio transceiver because the tuning range of the LO is wide enough to<br>
cover several frequency bands. Tuning sensitivity and phase noise performance are<br>
maintained at levels comparable to narrow band local oscillators because the continuous<br>
wide frequency range is provided by a cascade of several programmable narrow ranges.<br>
Tuning within any one of the narrow bands may be selected by setting the value of N. In<br>
addition, the VCO center frequency and tuning may be adjusted using the LC tank circuit,<br>
as discussed above. This provides additional flexibility in available local oscillator<br>
frequencies.<br>
Referring to FIG. 30, there is illustrated a circuit diagram of one embodiment of<br>
an LC tank circuit 200 deployed in a differential VCO circuit. In the illustrated example,<br>
the differential VCO comprises a cross-coupled MOS transistor pair 332a, 332b,<br>
connected to two varactor diodes 334a, 334b and two LC resonant circuits 200. The<br>
signal from the loop filter 230 (see FIG. 15) is received at input port 336 between the two<br>
varactor diodes 334a, 334b. Transistors 338a and 338b are configured as a current mirror<br>
that sets the bias current for the VCO. The output signal fvc0 (see FIG. 15) is obtained at<br>
the differential outputs VCO+ and VCO- as voltage drops over resistors 340a and 340b,<br>
and transistors 342a and 342b act as buffers on the outputs, as shown in FIG. 15, the<br>
differential voltage signal, at frequency fvco, is the input into the divide-by-N circuit 232.<br>
According to one embodiment, tuning of the VCO circuit 198 is achieved using<br>
the varactor diodes 334a, 334b via a control voltage supplied from the loop filter at input<br>
port 336. In one example, for Vdd = 1.8 volts (V), the varactor diodes 334a, 334b will<br>
start to be forward-biased when the tuning voltage reaches approximately 0.5 V.<br>
However, assuming that the overdrive voltage for the MOS transistors 332a, 332b is<br>
approximately 0.5 V, there is a voltage drop of at least 0.5 V between Vdd and the anodes<br>
(344a, 344b) of the varactors diodes. Thus, the DC voltage at the anodes is<br>
approximately 1.3 V (assuming Vdd = 1.8 V). As a result, the tuning voltage provided<br>
by loop filter 230 at input port 336 may range from 0 V to Vdd (e.g., 1.8V) without<br><br>
forward biasing the varactor diodes 332a, 332b (because the anode voltage is 1.3V and<br>
the diode threshold is 0.5 V). Consequently, varying the tuning voltage does not increase<br>
the VCO gain, and because the varactor diodes are never forward biased, the VCO does<br>
not suffer from phase noise performance degradation.<br>
In one embodiment, the VCO tuning range is controlled by a combination of the<br>
varying the capacitance of the varactor diodes 332a, 332b with the signal from the loop<br>
filter 230, and varying the capacitance of the LC tank circuit. As discussed above, tuning<br>
the capacitance of the varactor diodes 332a, 332b provides fine frequency tuning within a<br>
band. Courser tuning is achieved by switching in and out banks of capacitors in the LC<br>
resonance circuits 200, as discussed above. Therefore, with the appropriate setting of the<br>
LC tank circuits 200, the VCO can have a very wide tuning range of up to about 20%.<br>
As discussed above, the RFIC of FIG. 1 may include a built-in test and evaluation<br>
(BITE) digital analysis and calibration module 106 that enables the setting, monitoring,<br>
and correction of performance parameters such as gain, dynamic range, and selectivity in<br>
an analog receiver chain. According to one embodiment, the BITE module may be an<br>
integrated system component that can be embedded with the radio transceiver chip for<br>
monitoring and calibration of the receiver and/or transmitter chains. As shown in FIG. 1,<br>
the analog front end of an RF transceiver may comprise a number of precisely tuned and<br>
optimized functional blocks including, for example, a low noise amplifier 116, a mixer<br>
280, a bandpass filter 282, a baseband amplifier 284, and an analog-to-digital converter<br>
120. These or similar analog building blocks may typically be found in most receiver<br>
architectures, including heterodyne, iow-IF and zero-IF receivers. When switching from<br>
one operating configuration to another to allow the analog receiver chain to operate in a<br>
different setting (for example, a different cellular phone standard) that requires a different<br>
band of operating frequencies, channel spacing, sensitivity, dynamic range, etc., it can be<br>
important to monitor whether or not the performance characteristics of the receiver and/or<br>
transmitter chain comply with the new telecommunication standard. If deviations are<br>
detected, it is also important to adjust parameters of the receiver chain to bring the system<br>
into compliance with the desired performance requirements. Furthermore, once a<br>
particular setting (for example, a GSM cell phone standard) is selected by the user, it may<br>
be desirable to monitor the parameters of the receiver chain, for example, at certain time<br>
intervals, to detect any deviations from desired performance, and if such deviations are<br><br>
detected, to correct them. It may be particularly, advantageous to be able to monitor<br>
performance parameters and make adjustments during operation of the radio transceiver,<br>
i.e., via an integrated (built-in) monitoring and calibration system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 23, there is illustrated a block, diagram of one embodiment of a<br>
receiver chain of a radio transceiver, including a built-in test and evaluation (BITE)<br>
module 106 to monitor and adjust the functionality of a receiver chain, according to<br>
aspects of the invention. The BITE module may monitor and adjust parameters such as<br>
gain, dynamic range, and selectivity in the receiver chain, a discussed below. In the<br>
illustrated example, the receiver chain comprises an RF input 288, a low noise amplifier<br>
116, a mixer 280, a bandpass filter 282, a baseband amplifier 284 and an analog-to-digital<br>
converter (ADC) 120. Each of these components may be programmable via digital<br>
commands that may be received via the programming bus 110. These digital commands<br>
may specify operating parameters of the components, such as, for example, center<br>
frequency and filter order of the programmable bandpass filter 282, effective number of<br>
bits of the ADC 120, and other parameters as discussed further below. Each component<br>
may include a digital register into which the digital commands may be loaded to set the<br>
operating parameters. The BITE module 106 can be switched into and out of the receiver<br>
chain by a pair of complementary, low-insertion loss switches 290a and 290b. During<br>
normal operation of the receiver chain, an RF signal is received at the RF input 288 and is<br>
processed through the receiver chain to provide a digital output on line 296. When the<br>
BITE module is operational, the switches 290a, 290b disconnect the receiver chain from<br>
the RF input 288 and digital output node 296 and instead couple the receiver chain to the<br>
BITE module 106.<br>
According to one embodiment, for testing, monitoring or calibration of the<br>
receiver chain, a trigger signal may be sent to the BITE module 106 over the digital<br>
programming bus 110 from, for example, the microcontroller 108 (see FIG. 1) to activate<br>
the BITE module. For example, the BITE module chain may begin operation when the<br>
microcontroller issues a command to monitor the analog receiver chain. Alternatively,<br>
the microcontroller may send a command to the system to switch over to a different<br>
standard, for example from GSM to CDMA. In this case, the microcontroller may issue a<br>
command to tune the receiver for a particular center frequency, gain setting, bandwidth,<br>
and linearity, compliant with a selected telecommunication standard. As a result, the<br><br>
BITE module may be activated to check performance of one or more of the components<br>
of either or both of the receiver chain and the transmitter chain of the radio transceiver to<br>
ensure that the transceiver is operating in accordance with the new standard performance<br>
requirements. In both the above examples, the BITE module receives, from the<br>
microcontroller, a specific data word whose content contains the information to set a<br>
particular standard such as GSM, EDGE-GSM, CDMA, etc., as discussed further below.<br>
In addition to activating the BITE module, the microcontroller may send a signal to the<br>
switch 290a to temporarily disconnect the RF input 288 from the receiver chain and<br>
instead allow a test input signal on line 292 to be input to the receiver chain.<br>
Simultaneously (or nearly so), the microcontroller may send a signal to the switch 290b to<br>
temporarily disconnect the digital output node 296 from a subsequent digital baseband<br>
processor interface (e.g., digital baseband processor 124 and digital interface 112 - see<br>
FIG. 1) and instead connect the digital output to the BITE module 106 via line 298.<br>
Referring to FIG. 24, there is illustrated one embodiment of a built-in test and<br>
evaluation (BITE) module according to aspects of the invention. The BITE module 106<br>
may comprise a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) module 300, a data table look-up<br>
module 302, a comparator 304, a macro model 306, a serial to parallel conversion module<br>
308, and optionally a transmitter chain 310 that generates the test input signal to be<br>
applied on line 292. It is to be appreciated that the test signal may either be generated by<br>
a separate transmitter 310 or may be obtained from the transmitter portion of the radio<br>
transceiver architecture (see FIG. 1). The BITE module 106 may be coupled to the<br>
microcontroller 108 via the digital bus 114 (see FIG. 1). In one embodiment, the BITE<br>
module 106 may be implemented with hardwired, embedded logic as available in field<br>
programmable gate array (FPGA) logic, or as part of a cell-based application specific<br>
integrated circuit (ASIC) microelectronic design.<br>
According to one embodiment, a purpose of the BITE module 106 is to generate<br>
suitable test signals that can be used to test the analog receiver chain. These test signals<br>
are dependent on a particular setting, for example, a cell phone standard such as GSM,<br>
EDGE-GSM, CDMA, and the like, and are based on the particular parameter settings of<br>
the individual functional blocks in the receiver chain (e.g., the LNA, bandpass filter, etc.)<br>
that are needed to achieve performance compliance for the selected setting. Some<br>
examples of parameters within the receiver chain blocks that may be tested include: bias<br><br>
voltage or current to set desired power levels and gains, impedance of input and output<br>
matching networks to maintain proper input/output impedance matching between<br>
components for particular operational frequency bands, device sizes of the active devices<br>
to change the operating frequency, and third order input intercept points (IIP3s) to specify<br>
the linearity.<br>
FIG. 28 is a flow diagram illustrating one example of the process steps that the<br>
radio transceiver may go through, including steps the BITE module may implement to<br>
test receiver components, e.g., the LNA 116, when switched to a selected operating<br>
standard. It is to be appreciated that the BITE module may be used to test and/or monitor<br>
any programmable component of the receiver chain and/or transmitter chain of the radio<br>
transceiver. For conciseness, the following discussion will refer primarily to testing of a<br>
component of the receiver chain. However it is to be appreciated that the principles of the<br>
invention and the process steps described apply also to components of the transmitter<br>
chain.<br>
In a first step 320, the radio transceiver may enter an initialization mode. The<br>
purpose of the initialization mode is to configure or program the receiver chain into a<br>
state that represents a best initial "guess" (e.g., based on factory calibration data) as to the<br>
state of the receiver chain desired for operation in the selected receiver setting (e.g.,<br>
CDMA mode, GSM mode, etc.). For example, referring to FIG. 1, the programmable<br>
radio transceiver 101 may receive a command from an external host controller (not<br>
shown) through the interface 112 to configure or re-configure the analog receiver chain<br>
into a selected mode of operation. In response, the integrated microcontroller may load<br>
(e.g., from memory 126) digital register values associated with the selected mode and<br>
clock them onto the programming bus 110 to be transmitted to the components of the<br>
radio transceiver. In one embodiment, the microcontroller may load a digital word<br>
specifying the register values directly to the components of the receiver chain. In another<br>
embodiment, once the BITE module 106 is connected into the analog chain, the BITE<br>
module loads the digital registers, the content of which is communicated via the digital<br>
programming bus 110 to each of the analog blocks, for example, the low noise amplifier<br>
116, the mixer 280, the bandpass filter 282, the baseband amplifier 284, and the ADC<br>
120. The digital word acts as a control signal that may specify operating characteristics<br>
of each analog block in the receiver chain to which it is applied. For example, the digital<br><br>
word may specify a center frequency of the bandpass filter, a gain of the amplifier, etc.<br>
The digital word allows the individual blocks within the receiver chain to set so as to<br>
implement a particular function of the telecommunication standard. In one example, the<br>
contents of the digital word may be specified by the microcontroller 108 or baseband<br>
processor 124. In one embodiment, the memory 126 may store one or more digital words<br>
that specify operating parameters for one or more telecommunication standards. The<br>
microcontroller may access the memory to retrieve an appropriate digital word and<br>
provide it to the BITE module.<br>
As shown in FIG. 23, the BITE module 106 may also be coupled to a digitally<br>
programmable oscillator 314 forming part of the frequency synthesizer 104 (see FIG. 1)<br>
which provides a harmonic output signal having a frequency fout, as shown, for example,<br>
in FIGS. 15-18. According to one embodiment, from initial set of register values<br>
specified by the digital word, the frequency synthesizer 104 may be programmed to a<br>
desired frequency band and may generate a reference frequency signal fref, as discussed<br>
above. The receiver VCO 198 (see FIG. 15) may then be phase locked to the reference<br>
frequency signal frcf (on line 226, see FIG 15) through the use of negative feedback<br>
associated with the phase locked loop operation described in reference to FIGS. 15 and<br>
16. The result of this process is the generation of a precise and desired local oscillator<br>
frequency foul, which may be supplied to the mixer 280 on line 316, as shown in FIG. 23.<br>
In addition to setting the local oscillator frequency for the selected operating<br>
setting, certain parameters of other components of the transceiver may be programmed as<br>
well. For example, digital register values may be communicated (via the programming<br>
bus) to control parameters of the programmable bandpass filter 282 (see FIG. 23), such as<br>
filter order, filter type (e.g., high pass, low pass, or bandpass), filter shape (e.g.,<br>
Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) and center frequency. During initialization, digital<br>
registers of the programmable bandpass filter 282 are loaded with the values associated<br>
with the desired mode of operation. From these initial settings, the center frequency and<br>
filter order values may be adjusted in closed negative feedback loops. For example, the<br>
center frequency may be slaved to the precision master clock 130 (see FIG. 1) and the<br>
filter order value may be slaved to the master impedance 128. The result of this process<br>
is the precise centering of the filter frequency and precise control of the filter order.<br>
Furthermore, the analog to digital converter 120 may also be programmable, and register<br><br>
values may be set to control the sampling rate (Fs) and the effective number of bits<br>
(ENOB) to reflect the values required for the desired mode of operation. It is to be<br>
appreciated that any programming registers in the receiver which are not adjusted by local<br>
negative feedback loops, such as, for example, bias current, input matching circuitry and<br>
load impedances can be set to the initial values stored in memory for the desired mode of<br>
operation.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 28, in a second step 322, the radio transceiver may enter a<br>
test mode in which the BITE module 106 may be activated. The purpose of the test mode<br>
is to synthesize test signals to facilitate testing of, for example, the receiver chain to<br>
determine its actual level of performance. In one embodiment, the BTTE module 106<br>
initiates testing of the receiver chain by applying the test input signal to the input of the<br>
analog receiver chain on line 292. The mixer 280 mixes the signal on line 316 with the<br>
test input signal to translate the frequency content of test signal into a base band<br>
frequency with upper and lower side bands. The bandpass filter 282 may then select a<br>
particular range of frequencies and transfer characteristics such as, for example, ripple<br>
and/or skew, based on the content of the digital word that was supplied to the bandpass<br>
filter by the BITE module 106. The corresponding output of the analog receiver chain,<br>
which is digitized by the ADC 120, is applied to the BITE module on line 298 for<br>
processing. The test input signal may be generated with particular characteristics (e.g.,<br>
frequency, amplitude etc.) such that various performance features of the analog chain<br>
(like gain, frequency, linearity) may be tested. In one embodiment, a digital filter (not<br>
shown) may be placed in line 298 that filters the digital output signal and generates a<br>
monitor signal, for example, at regular or synchronous intervals that are determined by a<br>
clock frequency from the master clock 130 (see FIG. 1).<br>
According to one embodiment, the test signal on line 292 may be generated on the<br>
semiconductor chip by the transmitter 280. Generally, for testing components of the<br>
receiver chain to determine whether their performance complies with a selected<br>
communication standard, the test signal may be generated at the radio frequency of<br>
interest and may be modulated or un-modulated, or may be a continuous wave (CW)<br>
signal. For example, to test for RF center frequency compliance and gain, a CW signal at<br>
and around the desired center frequency may be used.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 33, there is illustrated an example of a phase-locked VCO 366<br>
in combination with a precision reference signal source that may be used to generate a<br>
test signal having a precise RF output frequency. In one example, an input ramp signal<br>
may be generated digitally, for example, by the microcontroller 108 (see FIG. 1), and<br>
applied on line 360 to a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) 120 to be converted to an<br>
analog signal. This analog signal on line 362 may be introduced to the feedback loop 363<br>
via a summer 364. A divide-by-N counter may be programmed, via a signal on the<br>
programming bus 110, to set appropriate values of N to divide the signal from the VCO<br>
366 to generate the desired output frequencies on line 368. A phase detector 228 may<br>
compare the divided output frequency fiest/N with a reference frequency fref on line 226<br>
and generate a difference frequency signal that is filtered by low-pass filter 230 and<br>
applied to the summer 364, as shown in FIG. 33. Generation of the reference frequency<br>
frer was discussed above in reference to FIGS. 15 and 16. The summer 364 combines the<br>
filtered signal from the phase detector 228 and the signal from the DAC 120 to generate a<br>
tuning voltage Vtnae that sets the VCO output frequency. In this manner, a precise test<br>
signal fles, may be generated because the center frequency of the signal ftest may be<br>
precisely controlled by the reference frequency source 204 (see FIG. 15) and the feedback<br>
loop 363.<br>
According to one embodiment, the test signal power level, which may be used for<br>
gain calibration of various transceiver components, may be controlled using a power<br>
control loop as shown in Figure 34. The signal ftest on line 374 may be fed to a variable<br>
gain amplifier 370 which may amplify or attenuate the signal so as to provide a test signal<br>
on line 372 having a particular power level Ptest- The gain applied to the signal on line<br>
374 by the variable gain aimplifier 370 may be controlled by a loop signal that is fed to the<br>
variable gain amplifier on line 376. In the power control loop, the output signal power<br>
level Ptes, may be slaved to a precisely known reference current IREF and reference voltage<br>
VREF via a power detector unit (PDU) 378. The output of the PDU 378 may be fed to one<br>
port of a signal comparator 380, as shown. The signal comparator may also receive a<br>
control signal at its other port from the system microcontroller 108 (not shown). For<br>
example, the microcontroller may send a control signal (which may specify a desired<br>
power level for the signal on line 372), via the programming bus 110, to a digital-to-<br>
analog converter (DAC) 120 which, in rum, applies the control signal to the signal<br><br>
comparator 380. The signal comparator may compare the power level specified by the<br>
control signal and the power level of the signal from the PDU 378 and generate a<br>
difference signal on line 382. This difference signal may be filtered by a low-pass filter<br>
384 and applied to the variable gain amplifier 370 to adjust the gain of the variable gain<br>
amplifier. The resultant test signal 386 (see FIG. 33) may have a precisely controlled<br>
center frequency (from the loop 363) and power level Ptest that are known to within a<br>
specified and acceptable tolerance for the overall transceiver system.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 24, as the BITE module applies a particular test signal to<br>
the input of the analog receiver chain, it monitors simultaneously the output via sampling<br>
of a digital monitoring signal supplied to the BITE module on line 298. When the<br>
synchronously or asynchronously sampled digital data enters the BITE module 106, it is<br>
transformed into the frequency domain via the DFT module 300. This transformation<br>
allows the BITE module to analyze frequency components of the received signal and<br>
compare them to an ideal response signal, as discussed further below. In one<br>
embodiment, the DFT 300 may be implemented, for example, as a 64, 128, 256 or 512<br>
point transform which allows the computation of complex constellation diagrams that<br>
describe, for a particular telecommunication standard, the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q)<br>
components of a received digital signal, as discussed further below.<br>
Once the DFT module 300 has generated the digital output signal DO, it is applied<br>
to the comparator 304. The comparator 304 also receives a digital signal DT from the<br>
data table 302. The digital signal DT represents the ideal response of the receiver chain<br>
to the particular test input signal. In one example, the reference signal DT may be loaded<br>
from the attached memory 126 of the microcontroller 108. The microcontroller, in turn,<br>
may initiate the transfer of the reference signal DT to the BITE module in response to a<br>
command issued from the baseband processor 124 which may specify, for example, the<br>
telecommunication standard for which the receiver chain is being tested. Deviations from<br>
the ideal performance may result in the generation of correction response that is loaded<br>
into a digital register (not illustrated) and communicated to the various analog blocks via<br>
a digital bus, as discussed further below.<br>
As discussed above, a test signal having precisely controlled parameters, such as<br>
center frequency and power levels, can be generated by the transmitter. When this signal<br>
is transformed to the frequency domain, it may have a precisely known frequency<br><br>
characteristic that may be used to evaluate components of the transceiver. Referring to<br>
FIG. 25, there is illustrated one example of a dual tone analog test signal (illustrated in the<br>
frequency domain) that may be generated by the transmitter 310 and supplied to the<br>
analog receiver chain on line 292. The test input signal may comprise two closely spaced<br>
harmonic signals (represented by lines 294a, 294b) that may have the same amplitude Al,<br>
or different amplitudes Al and A2, and are located at frequencies fl and f2. In one<br>
example, the tones 294a, 294b may have a random phase relationship and may be<br>
separated by approximately one channel width for the selected standard of interest. It is<br>
to be appreciated that the test input signal is not limited to the example given in FIG. 25<br>
and may have a different structure. For example, A2 may be smaller rather than larger<br>
than Al. In one example, the test input signal may be generated by transmitter 310 in<br>
response to a digital input supplied by the data table 302, which in turn may receive a<br>
control input from stored data in memory 126 via microcontroller 108 (see FIG. 24). For<br>
example, the test signal may be generated by an in-phase and quadrature single sideband<br>
modulator in the transmitter 310 and may be up-converted to a lower end of the frequency<br>
band to be tested by a phase locked local oscillator that is locked to a particular frequency<br>
referred to herein as f|OW. The resultant test input signal on line 292 may have two main<br>
frequency components, namely f| and f-j, and may be applied via the switch 290a (see<br>
FIG. 23) to the input of the programmabl e receiver chain.<br>
When the test input signal is applied to the receiver chain, it is amplified, mixed,<br>
filtered, and digitized by the components of the receiver chain, as discussed above. This<br>
process may produce an increase in amplitude of the original tones comprising the test<br>
input signal by amplification factors gl and g2 which may determined by the settings of<br>
the analog receiver chain. Referring to FIG. 26, the amplified tones are illustrated by<br>
lines 317a and 317b in the frequency domain. These tones are generated by the DFT<br>
module 300 performing a discrete Fourier transform on the received digitized signal to<br>
transform the sampled signal into the frequency domain and allow analysis of the<br>
frequency components (tones) of the received signal. In addition, due to the third-order<br>
non-linearities present in any receiver components and down-conversion to baseband, the<br>
process may cause generation of additional harmonic signals, for example harmonics of<br>
amplitudes B and C at frequency locations 2ft - f2 and 2fj ~ fi (lines 318a, 318b), as<br>
shown in FIG. 26. The amplitude and frequency locations of these harmonic signals are<br><br>
directly related to the linearity behavior of the entire analog receiver chain. Therefore,<br>
the BITE module can perform an analysis of the analog receiver chain by monitoring the<br>
output of the ADC 120, and its subsequent frequency domain transformation in the DFT<br>
block 300. A detailed comparison between the digital output signal DO and the reference<br>
signal DT, allows an assessment of the receiver chain.<br>
It should be apparent that different test signals with different input frequencies can<br>
be generated based on providing a different digital output from data table 302. As a<br>
result, frequency range, frequency stability, gain and linearity can be tested. Gain at the<br>
lower end of the band may be determined by comparing the power in the tone at fi or f2<br>
with the power in the original tone of the test input signal (adjusted for the gain/loss of<br>
the internal up-con version process). Linearity, in the form of third order intercept point<br>
(IP3) can be determined by calculating the IM3, namely, the difference in power of fi and<br>
2 fi — f2 or f2 and 2f2- fi, and using the relationship:<br>
IP3 (dBm) = A (dBm) + IM3/2(dBc)<br>
where dBm denotes decibels with respect to milliwatts and dBc are decibel of the carrier<br>
frequency, and A is the amplitude in the frequency domain (i.e., power present in tone<br>
294a) of the original test input signal.<br>
Additionally, if fiow is varied in discrete steps over the bandwidth of interest<br>
(beyond some excess bandwidth factor, nominally equal to the expect center frequency<br>
production tolerance of the receiver) and the gain calculation is made at each step,<br>
knowledge of the frequency response is developed. From this frequency response data, a<br>
good estimate of center frequency and bandwidth of the receiver can be made.<br>
According to one embodiment, a more sophisticated testing situation may involve<br>
the generation of a test input signal that includes one or more modulated symbols.<br>
Symbols are unique representations of a particular modulation technique such as<br>
quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), binary phase shift keying (BPSK), etc.<br>
Symbols may be generated in a transmitter, for example, the transmitter 310 of the BITE<br>
module, or the transmitter chain of the RFIC (see FIG. 1). In one example, the symbol(s)<br>
may be generated in response to a digital command provided by, for example, the data<br>
table 302 or microcontroller 108.<br>
In one example, the test signal may be modulated using an in-phase (I) and<br>
quadrature (Q) modulator. The test signal may be amplitude, frequency or phase<br><br>
modulated. In one example, where no information is contained in the amplitude of the<br>
signal (e.g., phase or frequency modulations), a baseband or low frequency, shaped<br>
digital or analog signal may be added into the phase locked loop 363 of FIG. 33, usually<br>
before or after the loop filter 369. In another example, where some information may be<br>
contained in the amplitude of the test signal, an IQ modulator may be used to generate<br>
test signal, as shown in FIG. 35. Referring to FIG. 35, the signal generated by the voltage<br>
controlled oscillator (VCO) 366 may be fed through a 90-degree phase shifter 388 to two<br>
mixers 390q, 390b. A modulation signal may be combined with the phase-shifted VCO<br>
signal in the mixers 390a, 390b. As shown in FIG. 35, an I data stream (of the<br>
modulation signal) may be mixed in mixer 390a and a Q data stream (of the modulation<br>
signal) may be mixed in mixer 390b. The I and Q data streams may be obtained from the<br>
memory 126 (see FIG. 1) under control of the microcontroller 108 (see FIG. 1). The<br>
output signals from the mixers may be combined in a summer 392 to generate the test<br>
signal ftest. In one example, the power level of the signal ftest may be controlled via a<br>
variable gain amplifier 370 as discussed in reference to FIG. 34.<br>
Referring to FIG. 27, there is illustrated one example of a constellation diagram<br>
generated from a simulation of the receiver chain illustrated in FIG. 23. As shown in<br>
FIG. 27, for each transmitted symbol, both I and Q components can be represented as<br>
vectors. Specifically, FIG. 27 depicts two vectors (although it is to be appreciated that the<br>
constellation diagram may comprise a plurality of vectors) representing symbols (S)<br>
identified by integer subscripts n and n+1 and located in the diagram at locations S\n, SQ„<br>
and Sin+i, SQ„+I. The BITE module records the actual signal response via the monitor<br>
signal path 298, subjects the digital data to a discrete Fourier transform operation, and<br>
records a digital output signal DO. This digital output will provide the information I(tn),<br>
Q(tn) and I(tn+i), Q(t„+i), corresponding to the actually received symbols (S) labeled with<br>
subscripts n and n+1, illustrated in FIG. 27.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 28, a next step in the process may be a compare mode<br>
323. The purpose of the compare mode is to determine the amount of error that exists in<br>
the current performance configuration when compared to the desired response. Once the<br>
test mode is completed, the digital output signal (Do) is provided from the DFT module<br>
300 to the comparator 304 to be compared with a reference digital signal DT. The<br>
reference digital signal DT may be stored in the data table 302 and is related to the<br><br>
telecommunication standard of interest. This reference digital signal may include a target<br>
center frequency, a target bandwidth for the signal, a target gain and a target IP3. In<br>
addition to the target values, each parameter may have an acceptable error bar associated<br>
with it. In one embodiment, these values may have been derived from a statistics-based<br>
reference design which implies that overall system performance compliance will occur<br>
when actual values are equal to the target values within the acceptable error bar.<br>
In one embodiment, at each time increment t„, t„+i, the comparator 304 compares<br>
the measured output of the analog chain (DO) against the reference signal (DT) to<br>
generate an error vector magnitude signal EVM. The time increments may be defined,<br>
for example, by the sampling rate of the digital output signal which may be derived from<br>
the master clock frequency. According to one embodiment, the error vector magnitude<br>
(EVM) can be computed for each symbols based, for example, on the so-called "L2"<br>
norm, according to the formulas:<br><br>
However, it is to be appreciated that the invention is not limited to the use of the<br>
L2 norm and other norms can be defined as well. The comparator 304 may monitor the<br>
entire constellation diagram representation of the digital output signal DO provided by the<br>
DFT module 200 and the reference signal DT provided by the data table 302. The<br>
comparator checks for deviations between the signals DO and DT, that is, whether or not<br>
DO = DT within some defined error tolerance threshold. Referring again to FIG. 24, if<br>
the comparator does not encounter a deviation (e.g., DO = DT within some tolerance),<br>
then branch Y is taken, which prompts the serial to parallel conversion circuit 308 to<br>
reissue the content of the digital register that set the performance parameters for the<br>
analog receiver chain. The serial to parallel conversion module converts the serial digital<br>
signal received on line 312 into parallel signal that may be applied to each of the<br>
components in the analog receiver chain via the digital bus 114, as shown in FIG. 23. If<br>
the comparator encounters a deviation, then branch N is taken. In this case, the<br><br>
comparator provides the EVM signal to the macro model 306. In one example, the<br>
compare mode may be complete once the current values and errors have been calculated<br>
for at least one iteration of the test mode and these values have been sent to the macro<br>
model module 306.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 28, a next process step may be a calculate mode 326. The<br>
purpose of the Calculate Mode is to determine the next set of register values to be set<br>
based on the error between the measured and the desired responses. In one embodiment,<br>
the purposes of the calculate mode may be primarily fulfilled by the macro model 306. In<br>
many cases, the receiver chain may have a complex transfer function that may be<br>
modeled (in hardware or software) in order to determine the causes of the effects (e.g.,<br>
deviations) seen in the compare mode. Therefore, the macro model 306 may contain a<br>
model of the receiver chain. In one embodiment, the macro model computes, based on a<br>
mathematical algorithm, adjustments to correct the receiver chain performance. These<br>
adjustments may comprise new values for a digital register, the contents of which may be<br>
issued to the various analog blocks via the serial to parallel conversion module 308,<br>
causing an adjustment of the functionality of one or more of the components in the<br>
receiver chain. In one example, the macro model 306 may be implemented as a finite<br>
state machine.<br>
For example, if a current compare mode test has determined that the center<br>
frequency of the programmable LNA 116 is low by 20%, the macro model 306 may<br>
calculate the digital register values required to switch out some discrete parallel<br>
capacitance of the LC resonant circuit 136 associated with the input matching of the LNA<br>
116 to increase the center frequency of the LNA 116 by 20% according to the well-<br>
known Thompson resonance formula:<br><br>
where L and C are the combined inductance and capacitance, respectively,<br>
presented by the LNA circuitry and the LC resonant circuit.<br>
Alternatively, the center frequency of the LNA 116 may be retuned by decreasing<br>
the total device width used in the LNAs input circuitry by implementing a gate switching<br>
technique. Referring to FIG. 29, there is illustrated one embodiment of the LNA 116<br>
including four interconnected MOS transistors 328a, 328b, 328c and 328d. The LNA 116<br>
also includes four capacitors 330a, 330b, 330c and 330d that isolate the input gate (G) of<br><br>
each MOS transistor from the binary digital inputs BO - B3. The individual gate contacts<br>
G1, G2, G3, G4 are combined via the coupling capacitors to a total gate contact G. In one<br>
example, the coupling capacitors may have a capacitance value of approximately 0.5 pF.<br>
The digital connections BO - B3 couple the programmable digital bus 110 (see FIG. 23)<br>
to the individual gate contacts of the four MOS transistors via resistors RO - R3, as shown<br>
in FIG. 29. In one example, these resistors may have a value of about 3 kf2 each. The<br>
individual drains of each transistor are coupled together to provide an overall drain (D)<br>
contact which provides the output of the LNA 116. The individual source contacts of<br>
each transistor are also coupled together to form an the overall source (S) contact which is<br>
used for setting the appropriate DC bias conditions.<br>
According to one embodiment, each of the four MOS transistors 328a, 328b, 328c<br>
and 328d may have a particular gate width, referred to herein as Wl (for MOS transistor<br>
328a), W2 (for MOS transistor 328b), W3 (for MOS transistor 328c), and W4 (for MOS<br>
transistor 328d). Generally, the gate width dimensions of the transistors may vary over a<br>
wide range depending on the circuit layout and the CMOS process technology used to<br>
fabricate the RFIC. In one example, the gate widths may vary in a range from about 80<br>
microns to about 700 microns. Because the gates of the individual transistors are isolated<br>
(by the capacitors 330a, 330b, 330c and 330d), the digital programming of either a logical<br>
"1" or logical "0" to each of the four binary inputs B0 - B3 may produce an overall<br>
device behavior whose composite gate width can vary to be any of sixteen different sizes.<br>
In one example, the signal voltage levels may be selected such that a logical "0"<br>
on any input B0-B3 implies a voltage below the transistor's threshold voltage, and a<br>
logical "1" implies a voltage above the transistor's threshold voltage. Thus, if a logical<br>
"0" is applied to the individual gate of any transistor 328a-d, its function is turned off,<br>
whereas is a logical "1" is applied to a gate, the corresponding transistor is turned on.<br>
The total gate width for the LNA may be determined by summing the individual gate<br>
widths of each transistor that is turned on. Therefore, depending on the digital bit pattern<br>
that controls the values of B0-B3, the overall gate width can be controlled to any one of<br>
sixteen values, as shown in Table 3 below.<br><br><br>
If each of W1, W2, W3 and W4 are different, Table 3 illustrates how the overall<br>
device width of the LNA can be programmed to be any one of sixteen values. However,<br>
it is to be appreciated that the invention is not limited the example of four transistors with<br>
four gate widths and four digital inputs as shown in the above table. Rather, the<br>
principles of the invention may be applied to any number of transistors and digital input<br>
signals and the gate widths of different transistors may be the same or different.<br>
In addition, referring again to FIG. 29, a current source, 394 may be adjusted<br>
based on the applied digital pattern (and therefore, the number of "on" transistors) such<br>
that an appropriate bias current may be set by summing the individual currents to the<br>
sources of each activated transistor. For example, if bit pattern 1011 is applied, then bias<br>
current corresponding to the sum of the individual bias currents for each of transistors<br>
328a, 328b and 328d may be supplied.<br><br>
As is known to those skilled in the art, by decreasing or increasing the total gate<br>
width, the center frequency of the LNA can be increased or decreased, respectively. The<br>
digital values applied to each of the binary inputs B0-B3 may be controlled by the macro<br>
model to set an appropriate gate width based on a desired center frequency. In addition,<br>
the gain of the programmable LNA 116, and thus of the overall receiver chain can be<br>
adjusted by changing the bias current to the LNA, through a bias control circuit and<br>
through control of the load impedance as shown with the equation:<br>
A = -gm*Z1<br>
where A is the gain, gm is the transconductance and Z1 is the load impedance. As<br>
discussed above, the load impedance may be controlled, for example, through the use of a<br>
programmable LC resonant circuit 136. Controlling the impedance can, in turn, be used<br>
to modify or program the gain of the LNA.<br>
In many cases, the linearity of the LNA 116 can have a large impact on the<br>
linearity of the overall receiver chain. The parameters with the most direct effect on<br>
linearity for a given LNA topology are usually bias current and load line. Referring to<br>
FIG. 27 if, for example, the linearity is low and the gain is high, an adjustment can be<br>
made in both the bias current and the load impedance to find a configuration that will be<br>
sufficient for both conditions. In one embodiment, the degree of linearity and gain can be<br>
assessed, for example, by observing the signal output DO as discussed above with<br>
reference to FIG. 26. The smaller the influence of B and C with respect to g1 A1 and<br>
g2A2, the better the linearity of the LNA. Furthermore, by observing the output signals<br>
g1 A1 and g2A2 in relationship with the input signal strengths A1 and A2, one can<br>
determine the gain gl and g2 at frequencies f1 and f2.<br>
In some embodiments, there may be complex interactions between components<br>
within the receiver chain which may not allow discrete parameter adjustment for each<br>
functional block in the receiver chain. In such cases, the macro model 306 may calculate<br>
a set of register values based on a particular error function and its evolution over time.<br>
This may typically involve an iterative process adjustment process. For example,<br>
referring to FIG. 28, the test mode 322, compare mode 323 and calculate modes 326 may<br>
be repeated until the digital output signal DO is within the defined tolerance of the<br>
reference signal DT.<br><br>
As discussed above, in one embodiment the macro model 306 may be<br>
implemented as a state machine. This provides a high degree of built-in flexibility for<br>
adjustment calculations. For example, factory calibration can be used to generate the<br>
initial register values. In addition, register values can be updated once a real-time<br>
solution is found such that the new values can be used the next time a configuration is<br>
initialized. In other words, the macro model 306 may be capable of a type of learning<br>
process to adapt to the performance of the radio transceiver.<br>
Once the digital output signal matches the reference signal DT within acceptable<br>
tolerances, the BITE module 106 may enter a "hold" mode 327, see FIG. 28. The<br>
purpose of hold mode is to hold the registers at their current values until the<br>
microcontroller (or baseband processor) issues a next command to monitor or to change<br>
to a different telecommunication standard. In addition, the current register values may be<br>
written into the memory 126 as the new initial values to be used next time the initialize<br>
mode is called.<br>
As discussed above, the BITE module 106 may monitor and adjust any or all<br>
of the components of the receiver chain 286, including the LNA 116, the mixer 280,<br>
the bandpass filter 282 and the baseband amplifier 284. It is to be appreciated that a<br>
similar process may apply for any of the other components of the receiver chain and<br>
for any programmable components of the transmitter chain 324 (see FIG. 1). For<br>
example, referring to FIG. 36, there is illustrated a flow diagram of one embodiment<br>
of a method for testing performance parameters of the transmitter chain according to<br>
aspects of the invention. In a first step 396, a particular telecommunication standard<br>
(e.g., CDMA, GSM, etc.) may be selected for which the performance of the<br>
transmitter chain is to be tested. The baseband processor may then generate an<br>
interrupt to the microcontroller to cause the microcontroller to activate a test mode.<br>
The microcontroller 108 (see FIG. 1) may and load initial data values and calibration<br>
settings (step 398) that correspond to the selected mode to one or more components of<br>
the transmitter chain via the programming bus 110 in a manner similar to that<br>
discussed above in reference to the receiver chain. In one example, these initial<br>
values may be obtained from the memory 126. The microcontroller may then activate<br>
the BITE module 106 and begin testing/evaluating one or more components of the<br>
transmitter chain.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 37, there is illustrated a block diagram of one embodiment<br>
of a BITE module 106 coupled to the transmitter chain of the RFIC according to<br>
aspects of the invention. When the microcontroller 108 activates the BITE module<br>
106, a control signal may also be sent to switch 400 to interrupt the normal data<br>
stream Idata and Qdata being sent to the transmitterl02 on lines 402a, 402b, and instead<br>
allow test data (Itest and Qtest) to be sent from the BITE module to the transmitter 102<br>
on lines 404a, 404b, as shown (step 406 in FIG. 36). The test data (Itest and Qtest) may<br>
be generated from information stored in the data table 302 in a manner similar to that<br>
discussed above in reference to generating the test signal to test the receiver chain.<br>
The test data may also be fed to the comparator 304. In one example, the digital test<br>
may be filtered via a low pass filter 408 and mixed with a local oscillator signal fi0 in<br>
mixers 410a, 410b. The local oscillator signal flo may be generated by the frequency<br>
synthesizer 104 as discussed above. The local oscillator signal may also be fed to the<br>
mixers 410a, 410b via a programmable 90-degree phase shifter 412 in order to<br>
generate appropriate in-phase and quadrature signals. These resulting in-phase and<br>
quadrature signals from the outputs of mixers 410a and 410 be may be added together<br>
in a combiner 414 to generate a composite output signal from the transmitter 102.<br>
Under normal operation (i.e., the signals Idata and Qdata are fed to the<br>
transmitter), the output signal from the transmitter 102 would be sent to the antenna<br>
module 174 (see FIG. 1) on line 416. In testing mode, the microcontroller may send a<br>
control signal to a switch 418 to decouple the output of the transmitter from the<br>
antenna and instead cause the output signal from the transmitter (referred to herein as<br>
Smeas because it is a measured signal) to be fed to the BITE module 106 on line 420<br>
(step 426 in FIG. 36). In one example, the output signal from the transmitter may be<br>
amplified by a variable gain amplifier 422, and/or attenuated by a programmable<br>
attenuator 424 before being fed to either the antenna or the BITE module.<br>
According to one embodiment, the signal from the transmitter, Smeas, may be<br>
down-converted by a down-converter 428 in the BITE module to translate the radio<br>
frequency signal to a lower baseband frequency for processing (step 430 in FIG. 36). In<br>
one example, the down-converter 428 may be include a standard mixer, as known to those<br>
skilled in the art. The down-converted signal may then be supplied to the Discrete<br>
Fourier Transform (DFT) module 300 for digital processing. The DFT module 300 may<br><br>
process the received signal and perform a Fourier transform on the signal, as discussed<br>
above in reference to testing the receiver chain, to generate measured digital data streams<br>
Imeas and Qmeas (step 432 in FIG. 36) which represent in-phase and quadrature digital<br>
signal components, respectively. These digital signals Imeas and Qmeas may be fed to<br>
the comparator 304 where they can then be compared against the test data Itest and Qtest<br>
(step 434 in FIG. 36) in a manner similar to that described above in reference to the<br>
receiver chain. If the comparison of the between the measured data Imeas, Qmeas and<br>
the test data (Itest, Qtest) is within an acceptable margin of error, the BITE module may<br>
enter the "hold" mode, as discussed above. In the hold mode the digital registers may be<br>
locked at their current values (step 436 in FIG. 36) until the microcontroller (or baseband<br>
processor) issues a next command to monitor or to change to a different<br>
telecommunication standard. In addition, the current register values may be written into<br>
the memory 126 (step 438 in FIG. 36) as the new initial values to be used the next time<br>
testing is initiated.<br>
If the comparator detects a difference in the digital data, it may initiates the macro<br>
model 306 to execute a software algorithm that computes adjustments, as discussed<br>
above. The macro model may compute new settings for transmitter chain components,<br>
such as, for example, the programmable attenuator 422, the VGA 424, or the frequency<br>
synthesizer 104. The adjustment may result in, for example, a frequency and phase shift<br>
due to a digital input to the programmable frequency synthesizer 104, signal attenuation<br>
due to an input to the programmable attenuator 424, or a variable gain adjustment due to<br>
an input to the programmable VGA 422. In addition, the macro model may signal that<br>
the test data may be re-sent to the transmitter 102 for another iteration of testing (step 440<br>
in FIG. 36).<br>
Having thus described several aspects of at least one embodiment of this<br>
invention, it is to be appreciated various alterations, modifications, and improvements<br>
will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Such and other alterations, modifications,<br>
