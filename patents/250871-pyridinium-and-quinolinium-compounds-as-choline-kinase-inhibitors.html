PYRIDINIUM AND QUINOLINIUM DERIVATIVES<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention generally relates to compounds blocking phosphorylcholine biosynthesis by means of the selective blocking of the choline kinase enzyme in tumor cells or in cells affected by parasitic infection and therefore being applicable in the treatment of tumors and parasitic diseases or diseases produced by viruses, bacteria and fungi in animals including human beings; as well as to a method for preparing the compounds of the invention and certain intermediates of said method. Background of the Invention<br>
Choline kinase is the first enzyme in the Kennedy or phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis pathway and phosphorylates choline to phosphorylcholine (PCho) using adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) as a phosphate group donor [Kent, C. Prog. Lipid Res., 29, 87-105 (1990); Kennedy, E. P. Fed. Proc, 20, 934-940 (1961)]. Ras genes form a family called oncogenes, which have been widely studied because they are activated in 25-30% of all human tumors and in some of them in 90% [Bos, JL. Cancer Res 49, 4 682-4689 (1989); Kiaris, H. , Spandidos, D. A. Int. J. Oncol., 413-421 (1995)]. Ras proteins play an important role in intracellular signal transmission due to their involvement in regulating cell proliferation, terminal differentiation and senescence [Abdellatif, M., MacLellan, W. R. ; Schneider, M. D. J. Biol. Chem., 269, 15423-15426 (1994); Wiesmiiller, L., Wittinghofer, F. Cell Signal., 6, 247-267 (1994); Barbacid, M. Eur. J. Clin. Invest., 20, 225-235 (1990); Hahn &amp; Weinberg Nat. Rev. Cancer, 2: 331 (2002); Wright &amp; Shay Nat. Biotech, 20: 682 (2002); Drayton &amp; Peters Curr. Op. Gen. Dev, 12:98 (2002)]. The transformation mediated by various oncogenes, amongst which ras oncogenes stand out, induces high levels of choline kinase activity, resulting in an abnormal increase in the intracellular levels of its product, PCho [Lacal et al., Nature 330, 269-272 (1987); Lacal J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 10, 333-340 (1990); Teegarden, D., Taparowsky, E. J., Kent, C. J. Biol. Chem. 265, 6042-6047 (1990); Ratnam, S.; Kent, C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys.<br><br>
323, 313-322 (1995); Ramirez de Molina, A., Rodriguez-Gonzalez,<br>
A., Penalva, V., Lucas, L., Lacal, J. C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 285, 873-879 (2001); Ramirez de Molina, A., Penalva, V.; Lucas, L., Lacal, J. C. Oncogene 21, 937-946 (2002)]. Supplementary facts support the role of ChoK in the generation of human tumors because studies using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques have shown high levels of PCho in human tumor tissues with respect to normal tissues, including, among others, breast, colon, lung and prostate tumors [Ruiz-Cabello, J., Cohen, J. S. NMR Biomed. 5, 226-233 (1992); de Certaines, J. D., Larsen, V. A., Podo, F., Carpinelli, G., Briot, 0., Henriksen, 0. NMR Biomed. 6, 345-365 (1993) ; Smith, T. A. D. , Bush, C. , Jameson, C, Titley, J. C, Leach, M. 0., Wilman, D. E. V., McCready, V. R. NMR Biomed. 6, 318-323 (1993) ] . It is common knowledge that ras is one of the most profoundly studied oncogenes in human carcinogenesis and that ChoK inhibition has shown to be a new and efficient antitumor strategy in cells transformed by oncogenes [Cuadrado, A. , Carnero, A. , Dolfi, F. , Jimenez, B., Lacal, J. C. Oncogene, 8, 2959-2968 (1993); Jimenez, B., del Peso, L., Montaner, S., Esteve, P. Lacal, J. C. J. Cell Biochem., 57, 141-149 (1995); Hernandez-Alcoceba, R. , Saniger, L., Campos, J., Nunez, M. C, Khaless, F., Gallo, M. A., Espinosa, A., Lacal, J. C. Oncogene, 15, 22 8 9-2 301 (1997)]. These first observations were later extrapolated in vivo in nude mice [Hernandez-Alcoceba, R., Fernandez, F., Lacal, J. C. Cancer Res. 59, 3112-3118 (1999)]. The research on ChoK inhibitors has identified Hemicholinium-3 (HC-3) as a relatively powerful and selective blocking agent [Cuadrado A. , Carnero A. , Dolfi F. , Jimenez B. and Lacal J.C. Oncogene 8, 2959-2968 (1993); Jimenez B., del Peso L., Montaner S., Esteve P. and Lacal J.C. J. Cell Biochem. 57, 141-149 (1995) ; Hernandez-Alcoceba, R. , Saniger, L., Campos, J. , Nunez, M. C, Khaless, F., Gallo, M. A., Espinosa, A., Lacal, J. C. Oncogene, 15, 2289-2301 (1997)]. This choline homologue with a biphenyl structure has been used to design new antitumor drugs. Since HC-3 is a powerful respiratory paralyzing agent, it is not a good candidate for its clinical use. The synthesis of several derivatives has been based on<br><br>
structural modifications of HC-3 improving the ChoK inhibitory activity  and  suppressing  its  toxic  effects.  The  inhibitory effect  produced  by  bisquaternized  symmetrical  compounds  on proliferation has been correlated with the ability to induce PCho production in whole cells [Hernandez-Alcoceba, R., Saniger, L. ,  Campos,  J. ,  Nunez,  M.  C. ,  Khaless,  F. ,  Gallo,  M.  A., Espinosa, A., Lacal, J. C. Oncogene, 15, 22 8 9-2 301 (1997) and ES 2  117  950].  When  the  1,2-ethylene-p-(bibenzyldimethyl-diyl) residue was used as spacer between the two cationic pyridinium heads substituted in position 4  [Campos,  J.,  Nunez,  M.  C, Rodriguez, V. , Gallo, M. A., Espinosa, A. Bioorg. &amp; Med. Chem. Lett.  10,  767-770  (2000)],  the structures were evaluated by their  ability  to  inhibit  the  isolated  ChoK  (in  ex  vivo conditions)  [Lacal J.C.  IDrugs 4 :  419-426  (2001)] .  The 4-NR2 group provided a considerable contribution and it was proposed [Campos,  J.,  Nunez,  M.  C. ,  Rodriguez,  V.,  Gallo,  M,  A., Espinosa, A. Bioorg. &amp; Med. Chem. Lett. 10, 767-770 (2000)] that the role of this group is electronic, by delocalization of the positive charge. The increase in ChoK activity in various human breast carcinomas has been published  [Ramirez de Molina, A. , Gutierrez, R. , Ramos, M. A., Silva, J. M., Silva, J., Sanchez, J. J., Bonilla, F., Lacal, J. C. Oncogene 21, 4317-4322 (2002)]. It has■recently been reported that ChoK alteration is a frequent event in some human tumors such as lung, colorectal and prostate tumors   [Ramirez  de  Molina,   A. ,   Rodriguez-Gonzalez,   A. , Gutierrez, R., Martinez-Pinero, L., Sanchez, J. J., Bonilla, F., Rosell, R., Lacal, J. C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.  Commun. 296, 580-583 (2002)] .<br>
The bisquaternized pyridinium derivatives described in the state of the art and particularly in patent ES 2 117 950, show, however,  high  levels  of  toxicity,  limiting  their  extended therapeutic application.<br>
Therefore, in the state of the art there is a need to develop compounds having an activity blocking phosphorylcholine biosynthesis in tumor cells or in processes produced by parasitic, viral, bacterial or fungal infection, and, at the same time, having low levels of toxicity.<br><br>
The authors of the present invention have discovered, after diligent research, that certain modifications in the structure of the compounds described in the state of the art and particularly in patent ES 2 117 950, have an unexpectedly and therefore surprisingly significant decrease in the levels of toxicity of said compounds of the state of the art. Brief Description of the Invention<br>
Therefore, the invencion provides as its first object a family of compounds having formula I,<br><br>
the structure of which is characterized by having two N-aryl-aminopyridinium groups joined by a spacer. In addition to acting as blocking agents of phosphorylcholine biosynthesis, by means of selectively blocking the choline kinase enzyme in tumor cells or potentially in processes produced by parasitic, viral, bacterial or fungal infections, the compounds of this family have low levels of toxicity.<br>
In a second object, the invention provides the use of the compounds of formula I in medicine.<br>
An additional object of the present invention consists of providing pharmaceutical formulations comprising at least one compound of formula I.<br>
The invention provides, in another object, a method for preparing the compounds of formula I.<br>
Finally, the invention provides the compounds of formula VII participating as starting compounds in the method for preparing compounds of formula I.<br><br><br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
In its first object,  the invention provides a family of compounds corresponding to general formula I:<br><br>
where<br>
Q"         represents the conjugate base of a pharmaceutically<br>
suitable organic or inorganic acid;<br>
Ri and R' i represent, independently of each other, a radical selected from the group formed by H and Ci_6 alkyl optionally substituted by trifluoromethyl, hydroxyl or alkoxyl;<br>
R2 and R'2 represent, independently of each other, an aryl radical optionally substituted by halogen, trifluoromethyl, hydroxyl, C]_ft alkyl, amino or alkoxyl;<br>
R3 and R'3 represent, independently of each other, either a radical selected from the group formed by H, halogen, trifluoromethyl, hydroxyl, amino, alkoxyl and Ci_6 alkyl optionally substituted by trifluoromethyl, hydroxyl, amino or alkoxyl, or together with R4 and R' 4 respectively, and independently of each other, a -CH=CH-CH=CH- radical optionally substituted by halogen, trifluoromethyl, hydroxyl, Ci_6 alkyl, amino or alkoxyl;<br>
R4 and R' 4 represent,  independently  of  each  other,  either  a<br><br>
radical selected from the group formed by H and Ci-6 alkyl optionally substituted by halogen, trifluoromethyl, hydroxyl, amino or alkoxyl, or together with R3 and R'3 respectively, and independently of each other, a -CH=CH-CH=CH- radical optionally substituted by halogen, trifluoromethyl, hydroxyl, C!_6 alkyl, amino or alkoxyl; and A         represents a spacer group.<br>
In addition to acting as blocking agents of phosphorylcholine biosynthesis by means of selectively blocking the choline kinase enzyme in tumor cells or in cells affected by parasitic infection, the compounds belonging to this family are characterized by having levels of toxicity lower than those of compounds of similar structure known in the state of the art. This feature of the compounds of the invention is shown in the examples given below.<br>
In view of the present invention, spacer group N'A" is understood as any divalent organic structure acting as a joining link between the two pyridinium groups present in the structure defined by formula I. In a particular embodiment of the invention, the spacer A has a structure according to one of the formulas II, III, IV, V and VI. These formulas represent radicals; in them, the line — at the ends represents a bond, and not a methyl group.<br><br>
where m, n and p represent integers which can have the following values: m = 0, 1; n= 0, 1-10; p= 0, 1; with the condition that )  m, n and p do not take the value of zero at the same time.<br><br><br><br>
According to the present invention, the radicals Ri and R'i, R2 and R':, as well as R3 and R4 , R' 3 and R'4 can represent different radicals or the same radicals, giving rise to asymmetric or symmetric compounds.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the invention, the radicals R: and R' 2 represent, independently of each other, a phenyl radical optionally substituted by halogen, trifluoromethyl, hydroxyl, Ci-e alkyl, amino and alkoxyl. In another particular embodiment of the invention, the radicals Ra and R' x represent a methyl radical, whereas the radicals R: and R' z represent independently of each other a phenyl radical optionally substituted by one or more halogen substituents. In a third particular embodiment, both the radicals R3 and R4 and the radicals R'3 and R' 4 together represent, although independently of each other, a -CH=CH-CH=CH- radical optionally substituted by one or more halogen substituents.<br>
The preferred compounds of the invention are shown in the following table I:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
antitumor treatment.<br>
On the other hand, the biological assays carried out by the authors of the invention allow extending this type of activity to antiviral, antiparasitic or antifungal activity because it is known that several parasites like Plasmodium falciparum or Trypanosoma cruzi, several viruses such as adenovirus, bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and fungi like Candida albicans require the metabolic pathway of phosphatidylcholine synthesis through choline kinase in order to complete their infective cycles in humans and animals. In this sense, the background in literature supports the role of ChoK in the intracellular metabolism in certain nucleosides in Hep-G2 cells [Martin, L. T.; Faraj, A.; Schinazi, R. F.; Gosselin, G.; Mathe, C; Imbach, J.-L.; Sommadossi, J.-P, Biochemical Pharmacology, 53, 75-87 (1997)], the use of ChoK as an enzymatic marker in parasitic diseases [Wunderlich, F.; Helwig, M.; Schillinger, G.; Vial, H.; Philippot, J.; Speth, V. Molecular and Biochemical Parasitology, 23, 103-115 (1987); Ancelin, M. L.; Vial, H. J. Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA)- Lipids and Lipid Metabolism, 875, 52-58 (1986)], and the participation of ChoK in the biosynthesis of important phospholipids in viruses [Balakivera L., Schoen G., Thouvenin E., Chroboczek J. J. Virol. 77:4858-4866 (2003)], bacteria [Whiting GC, Gillespie SH. FEMS Microbiol Lett. 138:141-145 (1996)] and fungi [Mago N, Khuller GK. J Med Vet Mycol. 28:355-362 (1990)]); Mago N, Khuller GK. J Med Vet Mycol. 28:355-362 (1990)]. All these studies support that ChoK inhibition could have important therapeutic consequences in curing the diseases mentioned hereinbefore.<br>
Therefore, in a second object, the invention provides the use of the compounds of formula I in medicine. Specifically, the compounds of formula I are claimed for their use in medicine. In a particular embodiment, the invention provides the compounds of formula I for the treatment of cancer, preferably, breast, lung, colorectal and pancreatic cancer. In another particular embodiment, the invention provides the compounds of formula I for the treatment of viral disease, preferably those caused by Adenovirus; as well as for antiparasitic treatment, preferably<br><br>
for those diseases caused by Plasmodium or Trypanosoma; antibacterial treatment, preferably for those diseases caused by Streptococcus; and antifungal treatment, preferably for those diseases caused by Candida.<br>
On the other hand, the use of a compound of formula I is claimed in the manufacture of a medicament. In a particular embodiment, the compound of formula I is used in the manufacture of a medicament for cancer, preferably breast, lung, coXorectal or pancreatic cancer. In another particular embodiment, the compound of formula I is used in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of viral diseases, preferably those caused by Adenovirus; as well as in the manufacture of a medicament for antiparasitic treatment, preferably for those diseases caused by Plasmodium or Trypanosoma; in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of bacterial disease, preferably those caused by Streptococcus, and in the manufacture of a drug for the treatment of fungal diseases, preferably those caused by Candida.<br>
In its third obj ect, the invention provides pharmaceutical formulations comprising at least one compound of formula I as an active ingredient. Said pharmaceutical formulations can contain one or more excipients and/or carrier substances. Furthermore, said formulations can contain any other active ingredient inhibiting the function of the choline kinase enzyme.<br>
The excipients, carrier substances and auxiliary substances must be pharmaceutically and pharmacologically tolerable, such that they can be combined with other components of the formulation or preparation and do not have adverse effects in the organism treated. The pharmaceutical compositions or formulations include those that are suitable for oral or parenteral administration (including subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular and intravenous administration) , although the best administration route depends on the conditions of the patient. The formulations can be in the form of single doses. the formulations can be prepared according to methods known in the field of pharmacology. The amounts of active substances to be administered can vary according to the particularities of the<br><br>
therapy.<br>
The invention also provides a method for preparing the compounds of formula I. This object of the invention has two different embodiments according to whether the compound of formula I has the same or different aminopyridinium groups.<br>
a)	Process for obtaining the compounds of formula I in<br>
which the aminopyridinium groups  are the  same:  The process<br>
comprises reacting the corresponding heterocyclic derivative of<br>
formula  VII  and  the  dihalogenated  derivative  AX2  (where  X<br>
represents the halogen atom: Cl, Br or I) in 2:1 molar amounts<br>
in an organic solvent. The reaction preferably takes place in<br>
butanone, in a closed tube and at a temperature of 90 to 110°C.<br>
b)	Process for obtaining the compounds of formula I in<br>
which the aminopyridinium groups  are different:  The process<br>
comprises reacting the corresponding heterocyclic derivative of<br>
formula  VII  and  the  dihalogenated  derivative  AX:.  (where  X<br>
represents the halogen atom: Cl, Br or I) in 1:1 molar amounts<br>
in an organic  solvent,  in order to give  a monoquaternized<br>
product . which  is  again  reacted  with  another  different<br>
heterocyclic derivative molecule, in a 1:1 molar ratio, using<br>
another organic solvent that is more polar than the first one so<br>
that  the  previously  formed  monoquaternized  salt  can  be<br>
dissolved. The first step of the reaction preferably takes place<br>
in butanone,  in a closed tube and at a temperature of 90 to<br>
110°C; whereas the second step is preferably carried out in<br>
ethanol in a closed tube and at a temperature of 90 to 110°C.<br>
Finally, in its last object, the invention provides the compounds of formula VII participating as starting compounds in the method for preparing the compounds of formula I.<br>

EX VIVO ASSAYS OF THE ACTIVITY OF HUMAN CHOK<br>
Recombinant choline kinase expressed in E.  coli in the buffer assay (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0,  100 mM MgCl2,  10 mM ATP<br>
and 200 (J.M of choline in the presence of methyl [14C]-choline<br>
chloride (50-60 ^iCi/mmol) ) was used for the ex vivo assays. The reactions were carried out at 37° C for . 30 minutes and were stopped with trichloroacetic acid cooled with ice to a final concentration of 16%. The samples were washed with diethyl ether saturated with water and were lyophilized. The hydrophilic choline derivatives were resolved in thin layer chromatography plates according to a described process [Ramirez, A. , Penalva, V., Lucas, L., Lacal, J.C. Oncogene 21, 937-946 (2002)].<br>
These assays were carried out with compounds 1-10 of the invention as well as with the compounds EC1-EC6, known compounds of the state of the art, specifically in patent ES 2 117 950. The results are summarized in table II. CELL PROLIFERATION ASSAYS<br>
The HT-2 9 cells were seeded in 24-well plates  (35 x 10:<br><br>
cells/well) and were incubated for 24 hours. Then the cells were treated with different concentrations of ChoK inhibitors in the usual culture medium. Three days later, the wells were aspirated and both fresh medium and more amount of drug were added, and the  cells  were  maintained  for  three  more  days.   The quantification of the remaining cells in each well was carried out by means of the Crystal Violet method  [Gillies,  R.  J., Didier, N., Denton, M. Anal. Biochem. 159, 109-113 (1986)], with some modifications [Hernandez-Alcoceba, R., Saniger, L., Campos, J.,  Nunez, M.  C,  Khaless,  F. ,  Gallo,  M. A.,  Espinosa,  A., Lacal, J. C. Oncogene, 15, 2289-2301 (1997)]. Briefly, the cells were washed with TD buffer and fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde for 15 minutes. After washing again with TD, the cell nuclei were coloured with 0.1% Crystal Violet for at least 30 minutes and washed three times with distilled water. The adsorbed colouring was resuspended in 10% acetic acid and the absorbance at 595 nm was  determined in a  spectrometer.  The  results  obtained are summarized in the form of an ICr,0 value, i.e. the concentration of the compound required to produce 50% inhibition. This value is determined by iterative curve adjustment.  Two values are determined for each point of the curve,  the experiment was repeated two or three times and the mean values were estimated. In the few cases in which the two values differed more than 50%, a third experiment was carried out to determine the real value. The IC50 value as a potency measurement is used to relate the biological  activity  of  the  compounds  with  their  chemical structure.<br>
" These assays were carried out with compounds 1-10 of the invention as well as with compounds EC1-EC6, known compounds of the state of the art, specifically in patent ES 2 117 950. The results are summarized in table II. TOXICITY ASSAYS<br>
Toxicity assays were carried out with 1 month old Balb C mice .weighing about 25-30 grams at the start of the experiment. The mice were inoculated with different amounts of each compound in a range of 0.1 mg/kg up to 25 mg/kg, in daily doses for 5 consecutive days. After the five doses, the mice were left to<br><br>
rest for 9 days and both the survival and general condition were analyzed, paying special attention to the effects on their coat, behaviour, feeding habits and weight. The doses entailing a 50% mortality were recorded as the corresponding toxicity IC50. The results obtained with the new compounds show a clear improvement of the activity when their toxicity is reduced, measured by their corresponding IC50.<br>
These assays were carried out with compounds 1-10 of the invention as well as with compounds EC1-EC6, known compounds of the state of the art, specifically in patent ES 2 117 950. The results ar.e summarized in table II.<br>
The following table II summarizes the results obtained in the assays which have been carried out.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
It can be observed from the data of table II that the compounds of the present invention have a considerably lower toxicity than the compounds of patent ES 2 117 950, whereas they maintain similar or greater values of antiproliferative activity against cells derived from culture tumors and of in vivo antitumor activity against human tumors inoculated in immunodepressed mice.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
