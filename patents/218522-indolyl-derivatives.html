Indolyl derivatives<br>
The present invention is concerned with novel indolyl derivatives useful as insulin sensitizers, particularly PPAR activators.<br>
The invention is concerned especially with compounds of formula I<br><br>
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters thereof, wherein<br>
R1 is aryl or heteroaryl;<br>
R is hydrogen, alkyl or cycloalkyl;<br>
R is alkoxy or alkoxy substituted with one to three halogen atoms;<br>
R4 is hydrogen, alkyl or cycloalkyl;<br>
A is oxygen or sulfur;<br><br>
and, wherein the bond between the carbon atoms Ca and C is a carbon carbon single or double bond.<br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters are novel and have valuable pharmacological properties. They are insulin sensitizers, particularly PPAR activators.<br>
Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptors (PPAR's) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor super family, which are ligand-activated transcription factors regulating gene expression. Various subtypes thereof have been identified and cloned. These include PPARoc, PPARP (also known as PPAR5), and PPARy. There exist at least two major isoforms of PPARy. While PPARyl is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues, the longer isoform PPARy2 is almost exclusively found in adipocytes. In contrast, PPARoc is predominantly expressed in the liver, kidney and heart. PPAR's modulate a variety of body responses including glucose- and lipid- homeostasis, cell differentiation, inflammatory responses and cardiovascular events.<br>
Diabetes is a disease in which a patient's ability to control glucose levels in blood is impaired, because he has partially lost the ability to respond properly to the action of insulin. In type II diabetes (T2D), often referred to as non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), which afflicts 80-90 % of all diabetic patients in developed countries, the Isles of Langerhans in the pancreas still produce insulin. However, the target organs, mainly muscle, liver and adipose tissue, exhibit a profound resistance to insulin stimulation, and the body compensates by producing unphysiologically high levels of insulin. In later stage of disease, however, insulin secretion decreases due to exhaustion of the pancreas. In addition to that T2D is a metabolic-cardiovascular disease sysndrome. Among the comorbidities associated with T2D are for example insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory atherosclerosis.<br>
Current first line treatment for diabetes generally involves low fat - and glucose - diet and exercise. However, compliance can be moderate and as the disease progresses, treatment with hypoglycemic drugs, e.g. sulfonylureas or metformin, becomes necessary. A promising new class of drugs has recently been introduced that resensitizes patients to their own insulin (insulin sensitizers), thereby reverting blood glucose and triglyceride levels to normal, and thus abolishing, or at least reducing, the requirement for exogenous<br>

insulin. Pioglitazone (Actos    ) and rosiglitazone (Avandia    ) belong to the thiazolidinediones (TZD) class of PPARy-agonists and were the first representatives who had been approved for NIDDM in several countries. These compounds, however, suffer<br><br>
from side effects including rare but severe liver toxicity (as seen with troglitazone), and they increase body weight in humans. Therefore, new, better and more efficacious drugs for the treatment of NIDDM are urgently needed. Recent studies provide evidence that a coagonism on PPARa and PPARy would result in compounds with enhanced therapeutic potential, i, e. with an improved lipid profile effect on top of the normalization of glucose-and insulin-levels (Keller and Wahli: Trends Endocrin. Metab. 1993; 4:291-296, Macdonald and Lane: Current Biology Vol.5 pp.618-621 (1995)).<br>
The novel compounds of the present invention exceed the compounds known in the art, inasmuch as they bind to and activate both, PPARa and PPARy&gt; simultaneously and very efficiently. Therefore, these compounds combine the anti-glycemic effect of PPARy activation with the anti-dyslipidemic effect of PPARa activation. Consequently, plasma glucose and insulin are reduced (=insulin sensitization), triglycerides lowered and HDL cholesterol increased (=improved lipid profile). In addition, such compounds may also lower LDL cholesterol, decrease blood pressure and counteract inflammatory atherosclerosis. Since multiple facets of the T2D disease syndrome are addressed by PPARa and y coagonists, they are expected to have an enhanced therapeutic potential compared to the compounds already known in the art.<br>

Compounds of general formula (I), wherein R1 to R4, A and n are defined as before can be prepared according to Scheme I:<br>
Scheme I<br><br>
4-Formyl-indoles (1) can be reacted with a Wittig salt (Bach, Karen K.; El-Seedi, Hesham R.; Jensen, Henrik M.; Nielsen, Helene B.; Thomsen, lb; Torssell, Kurt B. G; Tetrahedron (1994), 50(25), 7543-56) such as (l,2"diethoxy-2-oxoethyl)-triphenyl-phosphonium chloride or (l-methoxy-2-benzyloxy-oxoethyl)-triphenyl-phosphonium chloride in<br><br>
solvents like isopropanol, dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran or mixtures thereof in the presence of a base like potassium carbonate or tetramethyl guanidine, preferably between 0°C and the reflux temperature of the solvents, giving acrylic esters (2) as E and/or Z isomers.<br>
Alkylation of (2) with the heterocycles (3) can be accomplished in a solvent like N?N-dimethylformamide in the presence of a base like sodium hydride or potassium tert-butylate, preferable between 0 °C and room temperature followed by hydrolysis of the ester function, preferably with lithium hydroxide in a solvent like dioxane preferable between 0 °C and room temperature. Alternatively, the alkylation with the heterocycles (3) can be accomplished with KOH in DMSO between 0 °C and 80 °C, preferably at 22 °C; using these conditions, in situ hydrolysis to the corresponding acid is observed and the acrylic acids (la) can be obtained in a one step procedure.<br>
Catalytic hydrogenation of (la) with palladium on charcoal in solvents like methanol, ethanol, dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran or mixtures thereof leads to the indole propionic acids (lb).<br>
Alternatively, compounds of general formula (lb), wherein R to R4&gt; A and n are defined as before can be prepared according to Scheme II:<br><br>
Scheme II<br><br>
The alternative preparation of (lb) according to Scheme II, preferentially be used when E and R are fixed and R , R and A will be varied, follows the same type of reactions as described in Scheme I.<br>
As alternative to the procedures described in Schemes I and II, compounds of general formula (lb), particularly compounds wherein R is varied, can be prepared according to Scheme III:<br><br><br><br>
can react with enolates of alkoxy-acetic acid esters (preferably prepared at -78 °C in a solvent like tetrahydrofuran with a base like lithium diisopropylamide) at low temperature to give aldol compounds (7) as mixtures of diastereomeric racemates. Compounds (7) can be transformed into indole propionic acids (4) by different synthetic routes depending on the protective group used. If a benzenesulfonyl group is used as indole protective function, then, the following two step procedure is preferably used: i) elimination of water by treatment with para-toluenesulfonic acid in a solvent like benzene preferably at reflux; ii) reaction with magnesium in methanol at reflux to simultaneously reduce the double bond and remove the protective function. If a 2-trimethylsilanyl-ethoxymethyl (SEM)-group is used as indole protective function, then, the following five step procedure is preferably used: i) treatment with methanesulfonyl chloride in a solvent like dichloromethane followed by treatment with e. g. l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0.]undec-7-ene(l&gt;5,5) in a solvent like tetrahydrofuran preferably at elevated temperature to give the unsaturated ester compounds as mixtures of E and / or Z isomers; ii) hydxogenation of the double bond with e. g. palladium on charcoal in a solvent like ethanol; iii) saponification of the ester function using standard conditions; iv) removal of the protective function with e. g. tetra-butylammonium fluoride (as solution in tetrahydrofuran) in a solvent like N,N-dimethylformamide in the presence of ethylene diamine in a preferred temperature range between 50 °C and 80 °C; v) re-esterification using e. g. methyliodide, sodium hydrogen carbonate in N,N-dimethylformamide.

Aldehydes (la) are commercially available and described in the literature. They are condensed with diketo-monoximes (2a) according to literature precedence (Goto, Y.; Yamazaki, M.; Hamana, M.; Chem Pharm Bull (1971), 19, 2050) in the presence of a strong acid, typically HC1, in a polar solvent like AcOH to yield the oxazole-N-oxides (3a) (step a). Subsequent treatment with POCI3 in dichloromethane under reflux provides the corresponding primary chlorides (4a) (Goto, Y.; Yamazaki, M.; Hamana, M.; Chem Pharm Bull (1971), 19, 2050, step b). These intermediates are either used as such, transformed  ■<br><br>
according to well established methods into the corresponding alcohols or activated alcohols like mesylates or tosylates or into the bromides or iodides, or finally further elaborated via SN2-reaction with NaCN to give, via nitrils (5a) (step c), exhaustive hydrolysis (step d) and reduction (step e), e. g. withborane in tetrahydrofuran, the building blocks (7a). Finally, the alcohols (7a) can be converted into compounds of formula (3) e.g by treatment with methanesulfonyl chloride in dichloromethane in the presence of a base like triethylamine preferably in a temperature range between —20 °C and room temperature or by reaction with carbon tetrachloride or carbon tetrabromide and triphenylphosphine in solvents like tetrahydrofuran preferably in a temperature range between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents; thus yielding compounds of formula (3) as methanesulfonates, chlorides or bromides, respectively.<br>

Mono-allylated esters (2b) can easily be obtained by double deprotonation of (lb) with a strong, non-nucleophilic base like LiHMDS in an aprotic solvent like THF, typically at -78 °C, followed by treatment with allyl bromide to produce selectively the C-alkylated products (2b) (step a). Standard hydrolysis generates intermediate acids (3b) (step b), which are then transformed, following well established literature precedence (J. Med. Chem. (1996), 39, 3897), into compounds (4b) (step c). Ring-closure to the oxazole using trifluoro-acetic acid and trifluoro-acetic anhydride as reagents generates key intermediates (5b) (step d), which, finally, are elaborated via hydroboration to the target alcohols (6b), e. g. with 9-BBN in THF and ensuing oxidative work-up with H2O2 and NaOH (step e).

Background information on the performed assays can be found in: Nichols JS et al. "Development of a scintillation proximity assay for peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor gamma ligand binding domain", (1998) Anal. Biochem. 257:112-119.<br>
Full-length cDNA clones for human PPARa and mouse PPARy were obtained by RT-PCR from human adipose and mouse liver cRNA, respectively, cloned into plasmid vectors and verified by DNA sequencing. Bacterial and mammalian expression vectors were constructed to produce glutathione-s-transferase (GST) and Gal4 DNA binding domain<br>
proteins fused to the ligand binding domains (LBD) of PPARy (aa 174 to 476) and PPARa (aa 167 to 469). To accomplish this, the portions of the cloned sequences encoding the LBDs were amplified from the full-length clones by PCR and then subcloned into the plasmid vectors. Final clones were verified by DNA sequence analysis.<br>
Induction, expression, and purification of GST-LBD fusion proteins were performed in R colt strain BL21(pLysS) cells by standard methods (Ref: Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Wiley Press, edited by Ausubel et al.).<br>
Radioligand Binding: Assay<br>
PPARa receptor binding was assayed in TKE10 (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mM KC1, 2mM EDTA, O.lmg/ml fatty acid free BSA and 10 mM DTT). For each 96 well 2.4 ug<br><br>

Bound ligand was removed from unbound ligand by solid phase separation using MultiScreen plates (Millipore) filled with 80 ul of SG25 according to the manufacturer's recommendations.<br>
PPARy receptor binding was assayed in TKE50 (50mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mM KC1, 2mM EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA and 10 mM DTT). For each 96 well reaction an 140 ng equivalent of GST-PPARy-LBD fusion protein was bound to 10 ug SPA beads (PharmaciaAmersham) in a final volume of 50 ul by shaking. The resulting slurry was incubated for Ih at RT and centrifuged for 2 min at 1300g. The supernatant containing unbound protein was removed and the semidry pellet containig the recptor-coated beads was resolved in 50 ul of TKE. For radioligand binding e.g. 10000 dpm 2(S)-(2-benzoyl-phenylamino)-3-{4-[l&gt;l-ditritio-2-(5-methyl-2-phenyl-oxazol-4-yl)-ethoxy]--phenyl}-propionic acid in 50 ul were added, the reaction incubated at RT for lh and scintillation proximity counting performed.

Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10"4 M unlabelled compound. Dose response curves were done in triplicates within a range of concentration from 10"   M to 10-4 M.<br>
Luciferase Transcriptional Reporter Gene Assays<br>
Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK21 ATCC CCL10) were grown in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS at 37°C in a 95%02:5%C02 atmosphere. Cells were seeded in 6 well<br>
plates at a density of 105 Cells/well and then batch-transfected with either the pFA-PPARy-<br>
LBD or pFA-PPARa-LBD expression plasmids plus the pFR-luc reporter plasmid and an expression plasmid encoding the secretable form of alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) as a normalization control. Transfection was accomplished with the Fugene 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Bio chemicals) according to the suggested protocol. Six hours following transfection, the cells were harvested by trypsinization and seeded in 96 well plates at a density of 104 cells/well. After 24 hours to allow attachment of cells, the medium was removed and replaced with 100 ul of phenol red-free medium containing the test substances or control ligands (final. 0.1% DMSO). Following incubation of the cells for 24 hours with substances, 50 ul of the supernatant was recovered and analyzed for SEAP activity (Roche Molecular Bio chemicals). The remainder of the supernatant was discarded, 50 ul PBS was added per well followed by one volume of Luciferase Constant-Light<br><br>
Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to lyse the cells and initiate the luciferase reaction. Luminescence for both SEAP and luciferase was measured in a Packard TopCount. Luciferase activity was normalized to the SEAP control and transcriptional activation in the presence of a test substance was expressed as fold-activation over cells incubated in the absence of the substance. EC50 values were calculated using the XLfit program (ID Business Solutions Ltd. UK).<br>

Suitable carrier materials for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar and the like. Suitable carrier materials for injection solutions are, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol and vegetable oils. Suitable carrier materials for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats and semi-liquid or liquid polyols. Suitable carrier materials for topical preparations are glycerides, semi-synthetic and synthetic glycerides, hydrogenated oils, liquid waxes, liquid paraffins, liquid fatty alcohols, sterols, polyethylene glycols and cellulose derivatives.<br>
Usual stabilizers, preservatives, wetting and emulsifying agents, consistency-improving agents, flavour-improving agents, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffer substances, solubilizers, colorants and masking agents and antioxidants come into consideration as pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
The dosage of the compounds of formula I can vary within wide limits depending on the disease to be controlled, the age and the individual condition of the patient and the mode of administration, and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. For adult patients a daily dosage of about 0.1 mg to about 1000 mg, especially about 0.1 mg to about 100 mg, comes into consideration. Further preferred daily dosages for adult patients are of about 1 mg to about 1000 mg, especially about 1 mg to<br><br>
about 100 mg. Depending on the dosage it is convenient to administer the daily dosage in several dosage units.<br>
