3.   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be  performed : -<br><br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
There is extensive literature describing the use of monomeric epoxy functional silanes. Such silanes are used either alone or combined with appropriate polymers. However, one of the main difficulties in the use of monomeric epoxy silanes in water is their sensitivity to hydrolysis and condensation which is difficult to control. In addition, the stability of the epoxy functionalities when using the monomeric epoxy silanes in water is difficult to control because of the tendency of the epoxy functionalities to exhibit ring opening.<br>
The use of pre-hydrolyzed and pre-condensed silanes is one answer to such concerns. A pre-hydrolyzed and condensed silane can be an oligomeric structure that has specific features like controlled molecular weight, usually good film formation capabilities and dispersion properties because the silane terminations are already partially or totally condensed, and faster curing rates. This aspect of the oligomers makes them attractive to the coatings industry as it broadens the field of applications and also helps to get faster application or formulation properties. However, the high molecular weight oligomers can condense further to larger siloxane networks, which result in the formation of structures that are difficult to make water-soluble,<br>
For example, U.S. Patent No. 6,391,999 discloses multi-functional epoxy siloxane oligomers for use in a solventless or solvent-based system. These' multifunctional epoxy siloxane oligomers have high molecular weights and an insignificant amount of residual silane functional groups. Thus, it is very difficult to make the oligomers water-soluble.<br>
Another disadvantage of the use of monomeric epoxy silanes is that they release a large amount of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) expressed as alcohol content introduced by the alkoxy functionalities.<br>
A general trend of the industry is to decrease or eliminate the release of VOCs or hazardous air pollutants (HAPS). It is desirable to reduce the methanol content of any" structure that could be involved in coatings, adhesives and sealant applications.<br>
It is also desirable to prepare water-based coatings, which are resistant to chemicals as well as corrosion resistant based on metallic powders like aluminum, zinc, bronze and other metallic or organic pigments. Metallic pigments being sensitive to water, there is also a need to have superior protection of such metallic powders in water against a well-known mechanism called hydrogen evolution.<br>
It is also desirable to design water-based coatings that have superior adhesion properties, mechanical or chemical resistances with outstanding weathering behaviors and that can be applied on a variety of substrates such as metallic or plastic substrates, cellulosic or natural substrates, concrete and any other material generally used in the coatings and adhesives &amp; sealant industries.<br>
-2-<br><br>
Therefore, there is a need to produce an epoxy silane oligomer that is useful in a solvent-less or solvent-based system to reduce the amount of VOC and/or HAPS emissions. There is also a need for an epoxy silane oligomer structure having epoxy functional groups to be used in waterborne systems for corrosion protection, zinc rich primers, shop primers, metallic pigment dispersions or other coating applications.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present-invention, a process for producing a low volatile organic compound epoxy silane oligomer is provided which comprises hydrolyzing an epoxy silane, the epoxy silane upon hydrolysis of its hydrolyzable sites producing a reduced amount of volatile organic compound compared to that produced by the hydrolysis of a silane possessing an equivalent number, per mole, of hydrolyzable sites all of which are hydrolyzable alkoxy groups, the hydrolyzing of the epoxy silane being carried out with less than 1.5 equivalents of water, said water being continuously fed during the hydrolysis reaction.<br>
It is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to waterborne coatings. It includes uses of low VOC silanes for any type of coating or surface treatment for architectural, industrial maintenance, decorative, protective or other coatings. Examples of coating systems are automotive clearcoats, powder coatings, hardcoats such as those used in the production of plastic automotive headlamp lenses, silane-based metal conversion coatings and radiation cured coatings.<br>
The expression "volatile organic compound" (VOC) as used herein shall be understood to apply to and designate substantially pure organic compounds that are volatile per the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Method 24 and/or do not meet specific criteria established for countries within Europe1 with respect to vapor pressure or boiling point or are cited as VOCs in European Union Directive 2004/42/EC. Specific examples of such VOCs include methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, acetoxysilanes, etc.<br>
Various other features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent with reference to the following description and appended claims.<br>

except succinic, maleic or phthalic acid; acetylenic glycols including polyalkoxylated variants such as Surfynol® surfactants available from Air Products; and polyvinylalcohol used to make silane esters described herein are represented by Zc. As used herein, bridging refers to a silane or group in which two different silicon atoms are each bound to one oxygen atom, which is in turn bound to a common divalent hydrocarbon or heterocarbon group as defined herein, such as is commonly found in diols. Bridging groups; diamines such as ethylenediamine, -NR4-L1-NR5-; alkanolamines such as 2-aminoethanol; dicarboxylic acids such as adipic acid or malonic acid, -OC(=O)R10CR11C(=O)O- except succinic, maleic or phthalic acid; acetylenic glycols including polyalkoxylated variants such as Surfynol® surfactants available from Air Products; or polyvinylalcohol used to make silane esters described herein are represented by Zb. As used herein, cyclic and bridging refers to a silane or group encompassing cyclic only, without bridging; bridging only, without cyclic; and any combination of both cyclic and bridging. Thus, a cyclic and bridging silane could mean, for example, a silane with a silicon atom bound to a cyclic dialkoxy group, a silane with a silicon atom not bound to a cyclic dialkoxy group and bound to bridging group(s) only, a silane with silicon bound to both one end of a bridging group and both ends of a cyclic dialkoxy group, a silane with a silicon atom not bound at all to a dialkoxy group (as long as at least one other silicon atom in the same molecule is bound to at least one cyclic or bridging group), etc. As used herein, hydrocarbon based diols refer to diols, which contain two OH groups on a hydrocarbon or heterocarbon structure. The term, "hydrocarbon based diol",<br>
-8-<br><br>
refers to the fact that the backbone between the two oxygen atoms consists entirely of carbon atoms, carbon-carbon bonds between the carbon atoms, and two carbon-oxygen bonds encompassing the alkoxy ends. The heterocarbons in the structure occur pendent to the carbon backbone.<br>
The structures given by Formula 2 will herein be referred to as the appropriate diol, in a few specific cases, glycol is the more commonly used term, prefixed by the particular hydrocarbon or heterocarbon group associated with the two OH groups. Examples include neopentylglycol, 1,3-butanediol, and 2-methyl-2,4pentanediol. The groups whose structures are given by Formula 3 will herein be referred to as the appropriate dialkoxy, prefixed by the particular hydrocarbon or heterocarbon group associated with the two OH groups. Thus, for example, the diols, neopentylglycol, 1,3-butanediol, and 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol correspond herein to the dialkoxy groups, neopentylglycoxy;, 1,3:,butanedialkoxy, and 2-methyl- 2,4-pentanedialkoxy, respectively.<br>
The cyclic and bridging organofunctional silanes used herein, in which the silane is derived from a diol, commonly referred to as a glycol, are correspondingly glycoxysilane. Also, the cyclic and bridging organofunctional dialkoxy silanes used herein, in which the silane is derived from a diol, commonly referred to as a diol, are correspondingly named dialkoxysilane.<br>
As used herein, the notations, (-0-)o.5 and [-0(R10CR11)fO-]0.5, refer to one half of a siloxane group, Si-O-Si, and one half of a bridging group, respectively. These notations are used in conjunction with a silicon atom and they are taken herein to mean one half of an oxygen atom, namely, the half bound to the particular silicon atom, or to one half of a dialkoxy group, namely, the half bound to the particular silicon atom, respectively. It is understood that the other half of the oxygen atom or dialkoxy group and its bond to silicon occurs somewhere else in the overall molecular structure being described. Thus, the (-0-)o.5 siloxane groups and the [-0(R10CR11)fO]0.5 dialkoxy groups mediate the chemical bonds that hold two separate silicon atoms together, whether these two silicon atoms occur intermolecularly or intramolecularly. In the case of [0(R10CR11)fO-]0.5; If the hydrocarbon group, (R10CR11)f; is unsymmetrical, either end of [-0(R10CR11)fO-]o.5 may be bound to either of the two silicon atoms required to complete the structures given in Formula 1.<br>

In another embodiment, the cyclic dialkoxy organofunctional silanes are cyclic and bridging analogs to the 3-choro-l-propyltriethoxysilane (3-triethoxysilyl-l-propyl chloride), used as a starting point for the manufacture of silane coupling agents as, for example, polysulfide silanes, such as triethoxysilylpropyl tetrasulfide referred to herein as TESPT, triethoxysilylpropyl disulfide referred to herein as TESPD. The cyclic and bridging haloalkyl silanes are novel and excellent alternatives to 3-triethoxysily1-1 propyl chloride for use where reduced VOC emissions are desired.<br>
The cyclic and bridging organofunctional silane compositions included herein may comprise single components or various mixtures of individual cyclic and bridging organofunctional silane components, organofunctional silane components, which contain only monofunctional alkoxy groups, and, optionally including other species as well. Synthetic methods result in a distribution of various silanes, wherein mixtures of the starting components are employed for the purpose of generating mixtures of cyclic and bridging organofunctional silane products. Moreover, it is understood that the partial hydrolyzates and/or condensates of these cyclic and bridging organofunctional silanes, also referred to as cyclic and bridging organofunctional siloxanes and/or silanols, may be encompassed by the silanes herein as a side product of most methods of manufacture of the cyclic and bridging organofunctional silanes. Also, the partial hydrolyzates and/or condensates can occur upon storage of the cyclic and bridging organofunctional silanes, especially in humid conditions, or under conditions in which residual water remaining from their preparation   is    not   completely   removed   subsequent   to    their   preparation.<br>
-14-<br><br>
Furthermore, partial to substantial hydrolysis of the cyclic and bridging organofunctional silanes may be deliberately prepared by incorporating the appropriate stoichiometry or excess of water into the methods of preparation described herein for the silanes. Also, the siloxane content of the cyclic and bridging organofunctional silanes may be deliberately prepared by incorporating the appropriate stoichiometry or excess of water into the methods of preparation for the silanes described herein. Silane structures herein encompassing hydrolyzates and siloxanes are described in the structures given in Formula 1 wherein the subscrips, v, of Zb=(-0-)o.5 and/or u, of X=OH can be substantive; meaning substantially larger than zero.<br>
The cyclic and bridging organofunctional silane compositions, if liquid, may be loaded on a carrier or a mixture of more than one carrier, such as a porous polymer, carbon black, or an inorganic filler, such as silica, alumina, various clays, etc. By loading the composition on a carrier it is in solid form for delivery to the rubber formulation. In another embodiment, the carrier would be part of the filler, either intimately absorbed onto or within, or chemically bound to the filler.<br>
The silane compounds with heterocyclic silicon groups included herein may be prepared by transesterification of organofunctional alkoxy-substituted silanes and diols with or without a catalyst by the esterification of organofunctional silyl halides with diols, or by the hydrosilylation of substituted alkenes with a hydrosilane containing a heterocylic silicon group to generate cyclic and bridging silane compositions.<br>
The transesterification of organofunctional alkoxy-substituted silanes and diols may be conducted with or without a catalyst. The catalyst may be an acid, a base or a transition metal catalyst. Suitable acid catalysts are hydrochloric acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid and the like. Typical base catalysts are sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide. Suitable transition metal catalysts are tetraisopropyl titanate, dibutyltin dilaurate.<br>
During esterification of organofunctional silyl halides with diols, diols are added to the silyl halide with removal of the hydrogen halide formed. The hydrogen halide may be removed by sparging with nitrogen or by using reduced pressure. Any remaining halo groups can be removed by the addition of an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, and the like.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the diol-derived organofunctional silane can be prepared by reacting a catalyzed mixture of organofunctional silane reactant and diol with simultaneous distillation. The reaction leads to the alcohol exchange of one or more of the alkoxy groups selectively at the silicon atom of the organofunctioal silane reactant with the diol. The reaction is driven by the removal of the more volatile by-product alcohol by distillation. Suitable catalysts include acids such as p-toluenesulfonic acid, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, chlorosilanes, chloroacetic acids, phosphoric acid, their mixtures, and so forth; bases such as sodium   ethoxide;   and,   transition  metal-containing  catalyts   such   as   titanium<br>
-15-<br><br>
alkoxides, titanium-containing chelates, zirconium alkoxides, zirconium-containing chelates and mixtures thereof.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the diol-derived organofunctional silane can be prepared by catalyzing a mixture of organofunctional silane and diol, in a first embodiment, at a molar ratio of at least about 0.5 moles of diol per alkoxy-silyl group to be transesterified, in a second embodiment, at a molar ratio of from about 0.5 to about 1.5 for a trialkoxy silane and, in a third embodiment, from about 1.0 to about 1.5 for a trialkoxy silane. In each of the foregoing embodiments, the reaction temperature can range from about 10°C to about 150°C and in another embodiment from about 30°C to 90°C while maintaining a pressure in the range of from about 0.1 to about 2000 mm Hg absolute, and in another embodiment, from about 1 to about 80 mm Hg absolute. Excess diol can be utilized to increase reaction rate.<br>
In another embodiment the diol-derived organofunctional silane can be prepared by slowly adding diol to organofunctional silane in the presence of catalyst at the desired reaction temperature and under vacuum. If (iesired, a neutralization step<br>
thereby improving product storage.<br>
Optionally, an inert solvent may be used in the process. The solvent may serve as a diluent, carrier, stabilizer, refluxing aid or heating agent. Generally, any inert solvent, i.e., one which does not enter into the reaction or adversely affect the reaction, may be used. In one embodiment, solvents are those which are liquid under normal conditions and have a boiling point below about 150°C. Examples include aromatics, hydrocarbons, ethers, aprotic solvents and chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents such as, toluene, xylene, hexane, butane, diethyl ether, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, carbon tetrachloride, methylene chloride, and so forth.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the diol-derived organofunctional silane can be prepared by continuously premixing the flow-streams of organofunctional silane reactant, diol, and catalyst (when employed) at appropriate ratios and then introducing the premixed reactants into a reactive distillation system, in one embodiment, a thin film distillation device operating at the desired reaction temperature and vacuum conditions. Conducting the reaction in a thin film under vacuum accelerates the removal of the alcohol by-product and improves the transesterification reaction rate. The vaporization and removal of the by-product alcohol from the film shifts the chemical equilibrium of the reaction to favor formation of the desired product and minimizes undesired side reactions.<br>
The foregoing embodiment of the process herein comprises the steps of:<br>
a) reacting, in a thin film reactor, a thin film reaction medium comprising organofunctional silane, e.g., a thiocarboxylate silane, diol and catalyst to provide diol-derived organofunctional silane and by-product alcohol;<br>
-16-<br><br>
b)	vaporizing the by-product alcohol from the thin film to drive the reaction;<br>
c)	recovering the diol-derived organofunctional silane reaction product;<br>
d)	optionally, recovering the by-product alcohol by condensation; and,<br>
e)	optionally,  neutralizing the diol-derived organofunctional silane  product to improve its storage stability.<br>
The molar ratio of diol to organofunctional silane reactant used in the foregoing continuous thin film process will depend upon the number of alkoxy groups that are desired to be replaced with diol. In one embodiment of the thin film process, a stoichiometric equivalent molar ratio of 1 is used wherein one diol replaces two alkoxy groups. Generally, for the practice of this embodiment, the molar ratio of diol to organofunctional silane can be varied within a range of from about 95 to about 125 percent of stoichiometric equivalence for each alkoxy-silyl group to be transesterified. In a particular embodiment, the molar ratio of diol to organofunctional silane can be within the range of from about 100 to about 110 percent of stoichiometric equivalence. In another embodiment, the molar ratio can be within a range of from about 100 to about 105 percent of stoichiometric equivalence for the molar ratio of diol to organofunctional silane. Those skilled in the art will recognize that excess diol could be utilized to increase reaction rates but such is ordinarily of no significant advantage when conducting the reaction in a thin film and only adds to the expense.<br>
The apparatus and method of forming the film are not critical and can be any of those known in the art. Typical known devices include falling film or wiped film evaporators. Minimum film thickness and flow rates will depend on the minimum wetting rate for the film forming surface. Maximum film thickness and flow rates will depend on the flooding point for the film and apparatus. Vaporization of the alcohol from the film is effected by heating the film, by reducing pressure over the film or by a combination of both. It is preferred that mild heating and reduced pressure are utilized to form the diol-derived organofunctional silane of this invention. Optimal temperatures and pressures (vacuum) for running the thin film process will depend upon the specific starting organofunctional silane's alkoxy groups and diol used in the process. Additionally, if an optional inert solvent is used in the process, that choice will affect the optimal temperatures and pressures (vacuum) utilized.<br>
Mixtures of these silanes described above herein can be employed in the practice of this invention so as not to venture from the spirit and scope of the invention. Advantages of the silane of this invention is that they react in a similar fashion to the silane heretofore used in coating compositions but without the production of any significant amount of VOCs. Further, the silane employed in the coating compositions of the invention reduce the need for recovery and remediation equipment and use of special engineering controls to meet new, stricteremission limits as well as mitigate explosion, flammability, and health hazards. Accordingly,<br>
-17-<br><br>
use of the silanes of the present invention in manufacturing reduce the cost associated with reducing the presence and emissions of VOCs. For silanes made from hydroxy and/or aminofunctional surfactants or coalescing agents the hydrolysis of the silane during conditions of use releases a compound (other than the silane) that performs a function in the coating system (such as wetting, flow and leveling, and gloss improvement as examples for surfactants and improved film formation (film integrity, scrub resistance) as an example for a coalescing agent in addition to the desired reduction in VOC versus conventional alkoxysilanes. In some cases the diol, dicarboxylic acid, alkanoamine or other compound formed from the hydrolysis of the silane may be captured by reaction with other components of the coating system.<br>

Suitable pH adjusting agents include boric acid, orthophosporic acid, acetic acid, ascorbic acid and citric acid. Where a pH modifier, or pH adjusting agent, is used, the pH modifier is generally selected from the oxides and hydroxides of alkali metals, with lithium and sodium as the preferred alkali metals for enhanced coating integrity; or, it is selected from the oxides and hydroxides usually of the metals belonging to the Groups IIA and IIB in the Periodic Table, which compounds are soluble in aqueous solution, such as compounds of strontium, calcium, barium, magnesium, zinc and cadmium. The pH modifier may also be another compound, e.g., a carbonate or nitrate, of the foregoing metals.<br>
-21-<br><br>
Typical monomeric silanes include gamma-glycidoxypropyl trimethoxysilane, gamma-glycidoxypropyl triethoxysilane, gamma-glycidoxypropyl methyldimethoxysilane, gamma-glycidoxypropyl methyldiethoxysilane, vinyltrimethoxysilane, vinyltriethoxysilane, vinyltriisopropoxysilane, vinylmethyldimethoxysilane/gamma-methacryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane, gamma-methacryloxypropyl triethoxysilane, gamma-methacryloxypropyl triisopropoxysilane, octyltriethoxysilane, propyltximethoxysilane, propyltriethoxysilane, methyltrimethoxysilane, methyltriethoxysilane, polyalkyleneoxidetrimethoxysilane, 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxy silane, 3-methacryloxypropyltriethoxy silane and 3-methacryloxypropyltriisopropoxy silane.<br>
Suitable pigment past dispersions include organic pigment dispersions and inorganic pigment dispersions.<br>
According to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the low VOC epoxy silane oligomer can be pre-solubilized in an aqueous solution. The aqueous solution may comprise a particulate metal dispersed therein. Further, rather than directly dispersing the epoxy silane oligomer of the present in the waterborne composition, the aqueous solution including the pre-solubilized epoxy silane oligomer may be included in the waterborne composition described above.<br>
The particulate metal may, in general, be any metallic pigment such as finely divided aluminum, manganese, cadmium, nickel, stainless steel, tin, magnesium, zinc, alloys thereof; or ferroalloys. According to another embodiment of the present invention, the particulate metal is zinc dust or zinc flake or aluminum dust or aluminum flake in a powder or paste dispersion form. The particulate metal may be a mixture of any of the foregoing, as well as comprise alloys and intermetallic mixtures thereof Flake may be blended with pulverulent metal powder, but typically with only minor amounts of powder. The metallic powders typically have particle size such that all particles pass 100 mesh and a major amount pass 325 mesh ("mesh" as used herein is U.S. Standard Sieve Series). The powders are generally spherical as opposed to the leafing characteristic of the flake.<br>
According to another embodiment of the present invention, the metal particulate is a combination of aluminum and zinc. Where the metal particulate is the combination of zinc with aluminum, the aluminum may be present in very minor amount, e.g., from as little as about 2 to about 5 weight percent; of the particulate metal, and still provide a coating of bright appearance. Usually the aluminum will contribute at least about 10 weight percent of the particulate metal. Thus, frequently, the weight ratio of aluminum to zinc in such a combination is at least about 1:9. On the other hand, for economy, the aluminum will advantageously not contribute more than about 50 weight, percent of the zinc and aluminum total, so that the aluminum to zinc weight ratio can reach 1:1. The particulate metal content of the coating composition will not exceed more than about 35 weight percent of the total composition weight to maintain best coating appearance, but will usually contribute at least about 10 weight percent to consistently achieve a; desirable bright coating appearance. Advantageously, where aluminum is present, and especially where it is<br>
-22-<br><br>
present without other particulate metal, the aluminum will provide from about 1.5 to about 35 weight percent of the total composition weight. Typically, when particulate zinc is present in the composition, it will provide from about 10 to about 35 weight percent of the total composition weight. The metal may contribute a minor amount of liquid, e.g., dipropylene glycol or mineral spirits. Particulate metals contributing liquid are usually utilized as pastes, and these pastes can be used directly with other composition ingredients. However-it is to be understood that the particulate metals may also be employed in dry form in the coating composition.<br>
According to another embodiment of the present invention, the metal particulate can be a corrosion protection filler or pigment such as chromate containing anti-corrosive pigments (e.g., zinc chromates and zinc potassium chromates), phosphate containing pigments (e.g., zinc phosphates, alumino triphosphates, calcium magnesium phosphates, barium phosphates, aluminum zinc phosphates, molybdates, wolframates, zirconates and vanadates), metal organic inhibitors like zinc salts of 5-nitrophtalic acid or conductive pigments like iron phosphide.<br>
For the purpose of aiding the dispersion of the particulate metal, a dispersing agent may be added, i.e., surfactant, serving as a "wetting agent' or "wetter", as such terms are used herein. Suitable wetting agents or mixture of wetting agents include nonionic agents such as the nonionic alkylphenol polyethoxy adducts, for example. Also, anionic wetting agents can be employed, and these are most advantageously controlled foam anionic wetting agents. These wetting agents or mixture of wetting agents can include anionic agents such as organic phosphate esters, as well as the diester sulfosuccinates as represented by sodium bistridecyl sulfosuccinate. The amount of such wetting agent is typically present in an amount from about 0.01 to about 3 weight percent of the total coating composition.<br>
In accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the low VOC producing epoxy silane oligomers and waterborne composition including the same can be employed in adhesive, sealant or coating compositions.<br>
A coating composition of the present invention can be formulated in a variety of ways. For example, as an alternative to directly using the epoxy silane oligomer (ESO), in accordance with the present invention above, the ESO may be used as a binding agent in a concentrated form or as a more dilute premixture of the ESO, such as the ESO is mixed with a diluent. The diluent may be selected from the substituents providing the coating composition liquid medium, such as water, or water plus boric acid component, or water plus low-boiling organic liquid such as acetone. Additionally, it is contemplated that the ESO binding agent may initially be mixed together with any of the other necessary composition, ingredients. Hence, the ESO in a liquid form, such as in a diluent, may be mixed with other coating composition ingredients which are in solid or liquid form. However, it will most always be present in any composition before a particulate metal is added to that composition.<br>
-23-<br><br>
The coating composition can also include what is usually referred to herein as a "boric acid component", or "boron-containing compound". For the "component" or for the "compound", as the terms are used herein, it is convenient to use orthoboric acid, commercially available as "boric acid", although it is also possible to use various products obtained by heating and dehydrating orthoboric acid, such as metaboric acid, tetraboric acid and boron oxide.<br>
The coating composition can also include a thickener. It had previously been considered that thickener was an important ingredient, as discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,868,819. It has, however, now been found that serviceable coating compositions can be produced which do not contain a thickener, and desirable coating composition characteristics such as storage stability can nevertheless be achieved. For the present invention, the thickener is thus an optional substituent. The thickener, when present, can contribute an amount of between about 0.01 to about 2.0 weight percent of the total composition weight. This thickener can be a water soluble cellulose ether, including the "Cellosize" (trademark) thickeners.<br>
Suitable thickeners include the ethers of hydroxyethylcellulose, methylcellulose, methylhydroxypropylcellulose, ethylhydroxyethylcelllose, methylethylcellulose or mixtures of these substances. Although the cellulose ether needs to be water soluble to augment thickening of the coating composition, it need not be soluble in the organic liquid. When thickener is present, less than about 0.02 weight percent of the thickener will be insufficient for imparting advantageous composition thickness, while greater than about 2 weight percent of thickener in the composition can lead to elevated viscosities which provide compositions that are difficult to work with. According to an embodiment of the present invention, for thickening without deleterious elevated viscosity, the total composition will contain from about 0.1 to about 1.2 weight percent of thickener. It will be understood that although the use of a cellulosic thickener is contemplated, and thus the thickener may be referred to herein as cellulosic thickener, some to all of the thickener may be another thickener ingredient. Such other thickening agents include xanthan gum, associative thickeners, such as the urethane associative thickeners and urethane-free nonionic associative thickeners, which are typically opaque, -high-boiling liquids, e.g., boiling above 100°C. Other suitable thickeners include modified clays such as hectorite clay and organically modified and activated smectite clay. When thickener is used, it is usually the last ingredient added to the formulation.<br>
The coating composition can include further additional ingredients in addition to those already enumerated hereinabove. These other ingredients can include phosphates. It is to be understood that phosphorous-containing substituents, even in slightly soluble or insoluble form, may be present, e.g., as a pigment such as ferrophos. The additional ingredients will frequently be substances that can include inorganic salts, often employed in the metal coating art for imparting some corrosion-resistance or enhancement in corrosion-resistance. Materials include calcium nitrate, dibasic ammonium phosphate, calcium sulfonate, 1-nitropropane lithium carbonate (also useful as a pH modifier), or the like, and, if used, these are most usually employed in the coating composition in a total combined amount of<br>
-24-<br><br>
from about 0.1 to about 2 weight percent. Greater than about 2 weight percent of such additional ingredient may be utilized where it is present for a combination of uses, such as lithium carbonate used as a corrosion-inhibitor and also as a pH adjusting agent. Most usually the coating composition is free from these further additional ingredients.<br>
In an other embodiment of the present invention, the formulation may include, when necessary, a surface active agent for reducing foam or aiding in de-aeration. The de-foamer and de-aerator agent may include mineral oil based material, silicone-based material, a polyether siloxane or any combination thereof. The concentration of the surface active agents can be adjusted to in the range from about 0.01 % to about 5% of active material. The surface active agents may be used as a pure material or as a dispersion in water or any other appropriate solvent to disperse them into the final waterborne composition.<br>
The coating composition can also contain surface effect agents for modifying a surface of the coating composition such as increased mar resistance, reduced coefficient of friction, flatting effects, improved abrasion resistance. Examples can include silicone polyether copolymers such as e.g., Silwet® L-7608 and other variants available from GE Silicones.<br>
The coating formulation can also contain corrosion inhibitors. Examples of inhibitors include chromate, nitrite and nitrate, phosphate, tungstate and molybdate, or organic inhibitors such as sodium benzoate or ethanolamine.<br>
The waterborne coating can also include an epoxy silane monomer and/or an additional epoxy silane oligomer. The additional epoxy silane monomer may be gamma-glycidoxypropyl trimethoxysilane, gamma-glycidoxypropyl triethoxysilane, gamma-glycidoxypropyl methyldimethoxysilane and a gamma-glycidoxypropyl methyldiethoxysilane. The additional epoxy silane oligomer may be the same as the epoxy silane oligomer or an epoxy silane oligomer formed from a different starting epoxy silane monomer or water to silane ratio.<br>
In addition to an epoxy silane oligomer produced in accordance with the present invention and a monomeric epoxy silane, an epoxy silane monomer and/or a non-epoxy based monomeric silane such as a vinyl silane, an alkyl silane or an alkylene silane can also be included in the coating compositions of the present invention, Typical non-epoxy based monomeric silanes may be vinyltrimethoxysilane (e.g., Silquest® A171 available from GE Silicones), vinyltriethoxysilane (e.g. Silquest® A-151 available from GE Silicones), vinylmethyldimethoxysilane (e.g., Silquest® A-2171 available from GE Silicones), vinyltriisopropoxysilane (e.g., CoatOSil® 1706 available from GE Silicones), n-octyltriethoxy silane (e.g., Silquest® A-137 available from GE Silicones), propyltriethoxy silane (e.g., Silquest® A-138 available from GE Silicones) , propyltrimethoxysilane, methyltrimethoxysilane (e.g., Silquest® A-1630 available from GE Silicones), methyltriethoxysilane (e.g., Silquest® A-162 available from GE Silicones), polyalkyleneoxidetrimethoxysilane (e.g., Silquest® A-1230 available from GE Silicones), 3-methacryloxypropylfrimethoxy silane (e.g., Silquest®<br>
-25-<br><br>
A-174 available from GE Silicones), 3-methacryloxypropyltriethoxy silane (e.g., Silquest® Y-9936 available from GE Silicones) or 3-methacryloxypropyltriisopropoxy silane (e.g., CoatOSil® 1757 available from GE Silicones).<br>
According to yet another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the waterborne and coating composition of the present invention can be applied as a protective layer on a substrate. The protected substrate can be any substrate, e.g., a ceramic or similar substrate, but is most particularly a metal substrate such as a zinc or iron, e.g., steel, substrate, an important consideration being that any such substrate withstand the heat curing conditions for the coating. Bya "zinc" substrate it is meant a substrate of zinc or zinc alloy, or a metal such as steel coated with zinc or zinc alloy, as well as a substrate containing zinc in intermetallic mixture. Likewise, the iron of the substrate can be in alloy or intermetallic mixture form. Especially where such are metal substrates, which are most usually ferrous substrates, these may be pretreated, e.g., by chromate or phosphate treatment, prior to application of the undercoating. Thus, the substrate may be pretreated to have, for example, an iron phosphate coating in an amount from about 50 to about 100 mg/ft2 or a zinc phosphate coating in an amount from about 200 to about 2,000 mg/ft2.<br>
For the substrate containing an applied coating composition of the present invention, the subsequent curing of the composition on the substrate will usually be a hot air oven cure, although other curing procedures can be used, e.g., infrared baking and induction curing. The coating composition will be heat-cured at an elevated temperature, e.g., on the order of about 450 °F, but usually greater, oven air temperature. The cure will typically provide a substrate temperature, usually as a peak metal temperature, of at least about 450 °F. Oven air temperatures may be more elevated, such as on the order of 650 °F, but for economy, the substrate temperature need not exceed about 450 °F. Curing, such as in a hot air convection oven, can be carried on for several minutes. Although cure times may be less than 5 minutes, they are more typically on the order of from about 10 to about 40 minutes. It is to be understood that cure times and temperatures can be effected where more than one coating is applied or where a subsequently applied, heat-cured topcoating will be used. Thus, shorter time and lower temperature cures can be employed when there will be applied one or more additional coatings or a topcoating that proceeds through an elevated temperature bake at a longer cure time. Also, where more than one coating is applied or a heat-curable topcoating will be applied, the first coating, or undercoating, may only need be dried, as discussed hereinabove. Then, curing can proceed after application of a second coating, or of a heat-cured topcoating.<br>
The resulting weight of the coating on the metal substrate can vary to a considerable degree, but will always be present in an amount supplying greater than 500 mg/ft2 of coating. A lesser amount will not lead to desirably enhanced corrosion-resistance. Advantageously, a coating of greater than about 1,000 rng/ft2 of coated substrate will be present for best corrosion-resistance, while most typically between about 2,000 to 5,000 mg/ft2 of coating will be present: In this coating, there will generally be present from about 400 mg/ft2 to about 4,500 mg/ft2 of particulate metal.<br>
-26-<br><br>
Before use, the coated substrate may be topcoated, e.g., with silica substance. The term "silica substance", as it is used herein for the topcoating, is intended to include both silicates and colloidal silicas. The colloidal silicas include both those that are solvent-based as well as aqueous systems, with the water-based colloidal silicas being most advantageous for economy. As is typical/ such colloidal silicas can include additional ingredients, e.g., thickeners as, for example, up to about 5 weight percent of an above-discussed water-soluble cellulose ether. Also, a minor amount, e.g., 20 to 40 percent by weight and usually a lesser amount, of the colloidal silicas can be replaced by colloidal alumina. In general, the use of colloidal silicas will provide for heavier topcoats of silica substance over undercoated substrate materials. It is contemplated to use colloidal silicas containing up to 50 percent by weight solids, but typically, much more concentrated silicas will be diluted, for example, where spray application of the topcoat will be used.<br>
When the top coating silica substance is silicate, it may be organic or inorganic. The useful organic silicates include the alkyl silicates, e,g., ethyl, propyl, butyl and polyethyl silicates, as well as alkoxyl silicates such as ethylene glycol monoethyl silicate. Most generally for economy, the organic silicate is ethyl silicate. Advantageously, the inorganic silicates are used for "best economy and corrosion-resistance performance. These are typically employed as aqueous solutions, but solvent-based dispersions may also be used. When used herein in reference to silicates, the term "solution" is meant to include true solutions and hydrosols. The preferred inorganic silicates are the aqueous silicates that are the water-soluble silicates, including sodium, potassium, lithium and sodium/lithium combinations, as well as other related combinations.<br>
Other ingredients may be present in the silica substance topcoating composition, e.g., wetting agents and colorants. It may also be desirable to prepare a chrome-containing formulation using an ESO of the present invention. Such chrome-containing anti-corrosion pigments are; for example, zinc chromates like zinc potassium chromates and zinc tetrahydroxychromates. Other anti-corrosive pigments can include molybdates, wolframates, zirconates, vanadates, zinc phosphates, chromium phosphates, aluminum triphosphates, barium phosphates, and aluminum zinc phosphates. Such anti-corrosive pigments can also be combined with an organic corrosion inhibitor like zinc salt, e.g., 5-nitrophtalic acid. According to another embodiment of the present invention, the formulations discussed herein using an epoxy silane oligomer of the present invention may be chrome-free.<br>
Substances that may be present can further include thickening and dispersing agents as well as pH adjusting agents, but all such ingredients will typically not aggregate more than about 5 weight percent, and usually less, of the topcoating composition so as to provide for enhanced coating composition stability coupled with augmented coating integrity. The silica substance topcoating may be applied by any of the above described various techniques for use with the coating composition, such as immersion techniques including dip drain and dip spin procedures.<br>
-27-<br><br>
By any coating procedure, the topcoat should be present in an amount above about 50 mg/ft2 of coated substrate. For economy, topcoat weights for cured topcoating will not exceed about 2,000 mg/ft2 of coated substrate. This range is for the cured silica substance topcoating. Preferably for best coating efficiency and silica substance topcoat economy, the topcoat is an inorganic silicate providing from about 200 to about 800 mg/ft2 of cured silicate topcoating.<br>
Further, the ESOs, in accordance with the present invention discussed above, can be-incorporated in many different formulations having many different uses such as those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,270,884 and 6,656,607, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. For instance, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a waterborne composition is provided which comprises at least one epoxy silane oligomer made in accordance with present invention describe above herein with one or more optional ingredients selected from the group consisting of a surfactant, pH adjusting agent, co-solvent, monomeric silane, binder, crosslinker and pigment paste dispersion. The epoxy silane oligomer, in a first embodiment, can be present in the range of about 0.05 to about 40 weight percent of the composition, in a second embodiment in the range of about 0.1 to about 20 weight percent of the composition, in a third embodiment in the range of about 0.1 to about 10 weight percent of the composition, in a fourth embodiment in the range of about 0.5 to about 10 weight percent of the composition.<br>
The additives discussed above can be added at any stage of the use of an ESO produced in accordance with the present invention or in any of the different steps of the production of a waterborne composition produced in accordance with the present invention.<br>
The following examples are illustrative of the present invention. It is to be understood that these examples are not intended, nor should they be construed, as being limiting upon the scope of the invention. A person skilled in the applicable arts will appreciate from these examples that this invention can be embodied in many different forms other than as is specifically disclosed.<br>
EXAMPLES 1-6: SYNTHESIS PROCEDURES FOR THE PREPARATION OF LOW VOC EPOXY SILANE OLIGOMERS<br>
These examples illustrate the preparation of low VOC epoxy silane oligomers. Examples 1 through 6 were prepared using the following procedure. A reactor was charged with an epoxy silane and catalyst and heated to a predetermined temperature. Then, under continuous agitation, a diol was introduced slowly, drop-by-drop, using an introduction funnel. Introduction times were varied from about 1 to about 2 hours. Dining the synthesis, any solvent generated was collected by vacuum extraction. After complete introduction of the diol and removal of the solvent, the second step of the reaction was initiated by the introduction of an ion exchange resin into the reactor and heating of the reactor to a temperature of about 75°C Then, distilled water was introduced into the reactor. Different reaction times at atmospheric pressure were applied, e.g., from 5 to 30 minutes. Distillation was performed immediately after the reaction time to remove any solvent generated<br>
-28-<br><br>
during synthesis. The pressure during distillation varied from atmospheric pressure down to about 300 mmHg.<br>
More particularly, a 2-liter reactor with mechanical agitation, an introduction funnel and a water condenser was charged with an epoxy silane of the type and quantity listed in Table 1 and a catalyst of the type and quantity listed in Table 1.<br>
Under low agitation, the mixture was then heated to a temperature ranging of from about 45 to about 50°C. The introduction funnel was charged with a diol of the type and quantity listed in Table 1. Next, the diol was introduced drop by drop while stirring with the mechanical agitator for different times (See Table 1). During introduction of the diol, a slight vacuum was maintained to remove any solvent generated during the reaction. The solvent was condensed using liquid nitrogen in the water condensor.<br>
After complete introduction of the diol, the reaction was left for different post reaction times (See Table 1). Once again, any solvent generated during post reaction was removed under vacuum.<br>
After the post reaction time, an ion exchange resin of the type and quantity listed in Table 1 was introduced into the reactor, and the reactor was heated to about 75°C. The introduction funnel was charged with distilled water in the quantity listed in Table 1. Once the reactor reached a minimum pot temperature of 65°C, distilled water was introduced into the reactor in the quantity and times listed in Table 1 while maintaining a reaction temperature of 75°C. After complete introduction of the distilled water, the reaction was allowed to continue for the time period indicated in Table 1. Next, solvent was removed using distillation under vacuum. During solvent removal, the vacuum was increased ill a stepwise manner until 300 mmHg was obtained. The reactor was allowed to cool to a temperature of about 30°C at ambient pressure. Next, the product was extracted and filtered through filter paper followed by a sintered glass filter number 3. The descriptions and amounts of each example are listed in Table 1.<br>

Free monomer measurements were made using gas chromotography on the product resulting from Step 1 (internal cyclization) which indicated very good conversion from monomeric silanes to modified silanes. Indeed, less than 2 to 3 percent of free monomer was detected in any of the Examples 1-6 above. More specifically, Examples 1 through 6 were found to contain an insignificant amount of residual monomer thereby indicating substantially complete conversion of the monomer.<br>
Examples 1 through 6 had viscosities ranging from 40 to 898 mPa.s. The viscosity of the examples varied according to the molecular weight of the corresponding diol and starting monomeric silane.<br>
Epoxy content measured on all products indicated that epoxy rings are still closed and that significant oligomerization took place for all products. The mass balances also indicated that methanol had been released during the reactions and that methanol had been substituted by corresponding diols.<br>

All formulations were mixed and dispersed using a Cowles blade disperser with a blade speed of 10m/min. Metallic powder dispersion requires high torque and was run on 250 ml batches in order to optimize the quality of dispersion.<br>
Stability of the formulations was rated from the hydrogen evolution resistance of the formulations after appropriate storage times. All products were stored in tightly closed polyethylene (PE) containers. Generation of foam at the top of the formulations, which in most cases leads to "slow expansion" of the containers, was given as a clear sign of hydrogen generation. Viscosity was adjusted to 20-30 DIN cup number 4 with either water when too high, or HEC (Natrosol® solution available from Hercules) when too low. Preparation of test panels:<br>
Metallic test panels, Cold Roll Steel (CRS), were used. The CRS panels were prepared by wiping the surfaces of the panel with acetone and then ethanol. Next, the surfaces were brushed with an abrasive/detergent cleaner. Then, the panels were rinsed under tap water and dried with air dryer before applying the paint. All test panels were used immediately after cleaning. Paint application and baking conditions:<br>
Paint application was performed using a spray gun in a booth. Paint viscosity was adjusted to about 20 DIN cup number 4 by appropriate dilution with water. One application layer was deposited on a test panel with target deposition of 20-25gr./sqm of dry paint. Curing of paints was performed by air-drying at 70°C for 20 minutes in an oven followed by baking in an oven at 300°C for 30 min.<br>
Testing Procedures:<br>
The following tests were performed on Comparative Example 1 and Example 9: Adhesion test, Cohesion-Metallic Filler Powdering test and Neutral Salt Spray test.<br>
-32-<br><br>
The Adhesion test was made directly on the cured panels according to ISO 2409-1972. The Cohesion-Metallic Filler Powdering test is the evaluation of cohesion of the metallic powders to bind at the surface of the coatings once applied and fully cured. This test reflects the film cohesion and the binding of particles into the film layer. The cohesion-powdering test is carried out by visual evaluation of the quantity of metallic powder removed by a tape adhesive applied on the surface coating according to ISO 2409-1972. After the adhesion test, a visual evaluation of the quantity of metallic powder removed by the tape adhesive applied on the surface coating was made.<br>
High resistance to powdering is noted: Excellent Medium resistance to powdering is noted; Medium Low resistance to powdering is noted: Poor<br>
The Neutral Salt Spray test, or salt spray test, is an accelerated corrosion test. The purpose of this accelerated corrosion test is to duplicate, in the laboratory, the corrosion performance of a product in the field. The salt spray test has been used extensively in this application for this purpose. The accelerated corrosion test was run according to ISO 7253-1984 with general conditions of the test mentioned here after as follows:<br>
-NaCl solution at 50 +/-5g/l<br>
-pH of solution between 6.5 to 7.2<br>
-Cabinet temperature 35°C +/-2°C<br>
-Spray rate over a period of 24h; 1 to 2 ml/h for an 80 sqm surface.<br>
-Plates oriented to the top at 20° +/- 5°<br>
-Red rust is noticed by visual examination.<br>
The corrosion performance was rated according to the number of hours the salt solution described above was, sprayed on the surface of a panel until 5 % of the surface was covered with red rust. The performance of each of the different coatings was then quoted as the relative hours for 5% red rust coverage related to the amount of coating deposited on the test panel, according to following equation:<br>
NSS - Red Rust 5% (hours/micron)= Red Rust 5% (hours) / Coatings deposit (micron)<br>
The corrosion resistance of protected panels is quite often quoted as hours of protection against corrosion per micron of deposit.<br>
Comparative Example 1: Using a Monomeric Epoxy Silane in a Coating Formulation and Testing the Same<br>
In a metallic beaker equipped with mechanical agitation and a Cowles blade, the following components were placed in the beaker: 13.0 weight percent of a 45 grams/liter solution of boric acid in demineralised water, 4.0 weight percent of dipropylene glycol, 15 weight percent of demineralized water and 9.0 weight percent<br>
-33-<br><br>
of gamma-glycidoxypropyl trimethoxysilane. The solution was mixed for 3 hours until a clear solution was obtained.<br>
Then, the following ingredients were added while stirring: 2.2 weight percent of APEO free surfactant (HLB 13-Berol® 48) and 1.9 weight percent of APEO free surfactant (HLB 9-LautoxaI3). The components were then mixed together for ten minutes.<br>
Next, the following metallic fillers were added under agitation: 39.0 weight percent of zinc aluminium alloy paste (Stapa® 4 ZnAl 7 90% in mineral spirit available from Eckart) followed by 5.0 weight percent of zinc flake paste (Stapa® DG GTT 90% paste in dipropylene glycol available from Eckart). During introduction of the components, the speed of the agitator was progressively increased to maintain appropriate dispersion torque. Dispersion was maintained for 1 hour at 900 rpm.<br>
The final products were then stored for 2 days before post addition of 2.9 weight percent of additional gamma-glycidoxypropyl trimethoxysilane.<br>
The protective coating was then applied on the CRS test panels as described above. A thin uniform layer of paint was deposited on the test panels using a spray gun. The coating was adjusted to about 10 micron of cured deposit, This adjustment was calculated after the baking of the plates. The test plates were baked according to curing cycle mentioned above. The cured panels were then tested according to the different procedures described above. Results for Comparative Example 1 are discussed below and are listed in Table 4.<br>
The Product was not stable upon storage and hydrogen evolution was observed after only 10 days of storage indicating poor protection of metallic particles.<br>
Table 4: Comparative Example 1 on a CRS test panel after 2 days of aging<br><br>
Adhesion	0 - No loss of adhesion<br>
Powdering resistance	Excellent<br>
NSS Red rust apparition in scratch	48 hours/micron<br>
NSS Red rust 5% on surface	80 hours/microns<br>
The corrosion resistance achieved with the monomeric silane, gamma-glycidoxypropyl trimethoxysilane, using the procedures described above provided 800 hours of protection on a CRS test panel for a coating having a thickness of 10 microns deposited on the test panel before more than 5% of the surface of the test panel was covered by red rust. Red rust did not appear in the scratch before 440 hours.<br>
Example 9: Using Low VOC Epoxy Silane Oligomer of Example 1 in a Coating Formulation and Testing the Same<br>
In a metallic beaker equipped with mechanical agitation and a Cowles blade, the following components were placed into the beaker: 15.0 weight percent of low VOC epoxy silane oligomer of Example 1 and 20 weight percent of a 45 grams/liter<br>
-34-<br><br>
solution of boric acid in demineralized water. The solution was mixed for 16 hours until a clear solution was obtained.<br>
Then, the following ingredients were added while stirring: 2.2 weight percent of APEO surfactant (HLB 13-Berol® 48) and- 1.9 weight percent of APEO surfactant (HLB 9-LauroxaI 3). The components were mixed together for ten minutes.<br>
Next, the following metallic fillers were added under agitation: 35.0 weight percent of zinc aluminium alloy powder (Stapa® ZnAl 7 powder available from Eckart of Germany) followed by 5.0 weight percent oi zinc flake powder in dipropylene glycol paste (Stapa® DG GTT 90% available from Eckart of Germany). During introduction of the metallic fillers, the speed oi agitator was progressively increased to maintain an appropriate dispersion torque. Dispersion was maintained for 1 hour at 900 rpm.<br>
Next, 0.4 weight percent of Aerosol® OT 75, was added to the final dispersion and mixed for 10 minutes at 500 rpm. Finally, 12.9 weight percent of water and 5.0 weight percent of a 2 percent HEC solution in water were added into the dispersion and mixed for 10 minutes at 500 rpm. The final dispersion had a viscosity of 20 seconds DIN cup number 4, a pH of 6.7, and a VOC content of less than 6.5 percent oi the total formulation, which equates to less than 100 grams/liter of VOC.<br>
The application and testing procedures were the same as those described above in Comparative Example 1. The results are discussed below and are listed in Table 5.<br>
The Product was stable upon storage and hydrogen evolution was not detected during storage thereby indicating excellent protection of metallic particles.<br>
Table 5: Results of Example 9 on a CRS test panel after 2 days of aging<br><br>
Adhesion	0 - No loss of adhesion<br>
Powdering resistance	Excellent<br>
NSS Red rust apparition in scratch	52 hours/micron<br><br>
NSS Red Rust 5% on surface	90 hours/micron<br>
During testing, it was noted that white rust did not appear until after 552 hours of salt spray exposition, and red rust did not appear on the surface of the panel until after 552 hours oi exposition and the scratch was covered by 5% of red rust after 948 hours of exposition.<br>
Thus, Corrosion resistance achieved by the low VOC epoxy silane oligomer of Example 1 without further addition of any co-solvent in a one step process provided about 950 hours of protection on a CRS test panel immediately after 1 day of ageing on the test panel before more than 5 percent of the surface was covered by red rust.<br>
This example demonstrates that low VOC epoxy silane oligomers of the present invention can be used to make very efficient waterborne (WB) protective coatings without addition of a co-solvent at the dispersion stage. The dispersion procedure<br>
-35-<br><br>
involves only water and acidic components thus leading to the WB protective coating having a lower VOC content. Also, the level of performance was excellent compared to standard epoxy silane monomers of Comparative Example 1. It is also noticeable that the formulation contained a low amount of methanol. Thus, limiting the amount of VOC contributing to hazardous air pollutants.<br>

After mixing, the following metallic filler was added under continuous agitation: 78.0 weight percent of zinc dust (DP 16 zinc, dust particles available from Umicore). During introduction of the metallic filler, the speed of the agitator was progressively increased to maintain appropriate dispersion torque. Dispersion was maintained for 1 hour at 1000 rpm.<br>
Next, 7.0 weight percent of an epoxy dispersion (New Gen DPW 687q available from Hexxion) and 0.84 weight percent of water were added to the dispersion and stirred for 10 minutes at 500 rpm. Finally, 0.01 weight percent of Aerosil® R 972 (available from Degussa Huls) was added into the dispersion and agitated for 10 minutes at 500 rpm. The final dispersion had a viscosity of 90 seconds DIN cup number 4 and pH of 6.7. This dispersion is to be used later on as part A of a two pack (A + B) epoxy dispersion of a waterborne shop primer.<br>
