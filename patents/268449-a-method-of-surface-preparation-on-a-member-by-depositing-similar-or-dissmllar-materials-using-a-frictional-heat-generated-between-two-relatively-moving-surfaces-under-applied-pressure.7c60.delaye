				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method of surface deposition using frictonal<br>
heat and filler metal in the form of strips. The invention relates more particularly<br>
to a method of surfacing a base material by creating a weld deposit using a filler<br>
similar / dissimilar material (as compared to the base material) in the form of<br>
strips using frictional heat<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Weld surfacing techniques are applied to build up surfaces. The built up surfaces<br>
may have the same or different characteristics when compared to the base metal<br>
on which the deposit is made. Several arc welding, solid phase welding and<br>
spraying technologies have been developed for different applications and<br>
-equirements.<br>
smaller the thickness of deposit greater is the intricacy of the process of<br>
depositing the material.<br>
Surfacing is a process in which a material of desired properties like corrosion<br>
resistance, effertive conductivity, wear resistance etc. is deposited on another<br>
material that is deficient in their properties. In conventional surfacing by arc /<br>
gas welding, the heat source melts the base metal and the filler metal and<br>
c-eates a weld pool. In this process, the mixing up of the liquid base metal and<br>
filler metal results in the dilution of the filler metal. The resulting weld deposit<br>
will have properties inferior to that of the filler metal in a single pass. In the<br>
siitfacing applications, it is always aimed to achieve a deposit property as near as<br>
that of the filler v^/ire properties. When the deposited metal is diluted (physically<br>
and hence in their original properties), additional layers of filler metal is further<br>
deposited, depending upon the degree of dilution, to improve the properties of<br>
deposited layer of weld metal towards that of the pure filler metal. This involves<br>
additional cost and time. This is particularly critical if the deposited layer<br>
thickness is small. The technology also becomes intricate and will require the<br>
employment of sophisticated control systems. Further, the arc/gas welding<br>
techniques involve high heat input that generally resulting in distortion of the<br>
components and may call for controlled inter pass temperature and post weld<br>
heat treatment.<br>
Patent No. JP2005014030 discloses a technique wherein a joint is made between<br>
the surface of a bottom plate and another top member placed over the plate. A<br>
joint is produced by a rotating tool which contacts the surface of the bottom<br>
plate and the perpendicular side surface of the top member.<br>
Patent No. EP0474455 describes a method of depositing metal by using a<br>
consumable rotating tool. The rotating consumable tool Is pressed against the<br>
member to be surfaced. In addition to the rotation, the tool is also given motion<br>
in the directions perpendicular to and parallel to the surface of the member on<br>
wnich metal deposit is being made.<br>
None of the prior art discloses a simple, faster and economic process of surface<br>
b Jilding which reduces the distortion in components and eliminates post-weld<br>
treatment.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
[t is therefore an object of this invention to propose a method of surface<br>
preparation on a member using heat generated due to friction between two<br>
'elatively moving parts under pressure, which eliminates the disadvantages of<br>
:;he prior art.<br>
Another object of the Invention is to propose a method of surface preparation on<br>
a member using strip material having identical or different characteristics as that<br>
of the base materials for making the requires deposit.<br>
/\n yet another object of the invention is to propose a method, which is capable<br>
of holding the strip material on the member to be surfaced.<br>
A further object of the invention is to propose a method of surface preparation<br>
en a member, which creates multi pass surfacing to achieve thicker deposits<br>
L sing strip material as the filler.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to propose a method of surface<br>
preparation on a member, which is capable to achieve thin surface deposit over<br>
an wide area by multiple passes adjacent to each other.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF A PREFFERED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
I -ig. 1 indicates the schematic view of the operating principle of the invented<br>
method. The method involves use of a strip of material (3), placed in a groove<br>
(5) machined on a base metal, to be metallurgically bonded with a member (4)<br>
to be surfaced using the friction heat generated between the strip (3) and a<br>
rotating tool (1) having a pin (2) at one end. The heat generated by the rotating<br>
tool (1) raises the temperature of the strip (3) to its plasticising temperature.<br>
1 he rotating tool further having a shoulder (6), and a pin (2) is plunged into the<br>
strip (3) so that the pin (2) pierces into the base metal beyond the strip (3) and<br>
tne shoulder (6) of the tool (1) contacts the surface of the strip (3). The entire<br>
surface of the tool (1) in contact with the strip (3) and the base metal generates<br>
a frictional heat and raise the temperature of the material having relatively lower<br>
plastisizing temperature quickly to its plasticising temperature. In a next step,<br>
under a pressure applied by the rotating tool (1) and traversing the tool along<br>
trie length of the groove (5), a metallurgical bond is created between the strip<br>
material (3) and the underlying base metal. Thus, a solid state welding is<br>
achieved. The width of he bond depends on the width of the rotating tool (1).<br>
Tne surfaces to be joined are suitably cleaned to remove all surface<br>
contaminants. This is required to prevent the contaminants from getting trapped<br>
in the joint interface.<br>
At the end of the weld length the linear travel is stopped and the tool (1) is<br>
withdrawn. A run on and run off plate (not shown) can be used to start and<br>
terminate the surfacing operation to have a complete length of strip bonding.<br>
Alternatively, the strip (3) can be suitably located on the member (4) to be<br>
surfaced and retained in that position by a plurality of short staggered tack welds<br>
(Fig. 2) at the sides. A third alternative is to use a clamping roll (not shown)<br>
ahead of the rotating (1) tool to press the strip (3) in position touching the<br>
member (4) to be surfaced.<br>
