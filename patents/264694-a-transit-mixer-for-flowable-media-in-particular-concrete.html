				<td>Transit mixer for free-flowing media, in particular concrete<br>
The invention concerns a transit mixer as set out in the generic part of claim 1.<br>
Such transit mixers (DE 44 31 501) have a front and rear pedestal for supporting the mixing<br>
drum on the vehicle frame, with the front pedestal bearing the drive for the mixing drum and<br>
the rear pedestal provided with two rotatably mounted rollers on which the mixing drum<br>
with its circumferential running tread supports itself. The mounting of the rollers is effected<br>
by corresponding roller supports with two opposing bearing plates in which the rollers are<br>
mounted. The roller supports are bolted by flange-side fillets to the upper side of the pedestal.<br>
This design has the disadvantage that the support roller bearings are readily contaminated<br>
and, further, a comparatively large gap exists between the running tread and the upper<br>
side of the pedestal, as a result of which the risk of an accident increases, because persons<br>
working on the transit mixer can very easily reach their hands through the rotating rollers<br>
into the given danger area. For this reason, comparatively large covering hoods are necessary<br>
for covering the gap to the outside. However, mounting the support roller blocks is very<br>
complicated because on one hand exact alignment of the support roller blocks on the pedestal<br>
and corresponding alignment of the rollers mounted in the support roller blocks has to be<br>
ensured, as a result of which substantial adjustment work is needed.<br>
In this regard, it must be remembered that perfect mounting requires the two rollers to be<br>
perfectly aligned with regard to the running tread of the mixing drum arranged at an angle<br>
on the vehicle frame.<br>
The object of the invention is to propose a transit mixer that is safer to operate, less susceptible<br>
to contamination and is easier to clean. In a further aspect, essentially no adjustment<br>
work for the support roller blocks should be necessary, especially also when rollers are<br>
changed.<br>
This object is achieved in accordance with the invention by sinking each of the rollers of the<br>
pedestal, with the exception of a protruding segment, into the pedestal, with, however, a<br>
segment of each roller protruding outward through an opening in the pedestal for the purpose<br>
of supporting the mixing drum. As a result, the gap between the running tread or mixing<br>
drum and pedestal surface can be essentially minimized, such that access to this area<br>
from the outside is very difficult in practice. In this regard, it is expedient that at least the<br>
upper section of the pedestal, i.e. in the region of the mounting of the rollers, is designed as<br>
a type of box housing, that is, preferably formed from a front and rear support wall, two side<br>
cheeks and upper ceiling wall. As a result, the rollers are encapsulated and protected inside<br>
the pedestal. Further, the advantage arises that the rollers mounted via bolts in the support<br>
walls can be produced in a setting with the pedestal, as a result of which the adjustment<br>
work for perfect alignment of the roller surfaces with the running tread of the mixing drum<br>
arranged at an angle on the vehicle frame can be facilitated or reduced.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the entire pedestal is built in the manner of a<br>
housing, as a result of which the pedestal has a compact and rigid structure. In this regard,<br>
the pedestal offers hardly any points of attack or points of collection for contamination by<br>
collection of concrete and the like and can otherwise be simply cleaned. Especially, however,<br>
encapsulation inside the pedestal protects the rollers including the bearings, against<br>
contamination, as a result of which the lifetime of the bearings and the rollers is extended.<br>
Due to the minimized gap between running tread and pedestal surface, the dimensions of the<br>
cover plates for the gap are also reduced.<br>
Due to the box-like structure of the support with internal ribs and fillets for rigidity and thus<br>
as a hollow construction, the result is a comparatively lightweight, but nonetheless rigid<br>
pedestal structure that is mounted to the vehicle frame by laterally set, suitable bearing elements.<br>
In a particularly preferred further embodiment of the invention, for which separate protection<br>
is sought, the pedestal housing is of a two-limb design. This is effected expediently by<br>
providing the lower region of the pedestal with a central, essentially tunnel-like cutout,<br>
which is open to the front and to the bottom, preferably also to the rear. The bearing elements<br>
for mounting the pedestal to the frame are formed at the lower end of the pedestal<br>
limbs. The consequence of this pedestal structure is a certain flexibility that enables torsional<br>
stress to be cushioned within the pedestal on travel over uneven ground. If traveling<br>
over a pothole leads to twisting of the beam on one side, the flexibility of the two-limb pedestal<br>
leads to much lower loads on the bearing mounts of the pedestal, than is the case for a<br>
pedestal of high rigidity. Since the cutout is provided in the lower region, more precisely<br>
roughly in the lower half of the pedestal, the pedestal has an overlapping hollow structure<br>
above the cutout, as a result of which adequate rigidity of the nonetheless more flexibly designed<br>
pedestal in the lower bearing area is guaranteed. With regard to the roller bearing, it<br>
is expedient that the openings in the box cover for roller reach-through in the axle direction<br>
of the rollers are essentially of the roller width and, at right angles to the roller axle direction,<br>
smaller than the roller diameter. As a result, the rollers mounted inside the pedestal are<br>
perfectly encapsulated and the risk of injury to persons operating the vehicle is reduced. It<br>
goes without saying that at any rate the width and the length of the openings are dimensioned<br>
such that perfect reach-through of the roller for the purpose of supporting the mixing<br>
drum is possible, but that the remaining gap is correspondingly slight. As a consequence of<br>
the sunken arrangement of the rollers, only a small roller segment protrudes upwardly over<br>
the pedestal, which is sufficient for the mixing drum bearing. Expediently, the roller protrudes<br>
above the opening to less than one-third of the roller radius.<br>
For the formation of the two-limb pedestal structure, it is expedient if the cutout is essentially<br>
U-shaped, more precisely largely edge-free, i.e. curved over the circumference, such<br>
that the occurrence of stress peaks is essentially avoided.<br>
It is widely known that transit mixers are offered with mixing drums of different volumes.<br>
In order that vehicles of different sized mixers may be able to use the one and the same pedestal,<br>
the invention also provides for adjusting devices for the front and rear pedestal, for<br>
which independent protection is also sought. Mixing drums for different volumes nonetheless<br>
have generally the same drum diameter and use the same front and rear drum region,<br>
but differ in the length of the cylindrical centre-part of the mixing drum. The outcome of<br>
this is that mixing drums with large volumes are formed longer than mixing drums with<br>
small volumes. For the vehicle-side bearing, this means that a mixing drum of long design is<br>
arranged with its longitudinal axis at a lower angle to the frame than is the case for a shorter<br>
mixing drum. Since, in accordance with the invention, the rear pedestal is provided with a<br>
longitudinal-adjustment and a tilting device, it is possible when a shorter mixing drum is<br>
being used to displace the pedestal forward toward the driver's cabin and especially to tilt it<br>
upward about the two front bearing elements, such that the roller surface for supporting the<br>
running tread of the mixing drum can, as it were, track the running tread. The front bearing<br>
elements may be designed as bearing bolts, bearing pipes, square profiles or the like. Naturally,<br>
the pedestal can be locked in the longitudinally-adjusted and tilted position with, in<br>
line with the specification of the lengths of the mixing drum caused by the different volumes<br>
of the mixing drum, predefined locking positions are specified for when the rear pedestal is<br>
longitudinally-displaced or tilted. The front pedestal is analogously fitted with a tilting device,<br>
such that here, too, tracking is possible to suit mixing drums of different lengths.<br>
A particular advantage is that each of the rollers is supported by a bolt, with at least one<br>
roller bearing with an internal and an external ring as well as rolling bodies between them is<br>
provided between bolt and roller body, with the internal ring of the roller bearing in the installed<br>
state arranged directly coaxially about the bolt. Until now, it was common to provide<br>
between the internal ring and bolt a sleeve on which the internal ring was attached. Surprisingly,<br>
it has transpired that this sleeve can be dispensed with at no disadvantage. As a result,<br>
a further material saving is made. In the design of the invention, the external ring of the<br>
roller bearing is pressed into the roller body. The roller bodies, formed as tapered rollers, are<br>
located in a cage between the external and the internal ring. Between bolt and internal ring<br>
of the roller bearing, provision is made for a clearance fit, such that the bolt can be removed<br>
without major application of force.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the bolts carrying the rollers are advantageously<br>
held detachably, on one hand each in an opening in a first plate forming the front side of the<br>
pedestal wall, and, on the other each in a further opposing opening in a plate forming the<br>
rear side of the pedestal wall. The plates employed may consist for example of steel, aluminum,<br>
carbon fiber materials or plastics. In this embodiment of the invention of a transit<br>
mixer, the widely known support roller blocks can be dispensed with. As a result, further<br>
material can be saved. The roller bearings, which are arranged coaxially about the bolts, are<br>
also arranged inside the pedestal in this embodiment. As a result, the risk of accident is reduced<br>
on one hand, and dirt is advantageously prevented from penetrating into the roller<br>
bearings on the other. Penetration of dirt into the pedestal can be substantially diminished by<br>
providing lateral wiper elements that substantially reduce the gap between rollers and upper<br>
pedestal surface. Furthermore, the mounting of the bolts in accordance with the invention is<br>
characterized by high strength. It is an advantageous provision that the openings in the interior<br>
of the pedestal continue in bearing sleeves coaxial to the bolt or that the openings are<br>
formed by the bearing sleeves. Among other things, this safeguards improved bolt introduc-<br>
tion.<br>
Production accuracy is substantially increased by the design of the invention. By virtue of<br>
the fact that the openings in the pedestal can be incorporated after its manufacture, the position<br>
of the bolts and thus the position of the bearings to the race and the rollers can be defined<br>
exactly. Until now, it was necessary to exactly position the support roller blocks on the<br>
pedestal to ensure exact angle positioning. Until now, increased personnel usage was necessary<br>
for this. Corresponding advantages also rise during changing of the rollers.<br>
It is also conceivable that the bolt is guided at least on one side not through an opening in<br>
the plate, but rather is held just in a bearing sleeve in the interior of the pedestal.<br>
It is of especial advantage that the bolt is a step bolt, and that the bolt has an external thread<br>
at its thin end into which a groove nut is engaged. At its thick end, the bolt has a bolt head<br>
with ring contact surface, with the rear of which it contacts the pedestal. Advantageously, a<br>
cutout with contact surface in the bearing sleeve or directly in the rear plate is provided. The<br>
bolt is advantageously transported with its thin end toward the front from the opening in the<br>
rear plate through a central opening in the roller body as far as the opposite opening in the<br>
front plate. In this regard, the opening in the rear plate is larger than the opening in the front<br>
plate in order that the thick end of the step bolt may be accommodated. A groove nut is now<br>
bolted from the outside onto the external thread provided on the thin end of the bolt. The<br>
bolt is tensioned with the aid of this groove nut in the bolt pedestal. At the same time, the<br>
bolt with its step contact surface is pulled laterally from the rear against the roller bearing,<br>
as a result of which the roller bearing is advantageously pre-tensioned. The pre-tension can<br>
be arbitrarily adjusted by turning the groove nut. In the rear opening, the bolt is secured<br>
against turning, for example by a metal pin. Naturally, the opening sizes etc can also be chosen<br>
such that the bolt can be introduced into the pedestal from the front and be attached in<br>
this reverse position.<br>
To guarantee the simplest possible replacement of the rollers or of the bearings after they<br>
are worn, openings, preferably lateral, are provided in the pedestal for replacing the rollers<br>
and the roller bearings. Naturally, it is also conceivable for the openings to be provided beneath<br>
the rollers in the form of a roller shaft. For changing the rollers, the rollers have to be<br>
relieved by supporting the mixing drum. Thereafter, the bolts are loosened by removing the<br>
groove nuts and can be taken out from the rear. The roller bodies along with the roller bearing<br>
are removed through the side openings and replaced by new roller bodies.<br>
To protect the roller bearings against unnecessary contamination, advantageous provision is<br>
made for forming the openings such that they are closable. This occurs in the simplest of<br>
manners by means of metal or plastic plates to be bolted onto the side of the pedestal.<br>
To increase the lifetime of the bearings, a lubricating nipple for lubricating the roller bearings<br>
is provided advantageously at the rear or the front of each bolt.<br>
It is especially expedient that the pedestal continues upward in each of two carrier arms,<br>
especially for mounting the filler hopper and the discharge shell, with the upper edge contour<br>
of the plate forming the rear pedestal surface and/or of the plate forming the front pedestal<br>
surface being contoured, at least partially, in a U-shape curve or a V-shape. Where<br>
mention is made of plates in the description and claims, naturally this includes plates that<br>
are also composed of several plates. The measure of continuing the pedestal upward on both<br>
sides in each carrier arm has both strength and esthetic advantages. The pedestal construction<br>
is stiffened by the U- or V-shape contouring of the plate edges. The carrier arms continue<br>
into the pedestal. On account of the special form of the plates, which corresponds to<br>
the flow of forces, additional reinforcements between the carrier arms can be dispensed with<br>
that were necessary previously to guarantee rigidity of the carrier arms. Especially, forces<br>
acting on the carrier arms during cornering are absorbed by the shaping of the pedestal in<br>
accordance with the invention.<br>
It is furthermore of advantage that the opposing inner surfaces of the plates forming the carrier<br>
arms combine essentially into a U-shape or V-shape in the longitudinal central plane of<br>
the vehicle and form an upper pedestal surface in which openings are provided for the rollers.<br>
The upper pedestal surface avoids penetration of dirt into the pedestal. Shaping of the<br>
pedestal surface in accordance with the invention causes the shape of this upper pedestal<br>
surface to be adapted to the U- or V-shape of the pedestal side surfaces. The openings inside<br>
the upper pedestal surface are necessary in order that the running tread of the mixing<br>
drum can be supported by the two rollers of the pedestal. Advantageously, the openings are<br>
just large enough to allow the rollers to rotate without any problems. The smaller the opening,<br>
the less dirt can get into the inside of the hollow bodies.<br>
To further increase the stability of the pedestal carrier arm construction, the plate forming<br>
the rear pedestal surface and the plate forming the front pedestal surface are each advantageously<br>
connected, especially by welding, by their upper edge to the edges of the plate<br>
forming the U-shaped or V-shaped pedestal surface, preferably along the entire length of the<br>
edge.<br>

Fig. 10 shows a schematic view of a mixing drum mounted on a front and rear pedestal, and<br>
Fig. 11 shows an analogous view in accordance with Fig. 10 of a mixing drum with lower<br>
nominal volume, and<br>
Fig. 12 shows a further alternative embodiment of a pedestal with 3-point bearing.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a concrete mixing vehicle 1 in the form of a truck with a frame 2, which usually<br>
is formed from two parallel beams bearing a front and rear pedestal 3 and 4 on which a<br>
mixing drum labeled 5 for concrete or similar viscous substances is accommodated and<br>
mounted. In the region of the front pedestal 3 is arranged the drive for the mixing drum 5,<br>
but this is only illustrated here schematically. The mixing drum 5 is mounted rotatably via a<br>
running tread 6 formed on the rear part of the drum on the pedestal. For this purpose, pedestal<br>
4, as can be seen from Fig. 2, has two rollers 7, which are mounted rotatably in pedestal<br>
4.<br>
In the embodiment of Figs. 2 and 3, the upper section of the pedestal 4 is formed from a<br>
box-shaped housing, which is essentially formed from a front pedestal wall 8 and a rear<br>
pedestal wall 9 visible in Fig. 3, which are bridged by a ceiling wall 10. This has an arc<br>
shape adjusted to the diameter or the running tread 6 of the mixing drum 5 to be accommodated.<br>
On both sides of the upper region of the pedestal are provided two carrier arms 11 which, in<br>
the embodiment shown, are equally formed as hollow box profiles and are attached to the<br>
box structure of the upper pedestal section. These carrier arms 11 are suitably connected to<br>
the pedestal arch, by welding and/or bolted connections, for which purpose the upper front<br>
and rear regions of the pedestal wall of the pedestal are provided with suitable interfaces or<br>
connecting points 12. Access covers 14 are provided at the side cheeks of the pedestal or, as<br>
shown in Fig. 2, the side cheeks 13 of the carrier arms 11, said access covers attached by<br>
being slipped on or by bolted connections and providing access from the outside into the<br>
inside of the pedestal or to the rollers 7 accommodated therein. The carrier arms 11 encompass<br>
the mixing drum 5 on both sides from the side and, as evident from Fig. 1, accommodate<br>
the hopper filler 15 for the concrete feed and the discharge hopper 16. Further, a delivery<br>
slide 17 is provided.<br>
The upper box-shaped part of the pedestal 4 is supported by two inclined supporting struts<br>
18 and rear spars, which are connected to a pedestal frame 19, by means of which the pedestal<br>
is arranged on the beams or the frame 2. The pedestal frame 19 is constructed from two<br>
longitudinal spars 20 and two cross-spars 21. In the embodiment shown, the supporting<br>
struts and the spars are formed by square profiles.<br>
As is best seen from Fig. 2, the rollers 7 for mounting the mixing drum are sunk inside the<br>
pedestal 4 and protrude from openings 22 in the ceiling wall 10 just far enough as is needed<br>
for mounting purposes for supporting the mixing drum.<br>
As is especially evident from Figs. 4 and 5, the rollers 7 are mounted on bolts 23, which are<br>
designed as step bolts. Each bolt is accommodated in opposing bearing openings 24 and 25<br>
in the front and rear pedestal wall 8 and 9. These openings 24 and 25 continue inside the<br>
pedestal box as bearing sleeves 26 and 27, as is best seen in Fig. 5.<br>
Across its circumference at the external end, the rear bearing sleeve 27 has a cutout 28 with<br>
an annular contact surface. The bolt head 29 of the step bolt 23 is accommodated in this<br>
cutout 28 with a lower annular contact surface (Fig. 4). An external thread 30 is provided at<br>
the circumference of the thin end of each bearing bolt 23. The bearing bolt 23 is tensioned<br>
by means of a groove nut 31 between the rear pedestal wall 4 and the front pedestal wall 3.<br>
The thick end of the bearing bolt 23 is secured in the usual way against turning.<br>
Between bearing bolt 23 and the rolling body 32 is provided a roller bearing 33 formed as a<br>
tapered roller bearing. The outer ring 33 of the roller bearing 33 is pressed into the roller<br>
body 32. The roller bodies 35 formed as cone stumps are arranged in a cage not illustrated.<br>
The rolling bodies 35 are supported on an inner ring 36.<br>
In this embodiment, the roller bearing is formed as a two-row bearing with two inner and<br>
two outer rings. In opposition to the known prior art, no sleeve is located between the inner<br>
ring 36 and the bearing bolt 23. The inner ring 36 of the roller bearing 35 is arranged coaxially<br>
directly about the bearing bolts 23.<br>
Between bearing bolt 23 and internal ring 36, provision is made for a clearance fit, such that<br>
the bolt 23 can be removed simply.<br>
As is best seen from Fig. 2, the upper end face 10 of the pedestal is curved or arched to suit<br>
the mixing drum, just like the upper edges 37 and 38 of the front pedestal cheek and the rear<br>
pedestal cheek 8 and 9. As a result, only a small gap remains between the mixing drum and<br>
pedestal. Additionally, the transition between pedestal 4 and carrier arms 11 is stiffened, a<br>
fact which is especially necessitated by the formation of the carrier arms and the pedestal in<br>
this region as a hollow profile part. As a result, additional struts between the carrier arms 11<br>
or between the carrier arms 11 and the pedestal 4 can be dispensed with. Consequently, the<br>
structure of the pedestal is leaner overall and hardly any dirt-collection points are formed.<br>
Further, compact encompassing of the mixing drum occurs, especially caused by the sunken<br>
arrangement, very clearly evident from Fig. 2, of the rollers 7 inside the pedestal, such that<br>
only narrow trim plates 39 are needed for closing the remaining smaller gap between the<br>
circumference of the mixing drum and the upper end face 10 of the pedestal.<br>
For the sake of completeness only, it is noted that a bearing console 40 for the single-arm<br>
mounting of the swivel arm with chute or delivery slide 17 is provided at the rear pedestal<br>
cheek 4.<br>
From Fig. 4, finally, wiper elements 41 are visible that reduce the gap between the rollers 7<br>
and the edges of the two openings 22 in the end face 10.<br>
Contamination of the bearings is substantially reduced by the wiper elements 41.<br>
The wiper elements 41 are formed as angled elements and bolted by their base to the upper<br>
pedestal surface. Instead of such wiper elements 41, brushes or rubber wipers and the like<br>
may be used.<br>
In Figs. 6 to 8 is shown an alternative design for a rear pedestal 4, with the same labels being<br>
used for the same parts. By way of difference from the embodiment of Figs. 2, 3 and 5,<br>
the pedestal structure shown here has an overall box-like structure. The upper section, accommodating<br>
the two carrier arms, with arch-like end face 10 and the upper, front and rear<br>
wall section 43 and 44 is built up like the upper section of the pedestal 4 of Figs. 2, 3 and 5.<br>
Analogously in this regard, the rollers 7 in the upper pedestal section are sunk inside the<br>
box-like or housing-like pedestal 4, said rollers protruding only slightly from the two openings<br>
22 in order that the mixing drum mounted on pedestal 4 may be rotatably accommodated<br>
with a small intermediate gap.<br>
Insofar, reference in this regard can be made to the embodiment described previously.<br>
Here, too, the carrier arms 11 are welded or similarly connected via the connecting point 12<br>
to the upper supper section. As is especially evident from Fig. 6, the lager sleeves 26 and 27<br>
for accommodating the rollers in accordance with Fig. 3 are accommodated in two pedestal<br>
cheeks 44 and 45, whose upper edges are shaped analogously to the curve shape of the ceiling<br>
wall 10. In connection to these two pedestal cheeks 44 and 45, the pedestal 4 continues<br>
downward through a front pedestal wall 46 and a rear pedestal wall, also intact, which is not<br>
visible in the drawing. These two pedestal walls are connected laterally to a box housing by<br>
corresponding side walls 47. The box housing is correspondingly stiffened by internal ribs<br>
or fillets. On each side of the lower end of the pedestal 4 are two protruding axle-journallike<br>
bearing parts by means of which the pedestal structure is mounted to the frame. Alternatively,<br>
pipes or bolts reaching through the pedestal structure may be provided for this.<br>
These may be axle-journal-like lugs, bolts, bearing flanges, bearing fillets and the like. In<br>
accordance with the invention, the result is a compact, comparatively rigid, outwardly intact<br>
pedestal structure through which especially the mounted rollers 7 are accommodated protectively<br>
via the upswept pedestal cheeks. Since the pedestal forms a unit, the bearings for the<br>
rollers can be mechanically processed in a unit with the pedestal, as a result of which the<br>
adjustment work is greatly simplified. In this regard, allowance must be accorded for the<br>
fact that the bearing bolts for the rollers must be aligned exactly in order that perfect, rotary<br>
accommodation of the voluminous mixing drum may be guaranteed. On account of the<br>
overall smooth outer surfaces, a fact which is especially important for the concrete mixer<br>
vehicles described herein, the collection of dirt by concrete or mortar is largely avoided or<br>
cleaning facilitated.<br>
The bolts 48 are tensioned or bolted in known manner by U-shaped clamps to lateral protrusions<br>
of the beams of the frame. The advantage of the overall rigid structure of the embodiment<br>
of Figs. 6 to 8 consists in the fact that especially the rolling stability of the vehicle is<br>
increased.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the box-shaped pedestal structure of Fig. 9 can in<br>
turn be formed more flexibly by formation of a central cutout 50 in the front and rear side<br>
wall, as a result of which the pedestal structure in the lower region is, as it were, formed in a<br>
U-shape with two pedestal limbs 49, to which the axle-journal-like bolts 48 are attached. To<br>
be sure, as a result of this the rolling stability is somewhat slightly reduced relative to the<br>
embodiment of Figs. 6 to 8 , but corresponding torsional forces can be accommodated in an<br>
outstanding manner, said forces arising when a vehicle with a mixing drum loaded with<br>
concrete travels over potholes or the like, which can lead to deformation of one of the two<br>
beams, as a result of which corresponding twisting can occur in the region of the pedestal<br>
structure that can be accommodated on account of the more flexible formation of the pedestal<br>
structure in accordance with Fig. 9. As a result, bearing bolts 48 and the mounting of the<br>
bolts to the frame are placed under much less stress. It must be remembered that loads of up<br>
to 15 t can occur here. When the beam twists as irregularities in the road are traveled over,<br>
the twisting can be accommodated inside the pedestal structure. In this regard, it is not necessary<br>
for the rear, lower pedestal wall to be formed with such a cutout, rather this can well<br>
remain intact, at any rate it must be ensured that, at least in the front region of the pedestal<br>
structure, a quasi-two-limb design of the lower region of the box-like pedestal structure is<br>
achieved via the cutout. This is best evident from the illustration in Fig. 9. With this embodiment,<br>
overloading of the bearing regions of the pedestal structure on the beams is<br>
avoided even under high torsional stress.<br>
As is known, concrete vehicles come with mixing drums of different size, with generally<br>
vehicles with mixing drums having a nominal volume of 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 m3 being used.<br>
Generally, the drum diameter of the mixing drums is the same, but the cylindrical section of<br>
the drum is designed with different length. This is best evident from a comparison of Figs.<br>
10 and 11. Fig. 10 shows a mixing drum 5 with a nominal volume of, for example 10 m3,<br>
whereas Fig. 11 shows a mixing drum 5 with a nominal volume of 6 m3. The front part 51<br>
and the rear part 52 of the mixing drum in both embodiments of the mixing drum 5 are unchanged,<br>
but the central cylindrical section 53 is designed for different lengths. As a result,<br>
largely the same parts of the mixing drum can be used for different nominal volumes. In<br>
order, in accordance with the invention, that the same pedestals may be used for the front<br>
and rear region despite the use of mixing drums of different volumes, the rear pedestal 4 is<br>
fitted with an adjustment device that facilitates longitudinal displacement of the rear pedestal<br>
in the axial direction of the beam and swiveling of the rear pedestal. In contrast, the front<br>
pedestal 3 is fitted with an adjustment device which facilitates swiveling of the front pedestal.<br>
Fig. 10 shows in this connection an arrangement of a mixing drum on a concrete vehicle in<br>
which the adjustment device of the rear pedestal 4 is in the neutral position, i.e. the pedestal<br>
4 is located in a non-swiveled position in which the axes of the bearing bolts 48 span a plane<br>
which is essentially parallel to the beams.<br>
For the neutral position, a medium drum size, for example a drum with a nominal volume of<br>
9 m3, is used expediently in order that the tilting angle may not become too great. In the<br>
case of the large drums, that is, drums of greater length, the pedestals then have to be tilted<br>
backward. In the case of short drums, the pedestals then have to be tilted forward. In this<br>
regard, the beams in Figs. 10 and 11 are only indicated schematically by a solid straight line<br>
beneath the bearing bolts 48. For the event that a mixing drum in accordance with Fig. 11 is<br>
used, which has a smaller nominal volume and thus a not so long cylindrical section 53, the<br>
rear pedestal 4 is displaced forward from the neutral position illustrated in Fig. 10 via the<br>
adjustment device in consequence of longitudinal guide members, that is, in the direction of<br>
the driver's cabin of the concrete vehicle and swiveled slightly upward, relative to its rear<br>
region, as is indicated in Fig. 11 by the angle 3. As a result, the roller bearing of the pedestal<br>
4 tracks and is aligned relative to the running tread 6, since, in the short mixing-drum design<br>
of Fig. 11, the mixing drum is tilted more extensively than in the case of the long mixing<br>
drum of Fig. 10, i.e. the axle of the mixing drum contains a greater angle with the plane of<br>
the beams 2 than in Fig. 10. In the embodiment of Fig. 11, the swiveling in this regard occurs<br>
in the region of the front bearing bolt 48. The upswept position of the pedestal is then<br>
locked in suitable manner, which may be effected for example by welding on a holder or in<br>
such a way that flaps or cross-plates attached laterally to the beams have a guide curve for a<br>
guide pin provided on the pedestal side, in order to facilitate a swivel movement. Locking<br>
then proceeds by corresponding locking pins, with the swiveling motion of the mixing drum<br>
adjusting to the different nominal volumes in predefined steps. At the same time, as may be<br>
seen from Fig. 11, the front pedestal 3 is swiveled upward about its front bearing bolts<br>
through an angle a, such that here as well the pedestal bearing tracks the different nominal<br>
volumes of the mixing drums.<br>
The embodiment of a pedestal in accordance with Fig. 12 resembles the design of the embodiment<br>
of Figs. 6 to 8 in that the pedestal structure has a box-like structure.<br>
Admittedly, this pedestal structure is designed to have a 3-point bearing on the frame or the<br>
beams. The two rear bearing points for the pedestal structure of Fig. 12, which are labeled<br>
48, are formed in accordance with the embodiment of Figs. 6 to 8, with the bearings 48<br>
formed by a pipe passing through the pedestal structure. However, the mounting of the pedestal<br>
structure in the front region is different on account of the design as a 3-point bearing.<br>
To this end, in the embodiment shown, the front section of the pedestal structure or the front<br>
part is formed by a tapering hood 60 with pyramidal or funnel-like structure, with a bearing<br>
bolt 61, shown here as an axle journal, located at the front end. In the ideal case, this contact<br>
point is designed as a ball joint or also as an elastic bearing. The pedestal structure is<br>
mounted with the two lateral bearings 48 relative to the beams, whereas in contrast the pedestal<br>
structure in the front region can be mounted to a traverse or similar that bridges the<br>
beam. As is evident from Fig. 12, the bearing position 61 is centrally arranged relative to the<br>
pedestal structure or the two bearing points 48. Otherwise, as regards the further shape of<br>
the pedestal structure, reference is made to the previous description, especially concerning<br>
the upper structure of the pedestal box including the sunken accommodation of the pedestal<br>
rollers and the lateral carrier arms of the pedestal structure.<br>
The advantage of the 3-point bearing realized in the embodiment of Fig. 12 consists in the<br>
fact that, on torsional stress on the two beams of the vehicle frame, one plane is spanned and<br>
as a result enforced deformation of the pedestal structure and corresponding overloading of<br>
the bearing points is largely avoided. In the case of a 4-point bearing, the pedestal is held in<br>
one plane at the vehicle frame by four bearing points. When torsional forces occur on the<br>
two beams, the resultant bending which occurs causes at least one of the bearing points to<br>
wander out of the spanned plane, such that forces necessarily act on the pedestal and the<br>
bearing points. This must be counteracted by a corresponding design of the bearing regions.<br>
In the case of the 3-point bearing described, such forced deformation on the pedestal structure<br>
can be largely avoided, such that no correspondingly large forces can build up at the<br>
bearing points.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
