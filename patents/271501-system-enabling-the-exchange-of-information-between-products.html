				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
A system allowing the wireless transfer of data between a first device having a<br>
microcontroller and a second device when the first and second devices are positioned<br>
adjacent each other is described. The system includes a reader circuit and tag circuit. The<br>
reader circuit is operatively connected to the first device and provides oscillation energy<br>
to the tag circuit when the tag circuit is coupled to the reader circuit. The reader circuit<br>
receives coded information from the tag circuit and delivers the coded information to the<br>
microcontroller. The tag circuit includes a coil and logic enabling patterned oscillation at<br>
at least two discrete frequencies such that the patterned oscillation is representative of<br>
coded information within the tag circuit. The system may be configured to a variety of<br>
product pairs, including consumer product pairs, to control the operation of the product<br>
pair or collect information about the operation of the product pair.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the consumer product market, many products produce revenue for the manufacturer<br>
through the sale of associated consumable products after the original or primary product<br>
is purchased. For example, a manufacturer may give a product such as a shaver handle<br>
away knowing that they will make money from the consumer selling the consumable<br>
razors. Similarly, a manufacturer may sell a larger piece of equipment such as a fax<br>
machine or printer at cost with the understanding that they will make a profit selling the<br>
toner or toner cartridges. The combination of different pairs or groups of supporting and<br>
consumable products run across the full range of consumer and industrial products<br>
including household, office, food and a wide variety of industrial products.<br>
Within such markets, competitors will often copy the consumable portion of the product<br>
and undercut prices of the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to sell the<br>
consumable product to consumers. As a result, (he OEM manufacturers who have<br>
invested substantial money in the research and development of their products continue to<br><br>
look for ways to make it more difficult for their competitors to utilize the competitor's<br>
products within the original equipment.<br>
As one example, there are currently many products that use physical keying systems to<br>
prevent unauthorized products from being used within devices. Mechanical keying<br>
systems require that the physical geometry between the original equipment and<br>
consumable product must match. Such systems may include physical rings with specific<br>
geometry (male and female) that are made to fit together, keyed slots, non-standard<br>
dimensions and other systems. A general example of such a system may be aligned slots<br>
between products such as the core of a paper towel roll that must be inserted into a<br>
corresponding slotted core of a dispenser.<br>
The challenge with physical or mechanical systems is that they are easily defeated either<br>
by the competitor or by the consumer. That is, the competitor may simply manufacture<br>
products with similar geometries or the consumer by using various tools will modify the<br>
geometry of the OEM product or the competitor's product to make the products fit, thus<br>
defeating the intentions of the OEM.<br>
Still further, another common method of defeating physical systems is simply to refill the<br>
container if liquids or other substances are being dispensed. For example, a restaurant<br>
may use the dispensing equipment of a name-brand manufacturer but then re-fill the<br>
dispenser with a generic product thereby "passing-off" the generic product as that of the<br>
name-brand. Not only does this action deny the OEM of revenue from the re-fill product,<br>
it also diminishes or degrades the value of the name-brand product.<br>
In the past, other keying systems have been utilized that require both physical and<br>
electronic connection between two or more devices. This type of physical/electronic<br>
system will often add a significant constraint to the design of the OEM product and is<br>
often limited by typical problems associated with maintaining a physical contact between<br>
devices such as dirt and water contamination and/or corrosion by environmental factors<br><br>
that may ultimately affect the reliability of the product and lead to customer<br>
dissatisfaction.<br>
As a result, there exists a need for an improved system and methodology that enhances<br>
the ability of OEM manufacturers from having competitors produce consumable products<br>
that can be utilized with the OEM equipment.<br>
In particular, there has been a need for an inexpensive wireless system that provides<br>
effective electronic coupling between devices wherein the coupling enables the exchange<br>
of information between the devices in order that the origin and/or authenticity of one<br>
device to another can be determined in order to enable or deny the cooperation between<br>
those two devices.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the invention, there is provided a system allowing the wireless<br>
transfer of data between a first device having a microcontroller and a second device when<br>

In various embodiments of the system, the reader circuit includes an output circuit for<br>
delivering the coded information to the microcontroller and/or the coded information is<br>

In a further still embodiment, the reader circuit includes a power switch responsive to the<br>
actuation of the first product and the microcontroller measures the time of actuation of<br>
the first product to determine the consumption of a consumable product within the second<br>

been consumed.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTON<br>
With reference to the figures, a system 10 allowing the wireless transfer of data between<br>
two devices when the devices are operatively positioned adjacent each other is described.<br>
The system includes two main circuits, a reader circuit 101 and a tag circuit 102. In the<br>
context of this description, the reader circuit 101 may be located on a first product and<br>
the tag circuit located on a second product where it is desired that the two products are<br>
coupled to enable the interaction and the exchange of information between the two<br>
products.<br>
Representative examples of such products and the potential information exchanged<br>
between such products are shown in Table 1.<br><br>
Reader Circuit Design and Function<br>
The general function of the reader circuit is to read information contained within the tag<br>
circuit when the tag circuit is within the operating distance of the reader circuit. Once the<br>
tag circuit is within operating distance, coded information contained within the tag will<br>
be output to the reader circuit for interpretation. More specifically, the reader circuit<br>
includes two uncoupled antennae that require the physical presence of an input antenna<br>
within the tag circuit to create a coupled connection and thereby allow the exchange of<br>
the coded information.<br><br>
As shown in Figure 1, the reader circuit 101 includes a power supply switch A, receiver<br>
antenna B, a transmit antenna C, an amplifier D and microcontroller output El. The tag<br>
circuit 102 includes input antenna G, resonant capacitor H and logic switch F with switch<br>
capacitor E. In operation, as power to the reader circuit is switched on, the transmit<br>
antenna C of the reader will cause the input antenna G of the tag circuit to begin<br>
oscillating at the resonate frequencies (as determined by the resonant and switch<br>
capacitors of the tag circuit and explained in greater detail below) which will be<br>
transmitted to the receiver antenna B whose oscillation output may then be read and<br>
interpreted by an appropriate microcontroller E2 through microcontroller output El.<br>
The receive B and transmit C coils are designed such that they do not have enough gain<br>
to self-couple such that it is only through the physical presence of the tag circuit 102 in<br>
proximity to the reader circuit that allows enough energy to be coupled between the<br>
receive B and transmit C coils to enable oscillation at the resonate frequency of the tag<br>
circuit.<br>
The reader circuit is controlled by power switch A such that when the power switch is<br>
closed, the circuit operates and when the switch is opened, the circuit is turned off. The<br>
placement or location of the switch in a combined pair of reader circuit and tag circuit<br>
can be controlled by the physical design of two coupled products.<br>
When power is turned on to power switch A, the transmit coil C is energized and will<br>
inherently attempt to couple with receive coil B. As a result of the physical separation<br>
and power supply, the receive and transmit coils will not couple unless the tag circuit 101<br>
is within operating range.<br>
As soon as the tag circuit 102 is in range, energy will flow from the transmit coil C into<br>
the input coil G, then through B.<br>
In approximately 0.005 seconds, after the introduction of the tag circuit 102, the system is<br>
fully oscillating and fully functional.<br><br>
Once the system is fully oscillating, the reader circuit 101 outputs the oscillation signal<br>
(containing coded information within the tag circuit) via output line El to a standard<br>
microcontroller E2 which can interpret the signal and base decisions on that information.<br>
The transmit coil C can also be used to produce a specific RF signal which can enable or<br>
disable a special enable bit on each tag as will be explained in greater detail below.<br>
Tag Circuit Design and Function<br>
As indicated, the tag circuit includes a resonant capacitor H, a switching capacitor E and<br>
a logic driven switch F that in combination allows the programmed and cyclical<br>
adjustment of the resonant frequency of the tag circuit.<br>
Generally, the base resonant frequency of the tag circuit is determined by the resonant<br>
capacitor H which in combination with input antenna G and resonant capacitor H creates<br>
a tuned coil that will naturally resonate at a specific or discrete frequency. In preferred<br>
embodiments of the invention, discrete resonant frequencies of the system will be<br>
designed to operate at discrete values in the 72kHz to 900kHz range although it is<br>
understood that the operating frequency range can be expanded if required by the design<br>
of specific product pairs.<br>
The switching capacitor E and logic controlled switch F are in parallel with the resonant<br>
capacitor C and enable the operative change of the resonant frequency of the tag circuit to<br>
a second discrete value. As shown in Figure 2, as the system oscillates, logic controlled<br>
switch F will periodically open and close in accordance with its design such that the<br>
resonant frequency of the tag will change between two discrete values depending on<br>
whether the logic controlled switch is opened or closed.<br>
For example, with the logic switch F open, the system will oscillate at the discrete<br>
resonant frequency of the resonant capacitor H and will produce a steady state oscillation<br>
signal 140 as shown schematically in Figure 2.<br><br><br>
As the logic switch C is closed, the switching capacitor E is switched into the circuit<br>
which will change the discrete resonant frequency of the tag as determined by the<br>
combined capicatance of the resonant capacitor H and switch capacitor E. As the<br>
switching capacitor is switched out of the circuit, the resonant frequency reverts to the<br>
discrete resonant frequency of the resonant capacitor H. Thus, by switching the switching<br>
capacitor into and out of the circuit a representative signal 170 as shown in Figure 2 is<br>
produced.<br>
As the resonant frequency of the tag is changed, a corresponding change in frequency is<br>
measured at receiver coil B which is then delivered to microcontroller output El and<br>
microcontroller E2.<br>
These signals can be processed using known techniques to produce a digital output<br>
shown representatively as 150 (binary signal 111) and 180 (binary signal 101) in Figure<br>
2. Through appropriate coding and microcontroller interpretation as known to those<br>
skilled in the art, the signals can be interpreted and utilized to provide useful output such<br>
as whether a desired product pairing is authentic or not.<br>
Coded Information<br>
With reference to Figure 3, an embodiment of the tag circuit is described that enables<br>
unique identification codes or coded information to be incorporated into the tag circuit.<br>
As shown, an identification system 106 includes identification logic I, switching<br>
capacitor E and resonator logic K.<br>
The identification system 106 generally controls the timing of when the switching<br>
capacitor E is switched into and out of the circuit. More specifically, when the system is<br>
oscillating, the resonator logic K detects the oscillation and then begins to switch the<br>
switching capacitor into and out of the circuit. The time at which E is switched into and<br>
out of the circuit is determined by the identification logic I. The identification logic I is<br><br><br>
operatively connected to the resonator logic K such that the output of the reader 101 to<br>
El produces a patterned frequency corresponding to the identification logic I.<br>
The identification logic I can be pre-programmed or programmed after the circuit 102 is<br>
manufactured. That is, the identification logic can be read-only or programmable.<br>
In certain embodiments, it is desirable to ensure that no two tags have the same ID code<br>
allowing the unique identification of products.<br>
With reference to Figure 4, a representative example of identification logic 200 is<br>
described. It is understood that other identification logic may be utilized as would be<br>
understood by those skilled in the art. That is, any number of protocols or techniques can<br>
be used to provide a unique identification to various products or product pairs.<br>
As shown, the ID code can be subdivided into several sub-sections as depicted in the<br>
legend in Figure 4 including an enable/disable bit, a manufacturer's code, a distributor's<br>
code and a unique serial number.<br>
Representative functionality associated with an ID code is described in the context of a<br>
paper towel dispenser and paper roll refill where the reader circuit 101 is located in the<br>
paper towel dispenser and the tag circuit 102 is located in the paper towel refill. In this<br>
example, the paper towel dispenser is designed to operate with an approved paper towel<br>
roll and includes a microprocessor a) enabling the evaluation of data received from a tag<br>
circuit, b) enabling the determination of the length of time the paper towel roll is operated<br>
in the dispenser and c) having the ability to alter the ID logic within the tag circuit. The<br>
paper towel roll dispenser may be manual or automatic.<br>
In operation, a paper towel roll is installed within the dispenser such that the reader<br>
circuit and tag circuit are physically located adjacent each other. When paper towels are<br>
not being dispensed, no power is delivered to the reader circuit. When a user approaches<br>
and interacts with the dispenser to dispense paper towel, power is switched on to the<br><br><br>
reader circuit allowing the reader circuit and tag circuit to interact and tag data or coded<br>
information to be received by the reader circuit.<br>
After the reader circuit and tag circuit have reached a steady state (ie oscillating), the<br>
microcontroller interprets the data received from the tag circuit. For example, the<br>
microcontroller may check the enable/disable bit to ensure the tag circuit is allowed to<br>
operate within the dispenser or not, and/or the manufacturer, distributor and serial<br>
number codes may also be checked. The receipt of information from the tag circuit<br>
allows the microcontroller to make operating decisions on the basis of that information.<br>
With respect to the enable/disable bit, if the microcontroller recognizes the enable/disable<br>
bit as enabled, the microcontroller may use that information to allow the dispenser to turn<br>
on. If the enable/disable bit is recognized as disabled, the microcontroller would<br>
generally not allow the dispenser to turn on or allow paper towels to be dispensed.<br>
In further embodiments and, in various product pairs, it may be desirable to change the<br>
enable/disable bit from enabled to disabled or from disabled to enabled so as to ensure<br>
that the product pair is operating under the manufacturer's guidelines. For example, it<br>
may be desirable for the microcontroller to disable a tag circuit after a specific time, after<br>
a number of actions have taken place or other criteria set by the manufacturer. In the<br>
paper towel dispenser example, if the paper towel dispenser is programmed to recognize<br>
that an authorized paper roll can deliver 300 meters of paper towel, the enable bit will be<br>
disabled if the microcontroller determines that 300m (plus a suitable allowance) of paper<br>
towel has been dispensed. That is, if the microcontroller of an authorized dispenser<br>
delivers more than 300m of paper towel, this would suggest that the paper roll has been<br>
tampered with and that an unauthorized product may be being used in the dispenser. In<br>
this example, the dispenser would calculate the amount of paper towel dispensed on the<br>
basis of the cumulative, measured time of operation and the known speed of delivery of<br>
the paper towel.<br><br><br>
In other product pairs, appropriate calculations and control mechanisms can be<br>
implemented to prevent the interaction between products if pre-determined conditions of<br>
operation are exceeded or violated.<br>
As another example, in a liquid dispensing system, the system can be used to meter the<br>
quantity of liquid dispensed. For example, if 1 ml of liquid soap is dispensed from a soap<br>
dispenser with each use, a 1000ml dispenser should only be able to operate for 1000<br>
dispenses before requiring to be refilled. Accordingly, microcontroller logic within the<br>
dispenser will detect if the number of uses exceeds the maximum allowable (possibly for<br>
a given serial number) thus enabling operation of the soap dispenser to be stopped if the<br>
number is exceeded.<br>
In a perishable food product pairing, access to the perishable food product may be denied<br>
after an expiry date irrespective of whether the allowed quantity of food has been<br>
dispensed.<br>
The ability to permanently disable a tag can be achieved using known techniques to alter<br>
the state of a specific logic bit such as using a high voltage signal to change the state of a<br>
bit.<br>
Other codes, including a manufacturer's code can be included to allow different<br>
manufacturers of a similar product to have customized identifications. Such information<br>
may be beneficial to ensure that only those manufacturers with approved codes are<br>
producing certain products.<br>
The use of other coded information such as a distributor's code allows a manufacturer to<br>
sub-divide approval for the sale or use of products within a particular geographical<br>
jurisdiction. For example, a manufacturer may license a distributor to sell product within<br>
a particular jurisdiction and not outside that jurisdiction. By incorporating a distributor<br>
code within a tag, a manufacturer can ensure that products can be used in specific<br><br><br>
jurisdictions only by denying those products having an incorrect distribution code from<br>
operating within certain machines.<br>
A unique serial number can also be added to allow for further information to be delivered<br>
back to various databases for data evaluation, data mining, and other purposes.<br>
In still further embodiments, in certain product pairs, the reader may be operatively<br>
connected to the internet enabling the manufacturer to query the product pair for<br>
consumption monitoring so as to enable efficient delivery of replacement product to a<br>
user. For example, in a laser printer connected to a network, the reader and tag system<br>
can monitor toner consumption and automatically report that consumption information<br>
over the network to a manufacturer who can deliver a replacement toner cartridge to the<br>
user before the cartridge runs out. Similar product consumption monitoring can be<br>
accomplished in a wide range of other products so as to facilitate "just in time" inventory<br>
control to a greater range of products.<br>
The manufacture and bulk cost of the technology described herein is significantly<br>
advantaged over past radio frequency (RF) systems wherein the reader circuit and tag<br>
circuit can be manufactured from commonly available, low cost materials as well as<br>
custom low cost CMOS and Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) components.<br>
Tag circuit 102 can be mass produced with the result that the unit cost of the tag circuit<br>
can be lowered to $0.10 or less in bulk quantities. The reader circuit cost can be as little<br>
as $0.50 or less in bulk quantities.<br>
Importantly, the tag circuit does not require its own power supply as the tag circuit<br>
receives sufficient energy from the reader circuit through the coupling process.<br>
Moreover, the reader circuit can be powered by a small low voltage (3 volt) DC battery<br>
that in many applications could provide sufficient power for several years of operation.<br><br><br>
