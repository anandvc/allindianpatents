Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to a catalytic deoxyribonucleic acid that specifically cleaves Hairless Protein mRNA. The invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition containing the oligonucleotides as active ingredients and other pharmaceutically acceptable carriers.<br>
Background of the Invention The Hairless Gene<br>
The hairless mouse,  a frequent subject of different<br>
dermatological experiments, is characterized by hair loss that Starts at the age of 14 days postpartum from the upper eyelids and progresses caudally. The process is completed by the age of 3 weeks, when the mice are entirely naked and never grow hair again (Panteleyev et al.  1998b),  The  phenotype  results  from  proviral integration and consequential aberrant splicing in the mouse hairless gene. Lack of expression of the mouse hairless gene due to inherited mutations leads to the complete loss of hair,.known as atrichia. Other mutations have been identified in other mouse hairless alleles, and its human equivalent, resulting in essentially similar phenotypes  (Ahmad et al. 1998a; Ahmad et al.  1993b; Panteleyev et al. 1998a).   Those studies demonstrated that hairless expression in the hair follicle is necessary for hair cycling,  specifically in the transition to the catagen phase.<br><br><br>
Catalytic Nucleic Acid Molecules<br>
Gene therapy is perhaps the most exciting promise of modern medical science. The technology of replacing mutant genes with correct ones can provide definitive therapy for a number of diseases. There are, however, conditions - inherited and acquired alike - which cannot be treated by the introduction of a new gene. In many cases, the ablation of an already existing gene may be desirable. In, many dominantly inherited diseases, the successful "knock-out" of the mutant gene is, in theory, sufficient to cure the disease. In some other cases, the elimination of a normally functioning, wild-type gene may be necessary for therapeutic gene targeting.<br>
Such is the case in abundant hair growth or hirsutism, in which inhibiting genes which promote hair growth could lead to decreased hair growth and, therefore, improvement. One way to achieve targeted, transient gene suppression is likely going to be through the use of catalytic nucleic acid technology, which includes both ribozymes and DNAzymes.<br>
Ribozymes are RNA structures having a self-catalytic enzymatic function which, together with their sequence-specific and RNA-binding- ability, make them capable of cleaving other RNA molecules at specific target sequences<br>
(Cech  1987).  Recent  success  has  been  achieved  in engineering ribozymes capable of selectively recognizing target sequences carrying different types of mutations, including   single   base-pair   missense   mutations<br>
(Parthasarathy et al. 1999; Sioud and Drlica 1991; Vaish et al. 1998).<br>
These encouraging achievements give new perspective to<br>
experimental strategies using selective mRNA ablation (Phylactou et al. 1998). The different groups of ribozymes described thus far (including hairpin ribozymes, hammerhead ribozymes and group I intron ribozymes (Bartel 1999)) have different characteristics with respect to their mechanism of splicing, splicing efficiency and target specificity. Several studies have used hammerhead ribozymes . to selectively cleave RNA because of the superior target specificity of these ribozymes (Long and Sullenger 1999; Phylactou et al. 1998; Vaish et al. 1998).<br>
Ribozymes can be delivered exogenously, such that the ribozymes are synthesized in vitro. They are usually administered using carrier molecules (Sioud 1996) or without carriers, using ribozymes specially modified to be .nuclease-resistant (Flory et al. 1996) . The other method is endogenous delivery, in which the ribozymes are inserted into a vector (usually a retroviral vector) which is then used to transfect target cells. There are several possible cassette constructs to chose from (Vaish et al. 1998), including the widely used Ul snRNA expression cassette, which proved to be efficient in nuclear expression of hammerhead ribozymes in various experiments (Bertrand et al. 1997; Michienzi et al. 1996; Montgomery and Dietz 1997).<br>
Recent efforts have led to the successful development of small DNA oligonucleotides that have a structure similar to the hammerhead ribozyme (Santoro and Joyce 1997). These  molecules  are  known  as  "deoxy-ribozymes", "deoxyribozymes"  and "DNAzymes", and are virtually DNA equivalents of the hammerhead ribozymes. They consist of a 15 bp catalytic core and two sequence-specif ic arms with a typical length of 5-13 bp each (Santoro and Joyce<br>
1998). Deoxy-ribozymes have more lenient consensus cleavage site requirements than hammerhead ribozymes, and are less likely to degrade when used for in vivo applications. The most widely used type of these novel catalytic molecules is known as the "10-23" deoxy-ribozyme, whose designation originates from the numbering used by its developers (Santoro and Joyce 1997) . Because of their considerable advantages, deoxy-ribozymes have already been used in a wide spectrum of in vitro and in vivo applications (Cairns et al. 2000; Santiago et al. 1999).<br>

Experimental Details<br>
Part I - Catalytic Nucleic Acids Introduction<br>
Catalytic nucleic acid technology is widely used to target mRNA in a sequence-specific fashion, and thus change the expression pattern of cells or tissues. While the goal of mRNA targeting is usually the cleavage of mutant mRNA with the prospect of gene therapy for inherited diseases, in certain instances targeting of wild-type genes can be used therapeutically.<br>
Lack of expression of the mouse hairless gene due to inherited mutations leads to the complete loss of hair, known as atrichia. This study was designed to recapitulate the hairless phenotype in a restricted manner by topical application of deoxy-ribozyme molecules to specifically cleave the mouse hairless mRNA. Pathology samples taken from the treated area at different times demonstrated a decreased number of hair follicles, involution of the remaining follicles, separation of the dermal papillae and the presence of dermal cysts, all characteristics of the hairless phenotype but not normally present in the skin of C57B1/6J mice.<br>
In this study, the hairless phenotype is successfully recapitulated using topically applied target-specific catalytic oligonucleotides designed to cleave the mouse hairless mRNA. Hence, this invention demonstrates the feasibility of using ribozyme and deoxy-ribozyme technology to alter gene expression in the skin via topical application and provide permanent hair removal.<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
Deoxy-ribozyme design and in vitro testing. To target the mouse hairless mRNA, a series of deoxy-ribozymes were designed based on the consensus cleavage sites 5'-RY-3' in the mRNA sequence (GenBank Accession^: AF039196)(Ahmad et al.. 1998a). Only those potential cleavage sites which were located on an open loop of the mRNA according to the RNA folding software RNADRaw 2.1 were targeted (Matzura and Wennborg 1996) . The deoxy-ribozyme design utilized the previously described structure (Santoro and Joyce 1997; Santoro and Joyce 1998) where two sequence-specific arms were attached to a catalytic core based on the mouse hairless mRNA sequence. The deoxy-ribozymes were -custom synthesized (Life Technologies). Commercially available mouse brain polyA-RNA (Ambion) served as a template in the in vitro cleavage reaction to test the efficiency of the deoxy-ribozymes. 800 ng RNA template were incubated in the presence of 20mM Mg2* and RNAse Out RNAse inhibitor (Life Technologies) at pH 7.5 with 2 ^g deoxy-ribozyme for one hour. After incubation, aliquots of the reaction were used as templates for RT-PCR, amplifying regions including the targeted cleavage sites. The RT-PCR products were visualized on an ethidium bromide-containing 2% agarose gel under UV light, and the intensity of the products was determined as described above (Figure 3) . Those deoxy-ribozymes that were capable of cleaving the target mouse hairless mRNA with the highest efficiency were used for in vivo experiments (Figure 3, lanes 1, 3).<br>
Deoxy-ribozyme treatment schedule. Newborn C57B1/6J mice were treated with a deoxy-ribozyme formula twice a day starting on the first day after delivery. As the mice<br>
started to grow hair, hair shafts were regularly shortened using an electric clipper to make the skin surface accessible and to enhance the penetration of the treatment formula. For each treatment, 2 /zg deoxy-ribozyme, dissolved in a 85% EtOH and 15% ethylene glycol vehicle, were applied to a one square centimeter area on the back. During application and for a fifteen minute period after, the mice were placed in temporary restraint to prevent removal of the formula. Control animals were treated with vehicle containing oligonucleotides of the same length but of random sequence. The treatment continued until the mice were sacrificed for evaluation.<br>
Biopsy Procedures and Pathology. The mice were humanely euthanized after 28 days, 35 days or 8 weeks of treatment. The entire treatment area, together with an equal sized non-treated neighboring area of skin, were removed, fixed in formalin solution, embedded and processed for pathology using standard procedures.<br>
Results<br>
To evaluate the feasibility of using topically applied deoxy-ribozymes for selective ablation of genes expressed in the hair follicle, a model system was used to recapitulate the hairless mouse phenotype. After secondary structure based target-site selection, the choices were narrowed for targeting oligonucleotides using a novel in vitro cleavage assay (Cserhalmi-Friedman et al. manuscript in preparation) . The three deoxy-ribozymes that proved to be the most efficient in cutting full-length mouse hairless mRNA in vitro were used for the in vivo experiments.<br>
After continuous treatment, by day 20 the hair of the<br>
treated animals became visibly sparse on the treated area. Pathology specimens taken from the treated area at day 28 (see Figures 2A - 2D) demonstrated (i) a decreased number of hair follicles, (ii) several dense, basophilic cell groups in the dermis corresponding to dermal papillae by morphology and localization, and (iii) an absence of surrounding epithelial hair follicle tissues and related hair follicles. The remaining hair follicles were in telogen phase, in sharp contrast with the advanced anagen follicles of the surrounding untreated skin and the skin of the untreated control animals.<br>
Samples taken from the treated area at day 35 showed a different result. Some follicles in telogen phase could be observed, although they were more sparse than in the surrounding untreated area or in the samples from the untreated control animals. In the dermis of the treated region, large epithelial cysts filled with amorphous material were noticed, which corresponded to dermal cysts. These characteristics, the arrest of hair cycling, involution of hair follicles, detachment of dermal papillae and development of dermal cysts are not normally present in C57B1/6J mice, but represent the cardinal features of the skin of the hairless mouse.<br>
The data revealed here demonstrate that by using topically applied catalytic oligonucleotides, a key player of hair follicle regulation can be eliminated and hair follicle cycling can be disrupted. These results serve not only as a proof of principle for future use of this approach for hair removal, but also demonstrate the feasibility of using topical catalytic nucleic acid technology to successfully change the gene expression pattern of hair follicle cells at the mRNA level, and thus influence the hair phenotype.<br>
Pa-rt- TI - Antispnse Nuclp-ir Acids<br>
Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized as directed to the inhibition of Hairless expression based on the Hairless mRNA sequence (SEQ ID N0:l) . Cos-1 cells were transfected with the pEGFP full-length Hairless construct, and cells were harvested 16 hours after transfection. Total protein lysate was analyzed on a 10% SDS PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. Hairless protein was detected using an anti-Hairless polyclonal antibody raised against a C-terminal peptide. In a negative control, cells not transfected with the full-length Hairless construct showed no Hairless expression. Hairless expression was clearly observed in positive control experiments when antisense oligodeoxynucleotides were not added. Experiments where anti-Hairless antisense oligonucleotides (i.e. ODN1: 5' GCTGGGCATACTCTCCAT 3' (SEQ ID NO: 26) and ODN2 : 5' CATCACTCTCCTGCCCTC 3' (SEQ ID NO: 27)) were added to the medium at 40 /iM concentration prior to the transf ection clearly showed an absence of Hairless expression, demonstrating antisense oligodeoxynucleotide inhibition of the Hairless gene product (see Figure 4) .<br><br>
