Method for analyzing amplified nucleic acids<br>
The invention relates	to a method for analyzing amplified<br>
nucleic acids in a	microfluidic device. The invention<br>
furthermore relates to	an arrangement for carrying out such a<br>
method.<br>
Prior Art<br>
DNA analysis by hybridization is a known method in molecular<br>
biology (cf. "Gentechnische Methoden", ["Genetic Engineering<br>
Methods"], G. Gassen and G. Schrimpf, Spektrum Akademischer<br>
Verlag Heidelberg, 1999, pages 243 to 261). This technique<br>
plays an important part in the detection of specific nucleic<br>
acids, e.g. in the molecular diagnosis of single point<br>
mutations (single nucleotide polymorphism, SNP). In this case,<br>
a probe oligonucleotide comprising a sequence of e.g.<br>
approximately 20 nucleotides is used to bind to nucleic acids<br>
that differ only in a single nucleotide. It is noted that in<br>
the present context the expression "nucleic acids" is intended<br>
to encompass a nucleic acid sequence, e.g. a DNA sequence or<br>
RNA sequence. Given a suitable choice of the hybridization<br>
conditions (in particular temperature and salt concentration),<br>
the probe oligonucleotide selectively binds the non-mutated<br>
variant of the nucleic acid, while the nucleic acid variant<br>
having the single point mutation does not bind, or binds only<br>
weakly. Detection of single point mutations is thereby<br>
possible. On account of the small differences in terms of<br>
binding energy between the variant without a mutation (that is<br>
to say the wild type) and the mutant, the reaction conditions<br>
with regard to temperature and also composition and salt<br>
concentration of the reaction solution have to satisfy exact<br>
stipulations.<br><br>
Since the corresponding nucleic acids in the sample material<br>
(e.g. blood) are usually not available in<br><br>
sufficient quantity or concentration, it is necessary to<br>
amplify the nucleic acids to be examined. This amplification<br>
can be effected in a sequence-specific manner by various<br>
methods known in molecular biology, e.g. by SDA (strand<br>
displacement amplification), described in Walker, GT, et al.r<br>
"Strand Displacement Amplification, an isothermal, in vitro DNA<br>
Amplification Technique", Nucleic Acids Research, 1992, 20,<br>
1961 to 96; by TMA (transcription mediated amplification) ,<br>
described in www.gen-probe.com/sci tech/tma.htm; or by<br>
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), described in US 4 683 195,<br>
inter alia. One problem here is that the composition of the<br>
reaction solution of the amplification reaction, and hence the<br>
"amplification crude product", does not have the composition,<br>
and in particular salt concentrations, required for<br>
hybridization. For molecular diagnosis, it may additionally be<br>
necessary to selectively separate the hybrids formed in a<br>
subsequent process (melting) e.g. by increasing the<br>
temperature. In order to enable hybridization processes with a<br>
high yield, a high concentration of monovalent cations (e.g.<br>
Na+ ions) is necessary, inter alia. Monovalent cations promote<br>
the formation of the double helix structure during the<br>
hybridization reaction.<br>
However, the reaction mixtures of the amplification reactions,<br>
e.g. for a PCR reaction, contain a low concentration of<br>
monovalent cations. Furthermore, PCR reaction buffers have a<br>
relatively high concentration (a few mM) of Mg2+ ions, which,<br>
during the hybridization to detection probes, adversely affect<br>
the binding of probes and complimentary strands to form<br>
complete hybrids, can bring about an extension of the probes by<br>
polymerase activity and, during a subsequent melting process,<br>
bring about a stabilization of double strands and make melting<br>
more difficult, which leads to "washed out" melting curves at<br>
high temperatures.<br><br>
In accordance with the prior art, amplification products are<br>
therefore purified before the hybridization reaction; in this<br>
case, all components that disturb a hybridization reaction<br>
(inter alia polymerase, primers, nucleotides, salts) are<br>
removed and the concentration of Na+ ions is increased. This<br>
purification process is relatively complicated and is usually<br>
effected by non-specific binding of the nucleic acids to a<br>
solid phase (by means of so-called purification columns),<br>
washing of the amplification product on the column and<br>
dissolution from the solid phase or by phenol/chloroform<br>
extraction or similar methods. Particularly when carrying out<br>
nucleic acid analyses in microfluidic devices, wherein all the<br>
reaction processes proceed in an integrated manner and in a<br>
small space, the purification methods that are customary in the<br>
prior art are not appropriate since their realization is too<br>
complicated, under these circumstances.<br>
Statement of Object<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a simple<br>
and cost-effective method which enables the efficient<br>
conditioning of amplified nucleic acids for further method<br>
steps, requires no additional binding or washing steps and can<br>
be realized with a simple fluidics concept.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
Expressed in general terms, the concept of the invention<br>
resides in amplifying a sample with nucleic acids and admixing<br>
the sample containing the amplification crude product with a<br>
suitable additive in order to condition the amplification crude<br>
product for further method steps, e.g. further analysis steps.<br>
Adding the additive avoids the need to purify the amplified<br>
nucleic acids. This method is particularly suitable for use in<br>
microfluidic devices, in which uncomplicated method sequences<br>
with a simple fluidics concept<br><br>
are preferred. According to the invention, the additive<br>
comprises monovalent cations and an Mg2+ ion-binding agent.<br>
Such an additive is suitable in particular for conditioning<br>
amplified nucleic acids for a subsequent hybridization to probe<br>
oligonucleotides.<br>
According to the invention, the object is achieved in<br>
particular by means of the method in accordance with patent<br>
claim 1. Advantageous developments are specified in the<br>
dependent method claims. An associated arrangement for carrying<br>
out the method according to the invention is the subject matter<br>
of patent claim 17. Developments of this arrangement are<br>
specified in the dependent arrangement claims.<br>
The present invention provides, in particular, a method for<br>
analyzing amplified nucleic acids in a microfluidic device,<br>
comprising the following steps:<br>
a)	amplifying nucleic acids in a first chamber in the<br>
microfluidic device;<br>
b)	contacting the amplified nucleic acids with an additive,<br>
comprising:<br>
i) monovalent cations and<br>
ii) an Mg2+ ion-binding agent,<br>
wherein the additive is provided in a second chamber in the<br>
microfluidic device; and<br>
c)	hybridizing the amplified nucleic acids to at least one<br>
probe oligonucleotide.<br>
The expression "microfluidic" denotes methods which comprise<br>
the handling of fluids having volumes in the microliters range.<br>
The microfluidic device is preferably embodied as a cartridge,<br>
that is to say as a flat structure<br><br>
having the form of a card, with	depressions formed therein<br>
which form channels and chambers	or cavities through which<br>
liquids can be moved in accordance	with predetermined reaction<br>
sequences or schemes.<br>
Monovalent cations comprise e.g. Li+, Na+, Ka+, and are present<br>
in the additive according to the invention preferably in the<br>
form of Na+ ions. An Mg2+ ion-binding agent should be understood<br>
to mean all substances that bind Mg2+ ions, in particular<br>
complexing agents, e.g. Chelate complexing agents such as EGTA<br>
or EDTA. The additive used in the method according to the<br>
invention preferably comprises EDTA. Furthermore, the additive<br>
preferably comprises a binder, e.g. polyvinylpyrrolidone.<br>
Further auxiliaries, e.g. buffer substances, surface-active<br>
substances, or the like, can likewise be provided.<br>
In accordance with one preferred aspect of the invention, the<br>
additive in the second chamber is provided as a dry reagent and<br>
is kept therein in storage-stable fashion.<br>
Preferably, the probe oligonucleotides are immobilized as a<br>
microarray on a carrier in the microfluidic device.<br>
In accordance with a first embodiment of the method of the<br>
present invention, the additive is transferred from the second<br>
chamber to the first chamber (the amplification chamber) in<br>
order to contact the additive with the amplified nucleic acids.<br>
If the additive is provided as a dry reagent in the second<br>
chamber in this embodiment of the method according to the<br>
invention, it is expedient to dissolve the additive using a<br>
solvent, e.g. water. The dissolved additive can then be<br>
transferred from the second chamber to the first chamber in<br>
order to be mixed there with the amplification crude product.<br>
In accordance with a second embodiment of the present<br>
invention, after amplification has been effected, the amplified<br><br>
nucleic acids in the reaction solution are transferred from the<br>
first chamber to the second chamber and then conducted as a<br>
mixture with the additive to the probe oligonucleotides. If the<br>
additive is provided as a dry reagent in the second chamber, it<br>
can be dissolved directly by the reaction solution pumped into<br>
the second chamber with the amplification crude product.<br>
According to the invention, it is preferred for the nucleic<br>
acids to be amplified by PCR reaction.<br>
In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention,<br>
the amplified nucleic acids hybridized to the probe<br>
oligonucleotides are then preferably detected. This detection<br>
can be effected for example using a label (a marking) of the<br>
amplified nucleic acids. The label can be an optical label; it<br>
can also be an enzymatic label, for example. An enzymatic<br>
reaction can be catalyzed by an enzymatic label, which reaction<br>
can be detected e.g. optically or electrochemically. According<br>
to the invention, preferably an electrochemical detection is<br>
carried out, which particularly preferably comprises a current<br>
measurement amplified by means of redox cycling.<br>
In particular, the invention furthermore relates to an<br>
arrangement for carrying out the method according to the<br>
invention, which is provided in a microfluidic device,<br>
comprising a first chamber, which is designed for the<br>
amplification of nucleic acids, and a second chamber, in which<br>
the additive described above is kept in storage-stable fashion,<br>
wherein the second chamber can be connected in fluid<br>
communication via a connection to the first chamber.<br>
Preferably, the arrangement comprises a microarray arrangement<br>
having probe oligonucleotides immobilized on a carrier.<br>
The connection between the first and second chambers can be<br>
embodied in the form of a line or a channel, and<br><br>
can preferably be selectively opened and closed, e.g. by means<br>
of a valve, such that fluid can selectively be transferred from<br>
the first to the second chamber, or from the second to the<br>
first chamber. Furthermore, means can be provided for<br>
introducing a solvent into the second chamber, e.g. in the form<br>
of an inlet channel to the second chamber.<br>
Preferably, the microarray arrangement is assigned means for<br>
detecting hybridized nucleic acids, which enable an optical or<br>
electrochemical detection, for example. Electrochemical<br>
detection means which are designed for measuring currents<br>
and/or potentials are particularly preferred. The optical<br>
detection means can comprise e.g. a transparent region of the<br>
device, through which e.g. optical absorption or fluorescence<br>
excitation and detection can be read out. The electrochemical<br>
detection means preferably enable the measurement of potentials<br>
and/or currents and can comprise an electrode system onto which<br>
the probe oligonucleotides are immobilized (spotted) at each<br>
detection spot, as described for example in the documents<br>
DE 101 26 341 Al or DE 100 58 397 Al.<br>
Furthermore, corresponding means, e.g. in the form of<br>
corresponding chambers and/or channels, can be provided for<br>
storing and/or passing on reagents for the detection, e.g.<br>
enzyme or enzyme substrate, in the microfluidic device.<br>
Means for supplying heat and/or dissipating heat are preferably<br>
assigned to the first chamber (that is to say the amplification<br>
chamber). Said means can comprise a region having increased<br>
thermal conductivity in the microfluidic device, which region<br>
can be realized for example by the microfluidic device being<br>
embodied in particularly thin-walled fashion in said region.<br>
However, it is also conceivable for an element<br><br>
that generates or dissipates heat to be provided in the<br>
microfluidic device itself.<br>
Exemplary embodiment<br>
Further features and advantages of the present invention will<br>
become apparent from the following description of figures in<br>
association with the exemplary embodiments and with reference<br>
to the appended drawings, which are merely by way of example<br>
and illustrative.<br>
In the figures:<br>
figure 1 shows a diagrammatic illustration of the method<br>
according to the invention;<br>
figure 2 shows a schematic illustration of an arrangement<br>
for carrying out the method of the invention in<br>
accordance with a first embodiment;<br>
figure 3 shows a schematic illustration of an arrangement<br>
for carrying out the method of the invention in<br>
accordance with a second embodiment;<br>
figure 4 shows an excerpt from a schematic illustration<br>
of a cartridge with the arrangement in<br>
accordance with figure 2;<br>
figure 5 shows a comparative illustration of melting<br>
curves of hybridized nucleic acids without the<br>
use of the method according to the invention;<br>
and<br><br>
figure 6 shows a comparative illustration of melting<br>
curves of hybridized nucleic acids with the use<br>
of the method according to the invention.<br>
Figure 1 schematically illustrates the basic concept of the<br>
method according to the invention for analyzing nucleic acids<br><br>
in a microfluidic device. In accordance with the prior art it<br>
is known to purify amplification crude products prior to<br>
hybridization. This constitutes a subtractive method, that is<br>
to say that disturbing components (polymerase, primers,<br>
nucleotides) are removed from the solution containing the<br>
amplification crude product. By contrast, the method according<br>
to the invention is an additive method, that is to say that an<br>
additive is added to the amplification crude product, which<br>
additive enables an improved hybridization reaction, or a<br>
subsequent improved, selective separation of the hybrids. In<br>
this case it is unimportant whether the additive is added to<br>
the amplification crude product or the amplification crude<br>
product is added to the additive; what is crucial primarily is<br>
that a mixture of amplification crude product and additive is<br>
used for the hybridization reaction.<br>
Figure 2 shows an arrangement for carrying out the method<br>
according to the invention in accordance with a first<br>
embodiment with a first chamber 10a and a second chamber 20a.<br>
After the amplification reaction has taken place, the additive<br>
in solution is pumped from the second chamber 20a (the additive<br>
chamber) into the first chamber 10a (the amplification reaction<br>
chamber). If the additive in the second chamber is provided as<br>
a dry reagent, firstly a solvent (water) is pumped into the<br>
second chamber 20a in order to dissolve the dry reagent, and<br>
then the solvent is transferred to the first chamber 10a<br>
(amplification reaction chamber).<br>
Figure 3 shows an arrangement for carrying out the method<br>
according to the invention in accordance with a second<br>
embodiment with a first chamber 10b and second chamber 20b. In<br>
this case, the opposite procedure to the method implementation<br>
described above takes place: after the amplification reaction,<br>
the amplification crude product is conducted from the first<br><br>
chamber 10b (the amplification reaction chamber) into the<br>
second chamber 20b (the additive chamber) and intermixed there<br>
with the additive. If the additive is present as a dry reagent,<br><br>
the amplification crude product is pumped over the dry reagent<br>
and dissolves the latter.<br>
In both embodiments, the mixture of amplification crude product<br>
and additive is then transferred to the microarray for<br>
hybridization.<br>
Figure 4 shows an arrangement in accordance with the embodiment<br>
shown in figure 2. Figure 4 shows a cartridge 101, made from a<br>
plastic material. Channels 130, 150, 160, chambers 110, 120,<br>
140 and depressions 121 are provided in the cartridge 101. The<br>
plastic cartridge can be embodied simply with upwardly open<br>
channels, depressions and chambers and can be covered with a<br>
film after the reagents have been spotted on, whereby the<br>
channels, depressions and chambers incorporated into the<br>
surface of the cartridge are closed off. In the first chamber<br>
110, which can be filled via the inlet channel 160, nucleic<br>
acids are amplified by PCR reaction, for example. This is done<br>
by inserting the cartridge into a corresponding device, such<br>
that the chamber 110 can be heated and/or cooled, e.g. by<br>
Peltier elements situated in the device. The additive,<br>
comprising EDTA and sodium chloride, is present as a dry<br>
reagent in the depressions 121 in the second chamber 120, which<br>
is embodied as a channel. At one of its ends, the chamber 120<br>
can be closed by a valve 122. This can be embodied for example<br>
as a simple pinch valve. After the PCR reaction has taken<br>
place, water is pumped into the chamber 120, and the additive<br>
stored as a dry reagent is thereby dissolved. Afterward, the<br>
valve 122 is opened and the dissolved additive can then be<br>
pumped into the amplification chamber 110, where the dissolved<br>
additive intermixes with the amplification crude product, and<br>
the mixture is then pumped via the channel 130 into the<br>
hybridization chamber 140, in which a microarray with probe<br>
oligonucleotides immobilized on a carrier is provided. By a<br>
suitable choice of the fluidics, e.g. geometry or flow rates,<br>
it is possible to realize the effect whereby<br><br>
firstly unchanged amplification product is conveyed at the<br>
beginning of the pumping process and additive substances are<br>
increasingly admixed only upon further pumping. Consequently, a<br>
possibly advantageous rising concentration gradient of additive<br>
substances can be pumped into the hybridization chamber. The<br>
hybridization reaction can then take place in this chamber.<br>
Excess solution is fed via the outlet channel 150 to a waste<br>
container. Further chambers and channels can be provided (not<br>
shown) on the cartridge in order e.g. to keep ready reagents<br>
for the detection of the bound nucleic acids, such as, for<br>
instance, enzyme or enzyme substrate.<br>
Example<br>
An injection-molded plastic card of the type shown in figure 4<br>
was used for recording the curves shown in figures 5 and 6, in<br>
which card dry reagent was spotted on in the depressions 121.<br>
In order to evaluate the method according to the invention, the<br>
gene factor V wild type (FcV wild type) and the single point<br>
mutation factor V Leiden (FcV Leiden) were amplified by PCR so<br>
as to obtain a PCR product having a size of 168 bp. The gene<br>
product of the factor V gene is a protein of the blood<br>
coagulation cascade, and the mutation is described in Bertima<br>
et al., Nature, 1994; 369(6475):64-7.<br>
The DNA sample is introduced into the first chamber<br>
(amplification chamber) 110 and the PCR reaction is carried<br>
out. The channel 120 with the depressions 121 is filled with<br>
water, and the dry reagent is thereby dissolved. The additive<br>
spotted on as a dry reagent is dimensioned such that a solution<br>
comprising 0.23M NaCl, 0.1M EDTA results upon addition of<br>
approximately 25 u.1 of water. This ensures a sufficient<br>
concentration of monovalent cations and the minimization of the<br>
concentration of free Mg2+ by complexing. Furthermore, a buffer<br><br>
substance is added to the additive, such that the solution is<br>
adjusted to a pH value of pH=8. After the end of the PCR<br>
reaction, as a result of the dissolved additive flowing<br><br>
into the first chamber 110, the PCR crude product<br>
(amplification crude product) is mixed with the additive, and<br>
the mixture is forwarded into the chamber 140, in which a<br>
microarray arrangement is situated. Biotinylated PCR products<br>
are obtained by using biotinylated primers during the PCR<br>
reaction. Probe oligonucleotides which can be used to<br>
discriminate between FcV wild type and FcV Leiden are spotted<br>
on the microarray arrangement. The probe oligonucleotides are<br>
chosen such that some spots carry probe oligonucleotides which<br>
perfectly match FcV wild type, while other spots carry probe<br>
oligonucleotides which perfectly match FcV Leiden. If the PCR<br>
product contains FcV wild type sequences, for example, then<br>
they form a "perfect match"' (a complete pairing of strand and<br>
counter strand) with the wild type probes, but a "single base<br>
mismatch", having a lower binding strength, with the FcV Leiden<br>
probes. The PCR products bound to probe molecules are rinsed<br>
with a washing solution containing a streptavidin-conjugated<br>
enzyme (alkaline phosphatase). The enzyme binds to the<br>
biotinylated PCR products bound on the microarray arrangement.<br>
The microarray arrangement is then rinsed with a substrate<br>
solution containing p-aminophenyl phosphate. The p-aminophenyl<br>
phosphate is converted to p-aminophenol by the alkaline<br>
phosphatase and the p-aminophenol formed is oxidized to form<br>
quinone imine in a redox reaction at electrodes of the<br>
microarray arrangement and the p-aminophenol/quinone imine<br>
redox pair is cyclized, which leads to a measurable current<br>
rise at the electrodes. This current rise (dl/dT) is<br>
proportional to the amount of bound PCR product. The<br>
temperature is then increased step by step over a temperature<br>
range by approximately 20°C to approximately 60°C, which leads<br>
to a progressive melting of the hybrids at relatively high<br>
temperatures (starting from approximately 25°C), wherein the<br>
PCR products with single point mutations which have a mismatch<br>
in the hybrid melt significantly more rapidly than the "perfect<br>
match" hybrids, the wild type hybrids in the example. This<br>
results in a detectable signal difference between the<br><br>
wild type (perfect match) and the single point mutant (single<br>
base mismatch). The summary of a plurality of experiments is<br>
illustrated in the curves 31a, 31b, 32a, 32b shown in figures 5<br>
and 6. The signal strength is illustrated as a function of the<br>
temperature. The curves 31a, 31b show the melting curves for<br>
FcV wild type and the curves 32a, 32b show the melting curves<br>
for FcV Leiden. It can readily be recognized that with the use<br>
of the method according to the invention with the added<br>
additive, the melting curves 31b, 32b (figure 6) are<br>
reproducible significantly better (that is to say lie closer<br>
together in each case for FcV wild type and FcV Leiden) and<br>
more distinctive signal differences result than without the use<br>
of the method according to the invention, 31a, 32a (figure 5).<br>
Primarily at relatively high temperatures (T&gt;35°C), the hybrids<br>
melt significantly more cleanly. One advantageous property of<br>
this method could be that the concentration of NaCl and EDTA in<br>
the chamber 140 (the detection chamber) rises during the<br>
hybridization.<br>
It is emphasized that the exemplary embodiment described is<br>
merely by way of example, and many kinds of variations with<br>
regard to the type and concentration of the additive, the type<br>
of detection and the reaction implementation are conceivable.<br><br>
