COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"POWER SUPPLYING APPARATUS FOR VEHICLE"<br><br><br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The following specijfication particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br>
[DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION]<br>
[Technical Field to Which the Invention Pertains] This invention relates to a power supplying apparatus for a vehicle which improves the starting performance of an engine of a vehicle in which a battery is incorporated. [O-O-e^f [Prior Art]<br>
As a power supplying apparatus for a vehicle wherein electric power obtained from a generator is not supplied to some electric load upon starting of an engine an apparatus disclosed, for example, in the official gazette of Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 103112/1995, entitled "Electrical Equipment Starting Load Reduction Control Device for a Battery-less Vehicle", is known.<br>
In FIG. T  of the official gazette mentioned above, an electrical equipment starting load reduction control device 1 is disclosed wherein a generated voltage of a<br><br><br>
generator 3 is supplied to an ignition system 4 and load power supply control means 5 and power is supplied from the load power supply control means 5 to another load 6 through switch means 7.<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
For example, if the electrical equipment starting load reduction control device 1 described above is provided with a battery, then, upon starting of the engine, the battery is connected to the generator 3, and simultaneously when the engine begins to rotate, the generator starts charging of the battery. IDJXQS-]<br>
For example, in a so-called "battery exhaustion" state wherein the electric amount of the battery upon starting of the engine is very poor, the engine is obliged to be started by a kick-starter.<br>
In this instance, parts of a fuel supply system and an ignition system necessary to start the engine must be driven with power generated by the generator activated by the kick-starter, and simultaneously, charging power is supplied also to the battery. Accordingly, it can be considered that it is difficult to assure the voltage for driving the parts of the fuel supply system and the<br><br>
ignition system because of the supply of power to the battery and starting of the engine is difficult.<br>
Therefore, the object of the present invention resides in Improvement in starting performance of an engine of a vehicle in which a battery and a kick starting apparatus are incorporated.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
In order to attain the object described above, according to claim 1, a power supplying apparatus for a vehicle which includes a battery for supplying power to an electric load, an AC generator for generating electric power to be used to charge the battery and supplying power to the electric load when the amount of electricity of the battery is insufficient, and a kick starting apparatus for being kicked to rotate the AC generator to start an engine is characterized in that switch means for switching on/off electric connection between the battery and the AC generator is provided for a circuit which interconnects the battery and the AC generator, and the switch means is switched off by control means when the kick starting apparatus is used to start the engine. [J3 00 8]<br><br>
Upon starting of the engine, the switch means interposed between the battery and the AC generator is switched off by the control means so that electric power generated by the AC generator is not supplied to the battery but is supplied to parts of a fuel supply system and an ignition system to assure a voltage necessary to activate the parts of the fuel supply system and the ignition system, and consequently, the engine can be started well irrespective of the state of the battery.<br><br>
According to claim 2, the power supplying apparatus for a vehicle is characterized in that the control means controls the switching on/off of the switch means and simultaneously controls electric connection between the AC generator and a general load such as a lighting system.<br>
[.oaij&amp;^<br>
Since, upon starting of the engine, the connection between the AC generator and the battery is cut by the switch means and the connection between the AC generator and the general load is cut simultaneously, a, voltage necessary to activate the fuel supply system and the ignition system is ensured sufficiently, and the starting performance of the engine is further improved.<br><br>
According to claim 3, the power supplying apparatus for a vehicle is characterized in that the AC generator functions also as a starter motor and the power supplying apparatus includes changeover contact means on the AC generator side of the switch means, and the changeover contact means includes a first fixed contact electrically connected to the switch means, a second fixed contact directly connected to the battery for allowing power to be supplied from the battery to the AC generator, and a movable contact capable of being switchably connected to the first fixed contact and the second fixed contact and connected to the AC generator.<br>
If the movable contact of the changeover contact means is connected to the first fixed contact side, then the AC generator can be connected to the battery through the changeover contact means and the switch means to charge the battery, but if the movable contact is connected to the second fixed contact side, then power can be supplied from the battery to the AC generator so that the AC generator can act as a starter motor. Consequently, while the starting performance is assured, the AC generator and the starter motor can be used commonly, and the system becomes compact.<br><br><br>
According to claim 4, the power supplying apparatus for a vehicle is characterized in that the AC generator functions also as a starter motor, and a starter relay for starting the AC generator is connected in parallel to the switch means.<br>
[•Q^rtt]<br>
By activating the starter relay, the battery can be connected to the AC generator to supply electric power from the battery to the AC generator to start the AC generator, but by switching the switch means off, the battery can be disconnected from the AC generator so that power may not be supplied from the AC generator to the battery.  Consequently, since the object can be achieved using a starter relay for universal use without provision of changeover means for exclusive use, the system is produced at a reduced cost.  Further, the system becomes compact by common use of the AC generator and the starter motor.<br>
According to claim 5, the power supplying apparatus for a vehicle is characterized in that the control means is electrically connected to the battery side and the AC generator side through a main switch, and a first diode<br><br>
for allowing energization from the battery to the control means but preventing reverse current is provided for a circuit from the main switch to the control means while a second diode for allowing energization from the AC generator to the control means but preventing reverse current is provided for a circuit from the main switch to the AC generator.<br>
If the main switch is switched on, then power is supplied from both of the battery and the AC generator to the control means, and generated power of the AC generator does not flow into the battery at all. Therefore, even when the amount of electricity of the battery is insufficient, power can be supplied from the AC generator to the control means to start up the control means, and a good starting performance can be maintained.<br>
Further, the directions of electric current to flow from the battery and the AC generator to the control means are always fixed by the first and second diodes thereby to protect the control means.<br><br>
According to the present invention there is provided a power supplying apparatus for a vehicle comprising a battery for supplying power to an electric load, an AC generator for generating electric power to be used to charge said battery and supplying power to the electric load when the amount of electricity of said batteiy is insufficient, and a kick starting apparatus to rotate said AC generator to start an engine, characterized in that<br>
switch means for switching on/off electric connection between said battery and said AC generator is provided for a circuit which interconnects said battery and said AC generator, and said switch means is switched off by control means when said kick starting apparatus is used to start said engine.<br>

The starter switch 12 includes a first fixed contact 66 connected to the main switch 13, a second fixed contact 67 connected to the control means 55, and a movable contact 68 which can be connected to the first and second fixed contacts 66 and 67 or can be disconnected from the first and second fixed contacts 66 and 67.<br>

The antitheft switch section 73 is connected to an antitheft apparatus not shown, and exhibits an off state when the movable contact 72 of the main switch 13 is<br><br>
connected to the fixed contact 71 (on) but exhibits an on state when the movable contact 72 is disconnected from the fixed contact 71 (off).<br>
The fuel pump 27 is formed from an electric motor 74 and a pump body 75 driven by the electric motor 74.<br>
The AC generator 33 is of the three-phase AC generation type and includes stator coils 33a from which an output is extracted.  The AC generator 33 functions also as a starter motor for starting the engine by supplying power from the battery 21 to the AC generator 33.<br>
The battery disconnection relay 42 includes a switch section 78 formed from a fixed contact 76 connected to the main fuse 41 and a movable contact 77 which can be connected to or disconnected from the fixed contact 76 and is connected to the starter relay 43, and a coil 81 for switching on or off the switch section 78. The switch section 78 exhibits an off state when the coil 81 is not energized, but exhibits an on state when the coil 81 is energized.<br>
The starter relay 43 includes a switch section 85<br><br>
having a first fixed contact 82 connected to the battery-disconnection relay 42, a second fixed contact 83 connected to the battery 21, and a movable contact 84 which can be connected to or disconnected from the first and second fixed contacts 82 and 83, and a coil 86 for changing over the connection of the movable contact 84 to the first and second fixed contacts 82 and 83.  The movable contact 84 is connected to the first fixed contact 82 when the coil 86 is not energized, but the movable contact 84 is connected to the seconds fixed contact 83 when the coil 86 is energized.<br>
The boost rectification circuit 44 is formed from the FETs 45 to 50 described above, diodes 91 to 96 which are parasitic diodes of the FETs 45 to 50, and a capacitor 101 connected between output terminal sections 97 and 98. The diodes 91 to 96 form a three-phase full wave rectification circuit, and the FETs 45 to 50 form a switching circuit for a chopper.<br>
The FETs 45 to 50 and the FETs 62 to 64 are N channel MOS type FETs (Field Effect Transistor), in each of which the drain current which flows between the drain and the source is controlled by a gate voltage applied<br><br>
betv/een the gate and the source.<br>
The FET driving means 53 receives a pulse signal from the oscillator 54 or the control means 55, and supplies a driving signal of a rectangular waveform to the gates of the FETs 45 to 50 in synchronism with the frequency of the pulse signal.<br>
The oscillator 54 is started up when the voltage supplied from the battery 21 or the AC generator 33 reaches an oscillator startup voltage, and generates oscillation pulses having a predetermined amplitude, pulse width, and time interval, that is, the oscillator 54 generates an oscillation pulse signal with the oscillator startup voltage or more.<br>
[€030]<br>
The control means 55 controls on or off of the FETs 62 to 64 as switches, and includes a central processing unit (CPU) 55a (hereinafter referred to as "CPU 55a"). The CPU 55a includes a clock generator not shown which generates periodical pulses of a fixed interval of time.<br>
[M-5TJ-<br>
The CPU 55a is started up when the voltage supplied from the battery 21 or the AC generator 33 reaches a CPU<br><br>
startup voltage and generates pulses (the pulses are referred to as "CPU pulses") having a predetermined amplitude, pulse width, and time interval based on a pulse signal of the clock generator, that is, the CPU 55a generates a CPU pulse signal with the CPU startup voltage or more.<br>
Further, while the CPU 55a generates the CPU pulse signal only for a predetermined time after the generation of the CPU pulse signal is started, if an ignition pulse signal from an ignition pulse generation apparatus not shown is detected within a predetermined time, generation of the CPU pulse signal is continued until the engine speed reaches a predetermined value or more or the battery voltage reaches a predetermined value or more also after the predetermined time.  Then, when the engine speed becomes a predetermined value or less or when rotation of the engine stops, the CPU 55a ends generation of the CPU pulse signal.<br>
The first diode 56 allows current to flow only in a direction from the battery 21 to the main switch 13 side, but does not allow current to flow in the other direction from the AC generator 33 to the battery 21.<br><br>
The second diode 57 allows current to flow only in a direction from the AC generator 33 to the main switch 13 side, but does not allow current to flow in the other direction from the battery 21 to the AC generator 33.<br>
In short, the first and second diodes 56 and 57 allow current of a fixed direction to flow to the control means 55 in order to protect the control means 55.<br>
The general load 61 is an electric load except a fuel supplying system load of the fuel pump 27 and so forth and an ignition system load of the GDI apparatus 16, the ignition plug 22 and so forth shown in FIG. 1.  The general load 61 mainly includes lamp loads such as a head lamp 31, a tail lamp 32, a turn signal lamp, and instrument lights and so forth, and a horn.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 3, the diodes 103 to 105 are parasitic diodes of the FETs 62 to 64.<br>
The control means 55 is started up with a predetermined voltage which is supplied from the battery 21 or the AC generator 33 when the main switch 13 is switched on, and controls the gate voltage to the FETs 62 to 64 to effect switching on or off between the drain and<br><br>
the source of the FET 62 to 64,<br>
Further, the control means 55 generates a control signal for activating the GDI apparatus 16 (refer to FIG. 1)<br>
The GDI apparatus 16 generates electricity with an ignition coil, rectifies the electricity by means of a diode, and temporarily stores it into a capacitor for ignition.  Then, the GDI apparatus 16 switches a thyristor into an on state by applying an electric signal to the gate of the thyristor in an off state connected to the capacitor for ignition to discharge the power stored in the capacitor for ignition.  The discharged current is supplied to the primary coil of the ignition coil to generate a high voltage in the secondary coil to generate a spark at the ignition plug.<br>
[9030]-<br>
Here, a generation voltage boost apparatus 110 is composed of the boost rectification circuit 44, FET driving means 53, oscillator 54, and computer 55.<br>
Further, a power control apparatus 111 is composed of the FETs 62 to 64 and the control means 55.<br>
Operation of the electric power supplying apparatus<br><br>
40 described above is described with reference to FIGS. 4 to 6 .<br>
FIG. 4 is a first operation diagram illustrating operation of the electric power supplying apparatus according to the present invention and description is given of operation upon kick starting up for activating the engine by treading down a kick pedal.<br>
First, if the main switch 13 is switched on as indicated by (1) and the kick pedal is treadled down, then the rotor (not shown) of the AC generator 33 connected to the kick pedal is rotated (refer to an arrow mark (2)) and starts power generation.  Then, the generated AC output is boosted and rectified by the boost rectification circuit 44 and is supplied to the control means 55 as indicated by an arrow mark (3).<br>
The control means 55 sends a control signal to the GDI apparatus 16 (refer to FIG. 1) so that a spark is generated at the ignition plug 22 (refer to FIG. 1).<br>
Further, the control means 55 sends a drive signal da to the FET 62 to effect switching on between the drain and the source of the FET 62, that is, to switch on the FET 62.  Consequently, current flows as indicated by an arrow mark (4) from an output terminal section 97 side to<br><br>
the fuel pum.p 27 through the m.ovable contact 84 and first fixed contact 82 of the starter relay 43 and the sub fuse 58. Consequently, the electric motor 74 of the fuel pump 27 is started up and drives a pump body 75 to supply fuel to the engine.<br>
In this manner, the control means 55 does not send, upon kick starting, a drive signal to the FET 63 to keep the FET 63 off thereby to switch off the battery disconnection relay 42 to disconnect the battery 21 from the AC generator 33 and not supply power from the AC generator 33 to the general load 61.<br>
FIG. 5 is a second operation diagram illustrating operation of the electric power supplying apparatus according to the present invention and description is given of operation after the engine is started by the kick starting up illustrated in FIG. 4.<br>
Electric power generated by the AC generator 33 is supplied to the control means 55 as indicated by the arrow mark (1) through the boost rectification circuit 44,<br>
The control means 55 sends a control signal to the CDI apparatus 16 (refer to FIG. 1) so that a spark is generated at the ignition plug 22 (refer to FIG. 1).<br><br>
Further, the control means 55 sends a drive signal da to the FET 62 to switch on the FET 62 and sends another drive signal db to the FET 63 to switch on the FET 63 .  Consequently, electric current flows to the coil 81 of the battery disconnection relay 42 as indicated by an arrow mark (2) thereby to switch on the switch section 78 of the battery disconnection relay 42.  As a result, electric current flows from the AC generator 33 through the starter relay 43, the battery disconnection relay 42, and the main fuse 41 to the battery 21 as indicated by the arrow mark (4) to charge the battery 21.<br>
Further, the control means 55 supplies electric power from the starter relay 43 side to the fuel pump 27 and the general load 61 through the sub fuse 58 as indicated by an arrow mark (5).<br>
FIG. 6 is a third operation diagram illustrating operation of the electric power supplying apparatus according to the present invention and description is given of operation upon starting up by the starter motor wherein the AC generator is used as the starter motor separately from that upon kick starting described above with reference to FIG. 4.<br><br>
If a sufficient amount of electricity is stored in the battery 21, the main switch 13 is switched on as indicated by reference numeral (1) to supply electric power from the battery 21 to the control means 55 as indicated by an arrow mark (2).<br>
The control means 55 sends a drive signal da to the FET 62 and sends another drive signal db to the FET 63 to switch on the FETs 62 and 63, respectively.  Consequently, current flows to the coil 81 of the battery disconnection relay 42 as indicated by an arrow mark (3) to switch on the switch section 78 of the battety disconnection relay 42 as indicated by reference numeral (4).  Consequently, the battery 21 supplies electric power to the fuel pump 27 and the general load 61 through the main fuse 41, battery disconnection relay 42, and sub fuse 58 as indicated by an arrow mark (5).<br>
Then, if the starter switch 12 is switched on as indicated by (6), then current flows to the control means 55 through the starter switch 12, and the control means 55 sends a drive signal dc to the FET 64 to switch on the FET 64.  Consequently, current flows to the coil 86 of the starter relay 43 as indicated by an arrow mark (7) to<br><br>
change over the movable contact 84 of the starter relay 43 from the first fixed contact 82 to the second fixed contact 83 to supply electric power from the battery 21 to the AC generator 33 through the starter relay 43. Consequently, the AC generator 33 is activated to start the engine.<br>
As described above, the present invention is characterized in that the AC generator 33 functions also as a starter motor and the starter relay 43 is provided on the AC generator 33 side of the battery disconnection relay 42, and the battery disconnection relay 42 includes the first fixed contact 82 electrically connected to the battery disconnection relay 42, the second fixed contact 83 directly connected to the battery 21 for allowing power to be supplied from the battery 21 to the AC generator 33, and the movable contact 84 capable of being switchably connected to the first fixed contact 82 and the second fixed contact 83 and connected to the AC generator 33.<br>
-<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, if the movable contact 84 of the starter relay 43 is connected to the first fixed contact 82 side, then the AC generator 33 can be<br><br>
connected to the battery 21 through the starter relay 43 and the battery disconnection relay 42 to charge the battery 21.  On the other hand, if the movable contact 84 is connected to the second fixed contact 83 side as shown in FIG. 6, then the AC generator 33 can be connected directly to the battery 21 through the starter relay 43 to supply power from the battery 21 to the AC generator 33 so that the AC generator 33 can act as a starter motor, Consequently, while the starting performance of the engine is assured, the AC generator 33 and the starter motor can be used commonly, and the system can be made compact.<br>
Further, the present invention is characterized in that, as shown in FIG. 3, the control means 55 is electrically connected to the battery 21 side and the AC generator 33 side through the main switch 13, and the first diode 56 for allowing energization from the battery 21 to the control means 55 but preventing reverse current is provided for the circuit from the main switch 13 to the control means 55 while the second diode 57 for allowing energization from the AC generator 33 to the control means 55 but preventing reverse current is provided for the circuit from the main switch 13 to the<br><br>
AC generator 33.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, if the main switch 13 is switched on, then power can be supplied from both of the battery 21 and the AC generator 33 to the control means 55, and generated power of the AC generator 33 does not flow into the battery 21 at all.  Therefore, even when the amount of electricity of the battery 21 is insufficient, power can be supplied from the AC generator 33 to the control means 55 to start up the control means 55, and a good starting performance of the engine can be maintained. Accordingly, the reliability of the power supplying apparatus (refer to FIG. 3) can be augmented.<br>
Further, the directions of electric current to flow from the battery 21 and the AC generator 33 to the control means 55 can always be fixed by the first and second diodes 56 and 57 thereby to protect the control means 55.<br>

As described above with reference to FIGS. 1 and 3, the present invention is characterized in that, in the motorcycle 10 which includes the battery 21 for supplying power to an electric load, the AC generator 33 for generating electric power to be used to charge the battery 21 and supplying power to the electric load when the amount of electricity of the battery 21 is insufficient, and the kick pedal 25 for being kicked to rotate the AC generator 33 to start the engine 15, the battery disconnection relay 42 for switching on/off the electric connection between the battery 21 and the AC generator 33 is provided for the circuit which interconnects the battery 21 and the AC generator 33, and the battery disconnection relay 42 is switched off by control means 55 when the kick pedal 25 is used to start the engine 15.<br><br><br>
Upon starting of the engine, the battery disconnection relay 42 interposed between the battery 21 and the AC generator 33 is switched off by the control means 55 so that electric power generated by the AC generator 33 is not supplied to the battery 21 but is supplied to parts of the fuel supply system (fuel pump 27) and the ignition system to ensure a voltage necessary to activate the parts of the fuel supply system and the ignition system, and consequently, the engine can be started well irrespective of the state of the battery 21.<br>
Further, the present invention is characterized in that the control means 55 controls the switching on/off of the battery disconnection relay 42 and simultaneously controls the electric connection between the AC generator 33 and the general load 61 such as the lighting system.<br>
Since, upon starting of the engine, the connection between the AC generator 33 and the battery 21 is cut by the battery disconnection relay 42 and the connection between the AC generator 33 and the general load 61 is cut simultaneously, a voltage necessary to activate the fuel supply system and the ignition system can be assured sufficiently, and the starting performance of the engine<br><br><br>
15 can be further improved.<br>
FIG. 9 is a circuit diagram showing another embodiment of the power supplying apparatus according to the present invention, and like components to those of the embodiment shown in FIG. 3 are denoted by like reference characters and detailed description thereof is omitted.<br>
A power supplying apparatus 120 includes a starter relay 121 connected in parallel to the battery disconnection relay 42 for starting the AC generator 33.<br>
The battery disconnection relay 42 is connected at the fixed contact 76 thereof to the main fuse 41 and connected at the movable contact 77 thereof to the main switch 13 through the second diode 57.<br>
The starter relay 121 includes a fixed contact 122 connected to the battery 21, a movable contact 123 which can be connected to or disconnected from the fixed contact 122 and is connected to the main switch 13 through the second diode 57, and a coil 86.  A switch section 124 is formed from the fixed contact 122 and the movable contact 123.<br><br>
Control of the FETs 62 to 64 by the control means 55 in the power supplying apparatus 120 is similar to that upon kick starting illustrated in FIG. 4, after starting of the engine illustrated in FIG. 5 and upon starting by the starter motor illustrated in FIG. 6.<br>
As described above, the present invention is characterized in that the AC generator 33 functions also as a starter motor, and the starter relay 43 for starting the AC generator 33 is connected in parallel to the battery disconnection relay 42.<br>
[.0-0-6^<br>
By activating the starter relay 43, the battery 21 can be connected to the AC generator 33 to supply electric power from the battery 21 to the AC generator 33 to start the AC generator 33.<br>
On the other hand, by switching the battery disconnection relay 42 off, the battery 21 can be disconnected from the AC generator 33 so that power may not be supplied from the AC generator 33 to the battery 21. Accordingly, since the object can be achieved using the starter relay 43 for universal use without provision of changeover means for exclusive use, the system can be produced at a reduced cost.  Further, the system can be<br><br>
made compact by common use of the AC generator 3 3 and the starter motor.<br>
It is to be noted that, although the switch means of claim 1 is formed, in the embodiment, as a battery disconnection relay, it is not limited to this and may be switch means which utilizes a semiconductor device.<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
The present invention exhibits the following effects due to the configurations described above.<br>
Since the power supplying apparatus for a vehicle of claim 1 is configured such that switch means for switching on/off electric connection between a battery and an AC generator is provided for a circuit which interconnects the battery and the AC generator and the switch means is switched off by control means when a kick starting apparatus is used to start the engine, upon starting of the engine, electric power generated by the AC generator is not supplied to the battery but can be supplied to parts of a fuel supply system and an ignition system, and a voltage necessary to activate the parts of the fuel supply system and the ignition system can be ensured. Accordingly, the starting performance of the<br><br>
engine can be improved irrespective of the state of the battery.<br>
Since the power supplying apparatus for a vehicle of claim 2 is configured such that the control means controls the switching on/off of the switch means and simultaneously controls electric connection between the AC generator and a general load such as a lighting system, if, upon starting of the engine, the connection between the AC generator and the battery is cut by the switch means and the connection between the AC generator and the general load is cut simultaneously, then a voltage necessary to activate the fuel supply system and the ignition system is assured sufficiently, and the starting performance of the engine can be further improved.<br>
Since the power supplying apparatus for a vehicle of claim 3 is configured such that the AC generator functions also as a starter motor and changeover contact means is provided on the AC generator side of the switch means and includes a first fixed contact electrically connected to the switch means, a second fixed contact directly connected to the battery for allowing power to be supplied from the battery to the AC generator, and a<br><br>
movable contact capable of being switchably connected to the first fixed contact and the second fixed contact and connected to the AC generator, if the movable contact of the changeover contact means is connected to the first fixed contact side, then the AC generator can be connected to the battery through the changeover contact means and the switch means to charge the battery.  On the other hand, if the movable contact is connected to the second fixed contact side, then power can be supplied from the battery to the AC generator so that the AC generator can act as a starter motor.  Consequently, while the starting performance is ensured, the AC generator and the starter motor can be used commonly, and the system can be made compact.<br>
Since the power supplying apparatus for a vehicle of claim 4 is configured such that the AC generator functions also as a starter motor and a starter relay for starting the AC generator is connected in parallel to the switch means, by activating the starter relay, the battery can be connected to the AC generator to supply electric power from the battery to the AC generator to start the AC generator.<br>
On the other hand, by switching the switch means<br><br><br>
off, the battery can be disconnected from, the AC generator so that power may not be supplied from the AC generator to the battery.  Consequently, since the object can be achieved using a starter relay for universal use without provision of changeover means for exclusive use, the system can be produced at a reduced cost.  Further, the system can be made compact by common use of the AC generator and the starter motor.<br>
Since the power supplying apparatus for a vehicle of claim 5 is configured such that the control means is electrically connected to the battery side and the AC generator side through a main switch and a first diode for allowing energization from the battery to the control means but preventing reverse current is provided for a circuit from the main switch to the control means while a second diode for allowing energization from the AC generator to the control means but preventing reverse current is provided for a circuit from the main switch to the AC generator, if the main switch is switched on, then power can be supplied from both of the battery and the AC generator to the control means, and generated power of the AC generator does not flow into the battery at all. Therefore, even when the amount of electricity of the<br><br>
battery is insufficient, power can be supplied from the AC generator to the control means to start up the control meansv and a good starting performance of the engine can be maintained.  Accordingly, the reliability of the power supplying apparatus can be augmented.<br>
Further, the directions of electric current to flow from the battery and the AC generator to the control means can always be fixed by the first and second diodes, and the control means can be protected.<br><br><br>
