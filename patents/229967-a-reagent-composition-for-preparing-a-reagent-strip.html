METHOD AND REAGENT FOR PRODUCING NARROW. HOMOGENOUS<br>
REAGENT STRIPES<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/480,397, filed June 20,2003. This application is related to a commonly assigned application entitled "Reagent Stripe for Test Strip" (hereinafter "Reagent Stripe application"), filed on even date herewith and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to reagents used in biosensors or test strips and more particularly to the production of narrow, homogenous reagent stripes on flat surfaces of test strips.<br>
BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY<br>
Of the numerous methods for applying reagents to test strips, in the past electrochemical biosensors have mainly been produced by using printing techniques such as screen printing processes or dispensing techniques for liquid reagent application and subsequent drying, (see. e.g.p U.S. Patent Number 5,437,999 and WO 97/02487). In connection with so-called "capillary fill" test strips, these dispensing methodB have successfully been employed, as in the production of Roche Diagnostics AccuChek® Advantage test strips. While these techniques allow for tile production of reliable electrochemical biosensors, they are not well suited for high throughput production lines. In addition, these dispensing<br><br>
techniques suffer from the disadvantage of inhomogeneous drying of the reagent, which leads to non-uniform reagent thickness over the covered electrode area. Also, the above mentioned techniques are not suited for the reliable and reproducible production of extremely thin reagent layers (10 ysa or less). Therefore, there exists a need for improved reagent application methods.<br>
Blade coating of reagent compositions onto flat substrates has been suggested and successfully been employed in the production of reagent films coated for example on transparent polymeric substrates (e.g., U.S. Patent Nas. 5,437,999 and 6,036,919). Usually, films of a width of several centimeters to several meters can be produced by this method. For the production of test strips, the so created reagent layers are cut into small stripes and then applied to the test strip substrate. Blade coating of reagent masses has the disadvantage that -although the center portion of the film is homogenous in thickness - at the edge of the coated area inhomogeneities are found which are believed to be due to drying effects and edge effects. While these inhomogeneities are acceptable if broad bands of reagents are coated onto substrates since the inhomogeneous edge portions of the coating can bediscarded by edge trim, these inhomogeneities become more and more unacceptable as the reagent stripe to be coated becomes smaller/narrower.<br>
WO 02/057781 discloses a method for manufacturing reagent strips from web material. Among other things, it discloses that the reagent material may be applied to the strip support material by laying down a narrow stripe of reagent material, which may or may not be supported by a support carrier.<br>
U.S. Patent Application Publication 2003/0097981, U.S. Patent Publication Number 2003/0099773, U.S. Patent Numbers 6,676,995 and 6,689,411 and EP 1 316 367) disclose a solution stripping system for laying down stripes of reagent solutions on a substrate. The system allows slot-die-coating of reagent solutions to web material, e.g., for electrochemical glucose sensors, which solutions have alow viscosity, from about 0.5 to 25 centipoises (cP = mPa-s).<br>
U.S. Patent Numbers 3,032,008; 3,886,898; and 4,106,437 teach coating apparatuses useful for coating liquid material onto solid supports.<br><br>
U.S. Patent Number 6,036,919 discloses reagent films for optical blood glucose test strips. The reagent composition comprises, among other things, a Xanthan gum.<br>
U.S. Patent Application Publication Number 2003/0146113 discloses reagent films for electrochemical coagulation sensors. The reagent composition comprises, among other things, carboxylated microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel® R591) as a film former.<br>
None of the above-mentioned references satisfies the need for a reliable method for forming narrow (for example, less than 1 cm), thin (for example, less than 10 jim) and homogeneous reagent stripes on solid support material for producing test strips, in particular electrochemical test strips.<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a method and a corresponding reagent composition with which extremely thin, narrow and homogeneous reagent lines or stripes can be deposited onto flat surfaces, for example, of web material and in particular onto the electrode areas of electrochemical biosensor test strips.<br>
This object is reached by the present invention concerning a reagent for a slot-die-coating process for narrow and homogenous reagent stripes.<br>
In a first aspect, the present invention concerns a reagent composition showing shear thinning, slightly thixotropic or thixotropic behavior.<br>
In a second aspect, the present invention concerns a method of coating the shear thinning, slightly thixotropic or thixotropic reagent composition onto web material using a slot-die-coating process.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention concerns analytical test elements comprising the shear thinning, slightly thixotropic or thixotropic reagent.<br>
In still another aspect, the present invention concerns reagent compositions that are shear thinning and at least slightly thixotropic. It also concerns analytic test elements and methods for making analytic test elements that include using shear thinning and at least slightly thixotropic reagent compositions.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention, reference will now be made to the specific embodiments illustrated herein and specific language will be used to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended. Any alterations and further modifications in the described processes or devices and any further applications of the principles of the invention as described herein, are contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention relates. Preferred embodiments of the invention are subject of the dependent claims.<br>
The reagent composition of the present invention is shear thinning, slightly thixotropic or thixotropic. Thixotropic reagent compositions are reagent compositions that show rheologic behavior depending on whether or not external shear force is applied to the reagent composition. Shear thinning reagent compositions are reagent compositions that become thinner, i.e., less viscous, when a shear force is applied to them. In general, before applying a shear force to the reagent composition of the present invention, the composition has a certain viscosity, When a shear force is applied to the composition, its viscosity is reduced. If viscosity increases again - with a certain time-dependency - after the shear force is stopped, the reagent composition shall be regarded as being "shear thinning." If viscosity increases only with a certain delay after the shear force is stopped the reagent composition shall be regarded as being "thixotropic."<br>
Thixotropy is a special case of pseudoplasticity. The thixotropic fluid undergoes "shear thinning." But as shear forces are reduced, viscosity rebuilds and increases at a slower rate, thus producing a hysteresis loop. Slightly thixotropic fluids have a less pronounced hysteresis. In addition, the thixotropic behavior is influenced considerably by the shear history of the material under investigation. In comparative measurements, care should be taken to ensure that an identical or at least very similar history of the samples to be compared is given.<br>
The reagent compositions of the present invention are useful in slot-die-coating processes. During slot-die-coating, the fluid reagent composition is applied<br><br>
to a solid substrate, preferably a substrate in the form of a web material, by forcing the reagent liquid or slurry through the slot of a slot-die-coating head. Usually, the web material passes the slot at a certain distance with certain speed. However, it is also possible that the slot-die-coating head moves across the web material, or that the slot-die head and web both move.<br>
To achieve the objects of the present inventions, it is advantageous that the rheologic properties of the reagent composition used as a coating mass are within certain preferred ranges: The viscosity preferably is between about 70 and about 130 mPa-s, most preferably in the range between 95 and 115 mPa-s. The surface tension ranges advantageously between 30 and 50 mN/m and preferably is about 40 ± 2 mN/m. It is also important that the coating mass shows shear thinning, slightly thixotropic or thixotropic behavior.<br>
One aspect of the present invention is the inclusion of Xanthan gum into the reagent coating mass. One brand of Xanthan gum that can be used is Keltrol®, This component shows an influence on the thixotropy of the reagent mass. Reagent coating masses containing Xanthan gum, for example, Keltrol®, allow the production of extremely thin reagent layers. Preferably, the reagent layer dried films have a thickness less than 10 pm, particularly preferred are dried reagent layers in the range of 1.5 to 5 [im thick.<br>
It has turned out that the incorporation of silica into the reagent compositions of the present invention has an advantageous effect for the viscosity and thixotropy behavior of the reagent. Both properties are enhanced by the addition of silica. Preferably, untreated, hydrophilic silica is used. The particle size of a preferred form of silica ranges from about 1 to 7 /im. It has turned out that silica unexpectedly enhances the thixotropic behavior of other components of the coating mass, in particular of carboxymethyl cellulose and Keltrol®. Also, silica particles in the dry film prevent backside transfer between the coated stripe and the backside of the web, allowing storage of the coated web material as rolls of material. In addition, silica particles in the dry film increase the specific surface of the reagent coating, enabling, for example, rapid dissolving of the reagent in a sample liquid. In capillary fill biosensors comprising reagent stripes including the<br><br>
reagent composition of the present invention, silica also improves capillary fill times and migration of components in the reagent stripe.<br>
Yet another additive for the enhancement of viscosity and mixotropy of the reagent is carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Especially preferred embodiments of the inventive reagent composition therefore comprise Xanthan gum, for example, Keltrol®, silica and CMC<br>
The reagent compositions of the present invention allow the formation of thin reagent layers, for example, the production of electrochemical biosensors. Thin reagent layers have several advantages:<br>
Sample components are in excess compared to the reagent components, therefore not limiting in the determination reactions.<br>
Thin reagent layers can be made homogenous in thickness.<br>
Thin reagent layers contain only small amounts of reagent, which in turn ead to fast reaction times.<br>
The reactions only have, short diffusion times.<br>
The thin reagent layers are quickly soluble and therefore lead to quick ■eagent availability and a rapid equilibration of the matrix after sample rehydration &gt;f the reagent stripe, which in turn leads to fast measurements.<br>
The inventive reagent layers can not only be made very thin but also show a ligh homogeneity down web and across web in the reaction area. The reagent layer n the test area is flat and uniform in thickness. Thickness variations in the coated tripe occur preferably only on the outer 0.2 cm (or less) edges of the stripe. In •referred embodiments, these areas advantageously can either be covered during ensor assembly by spacer layers or can be trimmed from the completed sensor in lie final assembly process.<br>
Apart from the above-mentioned components, which influence the Geologic properties of the reagent composition of the present invention, the :agent may further comprise one or more substances (ingredients) of the sllowing substance classes. Substances, additives and ingredients that may be dded to the reagent includes, but are not limited to, the following; buffers, for example, phosphate buffers;<br><br>
enzymes, such as, glucose dehydrogenase, glucose dye oxidoreductase, glucose oxidase and other oxidases or dehydrogenases such as for lactate or cholesterol determination, esterases etc.;<br>
mediators such as nitrosoanilines, ferricyanide, ruthenium hexamine, osmium complexes;<br>
stabilizers, such as trehalose, sodium succinate;<br>
thickeners, such as Keltrol®, CMC<br>
proteins, such as enzymes, bovine serum albumin<br>
indicators;<br>
dyes;<br>
surfactants, such as Mega 8®, Geropon®; Triton®, Tween®, Mega 9®, DONS;<br>
film formers, such as Keltrol®, Propiofan®, polyvinyl pyrroltdone, polyvinyl alcohol, Klucel®;<br>
co-factors for enzymes, such as NAD, NADH, PQQ; and<br>
silica, for example, DS 300, DS 320, milled silica of DS 300, milled silica of DS 320.<br>
Non-limiting examples of enzymes and mediators that may be used in measuring     particular     anaiytes     are     listed     below     in     Table      1.<br><br><br><br>
In some of the examples shown in Table 1, at least one additional enzyme is used as a reaction catalyst. Also, some of the examples shown in Table 1 may utilize an additional mediator, which facilitates electron transfer to the oxidised form of the mediator. The additional mediator may be provided to the reagent in lesser amount than the oxidized form of the mediator. While the above assays are described, it is contemplated that current, charge, impedance, conductance, potential, or other electrochemically indicated property of the sample might be accurately correlated to the concentration of the analyte in the sample with an electrochemical biosensor in accordance with this disclosure.<br>
Examples of reagent compositions are given as Examples 1, 2,3 and 4 for electrochemical blood glucose and coagulation sensors, respectively.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the above reagent compositions are applied to substrates which already contain the electrode traces or circuits of an electrochemical sensor by means of a slot-die-coating process. An example of this process is given in Example 5.<br>
The preferred fabrication technique for these electrode circuits uses a laser ablation process. For a further discussion of laser ablation, please see WO 01/25775, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Most preferably, the technique uses a reel-to-reel laser ablation process. This process can be used in reel-to-reel fashion to form extremely thin metal structures on polymeric substrates, which metal structures can be used as electrode traces in electrochemical sensors. The reagent can be applied to these structures using the above process.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that the capillary channel and spacer structure of the sensor can be formed by using a double sided adhesive tape with a respective cutout as a spacer structure and covering parts of the reagent layer on the electrode substrate. Unexpectedly, no leakage of sample liquid can be observed at the positions where the double-sided adhesive tape covers the reagent film. Therefore, it is possible to first make structured electrode traces by a laser ablation process on a web material, then slot-die-coat the reagent material and<br><br>
subsequently define the active reagent area which comes into contact with the blood sample by using a respectively formed double sided adhesive spacer. This process can advantageously be used to eliminate tolerances in the production line. Especially, masking the reagent coating with the spacer can be used to precisely define the actual reaction area.<br>
In the second aspect of the present invention, the invention concerns a method or process for producing a reagent layer on a solid support material using the shear thinning, slightly thixotropic or thixotropic reagent composition of the invention. The process includes providing a solid support material such as a web of plastics material like Melinex® 329 of DuPont. During the process of the present invention, the solid support material is moved relative to a slot-die-coating head. Usually, the solid support web material is transported in a reel-to-reel process across the slot of the die-coating head. However, it is also possible, to move the die-coating head and keep the web material stationary. During the movement of the web material relative to the die-coating head, a defined distance between the web and the die-coating head is maintained. Preferably, the coating gap is in the range of between 30 and 90' /tm; typically between 68 and 83 ftm, most preferred between 72 and 76 fim. By forcing the reagent composition through the slot of the slot-die-coating head, the reagent is deposited onto the solid support material, forming a continuous stripe of reagent on the solid support material. As mentioned above, the web material may comprise electrode traces and the reagent stripe may partly cover these traces. Preferably, in the dried state the reagent stripe has a width of less than 1 cm and a height of less than 10 /xm.<br>
Preferably, the solid support material is moved relative to the slot-die-coating head at a speed of between 20 and 80 m/min, most preferably at a speed of between 30 and 40 m/min.<br>
Preferably, the reagent composition is delivered to the solid support material at a coating flux of 5.5 to 30 g/min, most preferably at a flux of 13 to 15 g/min.<br>
Subsequently, the deposited reagent stripe is dried either under ambient conditions or in a heated airflow.<br>
ja,<br><br>
In a further aspect, the invention concerns analytical test elements that comprise the above reagent composition. Preferably, the analytical test elements of the present invention are manufactured according to the process as described above.<br>
The invention has the following advantages:<br>
1.	Sensors requiring small sample volumes (typically 100 to 1000 nl) can easily be constructed using the slot die coated dry film and spacer/capillary channel lamination processes. The dry film stripe is of uniform thickness and is homogeneous over the electrochemical reaction area. The required capillary dimensions/imprecision of the sensor is dependent on the variation in spacer thickness and the construction of the capillary channel.<br>
2.	The slot-die-coating technology can be paired with a sophisticated layout of the electrodes design, thus enabling the capability of miniaturizing and creating multiple applications in the sensor capillary, (for example, staggering two or more lines/stripes of different reagents within an adequately designed layout of electrodes). Two staggered slot dies or a special slot die assembly designed for two or more fluids can be used to achieve this goal. The coating fluids preferably will have properly matching rheologic properties. The best technological case is achieved if the coating windows of the different fluids have a consistent overlapping region.<br>
3.	The slot-die-coating film application technology paired and combined with the rheologic properties of the reagent enables homogeneous coatings using a reel to reel coating process for rapid production of diagnostic sensors.<br>
4.	Thixotropy or shear thinning behavior is the main rheologic feature of the fluid to be coated in respect to the mass distribution and its profile across the coated layer, impacting on the flatness, repeatability and homogeneity of the wet and dried layer. This feature is reached by using Xanthan gum, for example, Keltrol®, CMC and Silica in a concentration and combination to match the desired shear thinning, slightly thixotropic or thixotropic behavior of the coating fluid.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that the role of silica, in particular the<br><br>
preferred untreated, hydrophilic silica, preferably with a particle size D50 (i.e., 50 % of the particles have a size of the given size or below) of 1 to 7 /xm, in the "wet" status (in the coating fluid) is that in combination with the film thickeners (Keltrol® and CMC, either one or both of them) silica increases the viscosity and enhances the shear thinning, slightly thixotropic or thixotropic behavior of the coating fluid. Silica acts in the dried state to, among other things:<br>
a)	prevent back transfer of the dried film on the un-coated side of the foil/carrier if the web material is wound to rolls after the coating and drying processes, and<br>
b)	enlarge the specific surface of the dried coating layer as compared to a smooth coating layer. Without wishing to be tied to any specific theory, this is likely due to the particle-size distribution of silica particles. Since the speed of fluid transport is increased by the ratio between the surface area and the fluid volume, this enlarged specific surface is speeding up the wetting process of the dried film and in consequence leads to a shorter capillary fill time.<br>
The present invention is further elucidated by the following Examples and Figures. With respect to the Figures whenever possible like numbers, letters and symbols refer to like structures, features and elements. For example, unless otherwise stated in the application the following key applies:<br>

Figures 1 and 2 are schematic representations of the several steps that are done during the manufacturing process for electrochemical test elements using the reagent composition and process of the present invention. A person of ordinary skill in the art would readily recognize that the process can be used with other electrode configurations and with multiple stripes having the same or different composition and different positions on the strip. It is to be noted that the processes described in Figures 1 and 2 could also be carried out without electrodes present on the test strips. A person of ordinary skill in the art would readily recognize that the ptoce&amp;s and reagent described herein can also be adapted to optical test elements as well.<br>
Parts A and B of Figures 1 and 2 are identical and show a polymer web (1), preferably an inert plastic material such as Melinex® 329 of DuPont (see, e.g., part A), on which is coated a metal layer (2) (see, e.g., part B) by conventional techniques such as sputtering, chemical, electrochemical or physical vapor deposition, etc.<br>
Preferably, the metal layer (2) subsequently is structured by for example a laser ablation process. This process removes parts of the metal layer (2) and discrete structures of metal which can act as electrodes (3,4) remain on the surface of the polymer web (1). It should be understood, however, that conventional printing techniques or lithographic processes can also be used to create electrodes (3,4) on the polymer web (1).<br>
After the laser ablation step in Figure 1, part C, two electrodes (3,4) are formed on the polymer web. In Figure 2, part C, two pairs of electrodes (3, 3', 4, 4') are formed.<br>
In the next step (shown in part D of Figure 1 and 2), reagent stripes 5, 5' are deposited over the active area of the working and counter electrodes (3,3', 4,4'). The reagent composition is applied on the electrode structure by the slot-die-coating process of the present invention.<br>
In part E of Figures 1 and 2, a spacer layer (6) is laminated to the electrode structure of part D of Figures 1 and 2. The spacer (6) is preferably a double-sided adhesive tape that covers all parts of the reagent and electrode structures that are<br><br><br>
not to be brought into contact with liquid sample. In addition, the spacer (6) has a cutout that defines the reactive area of the reagent and the underlying electrodes. At the opposite end of the spacer (6), i.e., the end where the electrode leads are located that are not covered by reagent composition, the spacer (6) leaves free parts of the electrode structures that can be used to connect the test strip to a respective test strip reading meter.<br>
Spacer (6) preferably covers a narrow part (less than 2 mm) of the reagent (5 in Fig. 1, 5' in Fig. 2) to mask eventual inhomogeneous edge regions of the reagent coating.<br>
After laminating the spacer (6) to the electrode and reagent web, in a preferred embodiment, part of the web material is cut off to trim the reagent stripe (5).<br>
In part F of Figures 1 and 2, a top foil (7), preferably an inert plastics cover, is placed onto the surface of the spacer (6) that is not in contact with the polymer web (1). The polymer web (1), the spacer (6) and the top foil (7) form a 3D capillary channel which is defined by the thickness of the spacer (6) and the dimensions of the cut-out in the spacer. To enable a filling of the capillary space, preferably either the top foil (7) or the polymer web (1) has a vent opening (8).<br>
As is clear for those skilled in the art, the surfaces of either the polymer web (1) or the top foil (7) that face the capillary space can be rendered hydrophilic by a respective hydrophilic treatment, for example, by coating with a surfactant or plasma treatment.<br><br><br>
The reagent matrix was custom modified to meet the demands of the slot-die-coating process. Silica, Keltrol® (Xanthan Gum), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and surfactants were added to the coating matrix to modify the rheology of the reagent mass. Surfactant concentrations were adjusted to obtain surface tensions (measured with a Tensiometer K10T (Kruess)) in the most preferred range<br><br>
of 33 to 42 raN/m. Surface tension in this range promotes better adhesion and controlled spreading of the coated stripe on the web. The most preferred viscosity range measured using a Rheomat 115 (Contraves) for the coating mass is 95 to 115 mPa-s. The polymers and the silica also .impart thixotropic behavior to the coating. Coatings shear thin as they are dispensed through the slot die head onto the web. This reduces the apparent viscosity of the coating.<br>
Stripes of reagent coating mass with these lower viscosities show a migration of the stripe edges and reagent components toward the center of the stripe during the drying process. This migration leads to an irregular and irreproducible surface profile in the middle of the dried stripe. Dispense of coatings having shear thinning, slightly thixotropic or thixotropic properties show the same shear thinning effects. However, the viscosity of the coated stripe returns to near the apparent viscosity shortly after being dispensed and before entering the drying region. The migration of the stripe edges towards the center during drying is retarded. As illustrated in Figure 3, this leads to a flat reproducible region in the center of the stripe, in the reaction area. Thinner films further retard the migration of the coating edges to the center of the coated stripe.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 5: Coating process<br>
The polymer web (Melinex® 329, DuPont) is moved into the coating area, containing a slot die head and a back up roller. The slot die head (TSE, Switzerland) is zeroed to the web surface and adjusted to a slot to web gap of 74 fim. Web speed is ramped up from 0 to 38 m/min for deposition of coating on the web. The reagent matrix can be delivered to the slot die head using a variety of means including gear pumps, pistons, syringes, bladder systems. The reagent delivery system is adjusted to a water flow of 13.58 ml/min to deliver a coat weight of 53 g/m3 through the coating head. The width of the resulting coated stripe is 7.0 + 0.3 mm. The coating is dried in the heated drying zone (length 15<br><br>
m, temperature 110 °C, at a speed of 38 m/min) and rewound on spools at the rewind station.<br>
Figures 3 to 5 show the results of profilometric measurements across the reagent stripe according to this example. The profilometer system used was a Dektak HA Surface Profile Measuring System (Veeco Instruments Inc., Sloan Technology Division, Dallas, Texas). Profile data from the Dektak HA were baseline corrected.<br>
In Figure 3, P (mm) denotes the x-position of the scan across the web and reagent stripe (in mm) and H (fim) denotes the respective relative height of the coating (in fim). The reagent mass was prepared according to Example 1. As can be seen, the reagent stripe has a cross-sectional width of about 7 mm and a respective average center height of approximately 5 fim. The edges of the reagent coating are relatively sharp. The homogeneous plateau region of the coating fills approximately 80 % of the reagent stripe width.<br>
The profile of the reagent coating as depicted in Figure 3 is typical for coatings according to the present invention. For reagent stripes of 10 mm or less in width, sharp edges can be obtained, which ramp up from the underlying web material (corresponding to a coating height of zero) to the plateau region in the center of the coating within 1 mm on each side or less (i.e. 80 % or more of the coating belong to the homogeneous center plateau region). Within the center region, the reagent coating is practically uniform in thickness.<br>
Figure 4 shows the results of profilometric measurements across the reagent stripe prepared according to this example. Scan Distance (fim) denotes the x-position of the scan across the web and reagent stripe (in fim) and Height (/Am) denotes the respective relative height of the coating (in fim). The reagent mass was prepared according to Example 1 with milled silica. Figures 4A to 4E give the results for coating weights of 20,25,30,40 and 50 mg/m2, respectively.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates the results of profilometric measurements across a reagent stripe prepared according to a comparative example, i.e., not in accordance with the teachings of the present invention, Scan Distance (fim) denotes the x-position of the scan across the web and reagent stripe (in fim) and Height (fim)<br><br>
denotes the respective relative height of the coating (in fim). The reagent mass was prepared according to Example 1 however without the presence of the rheological modifiers Keltrol®, CMC and silica.<br>
Figure 5A and 5B show that without rheological modifiers the dried reagent coating tends to form inhomogeneous reagent stripes on the web material. In Fig. 5A, the reagent concentrates in the center portion of the coated stripe; in Fig. 5B, the reagent concentrates in two regions located between the center and the edge portions of the reagent stripes. In both cases, the edge portions are depleted from reagent.<br>
Comparison of Fig. 5 (comparative example) with Figs. 3 and 4 (both according to the present invention) reveals the advantageous effects of the reagent composition and process of the present invention.<br>
Figure 6 is a photograph of a microscope view of a reagent stripe (central dark rectangular area) coated onto a web material (light areas around the central stripe) from a reagent composition according to Example 1 (and comparable to the profilometric data shown in Figure 4). Coating was done according to Example 5. The coated stripe shows good homogeneity across the coating direction (coating direction was from top to bottom) as well as along this direction.<br>
In stark contrast to the smooth and uniform reagent layer shown in Figure 6, Figures 7A and 7B are photographs of microscope views (comparative examples) of reagent stripes coated onto web material with profilometric data comparable to that shown in Figure 5. Coating was done according to Example 5; however, the reagent did not contain the rheological modifiers. The coated stripes clearly show inhomogeneities across the coating direction (coating direction was from top to bottom). For example, regions of thicker reagent are manifested by the dark bands running along the stripes. Figure 7A shows one such dark band positioned in about the middle of the stripe (compare Fig. 5 A), whereas Fig. 7B shows two dark bands (compare Fig. 5B). These one or two regions of thicker reagent coatings (dark zones) within the reagent stripe are believed due to drying effects of the reagent coating materials.<br><br><br>
