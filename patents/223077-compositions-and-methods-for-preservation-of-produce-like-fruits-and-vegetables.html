				<td>COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR PRESERVATION<br>
OF PRODUCE LIKE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES<br>
The invention relates to compositions, and the use of compositions for<br>
improving the quality and shelf life of fruits, vegetables, partially processed products,<br>
other produce and flowers.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Produce production in North America is a multi-billion dollar industry.<br>
Consequently, improving and preserving the quality of fruits, vegetables and other<br>
types of produce in terms of their colour, taste, flavour and storage-life are of<br>
paramount importance to growers, produce-processing companies and the food<br>
industry in general. Unfortunately, the time window where most fruits, vegetables and<br>
produce exhibit peak quality is relatively narrow, and after this time window, the<br>
quality of the produce tends to decrease rapidly.<br>
Superficial scald (or scald) is a physiological disorder that affects certain<br>
varieties of apples during or after post-harvest storage, lowering their market value<br>
several-fold. Varieties affected include Red Delicious, Mclntosh, Cortland, Granny<br>
Smith and others. Collectively, these varieties comprise over 60% of the apples<br>
produced in Canada and the United States. In addition to affecting apples, superficial<br>
scald may also affect certain varieties of pears.<br>
Superficial scald is primarily characterized by damage to me surface of fruit.<br>
Often, scald manifests as patchy browning on the surface of the fruit. This symptom<br>
can progress to internal damage and contribute to other pathological disorders.<br>
Superficial scald development in apples and pears is a form of targeted senescence,<br>
where the hypodermal cell layers (3-4 cell layers beneath the cuticle) undergo damage<br>
and deterioration. At present, the cause of superficial scald is unknown, but specific<br>
plant metabolic pathways have been implicated in its development. Also,<br>
environmental conditions such as hot dry weather, nutrient availability, and lack of<br>
appropriate chilling conditions during ripening may contribute to the development of<br>
superficial scald (Blanpeid et al., 1991; Patterson and Workman 1962).<br>
One theory regarding the mechanism of scald development proposes that the<br>
component a-farnescene, present in the superficial cell layers of fruit undergoes<br>
peroxidation through an as yet unknown mechanism and the peroxidized products<br>
somehow cause tissue damage and browning (Anet and Coggiola, 1974). Supporting<br>
the contention that free radicals may be involved in the development of the disorder,<br>
application of antioxidants such as a-tocopherol to scald-sensitive fruits can negate<br>
the development of superficial scald (Barden and Bramlage, 1994).<br>
Scald development may be inhibited by treating scald-susceptible apples with<br>
diphenylamine (DPA) or ethoxyquin. However, some apples such as "Golden<br>
Delicious" can develop a blue-grey discoloration on the cheeks and shoulders of the<br>
fruit after DPA treatment (Pierson and Schomer, 1968). Further, although DPA and<br>
ethoxyquin application inhibit scald development in many varieties of apples, these<br>
chemicals may be degraded into compounds which can include potential carcinogens.<br>
This has resulted in banning DPA and ethoxyquin application to fruit in several<br>
European countries.<br>
Other biochemical pathways have also been implicated in the mechanism of<br>
scald development in apples, and the deterioration of produce other than apples. For<br>
example, it has been suggested that membrane deterioration during senescence and<br>
stress may involve the action of phospholipase D. Phospholipase D (PLD) is a<br>
ubiquitous enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids.<br>
However, it has also been proposed that normal maturation and ripening of many<br>
types of fruits and vegetables may be due to catabolic breakdown of cellular<br>
structures such as the membrane and the cell wall, and that phospholipase D may be<br>
directly involved in this process. Also, untimely destruction of cellular integrity of the<br>
produce, as often occurs during processing (cutting, wounding, blending, etc) or<br>
storage (injury due to chilling) can lead to accelerated destruction of cellular<br>
structures, resulting in a loss of quality of the intended product.<br>
There has been much research into compositions that may replace<br>
diphenylamine to inhibit scald development in apples, as well as compositions which<br>
may be effective in enhancing or extending the food-quality of other produce such as<br>
fruits and vegetables.<br>
US 6,054,160 discloses complex compositions and processes for treating<br>
fresh-cut apple pieces, as a replacement for sulfite treatment. The composition<br>
consists of an antioxidant or reducing component such as cysteine, an osmolite such<br>
as sorbitol and a membrane integrity-enhancing agent such as calcium chloride. A<br>
chelator such as sodium hexametaphosphate can be added to enhance the affiance of<br>
the agent. The compositions are administered by dipping the pieces in an aqueous<br>
solution which protect the pieces from deterioration due to increased enzymatic<br>
activity, oxidative reactions, water migration and microbes. While the composition<br>
may enhance the fresh sensory attributes of freshly cut apples, the composition may<br>
not be applied to apples pre-harvest. Furthermore, there is no disclosure as to whether<br>
the compositions have any effect on scald, or whether the compositions are effective<br>
in enhancing the food quality of other fruits and vegetables.<br>
US 5,858,436 discloses an aqueous treatment composition comprising a<br>
polyphenol-type antioxidant alone or in combination with a terpenic compound in an<br>
aqueous vehicle for treatment of fruits or vegetables after harvesting. The composition<br>
must be heated to a temperature of 40-60°C and subsequently the fruits or vegetables<br>
are brought into contact with the liquid treatment composition at the elevated<br>
temperature for a period of less than or equal to 10 minutes. The composition is not<br>
suitable for spraying onto fruits and vegetables and the composition must be applied<br>
post-harvest.<br>
US 5,376,391 and US 5,198,254 disclose coating compositions which may<br>
increase stability of fruits, vegetables or fungi. The compositions comprise at least<br>
one polysaccharide polymer, a preservative and an acidulant. The compositions may<br>
also include at least one emulsifier, a plasticizer, a resin or rosin, a protein, a firming<br>
or sequestering agent, an antioxidant and a plant growth regulator and a chilling injury<br>
protectant. It is suggested in the patents that the coatings of the invention may act as a<br>
partial barrier to water vapour, oxygen, carbon dioxide and possibly flavour volatiles,<br>
thereby causing an alteration in metabolic processes within fruit. No specific<br>
metabolic processes or pathways are preferentially inhibited by these compositions,<br>
and they may inhibit both beneficial and detrimental metabolic processes within<br>
fruits. Moreover, some of the compositions contemplated comprise components<br>
which are not normally associated with fruits, vegetables and fungi, or that are<br>
normally found in such produce in much lesser quantities. The inclusion of many non-<br>
natural components may be undesirable to the consumer. Also, it is unknown whether<br>
the disclosed compositions may inhibit superficial scald-development in apples and<br>
pears.<br>
US 5,126,155 teaches the use of lysophosphatidylethanolamine for the<br>
treatment of pre harvest and post harvest applications.<br>
US 4,988,522 provides compositions useful in the treatment of cut plant parts<br>
to improve their quality and storage stability against the effects of oxidation, thermo-<br>
oxidation, enzymatic, microbial and metal ion attack. The compositions include an<br>
antioxidant, an enzyme inhibitor, an acidulant and a unique metal ion sequestrant<br>
which is compatible with the acidulant. Further, the patent teaches that the antioxidant<br>
may comprise ascorbic acid and that a chloride ion source may be included. The food<br>
preservative compositions disclosed are limited to dips and to treating cut surfaces of<br>
edible plant parts. There is no disclosure whether the compositions may be useful for<br>
the treatment of superficial scald and other disorders of unprocessed produce.<br>
US 3,526,520 discloses treating and controlling apple storage scald with<br>
compostitions comprising diphenylamine, an emulsifier, and an organic solvent.<br>
Diphenylamine is a material which may be degraded into potentially toxic<br>
compounds. Thus, it is preferable that novel compositions be developed which<br>
circumvent the use of diphenylamine to control scald in apples and other fruit.<br>
WO 91/05479 teaches of a preparation for treating apples, pears, and other<br>
vegetables to protect them against scald and cold damage. The composition comprises<br>
an aqueous solution of sucrose ester(s) and at least one antioxidant selected from<br>
natural and synthetic agents including tocopherols, ascorbic acid, esters of gallic acid,<br>
vitamin E, butylated hydroxy toluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), and 6-<br>
O-palmitoyl-L-ascorbic acid. A drawback to the disclosed compositions is that they<br>
employ antioxidants which are nonspecific in their functioning as opposed to<br>
employing compounds which may directly inhibit specific metabolic pathways that<br>
are activated as a result of scald development or cold damage. Furthermore, the<br>
application must be done post harvest.<br>
The post-harvest fumigation of apples with ethanol and longer chain alcohols<br>
such as hexanol has shown that higher alcohols are less effective than ethanol in<br>
controlling superficial scald (Ghahramani et al, 1999).<br>
There is a need in the art for compositions that are generally regarded as safe<br>
(GRAS) and that are capable of inhibiting superficial scald in apples and pears and<br>
preserving other produce such as, but not limited to fruits, vegetables and portions<br>
thereof. Moreover, there is a need in the art for compositions which preserve fruits,<br>
vegetables, other produce and flowers, wherein the composition may be applied by<br>
spray, drench or by dip. Also, there is a need in the art for compositions which may<br>
be used to preserve unprocessed, partially processed or fully processed produce.<br>
Further, there is a need in the art for compositions that may be applied either<br>
preharvest, or post harvest, for the preservation of fruits, vegetables, other produce<br>
and flowers, wherein the compositions comprise components which inhibit specific<br>
metabolic pathways and thus provide both targeted and preventative damage control.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to overcome drawbacks in the prior art.<br>
The above object is met by a combination of the features of the main claims.<br>
The sub claims disclose further advantageous embodiments of the invention.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The invention relates to compositions, and the use of compositions for<br>
improving the quality and shelf life of fruits, vegetables, partially processed products,<br>
and other produce.<br>
The following description is of a preferred embodiment by way of example<br>
only and without limitation to the combination of features necessary for carrying the<br>
invention into effect.<br>
The composition of the present invention may be used to negate the<br>
development of, but is not limited to, superficial scald, sunscald, maintain or increase<br>
anthocyanin levels, and inhibit other physiological disorders that may develop during<br>
the preharvest period or during post harvest storage. Also, the compositions of the<br>
present invention may enhance, maintain, or increase the color, firmness, sweetness,<br>
flavour, shelf life, chilling tolerance, weight, level of nutraceuticals, and level of<br>
phytochemicals of processed, unprocessed or partially processed produce. The<br>
application of one or more of the formulations described herein may be made either<br>
preharvest, while the product is still attached to a plant or tree, or post harvest.<br>
Unprocessed produce refers to harvested or unharvested fruits, vegetables or<br>
other produce which are not substantially different in appearance from their natural<br>
state. For example, apples harvested from trees or lettuce harvested from the ground<br>
are representative examples of unprocessed produce. Partially processed produce<br>
refers to produce which has been subjected to at least one mechanical, chemical or<br>
physical process which alters the natural state or appearance of the produce.<br>
Representative examples of partially processed produce include, but are not limited to<br>
producs which is cut, chopped, peeled, diced, mashed, squeezed, partially processed,<br>
etc. Fully processed produce refers to produce which have been subjected to multiple<br>
mechanical, chemical or physical processes.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a composition for the<br>
preservation of produce comprising at least one phospholipase D inhibitor, at least<br>
one compound comprising an isoprene subunit, and at least one component of the<br>
flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in a suitable medium. Optionally, the composition<br>
may also include at least one plant growth regulator of the cytokinin type, an<br>
antioxidant, a membrane stabilizing agent, a surfactant, or a combination thereof.<br>
By the term "preservation" it is meant the enhancement, maintenance or<br>
extension of the lifetime of the organoleptic qualities of the produce, for example, but<br>
not limited to color, sweetness, taste, flavor, storage-lifetime, nutritional quality or<br>
combinations thereof. These qualities can be determined using standard taste tests or<br>
visual inspection as would be known to a person of skill in the art.<br>
By the term "phospholipase D inhibitor", it is meant a compound which is<br>
capable of inhibiting the activity of phospholipase D. Preferably the phospholipase<br>
inhibitor exhibits inhibitory activity towards phospholipase D at micromolar or more<br>
dilute concentrations and reduces phospholipase D activity by at least about 10 %<br>
compared to the phospholipase D activity observed in the absence of the<br>
phospholipase D inhibitor. There are many assays known in the art which may be<br>
used to measure the activity of phospholipase D, for example but not limited to an<br>
assay described by Pinhero et al., (1998; which is herein incorporated by reference).<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, phospholipase D may be involved in the<br>
development of superficial scald (a form of targeted senescence, where the<br>
hypodermal cell layers undergo damage and deterioration), and other senescent<br>
processes.<br>
Phospholipase D inhibitors include, but are not limited to hexenal, hexanal,<br>
hexenol, hexanol, and combinations thereof. Someone of skill in the art will note that<br>
the fore-mentioned phospholipase D inhibitors comprise compounds having six<br>
carbon atoms (C6 compounds). The present invention also contemplates<br>
phospholipase D inhibitors having greater than six carbon atoms, for example, but not<br>
limited to geraniol, or less than six carbon atoms. Preferably, C6 components are<br>
employed in the composition of the present invention, as these components are<br>
naturally present in fruits and vegetables as flavor components. Other phopholipase<br>
D inhibitors may be used, for example but not limited to<br>
lysophosphatidylethanolamine (US 5,126,155, which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference). A non-limiting example of phospholipase D inhibitor is hexanal.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, hexanal, may be reduced to hexanol<br>
through the action of alcohol dehydrogenase-mediated reduction. The alcohols may<br>
be subject to esterification by alcohol:acyl CoA acyl transferase, giving rise to ester<br>
volatiles, that are integral components of flavour in apples and pears. Esters<br>
containing C6 components (hexanol, hexanoic acid) are common in apples. Scald-<br>
developing sides of apples produce lesser amounts of these esters than the normal<br>
sides (Paliyath et. al. 1997, Food Res. International, 30:95-103). Thus, supplying<br>
hexanal through a composition of the present invention may also have a protective<br>
effect.<br>
The compositions of the present invention comprise at least one compound<br>
comprising an isoprene unit (1,3 butadiene) of the formula:<br>
RrCH2-CH=C(CH3)-CH=R2<br>
where R1 and R2 may be any suitable chemical substituents. The compound<br>
comprising an isoprene subunit may comprise less than about 20 carbons, or less than<br>
about 15 carbons. In a non-limiting example, the compound comprising an isoprene<br>
subunit comprises less than or about 10 carbon atoms. However, mixtures of<br>
compounds comprising isoprene subunits with differing numbers of carbon atoms are<br>
contemplated by the present invention. Compounds comprising isoprene units<br>
include, but are not limited to, terpenic or monoterpenic compounds; for example, but<br>
not wishing to be limiting, monoterpenic compounds with a CIO skeleton, for<br>
example, geraniol, geranyl acetate, neral, nerol, citronellal, and citronellol.<br>
By the term "component of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway" it is meant<br>
any compound, intermediate or derivative thereof which may be used in the<br>
biosynthesis of flavonoids. Components of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway<br>
include but are not limited to coumaric acid, para-coumaric acid, trans-cinnamic acid,<br>
caffeic acid, phenylalanine, acetyl CoA and malonyl CoA. The component of the<br>
flavonoid biosynthetic pathway may be para-coumaric acid, trans-cinnamic acid,<br>
caffeic acid, or a combination thereof. For example, but not wishing to be limiting,<br>
the component of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway is para-coumaric acid.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, by adding one or more components of<br>
the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, this may enhance or prolong organoleptic<br>
qualities of produce by promoting the biosynthesis of flavonoids within the treated<br>
fruit or vegetable, which may in turn lead to the biosynthesis of anthocyanins. For<br>
example coumaric acid may be converted to coumaryl CoA by fruit and the<br>
combination of coumaryl CoA with 3 malonyl CoA gives rise to chalcone, the basic<br>
flavonoid skeleton. Biosynthesis of flavonoids increases during ripening in fruits, and<br>
this may lead to the biosynthesis of anthocyanins which provide colour to the fruit.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may also comprise a "plant growth<br>
regulator" selected from the group consisting cytokinins, cytokinin-type compounds,<br>
or compounds that exhibit a similar action to cytokinins. Preferably, the plant growth<br>
regulator has the ability to rejuvenate senescing tissues. Plant growth regulators may<br>
further include, but are not limited to, benzyl adenine, kinetin, isopentenyl-adenine,<br>
zeatin, polyamines, and polycationic amino acids, for example polylysine.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, one or more plant growth regulators,<br>
for example, but not limited to cytokinins, may enhance antioxidant function by<br>
inducing the biosynthesis of peroxidases which are important in the detoxification of<br>
reactive oxygen species. Superficial scald development has been associated with an<br>
enhanced level of active oxygen generation and a deficiency in antioxidant enzyme<br>
function. Without wishing to be bound by theory, benzyl adenine, polyamines or<br>
polycationic amino acids may enhance peroxidase levels within the epidermal and<br>
hypodermal cell layers of scald-susceptible apple cultivars (e.g. McIntosh, Red<br>
Delicious, Cortland, etc.) making these cultivars more resistant to the development of<br>
superficial scald.<br>
By the term "suitable medium" it is meant a solvent which is capable of<br>
dispersing, dissolving, or dispersing and dissolving, the components of the<br>
composition. A suitable medium may include, but is not limited to ethanol, or a<br>
combination of ethanol and water. As someone of skill in the art will understand a<br>
suitable medium must be non-damaging at the levels to be applied to the produce.<br>
Furthermore, the medium must be non-toxic at the concentration that would be<br>
ingested after applying an effective amount of the composition of the present<br>
invention to produce, and subsequently consuming the composition-coated produce.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may also comprise an antioxidant<br>
such as, but not limited to, ascorbic acid, ascorbyl palmitate, a-tocopherol, a-<br>
tocopheryl acetate, a- tocopherol acetate, or combinations thereof.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may also comprise a membrane<br>
stabilizing agent. By the term "membrane/cell wall stabilizing agent" it is meant a<br>
compound which enhances cell membrane, or cell wall integrity. Membrane/cell wall<br>
stabilizing agents include, but are not limited to polyamines, such as spermine,<br>
spermidine and the like, polymers such as, but not limited to chitin, and chitosan, and<br>
salts such as, but not limited to calcium chloride. A preferred membrane/cell wall<br>
stabilizing agent is calcium chloride, however, other compounds may be used if<br>
readily available, or if available at reasonable cost.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, membrane stabilizing agents such as<br>
calcium chloride may act as an important regulatory component of several<br>
biochemical processes in the cell, and enhance antioxidant enzyme system function<br>
and cell wall integrity.<br>
The composition of the present invention may also comprise one or more<br>
surfactants. By the term "surfactant" it is meant a compound which comprises both a<br>
relatively polar portion and a relatively apolar portion and which is capable reducing<br>
the surface tension of water. Surfactants include, but are not limited to food grade<br>
surfactants and detergents known by those skilled in the art, including watersoluble<br>
siloxylated polyether surfactant (e.g. Sylgard 309, Dow Corning), polyoxyethylene (20)<br>
sorbitan monolaurate (Tween® 20) and polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monopalmitate<br>
(Tween® 40). Preferably, the surfactant is a food grade surfactant.<br>
To preserve fruits, vegetables, other produce and flowers, the compositions of<br>
the present invention are applied in effective amounts to the fruit, vegetable, produce<br>
or flowers. This effective amount may be readily determined following the<br>
procedures outlined herein.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
composition comprising:<br>
• at least one phospholipase D inhibitor,<br>
• one or more compounds comprising an isoprene subunit,<br>
• one or more compounds of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway,<br>
• one or more antioxidant compounds.<br>
Such a composition, either alone, or in combination with other components is<br>
effective in reducing or eliminating scald, reducing softening, maintaining colour, and<br>
maintaining or increasing the soluble solid content in fruit (see Tables 1-3C and 4 -<br>
12B).<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided an enzyme<br>
activity modifier (EAM) composition comprising:<br>
• at least one phospholipase D inhibitor,<br>
• one or more compounds comprising an isoprene subunit, and<br>
• one or more compounds of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway.<br>
Such a composition, either alone, or in combination with other components is<br>
effective in reducing or eliminating scald, reducing softening and maintaining or<br>
increasing the soluble solid content in fruit (see Tables 3D and 9 in Examples 3 and 4,<br>
respectively). Furthermore, components of the EAM formulation are active in<br>
maintaining firmness or increasing soluble solids content of fruit (see Table 9,<br>
Example 4)<br>
The EAM formulation, or a component thereof, may be prepared as a stock<br>
solution comprising:<br>
• at least one phospholipase D inhibitor, from about 5 mM to about 500<br>
mM, preferably from about 40 mM to about 100 mM;<br>
• one or more compounds comprising an isoprene subunit, from about 5<br>
mM to about 500 mM, preferably from about 50 mM to about 100<br>
mM;and<br>
• one or more componds of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, from<br>
about 5 mM to about 500 mM, preferably from about 30 mM to about<br>
100 mM,<br>
and diluted before use.<br>
Compounds which may be optionally included in the compositions of the<br>
present invention include:<br>
• at least one plant growth regulator, from about 1 mM to about 50 mM,<br>
preferably from about 4 mM to about 10 mM.<br>
• one or more antioxidants, from about 5 mM to about 500 mM,<br>
preferably from about 50 mM to about 100 mM;<br>
• one or more membrane stabilizing agents from about 0.5 mM to about<br>
100 mM, preferably from about 10 mM to about 70 mM in the final<br>
solution; and<br>
a surfactant from about 0.001% to about 0.2%, preferably from 0.01 %<br>
to about 0.1% (w/w) in the final solution.<br>
A solution that may be applied to produce may be obtained by diluting the stock<br>
solution in water by about 100 to about 1,000 fold.<br>
Also provided within the present invention is an antioxidant (AOX)<br>
composition comprising ascorbate, ascorbate palmitate, a-tocopherol and a-<br>
tocopherol acetate. This composition is also effective in reducing scald and<br>
maintaining firmness in fruit (see Table 3E, Example 3), as well as in increasing the<br>
shelf life of cut flowers (see Table 13, Example 8). The AOX composition contains<br>
from about 5 mM to about 500 mM antioxidants an amount therebetween, for<br>
example but not limited to from about 50 mM to about 100 mM, or an amount there<br>
between.<br>
Compounds which may be optionally included in the compositions of the<br>
present invention include:<br>
• at least one plant growth regulator, from about 1 mM to about 50 mM,<br>
preferably from about 4 mM to about 10 mM.<br>
• one or more membrane stabilizing agents from about 0.5 mM to about<br>
100 mM, preferably from about 10 mM to about 70 mM in the final<br>
solution; and<br>
• a surfactant from about 0.001% to about 0.2%, preferably from 0.01%<br>
to about 0.1% (w/w) in the final solution.<br>
A solution that may be applied to produce may be obtained by diluting the stock<br>
solution in water by about 100 to about 1,000 fold.<br>
The present invention also contemplates compositions which may comprise<br>
two or more phospholipase D inhibitors, compounds comprising an isoprene subunit,<br>
components of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, and optionally two (or more) plant<br>
growth regulators, antioxidants, membrane stabilizing agents, surfactants, or<br>
combinations thereof. The components of each group may differ in hydrophobicity<br>
such that one of the components may partition preferentially into a membrane<br>
whereas the other component may remain in a more hydrophilic environment.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, the more hydrophobic component may<br>
provide protection against detrimental processes which originate in a membrane<br>
compartment, while the more hydrophilic component may provide protection against<br>
detrimental processes which originate in a hydrophilic compartment. For example, but<br>
not wishing to be limiting, the composition of the present invention may comprise<br>
geranyl acetate and geraniol as compounds comprising an isoprene unit. Without<br>
wishing to be bound by theory, geranyl acetate, which is more lipophilic than<br>
geraniol. Once inside the cell, endogenous esterase action may liberate geraniol from<br>
geranyl acetate.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may also comprise one or more<br>
antioxidants such as, but not limited to ascorbic acid, ascorbyl palmitate, a-<br>
tocopherol, a-tocopheryl acetate, a-tocopherol acetate, or combinations thereof.<br>
Antioxidants reduce the level of active oxygen species which may be a major<br>
contributor to scald development and spoilage of produce. Without wishing to be<br>
bound by theory, ascorbyl palmitate, tocopheryl acetate or a-tocopherol acetate are<br>
more hydrophobic than ascorbic acid and tocopherol, respectively and thus these more<br>
hydrophobic components may provide better protection within cell membranes.<br>
Reduction of the level of active oxygen species in produce such as, but not limited to<br>
fruits, vegetables and flowers may enhance and extend their shelf life and maintain<br>
their nutritional quality.<br>
The present invention also contemplates compositions wherein the individual<br>
components may have multiple functions. For example, but not wishing to be<br>
limiting, geraniol, a higher analog of hexanol, is a compound comprising an isoprene<br>
subunit, and this compound may also be capable of inhibiting phospholipase D<br>
activity.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may be applied to fruits, vegetables<br>
and flowers pre-harvest, post-harvest, or both. Further, application of the composition<br>
of the present invention may be performed using any methods known in the art. For<br>
example, but not wishing to be limiting, the composition of the present invention may<br>
be applied to produce as a spray, drench, dip, a vapor, or any combination thereof.<br>
Spray treatment may be preferable in instances such as pre-harvest application (where<br>
dipping or drenching may not be feasible). Further, spray treatment may reduce labor<br>
associated with dip treatments, for example, but not limited to storage operation costs<br>
and it may also eliminate waste disposal since exact quantities of the composition can<br>
be prepared and applied to produce. Vapor treatment may be used in post harvest<br>
applications, and could involve adding the composition as described herein to any<br>
suitable matrix, for example, but not limited to an impregnated papers, cloth or<br>
synthetic polymer sheet, packaging medium materials, and the impregnated matrix<br>
placed in the vicinity of the harvested produce. Compositions of the present<br>
invention, for example but not limited to AOX compsotions, applied to a matrix<br>
exhibit preservative activity (e.g. for broccoli florets: protein content at day 0:<br>
3.03mg/100mg FW, and after 12days in the control: 1 78mg/100mg FW; v. AOX<br>
treatment after 12 days: 2.39mg/100mg FW).<br>
Therefore, the present invention also provides a composition comprising a<br>
matrix material coated or impregnated with at least one phospholipase D inhibitor,<br>
one or more compounds comprising an isoprene subunit, one or more compounds of<br>
the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, and optionally one or more antioxidant<br>
compounds, a plant growth regulatory, one or more membrane stabilizing agents, a<br>
surfactant, or a combination thereof.<br>
The compositions of the present invention circumvent concerns associated<br>
with diphenylamine (DPA) disposal. For example, DPA cannot be discharged into<br>
water streams, but must be diluted and sprayed onto the orchard floor.<br>
It is also contemplated that the compositions of the present invention may be<br>
used for the storage of unprocessed, partially processed, or fully processed produce.<br>
Examples of such embodiment include, but are not limited to canned or pickled<br>
products.<br>
Application of the composition of the present invention to produce may<br>
enhance color development, for example, but not limited to, as in apples and peaches.<br>
Thus, the composition of the present invention may be applied to produce to<br>
potentially enhance the sweetness, colour (anthocyanins), flavour and keeping quality<br>
of fruits. Further, the present invention contemplates compositions which may be<br>
applied to grapes to enhance or maintain their nutraceutical quality, as well as wines<br>
made from them.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may also be used on many types of<br>
produce, for example, but not limited to monocots, dicots, legumes and fungi.<br>
Specific example include, but are not limited to apples, pears, cherries, peaches,<br>
nectarines, grapes, apricots, plums, prunes, soybeans, citrus fruits such as, but not<br>
limited to orange, grapefruits and tangerines, celery, carrots, broccoli, cabbage,<br>
brussel sprouts, spinach and other leafy vegetables, berry crops such as but not limited<br>
to blueberries, cranberries, currants, lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, peppers, herbs, and<br>
bananas.<br>
The composition of the present invention may be applied as; a preharvest spray<br>
to soybeans to potentially enhance the levels of proteins and isoflavonoids, to beets<br>
and sugar cane to enhance sugar levels, or to cereal crops to enhance the level of<br>
protein in the seeds. Further, flowers may be sprayed or dipped into the composition<br>
of the present invention. In such an embodiment, the compositions may enhance the<br>
longevity and extend the shelf-life of the flowers.<br>
The above description is not intended to limit the claimed invention in any<br>
manner, furthermore, the discussed combination of features might not be absolutely<br>
necessary for the inventive solution.<br>
All references are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
The present invention will be further illustrated in the following examples.<br>
However, it is to be understood that these examples are for illustrative purposes only,<br>
and should not be used to limit the scope of the present invention in any manner.<br>
EXAMPLE 1: A Representative Example of a Composition for the Preservation<br>
of Fruits, Vegetables and other Produce.<br>
An example of stock solutions that may be used for the treatment of produce is<br>
provided below, however it is to be understood that these solutions are provided as<br>
examples only and are not to be considered limiting in any manner.<br>
Stock Solution A comprises:<br>
83 mM Hexanal<br>
57 mM Geraniol<br>
44 mM Geranyl Acetate<br>
30 mM Coumaric acid<br>
8.8 mM Benzyl Adenine<br>
Stock Solution B comprises:<br>

5-10 mL of Solution A is mixed with 5-10 mL of Solution B, and the resulting<br>
solution is diluted in water to 1L. Optionally, calcium chloride (1% w/v) and a<br>
surfactant (0.01% w/v) may be included in the final 1L solution. The formulation may<br>
be applied to processed or unprocessed fruits, vegetables, produce or flowers as a<br>
preharvest or postharvest spray or dip. Alternatively, the formulation may be added to<br>
a liquid which surrounds vegetables, produce or flowers, applied using an atomizer, or<br>
applied to a matrix for use as a vapor treatment of produce.<br>
EXAMPLE 2: Effect of Preservative Compositions of the Present Invention on<br>
Scald Development in Apples<br>
A) Effects of Spraying Compositions of the Present Invention on Scald<br>
Development in Apples<br>
The effect of the compositions of the current invention on the scald<br>
development is examined. About 4 bushels of apples are divided into about 4 sets of<br>
about 50-60 apples each. One set of apples is dipped into a control solution of water<br>
comprising 10 mL/L ethanol and 1 mL/L detergent (ABG 7045; or Sylgard 309, Dow<br>
Corning) while another set is dipped in a composition of the present invention<br>
prepared according to Example 1 comprising Solutions A, B and C. Apples are<br>
allowed to dry and are subsequently transferred to air (0°C) or a controlled<br>
atmosphere comprising 3% O2, 2.5% CO2 at 0°C. Air stored apples are examined after<br>
about 18-19 weeks, while controlled atmosphere-stored apples are brought out after<br>
about 20-21 weeks. Apples are evaluated for scald after about one week after storing<br>
at room temperature. Apples that show any discolouration (browning) are considered<br>
scalded apples. The percentage scald represents the number of apples exhibiting scald<br>
divided by the total number of apples in the sample multiplied by 100 %. In Trials 1<br>
and 3, apples are brought to room temperature after storage. In Trials 2 and 4, apples<br>
are evaluated after 1 week of storage at room temperature. The results are illustrated<br>
in Table 1.<br>
aSEM: standard error of the mean. Trials 1 and 3 represent data obtained when apples<br>
are brought to room temperature. Trials 2 and 4 represent data obtained when apples<br>
are evaluated after one week at room temperature.<br>
As shown in table 1, the composition of the present invention reduces scald<br>
development in apples. Further, a reduction in scald development is observed<br>
regardless of whether the apples are stored in air or under controlled atmosphere<br>
conditions.<br>
B) Effects of Spraying Compositions of the Present Invention on Scald<br>
Development in Apples<br>
Two trees are used as controls and two trees are used for treatment using a<br>
composition prepared according to Example 1 comprising solutions A, B and C.<br>
About two weeks after spraying with the composition of the present invention, about<br>
half of the apples on each tree were harvested (HI) and the trees were sprayed again.<br>
The remainder of the apples were harvested about 1 week later (H2). Harvested apples<br>
are stored in air or under a controlled atmosphere (3% O2, 2.5% CO2, 0°C) for about 4<br>
weeks. After storage, apples are evaluated for scald. Scald was evaluated as described<br>
in Example 1.<br>
As shown in table 2, the compositions of the present invention may be sprayed<br>
onto apples to reduce the development of scald. Further, a reduction in scald<br>
development is observed regardless of whether the apples are stored in air or under<br>
controlled atmosphere conditions.<br>
Referring now to Table 3A, there is shown the effect of the composition<br>
prepared according to Example 1 of the present invention on the development of scald<br>
in various apple varieties. The composition of the present invention is applied as<br>
described above.<br>
The compositions of the present invention are useful for inhibiting scald<br>
development in many varieties of apples. As shown in table 3A, compositions of the<br>
present invention reduce scald development in varieties of apples such as but not<br>
limited to Morspur McIntosh, Marshall Mclntosh, Cortland, and Red Delicious. The<br>
effect of the composition of the present invention on Empire apples, which are<br>
resistant to scald is used as a control.<br>
The results suggest that the formulation of the present invention does not<br>
damage fruit. Further, a reduction in scald development is observed in most apples<br>
regardless of whether the apples are stored in air or under controlled atmosphere<br>
conditions.<br>
C) Effect of the composition of the present invention on superficial scald<br>
development in apples.<br>
Apples were harvested at optimum maturity as indicated by a starch test as<br>
known to those skilled in the art. Apples (50-60) were dipped in the formulation of<br>
Example 1 (diluted at 10 ml/litre) for a period of 5 min. and allowed to dry at room<br>
temperature. The dipped apples, along with untreated controls were stored in air at<br>
0*C for a period of six months before analysis. Apples were brought to room<br>
temperature, twenty representative apples were picked at random from each replicate<br>
and left at room temperature for a period of one week prior to estimating scald.<br>
Results are present in Table 3B.<br>
D) Effect of the composition, and components of the composition, of the present<br>
invention on superficial scald development and softening in apples.<br>
The effects of antioxidant formulation of the present invention, and subgroups<br>
of its chemical components on post harvest qualities of Cortland apples were<br>
investigated.<br>
Apples were dipped in:<br>
1) the whole formulation (prepared as outline in Example 1), these results are shown<br>
in Table 3C;<br>
2) a subgroup that comprises enzyme activity modulators (EAM), these results are<br>
shown in Table 3D;<br>
3) another subgroup containing antioxidants (AOX), these results presented in Table<br>
3E;'<br>
4) 1500 ppm of diphenylamine (DPA; the present method of controlling scald, results<br>
in each of Tables 3C-3E); or<br>
5) left untreated, (control, results presented in each of Tables 3C-3E).<br>
The effect of the duration of dip treatment of Cortland apples using the<br>
antioxidant formulation (Example 1, Solution B) is presented in Table 3C. Ten ml of<br>
the formulation of was diluted to a litre. The solution also contained 1% calcium<br>
chloride (w/v final) and 0.1% (v/v final) surfactant. Two bushels of apples were<br>
dipped in 40 litres of the formulation from 10 seconds, up to 5 minutes as indicated in<br>
Table 3C, allowed to dry overnight and stored under controlled atmosphere (2.5%<br>
oxygen, 3% carbon dioxide, 3 °C) in a commercial storage operation for 9 months<br>
before evaluation. Twenty randomly selected apples from each of the treatments were<br>
removed and kept at room temperature for a week before evaluations were conducted.<br>
Table 3C: Thee effect of Composition of the Present Invention (Example 1) on<br>
Scald development in Cortland apples. The number of apples showing scald or<br>
softening is expressed as a percentage of the total number of apples evaluated.<br>
The results in Table 3C demonstrates that use of the entire formulation reduces<br>
both superficial scald and softening in fruit. Furthermore, the composition of<br>
Example 1 is as, or more, effective than DPA treatment.<br>
The effect of a modified formulation of Example 1, comprising enzyme<br>
activity modulators (EAM-formulation), on superficial scald development and<br>
softening is presented in Table 3D. The modified formulation comprises hexanal,<br>
geraniol, geranyl acetate and coumaric acid at the concentration originally present in<br>
the full formulation. No benzyl adenine L-ascorbic acid, ascorbyl palmitate, a-<br>
tocopherol, a-tocopherol acetate is present in the EAM formulation.<br>
Ten ml of the concentrate of the EAM formulation was diluted to one litre to<br>
form the final solution. The solution also contained calcium chloride (1% w/v, final)<br>
and surfactant (0.1% v/v final). Two bushels of apples were dipped in 40 litres of<br>
solution for each time period and subjected to controlled atmosphere storage as<br>
defined above. Apples were brought out after 9 months of storage. Twenty apples<br>
from each treatment were picked randomly from two independent sets, and left at<br>
room temperature for one week before evaluating for scald and softening.<br>
The results in Table 3D demonstrates that use of the EAM formulation is<br>
effective in reducing superficial scald. However, this treatment appears to reduce the<br>
softening considerably, potentially due to a reduction of membrane phospholipid<br>
degradation.<br>
The effect of a second modified formulation of the present invention,<br>
comprising antioxidants (AOX formulation) on superficial scald development and<br>
softening is presented in Table 3E. The components of the AOX formulation include<br>
ascorbate, ascorbate palmitate, a-tocopherol and a-tocopheryl acetated (or a-<br>
tocopherbl acetate) at the concentration originally present in the full formulation. No<br>
hexanal, geraniol, geranyl acetate, coumaric acid or benzyl adenine were present in<br>
the AOX formualtion.<br>
Ten ml of the concentrate of the AOX formulation was diluted to one litre to<br>
form the final solution. The solution also contained calcium chloride (1% w/v final)<br>
and surfactant (0.1% v/v, final). Two bushels of apples were dipped in 40 litres of<br>
solution for each time period and subjected to controlled atmosphere storage as<br>
defined above. Apples were brought out after 9 months of storage. Twenty apples,<br>
from each treatment were picked randomly from two independent sets, and left at<br>
room temperature for one week before evaluating for scald and softening. The results<br>
are presented in Table 3E.<br>
The results in Table 3E demonstrates that use of the AOX formulation reduces<br>
both superficial scald and softening in fruit.<br>
The effect of benzyladenine (BA) on superficial scald development and<br>
softening was also examined (BA formualtion). BA was applied at the concentration<br>
originally present in the full formulation of Example 1. The BA formulation did not<br>
comprises any hexanal, geraniol, geranyl acetate, cournaric acid, ascorbic acid,<br>
ascorbyl palmitate, a-tocopherol, or tocopherol acetate.<br>
Ten ml of the concentrate was diluted to a litre to form the final solution. The<br>
solution also contained calcium chloride (1% w/v final) and surfactant (0.1% v/v,<br>
final). Two bushels of apples were dipped in 40 litres of solution for each time period<br>
and subjected to controlled atmosphere storage as defined above. Apples were<br>
brought out after 9 months of storage. Twenty apples, from each treatment were<br>
picked randomly from two independent sets, and left at room temperature for a week<br>
before evaluating for scald and softening. The results are presented in Table 3F.<br>
The results from Table 3E demonstrate that Benzyladenine application is<br>
moderately effective in reducing superficial scald and softening<br>
Collectively, the results from Tables 3 A-3E demonstrate that the composition<br>
of Example 1 are effective at reducing or eliminating superficial scald in fruit and<br>
reducing softening in fruit. Furthermore, components of the composition of Example<br>
1, including enzyme activity modulators (EAM formulation), antoxidants (AOX<br>
formulation), or benzyladcninc (BA formualtion), in the absence of other components,<br>
exhibit activity in reducing or eliminating superficial scald and in reducing fruit<br>
softening.<br>
EXAMPLE 3: Effect of Spraying Compositions according to the present<br>
invention onto Red Haven Peaches.<br>
Firmness and soluble solids<br>
A formulation prepared according to Example I, comprising solutions A, B<br>
and C, is prepared and sprayed onto two trees (about 4L/tree) about one month before<br>
harvest (+composition). Two control trees are sprayed with a similar amount of a<br>
solution comprising absolute ethanol (5 mL/L) and a water-soluble siloxylated polyether<br>
detergent (Sylgard 309, Dow Corning), 1 mL/L (sprayed control), and<br>
two unsprayed trees are used as controls (unsprayed controls). All trees are of about the<br>
same age and all possessed the same root stocks. Peaches are harvested and quality<br>
parameters are analysed about 24 hours and one week post harvest. The results are<br>
described in Table 4.<br>
*Soluble solids were estimated by monitoring the refractive index of the produce with<br>
a hand-held refractometer as would be evident to someone of skill in the art.<br>
However, other methods known in the art may be employed to measure soluble solids<br>
as would be evident to someone of skill in the art.<br>
As shown in Table 4, the composition of the present invention enhances<br>
firmness, maintains soluble solids, and maintains or increases the average weight of<br>
produce suggesting that the compositions of the present invention are effective at<br>
preserving fruits, vegetables and other produce.<br>
Colour development<br>
The effect of the compositions of the present invention was further assessed on<br>
the colour development of red haven peaches. A batch often peach trees were<br>
randomly selected and sprayed with the composition of the present invention<br>
(Example 1), the same number of trees were left untreated as control. Peaches were<br>
harvested at optimum ripeness and examined for colour development after five days.<br>
The peaches were stored at a temperature of 25 °C for full ripening. The colour<br>
values of 15 randomly selected peaches from each tree (10 control, 10 sprayed) were<br>
estimated, varying from 0 (no or very little colour) to a maximum of 8. The<br>
formulation was sprayed twice (2-4L/tree depending on size) one month and fifteen<br>
days before harvest. The summary of the results is shown in Table 5.<br>
The results shown in Table 5 indicate that the composition of the present<br>
invention enhances and maintains colour development in peaches.<br>
EXAMPLE 4 - Effects of the Composition of the Present Invention on Cherries<br>
Hedel Cherries<br>
The formulation of the present invention, prepared according to the method<br>
outlined in Example 1, comprising 1 % (w/v) calcium chloride and 0.1% (v/v)<br>
surfactant were applied to one side of a cherry tree (4 L per side), the other side was<br>
left as a control. Four separate Hedel Cherry trees were sprayed. Cherries were<br>
harvested 2 weeks after spraying. The results are shown in Table 6 below.<br>
The results shown in Table 6 demonstrate that the compositions of the present<br>
invention may be employed to enhance the quality of cherries.<br>
The colour intensity of cherries was also determined in sprayed and unsprayed<br>
cherries. Samples were extracted in 95% ethanol over night, and the intensity of<br>
extracted colour determined at 500nm. An increase in the OD was observed in<br>
ethanol extracts obtained from cherries that had been sprayed (OD 0.64 and 0.77<br>
control, to 0.69 and 0.82 treated, respectively).<br>
In alternate tests, the composition of the present invention was applied to<br>
cherry trees as described above. Cherries were harvested from the unsprayed and<br>
sprayed half of the trees. All the cherries within an equal segment were harvested<br>
irrespective of their conditions and separated into good, damaged and dry groups.<br>
"Damaged" was characterized by excessive softening, splitting or fungal infection.<br>
The results are shown in Table 7.<br>
The results shown in Table 7 indicate that the composition of the present invention<br>
protects and enhances the quality of cherries.<br>
Vista Cherries<br>
A modified formulation comprising hexanal, geraniol geranyl acetate, benzyl<br>
adenine, ascorbate and ?-tocopherol, 1 % (w/v) calcium chloride and 0.1% (v/v)<br>
water-soluble siloxylated polyether surfactant (Sylgard 309, Dow Corning) was prepared<br>
according to the method outlined in Example 1. The modified formulation did not<br>
comprise coumaric acid, ascorbyl palmitate and tocopherol acetate. The modified<br>
formulation was applied to one side of a cherry tree (4 L per side), the other side was left<br>
as a control. The spray treatment was repeated at least two weeks prior to harvest. Three<br>
separate Vista Cherry trees were sprayed. Cherries were harvested 2 weeks after<br>
spraying and stored at 4°C in air. Quality of the cherries was evaluated every 2 weeks for<br>
an 8 week period. The results (mean of 20 independent samples, three estimations per<br>
sample) are shown in Table 8.<br>
The results shown in Table 8 demonstrate that modified compositions of the<br>
present invention may be employed to enhance the quality of cherries.<br>
Effect of individual compounds of the Compositions of the present invention<br>
Vista cherries were dipped in the antioxidant formulation as described above,<br>
as well as separate compound of the composition of the present invention, to evaluate<br>
the effects of individual components on shelf life and quality. The samples were<br>
dipped for 2.5 min in various components made into an aqueous solution containing<br>
0.1% surfactant (ABG 7045; Sylgard 309, Dow Coming may also be used), ethanol<br>
(10ml/l) and the required amount of the component(s). Samples were allowed to dry<br>
at room temperature and stored at 4°C in air. Evaluations were conducted two weeks<br>
and four weeks after treatment. The results given are mean of twenty sample values.<br>
The results are shown in Table 9.<br>
These results indicate that geraniol, geranyl acetate, hexanal, CaCl2 and BA<br>
result in increased firmness when applied to Vista cherries either alone or in<br>
combination. Geraniol, geranyl acetate, hexanal and a-tocopherol result in an increase<br>
in soluble solids. Furthermore, compositions comprising geraniol, geranyl acetate,<br>
hexanal, BA and CaCl2 exhibit good firmness and soluble solids properties when<br>
applied to Vista cherries.<br>
Bing Cherries<br>
The composition as described in Example 1, comprising hexanal, geraniol<br>
geranyl acetate, benzyl adenine, ascorbate and a-tocopherol, 1 % (w/v) calcium<br>
chloride and 0.1% (v/v) surfactant was prepared and applied as a pre-harvest spray to<br>
one side of a cherry tree (4 L per side), the other side was left as a control. The spray<br>
treatment was repeated at least two weeks prior to harvest. Three separate Bing<br>
Cherry trees were sprayed. Cherries were harvested 2 weeks after spraying and stored<br>
at 4°C in air. Quality of the cherries was evaluated every 2 weeks for an 8 week<br>
period. The results (mean of 20 independent samples, three estimations per sample)<br>
are shown in Table 10.<br>
The results shown in Table 10 further demonstrate that compositions of the<br>
present invention may be employed to enhance the quality of cherries.<br>
EXAMPLE 5 - Effects of the Composition of the Present Invention on Grapes<br>
The effect of the composition of the present invention was assessed on grapes.<br>
Pinot Noir and Merlot grape vines were sprayed with the formulation of Example 1,<br>
comprising 1% calcium chloride and 0.1% (v/v) surfactant twice (two months and one<br>
month) prior to harvest. All bunches from unsprayed and sprayed vines were<br>
harvested. The results are shown in Tablel.<br>
The results shown in Table 11 show that application of the formulation of the present<br>
invention to grapes significantly increases the yield weight of the grapes compared to<br>
grapes that are not treated with the formulation of the present invention. In addition to<br>
enhanced yield of the grapes, the treated grapes exhibited a better colour and appeared<br>
to be of a better quality than grapes that were not treated with the composition of the<br>
present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 6 - Effects of the Composition of the Present Invention on Plums<br>
Two varieties of blue plums, "Valerie" and "Valour" were sprayed with the<br>
composition. Alternate trees were assigned as control and for spray treatment within<br>
the same row. The variety "Valerie" received only one spray, as it was close to<br>
ripening. "Valour" received two sprays of the formulation, one month and 15 days<br>
before harvest. Fruits were harvested at optimum ripeness and stored at 4°C in air.<br>
The data are the mean values of measurements from 10 plums from each tree, with<br>
three unsprayed control trees and four trees sprayed with the formulation. The data<br>
are presented in Tables 12A and 12B<br>
These results demonstrate that firmness is improved with pre-harvest<br>
application of the compositions of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 7: Phospholipase D Enzyme Assay<br>
Phospholipase D (PLD) activity may be determined as described by Pinhero et<br>
al., 1998 by measuring the release of radiolabeled choline from l,2-dipalmitoyl-L3-<br>
phosphatidyl(N-methyl-3H)choline at 23° C. The basic assay mixture contains 0.1M<br>
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 mM EGTA, membrane or cytosol protein (2.5 mg) and about<br>
100,000 dpm of choline-labelled phosphatidylcholine in 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100<br>
(0.01% final), to make a total volume of 1 mL. To study the regulation of PLD by<br>
various compounds, the compound is added to the basic reaction mixture. The<br>
reaction is terminated after 10 min by adding 100 mL of 4N HC1 followed by 1 mL of<br>
chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and left overnight. The amount of [3H]choline<br>
released during the reaction is determined by mixing a 0.5 mL aliquot of the aqueous<br>
phase directly into 5 mL of scintillation fluid (Ecolume, ICN) and determining the<br>
amount of radiolabel using a Beckman LS 6800 Scintillation counter (Beckman<br>
Instruments).<br>
Estimation of PLD activity by monitoring the liberation of choline is a<br>
convenient and rapid method, but may be performed using other methods known in<br>
the art, for example, but not limited to, estimating PLD activity using fluorescent<br>
substrates or by estimating the amount of phosphatidylethanol formed (Harris et al.,<br>
1995; Pinhero et al., 1998).<br>
EXAMPLE 8 - Effects of the Composition of the Present Invention on Cut<br>
Flowers<br>
The effect of the antioxidant composition of the present invention was<br>
assessed on cut flowers. Miniature white carnation flowers at stage 1 (tight bud stage)<br>
were divided into three groups of forty. One group was kept as control, another<br>
control group was sprayed with a solution containing 0.1 mL absolute ethanol and 0.1<br>
mL ABG 7045 (Sylgard 309, Dow Coming may also be used). The third group was<br>
sprayed with a solution comprising 0.025 mL of the AOX formulation concentrate<br>
(Example 1, Solution B) and 0.1 mL ABG 7045 in 200 mL distilled water. The<br>
flowers were incubated at room temperature under normal illumination for ten days.<br>
The results are shown in Table 13.<br>
Stage 1 - tight bud; Stage 2 - partially open with yellow-tinted centre; Stage 3 - fully<br>
open white flowers; Stage 4 - petals show withering at the tip; Stage 5 - fully withered<br>
flowers<br>
As there was no difference in the pattern of senescence between the unsprayed<br>
and sprayed controls, only the sprayed control is shown in Table 13. The results<br>
shown in Table 13 show that application of the AOX formulation of the present<br>
invention to cut flowers significantly decreases the senescence, therefore increasing<br>
the shelf life, of the flowers compared to flowers that are not treated with the<br>
formulation of the present invention.<br>
