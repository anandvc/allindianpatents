l-Arenesulfonvl-2-arvI-pvrrolidine and piperidine derivatives<br>
The present invention is concerned with l-arenesulfonyl-2-aryl-pyrrolidine and piperidine derivatives of the general formula<br>
wherein <br>
R1	signifies hydrogen or lower alkyl;<br>
R	signifies furyl, thienyl, pyridyl or phenyl, which is optionally<br>
substituted by 1 to 3 substituents, selected from lower alkyl, lower<br>
alkoxy, halogen, cyano, CF3 or -N(R4)2;<br>
R3	signifies naphthyl or phenyl, which is optionally substituted by 1 to 3<br>
substituents, selected from lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, halogen, acetyl,<br>
cyano, hydroxy-lower alkyl, -CH2-morpholin-4-yl, lower alkyl-oxy-<br>
lower alkyl, lower alkyl-N(R4)2 or CF3;<br>
' R4	. "'■■   signifies, independently from each other, hydrogen or lower alkyl,<br>
as well as their pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts.<br>
Compounds of formula I are novel with the exception of (RS)-2-phenyl-l~ (toluene-4-sulfonyl)-pyrrolidine, (RS)-l-(toluene-4-sulfonyl)-2-p-tolyl-pyrrolidine, N-tosyl-cis-3-methyl-2-phenyI pyrrolidine, 3-[ l-(toluene-4-sulfonyl)-pyrrolidin-2-yljpyridine and N-tosyl-2-(3,4-dimethoxy-phenyl)-pyrrolidine. The manufacture of these compounds is described in J. Org. Chem., 51, (1986) 4089-4090. Furthermore, the preparation of (RS)-2-phenyl-l-(toluene-4-sulfonyl)-pyrrolidine is described in Liebigs Ann. Chem., 762, (1972) 93-105,<br><br>
It has surprisingly been found that the compounds of general formula I are metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists and/or agonists. Compounds of formula I are distinguished by valuable therapeutic properties.<br>
In the central nervous system (CNS) the transmission of stimuli takes place by the interaction of a neurotransmitter, which is sent out by a neuron, with a neuroreceptor.<br>
L-glutamic acid, the most commonly occurring neurotransmitter in the CNS, plays a critical role in a large number of physiological processes. The glutamate-dependent stimulus receptors are divided into two main groups. The first main group forms ligand-controlled ion channels. The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) belong to the second main group and, furthermore, belong to the family of G-protein-coupled receptors.<br>
At present, eight different members of these mGluR are known and of these some even have sub-types. On the basis of structural parameters, the different influences on the synthesis of secondary metabolites and the different affinity to low-molecular weight chemical compounds, these eight receptors can be sub-divided into three sub-groups:<br>
mGluRl and mGluR5 belong to group I, mGluR2 and mGluR3 belong to group II and mGIuR4, mGluR6, mGluR7 and mGluR8 belong to group III.<br>
Ligands of metabotropic glutamate receptors belonging to the first group can be used for the treatment or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders such as psychosis, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, cognitive disorders and memory deficits, as well as chronic and acute pain.<br>
Other treatable indications in this connection are restricted brain function caused by bypass operations or transplants, poor blood supply to the brain, spinal cord injuries, head injuries, hypoxia caused by pregnancy, cardiac arrest and hypoglycaemia. Further treatable indications are Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), dementia caused by AIDS, eye injuries, retinopathy, idiopathic parkinsonism or parkinsonism caused by medicaments as well as conditions which lead to glutamate-deficiency functions, such as e.g. muscle spasms, convulsions, migraine, urinary incontinence, nicotine addiction, opiate addiction, anxiety, vomiting, dyskinesia and depressions.<br>
Objects of the present invention are compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts per se and as pharmaceutical^ active substances, their manufacture, medicaments based on a compound in accordance with the invention and their production as well as the use of the compounds in accordance with the invention in<br><br>
the control or prevention of illnesses of the aforementioned kind, and, respectively, for the production of corresponding medicaments.<br>

with a compound of formula<br>
hal<br><br>
0=S—R3<br><br>
III<br><br>
O<br><br>
and, it desired,<br>
converting a functional group in a compound of formula I into another functional group<br>
and, if desired,<br>
converting a compound of formula I into a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt.<br>
In accordance with the invention, an appropriately substituted compound of formula II, for example (RS)-2-(3-fluoro-phenyl)-pyrrolidine, is reacted with a suitable compound of formula III, for example toluene-4-sulfonyl chloride. The reaction according to known methods takes place at room temperature within 16 hours in an inert solvent, for example in dichloromethane. After evaporating the solvent, the mixture is dissolved in water and extracted with a suitable solvent, for example ethyl acetate and purified using known methods.<br>
In particular, cyano groups can be hydrogenated to amino groups or halogen atoms in halogenated lower alkyl groups can be substituted with amins or converted to ethers.<br>
The hydrogenation is preferrably effected with Raney-nickel at room temperature under normal pressure and the amino group can be alkylated by known methods.<br>
The ether formation of benzylchloride derivatives can be conveniently carried out as follows: A compound of general formula I which contains a halogenated lower alkyl group, for example (RS)-2-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-l-(4-chloromethyl-benzenesulfonyl)-<br>
pyrrolidine is reacted with sodium methanolate in MeOH for 80 hours at 50°C and purified using known methods.<br>
The substitution of a halogen atom in a halogenated lower alkyl group with an amine can be conveniently carried out as follows: A compound of general formula I which contains a halogenated lower alkyl group, for example (RS)-2-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-l-(4-chloromethyl-benzenesulfonyl)-pyrrolidine is reacted with morpholine in DMF for 17<br>
hours at 80°C and purified using known methods.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be manufactured readily according to methods known per se and taking into consideration the nature of the compound to be converted into a salt. Inorganic or organic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid or citric acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, methanesulphonic acid, p-toluenesulphonic acid and the like are suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of basic compounds of formula I. Compounds which contain the alkali<br><br>
metals or alkaline earth metals, for example sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium or the like, basic amines or basic amino acids are suitable for the formation or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of acidic compounds.<br>
Scheme 1 gives an overview of the manufacture of the compounds of formula I starting from known compounds. Substituents Rl present in the compounds of formula I are introduced according to methods known to the person skilled in the art. The manufacture of representative compounds of formula I is described in detail in examples 1-91.<br>
Scheme 2 and scheme 3 give an overview of the conversions of functional groups in compounds of formula I described in detail in examples 85-87.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are, as already mentioned above, metabotropic glutamate receptor agonists and/or antagonists and can be used for the treatment or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders, such as psychosis, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, cognitive disorders and memory deficits, as well as acute and chronic pain. Other treatable indications are restricted brain function caused by bypass operations or transplants, poor blood supply to the brain, spinal cord injuries, head injuries, hypoxia caused by pregnancy, cardiac arrest and hypoglycaemia. Further treatable indications are Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's chorea, ALS, dementia caused by AIDS, eye injuries, retinopathy, idiopathic parkinsonism or parkinsonism caused by medicaments as well as conditions which lead to glutamate-deficient functions, such as e.g. muscle spasms, convulsions, migraine, urinary incontinence, nicotine addiction, psychoses, opiate addiction, anxiety, vomiting, dyskinesia and depression. The compounds of the present invention are group I mGlu receptor agonists and/or antagonists. It has been shown that the compounds of examples 1 - 4, 6, 8,9,11 - 14, 16, 19, 21, 25, 26, 28, 29, 31, 38, 39, 40,42, 48, 55, 56, 58, 60, 69, 72, 76, 77, 78, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 88, 89 and 90 show agonistic activity, the other specific examples have an antagonistic activity to the mGlu receptor. The compounds show activities, as measured in<br><br>
the assay described below, of 50 \xM or less, typically 3 J0.M or less, and ideally of 0.5 |oM or less.<br>
In the table below are shown some specific activity-data:<br><br>
cDNA encoding rat mGlu la receptor obtained from Prof. S. Nakanishi (Kyoto, Japan) was transiently transfected into EBNA cells using a procedure described by Schlaeger et. al, New Dev. New Appl. Anim. Cell Techn., Proc. ESACT Meet., 15th (1998),<br>
105-112 and 117-120. [Ca2+]i measurements were performed on mGlu la transfected EBNA cells after incubation of the cells with Fluo-3 AM (0.5 |iM final concentration) for 1 hour at 37°C followed by 4 washes with assay buffer (DMEM supplemented with Hank's salt and 20 mM HEPES. [Ca2+]i measurements were done using a fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR, Molecular Devices Corporation, La Jolla, CA, USA). When compounds were evaluated as antagonists they were tested against 10 pM glutamate as agonist.<br>
The inhibition (antagonists) or activation (agonists) curves were fitted with a four parameter logistic equation giving EC50, IC301 and Hill coefficient using the iterative non linear curve fitting software Origin (Microcal Software Inc., Northampton, MA, USA).<br>
The compounds of formula I and pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts thereof can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. However, the admini-<br><br>
stration can also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.<br>
The compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical preparations. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like; depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, however, usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose and the like. Adjuvants, such as alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils and the like, can be used for aqueous injection solutions of water-soluble salts of compounds of formula I, but as a rule are not necessary. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.<br>
In addition, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.<br>
As mentioned earlier, medicaments containing a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a therapeutically inert excipient are also an object of the present invention, as is a process for the production of such medicaments which comprises bringing one or more compounds of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and, if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical dosage form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.<br>
The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, the effective dosage for oral or parenteral administration is between 0.01-20 mg/kg/day, with a dosage of 0.1-10 mg/ kg/day being preferred for all of the indications described. The daily dosage for an adult human being weighing 70 kg accordingly lies between 0.7-1400 mg per day, preferably between 7 and 700 mg per day.<br><br>
Finally, as mentioned earlier, the use of compounds of formula I and of pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts thereof for the production of medicaments, especially for the control or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders of the aforementioned kind, is also an object of the invention.<br>
