In order to apply a compound of foR""ula (1) to a plant, to a seed of a plant, to the locus of the plant or seed or to soil or any other growth medium, a compound of foR""ula (1) is usually foR""ulated into a composition which includes, in addition to the compound of foR""ula (1), a suitable inert diluent or carrier and, optionally, a surface actNe agent (SFA). SFAs are chemicals that are able to modify the properties of an interface (for example, liquid/solid, liquid/air or liquid/liquid interfaces) by lowering the interfacial tension and thereby leading to changes in other properties (for example dispersion, emulsification and wetting). It is preferred that all compositions (both solid and liquid foR""ulations) comprise, by weight, 0.0001 to 95%, more preferably 1 to 85%, for example 5 to 60%, of a compound of foR""ula (1). The composition is generally used for the control of fungi such that a compound of foR""ula (1) is applied at a rate of from O.lg to 10kg per hectare, preferably from lg to 6kg per hectare, more preferably from lg to 1kg per hectare.<br>
When used in a seed dressing, a compound of foR""ula (1) is used at a rate of 0.000 lg to lOg (for example 0.00lg or 0.05g), preferably 0.005g to lOg, more preferably 0.005g to 4g, per kilogram of seed.<br>
In another aspect the present invention provides a fungicidal composition comprising<br>
a fungicidally effectNe amount of a compound of foR""ula (1) and a suitable carrier or diluent<br>
therefor.	<br>
In a still further aspect the invention provides a method of combating and controlling fungi at a locus, which comprises treating the fungi, or the locus of the fungi with a fungicidally effectNe amount of acorn:<br><br>
The compositions can be chosen from a number of foR""ulation types, including dustable powders (DP), soluble powders (SP), water soluble granules (SG), water dispersible granules (WG), wettable powders (WP), granules (GR) (slow or fast release), soluble concentrates (SL), oil miscible liquids (OL), ultra low volume liquids (UL), emulsifiable concentrates (EC), dispersible concentrates (DC), emulsions (both oil in water (E\V) and water in oil (EO)), micro-emulsions (ME), suspension concentrates (SC), aerosols, fogging/smoke foR""ulations, capsule suspensions (CS) and seed treatment foR""ulations. The foR""ulation type chosen in any instance will depend upon the particular purpose envisaged and the physical; chemical and biological properties of the compound of foR""ula (1).<br>
Dustable powders (DP) may be prepared by mixing a compound of foR""ula (1) with one or more solid diluents (for example natural clays, kaolin, pyrophyllite, bentonite, alumina, montmorillonite, kieselguhr, chalk, diatomaceous earths, calcium phosphates, calcium and magnesium carbonates, sulphur, lime, flours, talc and other organic and inorganic solid carriers) and mechanically grinding the mixture to a fine powder.<br>
Soluble powders (SP) may be prepared by mixing a compound of foR""ula (1) with one or more water-soluble inorganic salts (such as sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate or magnesium sulphate) or one or more water-soluble organic solids (such as a polysaccharide) and, optionally, one or more wetting agents, one or more dispersing agents or a mixture of said agents to improve water dispersibility/solubility. The mixture is then ground to a fine powder. Similar compositions may also be granulated to foR"" water soluble granules (SG).<br>
Wettable powders (WP) may be prepared by mixing a compound of foR""ula (1) with one or more solid diluents or carriers, one or more wetting agents and, preferably, one or more dispersing agents and, optionally, one or more suspending agents to facilitate the dispersion in liquids. The mixture is then ground to a fine powder. Similar compositions may also be granulated to foR"" water dispersible granules (WG).<br>
Granules (GR) may be foR""ed either by granulating a mixture of a compound of foR""ula (1) and one or more powdered solid diluents or carriers, or from pre-foR""ed blank granules by absorbing a compound of foR""ula (1) (or a solution thereof, in a suitable agent) in a porous granular material (such as pumice, attapulgite clays, fuller's earth, kieselguhr, diatomaceous earths or ground corn cobs) or by adsorbing a compound of foR""ula (1) (or a solution thereof, in a suitable agent) on to a hard core material (such as sands, silicates, mineral carbonates, sulphates or phosphates) and drying if necessary. Agents which are<br><br>
commonly used to aid absorption or adsorption include solvents (such as aliphatic and aromatic petroleum solvents, alcohols, ethers, ketones and esters) and sticking agents (such as polyvinyl acetates, polyvinyl alcohols, dextrins, sugars and vegetable oils). One or more other additNes may also be included in granules (for example an emulsifying agent, wetting agent or dispersing agent).<br>
Dispersible Concentrates (DC) may be prepared by dissolving a compound of foR""ula (1) in water or an organic solvent, such as a ketone, alcohol or glycol ether. These solutions may contain a surface actNe agent (for example to improve water dilution or prevent crystallisation in a spray tank).<br>
Emulsifiable concentrates (EC) or oil-in-water emulsions (EW) may be prepared by dissolving a compound of foR""ula (1) in an organic solvent (optionally containing one or more wetting agents, one or more emulsifying agents or a mixture of said agents). Suitable organic solvents for use in ECs include aromatic hydrocarbons (such as alkylbenzenes or  alkylnaphthalenes, exemplified by SOLVESSO 100, SOLVESSO 150 and SOLVESSO 200; SOLVESSO is a Registered Trade Mark), ketones (such as cyclohexanone or methylcyclo-hexanone); alcohols (such as benzyl alcohol, furfuryl alcohol or butanol), Af-alkylpyr-rolidones (such as Af-rnethylpyrrolidone or TV-octylpyrrolidone), dimethyl amides of fatty acids (such as Cg-Cio fatty acid diethylamide) and chlorinated hydrocarbons. An EC product may spontaneously emulsify on addition to water, to produce an emulsion with sufficient stability to allow spray application through appropriate equipment. Preparation of an EW involves obtaining a compound of foR""ula (1) either as a liquid (if it is not a liquid at room temperature, it may be melted at a reasonable temperature, typically below 70Â°C) or in solution (by dissolving it in an appropriate solvent) and then emulsifying the resultant liquid or solution into water containing one or more SFAs, under high shear, to produce an emulsion. Suitable solvents for use in EWs include vegetable oils, chlorinated hydrocarbons (such as chlorobenzenes), aromatic solvents (such as alkylbenzenes or alkylnaphthalenes) and other appropriate organic solvents that have a low solubility in water.<br>
Microemulsions (ME) may be prepared by mixing water with a blend of one or more solvents with one or more SFAs, to produce spontaneously a theR""odynamically stable isotropic liquid foR""ulation. A compound of foR""ula (1) is present initially in either the<br><br>
system (which system is present may be deteR""ined by conductNity measurements) and may be suitable for mixing water-soluble and oil-soluble pesticides in the same foR""ulation. An ME is suitable for dilution into water, either remaining as a microemulsion or foR""ing a conventional oil-in-water emulsion.<br>
Suspension concentrates (SC) may comprise aqueous or non-aqueous suspensions of finely dNided insoluble solid particles of a compound of foR""ula (1). SCs may be prepared by ball or bead milling the solid compound of foR""ula (1) in a suitable medium, optionally with one or more dispersing agents, to produce a fine particle suspension of the compound. One or more wetting agents may be included in the composition and a suspending agent may be included to reduce the rate at which the particles settle. AlternatNely, a compound of foR""ula (1) may be dry milled and added to water, containing agents hereinbefore described, to produce the desired end product.<br>
Aerosol foR""ulations comprise a compound of foR""ula (1) and a suitable propellant (for example /7-butane). A compound of foR""ula (1) may also be dissolved or dispersed in a suitable medium (for example water or a water miscible liquid, such as /7-propanol) to provide compositions for use in non-pressurised, hand-actuated spray pumps.<br>
A compound of foR""ula (1) may be mixed in" the dry state with a pyrotechnic mixture to foR"" a composition suitable for generating, in an enclosed space, a smoke containing the compound.<br>
Capsule suspensions (CS) may be prepared in a manner similar to the preparation of EW foR""ulations but with an additional polymerisation stage such that an aqueous dispersion of oil droplets is obtained, in which each oil droplet is encapsulated by a polymeric shell and contains a compound of foR""ula (1) and, optionally, a carrier or diluent therefor. The polymeric shell may be produced by either an interfacial polycondensation reaction or by a coacervation procedure. The compositions may provide for controlled release of the compound of foR""ula (1) and they may be used for seed treatment. A compound of foR""ula (1) may also be foR""ulated in a biodegradable polymeric matrix to provide a slow, controlled release of the compound.<br>
A composition may include one or more additNes to improve the biological perfoR""ance of the composition (for example by improving wetting, retention or distribution on surfaces; resistance to rain on treated surfaces; or uptake or mobility of a compound of foR""ula (1)). Such additNes include surface actNeagents, spray adliifNes based on oils, for<br><br>

A compound of foR""ula (1) may be applied by any of the known means of applying fungicidal compounds. For example, it maybe applied, foR""ulated or unfoR""ulated, to any part of the plant, including the foliage, stems, branches or roots, to the seed before it is Â§ planted or to other media in which plants are growing or are to be planted (such as soil surrounding the roots, the soil generally, paddy water or hydroponic culture systems), difectly or it may be sprayed on, dusted on, applied by dipping, applied as a cream or paste foR""ulation, applied as a vapour or applied through distribution or incorporation of a composition (such as a granular composition or a composition packed in a water-soluble bag) in soil or an aqueous environment,<br>
A compound of foR""ula (1) may also be injected into plants or sprayed onto vegetation using electrodynamic spraying techniques or other low volume methods, or applied by land or aerial irrigation systems.<br>
Compositions for use as aqueous preparations (aqueous solutions or dispersions) are generally supplied in the foR"" of a concentrate containing a high proportion of the actNe ingredient, the concentrate being added to water before use. These concentrates, which may include DCs, SCs, ECs, EWs, MEs SGs, SPs, WPs, WGs and CSs, are often required to withstand storage for prolonged periods and, after such storage, to be capable of addition to water to foR"" aqueous preparations which remain homogeneous for a sufficient time to enable them to be applied by conventional spray equipment. Such aqueous preparations may contain varying amounts of a compound of foR""ula (1) (for example 0.0001 to 10%, by weight) depending upon the purpose for which they are to be used.<br>
A compound of foR""ula (1) may be used in mixtures with fertilisers (for example nitrogen-, potassium- or phosphorus-containing fertilisers). Suitable foR""ulation types include granules of fertiliser. The mixtures suitably contain up to 25% by weight of the Compound of foR""ula (1).<br><br>
The invention therefore also provides a fertiliser composition comprising a fertiliser and a compound of foR""ula (1).<br>
The compositions of this invention may contain other compounds having biological actNity, for example micronutrients or compounds having similar or complementary fungicidal actNity or which possess plant growth regulating, herbicidal, insecticidal, nematicidal or acaricidal actNity.<br>
By including another fungicide, the resulting composition may have a broader spectrum of actNity or a greater level of intrinsic actNity than the compound of foR""ula (1) alone. Further the other fungicide may have a synergistic effect on the fungicidal actNity of the compound of foR""ula (1).<br>
The compound of foR""ula (1) may be the sole actNe ingredient of the composition or it may be admixed with one or more additional actNe ingredients such as a pesticide, fungicide, synergist, herbicide or plant growth regulator, where appropriate. An additional actNe ingredient may: provide a composition having a broader spectrum of actNity or increased persistence at a locus; synergise the actNity or complement the actNity (for example by increasing the speed of effect or overcoming repellency) of the compound of foR""ula (1); or help to overcome or prevent the development of resistance to indNidual components. The particular additional actNe ingredient will depend upon the intended utility of the composition.<br>

The compounds of foR""ula (1) may be mixed with soil, peat or other rooting media for the protection of plants against seed-borne, soil-borne or foliar fungal diseases.<br>
Some mixtures may comprise active ingredients, which have significantly different physical, chemical or biological properties such that they do not easily lend themselves to the same conventional foR""ulation type. In these circumstances other foR""ulation types may be prepared. For example, where one active ingredient is a water insoluble solid and the other a water insoluble liquid, it may nevertheless be possible to disperse each active ingredient in the same continuous aqueous phase by dispersing the solid active ingredient as a suspension (using a preparation analogous to that of an SC) but dispersing the liquid active ingredient as an emulsion (using a preparation analogous to that of an EW). The resultant composition is a suspoemulsion (SE) foR""ulation.<br><br><br><br>
Step I<br>
4,6-Dichloropyrimidin-5-ylamine (20.Og) was stirred while hydrazine hydrate (200ml) was added to the solid rapidly over 2 minutes. The texture of the solid changed and ;      the mobile phase looked greenish, and the temperature rose to 35Â°C. The reaction was then cooled, the thick solid was collected and washed with isopropyl alcohol, and was dried to (4,6-dichloro-pyrimidin-5-yl)-hydrazine as a white fluffy solid (16.4g).<br>
*H NMR (d6-DMSO) 5 ppm: 4.4-4.6 (bs, 3H), 7.75 (s, 1H)," 8.15 (bs, 2H) Step 2<br>
The product from Step 1 (10.6g) was suspended in trimethylorthofoR""ate (150ml), followed by the addition of concentrated hydrochloric acid (2ml). The colour changed to orange and the reaction was brought to reflux for 6 hours with stirring. The bright yellow reaction mixture was cooled and the solid collected, washed with diethyl ether and dried overnight to give 5-chloro-l,2-dihydropyrimido[5,4-e][l,2,4]triazine as a yellow solid (5.5g). JH NMR (d6-DMSO) 5 ppm: 6,2 (fd, 1H), 7.4 (s,lH), 8.0 (bs,lH), 9.1(bs,lH) Step 3<br>
The product from Step 2 (5.5g) was suspended in ethanol (350ml) and a solution of bromine (3.1ml) in ethanol (50ml) was added slowly over a period of 10 minutes. The suspension dissolved to give a dark straw colour. After 15 minutes of stirring, water (5ml) was added and stirring was continued for 3 hours. The reaction mixture was then allowed to stand for 18 hours. The liquid was decanted from the solid, which was washed with diethyl ether, collected and discarded. The combined washings were evaporated to give Nbrown sludge, which was dissolved in water (5ml) and neutralised with aqueous sodium bicarbonate and then extracted with DC1-4 (2 x 200ml) to give a yellow solution. This solution was dried over magnesium sulphate and evaporated to give 6-amino-[l,2,4]triazine-5-carboxylic acid ethyl ester as a straw solid (3.6g). 1HNMR (CDC13) 5 ppm: 1.5 (t,3H), 4.5 (q,2H), 6.4-6.7 (bs,2H), 9.3 (s,lH).<br><br>

To this was added (2,4,6-trifluoro-phenyl)-acetyl chloride (1.7g) in toluene (20ml), giving a thick precipitate. The stirred suspension was heated for 5 hours at reflux, and the reaction was then cooled and the solid collected and washed with diethyl ether to yield an off white solid. The pale red filtrate was evaporated to give a viscous liquid, which was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (40-60) eluting with diethyl ether to give 6-[2-(2,4,6-trifluorophenyI)-acetylamino]-[l,2,4]triazine-5-carboxylic acid ethyl ester as a viscous oil which solidified (l.Og). Step 5<br>
The product of Step 4 (l.Og) was dissolved in DMF (20ml) and potassium carbonate (0.5g) was added and the reaction brought to 130Â°C for 2 hours. The reaction was cooled and the solvent evaporated to give a solid, which was triturated with diethyl ether. The solid was dissolved in water (10ml) and acidified with 2M aqueous hydrochloric acid, which precipitated a dark brown solid (0.30g)."The aqueous fraction was acidified again with 2M aqueous hydrochloric acid and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layers were evaporated to give a brown solid, which was triturated with diethyl ether and collected to give pure 6-(2,4,6-trifluorophenyl)-8H-pyrido[3)2-e][l,234]triazine-5)7-dione as a pale brown solid (0.160g).<br>
