				<td>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
The subject matter of the present application is related to U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 11/264,900 filed on November 2, 2005 and entitled "Multimodal Polyethylene Compositions and Pipe Made From Same," and Serial No. 11/359,972 filed February 22, 2006 and entitled "Polymerization Catalysts for Producing High Molecular Weight Polymers with Low Levels of Long Chain Branching," each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present disclosure relates to polymer compositions and pipe made from same, more specifically to polyethylene compositions for the manufacture of high-pressure rated pipe.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Polymeric pipes have replaced metal pipes in many applications such as for high-pressure fluid and natural gas transportation. Polymeric pipes have several advantages over metal pipes including being of relatively lighter weight, more corrosion resistant, inexpensive, more thermally and electrically insulative, tougher, more durable and more easily shaped during manufacture. Such pipes are exposed to numerous stresses during their lifetime that may result in cracks or breaks that are expensive to repair, especially in situations where the pipe is buried in a structure or underground. As such, polymeric pipes may be required to meet industry-defined standards depending on their intended use. Polymeric material used in the fabrication of pipe has often been optimized to provide a more durable end-use article for example; higher density polyethylene resins have been developed for pipe applications.<br>
High-density polyethylene (HDPE) is widely used in the fabrication of pipes for the high-pressure transport of resources such as natural gas because of its ease of processing and its<br>
excellent balance between stiffness and fracture toughness. The polymer resin density (and consequently the density of the resultant pipe) is directly correlated to the load-bearing capacity (or design stress) of the pipe where the higher the polymer resin density the higher the load-bearing capacity of the resultant pipe as described in the article by Rajendra K. Krishnaswamy entitiled "Analysis of ductile and brittle failures from creep rupture testing of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes" published in 2005 in Polymer; Volume 46; Issue 25; pages 11664-11 672 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. However, pipes for high-pressure gas transport applications must also have adequate resistance to slow crack growth (SCG) as this is the most common mode of failure for pipes in service. Generally speaking, increasing the density of the polymer resin decreases the SCG resistance of the resin and the resultant pipe. Therefore, a need exists for HDPE resins intended for high-pressure-pipe applications to have a good balance between density and SCG resistance.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Disclosed herein is a polymer composition comprising a density equal to or greater than about 0.947 g/cc, a high load melt index from about 1 g/lOmin to about 30 g/lOmin, and a tensile natural draw ratio less than about 14167p-12958, where p is the density(g/cc) of the composition.<br>
Also disclosed herein is a polymer composition comprising a tensile natural draw ratio less than about 14167ρ-12958, where p is the density (g/cc) of the composition and wherein less than about 1 weight percent of the composition comprises non-polymeric additives.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Disclosed herein are polyethylene (PE) compositions, PE pipes, and methods of making same. Such methods may comprise preparing a PE composition and forming the composition into a pipe. The PE composition may comprise a PE base resin and optionally additives or modifiers. In an aspect, the PE composition comprises a bimodal PE resin and the pipe prepared therefrom may display enhanced physical properties such as increased resistance to SCG.<br>
The PE base resin may be a unimodal resin, alternatively a multimodal resin. Herein, the "modality" of a polymer resin refers to the form of its molecular weight distribution curve, i.e. the appearance of a graph of the polymer weight fraction, frequency, or number as a function of its molecular weight. The polymer weight fraction refers to the weight fraction of molecules of a given size. A polymer having a molecular weight distribution curve showing a single peak may be referred to as a unimodal polymer, a polymer having a curve showing two distinct peaks may be referred to as a bimodal polymer, a polymer having a curve showing three distinct peaks may be referred to as a trimodal polymer, etc. Polymers having molecular weight distribution curves showing more than one peak may be collectively referred to as multimodal polymers or resins.<br>
A polymer resin may have two or more components that may be distinguishable from one another, for example based upon their individual composition and/or molecular weight distribution. A molecular weight distribution curve may be prepared for each individual component of the polymer resin. For example, the molecular weight distribution curve for the<br>
individual components of the polymer resin may display a single peak and thus be unimodal. The molecular weight distribution curves for the individual components may be superimposed onto a common chart to form the weight distribution curve for the polymer resin as a whole Upon such superimposition, the resultant curve for the polymer resin as a whole may be multimodal or show n distinct peaks corresponding to « polymer components of differing molecular weight distributions. For example, a bimodal polymer resin may show two distinct peaks corresponding to two individual components of differing molecular weights. Said bimodal polymer resin may have a first component that may be generally characterized as a higher molecular weight polymer component and a second component that may be generally characterized as a lower molecular weight polymer component. Alternatively, superimposition of the molecular weight distribution curves from the individual components may show a single peak that is broadened in comparison with the curves for the individual components corresponding to polymer fractions having different but overlapping molecular weight distributions. In an embodiment, the multimodal PE composition comprises a bimodal PE base resin. The remainder of the discussion will focus on a bimodal PE compositions with the understanding that other polymeric compositions, for example having different modality, may be employed in various aspects and embodiments as would be apparent to one skilled in the art. The PE composition and/or individual components of the PE composition may comprise a homopolymer, a copolymer, or blends thereof. In an embodiment, the components of the PE composition may be a copolymer comprised of a polymer of ethylene with one or more comonomcrs such as alpha olefins. In an embodiment, the PE composition comprises a higher molecular weight ethylene/1-olefin copolymer (HMW) component and a lower molecular weight ethylene/1-olefin copolymer (LMW) component. The comonomer of the HMW component of the PE composition may be the same as or different from the comonomer of the LMW component.    Examples of suitable comonomers include without limitation<br>
unsaturated hydrocarbons having from 3 to 20 carbon atoms such as propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 3-methyl-1-butene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, 1-heptene, 1-octene, 1-nonene, 1-decene, and mixtures thereof. In an embodiment, the comonomer for the LMW component and HMW component of the PE composition is 1-hexene.<br>
Such PE compositions may be prepared by any means known to one skilled in art, for example by employing a multi-catalyst system in at least one reactor, series reactors, parallel reactors, blending in at least one reactor, physical blending, or any other physical means, or by varying the comonomers in the polymerization reaction, as will be described in more detail herein. Such PE compositions may have a variety of properties and parameters described below either singularly or in combination. Methods for determination of these properties and parameters are known to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The molecular weight distribution (MWD) of the PE composition may be characterized by the ratio of the weight average molecular weight to the number average molecular weight, which is also referred to as the polydispersity index (PDI) or more simply as polydispersity. The number average molecular weight (Mn) is the common average of the molecular weights of the individual polymers calculated by measuring the molecular weight of « polymer molecules, summing the weights, and dividing by n. The weight average molecular weight (Mw) of a polymer composition is calculated according to equation 1:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
where n1 is the number of molecules of molecular weight M1 All molecular weight averages are expressed in gram per mole (g/mol). Various moments of the MWD include Mn, Mw, Mz, and Mv.<br>
In an embodiment, the HMW component may have a PDI of equal to or less than about 5.5, alternatively equal to or less than about 5.0, alternatively equal to or less than about 4.5, or alternatively, equal to or less than about 4.0. In an embodiment, the LMW component may have a PDI of equal to or less than about 10, alternatively equal to or less than about 8. alternatively equal to or less than about 7, or alternatively, equal to or less than about 6. The resultant PE composition (i.e. including both the LMW and HMW components) may have a broad MWD of equal to or greater than about 8, alternatively equal to or greater than about 10, or alternatively equal to or greater than about 12.<br>
The high load melt index (HLMI) represents the rate of flow of a molten resin through an orifice of 0.0825 inch diameter when subjected to a force of 21,600 grams at 190 °C as determined in accordance with ASTM D 1238. The PE compositions of this disclosure may have a HLMI of from about 1 g/10min to about 30 g/10min, alternatively from about 2 g/10min to about 25 g/10min, or alternatively from about 2 g/10min to about 20 g/10min.<br>
The PE compositions of this disclosure may be further characterized by having a density of from about 0.947 g/cc to about 0.955 g/cc, alternatively equal to or greater than about 0.947 g/cc. The density refers to the mass per unit volume of polymer and may be determined in accordance with ASTM D 1505.<br>
The PE composition of the present invention can be polymerized by any olefin polymerization method known in the art, using various types of polymerization reactors. As used herein, "polymerization reactor" includes any polymerization reactor capable of polymerizing olefin monomers to produce homopolymcrs or copolymers. Such homopolymcrs and copolymers are referred to as resins, polymers, polyolefins, or PE, These could include slurry, gas-phase, solution, high pressure, tubular or autoclave reactors. Gas phase reactors may comprise fluidized bed reactors or staged horizontal reactors. Slurry reactors may comprise vertical or horizontal loops.   High-pressure reactors may comprise autoclave or<br><br>
tubular reactors. Reactor types can include those that may be referred to as continuous or batch. Continuous processes could use intermittent or continuous product discharge. Processes may also include partial or full direct recycle of un-reacted monomer, un-reacted comonomer, and/or diluent.<br>
Polymerization reactor systems of the present invention may comprise one type of reactor in a system or multiple reactors of the same or different type. Production of polymers in multiple reactors may include several stages in at least two separate polymerization reactors interconnected by a transfer device making it possible to transfer the polymers resulting from the first polymerization reactor into the second reactor. The desired polymerization conditions in one of the reactors may be different from the operating conditions of the other reactors. Alternatively, polymerization in multiple reactors may include the manual transfer of polymer from one reactor to subsequent reactors for continued polymerization. Multiple reactor systems may include any combination including, but not limited to, multiple loop reactors, multiple gas reactors, a combination of loop and gas reactors, multiple high-pressure reactors or a combination of high pressure with loop and/or gas reactors. The multiple reactors may be operated in scries or in parallel.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, the polymerization reactor system may comprise at least one loop slurry reactor. Such reactors are known in the art and may comprise vertical or horizontal loops. Monomer, diluent, catalyst and optionally any comonomer may be continuously fed to a loop reactor where polymerization occurs. Generally, continuous processes may comprise the continuous introduction of a monomer, a catalyst, and a diluent into a polymerization reactor and the continuous removal from this reactor of a suspension comprising polymer particles and the diluent. Reactor effluent may be flashed to separate the solid polymer from the liquids that comprise the diluent, monomer and/or comonomer. Various technologies may be used for this separation step including but not limited to, flashing<br>
that may include any combination of heat addition and pressure reduction; separation by cyclonic action in either a cyclone or hydrocyclone; or separation by centrifugal force.<br>
A typical slurry polymerization process (also known as the particle form process), which is well known in the art is disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,248,179, 4,501,885, 5,565,175, 5,575,979, 6,239,235, 6,262,191 and 6,833,415, each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.<br>
Suitable diluents used in slurry polymerization are well known in the art and include, but are not limited to, the monomer being polymerized and hydrocarbons that are liquids under reaction conditions. Examples of suitable diluents include, but are not limited to, hydrocarbons such as propane, cyclohexane, isobutane, n-butane, n-pentane, isopentane, neopentane, and n-hexane. Some loop polymerization reactions can occur under bulk conditions where no diluent is used. An example is polymerization of propylene monomer as disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,455,314, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.<br>
According to yet another aspect of this invention, the polymerization reactor may comprise at least one gas phase reactor. Such systems arc known in the art and may employ a continuous recycle stream containing one or more monomers continuously cycled through a fluidized bed in the presence of the catalyst under polymerization conditions. A recycle stream may be withdrawn from the fluidized bed and recycled back into the reactor. Simultaneously, polymer product may be withdrawn from the reactor and new or fresh monomer may be added to replace the polymerized monomer. Such gas phase reactors may comprise a process for multi-step gas-phase polymerization of olefins, in which olefins are polymerized in the gaseous phase in at least two independent gas-phase polymerization zones while feeding a catalyst-containing polymer formed in a first polymerization zone to a second polymerization zone.<br>
One type of gas phase reactor is disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,352,749, 4588,790 and 5,436,304, each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.<br>
According to still another aspect of the invention, a high-pressure polymerization reactor may comprise a tubular reactor or an autoclave reactor, both of which are known in the art. Tubular reactors may have several zones where fresh monomer, initiators, or catalysts are added. Monomer may be entrained in an inert gaseous stream and introduced at one zone of the reactor. Initiators, catalysts, and/or catalyst components may be entrained in a gaseous stream and introduced at another zone of the reactor. The gas streams may be intermixed for polymerization. Heat and pressure may be employed appropriately to obtain optimal polymerization reaction conditions.<br>
According to yet another aspect of the invention, the polymerization reactor may comprise a solution polymerization reactor wherein the monomer is contacted with the catalyst composition by suitable stirring or other means. A carrier comprising an inert organic diluent or excess monomer may be employed. If desired, the monomer may be brought in the vapor phase into contact with the catalytic reaction product, in the presence or absence of liquid material. The polymerization zone is maintained at temperatures and pressures that will result in the formation of a solution of the polymer in a reaction medium. Agitation may be employed to obtain better temperature control and to maintain uniform polymerization mixtures throughout the polymerization zone. Adequate means are utilized for dissipating the exothermic heat of polymerization. These reactors are known in the art.<br>
Polymerization reactors suitable for the present invention may further comprise any combination of at least one raw material feed system, at least one feed system for catalyst or catalyst components, and/or at least one polymer recovery system. Suitable reactor systems for the present invention may further comprise systems for feedstock purification, catalyst storage<br>
and preparation, extrusion, reactor cooling, polymer recovery, fractionation, recycle, storage, loadout, laboratory analysis, and process control.<br>
Conditions that are controlled for polymerization efficiency and to provide resin properties include temperature, pressure and the concentrations of various reactants Polymerization temperature can affect catalyst productivity, polymer molecular weight and molecular weight distribution. Suitable polymerization temperature may be any temperature below the de-polymerization temperature according to the Gibbs Free energy equation. Typically this includes from about 60 °C to about 280 °C, for example, and from about 70 °C to about 110 °C, depending upon the type of polymerization reactor.<br>
Suitable pressures will also vary according to the reactor and polymerization type. The pressure for liquid phase polymerizations in a loop reactor is typically less than 1000 psig. Pressure for gas phase polymerization is usually at about 200 - 500 psig. High pressure polymerization in tubular or autoclave reactors is generally run at about 20,000 to 75,000 psig. Polymerization reactors can also be operated in a supercritical region occurring at generally higher temperatures and pressures. Operation above the critical point of a pressure/temperature diagram (supercritical phase) may offer advantages.<br>
The concentration of various reactants can be controlled to produce resins with certain physical and mechanical properties. The proposed end-use product that will be formed by the resin and the method of forming that product determines the properties. Mechanical properties include tensile, flcxural, impact, creep, fracture (impact and slow crack growth) resistance, stress relaxation and hardness tests. Physical properties include density, molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, melting temperature, glass transition temperature, crystallization temperature, stereoregularity, long chain branching and melt rheology.<br>
The concentrations of monomer, co-monomer, hydrogen, co-catalyst, modifiers, ind electron donors arc important in producing these resin properties.  Comonomcr is used to<br>
control product density. Hydrogen can be used to control product molecular weight. Co-catalysts can be used to alkylate, scavenge poisons and control molecular weight. Modifiers can be used to control product properties and electron donors affect stereoregularity. In addition, the concentration of poisons is minimized because poisons impact the reactions and product properties.<br>
Any catalyst composition capable of producing a PE composition may be employed in the production of the PE composition. Typical catalyst compositions that can be employed include supported chromium catalysts, Ziegler-Natta catalysts, metallocene catalysts, or combinations thereof. For example, a catalyst composition for the production of a PE composition may include at least two metallocenes that are selected such that the polymers produced therefrom have two distinctly different molecular weights. The first metallocene may be used to produce the HMW component, and may be a tightly bridged metallocene containing a substituent that includes a terminal olefin. The second metallocene, that may be used to produce the LMW component, is generally not bridged and is more responsive to chain termination reagents, such as hydrogen, than the first metallocene. The metallocenes may be combined with an activator, an aluminum alkyl compound, an olefin monomer, and an olefin comonomer to produce the desired bimodal polyolefin. The activity and the productivity of the catalyst may be relatively high. As used herein, the activity refers to the grams of polymer produced per gram of solid catalyst charged per hour, and the productivity refers to the grams of polymer produced per gram of solid catalyst charged. Such catalysts are disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 11/209,006, filed August 22, 2005 and entitled "Polymerization Catalysts And Process For Producing Bimodal Polymers In A Single Reactor," and U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 11/208,077, filed September 15, 2005 and entitled "Polymerization Catalysts and Process for Producing Bimodal Polymers in a Single Reactor," each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>

Pipe extrusion in the simplest terms is performed by conveying solid polymer pellets through the action of a rotating screw followed by the compaction and melting of the pellets through the application of heat and shear forces; the homogenous polymer melt is then conveyed to the die to form the ultimately desired profile. For the fabrication of pipes the cxtrudate (melt exiting the die), which is annular in shape, is then formed and cooled through a series of vacuum and water cooling tanks. There are numerous kinds of feedstocks in pipe extrusion. The polymer feedstock can either be a pre-pigmented polyethylene resin or it can be a mixture of natural polyethylene and color concentrate (referred to as "Salt and Pepper blends"). In North America, the most common feedstock for pipe extrusion is "Salt and Pepper blends". In Europe and other areas of the world, me most common feedstock for pipe extrusion is pre-pigmented polyethylene resin. Feedstock is rigidly controlled to obtain the proper finished product (pipe) and ultimate coasumer specifications. In one "salt and pepper blend" embodiment, the color concentrate is a polyethylene carrier resin loaded with up to 40 weight percent carbon black particles; this concentrate is introduced to maintain approximately 2.5 weight percent carbon black concentration in the final pipe.<br>
The feedstock is then fed into an extruder. The most common extruder system for pipe production is a single-screw extruder. The purpose of the extruder is to melt, homogenize and convey the polyethylene pellets. Extrusion temperatures typically range from 170 °C to 260 °C depending upon the extruder screw design and flow properties of the polyethylene.<br>
The molten polymer is then passed through an annular die to shape the melt. The molten polymer, in the form of an annulus, is then usually forced through a shaping or forming tank while simultaneously being cooled from the outside using a water spray. While the pipe<br>
diameter is a direct consequence of the die and sizing sleeve dimensions, the pipe wall thickness depends on the die gap and also the draw-down speed employed.<br>
Next, the pipe is cooled and solidified in the desired dimensions. Cooling is accomplished by the use of several water tanks where the outside pipe is either submerged in water or water is sprayed on the pipe exterior. The pipe is cooled from the outside surface to the inside surface. The interior wall and inside surfaces of the pipe can stay hot for a long period of time, as polyethylene is a poor conductor of heat. Finally, the pipe is printed and either coiled or cut to length.<br>
In an embodiment, the polymeric pipe fabricated from PE compositions of this disclosure display enhanced mechanical properties such as resistance to slow crack growth, decreased tensile natural draw ratio (NDR), resistance to rapid crack propagation and strength sufficient to warrant the designation PE100. The designation PE100 refers to a pressure rating wherein the pipe has a minimum required strength value (50 year extrapolated value at 20 °C; 97.5 lower prediction limit) equal to or greater than 10.0 MPa. Such pipes may display the properties described below either smgularly or in combination. The specific methods for determination of these properties arc described in more detail herein.<br>
When a pressurized PE pipe is subjected to an instantaneous and intense impact, a pre-existing or consequently initiated crack or flaw can propagate axially at speeds in excess of 100 m/s. Such an event is referred to as Rapid Crack Propagation or RCP. The Small-Scale Steady-State (S4) test is a current standard for measuring RCP resistance. In the S4 test, the pipe specimens arc seven diameters long and arc scaled at both ends and pressurized with air. Typically, pipe specimens are conditioned externally at the test temperature, and then moved to the S4 rig for testing. A sharp chisel-edged striker impacts the pipe at one end and drives a fast-running crack through the main section of the pipe. While the crack propagates, internal disc baffles spaced along the pipe length suppress axial decompression ahead of it, so that the<br>
pressure at the crack-tip is approximately equal to the test pressure during the entire course of crack growth. This promotes steady-state crack growth. Further, in the S4 test, a containment cage around the specimen prevents flaring of the pipe. This also limits the failure mode to steady-state crack propagation while minimizing ductile transient bursting. The S4 test details and procedures are described in the ISO 13477 standard. The test can be performed at a fixed temperature to determine the critical pressure (Pc) required to sustain RCP. Alternatively, a series of tests at a given/fixed operating pressure (usually 5 bars) and at various temperatures can be used to measure the critical temperature (Tc) for RCP to be sustained. Generally speaking, the temperature of a pipe must be below a critical limit even for RCP to be initiated. Once RCP is initiated, the pressure within the pipe must exceed a critical value to sustain steady state crack propagation. Therefore, for a pipe, low S4 Tc and high S4 Pc will help minimize RCP failures.<br>
The lower the S4 critical temperature the better, since it results in a broader end-use temperature range for the pipe. A pipe fabricated from the PE compositions disclosed herein, having an 2-inch nominal outer diameter with a standard diameter ratio (SDR = OD/t, where t = wall thickness) of about 11, may have a critical temperature value determined according to ISO DIS 13477 (S4 test) of equal to or less than about -10 °C, alternatively equal to or less than about -13 °C, alternatively equal to or less than about -16 °C.<br>
A modified Charpy impact test, referred to as the Razor-Notched Charpy Impact Test, has emerged as a useful indicator of the resistance to RCP fractures. This modified Charpy test is described in detail in ASTM F 2231. This test involves measuring the impact energy when a thin molded rectangular plaque (with a razor notch) is impacted by a swinging pendulum. This test can be performed at multiple temperatures; enabling one to determine the temperature at which the failure mode changes from ductile to brittle. The results from this test arc as follows: (i) impact energy (in Joules) at room temperature and (ii) the lowest temperature<br>
at which the failure was clearly ductile (hinge break with an impact energy &gt; 0.15 J); for convenience, this temperature will be referred to as the Charpy Tat,. Generally speaking, a higher room-temperature impact energy and a lower Charpy Tdb means the ensuing pipe will have better RCP resistance.<br>
The PE compositions disclosed herein may have a Charpy Tdb less than about -15 °C and a room-temp impact energy greater than about 0.7 J; alternatively, the Charpy Tdb may be less than about -20 °C and the room-temp impact energy greater than about 0.8 J; or alternatively, the Charpy Tdb may be less than about -25 °C and the room-temp impact energy greater than about 0.85   J.<br>
HDPE pipes used for gas transport are under pressure for the duration of their useful service. Often, fluctuations in pressure render the load to be dynamic. Therefore, it is important to establish the maximum load that such a pipe can withstand without deformation and damage over the expected lifetime (typically, many decades). The design stress and the useful service lifetime of HDPE pipes are typically estimated by performing creep rupture tests at multiple temperatures. In this test (ASTM D 1598), the pipe of interest is subjected to a certain hydrostatic pressure (expressed as hoop stress) and the failure time is recorded; failure is defined as a continuous loss of pressure (leakage) from within the pipe. Typically, a log-log plot of pipe hoop stress versus failure time is constructed and extrapolated to a desired lifetime. The corresponding hoop stress at the desired lifetime and temperature from the above-mentioned plot is used as the design stress (after the application of an appropriate safety factor) for the application of interest.<br>
In order to predict the design stress and durability of such pressure pipes, accelerated testing is conducted at elevated temperatures. In other words, for a given pipe and hoop stress level, failure occurs at shorter times with increasing temperature. The general procedure to estimate the design stress and durability of HDPE pipes requires creep rupture<br>
failure data spread uniformly over a two-year timeframe at the end-use temperature (usually room temperature) and at two or three higher temperatures (typically in the 40-80 °C range). Subsequently, principles of time-temperature superposition are applied to the data; this allows one to reasonably extrapolate the failure data at room temperature to a few decades.<br>
The design stress of a plastic pipe is often referred to as its long-term hydrostatic strength (LTHS) or the minimum required strength (MRS). LTHS, estimated using ASTM D 2837 (USA standard), is the estimated tensile stress in the wall of a pipe in the circumferential orientation which, when applied continuously, will cause failure of the pipe at 100,000 hours. The MRS of a pipe, estimated using the ISO 9080 standard, is the functional equivalent of the LTHS (with a desired lifetime of 50 years) used internationally. The LTHS and/or MRS of a pipe are used to certify gas pipes according to either ASTM D 2513 and/or ISO 4437. In other words, these values determine the maximum load that such pipes can bear during their utilization for the transportation of natural gas.<br>
An MRS value (50 year extrapolated value at 20 °C; 97,5 lower predictive limit (LPL)) greater than 10.0 MPa corresponds to PE100 pressure rating. A PESO pressure rating means the MRS was greater than 8.0 MPa and less than 10.0 MPa. Based on limited creep rupture testing at 23 °C, 60 °C and 80 °C, the MRS of a pipe (2 inch nominal OD with a SDR of about 11.0) from PE compositions disclosed herein is projected to be greater than 10.0 MPa.<br>
A majority of the field failures in pressure pipe applications are attributable to slow crack growth (SCG). This has led to the development of many lab-scale tests, such as the Pennsylvania Edge-Notch Tensile Test (PENT; ASTM F1473), to predict the resistance to SCG of various polyethylenes. In the PENT test, a notched polyethylene specimen is subjected to creep by the application of a constant tensile load at 80 °C. The applied load is such that the initial stress is 2.4 MPa. The time to failure is recorded and reported. A longer failure time correlates with a greater resistance to SCG.  Generally speaking, increasing the resin density<br>
lowers the PENT failure times. The PE compositions of this disclosure display PENT failure times in excess of 3000 hours, alternatively in excess of 4000 hours, alternatively in excess of 5000 hours, alternatively in excess of 6000 hours, alternatively in excess of 7000 hours.<br>
The PENT test time may be shortened by simply increasing the initial load applied in order to accelerate the fracture process. A "high-stress" PENT is defined as the failure time for an initial applied load of 3.8 MPa (increased from the 2.4 MPa prescribed in ASTM F1473) and unchanged specimen geometry. The PE compositions of this disclosure display high-stress PENT failure times in excess of 7000 hours. Given that the density of the PE compositions of this disclosure are high (&gt; 0.952 g/cc), this is considered to be a significant result. For reference, all commercially available PE100 rated polymers, at a density less than 0.951 g/cc, display high-stress PENT failure times considerably less than 3000 hours.<br>
Since the majority of field failures in pressure pipe (gas transport) applications are attributable to a brittle fracture mode referred to as SCG, the resistance to SCG of pressure pipe is often evaluated. One method of evaluating the SCG resistance is by determining the tensile natural draw ratio (tensile NDR) of the resin. There is some evidence that the tensile NDR is directly related to the SCG resistance of HDPE such that the lower the tensile NDR the higher the resistance to SCG. A description of the correlation of SCG to tensile NDR may be found in: E. Laurent, Comprehensive Evaluation of the Long-Term Mechanical Properties of PE100 Resin Meeting the Requirements of Modern Installation Techniques, Plastic Pipes XI Proceedings of the International Conference, Woodhead Publishing Limited (2001); and in an article by L. Hubert, ct al published in 2002 in the Journal of Applied Polymer Science Volume 84 page 2308 each of which is incorporated herein by reference herein in its entirety.<br>
The tensile NDR is determined by performing standard tensile stress-strain experiments on dogbone specimens at a deformation rate of 51 mm/min in accordance with ASTM D638.  Referring to Figure 1, a representative stress-strain curve is shown where the<br>
tensile strain is plotted as percent strain and the stress is expressed as force or load (in lbf). Inflection points 20, 40, 50 and 60 mark points at which transformations in material behavior occur. Initially, at conditions of low strain a linear region 10 is observed. In this linear region 10 the material experiences a stress (F) directly proportional to the applied strain (u) and the material behavior can be approximated by Hooke's law (equation 2) with the constant of proportionality being the elastic or Young's modulus denoted Y:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Also, in the linear region 10, the deformation behavior is approximately elastic, i.e. the material strain returns to zero when the applied load is removed. The stress at the point where the material's behavior changes from elastic to plastic is known as the yield stress Application of a load beyond the yield point 20, results in permanent (or plastic) material deformation. Generally, the yield point 20 in polyethylene is evident as a maximum in the load-strain traces as shown in Figure 1. Beyond the yield point, as the specimen is stretched continuously, the material outside the neck region in the dogbone specimen is drawn into the neck; the load does not change very much during this necking and drawing process. This necking/drawing process continues until the specimen encounters "strain-hardening" or point 50 in Figure 1. The onset of strain-hardening simply means that any further deformation of the specimen requires considerably more energy input. This is evident in a substantial and dramatic increase in the load in Figure 1. In other words, the onset of strain hardening 50 marks a period 90 when more stress is required to achieve a given strain than seen in the previous region of the curve. The percent strain at the onset of strain-hardening is defined as the tensile NDR. The continued application of load to the material will eventually result in the material's fracture at the break stress and strain point 60.<br>
Some polymers do not exhibit the distinct strain-hardening behavior shown in Figure 1.   Therefore, in order to define a tensile NDR, the following criterion needs to be<br>
satisfied first: the tensile stress at break is at least 10 % higher than that of the tensile yield stress (σbrk&gt; 1.10*σy). The tensile NDR values reported in this application are the average of at least five measurements.<br>
In an embodiment, the PE compositions of this disclosure have a reduced tensile NDR in comparison to conventional PE compositions. Conventional PE compositions include any PE composition used to fabricate high-pressure rated pipe such as those used in the production of PE80 or PE100 designated pipe. Examples of such conventional PE compositions include without limitation CONTINUUM DGDA 2490-BK polyethylene high density that is a bimodal PE100 rated pressure pipe resin commercially available from Dow Chemical Company or MARFLEX® HHM TR-480X high-density polyethylene that is a PE-80 rated pressure pipe resin commercially available from Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, LP.<br>
In an embodiment, the PE compositions of this disclosure have a tensile NDR of less than about 14167ρ - 12958, where p is the polymer density,. In such an embodiment, the tensile NDR is expressed in percent strain and determined in accordance with ASTM D 638 and the polymer density is in units of g/cc and determined in accordance with ASTM D 1505. The PE composition of this disclosure may display a lower or equal tensile NDR at a higher polymer density than a conventional PE composition.<br>
In another embodiment, the PE compositions of this disclosure have a tensile NDR of less than about 25σy - 130, where σy is the yield stress of the composition. In such an embodiment, the tensile NDR is expressed in percent strain and determined in accordance with ASTM D 638 and the yield stress is in units of MPa and determined in accordance with ASTM D638. The PE composition of this disclosure may display a lower or equivalent tensile NDR at a higher yield stress than a conventional PE composition.<br>
In an embodiment a PE composition of this disclosure has a tensile NDR of less than about 14167ρ- 12958, where p is the polymer density, alternatively of less than about 25σy - 130, where σy is the polymer yield stress, alternatively any combination thereof.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The invention having been generally described, the following examples are given as particular embodiments of the invention and to demonstrate the practice and advantages thereof. It is understood that the examples are given by way of illustration and are not intended to limit the specification of the claims in any manner.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Alumina A, from W.R. Grace Company, was impregnated to incipient wetness with an aqueous solution of ammonium sulfate. Typically, the alumina had a surface area of about 330 m2/gram and a pore volume of about 1.3 cc/gram. The amount of ammonium sulfate used was equal to 20% of the starting alumina. The volume of water used to dissolve the ammonium sulfate was calculated from the total pore volume of the starting sample (i.e. 2.6 mLs of water for each gram of alumina to be treated). Thus, a solution of about 0.08 grams of ammonium sulfate per mL of water was employed. The resulting wet sand was dried in a vacuum oven overnight at 120 °C, and then screened through a 35-mesh screen. Finally, the material was activated in a fluidizing stream of dry air at 550 °C for 3 hours, in the case of bench scale samples, or 6 hours, for the larger pilot plant samples. The samples were then stored under nitrogen.<br>
The PE compositions of Table 1 of this disclosure were produced in a 27.3-gallon slurry loop reactor. Polymerization runs were carried out under continuous particle form process conditions in a loop reactor by contacting a metallocene catalyst in isobutane, trialkylaluminum, and a solid activator in a 0.5 L stirred autoclave with continuous output to the loop reactor.<br><br>
The precontacting was carried out in the following manner. Trialkylaluminum solution and metallocene catalyst in isobutane were fed as separate streams into a tee upstream of the autoclave where they contacted each other. The solid activator was flushed with isobutane into a tee between the aforementioned tee and the autoclave, contacting the Trialkylaluminum/ metallocenes mixture just before entering the autoclave. The isobutane flush used to transport the solid activator into the autoclave was set at a rate that would result in a residence time of approximately 14-16 minutes in the autoclave. The total flow from the autoclave then entered the loop reactor.<br>
The ethylene used was a polymerization grade ethylene (obtained form Union Carbide Corporation), which was purified through a column of alumina activated at 250 °C (482 °F) in nitrogen. The 1-Hexene used was a polymerization grade 1-hexene (obtained from Chevron Chemicals Company) which was purified by nitrogen purging and storage over 13-X molecular sieve activated at 250 °C (482 °F) in nitrogen. The loop reactor was a liquid full, 15.2 cm diameter, loop reactor, having a volume of 27.3 gallons (103.3 liters). Liquid isobutane was used as the diluent. Some hydrogen was added to regulate the molecular weight of the low molecular weight component of the polymer product. The isobutane was a polymerization grade isobutane (obtained from ConocoPhillips Company, Borger, Texas) that was further purified by distillation and subsequently passed through a column of alumina activated at 250 °C (482 °F) in nitrogen.<br>
Reactor conditions included a pressure around 580 psi (4 MPa), and a temperature about 95 °C (203 °F) as indicated in Table 1. Also, the reactor was operated to have a residence time of about 1.1 hours. The solid activator was added through a 0.35 ml circulating ball-check feeder and fed to the 0.5-Liter autoclave as described above. Metallocene concentrations in the reactor were within a range of about 3.27 to 3.58 parts per million (ppm) of the diluent in the polymerization reactor. Polymer was removed from the reactor at the rate of about 22 lbs per<br>
hour and recovered in a flash chamber.  A Vulcan dryer was used to dry the polymer under nitrogen at about 60-80 °C (140-176 °F).<br>
The cocatalyst (TIBA) was added in a concentration in a range of from about 110 to 201 parts per million of the diluent in the polymerization reactor. To prevent static buildup of the reactor, a small amount (less than 5 ppm, by weight, of diluent) STADTS 450 conductivity improver, which is an antistatic agent commercially available from Octelstarreon LLC was usually added. The catalyst systems used were previously described and are represented by Structures A and B.<br>

EXAMPLE 2 <br>
The differential weight fraction MWD was determined for the PE compositions prepared under conditions specified in Table 1 arc shown in Figure 2 respectively. The figures<br>
show the resulting PE compositions to have two peaks corresponding to a bimodal PE composition.<br>
EXAMPLE 3 <br>
Select mechanical properties of the PE compositions of this disclosure (Table 1) along with a few commercially available pressure pipe-grade HDPE resins are listed in Table 2. The tensile NDR of the PE compositions of this disclosure were determined as a function of their density, yield stress and HLMI. In all cases tensile tests of the PE compositions (compression molded by slow cooling from the molten state) were performed using die-cut ASTM Type IV specimens using an Instron tensile tester. Tests at room temperature were performed in accordance with ASTM D 638-00 using a crosshead speed of 51 mm/min.<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
The PE compositions of this disclosure (Table 1) are denoted as "invention polymers" in Figures 3 and 4. These PE compositions are compared to other resins used in the fabrication of high pressure rated polymer pipe which are: PBTF bimodal resins, a series of bimodal polyethylene developmental resins used to fabricate PE100-rated pipes which are<br><br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent Application entitled "Multimodal Polyethylene Compositions and Pipe made from Same" Attorney Docket Number 4081-08400 which is incorporated herein in its entirety; MARFLEX® HHM TR-480X high-density polyethylene and MARLEX® 9346 high density polyethylene which are PE80 pressure rated pipe resins commercially available from Chevron Phillips Chemical; H524 and H525 are Chevron Phillips Chemical developmental HDPEs which are PE100 and PE80 pressure rated pipe resins respectively; MARLEX® H516B high density polyethylene compound which is a bimodal PE100 pressure rated pipe resin commercially available from Chevron Phillips Chemical; CONTINUUM DGDA 2490-BK polyethylene high density which is a bimodal PE100 rated pressure pipe resin commercially available from Dow Chemical Company; HDPE XT10N which is a high molecular weight bimodal pipe resin commercially available from TOTAL Petrochemicals Inc.; and ELTEX TUB121N3000 high-density polyethylene PE100-rated pipe which is a polyethylene resin commercially available from BP Solvay.<br>
The tensile NDR of the resins are plotted as a function of the resin density, Figure 3 and, as a function of the resin yield stress, Figure 4. In Figures 3 and 4, the tensile NDR when plotted as a function of density and yield stress show three groupings of data. The first group comprises MARFLEX® HHM TR-480X high-density polyethylene, MARLEX® 9346 high-density polyethylene and H525 which display the least SCG resistance and consequently the highest tensile NDR in comparison to the other resins tested. This result was not surprising considering Group 1 consists of medium performance PE80 resin grades. The second group comprises PBTF bimodal resins, H524 a Chevron Phillips Chemical developmental HDPE, MARLEX® H516B high-density polyethylene compound, CONTINUUM DGDA 2490-BK polyethylene high density, HDPE XT10N and ELTEX TUB121N3000 high-deasity polyethylene pipe. Group 2 is a collection of PE100 resins that display excellent SCG resistance. In fact, Group 2 comprises the best performers in terms of SCG resistance amongst<br>
all commercially available pressure pipe resins. However the third group consisting of the PE compositions of this disclosure and denoted "invention polymers" display SCG resistance that show the lowest tensile NDR for the given densities and yield stress making them considerably superior with regard to SCG resistance to the high performance PE100 resins of Group 2.<br>
