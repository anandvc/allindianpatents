Stabiliser composition for halogen-containing polymers<br>
The present invention relates to a stabiliser composition for foams of halogen-containing polymers. The present invention relates also to a process for the preparation of a stabiliser composition for foams of halogen-containing polymers and also to the use of a composition for stabilising a foam of halogen-containing polymers. In accordance with a further aspect, the present invention relates also to a moulded article produced from a foam of at least one halogen-containing polymer stabilised in accordance with the invention.<br>
It is known that halogen-containing plastics have a tendency to undergo undesirable decomposition and breakdown reactions under thermal stress during processing or during long-term use. The breakdown of halogenated polymers, especially the breakdown of PVC, results in the formation of hydrochloric acid, which is eliminated from the polymer strand, resulting in a discoloured, unsaturated plastics having colour-imparting polyene sequences.<br>
A particular problem in that case is that halogen-containing polymers exhibit the rheological conditions necessary for processing only at a relatively high temperature. At such temperatures, however, in the case of unstabilised polymers the polymer already begins to undergo significant decomposition, which results both in the undesirable colour change described above and in a change in the material properties. Furthermore, the hydrochloric acid freed from non-stabilised, halogen-containing polymers at such a processing temperature can lead to significant corrosion of the processing apparatus. That process plays a particular role when, during the processing of such halogenated polymers to form moulded articles, for example by extrusion, production is interrupted and the polymer mass remains in the extruder for a prolonged period. During that period the above-mentioned decomposition reactions may occur, so that the charge in the extruder is rendered unusable and the extruder may possibly be damaged.<br>
Furthermore, polymers that are subjected to such decomposition have a tendency<br><br>
to adhere to the processing apparatus and the adhering portions are difficult to remove again.<br>
In order to solve the mentioned problems, so-called stabilisers are usualh- added to halogen-containing polymers in the context of processing with the objective of as far as possible preventing the above-mentioned decomposition reactions. Such stabilisers are generally solids that are added to the polymers prior to processing.<br>
In the past however, it has often been found that in the processing of halogen-containing polymers to form foams, the use of blowing agents leads to unsatisfactory results in terms of the initial colour and the colour retention of the resulting polymer foams. Especially the use of blowing agents based on azodicarbona-mide impairs the above-mentioned properties of the foams to a considerable de-gree.<br>
The German patent application having the file reference DE 101 24 734.6 describes a stabiliser composition for halogen-containing polymers that comprises a salt of a halogen-containing oxy acid and an inorganic or organic acid or an inorganic base. Although the use of blowing agents is described in the context of the description, the specification makes no mention of a synergistic effect arising from the combined use of blowing agents in a certain amount together with a salt of a halogen-containing oxy acid for the production of foams of halogen-containing polymers.<br>
DE 198 60 798 and DE 101 09 366 as well as the abstracts from STN Files CAPLUS. WPIX, JAPIO of documents JP 2001261907 A. JP 2000290418 A. JP 09165463 A, JP 09118767 A, JP 07157587 A and JP 635035635 relate to stabiliser compositions for halogen-containing polymers.<br>
DE 100 56 880 relates to stabiliser compositions for halogen-containing organic plastics which have to comprise cyanoacetylureas and further compounds.<br>
DE 101 09 366 Al, DE 199 15 388 Al and DE 101 18 179 are likewise concerned with the stabilisation of halogen-containing plastics.<br><br>
The problem underlying the present invention was therefore to provide a stabiliser composition that can be used in the production of foams of halogen-containing polymers and results in an improvement in initial colour. A further problem underlying the present invention was to provide a stabiliser composition that can be used in the production of halogen-containing polymers. A further problem underlying the invention was to provide a stabiliser composition that exhibits an improvement in initial colour in the processing of foams of halogen-containing polymers in comparison with stabilisers known from the prior an.<br>
The invention described below therefore relates, firstly generally to the stabilisation of foams of halogen-containing polymers and secondly to the provision of a stabiliser composition that is already tailored to the needs of the manufacturer of such foams and, in addition to comprising a stabilising component, also already comprises a blowing agent. The term "stabiliser composition" is therefore used in the context of the following text both for compositions that are suitable for stabilising foams of halogen-containing polymers and for compositions that comprise both stabilising components and blowing agents. In the sense of the use of a stabiliser composition according to the invention, the present invention includes and relates firstly to the use of pre-mixed stabiliser compositions that comprise a blowing agent. Secondly, the invention also includes those situations in which the stabiliser composition is mixed only shortly before use in the polymer or the mixing takes place in situ in the polymer during its processing.<br>
It has now been found that the above-mentioned problems are sohed by stabiliser compositions comprising at least one salt of a halogen-containing oxy acid and at least one blowing agent component together forming more than 0.1 % by weight, based on the total weight of the stabiliser composition.<br>
The present invention accordingly relates to a stabiliser composition for foams of halogen-containing polymers, at least comprising a salt of a halogen-containing oxy acid and at least one blowing agent, the proportion- of the two components together being at least 0.1 % by weight, based on the total weight of the stabiliser composition.<br><br>
It has also been found that a stabiliser composition comprising at least one salt of a halogen-containing oxy acid is suitable for stabilising polymer compositions that comprise at least 0.1 % by weight blowing agent.<br>
It has also been found that polymer compositions that comprise at least one halo-sen-containing polymer. at least one salt of a halogen-containing oxv acid and at least 0.1 % by weisht of a blowing agent do not exhibit the disadvantages of the blowing-agent-containing systems known from the prior art or they exhibit those disadvantages only to a very small degree.<br>
A stabiliser composition according to the invention may be a solid stabiliser composition or a liquid stabiliser composition. When a stabiliser composition according to the invention is in the liquid state, then in the context of the present invention it preferably comprises at least one organic solvent.<br>
A "stabiliser composition" is to be understood in the context of the present invention as being a composition that can be used for stabilising foams of halogen-containing polymers. For achieving that stabilising effect, a stabiliser composition according to the invention is generally mixed with a halogen-containing polymer to be stabilised and then processed. It is equally possible, however, for a stabiliser composition according to the invention to be mixed with the halogen-containing polymer to be stabilised during processing.<br>
The term "liquid" is to be understood in the context of the present invention as being the state of aggregation of a stabiliser composition according to the invention at least within a temperature range of from about 45 to about 100°C preferably within a temperature range of from about 30 to about 120°C, for example within a temperature range of from about 15 to about 150°C and especially within a temperature range of from about 0 to about 200°C.<br>
A suitable salt of a halogen-containing oxy acid is an appropriate inorganic salt or ail organic salt.<br>
The expression "inorganic salt or a nalogen-containing oxy acid   is to be under-<br><br>
stood in the context of this text as meaning a salt of the general formula M(CI04)k wherein M is an inorganic cation. Possible inorganic cations M are inter alia preferably Li, Na, K, Mg, Ca, Sr. Zn. Al, La and Ce. The index k. according to the valency of M in the case of the cations that are mentioned inter alia as being preferred, is the number 1. 2 or 3.<br>
The expression "organic salt of a halogen-containing oxy acid" is to be understood in the context of this text as meaning a salt of the general formula M(CLO1)-k wherein M is a cation having at least one organic constituent. Possible orsanic cations M are inter alia preferably organic onium ions, the expression "organic onium ion" being understood in the context of this text as meaning ammonium. sulfonium or phosphonium ions, each carrying at least one organic radical. An onium salt in accordance with the present invention may carry 1. 2:3 or 4 organic radicals according to the nature of the onium group. The organic radicals can be bonded to the onium radical, for example, by way of a C-X linkage, where X is S, N or P. It is equally possible, however, for the organic radicals to be bonded to the onium radical by way of a further hetero atom, for example an 0 atom.<br>
An onium perchlorate suitable for use in the context of the present invention has-at least one positively charged N, P or S atom or two or more such positively charged N, P or S atoms or mixtures of two or more of the mentioned, positively charged atoms.<br>
In the context of the present invention, there are used as onium perchlorates compounds that carry at least one organic radical and at most the maximum possible number of organic radicals on the N, S or P atom. When an onium perchlorate suitable for use according to the invention carries a smaller number of organic radicals than is necessary for the formation of a positively charged onium ion, the positive charge is generated in a customary manner known to the person skilled in the art by protonation by means of a suitable acid, so that the onium perchlorate in question then carries at least one proton in addition to an organic radical.<br>
It is therefore possible according to the invention to use as onium perchlorates<br><br>
compounds having a positive charge as a result of protonation reactions. It is. however, equally possible in the context of the stabiliser combinations according to the invention to use onium perchlorates having a positive charge as a result of a peralkylation reaction. Examples of such compounds are tetraalkylammonium. trialkylsulfonium and tetraalkylphosphonium perchlorates. It is. however, also provided in the context of the present invention for a peralkylated onium perchlo-rate suitable for use according to the invention to have an arvl. alkarvl. cvcloalkvl. alkenyl. alkynyl or cycloalkenyl radical. It is likewise possible and provided according to the invention for an onium salt suitable for use in a stabiliser composition according to the invention to have two or possibly more different types of substituent. for example an alkyl radical and a cvcloalkvl radical or an alkyl radical and an aryl radical.<br>
It is likewise possible and provided in the context of the present invention for an onium salt suitable for use in a stabiliser composition according to the invention to have substituents that are themselves substituted by one or more functional groups. The term "functional groups" denotes groups that improve the activity of the stabiliser composition or at least do not impair that activity or impair it only to a negligible extent. Such functional groups can be, for example. NH groups. NH: groups, OH groups, SH groups, ester groups, ether groups, thioether groups, iso-cyanurate groups or keto groups or mixtures of two or more thereof.<br>
Phosphonium perchlorates suitable for use in the context of the present invention are in principle any compounds that, by appropriate reaction of suitable reactants. result in a phosphonium perchlorate. Phosphonium perchlorates suitable for use according to the invention can be obtained, for example, by appropriate reaction of tetraalkyl-, tetracycloalkyl- or tetraaryl-phosphorus halides. Suitable phosphonium perchlorates are therefore derived, for example, from tetraalkylphosphorus salts, such as tetra-n-ethylphosphonium bromide, tetra-n-propylphosphonium bromide, tetra-n-butylphosphonium bromide, tetra-n-isobutylphosphonium. bromide, tetra-n-pentylphosphonium bromide, tetra-n-hexylphosphonium bromide and like tetraalkylphosphorus salts. Also suitable in principle for use in the con-<br><br>
text of the stabiliser compositions according to the invention are phosphonium perchlorates derived, for example, from tetracycloalkylphosphorus salts or tetraarylphosphorus salts. Suitable phosphonium perchlorates are therefore based, for example, on tetracycloalkyl- or tetraaryl-phosphorus salts such as tetracyclo-hexylphosphonium bromide or tetraphenylphosphonium bromide and like tetracycloalkyl- or tetraaryl-phosphorus salts. The compounds mentioned above can be unsubstituted in the context of the present invention, but they may also have one or more of the above-mentioned substituents provided that, in the context of the stabiliser composition, those substituents have no disadvantageous activity and have no adverse effect on the intended use of the stabiliser composition.<br>
Also suitable for use in the context of the present invention are organic phosphonium perchlorates that carry at a phosphorus atom different types of organic substituents which in turn may optionally be differently substituted.<br>
Within the scope of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, tetra-n-butylphosphonium perchlorate or triphenylbenzylphosphonium perchlorate is used as phosphonium perchlorate.<br>
Sulfonium perchlorates suitable for use in the context of the present invention are in principle any compounds that, by appropriate reaction of suitable reactants. result in a sulfonium perchlorate. Sulfonium perchlorates suitable for use according to the invention can be obtained, for example, by appropriate reaction of sulfides such as alkyl monosulfides, alkyl disulfides, dialkyl sulfides or polyalkyl sulfides. Suitable sulfonium perchlorates are therefore derived, for example, from dialkyl sulfides such as ethyl benzyl sulfide, allyl benzyl sulfide or alkyl disulfides such as hexane disulfide, heptane disulfide, octane disulfide and like alkyl disulfides. Also suitable in principle for use in the context of the stabiliser compositions according to the invention are sulfonium perchlorates derived, for example, from tricvcloalkylsulfonium salts or triarylsulfonium salts. Suitable sulfonium perchlorates are therefore based, for example, on tricycloalkyl- or triarylsulfonium salts such as tricyclohexylsulfonium bromide or triphenylsulfonium bromide and like tricycloalkyl- or triaryl-sulfonium salts. Also suitable are trial-<br><br>
kyl-, triaryl- or tricycloalkyl-suifoxonium salts such as trimethylsulfoxonium per-chlorate. The compounds mentioned above can be unsubstituted in the context of the present invention, but they may also have one or more of the above-mentioned substituents provided that, in the context of the stabiliser composition, those sub-stituents have no disadvantageous activity and have no adverse effect on the intended use of the stabiliser composition.<br>
Also suitable for use in the context of the present invention are organic sulfonium perchlorates that carry at a sulfur atom different types of organic substituents which in turn may optionally be differently substituted.<br>
Within the scope of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, trimethylsulfoxonium perchlorate is used as sulfonium perchlorate.<br>

Ammonium perchlorates suitable for use in accordance with the invention can be obtained, for example, by appropriate reaction of amines or amides such as alkyl monoamines, alkylenediamines. alkyl polyamines, secondary or tertiary amines or dialkylamines.
