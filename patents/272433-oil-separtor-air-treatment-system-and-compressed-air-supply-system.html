Oil separator, air treatment system and<br>
compressed air supply system<br>
The invention relates to an oil separator for an air<br>
treatment system of a utility vehicle, wherein the air<br>
treatment system has a valve housing with at least one<br>
outlet connector for a compressed air user and a filter<br>
unit which serves in particular to dry the compressed<br>
air which is to be fed to the compressed air user, and<br>
the oil separator has an interface by means of which it<br>
can be coupled to the filter unit.<br>
The invention also relates to an air treatment system<br>
and a compressed air supply system.<br>
Air treatment systems serve primarily to dehumidify the<br>
compressed air supplied by a compressor before said<br>
compressed air is fed to the compressed air users, in<br>
particular a brake system. Since the air which is<br>
supplied by the compressor is contaminated, it is<br>
desired to clean it before it is fed to the filter<br>
unit, and in this way the intention is to delay<br>
contamination of the filter unit. The compressed air<br>
which is supplied by the compressor is contaminated,<br>
for example, with oil which is used as a lubricant in<br>
the compressor, and further contaminants originate from<br>
the atmosphere, for example. It is known to use what is<br>
referred to as an oil separator to remove such<br>
contaminants as well as other contaminants, and the<br>
compressed air has to flow through said oil separator<br>
before the compressed air enters the filter unit.<br>
An example of such a cleaning device is specified<br>
in US 6,071,321. The oil separators which are specified<br>
in said document or constructed in a comparable fashion<br>
generally operate using centrifugal force. An air<br>
stream is fed with a tangential component to an<br><br>
WO 2006/099989	- 2 - PCT/EP2006/002411<br>
essentially cylindrical chamber so that particles which<br>
are carried along by the air as a result of the<br>
centrifugal force are forced outward in accordance with<br>
the irrelatively high mass so that they can ultimately<br>
be precipitated on the wall of the chamber. The<br>
particles can then collect on the floor of the chamber<br>
and be carried away from there.<br>
Generally, attempts are made to ensure that as many as<br>
possible of the functions which have to be performed by<br>
a compressed air treatment system are integrated into a<br>
small number of components. Accordingly, US 6,071,321<br>
has already proposed building the oil separator onto<br>
the filter unit.<br>
In accordance with the aforementioned desire for<br>
integration, modern air treatment systems from the<br>
prior art perform, in addition to the functions<br>
relating to the filtering of the compressed air,<br>
further functions which are associated with the<br>
pressure control and the protection of the compressed<br>
air user circuits. In this regard, a pressure<br>
controller and a multi-circuit protection valve form<br>
central components of an air treatment system alongside<br>
the filter unit, with the pressure controller and the<br>
multi-circuit protection valve being arranged in a<br>
valve housing. More wide ranging integration of<br>
components, that is to say for example of an oil<br>
separator in the air treatment system, would appear<br>
appropriate within the scope of modification of the<br>
valve housing. However, such modifications entail<br>
disadvantages since they require additional expenditure<br>
on cabling and changes to existing production<br>
strategies and sales and marketing strategies.<br>
The present invention is based on the object of making<br>
available an oil separator, an air treatment system and<br>
a compressed air supply system so that the oil<br><br>
WO 2006/099989	- 3 - PCT/EP2006/002411<br>
separator can be integrated into the air treatment<br>
system in a particularly easy and reliable way, and in<br>
this context in particular the removal of the<br>
contamination collected in the oil separator is to be<br>
integrated into the functional sequences of the air<br>
treatment system.<br>
This object is achieved by means of the features of the<br>
independent claims.<br>
Advantageous embodiments of the invention are specified<br>
in the dependent claims.<br>
The invention builds on the oil separator of the<br>
generic type by virtue of the fact that the oil<br>
separator has a further interface by means of which it<br>
can be coupled to the valve housing. As a result, the<br>
oil separator can be configured in such a way that it<br>
can be used in conjunction with air treatment systems<br>
according to the prior art.<br>
In this regard it is particularly useful that the oil<br>
separator is arranged in the manner of a sandwich<br>
between the valve housing and the filter unit. Air<br>
treatment systems according to the prior art generally<br>
have a filter unit which is coupled to a valve housing<br>
via a flange like connection. By virtue of the fact<br>
that the oil separator is constructed in such a way<br>
that it permits both a flange like connection to the<br>
filter unit and a flange like connection to the valve<br>
housing it is possible to make available a compact air<br>
treatment system with an integrated oil separator.<br>
According to a particularly advantageous embodiment of<br>
the present invention there is provision for the oil<br>
separator to have an inlet connector by means of which<br>
a compressed air source can be coupled to the air<br>
treatment system. In air treatment systems according to<br><br>
WO 2006/099989	- 4 - PCT/EP2006/002411<br>
the prior art, the inlet connector for the compressed<br>
air is conventionally arranged on the valve housing. On<br>
the basis of the invention it is possible, by including<br>
an inlet connector at the oil separator, to feed the<br>
compressed air directly on the shortest path to the<br>
component of the air treatment system in which the<br>
first processing of the compressed air takes place.<br>
Furthermore it is possible to provide for the oil<br>
separator to have an outlet connector. In this way, or<br>
in a comparable way, additional functions which<br>
conventionally have to be provided in the region of the<br>
valve housing can be assigned to the oil separator.<br>
In this context it is possible for the oil separator to<br>
have a connector at which unpurified compressed air can<br>
be extracted and/or compressed air which is to be<br>
purified can be fed to, in particular in order to<br>
inflate tires. Such a connector can usefully be<br>
employed as an outlet connector for all the functions,<br>
and it is possible to operate without difficulty with<br>
unpurified air with said connector. Likewise such an<br>
outlet connector can be used as a test connector. If<br>
the connector is used as an inlet connector, it is<br>
possible to feed compressed air via said connector, in<br>
particular from a source external to the vehicle, and<br>
said air is then purified in the oil separator.<br>
Furthermore it is useful that the oil separator has a<br>
safety valve. Such a safety valve can be configured<br>
with the aim of limiting the system pressure, and when<br>
there are very different pressure conditions within the<br>
air treatment system it is also possible to adopt an<br>
explicit configuration of the safety valve in order to<br>
achieve the maximum permitted pressure in the oil<br>
separator.<br><br>
WO 2006/099989	- 5 - PCT/EP2006/002411<br>
According to a particularly preferred embodiment, the<br>
present invention is also developed in that the oil<br>
separator has a first space into which compressed air<br>
to be purified can be conducted, wherein air conducting<br>
means by means of which the flow speed of the through-<br>
flowing air can be varied are arranged in the first<br>
space, and in that the oil separator has a second space<br>
which air which has been purified in the first space<br>
can be fed to and by means of which the purified air<br>
can be fed to the filter unit. The precipitation of<br>
extraneous particles can be promoted by the air<br>
conducting means. By virtue of the fact that the<br>
compressed air flows through the oil separator at<br>
changing speeds it is possible for such particles to<br>
accumulate at an early time. Such accumulations<br>
increase the mass of the particles, which promotes<br>
their transportation to the outer side of the oil<br>
separator owing to the centrifugal force. A further<br>
space via which the purified air can then be fed to the<br>
filter unit is provided separately from the space<br>
equipped with the air conducting means, and a direct<br>
connection of the filter unit to the first space which<br>
conducts the impurities is therefore not necessary.<br>
It is particularly preferred that the first space and<br>
the second space are embodied as essentially axially<br>
symmetrical annular spaces with a common axis. In this<br>
regard, the air to be purified firstly flows through a<br>
radially outer annular space before it is fed to the<br>
filter unit in a purified form via the radially inner<br>
annular space.<br>
It is particularly useful that the compressed air can<br>
be fed to the first space with a tangential component.<br>
The tangential component within the first space is<br>
necessary in order to utilize the centrifugal force for<br>
precipitating the impurities. Even though the<br>
tangential component can basically be generated solely<br><br>
WO 2006/099989	- 6 - PCT/EP2006/002411<br>
by the air conducting means which are arranged in the<br>
first space it is nevertheless useful to feed the<br>
compressed air to the first space with a tangential<br>
component from the outset.<br>
With regard to the structural configuration of the oil<br>
separator according to the invention it is particularly<br>
preferred for the air conducting means to have a<br>
plurality of air conducting elements whose main planes<br>
are arranged on various axial coordinates, for the air<br>
conducting elements to have air feed sections which<br>
extend put of their respective main plane, and for<br>
adjacent air feed sections of adjacent air conducting<br>
elements not to be parallel. Such air conducting<br>
elements can easily be manufactured, for example by<br>
punching circular ring like elements and then bending<br>
them appropriately. The nonparallel arrangement of<br>
adjacent air feed sections causes, on the essentially<br>
helix like path of the air through the first space,<br>
flow bottlenecks and regions in which a large flow<br>
cross section is available. In this regard, changes in<br>
speed occur which advantageously promote the<br>
accumulation of the particles.<br>
There is usefully provision for the angle between air<br>
feed sections and main planes to be between 10 and 20<br>
degrees, and preferably to be 15 degrees.<br>
According to another particularly preferred embodiment<br>
of the present invention, said embodiment is developed<br>
- by virtue of the fact that at least some of the air<br>
conducting elements are of identical design, wherein<br>
the non-parallelism of the air feed sections of<br>
adjacent air conducting elements is implemented by<br>
means of a relative rotation of the air conducting<br>
elements with respect to one another. It is accordingly<br>
possible to use identical air conducting elements,<br>
which makes the manufacture of the oil separator<br><br>
WO 2006/099989	- 7 - PCT/EP2006/002411<br>
particularly cost effective and reliable. The flow<br>
cross sections on the flow path of the compressed air<br>
through the first space can be varied solely by virtue<br>
of the relative rotation of the air conducting elements<br>
with respect to one another.<br>
It is particularly preferred that the internal diameter<br>
of the air conducting elements corresponds to the<br>
external diameter of an essentially cylindrical wall<br>
which separates the first space from the second space.<br>
In this way, the air conducting elements can be fitted<br>
onto the cylindrical wall in a positively locking<br>
and/or frictionally locking fashion, and additional<br>
attachment means can be provided between the air<br>
conducting elements and the cylindrical wall.<br>
It is also particularly preferred for the first space<br>
to have a floor region in which precipitated oil is<br>
collected and on which an outlet for extracting the<br>
collected oil is arranged. The precipitated oil, or to<br>
formulate this more generally, the precipitated<br>
impurities, therefore collect in the first space at a<br>
location from which the collected oil can be discharged<br>
directly.<br>
In this context it is particularly useful that the<br>
essentially cylindrical wall is of stepped design in<br>
the floor region of the first space. Such a stepped<br>
design of the cylindrical wall in the floor region of<br>
the first space prevents oil from creeping out within<br>
the first space and . prevents oil from creeping down<br>
from the first space into the second space. In this way<br>
renewed contamination of the compressed air which flows<br>
through the second space is avoided.<br>
For comparable reasons, there is provision for the<br>
junction between the first space and the second space<br>
to be formed by at least one tube which projects into<br><br>
WO 2006/099989	- 8 - PCT/EP2006/002411<br>
the first space and which has at least one collar like<br>
protrusion on its outer side. The collar like<br>
protrusion or preferably the plurality of collar like<br>
protrusions also prevent oil from creeping out of the<br>
first space into the second space.<br>
The invention also relates to an air treatment system<br>
having an oil separator according to the invention and<br>
a compressed air supply system having an air treatment<br>
system according to the invention.<br>
The compressed air supply system according to the<br>
invention is particularly preferably developed in that<br>
the oil separator has an outlet which is coupled to an<br>
outlet opening of the valve housing in order to<br>
discharge precipitated substances. Air treatment<br>
systems according to the generic type have a discharge<br>
opening for regenerating the filter unit. In order to<br>
regenerate the air filter unit, air from the reservoir<br>
containers of the utility vehicle flows through the<br>
filter unit in a reverse direction, and the air then<br>
leaves the air treatment system via an outlet opening.<br>
According to the invention it is possible to provide<br>
for this outlet opening also to be used for removing<br>
from the oil separator the substances which have been<br>
precipitated in said oil separator. In this context it<br>
is, under certain circumstances, necessary to ensure<br>
that the substances which are frequently problematic in<br>
terms of the environment and which collect in the oil<br>
separator are not readily blown into the atmosphere.<br>
The invention is based on the recognition that by<br>
suitably configuring an oil separator with interfaces<br>
it is possible to retrofit conventional air treatment<br>
systems.<br><br>

sectional view along the section line indicated by AA<br>
in figure 5. The air treatment system 12 according to<br>
the invention comprises a filter unit 18 which is<br>
embodied as a dryer cartridge, a valve housing 14 and<br><br>
WO 2006/099989	- 11 - PCT/EP2006/002411<br>
an oil separator 10 which is arranged in the manner of<br>
a sandwich between the filter unit 18 and the valve<br>
housing 14. The aforesaid components of the air<br>
treatment system 12 have interfaces which permit the<br>
components to be coupled in the way which is<br>
illustrated and described. In particular, the oil<br>
separator 10 has an interface for coupling to the<br>
filter unit 18, and an interface for coupling to the<br>
valve housing 14. The valve housing 14 has a further<br>
interface which faces away from the oil separator 10<br>
and which can be seen in figure 4. The oil separator 10<br>
has an inlet connector 20 by means of which compressed<br>
air from a compressor can be fed to the oil<br>
separator 10 and thus to the air treatment system 12.<br>
While the air treatment system 12 is operating, this<br>
inlet connector 20 which is arranged on the oil<br>
separator 10 replaces an inlet connector 54 which is<br>
arranged on the valve housing 14. In the case of air<br>
treatment systems according to the prior art, the<br>
filter unit 18 is coupled directly to the valve<br>
housing 14 without intermediate connection of an oil<br>
separator 20. If it is necessary to make available an<br>
inlet connector 54 on the valve housing 14. Since<br>
according to the invention an oil separator 10 is<br>
arranged between the filter unit 18 and the valve<br>
housing 14, the oil separator 10 can be equipped with<br>
an inlet connector 20 in order to feed the compressed<br>
air to be purified to the oil separator 10 on the<br>
shortest path. A further connector 22 which can be used<br>
as an extraneous inflation inlet connector and as a<br>
tire inflation outlet connector is provided on the oil<br>
separator 10. Compressed air which is to be purified<br>
can be fed to the latter from a source, which is for<br>
example external to the vehicle, or unpurified<br>
compressed air can be extracted at said connector for<br>
any desired purposes, for example for inflating tires.<br>
In addition, a safety valve 24 is provided. In the<br>
interior of the oil separator 10, a first space 26 and<br><br>
WO 2006/099989	- 12 - PCT/EP2006/002411<br>
a second space 30 are provided, and these are connected<br>
to one another via tubes 46. In the first space 26 air<br>
conducting means 28 are arranged, the configuration and<br>
method of operation of which are explained in more<br>
detail with respect to drawings which are described<br>
below. The oil separator 10 thus comprises the main<br>
components of an external housing 60, of an insert 62<br>
and of air conducting means 28 arranged on the insert<br>
62 in the housing 60.<br>
While the air treatment system 12 is operating,<br>
compressed air is fed to the oil separator 10 via the<br>
inlet connector 20. The compressed air firstly flows<br>
into the first space 26 of the oil separator 10, with<br>
the air being given a tangential flow component<br>
immediately as it flows into the first space 26. As a<br>
result of the centrifugal force, contamination is<br>
driven to the inner wall of the housing 60. The<br>
contaminants then collect in the floor region 42 of the<br>
first space 26. An outlet 44 for extracting the<br>
precipitated contaminants is provided in the floor<br>
region 42 of the first space 26. The compressed air can<br>
flow out of the first space 26 into the second space 30<br>
via the tubes 46, from where it can enter the filter<br>
unit 18 via outlet openings 56. After the compressed<br>
air has been dried in the filter unit 18 it flows via a<br>
central flow path 58 of the oil separator 10 into the<br>
valve unit 14 from where it is distributed in a known<br>
fashion among the various user circuits.<br>

which are arranged in a housing of an oil separator<br>
according to the invention. Figure 8 shows a<br>

has a cylindrical wall 40 and a collar 64 which extends<br>
from this wall 40. The collar 64 has a groove 66 so<br>
that in its state in which it is inserted into the<br>
housing 60 (see for example figure 6) the insert 62<br>
seals off the first space 26 (see for example<br>
figure 6) . The cylindrical wall 40 ends with a stepped<br>
region 68 at its end facing away from the collar 64.<br>
Since the precipitated oil collects in the region of<br>
this stepped formation while the air treatment system<br>
is operating, said formation has the effect of<br>
preventing the oil from creeping up the cylindrical<br>
wall 40. Tubes 46, which have collar like<br>
protrusions 48 on their outer circumference, are<br>
provided for the compressed air to pass from the first<br>
space 26 (see for example figure 6) into- the second<br>
space 30 (see for example figure 6). The protrusions 48<br>
are also provided for the purpose of preventing oil<br>
from creeping along the outer circumference of the<br>
tubes 4 6 and thus ultimately from passing over into the<br>
second space 30 (see for example figure 6) . The air<br>
conducting means 28 are implemented as four air<br>
conducting elements 32 of identical design. The<br>
internal diameter of the air conducting elements 32<br>
corresponds essentially to the external diameter of the<br>
cylindrical wall 40 so that the air conducting elements<br>
32 can be fitted onto the insert 26 in a positively<br>
locking and/or frictionally locking fashion. A main<br>
plane 34 is defined with each air conducting element<br>
32. Air feed sections 36 extend from this main plane 34<br>
alternately in different axial directions, with these<br>
air feed sections preferably enclosing an angle of<br>
approximately 15 degrees with the main plane 34. The<br>
air conducting elements 32 are of identical design but<br>
they are fitted onto the insert 62 in a "rotated"<br>
fashion. As a result, different flow cross sections are<br>
provided for the air which flows through the first<br>
space 26 (see for example figure 6), resulting in<br>
varying speeds. These varying speeds promote<br><br>
WO 2006/099989	- 14 - PCT/EP2006/002411<br>
accumulation of the contaminants so that the<br>
transportation of said contaminants to the inner wall<br>
of the housing 60 (see for example figure 6) is<br>
promoted by virtue of the centrifugal force. The air<br>
conducting elements 32 can easily be manufactured, for<br>
example by means of a punching process and a subsequent<br>
bending process, and these processes can also be<br>
combined in a single work step using a suitable tool.<br>
Figure 10 shows a plan view of an insert 62 of an oil<br>
separator according to the invention. Figure 11 shows a<br>
sectional view along the section line indicated by BB<br>
in figure 10. It is possible to see, from the outside<br>
to the inside, the collar with its groove 26, the<br>
outlet openings 56, the second space 30 and the flow<br>
path 58. Furthermore, the stepped region 68 of the<br>
insert 62 can be seen.<br>
Figure 12 is a perspective illustration of a housing of<br>
an oil separator according to the invention. Figure 13<br>
is a further perspective illustration of a housing of<br>
an oil separator according to the invention. The outer<br>
housing 60 of the oil separator has cooling ribs 70<br>
which serve to transport heat away from the oil<br>
separator.<br>
Figure 14 is a perspective illustration of an oil<br>
separator according to the invention. Figure 15 shows a<br>
further perspective illustration of an oil separator<br>
according to the invention. The main components of the<br>
oil separator 10, specifically the insert 62, the air<br>
conducting means 28 and the outer housing 60 can be<br>
seen.<br>
Figure 16 is a schematic illustration of a compressed<br>
air supply system according to the invention. The air<br>
treatment system 12 according to the invention is<br>
constructed from a conventional air treatment system<br><br>
WO 2006/099989	- 15 - PCT/EP2006/002411<br>
with valve housing 14 and filter unit 18 as well as an<br>
oil separator 10 according to the invention. Compressed<br>
air is fed to the air treatment system 12 from a<br>
compressed air source 52 via the oil separator 10. The<br>
purified and dried compressed air can then be fed to<br>
compressed air users 50. In order to extract<br>
contaminants which have collected in the oil<br>
separator 10 from said oil separator 10, a line 72 is<br>
provided via which the outlet 44 of the oil<br>
separator 10 is coupled to a venting means 74 of the<br>
air treatment system 12. The coupling is carried out<br>
via a valve 7 6, which can be configured, for example,<br>
as a 2/2 way valve. In order to extract the<br>
contaminants from the oil separator 12, a valve 78<br>
which is arranged in the user line and which can also<br>
be configured as a 2/2 way valve is closed. This<br>
valve 7 8 can also be arranged inside the air treatment<br>
system 12. The valve 76 can then be opened so that the<br>
contaminants can be expelled from the oil separator via<br>
the venting means 74 by means of the compressed air<br>
which is supplied by the compressed air source 52. This<br>
venting means 7 4 is preferably the same venting means<br>
which is also used for the purpose of regenerating the<br>
filter unit 18.<br>
The features of the invention which are disclosed in<br>
the description above, in the drawings and in the<br>
claims can be essential to the implementation of the<br>
invention either individually or in any desired<br>
combination.<br><br>
