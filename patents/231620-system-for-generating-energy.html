				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a system for generating energy, primarily with the aid of sea currents, and comprising a rotation body having a front inlet side and a rear outlet side, and at least one transfer member connecting the inlet side with the generator.<br>
The prior art methods and systems intended to generate energy with the aid of i.e. seawater have turned out to require high costs. Also, their efficiency has been low inter alia because the energy generated with use of those systems has often been insufficient with regard.to the investment costs.<br>
The object of the present invention is to establish a system for generating energy with the aid of, primarily, seawater current. It comprises a rotation body allowing production of significantly more energy than the amount previously possible to create. Thanks to the flexibility of ' this system it can' be located in such places in the sea where the sea currents are strongest. The features characterizing the invention are set out" in the claims.<br>
Thanks to the invention there has now been provided a system which in an excellent way satisfies the purposes. Also, it can be manufactured conveniently and at a relatively low cost. According to the invention the system comprises a rotation body which constitutes the core of the invention and which is brought to rotate by the sea currents in which the system is localized.<br>
The rotation of the rotation body can be optimized by adjustment of the angles of the blades which are oriented around the waist portion of the rotation body. The rotation body is retained in its level in the sea with the aid of transfer members which also transfer the rotation movement to a generator. Due to the spe-<br><br>
cial shape of the rotation body Very high efficiency is obtained<br>
relating to the conversion of slow flows consisting of a large<br>
water volume. The transfer of the rotation of energy from the<br>
rotation body takes place by means of the transfer member to a<br>
generator, either for direct transfer of generated electric energy<br>
or for storing of that energy. The system includes a pump<br>
or a compressor which keeps the rotation body in the correct<br>
power generation position in combination with the blades on the<br>
circumference of the body. Said pump or compressor is used to<br>
adjust the degree to which the rotation body is filled with i.e.<br>
water which does per se influence the rotation position of the<br>
body in the sea. In order to eliminate the friction of the fluid<br>
which is inside the rotation body and determine its filling degree<br>
the inner side of the rotation body is provided with internally<br>
oriented blades which cause the fluid inside to rotate together<br>
with the rotation body instead of creating a friction<br>
against its inner walls. This arrangement means that the blades<br>
do also function as ribs making all of the rotation body more<br>
rigid.<br>
Some preferred embodiments of the invention are described below<br>
with reference to the drawings.<br>

to which the rotation body does around its waist<br>
portion exhibit a truncated conical body, the oblique<br>
lateral surfaces which converge towards the waist<br>
portion and emerge therein via blades or wings around<br>
the waist portion which are located at a predetermined<br>
distance from each other,<br>
Fig. 13 is an end view of the rotation body showed in fig.<br>
12,<br>
Fig. 14 does diagrammatically show a rotation body according<br>
to the invention and illustrates how the currents are<br>
concentrated.<br>
As appears from the drawing figures the invention is constituted<br>
by a system 1 for producing energy with the aid of, primarily,<br>
sea currents and comprising a rotation body 4 having a front<br>
inlet side 2 and a rear outlet side 3 as well as at least one<br>
transfer member 6 connecting the inlet side 2 with a generator<br>
5. The transfer member 6 can be constituted by either a flexible<br>
or a rigid shaft.<br>
The rotation body 4 exhibits a tapered portion 8 extending from<br>
a substantially cylindrical waist portion 7 towards the inlet<br>
side 2 and being conical and/or bulb-shaped. The different<br>
shapes of the rotation body 4 at the inlet side 2 and at the<br>
outlet side 3, respectively, are shown more in detail in figs. 8<br>
and 9. The bulb shape, the tunnel shape as well as the axial and<br>
radial location of the blades making the body 4 to rotate are<br>
designed to match the factors determined by the average flow,<br>
the average temperature and the salt content and which have been<br>
individually calculated for each selected mounting position. At<br>
the rotation body 4 the streams are concentrated to its outer<br>
diameter after which they converge to their original shape. For<br>
that reason the blade height is calculated to match exactly that<br>
fact. Suitable outlet shapes of the rotation body 4 are shown in<br>
fig. B and also in fig. 9. The shapes have been, selected to create<br>
a maximum efficiency in order to match the combined influence<br>
of different density, salt content and current flow speed<br>
various.<br>
The rotation body 4 does around its waist portion 7 exhibit<br>
blades 10 interspaced at different distances and functioning to<br>
maintain the rotation of the rotation body. The free, front end<br>
of the rotation body 4 is connected to the transfer member 6 for<br>
the purpose of transferring a rotation movement to the generator<br>
5. The blades 10 can have adjustable attack angles so that they<br>
can be turned to yield the highest possible output power.<br>
According to an alternative embodiment, more in detail shown in<br>
figs. 12 and 13, the waist portion 4 of the rotation body exhibits<br>
a truncated, conical body 26 supported by blades or wings<br>
10. Its converging sides 21, 28 are facing the waist portion 7<br>
so as to create a tunnel-like formation 29 catching the sea currents<br>
and directing towards the blades 10 through the intermediate<br>
bases 30. According to the preferred embodiment the mounting<br>
angle of the blades 10 can be about 45°. The power obtainable<br>
thanks to the rotation of the rotation body can in that case be<br>
increased by about 30 %.<br>
For the orientation of the rotation body 4 in the sea the latter<br>
comprises a fluid supply member 11, consisting of e.g. a pump or<br>
a compressor, which keeps the body in the correct powerconsuming<br>
position in combination with the above mentioned possibilities<br>
to vary the blade angle at the intensity of the sea<br>
currents. In order further to increase the effectiveness of the<br>
rotation body the latter can be mounted in a nozzle-like casing<br>
12 which could be shaped like a hour-glass and the walls of<br>
which diverge from the tapered center section 13 of the casing<br>
iix which the rotation body is rotatably supported in bearing-s 14<br>
which are secured to the inlet 15 and the outlet 16, respectively,<br>
of the casing 12. According to the embodiment shown casing<br>
12 has a square cross section providing a larger area as<br>
compared with a circular cross section and, consequently, a<br>
maximum flow speed which in its turn to the rotation body 4 imparts<br>
the highest possible rotation movement.<br>
The external wall II of the rotation body 4 does on its inner<br>
surface have blades 18 around the circumference for the purpose<br>
of eliminating the friction generated by a fluid, for example<br>
water, which is present inside the rotation body 4. At the same<br>
time blades 18 serve as ribs which make the outer wall 17 of the<br>
rotation body 4 stiff er. Thanks to this arrangement the water<br>
filling up the interior of the rotation body 4 will participate<br>
in the rotation movement.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates how a system 1 according to the invention can<br>
be designed. In this case system 1 comprises an anchor member 20<br>
which is resting on the sea bottom and from which extends a<br>
chain 21 connected to a float member 22 which in its turn supports<br>
an . accumulator 23 for the purpose of storing energy from<br>
the rotation body 4 via the transfer member 6 and the generator<br>
5 . Connected to the float member 22 is also a cable 24 which<br>
when desired can be used to transport energy to the shore. Another<br>
possibility is to transfer the energy stored in the accumulator<br>
23 to different types of collection ships for continued<br>
transport of the stored energy to the desired destination.<br>
Fig. 2 does diagrammatically show a system 1 according to the<br>
invention in which the rotation body 4 is supported in a sea<br>
current with the aid of an anchoring member 20 provided with a<br>
frame 25. The latter helps to keep the rotation body 4 in a predetermined<br>
position in the sea current. The transfer member is<br>
pivotably connected to frame 25 to which is also connected, a cable<br>
24 for the purpose of transporting energy to land.<br>
Figs. 10 and 11 cio in the system 1 according to the invention<br>
illustrate different connections between the rotation bodies 4<br>
and the float members 22. Fig. 10 illustrates an articulated<br>
power transfer which eliminates influence from the sea waves.<br>
Fig. 11 illustrates a stiff radial connection including an articulated<br>
coupling and an electric current generator 5 installed<br>
inside the rotation body 4. There is also a cable which transports<br>
the energy generated in the generator 5 through the transfer<br>
member 6, in this case constituted by a rigid shaft.<br>
The difference structures above described have made it possible<br>
to create a system including a rotation body the circumferential<br>
speed of which can be increased radially. The low flow and the<br>
great amount of water can be concentrated to an added force at<br>
the circumference.<br>
Fig. 14 does diagrammatically show how the streams get concentrated<br>
to the outer diameter of the rotation body 4, especially<br>
in the waist portion 7 area. Following this the streams are<br>
again united to their original shape. For that reason the blade<br>
size has been calculated to match exactly this fact and there<br>
has been attained an efficiency corresponding to about 15 kW/m2<br>
which is four times more than according to the prior art solutions<br><br><br><br><br><br>
