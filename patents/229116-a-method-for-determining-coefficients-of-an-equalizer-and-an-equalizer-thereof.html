EQUALIZER<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Field<br>
[1001]      The present invention relates generally to wireless communications, and<br>
more specifically to equalizers.<br>
Background<br>
[1002] For Code-Division Multiple-Access (CDMA) systems such as IS-856 (also referred to as High Data Rate (HDR)), cdma2000, and wideband CDMA (W-CDMA) it is desirable to implement a linear equalizer (LE) at the mobile terminal. The LE can mitigate the intersymbol interference (ISI) arising from multipath propagation and imperfect filtering on the forward link from the base station to the mobile terminal. A challenge for implementing a LE is determining the equalizer coefficients. [1003] In the forward link of the HDR system, pilot symbols known to the receiver are transmitted at full power during a predetermined portion and interval of a transmission frame. This is referred to as a time-division-multiplexed (TDM) pilot. The receiver can tune to the pilot symbol interval. The algorithms that adapt the equalizer coefficients to their desired values are often based on the criteria of minimizing mean square error (MMSE) between the known pilot symbols and the equalizer's channel impulse responses of these pilot symbols. Two common examples of adaptive MMSE algorithms are the least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm and the recursive-least-squares (RLS) algorithm.<br>
[1004] In the forward link of the cdma2000 system and the High Speed Packet Data Access (HSPDA) of W-CDMA, however, the pilot symbols are continuously transmitted on a pilot Walsh channel that is orthogonal to the Walsh channels being used for data transmission. This is referred to as a code-division-multiplexed (CDM) pilot. There is no specific interval when the pilot symbols are sent. This makes it difficult to determine the equalizer coefficients in CDM pilot systems. In CDM pilot systems, the convergence and tracking behavior of the LMS and RLS algorithms may suffer relative to TDM pilot systems.<br><br>
[1005]       Thus a need exists for improving the channel impulse response of the equalizer coefficients.<br>
SUMMARY [1006] The LE coefficients for CDM and TDM pilot systems can be determined based upon frequency-domain calculations involving channel impulse responses. For CDM pilot systems, a channel impulse response can be formed at the mobile terminal by suitably filtering and despreading the received baseband signal with respect to the pilot Walsh channel. For TDM pilot systems, the channel impulse response can be determined using well-known estimation techniques during the pilot period. The channel frequency impulse is then determined based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the channel impulse response. The LE coefficients determined based on frequency-domain calculations can then be used to implement the equalizer in either time domain or frequency domain. These techniques can be used to not only reduce ISI but also to reduce intersector interference.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[1013] FIG- 1 is a generalized block diagram illustrating the structure of an exemplary embodiment of a time-domain linear equalizer. The LE structure is a tapped-delay line finite-impulse response (FIR) filter that processes the baseband samples at the receiver of the mobile terminal.<br><br>
[1015] The LE can have Nfa+Nfc+1 taps. Denoting the main (cursor) tap by the index m=0, the equalizer has Nfa anticausal taps (that is, coefficients which multiply the signal samples that come after the cursor sample) and Nfc causal taps (that is, coefficients which multiply signal samples that come before the cursor sample). With continuous time complex baseband received stream r(t)9 the ChipX2 samples can be defined as r[m]-r(mTc/2). The transmitted chipXl stream index can be y[n]. The delay parameter D can be chosen to specify the cursor position, typically based on the channel impulse response, so that, with the proper decimation offset from ChipX2 to ChipXl at the LE output, the detection of the nth transmitted chip is based on the main tap multiplied by the desired ChipX2 received sample. The mth equalizer coefficient is denoted by cm. The output of the LE can be represented as follows:<br><br>
If the communications channel had no ISI, then only the cursor tap would be required to demodulate the frame correctly.<br>
Channel Model<br>
[1016]      The baseband channel model h(t) can be defined to include the effects of<br>
the transmitter filter, multipath channel, and receiver filter. Accounting for the transmitted ChipXl chip stream y[n] and additive noise z(t), the received baseband<br>
signal can be represented as follows:<br><br><br><br>
[1020]      L represents the number of chipX2 samples in the channel impulse response. [1021]      FIG. 2 is a chart illustrating the real and imaginary parts of an exemplary channel impulse response h. [1022]      Based on the channel impulse response h, the chip level timing can be<br>
specified. To determine the chip level timing based on h, the "cursor" is defined. As<br>
shown in FIG. 2, the sample index 13 can be used because it has the largest energy (that IS, r+cr). TWS cursor index is referred to as ZX For a fixed number of LE taps (NFa+NFc+1), the coefficient values would be different for different values of NFa and NFc. The choice of NFa, NFc, and D affect the performance of short equalizers. For linear equalizers, it is common to choose NFa = NFc. ■ [1023] A channel impulse response can be formed at the mobile terminal for CDM pilot systems by suitably filtering and despreading the received baseband signal with respect to the pilot Walsh channel. This vector represents the combined effect of the transmit filtering, receive filtering, and propagation channel. For TDM pilot systems, the channel impulse response can be determined during the pilot period by well known estimation techniques.<br>
Calculation of MMSE LE Based on the Channel Frequency Response [1024]      For a ChipX2 linear equalizer, the channel impulse response is a complex vector h spaced at ChipX2. By taking the Fourier transform (in practice the FFT) of £, the channel frequency response H(f) results. For example, if h is of length sixteen<br><br>
(spanning eight chips) then the vector H can be calculated by a sixteen-point FFT, and hence H is also of length sixteen. The channel frequency response can be represented as follows:<br>
H{f) = FFT(h).	(6)<br>
[1025]      Typically the noise present in the baseband samples operated on by the equalizer can be colored by the fixed receiver filter that precedes the equalizer. [1026]      If the additive noise is assumed as white with power No, the frequency response C(/) of the MMSE adjusted fractionally-spaced linear equalizer can be<br><br>
and can be referred to as the folded spectrum of H(f), H*(f) is a complex conjugate of<br>
the determined channel frequency response, k is integers, T is a chip or symbol period, No is a power of additive noise, and H is the determined channel frequency response at a<br><br><br>
[10291      Given the values for H[m] and the noise power N0, the equalizer frequency<br>
response can be determined by evaluating the above expression for each element of the vector H9 giving an equalizer coefficient vector C.   In this example, the vector is of length sixteen. [1030]      When the denominator is dominated by the noise term at low signal-to-noise<br>
ratio (SNR), the LE response C(f resembles the matched filter H/). At high SNR<br>
when the noise term is negligible, the LE response C(f) resembles the inverse of<br>
H(f), that is, the zero-forcing LE.<br>
[10311      Based on the frequency-domain equalizer vector C(f, the time-domain LE<br>
coefficients can be determined based on the inverse Fourier transform. In practice, an inverse fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) can be used as follows:<br>
c = IFFT(C(f)).	(12)<br>
[1032] These time-domain coefficients can then be applied to the FIR operation as shown in FIG. 1. The time-domain coefficient vector can be truncated to implement the desired number of FIR coefficients.<br>
[1033] The LE output can also be computed in the frequency domain by taking the FFT of the baseband samples, multiplying the result by C(f, and then taking the IFFT to give the time-domain chip channel impulse responses.<br>
Example of Channel Equalization for Sixteen-Point FFT<br>
[1034]      The following example for time-domain channel equalization is based on the<br>
FFT technique. The steps are as follows:<br>
[1035]       (1) Determine channel impulse response A.<br>
[1036]      (2)   Determine the FFT of the channel impulse response to obtain the<br>
remainder of the receiver chain.<br>
[1037]       (3)  Determine the frequency-domain equalizer coefficients C based on H<br>
and No using Equation (7) above.<br>
[1038]       (4) Determine time-domain equalizer coefficients c = IFFT(C) to implement<br>
the equalizer in time domain, or use the frequency domain equalizer coefficients to<br>
implement the equalizer in frequency domain.<br>
[1039]      FIG. 5 illustrates generalized block diagrams for carrying out this operation,<br>
and FIG. 6 illustrates a flow chart for carrying out this operation.   At 602, a pre-<br><br>
processor, or channel estimator, 52 outputs a channel impulse response h, At 604, an FFT circuit 54 converts the channel impulse into the channel frequency response H(f). At 606, an equalizer coefficient calculation circuit 56 converts the channel frequency response to frequency-domain equalizer coefficients C(f) using MMSE techniques. Optionally, at 608, a decision is made whether to implement the equalizer in time domain or frequency domain.<br>
[1040] If the decision is to implement the equalizer in the time domain, at 610, an IFFT circuit 58 converts the frequency-domain equalizer coefficients to time-domain equalizer coefficients c. At 612, a FIR filter 66, such as the one shown in FIG. 1, can convolve the time-domain received samples r[m] with the time-domain equalizer coefficients. At 614, the equalizer passes the time-domain equalized samples to the remainder of the receiver chain.<br>
[1041] If the decision is to implement the equalizer in the frequency domain, at 616, an FFT circuit 60 performs an FFT of the time-domain received samples r[m). At 618, a multiplier circuit 62 multiplies the FFT received samples by the channel frequency response to obtain a product. At 620, an IFFT circuit 66 converts the product to obtain the time-domain equalized samples. At 622, the equalizer passes the time-domain equalized samples to the remainder of the receiver chain.<br>
[1042] FIG. 3 is charts illustrating results of an exemplary channel equalization based on FFT techniques.<br>
[1043] Based on the ChipX2 channel impulse response h (top chart) and time-domain equalizer coefficient c = IFFT (C) (middle chart), the equalized ChipX2 equalized response can be defined as g = conv(c,h). Because the output of the equalizer is sampled at ChipXl, when the equalizer is spaced at ChipX2, the residual ISI is based on the ChipXl impulse response gr = downsample(g). The bottom chart of FIG. 3 shows that the equalized channel impulse response has little ISI. [1044] In the frequency domain, the equalized channel frequency response can be defined as G(f) = C(f)H(f) and the frequency response of the down-sampled equalizer output can be expressed as follows:<br><br><br>
[1045] FIG. 4 is charts illustrating channel frequency response magnitude (top chart), equalizer response magnitude (middle chart), and the down sampled equalizer output magnitude (bottom chart).<br>
[1046] The results shown in FIG. 4 are for simulations at an SNR of 20dB. The equalizer response is similar to the inverse of the channel response. As seen from the y-axis scale of the bottom chart, the down-sampled equalized response is close to flat<br>
Effects from Intersector Interference for the Forward Link in Cellular Systems [1047] Consider a cellular communications system such as a deployment of a version of cdma2000 referred to as cdma2000 IxEV-DV. "Ix" refers to the spreading rate, "EV" refers to an evolution of cdma2000, and "DV" refers to the capability to transmit not only voice but also data at a high data rate over a forward-link dedicated channel.<br>
[1048] On the forward packet data channel, the mobile terminal can receive the transmission from its serving sector base station transceiver system (BTS) as well as interference from transmissions from other sectors. Similar to the IS-856 forward link, there is no soft-handoff for the IxEV-DV forward link packet data channel, and so transmissions from the non-serving sector are interference to the mobile receiver. [1049] The serving sector can be denoted as Sectorl. The two largest interfering sectors can be dented as Sector2 and Sector3. At the mobile terminal, channel impulse responses can be calculated by de-spreading the pilot channels for the serving and non-serving sectors. The channel impulse response of the channel from the serving sector BTS to mobile terminal can be denoted as h}. The channel impulse response of the channel from the strongest interfering sector BTS to mobile terminal cam be denoted as h2. The channel impulse response of the channel from the second strongest interfering<br>
sector BTS to mobile terminal can be denoted as h3. By taking the FFT of these three<br>
channel impulse responses, the following channel frequency responses of the sectors can be expressed as follows:<br>
H1(f) = FFT(hx)<br>
H2(f) = FFT(h2).	(14)<br>
H,(f)~FFT(hz)<br><br>
[1050] The power of the remaining interference terms can be denoted as N0. The frequency response of the MMSE fractionally-spaced linear equalizer for the mobile terminal can then be calculated by the following:<br><br>
where H*j(f) is a complex conjugate of a channel frequency response for a serving sector, k is integers, T is a chip or symbol period, and No is the power of additive noise, Hj is a channel frequency response of the serving sector at a particular frequency , f,k, and T, H2 is a channel frequency response of an interfering sector at a particular frequency /, k9 and T, and H3 is a channel frequency response of another interfering sector at a particular frequency/, k, and T.<br>
[1051] The equalizer frequency response C(f) will tend to be smaller when the folded spectrum of the interfering channels has a higher magnitude. To implement the equalizer in the time-domain, the LE coefficients can be determined based on the inverse Fourier transform as follows:<br>
c = /FiT(C(/)).	(16)<br>
[1052] These techniques can be extended to include a number of interfering sector transmissions. These techniques can also be extended to include a more accurate modeling of the correlation properties of the additive noise term based on the receiver filtering. These techniques can also be applied to multi-antenna mobile terminals, with each antenna having a corresponding equalizer, and the outputs of the equalizers can be combined. Also, each antenna can have a corresponding FFT circuit and MMSE circuit, and the outputs of the MMSE circuits can be combined and then input to a single IFFT.
