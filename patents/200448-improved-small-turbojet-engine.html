This invention relates to an improved small turbojet engine including novel oil<br>
mist lubrication, impingement starting system, fuel control system and direct<br>
engine driven fuel pump and alternator for application in pilotless aircrafts.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Pilotless aircrafts are remotely controlled with short flight duration. Low weight<br>
is a key requirement of these aircraft to enable them to carry higher payload<br>
and achieve as long a range as possible.<br>
Starting system of a small turbojet engine in pilotless aircraft normally uses<br>
&gt;	electric motor which adds weight to the aircraft,<br>
&gt;	air starter requiring additional turbine which is complex to manufacture<br>
and adding to the weight of the aircraft,<br>
&gt;	jet fuel starter which are over designed and too expensive for this<br>
application.<br>
Lubricating systems in such engines use closed loop type wherein pressure<br>
and scavenge pumps are deployed which also add to the weight of the<br>
aircraft.<br>
US Patent 5782079 discloses a miniature liquid fuel turbojet engine wherein<br>
the improvements are directed to injection system and combustion chamber<br>
resulting in high combustion efficiency and satisfactory outlet temperature<br>
factor. This patent does not address issues related to lubrication and starting<br>
systems in such engines.<br>
US Patent 6290024 describes an improved oil mist generating system<br>
wherein air and oil are supplied to a mist generator where air and oil is<br>
combined to form oil mist. The system is characterised in that the oil is<br>
alternately provided from a main oil reservoir and an auxiliary oil reservoir<br>
each of which is provided with a mist generator. It also discloses an oil mist<br>
generator, which includes a heater manifold extending into an oil reservoir<br>
heating both air and oil prior to entry into a mist head in which the air and oil<br><br>
are combined to form an oil mist. These systems if used in pilotless aircraft<br>
would add to the weight of the aircraft due to the extra heater system, oil<br>
reservoir and mist generator.<br>
US Patent 6293263 deals with super charger having a drive portion and an<br>
atomiser for providing a lubricating oil/air mist to the supercharger. An oil /air<br>
mist inlet is formed in the gear case and oil/air mist channels are in<br>
communication with the oil/air mist inlet and the driven gear bearing races.<br>
Such a system is not applicable in pilotless aircraft system. There are too<br>
many rotating parts thereby enhancing the possibilities of system failure and<br>
increased weight.<br>
A few engines available in the market for applications in pilotless aircraft are<br>
given in Table-1. The thrust range varies from 272 kgf to 377 kgf and use<br>
closed loop pressure fed lubrication system. The alternators are driven by the<br>
engine through a gear system.<br>
The prior art in this field demonstrates that there is further scope to minimise<br>
the number of rotating components thereby design systems with less<br>
complexities and achieve overall reduction in weight of the aircraft.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly an improved small turbojet engine has been designed that<br>
comprises the following features:<br>
a)	An oil mist generator system providing mist lubrication for the<br>
bearing system where the mist is being formed by utilising the bleed<br>
air from engine compressor.<br>
b)	An air impingement starting system providing air impingement on<br>
turbine blades through a nozzle to start the engine.<br>
c)	A fuel pump and alternator capable of operating at engine speeds in<br>
the range of 21000 rpm to 32000 rpm.<br>
d)	Microprocessor based fuel control system together with appropriate<br>
fuel dispensing system for precision speed control.<br><br>

comprises air intake, compressor with bleed air, diffuser, combustion<br>
chamber, exhaust diffuser, jet pipe, propulsive nozzle, microprocessor based<br>
Digital Electronic Control Unit, alternator, oil mist lubrication system, ignition<br>
system, air impingement starting system etc.<br>
The invention with its advantages is now illustrated with non-limiting examples<br>
with the reference to the figures 1-5.<br>
Fig.1 represents the small engine of the present invention wherein,<br>
Part no. 1:   the nose bullet   houses an alternator  and a fuel   pump  directly<br>
driven by engine shaft and also a microprocessor based electronic<br>
control unit and a power rectifier unit.<br>
Part no.2: air intake casing supports front bearing assembly on four struts<br>
providing  passage for fuel  lines,  electrical  control  lines  and<br>
lubricating oil mist.<br><br>
Part no.3: compressor assembly comprises four stages of integral bladed<br>
rotors, integral bladed stator casings and a thrust balancing disc<br>
and where bleed air tappings are taken from one of the<br>
compressor stator casings.<br>
Part no.4: diffuser assembly fabricated in aluminium alloy with contoured<br>
annular passage to diffuse compressor outlet air and guide the<br>
flow to the combustor.<br>
Part no.5: combustion chamber assembly is annular straight flow type with<br>
direct fuel injection through atomizers, contained within outer and<br>
inner casings. Flame initialisation is by high energy igniter.<br>
Part no.6: turbine assembly comprises precision cast integral rotor blades<br>
and stator blades of nickel base alloy. Turbine rotor is attached to<br>
drive shaft and the rear shaft extension is being supported on<br>
roller bearing housed inside the exhaust diffuser.<br>
Part no.7: exhaust diffuser consisting of inner and outer casings connected<br>
by three struts forming the annular passage for exhaust gases<br>
leading to the jet pipe. The inner casing supports the rear bearing<br>
and the outer casing is flanged to connect to the jet pipe.<br>
Part no.8: microprocessor based electronic control unit is for starting, speed<br>
modulation In the specified range and shut down. Digital electronic<br>
control unit (DECU) sends digital control signals to stepper motor<br>
to drive the fuel metering valve as per the fuel schedule embedded<br>
in DECU in digital form on a microcontroller chip.<br>
Part no.9: alternator driven directly by the engine. The power control unit of<br>
the alternator is mounted externally on the airframe.<br>
The lubrication system for bearings uses oil mist, generated with bleed air<br>
from compressor.<br>
Fig 2 shows the schematic diagram of the oil mist generator system. Referring<br>
to fig 2, the oil tank (part no.11) is divided into two chambers, namely an oil<br>
chamber (part no.19) and a mist chamber (part no.18) separated by a<br>
separator plate (part no.23). In the mist chamber two mist generators are<br>
assembled.<br><br>
Mist generator comprises a mist tube (part no. 12) and an orifice tube (part<br>
no. 13). The orifice tube (part no. 13) is positioned perpendicular to the<br>
supplied airflow and with the oil orifice axis along airflow direction. One end of<br>
the mist generator is connected to the pressurized air supply (part no. 14) to<br>
generate the mist. The orifice tubes (part no. 13) of mist generators are<br>
communicated to the oil chamber (part no. 19) through an oil tube (part no.24),<br>
a banjo(part no. 20) and an oil filter (part no.21).<br>
Pressurised air is supplied to the mist generator, which creates a venturi<br>
effect in the mist generator. Due to the venturi effect, oil is siphoned through<br>
the orifice tube (part no. 13). Further it mixes with the supplied air and forms<br>
the mist. The generated mist is driven by the drive air (part no. 17) to the<br>
bearings through the mist transfer tubes.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the arrangement of air impingement starting system. In the<br>
present invention, air impingement is exercised through a nozzle (part no.31)<br>
on to the existing turbine rotor (part no. 32), thereby avoiding any additional<br>
components and making the present invention simple.<br>
The engine is started by impinging air from high-pressure air bottles through a<br>
nozzle (part no. 31) on the turbine rotor (part no. 32). The engine reaches a<br>
speed of about 4500 to 6200 rpm. Within this engine speed, the fuel is ignited<br>
by the ignition system and the engine lights up. The engine continues to<br>
accelerate till idle speed. When the engine reaches idle speed the<br>
impingement air supply to the starting system is cut off.<br>
In an embodiment of present invention, plurality of nozzles may be used for<br>
air impingement starting system.<br>
In another embodiment centrifugal compressor may be used instead of axial<br>
compressor and diffuser.<br>
In another embodiment radial turbine may be used instead of axial turbine.<br><br>
In yet another embodiment, oil mist generator may use vortex passage for<br>
bleed air.<br>
Example 1<br>
Performance Test of the Engine<br>
A test bed is designed and commissioned for testing the improved small<br>
turbojet engine. Compressed air from air bottles was used to start the engine<br>
during the tests. The engine started successfully and settled at idling speed.<br>
The engine was instrumented to monitor various performance parameters like<br>
engine speed, compressor exit pressure. Compressor exit temperature, Jet<br>
pipe pressure. Jet pipe temperature. Thrust, Fuel Flow etc and engine health<br>
monitoring parameters like Front Bearing Temperature (FBT), Rear Bearing<br>
Temperature (RBT), Vibration spectrum etc.<br>
Fig 4 presents the performance of the improved small turbojet engine in terms<br>
of thrust vs engine speed obtained during a number of tests.<br>
Example 2<br>
Tests on Lubrication System<br>
In addition to the tests on the improved small turbojet engine, simulated tests<br>
were conducted on the mist lubrication system, on a test rig. Further the<br>
improved small turbojet engine was test flown on an aircraft. Rear Bearing<br>
Temperature (RBT) and Front Bearing Temperature (RBT) are monitored<br>
using thermocouples in all the tests.<br>
Fig 5 presents the trend of RBT and FBT with engine speed obtained during<br>
various tests. Both bearing temperatures are within maximum permissible<br>
temperature limit of the bearings (for RBT around 300°C; for FBT around<br>
170°C).<br>
8<br><br>
The   improved small turbojet engine described in this invention has several<br>
advantages over the prior art. They include:<br>
1.	An oil mist lubrication system, generating the mist using the bleed air<br>
from the compressor, makes it compact, lighter and less expensive<br>
compared to the conventional pressure pump/scavenge pump<br>
lubrication system and also avoids rotating parts.<br>

compressed air directly on the turbine blade, avoids inclusion of a<br>
separate turbine wheel and thereby reducing weight and cost.<br>
3.	Direct driven fuel pump and alternator coupled with axial flow<br>
compressor avoids additional gear system reducing the number of<br>
rotating components.<br>
