TETRAHYDROINDOLONE AND TETRAHYDROINDAZOLONE DERIVATIVES CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of Provisional Application No. 60/656,230, filed February 25, 2005, Provisional Application No. 60/705,715, filed August 4, 2005, and Provisional Application No. 60/727,965, filed October 18, 2005.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to benzene, pyridine, and pyridazine derivatives and more specifically to such compounds that are useful in the treatment and/or prevention of diseases and/or conditions related to cell proliferation, such as cancer, inflammation and inflammation-associated disorders, and conditions associated with angiogenesis. Compounds of the invention are also useful in the treatment and/or prevention of infectious diseasaes, in particular, fungal infections.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Cancer is characterized by abnormal cellular proliferation. Cancer cells exhibit a number of properties that make them dangerous to the host, typically including an ability to invade other tissues and to induce capillary ingrowth, which assures that the proliferating cancer cells have an adequate supply of blood. A hallmark of cancerous cells is their abnormal response to control mechanisms that regulate cell division in normal cells and continue to divide until they ultimately kill the host,<br>
Angiogenesis is a highly regulated process under normal conditions, however many diseases are driven by persistent unregulated angiogenesis. Unregulated angiogenesis may either<br><br>
WO 2006/091963	PCT/US2006/006988<br>
cause a particular disease directly or exacerbate an existing pathological condition. For example, ocular neovascularization has not only been implicated as the most common cause of blindness, but also is believed the dominant cause of many eye diseases. Further, in certain existing conditions, for example arthritis, newly formed capillary blood vessels invade the joints and destroy cartilage, or in the case of diabetes, new capillaries formed in the retina invade the vitreous, bleed, and cause blindness. Growth and metastasis of solid tumors are also dependent on angiogenesis (Folkman, J., Cancer Research, 46, 467-473 (1986), Folkman, J., Journal of the National Cancer Institute, 82, 4-6 (1989). It has been shown, for example, that tumors which enlarge to greater than 2 mm must obtain their own blood supply and do so by inducing the growth of new capillary blood vessels. Once these new blood vessels become embedded in the tumor, they provide a means for tumor cells to enter the circulation and metastasize to distant sites such as liver, lung or bone (Weidner, N., et al., The New England Journal of Medicine, 324(1), 1-8 (1991). Under conditions of unregulated angiogenesis, therapeutic methods designed to control, repress, and/or inhibit angiogenesis could lead to the abrogation or mitigation of these conditions and diseases.<br>
Inflammation is related to a variety of disorders such as pain, headaches, fever, arthritis, asthma, bronchitis, menstrual cramps, tendonitis, bursitis, psoriasis, eczema, burns, dermatitis, inflammatory bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, gastritis, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, vascular diseases, Hodgkin's disease, sclerodoma, rheumatic fever, type I diabetes, myasthenia gravis, sarcoidosis, nephrotic syndrome, Behcet's syndrome, polymyositis, hypersensitivity, conjunctivitis, gingivitis, post-injury swelling, myocardial ischemia, and the like.<br>

Heat-shock protein 90 (HSP-90) is a cellular chaperone protein required for the activation of several eukaryotic protein kinases, including the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK4. Geldanamycin, an inhibitor of the protein-refolding activity of HSP-90, has been shown to have antiproliferative and antitumor activities.<br>
HSP-90 is a molecular chaperone that guides the normal folding, intracellular disposition and proteolytic turnover of many key regulators of cell growth and survival. Its function is subverted during oncogenesis to make malignant transformation possible and to facilitate rapid somatic evolution, and to allow mutant proteins to retain or even gain function. Inhibition of HSP-90 will slow those process thus has potential therapeutic use (Whitesell L, Lindquist, SL, Nature Rev. Cancer, 2005, 10, 761-72).<br>
Ansamycin antibiotics, e.g., herbimycin A (HA), geldanamycin (GM) , and 17-allylaminogeldanamycin (17-AAG) are thought to exert their anticancerous effects by tight binding of the N-terminus pocket of HSP-90, thereby destabilizing substrates that normally interact with HSP-90 (Stebbins, C. et al. Cell 1997, 89, 239-250). This pocket is highly conserved and has weak homology to the ATP-binding siteof DNA gyrase (Stebbins, C. et al., supra ; Grenert, J. P. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 1997,272,23843-50).<br>
In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that occupancy of this N-terminal pocket by ansamycins and other HSP-90 inhibitors alters HSP-90 function and inhibits protein folding. At high concentrations, ansamycins and other HSP-90 inhibitors have been shown to prevent binding of protein substrates to HSP-90 (Scheibel, T. H. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1999, 96, 1297-302; Schulte, T. W. et al.J. Biol. Chem. 1995,270,24585-8 ; Whitesell, L., et al. Proc. Natl.Acad. Sci. USA 1994, 91, 8324-8328). Ansamycins have also been demonstrated to inhibit the ATP-dependent release of<br>
-3-<br><br>
WO 2006/091963	PCT/US2006/006988<br>
chaperone-associated protein substrates (Schneider, C. L. et al. Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 1996, 93, 14536-41; Sepp-Lorenzinoet al. J. Biol Chem. 1995,270,16580-16587). In either event, the substrates are degraded by a ubiquitin- dependent process in the proteasome (Schneider, C. L., supra;Sepp-Lorenzino, L., et al. J. Biol.Claim. 1995,270, 16580-16587; Whitesell, L. et al. Proc. Natl.Acad. Sci. USA 1994, 91, 8324-8328). HSP-90 substrate destabilization occurs in tumor and non-trans formed cells alike and has been shown to be especially effective on a subset of signaling regulators, e.g., Raf (Schulte, T. W. et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997, 239, 655-9 Schulte, T. W., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1995,270, 24585-8), nuclear steroid receptors(Segnitz, B.; U. Gehring J. Biol. Chem. 1997, 272, 18694-18701; Smith, D. F. et al. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995,15, 6804-12), v-Src (Whitesell, L., et al. Proc. Natl.Acad. Sci. USA 1994, 91, 8324-8328) and certain transmembrane tyrosine kinases (Sepp-Lorenzino,L. et al. J. Biol.Chez. 1995,270, 16580-16587) such as EGF receptor (EGFR) and HER2/Neu(Hartmann, F., et al. Int. J. Cancer 1997,70, 221-9; Miller, P. et al.CancerRes. 1994,54, 2724-2730; Mimnaugh, E. G., et al.J.Biol. Clzem. 1996,271, 22796-801; Schnur, R. et al. J. Med.Chenu. 1995, 38,3806-3812), CDK4, and mutant p53. Erlichman et al. Proc. AACR 2001, 42, abstract 4474. The ansantycin-induced loss of these proteins leads to the selective disruption of certain regulatory pathways and results in growth arrest at specific phases of the cell cycle (Muise-Heimericks, R. C. et al. J. Biol. Chez. 1998, 273, 29864-72), and apoptosis, and/or differentiation of cells so treated (Vasilevskaya, A. et al. CancerRes., 1999,59, 3935-40). Inhibitors of HSP-90 thus hold great promise for the treatment and/or prevention of many types of cancers and proliferative disorders, and also hold promise as traditional antibiotics.<br>

WO 2006/091963	PCT/US2006/006988<br>
Inhibition of HSP-90 is also known to result in up regulation of the expression of the chaperone HSP70. HSP70 up regulation is considered to be of therapeutic benefit for treatment of a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases including, but not limited to: Alzheimer's disease; Parkinson's disease; Dementia with Lewy bodies; Amyotropic lateral scleriosis (ALS); Polyglutamine disease; Huntington's disease; Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA); and Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1-3,7). Therefore, the compounds described in the invention are of potential therapeutic use for treatment of such neurodegenerative diseases (Muchowski, P.J., Wacker J.L., Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005, 6, 11-22.; Shen H.Y., et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2005, 280, 39962-9).<br>
Inhibition of HSP-90 also has anti-fungal activity, both as a stand alone therapy and in combination with standard anti-fungal therapies such as the azole class of drugs. Therefore, the compounds described in the invention are of potential therapeutic use for treatment of fungal infections including, but not limited to, life threatening systemic fungal infections (Cowen, L.E., Lindquist, S., Science 2005, 309, 2185-9).<br>
Inhibition of HSP-90 also has antimalarial activity; thus, inhibitors of this protein are useful as antimalarial drugs.<br>
Therefore, there is a continuing need in the art for new methods of treating cancer, inflammation and inflammation-associated disorders, and conditions or diseases related to uncontrolled angiogenesis.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In Formula I, R3 and R4 are, as noted above, independently<br>
(a) hydrogen, (b) halo, or (c) an alkyl group having from 1-15<br>
carbon atoms. All, but no more than about six, of the carbon<br>
atoms in the alkyl group may be replaced independently by the<br>
various groups listed above in connection with Formula I.<br>
Thus, when the alkyl group is methyl, i.e., a one carbon atom alkyl group, replacement of that carbon atom with, for example, nitrogen or sulfur, the resulting group will not be an alkyl group but instead will be an amino or thio group, respectively. Similarly, when the carbon atom being replaced terminates the alkyl group, the terminal group will become another moiety such as pyrimidinyl, amino, phenyl, or hydroxy.<br>
Replacement of a carbon atom with a group such as, for example, oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur will require appropriate adjustment of the number of hydrogens or other atoms required to satisfy the replacing atom's valency. Thus, when the replacement is N or 0, the number of groups attached to the atom being replaced will be reduced by one or two to satisfy the valency of the nitrogen or oxygen respectively. Similar considerations will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art with respect to replacement by ethenyl and ethynyl.<br>
Thus, replacement as permitted herein results in the term "C1-C15 alkyl" as defined in connection with Formula I encompassing groups such as, but not limited to:<br>
amino, hydroxy, phenyl, benzyl, propylaminoethoxy, butoxyethylamino, pyrid-2-ylpropyl, diethylaminomethyl, pentylsulfonyl, methylsulfonamidoethyl, 3-[4-(butylpyrimidin-2-yl)ethyl]phenyl, butoxy, dimethylamino, 4-(2-(benzylamino)ethyl)pyridyl, but-2-enylamino, 4-(l-(methylamino)pent-3-en-2-ylthio)phenyl, 2-(N-methyl-hexanamido)ethoxy)methyl, and 4-(((3-methoxy-4-(4-methyl-lH-imidazol-2-yl)but-l-enyl) (methyl)amino)-methyl)phenyl.<br>

analogs. The compounds of this invention can also be administered by a transdermal device. Preferably topical administration will be accomplished using a patch either of the reservoir and porous membrane type or of a solid matrix variety. In either case, the active agent is delivered continuously from the reservoir or microcapsules through a membrane into the active agent permeable adhesive, which is in contact with the skin or mucosa of the recipient. If the active agent is absorbed through the skin, a controlled and predetermined flow of the active agent is administered to the recipient. In the case of microcapsules, the encapsulating agent may also function as the membrane. The transdermal patch may include the compound in a suitable solvent system with an adhesive system, such as an acrylic emulsion, and a polyester patch. The oily phase of the emulsions of this invention may be constituted from known ingredients in a known manner. While the phase may comprise merely an emulsifier, it may comprise a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabilizer. It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat. Together, the emulsifier (s) with or without stabilizer(s) make-up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations. Eraulsifiers and emulsion stabilizers suitable for use in the formulation of the present invention include Tween 60, Span 80, cetostearyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl monostearate, and sodium lauryl sulfate, among others. The choice of suitable oils or fats for the formulation is based on achieving the desired cosmetic properties, since the solubility of the active compound in most oils likely to be used in pharmaceutical emulsion formulations is very low. Thus, the cream should<br>

Biological Evaluation<br>
Example 4 8<br>
Cell Proliferation Assays<br>
A panel of cancer cell lines was obtained from the DCTP Tumor Repository, National Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD) or ATCC (Rockville, MD). Cell cultures were maintained in Hyclone RPMI 1640 medium (Logan, UT) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 20 mM HEPES buffer, final pH 7.2, at 37 oC with a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cultures were maintained at sub-confluent densities. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells<br>
-182-<br><br>
WO 2006/091963	PCT/US2006/006988<br>
(HUVEC) were purchased from Clonetics, a division of Cambrex<br>
(Walkersville, MD). Cultures were established from<br>
cryopreserved stocks using Clonetics EGM-2 medium supplemented<br>
with 20 mM HEPES, final pH 7.2, at 37 °C with a 5% CO2<br>
atmosphere.<br>
For proliferation assays, cells were seeded with the appropriate medium into 96 well plates at 1,000-2,500 cells per well, depending on the cell line, and were incubated overnight. The following day, test compound, DMSO solution (negative control), or Actinomycin D (positive control) was added to the appropriate wells as lOx concentrated stocks prepared in phosphate buffered saline. The cell plates were then incubated for an additional 2-5 days, depending on the cell line, to allow proliferation to occur. To measure cell density, 50 JJ.L of WST-1 solution (Roche Applied Science, IN) diluted 1:5 in phosphate buffered saline was added to each well, and the cells incubated for an additional 1-5 hrs., again depending on the cell line. Optical density was determined for each well at 450 nM using a Tecan GeniosPro plate reader (RTP, NC). The percentage of cell growth was determined by comparing the cell growth in the presence of test compounds to the cells treated with DMSO vehicle (control, 100% growth) and cells treated with Actinomycin D (10 nM, 0% growth).<br>
Immediately after the WST-1 determination, the medium was removed from the PC-3, NCI-H460 and HUVEC cell lines, and the plates stored at -80°C. Using these assay plates, relative amounts of DNA in each well were determined using the Cyquant DNA assay kit from R&amp;D Systems (Eugene, OR) following the manufacturer's directions. Results for each compound treatment were compared to DMSO vehicle control (100%) and 10 JJM Actinomycin D treated cells (0%).<br>

Determination of Affinity for HSP-90<br>
(Heat Shock Protein 90)<br>
Affinity of test compounds for HSP-90 was determined as follows: Protein mixtures obtained from a variety of organ tissues (for example: spleen, liver and lung) were reversibly bound to a purine affinity column to capture purine-binding proteins, especially HSP-90. The purine affinity column was washed several times, and then eluted with 20M, 100 M, and 500 M of test compound. Compounds of Formula I elute HP-90<br>

PCT/US2006/006988<br><br>
in a dose-dependent manner vs. a control elution using dimethylsulfoxide. The elution profile of Formula I compounds was determined by 1-dimensional SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were stained with a fluorescent stain such as sypro ruby (a highly sensitive fluorescent protein stain that can readily detect less than 1 fmol of total protein, i.e., less than 0.04ng for a 40kDa protein) or silver nitrate. The gels were imaged using a standard flat bed gel imager and the amount of protein estimated by densitometry. The percent of HSP-90 protein eluted from the column at each concentration was determined and IC50 values were calculated from these estimates. The identity of a band containing HSP-90 was determined by protein sequencing using mass spectroscopy.<br>
