				<td>DISTRIBUTING  ELEMENT  FOR   ELECTROLYTE  PERCOLATION<br>
ELECTROCHEMICAL CELL<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Many industrial processes are carried out in electrochemical cells, such as<br>
chlor-alkali electrolysis for the production of chlorine gas and caustic soda<br>
or potash, water electrolysis primarily for the production of hydrogen, salt<br>
electrolysis to obtain the corresponding bases and acids, e.g. caustic soda<br>
and sulphuric acid from sodium sulphate, metal plating, among which<br>
principally copper and zinc. The congenital problem of all these process is<br>
the electric energy consumption, usually accounting for a substantial part<br>
of the total production cost. As the cost of electric energy shows a constant<br>
tendency to increase in all geographic areas, the importance of<br>
decreasing the electric energy consumption in the above indicated<br>
electrochemical processes is apparent.<br>
The energy consumption of an electrochemical process primarily depends<br>
from cell voltage: the reason for the efforts directed to the improvement of<br>
ceil design is therefore immediately evident, with the use of more catalytic<br>
electrodes and the reduction of the ohmic drops in the structure of the cell<br>
itself and in the electrolytes, for instance by decreasing the interelectrodic<br>
gap.<br>
Reference will be mainly made hereafter to the chlor-alkali electrolysis<br>
process which undoubtedly holds a major industrial relevance, but it is<br>
understood that anything that will be discussed as state of the art and as<br>
improvement according to the indications of the present invention is<br>
definitely applicable also to the other electrochemical processes.<br>
In the case of the conventional chlor-alkali process, a solution of sodium<br>
chloride, or less frequently potassium chloride, is supplied to a cell<br>
containing an anode, where chlorine gas is evolved, while at the cathode<br>
hydrogen is evolved with simultaneous formation of sodium hydroxide<br>
(caustic soda - potassium hydroxide, in case potassium chloride is<br>
supplied). In the most advanced kind of cell, the caustic soda present near<br>
the cathode is kept apart from the sodium chloride solution present in the<br>
anodic  zone  by  means  of  a  cationic  membrane  consisting  of  a<br><br>
perfluorinated polymer containing anionic groups, for example sulphonic<br>
and/or carboxylic groups.   Such membranes are commercialised by<br>
several  companies,  e.g.  DuPont/USA,  Asahi  Glass  and  Asahi<br>
Chemicals/Japan. As concerns this type of configuration, which is already<br>
very  interesting  under  the  energy  consumption  standpoint,  many<br>
alternative proposals have however already been  made,  having  in<br>
common the use of a gas diffusion electrode, specifically a cathode fed<br>
with pure oxygen or with an oxygen-containing mixture, by means of which<br>
the hydrogen evolution reaction is suppressed and oxygen reduction to<br>
water is accomplished in its place. The process is thereby depolarised, that<br>
is the electrolytic voltage is diminished to a significant extent. In the<br>
practice,  it is observed that the voltage of a conventional cationic<br>
membrane cell supplied with a current density of 4 kA/m2 is about 3 Volts,<br>
while that of a cell equipped with cationic membrane and oxygen cathode,<br>
working in the same operating conditions, is about 2-2.2 Volts. As it is<br>
apparent, an electric energy saving around 30% is achieved (the missed<br>
production of hydrogen, normally employed as fuel, is of secondary<br>
importance).<br>
The use of gas electrodes for depolarising the electrochemical processes<br>
is obviously not limited to the use of cathodes for chlor-alkali electrolysis;<br>
processes are known, for example, for neutral salt splitting in the<br>
correspondent acid and base, particularly for the disposal of salts obtained<br>
as by-product of chemical processes, which make use of hydrogen-fed gas<br>
diffusion anodes, allowing the suppression of the oxygen evolution<br>
reaction. One embodiment of such kind is disclosed in US Patent<br>
5,595,641. The use of gas diffusion electrodes for electrochemical<br>
applications is on the other hand neither limited to electrolytic processes in<br>
general, as it will suffice to mention their widespread use by now in the<br>
field of fuel cells. The difficult industrialisation of the electrochemical<br>
processes comprising gas diffusion electrodes is however perfectly<br>
exemplified by the case of chlor-alkali electrolysis, wherein the delicate<br>
structure of the cathode, consisting of a conductive porous support<br>
whereto a macroporous layer formed by an assembly of electrocatalytic<br>
particles mechanically stabilised by a binder is applied, is installed in big<br><br>
size or relatively tall cells, crossed by an upward flow of high density<br>
electrolyte. As a consequence, the resulting hydraulic head poses serious<br>
problems of flooding and thus of access of the oxygen to the catalytic sites.<br>
To be able to operate in these conditions with big size cells (indicatively of<br>
height exceeding 25-30 cm) it is therefore necessary to introduce devices<br>
allowing to break the hydraulic head associated to the liquid column.<br>
Among the different solutions proposed in the past, the only one which<br>
seems to solve the problem in an effective and economically viable<br>
manner consists of feeding a downward liquid flow through a percolator,<br>
for instance according to the disclosure in the International Patent<br>
Application WO 01/57290, entirely incorporated herein as reference. The<br>
percolator described in the aforementioned patent application consists of a<br>
planar porous element, contacting on one side the active surface of the<br>
gas diffusion electrode and on the other side the ion-exchange membrane,<br>
crossed by the electrolyte falling under the action of gravity; the percolator<br>
is designed so as to impose a controlled pressure drop to the falling<br>
electrolyte column, so that a resulting operative pressure not sufficient to<br>
flood the electrode is exerted on every point of the same. This solution,<br>
effective in principle, presents however some constructive problems, not<br>
discussed in the cited patent application. In particular, the simultaneous<br>
downward distribution of the electrolyte to the percolator and of oxygen to<br>
the gas diffusion cathode, also preferably from top to bottom, is not<br>
straightforward. The commonly adopted solution for feeding fluids in the<br>
conventional electrolysers with filter-press geometry, such as membrane<br>
chlor-alkali electrolysers, provides the use of internal distribution pipes<br>
placed in parallel to the cell walls. In the case of electrolysers provided with<br>
gas diffusion electrodes, the simultaneous feed of electrolyte and oxygen<br>
creates a twofold problem: on one hand the bulk of the two distribution<br>
pipes must be taken into account, on the other hand it is necessary to<br>
ensure the separation of the fluids in the region where the electrolyte<br>
distribution  pipe  crosses the gas  diffusion  electrode to  reach  the<br>
percolator, a point in which the sealing is rather critical. The problem of the<br>
design of a cell with percolator and gas diffusion electrode is even more<br>
serious in case it is required to adapt this novel technology to pre-existing<br><br>
membrane cells, conceived for the conventional non depolarised process.<br>
In this case, the cell has only one feeding duct to the cathode<br>
compartment, and the separate feeding of two fluids (electrolyte and<br>
oxygen) results nearly always impossible. The possibility of modifying a<br>
pre-existing cell so as to adapt it to the energetically more favourable<br>
depolarised process thus remains a very considered need in the field of<br>
chlorine and soda industrial production.<br>
Under a first aspect, it is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
distributing element for feeding an electrolyte in an electrochemical cell<br>
provided with percolator and gas diffusion electrode, overcoming the<br>
limitations of the prior art.<br>
Under another aspect, it is an object of the present invention to provide an<br>
assembly comprising a distributing element for feeding an electrolyte in an<br>
electrochemical celt which includes a percolator and a gas diffusion<br>
electrode, suitable to be inserted in a membrane electrochemical cell.<br>
Under a further aspect, it is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
method which permits to modify a membrane electrochemical cell of<br>
conventional design through the insertion of a distributing element<br>
comprising a percolator and a gas diffusion electrode.<br>
Under a first aspect, the invention consists of a distributing element for an<br>
electrochemical cell, comprising an external feeding manifold, placed<br>
outside the external sealing flange of the cell, and an internal part in its<br>
turn comprising a gas diffusion electrode and a planar frame delimiting a<br>
percolator. Preferably, the percolator is inserted in a recess obtained in the<br>
planar frame. In one preferred embodiment, the distributing element of the<br>
invention comprises an upper external manifold for feeding the electrolyte,<br>
and a lower external manifold for discharging the same. The distributing<br>
element preferably comprises a sealing system toward the cell flange, for<br>
instance a set of planar gaskets. In one preferred embodiment, the<br>
element of the invention also comprises an ion-exchange membrane in<br>
contact with the surface of the percolator opposed to the one contacting<br>
the gas diffusion electrode. Any porous element, preferably having a<br>
planar geometry, suited to be crossed under the action of gravity by the<br>
downward electrolyte flow with a controlled pressure drop, can be used as<br><br>
the percolator. The percolator may thus consist of a plastic or metallic<br>
foam, of a planar mesh formed by the overlapping of planes of interwoven<br>
wires, of a profiled mesh, of a mattress formed by coils of wires, of an<br>
expanded sheet, of a  sintered body,  or again of combinations or<br>
juxtapositions of two or more of such elements. In general, the percolator<br>
preferably has hydrophobic characteristics, but also hydrophilic percolators<br>
are suited to the scope. The gas diffusion electrode may be a cathode<br>
supplied with a flow of oxygen, pure or in admixture, for instance as air or<br>
enriched air, or it may be an anode supplied with a hydrogen flow. In<br>
general, it is preferable that the distribution element be designed so as to<br>
allow the gas flow supplying the gas diffusion electrode to be directed<br>
downwards. The distributing element of the invention may be employed<br>
also in fuel cells, resulting particularly advantageous especially in the case<br>
of fuel cells with alkaline electrolyte, which has to be continuously<br>
recirculated as known to the experts of such field. To achieve such<br>
recirculation, the use of a percolator is particularly apt. In the case of<br>
alkaline fuel cells, the distributing element of the invention typically<br>
comprises two gas diffusion electrodes, one cathode fed with oxygen or air<br>
and one anode fed with a hydrogen-containing mixture, preferably with<br>
pure hydrogen, while the circulating electrolyte is a concentrated alkaline<br>
solution, preferably caustic potash. One of the two gas diffusion electrodes<br>
is in this case positioned, in its turn, in contact with the other face of the<br>
percolator, with a porous diaphragm or ion-exchange membrane optionally<br>
interposed therebetween.<br>
Under a second aspect, the invention is directed to an electrochemical cell<br>
comprising a distributing element according to the previous description.<br>
The cell of the invention may be a cell for chlor-alkali electrolysis, for<br>
example a cell for chlorine/caustic soda electrolysis provided with an<br>
oxygen-fed gas diffusion cathode; the cell may as well be a cell for the<br>
electrolysis of neutral salts, and be for instance provided with a hydrogen-<br>
fed gas diffusion anode, or again an alkaline fuel cell provided with gas<br>
diffusion anode and cathode respectively fed with hydrogen and oxygen. In<br>
the case of electrolytic cells, the counterelectrode usually consists of a<br>
metallic porous element, for instance a mesh, a perforated or expanded<br><br>
sheet or other, and is preferably provided with a catalytic coating. In the<br>
case of a chlor-alkali cell, the catalytic coating serves to catalyse the<br>
evolution of chlorine. The gas diffusion cathode, the percolator and the ion-<br>
exchange membrane must be preferably pressed together, for example<br>
under the action of a pressure differential imparted between the anodic<br>
and the cathodic compartment of the cell, or by means of a mechanical<br>
element exerting a compression. A particularly suitable mechanical<br>
element consists for instance of an overlap of compressible and resilient<br>
layers formed by metal wires, for instance as described in the Italian<br>
Patent Application MI2001A 002538, inserted between the gas diffusion<br>
cathode and a cathodic mesh, or directly between the gas diffusion<br>
electrode and the cathodic wall of the cell; other mechanical elements, for<br>
example combinations of springs, are however equally suited to the scope.<br>
The cell of the invention is particularly suited to be employed in stacked<br>
structures according to a filter-press arrangement, for instance as modular<br>
element of electrolysers.<br>
Under a further aspect, the invention consists of a method for retrofitting a<br>
membrane electrolytic cell of the prior art, provided with an ion-exchange<br>
membrane and with metallic gas evolving electrodes. According to one<br>
preferred embodiment, the method of the invention serves to retrofit a<br>
membrane chlor-alkali cell provided with a hydrogen evolving cathode and<br>
a chlorine evolving anode, so as to allow its utilisation as depolarised<br>
electrolysis cell, comprising an oxygen-fed gas diffusion cathode, suitable<br>
to suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction. The method consists of<br>
opening the original cell, removing the membrane and inserting the<br>
distributing element of the invention between the anodic and cathodic<br>
flange of the cell itself; along with the distributing element of the invention,<br>
it is preferable to insert also an elastic mechanical element capable of<br>
exerting a compression, for instance the element disclosed in MI2001A<br>
002538, preferably between the gas diffusion cathode and the original<br>
metallic cathode which works, after the modification, as cathode current<br>
collector.<br>
These and other aspects will be explained making use of the attached<br>
figures, which are provided as a mere exemplification, and which must not<br><br>
be intended as a limitation of the invention, whose domain is solely defined<br>
by the annexed claims.<br>
Figure 1 shows a membrane electrochemical cell according to the prior art.<br>
Figure 2 shows a first embodiment of the distributing element of the<br>
invention.<br>
Figure 3 shows a second embodiment of the distributing element of the<br>
invention.<br>
In figure 1, the perimetrica! section of a generic electrolysis cell is shown,<br>
which for the sake of simplicity will be considered as a chlor-alkali cell; the<br>
cell structure is delimited by two conductive shells, an anodic shell (1), for<br>
instance of titanium, and a cathodic shell (1'), for instance of nickel. In the<br>
figure, planar shells provided with ribs for the transmission of electric<br>
current are shown, but several alternative configurations are possible. The<br>
shells terminate in their upper part with the sealing flanges (2) and (2'); the<br>
same happens in the lower part of the cell, not shown. An ion-exchange<br>
membrane (3) separates the anodic from the cathodic compartment. Inside<br>
the anodic compartment, the anode (4) is shown, which may be for<br>
instance a titanium mesh coated with a noble metal oxide-based catalyst.<br>
Inside the cathodic compartment, the cathode (5) is conversely shown, for<br>
instance a nickel mesh optionally activated with a catalyst. In the figure it is<br>
shown the anode in contact with the membrane and the cathode kept at a<br>
short distance thereto, but both electrodes can also be in contact with the<br>
membrane depending on considerations of ohmic and fluid-dynamic<br>
nature. The cell sealing in the peripheral flange zone is in this case<br>
guaranteed by flat-type gaskets (6), although the use of O-rings or other<br>
sealing elements is obviously possible. The cell is fed with sodium chloride<br>
brine at the anodic compartment, and chlorine evolution occurs on the<br>
anode (4); on the cathodic side, the caustic soda solution which constitutes<br>
the other reaction product is circulated, while hydrogen evolves at the<br>
cathode (5). The feeding and discharge ducts are not shown, but it is<br>
intended that they may be realised in many different ways. In the most<br>
common case, the cell of the figure is coupled to other equivalent in a filter-<br>
press configuration, and the feeding and discharge ducts consist of tubular<br>
elements.<br><br>
Figure 2 shows a cell of the invention, optionally obtained from the prior art<br>
cell of figure 1 by means of the method of the invention: all the distinctive<br>
elements of figure 1 are still present, except the original membrane (3); in<br>
place of the latter, a distributing element is present comprising an upper<br>
external feeding manifold (7), outside the zone of flange, and an internal<br>
part with a planar frame (8) delimiting a percolator (9) and a gas diffusion<br>
cathode (10) in contact with the percolator. In the case of chlor-alkali<br>
electrolysis, a new ion-exchange membrane (3') is present, in contact with<br>
the percolator (9); other applications, that make use of an undivided cell,<br>
omit the presence of this element. In one preferred embodiment, in the<br>
lower part of the cell an external caustic discharge manifold is present, not<br>
shown. The membrane percolator-gas diffusion electrode assembly may<br>
also include the elastic current collector (11) shown in the figure, which<br>
exerts a compression on one side onto the gas diffusion<br>
electrode/percolator/membrane package pushing it all against the anode<br>
(counterelectrode), and on the other side onto the original cathode (5),<br>
which assumes the role of cathode current collector. The elastic current<br>
collector may in other embodiments be omitted, and the electric continuity<br>
with the gas diffusion electrode (10) may be achieved in another way<br>
according to the prior art. In the embodiment of figure 2 the distributing<br>
element comprises also an optional additional gasket (6'), which may be<br>
clearly omitted when the sealing is effected according to alternative<br>
designs known in the art. Figure 2 has been described making reference to<br>
the retrofitting of a pre-existing cell of the prior art according to the method<br>
of the invention, but it is completely evident that this constructive<br>
embodiment is valid also for brand new cells.<br>
In figure 3 an embodiment very similar to that of figure 2 is shown, the<br>
difference being that the terminal part of the planar frame (8) is provided<br>
with a recess to accommodate the peripheral part of the percolator (9); in<br>
an alternative embodiment, such recess may also accommodate the<br>
peripheral part of the gas diffusion electrode (10). In both embodiments of<br>
figures 2 and 3, the circulating electrolyte on the cathode side, that is the<br>
product caustic soda solution, is fed through the upper external manifold<br>
(7) and circulated through the percolator (9) under the action of gravity.<br><br>
The feeding of oxygen to the gas diffusion electrode (10) may for instance<br>
be effected through the pre-existing cathode distribution pipe, not shown.<br>
Although those which are believed to be the best embodiments of the<br>
present invention have been described, it will be evident to the experts in<br>
the art that other variations and modifications may be introduced thereto<br>
without departing from the spirit and scope of the same.<br><br>
