USE OF AN AMPHOTERIC SURFACTANT AS A VISCOSE SPIN BATH ADDITIVE<br>
The present invention relates to a method of reducing the clogging of nozzles and slits and diminishing the formation of deposits in the spin bath system in the process of making viscose filamentary and film materials by using an amphoteric surfactant.<br>
When regenerating cellulose material in an acidic spin bath containing zinc sulphate clogging disturbancies are frequent. The origins of the clogging material are different. One and the most important source are solid byproducts, i.e. elementary sulphur and zinc sulphide, which are formed when the dissolved xanthogenated celluloses are regenerated to cellulose and carbon disulphide. Other examples of by-products are hemicelluloses and resins derived from the cellulosic raw material itself and trans-fered to the spin bath where they cause deposits. One method of reducing these disadvantages is to add cationic surface active compounds to the spinning baths. Thus, in Japanese Patent No. 48006409 it is suggested to add N,N'-polyoxy-ethylene-N-long chain-alkyl alkylene-diamines and N,N',N"-polyoxyethylene-N-long chain-alkyl alkylene-triamines into the spin bath as dispersants for sulphur particles which cause blockages in spinning nozzles. The long-chain alkyl group contains from 10 to 20 carbon atoms. The number of oxyethylene groups are from 1 to 8 for each substitution position and their sum is from 2 to 10. However, this additives have a rather limited ability to disperse sulphur, especially when the amounts thereof is high.<br>
In Japanese Patent Application No. 54101916 it is suggested to add polyoxyethylene alkyl mono- and diamide polyalkylene polyamines to further reduce the clogging of nozzles. Examples of the used polyalkylene polyamines are triethylene tetramine and tetraethylene pentamine. The number of carbon numbers in the fatty acids used for preparing the said compounds is preferably from 12 to 22, while<br><br>
the number of ethylene oxide groups in the molecule is from 6 to 12. Although these polyamines have a good dispersing effect they have a serious drawback since they are not stable in hot acid solutions and are hydrolyzed at high temperature in the spin bath. Consequently, after some time their effect is essentially reduced.<br>
The degradation of the additive can be compensated by addition of higher dosages of the additives. However in practice the resulting products of the hydrolysis, i.e. the fatty acids produced especially during reconditioning of the spin bath enhances the clogging. Together with elementary sulphur and/or zinc sulphide and resins they form black particles, which are very difficult to disperse.<br>
It has now been found that not only the disturbancies of clogging materials in the spin bath are essentially diminished but also the quality of the fibers formed in the spin bath is improved by using an amphoteric surfactant having the formula<br>
RNA ( CnH2nNA ) X.XA      (I) where R represents a hydrogen or an alifatic group with 1-24 carbon atoms, each A represents a hydrogen, an alifatic group with 1-24 carbon atoms, or B00CCmH2m-groups, where rn is a number from 1-3, B is hydrogen or a salt forming cation, n is a number from 2-3, x is 1-8, and the number of BOOCC groups are from 1 to x+2, with the provision that the total number of carbon atoms in the aliphatic groups is from 8 to 45, as a viscose spin bath additive. The amphoteric surfactant has an excellent anticlogging effect, since it is a good dispersant and prevent or reduce precipitation in the spin bath. In addition it has a low foaming and is very stable in comparison with the amide compounds disclosed in JP Patent Application No. 54101916. Since the additive keeps the openings in the spinneret free from clogging materials, the filaments and films formed collect less solid particles, whereby the discolouration is reduced and the fiber or film strenght improved. The maintainance of the spin bath is also simplyfied, since the amphoteric surfactant is stable in<br><br>
ordinary working-up-processes of the spin bath and the spin bath solution can be recirculated after the removal of an excess of the by-products including sodium sulphate obtained in the spin bath. The amount of the amphoteric compound in the spin bath may be varied within wide limits but is normally added in an amount of 0.5-5000 ppm, preferably from 2 to 1500 ppm, to a spin bath containing 5-15% by weight H2S04, 15-30% by weight of Na2S04 and 0-7% by weight of ZnS04.<br>
The amphoteric surfactant with formula I preferably contains one or two aliphatic groups, R and A, with a total of 8 to 40 carbon atoms, preferably from 10 to 36 carbon atoms. Preferably R is a hydrocarbon group with 8-24 carbon atoms, and most preferably 10-22 carbon atoms. B is normally a mono- or divalent, preferably a monovalent cation, m is preferably a number 1 or 2.<br>
Most preferred amphoteric surfactants of the formula I are those having the formula<br><br>
where R, A and x have the meaning mentioned in formula I and Ax is a hydrogen or a group BOOCCJH2 where B and m have the meaning mentioned in formula I. These additives are easy to produce and have excellent dispersing ability. Normally at least 50% of all substituents A and Ax are the group BOOCCmH2m-. The amphoteric surfactant where m is 1 are preferred, since they exhibit low foaming. Low foaming is also supported by the presence of at least one R group with 14-22 carbon atoms. This is of benefit in the sequent treatment of the fiber and film material.<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for regeneration of cellulose from a viscose solution, in which process the viscose solution is brought into contact with a spin bath containing from 0.5 to 5000 ppm of an amphoteric surfactant according to formula I. Preferably the amphoteric surfactant has the formula II. The spin bath has normally a temperature of from 40°C to 60°C and contains in addition to the amphoteric surfactant from 5 to 15% by weight of H2S04/<br><br>
from 15 to 30% by weight of Na2S04 and from 0-7% by weight of ZnS04. The cellulose regenerated may have the form of fibers or films or any other conventional shape.<br>
The invention is further illustrated by the following examples.<br>
Example 1.<br>
Degradation kinetics of two spin bath additives were evaluated in a spin bath with the composition 9,5% H2S04/ 23% Na2S04/ 0,4% ZnS04 and 67,1% H20 at different temperatures stated in the tables below.<br>
One of the additives was an amide condensate of tetraethylene pentamine and a tallow fatty acid ethoxylated with 10 moles ethylene oxide per mol amide, hereinafter referred to as Compound B. Compound B is a typical representative of an additive in the Japanese Patent Application No. 54101916.  The other additive was an oleoampho-polycarboxyglycinate, RNA ( CnH2nNA ) X_XA where R is a C18-hydrocarbon group derived from oleic fatty acid, x is 4, n is 3, and A is the group BOOCC^H^ , where B is a sodium cation and m is 1, hereinafter referred to as Compound 1. It is a typical representative of an amphoteric surfactant according to this invention.<br>
The content of Compound B in the spin bath was analyzed by using the dye Orange II. This dye and the cationic surfactant were reacted and the complex formed was extracted into chloroform. Then the amount of the complex in the chloroform phase was spectrofotometrically determined at a wave length of 488 nm. The amphoteric surfactant, Compound 1, was analyzed by first concentrating the surfactant on a Dionex On Guard-RP column followed by eluation in an aqueous alkaline acetonitrile solution. The concentration of the amphoteric surfactant was then determined by an HPLC method under the following conditions: Column, Hamilton PRP-1; Detection, UV 230 nm; Mobil phase, Gradient of acetonitrile in alkaline water; Flow rate, 1 ml/min. All data are presentated below in Table 1 and 2, respectively.<br>
The figures show the residual non-degraded amount of<br><br><br>
From the results it is evident that the stability in hot spin bath is much lower for the amide type of spin bath additive (Compound B) than for the additive according to the invention (Compound 1).<br>
Examples 2-4.<br>
Precipitation prevention and dispersing capacities of some spin bath additives were determined according to the following procedure.<br>
21 ml of a solution containing 0.25 M Na2S203/ 0.15 M Na2CS3 and 0.25 M Na2S was dropwise added during stirring into a polypropylene vessel containing 1 liter of a spin bath. The spin bath had a composition of 10% H2S04/ 20% Na2S04/ 1% ZnS04 and 69% H20. Its temperature was 50°C The stirrer was made of glass with a propellar of platinum. After the addition the transmittance of the bath was measured after predetermined times in a spectrophotometer at the wave length of 450 nm in a glass cuvette. During the whole test the stirring was kept constant at 300 rpm. After 270<br><br>
minutes the test was interrupted and the weight of the stirrer was measured in order to determine the amount of material precipitated on the stirrer.<br>
The precipitation preventing and dispersing additives were added in different amounts to the spin bath before the start of adding the 21 ml solution to the spin bath solution.<br>
The following additives were used.<br>
Compound A.<br>
A compound having the  formula<br>
(EO)yH<br>
C18-alkyl  N(EO)x-C3H6N<br>
(E0)s H where EO is ethyleneoxy and the sum of x, y and z is 10, in accordance with the amine compounds disclosed in the Japanese Patent No. 48006409.<br>
Compound B.<br>
Same compound as in Example 1.<br>
Compound l.<br>
Same compound as in Example 1.<br>
Compound 2.<br>
Tallowamphopolycarboxyglycinate with the formula I, where R is a tallow fatty alkyl group, x is 4, n is 3 and A is B00CCmH2m-, where B is sodium and m is 1.<br>
Compound 3.<br>
Tallowamphopolycarboxypropionic acid with the formula I, where R, A, n, and x have the same meanings as in Compound 2, and m is 2 and B is hydrogen.<br>
