				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of monosubstituted cycloalkanones. More particularly it relates to the preparation of 2-(4-acetyl amino benzylidene) cycloalkanones having general formula 1 given in the drawing accompanying this specification wherein R = nil, -CH2-, -CHlCH^)-; Rl=carboalkyl group. These precursors of liquid crystalline polymers are useful for non- linear optical application potentials. The precursors prepared by the process of this invention are based on mono substituted cyclohexanones/ cyclopentanones.<br>
The  precursors  are  prepared  from  2-(4-amino benzylidene) cycloalkanones having general formula 2 given in the drawing accompanying  this   specification  wherein R = nil,  -CH^-/ CH(CH3)~. In our copending application number NF-327/96, we have described and claimed a process for the preparation of 2-(4-amino benzylidene) cycloalkanones.<br>
The precursors prepared by the process of this invention can be further reacted under suitable reaction conditions to prepare new mesogens useful for the synthesis of side chain liquid crystalline polymers. The side chain liquid crystalline polymer so prepared is useful for non-linear optical applications.<br>
The need for newer materials for use in non-linear optical application is strongly felt by researchers. The need is desired by those involved in the developmental efforts for optical signaling manipulation, parallel optical image processing systems in the wake of developments in the area of fibre optics. The material development is directed towards materials with non-<br>
linear properties.<br>
Properties that are critical for materials to qualify for nonlinear optical applications include transparency,  thermal, photochemical and chemical stability, dielectric constant etc. Both inorganic and organic salts exhibit non-linear optical properties. Materials that have been extensively used in the area of non-linear optical applications are inorganic salts such as potassium dideuterium phosphate,  lithium nibbate, potassium titanyl phosphate etc. Organic materials offer the advantage of high density packing and specific arrangement of molecules in the crystalline state. While the organic materials offer superior properties in comparison   with inorganic materials,  practical utilization poses several problems. In addition, the development of organic materials which offer superior non-linear optical properties have been hindered because of the low threshold limits of these materials on exposure to strong radiations such as laser beam.<br>
Amongst the various approaches towards development of materials for non-linear optical applications such as crystal growth, growth in confined structures, monolayer assemblies such as the Langmuir-Bludget films and poled polymer systems. The precursors prepared by the process of this invention can be used in the preparation of side chain liquid crystalline polymers for poled polymer systems.<br>
The advantages offered by the poled polymer systems are greater flexibility  in  the  selection  of  mesogenic  arid  polymericstructures and ease of fabrication of devices. The side chain liquid crystalline polymer synthesised using the mesogen as per the process of this invention could be used in poled polymer systems.<br>
Poling of polymers is done by subjecting the polymer usually in the form of a film to an external electric field at an elevated temperature followed by cooling to ambient temperature before the applied external field is removed. During this process the dipolar species in the polymer film would reorient and a net alignment is retained in the film.<br>
For a polymer to be useful for non-linear optical applications, it must satisfy primary optical property requirements. The primary optical property is characterised by the material having substantial transparency to light of desired frequency.<br>
The precursors prepared by the process of this invention can be further reacted under suitable reaction conditions to prepare new mesogens useful for the synthesis of side chain liquid crystalline polymers. The side chain liquid crystalline polymer prepared is useful for non-linear optical applications.<br>
The main object of the present invention is therefore to provide a process for the preparation of monosubstituted cycloalkanones. The monosubstituted cycloalkanones namely, 2-(4-acetyl amino benzylidene) cycloalkanones are reportedly synthesised for the first time by the inventors of the present invention and hence there are no earlier methods known for the preparation of these compounds.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of 2-(4-acetyl aminobenzylidene) cycloalkanones of general formula 1 of the drawing accompanying this specification, which comprises reacting in an inert atmosphere a substituted cycloalkanone with acetic anhydride in an aqueous medium, in the presence of acid, stirring the reaction mixture at a temperature in the range of 35 to 45°C, for a period ranging from 4 to 10 hours, cooling the reaction mixture to room temperature, neutralizing the reaction mixture using alkali metal hydroxide, extracting the mixture with a dipolar aprotic solvent, washing the organic layer using alkali metal bicrbonate, drying the organic part over suitable drying agent at room temperature for 12 to 16 hours, removing the dipolar aprotic solvent under reduced pressure, and separating the product by column chromatography using a suitable eluent mixture to give 2-(4-acetyl) aminobenzylidene cycloalkanones of general formula 1, wherein R=nil, -CH2-, -CH2 (CH3).<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the gas used for inert atmosphere may be such as nitrogen or argon.<br>
