Test for herbicidal activity and phytotoxicity in paddy field<br>
Pots having a surface area of 150cm were filled with a small amount of fertilizer and sterilized paddy field soil in a muddy state with a depth of 5cm.      Five (5) seeds of pre-germinated rice were directly sown on the soil surface and three (3) rice seedlings (2-3 leaves) prepared in advance were transplanted in a depth of 2cm in each pot       In another pot, seeds of barnyardgrass were sown and incorporated into the surface layer of soil After sowing and transplanting of rice plant and sowing of barnyardgrass, the pots were flooded with water 3 cm deep and kept in a greenhouse       The rice plant was treated with the chemicals 5 days after sowing or transplanting, and barnyardgrass was treated with the chemicals at the pre-emergence (5 days after from sowing) and post-emergence stage (at the three-leaf stage, usually after 15 days from sowing)<br>
Suitable herbicidal compositions were prepared by mixing and dissolving 1 part by weight of the active compound with 5 parts by weight of acetone and 1 part by weight of alkylaryl polyglycolether as an emulsifier and then diluting with water to the predetermined concentration Application was made by dropping the herbicide solutions onto the water surface of the pots<br>
The test plants were observed for two weeks after the treatment with the chemicals and then herbicidal activity and phytotoxicity of the test compounds were visually rated in a percent (%) scale, where 0 means no activity or .phytotoxicity and 100 means complete death<br>
The herbicidal activity and phytotoxicity in paddy field of the compound of formula CI) and the known standard compounds are given in the following Tables 3a and<br>

As shown in Table 3a, the standard compound E, at 80 g/ha which is the four-times higher rate than the conventional application rate (20 g/ha), shows little phytotoxicity to rice, 10 or 30% to the transplanted or direct-seeded rice, respectively Therefore, the compound E is considered to be highly safe to rice However, it shows weak herbicrdal activity to barnyardgrass (10% at 20g/ha). which is the most important weed in rice<br>
On  the  contrary,   the  standard  compounds  A  to  D  show  excellent  activity  to barnyardgrass  l e , 95% or greater activity at 20g/ha by pre- or post-emergence treatments These compounds (A~D) also show rice safety at 20 g/ha, 10 to 40% of phytotoxicity<br>
depending on the compounds However, for commercial development, a compound should be safe at four-times higher rates than the recommended rate The compounds A~D show 50-80% of phytotoxicity depending on the compounds at 80g/ha, which is four times as much as the typical dose, and thus, are considered to be impossible to develop<br>
