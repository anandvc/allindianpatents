A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF 2-(IMIDAZOL-l-YL)-l-HYDROXYETHANE-l,l-DIPHOSPHONICACID<br>
SUN PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES LTD.<br>
A company incorporated under the laws of India having their office at ACME PLAZA, ANDHERI-KURLA ROAD, ANDHERI (E), MUMBAI-400059,<br>
MAHARASHTRA, INDIA.<br>
GRANTED<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
ORIGINAL        18 OCT 2004                     18-10-2004<br><br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 2-(imidazol-l-yl)-l-hydroxyethane-l,l-diphosphonic acid, compound of formula 1, commonly known as zoledronic acid (INN Name) used as medicament for treatment of diseases associated with impairment of calcium metabolism.<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
United States Patent No. 4,939,130 (Assigned to: Ciba-Geigy Corporation) discloses the preparation of zoledronic acid, compound of formula 1, from imidazol-1-ylacetic acid, compound of formula 2,<br><br>
by two methods viz.<br>
(a)	Compound of formula 2 or its acid chloride is treated with suitable triphosphite of formula P(OR)3 to give an intermediate compound which is reacted with a diphosphite of formula HPO(OR)2 to give the diphosphonate, which on hydrolysis gives zoledronic acid, compound of formula 1.<br>
(b)	Compound of formula 2 is treated with phosphorous acid and phosphorus trihalide in halogenated hydrocarbons followed by hydrolysis to give zoledronic acid, compound of formula 1.<br><br><br>
This patented process however does not disclose the process for preparing imidazol-1 -ylacetic acid, compound of formula 2, the starting raw material for synthesis of zoledronic acid.<br>
Birkofer et.al in Chemische Berichte 1960, 93, 2804-9 reports the synthesis of imidazol-1-ylacetic acid by hydrolysis of trimethylsilyl 1-imidazoleacetate. This process uses silylating agents which are expensive.<br>
Prior art methods (a) Zaderenko et.al in J. Org. Chem. 1994, 59, 6268-73 and (b) PCT publication 9955670 prepare different alkyl or alkylaryl esters of imidazol-1-ylacetic acid. Further method (b) describes hydrolysis of the ester of imidazol-1-ylacetic acid to imidazol-1-ylacetic acid, compound of formula 2, by heating in water. The preparation of the ester involves treating imidazole with the required haloacetates in presence of potassium hydroxide and potassium carbonate in methylene dichloride and facilitator like l,5-bis[(N-benzyl-N,N-diethylammonio)ethyl]ether dichloride (BBDED). The method reported in prior art for synthesis of esters has several disadvantages, (i) It requires usage of haloacetates, which are relatively expensive, (ii) Additional base is used in the reaction which is inorganic that makes the reaction mixture heterogeneous and requires use of facilitator to facilitate the reaction, (iii) The yields of most of the esters obtained by this method are low. Method (a) prepares benzyl esters of imidazol-1-yl acetic acid in low yield. Method (b) discloses preparation of methyl and malonyl esters of imidazol-1 -ylacetic acid in 70-80% and 49% yield respectively. Hydrolysis of these compounds will further reduce the overall yield of imidazol-1-ylacetic acid, compound of formula 2. The process of the present invention prepares the benzyl ester of imidazol-1-ylacetic acid, compound of formula 3, in greater than 80% yield. All the above mentioned prior art references prepare the haloacetate or trimethylsilyl haloacetate separately and then treat it with imidazole. The process of the present invention prepares the compound of formula 3, by directly reacting imidazole with benzyl alcohol and chloroacetyl chloride in one pot. It does not need a separate unit operation for preparation of the haloacetatae.<br>
Surprisingly the benzyl ester of imidazol-1-ylacetic acid, compound of formula 3, may be prepared in high yields, in one pot in a homogenous system by a novel method without<br><br><br>
the use of expensive haloacetates. The benzyl 1-imidazolylacetate, compound of formula 3, is then converted to imidazol-1-ylacetic acid, compound of formula 2, by catalytic hydrogenolysis or by acid hydrolysis which is further converted to compound of formula 1.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a simple and cost-effective process for the preparation of compound of formula 1.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to prepare compound of formula 3 by a novel process in high yields by simple, convenient and commercially viable method from readily available and cheap reagents.<br>
The compound of formula 3 can be used as an intermediate for the preparation of imidazole derivatives such as compound of formula 1.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION:<br>
The present invention provides a process for preparation of 2-(imidazol-l-yl)-  1-hydroxyethane-l,l-diphosphonic acid, compound of formula 1, said process comprising<br><br><br><br>
(a) reacting imidazole with chloroacetyl chloride and benzyl alcohol in a homogenous system in one pot to obtain benzyl 1- imidazolylacetate, compound of formula 3;<br><br><br><br>
Formula 3 (b) debenzylating benzyl 1-imidazolylacetate, compound of formula 3, to imidazol-1-ylacetic acid, compound of formula 2, and<br><br>
Formula 2 (c) converting compound of formula 2 to compound of formula 1.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for preparing benzyl 1-imidazolylacetate, compound of formula 3, said process comprising<br><br><br><br>
reacting imidazole with chloroacetyl chloride and benzyl alcohol in a homogenous system in one pot.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
We have now developed a high yielding commercially viable process for the preparation of 2-(imidazol-l-yl)-l-hydroxyethane-l,l-diphosphonic acid, compound of formula 1. According to the process of the present invention 2-(imidazol-l-yl)-l-hydroxyethane-l,l-diphosphonic acid, compound of formula 1, may be prepared from compound of formula<br>
3<br><br>
This process prepares compound of formula 3 from cheap and readily available raw materials in a single pot. The compound of formula 3 is then debenzylated to compound of formula 2 which is then converted to compound of formula 1.<br>
According to one embodiment of the process of the present invention the compound of formula 3, benzyl 1-imidazolylacetate, is prepared by reaction of imidazole with chloroacetyl chloride and benzyl alcohol in an organic solvent.<br>
The process of the present invention prepares compound of formula 3, benzyl-1-imidazolyl acetate, in one pot starting from chloroacetyl chloride, benzyl alcohol and<br><br>
imidazole. Imidazole is present in molar excess over chloroacetyl chloride and acts as reactant as well as base. The molar ratio of chloroacetyl chloride: imidazole may be selected in the range from 1:2 to about 1:6, preferably 1:3.<br>
Accordingly the process of the present invention is carried out in absence of additional base. The use of excess of imidazole avoids use of an additional inorganic base such as hydroxides, carbonates of alkali and alkaline earth metal salts such as potassium hydroxide &amp;/or potassium carbonate and the like, or an organic base like tertiary alkylamines, such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine etc.<br>
The reaction mixture of the present invention is homogenous, as imidazole is soluble in organic solvent, and a separate additional base is not used in the reaction. Accordingly the process of the present invention obviates the requirement of a facilitator such as a phase transfer catalyst.<br>
The organic solvent may be selected from non-polar solvents like linear or cyclic aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons such as n-hexane, n-heptane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene and the like; aliphatic or aromatic halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene dichloride, ethylene dichloride, tetrachloroethane, trichloroethane, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene and the like; ethereal solvents, such as diethylether, di-isopropylether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran and the like; esters such as ethyl acetate, tert-butyl acetate and the like; or inert polar aprotic solvents such as acetonitrile, sulfolane and the like.<br>
The reaction may be carried out at temperature ranging from 30 to 100°C, preferably 40 to 70°C.<br><br><br>
The compound of formula 3 is thus prepared in high yields by simple, convenient and commercially viable method from readily available, and cheap reagents with reduced number of unit operations.<br>
According to another embodiment of the process of the present invention the compound of formula 2, imidazol-1-ylacetic acid, is obtained by debenzylating benzyl 1- imidazolyl acetate, compound of formula 3. The debenzylation may be carried by catalytic hydrogenolysis or by acidic hydrolysis.<br>
Accordingly the debenzylation by catalytic hydrogenolysis may be performed in presence of metal catalysts like palladium, platinum, ruthenium or rhodium and the like. For instance the catalytic hydrogenolysis may be carried out in a solvent at atmospheric pressure or at higher pressures, at temperature between 5 and 100°C. The solvent maybe selected from a polar protic solvent such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, acetic acid and the like; or in aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, or esters such as ethyl acetate, tert-butyl acetate and the like<br>
Alternatively, debenzylation may be performed by acidic hydrolysis with a mineral or organic acid, wherein mineral acid may be selected from hydrochloric, sulfuric, hydrobromic and the like; and the organic acid may be selected from acetic, oxalic, para-toluenesulfonic, methaesulfonic and the like.<br>
Acidic hydrolysis may be carried out by at temperature of about 20-100 °C for 2-6 hours preferably at about 40 to 70°C.<br>
The compound of formula 2, imidazol-1-ylacetic acid is then converted to 2-(imidazol-l-yl)-l-hydroxyethane-l,l-diphosphonic acid, compound of formula 1 using standard methods known to those skilled in the art such as United States Patent No. 4,939,130.<br><br><br>

The reaction mixture was filtered and the cake containing product and palladium charcoal was washed with 2-propanol. The cake was then stirred for 30 minutes with water and filtered. The aqueous filtrate was concentrated and degassed by co-distillation with 2-propanol. The residue obtained was suspended and stirred in methanol (300ml), filtered and dried to obtain imidazol-1-ylacetic acid, compound of formula 2, 185g (purity &gt; 99.0%).<br><br><br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of imidazol-1-vlacetic acid (compound of formula 2) A solution of the crude benzyl- 1-imidazolyl acetate, compound of formula 3 (25g) as obtained in example 1, in 10% HC1 (50ml) was heated to 65° C for 4 hours. The reaction mixture was washed with toluene (50ml). The aqueous layer was concentrated and degassed by co-distillation with toluene. The residue obtained was suspended in acetone, stirred, filtered and dried to obtain imidazoi-1-ylacetic acid, compound of formula 2.<br>
Example 4<br>
