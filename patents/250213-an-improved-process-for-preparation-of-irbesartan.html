OF IRBESARTAN.<br>
2.	Applicant(s)<br>
(a)	NAME : ALEMBIC LIMITED<br>
(b)	NATIONALITY : An Indian Company<br>

3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
THE    FOLLOWING    SPECIFICATION     PARTICULARLY    DESCRIBES    THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED<br><br><br>
Field of the invention:<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for preparing Irbesartan of formula (I).<br><br>
Background of the invention:<br>
The chemical name of Irbesartan is 2-Butyl-3-[[2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl]methyl]-1,3-diazaspiro[4,4]non-1-en-4-one and formula is C25H28N6O and molecular weight is 428.53. The current pharmaceutical product containing this drug is being sold by Sanofi Synthelabo using the tradename AVAPRO, in the form of tablets.<br>
Irbesartan is useful in the treatment of diabetic nefropathy, heart failure therapy and hypertension. Irbesartan is angiotension II type I (AllI)-receptor antagonist. Angiotension II is the principal pressor agent of the rennin-angiotension system and also stimulates aldosterone synthesis and secretion by adrenal cortex, cardiac contraction, renal resorption of sodium, activity of the sympathetic nervous system and smooth muscle cell growth. Irbesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone- secreting effects of angiotension II by selectively binding to the AT1 angiotension II receptor.<br>
U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,270,317 and 5,559,233 describes a process for the preparation of N-substituted heterocyclic derivatives which involves reacting a heterocyclic compound of the formula<br>
R5-/	(CH2)t<br>
z(CH2)	N<br>
H<br>
2<br><br>
with a (biphenyl-4-yl)methyl derivative of the formula<br><br>
"yyj<br>
wherein R-i, R2, R3, R4, R5, and t, z and Hal have the meanings given in said U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 5,270,317, in the presence of an inert solvent such as DMF, DMSO or<br>
THF, with a basic reagent, for example KOH, a metal alcoholate, a metal hydride,<br>
calcium carbonate or triethylamine. The products of the reaction were purified by<br>
chromatography.<br>
U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,352,788, and 5,559,233, and WO 91/14679 also describe<br>
identical alkylation of the nitrogen atom of the heterocyclic compound with the<br>
halo-biphenyl compound using the same inert solvent and the same basic<br>
reagents.<br>
Also Canadian Patent No. 2050769 describes the alkylation of the nitrogen atom<br>
of the heterocycle of the formula<br><br>
with a compound of the formula<br><br>
wherein X, R-i, Z1 and Z6 have the meanings given therein, in the presence of N,N-dimethy!formamide and a basic reagent, such as alkali metal hydrides for example sodium or potassium hydride.<br>
All of the above identified patents describe alkylation in solvents, such as N,N-dimethylformamide or DMSO, etc. in the presence of a basic reagent, for example, a metal hydride or a metal alcoholate etc. The strong bases, such as metal hydride or a metal alcoholate require anhydrous reaction conditions. Since N,N-dimethylformamide is used as a solvent, its removal requires high temperature concentration by distillation, which can result in degradation of the final product. The product intermediate is also purified by chromatography which is commercially not feasible and cumbersome on large scale.<br>

This process comprises the steps of protecting carboxylic group present on<br>

scale.<br>
US  Patent  No.  2004242894  also discloses the  process  of preparation  of<br>
Irbesartan from 4-bromomethyl biphenyl 2'-(1H-tetrazol (2-triphenylmethyl) 5-yl)<br>
and  Ethyl ester of 1-Valeramido cyclopentanecarboxylic acid in toluene in<br>

this requires chromatographic purification.<br>
This patent also discloses the process of preparation of tetrazolyl protected<br>
Irbesartan using 2,6 lutidine and oxalylchloride in toluene.  However in this<br>
process the yield is as low as 30%.<br>

However, this process has several disadvantages such as use of the reagents like butyl lithium and triisobutyl borate at low temp such as -20 to -30°C under Argon atmosphere condition which is difficult to maintain at commercial scale. WO2005113518 discloses the process of preparation of Irbesartan by condensing n-pentanoyl cycloleucine (V) with 2-(4-aminomethyl phenyl) benzonitrile (VI) using dicyclocarbodiimide (DCC) and 1-hydroxy benzotriazole as catalyst to give an open chain intermediate of formula (VIII) which is then cyclized in the presence of an acid, preferably trifluoro acetic acid to give cyano derivative of formula (VII) and which in turn is converted to Irbesartan by treating it with tributyl tin chloride and sodium azide.<br><br><br>
Process-1<br><br>

In this application further describes another process comprising the steps of reacting 2-butyl-1,3-diazaspiro[4,4]non-1-en-4-one monohydrochloride (A) with 4-bromobenzyl bromide (B) in presence of base and solvent to give 3-[4-bromobenzyl]-2-butyl-1,3-diazaspiro[4,4]non-1-en-4-one (C) which is condensed with 2-[2'-(triphenylmethyl-2'H-tetrazol-5'-yl)phenyl boronic acid in the presence of tetrakis triphenyl phosphine palladium and base to give Irbesartan (I). However these processes suffer with several disadvantages such as it uses trifluoroacetic acid for the cyclization step which is highly corrosive material. The process requires an additional step of activation by DCC. This step not only increases number of steps but also create problem in handling DCC at an industrial scale as it is highly prone to hazard which makes the process least preferred on a large scale production of Irbesartan. Further it uses phenyl boronic acid derivative and triphenyl phosphine complex which are harmful for the skin and eye tissue and also harmful for respiratory system. Tetrakis triphenyl phosphine palladium is also a costly material which increases overall cost for the production of Irbesartan. Moreover the yield is as low as 22%. All the above patents/applications are incorporated herein as reference. In summary, prior art relating to the process for the preparation of Irbesartan suffers with several drawbacks such as<br>
i) It requires chromatographic purification of intermediates at various stages.<br>
ii) It requires specific autoclave conditions for a, deprotection of protecting group.<br>
iii) It requires maintaining low temperature conditions such as -30°C and requires special handling care and air and moisture tight condition with the reagents such as butyl lithium and triisobutyl borate.<br>
iv)       It uses hazardous and highly corrosive reagents.<br>
v)       It suffers low yield problem.<br>
vi)      All the process is having more number of reaction steps. It is therefore, a need to develop a process which not only overcomes the disadvantages of the prior art but also economical, operationally simple and industrially applicable.<br>

wherein A represents protected tetrazolyl group.<br>
Suitable protecting groups of protected 1 H-tetrazol-5-yl are the protecting groups customarily used in tetrazole chemistry, especially triphenylmethyl, unsubstituted or substituted, for example nitro-substituted, benzyl, such as 4-nitrobenzyl, lower alkoxymethyl, such as methoxymethyl or ethoxymethyl, lower alkylthiomethyl, such    as   methylthiomethyl,    and    2-cyanoethyl,    also    lower   alkoxy-lower alkoxymethyl, such as 2-methoxyethoxymethyl, benzyloxymethyl and phenacyl. wherein the said "acid" and "organic solvent" is selected from the group as defined earlier, (ii)      deprotecting the protected tetrazolyl group, present in the compound of<br>
formula (Vllb) by known methods to get Irttesartan of formula (I) For example triphenylmethyl is customarily removed by means of hydrolysis especially in the presence of an acid, for example in the presence of hydrogen halide, advantageously in an inert solvent, such as haloalkane or an ether, for example in dichloromethane or dioxane, and with heating; or by hydrogenolysis in the presence of hydrogenation catalyst, 4-nitrobenzyl is removed, for example by hydrogenolysis in the presence of hydrogenation catalyst; methoxymethyl or ethoxymethyl is removed, for example by treatment with a lower alkyl tin bromide such as triethyl- or tributyl- tin bromide; methylthiomethyl is removed for example by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid; 2-cyanoethyl is removed, for example, by hydrolysis, for example with hydrochloric acid; and benzyloxymethyl and phenacyl are removed, for example- by hydrogenolysis in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst.<br>
