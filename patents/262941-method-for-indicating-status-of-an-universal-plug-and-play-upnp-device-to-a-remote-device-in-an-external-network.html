				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to remote access to devices in a network, and in particular to remote access to Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) devices.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
The UPnP standard has increased its importance in becoming a standard for home networking. UPnP is designed to be used in private networks. An example of a private network is a Local Area Network (LAN), such as a home network including networked electronics devices, and has no consideration for accessing devices in a home network remotely, e.g., over the Internet or from another home network.<br>
The Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) forms the foundation of the UPnP standard. One aspect of the SSDP involves a service discovery request. A UPnP Control Point in a UPnP network multicasts requests to check for any online UPnP Devices. Each UPnP Device must listen for such requests, and when it receives such a request, the UPnP Device sends a unicast response back to the requesting UPnP Control Point. On the other hand, a UPnP Device also periodically advertises itself by multicasting its presence. When a UPnP Control Point receives such advertisement, it can consider that the UPnP Device is online and is ready to be used. As the number of Devices/Services increase, the number of advertisements increases.<br>
This periodic multicasting is not scalable for remote access where Device/Service advertisement must travel over a connecting network (e.g., the Internet) between a home network and a Remote Control Point. This is because the bandwidth available for communication through the Internet is typically much less than that available in a home network. Applying existing UPnP SSDP over the Internet results in increasing consumption of limited bandwidth for the SSDP traffic and thus wasting valuable resources, such as the limited Internet connection bandwidth. Moreover, communication latency over the Internet is difficult to control. Long latencies can cause the Control Point to mistakenly treat a remote UPnP Device as offline, and cause errors in applications. There is, therefore, a need for a method and system for remote access to devices, which addresses the above shortcomings.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a method and system for remote access to a device in a network. In one embodiment, this involves establishing a connection between a local device connected in a local network and a remote device via a communication link; sending a message from the local device to the remote device via the communication link, indicating an online status of the local device; and maintaining an online status indication for the local device at the remote device, until arrival of a message indicating an offline status of the local device. The remote device maintains (considers) the local device in the network, until the remote device receives an offline message from the local device. Latency in communication over the communication link such as the Internet does not result in the remote considering the local device offline until the remote device receives an offline message in relation to the local device.<br>
An example implementation for a UPnP Device involves establishing a connection between a UPnP Device connected in a local network and a remote device including a Control Point, via a communication link; sending a message from the UPnP Device to the Remote Control Point via the communication link, indicating an online status of the UPnP Device; and maintaining an online status indication for the UPnP Device at the Control Point, until arrival of a message indicating an offline status of the UPnP Device.<br>
The Remote Control Point maintains the UPnP Device in the network, until the Control Point receives an offline message from the UPnP Device. Latency in communication over the communication link such as the Internet does not result in the Remote Control Point considering the UPnP Device offline until the Remote Control Point receives an offline message in relation to the UPnP Device.<br>
The present invention may enable optimization of the UPnP SSDP traffic between a UPnP Device in a network and a Remote Control Point, over the Internet. It also may enable optimization of the UPnP SSDP traffic between a UPnP Control Point in a first network and another UPnP Device in another network over the Internet. These features are further backward compatible with existing UPnP SSDP architectures.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The present invention provides a method and system for remote access to a local device in a local network, such as UPnP Device in a local network. In one embodiment, this involves establishing a connection between a local device connected in a local network and a remote device via a communication link; sending a message from the local device to the remote device via the communication link, indicating an online status of the local device; and maintaining an online status indication for the local device at the remote device, until arrival of a message indicating an offline status of the local device. The remote device maintains (considers) the local device in the network, until the remote device receives an offline message from the local device. Latency in communication over the communication link such as the Internet does not result in the remote considering the local device offline until the remote device receives an offline message in relation to the local device.<br>
An example implementation for remote access by a Remote Control Point in a remote device, to a UPnP Device in a local network, is now described. Such an implementation involves establishing a connection between a UPnP Device connected in a local network and a remote device including a Control Point, via a communication link; sending a message from the UPnP Device to the Remote Control Point via the communication link, indicating an online status of the UPnP Device; and maintaining an online status indication for the UPnP Device at the Control Point, until arrival of a message indicating an offline status of the UPnP Device.<br>
The Internet enables devices to be connected virtually anywhere and at anytime. Utilizing the Internet and UPnP, according to an embodiment of the present invention, LAN (e.g., the home network) users can access content in devices in the LAN, control devices and services in home from anywhere and at anytime, etc. For example, parents can access a home surveillance camera to monitor their kids at home while working. The present invention provides a process that optimizes the device and service discovery protocol used in the current UPnP architecture, for remote access to UPnP Devices/Services by a Control Point over the Internet.<br>
The philosophy behind the existing UPnP SSDP architecture is for a Control Point to treat a UPnP Device/Service as offline if the Control Point does not receive SSDP alive messages from the UPnP Device/Service within a specified period. This requires that each Device/Service to periodically multicast its presence within the network. Though such a multicasting process may work when the Control Point is within the same LAN as the UPnP Devices/Services. Such a process breaks down when network devices are accessed remotely through the Internet where latency is typically long and often violates the UPnP SSDP specification for correct operations. As such, the present invention provides a process that optimizes the SSDP traffic for UPnP Device/Service discovery over the Internet between a UPnP Device in a LAN, and a Control Point in a remote device. This involves the Remote Control Point maintaining the information regarding the UPnP Device in the network, until the Remote Control Point receives an offline ("byebye") message from the UPnP Device. As a result, latency in communication over the Internet does not cause the Remote Control Point to consider the UPnP Device as offline until the Control Point receives an offline message in relation to the UPnP Device. An example implementation of the present invention is described below.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a functional architecture of an example network 100 such as a home network, embodying aspects of the present invention. The network 100 comprises devices 104 which can include consumer electronics (CE) devices (e.g., TV, VCR, PDA, STB, cell phone), appliances, etc. Some of the devices 104 may include content (e.g., audio/visual content), while others may not. The network 100 further includes an interface, such as a gateway (GW) 102 that connects the network 100 to an external network 50 (e.g., another local network, the Internet). Though the devices 104 are shown separately, a single physical device can include one or more logical devices. One or more devices in the network 100 implement the UPnP protocol. The devices 104 and the gateway 102 are connected by a LAN. Fig. 4 also shows a remote access device 108, such as a standalone CE device, or a device in a network, etc., for accessing one or more devices 104 via the external network 50.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a more detailed view of the remote device 108 accessing a UPnP Device 104 in the network 100 via the Internet and the home gateway 102. A UPnP Device 104 and the home gateway 102 are connected by a home LAN (other devices are also connected to the LAN as shown in Fig. 4). The home gateway 102 preferably includes a device proxy server 106 for intercepting and processing SSDP messages between the network 100 and the Internet. The remote device 108 includes a UPnP Control Point 110 and a device proxy client 112. The device proxy client 112 cooperates with the device proxy server 106 to regulate the SSDP traffic. The proxy client 112 processes SSDP traffic between the UPnP client device 104 and the Control Point 110. As such, from the point of view of the Control Point 110, SSDP messages appear to originate from the proxy client 112 instead of the UPnP Device 104. The network 100 can include one or more additional UPnP Device 105 and a Local Control Point 107.<br>
Fig. 6 shows an example communication process 60 implemented between the UPnP Device 104 and the remote UPnP Device 108, according to an embodiment of the present invention, including the steps of:<br>
1.	The UPnP Device 104 sends (multicasts) a SSDP alive message over the<br>
LAN to advertise itself and all of the services it contains.<br>
2.	The device proxy server 106 in the home gateway 102 receives the<br>
message, saves the message and sets a first timer for expiration of the SSDP message. The first timer is set according to a max-age header in the SSDP alive message specification.<br>
3.	The device proxy server 106 transcodes the SSDP message into a format<br>
that is used for communication between the device proxy server 106 and the device proxy client 112. The device proxy server 106 also modifies a SSDP LOCATION header such that a URL therein points to the device proxy server 106 in the gateway 102 instead of the actual UPnP Device 104.<br>
4.	The device proxy server 106 sends the transcoded and modified message<br>
to the device proxy client 112 of the remote device 108 via the internet.<br>
5.	The device proxy client 112 saves the message and sets a second timer<br>
in the device proxy client 112 for the expiration of the message according to a max-age header in the SSDP alive message specification.<br>
6.	The device proxy client 112 transcodes the message into a UPnP SSDP<br>
message. In addition, the device proxy client 112 modifies the SSDP LOCATION header such that a URL therein points to the device proxy client 112 instead of the device proxy server 106 in the gateway 102.<br>
7.	The device proxy client 112 then multicasts the SSDP message within the<br>
network that the remote device 108 belongs. In this embodiment, the<br>
device proxy client 112 multicasts the SSDP message on the loopback network (i.e., IP address of 127.0.0.1) of the device 104, that the Control Point 110 is listening on.<br>
8.	The Control Point 110 receives the SSDP message from the proxy client<br>
112 from the loopback network and further obtains the Device/Service description of the device 104 via the URL in the LOCATION header of the SSDP message. When the Control Point obtains the description, request and response messages are then passed between the Control Point 110 and the UPnP Device 104 via the device proxy client 112 and the device proxy server 106.<br>
9.	At a later time, before the SSDP message expires, the UPnP Device 104<br>
multicasts another round of SSDP messages in the network to inform other devices, including the Control Point 110, that the UPnP Device 104 is still online.<br>
10.	The device proxy server 106 receives the SSDP messages indicating an<br>
online status of the UPnP Device 104, and updates the first timer in the device proxy server 106 with a new expiration time.<br>
11.	When	the second timer expires on the device proxy client 112, if the device proxy client 112 determines that it has not received an offline ("byebye") message from the device proxy server 106, the device proxy client 112 multicasts a new round of SSDP alive message on behalf of the UPnP Device 104; and resets the second timer with an expiration time copied from the expiration time of the previous second timer in the proxy client 112.<br>
12.	The Control Point 110 receives the new round of SSDP messages from<br>
the device proxy client 112, and considers the UPnP Device 104 as still online.<br>
13.	At	a later time, the UPnP Device 104 goes offline, for example, a home user turns it off, power outage, etc.<br>
14.	When the first timer expires on the device proxy server 106, if the device<br>
proxy server 106 determines that it has not received a new SSDP alive message from the UPnP Device 104, the device proxy server 106<br>
considers the UPnP Device 104 as offline and removes the UPnP Device 104 from its memory.<br>
15.	The device proxy server 106 sends a "byebye" message to the device<br>
proxy 112, indicating an offline status of the UPnP Device 104.<br>
16.	The device proxy client 112 receives the offline message from the device<br>
proxy server 106.<br>
17.	The device proxy client 112 multicasts a SSDP offline message on behalf<br>
of the device proxy server 106 which represents the UPnP Device 104, and removes the UPnP Device 104 from its memory.<br>
18.	The Control Point 110 receives the offline message and removes the<br>
device proxy client 112, which represents the UPnP Device 104 from its online device list.<br>
As such, the Remote Control Point 110 maintains the UPnP Device 104 in the network, until the Control Point 110 receives a SSDP message that indicates the UPnP Device 104 if offline. In other words, the Control Point considers the UPnP Device as remaining online until the Control Point receives a SSDP message indicating that the UPnP Device is offline. Therefore, latency in communication over the Internet does not result in the Remote Control Point removing the UPnP Device from the network prematurely that results in inconsistency of UPnP Device actual status and perceived UPnP Device status by the Remote Control Point. Accordingly, the present invention optimizes the SSDP traffic for UPnP Device/Service discovery over the Internet between a UPnP Device in a LAN and a Control Point in a Remote Device. As an option, the LAN can agree upon sending a periodic message to the remote device indicating the presence of Devices in the LAN, interval being configurable.<br>
An alternative embodiment involves implementing the device proxy client 112 on a second gateway in anther home network, wherein the remote device 108 connects to the second gateway. All operations remain the same, as described above.<br>
The present invention provides a method and system for optimizing the UPnP discovery process for remote access to UPnP Devices. The present invention enables optimization of the UPnP SSDP traffic between a remote UPnP Device on the Internet and a UPnP Device in a LAN. The present invention also enables optimization of the UPnP SSDP traffic between a UPnP Control Point in a first network and another UPnP Device in another network, over the Internet. These features are further backward compatible with existing UPnP SSDP architectures.<br>
Referring to Fig. 7, in another example according to the present invention, the proxy server can be implemented in as a separate entity, having a port- forwarding mechanism from the LAN gateway for all traffic it receives from external sources. In Fig. 7 a device 208 accesses a UPnP Device 204 in a network 200 via the Internet, a home gateway 202 and a UPnP device 213 which implements a device proxy server 206. The UPnP Device 204 and the UPnP device 213 are connected by the LAN, and the gateway 202 is connected to the UPnP Device 213 (other devices 205, 207 are also connected to the LAN as shown in Fig. 4). The device proxy server 206 is configured for intercepting and processing SSDP messages between the network 200 and the Internet (similar to the device proxy server 106 in Fig. 5). The remote device 208 includes a UPnP Control Point 210 and a device proxy client 212 (similar to the remote device 108 in Fig. 5). The device proxy client 212 cooperates with the device proxy server 206 to regulate the SSDP traffic. The proxy client 212 processes SSDP traffic between the UPnP client device 204 and the Control Point 210. As such, from the point of view of the Control Point 110, SSDP messages appear to originate from the proxy client 212 instead of the UPnP Device 204. The proxy server 206 is implemented in the LAN as a separate entity in the UPnP device 213, having a port-forwarding mechanism from the home gateway 202 for all traffic it receives. The process 60 in Fig. 6 is applicable to the example in Fig. 7, with a change to the step 4 such that the device proxy server 206 forwards the message to the Home Gateway 202 to send to the remote device 208.<br>
Fig. 8 shows similarly the various steps similar to the Fig. 6, wherein the Device Proxy Server is not implemented part of the Home Gateway 202 but is rather as an independent entity as part of the UPnP Device 213. The only addition in this case is the Step 5 (Device proxy server 206 forwards this message to Home Gateway 202).<br>
Though in the above description examples for the UPnP standard are provided, as those skilled in the art will recognize the present invention is useful with any communication protocol that uses discovery/eventing/messaging protocols.<br>
As is known to those skilled in the art, the aforementioned example architectures described above, according to the present invention, can be implemented in many ways, such as program instructions for execution by a processor, as logic circuits, as an application specific integrated circuit, as firmware, etc. The present invention has been described in considerable detail with reference to certain preferred versions thereof; however, other versions are possible.
