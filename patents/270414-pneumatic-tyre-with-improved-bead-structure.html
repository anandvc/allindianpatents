				<td>"PNEUMATIC TYRE WITH IMPROVED BRAD STRUCTURE"<br>
 The present invention relates to a pneumatic tyre suitable for being used in trucks or lorries, especially for medium/heavy transport.<br>
In particular, the present invention concerns a pneumatic tyre provided with an improved bead structure which contributes in increasing the geometrical stability as well as the resistance to local deformations of the tyre bead region.<br>
A tyre generally comprises: a carcass structure comprising at least one carcass ply, the ends of which are folded back or secured to two annular reinforcing elements, i.e. the so-called "bead cores"; a tread band; a belt structure placed between the carcass structure and the tread band; and a pair of sidewalls applied to said carcass structure in axially opposite positions.<br>
The tyre region which comprises the bead core is known as "tyre bead" and performs the function of fixing the tyre on a respective rim. In particular, the bead Core serves as anchorage for the carcass ply or plies, and, moreover, it withstands the forces exerted by the carcass under the effect of the inflation pressure as well as the deformations resulting from the travel of the tyre. Furthermore, the bead core ensures the transmission of longitudinal forces and, in case of tubeless tyres, ensures the seal between the tyre and the wheel rim, the latter being provided in correspondence of the bead mounting  position  and  comprising  two  substantially conical coaxial surfaces which act as the supporting base for the tyre beads. Said surfaces generally terminate in a flange, radially projecting outwardly, that supports the axially outer surface of the bead and against which<br>
the latter abuts by virtue of the tyre inflation pressure. Proper positioning of the bead into its seat is ensured by the conical shape of the bead seat in cooperation with the metal bead core.<br>
Generally, in a position radially external to said bead core, the bead further comprises a rubber strip, conventionally called "bead filling" or "bead apex", which has a substantially triangular cross-section and extends radially outwardly from the respective bead core.<br>
Different types of bead cores are known in the art.<br>
For example, a typical bead core structure is the so-called "Alderfer" structure which has a configuration of the' type "m x n", where "m" indicates the number of axially adjacent wires or cords (obtained by stranding at least one pair of wires or cords) and "n" indicates the number of radially superimposed layers of said wires (or cords). This structure is obtained by using a rubberized strip comprising a predefined number of - textile or metallic - wires or cords and by spirally winding (coiling) said rubberized strip onto itself so as to form a desired number of layers arranged radially superimposed one on top of the other. This constructional method allows the formation of cross-sectional Contours of the bead core which are of a substantially quadrangular type. Examples of Alderfer structure are, in fact, 4x4, 5x5 or 4x5 structures.<br>
A further conventional bead core structure is the so-called "single wire bead core". This is formed from a single rubberized wire (or cord) which is wound spirally so as to form a first layer of axially adjacent turns (coils); then, in a position radially external to said first layer, the same wire (or cord) is further coiled so as to form a second layer in a position radially external<br>
to the first layer, and so on, so as to form several radially superimposed layers. Therefore, by varying the number of turns in each layer, it is possible to obtain cross-sectional contours of the bead core with different geometrical forms, for example a hexagonal shaped cross-section.  A regular hexagonal bead core may be formed, for example, by means of 19 windings arranged in the configuration:  3-4-5-4-3.    This  series  of  numbers indicates that the individual rubberized wire (or cord) is coiled so as to form firstly three turns axial ly adjacent to each other to form a first layer; then four turns axially adjacent to each other are provided in succession so as  to form a second layer radially superimposed on the first layer, followed by five turns, axially adjacent to each other, so as to form a third layer radially superimposed on the second layer, then four turns axially adjacent to each other so as to form a fburth layer radially superimposed on the third layer and finally three turns axially adjacent to each other so as to form a fifth layer radially superimposed on the fourth layer.<br>
A further conventional  bead core  structure  is obtained by using a plurality of rubberized wires (or cords), each individual wire (or cord) being radially coiled onto itself so as to form a column of radially superimposed wound turns (coils).   Several columns of turns,  possibly with a different vertical extension (namely  different  number  of  wound  turns  radially superimposed on each other), axially adjacent to each other,  thus  form  the  abovementioned  bead  core. Preferably, said wires have predetermined cross sections (e.g. a substantially hexagonal cross section) so that ' the wires of axially adjacent coils can be coupled<br>
together to form an assembly (i.e. the bead core) that is constituted by equal and distinct elements (modular elements) and that is provided with a compact cross section, i.e. the latter does not comprise hollow spaces or interferences and has an area corresponding to the sum of the section areas of said distinct elements.<br>
In case a bead core is formed by spirally winding a single wire (so as to form the "single wire bead core" mentioned above) or a plurality of wires (so as to form a plurality of columns of radially superimposed wound turns, each column being formed by one specific wire), some problems generally arise during the manufacturing process of the bead core (especially in the case the used wire is not rubberized) and also, when the finished product is produced, in keeping the several convolutions lying in ordered convolutions and layers.<br>
Generally, the wires forming the tyre bead cores are coated with a rubber composition. Since mounting of the tyre on the wheel rim and removal of the tyre therefrom require that the tyre bead steps over the rim flange, the latter having a diameter greater than the radially inner diameter of the bead core, the bead core needs to be deformed so as to take an elliptical configuration (ovalization)  in order to allow the above mentioned operations (mounting on and dismounting from the wheel rim)  to be carried out. However, especially in case tubeless tyres of large size are considered (e.g. truck tyres), if the tyre bead core is made of rubberized wires, after vulcanization the bead core becomes rigid" and compact, thus scarcely flexible. In order to solve such a problem, provision was made of bead cores formed of bare wires (i.e. non-rubberized wires.) which are able to displace circumferentially with respect to one another<br>
and thus to allow the required deformation (ovalization) of the bead core, even in the cured tyre. However, bead cores formed of non-rubberized wires do not possess sufficient geometrical stability and torsional strength to withstand the stresses exterted onto the bead cores both during the tyre manufacturing steps (especially during vulcanization and moulding of the tyre) and in operation of the tyre.<br>
It can be noted that this aspect is even more critical since the bead seat is generally inclined with respect to the tyre rotation axis, fact which inevitably contributes in negatively affecting the geometrical stability of the bead core convolutions.<br>
Some technical solutions are known in the art to confer an annular shape to the bead core and to contribute in keeping the desired shape both during the manufacturing of the tyre and the use thereof, so that irregular displacement of the wires convolutions can be reduced and the latter are hold together to ensure a correct alignment of said wires and a good frictional contact thereof.<br>
Foi: instance, documents US-2,149,079; US-1,503,883 and US-4,561,919 disclose the use of a textile strip (fabric wrapper) which is wound around the threadlike elements convolutions.<br>
GB-2,123,360 discloses a bead core comprising a circumferentiaily extending ring of a material having a U-shaped cross-section pocket at least partially enclosing a circumferential winding of high tensile reinforcement material. The U-shaped cross-section pocket may be closed so as to fully enclose the winding of high tensile material or may be open and enclose only a part of the cross-section of the winding of high tensile<br>
• material. The ring material is preferably metal such as steel and it may be zinc or brass plated to assist in bonding to the rubber of the tyre .bead.<br>
US-4,938,437  discloses  a  rubberless  tyre  bead assembly containing either a single wire element or multiple wire elements wound about an axis to provide a plurality of convolutions of the wire element (s) to form the bead hoop and shape-retaining members engaging the bead hoop about the circumference of the bead hoop to retain the bead assembly in a planar configuration. According to this document, said shape-retaining members include the use of metal clip members applied at several locations about the bead circumference as well as metal ties,  spring clips,  spiral wrapped fabrics or wires around the entire or a portion of the bead circumference, spot soldering, brazing or welding periodic locations about the bead circumference, use of solder-coated wire in the bead wires, gluing or use of adhesives, applying fusible  polymeric  material  periodically  or  entirely around  the  bead  circumference,  dipping  the  bead assemblies into an adhesive coating, and miniature hose clamp members which securely engage at least a portion of the convolutions of the single wire to hold the bead assembly. For instance, Figure 7 shows a metal clip member wrapped around the dense packed single wire tyre bead assembly; Figure 10 shows a helical retaining clip or spring wrap member which circumferentially engages the completed tyre bead assembly to retain the bead assembly in a plane perpendicular to the bead axis of revolution.<br>
Document US-3,949,800 discloses a pneumatic tyre whose beads are provided with bead rings of the package type having improved stability of shape, said package ring being formed of one or more wires having a<br>
quadrilateral section with at least two parallel opposite sides, the adjoining turns of wires touching each other both in the radial direction and in the axial direction along their facing surfaces. According to this document the bead core is preferably surrounded by a covering which comprises an insert of stuffing rubber in contact with the bead core and a rubber sheathing which clamps the stuffing.<br>
Document US-4,406,317 discloses a pneumatic tyre comprising bead cores made of wire layers wound to be placed over one another and consisting of wires -having an angular cross section. Due to the periodic stress of the tyre in movement, in order to avoid points of break of the carcass at the edges of the bead core, it has been customary to mold hard rubber compositions about the bead 'cores. Then, in order to save costs, it was preferred to wrap the bead cores with protective strips that are substantially accomodated to the contour of the bead cores and surrounding the corners thereof by rounding them off.<br>
With respect to the known solutions mentioned above, the Applicant has perceived the need of improving the geometrical stability of the tyre bead region and the structural strength thereof, in particular its resistance to local deformations, both in operation (i.e. during revolution of the tyre on the ground) and during the tyre manufacturing process steps successive to the bead core production and assembling within the tyre structure.<br>
In particular, the Applicant has perceived the need of increasing the resistance of the tyre bead to local deformations without negatively affecting the tyre bead flexibility which, as mentioned above, is advantageously required, for instance, during the mounting of the tyre<br>
on the wheel rim and during the dismounting of the tyre 'therefrom.<br>
The Applicant has noticed that said local deformations, which are exerted on the convolutions of the wire(s) forming the tyre bead cores, are mainly due to the following factors,<br>
Firstly, said deformations are due to the stress concentrations arising in the tyre bead region as a consequence of the relevant load carried by the vehicle, said stresses causing the tyre bead to bulge out, laterally beyond the rim edge, this is particularly true in the case of high duty vehicles which are requested to withstand loads, and sometimes overloads, of great entity.<br>
Secondly,  said deformations are generally caused also by the tyre manufacturing steps following the bead core production step, in particular the vulcanization and moulding steps carried out on the finished green tyre. The Applicant has noticed that the vulcanization and moulding steps can cause the convolutions of the wire(s) to move with respect to each other in- the cross section of the bead cores to such an extent that remarkable differences in tensioning of the wire(s) can occur. The latter may cause a relevant decrease of the resistance to rupture of said elements. Moreover, the Applicant has noticed that a remarkable distortion of the wire(s) convolutions in the cross section of the tyre bead cores and  the  consequent  formation  of  a  non-planar configuration thereof inevitably results in a geometrical distorted tyre bead and/or in loss of a precise bead position in the cured tyre.<br>
Moreover, the Applicant has perceived that the need of improving the geometrical stability of the tyre bead<br>
region is particularly advantageous not only in the case the bead core is formed of non-rubber!zed wire(e), but also in the case a rubber coating is provided around each wire. In fact, even if the presence of such a rubber coating positively contributes in holding together the wire(s) convolutions thanks to the adhesive property of the green rubber, the Applicant has noticed that in some circumstances, especially in case of truck tyres, the geometrical stability of the tyre bead is not guaranteed. Therefore, in conventional tyre manufacturing processes it is common practice to carry out a partial curing of the bead core so as to increase the geometrical stability thereof, especially during manufacturing.<br>
The Applicant's efforts have thus been focused on modifying the structure of the tyre bead region in order to obtain the desired structural strength in combination with a flexibility degree which can ensure an easy mount ing/dismount ing of the tyre on/from the wheel rim while providing, at the same time, a uniform and correct engagement of the tyre bead region with the rim flange along the whole circumferential profile of the tyre bead. The Applicant has found that said results can be achieved by providing the tyre bead with a bead • core which comprises a retaining member that envelopes the plurality of coils of metallic wires forming said bead core, the retaining member comprising a plurality of elongated reinforcing elements which comprise at least one preformed threadlike metallic element, the latter having a diameter in the range from about 0.05 mm to about 0.25 mm.<br>
Preferably, each elongated reinforcing element of the retaining member is a metallic cord comprising a plurality (i.e. at least two) of threadlike elements, at<br>
least one of said threadlike elements being preformed,<br>
in the present description the term "elongated preformed reinforcing element" is used to indicate a reinforcing element comprising at least one preformed threadlike element.<br>
The Applicant has found that high mechanical resistance properties can be conferred to the bead core by the presence of metallic reinforcing elements, while • high flexibility characteristics can be obtained by preforming at least one threadlike element of the elongated reinforcing elements, said high flexibility being typical of a reinforcing fabric made from a textile material.<br>
Therefore, the Applicant has found that by employing elongated preformed metallic elements in the retaining member enveloping the bead cores it ig possible to confer thereto high strength properties, which are typical of a semifinished product comprising metallic reinforcing elements, while ensuring a suitable flexibility degree to the bead core, which is typical of a semifinished product comprising textile reinforcing elements.<br>
Said aspect is very important also from a process point 6f view since a good flexibility of the retaining member can ensure that, during the tyre manufacturing process, the application of said retaining member can be easily and correctly carried out, said member accurately following the external profile of the bead core onto which it is applied.<br>
In fact, if the retaining member is too stiff and can not be correctly wound around the bead core, some air may remain entrapped between the bead core and the retaining member. The presence of air which can come into contact with the metallic reinforcing elements of the<br>
retaining member as well as with the metallic wire (s) of the bed core, has to be avoided since undesired corrosion phenomena can take place within the tyre bead.<br>
Thanks to the flexibility of the retaining member, further advantages can be obtained: a) the retaining member manufacturing process can be carried out by using the same apparatuses for calendering and cutting which are normally employed for textile materials; b) the step of application of the retaining member in the tyre manufacturing process is carried out very easily thanks to the flexibility of the retaining member.<br>
As mentioned above, the diameter of the preformed metallic threadlike elements of the retaining member is selected to be small, e.g. in the range of from 0.05 mm to 0.25 mm.<br>
The Applicant has found that the use of fine (i.e. with small diameters) preformed metallic threadlike elements as reinforcing elements for the retaining member is particularly advantageous since it allows to decrease the weight of said member and to increase its flexibility, thereby achieving the advantages mentioned above.<br>
Moreover, the Applicant has found that the retaining member of the present invention has a good green tackiness which favours the adhesion degree between the green rubber compound and the metallic threadlike elements forming the retaining member.<br>
Consequently, when this retaining member is handled during the application thereof in the tyre manufacturing process, it can be stretched, particularly in a direction transversal to the metallic, threadlike elements, without running the risk of separation of the reinforcing elements from the green rubber.<br>
Such a separation has to be avoided since it can give rise to corrosion phenomena or to the formation of critical areas inside of the tyre bead wherein metallic elements, devoid of the rubber coating, can protrude from the bead, a defect that can cause the tyre to be discarded.<br>
Furthermore, the Applicant has found that the retaining member of the present invention shows a very good adhesion of the cured rubber composition to the metallic threadlike element, even after aging (said aspect contributing to avoid the formation of corrosion phenomena), and a remarkable mutual interpenetration of the preformed threadlike elements of the cord (or of the non-preformed threadlike elements into the preformed threadlike elements in case the cord is made of preformed and non-preformed threadlike elements) so that undesired phenomena, such as fraying out of the cord end or curling of the cord end portion, do not occur when the cutting of the cord is performed.<br>
In a first aspect the present invention concerns a pneumatic tyre comprising:<br>
a bead structure comprising a pair of axially<br>
spaced apart bead cores;<br>
-	a  carcass structure comprising at least one<br>
carcass ply extending between said bead cores and<br>
secured at axially opposite end portions to a<br>
respective one of said bead cores, each axial end<br>
portion being turned up around said bead cores;<br>
a tread band extending circumferentially around said carcass structure;<br>
-	a belt structure circumferentxally located between<br>
said carcass structure and said tread band; and<br>
at least one pair of sidewalls applied to said<br>
carcass structure in axially opposite positions, wherein each bead core comprises:<br>
•	a plurality of coils of at least one metallic<br>
wire, said coils being radially superimposed and<br>
axially arranged side-by-side with respect to one<br>
another, and<br>
•	a retaining member enveloping said plurality of<br>
coils,  said  retaining  member  comprising  a<br>
plurality  of  mutually  substantially  parallel<br>
elongated reinforcing elements,  said elongated<br>
reinforcing elements comprising at least one<br>
preformed threadlike metallic element, said at<br>
least one preformed threadlike metallic element<br>
having a diameter in the range of from 0.05 mm to<br>
0.25 mm.<br>
Preferably, each elongated reinforcing element is a metallic cord having at least one preformed metallic threadlike element, while the remaining threadlike elements forming said at least one cord are of the non-preformed type.<br>
In a further embodiment, each elongated reinforcing element is a metallic cord the threadlike elements of which are all preformed. Prior to undergoing a given preforming action, the threadlike elements have a straight configuration.<br>
Preferably,  the  deformations  of  the  preformed threadlike elements are of the coplanar type. Namely each • preformed threadlike element lies in a plane.<br>
Preferably, said threadlike elements are preformed so that they assume a wave-shaped configuration so that they are substantially devoid of sharp edges and/or discontinuities in curvature along their longitudinal extension. Said feature is particularly advantageous<br><br>
since the absence of said sharp edges/corners results in a favourable increasing of the breaking load of the threadlike elements.<br>
Particularly preferred is a preforming according to substantially sinusoidal undulations.  Preferably, said sinusoidal undulations have a.wavelength of between 2.5 mm and 30 mm, and more preferably between 5 mm and 25 mm. Preferably,  said sinusoidal undulations have a wave amplitude of between 0.12 mm and 1 mm.  The wavelength and wave amplitude ranges referred to above may be measured  directly  on  the  non-rubberized  threadlike element before it is inserted into the tyre or on the finished  (vulcanized)  tyre.    Advantageously,  the measurement of said parameters ma'y be performed on the threadlike element by using a magnifying lens and a graduated scale (for example a graduated ruler).  In the case where a finished {or vulcanized) tyre is to be analysed, it is necessary to extract the bead core from the tyre, to separate the retaining member and to remove the rubberizing compound therefrom by using suitable solvents, for example by treating it with dichlorobenzene at 100°C for at least 12 hours.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the deformation has a form which is not of the coplanar type, but for example of the helical type.<br>
In order to obtain a preformed threadlike element according to the present invention, it is possible to use any one of the methods known in the sector. For example, it is possible to use toothed-wheel devices of the type illustrated in US-5,581,990 or to use the device described in patent application WO 00/39385, in the name of the same Applicant. Said device comprises a pair of pulleys, each provided with a plurality of facing lugs<br>
able to intermesh with each other over a predefined section so' as to induce simultaneously an axial de'formation and a flexural deformation in a threadlike element made to travel along the space lying between the lugs of the first pulley and the corresponding lugs of the second pulley. The abovementioned intertneshing action may be effected as a result of the movement of said pair of pulleys driven rotationally by said threadlike element.<br>
Preferably, the elongated reinforcing elements are substantially equally distributed in the retaining member, i.e. the axial spacing between consecutive adjacent single elongated reinforcing element is substantially constant.<br>
Moreover, the Applicant has found that the preformed, metallic, threadlike elements which are used in the retaining member according to the present invention possess a wide elastic range and a high elongation at break also after vulcanization of the tyre has occured.<br>
Preferably, the bea'd core of the tyre of the present invention is obtained by spirally winding a plurality of rubberized wires (or cords) , each individual wire {or cord) being radially coiled onto itself so as to form a column of radially superimposed wound coils.<br>
Alternatively, said wires, which are radially coiled to form a plurality of axially adjacent columns of radially superimposed wound coils, are substantially free of a rubber coating (i.e. non-rubberized wires are used).<br>
Preferably, said non-rubberized wires have a substantially rectangular cross section comprising two axially extending rectilinear and parallel opposite sides and two radially extending non-rectilinear lateral sides.<br>
Preferably, said non-rectilinear lateral sides are shaped so that, when two wires are radially stacked, their lateral sides form a profile that is complementary to the profile of an axially adjacent wire that can interfit therewith. In such a way, the obtained assembly is such that only a portion of the lateral side of one wire contacts only a portion of the lateral side of the axially adjacent wire. Preferably, the wires have a substantially hexagonal cross section. Such technical solutions are disclosed, for instance, in document US-5,007,471 in the name of the same Applicant.<br>
Preferably, the bead core of the tyre of the present invention has a cross section of a. polygonal shape, as described, for instance in documents US-4,192,368 and US-4,180,116 in the name of the same Applicant.<br>
Alternatively, the bead core of the tyre of the present invention is a single wire bead core.<br>
Alternatively, the bead core of the tyre of the present invention is of the Alderfer structure.<br>
Preferably, the bead core of the tyre of the present invention further comprises a plurality of check elements, for instance in the form of metallic clips or strips, which are periodically applied along the bead core circumference so as to maintain the compactness of the convolutions of the metallic wires forming the bead core.<br>
In the case the bead core of the tyre of the present invention is formed of non-rubberized wires, the bead core further comprises an elastomeric layer which is interposed between the plurality of coils forming the bead core and the retaining member. The presence of said elastomeric layer contributes in increasing the adhesiveness of aaid retaining member to said plurality<br>
of coils of non-rubberzed metallic wires.<br>
Preferably, the wheel rim on which the tyre of the present invention is mounted is provided with bead seats that are inclined at an angle of about 15° with respect to the tyre rotation axis.<br>
Furthermore, it can be noted that, in case the bead core is formed of a plurality of coils of rubberized metallic wires, the geometrical stability of the tyre of the present invention is advantageously increased so that partial curing of the bead core is no more necessary. This inevitably results in a simplification of the tyre manufacturing process and thus in relevant time and costs savings.<br>
Further features and advantages will appear more-clearly with reference to the detailed description of some examples of a tyre according to the present invention. Said description, given hereinbelow, refers to the accompanying drawings which are provided solely by way of a non-limiting example and in which:<br>

In accordance with the embodiment shown in Figure 1, the carcass ply 12 is folded back to the respective bead cores 13 by turning up the carcass ply ends around said bead, cores.<br>
The bead cores 13 are axially spaced from each other and are incorporated in respective beads 14, in a position radially internal to the tyre.<br>
In addition to the bead core 13, the bead 14 further comprises a bead filler 15, in a position radially external to the bead core.<br>
The carcasd ply 12 generally consists of a plurality of reinforcing elements arranged parallel to each other and at least partially coated with a layer of a crosslinked elastomeric material. These reinforcing elements are usually made of steel wires stranded together, coated with a metal alloy (for example copper/zinc, zinc/manganese, zinc/molybdenum/cobalt alloys and the like), or of textile fibres, for example rayon, nylon or polyethylene terephthalate.<br>
Preferably, the carcass is of the radial type and namely incorporates reinforcing cords arranged in a direction substantially perpendicular to the equatorial<br>
plane of the tyre.<br>
The1 tyre 10 comprises, moreover, a tread band 16, located on the crown of said carcass 11, and a pair of axially opposite sidewalls 17, each arranged between the respective bead 14 and the tread band 16.<br>
Between the carcass ply 11'and the tread band 16, the tyre 10 comprises, moreover, a belt structure 18 which, in the example shown in Figure 1, envisages two radially superimposed belt plies 19, 20, two lateral reinforcing strips 21 (only one strip being shown in Figure 1) and a breaker layer 22.<br>
In detail, the belt plies 19, 2, which are radially superimposed on each other, incorporate a plurality of reinforcing cords, which are typically metallic and obliquely oriented with respect to the equatorial plane of the tyre, parallel with each other in each ply and intersecting with those of the adjacent ply.so as to form a predetermined angle with respect to a circumferential direction. Generally, said angle is comprised from about 1"0° to about 40°; preferably, said angle is comprised from about 12° to about 30°.<br>
As mentioned above, the belt structure 18 further comprises two lateral reinforcing strips 21, commonly known as "zero-degree reinforcing strips", radially superimposed on the axially outer edges of the radially external belt layer 20. Said reinforcing strips 21 generally incorporate a plurality of reinforcing elements, typically metal cords with a breakage elongation value of from 3% to 10%, preferably of from 3.5% to 7%. Said reinforcing elements are coated by means of a crosslinked elastomeric material and oriented in a substantially circumferential direction, thus forming an angle of very few degrees (i.e. 0°) with respect to the<br>
equatorial plane of the tire. According to the embodiment shown in Figure I each lateral reinforcing strip 21 is formed of two. radially superimposed layers 21a, 21b. Alternatively/ instead of two lateral reinforcing stripe 21, a continuous reinforcing layer, generally incorporating a plurality of reinforcing elements of the same kind disclosed above, which extends along the whole axial development of said belt structure may be present (not shown in Figure 1} .<br>
As mentioned above, the belt structure 18 further comprises a breaker layer 22 which is radially superimposed on the radially external belt layer 20 and interposed between the lateral reinforcing strips 21. Alternatively, the breaker layer extends over the reinforcing strips 21 (said embodiment being not shown in the figures). The breaker Iay6r 22 is provided with reinforcing elements, typically metal cords, that are coated by means of a crosslinked elastomeric material and arranged parallel to one another and inclined with respect to the equatorial plane of the tire by an angle of from 10° to 70°, preferably of from 12° to 40'°. The breaker layer 22 acts as a protection layer from stones or gravel possibly entrapped into the tread grooves and which may cause damages to the belt layers 19, 20 and even to the carcass ply 12.<br>
Alternatively (said embodiment being not shown), the belt structure envisages three radially superimposed belt plies and a breaker layer in a position radially external to said superimposed belt plies.<br>
Alternatively (said embodiment being not shown), the belt structure envisages two radially superimposed belt plies, one zero-degree lateral reinforcing strip that is radially superimposed on the axially outer edge of the<br>
radially external belt ply and a breaker layer in a position radially external to said reinforcing strip and the radially external belt ply (the breaker layer can only partially overlap the lateral reinforcing strip).<br>
In the case of tubeless tyres, in a position radially internal to said carcass ply 12, a rubberized layer 23, the so-called "liner", is also envisaged, said layer being able to provide the tyre 10, during use, with the necessary impermeability to air.<br>
Moreover, an antiabrasive strip 24 is usually placed in ah axially external position relative to the carcass back-fold. .<br>
According to the embodiment shown in Figure l, the bead core 13 is obtained by winding a plurality of non-rubberized wires 25, each wire being radially wound to form a column of radially superimposed coils. In Figure 1, seven wires 25 are used (so that seven axially adjacent columns are formed), each wire being spirally wound to form six radially superimposed coils.<br>
According to the present invention, the bead core 13 comprises a retaining member 26 which envelopes the plurality of coils of metallic wires forming the bead core. The retaining member comprises a. plurality of mutually substantially parallel elongated reinforcing elements 27 which comprise at least one preformed threadlike metallic element.<br>
Preferably, the bead core 13 further comprises an elastomeric layer (not shown in the figures) which is interposed between the plurality of coils forming the bead core and the retaining member 26.<br>
Alternatively, said elastomeric layer is not present. In this- case, the elastomeric material - into which the elongated reinforcing elements 27 are embedded<br>
to form the retaining member 26 - preferably comprises an adhesion promoting additive so that the retaining member suitably envelopes and adheres to the metallic wires (which are preferably zinc• plated) the coils of which form the bead core 13. Preferably, said adhesion promoting additive is selected from:<br>
salts of bivalent cobalt which may be selected from carboxylate compounds of formula (R-CO-OJsCo wherein R is a C«-C24 aliphatic or aromatic group such as, for example, cobalt neodecanoate;<br>
organometallic complex based on boron and cobalt, the latter being linked together through oxygen (for example, the complex known under the tradename of Manobond® 680C from OMG group);<br>
resorcinol/hexamethoxymethylenemelamine (fiMMM) system or resorcinol/hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) system;<br>
or mixtures thereof. Preferably, a mixture of an organometallic complex based on boron and cobalt with a resorcinol/hexamethoxymethylenemelamine (HMMM) system is used.<br>
Preferably, said adhesion promoting additive is present in the elastomeric composition in an amount of from 0.2 phr to 3 phr, preferably of from 0.5 phr to 2.5 phr.<br>
According to the embodiment of Figure 1, the tyre of the present invention further comprises a reinforcing layer 28 which is generally known with the term of "chafer" and which has the function of increasing the bead stiffness. <br>
The chafer 28 comprises a plurality of elongated reinforcing elements which are embedded in an elastomeric matrix and which are generally made of textile materials (e.g. aramide or ryon) or metallic materials (e.g. steel<br>
cord).<br>
According to the present invention, preferably the chafer is provided with metallic elongated reinforcing elements which comprise preformed threadlike elements of small diameter, as described above with reference to the retaining member 26.<br>
The chafer can be located in a plurality of positions inside of the tyre bead and/or sidewall. According to the embodiment shown in Figure 1, the chafer 28 is located in a position axially external with respect to the carcass ply 12. In case the tyre is provided with two carcass plies, the chafer can be positioned between said carcass plies. Preferably, the chafer starts in correspondence of the radially external portion of the bead core, it follows the perimetral profile of the bead filler and ends in correspondence of the tyre sidewall. Alternatively, the chafer can extend along the tyre sidewall, up to the ends of the tyre belt structure.<br>
According to the embodiment shown in Figure 1, the retaining member 26 is in the form of a continuous strip consisting of an elastomeric material into which the elongated reinforcing elements are embedded, said strip being spirally wound around the plurality of coils of metallic wires that form the bead core so as to completely envelope said coils along the circumferential outer  profile  thereof.  Preferably,  said winding  is carried out in such a way that a partial overlapping of axially adjacent coils is obtained, as shown in Figure 3. Figure 2 shows a partial cross-sectional view of a truck tyre 20 similar to that of Figure 1. Therefore, for simplicity of description, the components of Figure 2 which are similar or identical with respect to those of Figure 1 will be addressed to in the description with the<br>
same reference signs. The only difference of tyre 20 shown in Figure 2 with respect to tyre 10 shown in Figure 1 consists in that the retaining member 26 is applied in the form of a sheet  (said sheet consisting of an elastomeric material into which the elongated reinforcing elements are embedded), said sheet being folded about the circumferential outer profile of the plurality of coils of metallic wires forming the bead core. Preferably, the step of folding is carried out so that a partial overlapping of the  lateral  edges of  the sheet  is obtained, as shown in Figure 4. According to a further embodiment (not shown), said sheet is folded at least twice about the circumferential outer profile of the plurality of coils of metallic wires forming the bead core.<br>
Figure 5 shows a threadlike element 200 which is sinusoidally preformed in accordance with the present invention.<br>

Even more preferably, said deformations consist of substantially sinusoidal undulations (such as those illustrated in Fig. 5) having a wavelength (or pitch) P and a wave amplitude H.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, "wavelength P" is to be understood as the length of the minimum section which is repeated periodically, and "wave amplitude H" is to be understood as meaning twice the amplitude of maximum transverse deviation (assumed to be equal in both directions) of the threadlike element from the centre axis S (see Figure 5).<br>

Said breaking strength values depend in particular on the quantity of carbon contained in the steel.<br>
Generally, said threadlike elements are provided with a brass coating (Cu of between 60% and 75% by weight, Zn of between 40% and 25% by weight) , having a thickness of between 0.10 fim and 0.50 |im. Said coating ensures better adhesion of the threadlike element to the rubberizing compound and provides for protection against corrosion of the metal, both during production of the<br>
tyre and during use thereof.  Should it be necessary to ensure a greater degree of protection against corrosion, said threadlike elements may be advantageously provided with an anti-corrosive coating other than brass, able to ensure a greater corrosion resistance,  such as,  for example, a coating based on zinc, zinc/manganese (ZnMn) alloys,     zinc/cobalt     (ZnCo)     alloys     or zihc/cobalt/manganese (ZnCoMn) alloys.<br>
Preferably the retaining member according to the present invention is obtained by using cords having a structure of the type n x D, where n is the number of threadlike elements forming the cord and D is the diameter of each threadlike element.

For further description of the invention, an illustrative example is given below.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Two typologies of tyres (tyre A and tyre B) , having size 315/80 R22.5, were manufactured.<br>
Tyres A and B had identical structural elements, i.e. identical carcass (one carcass ply), two crossed belt plies, two lateral reinforcing strips (zero-degree reinforcing strips, positioned radially external to the crossed belt plies and formed of two radially superimposed layers, as shown in Figures 1 and 2) , a breaker layer (which is radially superimposed on the radially external belt layer and interposed between the lateral reinforcing strips), identical tread band.<br>
Tyre A (tyre according to the present invention) further comprised a bead core as that shown in Figure 2, i.e. a bead core which was obtained by spirally winding seven  non -rubberized  wires  (each  wire  having  a substantially hexagonal cross section and being made of zinc plated HT steel material) to form seven axially adjacent  columns,  each column being formed of six radially superimposed coils. According to the present invention, the bead core further comprised a retaining member which was applied in the form of a sheet by folding  the  latter about  the  circumferential  outer profile of the plurality of coils of metallic wires forming the bead core . The folding step was carried out in such a way that a partial overlapping of the lateral edges of the sheet was obtained, as shown in Figure 4. The retaining member consisted of an elastomeric material into which  the  elongated reinforcing  elements were embedded, each elongated reinforcing element consisting of a 3x0.12 HT steel cord (i.e. a cord formed of three HT steel wires having a diameter of 0.12 mm). Each wire of<br>
the cord was preformed according to a substantially sinusoidal undulation (as shown in Figure 5) having a wavelength (pitch) of 2.200 mm and a wave amplitude of 0.345 mm. The elongated reinforcing elements in the retaining member were disposed at an angle, relative to a radial plane of the tyre, of about 45°. The density of the elongated reinforcing elements in the retaining member was of 105 cords/dm and the thickness of said .member - i.e. the total thickness including the diameter of the cord and the rubber compound into which the cord was embedded - was of about 0.95 mm.<br>
Tyre B (comparative) further cbmprised a bead core similar to the bead core of tyre A, the only difference being that the retaining member consisted of an elastomeric material into which textile elongated reinforcing elements were embedded. In detail, the elongated reinforcing elements consisted of Nylon 940x2, i.e. a cord formed of two filaments, each filament having<br><br>
a count of 940 dTex (dTex is the weight in grams corresponding to 10,000 m of fiber) and a twist of. 48 tpm (turn per meter) . The cord twist was of 48 tpm. The elongated reinforcing elements in the retaining member were disposed at an angle, relative to a radial plane of the tyre, of about 45°. The density of the elongated reinforcing elements in the retaining member was of 68 cords/dm and the thickness of said member - i.e. the total thickness including the diameter of the cord and the rubber compound into which the cord was embedded -was of about 0.88 mm.<br>
Indoor testings were carried out on three tyres A and three tyres B so that an average value of the tests results could be calculated.<br>
a)  Truck tyre bead fatigue stress teat<br>
The tyres were mounted on a 9.00" wheel rim and inflated at a pressure of 135 psi (9.5 bar). The tyres were subjected to a load of 9,220 kgf, i.e. to an overload of 240% with respect to the tyre load capacity. Successively the tyres were rotated on a road wheel at a fixed and controlled speed of 20 km/h. The test was stopped when the tyres came to a failure and the time, at which the tyre failure occurred, was detected.<br>
The results are summarized in Table 1 from which it can be pointed out that the fatigue stress is incremented of more than 19% for the tyre A of the present invention with respect to the comparative tyre B. Such a result shows that the tyre of the present invention provides a better geometrical stability and an increased bead integrity during use in comparison with conventional tyres.<br>
Table 1<br><br><br>
(Table Removed1)<br>
b)  Tyre burst test<br>
The tyres, loaded with the nominal operating load and mounted on the respective wheel rim, were progressively inflated with water. The<br><br>
test was stopped when the tyre burst or when the tyre bead slipped off the rim and the time, at which said phenomena occurred, was detected. The results are summarized in Table 2 from which it can be pointed out that tyre burst . is incremented of more than 7% for the tyre A of the present invention with respect to the. comparative tyre B. Such a result shows that the compactness as well as the resistance to local deformations of the bead core of the tyre 6f the present invention is increased with respect to those of conventional tyres.<br>
