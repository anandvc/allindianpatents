The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which It is to be performed:<br><br><br>
Technical Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to substituted benzotriazoles and its use as UV-absorbers in paints, polymers, plastic etc. This invention further relates to a process for preparation of substituted benzotriazoles.<br>
Background and Prior Art:<br>
Polymeric materials are gradually degraded when exposed to sunlight due to photo-oxidation reaction, leading to their short service life. In the photo-oxidation reaction when polymeric materials are exposed to UV rays, it leads to formation of free radicals on the polymer chain. These free radicals react with atmospheric oxygen and give peroxide which further decomposes to form carbonyl groups and chain scission. Irradiation in absence of oxygen causes the increase in crosslinking. This affects the mechanical properties and colour of the polymeric materials. To prevent or retard the photo-oxidation, stabilizers are added to the plastic.<br>
Stabilizers such as UV-absorbers, UV-stabilizers, light stabilizers etc. are employed to combat photo-oxidation in polymers. Among the various stabilizers, UV-absorbers, hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS) are outstandingly effective in extending the outdoor ageing life of polymers such as polyolefin, polyurethane, poly vinyl chloride in various applications like plastics, coatings. It is well known that HALS are the most effective light stabilizers on which extensive research and reviews have been published. UV-absorbers are the compounds, which upon addition to the polymers are capable of preventing or retarding the degradation reactions caused by light energy. Commercially 2-Hydrox\ phenyl benzotriazoles are one of the most important UV-absorbers. Hydroxyphenyl benzotriazoles monomers may be prepared by any method known in the art including those disclosed in US 5,104,992; US 4,943,637 and US 5,097,041. 2-AryI-2H-benzotriazoIes monomers may be prepared by reducing o-nitroazobenzenes through a 2-phenyibenzotriazoie-N-oxide intermediate. Reduction of o-nitroazobenzenes to 2-phenyibenzotriazoic by zinc in presence of sodium hydroxide is disclosed in U.S. Pat.<br><br><br>
Nos. 3,018,269; 3,773,751; 4,041,044 and 4,224,451. Aldehyde reducing agents and aromatic ketone catalysts are disclosed in U.S. 4,835,284. Different UV- absorbers are needed for stabilization of different systems; therefore novel UV-absorbers are very essential.<br>
UV-absorbers arc still widely used because of their low cost and effectiveness. There are five different types of UV-absorbers that have been used in industry, 2-phenyl benzotriazole deri\atives, especially those having lower alkyl substituents and also hydroxy substituents in the ortho position, on the phenyl moiety.<br>
US 4,315.848 describes the combination of the benzotriazole UV- absorber with a HALS which is efficacious in protecting thermoset and thermoplastic acrylic resin automotive finishes and enamels. More specifically benzotriazole described here is 2[2-hydroxy-3,5-di-(a, a-dimethyl benzyl)phenyl ]-2H benzotriazole which has good resistance for light induced deterioration, loss by volatilization on extrudation during high temperature processing of stabilized compositions.<br>
WO 9009369 discloses hydrazide functionalized benzotriazole and oxanilide UV light absorber for stabilized co-reactive or inert polymeric compositions and novel intermediates for the same.<br>
US 6,284.895 particularly describes bromo functionalized benzotriazole UV- absorber. US 6,353.113 discloses process for preparing 2H-benzotriazole UV- absorbers containing a perfluoroalkyl moiety at the 5l position of the benzo ring. Disclosed process comprises diazotization using concentrated sulfuric acid and sodium nitrite or preferably nitrosyl sulfuric acid and the diazonium salt is reduced by conventional reduction means. Patent published application US 2003/0,130,524 describes a novel one pot multiphase reaction for preparation of 2(2-nitrophenyl azo) substituted phenols, which are precursors for 2H-benzotriazole UV-absorbers.<br><br><br>
This present invention is aimed to prepare and evaluate 2-(5-Benzoyl-2H-benzotriazol-2yl)-4methyl phenol (PC), 2-(5-Benzoyl-2H-benzotriazol-2yl)-4,6-dimethyl phenol (XY) and 2-(5-Benzoyl-2H-benzotriazol-2yl)-naphthol (BN) as UV-absorbers in paints.<br>

Analysis<br>
UV spectra were recorded using a UV spectrophotometer (Jasco V530). Water and Acetone mixture (8:2) was used as a solvent. IR spectra were recorded using an IR spectrophotometer (Buck IR Model 500). From the UV spectra (Figure No. 1, 2 and 3) of the products (BN. PC and XY) shows the UV absorption at 340nm and the complete cut off in the range at 293-190 nm, which represents the most harmful range of UV radiation for polymers. It is anticipated that this structure can effectively protect the paint coating against photo-oxidation by the mechanisms of screening action and rapid tautomerism. Testing for evalualion ufUV-absorbers<br>
The UV-absorbers so prepared were incorporated in the paint at different concentration such as 10. 100. 200 and 300 ppm and the paint was applied on the aluminium panels by brush. The gloss of the panels was measured at 45° and 60° angle of incidence (ISO 2813) using BYK. Glossometer. Whiteness and yellowness of the panels were determined by Gretag Macbeth make spectrometer CE7000 (optiview propalette 2.0e). In the assessment of ueatherability, the panels were exposed to the accelerated weather in QUV<br>
9<br><br>
apparatus (Model QUV/Basic). The panels were exposed to the cycle of UV light and humidity. In a typical cycle, exposure to UV light was at 45°C for 4 hours and exposure to humid conditions was at 45°C for 4 hours. The panels were subjected to ageing for 500<br>
hours.<br>
The structures of the prepared compounds are as shown below<br><br>
Where, R= alkyl, aryl and alkylaryl<br>
From the I'Y-ubsorpiion spectra (Figure No.l, 2 and 3) of all the compounds show a complete cut off below 380 nm in water and acetone (8:2) as solvent at 250 ppm concentration. The most harmful wavelength range of UV is 200-330 (QUV C and QUV B). Total opaeii} in this range indicated a good possibility of these products acting as protective agents for coatings.<br>

The results are shown in figure No. 4, 5, 6 and 7. From the graph it is clearly seen that,<br>
before exposure the gloss of the standard panel was much higher than those panels<br>
containing prepared UV-absorbers and blank panels at all ppm levels. After 100 hrs<br>
exposure, the gloss of the blank panel was lower than the other panels containing UV<br>
absorbers &amp; standard. After 200 hrs, the standard panel showed relatively higher drop in<br>
gloss at 100 ppm level. Where as after 200 hrs the gloss of the standard panel was lower<br>
than the others at all ppm level except 100 ppm. After 300 hrs, the gloss of the panels<br>
containing UV-absorbers did not change much as compared to blank and standard.<br>

The data obtained is shown graphically in figure No. 8, 9, 10 and 11. From the graph it is<br>
clearly seen that, before exposure the gloss of the standard panel was higher than the<br><br><br>
other panels. After 100 hrs the gloss of the panels containing the standard, PC was higher than those of Blank XT and BN at all concentration levels except 10 ppm. After 200 to 500 hrs panels containing UV-absorbers show better gloss than Blank and standard.<br>
Yellowness and Whiteness<br>
Effect of UV-absorbers (at 10. 100, 200, 300 ppm) on Yellowness<br>
The results obtained are shown in figure No. 12, 13, 14 and 15. Before and after the<br>
exposure, yellowness of the panels containing UV-absorbers is lower than the standard<br>
and blank panels at all concentration levels while after 300, 400 and 500 hrs of exposure<br>
the yellowness of the Blank was much higher than the rest.<br>

Similariy Numbers 96, 103, 110 and 117 represent whiteness measured for PC and no. 97, 104, 111 and 118 are for XY at 10, 100, 200 and 300 ppm concentration respectively. Before exposure the whiteness of the standard panel was lower than the others. At all concentration levels after exposure and before exposure the whiteness of the panels containing UV-absorber was better than the others.<br>
Prepared benzotriazole based UV-absorbers showed higher initial whiteness than standard stabilizer. As compared to standard stabilizers prepared UV-absorbers showed an increase in &gt;ellowness initially. The protective ability of prepared UV-absorber is retained even after 200 hrs whereas the standard stabilizer failed. Gloss values of the paints did not show any particular trend but the values at 45° angle remained constant after 300hrs at all concentrations.<br><br><br>
