				<td>OPHTHALMIC PREPARATIONS<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims priority to US Patent Application No. 12/007,902 filed<br>
January 16, 2008, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its<br>
entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The invention is directed to ophthalmic formulations, methods for preparing the<br>
ophthalmic formulation, and methods of using the ophthalmic formulation.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] Most ocular medications may be administered topically to treat surface as well as<br>
intraocular disorders. This route is often preferred for the management of various<br>
pathological diseases that affect the anterior chamber of the eye, for two main reasons: (1)<br>
it is more conveniently administered and (2) provides a higher ratio of ocular to systemic<br>
drug levels. To be administered topically and to achieve the necessary patient compliance,<br>
the medication must present a good local tolerance.<br>
[0004] Cyclosporine is a known immunosuppressant, which acts by reducing<br>
inflammatory cells such as activated lymphocytes in the conjunctiva (Kunert et al., Arch<br>
Ophthalmol., 118:1489-96, 2000) or by increasing the number of mucin secreting goblet<br>
cells (Kunert et al., Arch Ophthalmol., 120:330-7, 2002). Over the years, Cyclosporine A<br>
(CsA) has been evaluated for numerous potential applications in ophthalmology.<br>
[0005] New developments in the topical delivery of CsA can be divided in two general<br>
areas of research: new delivery systems, such as solutions, ointments, colloidal carriers<br>
and drug impregnated contact lenses, and chemical modifications of drugs or prodrugs.<br>
[0006] At the present time, only one ophthalmic formulation of CsA is commercially<br>
available, which is currently marketed as Restasis®. The extensive literature on the<br>
delivery of CsA to the eye (Lallemand et al., European Journal of Pharmaceutics and<br>
Biopharmaceutics 56: 307-318, 2003; Nussenblatt et al., Am. J. Ophthalmol. 112: 138-<br>
146, 1991; Masuda et al, Lancet 1: 1093-1096,1989; Georganas etai, Clin. Rheumatol.<br>
15: 189-192, 1996; Prummel etai, N. Engl. J. Med. 321: 1353-1359, 1989; Reinhard et<br>
al, Ophthalmologe 94: 496-500, 1997) reflects the great medical interest and the<br>
pharmaco-economical aspects of this challenge. Despite a poor intraocular penetration,<br>
topical CsA has been successfully used in a variety of immune-mediated ocular surface<br>
phenomena such as vernal conjunctivitis, dry eye syndrome and the prevention of corneal<br>
allograft rejection. For example, Cross et al. reported that topical cyclosporine eye drop<br>
therapy not only improved the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease, but also resulted in<br>
high patient satisfaction, fewer patients with chronic dry eye visiting the ophthalmologist,<br>
and less ancillary drug use (Manag. Care Interface 2002;15:44-49).<br>
[0007] One obstacle to preparing an ophthalmic CsA formulation is that CsA cannot be<br>
prepared in formulations based on the commonly used aqueous ophthalmic vehicles<br>
because of both its hydrophobicity (log P = 3.0) and its extremely low aqueous solubility<br>
at 6.6 mg/ml. Therefore, in most studies, CsA was dissolved and administered in<br>
vegetable oils. However, these media are poorly tolerated, resulting in relatively low<br>
ocular availability. Also, formulations prepared in these media have short shelf lives.<br>
[0008] Oil-in-water emulsions are particularly useful in the delivery of lipophilic drugs.<br>
In vivo data from early studies confirmed that emulsions could be effective topical<br>
ophthalmic drug delivery systems, with a potential for sustained drug release.<br>
[0009] The product currently on the market, Restasis®, is packaged in single unit doses<br>
to avoid microbial contamination because it does not contain any preservatives. It would<br>
be highly desired to have a preparation to be dispensed in a multi-dose container.<br>
[0010] Therefore, there is a need for an ideal topical ocular formulation of CsA, which<br>
fulfills several requirements: (1) the formulation must be well tolerated, or non-irritating<br>
to the eye, (2) the formulation must be easy to administer, (3) the formulation ideally has<br>
an increased CsA residence time in the eye, (4) systemic absorption of the formulation<br>
should be avoided because the toxic CsA concentration in blood is above 300 ng/ml, (5)<br>
the formulation should have a long shelf life, and (6) the formulation should be easily<br>
manufactured.<br>
[0011] The present invention satisfies the needs in the field by providing stable, non-<br>
irritating emulsion formulations of CsA suitable for ophthalmic application, and methods<br>
for preparing and using the formulations.<br>

stabilized particulate cyclosporine or a derivative thereof in water or buffer.<br>
[0015] Another aspect of the invention is directed to an opthalmic cyclosporine<br>
composition which is cationic. The cationic nature of the formulation results in an<br>
increased residency in the eye, producing a more effective dosage form. The cationic<br>
nature of the dosage form can result, for example, from the inclusion of a cationic<br>
preservative.<br>
[0016] In yet another embodiment, the formulation comprises globules of oil comprising<br>

190 nm, less than about 180 nm, less than about 170 nm, less than about 160 nm, less than<br>
about 150 nm, less than about 140 nm, less than about 130 nm, less than about 120 nm,<br>
less than about 110 nm, less than about 100 nm, less than about 90 nm, less than about 80<br>
nm, less than about 70 nm, less than about 60 nm, less than about 50 nm, less than about<br>
40 nm, less than about 30 nm, less than about 20 nm, or less than about 10 nm.<br>

[0020] In one embodiment of the invention, the ophthalmic formulations of the<br>
invention have anti-microbial properties. In some embodiments, the formulation<br>
comprises a preservative suitable for opthalmic administration. Examples of such a<br>
preservative include, but are not limited to, quaternary ammonium compounds, such as<br>

Optionally, the emulsion base of step (a) further comprises a viscosity modifier, such as a<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
A. Overview of the Invention<br>
[0031] The invention relates to ophthalmic formulations comprising cyclosporine or a<br>
derivative thereof and methods of making and using the same. One aspect of the present<br>
invention is directed to an ophthalmic formulation comprising: (a) cyclosporine or a<br>
derivative thereof, (b) at lest one solvent, (c) at least one oil, (d) at least one surfactant, (e)<br>
at least one preservative, and (f) water or buffer. In one embodiment, the cyclosporine<br>
(Cs) or a derivative thereof can be present in (a) a solid nanoparticulate state; (b) a solid<br>
microparticulate state; (c) solubilized; or (d) any combination thereof. In another<br>
embodiment, the ophthalmic formulation further comprises a viscosity modifier, such as a<br>
cellulose derivative, a polysaccharide or a synthetic polymer.<br>
[0032] The cyclosporine can be, for example, cyclosporine A, and the cyclosporine or a<br>
derivative thereof can be in an amorphous form, semi- amorphous form, crystalline form,<br>
semi-crystalline form, or any combination thereof.<br>
[0033] In one embodiment of the invention, the opthalmic cyclosporine composition is<br>
cationic. The cationic nature of the formulation can result in an increased residency in the<br>
eye, producing a more effective dosage form. Moreover, the increased residency in the<br>
eye can result in a need for fewer applications, a decreased drug dosage for effectiveness,<br>
and increased patient compliance (as fewer applications are desirable to patients). The<br>
cationic nature of the dosage form can result, for example, from the inclusion of a cationic<br>
preservative. An exemplary cationic preservative is benzalkonium chloride.<br>
[0034] In another embodiment of the invention, the formulation is a mixture of particles<br>
of cyclosporine or a derivative thereof suspended in emulsion droplets and sterically<br>
stabilized particulate cyclosporine or a derivative thereof in water or buffer.<br>
[0035] Another aspect of the invention encompasses a method of making a tri-phasic<br>
composition comprising a lipophilic phase, water or a buffer, and particulate cyclosporine<br>
or a derivative thereof. The invention also encompasses compositions comprising an oil<br>
phase that has at least one oil, at least one solvent, and a surfactant for cyclosporine or a<br>
derivative thereof. Two specific methods of making the composition of the invention are<br>
described. In the first method ("Route I"), cyclosporine or a derivative thereof is milled in<br>
an emulsion base. This method requires that cyclosporine or a derivative thereof is poorly<br>
soluble or insoluble in all phases of the oil phase/lipophilic phase and the water or buffer.<br>
In die second method ("Route II"), simultaneous milling and precipitation of cyclosporine<br>
or a derivative thereof in an emulsion base is observed. The second method requires mat<br>
cyclosporine or a derivative thereof is soluble or partially soluble in one or more phases of<br>
the emulsion base.<br>
[0036] One benefit of the invention is to provide a method applicable to cyclosporine or<br>
a derivative thereof, which is poorly water-soluble, since the conventional method, such as<br>
wet milling, is not effective. Another benefit of the invention is that it does not require<br>
grinding media or specialized grinding process or equipment. The use of such grinding<br>
media can add cost and complexity to a particle size reduction process for cyclosporine.<br>
[0037] For Route I, cyclosporine or a derivative thereof is first suspended in a mixture of<br>
a non-miscible liquid, such as an oil, solvent, preservative and water or buffer, to form an<br>
emulsion base, followed by homogenization or vigorous stirring of the emulsion base.<br>
Optionally, the emulsion base further comprises a viscosity modifier, such as a cellulose<br>
derivative, a polysaccharide or a synthetic polymer. Nanoparticles can be produced with<br>
reciprocating syringe instrumentation, continuous flow instrumentation, or high speed<br>
mixing equipment. High velocity homogenization or vigorous stirring, producing forces<br>
of high shear and cavitation, are preferred. High shear processes are preferred as low<br>
shear processes can result in larger particle sizes of cyclosporine or a derivative thereof.<br>
The resultant composition is a composite mixture of cyclosporine or a derivative thereof<br>
suspended in the emulsion droplet (nanoemulsion fraction) and sterically stabilized micro-<br>
/nano-crystalline cyclosporine or a derivative thereof in the media. This tri-phasic system<br>
comprises particulate cyclosporine or a derivative thereof, oil, preservative, and water or<br>
buffer. Preferably, the resultant micro/nano-particulate cyclosporine or a derivative<br>
thereof has a mean particle size of less than about 3 microns. Smaller particulate<br>
cyclosporine or a derivative thereof can also be obtained, as described below.<br>
[0038] Cyclosporine or a derivative thereof can be precipitated out from the oil droplets<br>
by adding more of the non-miscible liquid. The precipitated cyclosporine or a derivative<br>
thereof typically has a mean particle size of less than about 3 microns. If desired, the<br>
particles of cyclosporine or a derivative thereof can be prevented from aggregating or<br>
clumping together by incorporating a surfactant or emulsifier, e.g., a "surface stabilizer."<br>
[0039] Route II is utilized for cyclosporine or a derivative thereof because it is soluble in<br>
at least one part of the emulsion base, such as the solvent, in particular, ethanol. For Route<br>
II, cyclosporine or a derivative thereof is dissolved in a mixture of oil, solvent, and<br>
surfactant to form an emulsion pre-mix. Cyclosporine or a derivative thereof remains in<br>
soluble form if preservative and water or buffer are not added to the mixture. Upon the<br>
addition of preservative, a viscosity modifier, and water or buffer and the application of<br>
shear forces, cyclosporine or a derivative thereof is precipitated into micro/nano-particles<br>
having a mean particle size of less than about 3 microns. Nanoparticles can be produced<br>
with reciprocating syringe instrumentation, continuous flow instrumentation, or high speed<br>
mixing equipment. High energy input, through high velocity homogenization or vigorous<br>
stirring, is a preferred process. The high energy processes reduce the size of the emulsion<br>
droplets, thereby exposing a large surface area to the surrounding aqueous environment.<br>
High shear processes are preferred, as low shear processes can result in larger particle<br>
sizes. This is followed by precipitation of nanoparticulate cyclosporine or a derivative<br>
thereof previously embedded in the emulsion base. The end product comprises<br>
cyclosporine or a derivative thereof in solution and particulate suspension, both distributed<br>
between the solvent, oil, preservative, and water or buffer. Nanoparticulate cyclosporine<br>
or a derivative thereof has at least one surface stabilizer associated with the surface<br>
thereof.<br>
[0040] If desired, the water miscible oil droplets and nanoparticles of cyclosporine or a<br>
derivative thereof prepared using Route I or Route II may be filtered through either a 0.2<br>
or 0.45 micron filter. Larger oil droplets and/or particles of cyclosporine or a derivative<br>
thereof can be created by simply increasing the water content, decreasing the oil-stabilizer-<br>
solvent content, or reducing the shear in forming the oil droplets.<br>
[0041] For the 50X concentrated emulsion base used in Route I or Route II, the content<br>
of cyclosporine is about 0.1%-10%, the content of solvent is about 0.1%-20%, the content<br>
of oil is about 5%-50%, the content of surfactant is about 0.1%-20%, the content of<br>
preservative is about 0.1 %-5%, and the content of the aqueous medium is about 20%-80%,<br>
all in w/w percentage. Optionally, the viscosity modifier is present in the emulsion base in<br>
the amount of about 0.1% to about 10% (w/w). The content of each ingredient in the final<br>
product is the amount above divided by 50, with the aqueous medium being the major<br>
component, at about 98% or more.<br>
B. Definitions<br>
[0042] The present invention is described herein using several definitions, as set forth<br>
below and throughout the application.<br>
[0043] As used herein, "about" will be understood by persons of ordinary skill in the art<br>
and will vary to some extent depending upon the context in which it is used. If there are<br>
uses of the term which are not clear to persons of ordinary skill in the art given the context<br>
in which it is used, "about" will mean up to plus or minus 10% of the particular term.<br>
[0044] The phrase "poorly water-soluble" or "water insoluble" as used herein refers to a<br>
solubility in water of less than about 30 mg/mL, less than about 20 mg/mL, less than about<br>
10 mg/mL, less than about 1 mg/mL, less than about 0.1 mg/mL, less than about 0.01<br>
mg/mL or less than about 0.001 mg/mL at ambient temperature and pressure and at about<br>
pH7.<br>
[0045] The phrase "soluble" as used herein refers to a solubility in water or another<br>
medium selected from the group consisting of greater than about 10 mg/mL, greater than<br>
about 20 mg/mL, and greater than about 30 mg/mL.<br>
[0046] As used herein, the term "subject" is used to mean an animal, preferably a<br>
mammal, including a human or non-human. The terms "patient" and "subject" may be<br>
used interchangeably.<br>
[0047] As used herein, the phrase "therapeutically effective amount" shall mean that<br>
drug dosage that provides the specific pharmacological response for which the drug is<br>
administered in a significant number of subjects in need of such treatment. It is<br>
emphasized that a therapeutically effective amount of a drug that is administered to a<br>
particular subject in a particular instance will not always be effective in treating the<br>
conditions/diseases described herein, even though such dosage is deemed to be a<br>
therapeutically effective amount by those of skill in the art.<br>
[0048] As used herein, the phrase "cyclosporines and derivatives thereof include a<br>
group of nonpolar cyclic oligopeptides with known immunosuppressant activity, as<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,474,979, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
In addition to the most common form of cyclosporine A, there are several other minor<br>
metabolites, cyclosporine B through I, identified. The present invention intends to include<br>
any individual member of the cyclosporine family, as well as a mixture of two or more<br>
members of the family, because the commercial cyclosporines may contain a mixture of<br>
several forms of cyclosporines, which all share a cyclic peptide structure consisting of<br>
eleven amino acids with a total molecular weight of about 1200. The cyclosporines and<br>
derivatives thereof also include the natural or synthetic product, as well as any substituents<br>
or different configurations of the amino acids, as long as they maintain the<br>
immunosuppressive activity and capability of enhancing or restoring the lacrimal gland<br>
tearing. The present invention further encompasses the cyclosporine A derivatives, e.g.,<br>
methylthio-substitued cyclosporine A and other alkylthio-substitued cyslosporine A<br>
derivatives, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,254,860 and 6,350,442, each of which is<br>
incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
C. Compositions of the Invention<br>
1. Exemplary Compositions<br>
[0049] The methods of the invention can produce several different types of<br>
compositions. A first composition comprises: (1) microparticulate and/or nanoparticulate<br>
cyclosporine or a derivative thereof having a mean particle size of less than about 10<br>
microns and, optionally for nanoparticulate cyclosporine or a derivative thereof, having<br>
associated with the surface thereof at least one surface stabilizer; (2) at least one<br>
preservative; (3) water or a buffer; and (4) an emulsion pre-mix or oil phase or lipophilic<br>
phase comprising at least one oil and optionally at least one solvent, and/or a viscosity<br>
modifier. The composition may additionally comprise microcrystalline cyclosporine or a<br>
derivative thereof. The particulate cyclosporine or a derivative thereof can be present in<br>
the water or buffer, oil, solvent, preservative, or a combination thereof. Such a<br>
composition is made utilizing Route I.<br>
[0050] A second composition comprises: (1) microparticulate and/or nanoparticulate<br>
cyclosporine or a derivative thereof having a mean particle size of less than about 10<br>
microns and, optionally for nanoparticulate cyclosporine or a derivative thereof having<br>
associated with the surface thereof at least one surface stabilizer; (2) a preservative; (3)<br>
water or a buffer; and (4) an emulsion pre-mix or oil phase or lipophilic phase comprising<br>
at least one oil, optionally at least one solvent, solubilized cyclosporine or a derivative<br>
thereof, and/or a viscosity modifier. The composition may additionally comprise<br>
microcrystalline cyclosporine or a derivative thereof. The solubilized cyclosporine or a<br>
derivative thereof may be present in oil, solvent, or a combination thereof. In addition,<br>
nanoparticulate cyclosporine or a derivative thereof can be present in the water or buffer,<br>
oil, solvent, or a combination thereof. Such a composition is made utilizing Route II.<br>
[0051] In a further embodiment of the invention, the solubilized cyclosporine or a<br>
derivative thereof can be precipitated out from the emulsion droplets. The precipitated<br>
microparticulate cyclosporine or a derivative thereof has a mean particle size of less than<br>
about 10 microns, less than about 9 microns, less than about 8 microns, less than about 7<br>
microns, less than about 6 microns, less than about 5 microns, less than about 4 microns,<br>
less than about 3 microns, less than about 2 microns, or about 1 micron or greater. In<br>
other embodiments of the invention, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about<br>
70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, or at least about 99% of<br>
the particles of cyclosporine or a derivative thereof can have a diameter less than the size<br>
listed above, e.g., less than about 10 microns, less than about 9 microns, etc.<br>
[0052] In yet another embodiments of the invention, the nanoparticles of cyclosporine or<br>
a derivative thereof have a diameter of less than about 1000 nm, less than about 900 nm,<br>
less than about 800 nm, less than about 700 nm, less than about 600 nm, less than about<br>
500 nm, less than about 400 nm, less than about 300 nm, less than about 290 nm, less than<br>
about 280 nm, less than about 270 nm, less than about 260 nm, less than about 250 nm,<br>
less than about 240 nm, less than about 230 nm, less than about 220 nm, less than about<br>
210 nm, less than about 200 nm, less than about 190 nm, less than about 180 nm, less than<br>
about 170 nm, less than about 160 nm, less than about 150 nm, less than about 140 nm,<br>
less than about 130 nm, less than about 120 nm, less than about 110 nm, less than about<br>
100 nm, less than about 90 nm, less than about 80 nm, less than about 70 nm, less than<br>
about 60 nm, less than about 50 nm, less than about 40 nm, less than about 30 nm, less<br>
than about 20 nm, or less than about 10 nm. In other embodiments of the invention, at<br>
least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about<br>
90%, at least about 95%, or at least about 99% of the particles of cyclosporine or a<br>
derivative thereof can have a diameter less than the size listed above, e.g., less than about<br>
1000 nm, less than about 900 nm, etc.<br>
[0053] The tri-phasic compositions of the invention are beneficial for several reasons.<br>
First, formulations resulting from the Route II method comprise both solid and solubilized<br>
forms of cyclosporine or a derivative thereof. This enables a resultant pharmaceutical<br>
formulation to provide both immediate release and controlled release of me component<br>
cyclosporine or a derivative thereof, providing for fast onset of activity combined with<br>
prolonged activity of cyclosporine or a derivative thereof.<br>
[0054] The different components of the two types of compositions described above can<br>
be separated and used independently.<br>
2. Emulsion Globules Comprising Cyclosporine<br>
Nanoparticles and/or Solubilized Cyclosporine<br>
[0055] The emulsion globules comprising solubilized cyclosporine or a derivative<br>
thereof, nanoparticles of cyclosporine or a derivative thereof, or a combination thereof can<br>
also be isolated from the surrounding aqueous or buffer phase and used in therapeutic<br>
dosage forms. The emulsion globules can be made using food grade, USP or NF grade<br>
materials suitable for human use applications. Nanoparticulate oil globules comprising<br>
solubilized active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and methods of making the same are<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 5,629,021 ("the '021 patent"), which is incorporated herein<br>
by reference. The emulsion globules of the invention typically comprise (1) solubilized<br>
cyclosporine or a derivative thereof, particulate cyclosporine or a derivative thereof, or a<br>
combination thereof; (2) at least one oil; (3) at least one solvent; (4) at least one<br>
preservative; and (5) at least one surface stabilizer or surfactant. Optionally, the emulsion<br>
globules further comprises a viscosity modifier, such as a cellulose derivative, a<br>
polysaccharide or a synthetic polymer. Emulsion globules comprising solubilized<br>
cyclosporine or a derivative thereof, particulate cyclosporine or a derivative thereof, or a<br>
combination thereof can be isolated by, for example, filtration.<br>
[0056] In general, the emulsion globules comprising solubilized cyclosporine or a<br>
derivative thereof, nanoparticles of cyclosporine or a derivative thereof, or a combination<br>
thereof comprise a significant quantity of cyclosporine or a derivative thereof and have<br>
diameters of about 10 to about 1000 nm, with a mean a diameter of less than about 1<br>
micron preferred, and with the smallest globules filterable through a 0.2 micron filter, such<br>
as is typically used for microbiological purification. The range of concentration of<br>
cyclosporine or a derivative thereof in the globules in the diluted final product can be from<br>
about 0.01% to about 5%. The emulsion globules can be stored at between about -20°C<br>
and about 40°C. In one embodiment of the invention, at least about 50%, at least about<br>
60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, or at least about 90% of the globules in the<br>
preparation have diameters of less than about 1 micron, less than about 900 nm, less than<br>
about 800 nm, less than about 700 nm, less than about 600 nm, less than about 500 nm,<br>
less than about 400 nm, less than about 300 nm, less than about 200 nm, or less than about<br>
100 nm.<br>
[0057] By varying different parameters of Route I and Route II, the size and integrity of<br>
such globules can be modified. Hence, the stability of globules comprising dissolved<br>
cyclosporine or a derivative thereof can be altered to enable the release of cyclosporine or<br>
a derivative thereof, either as a solution or precipitate. This is a microreservoir-<br>
dissolution-controlled system, where the drug solids act as depot and, as the solubilized<br>
fraction is depleted, more drug is drawn into solution form the particulate depot. Thus, the<br>
emulsion globules comprising solubilized cyclosporine or a derivative thereof enable<br>
controlled cyclosporine or a derivative thereof release over time.<br>
[0058] In addition, the emulsion globules comprising solubilized cyclosporine or a<br>
derivative thereof, nanoparticles of cyclosporine or a derivative thereof, or a combination<br>
thereof can be diluted with aqueous solutions without stability loss. This enables the use<br>
of high concentration of cyclosporine or a derivative thereof, e.g., up to about 10%, in<br>
products which can be diluted to obtain the final product.<br>
[0059] In a preferred embodiment, 50X concentrated cyclosporine formulation<br>
containing 2.5% w/w cyclosporine is manufactured aseptically. The particles of<br>
cyclosporine in the concentrated product have a mean particle size of less than 200 mn.<br>
Subsequently, the concentrated product is diluted with sterile PBS/saline to achieve 0.05%<br>
w/w cyclosporine in the final product, which has similar appearance to Restasis®. The<br>
final product is packaged and sealed in 0.4 ml per dose.<br>
D. Methods of Making the Inventive Compositions<br>
Three methods for making the compositions of the invention are described herein.<br>
One benefit of the invention is to provide methods applicable to cyclosporine or a<br>
derivative thereof, which is poorly water-soluble. Another benefit of the methods of the<br>
invention is that they do not require grinding media or specialized grinding process or<br>
equipments. The use of such grinding media can add cost and complexity to a particle size<br>
reduction process for an API. Additionally, the methods of the invention can<br>
accommodate amorphous or semi-amorphous forms of cyclosporine or a derivative<br>
thereof. In summary, the three methods are as follows: Route I: cyclosporine or a<br>
derivative thereof is iasoluble or slightly soluble in any of the components of the<br>
formulation; Route II: cyclosporine or a derivative thereof is soluble or partially soluble<br>
in at least one of the components of the formulation; and Route III: cyclosporine or a<br>
derivative thereof is completely soluble in all of the components of the formulation.<br>
1. Route I<br>
[0060] The method of Route I essentially comprises milling cyclosporine or a derivative<br>
thereof in an emulsion base. This method requires that cyclosporine or a derivative<br>
thereof is poorly soluble or insoluble in all phases of the oil phase/lipophilic phase and the<br>
water or buffer. Hence, cyclosporine or a derivative thereof is first suspended in a mixture<br>
of a non-miscible liquid, which can comprise at least one oil, at least one solvent, at least<br>
one preservative, at least one viscosity modifier, and at least one buffer or water to form<br>
an emulsion base, followed by homogenization or vigorous stirring of the emulsion base.<br>
Nanoparticles of cyclosporine or a derivative thereof can be produced with reciprocating<br>
syringe instrumentation, continuous flow instrumentation, or high speed mixing<br>
equipment. High velocity homogenization or vigorous stirring, producing forces of high<br>
shear and cavitation, are preferred. High shear processes are preferred as low shear<br>
processes can result in larger particle sizes.<br>
[0061] The resultant composition is a composite mixture of cyclosporine or a derivative<br>
thereof suspended in the emulsion droplet (nanoemulsion fraction of cyclosporine or a<br>
derivative thereof) and sterically stabilized microcrystalline or microparticulate<br>
cyclosporine or a derivative thereof in the media. This tri-phasic system comprises<br>
particulate cyclosporine, oil, preservative and water or buffer.<br>
[0062] In one embodiment of the invention, the resultant microparticulate cyclosporine<br>
or a derivative thereof has a diameter of less than about 10 microns, less than about 9<br>
microns, less than about 8 microns, less than about 7 microns, less than about 6 microns,<br>
less than about 5 microns, less than about 4 microns, less than about 3 microns, less than<br>
about 2 microns, or greater than about 1 micron.<br>
[0063] In another embodiment of the invention, the nanoparticulate cyclosporine or a<br>
derivative thereof can have a diameter of less than about 1000 nm, less than about 900 nm,<br>
less than about 800 nm, less than about 700 nm, less than about 600 nm, less than about<br>
500 nm, less than about 400 nm, less than about 300 nm, less than about 290 nm, less than<br>
about 280 nm, less than about 270 nm, less than about 260 nm, less than about 250 nm,<br>
less than about 240 nm, less than about 230 nm, less than about 220 nm, less than about<br>
210 nm, less than about 200 nm, less than about 190 nm, less than about 180 nm, less than<br>
about 170 nm, less than about 160 nm, less than about 150 nm, less than about 140 nm,<br>
less than about 130 nm, less than about 120 nm, less than about 110 nm, less than about<br>
100 nm, less than about 90 nm, less than about 80 ran, less than about 70 nm, less than<br>
about 60 nm, less than about 50 nm, less than about 40 nm, less than about 30 nm, less<br>
than about 20 nm, or less than about 10 nm.<br>
[0064] In other embodiments of the invention, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at<br>
least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, or at least<br>
about 99% of the microcrystalline or microparticulate cyclosporine or a derivative thereof<br>
in a composition can have a diameter of less than about 10 microns, less than about 9<br>
microns, less than about 8 microns, less than about 7 microns, less than about 6 microns,<br>
less than about 5 microns, less than about 4 microns, less than about 3 microns, less than<br>
about 2 microns, about 1 micron, or greater than about 1 micron and less than about 2,<br>
about 3, about 4, about 5, about 6, about 7, about 8, about 9, or about 10 microns.<br>
[0065] In yet other embodiments of the invention, at least about 50%, at least about<br>
60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, or at<br>
least about 99% of the nanoparticulate cyclosporine or a derivative thereof can have a<br>
diameter of less than about 1000 nm, less than about 900 nm, less than about 800 nm, less<br>
than about 700 nm, less than about 600 nm, less than about 500 nm, less than about 400<br>
nm, less than about 300 nm, less than about 290 nm, less than about 280 nm, less than<br>
about 270 nm, less than about 260 nm, less than about 250 nm, less than about 240 nm,<br>
less than about 230 nm, less than about 220 nm, less than about 210 nm, less than about<br>
200 nm, less than about 190 nm, less than about 180 nm, less than about 170 nm, less than<br>
about 160 nm, less than about 150 nm, less than about 140 nm, less than about 130 nm,<br>
less than about 120 nm, less than about 110 nm, less than about 100 nm, less than about 90<br>
nm, less than about 80 nm, less than about 70 nm, less than about 60 nm, less than about<br>
50 nm, less than about 40 nm, less than about 30 nm, less than about 20 nm, or less than<br>
about 10 nm in size.<br>
[0066] Cyclosporine or a derivative thereof can be precipitated out from the oil droplets<br>
by adding more of the non-miscible liquid. The precipitated particles of cyclosporine or a<br>
derivative thereof typically have a diameter of less than about 10 microns, less than about<br>
9 microns, less than about 8 microns, less than about 7 microns, less than about 6 microns,<br>
less than about 5 microns, less than about 4 microns, less than about 3 microns, less than<br>
about 2 microns, or less than about 1 micron. If desired, the particles cyclosporine or a<br>
derivative thereof can be prevented from aggregating or clumping together by<br>
incorporating a surfactant or emulsifier, e.g., a "surface stabilizer."<br>
2. Route II and Route III<br>
[0067] Routes II and III require that cyclosporine or a derivative thereof is soluble or<br>
partially soluble in at least one (Route II) or all of the phases (Route III) of the emulsion<br>
base; e.g., that cyclosporine or a derivative thereof is soluble in at least one oil, at least one<br>
solvent, at least one preservative, or water or buffer. In some embodiments, Route II or III<br>
can comprise the simultaneous milling and precipitation of cyclosporine or a derivative<br>
thereof in an emulsion base.<br>
[0068] Route II is utilized when cyclosporine or a derivative thereof is soluble in at least<br>
one part of the emulsion base, such as the solvent, and Route III is utilized when<br>
cyclosporine or a derivative thereof is soluble in all of the components of the emulsion<br>
base, such as oil and a solvent. For Routes II and III, cyclosporine or a derivative thereof<br>
is dissolved in a mixture of oil, solvent, preservative, viscosity modifier and stabilizer to<br>
form an emulsion pre-mix. Cyclosporine or a derivative thereof remains in soluble form if<br>
water or buffer is not added to the mixture. Upon the addition of water or buffer and the<br>
application of shear forces, cyclosporine or a derivative thereof is precipitated into<br>
microparticles having a diameter of less than about 10 microns, and nanoparticles having a<br>
diameter of less than about 1 micron (as described above in Route I; the same particle<br>
sizes are applicable to Routes II and HI). Nanoparticles can be produced with<br>
reciprocating syringe instrumentation, continuous flow instrumentation, or high speed<br>
mixing equipment. High energy input, through high velocity homogenization or vigorous<br>
stirring, is a preferred process. The high energy processes reduce the size of the emulsion<br>
droplets, thereby exposing a large surface area to the surrounding aqueous environment.<br>
High shear processes are preferred, as low shear processes can result in larger particle<br>
sizes.<br>
[0069] This can be followed by precipitation of nanoparticulate cyclosporine or a<br>
derivative thereof previously embedded in the emulsion base. The end product comprises<br>
cyclosporine or a derivative thereof in solution and particulate suspension, both distributed<br>
between the solvent, oil, and water or buffer. In one embodiment, nanoparticulate<br>
cyclosporine or a derivative thereof has at least one surface stabilizer associated with the<br>
surface thereof.<br>
[0070] If desired, the water miscible oil droplets and nanoparticles of cyclosporine or a<br>
derivative thereof prepared using Route I, Route II, or Route III may be filtered through<br>
either a 0.2 or 0.45 micron filter. Larger oil droplets and/or particles of cyclosporine or a<br>
derivative thereof can be created by simply increasing the water content, decreasing the<br>
oil-stabilizer-solvent content, or reducing the shear in forming the oil droplets.<br>
[0071] For the 50X concentrated emulsion base used in Route I, Route II, or Route III,<br>
the content of cyclosporine is about 0.1%-10%, the content of solvent is about 0.1%-20%,<br>
the content of oil is about 5%-50%, the content of surfactant is about 0.1%-20%, the<br>
content of preservative is about 0.1%-5%, and the content of the aqueous medium is about<br>
20%-80%, all in w/w percentage. Optionally, the viscosity modifier is present in the<br>
emulsion base in the amount of about 0.1 % to about 10% (w/w). The content of each<br>
ingredient in the final product is the amount above divided by 50, with the aqueous<br>
medium being the major component, at about 98% or more.<br>
E. Components of the Methods and Compositions of the Invention<br>
1. Cyclosporine<br>

The phrase "cyclosporines and derivatives thereof is defined supra, as disclosed<br>
in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,474,979, 6,254,860, and 6,350,442. The cyclosporines useful in the<br>
present invention include naturally occurring cyclosporines, preferably cyclosporines A,<br>

nm, etc.<br>
[0075] In other embodiments of the invention, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at<br>

cyclosporine or a derivative thereof, have a size less than the mean particle size, less than<br>
about 3 microns, less than about 2900 nm, less than about 2800 nm, etc.<br>
2. Oils<br>
[0076] For both the methods of Route I and Route II and the compositions of the<br>
invention, any suitable oil can be used. Exemplary oils that can be used include, for<br>
example, vegetable oils, nut oils, fish oils, lard oil, mineral oils, squalane, tricaprylin, and<br>
mixtures thereof. Specific examples of oils that may be used include, but are not limited<br>
to, almond oil (sweet), apricot seed oil, borage oil, canola oil, coconut oil, com oil, cotton<br>
seed oil, fish oil, jojoba bean oil, lard oil, linseed oil (boiled), Macadamia nut oil, medium<br>

squalene, sunflower seed oil, tricaprylin (1,2,3-trioctanoyl glycerol), wheat germ oil, and<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
3. Stabilizers or Surfactants<br>
[0077] The stabilizer used in the methods and compositions of the invention associates<br>
with, or adsorbs, to the surface of the nanoparticulate cyclosporine or a derivative thereof,<br>
but does not covalently bind to cyclosporine or a derivative thereof. In addition, the<br>
individual stabilizer molecules are preferably free of cross-linkages. The stabilizer is<br>
preferably soluble in water. One or more stabilizers may be used in the compositions and<br>
methods of the invention. As used herein, the terms "stabilizer", "surface stabilizer", and<br>
"surfactant" are used interchangeably.<br>
[0078] Any suitable nonionic or ionic surfactant may be utilized in the compositions of<br>
the invention, including anionic, cationic, and zwitterionic surfactants. Exemplary<br>
stabilizers or surfactants that may be used in both Routes I and II include, but are not<br>
limited to, non-phospholipid surfactants, such as the Tween (polyoxyethylene derivatives<br>
of sorbitan fatty acid esters) family of surfactants {e.g., Tween 20, Tween 60, and Tween<br>
80), nonphenol polyethylene glycol ethers, sorbitan esters (such as Span and Arlacel),<br>
glycerol esters (such as glycerin monostearate), polyethylene glycol esters (such as<br>
polyethylene glycol stearate), block polymers (such as Pluronics®), acrylic polymers (such<br>
as Pemulen®), ethoxylated fatty esters (such as Cremophor® RH-40), ethoxylated alcohols<br>
(such as Brij®), ethoxylated fatty acids, monoglycerides, silicon based surfactants,<br>
polysorbates, Tergitol NP-40 (Poly(oxy-l,2-ethanediyl), a -(4-nonylphenol)-.omega.-<br>
hydroxy, branched [molecular weight average 1980]), and Tergitol NP-70 (a mixed<br>
surfactant-AQ=70%).<br>
4. Solvents<br>
[0079] Any suitable solvent can be used in the methods and compositions of the<br>
invention. Exemplary solvents include, but are not limited, to isopropyl myristate,<br>
triacetin, N-methyl pyrrolidinone, aliphatic or aromatic alcohols, polyethylene glycols,<br>
propylene glycol. An example of an alcohol useful in the present invention includes, but<br>
is not limited to ethanol. Other short chain alcohols and/or amides may be used. Other<br>
solvents include dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethyl acetamide, and ethoxydiglycol. Mixtures of<br>
solvents can also be used in the compositions and methods of the invention.<br>
5. Water or Buffer<br>
[0080] If the methods and/or compositions of the invention use or comprise water or a<br>
buffer, the aqueous solution is preferably a physiologically compatible solution such as<br>
water or phosphate buffered saline.<br>
6. Preservatives<br>
[0081] The formulations of the invention have anti-microbial properties. The anti-<br>
microbial properties can be associated with the formulation. As an example, the<br>
formulations described herein, in the absence of cyclosporine, can exhibit antimicrobial<br>
activity.<br>
[0082] Antimicrobial agents or preservatives are added to nonsterile dosage forms to<br>
protect them from microbiological growth or from microorganisms that are introduced<br>
inadvertently during or subsequent to the manufacturing process. In the case of sterile<br>
articles used in multi-dose containers, antimicrobial preservatives are added to inhibit the<br>
growth of microorganisms that may be introduced by repeatedly withdrawing individual<br>
doses.<br>
[0083] U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines require that antimicrobial<br>
effectiveness, whether inherent in the product (e.g., for an antibiotic agent) or whether<br>
produced because of the addition of an antimicrobial agent, must be demonstrated for all<br>
injections packaged in multiple-dose containers or for other products containing<br>
antimicrobial preservatives. Antimicrobial effectiveness must be demonstrated for<br>
multiple-dose topical and oral dosage forms, and for other dosage forms such as<br>
ophthalmic, otic, nasal, irrigation, and dialysis fluids. See USP 25, Section 51,<br>
"Antimicrobial Effectiveness Testing."<br>
[0084] The formulations of the invention meet the Antimicrobial Effectiveness Test as<br>
described in the United States Pharmacopeia (USP - General Chapter #51). The standard<br>
USP testing requires evaluation in five microorganisms: Aspergillus niger (ATCC<br>
16404), Candida albicans (ATCC 10231), Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739), Pseudomonas<br>
aeruginosa (ATCC 9027) and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538).<br>
[0085] The formulations of the invention comprise preservatives, e.g., water soluble<br>
quaternary ammonium compounds, such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide,<br>
cetylpyridinium chloride, benzethonium chloride, and benzalkonium chloride. Preferably,<br>
the preservative is benzalkonium chloride.<br>
[0086] BKC has been used as a preservative in ophthalmic formulations for many years.<br>
The formulation of the present invention contains BKC at a concentration that is<br>
recognized to be sufficient to qualify the USP Preservative Efficacy testing. There is<br>
sufficient literature evidence available to prove preservative efficacy for BKC used in<br>
ophthalmic formulations (Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 3ri edition (2000),<br>
edited by Arthur H. Kibbe, published by American Pharmaceutical Association and<br>
Pharmaceutical Press, pp. 33-35). Hence, the formulation of the invention is suitable for<br>
multi-dose packaging.<br>
[0087] In the present invention, BKC unexpectedly functions as a cationic agent, which<br>
contributes to the prolonged drug residence time. This property of the compositions of the<br>
invention enable fewer applications of the dosage form to the eye, which is generally<br>
preferred by patient populations. Moreover, the dosage applied is more effective, as the<br>
cationic property of the dosage form results in the drug "adhering" to the eye, rather than<br>
having much of the dosage form run out of the eyes following administration.<br>
[0088] It is believed that the beneficial aspects of the novel opthalmic cyclosporine<br>
compositions of the invention result from a synergistic combination of: (1) particle size of<br>
cyclosporine; (2) potential presence of cyclosporine in both a solubilized and particulate<br>
form in the dosage; (3) the cationic property of the dosage form, and (4) the stable, non-<br>
irritating final product suitable for multi-dose packaging.<br>
[0089] In general, tissues in the body are considered to be negatively charged. As a<br>
result, a positively-charged (cationic) product is considered to have better chance of<br>
improved interaction of the product with the tissue. This improved interaction between<br>
the cationic product and body tissues is not always observed, however.<br>
[0090] Prior art describes that for a biphasic system, oil-soluble cationic lipids, e.g..<br>
stearylamine, has been used to impart a net positive charge onto oil droplet, whereby the<br>
droplet being electrostatically attracted to the anionic surface of the eye. See, for example,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,656,460.<br>
[0091] When water-soluble, quaternary ammonium compounds are used, they will not<br>
impart positive charge on the emulsion. Instead, they are likely to be adsorbed or loosely<br>
bound onto the surface and may result in a charge. Typically, when quaternary<br>
ammonium compounds are used, the acidic pH needs to be maintained for protonation of<br>
the groups to impart positive charge. In the present invention, it is unexpectedly found<br>
that BKC induces positive charge, under about neutral pH, in a multi-phasic composition<br>
having a solid particulate phase and an oil phase dispersed in aqueous milieu.<br>
Surprisingly, the cationic emulsion prepared using BKC shows significantly prolonged<br>
residence time in the eye using human cornea mounted on a Franz cell.<br>
[0092] Due to the presence of the preservative, the formulations of the present invention<br>
can be packaged into multi-dose containers. Moreover, as demonstrated in the following<br>
working examples, the presence of cyclosporine was only detected locally and<br>
administration of the formulations of the invention does not cause any irritation to the eye.<br>
Hence, the formulations of the invention are suitable for daily application.<br>
7. Viscosity Modifier<br>
[0093] The ophthalmic formulation may further comprise a viscosity modifier, such as a<br>
cellulose derivative, a polysaccharide or a synthetic polymer. The viscosity of the<br>
formulations of the present invention can be increased without compromising other<br>
properties.<br>
[0094] The following examples are given to illustrate the present invention. It should be<br>
understood, however, that the invention is not to be limited to the specific conditions or<br>
details described in these examples. Throughout the specification, any and all references<br>
to a publicly available document, including U.S. patents, are specifically incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>
Example 1<br>
[0095] The purpose of this example was to prepare formulations according to the<br>
invention comprising cyclosporine and a cationic preservative, benzalkonium chloride.<br>
[0096] The commercial Restasis® standard, which contains cyclosporine A (0.05% w/w)<br>
and inactive ingredients like glycerin, castor oil, polysorbate 80, carbomer 1342, purified<br>
water and sodium hydroxide, was used as a control for the purpose of comparing the<br>
properties of the formulation.<br>
[0097] Cyclosporine is commercially available under the trade names SANDIMMUNE81<br>
and NEORAL®. It is a cyclic polypeptide immunosuppressant agent consisting of 11<br>
amino acids. It is produced as a metabolite by the fungus species Beauveria nlyea.<br>
Chemically, cyclosporine is designated as [R-[R*,R*-(E)]]-cyclic(L-alanyl-D- alanyl-N-<br>
methyl-L-leucyl-N-methyl-L-leucyl-N-methyl-L-valyl-3-hydroxy-N, 4-dimethyl-L-2-<br>
amino-6-octenoyl-L-a-amino-butyryl-N-methylglycyl-N-methyl-L-leucyl-L-valyl-N-<br>
methyl-L-leucyl). The chemical structure of cyclosporine (also known as cyclosporin A)<br>
is:<br>
<br>
[0098] Cyclosporine was dissolved in ethanol at room temperature. Polysorbate 80 and<br>
crodamol (Table 1) were then added to the cyclosporine solution and mixed well with a<br>
paddle stirrer. Then benzalkonium chloride solution and water were added and mixing<br>
was continued for about 5 minutes. The coarse emulsion was then fed into a high pressure<br>
homogenizer (APV Invensys, model APV-1000) and homogenized at 10,000 psi for three<br>
passes. The resultant 50X concentrated composition, described below in Table 1,<br>
comprised cyclosporine dissolved in the solvent ethanol and nanoparticulate cyclosporine<br>
particles associated with the surface stabilizer polysorbate 80 present in the water portion<br>
of the emulsion. The concentrated emulsion was collected and diluted with phosphate<br>
buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2, at the ratio of 1 part of concentrated emulsion with 49 parts<br>
of PBS to obtain the final product, cationic micellar nanoparticle formulation (cMNP) of<br>
cyclosporine. The cMNP and Restasis® have similar appearance as milky white emulsion.<br>
The viscosity of the formulation of the invention can be increased without compromising<br>
otiier properties.<br>
[0099] The resultant particle size and zeta potential of cMNP of cyclosporine were<br>
measured and compared with those of the commercial Restasis® standard, as shown in<br>
Figure 1A and 1B, as well as in Table 2.<br>
<br>
Example 2<br>
[01001 The purpose of this example was to prepare formulations comprising<br>
cyclosporine and a permeation enhancer, vitamin E TPGS. The formulations of this<br>
example are used as a comparison to the formulations of the invention prepared according<br>
to Example 1.<br>
[0101] Cyclosporine and Restasis® standard are the same as those in Example 1.<br>
Vitamin E TPGS (d-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol-1000 succinate, obtained from<br>
Eastman Chemical Company) is a water-soluble form of natural-source vitamin E.<br>
[0102] Cyclosporine was dissolved in ethanol at room temperature. Polysorbate 80 and<br>
crodamol (Table 3) were then added to the cyclosporine solution and mixed well with a<br>
paddle stirrer. Then vitamin E TPGS solution and water were added and mixing was<br>
continued for about 5 minutes. The coarse emulsion was then fed into a high pressure<br>
homogenizer (APV Invensys, model APV-1000) and homogenized at 10,000 psi for three<br>
passes. The resultant 50X concentrated composition, described below in Table 3,<br>
comprised cyclosporine dissolved in the solvent ethanol and nanoparticulate cyclosporine<br>
particles associated with the surface stabilizer polysorbate 80 present in the water portion<br>
of the emulsion. The concentrated emulsion was collected and diluted with phosphate<br>
buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2, at the ratio of 1 part of concentrated emulsion with 49 parts<br>
of PBS to obtain the final product, neutral micellar nanoparticle formulation (nMNP) of<br>
cyclosporine. The nMNP and Restasis® have similar appearance as milky while emulsion.<br>
The viscosity of the formulation of the invention can be increased without compromising<br>
other properties.<br>
[0103] The resultant particle size and zeta potential of nMNP of cyclosporine were<br>
measured and compared with those of the commercial Restasis® standard, as shown in<br>
Figure 1A and 1C, as well as in Table 4.<br>
<br>
<br>
Example 3<br>
[0104] The purpose of this example was to test the formulations prepared in Example 1<br>
and Example 2 for drug residence on cornea, for possibility of once-daily application, and<br>
for systemic absorption, using an in vitro Franz cell-human cornea assembly.<br>
[0105J The protocol is as follows: isolated human cornea was obtained from an eye<br>
bank. The corneas were collected from donors and refrigerated in a suitable preservation<br>
medium. The preserved cornea was allowed to reach room temperature for about 20<br>
minutes, and then rinsed with PBS to remove the preservation medium. The corneas were<br>
mounted horizontally between the donor and receptor halves of the Franz diffusion cells.<br>
The surface area of the cornea exposed to the formulation in the donor chamber is 0.64<br>
cm2, and the receptor cell volume was 5.0 ml. The receptor compartment was filled with<br>
0.01M PBS, pH 7.4, and ethanol at a ratio of 9:1. A double water circulation jacket at<br>
37°C surrounds the receptor cell in order to have the cornea temperature maintained at<br>
physiologic level. The cMNP and nMNP formulations prepared according to Example 1<br>
and Example 2, as well as the Restasis® standard, were applied over the surface of the<br>
cornea gravimetrically using a syringe. Periodic samples of 1.0 ml each were taken from<br>
the receptor cell to measure the amount of drug transporting across the cornea at time<br>
points of 0, 2,4, 8, and 24 hours, respectively. At each time point, the donor sample was<br>
discarded and fresh donor sample was replenished. At the end of 24 hours, the cornea<br>
were collected, washed and homogenized in PBS:ethanol (9:1) and assayed for drug<br>
residence.<br>
[0106] No drug presence in the receptor compartment was detected at any time point.<br>
Hence, both formulations are suitable for once-daily application and the systemic<br>
availability of cyclosporine for both formulations is expected to be at comparable level to<br>
that of Restasis®. Moreover, Figure 2 illustrates that significantly high level of<br>
cyclosporine was retained in the cornea for the cMNP formulation prepared according to<br>
Example 1. Therefore, the cMNP formulation is expected to have a longer retention<br>
within the cul-de-sac via electrostatic attraction with ocular tissue.<br>
Example 4<br>
[0107] The purpose of this example was to test the formulations prepared in Example 1<br>
and Example 2 for biocompatibility.<br>
[0108] To determine the in vivo irritant and/or corrosive effects, the cMNP and nMNP<br>
formulations prepared according to Example 1 and Example 2 were instilled into the rabbit<br>
eye upon once-a-day application for 7 consecutive days.<br>
[0109] Six healthy New Zealand White rabbits were assigned to two groups of three<br>
animals per group. One group was dosed with the cMNP formulation, while the other was<br>
dosed with the nMNP formulation. All animals were dosed daily for seven consecutive<br>
days with 0.1 ml of the formulation into the conjunctival sac of the left eye of each rabbit.<br>
The right eye served as the untreated control. The treated eyes were examined for<br>
irritation using the Draize technique, pretest, prior to each subsequent dose and at the time<br>
points of 24, 48 and 72 hours, respectively, following the final dose. Observations for<br>
mortality, toxicity and pharmacologic effects were made prior to each ocular observation<br>
period. Body weights were recorded pretest. The animals were humanely sacrificed using<br>
CO2, following the final observation.<br>
[0110] The results show that there was no evidence of ocular irritation noted in any eye<br>
dosed with either the cMNP or the nMNP formulation and that there were no abnormal<br>
physical signs noted during the study. Hence, both the cMNP and the nMNP formulations<br>
are well-tolerated.<br>
Example 5<br>
[0111] The purpose of this example was to test the formulations prepared in Example 1<br>
and Example 2 for stability.<br>
[0112] Both formulations were subjected to an in-house or informal non-ICH stability<br>
study. The storage temperatures and time points taken for the stability test are as follows:<br>
1. 25°C: 0, 1, 2, 4, 12, and 40 weeks;<br>
2. 40°C: 1, 2, 4 and 12 weeks;<br>
3. 60°C: 1week<br>
[0113] The stability data, in terms of the potency of cyclosporine and the mean particle<br>
size, is depicted in Figure 3 and Figure 4, for the cMNP formulation and the nMNP<br>
formulation, respectively. For the cMNP formulation, the results show that there was no<br>
change in physical appearance of the emulsion for any storage condition at any time point<br>
tested. pH was stable at 7.3±0.3 across all storage conditions and time pointes tested. The<br>
cyclosporine content dropped by approximately 10% for 60°C storage condition at 1-week<br>
time point. However, the 25°C and 40°C storage conditions did not cause any significant<br>
decrease in potency during the test period. The mean particle size did not change during<br>
the test period for any storage condition tested. Hence, the cMNP formulation of<br>
cyclosporine will likely be stable for two years at room temperature. Figure 4 shows that<br>
the nMNP formulation is stable for up to 12 weeks at 25°C or at 40°C.<br>
Example 6<br>
[0114] The purpose of this example was to manufacture the cyclosporine formulation.<br>
[0115] 50X concentrated cyclosporine formulation containing 2.5% w/w cyclosporine is<br>
manufactured aseptically according to the description in Example 1 or Example 2. The<br>
particles of cyclosporine in the concentrated product have a mean particle size of less than<br>
200 nm. Subsequently, the concentrated composition is diluted with sterile PBS/saline to<br>
achieve 0.05% w/w cyclosporine in the final product, which has similar appearance to<br>
Restasis®. The final product is packaged and sealed in 0.4 ml per dose.<br>
[0116] It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and<br>
variations can be made in the methods and compositions of the present invention without<br>
departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present<br>
invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come<br>
within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.<br>
