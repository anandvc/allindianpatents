	The present invention relates to a thermo-chemical process for the on-line dewaxing<br>
of oil export pipelines. More specifically, the present invention relates to an on-line, thermo-chemical process for the dewaxing of large, oil export pipelines, which do not present, or are devoid of, any alternative to the discharge of as-produced oil during the dewaxing treatment. The present dewaxing process is effected with the aid of a Nitrogen Generating System (SGN, from the Portuguese expression Sistema Gerador de Nitrogenio) in the presence of a solvent which is the petroleum oil itself being produced or exported. The production of oil is not interrupted during the dewaxing treatment.<br>
Depending on the physical-chemical characteristics of the petroleum oil being exported in subsea lines, there occurs the well-known paraffination phenomenon, with the consequent loss of charge and increasing costs. The paraffin deposition phenomenon basically means the gradual and progressive deposition of paraffin from organic compounds throughout the lines. Thus, produced oils having paraffin contents higher than 3 weight % show high paraffin deposition potential when submitted to the flow conditions and to the characteristics of the subsea flowscheme.<br>
The deposition process is closely related to the low temperatures of the sea bottom, to the temperature gradient set between the oil and the seawater throughout the subsea line, to the flowrates of oil and gas, to the shearing dispersion and to a lesser extent to the gravitational segregation and to the brownian movement. The generation of paraffin crystals is associated to the WAT (Wax Appearance Temperature) defined as "...the highest temperature at which is initiated the generation of a solid phase in oil, whenever oil is submitted to a previous thermal treatment and to a controlled cooling rate under isobaric conditions..."<br>
US patent 4755230 teaches applying the reaction of heat and nitrogen generation to the dewaxing of hydrocarbon transmission lines with the aid of an oil-in-water emulsion and HCl as an activator of the nitrogen and heat generation reaction. The process requires further an organic solvent added of a crystalline modifier in order to keep as low as possible the cloud point of the paraffins in order to avoid their re-precipitation in the hne after cooling. The use of the process requires that the paraffin-containing portion of the line be isolated from the rest of the line. The way the process is effected can yield a situation where the paraffinic deposit is simply displaced within the line, without being effectively withdrawn. Also, the direction of the pumping of the treating -<br><br>
solution can cause a plug to be formed at one end of the line, so that failure of the line can occur due to excessive pressure.<br>
GB-B-2276218 of the Applicant and herein fully incorporated as reference relates to the dewaxing of lines of up to 4 inches in diameter and 10 km in length, with the aid of a Nitrogen Generating System/Emulsion using acetic acid as a delayed-action activator. The solutions of nitrogen and heat-generating salts are prepared In a process ship, each salt solution being prepared in a separate vessel.<br>
US patent application serial number 08/742126 of October 31, 1996 of the Applicant and herein fully incorporated as reference relates to the dewaxing of lines of up to 50,000 meters length and intemal diameter of up to 12 inches using a Nitrogen Generating System where the delayed-action activator of the reaction of nitrogen and heat generation is a poiyadipic anhydride of controlled hydrodegradability. In the process taught in USSN 08/742126 the solutions of nitrogen salts are prepared in one single vessel, on the production platform. The salt-containing solution is stabilized by the addition of NaOH and emulsified with an organic solvent. The delayed-action activator is added on flow to the nitrogen salts emulsion. The organic solvent is, for example, kerosene. The requirements of the process comprise emptying or otherwise displacing the whole amount of oil contained in the line. The treating fluid is then pumped into the line, either from a rig, the platform itself or through an auxiliary line; the fluid is allowed to act on the paraffin deposit for the period of time which is required for the development of the chemical reaction between the nitrogen salts and for the fluidization of the deposit. The spent fluids and the emulsified paraffin are recovered and well production is resumed.<br>
Therefore, the state-of-the-art processes either require expensive ship services as in GB-B-2276218 or the interruption of the oil production as in USSN 08/742126, this representing serious drawbacks to the economics of the process. Further, those processes cannot be applied to oil export pipelines which are devoid of alternatives of discharge of produced oil during the dewaxing treatment.<br>
Thus, in the art of dewaxing of lines there is the need of a thermal-chemicai process using a Nitrogen Generating System for the dewaxing of large dimension oil export pipelines, where the solution of nitrogen and heat-generating salts be mixed with the as-produced oil. This would avoid interrpting the oil production as well as the need of expensive petroleum fractions as solvents, which represents great savings. Such a process is disclosed and claimed in the present invention. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Broadly speaking, the present invention relates to a thermo-chemical process designed to withdraw, in an on-line manner, wax or paraffin deposits from a hydrocarbon export pipeline with the aid of a<br><br>
Nitrogen Generating System where the thermal-chemical effect provided for by the treating fluid causes the thorough contact of the paraffin deposit with the petroleum oil employed as solvent and with the heat and nitrogen chemically generated by the nitrogen reactants.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a thermo-chemical process for the on-line dewaxing of oil export pipelines with the aid of a Nitrogen Generating System, said process comprising the following steps: (a) determining the WAT (Wax Appearance Temperature) on samples of the as produced petroleum oil, identifying the paraffination phenomenon as well as the location of same in the oil export pipeline; (b) determining the optimum amount of petroleum oil to be employed as solvent for the paraffmic mass present in the oil export pipeline, so as to dimension the dewaxing operation; (c) preparing heat- and nitrogen gas- generating salt solutions based on ammonium chloride or ammonium sulfate and sodium nitrite in equimolar amounts of up to 4.5 moles in each of the salts, and effecting a dewaxing pilot test; (d) preparing a solution of a delayed-action activator based on acetic acid at 100% in a volume amount of 0.15 to 0.50, preferably 0.2%, based on the total volume of the treating fluid; (e) continuously pumping, from the production platform to the waxed oil export pipeline the treating fluid made up of the nitrogen salts solution, petroleum oil and delayed-action activator in the amounts determined in c) so as to effect the on¬line dewaxing of the oil export pipeline while petroleum is being produced; and (f) after the end of the pumping, collecting in a terminal the spent fluid resulting from the treatment, paraffin-rich oil and the aqueous spent solution in fluidized form.<br><br>
In the present invention, which is a thermal-chemical process for the dewaxing of large-dimension, oil export pipelines using the Nitrogen Generating System SGN, the solution of nitrogen- and heat-generating salts is admixed to the oil being produced without interrupting production. The present process is thus an on-line dewaxing process, which led the Applicants to call it "SGN/ON LINE". The activation of the reaction between the nitrogen salts is attained by the addition of acetic acid or of previously emulsified acetic acid.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides for an on-line, thermal chemical process for the dewaxing of oil export pipelines, using a Nitrogen Generating System, where the solvent for the paraffins deposited within the pipeline is the petroleum oil being produced or exported.<br>
The present invention also provides for an on-flow, thermal-chemical process for the dewaxing of large dimension, oil export pipelines, the process being effected without interrupting the oil production nor requiring the addition of petroleum fractions as paraffin solvents, with great cost savings.<br>
With reference to the accompanying drawings, in which<br>
GRAPH (I) illustrates the phase diagram of the solvent/paraffin<br><br>
mixture, in case the paraffin solvent is eithe aviation kerosene as in the state-of-the-art, or the petroleum blend of the present Invention. We refer to petroleum blend since the oil used as paraffin solvent in the context of the present invention is a blend or physical admixture of petroleum oils from various wells, for example, three or more wells. GRAPH (I) shows that although the pour point of the petroleum-paraffin admixture is a little lower than in the case kerosene is used as solvent, indicating a somewhat lower efficiency of the petroleum blend as paraffin solvent, there is still a great economic advantage in using the produced petroleum oil as solvent. DETAILED DESCRIPTION AND PREFERRED MODES<br>
In the specification and claims of the present invention, the dewaxing fluid or treating fluid is that fluid obtained from a solution of nitrogen salts which generate nitrogen gas and heat, such as sodium nitrite and ammonium chloride, or sodium sulfate and ammonium chloride, the reaction of nitrogen and heat generation being triggered with the aid of a delayed-action activator such as acetic acid.<br>
The thermal-chemical process with the aid of Nitrogen Generating System according to the present invention combines the effects of solvency, agitation and heating in order to effectively fluidize the paraffin deposit of oil export pipelines. As stated hereinbefore, the present process is specially directed to oil export pipelines which do not present alternatives to the discharge of oil production during the treatment to be effected.<br>
The present process is directed to the dewaxing treatment of large-dimension, unearthed, earthed or subsea oil export lines, which carry petroleum oil or Its fractions, often times under reduced temperatures, for example, temperatures below 10'.<br>
The nitrogen gas and heat are produced by the reaction between nitrogen salts in the presence of a delayed-action activator.<br>
The solvent employed in the treating fluid is the petroleum oil itself being produced or exported.<br>
As cited hereinbefore, the nitrogen and gas generation results from the reaction between nitrite and ammonium ions which are present In aqueous solutions of those salts.<br>
The nitrogen- and heat-generating aqueous solution contains: a) a compound bearing at least one nitrogen atom to which is attached at least one hydrogen atom, this compound being able of being quickly and exothermally oxidised in acid aqueous solution, thus producing heat, nitrogen gas and by-products which are liquid or dissolved, while being substantially inert to the pipeline; b) at least one oxidizing agent which is able to oxidize the nitrogen compound of a); and c) a buffer system which is able to maintain the pH of the solution at a level around 7.0-7.5.<br>
Among the couples of compounds a) and b) which are useful in<br><br>
the present process, amonium chloride and sodium nitrite or ammonium sulfate and sodium nitrite are specially adequate. In the prefen-ed mode, organic solvent - which in the present process is the very oil being produced - is added to the salt solutions. The aqueous solution of ammonium chloride and sodium nitrite is called "C+N" solution; the aqueous solution of ammonium sulfate and sodium nitrite is called "S+N" solution. The aqueous solution of nitrogen salts is used in a molar concentration of up to 4.6 molar in each of the salts.<br>
The concept of the treatment of oil export pipelines according to the present invention is based on the in-eversible fluidization of the paraffin deposit, the fluidization resulting from the simultaneous actions of increasing temperature of the fluid, internal turbulence during the flow, as well as the addition of the paraffin deposit to the petroleum oil employed as solvent of the process.<br>
As used in the present Invention, the expression "flowline" or "production line" means the line which transports the oil from the well to the platfomi, while the expression "oil export pipeline" means the line which transports oil which has been produced, treated and separated in the piatfomn separator and is being directed to a terminal or a tanker.<br>
Generally, the diameter of the oil export pipeline is largr than that of the production line, for example, 8 Inches for the oil export pipeline vs. 4 inches for the production line.<br>
In the present specification, the petroleum oil used as solvent is the blend of petroleum oils collected in several wells, for example three wells. The blend is separated from the gas and fomation water in the platform sarator and exported through the oil export pipeline.<br>
Also, in the present specification, the expression "the solution of nitrogen salts emulsified in the produced oil" does not mean that there is an emulsifier added to the solution of nitrogen salts. Actually, it is the turbulence created by the nitrogen gas which naturally emulsifies the solution of nitrogen- and heat-generating salts in the petroleum oil (unstable emulsion).<br>
The treating fluid employed In the present themial-chemical process comprises substantially a solution of nitrogen salts which are ammonium chloride and sodium nitrite or ammonium sulfate and sodium nitrite, emulsified on flow in the produced oil, the produced oil being heated at the exit temperature of the oil-gas separator of the platform. As already mentioned in GB-B-2276218 and USSN n" 08/742126, and herein fully incorporated as reference, the solutions of nitrogen salts emulsified on flow in the produced oil are prepared in concentrations which optimize the production of nitrogen gas and heat as required for the dewaxing treatment. Generally the solution is of up to 4.5 molar for each of the nitrogen salts. One single vessel is used for preparing the nitrogen salts solution. In order to keep the solution stable, the pH is kept between 7.0 and 7.6 with the aid of controlled addition of a NaOH<br><br>
solution.<br>
Further, the present process makes use of the concept of DELED-ACTION ACTIVATION, based on the fact that the nitrogen salts do not react perse to produce the desired amount of nitrogen and heat, this requiring an activator. However, it should be pointed out that this activation should not be immediate or instantaneous, since there is the need of reactionless periods between the salts, conresponding to the pumping period of the required volume of the treating fluid. According to the length of the required delay, the delayed-action activator can be either concentrated acetic acid (at 100%) or the concentrated acetic acid is previously emulsified, for example, a water-in-oil emulsion is prepared based on acetic acid, water and an aliphatic hydrocarbon such as pentane, hexane or a petroleum fraction such as diesel oil, and an emulsifier or surface agent.<br>
The delayed-action activator for the reaction of heat- and nitrogen generation can be as taught in USSN 08/742126, that is, a polyanhydride of controlled hydrodegradability, which is to be used as a solution. Conventional acetic acid can be used, as stated in G6-B-2276218. Emulsified acids can also be used, as in US 5,183,581.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the reaction can be activated by concentrated acetic acid used in amounts from 0.15 to 0.50 volume % based on the total volume of treating fluid.<br>
In another embodiment, a water-in-oll emulsion can be used, prepared from acetic acidAwater/aliphatic hydrocarbon in amounts of from 0.75 to 1.25 volume % based on the total volume of treating fluid.<br>
According to this embodiment, the activator for the reaction of nitrogen salts is a solution of concentrated acetic acid (at 100%) in water in the presence of an aliphatic hydrocarbon which fomns a water-in-oil emulsion in the presence of a surface agent. The aliphatic hydrocarbon is a C6-C7 straight-chain hydrocarbon such as n-pentane, n-hexane or n-heptane, or a petroleum fraction such as diesel oil. The active matter of the activator Is acetic acid. The intemal or aqueous phase of the emulsion Is made up of water and acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio. The extemat phase or oil phase can be for example diesel oil. The relative amounts of the intemal and external phases can be varied in wide limits, provided the necessary stability of the extemal phase be kept intact. Thus, the lower limit for the amount of extemal phase is 25 parts per volume, the 75 remaining parts per volume being 37.5 parts of water and 37.5 parts of concentrated acetic acid. In the upper limit, the extemal phase will contain 75 parts per volume while the intemal phase will contain 12.5 parts of water and 12.5 parts of concentrated acetic acid. A prefen'ed volumetric amount to be used as activator is 20 parts water/20 parts acetic acid/ 60 parts diesel oil plus a surface agent.<br>
The amount of activator emulsion to be used is a function of the amount of active matter, that is, acetic acid, present in the emulsion. For<br><br>
example, if the activating emulsion contains a lesser amount of acetic acid, a higher volumetric amount should be used in order to result in a given activation. Thus, an emulsion such as 20 parts water/20 parts acetic acid/60 parts diesel oil used at a 1 volume % of the total volumetric amount of treating fluid con*esponds to 0.2% of active matter in the emulsion and delays the reaction between the nitrogen salts for 18 minutes (see Table 4 below).<br>
If the active matter is present in lesser amounts in the activating<br>
emulsion, higher volumetric amounts of activator should be added to the treating fluid, yielding longer delaying times caused by the increased stability of the emulsion (see test n'4 on Table 4 below).<br>
A lipophilic surface agent will provide for the desired water-in-oil emulsion of aqueous acetic add in a hydrocarbon.<br>
Among the lipophilic surface agents which are useful in the present invention, such surface agents based on fatty acids such as sorbitan esters can be used and are widely available. The surface agent used as an emulsifier of the delayed action activator emulsion is present In volumetric amounts of between 0.5 to 1.5 percent based on the volumetric amount of the activator emulsion.<br>
The amount of treating fluid to be used is generally determined based on a first numerical simulation which considers the content and the characteristis of the paraffin to be removed. This simulation generates the thermal log of the flow of oil in the pipe. The themnai log evaluates the severity of the paraffination phenomenon.<br>
A further numerical simulation considers the thermodynamicai behavior of the fluid during the dewaxing treatment.<br>
A first step during the research which led to the present process was to determine the thermal and kinetichemical behavior of the saturated solution of reactants which maice up the Nitrogen Generating System (SGN), that is, ammonium chloride and sodium nitrite (Solution C+N), in the presence of oil previously heated to a temperature near that of the outlet of the oil-gas separator of the platfonn. In the embodiment which leads to a longer delay for the reaction between the nitrogen salts, the delayed action activator to be used is acetic acid emulsified in water/diesel oil in the presence of a lipophilic surface agent<br>
It was found that ammonium sulfate can be advantageously used instead of ammonium chloride, without any harm for the reaction knetics, the sulfate salt being of very low cost and widely available.<br>
In general terms, the present on-line, dewaxing process for large dimension oil export lines comprises the following sequential steps:<br>
- sampling the oil being produced and determining the WAT (Wax Appearance Temperature) with the aid of DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry), then making a numerical simulation in order to identify the paraffination phenomenon and its location in the pipeline;<br><br>
-	test the efficacy of the produced oil as a solvent for the paraffin in order to detemiine the optimum ratio of oil to paraffin which is necessary to fluidize the paraffin;<br>
-	with the aid of a numerical simulation, taylor the deparaffination treatment based on the thermodynamic behavior of the fluid during the paraffination phenomenon;<br>
-	testing the reaction kinetics on a platform laboratory based on<br>
solutions of the heat- and nitrogen gas-generating salts;<br>
- from the platform, pumping : a) the treating fluid made up of the nitrogen salts solution, C+N or S+N; b) oil from the separator and c) delayed action activator according to the previously determined amounts;<br>
-	receiving the paraffin-rich oil and spent fluids into a tanker or<br>
terminal. Residual nitrogen gas will be released to the atmosphere while<br>
the water from the aqueous salt solutions will be discarded accordingly.<br>
In view of the relationship between WAT (Wax Appearance Temperature) and the paraffin deposition phenomenon, the present study requires that WAT be determined since it Is at temperatures below the WAT that the onset of the paraffin deposition phenomenon will occur. The WAT of oils from various wells as well as of the blend of these oils which is to be exported to the terminals after separation from the gas in the platfomi separator is determined based on kinematic viscosity data. TABLE 1 below lists the data.<br><br><br>
Concerning the trend to paraffination exhibited by the various weiis, it was found that since the oil export pipeline from well 1 to the platfomn is not very long, there is no paraffination in spite of the low WAT. However, for the pipelines which transport oil from wells 2 and 3 there is a strong paraffination trend from the second kilometer on of the flexible line. The subsea flowschemes of these welts allow that the oil be cooled below the corrsponding WAT's. After the treatment of the oils in the primary separator there is a slight increase in the WAT of the resulting blend (15.1**C) which, on export through a pipeline of 8 inch diameter ad 21 km length up to the monobuoy shows a gradual charge loss and consequent loss in flow ability fix&gt;m 2400 to 2000 cubic meters a day. This represents nearly 80% of the originally designed capacity, or a loss of 20%.<br>
Sometimes, there is a reduction in the heating efficacy of the separator, so that the exit temperature of the oil is reduced from 75'C to 55'*C. As a consequence, the oil is rendered more viscous and the flow ability of the oil is again reduced, for example to figures such as 1700 cubic meters a day, which represents 70% of the original daily flow. Thus a temperature conresponding to WAT can be anticipated as a consequence of the lowering in the exit temperature and fiowrateofthe oil. Thus the process of Increasing paraffination in the pipeline is to be expected, mainly In the section situated near the platform.<br>
The chemical characterization of the oils of each of the wells 1, 2 and 3 under study has shown paraffin contents between 3 and 6 weight % and 0.6 to 2.1 weight % asphaitenes which means high organic deposition potential, when these oils are submitted to the flow conditions and to the characteristics of the subsea flowschemes.<br>
TABLE 2 below lists the results for the physical-chemical characteristics of the oils of wells 1,2 and 3.<br><br><br>
Then, it was necessary to determine if the blend or physical admixture of the petroleum oils being exported through the pipeline could be used as solvent for the paraffin in the process of the present invention - SGN/ON-LINE. It was found that the pour point of the mixture paraffin + oil is reduced in a manner similar to that observed when kerosene, for example aviation kerosene is used as the paraffin solvent. As can be seen frosm TABLE 3 below, it was found that at usual subsea temperatures in a deep-water environment, the blend of petroleum oils is able to keep a mass of paraffin (C21H44 standard) under ftow condtons provied there are at least three parts of petroleum oil to each part of paraffin.<br>
This means that petroleum oil, for example, a blend of petroleum oils of various producing wells of a certain field can be easily utilized as an organic solvent in the thermo-chemical process of the present invention. A further benefit is that the oil leaves the separator at a temperature near 75°C, which represents additional thermal energy to be used In the process.<br><br><br>
Nitrogen Generation System dispersed in tlie petroleum blend used as paraffin solvent of the present invention. It was found that the inaease in the amount of C+N solution from 10 to 30% by volume promotes an increase in maximum temperature from TQC to 100°C, provided the mixture be kept in near-to-adiabatic conditons and activated with acetic acid 0.2%.<br><br>
Data from TABLE 4 show that using 20 vol % of C+N solution in the admixture with the petroleum oil blend, temperatures not higher than 91 °C are attained in 13 minutes reaction period and reaction yields are in the range of 90%, these figures being perfectly acceptable for field operation.<br>
Alternatively, an emulsion of acetic acid in diesel oil stabilized with a lipophilic surface agent was prepared and used as an efficient delayed action activator. This emulsion caused a slightly higher delay (as compared to the acetic acid activator) to the onset of the reaction of heat and nitrogen generation, this being useful to satisfy the requirements of flowrate and pressure of the pipeline. For example, in a concentration of 0.75 volume % the acid emulsion provided for a delay of 18 minutes for the onset of the reaction, while at 1.0 volume % the delay was 18 minutes, and reaction yield was 88 volume %. So the use of acetic acid as delayed action activator, diluted or emulsified,   satisfies the requirements of the present invention.<br>
Kinetic data of TABLE 4 show also that the performance of ammonium sulfate is very similar to that of ammonium chloride, so it can be employed instead of ammonium chloride. Ammonium sulfate is a salt of very low cost. It Is produced in the area where the tests on oil export pipelines were made.<br>
Thus, based on prior determination of WAT figures, chemical characterization of the oils to be exported, phase diagram of the petroleum oil/paraffin mixture and kinetic data for the chemical reaction between nitrogen and heat-generating salts, one can design the dewaxing operation for the oil export pipeline of a platfomi in the Campos Basin, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.<br>
Data of production and subsea flowscheme of the field under<br><br>
study were evaluated according to TABLE 5 below, during the step of designing the dewaxing operation of the oil export pipeline mentioned before. It was found that the significant reductions in production in the field under study are closely related to the wax deposition processes in the production lines in wells 2 and 3 and mainly in the oil export pipeline, it was also noted that the paraffin deposition phenomenon can still be accentuated by the undesirable reduction in the oil temperature at the separator outlet.<br><br>
The hypothesis of heating the oil in the pipeline was considered as a possibility to prevent parafTin deposition in the pipeline. However, in view of the extended length of the pipeline - 21,000 meters - this is not feasible. On the other hand, numerical simulations of the flowrate of oil at the various initial temperatures indicate the onset of the waxing phenomenon. If effected, the only action of such heating would be the displacement of the initial location of paraffination towards the monobuoy place.<br>
A preliminary thennal balance involving the step of oil export from the platform to the monobuoy leads to estimating the thermal loss of the mass of oil equivalent to one nominal volume of the pipeline as being of the order of 16x10® Kilocalories.<br>
Based on the above figure for thennal loss of the mass of oil in the pipeline and adding a minimal surplus of heat to promote the fluidization of tiie paraffin deposit already existing within the pipeline, a hypothetical volume of treating fluid according to the SGN/ON-LINE mode is obtained. This volume is of the order of 136 m of saturated C+N solution, which is able to yield 40x10® kilocalories. The resulting heat will cause a rise in temperature within the pipeline of the order of 93**C, which, together with the solvency effect of the oil and the fluid-mechanical effect of the nitrogen gas, is sufficient to promote the irreversible fluidization of the paraffin deposit.<br>
The thermal balance in the oil export and in the treatment of the oil export pipeline is summarized below.<br>
A) HEAT LOST IN THE OIL EXPORT<br><br>
HEAT = 680 m' x 0.878 kg/I x 0.66 kcal/kg'C x (75-1 A'C) = HEAT LOST = 24,036,000 kCAL<br>
B)	HEAT GENERATED IN THE TREATMENT OF THE PIPELINE<br>
HEAT -136 m * x 4.5 moi/L x 75 Kcal/L x 0.88 mole/mole « GENERATED HEAT » 40,392,000 Kcal<br>
C)	AVERAGE TEMPERATURE DURING THE TREATMENT**<br>
40,932,000 - 24,036,000 »<br>
680x0.80X0.878X0.66X (Teq - 75) + 680 x 0.20x l.lOx 1.0 (Teq- 25) = 93»C<br>
* Considering the characteristics of the pipeline treatment according to the SGN- ON-LINE mode, a volume of C+N solution (136 m') was established. This volume was considered adequate to the working and tanking capacity of the rig as well as to the thermal need of the pipeline section to be treated.<br>
** Aiming at simplifying the calculations for the average temperature of the treating fluid as well as the operation safety, it was conservatively assumed that the themnal loss during the treatment in the SGN/ON-LINE mode would be approximately equal to the loss observed during the oil export. Further numerical simulation will be effected in order to calculate the actual temperature figures throughout the section to be submitted to the dewaxing treatment.<br>
According to the prefen«d mode of the present invention, the dewaxing treatment to be effected on the oil export pipeline comprises preparing and then pumping the aqueous salt solution C+N or S+N into the flow of exported oil, after a previous reduction in the oil flowrate. This reduction is of the same order of the SGN inlet flowrate. The pumping of the C+N solution can be effected by way of a triplex pump of positive displacement, the flowrate of which is scheduled to be 1.75 barrels per minute (bpm). The activator dosage as an acidic emulsion is effected on flow and preferably in the mixture oil/C+N solution, by way of an incremental pump working in the range of 0.5 to 1.5 gallons/minute. Acccording to this mode, the overall pumping period takes approximately 9.5 hours. In operating the dewaxing treatment according to the present process, there is no need for a final displacement of fluids neither shut In time for the completion of the chemical reaction between the nitrogen salts.<br>
The operation details are summarized below.<br>
OPERATION MODE	CONTINUOUS, CO-CURRENT FLOW<br>
ORGANIZATION OF OPERATION	REDUCTION OF THE ORIGINAL FLOW OF<br>
OIL TO 80%<br>
PUMPING DIRECTION	RIG-PIPEUNE-SUBSEA MONOBUOY-<br>
MONOBUOY-TANKER<br>
RNAL POSITION OF TREATING FLUID	RISER-MONOBUOY (21,000 METERS)<br>
TREATING FLUID	C+N SOLUTION/OIL+ACID EMULSION<br><br>
The composition and making of the treating fluids, that is, C+N solution and acid emulsion should obey the conventional procedures as taught in the Background Infontiation chapter. Special care should be devoted to the control of the final pH of the salt solution and to the stability of the activating acid emulsion. According to the present invention a pilot test under semi-adiabatic conditons should be effected. For this test, samples of the prepared fluids and oil kept at the outlet temperature of the separator should be used.<br>
Also, it should be noted that the temperature of the fluid resulting from the dewaxing treatment should be sampled on flow so as to keep the dewaxing treatment under control. The sampling of the spent fluid as it anives at the tanker should equally be carefully undertaken.<br>
Once stored In the tanker, the paraffin content of the petroleum blend no longer constitutes a problem, since the volumes are large enough. The eventual deposition of paraffin will occur on the ship's pavement and can be easily withdrawn by mechanical means.<br>
The dimensioning of the dewaxing treatment is summarized below.<br><br>
It should be noted that the pumping period is a function of the treating fluid volume to be injected into the oil export pipeline. This volume will be a function of the paraffination condition of the pipeline. In the beginning of the treatment pumping is more sluggish, then when the paraffin mass is being incorporated into the petroleum oii pumping becomes easier, so that in the average the pumping period con'esponds to the volume of fluid which can flow through the pipeline.<br>
An additional advantage of the present dewaxing process as compared to the state-of-the-art processes is that the shut in time is zero, that is, no need to shut in the pipeline. This is because the<br><br>
dewaxing system works instantaneously - there is no waiting period for the dewaxing system to effect the treatment. This perfomiance is not known nor suggested in the existing literature.<br>
The composition and preparation of the treating fluids according to the present invention are set forth below.<br><br>
The perfomiance of the petroleum oil blend as a solvent for the thermo-chemical dewaxing process of the oil export pipeline of a platfonn of the Campos Basin In the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil is an evidence that the SGN/ON-LINE process is technically feasible and economically viable. The numerical simulation and the tests of reaction kinetics employing an on-flow mixture of 80/20 vol/vol of petroleum/C+N solution stress the possibility of full withdrawal of the organic deposit possibly present in the first half of the 21,000 meters length of the pipeline.<br>
It should be pointed out that the salt solution can be prepared based on ammonium chloride (C+N solution) or ammonium sulfate (S+N solution) or even mixtures of same, provided that be obeyed the molar proportion between the salts.<br>
Therefore, the present thermo-chemical process for the dewaxing of oil export pipelines provides for the wKhdrawal of paraffin deposits from these pipelines in a very economical way since oil production Is not intemjpted. Also, there are significant savings In energy in view of the fact that the heat of the as-produced oil is made part of the process.<br>
By applying the present dewaxing process according to the operation conditions as described in the specification and claims of the present invention provided for the increase in the flowrate of the oil export pipeline under study firom 1700 cubic meters a day to 2400 cubic<br><br>
meters a day as expected. This has been attained at low cost and nearly without any production loss during the dewaxing treatment.<br><br><br><br>
