This invention relates to a curable coating composition containing hydroxy poly siloxane and a process for preparing the same. The composition when coated on substrates and cured exhibits low thermal diffusivity and is therefore found ideally suitable for thermally protecting installations such as aerospace vehicles.<br>
High velocity of aerospace vehicles generate very high temperature while in motion. This results in critical material failure, deterioration due to chemical attack, thermal shock, erosion and differences in thermal expansion coefficients. Heat generated from the propulsion system or the heat transferred from the hot skin of the vehicles may cause strenuous temperature conditions to develop affecting the vehicles' performance. The skin of the structure of the launch vehicles are therefore to be isolated from the hypercondition of the environment which is conventionally effected with the help of thermal protection system.<br>
Conventional thermal protection systems are based on polyurethanes, polyesters and epoxies. The systems based on polyurethanes have low temperature stability and their properties deteriorate at high temperatures- The systems based on polyesters and epoxies have processing problems and exhibit unsatisfactory performance at high temperatures. Further, they show poor ageing properties.  Thermal protection systems based on<br><br>
polysiloxane exhibit the required thermophysical characteristics and good ageing properties. However a composition having lower density than polysiloxane is preferred in thermal protecting system as it helps in reducing the total mass thereby improving the payload mass.<br>
The main objective of this invention is to develop a process for the preparing a curable composition useful in aerospace thermal protection system having low density and low thermal diffusivity to protect aerospace vehicle structures from thermal shock and chemical attack during its ascend. The skin of the aerospace vehicle is known to experience a temperature upto 450^C during this period. Since the heat shield of the launch vehicle is made of aluminium alloy which starts deteriorating from a temperature of 120oC onwards it is necessary to maintain the skin temperature below 120oC. Low density thermal protective system having low thermal diffusivity  achieves this object.<br>
A premix is prepared from a linear hydroxy terminated poly-dimethyl siloxane having molecular weight between 10000 to 50000 by adding silica fillers like precipitated silica, fumed silica, and optionally finely powdered oxides of iron and zinc. Mechanical properties of the hydroxy terminated poly dimethyl siloxane are improved by the additions of fillers. Linear hydroxy terminated polydimethyl siloxane is produced by anionic equilibration  of the hydrolysate obtained by the  hydrolysis  of<br><br>
dimethyl  chlorosilane.   The premix is dispersed in  an  organic solvent before admixing the curing component thereto.<br>
The curing component is prepared by mixing alkyl tris aikyloximinosilane, aminoalkyl trialkylsilane and an organotin compound such as dibutyltin dilaurate.<br>
Curing takes place at ambient temperature when the premix dispersion is mixed with the curing component. Crosslinking of the hydroxy terminated poly dimethyl siloxane takes place by the reaction of Si-OH with oximinosilane in the presence of atmospheric moisture.  Oximinosilane of the curing component  has<br><br>
B', and R" may be alkyl groups having 1-10 carbon atoms. Easily hydrolysable Si-O-N linkage of these compounds break up to form Si-OH in the presence of atmospheric oxygen which then condenses with Si-O-Si linkage to effect cross linking.<br><br>
incorporated in the curing component improve the adhesive characteristics of the final product R, R', R", and R"" are alkyl groups  having  1-4  carbon atoms.  The highly  polar  NH2  group<br><br>
improves the bond strength of the composition with the substrate on which it is applied to through polar and hydrogen bondings. The alkoxy group-OR' cross links with hydroxy terminated polysiloxane. Organotin compounds act as a catalyst to enhance the rate of cross linking reaction.<br>
In general the premix is prepared from 1000 parts of hydroxy terminated poly dimethyl siloxane of molecular weight 50000 to 100000. Pretreated fumed silica ferric oxide and sine oxide may be added in the range of 60-80 parts, 10 to 20 parts and 5 to 15 parts by weight respectively. This premix is dispersed in a solvent such as toluene, xylene, n-hexane or petroleum ether till a sprayable viscosity is obtained by controlling the quantity of solvent used.<br>
The curing component consisting of alkyl tris alkyl ketoxime silane, 3 amino alkyl trialkoxysilane and dibutyltin dilaurate in the weight ratio of 100 : 10 ; 1 to 100 : 40 : 3 is prepared separately. The range may be controlled according to the required tack free and cure time of the final product 8-12 parts by weight of the curing component is added to the solution of the premix to obtain the curable composition of the invention and may be sprayed on the substrate to be protected. Curing takes place at ambient conditions within a minimum period of one hour when the solvent is evaporated and in the presence of atmospheric moisture and is completed within 24 hours of application.<br><br>
This invention relates to a curable coating composition which comprises a blend of a premix dispersion and a curing component, wherein said premix consists of a mixture of hydroxy terminated polydimethyl siloxane, silica, ferric oxide and zinc oxide dispersed in an organic solvent, and said curing component consists of a mixture of alkyl tris alkyl alkoxy silane, amino alkyl trialkoxy silane and an organotin compound.<br>
This invention also relates to a process for preparing a curable coating composition which comprises the step of (a) preparing a premix by blending hydroxy terminated poly dimethyl siloxane, silica, ferric oxide and zinc oxide and subsequently dispersing said premix in an organic solvant (b) preparing a curing component by mixing alkyl tris alkyl trialkoxy silane, amino alkyl trialkoxy silane and an organotin compound and (c&gt; admixing said premix dispersion with said curing component to produce the curable coating composition.<br>
The  following  example particularly  describes  a  specific embodiment of the process according to this invention.<br>
1000 parts of hydroxy terminated poly dimethyl siloxane of molecular weight 50000 is blended with 75 parts of fumed silica filler, 15 parts of ferric oxide and 7.5 parts of ainc oxide in a triple roll mill, and then kneaded in a kneader to obtain the premix. 200 parts of this premix is dispersed in 250 parts of toluene.<br><br>
The curing component is prepared by mixing methyl tris methyl ethyl ketoxime silane, 3-aminto propyl tri ethoxy silane and dibutyl tri dilaurate in the ratio of 100 : 20 : 2.<br>
10 parts of the curing component is added to the premix dispersion and mixed thoroughly.<br>
This composition is sprayed on a substrate using a pressure gun. After one hour, the solvent toluene gets evaporated and the composition gets cured and is found tack free. Subsequent coatings may be effected after a minimum interval of one hour.<br>
Substrates thus coated show low density. liOw thermal conductivity and high specific heat which in toto imparts a thermal diffusivity of 8.0 cm /sec.<br>
Addition of ferric oxide enhances the thermal stability and improving adhesive strength. They are used as hollow fillers for controlling the density of the composition.<br>
