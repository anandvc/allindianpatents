				<td>A SILICONE COATING COMPOSITION AND A METHOD OF MAKING A CURED COATING USING THE SAME<br><br>
During the process of coating silicone on to paper for release coating applications, the formation of silicone mist (i.e. aerosol) is undesirable. Small mist particles, on the order of 1 to 10 microns are considered to be capable of being inhaled and can be deposited deep within the lungs. Silicone mist can also cause hygiene problems by coating everything in the vicinity of the coating head with a layer of silicone.<br>
Solventless silicone coatings have been disclosed in the art. For example, Chung et al. in U.S. Patent No. 5,036,117 discloses a curable composition comprising (A) an organosilicon compound having an average of at least two curing radicals per molecule thereof selected from the group consisting of the hydroxy radical and olefinic hydrocarbon radicals, (B) an organohydrogensilicon compound containing an average of at least two silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms per molecule thereof, the amounts of Components (A) and (B) being sufficient to provide a ratio of the number of silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms to the number of silicon-bonded curing radicals of from 1/100 to 100/1, (C) a platinum group metal-containing catalyst in sufficient amount to accelerate a curing reaction among said silicon-bonded curing radicals and said silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms, (D) an inhibitor compound for said accelerated curing reaction in a total amount sufficient to retard the curing reaction at room temperature but insufficient to prevent said reaction at elevated temperature, and (E) a bath life extender compound in a total amount sufficient to further retard the curing reaction at room temperature.<br>
Jones et al. in U.S. Patent No, 5,125,998 discloses a process, the process comprising the steps of (I) first mixing (A) an inhibitor compound and (B) a platinum group metal-containing catalyst, (II) thereafter adding the mixture of (I) to (C) an organosilicon compound having an average of at least two curing radicals per molecule thereof selected from the group consisting of the hydroxy radical and olefinic hydrocarbon radicals, (III) thereafter adding to the mixture of (II) (D) an organohydrogensilicon compound containing an average of at least two silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms per molecule thereof, the amounts of components (C) and (D) being sufficient to provide a ratio of the number of silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms to the number of silicon-bonded curing radicals of from 1/100 to 100/1; (IV) applying the mixture from (III) to a solid substrate to form a coating; (V) exposing the coating to an energy source selected from the group consisting of (i) heat, and<br>
(ii) actinic radiation in an amount sufficient to cure the coating; whereby the amount of component (A) present in the total composition of components (A), (B), (C), and (D), is<br><br>
sufficient to retard any curing reaction at room temperature but insufficient to prevent any reaction at elevated temperatures; and whereby the amount of component (B) is sufficient to accelerate any curing reaction among the silicon-bonded curing radicals and the silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms at elevated temperatures.<br>
Thayer et al. in U.S. Patent No. 5,281,656 discloses coating compositions comprising (A) an alkenyldiorganosiloxy-terminated polydiorganosiloxane, (B) an alkenyldiorganosiloxy-terminated polydiorganosiloxane-polyorganoalkenylsiloxane copolymer, (C) a hydrogendiorganosiloxy-terminated polydiorganosiloxane, (D) a platinum-containing catalyst, and (D) an inhibitor. Thayer et al. further discloses the amounts of Components (A), (B) and (C) that are used in the compositions, expressed in terms of the ratio of the number of silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms of Component (C) to the number of silicon-bonded alkenyl radicals of Components (A) and (B), are sufficient to provide a value of from 1/2 to 20/1 for said ratio and. preferably, from 1/2 to 2/1, and even more preferably, about 1/1.<br>
Silicone compositions which are useful in suppressing silicone mist have also been described in the art. For example, Chung et al. in U.S. Patent No. 5,625,023 discloses silicone mist suppressant compositions which are prepared by reacting an organosilicon compound, an oxyalkylene containing compound, and a catalyst. Chung et al. further discloses that these compositions, when added to silicone coatings, reduce the amount of silicone mist in high speed coating processes. These silicone mist suppressant compositions were only partially compatible with silicone and produced a cloudy mixture when added to coating formulations. This partial incompatibility was believed to be critical to the mist-suppression performance of these materials. However, the use of these suppressant also introduced new issues with the coverage and anchorage of the silicone release coating.<br>
This invention relates to silicone coating composition comprising a solventless silicone coating composition and a liquid silicone mist suppressant composition obtained by a method comprising reacting a large excess of at least one organohydrogensilicon compound containing at least three silicon-bonded hydrogen groups with at least one compound containing at least two alkenyl groups in the presence of a platinum group metal-containing catalyst.<br>
This invention also relates to a method of reducing mist in a solventless silicone coating which comprises adding to a solventless silicone coating a liquid silicone mist suppressant composition obtained by a method comprising reacting a large excess of at least one organohydrogensilicon compound containing at least three silicon-bonded hydrogen groups with<br>
2<br><br>
at least one compound containing at least two alkenyl groups in the presence of a platinum group metal-containing catalyst.<br>
The present invention also relates to the use of the silicone suppressant compositions in processes for preparing a laminate of a substrate and an adhesive wherein the adhesive will release from the substrate.<br>

The<br>
17<br><br>
solventless silicone coating composition and the liquid silicone mist suppressant composition are as described above including preferred embodiments and amounts thereof.<br>
In a fifth embodiment, this invention relates to a method of making a cured coating, the method comprising the steps of: (1) adding a liquid silicone mist suppressant composition having a viscosity of from 150 to 50,000 millipascal-seconds (1 millipascal second = 1 centipoise) obtained by a method comprising mixing: (a) at least one organohydrogensilicon compound containing at least three silicon-bonded hydrogen groups per molecule, (b) at least one compound containing at least two alkenyl groups per molecule, and (c) a platinum group metal-containing catalyst which is present in an amount sufficient to provide 0.1 to 10 weight parts of platinum group metal per million weight parts of (a)+(b), with the proviso that the ratio of the number of silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms of Component (a) to the number of alkenyl groups of Component (b) is at least 4.6:1 to a solventless silicone coating composition; (II) coating the mixture from (I) on the surface of a substrate; and (III) exposing the coating and the substrate to an energy source selected from (i) heat or (ii) actinic radiation in an amount sufficient to cure the coating. This method can further comprise applying a pressure sensitive adhesive on the coating after step (III). The solventless silicone coating composition and the liquid silicone mist suppressant composition are as described above including preferred embodiments and amounts thereof.<br>
By actinic radiation it is meant ultraviolet light; electron beam radiation; and alpha-, beta-, gamma- and x- rays. By heat it is meant infrared radiation, hot air, microwave radiation, etc. Of course actinic radiation is frequently accompanied by heat and the use of a combination of the two falls within the scope and spirit of the present method. In the preferred method of this invention, the coating process can be accomplished by any suitable manner known in the art, such as by spreading, brushing, extruding, spraying, gravure, kiss-roll and air-knife.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the instant method the solid substrate is a flexible sheet material such as paper, polyolefin film and polyolefin-coated paper or foil. Other suitable solid substrates that can be coated by the process of this invention include other cellulosic materials such as wood, cardboard and cotton; metallic materials such as aluminum, copper, steel and silver; siliceous materials such as glass and stone; and synthetic polymer materials such as polyolefins, polyamides, polyesters and polyacrylates. As to form the solid substrate can be substantially sheet-like, such as a peelable release liner for pressure sensitive adhesive; a fabric or a foil; or substantially three- dimensional in form.<br>
18<br><br>
After the silicone coating composition has been coated onto a substrate it is heated and/or irradiated with actinic radiation, as noted herein, to cure the liquid coating and to adhere it to the substrate.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the method of this invention, a flexible sheet material, such as paper, metal foil or tapestock, is coated with a thin coating of the silicone coating composition, preferably in a continuous manner and the thus-coated material is then heated and/or irradiated to rapidly cure the coating, to provide a sheetlike material bearing on at least one surface thereof an adhesive-releasing coating. The adhesive-releasing coating is subsequently brought into contact with a pressure sensitive adhesive, preferably in an in-line manner, to form an article having a peelable, i.e. releasable, adhesive/coating interface. Examples of such an article include, adhesive labels having a peelable backing, adhesive tape in roll form and adhesive packaged in a strippable container. The pressure sensitive adhesive can be non-silicone-based, such as the well-known acrylic or rubber types or silicone-based, such as the peroxide-or platinum-curable polydiorganosiloxane-based adhesives.<br>
The method of this invention is also applicable to adhesive materials, other than pressure sensitive adhesives. Examples of said adhesive materials include foods, graphite composites, asphalt and gum polymers.<br>
The silicone mist suppressant compositions of this invention when added to silicone coatings are effective in reducing the amount of mist generated by the release coating during high speed coating processes such as for example when a silicone coating is coated onto a substrate such as paper, and the coating is then subsequently cured onto the substrate using heat to provide a sheetlike material bearing on at least surface thereof an adhesive releasing coating. The following examples are disclosed to further teach, but not limit, the invention, which is properly delineated by the appended claims. All amounts (parts and percentages) are by weight unless otherwise indicated.<br>
The silicone mist particles produced by the "mist generator" described hereinbelow were drawn, in some of the Examples, to a QCM Cascade Impactor (TM), (Model PC-2 Ten Stage QCM Cascade Impactor, California Measurements, Inc., Sierra Madre, Calif.) and analyzed. A complete analysis of aerosol mass concentration and size distribution was obtained from a sample of air taken for a short period of time (10 seconds to 1 minute). Collected samples of the sized particles were retained undisturbed (if the particles are solid) and were used directly to<br>
19<br><br>
obtain composition, size and shape (for solid particles only) information using auxiliary scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and other analytical techniques.<br>
The instrument separates aerosol particles into 10 sizes from 0.05 to 25 micrometers. It does this by drawing the aerosol-laden air sample through a series of 10 stages, each stage containing an inertial impactor jet of decreasing size (various size of orifices) where the particles are accelerated. Directly below each jet was ft piezoelectric quartz crystal that was used as an impactor to collect the separated particles. As the jet of air exits from the nozzle it was forced to turn sharply to flow around the crystal. Larger particles in the stream, because of their inertia, continue to travel toward the crystal plate and impact on it. Smaller particles follow the flow of air around the crystal to the next stage, which was a repeat of the proceeding stage, except it was equipped with smaller nozzle designed to impact smaller particles. The 10 stages thus collect particles of smaller and smaller sizes. Each crystal was the frequency-controlling element of a quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM), whose output frequency decreases when particles are collected on the surface. Placed in close proximity to the sensing crystal, but shielded from the collected particles, was an identical reference crystal controlling the frequency of another circuit set about 2 kHz higher than that of the sensing crystal. The set of crystals in a stage were closely matched in frequency.<br>
The beat frequency between the two oscillators was the signal indicative of the mass collected. The particle size distribution was obtained by monitoring the frequency change of QCM in each of the 10 stages.<br>
A tip of stainless steel tube (1/4' in diameter) remoted from the QCM Cascade Impactor (TM) was placed very closely to the nip point of the mist generator. To start the measurement the Cascade Impactor was initialized by pushing the initialization button on the front panel of the control unit. The mist generator was set at a speed (either 1,000, 1,500 or 2,000 ft/min) and allowed to run for 10 seconds before taking the sample and then open the sampling knob of the Impactor for a predetermined period time (10 to 30 seconds). After sampling the Impactor was left to idle for additional 50 seconds to let the particles settle in the stages. The amount of collected particles at each stage was calculated by pushing the "final" button on the front panel. The result of the total amount of mist and particle size distribution is printed out to both the CRT of the PC connected via the serial port and the thermal printer on the controller. The data was taken from at least average of three individual runs at a speed. When the individual data<br>
20<br><br>
scattered too much two more measurements were made and then the two extreme values (1 highest and 1 lowest) were discarded before the results were averaged.<br>
Tests were also conducted on a 12" forward roll coater. On a five roll 12 inch diameter production scale forward roll coater the QCM cascade impactor was installed to measure the amount of mist produced at 1,500 ft/min line speed. The tip of stainless steel tube (1/4 inch id.) for sample collection was located at 1 inch away from the nip point of the applicator and nipping rollers of the coater. The coater was run for 10 seconds at 1,500 ft/min and then the mist sample was taken for additional 10 seconds. Two to three data points were taken at a condition and then the average was taken as a result. The average variations were less than 15% of the mean values.<br>
EXAMPLES 1-7 In Examples 1-7 hereinbelow, a methylhydrogensiloxane (A) and an alkenyl siloxane (B) were thoroughly mixed at 25°C. Then, a catalyst (C) was added with thorough mixing at 25°C. The mixture was then brought to the desired reaction temperature and mixed at that temperature for a time sufficient for the viscosity to stabilize (reaction A). If desired, a vinyl functional organic compound or combination of vinyl functional organic compounds (D) was (hen added and the reaction mixture was heated for a sufficient time to completely react the vinyl functional organic compounds (reaction B). Upon completion of the reaction, an inhibitor (E) was added to inhibit the activity of the catalyst and stabilize the product. Table 1 summarizes the reagents used, reaction conditions, and viscosity of the final products. In Table 1 hereinbelow:<br>
(A) denotes a trimethylsiloxy-terminated polydimethylsiloxane polymethylhydrogensiloxane copolymer having a total average degree of polymerization of about 10 with about 50 mol% methylhydrogen moiety on the siloxane chain and a viscosity of about 5 millipascal-seconds.<br>

Table 2 summarizes the mist-suppression performance of these materials, (a) Coating line speed which corresponds to the rpm setting on the mist generator. The mist generator was a laboratory 2-roll coater capable of running at a line speed over 2,000 feet/minute. The 2-roll coater was equipped two 6 inch diameter rollers (bottom roll: rubber coated and top roll: chrome coated), two blades, one on each roll, and a bottom pan for containing the liquid supply. The rubber coated bottom roll was driven by variable speed motor which can cover over 2,000 ft/min. of line speed. The top roll was a nipping roll which is engaged with bottom roll by applying pressure. Since the measurement of mist is very sensitive to the environment the whole system was located in a hood and the hood fan speed was kept low to minimize the influence of turbulence of the hood to the measurement. A vacuum cleaner was attached to each roll surface by using a coat hanger type accessory to sweep the mist away once it passed the measuring point. The coating liquid was supplied either from the button pan or a dam on the top blade against the top metal roller. The bottom pan feeding method was employed for all data reported herein. To obtain consistent results, the pressure settings of top blade and top roller were kept at 10 and 50 psi, respectively and the bottom blade was used as a doctoring blade to regulate the amount of incoming fluid. The coater was made by Euclid Tool and Machines, Bay City, Michigan, (b) Measured using a Model 3225 Aerosizer DSP instrument, manufactured by TSI Corporation. The Aerosizer instrument is capable of measuring the total number of mist particles and particle size distribution in a sample of air drawn through the instrument at<br>
22<br><br>
approximately 3 liters per minute for a set sample time. The sample time for all mist measurements in this document was 30 seconds.<br>
In the Examples, the silicone mist suppressant prepared above was added to a silicone coating in the amount denoted in Table 2 below. The silicone coating was prepared by mixing the following ingredients: 95.5 parts of a dimethylvinylsiloxy -terminated polydimethylsiloxane having an average degree of polymerization of about 130 and a viscosity of about 300 millipascal-seconds, 4.5 parts of a trimethylsiloxy-terrninated polydimethylsiloxane-polymethylhydrogensiloxane copolymer having a total average degree of polymerization of about 40 with about 70 mol% methylhydrogen moiety on the siloxane chain; and 0.1 parts of bis(2-methoxy-l-methylethyl) maleate.<br>
(c) A control coating was run at the identical line speed and was identical to the silicone coating described above except it contained no silicone mist suppressant. The control coating was defined as producing 100% mist. It can be seen from Table 2 that the silicone suppressant compositions of this invention significantly reduces the misting of the control coating.<br>
