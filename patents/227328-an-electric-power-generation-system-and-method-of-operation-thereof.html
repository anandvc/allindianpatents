				<td>AN ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION SYSTEM AND<br>
METHOD OF OPERATION THEREOF<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of The Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an electric power generation system and<br>
method of operation thereof and, generally relates to fuel cell systems and, more<br>
particularly, to fuel cell systems with recirculation of a flud stream.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Electrochemical fuel cell assemblies convert reactants, namely fuel and<br>
oxidant, to generate electric power and reaction products. Electrochemical fuel cell<br>
assemblies generally employ an electrolyte disposed between two electrodes, namely a<br>
cathode and an anode. The electrodes generally each comprise a porous, electrically<br>
conductive sheet material and an electrocatalyst disposed at the interface between the<br>
electrolyte and the electrode layers to induce the desired electrochemical reactions. The<br>
location of the electrocatalyst generally defines the electrochemically active area. â€¢<br>
Solid polymer fuel cell assemblies typically employ a membrane<br>
electrode assembly ("MEA") consisting of a solid polymer electrolyte, or ion exchange<br>
membrane, disposed between two electrode layers. The membrane, in addition to being<br>
an ion conductive (typically proton conductive) material, also acts as a barrier for<br>
isolating the reactant (i.e., fuel and oxidant) streams from each other.<br>
The MEA is typically interposed between two separator plates, which are<br>
substantially impermeable to the reactant fluid streams, to form a fuel cell assembly.<br>
The plates act as current collectors, provide support for the adjacent electrodes, and<br>
typically contain flow field channels for supplying reactants to the MEA or for<br>
circulating coolant. The plates are typically known as flow field plates. The fuel cell<br>
assembly is typically compressed to ensure good electrical contact between the plates<br>
and the electrodes, as well as good sealing between fuel cell components. A plurality of<br>
fuel cell assemblies may be combined electrically, in series or in parallel, to form a fuel<br>
cell stack. In a fuel cell stack, a plate may be shared between two adjacent fuel cell<br>
assemblies, in which case the plate also separates the fluid streams of the two adjacent<br><br>
fuel cell assemblies. Such plates are commonly referred to as bipolar plates and may<br>
have flow channels for directing fuel and oxidant, or a reactant and coolant, on each<br>
major surface, respectively.<br>
The fuel stream that is supplied to the anode typically comprises<br>
hydrogen. For example, the fuel stream may be a gas such as substantially pure<br>
hydrogen or a reformate stream containing hydrogen. The oxidant stream, which is<br>
supplied to the cathode, typically comprises oxygen, such as substantially pure oxygen,<br>
or a dilute oxygen stream such as air.<br>
Each of the fuel cells making up a stack is typically flooded with the<br>
selected fuel and oxidant at a desired pressure. In certain systems, the desired pressure<br>
is kept constant regardless of load demand, while in other systems the desired pressure<br>
varies according to load demand. In all systems however, the desired pressure is<br>
generally controlled by a regulator at the source of the reactant. Such regulators can<br>
take many forms. For example, where the reactant originates from a source where gas<br>
pressure is higher than the desired pressure, the regulator can take the form of a variable<br>
opening valve system, which lets in as little or as much flow as necessary to<br>
maintain/attain the desired pressure: such regulators are typically called pressure<br>
regulators. In another example, where the reactant originates from a source where gas<br>
pressure is lower than the desired pressure, the regulator can take the form of a<br>
compressor. In yet another example, where the reactant originates from a source where<br>
gas pressure is substantially the same as the desired pressure, the regulator can take the<br>
form of a blower. More than one form of regulator can exist in a system. For example,<br>
Merritt et al, U.S. Pat. No. 5,441,821 discloses a system where the fuel originates from<br>
a high pressure source (pressurized hydrogen) and is controlled by a pressure regulator<br>
before reaching the stack, while the oxidant originates from a low pressure source (the<br>
environment) and is controlled by nn air compressor (i.e., the air is compressed before<br>
reaching the stack).<br>
Pressure regulators operate on a differential basis as the desired pressure<br>
is always set in relation to another pressure, which can be constant (e.g., maintain/attain<br>
a desired pressure over atmospheric pressure) or variable (e.g., maintain/attain a desired<br>
pressure over the pressure in some other part of the system, such other pressure being<br><br>
variable). For example, in the system disclosed by Merrill et al., U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,441,821, the compressor sets the desired oxidant pressure in relation to a constant<br>
pressure (atmospheric pressure), while the valve-type pressure regulator sets the desired<br>
fuel stream pressure according to a variable pressure, more specifically to<br>
maintain/attain a desired steady-slate pressure differential between the fuel and oxidant<br>
streams.<br>
Each reactant stream exiting the fuel cell stack generally contains useful<br>
reactant products, such as water and unconsumed fuel or oxidant, which can be made<br>
use of by the fuel cell system. On way to make use of such useful reactant products is<br>
to recirculate the exhaust reactant streams. Therefore, for example, recirculating the<br>
hydrogen exhaust stream to the anode inlet leads to a more efficient system as it<br>
minimizes waste that would result from venting the unconsumed hydrogen to the<br>
atmosphere.<br>
As outlined in Merritt et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,441,821, one way to effect<br>
hydrogen recirculation is through the use of a jet ejector, where the ejector's motive<br>
inlet is fluidly connected to the pressurized hydrogen supply, the ejector's suction inlet<br>
is fluidly connected to the hydrogen exhaust outlet and the ejector's discharge outlet is<br>
fluidly connected to the fuel cell stack's hydrogen stream inlet. As a result, according to<br>
the well known operation of jet ejectors, the hydrogen supply stream entrains (and<br>
therefore recirculates) the relatively low pressure hydrogen exhaust stream, with the two<br>
streams mixing before entering the fuel cell stack's anode inlet.<br>
In light of the wide spectrum of fuel cell stack hydrogen inlet stream<br>
flow rates over which the jet ejector must operate, it has proven difficult to design a<br>
satisfactory jet ejector. Designing a jet ejector to supply the needed inlet flow rate to the<br>
fuel cell stack during maximum-load demand periods results in the nozzle and/or the<br>
throat portion of the diffuser being too large to recirculate the needed hydrogen during<br>
low-load demand periods (e.g., idle periods). Conversely, designing a jet ejector to<br>
recirculate the needed hydrogen during low-load demand periods results in the nozzle<br>
and/or the throat portion of the diffuser being too small to supply the needed inlet flow<br>
rate to the fuel cell stack during maximum-load demand periods.<br><br>
To address the foregoing problem, a two-stage changeover ejector<br>
system has been proposed by Tatsuya et a]., Japan Publ. No. 2001-266922, where one of<br>
either a low-flow or high-flow ejector is used depending on the conditions prevailing at<br>
the time. However, having two separate ejectors and the related fluid circuitry leads to<br>
space requirement concerns in typical automotive applications. Furthermore, the<br>
transition point in such systems, more specifically when the motive flow course is<br>
changed from the low-flow to the high-flow ejector, typically experiences a sudden drop<br>
in recirculation that often falls below the needed minimum entrainement level. Adding<br>
further ejectors would alleviate the transition point concern but, in turn, would<br>
aggravate the space requirement concerns.<br>

applications. Furthermore, in the ejector system know from Japan- Publ. No.<br>
2001-266922, in dependence on the load conditions of a fuel cell, a three way<br>
valve changes the motive flow course so that the motive flow is no longer<br>
supplied to the low-flow ejector, but only to the high-flow ejector. Hence, the<br>
transition point in such systems, more specifically when the motive flow course is<br>
changed from the low-flow to the high-flow ejector, typically experiences a<br>
sudden drop in recirculation that often falls below the needed minimum<br>
entrainment level. Adding further ejectors would alleviate the transition point<br>
concern but, in turn, would aggravate the space requirement concerns.<br><br>
US 2002/0022171 A1 discloses fuel cell system comprising a fuel supply<br>
ejector unit with a low-flow ejector and a high-flow ejector. A switching valve,<br>
similar to the three way valve know from Japan Publ. No. 2001-266922, controls<br>
the flow of hydrogen to the low-flow and the high-flow ejectors in dependence on<br>
the load conditions of the fuel cell. During low-load operating conditions the<br>
switching valve directs the flow of hydrogen only to the low-flow ejector. In<br>
contrast, during high-load operating conditions the switching valve directs the<br>
flow of hydrogen only to the high-flow ejector, while the low-flow ejector does not<br>
operate. As a result, also in the fuel cell system known from US 2002/0022171<br>
A1 the transition point experiences a sudden drop in recirculation.<br>
There is therefore a need for a fuel cell system, with recirculation of a<br>
fluid stream, that can operate efficiently over the whole range of a fuel cell stack's<br>
operating conditions and that addresses some of the space requirement concerns typical<br>
in vehicular applications. The present invention addresses these and other needs, and<br>
provides further related advantages.<br>

referred to below as high-flow ejector H), a high-flow check valve 5H, a suction inlet 6,<br>
fluidly connected to common suction chamber 2, a low-flow motive inlet 7L, fluidly<br><br>
connected to low-flow nozzle 3L, a high-flow motive inlet 7H, fluidly connected to<br>
high-flow nozzle 3H, and a discharge outlet 8, fluidly connected to low-flow and high-<br>
flow diffusers 4L and 4H. Suction inlet 6 is configured to receive a recirculated flow R<br>
from a fuel cell stack's exhaust stream outlet, low-flow motive inlet 7L and high-flow<br>
motive inlet 7H are configured to receive a motive flow M from a supply stream source<br>
and discharge outlet 8 is configured to provide an inlet stream S to a fuel cell stack.<br>
Inlet stream S is therefore formed by the merger of recirculated flow R and motive flow<br>
M.<br>
Having common suction chamber 2 allows for a more compact design<br>
when compared to systems with two (or more) separate jet ejectors. Common suction<br>
chamber 2 is typically cylindrical, but is not limited to such geometrical characteristic.<br>
Low-flow ejector L is designed to operate efficiently in the low-load<br>
spectrum of operating conditions of a fuel cell stack. Specifically, low-flow ejector L is<br>
designed so that low-flow nozzle 3L and low-flow diffuser 4L are as large as possible<br>
keeping in mind that, at idle operating conditions, a sufficient suction must be created in<br>
common suction chamber 2 to entrain recirculated flow R and a sufficient inlet stream S<br>
must be provided.<br>
High-flow ejector II is designed to operate efficiently in the medium to<br>
high-load spectrum of operating conditions of a fuel cell stack. Specifically, high-flow<br>
ejector H is designed so that high-flow nozzle 3H and high-flow diffuser 4H are as<br>
small as possible keeping in mind that, at maximum flow conditions, a sufficient<br>
suction must be created in common suction chamber 2 to entrain recirculated flow R<br>
and a sufficient inlet stream S must be provided. Maximum flow conditions not only<br>
include the flow necessary during full-load operating conditions of the fuel cell stack,<br>
but also include the flow necessary during purging operations and during fuel cell<br>
system pressure increase operations.<br>
To avoid flow, exiting either one of low-flow ejector L or high-flow<br>
ejector H, from returning to common suction chamber 2 via the other ejector, one-way<br>
valves are placed at each ejector's outlet. In this embodiment, low-flow and high-flow<br>
one-way check valves 5L and 5H are positioned at the end of diffusers 4L and 4<br>
respectively, the check valves being simple flap valves which allow streams SL and SH<br><br>
to flow out of diffusers 4L and 4H respectively, but nothing to flow in. Stream SL<br>
and/or stream SH produce(s) inlet stream S.<br>
To avoid check valves, a single diffuser may be placed downstream of<br>
low-flow nozzle 3L and high-flow nozzle 3H, i.e., common suction chamber 2 would<br>
be fluidly connected to a single diffuser which, in turn, would produce inlet stream S.<br>
However aligning more than one nozzle with a single diffuser may be problematic: any<br>
flow exiting a nozzle and entering a diffuser off such diffuser's central axis can lead to<br>
decreases in flow optimization. Furthermore, each nozzle works optimally with a<br>
particular diffuser configuration: having a single diffuser for both nozzles can also lead<br>
to decreases in flow optimization.<br>
For reasons of manufacturing simplicity amongst others, low-flow nozzle<br>
3L and high-flow nozzle 3H are typically subsonic (i.e., low-flow nozzle 3L and high-<br>
flow nozzle 3H cannot generate supersonic flow). It is however understood that<br>
supersonic nozzles arc possible pursuant to the invention. Therefore, in one<br>
embodiment (subsonic nozzles), low-flow ejector L has a choking point, beyond which<br>
increases of motive flow M to low-flow ejector L results in lower rates of increase in<br>
the suction power of low-flow ejector L and in the flow of inlet stream S.<br>
Consequently, the transition point T, where the course of motive flow M is switched<br>
from low-flow ejector L to high-flow ejector H, typically occurs around the point where<br>
low-flow ejector L starts choking motive flow M However, it is understood that<br>
transition point T can occur at other points.<br>
When motive flow M is switched from low-flow ejector L to high-flow<br>
ejector H, the pressure of motive flow M is reduced, as high-flow ejector II needs a<br>
lower pressure motive flow M than low-flow ejector L does to generate the same inlet<br>
stream S. From transition point T onwards, the pressure of motive flow M (now<br>
directed to high-flow ejector H) then starts increasing again until full-load conditions.<br>
The consequent problem with the pressure of motive flow M being reduced when<br>
transition point T is reached, is that the suction in common suction chamber 2 (now<br>
generated by high-flow ejector H) experiences a drop leading to a temporary inadequate<br>
suction level ("transition point T problem"): only as the pressure of motive flow M<br><br>
starts increasing again will the needed suction in common suction chamber 2 be<br>
generated by high-flow ejector H.<br>
Having motive flow M feed both low-flow ejector L and high-flow<br>
ejector H from transition point T onwards (as opposed to switching motive flow M<br>
from low-flow ejector L to high-flow ejector H) may not help to satisfactorily address<br>
the transition point T problem, as explained in further details below, with reference to<br>
Figure 2.<br>
Figure 2 shows double jet ejector 1 being operated on the anode side of a<br>
fuel cell stack system where the desired fuel stream pressure is to be maintained at a<br>
desired steady-slate pressure differential with the oxidant stream. Such differential can<br>
be zero or negative, but it is typically positive (i.e., fuel stream pressure higher than<br>
oxidant stream pressure) as leakage of fuel into the oxidant stream due to MEA failure<br>
is preferred to leakage of oxidant into the fuel stream.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figure 2, fuel originates from a high<br>
pressure source (pressurized hydrogen) and is controlled by pressure regulator 9.<br>
Pressure regulator 9 is configured to maintain a desired steady-state pressure differential<br>
between anode inlet stream AIS and cathode inlet stream CIS (for reasons of simplicity,<br>
the source of cathode inlet stream CIS is not shown in Figure 2). Pressure regulator 9<br>
controls motive flow M directed to double jet ejector 1 and on-off solenoid valve 8H<br>
controls the feed of motive flow M to high-flow ejector H. The system shown in Figure<br>
2 operates as follows: from idle conditions upwards, regulator 9 controls motive flow M<br>
directed to low-flow ejector L. When transition point T is reached, solenoid valve 8H<br>
opens. In the current embodiment, transition point T is determined in relation to the<br>
pressure of motive flow M. Consequently, a pressure transducer P, which measures the<br>
pressure of motive flow M, controls solenoid valve 8H. It is however understood that<br>
transition point T can be determined in relation to other factors, such as the state of<br>
regulator 9 or the rate of increase in the pressure of anode inlet stream AIS, in which<br>
case other apparatus besides pressure transducer P would control the opening and<br>
closing of solenoid valve 8H.<br>
As transition point T is reached and solenoid valve 8H opens, regulator 9<br>
automatically reduces the pressure of motive flow M (indeed, a lower pressure motive<br><br>
flow M is now needed to be fed to high-flow ejector H than was needed to be fed to<br>
low-flow ejector L in order to generate the same inlet stream S that was occurring as<br>
transition point T was reached). Regulator 9 then starts increasing the pressure of<br>
motive flow M again, until full-load conditions are reached. However, this may not<br>
satisfactorily address the transition point T problem because the reduction in suction in<br>
common suction chamber 2 consequent on low-flow ejector L being fed a lower<br>
pressure motive flow M is typically not compensated for by the suction high-flow<br>
ejector H is able to generate with such low pressure motive flow M (so that an<br>
unacceptable suction drop occurs in common suction chamber 2).<br>
Adding further ejectors between low-flow ejector L and high-flow<br>
ejector H, all sharing a common suction chamber (i.e., having a triple or quadruple jet<br>
ejector), is one option for addressing the transition point T problem. However, this<br>
option may create manufacturing and spatial arrangement concerns. Another option is<br>
with the use of a regulator 19 and three on-off solenoid valves (18H, 18L and 18B), as<br>
shown in Figure 3. Operation of double jet ejector 1 according to this embodiment is as<br>
follows.<br>
Starting at idle flow conditions (low-load condition), by-pass solenoid<br>
valve 18B and high-flow solenoid valve 18H arc closed, while low-flow solenoid valve<br>
18L is open. As a result, a first motive flow Ml, controlled by regulator 19 is directed<br>
exclusively to low-flow ejector L (via low-flow motive inlet 17L). When transition<br>
point T is reached, low-flow solenoid valve 18L closes and high-flow solenoid valve<br>
18H opens, so that first motive flow M1, controlled by regulator 19, is directed to high-<br>
flow ejector H (via high-flow motive inlet 17H): for the reasons explained above, when<br>
first motive flow M1 is switched from low-flow ejector L to high-flow ejector H (i.e.,<br>
when transition point T is reached), regulator 19 reduces the pressure of first motive<br>
flow M1 and then starts increasing it again. However, the typical consequent suction<br>
drop in common suction chamber 2 does not occur because of the following reasons.<br>
At substantially the same time as when transition point T is reached, by-<br>
pass solenoid valve 18B opens, so that second motive flow M2 is directed to low-flow<br>
ejector L (via by-pass line 20). Although it can be determined in relation to other<br>
factors, in the current embodiment, transition point T is determined in relation to the<br><br>
pressure of first motive flow M1 via pressure transducer P. More specifically,<br>
transition point T occurs when the pressure of first motive flow Ml, controlled by<br>
regulator 19, is substantially the same as that of the pressurized hydrogen supply. As a<br>
result, when transition point T occurs, the closing of low-flow solenoid valve 18L and<br>
the opening of by-pass solenoid valve 18B results in substantially no feed change to<br>
low-flow ejector L, as first motive flow Ml, which is substantially the same as that of<br>
the pressurized hydrogen supply, is replaced by second motive flow M2, which is also<br>
substantially the same as that of the pressurized hydrogen supply. Consequently, low-<br>
flow ejector L continues to provide the required suction in common suction chamber 2<br>
as well as the required anode inlet stream AIS. As a result, the reduction in the pressure<br>
of first motive flow M1 by the action of regulator 19, when transition point T occurs,<br>
does not result in an unsatisfactory suction drop in common suction chamber 2. Past<br>
transition point T, regulator 19 then starts increasing the pressure of first motive flow<br>
Ml, so that high-flow ejector H starts to increasingly contributing to anode inlet stream<br>
AIS as well as the required suction in common suction chamber 2.<br>
The underlying principle behind the system outlined above and shown in<br>
Figure 3 can also be employed with multiple jet ejectors (such as triple and quadruple<br>
jet ejectors). Indeed, the principle of feeding lower-flow ejectors with full flow as<br>
higher-flow ejectors are being used is not intrinsically limited to double jet ejectors.<br>
However, as the number of jet ejectors increases, so does the number of regulators and<br>
solenoid valves, consequently creating spatial arrangement concerns.<br>
Whereas the above described embodiment can adequately handle up-<br>
transient conditions in typical motor vehicle application, problems could arise in severe<br>
down-transient conditions. Indeed, referring to Figure 3, a rapid load reduction would<br>
not only result in high-flow solenoid valve 18H and by-pass solenoid valve 18B being<br>
closed and low-flow solenoid valve 18L being opened, but also in regulator 19 being<br>
temporarily closed. Although this would address the request to rapidly reduce the<br>
supply of anode inlet stream AIS, it would result in an undesirable stoppage of<br>
recirculated flow R. As shown in Figure 4, this problem can be addressed by adding an<br>
ultra-low-flow ejector UL that would be constantly fed with a third motive flow M3,<br>
which is substantially the same as that of the pressurized hydrogen supply, irrespective<br><br>
of operating conditions (thereby creating a triple-jet ejector 10). In one embodiment,<br>
the nozzle of ultra-low-flow ejector UL is positioned in common suction chamber 2,<br>
along with low-flow ejector L and high-flow ejector H , as it is the most efficient<br>
location from a space-saving perspective; it is however possible to have the nozzle of<br>
ultra-low-flow ejector UL positioned in a different suction chamber pursuant to the<br>
invention. Ultra-low-flow ejector UL is designed to supply a percentage of idle-load<br>
requirement and still provide the necessary suction in common suction chamber 2 to<br>
maintain a minimum recirculated flow R.<br>
Because ultra-low-flow ejector UL is constantly fed with a high pressure<br>
stream, there is typically no likelihood of having flow, exiting either one of low-flow<br>
ejector L or high-flow ejector H, returning to common suction chamber 2 via ultra-low-<br>
flow ejector UL. Consequently, there is typically no need to have a one-way check<br>
valve positioned at the downstream end of ultra-low-flow ejector UL. It is however<br>
understood that particularities of a fuel cell system may require that a one-way check<br>
valve be positioned at the downstream end of ultra-low-flow ejector UL.<br>
It should be noted that, according to the invention, the functions<br>
performed by a valve-type regulator and a down-stream on-off solenoid valve can be<br>
combined in a pulse-width modulated valve, such as a fuel ejector. For example,<br>
referring to Figure 4, by replacing on-off solenoid valves (i.e., 18H and 18L) with<br>
pulse-width modulated valves, regulator 19 could be eliminated. Not only can the<br>
pressure of motive flow M reaching low-flow ejector L/high-flow ejector H be<br>
controlled by the modulated valves (by varying the pulse width), but whether motive<br>
flow M reaches low-flow ejector L and/or high-flow ejector H can also be controlled<br>
(by leaving the modulated valves either closed or in operation).<br>
Another way to address the transition point T problem is to replace the<br>
three on-off solenoid valves (18H, 18L and 18B) shown in Figures 3 and 4 with a<br>
second regulator, with each regulator configured to maintain a different desired steady-<br>
state pressure differential between anode inlet stream AIS and cathode inlet stream CIS.<br>
Figure 5 shows how this change would apply to the system shown in Figure 3 (but it is<br>
understood that the system shown in Figure 4 could similarly be modified).<br><br>
Referring to Figure 5. high-flow regulator 29H is fluidly connected to<br>
high-flow motive inlet 17H and controls motive flow MH directed to high-flow ejector<br>
H, whereas low-flow regulator 29L is fluidly connected to low-flow motive inlet 17L<br>
and controls motive flow ML directed to low-flow ejector L. High-flow regulator 29H<br>
is configured to maintain a desired steady-state pressure differential PDH and low-flow<br>
regulator 29L is configured to maintain a desired steady-state pressure differential PDL,<br>
with steady-state pressure differential PDH being lower than steady-state pressure<br>
differential PDL (PDH 
configured to maintain the pressure of anode inlet stream AIS at 1 pound-per-square-<br>
inch (psi) over the desired steady-state pressure of cathode inlet stream CIS {i.e.,<br>
desired steady-state pressure differential PDH is +lpsi) and low-flow regulator 29L<br>
may be configured to maintain the pressure of anode inlet stream AIS at 4 psi over the<br>
desired steady-state pressure of cathode inlet stream CIS {i.e., desired steady-state<br>
pressure differential PDL is +4psi).<br>
Referring to Figure 5 and Figure 5 A, the latter being an ideal graph of a<br>
fuel cell system's differential pressure against load demand during operation of the fuel<br>
cell system of Figure 5, a fuel cell system would operate as follows. Referring to line A<br>
of Figure 5A, at low-load demand, the system would be operating at the higher steady-<br>
state pressure differential PDL {i.e.. referring to the above noted example, the system<br>
would be operating at +4psi pressure differential). As load-demand increases, low-flow<br>
regulator 29L opens to maintain such higher steady-state pressure differential PDL, i.e.,<br>
low-flow regulator 29L would vary motive flow ML. Meanwhile, high-flow regulator<br>
29H would remain closed as it would be detecting a pressure differential (PDL) that is<br>
higher than what it is trying to maintain (PDH), i.e., high-flow regulator 29H would not<br>
direct any motive flow MH to high-flow ejector H. When low-flow regulator 29L is<br>
fully opened, further load-demand increases result in a fall in the pressure differential of<br>
the system (as the pressure of anode inlet stream AIS can no longer be satisfactorily<br>
increased versus the increasing pressure of cathode inlet stream CIS). As soon as such<br>
pressure differential endeavors to fall below lower steady-state pressure differential<br>
PDH (i.e., referring to the above noted example, as soon as the system's pressure<br>
differential endavour to fall below +1psi pressure differential), high-flow regulator 29H<br><br>
starts to open to maintain such lower steady-state pressure differential PDH (i.e., high-<br>
flow regulator 29H would vary motive flow MH). Meanwhile, low-flow regulator 29L<br>
remains fully opened as it is attempting, without success, to bring back the pressure<br>
differential to the higher steady-state pressure differential PDL (i.e., referring to the<br>
above noted example, low-flow regulator 29L is attempting, without success, to<br>
increase the pressure of anode inlet stream AIS so that it is 4psi over the pressure of<br>
cathode inlet stream CIS). This embodiment is advantageous where transition point T<br>
is to occur when further increases in the pressure of motive flow ML leads to<br>
inadequate increases in the pressure of anode inlet stream ATS. It has the advantage of<br>
not requiring the circuitry necessary in the embodiments shown in Figures 3 and<br>
4. However, where transition point T is to occur before further increases in the pressure<br>
of motive flow ML leads to inadequate increases in the pressure of anode inlet stream<br>
AIS, this embodiment is not advantageous. Furthermore, this embodiment may not be<br>
advantageous in fuel cell systems where operations at varying desired steady-state<br>
pressure differential may lead to undesirable instabilities.<br>
It is understood that negative desired steady-state pressure differentials<br>
are possible pursuant to the invention. For example, high-flow regulator 29H could be<br>
configured to maintain the pressure of anode inlet stream AIS at 4 pound-per-square-<br>
inch (psi) below the desired steady-state pressure of cathode inlet stream CIS (i.e.,<br>
desired steady-state pressure differential PDH is -4psi). Low-flow regulator 29L could<br>
then be configured to maintain the pressure of anode inlet stream AIS at 1 psi below the<br>
desired steady-state pressure of cathode inlet stream CIS (i.e., desired steady-state<br>
pressure differential PDL is -1psi), so that steady-state pressure differential PDH<br>
remains lower than steady-state pressure differential PDL (PDH 
embodiment is represented by line B in Figure 5A.<br>
Another way to address the transition point T problem is to replace the<br>
three on-off solenoid valves (18H, 18L and 18B) and the regulator (9 or 19) shown in<br>
Figures 3 and 4 with a double-action pressure regulator, which will be described in<br>
further details below. Figure 6 shows how this change would apply to the system<br>
shown in Figure 3 (but it is understood that the system shown in Figure 4 could<br>
similarly be modified). Referring to Figure 6, double-action pressure regulator 800 has<br><br>
one inlet 801, fluidly connected to a high pressure source (pressurized hydrogen), and<br>
two outlets, high-flow outlet 802 and low-flow outlet 803. High-flow outlet 802 is<br>
fluidly connected to high-flow motive inlet 17H and feeds motive flow MH to high-<br>
flow ejector H, whereas low-flow outlet 803 is fluidly connected to low-flow motive<br>
inlet 17L and feeds motive flow ML to low-flow ejector L. As will be explained in<br>
more details below, double-action pressure regulator 800 regulates both motive flow<br>
MH and motive flow ML to maintain a desired steady-state pressure differential<br>
between anode inlet stream AIS and cathode inlet stream CIS.<br>
Figure 7 is a side sectional view of an embodiment of double-action<br>
pressure regulator 800 illustrated schematically in Figure 6. As described above,<br>
pressure regulator 800 has one regulator inlet 801, fluidly connected to a high pressure<br>
source, and high and low flow outlets 802 and 803, fluidly connected to high-flow<br>
ejector M and low-flow ejector L, respectively, of Figure 6. Pressure regulator 800 also<br>
has a first passage 805, fluidly connecting regulator inlet 801 and low-flow outlet 803,<br>
and a second passage 804, fluidly connecting regulator inlet 801 and high-flow outlet<br>
802. Furthermore, pressure regulator 800 is fluidly connected to a reference fuel<br>
feedback line 830 from anode inlet stream AIS and to a reference oxidant feedback line<br>
850 from cathode inlet stream CIS.<br>
In operation, reference fuel feedback line 830 is fed into fuel reference<br>
chamber 831 and reference oxidant feedback line 850 is fed into oxidant reference<br>
chamber 851. Fuel and oxidant reference chambers 831 and 851 are fluidly separated<br>
by a flexible membrane 840 which is biased to be in a state of equilibrium whenever the<br>
pressure differential between the two chambers (831 and 851) is substantially the same<br>
as the desired steady-state pressure differential between anode inlet stream AIS and<br>
cathode inlet stream CIS (for the sake of clarity, the biasing means are not shown in<br>
Figure 7).<br>
Pressure regulator 800 can be used advantageously in a system where the<br>
desired pressure in a first stream is set according to load demand and the desired<br>
pressure in a second stream is varied to maintain a desired steady-state pressure<br>
differential between the first and the second stream. For example, in a system where<br>
desired oxidant pressure is set according to load demand, the desired fuel stream<br><br>
pressure can be regulated by pressure regulator 800 to maintain the desired steady-state<br>
pressure differential between the fuel and oxidant streams.<br>
In such systems, a load increase results in an increase in oxidant<br>
pressure, which leads to a decrease in the pressure of the reference fuel stream relative<br>
to the pressure of the reference oxidant stream. As a result, flexible membrane 840<br>
moves towards fuel reference chamber 831. Flexible membrane 840 contacts first end<br>
811 of first movable stem 810 and depresses first movable stem 810, and consequently<br>
first plug 815. First plug 815 may be conically shaped so that its movement inside first<br>
passage 805 leads to its gradual opening (or closure). Therefore, the movement of<br>
flexible membrane 840 gradually opens first passage 805 and directs the pressurized<br>
fuel stream to low-flow ejector L through low-flow outlet 803.<br>
First movable stem 810 is positioned inside an inner axial passage of a<br>
second movable stem 820, so that the fluid connection between regulator inlet 801 and<br>
low-flow outlet 803 occurs via the volume of the passage within second movable stem<br>
820 not taken up by first movable stem 810. The volume of the passage within second<br>
movable stem 820 not taken up by First movable stem 810 must be large enough to<br>
allow a sufficient flow from regulator inlet 801 to low flow outlet 803.<br>
First plug 815 will continue to open first passage 805 until the desired<br>
steady-state pressure differential between the fuel and oxidant streams is restored, al<br>
which point flexible membrane 840 will stop moving and settle into a new equilibrium<br>
point.<br>
However, for certain load increases, opening first passage 805 fully will<br>
not restore the desired steady-state pressure differential between the fuel and oxidant<br>
streams (i.e., low-flow ejector L is no longer able restore the desired steady-state<br>
pressure differential). As a result, flexible membrane 840 will continue its movement<br>
towards fuel reference chamber 831. After travelling a set distance X, protrusion 813 of<br>
first movable stem 810 contacts first end 821 of second movable stem 820. In the<br>
embodiment shown in Figure 7, protrusion 813 has a flat lower portion which is shaped<br>
to contact satisfactorily with first end 821. However, it is understood that various<br>
combinations of shapes are possible. Furthermore, in the embodiment shown in Figure<br>
7, distance X is set so that, when protrusion 813 contacts first end 821, first passage 805<br><br>
is fully opened. However, it is understood that distance X is set so that protrusion 813<br>
contacts first end 821 when transition point T is reached which, as outlined above, may<br>
occur at various points.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figure 7, when protrusion 813 of first<br>
movable stem 810 contacts first end 821 of second movable stem 820, the fluid<br>
connection between regulator inlet 801 and low-flow outlet 803 is interfered with.<br>
Consequently, openings 860 are present in first end 821 of second movable stem 820. It<br>
is however understood that a protrusion that does not interfere with the fluid connection<br>
between regulator inlet 801 and low-flow outlet 803 is possible pursuant to the<br>
invention, so first end 821 of second movable stem 820 without openings 860 is<br>
possible.<br>
After protrusion 813 contacts first end 821 of second movable stem 820,<br>
further movement of flexible membrane 840 towards fuel reference chamber 831<br>
depresses second movable stem 820. and consequently second plug 825. Second plug<br>
825 may be conically shaped so thai its movement inside second passage 804 leads to<br>
its gradual opening (or closure). Therefore, the movement of flexible membrane 840<br>
after protrusion 813 contacts first end 821 of second movable stem 820, gradually opens<br>
second passage 804 and directs pressurized fuel stream to high-flow ejector H through<br>
high-flow outlet 802. Second plug 825 will continue to open second passage 804 until<br>
the desired steady-state pressure differential between the fuel and oxidant streams is<br>
restored, at which point flexible membrane 840 will stop moving and settle into a new<br>
equilibrium point.<br>
As further shown in Figure 7, both first plug 815 and second plug 825<br>
engage first and second spring mechanisms 818 and 828, respectively. First and second<br>
spring mechanisms 818 and 828 enable the foregoing process to be repeated in reverse<br>
(i.e., in a load decrease situation). First and second spring mechanisms 818 and 828<br>
also assist in having fuel not seep past the relevant plug (i.e., first and second plugs 815<br>
and 825) when the relevant movable stem (i.e., first and second movable stem 810 and<br>
820) is not depressed; it should however be noted that this is mainly accomplished by<br>
the effect of the high pressure source being fluidly connected to first and second plugs<br>
815 and 825 (via regulator inlet 801).<br><br>
In order not to unduly interfere with the biasing means, which ensure that<br>
there is a state of equilibrium whenever the pressure differential between the two<br>
chambers (831 and 851) is substantially the same as the desired steady-state pressure<br>
differential between anode inlet stream AIS and cathode inlet stream CIS, first and<br>
second spring mechanisms 818 and 828 generate significantly lesser forces than such<br>
biasing means.<br>
Although the embodiment shown in Figure 7 is configured to regulate<br>
flow to double-ejectors, it is understood that the invention is not limited to such<br>
embodiment. Indeed, such embodiment can be modified to regulate multiple jet-<br>
ejectors (e.g., triple or quadruple jet ejectors) by adding further movable stems and<br>
associated plugs, which gradually open further passages and direct pressurized fuel<br>
stream to further ejectors through further outlets.<br>
Furthermore, although the foregoing examples relate to power generation<br>
systems in which the fluid fuel stream is recirculated, it is understood that a jet ejector<br>
could also be incorporated into a fuel cell based electric power generation system<br>
employing substantially pure oxygen, originating from a high-pressure source, as the<br>
oxidant stream, the jet ejector being used to recirculate the exhaust oxidant stream. In<br>
this regard, essentially the same principles set forth above with respect to jet ejector<br>
