Field of Invention; -<br>
The present invention relates to an electromagnetic based braking system for<br>
vehicles. The invention is applicable to braking of all types of rotary wheels.<br>
The field may range from automobile braking including heavy vehicles, braking<br>
in rail locomotives to braking of motors.<br>
Background of Invention: -<br>
The operation performed in braking is the reverse of that carried out in<br>
acceleration. In the latter, the heat energy of the fuel is converted into the<br>
kinetic energy of the car, whereas in the former, the kinetic energy of the car is<br>
converted into heat. Again, just as when driving the car the torque of the<br>
engine produces a tractive effort at the periphery of the driving wheels, so,<br>
when the brakes are applied the braking torque introduced at the brake drums<br>
produce a negative tractive effort or retarding effort at the periphery of the<br>
braking wheels.<br>
The two distinct demands are made upon the brakes of motor vehicles. First, in<br>
emergencies  they must bring the vehicle to  rest in  the  shortest possible<br>
distance, and secondly, they must enable control of the vehicle to be retained<br>
when descending long hills.<br>
The types of brakes that are used at present may be classified into 3 groups as<br>
follows: -<br>
1.	Friction brakes<br>
2.	Fluid brakes and<br>
3.	Electric brakes.<br>
1. Friction Brakes: -<br><br>
The vast majority or me Drakes are triction brakes and they may be sub-divided into a) drum brakes and b) disc brakes, according to whether the braked member is a drum or a disc.<br>
Drum brakes are still widely used and are invariably expanding brakes in which the brake shoes are brought into contact with the inside of the brake drum by means of an expanding mechanism. External contracting brakes are now used only in epicyclic gearboxes. A conventional drum brake is explained in US patent US6,622,833. This discloses a drum braking device provided as a wheel brake for motor vehicles and the actuating mechanism used in drum brakes. This invention has an advantage of applying a frictional brake on the brake belt which results in a speedy braking of the vehicles.<br>
Disadvantages of drum brakes include expansion due to rise of temperature and lowering of efficiency due to the occurrence of wear. Also, braking is less effective at high speeds and in moist or wet conditions.<br>
A disc brake consists of a cast iron disc bolted to the wheel hub and a stationary housing called caliper. The caliper is connected to some stationary part of the vehicle, like the stub axle and is cast into 2 parts, each part containing a piston. In between each piston and the disc, there is a friction pad held in position by retaining pins, spring plates etc., passages are drilled in calipers for the fluid to enter or leave each housing. These passages are also connected to another one for bleeding. Each cylinder contains a rubber sealing between the cylinder and the piston.<br>
When the brakes are applied, hydraulically actuated pistons move the friction pads into contact with the disc applying equal and opposite forces on the latter. On releasing the brakes, the rubber sealing rings and the friction pads away from the disc.<br><br>
The major limitations of frictional braking systems are the linkages consisting of levers rods and wires which may fail in the course of time due to wear and also climatic conditions working conditions do influence the performance.<br>
2.	Fluid brakes: -<br>
The principle of the fluid brake is that a chamber has an impeller inside it that is rotated by the motion of the wheels so that if the chamber is filled with fluid, a churning action occurs and kinetic energy is converted into heat thereby providing a braking effort. The US patent US 6,375,278 refers to a hydraulic parking brake for a rail car vehicle. The parking brake of this invention includes an electric motor controlling a hydraulic pump fluidly connected to and controlling a bidirectional hydraulic actuator for the wheel brakes.<br>
3.	The electric braking: -<br>
The electric brake is in effect, an electric generator which being driven by the wheels converts kinetic energy into an electric current and hence by the passing the current through a resistance into heat. The eddy current braking is an example.<br>
The eddy current brake employs the same principle as the eddy current clutch the rotor is coupled to the road wheels being often mounted on a shaft that is interposed between the gear box and the propeller shaft and the stator is mounted on the frame of the vehicle. The heat generated is dissipated chiefly by the convection but this may be augmented by some kind of fan which may be incorporated into the rotor.<br>
This type of brake suffers from the same draw back as the fluid brake namely that it cannot provide any effort at zero speed and can be used only to supplement a friction brake. A fairly large number of such brakes are in use at present as retarders.<br><br>
Thus the existing actuating systems has its own disadvantages and none of the<br>
prior art reveals the use of electromagnetic technique in braking system of the<br>
vehicle.<br>
Object of the invention; -<br>
The objective of the invention is to provide efficient and fail proof reliable<br>
braking.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an electromagnetic<br>
based braking system for vehicles.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is the use of the electromagnetic<br>
braking mechanism in heavy traffic vehicle (HVT).<br>
Further   the   invention   provides   replacement   of   the   existing   actuating<br>
mechanisms like fluid, disc and drum brakes by electromagnetic actuating<br>
mechanism.<br>
Another objective of the present invention, circular plates are used in operative<br>
coupling with the wheel.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention, the circular plates used have<br>
holes selectively arranged for the operation of braking system.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention includes use of T-shaped pegs,<br>
having coils, in the holes.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention, bearings are used to house the<br>
hollow cylinder and plate on wheel shaft.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention, the holes are equally distributed<br>
and congruent holes allow passage of T shaped pegs through them.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the length of the T shaped<br>
pegs are such to allow passage of the pegs through the holes in the second and<br>
third plate.<br><br>
Yet another objective of the present invention, brakes in the vehicle are selected from the group consisting of disc brake or drum brake. Yet another objective of the present invention, the magnetization depends upon the amount of pressure applied on brake pedal.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention, the pegs are made of a magnetic material and the peg heads are made of tungsten carbide.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention, the distance between the first and second plate is in the range of 2 to 4mm.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention, the length of the pegs is in the range of 25 to 35mm.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention, the thickness of the plate is in the range of 2 to 5mm and is made of a lightweight non-magnetic material. Statement of Invention:-<br>
The most reliable braking system available today are the disc braking system. As stated in background of the invention the limitations of these braking systems are the linkages consisting of levers rods and wires which may fail in the course of time due to wear and also climatic conditions working conditions do influence the performance.<br>
The present invention therefore, relates to a new concept of the electro-magnetism which eliminates the linkage problem as mentioned earlier. Statement of invention:<br>

Application of electromagnetic braking system in drum brakes<br>
The actuating mechanism of drum brakes can be replaced by an electromagnetic actuating system instead of mechanical coupling as shown in Figures 1 and 2. As in normal Drum brakes, the brake (51), mounted on the chassis (52) is actuated by a lever (53) coming out of the drum brake (51) surface. To implement electromagnetic braking, two electromagnets (54) and (56) are mounted on a projection on the chassis as shown in Figures 1 and 2. The electromagnet (55) is mounted on the brake lever. The alignment of these electromagnets is clearly shown in Figure 2. The polarity of these electromagnets, are as shown in Figures 1 and 2. When the brakes are actuated (to be discussed later) electromagnet (56) expresses a repulsive force on the electromagnet (55) and electromagnet (54) expresses an attractive force on electromagnet (55). Since the electromagnet (55) is mounted on the brake lever (the lever can move in one direction), the electromagnet moves thereby applying the brakes<br>
Application of electromagnetic braking system in Disc Brakes The actuating mechanism of disc brakes can be replaced by electro magnetic actuating system instead of hydraulic acmating mechanism as shown in Figures 3 and 4. As in normal Disc brakes, the U shaped holdings (66) mounted on the wheels of an automobile (61) contain bushes/pad (62) which when actuated apply friction braking on the wheels to stop the same. The acmating mechanism consists of a chamber containing hydraulic fluid. When brakes are applied, hydraulic liquid is forced into the chamber. At the other end of the chamber are cylinders, which due to hydraulic force push the bushes/pads towards the wheel.<br>
The applicant here intends to replace the hydraulic system by electromagnetic system. Here inside the chamber instead of the hydraulic fluid, electromagnets<br><br>
(64) and (65) are housed. The polarities of the electromagnets are as shown in Figure 3. When the disc brakes are actuated (to be discussed later), electromagnet (65) expresses a repulsive force on the electromagnet (64), which can move. This in turn pushes cylinders (63), which are attached to the chamber by means of springs towards the wheel. The bush/pad (62), which are attached to the cylinders (3) are driven towards the wheels thereby braking the motion.<br>
The proposed setup for electromagnetic braking system is shown in detail, in figures 5 and 6.<br>
Electromagnetic braking system<br>
Figure 5 explains the working of the proposed set up for electromagnetic braking system. In this when the supply is passed to the plate (8) and coil (9) with the polarity as indicated in figure 5, the plate (8) and the pegs (5) are magnetized. The plate (8) and the peg (5) heads have the same polarity because of which a repulsive force is created between plate (8) and peg (5) heads. Since the T shaped pegs (5) are attached via springs (6) to plate (4), the magnetic repulsion drives the T shaped pegs (5) into the holes on the plate (4). the length of the pegs (5) are such that they go via plate (4) and into the holes on plate (3), thereby braking the motion of the wheels (l).But this has a disadvantage that the vehicle is moving in a high speed and the chances of skidding the vehicle is high and the wear and tare of the parts of the vehicles is also significant. In order to avoid these disadvantages a frictional braking is incorporated in the system. When a brake is applied first the frictional braking will come into effect and this will effectively reduce the speed of the vehicle and in order to stop the vehicle completely, the magnetic braking will come into action. This is explained in reference to figure 6.<br><br>
Actuating Mechanism for Electromagnetic braking: -<br>
The Actuating mechanism/setup for the electromagnetic braking is based on human reflexes. Due to reflex action the amount of pressure applied on the brake pedal is directly proportional to the intensity of the situation or emergency based on the proximity of the obstacle. If we need to slow down, we apply gentle pressure on the brake pedal whereas if an emergency arises, due to reflex action, we apply full pressure on the brake pedals. Hence, we intend to make use of the above to vary the amount of current flowing into the actuating mechanism thereby varying the amount of magnetization of the electromagnets. The proposed setup for the same is as shown in Figure 8. This consists of resistance (43) on the brake pedal (41). From this resistance, a permanent connection (44) from the battery (46) is provided. A moving contact (45) is resting on the chassis (42). The connections coming out marked + and - are connected to the brake actuating mechanism of either Disc or Drum brakes. Initially a small amount of pressure is required to bring this circuit to life. As the brake pedal is pressed further, the pedal (41) is driven into the chassis (42) thereby varying the amount of resistance induced into the circuit. This changes the amount of current to the electromagnets thereby varying the amount of brake applied. Thus shown and explained through Figure 8, the actuating mechanism for disc and drum brakes is designed keeping the fact that the locomotive may skid due to the application of brake at a high speed. This is designed such as to gradually increase the current flowing through the circuit thereby increase the magnetic flux gradually so as to apply the brake gently in the beginning (to slow the automobile) and then to hit hard so as to bring the automobile to a stand still. The timing for the same can be manipulated by suitably having varying resistance in the circuit.<br><br>
This mechanism ensures safe braking without skidding in the case of disc and drum brakes.<br>
The proposed system consists of Plate (3) with holes on the surface. This plate is attached to the wheel (1) and hence is rotating. On the Shaft is mounted another plate (4) which is stationary with respect to the wheel. On the plate (4) are holes, which are congruent to the holes on the plate (3). Into this holes are mounted pegs (5) as shown in Figure 6 via springs (6). Also, insulated copper wires (7) are wound on these pegs so as to magnetize them when current is passed. Also on the same plate (4), are another set of holes, which are not congruent to the holes on plate (3). On these holes also, pegs are mounted with springs and layers of copper wire are wound. In both the above cases, the pegs are driven so much into the holes that they are on the verge of coming out on the other side. Also is present another plate which is a circular plate (8) and a concentric disc (9') separated by a magnetic insulator (10) and mounted as a single plate. This plate again is stationary with respect to the wheels and this is provided as a stationary reference for the magnetic field produced. On the circular plate (8) as well as the outer disc (9') are cylindrical projections on which insulated copper wires (11) are wound so as to magnetize the inner plate (8) or the outer disc (9') separately. When the plate (8) or outer disc (9') is energized, the relevant set of pegs (which are perpendicular to the surface of the plate) on plate (4) are driven into the holes in plate (4) and hit the surface of plate (3) or into the holes on plate (3) depending on whether plate (8) or (9') was energized. Thus, the present setup causes the pegs to move perpendicular to the plane of the plate thereby generating desired results. The actuating mechanism for this brake (Figure 9) consists of two circuits. This consists of two resistance (73) and (74) on the brake pedal. Permanent connections (75) and (76) are taken out from these as shown in Figure 8. A<br><br>
moving contact (77) is placed on the chassis, which is connected to the automobile batteries.<br>
For smaller pressures on the brake pedal, the first circuit becomes active. With this the cylinders on plate (10) and the pegs (5) get magnetized. Due to repulsive force, the corresponding pegs are driven into the holes in plate (4). Since, these pegs hit flat surface on the plate (3), due to friction, braking action takes place. After traversing the full length of resistance in the first circuit, the pegs would have generated friction to slow down the automobile. If the pedals are further pressed the second circuit is activated wherein the cylinders on plate (9) are magnetized. This will in trun drive the pegs (5) on the plate (4) into the holes in plate (3) thereby bringing the automobile to stop immediately. As clearly shown and explained through Figure 8, the actuating mechanism for the braking the proposed setup is such that the pegs on the inner side of plate (4) are energized before the outer ones are energized. The pegs on the inner side of plate (4) do not have corresponding holes on plate (3). This causes the pegs to rub the inner surface of plate (3) instead of hitting holes on the same. The resultant friction causes the automobile to slow down. The above situation arises when the brake lever is initially pressed so as to introduce circuit 1 which energizes the pegs on the inner side of plate (4). The pressure exerted by the pegs on the inner side of plate (3) increases as the brake lever is further depressed as the resistance introduced into the circuit is cutout. After the lever is depressed by a certain amount, the circuit 1 is disengaged and circuit 2 is engaged. This is the circuit to energize outside pegs on plate (4) that end up in the holes in plate (3), which causes the automobile to stop instantaneously. The above setup can be manipulated by varying the lengths and values of resistance on circuits 1 and 2. To avoid skidding, the resistance for circuit 2 could be say 1/5* of size of the brake lever.<br><br>
Application of Electromagnetic braking system in Heavy traffic vehicles.<br>
Figure 12 shows the front view setup of the drum brake which can be used either with the heavy vehicle or with the ordinary vehicle. In the setup shown in Figure 1, the braking is actuated from outside the drum brakes making this setup inefficient for use in vehicles with heavy load/capacity. (The setup in Figure 1 was proposed as an electromagnetic replacement for the existing actuating setup). Hence, for use of a drum brake in Heavy Traffic Vehicles, a semp as proposed in Figure 12 can be adopted. Here, the whole actuating mechanism is built inside the drum brake casing.<br>
Figure 11 shows the cross sectional view of a electromagnetic drum brake which comprises of two brake shoes (24), attached to the case (25) by means of rivets (26) and held together. Two electromagnets (22 and 23) are attached to the free ends of the brake shoe and these electromagnets are wound by copper coils (21) in a manner so as to produce a repulsion force between the two electromagnets (22 and 23).<br>
When the brakes are applied, the electromagnets (22 and 23) are magnetized and a repulsion force is produced between the two electromagnets thereby driving the free ends of the brake shoe in the opposite direction so that the brakes are applied. When the brake lever is released, the spring (27) takes care of bringing the two brake shoes together.<br>
Figure 12 shows another embodiment of the invention which can be used in heavy vehicles. The figure shows a cross sectional view of the electro magnetic system.<br>
The braking system described in earlier embodiments is not applicable for heavy traffic vehicles as the force exerted by the pegs to generate frictional braking might note be enough to slow down the vehicle effectively. Hence a further embodiment of the invention is incorporated as in Figure 12.<br><br>
Figure 12 shows an optional setup for heavy vehicles for effective braking. This is a modification of the setup proposed in fig 6. Here the plate 3, which was attached to the wheels in fig 6 is now attached to the shaft. The plate and pegs are arranged similar to the fig 6 The plate and peg set up is provided on both sides of the wheel.. The same mechanism used in fig 6 is applied except the fact that it is applied from both the sides of the wheel for effective braking for heavy vehicles.<br>
The material used for making the pegs and the plate are described in tabular form below.<br><br>
Space alloys are very tough to wear and tear and has less weight. Advanced methods like Ultrasonic welding, etc could be used to attach the spring to the plate and the peg thereby introducing required strength to the joints to withstand the wear and tear.<br><br><br>
Applications: -<br>
1.	Emergency braking in motor vehicles to stop the vehicle in the shortest<br>
possible distance.<br>
2.	Since the braking system is electrically actuated, the brakes can be<br>
individually applied to the desired wheels of a motor vehicle to perform<br>
stunts like wheel spinning, etc.<br>
3.	This braking system can be an alternative to the present air brake system in<br>
a railway locomotive. Since the brake is electrically actuated, the actuating<br>
signal can be easily transmitted to all bogies so that brakes can be<br>
simultaneously applied which facilitates halting the railway locomotive in the<br>
shortest possible distance.<br>
The Electromagnetic Force of attraction or repulsion is used to brake the motion of a automobile. The proposed braking system can be implemented in two ways. Firstly, the actuating setup of any braking system (drum brakes, disc brakes, etc.) can be replaced by this electromagnetic braking setup. Secondly, a new system is proposed which provides an effective braking system. Advantages; -<br>
1.	The proposed system incorporates the advantages of disc brakes while<br>
eliminating the disadvantages in the disc brakes.<br>
2.	The transmission of the actuator signal from the driver end to the brake<br>
end is fail proof<br><br>
3. The overall system is highly efficient as compared to the presently existing braking systems.<br>
Further it should be understood that the foregoing description is only illustrative of the present invention. Various alternatives and modifications can be devised by those skilled in the art without departing from the invention. Accordingly, the present invention is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications and variance which fall within the scope of the appended claims.<br><br><br>
