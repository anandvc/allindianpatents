				<td>Treatment of drug and multidrug resistance<br>
typically involves the coadministration of a drug<br>
suitable for treatment of the disease and a compound<br>
which acts through various mechanisms to cause the drug<br>
suitable for treatment of a disease to begin and/or<br>
continue to function as a therapeutic agent.<br>
U.S. patent 5,654,304 ('304), incorporated by<br>
reference herein, discloses a series of 10,11-(optionally<br>
substituted)methanodibenzosuberane derivatives useful in<br>
enhancing the efficacy of existing cancer<br>
chemotherapeutics and for treating nultidrug resistance.<br>
(2R)-anti-5-{3-[4-(10,11-Difluoramethanodibenzosuber-5-<br>
yl)piperazin-1-yl]-2-hydroxypropoxy} quinoline<br>
trihydrochloride is disclosed in '304 and is currently<br>
under development as a pharmaceutical agent.<br>
A crystalline form of this compound, which can<br>
be conveniently formulated for administration to<br>
patients, is highly desirable. Thus, there is a need to<br>
prepare (2R)-anti-5-{3-[4-(10,11-<br>
dif luoromethanodibenzosuber-5-yl) piperazin-1-yl]-2-<br>
hydroxypropoxy}quinoline trihydrochloride as a pure,<br>
highly crystalline solid in order to fulfill exacting<br>
pharmaceutical requirements and specifications.<br>
Preferably, such a crystalline compound will be<br>
readily formed and have favorable bulk or pharmaceutical<br>
characteristics. Examples of favorable bulk<br>
characteristic are drying times, filterability,<br>
solubility, intrinsic dissolution, thermal stability, and<br>
hygroscopicity. Examples of favorable pharmaceutical<br>
characteristics are purity and potency. Decreased<br>
organic solvents in the crystalline structure is<br>
favorable, due in part to potential solvent toxicity to<br>
the recipient as a function of the solvent. Furthermore,<br>
the process for preparing crystalline compounds also<br>
needs to be conveniently carried out on commercial scale.<br>
Although the 10,11-methanedibenzosuberanes<br>
prepared by the procedures taught in '304 could be used<br>
as a pharmaceutical, "one cannot predict which compounds<br>
will be polymorphic" (Florence and Attwood,<br>
Physicochemical Principles of Pharmacy, 2nd Ed., Chapman<br>
and Hall, New York, N.Y., 1988, pages 23-24), it would be<br>
highly desired and advantageous to find a more<br>
crystalline form of (2R)-anti-5-{3-[4-(10,11-<br>
difluoromethanodibenzosuber-5-yl)piperazin-1-yl]-2-<br>
hydroxypropoxy}quinoline trihydrochloride having the<br>
advantageous properties described above. The preparation<br>
of the new crystalline form of the present invention<br>
fulfills these desirable features.<br>
Additionally, there is need for an improved<br>
process for the preparation 10,11-(optionally<br>
substituted)methariodibenzosuberan6 derivatives which is<br>
more efficient and adaptable to large scale processing<br>
than those previously employed, for example in '304.<br>
Advantages of an improved process may include, for<br>
example, improved stereoselectivity, purity, and yield.<br>
The present invention provides a process for<br>
preparing a compound of formula (1)<br><br>
wherein A is -CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CHRa-CH2-, -CH2-CHRa-CH2-CH2-,<br>
and Ra is OH;<br>
R1 is H, P, Cl, or Br;<br>
R2 is H, F, Cl, or Br; and<br>
R3 is heteroaryl or phenyl, each optionally substituted<br>
with F, Cl, Br, CF3, CN, NO2, or OCHF2;<br>
or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof,<br>
comprising the steps of:<br>
(a) reacting a compound of formula (4)<br><br>
with a nucleophile source to form a compound of formula<br>
(5)<br><br>
wherein X is a leaving group;<br>
(b) reacting a compound of formula (5) with<br>
pyrazine to provide a compound of formula (6) <br><br>
(c) reducing the compound of formula (6) to<br>
provide a compound of formula (8):<br><br>
(d) reacting a compound of formula (8) with<br>
either:<br>
(i) an epoxy compound of formula (9)<br><br>
wherein R3 is as defined above, and n<br>
is an integer 1 or 2; or<br>
(ii) a halo compound of formula (10)<br>
wherein R3 is as defined above, X1 is<br>
halo, and m is 2, 3 or 4; and<br>
(e) optionally forming a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt from the compound produced in step (d) .<br>
The present invention also provides an improved<br>
process for preparing a compound of formula (4) :<br><br>
comprising reacting dibanzosuberenone with an alkali<br>
trihaloacetate to produce an intermediate 10,11-<br>
(optionally substituted)methanodibenzosuberone and<br>
reducing said intermediate, wherein both reactions are<br>
performed in one operational step.<br>
The ability to perform both reactions in one<br>
operational step is an advantage over the prior art. U.S.<br>
patent 5,654,304 teaches a step-wise preparation of the<br>
10,11- (optionally substituted) methanodibenzosuberol,<br>
beginning with preparation and isolation of 10,11-<br>
(optionally substituted)methanodibenzosuberone from<br>
dibenzosuberenone (2) in diglyme and sodium<br>
trihaloacetate (e.g., sodium chlorodifluoroacetate) in<br>
diglyme at a temperature of 160°C to 165°C followed by<br>
reduction of the intermediate 10,11-(optionally<br>
substituted) methanodibenzosuberone (3) to afford the<br>
corresponding 10,11-(optionally substituted)methano<br>
dibenzosuberol.<br>
Additionally, the present invention<br>
contemplates a compound of formula (6)<br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 are independently H, F, Cl or Br and X<br>
is leaving group selected from the group consisting of<br>
Br, Cl, OMs, and OTs.<br>
Moreover, the present invention provides a<br>
novel hydrate crystal form of (2R)-anti-5-{3-[4-(10,11-<br>
difluoromethanodibenzosuber-5-yl)piperazin-1-yl]-2-<br>
hydroxypropoxy}quinoline trihydrochloride ("Hydrate I"),<br>
having an X-ray diffraction pattern which comprises the<br>
following peaks corresponding to d spacings: 7.95 +/-<br>
0.04 A when obtained at 22 ±2°C and 31 ±10% relative<br>
humidity from a copper radiation source.<br>
The present invention also provides the novel<br>
hydrate a characterized above, having an X-ray<br>
diffraction pattern further comprising the following<br>
peaks: 9.93, 4.45, and 3.36 +/- 0.04 A when obtained at<br>
22 ±2°C and 31 ±10% relative humidity fron a copper<br>
radiation source.<br>
The present invention further provides a method<br>
of treatment for a drug resistant disease comprising<br>
coadministaring to a mammal in need thereof a resistance<br>
modulating amount of Hydrate I and an effective amount of<br>
a treatment drug for said drug resistant disease.<br>
The present invention further provides a method<br>
of treatment for a multidrug resistant disease comprising<br>
coadminlstering to a manmal in need thereof a multidrug<br>
resistance modulating amount of Hydrate I and an<br>
effective amount of a treatment drug for said multidrug<br>
resistant disease.<br>
The present invention further provides a method<br>
for enhancing bioavailability of a drug to the brain,<br>
comprising coadministering to a mammal in need thereof a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of said drug and Hydrate<br>
I sufficient enough to allow said drug to cross the<br>
blood-brain barrier and enter the brain.<br>
The present invention further provides a method<br>
for enhancing oral bioavai lability of a drug comprising<br>
administering to a mammal in need thereof a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of said drug and Hydrate<br>
I sufficient enough to allow said drug to be transported<br>
across the gastrointestinal tract and enter the<br>
bloodstream.<br>
The present invention further provides a<br>
solvate of (2R)-anti-5-{3-[4-(10,11-<br>
difluoromethanodibenzosuber-5-yl)piperazin-1-yl]-2-<br>
hydroxypropoxy}quinoline trihydrochloride.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Definitions and General Parameters<br>
The following definitions are set forth to<br>
illustrate and define the meaning and scope of the<br>
various terms used to describe the invention herein.<br>
In general, the term "pharmaceutical" when used<br>
as an adjective means substantially non-toxic to living<br>
organisms. Por example, the term "pharmaceutical salt"<br>
as used herein, refers to salts of the compounds of<br>
formula I which are substantially non-toxic to living<br>
organisms. See, e.g.. Berge, S.M, Bighley, L.D., and<br>
Monkhouse, D.C., "Pharmaceutical Salts", J. Pharm. Sci.,<br>
66:1, 1977. Typical pharmaceutical salts include those<br>
salts prepared by reaction of the compounds of formula I<br>
with an inorganic or organic acid or base. Such salts<br>
are known as acid addition or base addition salts<br>
respectively. These pharmaceutical salts frequently have<br>
enhanced solubility characteristics compared to the<br>
compound from which they are derived, and thus are often<br>
more amenable to formulation as liquids or emulsions.<br>
The term "cancer therapeutic agent" refers to<br>
compounds, which have an anticancer therapeutic effect.<br>
Such compounds are non-antimetabolites such as<br>
anthracycline group antibiotics, e.g. adriamycin,<br>
daunomycin, doxorubicin, or acrasinomycin A; actinomycin<br>
group antibiotics, e.g. actimomycin C or D; chromomycin<br>
group antibiotics, e.g. mithramycin or toyomycin;<br>
vincoalkaloids, e.g. vincristine, or vinblastine;<br>
meitansins; podophyllotoxin derivatives, e.g. VP16-213;<br>
homoharintonin; angwindin; bruceantin; neocarcinostatin;<br>
anthromycin; mitomycin C; and cisplatin. Additional<br>
cancer therapeutic agents may be found in the medical<br>
literature, for example, Section XIII, "Chemotherapy of<br>
Neoplastic Diseases" in Goodman and Oilman's The<br>
Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, Seventh Edition,<br>
pages 1240-1306 (1985).<br>
The term "bioavailability" refers to the<br>
degree and rate at which a drug, or other substance,<br>
becomes available to a target tissue within a mammal.<br>
The term "coadministoring" means a disease<br>
treatment drug and Hydrate I are given to a mammal.<br>
The drug and Hydrate I are given to a mammal<br>
simultaneously or at different times.<br>
The term "drug resistance" refers to the<br>
circumstance when a disease does not respond to a<br>
treatment drug or drugs. Drug resistance can be either<br>
intrinsic, which means the disease has never been<br>
responsive to the drug or drugs, or it can be acquired,<br>
which means the disease ceases responding to a drug or<br>
drugs that the disease had previously responded to.<br>
"Multidrug resistance" means a specific type<br>
of drug resistance characterized by cross-resistance of<br>
a disease to more than one functionally and/or<br>
structurally unrelated drugs. Multidrug resistance can<br>
be either intrinsic or acquired.<br>
The term "acid addition salt" refers to a salt<br>
of a compound of formula I prepared by reaction of a<br>
compound of formula I with a mineral or organic acid.<br>
For exemplification of pharmaceutical acid addition salts<br>
see, e.g., Berge, S.M, Bighley, L.D., and Monkhouse,<br>
D.C., J. Pharm. Sci., 66:1, 1977. Since compounds of<br>

p-bromophenylsulfonic acid, carbonic acid, suecinic acid,<br>
citric acid, benzoic acid, acetic acid, mono-, di- and<br>
tricarboxylic acids and the like. Examples of such<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts are the sulfate,<br>
pyrosulfate, bisulfate, sulfite, bisulfite, phosphate,<br>
monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate,<br>
pyrophosphate, chloride, bromide, iodide, acetate,<br>
propionate, decanoate, caprylate, acrylate, formate,<br>
isobutyrate, caproate, heptanoate, propiolate, oxalate,<br>
malonate, succinate, suberate, sebacate, fumarate, maleate,<br>
butyne-1,4-dioate, hexyne-1,6-dioate, benzoate,<br>

preparing a compound of formula (1).<br><br>
wherein A is -CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CHRa-CH2-, -CH2-CHRa--CH2-CH2-,<br>
and Ra is OH;<br>
R1 is H, F, Cl, or Br;<br>
R2 is H, F, Cl, or Br; and<br>
R3 is heteroaryl or phenyl, each optionally substituted<br>
with F, Cl, Br, CF3, CN, NO2, or OCHF2;<br>
or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof,<br>
comprising the steps of:<br>
(a) reacting a compound of formula (4)<br><br>
with a nucleophile source to form a compound of formula<br>
(5)<br><br>
wherein X is a leaving group;<br>
(b) reacting a compound of formula (5) with<br>
pyrazine to provide a compound of formula (6)<br><br>
(c) reducing the compound of formula (6) to<br>
provide a compound of formula (8) :<br><br>
(d) reacting a compound of formula (8) with<br>
either:<br>
(i) an epoxy compound of formula (9)<br><br>
wherein R3 is as defined above, and n<br>
is an integer 1 or 2; or<br>
(ii) a halo compound of formula (10)<br><br>
wherein R3 is as defined above, X1 is<br>
halo, and in is 2, 3 or 4; and<br>
(e) optionally forming a pharmaceutically<br>

In a preferred aspect the present invention is<br>
a procedure as shown in scheme 1, to afford 10,11-<br>
(optionally substituted) methanodibenzosuberol in a<br>
single operational step from dibenzosuberenone.<br><br>
This embodiment of the present invention<br>
provides the advantage of efficiency, ease of processing,<br>
reduced cost of manufacture and a more environment-<br>
friendly process over the teaching of U.S. patent<br>
5,654,304. These advantages are made possible by the use<br>
of, and increased solubility of lithium trihaloacetate<br>
salt. The higher reaction concentration incident to<br>
increased solubility of the lithium salt and reduction in<br>
solvent volumes compared to prior art provide increased<br>
throughput and reaction rate. These advantages are also<br>
made possible by the higher reaction temperature made<br>
possible by the use of triglyme, which also enhances the<br>
rate of reaction. Por specific reaction conditions see<br>
steps (a) and (b) of scheme 4.<br>
Preferably 1-(aryloxy or heteroarylaxy)-2,3-<br>
epoxypropane, 1-(aryloxy or heteroaryloxy)-3,4-<br>
epoxybutane, or aryloxy- or heteroaryloxyalkyl halide,<br>
and a 1-[10,11-(optionally substituted)methano-<br>
dibenzosuber-5-yi] piperazine are combined to give the<br>
corresponding 10,11-methanodibenzosurberane derivative of<br>
Formula (1).<br>
A further embodiment of this invention provides<br>
a process for preparing the anti isomer of the novel<br>
10,11-(optionally substituted)methanodibenzosuberyl<br>
pyrazinium salt compound of formula (6) . This embodiment<br>
of the invention is illustrated in scheme 2 below:<br><br>
In this embodiment the 10,11-(optionally<br>
substituted)methanodibenzosuberol compound of formula (4)<br>
is reacted with a nucleophile source such as a strong<br>
acid, for example hydrogen bromide, hydrogen chloride or<br>
methanesulfonic acid. The incipient hydronium ion is<br>
displaced in-situ with the nudeophilic conjugate base of<br>
the acid such as the bromide ion or chloride ion or<br>
methanesulfonate ion to form the compound of formula (5)<br>
where X is bromide, chloride, or methanesulfonate. The<br>
sulfonate ester analogs of (5) may be preferably accessed<br>
by the use of the corresponding sulfonic acid anhydride<br>
or sulfonic acid halide. The compound of formula (5) is<br>
reacted with pyrazine to form the compound of formula<br>
(6). The compound of formula (6) is novel and is a<br>
further embodiment of this invention.<br>
Dibenzo[5.1.0]bicyclooctadiene derivatives, as<br>
well as derivatives of related ring systems have been<br>
found to form stable carbocations. It has been reported<br>
that treatment of 2,3,5,6-dibenzo-4-<br>
hydroxy[5.1.0]bicycloocta-2,5-diene with fluorosulfuric<br>
acid at -78 °c or sulfuric acid at room temperature<br>
provided solutions of the corresponding<br>
dibenzohomotropylium ion, which was characterized by NMR<br>
(see Childs, R.F.; Brown, M.A.; Anet, F.A.L.; Winstein,<br>
S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1972, 94, 2175. See also: Berti,<br>
G. J. Org. Chem. 1957, 22, 230. Looker, J.J. J. Org.<br>
Chem. 1968, 33, 1304.) Typically, nucleophilic reactions<br>
at the benzylic position in these systems will proceed<br>
primarily by a SN1-type mechanism, giving rise to mixtures<br>
of syn and anti products via a carbocation intermediate.<br>
The present invention, however, provides the anti bromide<br>
analog of (5) which is obtained as the exclusive product<br>
in good yield from syn alcohol precursor (4). The<br>
corresponding anti alcohol also gave rise to the anti<br>
bromide analog of (5) exclusively under the same<br>
bromination conditions. General teachings on<br>
halogenation or sulfonation of alcohols are given in<br>
reference texts such as March, J., Advanced Organic<br>
Chemistry, 3rd edition, 1985, John Wiley and Sons, New<br>
York, New York, and Larock R. C, Comprehensive Organic<br>
Transformations, 1989 VCH Publishers, Mew York, New York.<br>
The 10,11-(optionally substituted)<br>
dibenzosuberylhalide or sulfonate (5) obtained as<br>
described above is then reacted with pyrazine in a<br>
suitable solvent, such as dichloromethane, to form the<br>
pyrazinium salt compound of formula (6). Nucleophilic<br>
reactions of nitrogen-containing aromatic heterocycles,<br>
particularly pyrazine, with bromide analog of (5), result<br>
in exclusive formation of anti quaternary salts, for<br>
example the pyrazinium salt compound of formula (6).<br>
A further embodiment of this invention is<br>
represented by scheme 3 below; -<br><br>
This embodiment of the invention, utilizes the<br>
10, 11- (optionally substituted) methanodibenzosuberyl<br>
pyrazinium salt compound of formula (6) obtained from the<br>
processes of the invention as described above. In this<br>
embodiment the 10, 11-(optionally<br>
substituted)methanodibenzosuberyl pyrazinium salt<br>
compound of formula (6), is reduced using conditions<br>
capable of reducing the pyrazine ring to afford the<br>
piperazine compound of formula (8). Reduction of the<br>
pyrazinium salt compound of formula (6) can be<br>
accomplished by hydrogenation or metal hydride<br>
reductions, for example lithium tetrahydroaluminum<br>
hydrides, sodium borohydride and other similar reducing<br>
agents known to one skilled in the art. Preferred<br>
reducing agents for the purpose of this invention include<br>
lithium borohydride and sodium borohydride. The<br>
reduction using lithium or sodium borohydride is<br>
typically aided by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
The reduction product is typically isolated as the acid<br>
salt by treatment of the product solution with<br>
concentrated aqueous or anhydrous acid, for example<br>
concentrated hydrochloric acid. Reductions of pyrazinium<br>
salts and pyridinium salts have been reported in the<br>
literature. See for example, Dykstra, S.J.; Minielli,<br>
J.L.; Lawson, J.E. J. Med. Chen. 1973, 16, 1015. Bugle,<br>
R.C.; Osteryoung, R.A. J. Oro. Chen. 1979, 44, 1719.<br>

The 10,11-(optionally substituted)methano<br>
dibenzoBuberylpiperazine acid salt (7) is neutralized to<br>
afford the free base compound of formula (8) employing an<br>
inorganic base such as sodium hydroxide, sodium<br>
carbonate, bicarbonate, potassium carbonate and the like.<br>
Most preferred is the use of powdered potassium carbonate<br>
in protic solvents such as ethanol. One skilled in the<br>
art is aware that aqueous inorganic bases may also be<br>
employed. Furthermore, one skilled in the art can<br>
appreciate that mild organic bases, such as<br>
triethylamina, may also be employed to effect this<br>
neutralization.<br>
The compound of formula (8) is reacted with<br>
either the compound of formula (9) or the compound of<br>
formula (10) to afford the compound of formula (1).<br>
Preparation of compounds of formula (8) and (9) are<br>
described in U.S. patents Nos. 5,643,909 and 5,654,304,<br>
incorporated herein by reference. The use of the<br>
compounds of formula (8) wherein R3 is the quinolinyl<br>
group is preferred. Most preferred is the use of<br>
compounds of formula (8) wherein the group R3 is the<br>
- quinolin-5-yl group. Improved procedures for preparing<br>
the preferred embodiment of compound (8) wherein R3 is the<br>
quinolin-5-yl group are disclosed infra in this<br>
application. The compound of formula (1) may be<br>
optionally reacted with a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
acid to form the acid salt. Preferred acids include<br>
hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, sulfuric acid,<br>
camphorsulphonic acid and the like.<br>
A general preparative route to the compounds of<br>
formula (1), according to the present invention, is given<br>
in Scheme 4 below:<br>
Various embodiments of this invention are<br>
incorporated in Scheme 4. Por example, in scheme 4,<br>
steps (a) and (b) encompass one embodiment, steps (a)<br>
through (d) encompass a further embodiment and steps (a)<br>
through (g) encompass a further embodiment of this<br>
invention wherein all embodiments have been described<br>
supra. The starting material for the purpose of this<br>
invention is 5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5-one.<br>
(dibenzosuberenone), which is commercially available,<br>
e.g., from Aldrich Chemical Company, Milwaukee, His.<br>
Other reactants are likewise commercially available or<br>
may be readily prepared by one of skill in the art.<br>
Step (a)c A solution of an alkali<br>
trihaloacetate is added over a period of about 4 to about<br>
8 hours, preferably about 6 hours, to a solution of<br>
dibenzosuberenone with stirring and under nitrogen while<br>
maintaining the reaction temperature preferable from<br>
about 160 to about 165 oC. The reaction mixture is<br>
brought to room temperature, then poured into water and<br>
extracted, preferably with ether. The desired 10,11-<br>
(optionally substituted) methanodibenzosuberone is<br>
isolated and purified by conventional means. Por<br>
example, -the organic phase is washed with water, dried,<br>
preferably over Na2SO4, evaporated, and the residue is<br>
recrystallized.<br>
Examples of alkali trihaloacetates for use in<br>
step (a) are sodium chlorodifluoroacetate, methyl<br>
trichloroacetate, ethyl trifluoroacetade. The preferred<br>
alkali trihaloacetate is dependent upon the desired<br>
substituents for R1 and R3.<br>
Preferred solvents are diglyme, benzene, and<br>
petroleum ether.<br>
The skilled artisan would appreciate that other<br>
reaction temperatures may be employed depending upon the<br>
reactants used. For example, see Coyne and Cusic,<br>
"Aminoalkyldibenzo(a,elcyclopropa[c] cycloheptane<br>
Derivatives. A Series of Potent Antidepressants," J.<br>
Med. Chem.. 1974, Vol. 17, No. 1, 72-75.<br>
Alternatively, 10,11-methanodibenxosuberone<br>
compounds where R1 and R2 are not identical, such as when<br>
R1 H and R2 Cl, can be prepared as described by Coyne et<br>
al., supra. The compound of formula (2) where R1 and R2<br>
are both hydrogen can be prepared as described in Coyne<br>
and Cusic, et al., supra.<br>
Step (b): A solution of the 10,11-(optionally<br>
substituted)methanodibenzosuberone, from step (a), in a<br>
solvent, preferably tetrahydrofuran in methanol, is<br>
cooled and a reducing agent, preferably lithium<br>
borohydride or sodium borohydride, sufficient to effect<br>
reduction is added in portions. The reaction mixture is<br>
allowed to come to room temperature and stirred for about<br>
1 to about 5 hours, preferably about 2 hours, then poured<br>
into water. The product is isolated and purified by<br>
conventional means to give the corresponding 10,11-<br>
(optionally substituted)methanodibenzosuberol of formula<br>
3.<br>
The skilled artisan would appreciate that other<br>
hydride reducing agents, including chiral and achiral<br>
reducing agents and controlled hydrogenations should<br>
effect this reduction.<br>
Combined Steps (a) and (b) Procedure: To a<br>
solution of 5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5-one<br>
(dibenzosuberenone) in triethylene glycol dimethyl ether<br>
heated from about 180°C to about 210°G is slowly added<br>
chlorodifluoroacetic acid, lithium salt in ethylene<br>
glycol dimethyl ether. The ethylene glycol dimethyl<br>
ether is distilled from the reaction as the salt addition<br>
proceeds. After the dibenzosuberenone has been consumed<br>
as determined by analytical methods known to one skilled<br>
in the art, the reaction is cooled to about ambient<br>
temperature and then combined with a mixture of ethyl<br>
acetate and diatomaceous earth. The solids are removed<br>
by filtration and washed with ethyl acetate. The washes<br>
and filtrate are combined and the ethyl acetate removed<br>
by concentration under vacuum. The concentrate is cooled<br>
to about 15 to about 30°C, followed by addition of sodium<br>
borohydride or lithium borohydride solution. After<br>
stirring for about 2 h the reaction is quenched by<br>
careful addition of a solution of cone. HCl in methanol-<br>
water (approximately 5-20%). The suspension is stirred<br>
for about 30 min and the crude product is collected by<br>
filtration. The filter cake is washed with 1:1 methanol-<br>
water and dried to a dark brown solid. The crude product<br>
is then slurried in methylene chloride, filtered and<br>
dried to afford syn-10,11-(optionally substituted)<br>
methanodibenzosuberol.<br>
Step (c): A solution of the 10,11-(optionally<br>
substituted) methanodibenzosuberol, from step (b), in a<br>
solvent, preferably heptane, is cooled followed by<br>
addition of a source of a leaving group, such as a<br>
hydrogen halide, methanesulfonic acid chloride, or the<br>
like. Bromination, for example, is effected by the<br>
addition of hydrogen bromide while maintaining a<br>
temperature from about 30 °C to about 100 °C, for about 2<br>
to about 5 hours, preferably about 4 hours. The reaction<br>
mixture is then evaporated to dryness, affording the<br>
corresponding 5-bromo-10,11-(optionally substituted)<br>
methanodibenzosuberane.<br>
The use of hydrogen bromide is preferred over<br>
other halogenatlng agents such as hydrogen chloride or<br>
thionyl chloride to afford the anti-stereoisomer<br>
preferentially. The 5-halo-lO,11-<br>
difluoromethanodibenzosuberane may without further<br>
purification, be reacted with pyrazine. Alternatively<br>
the anti-isomer of the corresponding 5-halo-10,11-<br>
(optionally substituted) methanodibenzosuberane may be<br>
purified and isolated before being subjected to treatment<br>
with pyrazine. The use of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid<br>
chloride or p-toluene sulfonic acid chloride or<br>
corresponding anhydride affords the corresponding<br>
compound of formula (5) where X is trifluoromethyl or p-<br>
toluene-sulfonate ester.<br>
Step (d): The reaction of the anti 5-halo-<br>
10,11-(optionally substituted)methanodibenzosuberane<br>
compound of formula (5) or its sulfonate analog-, with<br>
pyrazine is with or without solvent. Preferred solvents<br>
include dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethyl sulfoxide/methylene<br>
chloride, methylene chloride, ethyl acetate, and<br>
tetrahydrofuran. The reaction mixture is evaporated to<br>
dryneas and the desired anti-1-[10,11-(optionally<br>
8ub8tituted)methanodibenzosuber-5-yl]-pyrazinium salt<br>
compound of formula (6) may be isolated and purified.<br>
Combined Steps (c) and (d) : The steps of<br>
forming the 5-halo-10,11-(optionally substituted)<br>
methanodibenzosuberane or its sulfonate analogs of<br>
formula (5) and subsequently forming the 1-110,11-<br>
(optionally substituted) methanodibenzo8uber-5-<br>
yl]pyrazinium salt (formula 6), can be combined into one<br>
operational step by distillative solvent exchange<br>
following formation of the 5-halo-10,11-(optionally<br>
substituted)methanodibenzosuberane or its sulfonate<br>
analogs, and followed by addition of pyrazine.<br>
Step (e) : Preferably the anti-1-[10,11-<br>
(optionally substituted) methanodibenzosuber-5-<br>
yl]pyrazinium salt of formula (6) is reduced to the desired<br>
piperazine compound of formula (8) with, for example, a<br>
hydride reducing agent. Preferably the reducing agent is<br>
sodium borohydride or lithium borohydride. However, the<br>
skilled artisan will appreciate that other reducing agents<br>
are capable of effecting the desired reduction.<br>
The reaction mixture may be treated with, for<br>
example, hydrogen chloride or hydrogen bromide to form the<br>
corresponding salt compound of formula (7) for ease of<br>
isolation as the crystalline salt. It should be noted that<br>
one skilled in the art may perform a controlled<br>
hydrogenation or utilize other reducing agents such as<br>
chiral reducing agents, biocatalytic reductions or other<br>
methods known in the art to effect reduction of the<br>
pyrazinium salt to the piperazine compound of formula (8) .<br>
Step (f): A solution of the anti-1-[10,11-<br>
(optionally substituted)methanodibenzosuber-5-<br>
yl]piperazine acid salt of compound (7) and potassium<br>
hydroxide in a solvent (e.g., aqueous ethanol, or aqueous<br>
propanol, or isopropanol) is refluxed for about 0.5 to<br>
about 2 hours, preferably about 1 hour, then cooled. The<br>
cooled reaction mixture is concentrated, diluted with<br>
water, extracted, dried (preferably over K2CO3), and the<br>
organic phase is evaporated to give the corresponding<br>
anti-1-[10,11-(optionally substituted)methanodibenzo-<br>
suber-5-yl]piperazine compound of formula (8).<br>
Combined Steps (£) and (g) : The desired<br>
compound of formula (1) can be prepared by performing the<br>
processes of steps (f) and (g) of scheme (4) sequentially<br>
or in one operational step according to the methods of<br>
this invention. Alternatively the compound (7) product<br>
of this invention can be utilized to prepare compounds of<br>
formula (1) according to the examples and methods known<br>
in the art, (e.g. the methods described in U.S. patent<br>
5,654,304).<br>
For example, a suspension of anti-1-[10,11-<br>
(optionally 8ubstituted)methanodibenzosuber-5-<br>
yl)piperazine acid salt of compound of formula (7) and<br>
powdered sodium carbonate in N,N-dimethylformamide or<br>
aqueous sodium hydroxide or the like is stirred at<br>
ambient temperature for 1 to 3 hours, preferably 1 hour.<br>
(2R)-1-(5-quinolinyloxy)-2,3-epoxypropane compound of<br>
formula (9) is added and the reaction mixture is heated<br>
to about 40°C to about 100°C, preferably from about 65°C<br>
for about 10 to about 30 hours, preferably about 19<br>
hours. Temperature and time may vary depending on<br>
reagents utilized. RPLC analysis is utilized to indicate<br>
total consumption of the piperazinyl compound of formula<br>
(8). The mixture is allowed to cool to about room<br>
temperature, filtered through a plug of silica gel, and<br>
eluted with ethanol. The filtrate is concentrated and<br>
heated to about 65 °C with stirring. A solution of HCl in<br>
ethanol is added drop-wise over about 10 minutes and the<br>
resultant product solution is seeded, causing the<br>
trihydrochloride salt to precipitate. The mixture is<br>
cooled to ambient temperature and stirred for about 2<br>
hours. The precipitate is filtered, washed with ethanol,<br>
and dried in vacuo at about 50°C to give the crude<br>
trihydrochlorido salt which can be further purified by<br>
recrystallization from mathanol/ethyl acetate to provide<br>
in the case where R1 and R3 are each fluorine, the<br>
compound (2R) -anti-1-[4-(10,11-difluoromethano-10,11-<br>
dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5-yl) -piperazin-1-yl]-<br>
3-quinolin-5-yloxy) -propan-2-ol trihydrochloride.<br>
It should be understood that one of skill in the art may<br>
react the compound of formula (8) directly with the<br>
compound of formula (9) or formula (10) to obtain the<br>
compound of formula (1).<br>
A preferred embodiment of this invention is one<br>
where the R3 group is the "quinolin-5-yl" group, and is<br>
represented by the structure:<br><br>
with a point of attachment at the 5-position counting<br>
from the nitrogen atom and used synonymously with the<br>
term "5-quinolyl."<br>
Preferred are the processes according to the<br>
invention for preparing compounds of Formula (1) where R1<br>
and R3 are fluoro. Also preferred are the processes<br>
according to the invention for preparing compounds of<br>
formula (1) where A is 2-hydroxypropylene and R3 is<br>
quinolin-5-yl. Further preferred are those processes,<br>
which combine the above-mentioned features.<br>
Another preferred aspect of the invention<br>
provides a procedure that combines steps (c) and (d) of<br>
scheme 4 to afford 1-[10,11-(optionally substituted)<br>
methanodibenzo8uber-5-yl)-pyrazinium salt (formula (6))<br>
in a single operational step from the 1-{10,11-<br>
(optionally substituted)methanodibenzosuberol (4).<br>
Preferred is the process according to the<br>
invention for preparing the compound (2R)-5-{3-(4-(10,ll-<br>
difluoronethanodibenzosuber-5-yl)piperazin-1-yl]-2-<br>
hydroxypropoxy}quinoline.<br>
A most preferred embodiment of this invention<br>
comprises the preparation of (2R)-anti-5-{3-[4-(10,ll-<br>
difluoromethanodibenzosuber-5-yl)piperazin-1-yl]-2-<br>
hydroxypropoxy) quinoline acid salt (1b),<br><br>
where HX is an acid selected from the group comprising of<br>
hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, methane sulfonic<br>
acid, camphorsulfonic acid, p-toluene sulfonic acid, and<br>
sulfuric acid.<br>
Optional Preparation of Salts of Formula (1)<br>
The compounds of formula (1) can be converted<br>
to the corresponding acid addition salts. The conversion<br>
is accomplished by treatment with a stoichiometric amount<br>
of an appropriate acid, such as hydrochloric acid (e.g.,<br>
3 molar equivalents tp form the trihydrochloride salt) .<br>
Typically, the free base is dissolved in a polar organic<br>
solvent, such as methanol pr ethanol, and the acid is<br>
added in water, methanol or ethanol. The temperature is<br>
maintained at 0 °C to 50 °C. The corresponding salt<br>
precipitates spontaneously or can be brought out of<br>
solution with a less polar solvent.<br>
The acid addition salts of the compounds of<br>
formula (1) can be decomposed to the corresponding free<br>
base by treatment with an excess of a suitable base.<br>
Suitable bases include for example, ammonia and sodium<br>
bicarbonate, typically in the presence of an aqueous<br>
solvent, and at a temperature between O °C and 50 oC. The<br>
free base is isolated by conventional means, such as<br>
extraction with an organic solvent.<br>

To a solution of 103.1 g (0.500 mol) of<br>
dibenzosuberenone (2) in 515 mL of triethylene glycol<br>
dimethyl ether heated to 180 °C was added, over 7 hours,<br>
293.3 g (2.15 mol) of chlorodifluoroacetic acid lithium<br>
salt (as a 53 % by weight solution in ethylene glycol<br>
dimethylether). The ethylene glycol dimethylether was<br>
allowed to distill from the reaction as the salt addition<br>
proceeded. The GC analysis of an aliquot indicated that<br>
all of the dibenzosuberenone had been consumed. The<br>
reaction was cooled to ambient temperature and then<br>
combined with 400 mL of ethyl acetate and 75 g of<br>
diatomaceous earth. The solids were removed by<br>
filtration and washed with 300 mL of ethyl acetate. The<br>
washes and filtrate were combined and the ethyl acetate<br>
was removed by concentration under vacuum leaving 635 g<br>
of dark liquid. The dark liquid was cooled to 18 °C and<br>
to this was added, over 15 min, 6.62 g (0.175 mol) of<br>
sodium borohydride (as a 12% by wt solution in 14 M<br>
NaOH). After stirring for 2 h the reaction was quenched<br>
by careful addition of 900 mL of a 1:3.5:4.5 solution of<br>
cone. HCl-methanol-water. The suspension was stirred for<br>
30 min and the crude product was collected by filtration,<br>
washed with 600 mL of 1:1 methanol-water and dried to<br>
126.4 g of dark brown solid. The crude product was<br>
slurried with 600 mL of methylene chloride, washed twice<br>
with 150 mL portions of methylene chloride, and dried to<br>

Although the use of the syn 10,11-<br>
difluorodibenzomethanosuberol and the anti 5-bromo-10,11-<br>
dif luoromethanodibenzosuberane have been described and<br>
exemplified above, the skilled artisan will appreciate<br>
that formation of the anti-pyrazinium salt compound of<br>
formula (6) can be effectively accomplished with either<br>
the syn or the trans isomer of 5-halo-10,11-(optionally<br>
substituted)methanodibenzosuberane compound of formula<br>
(5) . This is possible by virtue of the intermediacy of a<br>
10,11-(optionally substituted)methanodibenzosuberane<br>
tropylium ion in the formation of the anti-pyrazinium<br>
salt compound of formula (6).<br>
Likewise, one skilled in the art is aware that<br>
the use of the syn isomer of 10,11-(optionally<br>
substituted)-methanodibenzosuberol (4) is not critical to<br>
the practice of this invention. The anti isomer of<br>
10,11-(optionally substituted)methanodibenzosuberol would<br>
be equally effective. This is because the formation of<br>
5-halo-10,11-(optionally substituted)-methanodibenzo-<br>
suberane (5) proceeds via the corresponding tropylium ion<br>
intermediate which in the case of the bromide provides<br>
the anti isomer of the compound of formula (5)<br>
preferentially, by the method of this invention.<br>
Additionally, the present invention provides a<br>
novel hydrate crystal form of (2R)-anti-5-{3-[4-(10,11-<br>
difluoromethanodibenzosuber-5-yl)piperazin-1-yl]-2-<br>
hydroxypropoxy}quinoline trihydrochloride ("Hydrate I").<br>
A number of methods are available to characterize<br>
crystalline forms of organic compounds. Among these<br>
methods are differential scanning calorimetry, solid<br>
state NMR spectrometry, infra-red spectroscopy, and x-ray<br>
powder diffraction. The x-ray powder diffraction pattern<br>
is very useful for distinguishing between different<br>
crystalline forms of a compound.<br>
X-ray powder diffraction analysis can be<br>
readily performed as follows. After lightly grinding the<br>
sample with an agate mortar and pestle, the sample is<br>
loaded into a sample holder for the x-ray powder<br>
diffraction measurement. The x-ray powder diffraction<br>
patterns are measured using a Siemens D5000 x-ray powder<br>
diffractometer equipped with a CuKa source (X=1.54056A).<br>
A NIST traceable digital hygrometer (model 11-661-16) was<br>
used to measure the actual relative humidity in the<br>
sample chamber. The 0% R.H. XRD patterns were obtained<br>
by pre-drying the samples over P2O5 for at least one week.<br>
Interplanar spacings and peak intensities for the most<br>
prominent features were measured using a double-<br>
derivative peak picking method. Hydrate I has a typical<br>
XRD pattern with the following interplanar spacings (d)<br>
in Angstroms, wherein the interplanar spacings have the<br>
following typical relative intensities (I/Io). The error<br>
of measurement is +/- 0.04 A. X-ray peaks with I/Io of 5%<br>
or greater were reported in Table 1, below. The cutoff<br>
was chosen arbitrarily.<br>

It is well known in the crystallography art that,<br>
for any given crystal form, the relative intensities of<br>
the diffraction peaks may vary due to a number of<br>
factors, including the effects of preferred orientation<br>
which result from a particular crystal morphology, and<br>
particle size. Where the effects of preferred<br>
orientation and/or particle size are present, peak<br>
intensities (that is, the I/Io value) are altered, but the<br>
characteristic peak positions of the polymorph are<br>
unchanged. See, e.g., The United States Pharmacopoeia<br>
#23, National Formulary #18. pages 1843-1844, 1995.<br>
The effects of preferred orientation can be greatly<br>
reduced using a sample that is prepared in a manner that<br>
minimizes this effects, such as the use of a well ground<br>
sample. Hydrate I may be characterized as having an X-<br>
ray diffraction pattern which comprises peaks<br>
corresponding to the following d spacings: 7.95 +/-0.04 A<br>
when obtained at 22 ±2°C and 31 ±10% relative humidity<br>
from a copper radiation source. Preferably, a properly<br>
prepared sample of Hydrate I may be characterized as<br>
having an X-ray diffraction pattern which comprises peaks<br>
corresponding to the following d spacings: 9.93, 7.95,<br>
4.45, and 3.36 +/- 0.04 A when obtained at 22 ±2oC and 31<br>
±10% relative humidity from a copper radiation source.<br>
Additionally, as the skilled artisan would<br>
appreciate. Hydrate I may also be characterized by solid<br>
state NMR spectroscopy. Solid state NMR (13C) analysis<br>
was performed using a Varian Unity 400 MHz spectrometer<br>
operating at a carbon frequency of 100.580 MHz, equipped<br>
with a complete solids accessory and Varian 7 mm VT<br>
CP/MAS probe. Acquisition parameters were as follows:<br>
90° proton r.f. pulse width 4.0 µs, contact time 1.0 ms,<br>
pulse repetition time 5 s, MAS frequency 7.0 kHz,<br>
spectral width 50 kHz. and acquisition time 50 ms.<br>
Chemical shifts were referenced to the methyl group of<br>
hexamethylbenzene (5 = 17.3 ppm) by sample replacement.<br>
Solid state 13C chemical shifts reflect not only the<br>
molecular structure of Hydrate I, but also the electronic<br>
environment of the molecule in the crystal. The<br>
diagnostic 13C resonances of Hydrate I, which appear in<br>
the 100-160 ppm chemical shift range, are 105.7, 106.5,<br>
111.0, 113.0, 118.8, 119.5, 130.0, 132.3, 133.7, 134.7,<br>
136.4, 136.7, 141.3, 142.6, 145.8, 148.1, 152.6, and<br>
153.6 ppm.<br>
The precise conditions under which Hydrate I is<br>
formed may be empirically determined and it is only<br>
possible to give a number of methods which have been<br>
found to be suitable in practice. Thus, for example.<br>
Hydrate I may be prepared by crystallization under<br>
controlled conditions. It is understood that the present<br>
process can utilize (2R)-anti-5-{3-[4-(10,11-<br>
difluoromethanodibenzoBuber-5-yl)piperazin-1-yl]-2-<br>
hydroxypropoxy}quinoline trihydrochloride regardless of<br>
its hydration state or crystalline state. In particular,<br>
it can be prepared either from (2R)-anti-5-{3-[4-{10,11-<br>
difluoromethanodibenzosuber-5-yl)piperazin-1-yl]-2-<br>
hydroxypropoxy)quinoline trihydrochloride or by<br>
recrystallization of previously isolated (2R)-anti-5-{3-<br>
[4-(10, 11-difluoromethanodibenzosuber-5-yl)piperazin-1-<br>
yl]-2-hydroxypropoxy)quinoline trihydrochloride.<br>
Mixtures of water and water-miscible solvents are used<br>
for the crystallization of Hydrate I. In general, the<br>
use of water miscible solvents such as alkyl ketones,<br>
e.g. acetone, butanone, and the like; alkyl nitriles,<br>
e.g. acetonitrile, propionitrile, and the like; and alkyl<br>
alcohols, e.g. methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, and the<br>
like; is preferred. In order to dissolve the starting<br>
material it may be helpful to warm the solvent system.<br>
It may be advantageous to add "seeds" of Hydrate I<br>
to the solution in order to induce crystallization.<br>
Hydrate I is readily soluble and can be filtered off from<br>
the crystallization solution, if desired after cooling,<br>
and washed and dried. If desired. Hydrate I prepared as<br>
above may be further crystallized using similar<br>
conditions for crystallization to those described above.<br>
The present invention is further illustrated by<br>
the following examples and preparations. These examples<br>
and preparations are illustrative only and are not<br>
intended to limit the invention in any way.<br>
Hydrate I was prepared by recrystallizing a<br>
compound of Example 1, as obtained by the previously<br>
defined process, as an ethanol wetcake, vacuum dried,<br>
then humidified to replace the ethanol. Therefore the<br>
present invention further encompasses a process of<br>
preparing Hydrate I comprising: a) forming an ethanol<br>
wetcake of (2R)-anti-5-{3-[4-(10,11-<br>
difluoromethanodibenzosuber-5-yl) piperazin-1-yl]-2-<br>
hydroxypropbxy}quinoline trihydrochloride, b) drying the<br>
ethanol wetcake by vacuum to obtain dry (2R)-anti-5-{3-<br>

Hydrate I.<br>
The following solvates may be converted to<br>
Hydrate I by humidification to replace the organic<br>

organic solvents used for recrystallization are non-<br>
specific and maybe used in a multitude of combinations.<br>
Methanol/H2O solvate was prepared by dissolving<br>

The present invention further provides the use<br>
of Hydrate I in combination with a pharmaceutically<br>
active agent, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt<br>

inhibitor.<br>
Preferably, the present invention relates to a<br>
pharmaceutical formulation comprising Hydrate I; one or<br>
more pharmaceutical carriers, diluents, or excipients;<br>
and optionally a treatment drug.<br>
When employed as a pharmaceutical, Hydrate I is<br>
usually administered in the form of pharmaceutical<br>
compositions. These compositions can be administered by<br>
a variety of routes including oral, rectal, transdermal,<br>
and intranasal. Such compositions are prepared in a<br>
manner well known in the pharmaceutical art and comprise<br>
Hydrate I.<br>
The term "substantially pure" refers to the crystal<br>
phase purity of Hydrate I. In practice we have found<br>
that small amounts of other crystalline forms do not<br>
adversely affect the advantageous properties of Hydrate<br>
I. According to the present invention substantially pure<br>
refers to Hydrate I which is greater than 90%, preferably<br>
greater than 95% of the total crystalline material.<br>
This invention also includes pharmaceutical<br>
compositions which contain Hydrate I (referred to as<br>
"active ingredient" herein below) associated with<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. In making the<br>
compositions of this invention, the active ingredient is<br>
usually mixed with an excipient, diluted by an excipient<br>
or enclosed within such a carrier which can be in the<br>
form of a capsule, sachet, paper or other container.<br>
When the excipient serves as a diluent, it can be a solid<br>
or semi-solid which acts as a vehicle, carrier, or medium<br>
for the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be<br>
in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges,<br>
sachets, cachets, emulsions, aerosols, ointments<br>
containing, for example, up to 10% by weight of the<br>
active compound, tablet, soft and hard gelatin capsules,<br>
suppositories, and sterile packaged powders.<br>
Some examples of suitable excipients include<br>
lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches,<br>
gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth,<br>
gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, sterile water, syrup,<br>
and methyl cellulose. The formulations can additionally<br>
include: lubricating agents such as talc, magnesium<br>
stearate, and mineral oil; wetting agents; emulsifying<br>
and suspending agents; preserving agents such as methyl-<br>
and propylhydroxy-benzoates; sweetening agents; and<br>
flavoring agents. The compositions of the invention can<br>
be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or<br>
delayed release of the active ingredient after<br>
administration to the patient by employing procedures<br>
known in the art.<br>
The compositions are preferably formulated in a unit<br>
dosage form, each dosage containing from about 5 to about<br>
100 mg, more usually about 10 mg to about 30 mg, of the<br>
active ingredient. The term "unit dosage forms" refers<br>
to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages<br>
for human subjects and other mammals, each unit<br>
containing a predetermined quantity of active material<br>
calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in<br>
association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient.<br>
Preferably, Hydrate I is employed at no more than about<br>
20 weight percent of the pharmaceutical composition, more<br>
preferably no more than about 15 weight percent, with the<br>
balance being pharmaceutically inert carrier (s).<br>
Hydrate I is effective over a wide dosage range and<br>
is generally administered in a pharmaceutically effective<br>
amount. It, will be understood, however, that the amount<br>
of the compound actually administered will be determined<br>
by a physician, in the light of the relevant<br>
circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the<br>
chosen route of administration, the actual compound<br>
administered, the age, weight, and response of the<br>
individual patient, the severity of the patient's<br>
symptoms, and the like.<br>
For preparing compositions such as tablets, the<br>
active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical<br>
excipient to form a solid pre-formulation composition<br>
containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the<br>
present invention. When referring to these pre-<br>
formulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that<br>
the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the<br>
composition so that the composition may be readily<br>
subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such<br>
as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid pre-<br>
formulation is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of<br>
the type described above containing from, for example,<br>
0.1 to about 500 tag of the active ingredient of the<br>
present invention.<br>
The tablets or pills of the present invention may be<br>
coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form<br>
affording the advantage of prolonged action. Por<br>
example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage<br>
and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the<br>
form of an envelope over the former. The two components<br>
can separated by enteric layer which serves to resist<br>
disintegration in the stomach and permit the inner<br>
component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be<br>
delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used<br>
for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials<br>
including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of<br>
polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl<br>
alcohol, and cellulose acetate.<br>
Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include<br>
liquids, suspensions, and powders. The liquid or solid<br>
compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipients as described supra. Preferably the<br>
compositions are administered by the oral or nasal<br>
respiratory route for local or systemic effect.<br>
Compositions in preferably pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
solvents may be nebulized by use of inert gases.<br>
Nebulized solutions may be breathed directly from the<br>
nebulizing device or the nebulizing device may be<br>
attached to a face masks tent, or intermittent positive<br>
pressure breathing machine. Solution, suspension, or<br>
powder compositions may be administered, preferably<br>
orally or nasally, from devices which deliver the<br>
formulation in an appropriate manner.<br>

and stirring is continued until dispersed. The mixture<br>
is then cooled until solid.<br>
Another preferred formulation employed in the<br>
methods of the present invention employs transdemal<br>
delivery devices ('patches'). Such transdemal patches<br>
may be used to provide continuous or discontinuous<br>
infusion of the compounds of the present invention in<br>
controlled amounts. The construction and use of<br>
transdermal patches for the delivery of pharmaceutical<br>
agents is well known in the art. See, e.g., D.S. Patent<br>
5,023,252, issued June 11, 1991, herein incorporated by<br>
reference. Such patches may be constructed for<br>
continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery of<br>
pharmaceutical agents.<br>
Frequently, it will be desirable or necessary to<br>
introduce the pharmaceutical composition to the brain,<br>
either directly or indirectly. Direct techniques usually<br>
involve placement of a drug delivery catheter into the<br>
host's ventricular system to bypass the blood-brain<br>
barrier. One such implantable delivery system used for<br>
the transport of biological factors to specific<br>
anatomical regions of the body is described in U.S.<br>
Patent 5,011,472 which is herein incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>
Indirect techniques, which are generally preferred,<br>
usually involve formulating the compositions to provide<br>
for drug latentiation by the conversion of hydrophilic<br>
drugs into lipid-isoluble drugs. Latentiation is<br>
generally achieved through blocking of the hydroxy,<br>
carbonyl, sulfate, and primary amine groups present on<br>
the drug to render the drug more lipid soluble and<br>
amenable to transportation across the blood-brain<br>
barrier. Alternatively, the delivery of hydrophilic drugs<br>
may be enhanced by intra-arterial infusion of hypertonic<br>
solutions which can transiently open the blood-brain<br>
barrier.<br>
Other suitable formulations for use in the present<br>
invention can be found in Remington's Pharmaceutical<br>
Sciences, Mace Publishing Company, Philadelphia, PA, 17th<br>
ed. (1985).<br>
As noted above, Hydrate I is suitable for use in a<br>
variety of drug delivery systems described above.<br>
Additionally, in order to enhance the in vivo serum<br>
half-life of the present compound, it may be<br>
encapsulated, introduced into the lumen of liposomes,<br>
prepared as a colloid, or other conventional techniques<br>
may be employed which provide an extended serum half-life<br>
of the compounds. A variety of methods are available for<br>
preparing liposomes, as described in, e.g., Szoka, et<br>
al., U.S. Patent Nos. 4,235,871, 4,501,728 and 4,837,028<br>
each of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The amount of Hydrate I administered to the patient<br>
will vary depending upon the purpose of the<br>
administration, such as prophylaxis or therapy, the state<br>
of the patient, the manner of administration, and the<br>
like. In therapeutic applications, compositions are<br>
administered to a patient already suffering from<br>
Alzheimer's disease in an amount sufficient to at least<br>
partially arrest further onset of the symptoms of the<br>
disease and its complications. An amount adequate to<br>
accomplish this is defined as "therapeutically effective<br>
dose." Amounts effective for this use will depend on the<br>
judgment of the attending clinician depending upon<br>
factors such as the degree or severity of the disease<br>
state in the patient, the age, weight and general<br>
condition of the patient, and the like. Preferably, for<br>
use as therapeutics. Hydrate I is administered at dosages<br>
ranging from about 1 to about 500 mg/kg/day.<br>
The present invention provides a process for<br>
preparing Hydrate I which comprises crystallizing (2R)-<br>
anti-5-(3-[4-(10, 11-difluoromethanodibenxosuber-5-<br>
yl)piperazin-1-yl]-2-hydroxypropoxy)quinoline<br>
trihydrochloride from a solution of water and a water<br>
miscible solvent under conditions which yields Hydrate I.<br>
