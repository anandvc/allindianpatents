OSCILLATORY DRIVE<br>
The present invention relates to an oscillatory drive having<br>
-	an output shaft that can be driven to perform a rotationally oscillating movement<br>
about its longitudinal axis and that comprises a free end,<br>
-	a holding fixture at the free end of the output shaft comprising a contact surface<br>
for attachment of a tool,<br>
-	a mounting section on the holding fixture, raised relative to the contact surface,<br>
that projects to the outside in the direction of the longitudinal axis and that is<br>
designed for form-locking connection with a mounting opening of a tool placed<br>
in contact with the contact surface, and<br>
-	fixing means for fixing the tool with its mounting opening on the holding<br>
fixture.<br>
An oscillatory drive of that kind is known from US 6 945 862 B2.<br>
The term oscillatory drive as used herein is meant to describe a drive the output shaft<br>
of which performs a rotatingly oscillating movement in operation. A tool mounted<br><br>
2<br>
on the output shaft can then be used in multiple ways, for example for sawing,<br>
cutting or grinding.<br>
Basically, there have been known two ways of connecting a tool with an output<br>
shaft. According to a first variant, the tool is urged against a holding fixture at the<br>
free end of the output shaft by a clamping element, for example a clamping screw, so<br>
that a high frictional force is produced between the tool and the holding fixture. A<br>
connection of that kind is described as frictional connection.<br>
According to a second variant, the holding fixture or the tool comprises a mounting<br>
section capable of engaging a correspondingly shaped mounting opening in the<br>
respective matching part. Transmission of torques is achieved in this case by form-<br>
locking connection between the mounting section and the mounting opening.<br>
Compared with a frictional connection, a form-locking connection provides the<br>
advantage that it permits transmission of even very high torques.<br>
However, when used in continuous operation, oscillatory drives have also shown<br>
certain disadvantages regarding the transmission of high torques to the tools. For<br>
example, the mounting openings may get worked out in part. After extended opera-<br>
tion, heating-up of the tools by the oscillatory drive has also been observed.<br>
In view of this, it is the object of the present invention to provide an improved<br>
oscillatory drive that reduces the disadvantages inherent with a form-locking trans-<br>
mission of torques to the tool.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by an oscillatory drive of the<br>
above-mentioned kind where the tool is held on the mounting section to resiliently<br>
yield in axial direction under the action of a torque, against a pre-stress, and the<br>
mounting section permits the tool to rotate by a certain angle of rotation when the<br>
tool gives way axially.<br>
The object of the invention thereby is fully achieved.<br><br>
3<br>
The oscillatory drive according to the invention combines the advantages of a form-<br>
locking connection, namely the possibility to transmit high torques, with the advan-<br>
tages of a frictional connection, namely that overloading can be avoided.<br>
According to the invention, the torque generally is transmitted by form-locking<br>
connection between the mounting section of the output shaft and the mounting<br>
opening of the tool.<br>
When the loading of the oscillatory drive rises, the oscillatory drive according to the<br>
invention now allows the tool to yield a little in axial direction, relative to the<br>
longitudinal axis of the drive shaft. As a result of that axial yielding of the tool, the<br>
tool moves into a portion of the mounting section that allows rotation of the tool by<br>
a certain angle of rotation.<br>
One thereby achieves a certain resilience under high loads that permits a certain<br>
relative movement of the tool with respect to the output shaft. This has the effect to<br>
reduce possible torque peaks. At the same time, this also reduces the risk of heat<br>
developing by the transmission of torques and prevents the mounting opening from<br>
being worn.<br>
The newly provided possibility to have the tool yield axially relative to the contact<br>
surface and to rotate by a certain angle of rotation causes the force acting upon the<br>
mounting section in the plane of oscillation to be split up into two components,<br>
namely an axially acting force component to which the tool reacts by pressing<br>
axially against the fixing means, and a remaining force component acting in the<br>
plane of oscillation.<br>
As soon as the load acting on the tool decreases again, the fixing means pushes the<br>
tool back into its form-locking initial position. The force opposed to the axial dis-<br>
placement of the tool by the fixing means is obtained by the fact that the fixing<br><br>
4<br>
means is given an elastic and/or resilient portion or is received in an elastic and/or<br>
resilient fashion.<br>
The fixing means presses elastically and/or resiliently against the tool already in its<br>
initial position, thereby retaining it in its form-locking seat. Under high loads, the<br>
tool counteracts the force exerted by the fixing means so that in a way part of the<br>
force that acts on the mounting section is directed against the fixing means. The fact<br>
that the tool gives way axially causes the force exerted by the fixing means to rise<br>
and to urge the tool back into its secure form-locking position as soon as the in-<br>
creased load diminishes.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the mounting section widens at<br>
least over a certain area in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis and toward the<br>
contact surface.<br>
The width of the mounting section is determined in a plane vertical to the longitu-<br>
dinal axis, and is measured along an arc of a circle which has its center located on<br>
the longitudinal axis. To describe the increase in width of the mounting section<br>
toward the contact surface it therefore can be said that the width of the mounting<br>
section in a first plane, extending vertically to the longitudinal axis, is larger than its<br>
width in a parallel plane further remote from the contact surface than the first plane.<br>
Put in other words this means that the mounting section becomes narrower or tapers<br>
in a direction away from the contact surface at least in one area. This could especially<br>
mean that the base of the mounting section, by which the mounting section rests on<br>
the contact area, is larger than the surface of the mounting section opposite its base.<br>
Unless the afore-mentioned surfaces are plane it is necessary to give due considera-<br>
tion to the respective superficial measure, related to a plane vertical to the longitudi-<br>
nal axis.<br><br>
5<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, the mounting section comprises<br>
a plurality of projections extending radially to the outside, related to the longitudinal<br>
axis.<br>
Such projections permit the form-locking seat and the desired transmission of<br>
torques to be realized especially efficiently.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, each projection forms at least<br>
one flank starting from the contact surface and having a straight line as its base line<br>
on the contact surface.<br>
In that case, a corresponding contact surface having a straight base line should<br>
likewise be formed at the mounting opening of the tool. Transmission of the torque<br>
can then occur along the entire straight line. This can then eliminate punctual<br>
loading between the mounting element and the mounting opening so that areas of<br>
especially high heat load can be avoided.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, the surface of the flank forms a<br>
planar trapezoid.<br>
With the surface of the flank designed in this way, especially good forced sliding of<br>
the part of the mounting opening that corresponds with that flank will be achieved<br>
during rotation of the tool. Further, it is an advantage of that embodiment that the<br>
amount of forced sliding of that part of the mounting opening and, thus, the<br>
amount the tool gives way axially are approximately proportional to the force that<br>
acts upon the tool in the plane of oscillation. This means that the higher the load<br>
acting on the tool, the greater will be the distance the tool can give way axially.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, the angle enclosed between the<br>
flank and the longitudinal axis is between 5° and 40°, preferably between 10° and<br><br>
6<br>
25°, especially between 13° and 17°. The angle may be selected in consideration of<br>
the materials to be paired, such as steel and steel, or steel and aluminum.<br>
Within that range of angles, good balancing is ensured between secure, form-locking<br>
torque transmission on the one hand and the desired resilience in the sense of<br>
rotation under high load on the other hand.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, the output shaft comprises a<br>
tension element, biased by a spring element, on which the fixing means can be<br>
located.<br>
In the case of that embodiment, the fixing means, for example a fixing pin, is held<br>
by the substantially rigid tension element, and the tension element in turn is held<br>
resiliently in the oscillatory drive by the spring element. The principle of such a<br>
structure has been known, for example, from DE 39 02 874 A1.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, the fixing means comprises an<br>
elastic and/or resilient section.<br>
In the case of that embodiment, the tool is held by an element which due to its<br>
partly elastic and/or resilient property permits the tool to give way axially. Such a<br>
fixing means can be realized, for example, as a clamping screw the screw head of<br>
which offers a certain elasticity or can be displaced elastically relative to its barrel.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, the mounting section has a<br>
polygonal shape, preferably a hexagonal shape, in cross-section.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, the projections have a symmet-<br>
ric design, related to the direction radial to the longitudinal axis, and each of them<br>
comprises two flanks that are interconnected by a common curved area that faces<br>
away from the longitudinal axis.<br><br>
7<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, the flanks approach each other<br>
at an angle of between 5° and 35°, preferably between 10° and 25°; especially be-<br>
tween 12° and 18°.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, the flanks of the projections<br>
terminate by an undercut in an area close to the longitudinal axis.<br>
It can be ensured with the aid of this feature that the transmission of torques will not<br>
occur in the innermost area of the projection, viewed radially from the longitudinal<br>
axis, but rather in its central, in some cases also in its outer area.<br>
It is understood that the features of the invention mentioned above and those yet to<br>
be explained below can be used not only in the respective combination indicated,<br>
but also in other combinations or in isolation, without leaving the scope of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Further features and advantages of the invention are illustrated in the drawing and<br>
will become apparent from the detailed description that follows. In the drawings:<br>

Fig. 6b	shows a top view of the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 6a.<br>
Fig. la shows an oscillatory drive 10 with an output shaft 12, that can be driven to<br>
oscillate rotatingly about its longitudinal axis 14, and with a free end 16. The free<br>
end 16 carries a holding fixture 18 with a contact surface 20 intended to receive a<br>
tool 22 (Fig. 3). An enlarged detail of the holding fixture 18 is illustrated in Fig. 1b.<br>
A mounting section 24 arranged on the holding fixture 18 projects outwardly from<br>
the contact surface 20 in the direction of the longitudinal axis 14 and is adapted for<br>
form-locking connection to a mounting opening 26 (Fig. 3) of a tool 22 attached to<br>
the contact surface 20.<br>
The oscillatory drive 10 further comprises a quick-change clamping device 29 with a<br>
clamping lever 30 by means of which a tension element 31 received in the output<br>
shaft 12 can be displaced axially between a working position and an inoperative<br>
position. The tension element 31 may carry a fixing means 28, for example in the<br>
form of a screw, that passes through the mounting opening 26 in a tool 22 fitted on<br>
the mounting section 24.<br><br>
9<br>
In the inoperative position, the tension element 31 is pushed in axially outward<br>
direction by the clamping lever 30 so that the fixing means 28 can be released in this<br>
position without the aid of any implement for changing the tool 22. Turning over<br>
the clamping lever 30 will move the tension element 31 into its working position in<br>
which the tension element 31 is tensioned under the effect of a spring element 32 so<br>
that the fixing means 28 and, accordingly, the tool 22 are biased against the contact<br>
surface 20 of the holding fixture 18 under the action of the spring element 32.<br>
The fixing means 28 is indicated in the drawing as a pin 34 with a head 35 fitted in<br>
the tension element 31.<br>
However, it is also imaginable - especially when the oscillatory drive 10 does not<br>
comprise a quick-change clamping device 29 and, thus, a spring element 32 - to give<br>
the edge of the head 35 a resilient configuration so as to allow the tool 22 to be<br>
axially displaced in which case the head 35 of the pin 34 will exert a restoring force<br>
on the tool 22.<br>
Having the fixing means 28 mounted resiliently has the effect that the fixing means<br>
28 can be displaced even against the force exerted by the spring element 30, i.e. away<br>
from the contact surface 20, if a correspondingly high force is exerted on the fixing<br>
means 28.<br>
Consequently, either the tension element 31 or the fixing means 28 allows the tool<br>
22 to be axially displaced. The force required to counteract the pre-stress of the fixing<br>
means 28 is provided by the torque acting between the output shaft 12 and the tool<br>
22, as will be explained hereafter in more detail.<br>
The mounting section 24 comprises in this case four projections 36 all arranged<br>
about the longitudinal axis 14 at an angle of 90° one relative to the other. (One of<br>
the projections 36 is hidden in this Figure.) The projections 36 are connected one<br>
with the other by arc-shaped sections 44 that extend concentrically to the longitudi-<br><br>
10<br>
nal axis 14. All in all it can be rioted that the mounting section 24 widens in a<br>
direction parallel to the longitudinal axis 14 and in a direction toward the contact<br>
surface 20.<br>
When viewing Figs. 2a and 2b, showing a top view of the holding fixture 18 and an<br>
enlarged view of one projection 34, as a whole it will be seen that the projections 36<br>
have a symmetrical shape, viewed in a radial direction relative to the longitudinal<br>
axis 14, and comprise two flanks 38 each that are interconnected by a common<br>
curved area 42 that faces away from the longitudinal axis 14. The ground line 40 of<br>
each of the flanks 38 on the contact surface 20 is a straight line.<br>
In a side view similar to Figs, 1a, 1b, each of the flanks 38 forms a planar trapezoid.<br>
The angle enclosed between each flank 38 and the longitudinal axis 14 is approxi-<br>
mately 50° in this case. The angle β at the rounded portion of the projection 36 is<br>
likewise approximately 50° in this case, although it may be selected to be different<br>
from the angle a, if desired.<br>
As can be seen especially in Fig. 2b, the projection 36 tapers in radial direction, from<br>
the longitudinal axis 14 toward the outside. The tapering shape is obtained by an<br>
arrangement where the flat flanks 38 approach each other in radially outward direc-<br>
tion. The angle γ between the two flat flanks 38 is approximately 15° in this case.<br>
In addition to the before-mentioned tapering shape, the flanks 38 of the projections<br>
36 terminate by an undercut 46 in an area close to the longitudinal axis 14. This may<br>
have the effect that force transmission between the output shaft 12 and the tool 22<br>
occurs mainly or exclusively along the flanks 38.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the oscillatory drive 10 with a tool 22 fitted. The mounting opening 26<br>
comprises eight recesses adapted in shape and size to the projections 36, so that the<br>
tool 22 can be fitted in different positions - as illustrated by the broken line. The<br>
direction of oscillation of the oscillatory drive 10 is indicated by a double arrow 48.<br><br>
11<br>
Once the tool 22 is in contact with the contact surface 20, a form-locking connection<br>
is established between the mounting section 24 and the mounting opening 26. The<br>
permitted angle of rotation 8 is shown symbolically. It can be noted that the amount<br>
of the angle of rotation 8 is greatly exaggerated in this case, for illustration purposes,<br>
and that the angle of rotation occurring in practice will be clearly smaller, especially<br>
in the order of less than 1°. The angle of rotation 8 maximally possible in theory is<br>
limited by the design of the quick-change clamping device 29 or the fixing means 28,<br>
respectively, as a form-locking connection will be established in each end position.<br>
In practice, however, the oscillations occurring at high frequency (- 5000 to 30.000<br>
oscillations per minute) and a small oscillating angle (0.5° to 7°) will result in very<br>
small angles of rotation δ.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the holding fixture 18 with a fitted tool 22, the tool 22 being urged<br>
against the contact surface 20 by the fixing means 28.<br>
It can be seen that edges 50 of the mounting opening 26 of the tool 22 are in contact<br>
with the projection 36 in the area of the ground line 40. Consequently, the torque is<br>
transmitted from the output shaft 12 to the tool 22 by a form-locking connection.<br>
The situation obtained when the tool 22 is subjected to high loads is illustrated in<br>
Figs. 5a and 5b which show the holding fixture 18 and an enlarged section of the<br>
holding fixture 18, respectively.<br>
It can be noted that the tool 22 has been lifted off the contact surface 20 in the axial<br>
direction. Here again, the axial displacement has been greatly exaggerated in the<br>
drawing, for improved clarity. The inclined flank 38 has the effect that the force that<br>
previously acted on the mounting section 24, especially on the projections 36, in a<br>
plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 14, is converted in part to a force that<br>
acts axially to the longitudinal axis 14. The force acting in the axial direction is<br>
indicated by an arrow 52. The remaining force component, acting transversely to the<br>
longitudinal axis 14, is indicated by an arrow 54.<br><br>
12<br>
The force acting on the tool 22 has the effect that the mounting opening 26 of the<br>
tool slides up along the flank 38. As a reaction to the axial force component 52, the<br>
tool 22 counteracts the pre-stress of the fixing means 28, while the force component<br>
54 causes the tool 22 to rotate by an angle of rotation . Rotation of the tool can<br>
occur when the axial force component 52 exceeds the pre-stress produced by the<br>
spring element.<br>
When the load on the tool 22 diminishes again, or the direction of oscillation<br>
changes, the axial force component 52 will decrease again and the tool 22 will be<br>
urged against the contact surface 20 by the fixing means 28.<br>
The certain degree of resilience of the tool 22 at high torques has the effect that<br>
torque peaks, produced by the oscillating movement, are absorbed and, conse-<br>
quently, heating-up of the tool and wearing of the mounting opening 26 are re-<br>
duced.<br>
Resilience can be achieved with advantage especially in an oscillatory drive 10 with a<br>
quick-change clamping device 28 because in this case advantage can be taken of the<br>
spring element 32 already available to achieve the desired movability in axial direc-<br>
tion.<br>
Figs. 6a and 6b show one example of an alternate embodiment of the holding fixture<br>
18 with a mounting section 24 in the form of a hexagon. Other irregular or regular<br>
polygons, especially rectangles or pentagons, can be chosen as well.<br><br>
