				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a process for the manufacture of a sugar free, nutritious food product.<br>
Consequent in increase in health consciousness, dietetic foods have gained importance especially in recent times. Foods which are rich in calories and are therefore detri¬mental to health are sought to be avoided by a large sec¬tion of the public.<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to propose a sugar free food product which is sufficiently nutritious to meet the requirements of the calorie conscious and restricted sugar intake population.<br>
Conventionally, a food product such as a biscuit, is  made<br>
by  mixing vegetable fat, sugar, colour, flavour,  butter,<br>
       skimmed  milk  powder and water, among  other  ingredients<br>
       (creaming stage). Next wheat flour is prepared into  dough<br>
      (dough making stage).  The dough is mixed with the  cream-<br>
      ing stage mass and baked, to obtain the end product.<br>
Sugar,  apart  from  imparting  sweet  taste,  to  a  food<br>
product,  has a shortening effect and therefore makes  the<br>
dough more readily expandable during baking.  It gives the<br>
product  its characteristic bite, a pleasing colour,  acts<br>
          as a vehicle for flavour and contributes to the volume.<br>
         On  the  other hand, artificial sweeteners, due  to  their<br>
         high intensity  sweetness, can only be used in a miniscule<br>
	quantity, when compared to the quantity of sugar used  for<br>
the  same  product.   Consequently,  in  the  conventional<br>
methods  employed, straightaway mixing a low  quantity  of<br><br>
artificial sweeteners in the product will not result in uniform distribution of the former in the latter- The shortening effect of sugar will also not be present if artificial sweeteners are used merely to replace sugar. In such 3 case the product loses its characteristic bite, colour, freshness.<br>
This invention therefore proposes a process for the manu¬facture of a sugar free food product, which despite the absence of sugar, still retains the desirable characteris¬tics referred to above, by carrying out the process pro¬posed herein without mixing the artificial sweeteners straightaway into the product mass, but by preparing a pre-mix of specified ingredients and carrying out subse¬quent mixing in a phased manner as defined herein. According to this invention, the artificial sweetener is first  mixed with at least one low calorie bulking  agent.<br>
       This mixture is added at the creaming stage and then again<br>
»&gt;■<br>
       at the dough making stage of the product to ensure uniform<br>
distribution  of  the sweetener and also to  maintain  the<br>
product characteristics-  This procedure is in contrast to<br>
         the  conventional process wherein the entire  quantity  of<br><br>
sugar is added during the creaming stage itself.<br>
        in  short,  the preparation of a mixture of at  least  one<br>
       artificial sweetener and at least one low calorie  bulking<br>
agent  and adding of the same at two stages of  mixing  of<br>
the  process,  namely, the creaming stage  and  the  dough<br>
making   stage    give     the     final    product    its<br><br>
characterlstio features of texture, finish and taste.<br>
The  food  product proposed herein is  a  baked  food product  and, according to one of its preferred  forms, is a biscuit.<br>
The process for the manufacture of a sugar free, nutritious, food product, according to this invention, comprises a creaming stage, a dough making stage and a baking stage, such as herein described, a11 said stages involving sugar free ingredients, characterised in that the said process also comprises the preparation of a mixture of (1) at least one artificial sweetener selected from aspartame (0.07 - 0.17% by weight), aoaaulfame - K (0.05 - 0. 15% by weight), suoralose (0,02 - 0.06% by weight) (11) at least one low calorie bulking agent such as herein described) whereby upto 100% by weight of the said mixture is added to the ingredients of the creaming stage, during mixing, to obtain a creaming stage mass containing the said mixture uniformly distributed therein, the remainder, if any, of the said mixture being added to the said mass along with flour, during mixing, at the dough making stage, such that the said remainder. if any, is also  uniformly  distributed;  forming  the  dough  and<br><br>
baking  the same thereafter  to obtain the  said  final product.<br>
A general description of the process proposed herein is given below followed by a process flow chart given as an Example of carrying out the process, by way of illustration, and not by way of limitation. Low calorie bulking agent oligofructose at 1.25-8% and or inulin at 5-15% is mixed with aspartame (0.07-0.17%) or acesulfame K 
1., Creaming Stage;- wherein a low calorie emulsifying agent, sorbitol at 1.0-9.0% and non-calorific fibre sources, namely wheat fibre at i.5-7.5% are added along with other Ingredients like oil/oils or fat (6-15%) skimmed milk powder (0.6-2%), fat replacer (1-8.8%), edible starch (i.5-7.5%) emulslfier (1.0-3.0%), salt, flavour, colour and mixed at rpm &gt; 30 followed by leavening agents dissolved in water and mixed at speed&gt; 30 rpm speed for 2 minutes to 20 minutes. Up to 100% of  the  mixture  of  artificial  sweetner(s)  and  low<br><br>
calorie  bulking  agent(a) is added  in  this  oreaming<br>
stage before leavening agents are added.  The remaining<br>
of  the  said mixture, if any, is added at  the  dough<br>
making  stage.   Thus, if 98% of the  said  mixture  is<br>
added  at the oreaming stage, the remainder 2%     thereof<br>
is added at the dough making stage.  On the other  hand<br>
the entire 100%  of the said mixture oan be added at the<br>
creaming stage itself.<br>
2.	Dough  making  stage;   Wheat  flour  along   with<br>
the   remainder  (if  any)  of  the  said  mixture   of<br>
artificial   sweetener(s)  and  low   calorie   bulking<br>
agent(s)  are  added and mixed at RPM below  50  for  a<br>
minute followed by dough conditioner and further  mixed<br>
at rpm 
process  of premixing  artificial  sweetener/sweeteners<br>
and  low  calorie bulking agent/ bulking agents,  as  a<br>
sugar substitute and addition of the same up to i.00%  at<br>
the  creaming stage and the remainder, if any,  at  the<br>
dough   making  stage,  ensures  proper   blending   of<br>
artificial sweetener(s) in dough and gives the biscuits<br>
Its  characteristic  texture,  finish  and  taste  even<br>
without sugar.<br>
It  is  possible  to have a  low  calorie  cream  layer<br>
prepared in the known way and sandwiched between a pair<br>
of biscuits manufactured by the process proposed herein<br>
to cater to the requirements of those who prefer "cream biscuits*.<br><br><br><br>
The terms and expressions in this specification are of description and not of limitation, as such terms and expressions do not, and are not Intended to, exclude any equivalents of the features of this Invention Illustrated and described herein.<br>
We Clalm:<br>
