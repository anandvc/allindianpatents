AMORPHOUS PRECIPITATED SILISA CHARACTERIZED BY HIGH DISPERSION IN CURED ORGANIC RUBBER COMPOSITIONS<br>
This invention relates to a process for preparing an amorphous precipitated silica.<br>
Amorphous precipitated silica is finding increasing<br>
use as a reinforcing pigment in cured organic rubber<br>
compositions, especially tire treads.  A problem which has<br>
of arisen is the rather  low degree^dispersion of amorphous<br>
precipitated silica in the cured organic rubber as evidenced by large percentages of total white area in an optical microscope field   Grinding or milling the silica before use in forming the cured organic rubber composition may produce better dispersions and hence exhibit lesser total white area in the optical microscope field, but once the bulk of the improvement has been achieved, continued grinding or milling, even for prolonged periods, does not result in much further improvement in the degree of dispersion<br>
New amorphous precipitated silicas have now been discovered which are characterized by high degrees of dispersibility in cured organic rubber compositions<br>
Accordingly, one embodiment of the invention is<br>
amorphous precipitated silica characterized by   (a) a standard white area less than 0.8 percent, (b) a BET surface area in the range of from 100 to 3 00 m2/g; (c) a CTAB surface area in the range of from 85 to 275 m2/g; (d) a Sears surface area in the range of from 200 to 400 m2/g, and (e) a pore diameter at the maximum of the volume pore size distribution function of from 10 to 60 nm.<br>
In this embodiment standard white area is determined using a standard protocol and a standard cured organic rubber formulation.  Since both the protocol and the formulation are standardized, the standard white area is properly taken as a characteristic of the amorphous precipitated silica   Amorphous precipitated silicas characterized by low standard white areas<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
may be highly dispersed in many cured organic rubber compositions.  The standard protocol to be used for determination of standard white area according to the present invention is as follows Mixing Protocol<br>
Use a 1.6-liter Kobelco Stewart Bollinq Model "00" internal mixer or equivalent for mixing the various ingredients. The mixer has four rotor speeds: 77, 116, 155, and 230 revolutions per minute (rpm).<br>
Line a 500-milliliter (mL) plastic cup with a<br>
polyethylene bag and add Sundex(r) 8125 oil (Sun Company, Inc., Refining and Marketing Division, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) in the amount of 30.0 parts per hundred parts of rubber by weight (phr)   To the polyethylene bag add 2.5 phr Kadox(r) 920C surface treated zinc oxide (Zinc Corporation of America, Monaca, Pennsylvania), 2.0 phr Wingstay(r) 100 mixed diaryl p-phenylenediamine (The Goodyear Tire &amp;. Rubber Co., Akron, Ohio; supplier: R  T Vanderbilt Company, Inc., Norwalk, Connecticut), and 1 0 phr rubber grade stearic acid (C  P  Hall, Chicago, Illinois) on top of the oil.  Just before mixing, add to the polyethylene bag 4 phr of the amorphous precipitated silica to be tested<br>
Before beginning the first pass, put 600 grams (g) CV-60 grade natural rubber through the mixer to clean it and bring the temperature up to about 65°C  Turn on the cooling water and open the bottom door to remove the rubber and to cool the mixer to about 3 8°C<br>
Commence the first pass by adding the rubber, viz , 363 7 g (70.0 phr) Solflex 1216 solution styrene-butadiene rubber (The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., Akron, Ohio) and 155.9 g (30 0 phr) Budene 1207 butadiene rubber (The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., Akron, Ohio) to the mixer and mixing for 0.5 minute at 116 rpm  Raise the rotor speed to 155 rpm and add 28.5 phr<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
of the amorphous precipitated silica to be tested.  After a further 0.5 minute raise the ram and sweep.  After a further 0 5 minute add 32 5 phr of the amorphous-precipitated silica to be tested  After a further 0.5 minute raise the ram and sweep. After a further 0.5 minute add 13.0 phr X50S(r) 1:1 Si-69_Si lane coupling agent and N330-HAF carbon black (Degussa Corp , Ridgefield, Park, New Jersey; supplier: Struktol Corp. of America, Stow, Ohio).  After a further 0 5 minute raise the ram and sweep   After a further 0.5 minute add the polyethylene bag and the ingredients contained therein  Mix the stock for an additional 6 minutes to achieve a maximum temperature in the range of from 165°C to 175°C and to complete the first pass in the mixer  Depending upon the type of silica, the rotor speed may need to be increased or decreased to achieve a maximum temperature in the foregoing range within the 6-minute mixing period.<br>
Dump the stock, measure its temperature with a<br>
thermocouple, and weigh it.  Sheet the stock off on a two-roll rubber mill and cut it into strips in preparation for the second pass in the mixer  Mill approximately 60 grams of stock to a thickness of about 0 1 inch (2.54 millimeters (mm)), and use it to make a pouch for 2.0 phr Santoflex(r) 13 N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N' -phenyl-p-phenylenediamme (Monsanto, St  Louis, Missouri) and 1.5 phr Okerin(r) 7240 microcrystalline wax/paraffin wax blend (Astor Corporation, Norcross, Georgia)<br>
Allow approximately one hour between the completion of the first pass in the mixer and the beginning of the second pass<br>
Bring the temperature of the mixer to approximately 38°C  With the cooling water running, commence the second pass by adding the strips of first pass stock to the mixer which is running at 116 rpm.  After a further 2 minutes add the pouch containing the Santoflex(r) 13 N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-<br><br>
_ 4 -<br>
phenylenediamine and the Okerin(r) 7240 microcrystalline wax/paraffin wax blend  After a further one minute raise the ram and sweep   Varying rotor speed if necessary, mix the stock for an additional one minute to achieve a temperature of 160 °C and to complete the second pass in the mixer<br>
Dump the stock, measure its temperature with a<br>
thermocouple, and weigh it   Sheet the stock off on a two-roll rubber mill and cut it into strips in preparation for the third pass in the mixer.  Mill approximately 60 grams of stock to a thickness of about 2.54 mm (0 1 inch) and use it to make a pouch for 1 4 phr rubber makers sulfur (Taber, Inc., Barrington, Rhode Island}, 1 7 phr N-tert-butyl-2-benzothiazole sulfenamide (Monsanto, St. Louis, Missouri), and 2 0 phr diphenylguanidine (Monsanto, St  Louis, Missouri).<br>
Allow approximately one hour between the completion of the second pass in the mixer and the beginning of the third pass<br>
Bring the temperature of the mixer to approximately 38°C.  With the cooling water running, commence the third pass by adding the strips of second pass stock to the mixer which is running at 116 rpm   Immediately thereafter add the pouch containing the sulfur, the N-tert-butyl-2-benzothiazole-sulfenamide, and the  diphenylguanidine  After a further<br><br>
15 seconds drop the rotor speed to 77 rpm.  After a further<br>
1 5 minutes raise the ram and sweep   Complete the third pass by<br>
mixing the stock for no more than an additional 3 5 minutes and<br>
dropping it just before the temperature exceeds 125°C; about<br>
2 5 minutes is typical.<br>
Milling Protocol<br>
Preheat a 2-roll rubber mill to approximately 60°C With the nip setting at 6 35 mm (0.25 inch) and while the mill is running, feed the stock from the third pass into the mill<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
Adjust the rolling bank if necessary to maintain uniform thickness   Perform eight side cuts, then eight end passes<br>
Adjust the nip setting to produce a sheet thickness of 2 032 mm ± 0 127 mm (0 080 inch ± 0.005 inch).  Sheet the stock off the mill and lay it flat on a clean surface.<br>
Using a stencil, cut a rectangular sample 101.6 mm X 76.2 mm (4 inches X 3 inches) from the stock and then store the sample between clean polyethylene sheets   Condition overnight at a temperature of 23°C ± 2°C and a relative humidity of 50% ± 5% Curing Protocol<br>
Place the conditioned sample in a 101.6 mm X76.2 mm X 1 524 mm (4 inch X 3 inch X 0.06 inch) standard frame machine steel mold plate compression mold having a coating of Teflon(r) polytetrafluoroethylene (E. I. duPont de Nemours &amp; Co , Wilmington, Delaware) from 0 0254 mm to 0.0508 mm (0.001 to 0.002 inch) thick, or equivalent, and cure in a 61 centimeter X 61 centimeter (24 inch X 24 inch) 890 kilonewton (100 ton) 4-post electrically heated compression press, or equivalent, for 20 minutes at 150°C under a pressure of 13.79 megapascals (2000 pounds per square inch)   Remove the resulting cured rubber sheet from the mold and allow it to rest overnight. Microtomy Protocol<br>
Use an RMC MT-6000-XL microtome equipped with a<br>
CR2000 cryogenic accessory (RMC Biotechnology Tool Inc., Tucson, Arizona) and a Micro Star LH grade, black, standard boat style diamond knife (Micro Star Technologies, Huntsville, Texas), or equivalent, for microtoming.  Mount a diamond cutting edge 6 to 10 mm long cut at an included angle of 45 degrees in the microtome cryo knife holder and set the microtome clearance angle to 4 degrees as specified on the bottom of the knife as received.<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
Set the specimen and diamond knife temperatures identically in the range of from -70°C to -40°C<br>
Cut a rough sample about 15 mm X about 15 mm from the cured rubber sheet   Place this rough sample in the microtome stainless steel flat specimen holder and securely tighten the sample down with an Allen wrench supplied with the microtome.  Using the specimen trimming block supplied with the microtome, the flat holder, and a razor blade, trim the specimen so that about 4 mm of the specimen protrudes from the face of the holder and trim the corners from the specimen so that the block face for microtoming is about 8 mm long.<br>
Position the holder in the cryo unit arm of the advance mechanism of the microtome so that the length of the block face is vertical. Cool to the specimen temperature set earlier.  Manually plane the block face using a dulled edge region of the diamond knife to create a smooth flat surface on the block face   Move the knife edge to use a clean virgin region of the diamond knife edge and plane a few thin sections from the block face.  Set the cutting stroke to 5 mm per minute and manually advance the block face to cut sections approximately 2 micrometers (µm) in thickness on a clean virgin area of the diamond knife edge by moving over to a new area of the same knife.<br>
Secure each section, as it first breaks over the edge of the diamond knife with a pair of biological-grade number 5 fine tipped normally open or normally self-closing straight tweezers (A. Dumont &amp; Fils, Switzerland; Structure Probe Inc , West Chester, Pennsylvania), or equivalent.  Hold each section at its corner as it starts to come off and gently pull the section away from the knife edge without breaking, cracking or stretching it throughout the cutting stroke to minimize the possibility of the section rolling up or compressing excessively against the edge of the knife.  Cut the sections dry, do not use<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
dimethylsulfoxide or xylenes to aid in cutting  At the end of the cutting stroke, draw the intact section gently with the tweezers onto a cryo-cooled Fisherbrand Superfast Plus glass microscope slide, size 25 mm X 75 mm X 1 mm, (Fisher Scientific Co , Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), or equivalent   The slide, which has previously been cleaned with optical lens tissue or equivalent, rests on the top of a custom cut U-shaped silicone rubber spacer that surrounds the knife boat on two sides and its back surface.  Place from eight to ten thin sections from a sample onto each glass slide and position them for convenient preparation during optical mounting   Remove the slide from the cryo chamber, place it in a microscope slide box to avoid excessive moisture contamination, and allow it to warm to room temperature. Section Preparation Protocol<br>
Coat the thin sections residing on the microscope slide with Cargille Series A nD =1.550 ± 0.0002 immersion oil (R. P. Cargille Laboratories, Inc., Cedar Grove, New Jersey), or equivalent   Tease the thin sections carefully using tweezers and/or pointed probes on the stage of a Nikon SMZ-UZoom 1:10 Stereo Microscope, or equivalent, equipped with A Nikon SMZ-U UW 10xA/24 binocular eyepiece assembly (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), or equivalent, at low magnification to remove folds, wrinkles and pleats, and to straighten the sections   Care must be taken not to tear the delicate thin sections during this manipulation process.  Align the straightened thin sections parallel to one another in groups of one to five (preferably four) for optimum spatial placement under an 18 mm diameter circular cover glass   Clean an 18 mm diameter, 0.13 mm to 0.17 mm thick circular microscope cover glass, (Fisher Scientific Co., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), or equivalent, with optical lens tissue or equivalent, and place it on a group of aligned sections.  Two or three groups of sections can be<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
accommodated on a microscope slide   Fold a Scotties(r) two-ply 23.3 cm X 18.2 cm (9.2 inch X 7.2 inch) facial tissue (Scott Paper Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), or equivalent, into the approximate size of a slide for use as a blotter.  Place the blotter over the cover glass protected sections on the microscope slide and apply a flat plate or microscope slide box over the blotter.  Manually apply a firm, gentle, uniformly steady, downward force to the plate or slide box and maintain the force for approximately 15 seconds.  Remove the flat plate or slide box and the blotter   Repeat the blotting procedure using a fresh surface of Scotties tissue or equivalent, but use less force Equipment and Software Selection Protocol<br>
Use the following equipment or equivalent for field selection   a Nikon Microphot FXA research optical microscope equipped with a phase contrast objective module fitted with a plan 20X/0.05 Ph2 phase objective, a Ph2 phase condenser lens (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), a system magnification of 1 25X , and an intermediate lens magnification of 1.25X; a Sony Trinitron PVM 1343MD Color Video Monitor (Sony Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), and a Sony CCD three-chip DXC-760MD Camera (Sony Corporation, Tokyo, Japan); a Macintosh Ilfx Computer with a Color SuperMac 43 cm (17 inch) monitor (Apple Corporation, Cupertino, California) and a Data Translations frame store card (Data Translations, Raleigh, North Carolina).  Use the following software or equivalent for capturing images and image analysis ColorKitTM software (Data Translations, Raleigh, NC), NIH Image software (National Institute of Health, Washington, DC), and Microsoft Excel software (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington). Field Selection Protocol<br>
Scan the microtomed sections having thicknesses in the range of from about 2 to about 3 µm that have been prepared<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
for phase contrast optical microscopic examination to eliminate from further consideration sections which contain major anomalies such as wrinkles, folds, waves, tears, and/or dirt particle populations.  Choose fields using blind longitudinal traverses and blind cross traverses of the microscope stage on each section  Use only fields exhibiting low relief (accuracy of white area measurement is enhanced by accepting only substantially flat fields; fields exhibiting variable high relief result in blurred, out of focus images due to the low depth of field which is characteristic of the optical microscope).  From at least two sections, capture a total of ten field images as PICT formatted files using the Colorkit software.  Save the PICT files to optical disk for computer assisted white area measurement. Image Analysis<br>
Videomicrograph files saved as PICT files may be opened directly using the Image software<br>
Upon opening a PICT file, an image appears as a<br>
raster of 640 pixels X 480 pixels on the monitor at a scale of 2.00 ± 0.06 linear pixels per micrometer of object distance. The actual value of the scale can be ascertained by projecting horizontally on the monitor an image of a stage micrometer having 10 µm per division, and marking a distance of 250 µm or greater of the displayed image.  Enter the actual distance marked into the software and allow the computer to calibrate the scale, also known as a calibration factor, in units of linear pixels/µm<br>
Analyze each selected field image individually<br>
Smooth the image to remove background noise. Threshold and edit the image manually to identify the white areas to be counted and to remove artifacts Convert the edited image to a binary image and save the binary image as a file.<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
From the Options menu, choose the area parameter and set the minimum number of pixels to be counted at 4.<br>
Analyze each binary image to produce a list of<br>
numbers, where each number is the area of an individual white<br>
area, and save the list.  Use the Microsoft Excel software to<br>
sum the numbers of the list to produce a total white area for the field.<br>
Find the percent white area for a field by dividing the total white area by the total area for one field and multiplying the quotient by one hundred.  Find the standard white area by taking the average of the white areas of the ten fields captured   Save all files to optical disk<br>
This concludes the standard protocol for determination of standard white area.<br>
As before stated, the amorphous precipitated silica of the invention is characterized by a standard white area less than 0.8 percent   Often the standard white area is less than 0.7 percent   In many instances the standard white area less than 0 6 percent   Frequently the standard white area less than 05 percent   A standard white area less than 0.45 percent<br>
The BET surface area of the amorphous precipitated silica of the present invention is in the range of from 100 to 300 m2/g  Often the BET surface area is in the range of from 125 to 250 m2/g  From 150 to 200 m2/g is preferred  As used in the present specification and claims, the BET surface area of the amorphous precipitated silica is the surface area determined by the (Brunauer, Emmett,-Teller (BET) method according_to__ ASTM C 819-77 using nitrogen as the adsorbate but modified by outgassing the system and the sample for one hour at 180 0C<br>
The CTAB surface area of the amorphous precipitated silica of the present invention is in the range of from 85 to 275 m2/g.  Often the CTAB surface area is in the range of from<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
120 to 185 m2/g   From 145 to 185 m2/g is preferred   As used in the present specification and claims, the CTAB surface area of the amorphous precipitated silica is the CTAB surface area determined in accordance the following procedure   Using a top loader balance, 11.0 grams of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, also known as CTAB and as hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, [CAS 57-09-0] is weighed to the nearest one-tenth milligram and the weight expressed in grams, C, is recorded  The weighed CTAB is dissolved in distilled water and diluted with distilled water to 2 liters in a volumetric flask to form a standard CTAB solution which is stored in the dark for at least 12 days before use   Using a top loader balance, 3 70 grams of Aerosol(r) OT sodium di (2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate [CAS 577-11-7] (American Cyanamid Co., Wayne, NJ) is weighed The weighed Aerosol(r) OT sodium di (2-ethylhexyl) sulf osuccmate is dissolved in distilled water and diluted with distilled water to 2 liters in a volumetric flask to form a standard Aerosol(r) OT solution which is stored xn the dark for at least 12 days before use.  The useful storage lives of the standard CTAB solution and the standard Aerosol(r) OT solution are two months after preparation  Using a pipette, 10 0 mL of the CTAB standard solution is transferred to a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask containing a stirring bar.  Next, 30 mL chloroform, 50 mL distilled water, 15 drops of 0.02% bromophenol blue aqueous indicator solution, and one drop of IN aqueous NaOH solution are added to the flask.  With vigorous stirring but minimal splashing, the contents of the Erlenmeyer flask are titrated with the standard Aerosol(r) OT solution from a 50 mL buret.  The titration is begun at a rapid drop rate (the stopcock is never wide open) down to about 25 to 30 mL and then more slowly, dropwise, to the end_j3OjJi£_which will occur at about 37.5 mL The approach to the end point is characterized first by a milky blue color throughout.  Then, as the end point is more closely<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
approached, the bottom chloroform layer becomes a more intense blue and the top aqueous layer takes on a lilac or purple hue. Immediately before the end point, the whole mixture becomes visibly clearer (i.e., less "milky") and the bottom layer is seen as a very intense blue.  Using a wash bottle, the inside of the flask is washed down with no more than 25 mL of distilled water  The stirrer speed is increased to resume vigorous mixing for efficient contacting of the two liquid phases   At least 10 seconds are allowed to elapse after each dropwise addition of titrant immediately prior to the endpoint Stirring is stopped frequently to allow the phases to separate so that the analyst can become familiar with these color changes and then vigorous stirring is resumed  At the end point the bottom phase loses all color and displays a colorless or milky white appearance while the top phase is intensely purple.  The procedure is performed at least two times and the average volume of standard Aerosol(r) OT solution used per titration, VI, is recorded.  A 200 mL wide mouth glass bottle is tared and approximately 0.500 gram of silica sample (in the as-received state, not dried) is placed in the bottle and weighed to the nearest 0 1 mg.  This silica sample weight, S, is recorded   One hundred milliliters of the standard CTAB solution is pipetted into the bottle and a stirring bar is carefully added  Using a 50 mL pipet, filling and delivering twice, is preferred as the liquid level is easier to control than with a 100 mL pipet.  A cap is screwed on the bottle and the contents are stirred gently for 15 minutes without pH adjustment.  A pH electrode is placed into the solution in the bottle and gentle stirring is resumed.  The pH is adjusted to between 9 0 and 9 5 using 1N aqueous NaOH added dropwise, approximately 5 drops of the 1N NaOH solution are required before the pH stabilizes between 9.0 and 9.5.  When the pH has been stabilized between 9.0 and 9 5, the top of the bottle is<br><br>
- 13 -<br>

Volume 60, No. 6 (June 1964), pages 102-106, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.  In fluid energy mills the solid particles are suspended in a gas stream and conveyed at high velocity in a circular or elliptical path.  Some reduction occurs when the particles strike or rub against the walls of the confining chamber, but most of the reduction is believed to be caused by interparticle attrition.<br>
The degrees of agitation used in the various steps of the invention may vary considerably.  The agitation employed during the addition of one or more reactants should be at least sufficient to provide a thorough dispersion of the reactants and reaction mixture so as to avoid more than trivial locally high concentrations of reactants and to ensure that silica deposition occurs substantially uniformly thereby avoiding gellation on the macro scale   The agitation employed during aging should be at least sufficient to avoid settling of solids to ensure that silica deposition occurs substantially uniformly throughout the mass of silica particles rather than preferentially on those particles at or near the top of a settled layer of particles<br><br>
