The invention relates to novel 2-(2-methylphenyl)-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrole derivatives, to a plurality of processes for their preparation and to their use as pesticides.<br>
Hitherto, only few substituted cyclic a,a'-diphenylimines are known: three 2,5-diphenyl-l-pyrrolines which are alkoxy-substituted in the 2-phenyl ring [5-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-phenyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrole and 5-(4-methoxy-phenyl)-2-phenyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrole from Chem. Ber. 96, 93 (1963) and the corresponding 4-propoxy compound from J. Prakt. Chem., Series 4, 1, 57 (1955)] and the 2,6-diphenyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydropyridine, which is not substituted any further [cf, for example, Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr. 1974, 258 and Chem. Ber. 116, 3931 (1983)].<br>
Nothing is known concerning their suitability for use as pesticides.<br>

The formula (VIII) provides a general definition of the aminoketone derivatives required for carrying out the process (A) a) according to the invention. In this formula, Ar preferably has those meanings which have already been mentioned in connection with the description of the cyclic imines of the formula (I) as being preferred. The aminoketone derivatives of the formula (VIII) are novel.<br>
Aminoketone derivatives of the formula (VIII) can be prepared, for example, by reacting BOC-protected lactams of the formula (IX) with metallated aromatics of the formula (X) at temperatures between 0°C and 80°C, in accordance with the following equation:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
In the formula (X), Met represents a monovalent metal radical such as Li, Mgl, MgBr or MgCl.<br>
Some metallated aromatics of the formula (X) are known, or they can be prepared by known methods, such as, for example, lithiation or Grignard reaction, from the corresponding aromatics or halogeno aromatics.<br>
Protected lactams of the formula (IX) are obtained, for example, by BOC-protecting lactams of the formula (XI) using customary methods, such as, for example, metallation with butyl lithium and reaction with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (cf., for example, T. W. Greene, P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd Ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York 1991).<br>
Lactams of the formula (XI) can be prepared starting, for example, with w-alkoxylactams of the formula (XII), by two methods. The co-alkoxylactams can be reacted with aromatics of the formula (XIII) in the presence of an acidic catalyst, such as, for example, sulphuric acid, acetic acid or aluminium chloride and, if appropriate, in the presence of a diluent, such as, for example, dichloromethane or acetonitrile, in accordance with the following equation:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Alternatively, they can be reacted with aryl Grignard compounds of the formula (XIV) in the presence of a diluent, such as, for example, tetrahydrofuran, in accordance with the following equation [cf. Org. Prep. Proced. Int. 25, 255 (1993)]:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
In formula (XII), R.22 represents methyl or ethyl. In the formula (XIV), Hal represents chlorine, bromine or iodine.<br>
The co-alkoxylactams of the formula (XII) are known, some of them are commercially available, and they can be prepared, for example, from the corresponding unsubstituted imides by cathodic or sodium borohydrite reduction, or from the unsubstituted lactams by anodic oxidation, in each case in the presence of methanol or ethanol (cf., for example, J. Org. Chem. 56, 1822 (1991); Synthesis 1980, 315).<br>

Reel. Trav. Chim. Pays-Bas 81, 788 (1962)]:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
(XV)<br><br>
The co-benzoylcarboxylic acids of the formula (XV) required for this purpose can be prepared, for example, by reacting the dicarboxylic anhydrides of the formula (XVI) with aromatics of the formula (XIII) in the presence of a Lewis acid, such as, for example, aluminium chloride, and, if appropriate, in the presence of a diluent, such as, for example, benzene, in accordance with the following equation [cf. Reel. Trav. Chim. Pays-Has 81, 788 (1962)]:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The anhydride (succinic anhydride) required for this purpose is commercially available.<br>
Starting from the lactams of the formula (XI), all process steps up to the preparation of the cyclic imines of the formula (I), including the cyclocondensation according to process A a), can also be carried out as a "one-pot reaction" (see Example 1-9 "One-pot variant").<br>
If Ar in the active compound of the formula (I) according to the invention as in the formula (I-b) shown above represents an optionally substituted biphenylyl, the corresponding biphenyl lactams of the formula (Xl-a) can be prepared in an advantageous variant of the process described here by reacting, similarly to the<br>
process (C) described above and below, certain phenyl lactams of the formula (XVII) with boronic acids of the formula (VI) in accordance with the following equation:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The phenyl lactams of the formula (XVII) in which X^ represents bromine or iodine are a subset of the compounds of the formula (XI) whose preparation is mentioned above. The phenyl lactams of the formula (XVII) in which X* represents trifluoromethanesulphonyl can be prepared analogously to the route described for process (C) from the corresponding compounds of the formula (XI) in which Ar is substituted by R.1 = hydroxyl.<br>
The formula (XVIII) provides a general definition of the nitroketones required for carrying out the process A) b). In this formula, Ar preferably has those meanings which have already been mentioned in connection with the description of the cyclic imines of the formula (I) as being preferred. The nitroketones of the formula (XVIII) are novel.<br>
Nitroketones of the formula (XVIII) can be prepared, for example, by condensing the oo-chloroalkyl phenyl ketone of the formula (XXI) in the presence of a diluent, such as, for example, methanol, ethanol, another lower aliphatic alcohol or else tetra-hydrofuran, and in the presence of an acid binder, such as, for example, sodium hydride or an alkali metal alkoxide, preferably of the corresponding alcohol which is used as diluent, in accordance with the following equation:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The to-chloroalkyl phenyl ketone of the formula (XXI) can be prepared in a known manner, such as, for example, by Friedel-Crafts acylation of toluene with 3-chloro-propionyl chloride.<br>
The nitromethyl benzenes of the formula (XIX) are known or can be prepared in a known manner, such as, for example, by side-chain nitration of corresponding toluenes, or by reacting corresponding benzyl halides with silver nitrite [cf., for example, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 77, 6269 (1955); J. Am. Chem. Soc 86, 2681 (1964); Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, volume 10/1, 46-57 (halogen substitution), volume E16, 145-154 (both methods)]. The toluenes or benzyl halides required for this purpose are generally known compounds of organic chemistry.<br>
The nitroketones of the formula (XVIII) can be prepared, for example, by Michael additions of nitromethylbenzenes of the formula (XIX) to phenyl vinyl ketone of the formula (XX) in the presence of a diluent, such as, for example, methanol, ethanol or another lower aliphatic alcohol, and in the presence of an acid binder, such as, for example, preferably an alkali metal alkoxide of the corresponding alcohol which is used as diluent, in accordance with the following equation (cf., for example, J. Prakt. Chem., Series 4, 1, 57 (1955); Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, volume 10/1, 199-206):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The phenyl vinyl ketone of the formula (XX) can be prepared, for example, by eliminating hydrogen chloride from p-chloropropiophenone of the formula (XXI), which can be obtained, for example, by Friedel-Crafts acylation of toluene (XXII) with 3-chloropropionyl chloride, said elimination being carried out in the presence of an acid binder, such as, for example, potassium acetate, and in the presence of a diluent, such as, for example, methanol, in accordance with the following equation [cf., for example, J. Prakt. Chem., Series 4,1, 57 (1955)]:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Toluene of the formula (XXII) is commercially available.<br>
The phenyl vinyl ketone of the formula (XX) can also be prepared by reacting O-methyl methyl-2-methyl-benzohydroxamate of the formula (XXIII) with vinyl magnesium bromide, in accordance with the following equation:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The O-methyl methyl-2-methyl-benzohydroxamate of the formula (XXIII) can be prepared by known methods, for example from the corresponding benzoic acid derivatives [cf, for example, Tetrahedron Lett. 22, 3815 (1981)].<br>
Since the phenyl vinyl ketone of the formula (XX) is sensitive, it is, in a preferred variant for preparing the nitroketones of the formula (XVIII), directly reacted further with nitromethylbenzenes of the formula (XIX).<br>
Nitroketones of the formula (XVIII) can also be prepared by adding, in accordance with the equation below, enamines of methyl phenyl ketones of the formula (XXVI) to a-nitrostyrenes of the formula (XXVII) and subjecting the reaction product to an acidic hydrolysis:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
In the formulae (XXIV), (XXV) and (XXVI), R23 and R24 together with the linking nitrogen atom represent a cyclic amino radical, such as, for example, 1-pyrrolidino, 1-piperidino or 4-morpholino.<br>
In most cases, the addition proceeds in a [4+2]-cycloaddition to give isolatable 1,2-oxazine -N-oxide derivatives of the formula (XXV), and it is, if appropriate, carried out in the presence of a non-polar diluent, such as, for example, diethyl ether, at, for example, from -80° to +20°C. For the hydrolysis, use is made, for example, of aqueous mineral acids, such as hydrochloric acid, if appropriate in the presence of methanol or ethanol [cf. for example, Helv. Chim. Acta 68, 162 (1985); Tetrahedron 45, 2099 (1989)]. In many cases, it is advantageous to open the ring first to give compounds of the formula (XXIV), by simply dissolving the 1,2-oxazine -N-oxide derivative in methanol or ethanol, since otherwise the undesirable Nef reaction, which gives the corresponding diketo compound, occurs as a competing reaction [cf, for example, Tetrahedron 45, 2099 (1989)].<br>
Some of the enamines of the formula (XXVI) are known, or they can be prepared, for example, from the correspondingly substituted acetophenones and the cyclic amines using standard methods (for example Org. Syntheses Vol. 58, 56, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York). Some of the acetophenones required for this purpose are commercially available or known, or they can be prepared by known methods of the chemistry of aromatics.<br>
Some of the nitrostyrenes of the formula (XXVII) are known, or they can be prepared, for example, by formylation of the nitromethylbenzenes of the formula (XIX) given above (cf, for example, Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, volume E16, 215).<br>
The formula (XXVIII) provides a general definition of the imines required for carrying out the process A) c). In this formula, Ar preferably has those meanings which have already been mentioned in connection with the description of the cyclic imines of the formula (I) as being preferred.<br>
The imines of the formula (XXVIII) can be prepared, for example, by carrying out Michael additions of A^-diphenylmethylenebenzylamines of the formula (XXIX) to<br>
the phenyl vinyl ketone of the formula (XX), in accordance with the following equation:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The addition is carried out in the presence of an acid binder and in the presence of a diluent, such as, for example, acetonitrile or dichloromethane, and, if appropriate, in the presence of a reaction auxiliary, for example at room temperature. A preferred acid binder is aqueous alkali, such as 50% strength aqueous sodium hydroxide solution in the presence of a phase-transfer catalyst, such as, for example, triethyl-benzylammonium chloride as reaction auxiliary [cf., for example, Synth. Commun.17, 211(1987)].<br>
The preparation of the phenyl vinyl ketone of the formula (XX) is described above. The W-diphenylmethylene benzylamines of the formula (XXIX) are obtained, for example, by reacting the corresponding benzylamines with benzophenone (cf. for example, Tetrahedron. Lett. 1978, 2641). The benzylamines required for this purpose are known, or they can be prepared by known methods, such as, for example, aminolysis of the corresponding benzyl halides (see above).<br>
The formula (III) provides a general definition of the cyclic 0-methanesulphonyl oximes required for carrying out the process (B) according to the invention. In this formula, Ar preferably has those meanings which have already been mentioned in connection with the description of the cyclic imines of the formula (I) as being preferred. The O-methanesulphonyl oximes of the formula (III) are novel.<br><br>
The 6&gt;-methylsulphonyl oximes of the formula (III) can be prepared by, for example according to the equation below, initially converting cyclic a-aryl ketones of the formula (XXXI) by generally known methods into their oximes of the formula (XXX) and subsequently reacting these with methanesulphonyl chloride, similarly to the mesylation of alcohols:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Cyclic a-aryl ketones of the formula (XXXI) can be prepared, for example, by epoxidizing 1-arylcycloalkenes of the formula (XXXIII) according to the equation below by customary methods, such as, for example, with m-chloroperbenzoic acid, to give oxirans of the formula (XXXII) and subsequently isomerizing these by acidic work-up [cf, for example, Tetrahedron 30, 2027 (1974)]:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
It is, of course, also possible to isomerize oxirans of the formula (XXXII) obtained by other routes to give cyclic a-aryl ketones of the formula (XXXI), for example by shaking a solution in chloroform with 20% strength sulphuric acid.<br>
1-Arylcycloalkenes of the formula (XXXIII) can be prepared, for example, by reacting according to the equation below the aryl Grignard compounds of the formula (XIV) described above with cyclobutanone of the formula (XXXV) under customary Grignard conditions and dehydrating the cyclic benzyl alcohols of the formula<br>
(XXXIV)	which have been obtained, for example, in this manner:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The dehydration can be carried out, for example, by dissolving the alcohol in a solvent of low polarity, such as hexane, and stirring with semi-concentrated sulphuric acid, for example at from 0°C to 20°C [cf, for example, Tetrahedron 30, 2027 (1974)].<br>
Cyclobutanone of the formula (XXXV) is commercially available.<br>
The formula (IV) provides a definition of the aryl Grignard compounds furthermore required for carrying out the process (B) according to the invention.<br>
Aryl Grignard compounds of the formula (IV) can be prepared from o-tolyl halides and magnesium by the Grignard reaction. o-Tolyl halides are generally known compounds of organic chemistry.<br>
The cyclic imines of the formula (V) required for carrying out the process (C) according to the invention are, if X^ represents bromine or iodine, a subset of the compounds of the general formula (I) according to the invention, and they can be prepared, for example, by the processes (A) and (B). If X^ represents trifluoromethanesulphonyl, the compounds of the formula (V-a) can be prepared by reacting hydroxyl compounds of the formula (I-f), which can also be prepared by the processes (A) and (B), with trifluoromethanesulphonyl chloride or trifluoro-methanesulphonic anhydride in the presence of an acid binder, such as, for example, pyridine, and, if appropriate, in the presence of a diluent, in accordance with the following equation:<br>

In this formula, R^, RlO, G, p, q and r each preferably have those meanings which have already been mentioned in connection with the description of the cyclic imines of the formula (I) as being preferred. Ab represents a customary leaving group, such as, for example, halogen, in particular chlorine or bromine; alkylsulphonyloxy, in particular methylsulphonyloxy; or optionally substituted arenesulphonyloxy, in particular phenylsulphonyloxy, p-chlorophenylsulphonyloxy or p-tolylsulphonyloxy.<br>

Particularly suitable is the acidolysis with trifluoroacetic acid, which is usually employed for cleaving off the tert-butoxycarbonyl amino protecting group (c.f., for example, T.W. Greene, P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd Ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York 1991).<br>

The active compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention are also suitable for controlling arthropods which attack agricultural livestock, such as, for example, cattle, sheep, goats, horses, pigs, donkeys, camels, buffalo, rabbits, chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, honey bees, other domestic animals, such as, for example, dogs, cats, caged birds, aquarium fish, and so-called experimental animals, such as, for example, hamsters, guinea-pigs, rats and mice. By controlling these arthropods, it is intended to reduce deaths and decreased performances (in meat, milk, wool, hides, eggs, honey and the like), so that more economical and simpler animal keeping is made possible by using the active compounds according to the invention.<br>
In the veterinary sector, the active compounds according to the invention are used in a known manner by enteral administration, for example in the form of tablets, capsules, drinks, drenches, granules, pastes, boluses, the feed-through method, suppositories, by parenteral administration, such as, for example, by means of injections (intramuscular, subcutaneous, intravenous, intraperitoneal and the like), implants, by nasal administration, by dermal administration, for example in the form of dipping or bathing, spraying, pouring-on and spotting-on, washing, dusting, and with the aid of shaped articles which comprise active compound, such as collars, ear tags, tail marks, limb bands, halters, marking devices and the like.<br>
When administered to livestock, poultry, domestic animals and the like, the active compounds of the formula (I) can be used as formulations (for example powders, emulsions, flowables) which comprise the active compounds in an amount of 1 to 80% by weight, either directly or after dilution by a factor of 100 to 10,000, or they may be used in the form of a chemical bath.<br><br>
Furthermore, it has been found that the compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention have a potent insecticidal action against insects which destroy industrial materials.<br>
The following insects may be mentioned by way of preferred examples but without any limitation:<br>

Bristletails, such as Lepisma saccharina.<br>
Industrial materials are to be understood as meaning, in the present context, non-live materials, such as, preferably, synthetic materials, glues, sizes, paper and board, leather, wood and timber products, and paint.<br><br>
The materials to be very particularly preferably protected against attack by insects are wood and timber products.<br>
Wood and timber products which can be protected by the composition according to the invention or mixtures comprising such a composition are to be understood as meaning, for example, construction timber, wooden beams, railway sleepers, bridge components, jetties, wooden vehicles, boxes, pallets, containers, telephone poles, wood lagging, windows and doors made of wood, plywood, particle board, joiner's articles, or wood products which, quite generally, are used in the construction of houses or in joinery.<br>
The active compounds can be used as such, in the form of concentrates or generally customary formulations, such as powders, granules, solutions, suspensions, emulsions or pastes.<br>
The formulations mentioned can be prepared in a manner known per se, for example by mixing the active compounds with at least one solvent or diluent, emulsifier, dispersant and/or binder or fixative, water repellent, if appropriate desiccants and UV stabilizers and, if appropriate, colorants and pigments and other processing auxiliaries.<br>
The insecticidal compositions or concentrates used for the protection of wood and wooden materials comprise the active compound according to the invention at a concentration of 0.0001 to 95% by weight, in particular 0.001 to 60% by weight.<br>
The amount of the compositions or concentrates employed depends on the species and the occurrence of the insects and on the medium. The optimum rate of application can be determined upon use in each case by test series. However, in general, it suffices to employ 0.0001 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.001 to 10% by weight, of the active compound, based on the material to be protected.<br><br>
The solvent and/or diluent used is an organochemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or an oily or oil-type organochemical solvent or solvent mixture of low volatility and/or a polar organochemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or water and, if appropriate, an emulsifier and/or wetting agent.<br>
Organochemical solvents which are preferably employed are oily or oil-like solvents having an evaporation number of above 35 and a flashpoint of above 30°C, preferably above 45°C. Substances which are used as such oily and oil-like solvents which have low volatility and are insoluble in water are suitable mineral oils or their aromatic fractions, or mineral-oil-containing solvent mixtures, preferably white spirit, petroleum and/or alkylbenzene.<br>
Substances which are advantageously used are mineral oils with a boiling range of 170 to 220°C, white spirit with a boiling range of 170 to 220°C, spindle oil with a boiling range of 250 to 350°C, petroleum or aromatics of boiling range 160 to 280°C, essence of turpentine and the like.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, liquid aliphatic hydrocarbons with a boiling range of 180 to 210°C or high-boiling mixtures of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons with a boiling range of 180 to 220°C and/or spindle oil and/or monochloronaphthalene, preferably monochloronaphthalene, are used.<br>
The organic oily or oil-like solvents of low volatility and having an evaporation number of above 35 and a flashpoint of above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, can be partially replaced by organochemical solvents of high or medium volatility, with the proviso that the solvent mixture also has an evaporation number of above 35 and a flashpoint of above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, and that the insecticide is soluble or emulsifiable in this solvent mixture.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, part of the organochemical solvent or solvent mixture is replaced by an aliphatic polar organochemical solvent or solvent mixture. Substances which are preferably used are aliphatic organochemical solvents having hydroxyl<br><br>
and/or ester and/or ether groups, such as, for example, glycol ether, esters and the like.<br>
The organochemical binders used within the scope of the present invention are the synthetic resins and/or binding drying oils which are known per se and can be diluted with water and/or are soluble or dispersible or emulsifiable in the organochemical solvents employed, in particular binders composed of, or comprising, an acrylate resin, a vinyl resin, for example polyvinyl acetate, polyester resin, polycondensation or polyaddition resin, polyurethane resin, alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin, phenol resin, hydrocarbon resin, such as indene/coumarone resin, silicone resin, drying vegetable and/or drying oils and/or physically drying binders based on a natural and/or synthetic resin.<br>
The artificial resin used as the binder can be employed in the form of an emulsion, dispersion or solution. Up to 10% by weight of bitumen or bituminous substances can also be used as binder. In addition, colorants, pigments, water repellents, odour-masking substances and inhibitors or anticorrosives known per se and the like can also be employed.<br>
The composition or the concentrate preferably comprises, in accordance with the invention, at least one alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin and/or a drying vegetable oil as the organochemical binder. Preferably used according to the invention are alkyd resins with an oil content of over 45% by weight, preferably 50 to 68% by weight.<br>
All or some of the abovementioned binder can be replaced by a fixative (mixture) or a plasticizer (mixture). These additives are intended to prevent volatilization of the active compounds and crystallization or precipitation. They preferably replace 0.01 to 30% of the binder (based on 100% of binder employed).<br>
The plasticizers are from the chemical classes of the phthalic esters, such as dibutyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate or benzylbutyl phthalate, the phosphoric esters, such as<br><br>
tributyl phosphate, the adipic esters, such as di-(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, the stearates, such as butyl stearate or amyl stearate, the oleates, such as butyl oleate, the glycerol ethers or relatively high-molecular-weight glycol ethers, glycerol esters and p-toluenesulphonic esters.<br>
Fixatives are chemically based on polyvinyl alkyl ethers, such as, for example, polyvinyl methyl ether, or ketones, such as benzophenone or ethylenebenzophenone.<br>
Particularly suitable as a solvent or diluent is also water, if appropriate as a mixture with one or more of the abovementioned organochemical solvents or diluents, emulsifiers and dispersants.<br>
Particularly effective protection of wood is achieved by large-scale industrial impregnation processes, for example vacuum, double-vacuum or pressure processes.<br>
If appropriate, the ready-to-use compositions can additionally comprise other insecticides and, if appropriate, additionally one or more fungicides.<br>
Suitable additional components which may be admixed are, preferably, the insecticides and fungicides mentioned in WO 94/29 268. The compounds mentioned in that document are expressly incorporated into the present application.<br>
Very particularly preferred components which may be admixed are insecticides, such as chlorpyrifos, phoxim, silafluofm, alphamethrin, cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, delta-methrin, permethrin, imidacloprid, NI-25, flufenoxuron, hexaflumuron and tri-flumuron, and fungicides, such as epoxyconazole, hexaconazole, azaconazole, propiconazole, tebuconazole, cyproconazole, metconazole, imazalil, dichlorfiuanid, tolylfluanid, 3-iodo-2-propinyl-butyl carbamate, N-octyl-isothiazolin-3-one and 4,5-dichloro-N-octylisothiazolin-3-one.<br><br>
