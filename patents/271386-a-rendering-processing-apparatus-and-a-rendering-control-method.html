				<td>DISPLAY CONTROLLER, GRAPHICS PROCESSOR, DRAWING PROCESSOR,<br>
AND DRAWING CONTROL METHOD<br>
[TECHNICAL FIELD]<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a rendering<br>
process technology and, more particularly, to a display<br>
controller, graphics processor, rendering processing<br>
apparatus, and rendering control method adapted to generate<br>
image data suitable for a display.<br>
[BACKGROUND ART]<br>
[0002] With the improvement in technology of<br>
manufacturing thin displays such as liquid crystal displays<br>
and reduction in prices, an extensive variety of display<br>
devices are currently available. A display device may<br>
display high-quality videos played back by a DVD player or<br>
moving images produced by computer graphics.<br>
[0003] To display image data output from a computer or a<br>
DVD player on a display device, there is needed a display<br>
controller having the capabilities for converting an image<br>
signal into a format compatible with the specification of the<br>
display device by converting the horizontal frequency or the<br>
vertical frequency of the image signal.<br>
[DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION]<br>
[PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION]<br>
[0004] The specification (e.g., frame rate and<br>
resolution) of an image signal that can be displayed differs<br><br>
depending on the type of the display device. The display<br>
controller converts an image signal in adaption to the<br>
specification of a display device to which the signal is<br>
output. The rate of the vertical synchronizing signal of the<br>
NTSC television system is 59.97 Hz and the rate of the<br>
vertical synchronizing signal of the PAL television system is<br>
50 Hz. Therefore, in order to display moving images provided<br>
in the NTSC format on a television of the PAL system, the<br>
frame rate of the moving images is converted to adapt to the<br>
PAL system.<br>
[0005] A rendering process assuming the NTSC system<br>
intrinsically produces frames of moving images at 59.97 Hz.<br>
Displaying the moving images on a display operated at a<br>
frequency different from the frequency of the rendering<br>
process will cause a problem and the quality of moving images<br>
as reproduced suffers.<br>
[0006] In this background, a general purpose of the<br>
present invention is to provide a rendering process<br>
technology for displaying moving images on a display device<br>
operated at a synchronization frequency different from the<br>
frequency of the rendering process.<br>
[MEANS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM]<br>
[0007] A display controller adapted to solve the<br>
aforementioned problem is operative to select one of a<br>
plurality of frame buffers, each of which is adapted to hold<br>
a frame of rendering data, by switching between the frame<br><br>
buffers according to a sequence, and to supply the rendering<br>
data read by scanning the selected frame buffer to a display,<br>
wherein the display controller switches between the frame<br>
buffers at a frequency different from a vertical<br>
synchronization frequency of the display. The frequency at<br>
which the display controller switches between the frame<br>
buffers may be a vertical synchronization frequency assumed<br>
by a graphics processor when generating the rendering data<br>
frame by frame. The display controller may receive from the<br>
graphics controller a buffer switching signal generated at<br>
the assumed vertical synchronization frequency and control<br>
the timing of switching between the frame buffers according<br>
to the buffer switching signal.<br>
[0008] Another aspect of the present invention relates<br>
to a graphics processor. The graphics processor is adapted<br>
for a display controller operative to select one of a<br>
plurality of frame buffers, each of which is adapted to hold<br>
a frame of rendering data, by switching between the frame<br>
buffers according to a sequence, and to supply the rendering<br>
data read by scanning the selected frame buffer to a display,<br>
wherein the graphics processor supplies a buffer switching<br>
signal for timing the switching between the frame buffers and<br>
generates the buffer switching signal at a vertical<br>
synchronization frequency assumed by the graphics processor<br>
when generating the rendering data frame by frame.<br>
[0009] Still another aspect of the present invention<br><br>
relates to a rendering processing apparatus. The apparatus<br>
comprises: a plurality of frame buffers each of which is<br>
operative to hold a frame of rendering data; a rendering<br>
processing unit operative to select a frame buffer in which<br>
to write the rendering data, by switching between the<br>
plurality of frame buffers according to a sequence, and to<br>
generate the rendering data in the selected frame buffer in<br>
which to write; a display controller operative to select a<br>
frame buffer from which to read rendering data by switching<br>
between the plurality of buffers according to a sequence, and<br>
to supply to a display the rendering data read by scanning<br>
the selected frame buffer from which to read; and a switching<br>
signal generating unit operative to generate a buffer<br>
switching signal directing the display controller to switch<br>
the frame buffer from which to read. The switching signal<br>
generating unit generates the buffer switching signal at a<br>
frequency different from a vertical synchronization frequency<br>
of the display.<br>
[0010] Yet another aspect of the present invention<br>
relates to a rendering processing apparatus. The apparatus<br>
comprises: a plurality of frame buffers each of which is<br>
operative to hold a frame of rendering data; a rendering<br>
processing unit operative to select a frame buffer in which<br>
to write the rendering data, by switching between the<br>
plurality of frame buffers according to a sequence, and to<br>
generate the rendering data in the selected frame buffer in<br><br>
which to write; a display controller operative to select a<br>
frame buffer from which to read rendering data by switching<br>
between the plurality of buffers according to a sequence, and<br>
to supply to a display the rendering data read by scanning<br>
the selected frame buffer from which to read; and a switching<br>
signal generating unit operative to generate a buffer<br>
switching signal directing the display controller to switch<br>
the frame buffer from which to read. The switching signal<br>
generating unit determines whether a vertical synchronization<br>
frequency assumed by the rendering processing unit when<br>
generating the rendering data frame by frame matches an<br>
actual vertical synchronization frequency of the display,<br>
generates, when the frequencies do not match, the buffer<br>
switching signal at the assumed vertical synchronization<br>
frequency, and generates, when the frequencies match, the<br>
buffer switching signal at the actual vertical<br>
synchronization frequency of the display.<br>
[0011] Yet another aspect of the present invention<br>
relates to a rendering control method. The method is adapted<br>
for a display controller operative to select one of a<br>
plurality of frame buffers, each of which is adapted to hold<br>
a frame of rendering data, by switching between the frame<br>
buffers according to a sequence, and to supply the rendering<br>
data read by scanning the selected frame buffer to a display,<br>
wherein the timing of switching the frame buffer scanned by<br>
the display controller is controlled in accordance with a<br><br>
buffer switching signal generated at a frequency different<br>
from a vertical synchronization frequency of the display.<br>
[0012] Optional combinations of the aforementioned<br>
constituting elements, and implementations of the invention<br>
in the form of methods, apparatuses, systems, computer<br>
programs, data structures, and recording mediums may also be<br>
practiced as additional modes of the present invention.<br>
[ADVANTAGE OF THE PRESENT INVENTION]<br>
[0013] The present invention is readily applicable to a<br>
display device operated at a different synchronization<br>
frequency.<br>

[0015] 10 main processor, 20 main memory, 30 graphics<br>
processor 32 rendering processing unit, 36 switching signal<br><br>
generating unit, 40 local memory, 44 frame buffer, 50 display<br>

[BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION]<br>
[0016] Fig. 1 shows the structure of a rendering<br>
processing apparatus 100 according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention. The rendering processing apparatus 100<br>
performs a rendering process for generating rendering data to<br>
be displayed on a screen, based on three-dimensional model<br>
information of an object to be rendered (hereinafter, simply<br>
referred to as "an object"). The figure is a block diagram<br>
depicting the respective functions. The functional blocks<br>
may be implemented in a variety of manners by hardware only,<br>
software only, or a combination thereof.<br>
[0017] The rendering processing apparatus 100 includes a<br>
main processor 10, a main memory 20, a graphics processor 30,<br>
a local memory 40, a display controller 50, a display 60, and<br>
a communication unit 80. These components are connected to a<br>
bus (not shown).<br>
[0018] The main memory 20 is a storage primarily used by<br>
the main processor 10 and stores vertex data and control<br>
parameters of an object.<br>
[0019] The main processor 10 performs geometry<br>
processing for an object and generates a rendering command<br>
directing the graphics processor 30 to render an object,<br>
[0020] The local memory 40 is a storaae area primarily<br><br>
used by the graphics processor 30 and stores a shader program<br>
for executing a rendering algorithm, a texture to be mapped<br>
onto the surface of an object, etc. A frame buffer to hold<br>
intermediate and final results of rendering is provided in<br>
the local memory 40.<br>
[0021] The graphics processor 30 renders an object so as<br>
to generate rendering data and stores the rendering data in<br>
the local memory 40. The graphics processor 30 includes a<br>
rendering processing unit 32 and a switching signal<br>
generating unit 36.<br>
[0022] The rendering processing unit 32 performs<br>
arithmetic operations to render an object such as shading,<br>
texture mapping, etc. in accordance with the rendering<br>
command provided by the main processor 10. The unit 32<br>
writes the rendering data in a frame buffer 44 in the local<br>
memory 40. The rendering processing unit 32 includes<br>
functional blocks such as a rasterizer, a shader unit, a<br>
texture unit, etc. (not shown).<br>
[0023] The frame buffer 44 is configured as a<br>
multibuffer such as a double buffer or a triple buffer so<br>
that operations for writing and reading rendering data can be<br>
performed independently. Rendering data for a subsequent<br>
frame is written in a buffer separate from the buffer being<br>
read by the display controller 50. The display controller 50<br>
switches between multiple buffers in the frame buffer 44<br>
according to a sequence in synchronization with an actual<br><br>
vertical synchronization frequency (also called "a refresh<br>
rate") of the display 60 or a vertical synchronization<br>
frequency assumed by the graphics processor 30, and scans the<br>
selected buffer accordingly.<br>
[0024] The display controller 50 generates a vertical<br>
synchronizing signal (VSYNC) in accordance with the vertical<br>
synchronization frequency of the display 60 and supplies the<br>
signal to the switching signal generating unit 36 of the<br>
graphics processor 30.<br>
[0025] The switching signal generating unit 36 is<br>
supplied with the vertical synchronizing signal of the<br>
display 60 from the display controller 50 so as to generate a<br>
buffer switching signal directing switching between buffers<br>
in the frame buffer 44 formed as a multibuffer and to supply<br>
the signal to the display controller 50.<br>
[0026] The switching signal generating unit 36<br>
determines whether the actual vertical synchronization<br>
frequency of the display 60 matches the vertical<br>
synchronization frequency assumed by the graphics processor<br>
30 when generating rendering data frame by frame. When the<br>
frequencies match, the unit 36 generates a buffer switching<br>
signal at the actual vertical synchronization frequency of<br>
the display 60. When the actual vertical synchronization<br>
frequency of the display 60 differs from the vertical<br>
synchronization frequency assumed by the graphics processor<br>
30 the switching signal generating unit 36 generates a<br><br>
buffer switching signal at the vertical synchronization<br>
frequency assumed by the graphics processor 30 instead of the<br>
actual vertical synchronization frequency of the display 60.<br>
[0027] The display controller 50 is timed by a buffer<br>
switching signal supplied from the switching signal<br>
generating unit 36 to switchably select the buffer in the<br>
frame buffer 44 formed as a multibuffer. The controller 50<br>
scans the selected buffer so as to read out the rendering<br>
data.<br>
[0028] The operation of scanning the frame buffer 44 by<br>
the display controller 50 will be described in further<br>
detail. The display controller 50 sequentially reads pixel<br>
data of rendering data line by line from the frame buffer 44.<br>
In other words, the display controller 50 scans the frame<br>
buffer 44 horizontally, starting at the pixel at the top left<br>
corner, so as to read out pixel data of the first row. The<br>
controller 50 then moves up or down by one pixel and reads<br>
pixels in the subsequent row. When the pixel array in the<br>
bottom row has been scanned, the controller 50 starts a<br>
similar scan from the pixel array in the topmost row again.<br>
[0029] Since the frame buffer 44 is formed as a<br>
multibuffer, the switching signal generating unit 36 supplies<br>
a buffer switching signal to the display controller 50 at the<br>
actual vertical synchronization frequency of the display 60<br>
or the vertical synchronization frequency assumed by the<br>
graphics processor 30. so as to control the display<br><br>
controller 50 to switch the frame buffer from which to scan<br>
rendering data. The display controller 50 is timed by a<br>
switching signal from the switching signal generating unit 36<br>
to suspend the operation of reading the pixel array from the<br>
first frame buffer that had been scanned. The controller 50<br>
switches from the first buffer to the second buffer and reads<br>
out the next pixel array from the second frame buffer.<br>
[0030] The display controller 50 converts image data for<br>
display comprising RGB color values and read from the frame<br>
buffer 44 into an image signal of a format compatible with<br>
the display 60. The controller 50 supplies the converted<br>
signal to the display 60.<br>
[0031] The graphics processor 30 and the main processor<br>
10 are connected via an input and output interface (not<br>
shown). The graphics processor 30 is capable of accessing<br>
the main memory 20 via the input and output interface. The<br>
main processor 10 is capable of accessing the local memory 40<br>
via the input and output interface.<br>
[0032] The communication unit 80 is capable of<br>
transmitting and receiving data over a network in accordance<br>
with an instruction from the main processor 10. The data<br>
transmitted and received by the communication unit 80 is held<br>
in the main memory 20.<br>
[0033] Fig. 2 is a diagram depicting a buffer switching<br>
signal generated by the switching signal generating unit 36.<br>
to the illustrated syample the frame buffer 44 is formed as<br><br>
a double buffer and includes a first frame buffer 44a and a<br>
second frame buffer 44b. A switcher 74 at the input of the<br>
frame buffer 44 selects a frame buffer (i.e., the first frame<br>
buffer 44a or the second frame buffer 44b) in which to write<br>
rendering data by the rendering processing unit 32.<br>
[0034] When the operation of writing rendering data for<br>
one frame in the selected frame buffer is completed, the<br>
switcher 74 at the input switches to the other frame buffer<br>
in which to write rendering data by the rendering processing<br>
unit 32. This causes the rendering data for the subsequent<br>
frame to be written in the other frame buffer.<br>
[0035] A switcher 76 at the output of the frame buffer<br>
44 selects a frame buffer (i.e., the first frame buffer 44a<br>
or the second frame buffer 44b) from which the display<br>
controller 50 reads image data.<br>
[0036] The display controller 50 supplies the vertical<br>
synchronizing signal to the switching signal generating unit<br>
36. The switching signal generating unit 36 generates a<br>
buffer switching signal for switching the frame buffer and<br>
supplies the signal to the switcher 44 at the input of the<br>
frame buffer 44 and the switcher 76 at the output thereof.<br>
[0037] The switcher 74 at the input of the frame buffer<br>
44 switches rendering data is to be written by the rendering<br>
processing unit 32 from the current frame buffer in which the<br>
data is currently written to the other buffer, in accordance<br>
with a buffer switching signal from the switching signal<br><br>
generating unit 36.<br>
[0038] The switcher 76 at the output of the frame buffer<br>
44 switches from the frame buffer from which the data is<br>
currently read to the other frame buffer for selection of the<br>
buffer from which to read data by the display controller 50,<br>
in accordance with a buffer switching signal from the<br>
switching signal generating unit 36. Subsequent scanning by<br>
the display controller 50 is performed in the other frame<br>
buffer.<br>
[0039] When the vertical synchronization frequency<br>
assumed by the graphics processor 30 does not match the<br>
actual vertical synchronization frequency of the display 60,<br>
the switching signal generating unit 36 generates a buffer<br>
switching signal at the vertical synchronization frequency<br>
assumed by the graphics processor 30. The buffer switching<br>
signal generated at the vertical synchronization frequency<br>
assumed by the graphics processor 30 will be referred to as<br>
"a dummy vertical synchronizing signal (a dummy VSYNC)". The<br>
vertical synchronizing signal generated by the display<br>
controller 50 at the vertical synchronization frequency of<br>
the display 60 will be referred to as "an original vertical<br>
synchronizing signal (original VSYNC)".<br>
[0040] For example, it will be assumed that the vertical<br>
synchronization frequency of the display 60 is 50 Hz and the<br>
vertical synchronization signal assumed by the graphics<br>
processor 30 is 60 Hz. The display controller 50 supplies<br><br>
the original vertical synchronizing signal to the switching<br>
signal generating unit 36 at 50 Hz, the vertical<br>
synchronization frequency of the display 60. However, the<br>
switching signal generating unit 36 generates a dummy<br>
vertical synchronizing signal at 60 Hz, the vertical<br>
synchronization frequency assumed by the graphics processor<br>
30. With this, the rendering processing unit 32 creates<br>
rendering data for one frame in the frame buffer, by<br>
switching between the first frame buffer 44a and the second<br>
frame buffer 44b, timed by the dummy vertical synchronizing<br>
signal, i.e., at every 1/60 second. The display controller<br>
50 also switches between the first frame buffer 44a and the<br>
second frame buffer 44b, timed by the dummy vertical<br>
synchronizing signal, i.e., at every 1/60 second, and refers<br>
to the selected buffer.<br>
[0041] It should be noted that the display controller 50<br>
merely switches between the first frame buffer 44a and the<br>
second frame buffer 44b to select the buffer from which to<br>
read rendering data at the vertical synchronization frequency<br>
of 60 Hz assumed by the graphics processor 30 and that the<br>
controller 50 scans a screen data for the display 60 at the<br>
actual vertical synchronization frequency of 50 Hz of the<br>
display 60. In other words, the display controller 50 reads<br>
rendering data by switching between frame buffers from which<br>
to read every 1/60 second, in accordance with the vertical<br>
synchronization frequency assumed by the graphics processor<br><br>
30 and supplies rendering data for one frame to the display<br>
60 every 1/50 second, in accordance with the actual vertical<br>
synchronization frequency of the display 60.<br>
[0042] A description will now be given of display<br>
control by the rendering processing apparatus 100 having the<br>
aforementioned structure. A description will be given, with<br>
reference to Figs. 3A-3C, of a display control operation<br>
performed when the actual vertical synchronization frequency<br>
of the display 60 and the vertical synchronization frequency<br>
assumed by the graphics processor 30 match. A description<br>
will then be given, with reference to Figs. 4A-4D, of a<br>
display control operation performed when the actual vertical<br>
synchronization frequency of the display 60 and the vertical<br>
synchronization frequency assumed by the graphics processor<br>
30 do not match.<br>
[0043] Reference is made to Fig. 3A. The switching<br>
signal generating unit 36 is supplied with the original<br>
vertical synchronizing signal from the display controller 50.<br>
Since the actual vertical synchronization frequency of the<br>
display 60 and the vertical synchronization frequency assumed<br>
by the graphics processor 30 match, the switching signal<br>
generating unit 36 generates a buffer switching signal at the<br>
vertical synchronization frequency of the display 60 and<br>
supplies the signal to the switcher 74 at the input of the<br>
frame buffer 44 and the switcher 76 at the output.<br>
[0044]	In response to the buffer switching signal, the<br><br>
display controller 50 switches to first frame buffer 44a for<br>
selection of the buffer from which to read. The controller<br>
50 reads out a frame image (referred to as "the first frame<br>
image") held in the first frame buffer 44a from the first<br>
line through the last line and displays the image on the<br>
display 60. Meanwhile, the rendering processing unit 32<br>
switches to the second buffer 44b for selection of the buffer<br>
in which to write. The unit 32 writes the second frame image<br>
in the second frame buffer 44b while the display controller<br>
50 is reading the frame image from the first frame buffer<br>
44a.<br>
[0045] Fig. 3B shows the operation performed when the<br>
buffer switching signal is generated for a second time. The<br>
switching signal generating unit 36 supplies the second<br>
buffer switching signal to the switcher 74 at the input of<br>
the frame buffer 44 and the switcher 76 at the output so as<br>
to switch the path for input and output through the frame<br>
buffer 44.<br>
[0046] In response to the switching operation responsive<br>
to the second buffer switching signal, the display controller<br>
50 reads the second frame image held in the second frame<br>
buffer 44b from the first line through the last line and<br>
displays the image on the display 60. Meanwhile, the<br>
rendering processing unit 32 writes the third frame image in<br>
the first frame buffer 44a while the display controller 50 is<br>
reading the second frame image from the second frame buffer<br><br>
44b.<br>
[0047] Fig. 3C shows the operation performed when the<br>
buffer switching signal is generated for a third time. The<br>
switching signal generating unit 36 supplies the third buffer<br>
switching signal to the switcher 74 at the input of the frame<br>
buffer 44 and the switcher 76 at the output so as to switch<br>
the path for input and output through the frame buffer 44.<br>
[0048] In response to the switching operation responsive<br>
to the third buffer switching signal, the display controller<br>
50 reads the third frame image held in the first frame buffer<br>
44a from the first line through the last line and displays<br>
the image on the display 60. Meanwhile, the rendering<br>
processing unit 32 writes the fourth frame image in the<br>
second frame buffer 44b while the display controller 50 is<br>
reading the third frame image from the first frame buffer<br>
44a.<br>
[0049] As shown in Figs. 3A-3C, if the frame rate<br>
assumed by the graphics processor 30 in the rendering<br>
operation matches the refresh rate of the display 60, the<br>
switching signal generating unit 36 may generate a buffer<br>
switching signal at the vertical synchronization frequency<br>
supplied from the display controller 50 so as to switch the<br>
path of input and output through the frame buffer 44.<br>
[0050] A description will be given, with reference to<br>
Figs. 4A-4D, of a method of switching the path for input and<br>
output through the frame buffer 44 when the frame rate<br><br>
assumed by the graphics processor 30 in the rendering<br>
operation and the refresh rate of the display 60 do not<br>
match.<br>
[0051] The switching signal generating unit 36 is<br>
supplied with the original vertical synchronizing signal from<br>
the display controller 50. Since the vertical<br>
synchronization frequency of the display 60 and the vertical<br>
synchronization frequency assumed by the graphics processor<br>
30 do not match, the switching signal generating unit 36<br>
generates a dummy vertical synchronizing signal at the<br>
vertical synchronization frequency assumed by the graphics<br>
processor 30 and supplies the signal to the switcher 74 at<br>
the input of the frame buffer 44 and the switcher 76 at the<br>
output.<br>
[0052] Fig. 4A shows an operation performed after the<br>
first dummy vertical synchronizing signal is supplied from<br>
the switching signal generating unit 36 until the second<br>
dummy vertical synchronizing signal is supplied. The display<br>
controller 50 scans the first line of the first frame image<br>
held in the first frame buffer 44a and proceeds sequentially<br>
so as to display the image on the display 60. The dots<br>
(numeral 200) indicate a scan line scanned immediately before<br>
the second dummy vertical synchronizing signal is supplied<br>
from the switching signal generating unit 36. Since the<br>
buffer from which to read is switched at the scan line, the<br>
scan line will be referred to as "a buffer swithching line".<br><br>
[0053] The display 60 displays an area (the portion<br>
indicated by A in the figure) between the first line and the<br>
first buffer switching line 200 of the first frame image held<br>
in the first frame buffer 44a. Meanwhile, the rendering<br>
processing unit 32 writes the second frame image in the<br>
second frame buffer 44b while the display controller 50 is<br>
reading the first frame image from the first frame buffer<br>
44a.<br>
[0054] Since the actual vertical synchronization<br>
frequency of the display 60 (e.g., 50 Hz) and the vertical<br>
synchronization frequency assumed by the graphics processor<br>
30 (e.g., 60 Hz) do not match, the switching signal<br>
generating unit 36 generates a dummy vertical synchronizing<br>
signal when the first frame buffer 44a has been scanned as<br>
far as the buffer switching line 200 of the frame image.<br>
[0055] Fig. 4B shows an operation performed after the<br>
second dummy vertical synchronizing signal is generated from<br>
the switching signal generating unit 36. As a result of the<br>
dummy vertical synchronizing signal being supplied from the<br>
switching signal generating unit 36 to the switchers 74 and<br>
76, the buffer to be read by the display controller 50 is<br>
switched to the second frame buffer 44b and the buffer in<br>
which to write data by the rendering processing unit 32 is<br>
switched to the first buffer 44a.<br>
[0056] The display controller 50 scans an area (the<br>
portion indicated by B1 in the figure) between the buffer<br><br>
switching line 200 and the last line of the second frame<br>
image held in the second frame buffer 44b and displays the<br>
image on the display 60. Meanwhile, the rendering processing<br>
unit 32 writes the third frame image in the first frame<br>
buffer 44a while the display controller 50 is reading the<br>
frame image from the second frame buffer 44b.<br>
[0057] The point of time at which the second frame image<br>
held in the second frame buffer 44b has been scanned as far<br>
as the last line and the display 60 has displayed the last<br>
line of the screen concurs with the generation of the<br>
original vertical synchronizing signal by the display<br>
controller 50.<br>
[0058] Fig. 4C shows an operation performed after the<br>
original vertical synchronizing signal is generated by the<br>
display controller 50.<br>
[0059] When the display controller has scanned the<br>
second frame image held in the second frame buffer 44b as far<br>
as the last line, the controller 50 returns to the first line<br>
of the second frame image and starts scanning the image.<br>
[0060] The display controller 50 starts scanning the<br>
first line of the second frame image held in the second frame<br>
buffer 44b and proceeds sequentially so as to display the<br>
image on the display 60. It is assumed that the third dummy<br>
vertical synchronizing signal is generated by the switching<br>
signal generating unit 36 when the second frame image has<br>
been scanned as far as the dotted line (numeral 202) (second<br><br>
buffer switching line).<br>
[0061] Fig. 4D shows an operation performed after the<br>
third dummy vertical synchronizing signal is generated by the<br>
switching signal generating unit 36. The third dummy<br>
vertical synchronizing signal causes the buffer to be read by<br>
the display controller 50 to be switched to the first frame<br>
buffer 44a and causes the buffer in which to write data by<br>
the rendering processing unit 32 to be switched to the second<br>
frame buffer 44b.<br>
[0062] The display controller 50 scans an area (the<br>
portion indicated by C in the figure) between the second<br>
buffer switching line 202 and the third buffer switching line<br>
204 of the third frame image held in the first frame buffer<br>
44a and displays the image on the display 60. Meanwhile, the<br>
rendering processing unit 32 writes the fourth frame image in<br>
the second frame buffer 44b while the display controller 50<br>
is reading the frame image from the first frame buffer 44a.<br>
[0063] Fig. 5 is a sequence diagram depicting display<br>
control operations shown in Figs. 4A-4D. It is assumed in<br>
the illustration that the actual vertical synchronization<br>
frequency of the display 60 is 50 Hz and the vertical<br>
synchronization frequency assumed by the graphics processor<br>
30 is 60 Hz.<br>
[0064] The dummy vertical synchronizing signal at 60 Hz<br>
and the original vertical synchronizing signal at 50 Hz are<br>
illustrated using the horizontal axis to indicate time. At<br><br>
time t0, tl, t2, t3, and t4, the zeroth through fourth dummy<br>
vertical synchronizing signals are generated. At time Tl and<br>
T2, the first and second original vertical synchronizing<br>
signals are generated. It is assumed that time tl, at which<br>
the first dummy vertical synchronizing signal is generated,<br>
and time Tl, at which the original vertical synchronizing<br>
signal is generated, coincide.<br>
[0065] The rendering processing unit 32 writes the first<br>
through fourth frame images, by switching between the first<br>
frame buffer 44a and the second frame buffer 44b in<br>
accordance with the dummy vertical synchronizing signal at 60<br>
Hz. The display controller 50 reads rendering data by<br>
switching from the first frame buffer 44a or the second frame<br>
buffer 44, switching between the buffers in concurrence with<br>
the generation of the dummy vertical synchronizing signal at<br>
60 Hz. For example, the controller 50 reads out rendering<br>
data from the first frame buffer 44a in an interval between<br>
tl and t2. At time t2, the controller 50 switches to the<br>
second frame buffer 44b. In an interval between t2 and t3,<br>
the controller 50 reads out rendering data from the second<br>
frame buffer 44b.<br>
[0066] Before the display controller 50 scans the data<br>
as far as the last line of the screen, the frame buffer from<br>
which to read is switched in concurrence with the generation<br>
of the dummy vertical synchronizing signal. Referring to<br>
Fig 5 the buffer from which to read is switched from the<br><br>
first buffer 44a to the second buffer 44b at time t2. At<br>
time t3, the buffer from which to read is switched from the<br>
second buffer 44b to the first buffer 44a. The display<br>
controller 50 completes scanning the last line of the screen<br>
in concurrence with the generation of the original vertical<br>
synchronizing signal, switches the screen, returns to the<br>
first line for scanning. Referring to Fig. 5, at time T2,<br>
the controller reaches the last line of the screen, switches<br>
the screen, scans the first line, and proceeds as previously.<br>
[0067] An interval between time tl, at which the first<br>
dummy vertical synchronizing signal is generated, and time<br>
t2, at which the second dummy vertical synchronizing signal<br>
is generated, is represented by Fig. 4A. Data for the area A<br>
of the first frame image is read by the display controller 50<br>
from the first frame buffer 44a and displayed in an area of<br>
the display 60 between the first line and the buffer<br>
switching line. At time t2, at which the second dummy<br>
vertical synchronizing signal is generated, the frame buffer<br>
from which to read is switched from the first frame buffer<br>
44a to the second frame buffer 44b.<br>
[0068] An interval between time t2, at which the second<br>
dummy vertical synchronizing signal is generated, and time<br>
T2, at which the second original vertical synchronizing<br>
signal is generated, is represented by Fig. 4B. Data for the<br>
area Bl of the second frame image is read by the display<br>
controller 50 from the second frame buffer 44b and displayed<br><br>
in an area of the display 60 between the previous buffer<br>
switching line and the last line. At time T2, at which the<br>
second original vertical synchronizing signal is generated,<br>
the screen of the display 60 is switched so that scanning<br>
starts at the first line.<br>
[0069] An interval between time T2, at which the second<br>
original vertical synchronizing signal is generated, and time<br>
t3, at which the third dummy vertical synchronizing signal is<br>
generated, is represented by Fig. 4C. Data for the area B2<br>
of the second frame image is read by the display controller<br>
50 from the second frame buffer 44b and displayed in an area<br>
of the display 60 between the first line and the buffer<br>
switching line. At time t3, at which the third dummy<br>
vertical synchronizing signal is generated, the frame buffer<br>
from which to read is switched from the second frame buffer<br>
44b to the first frame buffer 44a.<br>
[0070] An interval between time t3, at which the third<br>
dummy vertical synchronizing signal is generated, and time<br>
t4, at which the fourth dummy vertical synchronizing signal<br>
is generated, is represented by Fig. 4D. Data for the area C<br>
of the third frame image is read by the display controller 50<br>
from the first frame buffer 44a and displayed in an area of<br>
the display 60 between the previous buffer switching line and<br>
the next buffer switching line.<br>
[0071] As shown in Fig. 5, according to the embodiment,<br>
the display controller 50 switches the frame buffer form<br><br>
which to read rendering data at the vertical synchronization<br>
frequency assumed by the graphics processor 30 in the<br>
rendering operation instead of the actual vertical<br>
synchronization frequency of the display 60. In this way,<br>
moving images can be displayed on the display 60 without<br>
disregarding the frame rate of moving images produced by the<br>
graphics processor 30 operated at a frequency different from<br>
the vertical synchronization frequency of the display 60.<br>
Occurrence of unnaturally reproduced moving images associated<br>
with frequency conversion is minimized.<br>
[0072] The graphics processor 30 need not change the<br>
frame rate for rendering in adaptation to the vertical<br>
synchronization frequency of the display 60. The graphics<br>
processor 30 may perform a rendering operation by assuming a<br>
standard vertical synchronization frequency. This also<br>
eliminates the need for a converter for converting into the<br>
vertical synchronization frequency of the display 60.<br>
[0073] Fig. 6 depicts how the embodiment is applied to<br>
high frame rate rendering. The rendering processing unit 32<br>
generates rendering data at a high frame rate of 240 Hz. The<br>
display 60 has a vertical synchronization frequency of 60 Hz.<br>
The switching signal generating unit 36 is supplied with the<br>
original vertical synchronizing signal at 60 Hz from the<br>
display controller 50 and supplies the dummy vertical<br>
synchronizing signal at 240 Hz to the switchers 74 and 76.<br>
[0074] The rendering processing unit 32 switches between<br><br>
four frame buffers 44a-44d at 240 Hz according to a sequence<br>
so as to write rendering data for one frame in each of the<br>
frame buffers 44a-44d.<br>
[0075] The display controller 50 reads rendering data A<br>
between the first line and the first buffer switching line<br>
210 in the first frame buffer 44a, rendering data B between<br>
the first switching line 210 and the second buffer switching<br>
line 212 in the second frame buffer 44b, rendering data C<br>
between the second buffer switching line 212 and the third<br>
buffer switching line 214 in the third frame buffer 44c,<br>
rendering data D between the third buffer switching line 214<br>
and the last line in the fourth frame buffer 44d, by<br>
switching between the four frame buffers 44a-44d according to<br>
a sequence. The display controller 50 arranges the data in a<br>
screen of the display 60 adapted to switch the screen at 60<br>
Hz.<br>
[0076] Three out of four frames may be dropped so as to<br>
convert frames produced at 240 Hz into frames at 60 Hz.<br>
Simple filtering such as this cannot, however, fully exploit<br>
the result of rendering at a high frame rate and will result<br>
in poor quality of moving images. In contrast, according to<br>
the display control method of the embodiment, a frame is<br>
produced by using the four frames in respective portions.<br>
Therefore, the quality of moving images is maintained after<br>
frequency conversion.<br>
[0077] As described the embodiment properly addresses<br><br>
high frame rate rendering by the graphics processor 30 such<br>
that an on-screen image of the display is formed by obtaining<br>
image data by switching the frame buffer from which to read<br>
in accordance with a dummy vertical synchronizing signal<br>
adapted to the high frame rate and by synthesizing images<br>
read from the frame buffers. In this way, the results of<br>
rendering by the graphics processor 30 at the high frame rate<br>
are not left unused and are displayed on the display 60<br>
operated at an ordinary vertical synchronization frequency,<br>
thereby preventing the quality of moving images from being<br>
lowered unlike the rendering method that simply drops frames.<br>
[0078] Given above is a description based on an<br>
exemplary embodiment. The embodiment is intended to be<br>
illustrative only and it will be obvious to those skilled in<br>
the art that various modifications to constituting elements<br>
and processes could be developed and that such modifications<br>
are also within the scope of the present invention. One such<br>
modification will be described.<br>
[0079] The description above concerns the case where<br>
moving images produced by the graphics processor 30 according<br>
to the NTSC system are displayed on the display 60 of the PAL<br>
system operated at a different vertical synchronization<br>
frequency. The present invention is applicable to other<br>
cases including, for example, the display of moving images<br>
generated by the graphics processor 30 on displays having a<br>
quality of vertical synchronization frequencies for personal<br><br>
computers.<br>

of a multibuffer where drawing data is written by sequentially switching the frame buffer (44). A disc controller (50) sequentially<br>
switches frame buffers (44), selects a frame buffer (44) from which the drawing data is read, and supplies the read drawing data read<br>
by scanning the inside of the frame buffer to a display. A switch signal generating section (36) generates a buffer switch signal used<br>
to indicate the switching timing of the frame buffer (44) to be read to the display controller (50). The frequency of the buffer switch<br>
is different from the vertical synchronization frequency of the display (60).<br></td>
