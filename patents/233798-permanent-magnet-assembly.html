				<td>PERMANENT MAGNET ASSEMBLY<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to magnets, and more particularly to<br>
permanent magnet assemblies adapted to provide a time-varying magnetic<br>
field to an annular region.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Permanent magnets have been used for many years and for many<br>
purposes. However, new applications of permanent magnets are driving the<br>
development of increasingly sophisticated permanent magnet assemblies.  A<br>
permanent magnet assembly that can produce a high amplitude magnetic<br>
field intensity across a gap is of particular interest, especially in applications of<br>
magnetocaloric materials. Magnetocaloric materials near a transition from a<br>
ferromagnetic state to a paramagnetic state will warm when magnetized and<br>
cool when demagnetized. An apparatus that applies a time-varying magnetic<br>
field to magnetocaloric materials can be used to provide heating or cooling,<br>
for example in a magnetic refrigerator.<br>
A magnet assembly that produces a magnetic field intensity across a<br>
gap can be used to apply a time-varying magnetic field to magnetocaloric<br>
materials by moving the magnetocaloric materials in and out of the gap. This<br>
can be accomplished, for example, by moving the magnetocaloric materials<br>
relative to a stationary magnetic assembly, or by moving a magnet assembly<br>
relative to stationary magnetocaloric materials.<br>
Movement of magnetocaloric material relative to a magnet assembly<br>
can be accomplished through rotational or translational motion. One<br>
approach is to arrange magnetocaloric material in a stationary annular (ring-<br>
shaped) structure, and then to rotate a permanent magnet assembly around<br>
the ring. Another approach is to arrange magnetocaloric material in an<br>
annular structure partially surrounded by a stationary permanent magnet<br>
assembly, and then to rotate the annular structure containing the<br>
magnetocaloric material. Thus, a permanent magnet assembly specially<br>
adapted to provide a time-varying magnetic field to an annular region is of<br>
interest, for applications including, but not limited to, magnetic refrigeration.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A permanent magnet assembly according to the present invention<br>
utilizes one or more permanent magnet blocks and one or more flux return<br>
sections to form a permanent magnet assembly specially adapted to provide a<br>
time-varying magnetic field to an annular region. The permanent magnet<br>
assembly can include one or more pole pieces, although this is not required.<br>
The annular region can have a rectangular cross-section, although this is not<br>
required. A permanent magnet assembly according to the invention can be<br>
used, for example, in a rotating bed or rotating magnet magnetic refrigerator<br>
apparatus<br>
A preferred embodiment of a permanent magnet assembly according<br>
to the present invention includes an arc-shaped flux return section formed of<br>
magnetically permeable material having a C-shaped cross-section with two<br>
ends forming an opening, and upper and lower arc-shaped permanent<br>
magnet sections operatively coupled to the ends of the C of the flux return<br>
section, wherein an arc-shaped gap is formed between the south end of the<br>
upper arc-shaped permanent magnet section and the north end of the lower<br>
arc-shaped permanent magnet section.<br>
The flux return section of a permanent magnet assembly according to<br>
the invention can be positioned in the interior of the assembly in which case<br>
the opening of the flux return section faces outwardly from the central axis of<br>
the assembly. Alternatively, the flux return section can be positioned on the<br>
exterior of the assembly, at a radius from the central axis of the assembly, in<br>
which case the opening of the flux return section faces inwardly toward the<br>
central axis of the assembly.<br>
An alternative permanent magnet assembly according to the invention<br>
includes an upper flux return section formed of magnetically permeable<br>
material with a first arc-shaped upper permanent magnet section at one end<br>
and a second arc-shaped upper permanent magnet section at the other end,<br>
and a lower flux return section formed of magnetically permeable material with<br>
a first arc-shaped lower permanent magnet section at one end and a second<br>
arc-shaped lower permanent magnet section at the other end, wherein two<br>
arc-shaped gaps are formed between the permanent magnet sections at the<br>
ends of the upper and lower flux return sections.<br>
Another permanent magnet assembly according to the invention<br>
includes a central permanent magnet section and upper and lower pole<br>
pieces formed of magnetically permeable material that include arc-shaped<br>
side pole piece portions having pole faces that surround two arc-shaped gaps<br>
on the sides of the central permanent magnet section.<br>
A different embodiment of a permanent magnet assembly according to<br>
the invention includes an upper flux return section formed of magnetically<br>
permeable material with a first arc-shaped upper permanent magnet section<br>
at one end and a second arc-shaped upper permanent magnet section at the<br>
other end, and a lower flux return section formed of magnetically permeable<br>
material with a first arc-shaped lower permanent magnet section at one end<br>
and a second arc-shaped lower permanent magnet section at the other end,<br>
with a central flux return section between the upper and lower flux return<br>
sections, wherein two arc-shaped gaps are formed between the permanent<br>
magnet sections at the ends of the upper and lower flux return sections.<br>
A variety of structures can be used in an apparatus according to the<br>
invention. For example, the permanent magnet sections shown in the<br>
illustrative embodiments herein may be comprised of a single permanent<br>
magnet, or these permanent magnet sections may be comprised of one or<br>
more multiple permanent magnets and one or more sections of magnetically<br>
permeable material to form a magnetic array structure.<br>
Although the illustrative embodiments may show pole pieces or flux<br>
return sections formed as unitary structures, these structure may be<br>
comprised of individual sections which are operatively coupled together.<br>
Similarly, the relative dimensions, shapes, and positions of the permanent<br>
magnet sections, pole pieces, or flux return sections can be optimized for a<br>
particular application.<br>
A magnet assembly according to the invention can provide a time-<br>
varying magnetic field to an annular region. The particular shape and<br>
structure of such an annular region can be especially well suited for a rotating<br>
bed or rotating magnet magnetic refrigerator. Such a magnet assembly can<br>
allow constant access to the annular region that is subject to the time-varying<br>
magnetic field intensity, and this can enable components of a magnetic<br>
refrigerator such as magnetocaloric material and heat transfer fluid plumbing<br>
to be stationary and positioned within the annular region. Alternatively, the<br>
magnet assembly can be stationary, and components of a magnetic<br>
refrigerator such as magnetocaloric material and heat transfer fluid can rotate<br>
within the annular region. A magnet assembly according to the invention can<br>
have relatively low operating costs, for example by minimizing space<br>
requirements and by minimizing the mass of any moving parts.<br>
Such a magnet assembly can also have relatively low manufacturing<br>
costs, for example by reducing the need for precisely machined permanent<br>
magnets. Each of the permanent magnet portions of such a magnet<br>
assembly can be arc-shaped with a rectangular cross section or generally<br>
rectangular in shape, in either case with an orthogonal magnetization vector<br>
to minimize production costs. This geometry can be especially well suited to<br>
the manufacture of sintered NdFeB magnets by current pressing methods,<br>
and the relatively low number of magnet mating surfaces can reduce the<br>
number of precision grinding operations that might otherwise be required.<br>
Precisely machined structures used in a magnet assembly according to<br>
the invention, for example pole pieces that surround a gap at high magnetic<br>
field, may have surfaces that benefit from close tolerances to allow these<br>
surfaces to nest closely together with other components of a magnetic<br>
refrigerator, such as containers of magnetocaloric materials. By forming any<br>
structures requiring precise machining, such as pole pieces, of magnetically<br>
permeable material, and operatively coupling those precisely machined<br>
structures to rectangular permanent magnet portions, any precision machining<br>
of permanent magnet material can be reduced or avoided.<br>
A permanent magnet assembly according to the present invention can<br>
be used to generate a time-varying field over an annular region while<br>
minimizing the volume, mass, and fabrication cost of such an assembly. The<br>
magnetic field in the annular region can be used wherever a stationary or<br>
rotating wheel mechanism needs to be magnetized along part of its<br>
circumference. The particular design of this structure can allow unimpeded<br>
access to the annular region from one side, either from the exterior or from<br>
the interior, for example for plumbing carrying heat transfer fluid into and out<br>
of beds containing magnetocaloric materials located in the annular region.<br>
A permanent magnet assembly according to the invention can be of<br>
particular interest for use in a magnetic refrigeration device. Exemplary<br>
magnetic refrigeration devices that use rotational motion are shown in U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 6,526,759 and U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. US 2003/0106323 A1, the<br>
disclosures of which are incorporated by reference.<br>
Further objects, features, and advantages of the invention will be<br>
apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction<br>
with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to the drawings, Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a permanent<br>
magnet assembly according to the invention, indicated generally at 20. The<br>
permanent magnet assembly 20 surrounds an arc-shaped gap at high<br>
magnetic field 21 having a rectangular cross section 22 over an arc length of<br>
approximately 120 degrees, although the gap cross-section may have a<br>
different shape and the arc length may be greater than or less than 120<br>
degrees. As perhaps best shown in Fig. 2, the permanent magnet assembly<br>
20 is adapted to rotate about an axis of rotation 23, thereby sweeping an<br>
annular region 24.<br>
The permanent magnet assembly 20 includes an exterior flux return<br>
portion, indicated generally at 30, to provide a return path for the lines of<br>
magnetic flux and thereby complete the magnetic circuit. The flux return<br>
portion 30 is preferably of sufficient dimension to avoid saturation with<br>
magnetic flux, and is preferably shaped and exteriorly positioned at a<br>
sufficient distance from the gap at high magnetic field 21 to prevent shunting<br>
of the gap flux into the flux return portion 30.<br>
The flux return portion 30 can be formed of any suitable magnetically<br>
permeable material, for example a structural alloy such as low-carbon steel<br>
that has the ability to carry flux, or a specifically permeable material intended<br>
for use in magnetics such as the material sold by High Temp Metals of<br>
California, USA under the trademark Permendur 2V, or a combination of<br>
these materials, with or without additional non-permeable materials used, for<br>
example, to provide structural support.  The flux return portion 30 can<br>
include one or more chamfered corners 31, for example along the outer<br>
corners, or filled-in corners 32, for example along interior corners, to optimize<br>
flux return performance while minimizing stray flux and assembly weight.<br>
The permanent magnet assembly 20 includes an upper permanent<br>
magnet portion, indicated generally at 33, having a North pole 34 (marked<br>
"N") and a South pole 35 (marked "S"), and a lower permanent magnet<br>
portion, indicated generally at 36, having a North pole 37 and a South pole 38.<br>
The upper permanent magnet portion 33 and lower permanent magnet<br>
portion 36 can be formed of any suitable permanent magnet material, for<br>
example of the type sold by Sumitomo Special Metals of Japan under the<br>
trademark Neomax 50. As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the South pole 35 of the<br>
upper permanent magnet portion 33 and the North pole 37 of the lower<br>
permanent magnet portion 36 face the gap at high magnetic field 21.<br>
Fig. 3 is a perspective view of a permanent magnet assembly<br>
according to the invention, indicated generally at 45, having an interior flux<br>
return path. The permanent magnet assembly 45 may be especially useful in<br>
rotating magnet applications where the rotational moment of inertia is of<br>
concern.<br>
The permanent magnet assembly 45 surrounds an arc-shaped gap at<br>
high magnetic field 56 having a rectangular cross section over a given arc<br>
length, although this is not required and the cross-section may have different<br>
shapes and the arc length may be greater than or less than the arc length of<br>
the permanent magnet assembly 45. The permanent magnet assembly 45<br>
includes an interior flux return portion, indicated generally at 46, to provide a<br>
return path for the lines of magnetic flux and thereby complete the magnetic<br>
circuit. The permanent magnet assembly 45 can be adapted to rotate about<br>
an axis of rotation 47, thereby sweeping an annular region.<br>
The flux return portion 46 of the permanent magnet assembly 45 is<br>
preferably of sufficient dimension to avoid saturation with magnetic flux and to<br>
avoid flux leakage elsewhere in the wheel. The flux return portion 46 is<br>
preferably shaped and interiorly positioned at a sufficient distance from the<br>
gap at high magnetic field 56 to prevent shunting of the gap flux into the flux<br>
return portion 46. The flux return portion 46 can be formed of any suitable<br>
magnetically permeable material, for example of the types discussed above.<br>
Although the interior flux return portion 46 may come to an abrupt<br>
corner at the central axis of the assembly, other shapes may be used<br>
depending on flux density, mounting considerations, and counter-weighting<br>
among other factors. The flux return portion 46 can include one or more<br>
chamfered corners 48, for example along the outer corners, or filled-in corners<br>
49, for example along interior corners, to optimize flux return while minimizing<br>
stray flux, assembly weight, and rotational moment of inertia.<br>
The permanent magnet assembly 45 includes an upper permanent<br>
magnet portion, indicated generally at 50, having a North pole 51 (marked<br>
"N") and a South pole 52 (marked "S"), and a lower permanent magnet<br>
portion, indicated generally at 53, having a North pole 54 and a South pole 55.<br>
The upper permanent magnet portion 50 and lower permanent magnet portion<br>
53 can be formed of any suitable permanent magnet material, for example of<br>
the types discussed above. As shown in Fig. 3, the South pole 52 of the<br>
upper permanent magnet portion 50 and the North pole 54 of the lower<br>
permanent magnet portion 53 surround the gap at high magnetic field 56.<br>
Fig. 4 is a perspective view of another permanent magnet assembly<br>
according to the invention, indicated generally at 60, having upper and lower<br>
interior flux return paths and providing two gaps at high magnetic field.<br>
Compared to the permanent magnet assemblies of Figs. 1 and 3 which use a<br>
single flux return path, the lines of flux travel a comparatively shorter distance<br>
from one magnetic pole to the next in the permanent magnet assembly 60,<br>
such that the two flux return paths in the permanent magnet assembly 60 can<br>
be individually less massive that the single flux return paths of Figs. 1 and 3.<br>
This property can make the permanent magnet assembly 60 especially useful<br>
in rotating magnet applications that require at least some central free space<br>
along the axis of rotation where the rotational moment of inertia is also of<br>
concern.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, the permanent magnet assembly 60 surrounds two<br>
arc-shaped gaps at high magnetic field 74 having a rectangular cross section<br>
over an arc length, where each arc-shaped gap extends approximately 60<br>
degrees, although this is not required and the gap cross-sections may have a<br>
different shape and the arc lengths may be greater than or less than 60<br>
degrees. The permanent magnet assembly 60 includes two interior flux return<br>
portions, an upper flux return portion, indicated generally at 62, and a lower<br>
flux return portion, indicated generally at 63, to provide a return path for the<br>
lines of magnetic flux and thereby complete the magnetic circuit. The<br>
permanent magnet assembly 60 can be adapted to rotate about an axis of<br>
rotation 61, thereby sweeping an annular region.<br>
The upper flux return portion 62 and lower flux return portion 63 each<br>
include a central portion 64 extending outward from the axis of rotation. The<br>
upper flux return portion 62 and lower flux return portion 63 each preferably<br>
also include horizontally tapered portions 65 that concentrate the lines of flux<br>
in the central portion 64. A non-permeable axial link along the axis of rotation<br>
61 that connects the upper flux return portion 62 and the lower flux return<br>
portion 63 through the center of the assembly can be used to provide<br>
structural support.<br>
The upper flux return portion 62 and lower flux return portion 63 of the<br>
permanent magnet assembly 60 are preferably of sufficient dimension to<br>
avoid saturation with magnetic flux and to avoid flux leakage elsewhere in the<br>
wheel. The upper flux return portion 62 and lower flux return portion 63 are<br>
preferably shaped and positioned at a sufficient distance from the gaps at<br>
high magnetic field 74 to prevent shunting of the gap flux into those flux return<br>
portions. The upper flux return portion 62 and lower flux return portion 63 can<br>
be formed of any suitable magnetically permeable material, for example of the<br>
types discussed above.<br>
The upper flux return portion 62 has a first end operatively coupled to a<br>
first upper permanent magnet portion 66 and a second end operatively<br>
coupled to a second upper permanent magnet portion 67, with each of the<br>
upper permanent magnet portions 66 and 67 having a North pole 68 (marked<br>
"N") and a South pole 69 (marked "S"). Similarly, the lower flux return portion<br>
63 has a first end operatively coupled to a first lower permanent magnet<br>
portion 70 and a second end operatively coupled to a second lower<br>
permanent magnet portion 71, with each of the lower permanent magnet<br>
portions 70 and 71 having a North pole 68 (marked "N") and a South pole 69<br>
(marked "S").<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, the polar orientations of the upper and lower<br>
permanent magnet portions 66, 67, 70, and 71 are aligned to produce a<br>
circular flux around the magnetic circuit formed by the permanent magnet<br>
portions and the flux return portions. Relative to the first lower permanent<br>
magnet portion 70 and the first upper permanent magnet portion 66 which are<br>
aligned together in one direction, the second upper permanent magnet portion<br>
67 and the second lower permanent magnet portion 71 are aligned together in<br>
the opposite direction, thereby forming a circular flux loop.<br>
The upper permanent magnet portions 66 and 67 and the lower<br>
permanent magnet portions 70 and 71 can be formed of any suitable<br>
permanent magnet material, for example of the types discussed above. As<br>
shown in Fig. 4, the South pole 73 of the first lower permanent magnet portion<br>
70 and the North pole 68 of the first upper permanent magnet portion 66<br>
surround one gap at high magnetic field 74, and the South pole 69 of the<br>
second upper permanent magnet portion 67 and the North pole 72 of the<br>
second lower permanent magnet portion 71 surround a second gap at high<br>
magnetic field 74.<br>
Although in Fig. 4 the upper flux return portion 62 and the lower flux<br>
return portion 63 have a uniform thickness in the vertical direction, and<br>
although these flux return portions join the upper and lower permanent<br>
magnet portions 66, 67, 70, and 71 at abrupt corners, other shapes may be<br>
used depending on flux density, mounting considerations, and counter-<br>
weighting among other factors. The flux return portions can include one or<br>
more chamfered or rounded corners, for example along the outer corners or<br>
edges of the flux return portions, or filled-in corners, for example along the<br>
junction between the flux return portions and the permanent magnet portions,<br>
to optimize flux return while minimizing stray flux and assembly weight.<br>
Fig. 5 is a perspective view of an alternative permanent magnet<br>
assembly according to the invention indicated generally at 80, with a central<br>
magnet and upper and lower pole pieces and providing two gaps at high<br>
magnetic field. In the permanent magnet assembly 80, the majority of the<br>
assembly sits within the outer diameter of the wheel, thereby minimizing the<br>
rotational moment of inertia of the assembly.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, the permanent magnet assembly 80 includes a<br>
central permanent magnet portion 81 with an upper pole piece 85 and a lower<br>
pole piece 86 which direct the magnetic flux from the central permanent<br>
magnet portion 81 through two arc-shaped gaps at high magnetic field 94<br>
over a given arc length. Each gap typically extends 60 degrees, but this is not<br>
required and greater or lesser arc lengths can be used. The permanent<br>
magnet assembly 80 can be adapted to rotate about an axis of rotation 82,<br>
thereby sweeping an annular region.<br>
The central permanent magnet portion 81 of permanent magnet<br>
assembly 80 has a North pole 83 (marked "N") and a South pole 84 (marked<br>
"S"), with the magnetic vector of the central permanent magnet portion 81<br>
aligned with the axis of rotation 82. The central permanent magnet portion 81<br>
can be formed of any suitable permanent magnet material, for example of the<br>
types discussed above.<br>
The permanent magnet assembly 80 includes an upper pole piece,<br>
indicated generally at 85, and a lower pole piece, indicated generally at 86.<br>
The upper and lower pole pieces 85 and 86 are of similar construction, each<br>
having a central pole piece portion 87 with two ends, where each end of each<br>
central pole piece bears a side pole piece portion 88. The upper pole piece<br>
85 and lower pole piece 86 can be formed of any suitable magnetically<br>
permeable material, for example of the types discussed above. Each side<br>
pole piece portion 88 can include one or more chamfered corners 89.<br>
Fig. 6 is a cross-sectional view of the permanent magnet assembly of<br>
Fig. 5 taken along the line 6-6 thereof. As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, each end<br>
of the upper pole piece 85 terminates in an upper pole face 92. Each end of<br>
the lower pole piece 86 terminates in a lower pole face 93. The upper pole<br>
faces 92 and the lower pole faces 93 surround the two gaps at high magnetic<br>
field 94.<br>
As perhaps best shown in Fig. 6, the side pole piece portions 88<br>
preferably include vertically tapered portions 90, and as perhaps best shown<br>
in Fig. 5, the side pole piece portions 88 preferably also include horizontally<br>
tapered portions 91. The vertically tapered portions 90 and horizontally<br>
tapered portions 91 can be used, for example, to concentrate the magnetic<br>
flux into the two gaps at high magnetic field 94. As lines of flux leave the<br>
permanent magnet portion 81, the lines of flux converge along the vertically<br>
tapered portions 90 and horizontally tapered portions 91, whereby the flux<br>
lines crossing the gaps 94 can be at a higher density than the flux lines within<br>
the permanent magnet portion 81, providing a magnetic flux density in the<br>
gaps 94 that can be greater than the saturation flux density of the magnetic<br>
material comprising the permanent magnet portion 81 without the need for a<br>
multi-pole magnet array.<br>
The upper pole piece 85 and the lower pole piece 86 of the permanent<br>
magnet assembly 80 are preferably of sufficient dimension to avoid saturation<br>
with magnetic flux and to avoid flux leakage elsewhere in the wheel. The<br>
vertically tapered portions 90, the horizontally tapered portions 91, and the<br>
pole faces 92 and 93 are preferably shaped and positioned to place the gaps<br>
at high magnetic field 94 at a sufficient distance from the permanent magnet<br>
portion 81 to prevent shunting of the gap flux back into the permanent magnet<br>
portion 81.<br>
Although the central portions 87 of the upper and lower pole pieces 85<br>
and 86 have a uniform thickness in the vertical direction, other shapes may be<br>
used depending on flux density, mounting considerations, and counter-<br>
weighting among other factors. The upper and lower pole pieces 85 and 86<br>
may include additional tapering in one or more directions, for example<br>
between the central pole piece portion 87 and the upper and lower pole faces<br>
92 and 93, to further concentrate the lines of flux into the gaps 94. The upper<br>
and lower pole pieces 85 and 86 may include additional chamfered or<br>
rounded corners, for example along the outer corners or edges of the flux<br>
return portions, or filled-in corners, for example along the junction between the<br>
flux return portions and the permanent magnet portions, to optimize flux<br>
density through the gaps 94 while minimizing stray flux and assembly weight.<br>
As perhaps best shown in Fig. 6, the cross-section of the gaps at high<br>
magnetic field 94 can be trapezoidal, with an angle theta 95 between the<br>
horizontal and the lower pole face 93. There can also be a complementary<br>
angle between the horizontal and the upper pole face 92, although this is not<br>
required.<br>
The angle theta 95 is positive in the permanent magnet assembly 80 of<br>
Figs. 5 and 6, such that the interior dimension of the cross-section of the gaps<br>
at high magnetic field 94 is less than the exterior dimension of that cross-<br>
section, although this is not required. The angle theta 95 can also be zero, in<br>
which case the interior dimension of the cross-section of the gaps at high<br>
magnetic field would be equal to the exterior dimension of that cross-section.<br>
The angle theta 95 can also be negative, in which case the interior dimension<br>
of the cross-section of the gaps at high magnetic field would be greater than<br>
the exterior dimension of that cross-section.<br>
Although the upper pole faces 92 and the lower pole face 93 are shown<br>
as essentially planar, this is not required and other shapes may be used. For<br>
example, in some applications of a permanent magnet assembly according to<br>
the invention the pole faces could be concave or convex. Thus, the cross-<br>
section of the gaps at high magnetic field 94 can include, but not be limited to,<br>
a rectangle (including but not limited to a square), a parallelogram, a<br>
trapezoid, a circle, an oval, or nearly any other shape or combination of<br>
shapes.<br>
Fig. 7 is a perspective view of an alternative permanent magnet<br>
assembly according to the invention, indicated generally at 100, with an upper<br>
interior flux return path and a lower interior flux return path connected by a<br>
central flux return path. The permanent magnet assembly 100 of Fig. 7 is<br>
similar to the permanent magnet assembly 60 of Fig. 4, except that the<br>
permanent magnet assembly 100 includes a central flux return path and the<br>
permanent magnet sections have different polarities.<br>
By including the central flux return path in the permanent magnet<br>
assembly 100, and by aligning the polarities of the permanent magnet<br>
sections as shown in Fig. 7, the two arc-shaped gaps in the permanent<br>
magnet assembly 100 experience a magnetic field having the same polarity.<br>
In contrast, the two arc-shaped gaps at each end of in the permanent magnet<br>
assembly 60 shown in Fig. 4 experience a magnetic field having opposite<br>
polarities.<br>
Compared to the permanent magnet assembly 60 of Fig. 4, a structure<br>
positioned within the annular volume swept by the permanent magnet<br>
assembly 100 will experience less magnetic hysteresis, since the magnetic<br>
field does not reverse direction at the two ends of the permanent magnet<br>
assembly 100. This property can make the permanent magnet assembly 100<br>
especially useful for applications in which it is desirable to minimize magnetic<br>
hysteresis.<br>
As shown in Fig. 7, the permanent magnet assembly 100 surrounds<br>
two arc-shaped gaps at high magnetic field 115 having a rectangular cross<br>
section over a given arc length, although this is not required and the cross-<br>
section may have a different shape. Each arc-shaped gap typically extends<br>
60 degrees, although this is not required and greater or lesser arc lengths can<br>
be used. The permanent magnet assembly 100 includes an upper flux return<br>
portion 102, a lower flux return portion 103, and a central flux portion 104, to<br>
provide a return path for the lines of magnetic flux and thereby complete the<br>
magnetic circuit. The permanent magnet assembly 100 can be adapted to<br>
rotate about an axis of rotation 101, thereby sweeping an annular region.<br>
The upper flux return portion 102 and lower flux return portion 103<br>
each include a central portion 105 extending outward from the axis of rotation<br>
101. The central flux return portion 104 operatively couples the central<br>
portion 105 of the upper flux return portion 102 and the central portion 105 of<br>
the lower flux return portion 103. The upper flux return portion 102 and lower<br>
flux return portion 103 each preferably also include horizontally tapered<br>
portions 106 that concentrate the lines of flux in the central portion 105 of the<br>
upper flux return portion 102, the central portion 105 of the lower flux return<br>
portion 103, and the central flux return portion 104.<br>
In addition to the central flux return portion 104, the permanent magnet<br>
assembly 100 may also include one or more non-permeable members<br>
between the upper flux return portion 102 and the lower flux return portion 103<br>
to provide additional structural support, although this is not required.<br>
The upper flux return portion 102, lower flux return portion 103, and<br>
central flux return portion 104 of the permanent magnet assembly 100 are<br>
preferably of sufficient dimension to avoid saturation with magnetic flux and to<br>
avoid flux leakage elsewhere in the wheel. The upper flux return portion 102,<br>
lower flux return portion 103, and central flux return portion 104 are preferably<br>
shaped and positioned at a sufficient distance from the gap at high magnetic<br>
field 115 to prevent shunting of the gap flux into those flux return portions.<br>
The upper flux return portion 102, lower flux return portion 103, and central<br>
flux return portion 104 can be formed of any suitable magnetically permeable<br>
material, for example of the types discussed above.<br>
The upper flux return portion 102 has a first end operatively coupled to<br>
a first upper permanent magnet portion 107 and a second end operatively<br>
coupled to a second upper permanent magnet portion 108, with each of the<br>
upper permanent magnet portions 107 and 108 having a North pole 109<br>
(marked "N") and a South pole 110 (marked "S"). Similarly, the lower flux<br>
return portion 103 has a first end operatively coupled to a first lower<br>
permanent magnet portion 111 and a second end operatively coupled to a<br>
second lower permanent magnet portion 112, with each of the lower<br>
permanent magnet portions 111 and 112 having a North pole 113 (marked<br>
"N") and a South pole 114 (marked "S").<br>
As shown in Fig. 7, the polar orientations of the upper and lower<br>
permanent magnet portions 107, 108, 111, and 112 are all aligned in the<br>
same direction. This alignment produces two circular flux loops around the<br>
magnetic circuits formed by the permanent magnet portions and the upper,<br>
lower, and central flux return portions.<br>
The upper permanent magnet portions 107 and 108 and the lower<br>
permanent magnet portions 111 and 112 can be formed of any suitable<br>
permanent magnet material, for example of the types discussed above. As<br>
shown in Fig. 7, the South pole 110 of the first upper permanent magnet<br>
portion 107 and the North pole 113 of the first lower permanent magnet<br>
portion 111 surround one gap at high magnetic field 115, and the South pole<br>
110 of the second upper permanent magnet portion 108 and the North pole<br>
113 of the second lower permanent magnet portion 112 surround a second<br>
gap at high magnetic field 115.<br>
Although in Fig. 7 the upper flux return portion 102 and the lower flux<br>
return portion 103 have a uniform thickness in one direction and the central<br>
flux return portion 104 has a uniform thickness in two directions, and although<br>
these flux return portions can be joined together and to the upper and lower<br>
permanent magnet portions 107, 108, 111, and 112 at abrupt corners, other<br>
shapes may be used depending on flux density, mounting considerations, and<br>
counter-weighting among other factors. The flux return portions can include<br>
one or more chamfered or rounded corners, for example along the outer<br>
corners or edges of the flux return portions. The flux return portions can also<br>
have filled-in corners, for example along the junctions between the flux return<br>
portions or the junctions between the flux return portions and the permanent<br>
magnet portions. In a particular application, the specific shapes can be<br>
chosen, for example, to maximize flux return while minimizing stray flux and<br>
assembly weight.<br>
There are various possibilities with regard to alternative embodiments<br>
and applications of a magnet assembly according to the invention. Although<br>
the exemplary embodiments of the present invention refer to specific<br>
materials, other materials known to those skilled in the art as having suitable<br>
properties can be appropriately substituted.<br>
Although particular structures and portions of the embodiments<br>
described herein are referred to using the terms "upper," "lower," "vertical,"<br>
and "horizontal," and the like, it is understood that those terms are used in<br>
reference to the exemplary orientations shown in the drawings herein. It is<br>
understood that a permanent magnet assembly according to the invention can<br>
be used in any orientation, and the use of a particular term such as "vertical"<br>
or "horizontal" is used to describe the relationship between particular<br>
structures and portions of the embodiments described herein and not to limit<br>
those structures or portions of the embodiments to any particular orientation<br>
or frame of reference.<br>
Although the exemplary embodiments of the present invention show<br>
particular shapes and relative dimensions, other shapes and dimensions can<br>
be used. For example, although the total arc length at high magnetic field will<br>
usually range between 90 and 180 degrees, with 120 degrees being typical,<br>
other arc lengths may be used in an appropriate case and the exact arc length<br>
is not important to the invention. Further, the total arc length at high magnetic<br>
field may be comprised of a single arc-shaped gap at high magnetic field, or<br>
the total arc length at high magnetic field may be divided among a plurality of<br>
arc-shaped gaps at high magnetic field.<br>
Although the exemplary embodiments of the present invention herein<br>
may show individual portions and sections having unitary construction, other<br>
constructions can be used. For example, a flux return section or portion can<br>
have a unitary construction, or such a flux return section or portion can be<br>
comprised of a plurality of pieces which are attached together.<br>
Similarly, a permanent magnet section or portion can have a unitary<br>
construction, or such a permanent magnet section or portion can be<br>
comprised of a plurality of permanent magnet pieces, possibly including<br>
magnetically permeable pieces or magnetically impermeable pieces, which<br>
are attached together. For example, a rectangular permanent magnet section<br>
may be operatively coupled to an arc-shaped pole piece to obtain a structure<br>
which is the equivalent of an arc-shaped permanent magnet section.<br>
Although the exemplary embodiments of the present invention herein<br>
may show individual portions and sections having square or rectangular<br>
cross-sections, other constructions can be used. For example, a flux return<br>
section could have a continuously curved shape, a trapezoidal shape, or any<br>
combination of shapes.<br>
Although the exemplary embodiments of the present invention here<br>
may show permanent magnet sections or portions positioned adjacent to an<br>
arc-shaped gap without any intermediate components, this is not required.<br>
For example, one or more pole faces formed of magnetically permeable<br>
material may be positioned between the permanent magnet sections or<br>
portions and the arc-shaped gap in order to direct or concentrate the magnetic<br>
flux through the arc-shaped gap.<br>
The exemplary embodiments herein are described as being adapted to<br>
rotate about an axis whereby the permanent magnet assembly provides a gap<br>
at high magnetic field that sweeps an annular region, to thereby apply a time-<br>
varying magnetic field to the annular region. By rotating the permanent<br>
magnet assembly, a time-varying magnetic field can be applied to a structure<br>
located within the annular region, such as a ring of beds containing<br>
magnetocaloric materials. In this fashion, a rotating permanent magnet<br>
assembly according to the invention can be combined with stationary<br>
magnetocaloric materials for use in a rotating magnet magnetic refrigerator.<br>
However, it should be understood that a permanent magnet according<br>
to the invention can also be used in a stationary configuration, wherein an<br>
annular structure, such as a ring of beds containing magnetocaloric materials,<br>
is adapted to rotate relative to the permanent magnet assembly. In this<br>
fashion, a stationary permanent magnet assembly according to the invention<br>
can be combined with rotating magnetocaloric materials for use in a rotating<br>
bed magnetic refrigerator.<br>
Of course, a permanent magnet assembly according to the invention<br>
can also be used in a configuration in which both the permanent magnet<br>
assembly and the magnetocaloric materials rotate, in opposite directions or in<br>
the same direction at different angular velocities. Similarly, a permanent<br>
magnet assembly according to the invention can be used in a configuration in<br>
which either or both of the permanent magnet assembly or the magnetocaloric<br>
materials oscillate back and forth or otherwise move relative to each other.<br>
It is understood that the invention is not limited to the particular<br>
embodiments described herein, but embraces all such modified forms thereof<br>
