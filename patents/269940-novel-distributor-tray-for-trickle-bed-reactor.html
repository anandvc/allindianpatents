				<td>NOVEL DISTRIBUTOR TRAY FOR TRICKLE BED REACTOR FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel distributor tray for distribution of down flowing vapour or gas and liquid on a bed of catalyst particles in a trickle bed reactor. The novel distributor tray for trickle bed reactor, offers high density of primary distribution points, provides good quality secondary distribution of liquid operates at high turndown ratio and is resistant to fouling. PRIOR ART AND BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Trickle bed reactor consists of a fixed bed of solid catalyst particles contacted by a co current downward gas-liquid flow carrying both reactants and products (Figure 1). Trickle bed reactors are widely used in the petroleum industry in various applications such as hydroteating, hydrocracking, hydrorefming, etc.<br>
The distributor tray located above the catalyst bed is used to distribute liquid and gas uniformly. The catalyst particles are always porous, are in the form of extrudates, granules, spheres, tablets. The liquid flows down the reactor from particle to particle on the surface of the catalyst while the gas phase travels in the remaining void space of the flow channels. In general, the reaction occurs between the dissolved gas and liquid phase reactant at the interior surface of the catalyst. The performance of the reactor is affected by fluid distribution mainly liquid, liquid holdup, back mixing, catalyst wetting, mass and heat transfer phenomena.<br>
Several designs of distributor trays are commercially available:<br>
(1)	Perforated tray/Sieve tray type distributors- These are the earliest type of<br>
distribution trays used in the trickle bed reactors. They consist of a perforated tray<br>
or sieve tray with gas chimneys. This tray is simple to construct and is capable of<br>
providing the greatest number of drip points over the cross section of the catalyst<br>
bed.<br>
(2)	Chimney type distributors- These designs have chimneys evenly spaced across the<br>
distribution tray. These chimneys allow the vapor to pass through the top opening.<br>
The liquid flow is distributed through   weep holes or notches cut into the side of<br>
riser. This design eliminates the sensitivity to plugging. This type of device is<br>
essentially equivalent to a perforated tray with elevated liquid ports. A further<br>
improvement of this simple chimney distributor is the multi-port chimney. This<br>
distributor design has weep holes spaced vertically up the axis of the chimney,<br><br>
which provide greater flexibility to changing vapour/liquid ratios. These have increased tolerance to tray levelness problems.<br>
(3)	Bubble-cap type distributors - Bubble-cap design operates on a vapour assisted<br>
principle compared to liquid overflow principle employed in the chimney type<br>
distributors. In this design, vapour passing through slots in the bubble cap aspirate<br>
liquid held up on the tray, carrying it over a central down comer. The bubble cap<br>
design is much less sensitive to tray levelness than others because the liquid on<br>
tray is carried by the vapour. It is also less sensitive over a broad range of liquid<br>
loading. Another advantage of this type of distributor is that it acts like an<br>
additional   quenching  device,   bringing  the   liquid  and  vapour  closer to  an<br>
equilibrium temperature before they enter the catalyst bed. Also this is less prone<br>
to fouling compared to chimney type distributor.<br>
(4)	Vapour-lift Distributor- These distributors incorporate all advantages like vapour-<br>
liquid mixing, low vulnerability to plugging normally associated with vapour assist<br>
distributor such as bubble-cap distributor tray. But this tray has much smaller<br>
diameter chimney, which enables the installation of more distribution points across<br>
the tray area. These distributors exhibit very stable, low sensitivity operation over a<br>
broad range of the vapour/liquid ratios.<br>
Drawbacks connected with hitherto Known Processes/Devices: A number of problems are encountered in the use of these known distributing devices. Perforated tray type distributors have high sensitivity to tray levelness. The perforations can easily be plugged by coke, corrosion products or other particles carried into the reactor by the feed. Also in this type of device, the flexibility to liquid load is very poor. Another disadvantage of this device is that it can be designed to give good performance at either the design conditions or at turndown conditions, but not at both situations. Therefore, the tray has a tendency to run dry as vaporization increases towards the end of the cycle. Therefore, this type of device is not expected to provide good distribution.<br>
In chimney type distributors, the liquid flow is governed by the overflow principle. This design is also very sensitive to the tray levelness and changes in liquid loading. It offers fewer drip points than the perforated tray. To provide the turndown capability, these distributors are designed to maintain a liquid level at the design conditions above the level of the weep holes or notch bottom. If the feed rate is increased or a heavier feed is processed, the level on the tray will increase and can flood over the top of the chimney.<br><br>
The main disadvantage of bubble cap type distributor is that it requires large diameter and thus less number of drip points on to the catalyst bed. Vapour-lift design is basically a vapour assist distributor like bubble cap distributor and vapour assist distributor; in general have the problem of non-uniform secondary distribution.<br>
The present invention discloses a novel design of distributor tray for trickle bed reactor, which offers high density of primary distribution points, provides good quality secondary distribution of liquid, operates at high turndown ratio and is resistant to fouling. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main objective of the invention is to provide a novel design for distributor tray for use in trickle bed reactors.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel distributor tray having large number of distribution points.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a novel distributor tray having higher density of distribution points which improves performance of the catalyst bed due to better wetting of catalyst particles.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a novel distributor tray to provide secondary distribution of liquid.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide novel distributor tray which is resistant to fouling and reduces maintenance requirements. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention discloses an apparatus for distribution of down flowing vapour or gas and liquid on a bed of catalyst particles in a trickle bed reactor comprising of a distributor tray on which a number of distributor units are located.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the vapour or gas and liquid are fed to the distributor tray through a feed pipe and an inlet device attached to the feed pipe wherein the vapour or gas is distributed over the catalyst bed through primary distribution points and the liquid is first distributed through the primary distribution points and then further distribution of liquid is achieved through the secondary distribution attachments.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention each distributor unit consists of a gas tube, a liquid tube and a secondary distribution attachment wherein the gas tube offers passage to vapour or gas and the liquid tube offers independent passage to the liquid.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the vapour or gas enters the gas tube through a number of rectangular slots wherein these slots are dimensioned to provide<br><br>
sufficient pressure drop in the gas phase to ensure uniform distribution of vapour or gas and the liquid enters the gas tube from the liquid tube through a number of circular holes wherein the vapour or gas velocity in the gas tube imparts enough energy on the liquid to ensure further distribution of liquid phase.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the liquid enters the liquid tube through specified numbers of circular holes located at different elevations which ensures uniform distribution even under turndown conditions wherein the holes on the liquid tube are located above the distributor tray deck level, which offers high level of resistance to fouling.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the secondary distribution attachment provides further distribution of liquid with or without the aid of vapour or gas velocity wherein at high vapour or gas velocity, the vapour or gas assists secondary distribution of liquid and the attachment helps in achieving uniformity of the distribution, which otherwise is quite non-uniform and at low vapour or gas velocity, when the vapour or gas hardly provides any assistance to liquid distribution, the attachment provides excellent secondary distribution of liquid.<br>

Gas/ liquid two-phase distributor tray is an integral part of trickle bed reactor. In a trickle bed reactor gas and liquid flow downward co-currently through catalyst beds. Performance of catalyst in facilitating desired reactions depends largely on the efficiency of the distributor tray. Following aspects are important for designing the two-phase distributor tray:<br>
Primary distribution of liquid and gas Secondary distribution of liquid<br>
-    Turndown of gas and liquid rates<br><br>
Resistance to fouling<br>
Catalyst used in trickle bed reactors are typically of lmm-3mm size. Such small sized particles have limited capability for radial distribution of liquid. Therefore, for such particles, higher density of distribution points improves performance of the catalyst bed due to better wetting of catalyst particles. Therefore, in addition to primary distribution of liquid through large number of distribution points, the distributor tray is also designed to provide secondary distribution of liquid. As far as distribution of gas phase is concerned, initial distribution through large number of distribution is important. Further distribution of gas is achieved due to high-pressure drop across catalyst bed. To economize the design and engineering as well to fulfill the process requirement high turndown distributors are important. Resistance to fouling offers wider range of applicability reduces maintenance requirements.<br>
The present invention proposes a novel design for distributor tray for use in trickle bed reactors. The novel design of the distributor tray offers high density of primary distribution points, good quality secondary distribution of liquid, high turndown of gas and liquid rates and effective resistance to fouling.<br>
