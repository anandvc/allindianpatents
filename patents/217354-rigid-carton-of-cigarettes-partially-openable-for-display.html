				<td>RIGID CARTON OF CIGARETTES PARTIALLY OPSNABLE FOR DISPLAY<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a. rigid carton of cigarettes partially openable for display.<br>
More specifically, the present invention relates to a rigid carton of cigarettes made from a flat cardboard blank and containing a group of ten packets of cigarettes.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The end user of a carton of cigarettes is normally a retailer who simultaneously uses, and removes individual packets for sale, from a number of different open cartons (of different brands and/or types of cigarettes).<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
It is an. object of the present invention to provide a rigid carton of cigarettes designed to permit a clear view of the type of packets contained inside, as well as troublefree withdrawal and adequate retention of the packets themselves.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a rigid carton of cigarettes; the carton being<br>
parallelepiped-shaped and comprising a cup-shaped bottom container for supporting a group of packets of cigarettes, and a top lid; the carton being characterized in that the lid is substantially cup-shaped and connected to the bottom container along at least one preweakened tear line running along two parallel, facing vertical lateral walls, and along a vertical front wall, so as to divide each vertical wall into a respective bottom portion forming part of the container, and a respective remaining top portion forming part of the lid; each packet of cigarettes being housed inside the carton with a major lateral wall of the packet parallel to said front wall; and the preweakened tear line being located at a first height along the vertical lateral walls and dropping to a second height, lower than the first height, along the vertical front wall.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
A number of non-limiting embodiments of the present invention will be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a front view in perspective of a preferred embodiment of the carton according to the present invention in a closed configuration;<br>
Figure 2 shows a front view in perspective of the Figure 1 carton in an open configuration;<br>
Figure 3 shows a layout of a blank used to form the Figure 1 carton;<br>
Figure 4 shows a front view in perspective of an<br>
alternative embodiment of the carton according to the present invention in an open configuration;<br>
Figure 5 shows different embodiments of a detail of the Figure 1 carton.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Number 1 in Figures 1 and 2 indicates as a whole a rigid carton containing a group 2 of ten packets 3 of cigarettes arranged in one row 4. Each packet 3 is substantially parallelepiped-shaped, and comprises two vertical, parallel, facing major lateral walls 5 (only one wall 5 of the first packet 3 is shown partly in Figure 2), and two vertical, parallel facing minor lateral walls 6 (only one wall 6 of each packet 3 is shown partly in Figure 2) . Packets 3 in row 4 are arranged with respective major lateral walls 5 contacting one another; and each major lateral wall 5 has respective writing and/or a respective graphic element 7 clearly and unmistakably indicating the brand and characteristics of the cigarettes (not shown) inside respective packet 3.<br>
In an alternative embodiment shown in Figure 4, the ten packets 3 of cigarettes in group 2 are arranged in two identical, side by side rows 4.<br>
Carton 1 is substantially right-parallelepiped-shaped, and comprises a cup-shaped bottom container 8 for supporting group 2 of packets 3, and a substantially cup-shaped top lid 9 connected to bottom container 8 along a preweakened tear line 10 and detachable from container 8 to enable carton 1 to assume a closed configuration<br>
(Figure 1) and an open configuration (Figure 2).<br>
When lid 9 is in the closed configuration, carton 1 is substantially in the form of a right parallelepiped defined by a pair of parallel, facing vertical lateral walls 11 and 12 (only wall 11 shown in Figures 1 and 2) , a vertical front wall 13, a vertical rear wall 14 (not shown in Figures I and 2), a horizontal top wall 15, and a horizontal bottom wall 16 (not shown in Figures 1 and 2) .<br>
Preweakened line 10 runs along the two lateral walls 11 and 12 and along front wall 13 to divide each wall 11, 12, 13 into a respective bottom portion lla, 12a, 13a forming part of container 8, and into a respective remaining top portion lib, 12b, I3b forming part of lid 9. Rear wall 14 and bottom wall 16 are exclusive to container 8, and top wall 15 exclusive to lid 9.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, packets 3 in row 4 are arranged with major lateral walls 5 positioned vertically and parallel to front wall 13 of carton 1; and the first packet 3 in row 4 is positioned with a major lateral wall 5 directly contacting an inner surface of front wall 13.<br>
As shown in Figures 1 and 2, preweakened line 10 is located at a first height HI along lateral walls 11 and 12, and drops to a second height H2, lower than first height HI, along front wall 13, so that portions lla and 12a of container 8 have much larger surfaces than the corresponding portions lib and 12b of lid 9, and portion 13a of container 8 has a surface comparable with that of<br>
portion 13b of lid 9.<br>
As shown, in Figure 2, the shape and size of portion 13a allow a clear view of the writing and/or graphic element 7 of the first packet 3 in row 4; each packet 3 may be removed easily from container 8, by portions lla and lib being lower than minor lateral walls 6 of packets 3 and so permitting easy grip of packets 3 by the user; and the relatively high surfaces of portions lib and I2b provide for adequately retaining packets 3 even when fewer than the initial number.<br>
Carton 1 is therefore easy to store, transport and handle in the closed configuration (Figure 1) and, when opened by detaching lid 9 from container 8 (Figure 2) , allows a clear view of the type of packets 3 inside, and provides for easy withdrawal and adequate retention of packets 3.<br>
In an alternative embodiment shown in Figure 5, carton 1 comprises a further preweakened tear line 17 running parallel to and above preweakened line 10 along at least a portion of lateral wall 11, so as to define a tear-off strip by which to tear open carton 1 easily.<br>
More specifically, as shown in the enlarged detail in Figure 5, preweakened tear lines 10 and 17 comprise respective initial portions 18, which are detached and located side by side close to an outer edge 19 of lateral wall 11 to define a tear-off tongue 20.<br>
In the Figure 5 embodiment, line 17 runs parallel to line 10 along the edge between lateral wall 11 and top<br>
wail 15.<br>
In an alternative embodiment not shown, line 17 runs parallel to and above preweakened line 10 along the whole of lateral wall 11; and, in a further embodiment not shown, line 17 runs parallel to and above preweakened line 10 along the whole lateral walls 11 and 12 and front<br>
As shown in Figure 3, carton 1 in Figures 1 and 2 is formed from a corresponding flat blank 21, which is substantially in the form of an elongated rectangle, and the parts of which ' are indicated, wherever possible, using the same reference numbers, with superscripts, as for the corresponding parts of carton 1.<br>
Blank 21 comprises a longitudinal central axis 22, and two longitudinal bend lines 23 and 24 dividing blank 21 into a central longitudinal strip 25 and two lateral longitudinal strips 26. Strips 25 and 26 are crossed by a number of transverse bend lines 27, 28, 29, 30, which divide central strip 25 into a panel 16' extending between an outer edge of blank 21 and line 27, a panel 11' extending between lines 27 and 28, a panel 15' extending between lines 28 and 29, a panel 12' extending between lines 29 and 30, arid a tongue 16" extending between line 30 and an outer edge of blank 21.<br>
When forming carton 1, panel 16' and tongue 16" are superimposed and glued together to define bottom wall 16<br>
of carton 1.<br>
Panel 12'  comprises a wing 13'  and a wing 14'<br>
located on opposite sides of panel 12'; and, as shown in Figure 3, panels 11' and 12' and wing 13' comprise respective portions of preweakened tear line 10.<br>
Panel 12' is divided by the respective portion of preweakened line 10 into a portion 12a' forming part of container 8, and a remaining portion 12b' forming part of lid wirg 14' is connected to portion I2a' by a portion of respective longitudinal bend line 24, and is connected to portion 12b' by a longitudinal portion of the respective portion of preweakened line 10.<br>
Panel 11' is divided by the respective portion of preweakened line 10 into a portion lla1 forming part of container 8, and a remaining portion lib1 forming part of lid 9; and portion lla1 forming part of container 8 is joined to lateral tongues 31 and 32 located on opposite sides of panel 11' and which are superimposed on and glued respectively to wings 13' and 14' to define walls 13 and 14 of carton 1.<br>
Panel 15' comprises substantially rounded lateral tongues 33 and 34 located on opposite sides of panel 15' and which are superimposed respectively on wings 13' and 14' to define walls 13 and 14 of carton 1. Tongue 34 is superimposed on but not connected (in particular, not glued) to wing 14', in that wing 14' forms part of container 8, and tongue 34 part of lid 9.<br>
As shown in Figure 3b, wing 13' is divided by the respective portion of preweakened line 10 into a portion 13a' forming part of container 8, and a remaining portion<br>
13b' forcing part of lid 9; tongue 33 is superimposed on and glued to portion 13b'; tongue 31 is superimposed on and glued to portion 13a'; and tongues 31 and 33 are so shaped and sized as not to overlap preweakened line 10.<br><br><br><br>
