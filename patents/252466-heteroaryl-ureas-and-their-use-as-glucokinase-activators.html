				<td>GLUCOKINASE ACTIVATORS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to compounds that are activators of glucokinase and thus may be useful for the management, treatment, control, or adjunct treatment of diseases, where increasing glucokinase activity is beneficial.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Diabetes is characterised by an impaired glucose metabolism manifesting itself among other things by an elevated blood glucose level in the diabetic patients. Underlying defects lead to a classification of diabetes into two major groups: Type 1 diabetes, or insulin demanding diabetes mellitus (IDDM), which arises when patients lack (3-cells producing insulin in their pancreatic glands, and type 2 diabetes, or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), which occurs in patients with an impaired p-cell function besides a range of other abnormalities.<br>
Type 1 diabetic patients are currently treated with insulin, while the majority of type 2 diabetic patients are treated either with sulphonylureas that stimulate p-cell function or with agents that enhance the tissue sensitivity of the patients towards insulin or with insulin. Among the agents applied to enhance tissue sensitivity towards insulin, metformin is a representative example.<br>
Even though sulphonylureas are widely used in the treatment of NIDDM this therapy is, in most instances, not satisfactory: In a large number of NIDDM patients sulphonylureas do not suffice to normalise blood sugar levels and the patients are, therefore, at high risk for acquiring diabetic complications. Also, many patients gradually lose the ability to respond to treatment with sulphonylureas and are thus gradually forced into insulin treatment. This shift of patients from oral hypoglycaemic agents to insulin therapy is usually ascribed to exhaustion of the p-cells in NIDDM patients.<br>
In normal subjects as well as in diabetic subjects, the liver produces glucose in order to avoid hypoglycaemia. This glucose production is derived either from the release of glucose from glycogen stores or from gluconeogenesis, which is a de novo intracellular synthesis of glucose. In type 2 diabetes, however, the regulation of hepatic glucose output is poorly controlled and is increased, and may be doubled after an overnight fast. Moreover, in these patients there exists a strong correlation between the increased fasting plasma glucose levelsand the rate of hepatic glucose production. Similarly, hepatic glucose production will be increased in type 1 diabetes, if the disease is not properly controlled by insulin treatment. Since existing forms of therapy of diabetes does not lead to sufficient glycaemic control and therefore are unsatisfactory, there is a great demand for novel therapeutic approaches. Atherosclerosis, a disease of the arteries, is recognized to be the leading cause of death in the United States and Western Europe. The pathological sequence leading to atherosclerosis and occlusive heart disease is well known. The earliest stage in this sequence is the formation of "fatty streaks" in the carotid, coronary and cerebral arteries and in the aorta. These lesions are yellow in colour due to the presence of lipid deposits found principally within smooth-muscle cells and in macrophages of the intima layer of the arteries and aorta. Further, it is postulated that most of the cholesterol found within the fatty streaks, in turn, give rise to development of the "fibrous plaque", which consists of accumulated intimal smooth muscle cells laden with lipid and surrounded by extra-cellular lipid, collagen, elastin and pro-teoglycans. The cells plus matrix form a fibrous cap that covers a deeper deposit of cell debris and more extracellular lipid. The lipid is primarily free and esterified cholesterol. The fibrous plaque forms slowly, and is likely in time to become calcified and necrotic, advancing to the "complicated lesion" which accounts for the arterial occlusion and tendency toward mural thrombosis and arterial muscle spasm that characterize advanced atherosclerosis. Epidemiological evidence has firmly established hyperlipidemia as a primary risk factor in causing cardiovascular disease (CVD) due to atherosclerosis. In recent years, leaders of the medical profession have placed renewed emphasis on lowering plasma cholesterol levels, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol in particular, as an essential step in prevention of CVD. The upper limits of "normal" are now known to be significantly lower than heretofore appreciated. As a result, large segments of Western populations are now realized to be at particular high risk. Independent risk factors include glucose intolerance, left ventricular hypertrophy, hypertension, and being of the male sex. Cardiovascular disease is especially prevalent among diabetic subjects, at least in part because of the existence of multiple independent risk factors in this population. Successful treatment of hyperlipidemia in the general population, and in diabetic subjects in particular, is therefore of exceptional medical importance.<br>
Hypertension (or high blood pressure) is a condition, which occurs in the human population as a secondary symptom to various other disorders such as renal artery stenosis, pheo-chromocytoma, or endocrine disorders. However, hypertension is also evidenced in many patients in whom the causative agent or disorder is unknown. While such "essential" hypertension is often associated with disorders such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertriglyceride-.mia, the relationship between these disorders has not been elucidated. Additionally, many patients display the symptoms of high blood pressure in the complete absence of any other signs of disease or disorder.<br>
It is known that hypertension can directly lead to heart failure, renal failure, and stroke (brain haemorrhaging). These conditions are capable of causing short-term death in a patient. Hypertension can also contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and coronary disease. These conditions gradually weaken a patient and can lead to long-term death. The exact cause of essential hypertension is unknown, though a number of factors are believed to contribute to the onset of the disease. Among such factors are stress, uncontrolled emotions, unregulated hormone release (the renin, angiotensin aldosterone system), excessive salt and water due to kidney malfunction, wall thickening and hypertrophy of the vascu-lature resulting in constricted blood vessels and genetic factors.<br>
The treatment of essential hypertension has been undertaken bearing the foregoing factors in mind. Thus a broad range of beta-blockers, vasoconstrictors, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and the like have been developed and marketed as antihypertensives. The treatment of hypertension utilizing these compounds has proven beneficial in the prevention of short-interval deaths such as heart failure, renal failure, and brain haemorrhaging. However, the development of atherosclerosis or heart disease due to hypertension over a long period of time remains a problem. This implies that although high blood pressure is being reduced, the underlying cause of essential hypertension is not responding to this treatment. Hypertension has been associated with elevated blood insulin levels, a condition known as hyperinsulinemia. Insulin, a peptide hormone whose primary actions are to promote glucose utilization, protein synthesis and the formation and storage of neutral lipids, also acts to promote vascular cell growth and increase renal sodium retention, among other things. These latter functions can be accomplished without affecting glucose levels and are known causes of hypertension. Peripheral vasculature growth, for example, can cause constriction of peripheral capillaries, while sodium retention increases blood volume. Thus, the lowering of insulin levels in hyperinsulinemics can prevent abnormal vascular growth and renal sodium retention caused by high insulin levels and thereby alleviates hypertension. Cardiac hypertrophy is a significant risk factor in the development of sudden death, myocar-dial infarction, and congestive heart failure. Theses cardiac events are due, at least in part, to increased susceptibility to myocardial injury after ischemia and reperfusion, which can occur in out-patient as well as perioperative settings. There is an unmet medical need to prevent or minimize adverse myocardial perioperative outcomes, particularly perioperative myocardial infarction. Both non-cardiac and cardiac surgery are associated with substantial risks formyocardial infarction or death. Some 7 million patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery are considered to be at risk, with incidences of perioperative death and serious cardiac complications as high as 20-25% in some series. In addition, of the 400,000 patients undergoing coronary by-pass surgery annually, perioperative myocardial infarction is estimated to occur in 5% and death in 1-2%. There is currently no drug therapy in this area, which reduces damage to cardiac tissue from perioperative myocardial ischemia or enhances cardiac resistance to ischemic episodes. Such a therapy is anticipated to be life-saving and reduce hospi-talizations, enhance quality of life and reduce overall health care costs of high risk patients. Obesity is a well-known risk factor for the development of many very common diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and diabetes. The incidence of obese people and thereby also these diseases is increasing throughout the entire industrialised world. Except for exercise, diet and food restriction no convincing pharmacological treatment for reducing body weight effectively and acceptably currently exists. However, due to its indirect but important effect as a risk factor in mortal and common diseases it will be important to find treatment for obesity and/or means of appetite regulation.<br>
The term obesity implies an excess of adipose tissue. In this context obesity is best viewed as any degree of excess adiposity that imparts a health risk. The cut off between normal and obese individuals can only be approximated, but the health risk imparted by the obesity is probably a continuum with increasing adiposity. The Framingham study demonstrated that a 20% excess over desirable weight clearly imparted a health risk (Mann GV N.Engl.J.Med 291:226, 1974). In the United States a National Institutes of Health consensus panel on obesity agreed that a 20% increase in relative weight or a body mass index (BMI = body weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) above the 85th percentile for young adults constitutes a health risk. By the use of these criteria 20 to 30 percent of adult men and 30 to 40 percent of adult women in the United States are obese. (NIH, Ann Intern Med 103:147, 1985).<br>
Even mild obesity increases the risk for premature death, diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis, gallbladder disease, and certain types of cancer. In the industrialised western world the prevalence of obesity has increased significantly in the past few decades. Because of the high prevalence of obesity and its health consequences, its prevention and treatment should be a high public health priority.<br>
When energy intake exceeds expenditure, the excess calories are stored in adipose tissue, and if this net positive balance is prolonged, obesity results, i.e. there are two components to weight balance, and an abnormality on either side (intake or expenditure) can lead to obesity.The regulation of eating behaviour is incompletely understood. To some extent appetite is controlled by discrete areas in the hypothalamus: a feeding centre in the ventrolateral nucleus of the hypothalamus (VLH) and a satiety centre in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMM). The cerebral cortex receives positive signals from the feeding centre that stimulate eating, and the satiety centre modulates this process by sending inhibitory impulses to the feeding centre. Several regulatory processes may influence these hypothalamic centres. The satiety centre may be activated by the increases in plasma glucose and/or insulin that follow a meal. Meal-induced gastric distension is another possible inhibitory factor. Additionally the hypothalamic centres are sensitive to catecholamines, and beta-adrenergic stimulation inhibits eating behaviour. Ultimately, the cerebral cortex controls eating behaviour, and impulses from the feeding centre to the cerebral cortex are only one input. Psychological, social, and genetic factors also influence food intake.<br>
At present a variety of techniques are available to effect initial weight loss. Unfortunately, initial weight loss is not an optimal therapeutic goal. Rather, the problem is that most obese patients eventually regain their weight. An effective means to establish and/or sustain weight loss is the major challenge in the treatment of obesity today.<br>

The reaction mixture was stirred for 30 min. Water (15ml) was added and extracted with DCM (3x25ml). The organic phase was dried, filtered and evaporation in vacua gave 1.1g white crystals of N-[5-(4-Methyl-piperazine-1-sulfonyl)-thiazol-2-yl]-acetamide. 1H NMR (MeOD): S 9.5(brs; 1H); 3.2(brt; 4H); 2.55(brt; 4H); 2.50(s; 3H); 2.32(s; 3H); 2.29(s; 3H).<br>
Step 2: The above compound was hydrolysed in 6 N HCI/MeOH (1:1) in a microwave vessel (20ml). The reaction was heated 3000@80°C; x4 before complete conversion. To the reaction mixture was added DCM (10. ml) and stirred for 5 min. The DCM phase was removed; TLC showed no compound in the organic phase to remove neutral starting material from the first step!

Glucokinase Activity Assay (I)<br>
Glucokinase activity is assayed spectrometrically coupled to glucose 6-phosphate dehydro-genase to determine compound activation of glucokinase. The final assay contains 50 mM<br>
Hepes, pH 7.1, 50 mM KCI, 5 mM MgCI2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.6 mM NADP, 1 mM ATP, 0.195 μM G-6-P dehydrogenase (from Roche, 127 671), 15 nM recombinant human glu-cokinase. The glucokinase is human liver glucokinase N-terminally truncated with an N-<br>
terminal His-tag ((His)8-VEQILA	Q466) and is expressed in E.coli as a soluble protein with<br>
enzymatic activity comparable to liver extracted GK.<br>
The purification of His-tagged human glucokinase (hGK) was performed as follows: The cell pellet from 50 ml E. coli culture was resuspended in 5 ml extraction buffer A (25 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mM MgCI2, 150 mM NaCI, 2 mM mercaptoethanol) with addition of 0.25 mg/ml ly-sozyme and 50 μg/ml sodium azide. After 5 minutes at room temperature 5 ml of extraction buffer B (1.5 M NaCI, 100 mM CaCI2,100 mM MgCI2, 0.02 mg/ml DNase 1, protease inhibitor tablet (Complete® 1697498): 1 tablet pr. 20 ml buffer) was added. The extract was then cen-trifugated at 15.000 g for 30 minutes. The resulting supernatant was loaded on a 1 ml Metal Chelate Affinity Chromatography (MCAC) Column charged with Ni2+. The column is washed with 2 volumes buffer A containing 20 mM imidazole and the bound his-tagged hGK is subsequently eluted using a 20 minute gradient of 20 to 500 mM imididazol in buffer A. Fractions are examined using SDS-gel-electrophoresis, and fractions containing hGK (MW: 52 KDa) are pooled. Finally a gelfiltration step is used for final polishing and buffer exhange. hGK containing fractions are loaded onto a Superdex 75 (16/60) gelfiltration column and eluted with Buffer B (25 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mM MgCI2, 150 mM NaCI, 1 mM Dithiothreitol). The purified hGK is examined by SDS-gel electrophoresis and MALDI mass spectrometry and finally 20% glycerol is added before freezing. The yield from 50 ml E. coli culture is generally approximately 2-3 mg hGK with a purity &gt;90%.<br>
The compound to be tested is added into the well in final 2.5% DMSO concentration in an amount sufficient to give a desired concentration of compound, for instance 1, 5, 10, 25 or 50 fjM. The reaction starts after glucose is added to a final concentration of 2, 5,10 or 15 mM. The assay uses a 96-well UV plate and the final assay volume used is 200 μ/well. The plate is incubated at 25°C for 5 min and kinetics is measured at 340 nm in SpectraMax every 30 seconds for 5 minutes. Results for each compound are expressed as the fold activation of the glucokinase activity compared to the activation of the glucokinase enzyme in an assay without compound after having been subtracted from a "blank", which is without glucokinase enzyme and without compound. The compounds in each of the Examples exhibits activation of glucokinase in this assay. A compound, which at a concentration of at or below 30 μM gives 1.5 - fold higher glucokinase activity than the result from the assay without compound, is deemed to be an activator of glucokinase.he glucose sensitivity of the compounds are measured at a compound concentration of 10 M and at glucose concentrations of 5 and 15 mM.<br>
Glucokinase Activity Assay (II)<br>
Determination of glycogen deposition in isolated rat hepatocytes:<br>
Hepatocytes are isolated from rats fed ad libitum by a two-step perfusion technique. Cell viability, assessed by trypan blue exclusion, is consistently greater than 80%. Cells are plated onto collagen-coated 96-well plates in basal medium (Medium 199 (5.5 mM glucose) supplemented with 0.1 μM dexamethasone, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine and 1 nM insulin) with 4 % PCS at a cell density of 30,000 cells/well. The medium is replaced with basal medium 1 hour after initial plating in order to remove dead cells. Medium is changed after 24 hours to basal medium supplemented with 9.5 mM glucose and 10 nM insulin to induce glycogen synthesis, and experiments are performed the next day. The hepatocytes are washed twice with prewarmed (37°C) buffer A (117.6 mM NaCI, 5.4 mM KCI, 0.82 mM Mg2SO4, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, 20 mM HEPES, 9 mM NaHCO3, 0.1% w/v HSA, and 2.25 mM CaCI2, pH 7.4 at 37°C) and incubated in 100 A/I buffer A containing 15 mM glucose and increasing concentrations of the test compound, such as for instance 1, 5, 10, 25, 50 or 100//M, for 180 minutes. Glycogen content is measured using standard procedures(Agius, L.et al, Biochem J. 266. 91-102 (1990). A compound, which when used in this assay gives an significant increase in glycogen content compared to the result from the assay without compound, is deemed to have activity in this assay.<br>
Glucokinase Activity Assay (III)<br>
Stimulation of insulin secretion by glucokinase activators in INS-1E cells<br>
The glucose responsive B-cell line INS-1E is cultivated as described by Asfari M et al., Endocrinology, 130. 167-178 (1992). The cells are then seeded into 96 well cell culture plates and grown to a density of approximately 5 x 104 per well. Stimulation of glucose dependent insulin secretion is tested by incubation for 2 hours in Krebs Ringer Hepes buffer at glucose concentrations from 2.5 to 15 mM with or without addition of glucokinase activating compounds in concentrations of for instance 1, 5,10, 25, 50 or 100//M, and the supernatants collected for measurements of insulin concentrations by ELISA (n= 4). A compound, which when used in this assay gives an significant increase in insulin secretion in response to glucose com-spared to the result from the assay without compound, is deemed to have activity in this as-say.<br>
