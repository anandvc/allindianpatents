are well known and are used for dyeing wool, polyamides, leather and paper. However, applied as single dyes in a dye bath the stability of the bath is not very high and precipitations of the dyestuffs in the bath occurs.<br>
This problem is solved by the dye composition according to the invention.<br><br>
The present application provides an acid dye composition comprising a dyestuff according to the formula (I)        <br>
 (Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1 signifies methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl and a dyestuff according to the formula (II)         <br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R signifies methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl and a dyestuff according to the formula (III)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Werein     R signifies methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl and R4 signifies methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl.<br>
By preference the substituents R1, R2, R3 or R4 signify independently methyl or ethyl.<br><br>
More preferred mixtures according to the invention comprise a dyestuff according to the formula (la)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
and a dyestuff according to the formula (IIa)<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
and a dyestuff according to the formula (IIIa)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The compositions according to the invention comprise 10 weight - % to 70 weight - % of a compound according to the formula (I) and 10 weight - % to 70 weight - % of a compound according to the formula (II) and 10 weight - % to 70 weight - % of a compound according to the formula (III) with the proviso the sum of the weight - % compounds according to the formula (I) and (II) and (III) is 100 weight - %.<br>
Preferably the compositions according to the invention comprise 15 weight - % to 60 weight - % of a compound according to the formula (I) and 15 weight - % to 60 weight -% of a compound according to the formula (II) and 15 weight - % to 60 weight - % of a compound according to the formula (III) with the proviso the sum of the weight - % compounds according to the formula (I) and (II) and (III) is 100 weight - %.<br>

-	% of a compound according to the formula (III) with the proviso the sum of the weight<br>
-	% compounds according to the formula (I) and (II) and (III) is 100 weight - % .<br>
The dyes according to the formula (I) or (II) or (III) may also be in their salt form.<br>
The invention also provides a process for preparing compositions according to the invention. The dyestuffs according to the formula (I) and (II) and (III) may be mixed in<br><br>
the dye bath or may be mixed as powders or as formulations before being dissolved in the dye bath.<br>
The compositions according to the invention are particularly suitable for dyeing or printing fibrous material consisting of natural or synthetic polyamides in blue shades. The mixtures according to the invention and their salts are suitable for producing inkjet printing inks and for using these inkjet printing inks to print fibrous material which consists of natural or synthetic polyamides.<br>
A further aspect is the use of the compositions according to the invention for dyeing or printing fibrous materials consisting of natural or synthetic polyamides. A further aspect is the production of printing inks and printing pastes for screen or spray printing and their use for printing fibrous materials consisting of natural or synthetic polyamides.<br>
The non impact printing process comprises the spray printing process and ink jet printing process.<br>
In a printing process according to the invention, multicoloured designs/patterns are produced by screen or spray printing.<br>
The substrates can be printed on flatbed screen printing machines or rotary screen printing machines, which allow the highest production speeds (30 - 50 m/min). The spray printing machines, ChromoJet™ (J. Zimmer Maschinenbau GmbH, 9020 Klagenfurt, Austria) or Millitron™ (Milliken &amp; Company, Spartanburg, SC 29304, USA), similar in principle to an ink-jet printer, run at lower speeds but are preferred, if more flexibility in terms of design possibilities and design change is desired. After colour application the prints are run through a horizontal steamer for 3 - 10 (preferably 4 to 6) min in saturated steam for colour fixation, followed by water rinsing, hydro-extraction, and drying.<br>
Possibilities of printing, especially for mats and carpets, include the continuous or batch dyeing process and also the non impact printing or the classic printing. The non impact<br>
printing comprises the spraying of the dyes or formulations of the dyes by the ChromoJet™ process,; Militron™ process or other processes (M. Peter and H.K. Rouette: "Grundlagen der Textilveredelung; Handbuch der Technologic, Verfahren und Maschinen", thirteenth, revised edition, 1989, Deutscher Fachverlag GmbH, Frankfurt/Main, Germany, ISBN 3-87150-277-4, pages 484 to 492 (chapter 7.221.1) and page 846 and Figure 8.70).<br>
A typical printing paste for the ChromoJet™ printing or Militron™ printing comprises 0.1 to 50 g/kg of the dyestuff composition according to the invention, 600 g/kg stock thickener (The stock thickener composition comprising 2-20 g/kg of synthetic thickener with tixotropic behaviour; Dispersing/Wetting agent 1 - 5 g/kg (e.g. Sandogen® WAF liq.); 1 - 2 g/kg pH Buffer (e.g. Sandacid® PB liq.) and 0.2 - 1 g/kg of an anti foam agent, preferably a silicon anti foam agent (e.g. Antimussol® UP liq.) leading to a stock thickener of a viscosity of 6000 cps / pH 6 -7 (measured at 20°C with a Haake™ VT-02 Viskometer using "Spindel Nr. 3" (Rotor Nr. 3) (HAAKE™ is a brand name of Thermo Electron Corporation.).) and the pH is set to 5.5 - 11.5 using Caustic soda or Sandacid® PB liq. as pH controle agent. If needed addition of Sandogen® WAf liq. or Antimussol® UP liq. is added until a viscosity of 120 to 800 cps mesasured as described above is reached. After ChromoJet printing the fabric or carpet, the fixation of the print is done at 90 to 120 °C (by preference at 102°C) with saturated steam during 4-10 min., afterwards the printed product is rinsed. (Sandogen® and Sandacid® are registered trademarks of Novartis AG, Basle, Switzerland, licensed to Clariant AG, 4132 Muttenz, Switzerland ; Antimussol® is a registered trademark of Clariant AG, 4132 Muttenz, Switzerland).<br>
Dyeing is carried out as per known processes, see for example the dyeing processes described in Ullmanns Encyklopadie der technischen Chemie, 4th Edition, 1982, Volume 22, pages 658-673 or in the book by M. Peter and H.K. Rouette, Grundlagen der Textilveredlung, 13th Edition, 1989, pages 535-556 and 566-574. Preference is given to dyeing in the continuous process at a temperature of 30 to 100°C, more preferably 80 to 100°C, and at a liquor ratio in the range from 3:1 to 40:1.<br>
By preference the substrates dyed on continuous dyeing machines. In the continuous process, dye liquor is poured evenly over the substrate, especially the carpet, running below. After colour application, the carpet runs into a steamer were it is heated with saturated steam for 2 - 15 min, during which the dyes are fixed onto the fibre. Water rinsing, hydro-extraction, and drying follow. Alternatively, the substrates are dyed with the batch method. In the generally less productive batch method, substrates are dyed in winches (becks). Here, a section of substrate runs in a loop through a full dye bath with temperatures up to boiling point for 40 - 60 min.<br>
The substrate to be dyed can be present in the form of yarn, woven fabric, loop-formingly knitted fabric or carpet for example. Fully fashioned dyeings are even permanently possible on delicate substrates, examples being lambswool, cashmere, alpaca and mohair.<br>
The dyes according to the present invention and their salts are highly compatible with known acid dyes. Accordingly, the mixture according to the invention and their salts or mixtures can be used alone in a dyeing or printing process or else as a component in a combination shade dyeing or printing composition together with other acid dyes of the same class, i.e. with acid dyes possessing comparable dyeing properties, such as for example fastness properties and exhaustion rates from the dye bath onto the substrate. The dyes of the present invention can be used in particular together with certain other dyes having suitable chromophores. The ratio in which the dyes are present in a combination shade dyeing or printing composition is dictated by the hue to be obtained.<br>
The novel dye compositions according to the invention, as stated above, are very useful for dyeing natural and synthetic polyamides, i.e. wool, silk and all nylon types, on each of which dyeings having a high fastness level. The dye composition according to the invention have a high rate of exhaustion and fixation. The ability of the dye composition according to the invention and their salts to build up is likewise good. On-tone dyeings on the identified substrates are of outstanding quality. All dyeings moreover have a constant hue under artificial light. Furthermore, the fastness to decating and boiling is good.<br>
One decisive advantage of the compositions according to the invention is the stability of the stock solutions and dyeing liquors produced therewith.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can be used as an individual dye or else, owing to their good compatibility, as a combination element with other dyes of the same class having comparable dyeing properties, for example with regard to general fastnesses, exhaustion value, etc. The combination shade dyeings obtained have similar fastnesses to dyeings with the individual dye.<br>
The composition according to the invention can also be used as blue components in trichromatic dyeing or printing. Trichromatic dyeing or printing can utilize all customary and known dyeing and printing processes, such as for example the continuous process, exhaustion process, foam dyeing process and ink-jet process.<br>
The composition of the individual dye components in the trichromatic dye mixture used in the process of the invention depends on the desired hue. A brown hue for example preferably utilizes 55 - 65% by weight of the invention's blue component, 20 - 30% by weight of a red component and 10 - 20% by weight of a yellow component.<br>
In the examples which follow, parts and percentages are by weight and temperatures are reported in degrees Celsius.<br>
