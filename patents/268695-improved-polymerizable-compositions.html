				<td>IMPROVED POLYMERIZABLE COMPOSITIONS<br>
The present invention relates to a process for providing improved polymerizable compositions containing phosphoalkyl (meth)acrylate monomers which are synthesized by the reaction of a hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylate with polyphosphoric acid (PPA).<br>
When subjected to co-polymerization with other vinyl monomers, phosphoalkyl (meth)acrylates impart useful properties to polymers, namely those which are employed in coatings and binders and which have a wide range of uses. One application for these monomers is the promotion of polymeric coating adhesion to metal substrates. Other uses include providing flame-retardant and anti-static properties to fibers and binders for non-woven fabrics.<br>
Phosphoalkyl (meth)acrylate monoester, i.e., the phosphate monoester, is synthesized by the phosphorylation reaction between a hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylate and PPA having strength of 105 to 120% weight equivalents of H3PO4. (For example, the stoichiometric hydrolysis of 100 g of 115% PPA yields 115 g H3PO4.) This reaction also yields phosphate diester side-product and byproduct phosphoric acid.<br>
Typically, the phosphorylation mixture, or a dilution thereof, is used without purification in the polymer synthesis reaction. The diester and phosphoric acid, however, are not desired components, as the impact of these impurities complicates the polymerization process and affects the polymer product. The diester is a polymer crosslinker, and while crosslinkers are commonly used in polymerizations on purpose, it is preferred to control crosslinker levels independently from other polymerization raw materials. Unwanted diester can increase polymer thickening during the polymerization process and while applying as a coating, thus making the polymer much more difficult to apply. For these reasons, minimization of the phosphoalkyl di(meth)acrylate in the phosphorylation mixture is preferred. Phosphoric acid increases the acidity of the polymerization and can cause a water sensitivity of the resulting polymer coating. Purification to isolate the monoester or increase its content requires substantial solvent extraction, which incurs significant processing costs. Thus, phosphorylation processes<br>
that increase selectivity towards the monoester and reduce phosphoric acid levels are needed.<br>
Reduced levels of phosphoric acid in the polymerization composition can be achieved by using higher PPA grades, such as 118% or 120%, versus, for example, the 115% grade demonstrated in US 3,855,364, and ensuring an excess of the hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylate substrate. To improve a given composition, the reaction is conducted with the increased PPA grade while at least controlling the mole ratio of the hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylate relative to the average number of phosphoric acid anhydride units present in the PPA. Increased activity (i.e., increased anhydride content) of the higher PPA grades requires less PPA by mass for a given mole ratio, and the absolute amount of phosphoric acid byproduct is reduced.<br>
Typically, hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylate phosphate ester synthesis reactions such as the one disclosed in US 3,855,364, contain 55 to 75 wt.% monoester and 10 to 25 wt.% diester, when 1 to 2 moles of hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylate are reacted with 1 P2O5-mole equivalent of PPA. Specifically, US 3,855,364 discloses a polymerizable composition of matter containing 60 wt.% hydroxyethyl methacrylate phosphate monoester (MW 210) and 19 wt.% of the corresponding diester (MW 322), resulting in a monoester:diester mole ratio of 4.8. This ratio is unfavorable due to significant presence of the diester, and higher monoester: diester ratio compositions are preferred.<br>
A known means of increasing the phosphorylation selectivity towards the phosphate monoester is lowering the reaction temperature. In a neat system, the ability to lower temperature is constrained, however, due to issues around increased viscosity. The material can become too viscous, when cooled, to achieve good mixing. Another limitation with reducing temperature is that, while doing so improves monoester selectivity, it simultaneously lowers the rate of formation of monoester and diester.<br>
Another problematic aspect of these phosphorylation mixtures relates to high viscosity. The PPA raw material, the reaction mixture, and the reaction product have high viscosities, which slow mass transfer and pose general material handling problems. One solution to lower the product viscosity is to conduct the reaction in the presence of a solvent or to dilute the final reaction product with a solvent. Reference JP 2006-001863A states that inert, aprotic solvents, such as aromatics and saturated aliphatics, are<br>
solvents for the phosphorylation reaction. The use of such solvents, however, is unfavorable due to their lack of contribution to the application properties for polymers and formulated polymers (e.g. paints, adhesives, coatings, etc.) containing the phosphate monoester, and therefore such solvents need to be removed. Costly processing time to remove the solvent is incurred, and when the solvent is removed, the problematic viscosity of the composition returns.<br>
The present invention solves these problems of the art by increasing the monoester:diester mole ratio of the polymerizable reaction product by a process that advantageously uses the same basic, low-cost raw materials and avoids costly purification to increase the monoester content and avoids the need for solvent removal. According to this invention, the phosphorylation reaction is conducted in the presence of a reaction solvent, specifically a polymerizable solvent or a protic organic solvent, i.e., a carboxylic acid containing-solvent. The process for conducting the reaction may be batch or continuous. Significant improvements can be made even at low solvent levels, such as at about 15 wt.%, which is especially beneficial for batch processes in that good reactor productivity can be maintained.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for providing improved polymerizable compositions comprising reacting at least one hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylate with at least one polyphosphoric acid in the presence of at least one solvent wherein the at least one solvent is either a polymerizable solvent or a protic organic solvent.<br>
With proper choice of polymerizable solvent, the solvent will incorporate into the polymer matrix and become part of the final polymer product. With proper choice of protic organic solvent, the solvent will replace like additives often employed during final product formulation (e.g. formic acid, acetic acid, long-chain fatty acids, or their corresponding salts) where, again, the solvent will be a necessary part of the final product composition (e.g. paint formulation). In either case of selecting polymerizable solvents or protic organic solvents, there is no need to remove the solvent after the phosphorylation reaction. The reaction pressure is selected, according to the choice of solvent and reaction temperature, to ensure that boiling of the reaction mixture is suppressed. Thus, the reaction pressure should exceed the vapor pressure of the reaction mixture.<br>
As used herein, polymerizable solvent is meant any olefinically polymerizable species with solvent-bearing properties that is capable of polymerizing with the phosphoalkyl methacrylate in the polymerizable composition's application except that the hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylate monomers employed in the reaction and the phosphoalkyl methacrylate product itself are excluded from the present definition of polymerizable reactive solvent. Preferably, the solvent and temperature are selected to allow atmospheric reaction pressure.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, the reaction is conducted in the presence of at least one polymerizable solvent. These polymerizable solvents, or "diluent monomers," do not need to be removed from the reaction mixture prior to use in the final application. These solvents are used at 10 to 90 wt.% of the final reaction mixture. Suitable examples of polymerizable solvents include but are not limited to acrylic and methacrylic acids, C1 -C20 linear, branched, or cyclic alkyl esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid including but not limited to heterocyclic (meth)acrylates (such as 3-oxazolidinyl ethyl methacrylate, 5-[2-oxazolinyl]-pentyl methacrylate); aminoalkyl (meth)acrylates (such as N,N-dimethyl amino-ethyl acrylate, N,N-diethyl amino-propyl methacrylate); (meth)acrylamides (such as N-methyl acrylamide, N,N-dimethylaminopropyl methacrylamide); epoxide-containing (meth)acrylates (such as glycidyl (meth)acrylate); unsaturated alkyl and cycloalkyl (meth)acrylates (such as vinyl acrylate, allyl methacrylate, 2,4-hexadienyl methacrylate and dicyclopentenyl oxyethyl methacrylate); silicon-containing (meth)acrylates (such as trimethoxysilylpropyl acrylate, diethoxymethylsilylpropyl methacrylate, ispropoxydimethylsilylpropyl acrylate); aromatic (meth)acrylates (such as benzyl acrylate, phenyl acrylate, 4-chlorophenylethyl methacrylate); straight chain or branched haloalkyl (meth)acrylates (such as 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl acrylate, hexafluoroisopropyl methacrylate); terminal alkenes (such as 1-butene, 1-hexene, vinyl -cyclohexene); aralkenes (such as styrene, a-methyl styrene, 4-methyl styrene, 4-methoxy styrene); heterocyclic alkenes (such as 2-, 3-, or 4-vinyl pyridines and N-vinyl imidazole); dienes (such as butadiene, isoprene, vinylidene chloride); vinyl halides (such as vinyl chloride, tetrafluoroethylene); vinyl esters (such as vinyl acetate, vinyl benzoate); vinyl ketones (such as methyl vinyl ketone); vinyl amides (such as N-vinyl formamide, N-vinyl acetamide); vinyl isocyanate; aldehyde containing vinyl functionality<br>
(such as acrolein, methacrolein, and their acetal derivatives); epoxyalkenes (such as 3,4-epoxybut-1-ene); cyano containing vinyl functionality (such as acylonitrile, methacrylonitrile and fumaronitrile); vinyl silanes and alkoxyvinyl-silanes (such as vinyltrimethoxysilane, vinyltrimethylsilane, vinyldiethoxymethylsilane); unsaturated diesters (such as dimethylmaleate, dibutylfumarate, diethyl itaconate); and functional (meth)acrylates (such as isocyanotoethyl methacrylate, acryloylchloride, aceto acetoxyethyl methacrylate, acryloylpropionic acid [AOPA]);   or mixtures thereof.<br>
Specifically, it is surprising that these polymerizable solvents can be employed as solvents for this reaction due to their propensity to undergo Michael-type addition, via the olefinic double bond, with hydroxy-containing species, i.e., the hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylate reaction substrate. Of principal concern for making the subject polymerizable compositions is the loss of monoester yield on the hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylate substrate due to consumption of the latter via these Michael reactions. In the present reaction systems employing polymerizable solvents, the monoester yield was maintained and in many cases, such as for the use of methyl methacrylate, was actually found to increase.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the reaction is conducted in the presence of at least one protic organic solvent, for example a low molecular weight carboxylic acid, or a mixture of carboxylic acids. When a carboxylic acid solvent is present in an amount equal to 10 to 90 wt.% of the final reaction mixture, the phosphate monoestendiester mole ratio is increased relative to conducting the reaction neat. Suitable acids include C1 - C20 carboxylic acids.<br>
Furthermore, in another aspect of the present invention, polymerizable solvent(s) and protic organic solvent(s) are combined in the process as co-solvents. Thus, in the present invention, a mixture of (meth)acrylic acids, (meth)acrylic alkyl ester(s) and/or protic organic solvent(s) may be present in the reaction system.<br>
In still another aspect of the present invention, use of at least one polymerizable solvent or at least one protic organic solvent can be combined with lowering the temperature of the reaction to achieve a multiplicative selectivity enhancement. For an example employing hydroxyalkyl methacrylate, separately-achieved relative increases in monoestendiester ratio were 67% and 17%, respectively, for i) reducing the neat reaction<br>
temperature from 65 °C to 45 °C and for ii) conducting the 65 °C reaction in the presence methyl methacrylate at 17 wt.% of the reaction mixture versus the neat reaction. The combined ratio increase for conducting the reaction at 45 °C with 17 wt.% methyl methacrylate was 105% relative to the neat reaction at 65 °C, which exceeded the sum of increases for temperature reduction and solvent use alone.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
A reaction apparatus comprising a 500 mL, jacketed, glass "resin kettle" reaction flask; a two-stage agitator; and a reflux condenser was assembled. Heating and cooling were affected by means of a Thermo Scientific NESLAB RTE 740 circulator bath, which supplied Dynalene HF-LO heat transfer fluid to the reactor jacket. The bath temperature was adjusted to achieve the desired reactor temperature. The two-stage agitator comprised a bottom blade set (3-in. diameter, four-blade, 45-deg. pitch) and a middle blade set (2.5-in. diameter, three-blade, swept pitch), which was positioned at two-thirds of the reactor's straight-side height from the bottom. A thermocouple, a sparge gas tube, and a feed tube were positioned near the top of the bottom agitator blade set. The condenser was vented to the atmosphere via a drying tube.<br>
In a separate feed vessel, a reservoir of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, having less than 0.15 wt.% water, was adjusted to contain by weight 1950 ppm methoxyphenol. Polyphosphoric acid (115% grade, 400 g) was charged to the empty reaction flask. A 10 seem flow of 8% O2/92% N2 mixed gas was then introduced to the reactor via the sparge tube.
