Process  and equipment for recovery of valuable materials  from terephthalic acid manufacture<br><br>
APPLICANTS<br>
Reliance Industries Limited, Maker Chambers IV, Nariman Point, Mumbai 400021, Maharashtra, India<br>
PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process and equipment for recovery of valuable materials from terephthalic acid manufacture.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Terephthalic acid is manufactured by liquid-phase oxidation of/^-xylene with air over cobalt-manganese-bromide catalyst system (cobalt acetate, manganese acetate, and hydrogen bromide) in acetic acid at 150 to 210 °C. The relative weight ratio of cobalt, manganese and bromine are important, and the typical values are manganese: cobalt ratio 3:1 and cobalt: bromine ratio 1:5. In the reactor and crystallizer of the terephthalic acid manufacturing plant, most of the terephthalic acid crystallizes out from the mother liquor and is separated by filtration. The mother liquor comprises mainly acetic acid and organic compounds like isopthalic acid, benzoic acid and terephthalic acid, and inorganic compounds like cobalt and manganese along with iron, nickel, chromium and sodium. It is a common practice to recycle a large portion of the recovered mother liquor to the oxidation reaction in order to recover the catalyst partially and promote the oxidation reaction while purging a small portion to a solvent recovery system so as to maintain the level of impurities and by-products in the reaction withiri tolerable limits. In the solvent recovery system, mother liquor purge is subjected to evaporation to remove considerable portion of acetic acid and water leaving behind a concentrate containing organic compounds together with heavy metal catalysts. The concentrate hereinreferred to as reactor effluent is disposed of by incineration usually in furnaces.<br><br><br>
