As examples of groups protecting the amino function, there may be mentioned tert-butyl or methyl carbamates which may be regenerated using iodotrimethylsilane or allyl using palladium catalysts. As examples of groups protecting the hydroxyl function, there may be mentioned triethylsilyl and tert-butyldimethylsilyl which may be regenerated using tetrabutylammonium fluoride or alternatively asymmetric acetals (methoxymethyl or tetrahydropyranyl for example) with regeneration using hydrochloric acid. As groups protecting carboxyl functions, there may be mentioned esters (allyl or benzyl for example), oxazoles and 2-alkyl-l,3-oxazolines. Other protecting groups which can be used are described by GREENE T.W. et al. , Protecting Groups<br><br>

After filtration, the paste obtained is dried under reduced pressure at a temperature in the region of 40°C. 5.52 g of N-azetidin-3-yl-3,5-difluorobenzenesulfonamide hydrochloride are thus obtained in the form of a white powder.<br>
N-(l-benzhydrylazetidin-3-yl)-3,5-difluorobenzenesulfonamide may be prepared in the following manner: 5.1 g of 3,5-difluorobenzenesulfonyl chloride and then 4.2 cm3 of triethylamine are successively added to a suspension of 5 g of l-benzhydrylazetidin-3-ylamine in 80 cm3 of dichloromethane, at a temperature in the region of 20°C. After stirring for 20 hours at a temperature in the region of 20°C, 50 cm3 of water are added. The organic phase separated after settling is washed with twice 50 cm3 of water, dried over magnesium sulfate, and<br><br>
concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure. 8.99 g of a yellow oil are thus obtained, which oil crystallizes little by little. 4.5 g of this product is purified by chromatography under pressure on 500 g of Ainicon silica (diameter of the particles from 0.020 to 0.045 mm), eluting with a methanol-dichloromethane (1-99 by volume) mixture. The fractions containing the desired product are combined and concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure-to give 3.58 g of N-(l-benzhydrylazetidin-3-yl)-3,5-difluorobenzene-sulfonamide in the form of a beige powder. The remaining quantity of the preceding yellow oil is purified under the same conditions and provides 3.92 g of N-(l-benzhydrylazetidin-3-yl)-3,5-difluorobenzene-sulfonamide in the form of a beige powder.<br>
