It is understood for persons skilled in the art that, to carry out the processes according to the invention which are described above, it may be necessary to introduce groups protecting amino, hydroxyl and carboxyl functions in order to avoid side reactions. These groups are those which allow removal without affecting the rest of the molecule. As examples of groups protecting the amino function, there may be mentioned tert-butyl or methyl carbamates which may be regenerated using iodotrimethylsilane or allyl using palladium catalysts. As examples of groups protecting the hydroxyl function, there may be mentioned triethylsilyl and tert-butyldimethylsilyl which may be regenerated using tetrabutylammonium fluoride or alternatively asymmetric acetals (methoxymethyl or tetrahydropyranyl for example) with regeneration using hydrochloric acid. As groups protecting carboxyl functions, there may be mentioned esters (allyl or benzyl for example), oxazoles and 2-alkyl-l,3-oxazolines. Other protecting groups which can be used are described by GREENE T.W. et al. , Protecting Groups<br><br>

disorders (bulimia, anorexia), obesity, memory disorders, in weaning from chronic treatments and alcohol or drug abuse (opioids, barbiturates, cannabis, cocaine, amphetamine, phencyclide, hallucinogens, benzodiazepines for example), as analgesics or potentiators of the analgesic activity of the narcotic and nonnarcotic drugs. They may also be used for the treatment or prevention of intestinal transit.<br>
The affinity of the compounds of formula (I) for the cannabis .receptors has been determined according to the method described by KUSTER J.E., STEVENSON J-. I . , WARD S.J., D' AMBRA T.E., HAYCOCK D.A. in J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 264 1352-1363 (1993).<br>
In this test, the ICso of the compounds of formula (I) is less than or equal to 1000 nM.<br>
Their antagonist activity has been shown by means of the model of hypothermia induced by an agonist of the cannabis receptors (CP-55940) in mice, according to the method described by Pertwee R.G. in Marijuana, Harvey D.J. eds, 84 Oxford IRL Press, 263-277 (1985).<br>
In this test, the ED50 of the compounds of formula (I) is less than or equal to 50 mg/kg.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) exhibit low toxicity. Their LD50 is greater than 40 mg/kg by the subcutaneous route in mice.<br>

The suspension is filtered, and the solid residue is again beaten with 100 cm3 of diethyl ether at a temperature in the region of 20Â°C. After filtration, the paste obtained is dried under reduced pressure at a temperature in the region of 40Â°C. 5.52 g of N-azetidin-3-yl-3,5-difluorobenzenesulfonamide hydrochloride are thus obtained in the form of a white powder.<br>
N-(l-benzhydrylazetidin-3-yl)-3,5-difluorobenzenesulfonamide may be prepared in the following manner: 5.1 g of 3,5-difluorobenzenesulfonyl chloride and then 4.2 cm3 of triethylamine are successively added to a suspension of 5 g of l-benzhydrylazetidin-3-ylamine in 80 cm3 of dichloromethane, at a temperature in the region of 20Â°C. After stirring for 20 hours at a temperature in the region of 20Â°C, 50 cm3 of water are added. The organic phase separated after settling is washed with twice 50 cm3 of water, dried over magnesium sulfate, and<br><br>
concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure. 8.99 g of a yellow oil are thus obtained, which oil crystallizes little by little. 4.5 g of this product is purified by chromatography under pressure on 500 g of Ainicon silica (diameter of the particles from 0.020 to 0.045 mm), eluting with a methanol-dichloromethane (1-99 by volume) mixture. The fractions containing the desired product are combined and concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure-to give 3.58 g of N-(l-benzhydrylazetidin-3-yl)-3,5-difluorobenzene-sulfonamide in the form of a beige powder. The remaining quantity of the preceding yellow oil is purified under the same conditions and provides 3.92 g of N-(l-benzhydrylazetidin-3-yl)-3,5-difluorobenzene-sulfonamide in the form of a beige powder.<br>
