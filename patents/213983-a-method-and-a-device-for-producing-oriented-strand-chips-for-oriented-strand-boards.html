				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method as well as a device for producing wood chips.<br>
For this, there are basically two systems, which differ fundamentally from each<br>
other and which, accordingly, also produce different products.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A first system relates to so-called direct chippers. In it uncut round timber is fed<br>
into a chute. Arranged parallel to the axis along which the wood is fed is a knife<br>
ring, which is equipped along its circumference with a large number of knives.<br>
The cutting edges of the knives run parallel to the knife ring. The knife ring can<br>
move in such a way that it plunges into the body of the round timber and is able<br>
to chip it. See, for example,<br>
DE 2,947,199 Cl.<br>
Another design of direct chippers which belongs to the first system mentioned,<br>
has a disk that is mounted so that it can pivot. The disk carries chipping knives<br>
on one of its side faces. The round timber or tree stumps are fed to this working<br>
face in a direction parallel to the fibers. Because the circumferential speeds of<br>
the individual face elements of the working face differ in magnitude depending<br>
on whether the face element lies radially inward or radially outward, the chipping<br>
result also differs and this is detrimental to the quality.<br>
The machines mentioned, which belong to the first system, serve above all, to<br>
produce so-called oriented strand (OS) chips. The first of these chips are<br>
oriented along the lengthwise direction of the chip. The chip is extremely thin. It<br>
serves to produce boards of the same name, so-called oriented strand boards<br>
(OSB). These are regarded as being of high quality. They have great strength, so<br>
that they can be used as construction elements for the construction of<br>
prefabricated houses, for example.<br>
The second system mentioned uses so-called knife chippers. These consist of a<br>
ring or collar that is made up of knives, whose cutting edges run, at least largely,<br>
parallel to the ring axis. The knife encloses a working chamber in which the<br>
chippers are introduced into a radially inner region through a filling shaft. A rotor<br>
spins the chippings radially outward against the inner face of the knife and thus<br>
against the cutting edges of the knives, where chipping takes place.<br>
The intermediate product that is fed to the chipper consists of appreciably<br>
smaller particles, namely, chippings, that were produced beforehand in a<br>
chopping process. In quite generalized terms, they have , at least to an<br>
approximation, the size of a match box.<br>
The chips that can be produced by a knife ring chipper differ quite fundamentally<br>
from the OS chips produced by the first-mentioned category of machines, which<br>
operate according to the first-mentioned system. They are essentially pin-shaped<br>
and are reminiscent of thin matches. These chips can be processed only into<br>
chipboards or particle boards. However particle boards are of only limited<br>
strength and, in particular, they have no special flexural strength. Thus, they<br>
cannot be used as construction elements, but instead find application in the<br>
furniture industry.<br>
The advantages and drawbacks of machines of the first-mentioned system -<br>
direct chippers for producing OS chips - and of the second-mentioned system<br>
with the preceding stage for producing chippings and the final result of chips for<br>
particle boards can be summarized as follows:<br>
Direct chippers require, in general, fresh wood, that is, tree trunks of, for<br>
example one meter. Although they are capable of producing high-quality OS<br>
chips, they have comparatively large dimensions on account of the large<br>
dimensions of the intermediate product. Accordingly, it is extremely expensive to<br>
purchase them. The investment costs lie between one and three million DM.<br>
Accordingly, they also have relatively little flexibility in use.<br>
Chippers, by contrast, are smaller, more flexible, and more advantageous in cost<br>
to purchase. However, they are not capable of producing OSB chips, but only the<br>
lower-quality matchlike chips for particle boards.<br>
US A-2 874909 (LUDWIG PALLMANN) discloses a process for producing oriented<br>
strand towards comprising the steps of : producing an initial product from<br>
recycled wood, said initial product is substantially rod-shaped and fed to a<br>
chipper comprising a large number of knives disposed on a knife disc which have<br>
cutting edges extending parallel to the disc axis and surround a working area;<br>
said initial product is rotated about the knife disc axis and is aligned so that it is<br>
substantially parallel to the disc axis and presses with centrifugal force against<br>
the cutting edges of the knives; the operating parameters are selected so as to<br>
produce a particle thickness; the initial product is subjected to a draw cut and<br>
the chips are processed to from oriented strand boards.<br>
OBJECT OF INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention is to present a method and a device that allows so-<br>
called fresh wood as well as recycled wood to be used as intermediate product,<br>
has appreciably less construction volume than the known direct chippers,<br>
therefore requires lower investment costs, and is flexible in use and that is also<br>
fundamentally suitable for producing OSB chips.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The inventor has thus freed himself of a widely held prejudice. He has resorted<br>
to the basic features of the knife ring chipper, but has fundamentally changed<br>
the conditions surrounding it. This relates, in particular, to the choice of the<br>
dimensions of the intermediate product. The later has a greater first dimension<br>
than the dimension perpendicular to it, so that the intermediate product could be<br>
referred to as rod-shaped.<br>
With a method is accordance with the invention and a corresponding device, it is<br>
now possible to use highly differing intermediate products, namely, both fresh<br>
wood of excellent quality and fresh wood of less good quality, such as dwarf<br>
timber and branches, as well as recycled wood. Coming into consideration here<br>
as recycled wood is, for example, wood packaging, which is very common.<br>
The method and device in accordance with the invention can-as mentioned -<br>
produce high-quality OSB chips, but, at the same time, also chips of lesser<br>
quality. If different categories of chips are produced, these can be classified by a<br>
subsequent classification step.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The invention is explained in more detail on the basis of the accompanying<br>
drawings. Represented therein individually are the following:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a chipper in a front view, that is, in a view on that side on which<br>
the casing cover together with the spout for the intermediate product is situated.<br>
Fig. 2 shows on an enlarged scale, an axial section of the chipper in accordance<br>
with Fig. 1.<br>
Fig. 3 shows in an enlarged representation, a section taken from Fig. 2. namely,<br>
a knife set.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF<br>
INVENTION<br>
As seen from Figures 1 and 2 individually, the chipper consists of a rotor, which<br>
is driven by a shaft 2. The rotor 1 contains a collar of blades 3, which are parallel<br>
to the axis. A knife box with knives 4, which are likewise arranged parallel to the<br>
axis, surrounds the rotor 1. Rotor 1 and the knife box are, in turn, arranged in a<br>
casing 5 and jointly enclosed by it. Casing 5 has an inlet 6 for the chipping that<br>
are to be fed in as well as a discharge for the finished chips.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a rod-shaped intermediate product 20 at two sites. In the<br>
present case, this is delivered as a block in the shape of a regular rectangle.<br>
Instead, however, this intermediate product could be of a different shape - for<br>
example, it could have irregular peripheral surfaces. It is essential only that this<br>
intermediate product 20 be more or less rod-shaped that is, it has a lengthwise<br>
dimension that is greater than the crosswise dimensions in planes running<br>
perpendicular to it.<br>
The intermediate product 20 is fed into the shaft-shaped inlet 6 - see arrow. It<br>
then arrives at the inner chamber that is enclosed by the rotor 1. In doing so,<br>
the intermediate product 20 comes to lie - either automatically or by means of a<br>
corresponding orienting device - in such a way that it is oriented mainly along<br>
the lengthwise axis of the rotor shaft 2 and thus more or less parallel to the<br>
knives 4. The intermediate product is of substantial length in comparison with<br>
the chipping that re fed to the knife ring chippers that have been commonly used<br>
up to now.<br>
In figures 3 and 4, two knife sets are represented in a section perpendicular to<br>
the axis. These two knife sets are each a component of the knife ring of the<br>
machine.<br>
Each knife set is constructed as follows: A supporting bedplate 10 bears cutting<br>
knife 11, which is attached to the supporting bedplate 10 by means of a<br>
clamping plate 12 and a screw 13.<br>
Each supporting bedplate 10 has a wear surface 10.1. It is crucial that these<br>
wear surfaces 10.1, which face the machine axis, are nearly flat and thus not<br>
concentric, as in the prior art.<br>
In the case of the figure here, the wear surface 10.1 is made up of a plate 10.2,<br>
which in turn, is attached to the remaining supporting bedplate 10. In the case<br>
of Figure 4, the wear surface 10.1 is made up of a wear layer that is produced by<br>
application of a wear layer, preferably by build-up welding or spraying and<br>
subsequent smooth grinding.<br>
In the embodiment in accordance with Figure 3, a knife with M teeth 14, is<br>
provided, which is attached to the side of the supporting bedplate 10 lying<br>
opposite to the cutting knife 11 and which works together with the cutting knife<br>
of the neighboring knife set. The embodiment in accordance with Figure 4 is an<br>
embodiment without knives with M teeth.<br>
