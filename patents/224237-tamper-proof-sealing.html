PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br><br>
"TAMPER PROOF SEALING"<br>
r<br>
The invention relates to a temper proof seal made from polycarbonate plastic material and having stainless steel twisted wire moulded itself in temper proof seal male and female part.<br>
ORDINERY PLASTIC/ LEAD SEALS<br>
Ordinary seals are made up of PP or HDP material having no UV resistance.<br>
Plastic/Lead seals are opaque so inside tempering cannot be easily visible.<br>
a)	Easy to tamper<br>
b)	Tamper attempts are not easily evident<br>
c)	Easy to re assemble usually Single wire<br>
d)	One can cut and change seal wire easily<br>
e)	Plastic seals can withstand to 120° C so it can be easily tamper by boiling<br>
Consecutive numbering is tough to do on lead seals. General plastic seals have printed or itching type number on male or female portion of the seals and it can be easily duplicated.<br>
Cheaper plastics quickly deteriorate due to weather and other harsh conditions lead seal suffer from corrosion made from single plastic material. Usually low quality.<br>
Tool require for lead seals as well as plastic seals.<br>
Impossible with lead seals. Ordinary Plastic seals do not offer this level of customization.<br>
Therefore there is a need to prevent such tempering of seal, the applicant has device a temper proof seal with double locking system using polycarbonate male female part which are push fit, the male part and the female part are connected by non-corosive and non- magnetic stainless steel wire which are moulded while making the seal<br>
To manufacture the temper proof seal first of all we have to pre heat the Polycarbonate plastic materials at 110 °Cin drier for three to four hours before using. And mean time Stainless steel wire is tested first in dimension and acid test and then it is twisted in twisting machine up to desired twist and then it is cut by cutter to required length.<br>
First we put pre heated Polycarbonate plastic materials granule in Vertical type molding machine and then mould of seal is been closed by hydraulic pressure of machine and then wire is insert in mould and then material is been injected in mould through moulds machine and hence temper proof seal is got ready.<br>
The emboss type numbering arrangement on male and side of female part of the temper proof seal is itself in the mould and the constructive numbering is obtain<br>
2<br><br>
in all The temper proof seals by automatic arrangement of numerator counter inserted in mould itself.<br>
Then these temper proof seals are tested by pullout test, Acidic test and then we shall supply as per client requirements and i.e. arranging in serially, tide with the steel wire forming a loop and the same shall be packed in polythene bag with labels furnishing sr. nos. of seal, packed in corrugated box.<br>

Figure (1) is the perspective view of temper proof seal.<br>
Referring to figure (1) a male part (1) and a female part (2) with base (3) and (4) respectively made from polycarbonate plastic material wherein the male part having V-shaped projection (5) and (6) with complementary groups (7) and (8) in the female parts for double locking in a push fit maimer said base member (3) of male part and the base member (4) of female part is mouldably connected by a double stand stainless steel twisted wire (9).<br>
Power unity has also started demanding the supply of meters with plastic seal. This type of seals are specially designed for the purpose of meter manufacturer considering easy operation, handling and low cost. The specially designed seals have in built seal wire. Once has to simply insert the seal wire end through hole via meter and insert male part into female part by applying pressure through thumb and it will be fitted permanently. The seal<br>
once fitted can not be removed unless it is broken or cut through sharp object. For sealing of seal no tool is required.<br>
The seals are available in (1) Polycarbonate material and (2) Polypropylene material as per the requirement of the client. The material used in polypropylene seal is of M/s. Reliance Industries Ltd. And for polycarbonate that of M/s. Du -Point, Singapore.<br>
