3. Preamble to the Description<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to the novel process for the synthesis of octreotide and derivatives thereof by solid phase peptide synthesis. In particular, the present invention relates to synthesis of protected linear peptides, cleavage from the resin, deprotection followed by cyclization process for the unprotected peptide wherein the preparation process is simple, easy, environment friendly, inexpensive with high yield and purity.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION:<br>
Octreotide is a highly potent and pharmacologically selective analog of somatostatin. It inhibits growth hormone for long duration and is thereof indicated for acromegaly to control and reduce the plasma level of growth hormone. The presence of D-Phe at the N-terminal and an amino alcohol at the C-terminal, along with D-Tryptophan and a cyclic structure makes it very resistant to metabolic degradation.<br>
Octreotide comprises 8 amino acids which has the following structural formula:<br>
(D)Phe-Cys-Phe-(D)Trp-Lys-Thr-Cys-Thr-OL<br>
S	S<br>
Formula(l)<br>
wherein sulphur atoms of the Cys at the position 2 and of the Cys at the position 7 are mono-cyclic to form an -S-S- bridge.<br>
A considerable number of known, naturally occurring small and medium-sized cyclic peptides as well as some of their artificial derivatives and analogs possessing<br>
2<br><br>
desirable pharmacological properties have been synthesized. However, wider medical use is often hampered due to complexity of their synthesis and purification. Therefore, improved methods for making these compounds in simple, lesser steps and at lesser cost are desirable and this is the felt need of the industry and the mankind.<br>
Conventional synthesis of octreotide may be divided into two main approaches, direct solid-phase synthesis and liquid-phase synthesis. Solution phase synthesis has been described by Bauer et al, (Sandoz) (Eur. Pat. Appl. 29,579 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,395,403). The process comprises: removing protected group from peptide; linking together by an amide bond two peptide unit; converting a function group at the N- or C-terminal; oxidizing a straight chain polypeptide by boron tristrifluoroacetate. This process involves a time-consuming, multi-step synthesis, and it is difficult to separate octreotide from the reaction mixtures since all the synthesis steps are carried out in liquid phase.Another solution phase approach described by Chaturvedi, et al., (Wockhardt) in U.S. Pat No. 6,987,167 and EP 1506219 A, claims the cyclization of partially deprotected octreotide in the solution phase using iodine under conditions and for a time sufficient to form the octreotide.<br>
Synthesis in solid phase have been described subsequently (Mergler et al, Alsina et al., Neugebauer). The above prior art for solid phase peptide synthesis cites the octapeptide formation, by starting the synthesis from the threoninol residue which makes it mandatory to protect this residue. Mergler et al., (Peptides: Chemistry and Biology. Proceedings of the 12th American Peptide Symposium. Smith,J.A. And Rivier J.E. Eds ESCOM, Leiden, Poster 292 Presentation, (1991)) describes a synthetic process, using an aminoethyl resin upon which the Threoninol residue is incorporated with the two alcohol functions protected in acetal form The synthesis is<br>
3<br><br>
carried out following an Fmoc/tBu protection scheme, forming the disulphide bridge on resin by oxidation of the thiol groups of the previously deprotected cysteine residues and releasing and deprotecting the peptide with a 20% mixture of TFA/DCM.<br>
In early 1997, Alsina J. et al. ( Alsina J., Chiva C, Ortiz M., Rabanal F, Giralt E., and Albericio F., Tetrahedron Letters, 38, 883-886, 1997) described the incorporation, on active carbonate resins, of a Jhreoninol residue with the amino group protected by the Boc group and the side chain protected by a Bzl group. The synthesis was then continued by Boc/Bzl strategy. Formation of the disulfide bridge was carried out directly on resin using iodine and the peptide was cleaved from the resin and its side chain protecting groups were simultaneously removed with HF/anisole 9/1. At the final stage the formyl group was removed with a piperidine/DMF solution.<br>
Neugebauer (Neugebauer W., Lefevre M.R., Laprise R, Escher E., Peptides: Chemistry, Structure and Biology, p 1017, Marshal G.R. And Rivier J.E. Eds. ESCOM.Leiden (1990) described a linear synthesis with a yield of only 7%.<br>
Edwards et al., (Edwards B.W., Fields C.G., Anderson C.J., Pajeau T.S., Welch M.J., Fields G.B., J.Med.Chem. 37, 3749-3757 (1994) carried out another another solid-phase type approximation; they synthesized step-by-step on the resin, the peptide D-Phe-Cys(Acm)-Phe-D-Trp(Boc)-Lys(Boc)-Thr(tBu)-Cys(Acm)-HMP-Resin.Next they proceeded to form the disulfide on resin and then release the peptide from the resin by means of aminolysis with threoninol, with obtaining a total yield of only 14%.<br>
4<br><br>
The solid phase synthesis described by Yao-Tsung Hsieh et. ah, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,476,186 involves the synthesis of octreotide by using Thr(ol)(tBu)-2Cl-trityl resin as starting material followed by the cleavage of the straight chain peptide from the resin by using a strong acid and the formation of the intra-molecular disulfide bond on the completely deprotected octreotide by oxidation using charcoal catalyst and a higher yield of &gt;70%.<br>
Another solid phase synthesis described by Berta Ponsati et.al (Lipotec) in U.S. Pat No. 6,346,601 and EP 0953577 B involve the coupling of threoninol on the protected heptapeptide in solution, after a selective acid cleavage from the chlorotrityl resin without affecting the peptide side-chain protecting groups.<br>
A hybrid solid phase-liquid phase method for synthesis of octreotide described by Iarov et al., (Dalton Chemical Laboratories) in WO 2005087794 wherein the method comprises liquid phase condensation of two or three peptide blocks in which at least one peptide block is synthesized by solid-phase method.<br>
EP 1511761 Bl involves cyclization on the semi-protected linear peptide wherein one of the cysteine residue is protected with an orthogonal protecting group.<br>
The radioactive isotope labeling of octreotide by the coupling of bifunctional chelating agents like DTPA or DOTA to the peptide was described by Te-Wei Lee et al, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,889,146 (Inst, of Nuclear Energy Research)<br>
The method for cyclization of linear vapreotide by means of intramolecular cysteine formation has been described by Quattrini et. al, (Lonza AG) in WO 2006048144,<br>
5<br><br>
wherein the process involves the synthesis of linear vapreotide peptide on Sieber-resin (from Novabiochem) by Fmoc standard groups, wherein the side chain protecting groups are D or L-Trp(Boc), Cys(Trt), Lys(Boc), Tyr(tBu). The protected peptide is cleaved off in 5% TFA in dichloromethane and then globally deprotected by acidolysis in a cleavage mix of 300 equivalents of concentrated TFA, 12 equivalents of Dithiothreitol, 12 equivalents of Dichloromethane, 50 equivalents of water fori hour at room temperature. The Boc groups are removed. The product was subjected to charcoal method using trace amounts of activated, powdered charcoal wherein a concentration of the linear cysteinyl peptide of 50 mg/ml (1 eq.) in DMF in the presence of 1 eq. Diisopropyl-ethyl-amine and that additionally air was sparged at low pressure into the liquid under stirring. After 15-20 hrs, 100% conversion was achieved with 84% (w/w) analytical yield of 79% vapreotide.<br>
The formation of intramolecular disulphide formation in a polypeptide by reacting with hydrogen peroxide has been described by Mineo Niwa et al. (Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co.) in U.S. Pat. No.5,102,985 wherein the reaction is to be carried out at a pH of about 6 to 11, wherein the molar ratio of H202 to polypeptide is within the range of 1:1 to 100:1.<br>
The above cited prior art mainly carries out the cyclization of the peptide on the resin or on partially protected or protected peptides. The use of partial or minimal protecting group strategies and improvement in the activation methods have considerable effect on limitations of poor solubility and possible danger of racemization due to the overactivation of carboxyl groups. However, these approaches do not overcome the problem of the poor coupling efficiency between<br>
6<br><br>
large peptide segments, because of the intrinsic difficulty of obtaining effective molar concentrations for high molecular weight molecules.<br>
OBJECT OF INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a novel process for synthesis of octreotide and derivatives thereof wherein the process uses mild reagents, isolates protected peptide by simple aqueous precipitation, avoids usage of hazardous thiol scavengers in the cleavage cocktail, achieves effective oxidation of deprotected peptide in the presence of hydrogen peroxde to yield a clean crude cyclic octapeptide at a purity of &gt;70% with an overall yield of 95%.<br>

Still another object of the invention is an improved process for cyclization of octreotide wherein the cyclization is carried out in the presence of hydrogen peroxide on a completely deprotected heptapeptide or octapeptide.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Synthesis of peptides on a solid support is a conventional method which has known advantages cited in the prior art. Impurities found with the desired peptide are derived from three sources: namely, coupling of amino acid derivatives to the growing peptide chain, cleavage of the peptide from the solid support, and deprotection of side-chains of the assembled sequence. Impurities often have small differences in structure such as the deletion of one amino acid residue resulting from a slow coupling reaction or a<br>
11<br><br>
rearranged/derivatized side-chain group formed during the cleavage of the peptide from the solid support. However, in addition to maintaining the purity of the peptide, a major challenge also is to substantially increase the yield or recovery of the peptide synthesized. Complexity increases with the synthesis of cyclic peptides. The preparation of cyclic peptide disulfides from the corresponding SH-precursors and the direct conversion of the cysteine-protected derivatives into cyclic products (deprotection of the -SH groups with simultaneous cyclization) are most widely used among the diversity of methods known for the synthesis of disulfide containing peptides. As a rule, in both cases, the cyclization is cunVao day nghe bai nay di ban <br><br>
hinhem.scrarried out in very dilute solutions, with the peptide concentration being of 1O4-10"5 M in order to avoid an intermolecular aggregation and side reactions. The directed formation of S-S bonds in the highly diluted solutions significantly depends on structural peculiarities of a peptide, in particular, on the nature of amino acid residues between Cys residues. The cyclization of free thiols by the air oxygen usually leads to low yields of target products (9-15%). In the air-oxidation process, the proceeding speed of the reaction progress itself is very slow, and especially, it hardly proceeds under denaturing condition, such as in a highly concentrated salt or urea.-aqueous solution of polypeptide. The application of potassium ferricyanide or dimethyl sulfoxide usually result in homogeneous reaction mixtures and the yields of cyclic products are considerably higher (from 20 to 60%, and, in some cases, up to 80%, which depends on the peptide structure). However, a multistage purification of product is necessary for the removal of excess of these oxidative agents. Moreover it produces the problem of environmental pollution, since the resultant waste Water contains CN". A very attractive one-step formation of the disulfide bridges by the action of iodine is often accompanied by side reactions and has only a limited use in the case of Tip- and Met-<br>

containing peptides.In the iodine-oxidation process, tyrosine residues in a peptide may be disadvantageous^ iodinated.<br>
An inherent feature of the present invention is provision of sufficiently homogenous reaction mixture and a simple, preferably one step isolation of octapeptide of &gt;70% purity which on subsequent chromatographic purification yields an octapeptide of &gt; 99% purity. More particularly the oxidation process is easily upscaled and is least cost intensive relatively lowering the manufacturing cost. Producing cyclized peptides with the correct structure can be achieved readily by either on-resin or post-cleavage techniques. On-resin techniques produce greater yields of the final products, but are more expensive to perform. However, post-cleavage techniques are less expensive and provide reasonable yields of the desired product. Another feature of the present invention is post-cleavage cyclization of the heptapeptide and subsequent coupling of threoninol or direct cyclization of the octapeptide to form cyclic octapeptide.<br>
The solid-phase synthesis of octreotide had several potential pitfalls that could reduce peptide assembly and cleavage efficiencies and/or resulted in deletereous side reactions. Potential problems included i) racemization of the C-terminal Cys residue, ii) inefficient disulfide bond formation on resin, iii) modification of Trp during disulfide bond formation, and iv) incomplete peptide-resin cleavage. Racemization during the esterification of the C-terminal amino acid or during the chain elongation is suppressed by several alternative techniques. One of the essential feature of the present invention wherein C-terminal Cys peptide is successfully synthesized without racemization by Fmoc based solid phase method using 2-chlorotrityl resin. The use of 2-Chlorotrityl resin circumvents the racemization at the C-terminal cysteine caused by the base treatment, probably due to its high steric hindrance.Another novel feature of<br>
13<br><br>
the present invention is cyclization of the fully deprotected heptapeptide or octapeptide.<br>
Iodine, however, is not without drawbacks as a cyclization agent. For instance, tryptophan moieties present in peptide substrates are at risk of being modified, making the balance between full conversion of starting materials and minimizing side reactions a delicate one, which, in turn, impacts product purity. In the present invention this aspect has been rightfully tackled by not opting for Iodine route for oxidative cyclization. Therefore the process of the present invention has a product of enhanced puirity and better yield. Another complicating factor in known synthesis routes is the possibility of interaction between the desired cyclic disulfide and inorganic sulfur compounds used for reducing excess iodine at the end of the reaction, such as sodium dithionite or sodium thiosulfate. Such reducing sulfur-containing compounds may interact with the disulfide linkage, which is sensitive to nucleophilic attack in general. As the process of the present invention does not use iodine, the resulting products have high purity and related impurities are undetectable.<br>
The solution phase route is more cumbersome as after each coupling the peptide has to be isolated, as compare to the solid phase route where the excess reagents and by products are washed off by simple filtration. In both, the desired peptide compound is created by the step-wise addition of amino acid moieties to a growing peptide chain. As compared to Boc-chemistry, Fmoc-chemistry based synthesis is a mild procedure and because of the base lability of Fmoc group, acid-labile side-chain protecting groups are employed giving an orthogonal protection strategy. The rationale for use of protecting groups is that the energy of breaking a bond of a protecting group is lower than any other group in question. Where appropriate, these are based on the tert-butyl moiety: tert-butyl ethers for Ser, Thr, tert-butyl esters for Asp, GIu and Boc for Lys,<br>
14<br><br>
His. The trt group has been extensively used for the protection of Cys. Also for Cys, the Acm group is extensively used when a protecting group on the sulfur needs to be maintained after the cleavage of the peptide. The guanidine group of Arg is protected by Mtr, Pmc or Pbf. Most Of the Fmoc-amino acids derivatives are commercially available. However, a problem exists in the art for the preparation of modified amino acid peptides as well as cyclic peptide compounds based on disulfide links because separate operations are required before purifying the end product, which increases expense and may effect final product quality and quantity.<br>
The purity of a peptide has several aspects. One is purity on the basis of an active-compound concentration scale. This is represented by the relative content of the pharmacologically active compound in the final product, which should be as high as possible. Another aspect is the degree of absence of pharmacologically active impurities, which though present in trace amounts only, may disturb or even render useless the beneficial action of the peptide when used as a therapeutic. In a pharmacological context both aspects have to be considered. As a rule, purification becomes increasingly difficult with larger peptide molecules. In homogeneous phase synthesis (which is the current method of choice for industrial production of larger amounts of peptides) repeated purification required between individual steps provides a purer product but low yield. Thus, improvements in yield and purification techniques at the terminal stages of synthesis are needed. The present invention is an industrially feasible solid phase synthesis and is a novel process to yield a high purity product with greater yields.<br>
