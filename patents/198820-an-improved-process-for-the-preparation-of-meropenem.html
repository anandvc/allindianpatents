To a solution of (2S,4R)-2-dimethylamino cafbonyl-4-mesyloxy-l-p-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl pyrrolidine obtained in Step II (100 g, 0.24 mol) in DMF (450 ml) and toluene (450 ml), potassium thioacetate (46.5 g, 0.4 mol) was added under N2 atmosphere. The resulted suspension was heated to 70-75°C and stirred for 6 hour. The reaction mass was cooled to 30°C and quenched into a mixture containing toluene (900 ml) and water (900 ml) at 10°C. The aqueous layer was diluted with DM water (900 ml) and re-extracted with toluene (900 ml). The combined extracts were washed with DM water (900 ml) and added hyflow (40 gm) and activated carbon (10 g) and stirred further for 30 minutes at 30°C. Filtered, washed with toluene (100 ml) and the filtrate was concentrated in vacuo upto the<br><br>
residual volume (300 ml) and added IPE (600 ml), stirred at 55-60°C for 30 min. The precipitated crystals were further stirred for I hour at 10-15°C and separated, washed with a mixture of toluene and IPE (90 ml 1:2) and dried in vacuo at 50-eO^C for 8-10 hours to afford the tittle compound (80 g, 84%).

Step (W)<br>
Preparation	of	(2S,4S)-2-dimethylaiiiinocarbonyl-4-mercapto-l-p-<br>
nitrobenzyloxycarbonylpyrrolidone<br>
To a solution of methanolic HCl (20% 500 ml) (2S,4S)-4-acetyl thio-2-dimethylamino carbonyl-l-(p-nitrobenzyloxy carbonylpyrrolidine obtained in step III (100 g, 0.253 mol) was added at 25°C and stirred for 24 hours at 25-30°C. To the clear reaction mixture, MDC (1500 ml) was added and stirred for 15-20 min. The aqueous layer after separation was re-extracted with MDC (500 ml) and the combined organic layers were washed with saturated brine solution (2 x 500 ml), stirred with hyflo (40 g) and carbon (10 g) for 30 min. The organic layer was separated and evaporated in vacuo. The residue was purified with a mixture of ethyl acetate and hexane (1,250 ml, 1:4) to afford the title compound (80 g) as off white crystals.

Advantages of the process :<br>
Step f i):<br>
1.	The process avoids the purification by column chromatography<br>
2.	Single solvent crystallization yields high optical purity.<br><br>
Step (ii) :<br>
1.	The alkylation is carried out in the presence of a commercially viable base<br>
like sodium hydroxide.<br>
2.	The solvent from solvent extraction is changed from a more polar solvent to less polar solvent, since the more polar solvent picks-up polar impurities, which effects the quality of the product.<br>
3.	Non-industrially viable column chromatography has been avoided.<br>
Step fiii):<br>
1.	Purification is removed, so that the solvent consumption in the process is<br>
reduced, thereby decreasing the cost of the overall process.<br>
Step fiv):<br>
1. The use of DMAc with N-methyi pyrrolidone fastens the reaction. The reaction is completed in 42 hours, whereas the prior-art method is completed in 72 at the same temperature. This makes the process industrially more convenient as the time of the production is drastically decreased.<br>
2.	The purification is carried out by simple crystallization techniques thus<br>
avoiding the tedious column purification in the industrial scale.<br>
Step fvi):<br>
1.        Purification is carried out by water crystallization thus avoiding purification<br>
using resin yields high purity product.<br>
Step fvii):<br>
1.       The process avoids the :<br>
•   use of 3-(N-morpholino)propane sulfonic acid (MOPS).<br><br>
•	Usage of high quantity of Pd-C and<br>
•	purification using resin.<br>
2.        Direct crystalHzation of crude with water-THF yield high purity of the product.<br><br><br><br>
ii) alkylating the compound of formula (IV) using allyl bromoacetate in the presence of sodium hydroxide and a solvent at a temperature in the range of -45 "C to 10 °C, quenching the reaction mixture by citric acid, followed by iso-propyl ether extraction to produce compound of formula (V),<br><br><br><br>
v) removing the lert-butyldimethylsilyloxy (TBDMS) group of the compound of formula (VIII) using ammonium bifluoride in the presence of N-methyl pyirolidone (NMP) and dimethylacetamide as a solvent, extracted by ethylacetate, quenched by phosphate buffer, followed by crystalhzation with ethyl acetate and isopropyl ether (IPE) mixture to produce a compound of formula (IX),<br><br>
vi) removing the allyl protecting group in the compound of formula (IX) using palladium acetate, sodium bicarbonate, dimidone and triethylphosphlte in tetrahydrofiiran at a temperature in the range of 30 °C to 40 °C, extracted the reaction mixture with ethyl acetate, adjusting the pH of aqueous layer to 5 to 5.5 followed by crystallizing the product with sodium chloride to produce the compound of formula (X) and<br><br>
vii) deprotecting the compound of formula (X) using palldium carbon in the presence of tetrahydrofiiran and ethyl acetate, at pH 3.0 to 4.0 extracting with ethyl acetate, the aqueous layer is lyophilized to produce compound of the formula (I).<br>
2.	The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the solvent used in step (i) is selected from tetrahydrofiiran (THF), dibromoethane, dichloromethane (DCM) or mixture thereof.<br>
3.	The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the solvent used in step (ii) is selected from THF, DCM and the like or mixture thereof.<br><br>
4.	The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the phosphorylating agent used is diphenyl chlorophosphate.<br>
5.	The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the solvent used in step (iv) is selected from from di-isoproyl ether, acetonitrile or mixture thereof.</td>
