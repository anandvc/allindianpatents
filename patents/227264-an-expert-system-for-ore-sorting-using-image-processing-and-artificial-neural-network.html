				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to an expert system for ore sorting and ore classification to<br>
improve the quality of ferruginous manganese ore feed to a ferromanganese<br>
plant.<br>
NOVELTY OF INNOVATION<br>
•	Developed an innovative methodology for on-line ore sorting and ore<br>
classification using image processing and radial bases neural network<br>
techniques. This was used to develop an expert system for on-line ore<br>
sorting and ore classification for ferruginous manganese ore feed to a<br>
ferromanganese plant.<br>
•	Developed a cost effective process for on-line ore sorting and ore<br>
classification.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Most of Ferro-manganese plant in India utilizes lumpy (-75, + 10 mm)<br>
ferruginous manganese ore of higher grade ( Mn : &gt; 46%; Mn/Fe ratio : &gt; 6;<br>
AI2O3 : 
sedimentary deposits and shows significant difference in color due to variation in<br><br>
ore composition. Ore lumps of high manganese (&gt; 46%) and high Mn/Fe ratio<br>
(&gt; 6) shows steel gray color. Ore containing low manganese and high iron with<br>
low Mn/Fe ratio shows reddish brown color. Ores having higher alumina with low<br>
Mn/Fe ratio shows white color. To improve the ore grade and to maintain the<br>
Mn/Fe ratio for Ferromanganese making ore sorting and ore blending is most<br>
common method. Most common existing method to improve the ore quality is<br>
manual ore sorting and ore blending. X-ray based on line ore sorting systems<br>
needs highly complicated system with high investment. So, any system for on<br>
line ore sorting and ore classification for better blending can be of immense<br>
significance.<br>
A US Patent Document No. 6748354 which discloses a teaching related to a signal<br>
processing system comprising wave form shape descriptions were classified by<br>
Artificial Neural Network after TESPAR coading to monitor the performance of<br>
machinery involved in crushing of ores by using a digital camera. In Instant<br>
specification, image features discloses a teaching of color, histogram, texture<br>
(energy, entropy, contrast, homogeneity) are being used to classify different kind<br>
of manganese ores (ferruginous, low grade and high grade) by Artificial Neural<br>
network to monitor the quality of ores by using a digital camera.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Image processing and artificial neural network are two most emerging<br>
technologies to develop the machine vision systems. Digital image (photographs<br>
is a representation of a two-dimensional image as a finite set of digital valves,<br>
called pixels. This representation of image is processed by various operations to<br>
extract useful features from an image. An artificial neural network (ANN) is an<br>
interconnected group of artificial neurons that uses a computational model for<br>
information processing based on a connectionist approach to computation. It can<br>
learn from examples and a trained network can recognize the unknown<br>
examples. These two techniques were used to develop this methodology and<br>
process steps are explained and described here after.<br><br>
Process steps: There are four major steps involved in this methodology and<br>
high speed computing is required in this system.<br>
Step 1: Image acquisition: In this step various kind of ores and ore blends<br>
are selected from feed material of the ferromanganese plant to produce digital<br>
images. Digital images of these ores were produced by using digital camera<br>
(Example: SANYO 0.8 Mega-pixel). The illumination at the site is to be sufficient<br>
to support the image producing instrument for desired operation.<br>
Step 2: Image processing: In this step various image produced were<br>
categorized as high grade ore (Images of manganese enriched ores), ferruginous<br>
ore (Images of Iron enriched ores) and low grade ores (Images of alumina<br>
enriched ores). These images are pre-processed to remove the noise and to<br>
improve the contrast for better visibility of objects. It can be done by using<br>
computer and high level computer language (C, C ++, Java etc.). a digital image<br>
is a matrix representing the pixel intensities. The value of any matrix element<br>
represents the brightness of that point. In most of method minimum brightness<br>
is called black and stands for zero (0) and maximum intensity is white and stands<br>
for 225.<br>
The extracted useful features { RGB color model, histogram, image texture<br>
(Entropy, contrast, energy homogeneity)} are elaborately described in step 2.1<br>
to 2.3.<br>
Step 2.1: RGB Color Model: Useful features of Image data represents physical<br>
quantities such as chromatics and luminance. Chromaticity is the color quantity<br>
defined by its wave length while luminance is the amount of light. This<br>
information can be expressed such as attributes like color and brightness. The<br>
most common color<br><br>
models are RGB (red, green and blue), HSV (hue, saturation, value), and CMYK<br>
(cyan, magenta, yellow, black). A color model is a method to represent color<br>
and their relationship to each other RGB color model was selected in our system<br>
because of its simplicity and ore quality can be easily distinguished in these<br>
colors. It was confirmed by chemical analysis that the color difference in the<br>
ores is depending on the chemical composition and reddish color is due to iron<br>
minerals and white color is due to alumina minerals and steel gray color is due to<br>
manganese minerals. In RGB color (Red, Green, and Blue) analysis significant<br>
difference was found in all three kinds of ore images. Results are shown in<br>
Figure 1.<br>
Step - 2.2. Histogram Analysis: An image histogram is a device that shows<br>
the distribution of intensities in an image and simply a count of the gray levels (A<br>
single value extracted by operation from different color values (R, G, B) of a<br>
pixel) in the image. The image histograms of three ore categories are shown in<br>
Figure 2. Image histogram analysis of three different kind images show the<br>
difference in occurrences of different gray level intensities and it was shifting<br>
towards left to right for steel gray manganese ores, reddish brown ferruginous<br>
ore and white alumina rich low grade ores respectively due to variation in the<br>
increased frequency of high gray level values in the images (Figure 2).<br>
Step 2.3. Image texture analysis: Image texture represents the orientation<br>
of gray values in a image. There are various method to quantify the image<br>
texture and we select the oldest and most reliable method suggested by Haralic<br>
et. al. Four textual features (Entropy, Energy, homogeneity and contrast) were<br>
calculated from gray level co-occurrence matrix and these play a significant role<br>
in ore type recognition and ore classification (Table 1).<br><br>
A co-occurrence matrix is a square matrix with elements corresponding to the<br>
relative frequency of occurrence of pairs of gray laval of pixels separated by a<br>
certain distance in a given direction. Formally, the elements of a GxG gray level<br>
co-occurrence matrix Pa for a displacement vector d = (dx, dy) is defined at:<br><br>
where I (.,.) denote an image of size NxN with G gray values, (r, s), (t, v) εNxN,<br>
(t, v) = (r + dx, s + dy) and 1.1 is the cardinality of a sat. Haralick, Shanmugan<br>
and Dinstein proposed fourteen measures of textural features which are derived<br>
from the co-occurrence matrices, and each represents certain image properties<br>
as coarseness, contrast, and homogeneity and texture complexity. Gray laval co-<br>
occurrence matrix was derived from the images and given textural features was<br>
extracted.<br>
(1) Entropy: It givas a measure of complexity of the image. Complex<br>
textures tend to have higher entropy.<br><br>
(2) Contrast: It is a measure of the amount of local variations present in an<br>
image. The higher the value of contrast is the sharper the structural<br>
variations in the image.<br><br><br>
(3) Energy: It is a measure of the homogeneity of an image and a suitable<br>
measure for detection of disorders in textures. For homogeneous<br>
textures value of energy turns out to be small compared to non-<br>
homogenous ones.<br><br>
(4) Homogeneity: It is a parameter which represents monotonic of image<br>
texture.<br><br>
In Eqs. (2) - (5), P (i, j) refers to the normalized entry of the co-occurrence<br>
matrices. That is p (i, j) - Pd (i, j) / R where R is the total number of pixel pairs<br>
(i, j). For a displacement vector d = (dx, dy) and image of size NxM. R is given<br>
by (N - dx) (M-dy). A data base was prepared for various ore categories on the<br>
basis of the results shown in the table 1.<br><br><br>
Step Step 3: Ore Class Reegaanization by Artificial Neural Netwerk: Artificial<br>
Neural Networks are relatively crude electronic models based on the neural<br>
structure of the brain. It learns from examples and used for nonlinear function<br>
approximation, classification and pattern reorganization (figure 3). A data base<br>
prepared containing (average color values (red, green and blue), entropy,<br>
contrast, homogeneity and energy) for three ore categories using various images<br>
of ores with small variations in ore quality. This database was used to train the<br>
artificial neural network. The trained neural network is able to detect new<br>
images of various categories upto a satisfactory accuracy. Overall system<br>
accuracy was 88.71 % and descriptive results are given in table 2.<br>
Table 2: Neural network classification<br><br><br>
Step 4: Expert System Development: An expert system was developed by<br>
combining the all three steps explained in previous section. A digital camera is<br>
needed to for image producing and image processing algorithms to extract the<br>
useful features from the images. The prepared datasets used to train the<br>
artificial neural network. The trained neural network can label the new unknown<br>
image of the feed ore. On the basis of this classification the ore blending can be<br>
controlled to achieve desired grade of ores. Process methodology and expert<br>
system for online implementations is shown in Figure 4 and 5.<br>
It's Utlity: The developed method and system will be suitable for developing<br>
cost effective online ore sorting and ore classification system to improve the ore<br>
quality and ore blending operation in ferruginous manganese ores.<br>
New Obvieus: The same process and the system can be used in much other<br>
type of ores and rocks fix on line quality control, separation and classification.<br>
Estimated market valve if pateated: High for all the Indian ferromanganese<br>
producers which produce alloy from ferruginous lumpy manganese ores. Many<br>
other mineral industries which need ore sorting operation at various stages of<br>
the process.<br><br>
