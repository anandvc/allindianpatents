This invention relates to stable microencapsulated iodine compounds which are particularly but not exclusively useful in fortifying crystal salts with sustained release iodine compounds.<br>
Fortification of pure and refined powder salt with iodine and iron is known and such fortified salts are available in the market. Iodisation of pure refined salt is relatively easy and the thus fortified refined salt has good stability and shelf life. This is due to the alkaline pH in the range of 8 of pure refined salt at which pH iodine compounds are stable and do not dissooiate into free iodine.<br>
However, fortification of crystal salt is not easy and so far attempts to fortify crystal salt with iodine to produce stable fortified crystal salt have not been successful. Crystal salt is produced in salt pans by the evaporation of sea water using solar heat. Sea water contains salts of calcium and magnesium in addition to salts of sodium. During slow evaporation leading to crystallisation, a nucleus of calcium salts is formed first before sodium chloride crystals are deposited. Finally magnesium salts crystallise over the sodium chloride constituting the top most layer. Ideally, salt must be harvested before magnesium salt layer formation. But in actual practice and to increase the bulk of the final product, salt is harvested only after considerable magnesium salt deposition.<br><br>
Magnesium salts are highly hygroscopic in nature and for this reason, commercially available crystal salt has higher moisture content. Presence of calcium and magnesium salts inorease the acidity of the crystal salt which has a lower pH than refined salt. It is established that iodine compounds dissociate under acidic pH and thus iodisation of crystal salt in the normal manner does not produoe a stable composition.<br>
It is already established that mioronutrients like iron and iodine, necesary for health and growth can be supplimented through the use of iron and iodine fortified common salt. A very large section of our population, especially people belonging to the lower income group consume only crystal salt and not refined powder salt. Therefore it is possible to supply this essential micronutrient, iodine, to all sections of the society only if crystal salt is also fortified with iodine. We have already established that stable crystal salt fortified with iodine is difficult to produce and store due to the inherent contaminations, low pH and hygroscopic nature of crystal salt.<br>
Microencapsulated iodine compounds are found to exhibit good stability and shelf life. They are also acid, heat and moisture resistant and do not dissociate under harsh environmental conditions. Microencapsulated iodine compounds are thus found ideal for iodising crystal salt at the salt pans or immediately after harvesting salt from the pans. This results in cost reduction and consequential affordability by the common man.<br><br>
Microencapsulated iodine compounds of this invention have been developed with these objectives in view. Biocompatible and bioabsorbable iodine compounds are selected and microencapsulated with acid, heat and moisture resistant coating agents to increase their stability and to provide prolonged shelf life.<br>
Iodine compounds, suitable for fortifying salts, must be biocompatible and bioabsorbable. Alkali and alkaline earth metal iodides and iodates are examples of such compounds. For example, sodium iodide, sodium iodate, potassium iodide, potassium iodate, calcium iodide and calcium iodate are some of the suitable iodine sources. The process of microencapsulating the above compounds with acid, heat and moisture resistant coat materials and the products obtained by such process are novel, though the coating techniques involved in this process are known in the art. Some of the coating techniques used in producing microencapsulated , iodine are listed herein below:<br>
(1)  SPRAY DRYING, SPRAY DEHYDRATION:<br>
The process involves three steps.<br>
(a)	Preparation of the solute/dispersion/emulsion to be<br>
processed.<br>
(b)	Homogenisation of the above and finally spraying<br>
resulting in atomisation of the mass in the drying chamber. The<br>
core material which has to be microencapsulated is dispersed into<br>
a solution which contains the wall coating material and then<br>
homogenised.<br><br>
(c) The homogenised product is then sprayed into a drying chamber where heated air removes the solvent and the microencapsulated product settles below. Alternatively the core materials are taken in a homogeniser and the coat material dissolved in suitable solvent or melted if necessary and is sprayed onto the core materials to ensure uniform and proper microencapsulation. The solvent is removed by.proper temperature control and recovered if desired.<br>
(2)	AIR SUSPENSION COATING, FLUIDISBD BED COATING:<br>
This is accomplished by suspending solid particles of the core material in an upward moving stream of air which may be heated or cooled. The wall coating material which may be in a molten state or dissolved in an evaporable solvent is atomised through nozzles into the chamber and deposits as a thin layer on the surface of the suspended core particles. The turbulence of the air column is sufficient to maintain the suspension of the coating particles allowing them to tumble and thereby become uniformly coated.<br>
(3)	EXTRUSION:<br>
This involves forcing a core material dispersed in the wall material solution through a series of dies into a bath of the dehydrated liquid. Upon contacting the liquid, the coating material hardens to entrap the core material. The extruded filaments are separated from the fluid bath and dried.<br><br>
(4)	SPRAY COOLING, SPRAY CHILLING &amp; SPRAY FREEZING:<br>
This involves dispersing the oore material into the liquified wall ooating material and spraying through heated nozzles into a Drying Chamber where cool air is used to solidify the wall coating material which in the process encapsulates the core.<br>
(5)	CENTRIFUGAL EXTRUSION, MULTI-ORIFICE CENTRIFUGAL EXTRUSION:<br>
This process consists of concentric feed tubes through which the coat material and the core material are pumped separately to the many nozzles mounted on the outer surface of the device. The entire device is attached to a rotating shaft suoh that the head rotates around its vertical axis. As the head rotates, the core material and the coating material are co-extruded through the concentric orifices of the nozzles as a Fluid "Rod" of the core sheethed in the coating material. Centrifugal force impels the rod outward, causing it to break into tiny particles, by the action of the surface tension, the coating material envelopes the core material, thus accomplishing encapsulation.<br>
(6)	ROTATIONAL SUSPENSION SEPARATION:<br>
This process involves suspending the core partioles in a pure liquified coating material, then pouring the suspension through a rotating disc apparatus under such conditions that the excess  liquid between the core particles separates into  a  film<br><br>
thinner than the core particles diameters. The excess liquid is then atomised into very small particles which are separated from the product and recycled. The core particles leave the disc with the residual liquid still around them which forms ooating. The particles are hardened by chilling or drying.<br>
(7) COACERVATION/PHASE SEPARATION, AQUEOUS AND NON-AQUEOUS PHASE SEPARATION:<br>
In this process both the wall coating material and the core material are in the liquid phase. Coacervation involves the separation of a liquid phase of coating material and wrapping of that phase as a uniform layer around suspended core particles. Coacervation may be brought about when the surface energies of the core material and the coating material are adjusted by varying some parameters of the system such as temperature pH or composition. The coating material is then solidified by means of heat or cross-linking or solvent removal techniques. The microcapsules are usually collected by filtration or oentrifugation, washed with an appropriate solvent and subsequently dried. Coacervation may be divided into aqueous phase separation and non-aqueous phase separation. Aqueous phase separation requires hydrophilic coating and a water insoluble oore particle. In non-aqueous phase separation the coating is usually hydro-phobic and the core may be water »«i»Kl« nv   usfpr imminaihie.<br><br>
(8)	INCLUSION COMPLEXION:<br>
This process involves the forming of a complex of the core material with the coating material - for example, when Beta-cyclo-dextrin is used as a coating material, this molecule has a doughnut shaped structure with a hollow which enables it to form complexes with many flavours, colours and vitamins. The Beta-cyclo-dextrin molecule forms inolusion complexes with compounds that can fit dimensionally within its cavity.<br>
(9)	LIPOSOME ENTRAPMENT:<br>
Liposomes are vesicles which are formed when films of phospho lipids are dispersed in aqueous media. Liposomes are selectively permeable to ions. These liposomes could be used to entrap core materials. Structurally there are three types of Liposomes Multi Lamellar vesicles, single compartment vesicles and macro vesicles.<br>
(10)	CO-CRYSTALISATION:<br>
This process involves inclusion of the core materials or entrapment of the core materials into and in between crystals during the process of crystalisation - for example, when sucrose is spontaneously crystalised from super saturated solution, aggregates of crystals from 3 to 30 micro metres form which can entrap the core material.  The co-crystalisation process involves<br><br>
concentrating the syrup to the point of super saturation and adding the material to be encapsulated and nixing the syrup to induce nucleation and agglomeration.<br>
(11) INTER FACIAL POLYMERISATION:<br>
This prooess involves dissolving a hydrophobic polymerisable monomer in a hydrophobic core material. Then polymerisation of the monomer is induced. The polymer is insoluble in the hydrophobic core material and deposits as a wall around the core.<br>
Prior to encapsulation, iodine compounds may be mixed with alkaline and alkaline earth metal carbonates and bicarbonates to maintain alkaline pH necessary for stability of iodine.<br>
