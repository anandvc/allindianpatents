				<td>SPECIFICATION SOLVENT-SOLUBLE 6,6-POLYIMIDE COPOLYMERS AND PROCESSES<br>
FOR PREPARING THEM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]   Conventional polyimide films are two-component polycondensates. The present<br>
invention relates to solvent-soluble highly heat-resistant polyimides consisting essentially of<br>
four components, i.e., pyromellitic dianhydride (hereinafter referred to as PMDA), 4,4'-<br>
diaminodiphenyl ether (hereinafter referred to as DADE), biphenyltetracarboxylic<br>
dianhydride (hereinafter referred to as BPDA) and 2,4-diaminotoluene (hereinafter referred<br>
to as DAT).<br>
[0002]   Solvent-soluble highly heat-resistant polyimides can also be produced by using<br>
benzophenone tetracarboxylic dianhydride (called BTDA) in place of BPDA. Similar<br>
solvent-soluble polyimides can also be produced by using 3,5-diaminobenzoic acid<br>
(hereinafter referred to as DABz) in place of DAT.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0003]   A polyimide film serving as a highly heat-resistant resin was first manufactured in<br>
1960 by DuPont and called KAPTON, which consists of pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA)<br>
and 1,4-diaminodiphenyl ether (DADE).<br>
[0004]   This is a polymer characterized by a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 420°C and<br>
a thermal decomposition onset temperature (Tm) of 500°C or more as well as high electric<br>
insulation, mechanical strength and chemical resistance so that it is widely used as a material<br>
for aerospace vehicles, electric/electronic components, semiconductors, etc. (non-patent<br>
document 1: polyimides; D. Wilson, H. D. Steinberger, R. M. Morgenrother; Blackie, New<br>
York (1990)).<br>
[0005]   A polyimide film called "Upilex" manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd. in 1980 is a<br>
heat-resistant film consisting of biphenyltetracarboxylic dianhydride (BPDA) and 1,4-<br>
diaminobenzene and having Tg&gt;500°C and Tm&gt;550°C (non-patent document 1).<br><br>
 [0006]   Any heat-resistant polyimide film comparable to KAPTON or Upilex has never been produced since. They are solvent-insoluble polyimides, and any tetracarboxylic dianhydride replacing PMDA or BPDA has not been developed.<br>
[0007]   KAPTON and Upilex are less soluble in organic solvents, and they are polymerized in anhydrous solvents at low temperatures to synthesize a polyamic acid, which is then cast and heated to form a polyimide film.<br>
[0008]   Polyamic acids readily decompose in water so that they are poor storage stability. Polyamic acids are difficult to modify because they undergo rapid exchange interaction to form random copolymers when other components are added. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0009]   It has been known that a tetracarboxylic dianhydride and an aromatic diamine are polycondensed by heating in an organic polar solvent to directly produce a polyimide (patent document 1: H. Itatani, USP 5,202,411 (1993), USP 6,627,307 Bl (2003), USP 6,890,626 Bl (1995)).<br>
[0010]   Toluene sulfonic acid was used as a catalyst (patent document 2: A. Berger, USP 4,011,297 (1979), USP 4,359,572 (1983)).<br>
[0011]   When a polyimide is synthesized in the presence of an acid catalyst, however, the catalyst must be separated from the polyimide because the presence of the catalyst in the film may cause deterioration.<br>
[0012]   Polyimide copolymers consisting of PMDA and DADE are less soluble in solvents. We tried to synthesize a four-component polyimide copolymers consisting of PMDA-DADE-BPDA-DAT by sequential reactions in solution using an acid catalyst, but any solvent-soluble polyimide copolymer could not be obtained. Solvent-soluble four-component polyimides (polyimides consisting of PMDA-DADE-BPDA-DAT) were synthesized via specific imide oligomer intermediates by adopting a novel three-step polycondensation process. [0013]   The first step of polycondensation reaction involves reacting 1 mole of BPDA and<br><br>
2 moles of DADE (component containing 6 benzene rings) to form an imide oligomer, and the second step reaction involves reacting 4 moles of PMDA and 2 moles of DAT (component containing 6 benzene rings) to synthesize a primary intermediate (called 6,6-polyimide oligomer). Finally, the remaining components are added to complete polycondensation. Thus, the present invention mainly provides the following two types of polyamides.<br>
[0014]   (i) Polyamides having a (BPDA): (DADE): (PMDA): (DAT) molar ratio of 2:2:m:m (where m is an integer of 3, 4 or 5.).<br>
(ii) Polyamides having a (BTDA): (DADE): (PMDA): (DAT) molar ratio of 2:2:m:m (where m is an integer of 3, 4 or 5.).<br>
The endpoint of the reaction is determined by measuring the molecular weight by<br>
GPC. The thermal decomposition onset temperature was 500°C or more, and no glass<br>
transition temperature was observed in a test range up to 430°C. Four-component<br>
solvent-soluble polyimides are produced by using DABz in place of DAT (variation of (i) or<br>
(ii) above). Thermal analysis shows that a weight loss began around 430°C, and that the<br>
thermal decomposition onset temperature rose to 540°C.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS<br>
[0015]   In order to synthesize a solvent-soluble polyimide, it was necessary to develop a<br>
novel catalyst above all things. A catalyst acting as a catalyst during polycondensation<br>
reaction and disappearing at the end of the reaction was developed (patent document 3: Y.<br>
Oie, H. Itatani, USP 5,502,142 (1996)).<br>
[0016]   A catalyst based on lactone equilibrium was developed. It consists of a mixture of<br>
y-valerolactone and pyridine or y-valerolactone and N-methylmorpholine, which achieves<br>
equilibrium by forming an [acid] [base] system in the presence of water and returns to<br>
[lactone] and [base] when water is removed from the system (formula 1).<br>
[0017]   [Formula 1]<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [0018]   Imidation reaction takes place by adding small amounts of y-valerolactone and pyridine or y-valerolactone and N-methylmorpholine into the reaction system, and heating it at 180°C.<br>
[0019]   [Acid]+[base]" is produced by the [water] generated at an early step of the reaction to promote the imidation reaction. The water produced during the reaction is removed from the reaction system by azeotropic distillation with toluene contained in the system. When the imidation reaction is completed, the reaction system approaches an anhydrous state and the [acid]+[base]" is separated into [y-valerolactone] and [pyridine] and removed from the system. Thus, a high-purity polyimide copolymer is obtained.<br>
[0020]   Solvent-soluble multicomponent block-copolymerized polyimides are produced by sequential polycondensation reactions. Four-component block-copolymerized polyimides are produced by the formula below:<br>
[0021]   [Formula 2]<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [0022]   where A1 and A2 represent acid dianhydrides, and B1 and B2 represent aromatic<br>
diamines.<br>
[0023]   During such sequential reactions, four-component block-copolymerized polyimides<br>
containing PMDA and DADE precipitated and failed to give solvent-soluble polyimides.<br>
[0024]   The PMDA-DADE-PMDA component and DADE-PMDA-DADE component are<br>
less soluble in solvents. Thus, it was necessary to synthesize block copolymerized polyimides<br>
free from these insoluble components.<br>
[0025]   We developed a novel polycondensation reaction based on three-step addition for<br>
generating a specific component rather than sequential polycondensation reactions. As a<br>
result, we succeeded in synthesizing solvent-soluble four-component polyimides consisting<br>
of PMDA-DADE-BPDA-DAT.<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
 [0026]   [Applications of 6,6-polyimide copolymers]<br>
6,6-polyimide copolymers are solvent-soluble polyimide resins showing good storage stability. They can be coated on metal surfaces to form composite materials or used in copper substrates. Modified polyimides can be used for electrodeposition or as adhesives. [0027]   They can be cast/heated into films, which can be widely used as highly heat-resistant films in electric/electronic components, transport aircraft materials, semiconductor materials, etc.<br>
[0028]   They can be used as medical materials, construction materials, high-temperature<br>
materials for domestic uses (e.g., iron soleplates, inner walls of pans, inner walls of<br>
microwave ovens), substitutes for Teflon™ by capitalizing on advantages of the new<br>
preparation process, high performance quality and low-cost products.<br>
THE MOST PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0029]   Polyimides consisting of combinations of aPMDA + bBPDA + cDADE + dDAT<br>
(where a, b, c, and d denote the number of moles) have the stoichiometry shown by the<br>
formula below:<br>
[0030]   [Formula 3]<br>
a + b = c + d	(the number of moles)<br>
[0031]   Taking into consideration the availability of materials, product costs, etc., the<br>
following conditions<br>
[0032]   [Formula 4]<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [0033]   were established:<br>
[0034]   In solutions in organic polar solvents (N-methylpyrrolidone, dimethylacetamide, sulfolane, dimethylformamide) were added y-valerolactone and pyridine or y-valerolactone and N-methylmorpholine, and the production reactions of polyimides containing the four<br><br>
components above were evaluated.<br>
[0035] As a result of the evaluation of various polycondensation reactions based on three-step addition, desired solvent-soluble polyimides were obtained by a polyimide synthesis process through primary polycondensates showing specific compositions.<br>
I. Polyimides having a (BPDA): (DADE): (PMDA): (DAT) molar ratio of 2:2:m:m (where m is an integer of 3, 4 or 5.).<br>
1-1. Polyimides having a (BPDA'): (DADE): (PMDA1: (DAT) molar ratio of 2:2:4:4 The first step polycondensation reaction is an imidation reaction in which 2 moles of DADE and 1 mole of BPDA are heated at 180°C in an organic polar solvent in the presence of an acid catalyst to produce an oligomer having diamine at both ends (formula 5). The water produced during the reaction is removed from the system by azeotropic distillation with toluene. [0036]   [Formula 5] 2DADE + BPDA -&gt; (DADE-BPDA-DADE) oligomer<br>
[0037]   In the second step reaction, 4 moles of PMDA and 2 moles of DAT are added and the mixture is stirred. An oligomer having PMDA at both ends is produced (formula 6).<br>
[0038]   [Formula 6]<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [0039]   This primary intermediate is stirred with the remaining mixture (BPDA+2DAT), and<br>
the combined mixture is polycondensed by heating to 180°C to synthesize a solvent-soluble<br>
polyimide copolymer (formula 7).<br>
[0040]   [Formula 7]<br>
[Primary product] [(DAT-BPDA-DAT)]„ polyimide<br><br>
 [0041 ]   The primary intermediate oligomer is a reaction product of components each<br>
containing 6 benzene rings in the first step reaction and the second step reaction (formula 8).<br>
[0042]   [Formula 8]<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [0043]   The primary intermediate oligomer is called 6,6-polyimide to distinguish it from<br>
other polyimide products because the components added for the first step reaction and the<br>
second step reaction each contain 6 benzene rings.<br>
1-2. Polvimides having a (BPDA): (DADE): (PMDA): (DAT) molar ratio of 2:2:5:5 In the first and second step reactions, a 6,6-imide segment is generated, which is<br>
combined with a (BPDA+PMDA+3DAT) component and heated with stirring to give a<br>
solvent-soluble polyimide copolymer in the third step.<br>
[0044]   Thus, the first step reaction involves reacting a (BPDA+2DADE) component at<br>
180°C for 1 hour in an organic solvent in the presence of a catalyst. Then, the second step<br>
reaction involves adding a (4PMDA+2DAT) component at room temperature and stirring the<br>
mixture to produce a 6,6-imide segment (BPDA+2DADE) (4PMDA+2DAT).<br>
A (BPDA+PMDA+3DAT) component is added to this solution, and the mixture is<br>
heated at 180°C with stirring to give a solvent-soluble polyimide copolymer.<br>
I-3.Polvimide having a (BPDA): (DADE): (PMDA): (DAT) molar ratio of 2:2:3:3 In the three-step addition reaction, PMDA is partially replaced by BPDA. The first<br>
step reaction involves reacting a (BPDA+2DADE) component in an organic solvent at 180°C<br>
for 1 hour to produce an imide oligomer.<br>
[0045]   In the second step reaction, a (3PMDA+BPDA+2DAT) component is added and the<br>
mixture is stirred at room temperature to give a primary imide segment (formula 9):<br>
[0046]   [Formula 9]<br>
(BPDA+2DADE)(3PMDE+BPDA+2DAT); (imide segment)<br><br>
 [0047]   DAT is added to this solution, and the mixture is heated at 180°C with stirring to give a polyimide copolymer.<br>
The product is represented by the formula below: [0048]   [Formula 10] (BPDA+2DADE)(3PMDA+BPDA+2DAT)(DAT)<br>
[0049]   In the Examples below, a variation thereof is represented [0050]   by the formula below: [0051]   [Formula 11] (BPDA+2DADE)(3PMDA+BPDA)(3DAT)<br>
[0052]   In this manner, polyimide copolymers having a (BPDA): (DADE): (PMDA): (DAT) molar ratio of 2:2:m:m (where m is an integer of 3, 4 or 5.) are obtained. As shown in the table of physical properties of polyimides, a part of each polyimide solution was cast on a glass plate and heated in an IR heater at 90°C for 1 hour and 210°C for 1 hour into a polyimide film, which was then tested by thermal analysis.<br>
[0053]   The thermal decomposition onset temperature was 500°C or more, and no glass transition temperature could be observed in a test range up to 430°C.<br>
II. Polyimides having a (BTDA): (DADE): (PMDA): (DAT") molar ratio of 2:2:m:m (where m is an integer of 3. 4 or 5.)<br>
Solvent-soluble polyimides having similar compositions are produced by using benzophenone tetracarboxylic dianhydride (BTDA) in place of BPDA in the synthetic reaction.<br>
[0054]   Thus, polyimides having a (BTDA): (DADE): (PMDA): (DAT) of molar ratio 2:2:m:m (where m is an integer of 3, 4 or 5.) are produced.<br>
[0055]   Thermal analysis of these polyimides showed Tm of 500°C or more and no Tg in a test range up to 430°C. [0056]   Polyimides using BTDA in place of BPDA show higher Mw (weight average<br><br>
molecular weight) / MN (number average molecular weight) ratios, suggesting that they are<br>
partially crosslinked. They can be used as copper substrates or composite polyimide materials<br>
because of their good adhesiveness.<br>
[0057]   Diaminotoluene having the structure below:<br>
[0058]   [Chemical Formula 1]<br><br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
[0059]   and 3,5-diaminoacetic acid having the structure below: [0060]   [Chemical Formula 2]<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
[0061 ]   are both derivatives of 1,3-phenylenediamine. Thus, changes in physical properties of copolymerized polyimides in which diaminotoluene is partially replaced by 3,5-diaminoacetic acid were evaluated.<br>
III. Use of 3.5-diaminoacetic acid (DABz) in place of DAT in the synthetic reactions of the (PMDA-DADE-BPDA-DAT) series and rPMDA-DADE-BTDA-DAT) series of polyimides<br>
DAT can be replaced by 3,5-diaminoacetic acid (DABz) in the synthetic reactions of the (PMDA-DADE-BPDA-DAT) series and (PMDA-DADE-BTDA-DAT) series of polyimides using similar experimental procedures.<br>
[0062]   As shown in the Examples below, various methods can be selected, e.g., DAT in the second step may be replaced by DABz or DAT in the third step may be replaced by DABz. Thermal analysis shows a weight loss around 440~450°C in DABz-containing polyimide copolymers, i.e., (PMDA-DADE-BPDA-DABz) and (PMDA-DADE-BTDA-DABz) systems. This suggests that decarbonation reaction occurs.<br><br>
 [0063]   As a result, Tm rose to 530-550°C. This series of polyimide copolymers can be used as polyimide coatings by cathodic electrodeposition. They can also be used as composite materials because of their good adhesiveness.<br>
IV. The results of molecular weight analysis by GPC and thermal analysis (TG-DTA analysis) of the (PMDA-DADE-BPDA-DAT) series, (PMDA-DADE-BTDA-DAT) series, (PMDA-DADE-BPDA-DABz) series, and (PMDA-DADE-BTDA-DABz) series of polyimide copolymers are shown in Table 1.<br>
[0064]   The molecular weights of DABz-containing polyimide copolymers could not be determined by GPC in dimethylformamide.<br>
[0065]   The methyl group of diaminotoluene is adjacent to an amino group to cause molecular distortion when a polyimide bond is formed. This results in inhibition of the resonant effect of the polyimide, thereby further increasing instability. The thermal decomposition onset temperature around 500°C seems to be mainly attributed to this DAT factor.<br>
[0066]   When DAT is partially replaced by DABz, the carboxyl group is away from the amino group and does not cause steric distortion of the polyimide. Thus, the polyimide is stabilized by the resonant effect. Moreover, the weight loss around 450°C may be attributed to this carboxyl group. Thus, the polyimide has the "Upilex" type structure, and seems to show a high thermal decomposition onset temperature. [0067]<br><br>

(Table Removed)<br>
[0068]   Characteristics of 6,6-polyimide films and PMDA-DADE films are compared.<br>
(A) Characteristics of 6,6-polyimides<br>
A-1 They consist of PMDA-DADE-BPDA-DAT or PMDA-DADE-BTDA-DAT (or DABz in place of DAT) copolymers soluble in solvents.<br>
[0069]   A-2 They are obtained by direct imidation by acid-catalyzed dehydration-polycondensation reaction.<br>
 [0070]   A-3 They are synthesized via 6,6-imide segments synthesized by a three-step<br>
polycondensation reaction.<br>
[0071]   A-4 The reaction can be performed in 0.1 % aqueous solvents and the endpoint of<br>
the reaction is determined by molecular weight analysis by GPC with high reproducibility.<br>
[0072]   A-5 The imide copolymers rapidly form films at lower temperatures. The films<br>
show Tm&gt;500°C, and Tg cannot be observed in a range up to 430°C.<br>
[0073]   A-6 They can be modified by partially changing components.<br>
[0074]   A-7 The polyimide copolymers are stable at room temperature for a long period so<br>
that they have good storage stability.<br>
(B) PMDA-DADE polyimides<br>
B-1 Two-component systems consisting of PMDA-DADE and less soluble in solvents.<br>
[0075]   B-2 Precursor polyamic acids are synthesized by addition polymerization at low temperatures in anhydrous solvents.<br>
[0076]   B-3 The polyimides are produced by heating/dehydration reaction of the polyamic acids. Polyamic acids readily decompose in water.<br>
[0077]   B-4 The reaction takes place in anhydrous solvents. The molecular weights of the polyamic acids cannot be determined because they undergo intermolecular exchange interaction. The endpoint of the reaction is determined by viscosity.<br>
[0078]   B-5 Films are formed slowly at higher temperatures because film formation involves desolvation and dehydration reactions in combination. Films show Tm&gt;500°C, Tg=420°C. [0079]   BJj They are difficult to modify because random copolymers are formed by intermolecular exchange interactions when components are partially changed. [0080]   B-7 Polyamic acid solutions are poor in storage stability, and their storage life is 1-2 months even when they are frozen. EXAMPLES<br>
[0081]   The following examples illustrate the present invention, including PMDA-DADE-BPDA-DAT copolymers, PMDA-DADE-BTDA-DAT copolymers and 6,6-polyimide<br>
copolymers using DABz in place of DAT. However, the present invention is not limited<br>
solely to these examples<br>
[0082]   These copolymers were instrumentally analyzed. The molecular weight and<br>
molecular weight distribution were determined by high-speed liquid chromatography<br>
(GPC;HLC-8120GPCC (available from Tosoh Corporation)) in the polyimide solutions<br>
shown in the Examples partially diluted with dimethylformamide. Number average molecular<br>
weight (Mn), weight average molecular weight (Mw) and Mw/Mn are shown.<br>
[0083]   Thermal analysis was performed on the film obtained by casting a part of each<br>
polyimide solution on a glass plate and drying it at 90°C for one hour and at 210°C for one<br>
