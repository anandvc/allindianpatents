				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a composition of microcapsules containing biocide for coating material. More, particularly the present invention relates to a composition comprising of microcapsules containing biocide for coating material such as paint. The invention describes composition typically illustrated by composition comprising microcapsules containing biocides, especially Irgarol (algaecide) and Zinc Pyrithione (fungicide) and coating material such as paint to increase the life of coating material from the attack of algae and fungi respectively. The invention demonstrates that microcapsules containing biocide dispersed in paint show 0 to 3 % reduction in inhibition zone where as un-encapsulated biocide show 20-22 % reduction in inhibition zone when analyzed by filter paper assay thus indicating extended duration of biocidal activity with microencapsulated biocide.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Biocides are chemical compounds, which are toxic to microbial cells and are added to different types of products to prevent the growth of unwanted microorganisms. Paint is one of such products. Paint applied for exterior or interior use typically has two basic functions, protection and decoration. Attack of fungi and algae either in wet state or at the site of application of paint can destroy these functions and thus is one of the major factors responsible for reduction in the life of paint film. Paint films can be made fungi- algae- and bacteria -free by incorporating suitable biocide in the paint formulation. Reduction in biocidal activity of paint film is mostly attributed to the factors such as chemical degradation of biocide, fast dissipation of biocide from paint film due to washing<br><br>
out and /or volatilization from the paint film. The life of paint film will be more if these biocides are retained in the film and on the film surface for longer period. This extended duration of biocidal activity can be achieved by incorporating biocide in Controlled Release (CR) form. Microcapsule is one of the best controlled release form, wherein an active agent (core material) is surrounded by a polymer film or uniformly dispersed in a polymer matrix.<br>
Controlled Release Biocides:<br>
Controlled Release (CR) biocides has been the subject of interest to many researchers. CR concept and work was initiated first time on antifouling paints using chloroprene polymer by N.F. Cardarelli (Cardarelli N.F., Chapter 3 In Controlled Release Technologies: Methods, Theory &amp; Applications, Ed. Kydonieus A. F., 1980, CRC Press Inc., USA). Antifouling marine paint compostion containing gelation microcapsules of water-immiscible biocide has been described in US Patent No. 4,253,877. Yet another US Patent (No. 5378413) describes preparation of gelatin microcapsules containing fouling reducing agents and their use in paint system. Another report describes extended control of marine fouling using formulation of microencapsulated organometallic biocide and vinyl rosin paint. ( Porter R. and Miale J. B., Appl. Biochem. and Biotech., 9 (1984), p 439-445 (CA 102:162052).<br>
Apart from CR antifouling formulations there have been very few reports on CR of other biocides. Biocide namely 4,5-dichloro-n-octyl-3-isothiazolinone (DCOI) can be encapsulated in a variety of polysiloxane matrices using sol-gel chemistry (Ghosh T. and Nungesser E. N., Proc. Int. Symp. Control. Rel. Bioact. Mater., 25 (1998), p 324 ). The skin sensitization potential of active agent (3-isothiazolone)<br>
in loci such as water-based marine antifouling paint of decorative is reduced by encapsulating the active agent in polyurea (. EP 679333 (1995) , (CA 123: 332738) ). The fungicide tebuconazole and chlorothalonil were successfully incorporated into polyvinylpyridine (PVPy) and polyvinylpyridine-co-styrene nano particles (Liu Y. et. al., J. Appl. Poly. Sci, 79 (2001), p 458-465). US Patent (No. 4915947) describes preparation of microencapsulated phytotoxic fungicides using crosslinked polyurea or polyamide to provide an effective agent for direct foliar application to control fungal diseases on crops. Urea -formaldehyde (UF) and /or melamine formaldehyde (MF) resins have been used to prepare microcapsules of fungicide namely 3-lodo-2-propynylbutyl carbamate. These microcapsules when incorporated into exterior latex paint and applied onto rubberwood panels on exposing to the environment showed longer protection from discoloration. (Ibrahim W. A. et. al. , Pertanika 12 (1989) p 409-412 (CA 114:25832)). The acrylic latex exterior paint containing microcapsules of fungicides 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-4-methylsulfonylpryidine and tetrachloroisophthao nitrile have been reported to show good mildew protection ( Noren G. K. et. al. , J. Coatings Tech. 58 (1986), p 31-39 (CA 104: 188225)).<br>
Another patent describes encapsulation of biocide using MF resin and their use in coating material like plaster having silicate, mineral or polymer resin binder or a primer based on a silicate or polymer resin binder ( Patent WO 2004000953 Al 20031231 (CA 140:61138)).<br>
Biocides play an important role in paint formulations. However reduction in biocidal activity due to factors such as chemical degradation of biocide and fast dissipation of biocide due to washing out from the paint film, is a problem which leads to decrease in life period of paint. To compensate the dissipation of biocide<br>
use of excess amount of biocide in the coating material composition leads to environmental pollution risk.<br>
In the prior art there neither exists microcapsules of biocides like Irgarol and Zinc Pyrithione in particular (except as reported in our co-pending patent application no. 448/NF/2004 and 449/NF/2004) nor any composition describing use of microcapsules of these biocides.<br>
Thus to avoid reduction in activity of biocides due to factors mentioned above and to satisfy the need to prolong the life of biocide and thus coating material like paint, present invention provides coating material composition comprising microencapsulated biocide which is more effective than composition comprising un-encapsulated biocide.<br>
OBJECTIVES OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide A composition comprising microencapsulated biocide and coating material such as paint.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to demonstrate that coating material composition comprising microencapsulated biocide is more effective than composition comprising un-encapsulated biocide and an increase in protection from fungus or algae is obtained with microencapsulated biocide as compared to un-encapsulated biocide.<br>

In a feature of the present invention the use of microcapsules in coating material composition are not to be restricted to polyurethane or polystyrene or poly (methyl methacrylate) microcapsules containing biocides Zinc Pyrithione or Irgarol but may be selected from other class of polymer microcapsules containing other different biocides.<br>
In a feature the uses of microcapsules are not restricted to the above said fungal and algal strain but may be used for other fungal and algal strains.<br>

Evaluation of Biocidal Activity of composition comprising microencapsulated biocide and paint:<br>
To demonstrate that biocide can extend duration of activity through microencapsulation, the antifungal activity of microcapsules containing Zinc Pyrithione and unencapsulated Zinc Pyrithione against fungal strain Aspergillus niger (NRRL337) is assessed by filter paper bioassay by method reported elsewhere (Bauer,A.W. et al., Amer.J.Clin.Pathol., 45 (1966) p 493-496 and Thomberry, H.H.. Phytopathology 40 (1950) p 419-420) . Microcapsules of Zinc Pyrithione and unencpasulated Zinc Pyrithione are dispersed in paint such that the concentration of Zinc Pyrithione is around 5 wt % based on weight of paint and taken for analysis after 0 days, 12 days and 30 days of dispersion period . The antifungal activity of all the composition samples is indicated by zone of inhibition that is developed around the filter paper discs against the vegetative growth after the spore germination. The zone of inhibition is measured after 2 days and 100 days after the day on which samples are taken for filter paper<br>
bioassay. Table 1 shows measurements of inhibition zones after 2 days and 100 days, obtained for various samples taken for analysis after 0 days (the day on which microcapsules are dispersed in paint) . Microencapsulated Zinc Pyrithione samples show very less % reduction in inhibition zone as compared to unencapsulated Zinc Pyrithione demonstrating that extended duration of activity of biocide is achieved through microencapsulation. Similar type of results are obtained when microcapsules stored in paint for 12 days and 30 days are taken for such biocidal analysis.<br>
Table 1:<br>
(TABLE REMOVED)<br><br>
The antialgal activity of microencapsulated Irgarol and unencapsulated Irgarol against algal strains {Oscillatoria tenius and Chlorella fused) is assessed by filter paper bioassay by method as described above for fungal activity. Unencpasulated Irgarol and microcapsules of Irgarol are dispersed in paint such that the concentration of Irgarol is around 5 wt % based on weight of paint and taken for analysis after 0 days, 15 days and 30 days of dispersion period . Both the samples such as unencapsulated irgarol and microencapsulated irgarol dispersed in paint show very strong inhibitory activity against both the algal strains even after 100 days after the day on which samples are taken for filter paper bioassay.<br>
ADVANTAGES<br>
Biocides play an important role in paint formulations. However reduction in biocidal activity due to factors such as chemical degradation of biocide and fast dissipation of biocide due to washing out from the paint film, is a problem which leads to decrease in life period of paint. To compensate the dissipation of biocide use of excess amount of biocide in the coating material composition leads to environmental pollution risk.<br>
Thus to avoid reduction in activity of biocides due to factors mentioned above and to satisfy the need to prolong the life of biocide and thus coating material like paint, present invention provides coating material composition comprising microencapsulated biocide which is more effective than composition comprising un-encapsulated biocide.<br><br><br><br>
We claim<br>
1.	A composition of polymer microcapsules of biocide for coating material, the said composition comprising polymer microcapsules of biocide selected from Zinc Pyrithione &amp; Irgarol in the range of 20-70 wt% based on total weight of microcapsule the coating material selected from the paint.<br>
2.	The composition as claimed in claim 1, wherein the encapsulating polymer used in polymer microcapsules is selected from the group consisting of poly (methyl methacrylate), polystyrene, poly (vinylpyridine-co-styrene), polyamide, polyester, ethyl cellulose and polyurethane.<br>
3.	The composition as claimed in claim 1, wherein the particle size of polymer microcapsules of biocide used is in the range of 1-100 microns.</td>
