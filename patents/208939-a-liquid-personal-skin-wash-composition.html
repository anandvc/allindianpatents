The Patents Rules, 2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
A LIQUID PERSONAL,SKIN WASH COMPOSITION <br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br><br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
161/MUMNP/2005<br><br>
WO 2004/024119<br>
PCT/EP2003/009813<br>
-   1   -<br>
5  The present application relates to oil-containing personal wash compositions or emulsions (e.g., bars or liquids), preferably, cleansing, wash-off compositions or emulsions comprising particles having high refractive index (e.g., external surface having refractive index &gt;1.6) and defined 10  thickness, geometry and size (e.g., optionally<br>
hydrophobically modified mica particles meeting defined parameters).<br>
The particles are delivered, for example, in oil-containing 15  bar compositions or as particle-in-oil liquid emulsion<br>
compositions.  The particles enhance the shine of skin or other substrate on which they are deposited, and reduce the appearance of flaws or defects on the substrate (e.g., skin). 20<br>
In a further embodiment, the application relates to a method of enhancing skin shine and/or reducing flaws in the appearance of the skin using oil-containing personal wash compositions or emulsions comprising particles as noted 25  above.<br>
One of the attributes desired by consumers is shiny, healthy-looking skin.  Traditionally, skin "shine" has been achieved by depositions of oils onto substrates (e.g., skin 30  surface).  To the applicant's knowledge, use of specific particles of the invention in oil-containing, rinse-off<br><br>
WO 2004/024119<br><br>
PCT/EP2003/009813<br><br>
-   2   -<br>
personal wash compositions (e.g., to enhance shine) is not known.  This may be due in part to the inability (prior to the subject invention) to deliver such particles in a wash-off composition (bar or liquid). 5<br>
The use of particles generally (e.g., mica with green<br>
interference color) in personal care compositions is not<br>
novel.  Thus, for example, International Publication WO	(<br>
00/51551 (assigned to Procter &amp; Gamble) describes leave-on 10  skin care compositions containing coated mica with green interference color.  As indicated, the compositions are topical leave-on compositions (see abstract) designed for hand and body.<br>
15  The particles in the WO '551 reference are used as<br>
interference particles, not to enhance shine.  They have a<br>
Ti02 layer thickness in a range of from about 150 nm to<br>
about 250 nm (column 6, line 23); this is far smaller than<br>
the upper range of thickness claimed for the shine-enhancing   <br>
20  particles of the present invention (which typically have a thickness greater than 0.5 microns, or 500 nanometers).  It is also greater than the lower range of thickness claimed (thickness of less than or equal to 0.1 micron or 100 nanometers).<br>
25<br>
Also, the particles of the invention must have a flat, plate-like geometry to ensure shine enhancement.  Most critically, perhaps, the reference fails to teach or suggest that the particles may be used in oil-containing, rinse-off<br>
30  compositions.<br><br>
WO 2004/024119<br><br>
PCT/EP2003/009813<br><br>
-   3   -<br>
Particles having a thickness within the preferred range are<br>
also known (Timron® particles) but these particles have also<br>
not been used in oil-containing, personal wash, rinse-off compositions.  Further, they have not been hydrophobically 5  modified, as is required in at least one embodiment of the subject invention (i.e., when used as liquids) .<br>
Timron® particles sold by EM Industries, for example, are<br>
disclosed in a brochure but, as noted, there is no teaching 10  or suggestion in the brochure or any other art that the<br>
Timron® product can be used in oil-containing personal wash,<br>
rinse-off compositions (bar or liquid) to enhance shine. That is, there is simply no disclosure of such particles in oil-containing bars, or in particle-in-oil emulsions used as 15  personal wash compositions.<br>
In summary, pigments used in WO' '551 do not recognize the preferred particle thickness or criticality of refractive index. Also where particles of same thickness as those of<br>
20  the invention are known (Timron® products) , there is no<br>
teaching or suggestion of using these in oil-containing, personal wash, rinse-off compositions, for example to enhance shine.<br>
25  Unexpectedly, the applicants have now found that rinse-off personal wash compositions (preferably, but not necessarily, surfactant-containing) comprising flat, plate-like particles which particles (outer surface of particles) have a defined refractive index, a preferred thickness and maximum length,<br>
30  and wherein said particles are delivered in<br><br>
WO 2004/024119<br><br>
PCT/EP2003/009813<br><br>
compositions/emulsions comprising at least 0.01% to 75% oil provide superior shine compared, for example, to compositions having particles which are delivered in non oil-containing compositions. 5<br>
In one embodiment of the invention (e.g., when delivered from a liquid composition), the particle itself is also hydrophobically modified.  While not wishing to be bound by theory, this is believed to help the particle suspend better 10  in oil (e.g., particle suspended in a particle-in-oil<br>
emulsion and delivered as oil emollient) and be more readily delivered to substrate.<br>
More specifically, the present invention comprises a rinse-15  off personal wash composition comprising:<br>
(1)	0 % to 75 %, preferably 3 % to 65 % by weight composition of surfactant;<br>
(2)	0.01 % to 20 %, preferably 0.02 % to 10 % by wt. of a particle defined by.<br>
20	(a)  having an exterior surface which has a<br>
refractive index of &gt; 1.6;<br>
(b)	having a flat, plate-like geometry;<br>
(c)	having a length of particle less than 150 microns; and<br>
25	(d)  having 0 % to 5 %, preferably 0.001 % to 4 %<br>
by wt. particle of a hydrophobic modifying agent; and<br>
(3)	0.1 % to 75 %, preferably 0.5 % to 25 % by wt.,<br>
even more preferably 1 % to 15 % by wt. of a<br>
30	benefit agent or emollient.<br><br>
WO 2004/024119<br><br>
PCT/EP2003/009813<br><br>
-   5   -<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the personal wash composition is a liquid composition and particle (2) has 0.001% to 5%, preferably 0.0015 % to 4 % by wt. particle of a hydrophobic modifying agent. 5<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the particle (2) has a thickness of particle (whether hydrophobically modified or not) of greater than or equal to 0.5 microns, or less than or equal to 0.1 microns. 10<br>
In another embodiment, the invention comprises a method of enhancing shine of skin or other substrate using any of the compositions noted above.<br>
15  The present invention relates to compositions for and methods for enhancing shine of skin or other substrate.<br>
More specifically, the applicants have found that oil-containing, rinse-off, personal wash compositions comprising 20  specified platelet-like particles delivered in oil-containing bar compositions or as particle-in-oil liquid emulsions unexpectedly significantly enhance shine as defined by a shine measurement test disclosed herein.<br>
25  The novel personal wash compositions of the invention are rinse-off compositions. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed the required oil (e.g. emollient/benefit agent) helps deliver the particles which normally might be expected to readily wash off (providing no<br>
30  shine benefit) from such compositions.<br><br>

In one embodiment of the invention, the compositions of the invention comprise:<br>
(1)	0 % to 75 %, preferably 3 % to 65 % by wt. of a<br>
surfactant or surfactants selected from the group<br>
5	consisting of anionic, nonionic,<br>
amphoteric/zwitterionic, cationic surfactant and mixtures thereof;<br>

10	the following characteristics:<br>
(a)	having an exterior surface which has a refractive index greater than or equal to 1.6;<br>
(b)	having flat, plate-like geometry;<br>

microns; and (d)  having 0 to 5 %, preferably 0.001 % to 4 % by wt. particle of a hydrophobic modifying agent; and 20       (3)  0.1 % to 75 % by wt. preferably 0.5 % to 25 %, more preferably 1 % to 15 % of composition of a benefit agent or emollient.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, compositions are liquids and 25  particle (2) has 0.001 % to 5 %, preferably 0.0015 % to 4 % by wt. particle hydrophobic modifying agent.<br>

Finally, the invention also relates to method of enhancing shine using any of these compositions.<br>
Compositions of the invention are described in greater 5  detail below.<br>
The compositions of the invention are "rinse-off" compositions, by which is meant that they are intended to be rinsed off of the substrate, for example using water, after 10 • application, in contrast to leave-on lotions or cosmetics. The rinse-off composition may be applied as a bar or liquid, such as in personal wash liquids and bars.<br>
The compositions of the invention may comprise 0 to 75 %, 15  preferably 3 % to 65 % of a surfactant selected from the group consisting of anionic, nonionic,<br>
amphoteric/zwitterionic, cationic surfactant and mixtures thereof.<br>
20  Among suitable anionic actives which may be used are the alkyl ether sulfates, acyl isethionates, alkyl ether sulfonates, sarcosinates, sulfosuccinates, taurates and combinations thereof. Among suitable amphoteric actives may be included alkylbetaines, amidopropyl betaines, amidopropyl<br>
25  sultaines and combinations thereof.<br>
Alkyl ether sulfates of the present invention will be of the general formula<br>

C12-C15 Pareth-15 sulfonate.<br>
15  Another active type suitable for use in the present invention is that of the sulfosuccinates.  This category is best represented by the monoalkyl sulfosuccinates having the<br>
formula R2OCCH2CH(SO3—Na+) COO—M+; and amido-MEA sulfosuccinates of the formula: RCONHCH2CH2O2CCH2CH(SO3-M+)COO—M+; wherein R 20  ranges from C8-C20 alkyl, preferably C12-C15 alkyl and M is a<br><br>

Sarcosinates may also be useful in the present invention as a co-active.  This category is indicated by the general<br>
formula RCON(CK3)CH2CO2—M+, wherein R ranges from<br>
C8-C20 alkyl, preferably C12-C15 alkyl and M+ is a sodium,<br>
potassium ammonium or triethanolammonium cation.  Typical commercial products representative of these co-actives are those listed in the table below:<br><br><br>
WO 2004/024119<br><br>
PCT/EP2003/009813<br><br>
-   10   -<br>
Taurates may also be employed in the present invention as co-actives.  These materials are generally identified by the<br>
formula RCONR' CH2CH2SO3—M+, wherein R ranges from C8-C20 5  alkyl, preferably C12-C15 alkyl, R1 ranges from C1-C4 alkyl,<br>
and M+ is a sodium, potassium, ammonium or<br>
triethanolammonium cation.  Typical commercial products, representative of these co-actives are those listed in the table below:<br><br>
Within the category of amphoterics there are three general categories suitable for the present invention.  These<br>
include alkylbetaines of the formula RN+ (CH3) 2CH2CO2—M , 15  amidopropyl betaines of the formula<br>
RCONHCH2CH2CH2N+(CH3)2CH2CO2—M+, and amidopropyl sultaines of the formula RCONHCH2CH2N+ (CH3) 2CH2SO3—M+ wherein R ranges<br>
from C8-C20 alkyl, preferably C12-C15 alkyl, and M+ is a<br>
sodium, potassium, ammonium or triethanolammonium cation. 20<br>
Typical commercial products representative of these co-actives are found in the table below.<br><br>
WO 2004/024119<br><br>
PCT/EP2003/009813<br><br>
-   11   -<br><br>
Within the broad category of liquid actives, the most effective are the alkyl sulfates, alkyl ether sulfates, alkyl ether sulfonates, sulfosuccinates, and amidopropyl 5  betaines.<br>
Another preferred surfactant is an acyl isethionate having the formula<br><br>
10<br>
in which R denotes a linear or branched alkyl group and M denotes an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal or an amine.<br>
Another surfactant which may be used are the monoalkyl or 15  dialkylphosphate surfactants.<br><br>

PCT/EP2003/009813<br><br>
-   12   -<br>
Another mild surfactant which may be used, preferably used as primary surfactant in combination with other surfactants noted above, is sodium coco glyceryl ether sulfonate.  While desirable to use because of its mildness properties, this 5  coco AGS alone does not provide optimum lather creaminess. A sodium 90/10 coconut/tallow alkyl AGS distribution is preferred for creaminess.  Salts other than the sodium salt -such as TEA-, ammonium, and K-AGS and chain length distributions other than 90/10 coconut/tallow are usable at 10  moderate levels.  Also, some soap may be added to improve lather volume and speed of lathering.<br>
Certain secondary co-surfactants used in combination with AGS can also provide a creamier and more stable lather. 15  These secondary surfactants should also be intrinsically mild.  One secondary surfactant that has been found to be especially desirable is sodium lauroyl sarcosinate (trade name Hamposyl L, made by Hampshire Chemical) .<br>
20  The amphoteric betaines and sultaines noted above can be<br>
used as the sole surfactant, but are more preferred as a co-surfactant .  Nonionics generally should not be used as the sole surfactant in this product if high foaming is desirable; however, they can be incorporated as a co-<br>
25  surfactant.<br>
Nonionic and cationic surfactants which may be used include any one of those described in U.S. Patent No. 3,761,418 to Parran, Jr., hereby incorporated by reference into the 30  subject application.  Also included are the aldobionamides as taught in U.S. Patent No. 5,389,279 to Au et al; and the<br><br>
WO 2004/024119<br><br>
PCT/EP2003/009813<br><br>
-   13   -<br>
polyhydroxy fatty acid amides as taught in U.S. Patent No. 5,312,934 to Letton, both of which are incorporated by reference into the subject application.<br>
5  Soaps may be used at levels of about 0.1 % to 10 %.  Soaps can be used at higher level (for example, to provide soap-like feel) provided that the overall surfactant mixture is milder than soap and retains zein values within the scope of the invention.  The soaps may be added neat or made in situ 10  via adding a base, e.g., NaOH; to convert free fatty acids.<br>
A preferred surfactant active system is one such that acyl isethionate comprises 1 % to 15 % by weight of the total composition and/or an anionic other than acyl isethionate 15  (e.g., ammonium lauryl ether sulfate) comprises 1 % to 15 % by weight of the total composition and amphoteric comprises 0.5 % to 15 % by weight of the total composition.<br>
Another preferred active system is one comprising 1 % to 20 20  % alkyl ether sulfate.  Preferred surfactant systems may<br>
also contain 1 % to 10 % alkali metal lauryl sulfate or C14-C16 olefin sulphonate instead of acyl isethionate.<br>
Compositions according to the invention typically comprise 25  particle and oil.  One key to the subject invention is that<br>
the particles (e.g., TiO2 coated substrate, such as mica,<br>
optionally comprising SiO2 or other core) are used in rinse-off personal wash compositions which must comprise oil. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the oil is believed 3 0  critical to deposit particle (providing shine) in such<br><br>
WO 2004/024119<br><br>
PCT/EP2003/009813<br><br>
14   -<br>
rinse-off compositions.  The rinse-off can be a liquid composition (in which case hydrophobic surface modifier is also required) or a bar composition (where no modifier is needed). 5<br>
The particle which is used before forming the particle-in-oil compositions is itself defined by the following characteristics:<br>
10       (a)  it must have an external surface (whether<br>
substrate is solid or has a core) which has a refractive index of &gt;1.6 (where refractive index<br>
(n) of a substance is defined as Vv/V, where Vv<br>
is velocity of light in a vacuum and V is the<br>
15	velocity of light in the substance) ;<br>
(b)  it must have flat, plate-like geometry;<br>
(this distinction helps distinguish over, for<br>
example, the interference pigments of the art<br>
which need not be flat) ; 20       (c)  it must have a thickness of particle (whether the<br>
particle is hydrophobically modified as required<br>
in PW liquids or not) of &gt;0.5 microns or less than<br>
or equal to 0.1 microns; (d)  have a particle length of 
25<br>
This is important because the higher particle size can be more obviously seen, and therefore does not provide an aesthetic uniform appearance which would generally be more desirable to consumers.  Also, there may be some issues associated with safety for larger size particles; and<br><br>
WO 2004/024119<br><br>
PCT/EP2003/009813<br><br>
-   15   -<br>
(e)  optionally it has hydrophobic modification of the<br>
surface (except when used in liquid compositions<br>
where modification is required; this modification<br>
5	helps ensure deposition of the particle).<br>
Particles such as those described above are similar to those described in a Brochure to Rona® entitled "Special Effect Pigments", published 1998 (except for surface modification).<br>
10<br>
What neither the brochure, nor any other art of which applicants are aware, discloses, however, is use of rinse-off personal wash compositions comprising such particles and benefit agent or emollient (as oil-in-water emulsion in<br>
15  liquid or separate emollient in bar, for example).<br>
Specifically, compositions require 0.1 % to 75 %, preferably 0.5 % to 25 % by wt. benefit agent for minimal amount of deposition. 20<br>

The following examples are intended to further illustrate the invention and are not intended to limit the invention in 5  any way.<br>
Unless indicated otherwise, all percentages are intended to be percentages by weight.<br>
10  Methodology<br>
Shine Measurement<br>
All test sites were selected in the volar area of forearms 15  and three sites were chosen from each forearm.  For shine measurement, the Charm-view Microscope was used with a 3OX magnification lens under the parallel-polarized condition. PhotoSuite III was used to collect images in the bitmap format.  A program in IDL was developed to process the 20  captured images and list results in a text file.  The<br>
average shine intensity for the brightest 10 % of the pixels (3 072 0 pixels) was calculated as the shine intensity.<br>
First, all sites were washed with Lux®.  Baseline images<br>
25  were taken 15 minutes after washing with a Lux® formulation having compositions set forth in Table 1 below. For leave-on<br>
application, 11.6 μl of product was applied on test sites<br>
2 with a surface area of 7 cm . The  sample was rubbed for<br>
about 10 seconds with finger-cot.  Images were taken 15 30  minutes after the product application for initial shine<br><br>

enhancement evaluation.     For rinse-off applications,   25  μl<br>
of product was  applied on test sites with a surface area of<br>
2<br>
7 cm .  The sample was rubbed for about 15 seconds, then<br>
left on for 15 seconds followed by a 15 seconds rinsing. 5  Images were taken 15 minutes after the product application for initial shine enhancement evaluation.<br>
Preparation of Thickened Sunflower Seed Oil (TSS)<br>
10  TSS is a combination of 95 wt.% SSO and 5 wt.% thixcin<br>
(rheological additive).  The SSO was heated to about 85°C, then thixcin was added while mixing with sonicator.  When the mixture was cooled down, thixcin formed crystals inside the SSO.  As a result, a viscous, shear-thinning oil was<br>
15  obtained.<br><br>

Examples 1 &amp; 2 - Effect of High Refraction Index Coating, Surface Modification and Oil/Mica Interaction<br>
In the study below, actives were incorporated into a low 5  surfactant system shower conditioner formulation used as a rinse-off product.  The study was to show effect of the . particles of the invention (Examples 1 &amp; 2 versus.A &amp; B); the effect when using hydrophobically modified particle (Example 2 versus Example 1) ; and when used with emollient in composition 10  versus no emollient (Example 1 &amp; 2 versus C &amp; D)<br>
Specifically, composition with particle having index below 1.6 (Comparison B) has no additional shine enhancement relative to oil alone (Comparative A) and less shine 15  enhancement than particles of refractive index greater than 1.6 (Examples 1 and 2).  Further, the particle which is hydrophobically modified has even more shine (Example 2 versus 1).<br>
20  The following formulations were tested.<br><br>

PCT/EP2003/009813<br><br>
-   29   -<br>
From" Table 2,   it  can be seen that Sample B (using mica, which does not have a high refraction index coating) does not provide additional shine enhancement over Sample A (oil only).  When mica is coated with high refraction index<br>
5  material such as TiO2, a significant increase in shine<br>
enhancement is observed (Example 1 versus Comparative B).<br>
If the Ti02~coated mica surface is hydrophobically modified<br>
with C14, a further increase in shine enhancement can be achieved (Example 2).  However, if the coated mica without 10  surface modification were used without oil in the<br>
formulation, the shine enhancement ability is dramatically reduced (Comparatives C and D).<br>
This example demonstrates that the importance of high 15  refraction index coat, surface modification and oil/mica combination.<br>
Example 3 - High Surfactant System: Effect of Ti02-Coated Mica.<br>
20  In this example, surface modified TiO2 coated mica (Timiron<br>
MP 1001 AS) was incorporated into a shower gel system.  This formulation contains 8.5 % sodium lauryl ether sulfate (SLES) (Steol 330); 4.5 % CAPBet (zwitterionic surfactant); 10 % Timiron MP 1001AS/Amber wax/oil (10/20/70 ratio) and 1 25  % Carbopol.  This formulation provides a shine enhancement of 44 which is easily observable visually.<br>
In other words, the high refractive index particles enhance shine even in high surfactant system.<br><br>

Example 4 - Sensory Study of Shower Conditioner Formulations With/Without TiO2-Coated Mica<br>
In this example, the shine enhancement ability of the 5  surface modified TiO2-coated mica (Timiron MP 1001AS of<br>
Example 2) was evaluated by panelists instead of instrument. ..<br>
A difference test with 60 trials was conducted to investigate the effects of TiO2-coated mica in washing off<br>
0  applications.  5 % thickened SSO shower conditioner (Sample A) was used as a vehicle.  Six subjects were recruited. Each subject washed forearms with these two samples: vehicle or vehicle with Timiron MP 1001AS (Example 2) .  Sample A and Example 2 were used on the panelists left and right arm<br>
5  respectively.  Forty minutes after product application, ten evaluators were asked to choose from one of the three options: left arm has more shine, right arm has more shine or there is no difference in shine between two arms.<br>
0  Assuming each of the options has 1/3 chance to be chosen as guessing, the number selecting mica as delivering more shine out of 60 trials was significant at P

No difference	0.17<br><br>
WO 2004/024119<br><br>
PCT/EP2003/009813<br><br>
The results showed that clearly Timiron MP 1001 AS was an efficient material in adding more shine just after one wash off application.<br>
The examples basically show that, in a sample population, consumers preferred hydrophobically modified mica by almost 3 to 1 (0.66 versus 0.23).<br><br>
