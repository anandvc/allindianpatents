THE PATENTS ACT, 1970 (39 of 1970)<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10, rule 13)<br>
A STRIP MEMBER FOR LOCKING PLURALITY OF OUTLETS BY MEANS OF SINGLE PADLOCK<br>
GODREJ &amp; BOYCE MFG. CO. LTD. of LOCKS DIVISION PLANT-18, PIROJSHANAGAR, VIKHROLI, MUMBAI - 4 00 0 79 MAHARASHTRA, India, a INDIAN National Company<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br>
25-01-2005<br><br>
The invention relates to a strip member for locking plurality of outlets by means of single padlock. More particularly the invention relates to a strip member for locking plurality of outlets by means of single padlock for transporting inflammable liquid material to the destination securely.<br>
The oil tankers are provided with multiple outlets with valve members with wheels for opening and closing the valves, for loading and unloading inflammable materials during transportation. This inflammable materials are tampered and the genuine material does not reach to the customer. Therefore there is a need to device a pilferage proof locking system which can prevent the above defects.<br>
The conventional locking system used for transporting inflammable, hazardous material which are very sensitive to spark are kept in partitions in the tanker where there are several outlets which require to be locked. The conventional system of locking can be tampered open &amp; closed and therefore not safe.<br>
By research and development the inventor has invented a strip member for locking plurality of outlets by means of single padlock.<br>
The primary object of this invention is to provide a strip member for locking plurality of outlets by means of single padlock to prevent pilferage and malpractice's during transportation of inflammable material.<br>
The another object of this invention is to provide a   strip member for locking plurality of -outlets by means of single padlock so that genuine material and its correct weight reach to the destination.<br>
Our Co-Pending Application No: 833/MUM/2001<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to figure 1, 2, 3 and 4 in the accompanying specification.<br>
2<br><br>
Fig. 1: is  a  schematic  view  of the  improved   strip  member for locking plurality of outlets by means of single padlock.<br>
Fig. 2: is a top view of  the improved strip member for locking plurality of outlets by means of single padlock.<br>
Fig. 3 : is a front view of the improved strip member for locking plurality of outlets by means of single padlock.<br>
Fig. 4 : is a schematic view of the'top and bottom of the locking strips without stem member when in open / unlocked position.<br>
Accordingly there is provided a strip member for locking plurality of outlets by means of single padlock (1) comprising two strip members (2) top and (3) bottom pivotally connected at one end ; (4) said bottom member consists of a flat strip (5) with plurality of stem members (6) riveted on it at space matching with spacing of outlets/valve wheels of tanker said stem members are provided with locking bolts (7) having greater diameter then the stem member; the said top member having plurality of U shaped slots (8) at its one side with slots facing the stem member with matching spacing so that the slots portion are locked against the bolt member when the top strip is aligned with the bottom strips; the stern members are passed through the wheels of the individual outlet of oil tanker and the top strip is aligned with the bottom strip and locked by means of a padlock at the end (9) of thereby locking plurality of outlets by means of a single padlock.<br>
Referring to fig. 1 to 4 of a strip member for locking plurality of outlets by means of single padlock comprising a top strip (2) having multiplicity of U shaped slots (8) at one side. The diameter of the slot is less than the diameter of the bolt member. The U shaped slot are of greater or equal diameter of the stem member so that when the top strip pivottly connected at (4) are brought against the bottom member for locking the other end of the top and bottom members having slot through which the shackle of the padlock passes through.<br>
.     3<br><br>
The stem member (6) are mounted on the flat bottom member (3) at space matching with spacing of outlets/valve wheels each having a bolted top and the stem members are riveted on the bottom strip. The stem members are passed through the wheel of the tanker .<br>
valve and then the top strip is brought against the  bottom strip and in that position it is \J<br><br>
locked at the other end thereby locking the plurality of the outlets, with a padlock.	<br>
The material used for making the strips are from metal, composites   or from antispark material.<br>
The  bottom and top strips are hinged at one end and the other end  is provided  with the matching hole so that when they overlap a padlock can be used for locking.<br>
There is a provision that the master key is provided to the filling source and different common key to the individual user at the outlets so that filling and unloading is possible by authorized people only.<br>
An ultra locking system of padlock with/without restricted key way with master key with this improved locking strip effectively prevents such malpractice's.<br>
This is an embodiment of the invention several modifications are possible which may be considered within the ambit and spirit of this invention. Since any modification, variations and changes in detail may be made to the above described embodiment it is intended that all matters described in the foregoing description and illustration in the accompanying drawing may be considered within the spirit of this invention.<br>
4<br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1	A strip member for locking plurality of outlets by means of single padlock (1)<br>
comprising two strip members (2) top and (3) bottom pivotally connected at one end; (4) said bottom member consists of a flat strip (5) with plurality of stem members (6) riveted on it at space matching with spacing of outlets/ valve wheels of tanker said stem members are provided with locking bolts (7) having greater diameter then the stem member; the said top member having plurality of U shaped slots (8) at its one side with slots facing the stem member with matching spacing so that the slot portions are locked against the bolt member when the top strip is aligned with the bottom strips; the stem members are passed through the wheels of the individual outlet and the top strip is aligned with the bottom strip and locked by means of a padlock at the end (9) of thereby locking plurality of outlets by means of a single padlock.<br>
2.	A strip member (1) for locking plurality of outlets by means of single padlock as<br>
claimed in claim 1, wherein the strip member are made from brass stainless steel, iron<br>
or any nonferrous or composite strong material.<br>
3.	A strip member (1) for locking plurality of outlets by means of single padlock as<br>
claimed in claim 1 wherein the padlock is of any type with or without restricted<br>
keyway preferably ultra locking system with master key.<br>
4.	A strip member (1) for locking plurality of outlets by means of single padlock as<br>
claimed in claim 1 wherein the strip members are hinged at one end and provided<br>
holes at the opposite end so as to overlap on the matching holes during locking by<br>
means of padlock.<br>
