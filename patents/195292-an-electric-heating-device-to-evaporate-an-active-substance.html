The  present   invention provides  an  electric  heating device  to  evaporate  an active   substance.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Several state-of-the-art devices exist that are used for evaporating aromatic or active substances, for instance insecticides or fragrances, equipped with electric heating designed to nonpermanently release the active substances, only in case of need<br>
The aromatic or active substances can thus be supported by solid materials or be liquid<br>
Several state-of-the-art devices are known, for instance disclosed in registrations such as European Patent 90121288 6, Utility Model no 9203290/7, Utility Model 9501364/4, and others<br>
Due to their design, state-of-the-art devices have two drawbacks worthy of note, one of which is the large quantity of constituent parts they have, with the ensuing costs derived from the moulding of manufacturing process of said parts A second drawback is due to the substantial degree of difficulty the mounting process represents, which poses problems in connection with an automated mounting<br>
That is why said heating elements are expensive and hence barely competitive as compared with other conventional apparatus designed for similar purposes<br>
Another drawback of the state of the art is the absence of specific means devised for an easy, optional connection of additional elements, such as timers, adjusters, and others<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The company applying for the present Patent of Invention has used its expertise in the manufacture of devices of this kind, to devise heating<br><br>
-2-<br>
means to heat a body having a round shape, and provided with a hole to receive the wick carrying a means to be evaporated<br>
A first object of the invention is to achieve an arrangement of the kind aforesaid, designed so as to have a small number of constituent parts, which are sandwiched together in order thereby to provide a fully automatic assembly, which results in substantial costs savings<br>
A second object of the invention is to provide said device with heating means that use up little electricity in operation and produce a homogeneous heating, irrespective of the supply voltage<br>
This second object is achieved using a Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC) element for the heating to render the quantity of electric power released and the supply voltage independent from each other, due to the peculiar Positive Temperature Coefficient(PTC) characteristics, which self-stabilise and control temperature within a very wide voltage field.<br>
The invention successfully solves the problem that usually arises when PTC elements are employed, for, being very small components, approximately with a diameter of eight millmietres and a thickness of three millimetres, the transfer of heat energy is locally limited.<br>
Because in the device subject of the invention, the round body, which receives the means to be evaporated, must be heated as uniformly as possible, a special shape and material is used for the electrodes, which are ring-shaped in order to encircle the hole that is to be heated, and made of a material of good heat-conducting characteristics<br>
This organisation allows a single PTC element to be used to supply power with the ensuing economic savings<br>
In spite of the power concentration at the PTC location, a very uniform heating is achieved to meet requirements, given the characteristic that the electrodes fully surround the hole that is to be heated<br><br>
2A<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an electric heating device to evaporate an active substance, comprising: a housing with an electric heating element and adapted for use in an apparatus having a container carrying the substance to be evaporated and a wick through which the substance rises by capillary action up to the electric heating element; said housing comprising two molded parts assembled together to make up a closed compact package, a first of said parts being circular in plan view with a perimetric skirt covered by a second of the parts serving as a cover, both of said parts having axial through holes defining an axial passage for housing a wick to be heated which is soaked in the substance to be evaporated, said parts together forming an annular enclosure housing a disc shaped PTC element; and two twin electric contacts made of a material having good heat conduction characteristics and pressed on opposite sides of the PTC element, said contacts being shaped as an annulus and tightly encircling an outer wall of the axial passage defined by said through holes and in order to provide a homogeneous heat distribution, said twin contacts having an axial, perimetric wall for providing a greater contact surface with the outer wall of the axial passage, wherein said first part of the housing comprises supports positioned diametrically opposite from the PTC element in order to maintain a distance between the contacts, the distance being equivalent to the thickness of the PTC element.<br><br>
2B<br>
In another embodiment of the invention there is provided an electric heating device to evaporate an active substance, comprising:<br>
a housing with an electric heating element and adapted for use in an apparatus having a container carrying the substance to be evaporated and a wick through which the substance rises by capillary action up to the electric heating element; said housing comprising two molded parts assembled together to make up a closed compact package, a first of said parts being circular in plan view with a perimetric skirt covered by a second of the parts serving as a cover, both of said parts having axial through holes defining an axial passage for housing a wick to be heated which is soaked in the substance to be evaporated, said parts together forming an annular enclosure housing a disc shaped PTC element; and two twin electric contacts made of a material having good heat conduction characteristics and pressed on opposite sides of the PTC element, said contacts being shaped as an annulus and tightly encircling an outer wall of the axial passage defined by said through holes and in order to provide a homogeneous heat distribution, said twin contacts having an axial, perimetric wall for providing a greater contact surface with the outer wall of the axial passage, the twin contacts having respective extensions, the dimensions of said extensions lying within the limits of a structure made up of the housing and cover, spaces being formed respectively between said housing and cover and said extensions, said<br><br>
2C<br>
extensions being adapted to receive hook shaped electric connection terminals coupled by elastic pressure in the spaces.<br>
Further, the present invention also provides an electric heating device to evaporate an active substance, comprising: a housing with an electric heating element and adapted for use in an apparatus having a container carrying the substance to be evaporated and a wick through which the substance rises by capillary action up to the electric heating element; said housing comprising two molded parts assembled together to make up a closed compact package, a first of said parts being circular in plan view with a perimetric skirt covered by a second of the parts serving as a cover, both of said parts having axial through holes defining an axial passage for housing a wick to be heated which is soaked in the substance to be evaporated, said parts together forming an annular enclosure housing a disc shaped PTC element; and two twin electric contacts made of a material having good heat conduction characteristics and pressed on opposite sides of the PTC element, said contacts being shaped as an annulus and tightly encircling an outer wall of the axial passage defined by said through holes and in order to provide a homogeneous heat distribution, said twin contacts having an axial, perimetric wall for providing a greater contact surface with the outer wall of the axial passage.<br>
Preferably, the twin contacts have respective extensions which extend radially and project from a structure made up of<br><br>
2D<br>
the housing and the cover, and are adapted to allow the electric terminals of the heating element to be connected outside the housing.<br>
