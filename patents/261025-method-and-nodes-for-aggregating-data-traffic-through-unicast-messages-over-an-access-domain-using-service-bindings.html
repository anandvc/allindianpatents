This non-provisional patent application claims priority based upon the prior U.S. provisional patent<br>
applications entitled "Poly project" and "Access node-edge node complex protocol (AEP)", having<br>
respective application number 60/651,971, filed February 14, 2005, in the names of Sylvain Monette,<br>
Mathieu Giguere, Martin Julien and Benoit Tremblay, and application number 60/674,307, filed April 25,<br>
2005 in the names of Sylvain Monette, Mathieu Giguere, Martin Julien and Benoit Tremblay.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method and nodes for performing aggregation of data traffic by relying<br>
on Unicast messages in an environment using service bindings over an access domain.<br>
US 2002/199104 discloses a service control network which comprises edge nodes accommodating IPv6<br>
hosts holding information about the IPv6 hosts received from an AAA server. The AAA server may<br>
authenticate a terminal device, a router device as a communication node, an access network connecting<br>
the IPv6 network to a terminal device and the IPv6 hosts as a terminal device. However this document<br>
does not teach messaging between an access node and an access edge node located at an edge of the<br>
access domain for creating a service binding environment at the access edge node. Further it was not<br>
known that a user device MAC address can be replaced with a virtual MAC address recognized by the<br>
access node and the access edge node.<br>
US 2002/156613 discloses a virtual local area communication network over the terminal network. Each<br>
computer processor in the virtual local area communication network has a corresponding virtual MAC<br>
address and the virtual local area network provides communication among a set of computer processes<br>
but excludes the processors from the plurality not in the define set. The virtual MAC addresses are solely<br>
used within a cluster of processors as a means to ease configuration and deployment of processing<br>
platform. However this document does not teach that virtual MAC addresses can be exchanged between<br>
distinct nodes within an access domain.<br><br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Recent years have seen the explosion of Internet Protocol (IP) networks. Initially developed to allow<br>
universities and researchers to communicate and cooperate in research projects, it has grown into<br>
networks offered at a mass-market level. Nowadays, it is normal for households to have a connection to<br>
an IP network to surf the world-wide-web, play interactive games, carry Voice over IP, download<br>
documents and softwares, make electronic business transactions, etc.<br>
Reference is now made to Figure 1, which represents a prior art example of an IP network 100.<br>
Typically, an IP network is composed of an access domain 115, network service provider domains<br>
140 and application service provider domains 150. The access domain 115 includes Access Nodes<br>
(AN) 120 and an access network 130, such as an IP network. The ANs 120 are network providers,<br>
which can offer access to the IP network 13.0 to user domains 110. The user domains 110 include<br>
for example User Devices (UDs) (such as computers, mobile phones, personal digital assistants,<br>
etc.), Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wireless-LANs (W-LANs). The user domains communicate<br>
with the ANs over various possible technologies. Amongst those technologies can be found dial-<br>
up connections and Asymmetric Distribution Subscriber Line connections over telephone lines,<br>
cable modems connecting over television cable networks, or wireless communications. The access<br>
network 130 is composed of a group of independent routers, which task is to route incoming data<br><br>
traffic based on a destination address embedded therein. As for the network service<br>
provider domains 140, they may correspond for example to Voice over IP services, while the<br>
application service provider domains 150 may correspond to electronic banking and<br>
electronic business transactions.<br>
Though Figure 1 depicts three user domains, two Access Nodes, two service<br>
provider domains and two application service domains, IP networks 100 typically include<br>
several thousands of user domains, tenths of Access Nodes, hundreds of service provider<br>
domains and application service provider domains. As to the access network 130, it is<br>
common to encounter networks including hundreds of routers. It is thus understood that<br>
Figure 1 depicts a highly simplified IP network 100 for clarity purposes.<br>
To ensure a coordinated exchange of data traffic and messages over such IP<br>
networks, the IP protocol was developed in the early 1970's. The IP version 4 (IPv4) is used<br>
by a majority of currently deployed IP networks. IPv4 provisions for an addressing scheme<br>
using 32 bits, which results in a 4, 294, 967, 296 possible addresses, where each address is<br>
unique, and directly identifies one device. In the case of IP networks 100 such as the one<br>
shown on Figure 1, it is commonly known that such network rely on Ethernet-based data link<br>
to provide fast and simple transfer of data traffic and messages throughout the IP network<br>
100.<br>
But with the increasing number of devices communicating over the IP networks, and<br>
some inherent limitations of IPv4, the IP community has seen the need for a new revision of<br>
IP: IP version 6 (IPv6). That new version relies on an addressing scheme using 128 bits,<br>
which provides for a much wider number of possible addresses.<br>
Though IPv6 allows for a much greater number of IP addresses, and also addresses<br>
some deficiencies found in IPv4, both IPv4 and IPv6 are "best-effort" protocols. "Best-effort"<br>
means that a network delivers data traffic without making particular effort to meet higher or<br>
particular demands on a quality of service required for those types of data traffic. This might<br>
be sufficient for some network service providers 140 and application service providers 150,<br>
but unfortunately it proves to be insufficient for others. Thus, some network service<br>
providers 140 and application service providers 150 cannot easily and fluidly offer their<br>
services over IP networks 100.<br><br>
To overcome this problem, the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is being used<br>
over IP networks. MPLS relies on protocols such as Reservation Protocol (RSVP) for<br>
reserving a path, with a specific quality of service, over the IP network 100. RSVP initially<br>
creates a path through a series of routers. To create the path, each router adds an entry to<br>
its MPLS table. That entry indicates for data traffic arriving at a specific entry port and<br>
having a predetermined label, a corresponding output port and label to be used. By creating<br>
such reserved paths in the IP network 100, it makes it possible to carry data traffic for a<br>
larger spectrum of network service providers 140 and application service providers 150.<br>
However, with the increasing number of network service providers 140 and<br>
application service providers 150 requiring higher quality of service than "best effort", along<br>
with an expansion of the number User Domains 110 and Access Nodes 120 required to<br>
allow these User Domains 110 the possibility to use the access network 130, MPLS does not<br>
prove to be a good option.<br>
The initial principle at the basis of IP networks is to rely on routers, which perform as<br>
few and as little operations as possible before routing incoming data traffic towards their final<br>
destination. Also, it is a widely recognized concept that "best effort" networks are a trade-off<br>
between quality of service and quantity of data traffic. An increased quality of service, for<br>
the same number of routers results in a lower quantity of data traffic being transported on<br>
those routers. IP networks have not been designed bearing in mind higher level of quality of<br>
service. Thus, by creating reserved paths for higher quality of service data traffic over IP<br>
networks, a direct consequence is a reduced quantity of data traffic over those IP networks.<br>
In addition, such reserved paths needed for MPLS result in consuming more routing effort in<br>
each of the router on the reserved paths. Such routing effort is not significant when only a<br>
few reserved paths are open simultaneously, but with the current development of services<br>
applications requiring more than "best effort" quality of service, it is possible to envision that<br>
thousands of reserved paths will be required simultaneously over the IP networks.<br>
Maintaining and routing data traffic with so many reserved paths will become more<br>
cumbersome for routers, thus also resulting in slowing routing capabilities of the affected<br>
routers. Therefore, the current use of MPLS over IP networks for improving quality of<br>
service is resulting in less data traffic being exchanged, and in slower data traffic. Such<br>
impacts are not acceptable, as they directly affect all data traffic that is not part of the<br>
reserved paths.<br><br>
There is currently no known solution to the problems associated with the explosion of<br>
the number of user devices and of service providers offering services on IP networks.<br>
Furthermore, no long-term solution has been identified to allow a tangible and non-<br>
destructive solution to the need of increased QoS for certain services and applications.<br>
Accordingly, it should be readily appreciated that in order to overcome the<br>
deficiencies and shortcomings of the existing solutions, it would be advantageous to have a<br>
method and nodes for efficiently aggregating data traffic using service bindings over access<br>
domains, and more particularly a method and nodes for aggregating data traffic using<br>
Unicast messages is needed. The present invention provides such a method and nodes.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention efficiently allows thousands of network service provider<br>
domains and application service provider domains to communicate over an access domain<br>
by efficiently using service bindings. The method and nodes of the present invention<br>
perform data traffic aggregation over the access domain using service bindings and by<br>
modifying Unicast messages.<br>
For doing so, the method of the present invention performs data traffic aggregation<br>
over an access domain using service bindings, by upon receipt of a service request related<br>
message at an access edge node for a first device of a user domain, creating a service<br>
binding at the access edge node. The service request related message identifies the first<br>
device of the user domain and one of the service provider domains. The service binding<br>
rules data traffic between the first device of the user domain and the service provider domain<br>
by committing an access node serving the user domain and the access edge node in a<br>
manner of managing data traffic therebetween over the access domain. The method also<br>
informs the access node serving the user domain for which the service request related<br>
message is received of the created service binding. Then, the method enforces the created<br>
service binding at the access node and the access edge node for data traffic over the access<br>
domain between the first device of the user domain and the service provider domain by<br>
removing a user device MAC address from Unicast messages exchanged therebetween<br>
over the access domain and replacing with a virtual MAC address recognized by the access<br>
node and the access edge node.<br><br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to an access edge node for<br>
performing data traffic aggregation over an access domain using service bindings. More<br>
particularly, the access edge node is located in the access domain between user domains<br>
and service provider domains. The access edge node comprises an input/output unit, a<br>
service agent unit and a controlling unit. The input/output unit receives a service request<br>
related message for a first device of a user domain for a service provider domain, and<br>
receives and forwards Unicast messages. The service agent unit creates a service binding.<br>
The service binding rules data traffic between the first device of the user domain and the<br>
service provider domain over the access domain. The service binding commits an access<br>
node serving the user domain and the access edge node representing the service provider<br>
domain in handling of data traffic therebetween over the access domain. The controlling unit<br>
informs the access node serving the user domain for which the service request related<br>
message is received of the creation of the service binding through the input/output unit, and<br>
enforces the created service binding at the access edge node for data traffic between the<br>
first device of the user domain and the service provider domain over the access domain by<br>
removing a user device MAC address from Unicast messages and replacing with a virtual<br>
MAC address recognized by the access node and the access edge node.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention is directed to an access node for performing<br>
data traffic aggregation over an access domain using service bindings. The access node is<br>
located between user domains and the access domain. The access node comprises an<br>
input/output unit, an aggregation unit and a controlling unit. The input/output unit forwards<br>
data traffic from user domains over the access domain and receives service binding related<br>
messages. The aggregation unit stores and manages service bindings. The controlling unit<br>
evaluates the service bindings related messages received at the input/output unit and<br>
updates the stored service bindings accordingly. The controlling unit, in turn, controls data<br>
traffic and enforces the stored service bindings by removing a user device MAC address<br>
from Unicast messages received from the user domain and replacing it with a virtual MAC<br>
address of an access edge node.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
The innovative teachings of the present invention will be described with particular<br>
reference to various exemplary embodiments. However, it should be understood that this<br>
class of embodiments provides only a few examples of the many advantageous uses of the<br>
innovative teachings of the invention. In general, statements made in the specification of the<br>
present application do not necessarily limit any of the various claimed aspects of the present<br>
invention. Moreover, some statements may apply to some inventive features but not to<br>
others. In the drawings, like or similar elements are designated with identical reference<br>
numerals throughout the several views.<br>
The present invention provides a method and nodes for efficiently aggregating data<br>
traffic over an access domain using service bindings. For doing so, an access edge node is<br>
introduced within the access domain, between the user domains and the service provider<br>
domains. The access edge node includes a service agent unit, which manages and controls<br>
service agents. Each of the service agents corresponds on one hand to one of the service<br>
provider domain, and on the other hand manages and controls therefor a Virtual Local Area<br>
Network (VLAN) over the access domain. Whenever a user domain wishes to communicate<br>
with a selected one of the service provider domains, a service request related message is to<br><br>
the access edge node. The service request related message includes information identifying<br>
one of the service provider domain and one of the user domain. The access edge node<br>
determines whether one of the service agent correspond to the service provider domain<br>
identified in the service request related message, and if so creates a service binding for the<br>
received service request related message. The service binding identifies one of the service<br>
agents, user domain information and access domain transport primitives. Then, an access<br>
node serving the requesting user domain is informed of the creation of the service binding,<br>
and enforcement of the service binding is performed at the access node and access edge<br>
node so as to aggregate data traffic therebetween in accordance with the created service<br>
binding. The following paragraphs will provide a more detailed explanation of how service<br>
agents, service bindings, and the access edge node and access node are woven together so<br>
as to manage service bindings.<br>
The expression "data traffic" is used throughout the present specification and relates<br>
to messages and information transferred over a data network.<br>
To understand the present invention and its inventive mechanisms, reference is now<br>
made to Figure 2, which is a schematic exemplifying a network 200 in which the present<br>
invention has been incorporated. The schematic representation of the network 200 has<br>
been simplified for clarity purposes, and the various elements depicted have been grouped<br>
by similar functions rather than graphically representing geographical network entities.<br>
However, each group of similar functions would typically correspond to a multitude of<br>
physical network entities performing those specific functions, geographically scattered<br>
throughout the network 200. The schematic representation of the network 200 includes user<br>
domains 110, an access domain 115 (including: access nodes 120, an access network 130,<br>
an access edge node 160 and a regional network 135), network service providers 140, and<br>
application servers 150. An exhaustive description and examples for each of those elements<br>
will be provided in the following paragraphs, with continued reference to Figure 2.<br>
The network 200 corresponds to one or multiple data networks communicating<br>
together. Thus, the network 200 could be operated by one or multiple operators. As data<br>
networks are usually supported by a number of different operational entities and/or<br>
organizations, it is necessary to define how those entities and organizations can successfully<br>
communicate. For this reason, data networks are usually explained and detailed using the<br>
Open System Interconnection (OSI) model. The OSI model defines a networking framework<br>
for implementing protocols in seven layers. Those seven layers are in the respective order:<br><br>
1) Physical layer; 2) Data Link Layer; 3) Network Layer; 4) Transport Layer; 5) Session<br>
Layer; 6) Presentation Layer and 7) Application Layer. Each layer corresponds to an aspect<br>
to be considered and actions to be undertaken when performing data transmission over a<br>
data network. Using the OSI model to describe the network 200 of the present invention, it is<br>
possible to layer some of the various protocols used and/or supported by the network of the<br>
present invention as follows:<br>
Layer 2: Ethernet, Asynchronous Transfer Mode;<br>
Layer 3: Internet Protocol (IP) versions 4 and 6,<br>
Layers 4 and 5: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram<br>
Protocol (UDP); and<br>
Layers 6 and 7: various presentations and applications protocols currently<br>
existing and to come.<br>
It should be understood that the above list of protocols is provided for exemplary purposes,<br>
rather than for limiting the protocols supported by the present invention.<br>
Turning now to the access domain 115, it is possible to summarize its function as a<br>
means to provide end-to-end access between the user domains 110 and the network service<br>
providers 140 and application service providers 150. The access domain includes the<br>
access nodes 120, the access network 130, the regional network 135 and the access edge<br>
node 160. Thus, the access domain 115 is not an entity per se; it is rather an aggregation of<br>
components, which when interconnected together either directly or indirectly, act as a<br>
domain for providing access, hence its name "access domain". It should thus be clear that<br>
the current representation of the access domain 115 including only one access node 120,<br>
one access network 130, one access edge node 160 and one regional network 135 does not<br>
mean that such entities are found single in the access domain, but rather that for sake of<br>
clarity only one such entity is represented. The following paragraphs explain in greater<br>
details the various components of the access domain.<br>
The access nodes 120, which also include access gateways (not shown), represent<br>
the first component of the access domain 115. The access nodes 120 typically refer to<br>
access providers, which allow user domains 110 accesses to the access network 130, upon,<br>
for example, subscription or pay-per-usage basis. Such access can be made possible using<br>
various mediums and technologies. Amongst the possible mediums are cable, landline<br>
phone, and wireless phone. As to the possible technologies, Integrated Services Digital<br>
Network (ISDN) and Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL), Worldwide Interoperability<br>
for Microwave Access (WiMax) are examples of possible technologies. However, it should<br><br>
be noted that the present invention is not limited to those mediums or technologies. Also,<br>
even though only three access nodes have been depicted, it should be noted that the<br>
network 200 potentially includes hundreds or thousands of access nodes.<br>
The access domain also includes the access network 130 and the regional network<br>
135 which will be discussed together. The primary function of the access network 130 and<br>
the regional network 135 is to provide end-to-end, and independent transport between the<br>
access nodes 120 and the network service providers 140 and the application service<br>
providers 150. The access network 130 and regional network 135 are networks capable of<br>
tasks such as: aggregation, switching and routing downstream and upstream data traffic.<br>
The access network 130 is preferably capable of using Ethernet, or other similar protocols,<br>
which correspond to the Layer 2 of the OSI model, but is not limited thereto. It could<br>
advantageously be capable of supporting IPv4 and/or IPv6. The regional network 135<br>
preferably supports Ethernet and/or IP and MPLS, and possibly other Layer 3 capable<br>
protocols. Furthermore, it should be noted that the access network 130 and the regional<br>
network 135 could be operated and/or managed by a single operator or by many different<br>
operators.<br>
It is through a tight coupling of their traffic-engineering capabilities through the<br>
access edge node 160, that the access network 130 and the regional network 135 can<br>
provide end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS). The access edge node's role 160 is the<br>
creation, management and hosting of service agents 170 and service bindings (not shown in<br>
Figure 2, but depicted on Figure 4). Each of the service agents 170 corresponds to one of<br>
the service provider domains (140 or 150), and manages and controls therefor a VLAN over<br>
the access network 130. The expression "service binding" refers to a binding between the<br>
user domain 110 and one of the network service provider domain 140 or one of the<br>
application service provider domain 150. The access edge node and the concepts of<br>
service agents and service bindings will be described in further detail in the description<br>
referring to Figures 4, 5a and 5b.<br>
Turning now to the user domains 110, the latter rely on the access domain 115 for<br>
handling end-to-end communication with the network service providers 140 and the<br>
application service providers 150. It should be noted that in the present description, use of<br>
the word "domain" refers to one or multiple network elements sharing similar functional<br>
features. Thus, in the context of the present invention, the expression "user domains" may<br>
refer to independent computers, local networks of computers connected through a router<br><br>
either physically or wirelessly, wireless phones, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), and all<br>
other devices that are capable of data communication over a data network such as network<br>
200. Additionally, the expression "user domain" is intended to also include multiple<br>
simultaneous data traffic sessions performed with a multitude of devices, through one single<br>
user port. For example, a user could concurrently access different applications and network<br>
services such as Internet access, video conferencing, and television programs with one or<br>
multiple devices through a user domain located VLAN, or one single user port referred to<br>
herein as "user domain".<br>
The network service providers 140 refer to entities that use the access domain 115 to<br>
provide IP addressing and connectivity to another IP network, and to offer and deliver<br>
specific application. In the context of data traffic with the user domains 110, the network<br>
service providers 140 typically own and assign IP addresses to the user domains 110, using<br>
an identification based on for example Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service<br>
(RADIUS). The network service providers 140 may further perform user-level authentication<br>
and authorization if desired and/or necessary.<br>
The application service providers 150 use the access domain 115 to offer and deliver<br>
application to end-users of the user domains 110. Examples of such applications include<br>
gaming, video on demand, videoconferencing, and many other possible applications. It is<br>
however the access domain 115 that assigns IP addresses on behalf of the applications<br>
service providers to the user domains 110. If desired, the application service providers 150<br>
can also perform authentication at the user-level and authorization if necessary. It should be<br>
noted that in the foregoing description, the expression "service providers" and "service<br>
providers domains" will be alternatively used to represent concurrently both network service<br>
providers 140 and application service providers 150, and the expression "service provider"<br>
represents one of the network service providers 140 or application service providers 150.<br>
Reference is now made to Figure 3 that represents a simplified flowchart of a method<br>
for managing service binding in accordance with the present invention. The present method<br>
performs management of service bindings over the access domain 115, which transports<br>
data traffic between a plurality of network service providers 140 and application service<br>
providers 150, and user domains 110. The method may optionally start with a step 300 for<br>
establishing a plurality of service agents at the access edge node 160. However, it should<br>
be noted that the step 300 of establishing a plurality of service agents is not to be performed<br>
each time, but rather when an access edge node 160 is introduced in the access domain<br><br>
115. Afterwards, the method starts at step 310 with the receiving of a service request<br>
related message at the access edge node 160. The service request related message<br>
identifies one of the service providers and one of the user domains. The service request<br>
related message may have been generated for example through accessing by the identified<br>
user domain of a web page of the identified service provider. The method pursues with a<br>
step 320 for identifying whether one of the established service agents corresponds to the<br>
identified service providers 140 or 150. Then, the method has a step 330 for determining<br>
whether a new service binding is needed. If the determining step 330 is positive, the method<br>
pursues with a step 340 of creating a service binding for the received service request related<br>
message. The method then continues with step 350 of informing an access node 120<br>
responsible for providing access to the user domain identified in the service request related<br>
message, of the creation of the service binding. The access node 120 is thus informed that<br>
data traffic received from the user domain identified in the service request related message<br>
and addressed to the identified service provider is to be aggregated over the access domain<br>
in accordance with the created service binding. The method continues with step 360 which<br>
consists of enforcing the created service binding so as to aggregate data traffic to be<br>
transported over the access domain 115, received at the access node or the access edge<br>
node for the identified user domain and service provider, in accordance with the created<br>
service binding. In the event in step 330 that it is determined that a new service binding is<br>
not needed, the method further proceeds with a step 370 for determining whether a service<br>
binding already exists for the received service request related message and requires<br>
modifying. In the event that the outcome of the determination step 370 is that a service<br>
binding already exists but does not require modifying, the method then continues by<br>
returning to step 310 and waiting for the receipt of another service request message in step<br>
310. However, in the event that the outcome of the determination step 370 is that a service<br>
binding already exists and requires modifying, the method continues with step 380 of<br>
verifying whether the corresponding existing service binding requires to be removed in step<br>
380.lf the service binding needs to be removed, the method continues at step 390 with the<br>
removing of the service binding from the access edge node, and the step of informing 350 of<br>
the access node of the service binding to be removed and the step of enforcing 360 the<br>
removal of the service binding. In the event that it is determined that the service binding<br>
does not need to be removed in step 380, the method then continues at step 395 where the<br>
modifications indicated in the received service request message are performed, and the<br>
method continues from that point by going to step 350. Examples of modifications to the<br>
service binding including adding or removing a device from the user domain, modifying<br>
quality of service requirement, and many other examples, as further on described.<br><br>
As previously mentioned, a service binding relates to a transport relationship. That<br>
transport relationship is established between one of the user domains and one of the service<br>
providers, and directly impacts the serving access node 120 and one of the serving agents<br>
170 of the access edge node 160. Conceptually speaking, the creation of a service binding<br>
corresponds to adding the identified user domain to the VLAN corresponding to the service<br>
provider domain over the access domain. Thus, each service binding represents a tradable<br>
business entity, which guarantees delivery of the corresponding service, with the right<br>
integrity and QoS, between a specific user port of the user domain and a specific provider<br>
port of the service provider. Service bindings are created, managed and hosted in the<br>
access edge node, and exist in combination with the service agents 170.<br>
Since the service agents and service bindings are created, managed and hosted in<br>
the access edge node, reference is now made concurrently to Figures 2 and 4, where Figure<br>
4 is a schematic representation of an access edge node in accordance with the teachings of<br>
the present invention. To be able to perform the tasks of creation, management and hosting<br>
of the service agents and service bindings, the access edge node is composed of multiple<br>
elements. Because of its location in the access domain 115, the access edge node includes<br>
an input output unit including an access domain input/output unit 410 for communicating with<br>
the access network 130 of the access domain 115 and with access nodes 120. It is also the<br>
access domain input/output unit 410 that receives the service request related messages<br>
420. The input/output unit of the access edge node 160 also includes a network/application<br>
service provider domains input/output unit 430 for communicating with the network service<br>
providers 140 and application service providers 150 over the regional network 135.<br>
Furthermore, the access edge node 160 includes a service agent unit 440, a controlling unit<br>
450, and may further include a translation table 460, a forwarding unit 470 and a regulating<br>
unit 480.<br>
The service agent unit 440 is composed of a service agents management and control<br>
unit 442 and a service bindings hosting unit 444. The service agent unit 440 keeps existing<br>
service agents' 170 information in the service agents' management and control unit 442. The<br>
service agents' management and control unit 442 in turn is responsible for the creation and<br>
management of the service bindings 446. For doing so, the service agents management<br>
and control unit 442 determines when new service bindings 446 are required or can be<br>
removed, and proceeds with the creation/removal of service bindings 446. The service<br>
agents' management and control unit 442 is also responsible for the adding/removal of user<br><br>
devices to existing service bindings. Furthermore, the service agents management and<br>
control unit 442 is responsible for ensuring synchronicity of service bindings 446 related<br>
information with access nodes with which it is interacting. The service agents' management<br>
and control unit 442 is also responsible for the creation of Multi Protocol Label Switching<br>
(MPLS) reserved paths in the access network 130, when such a reserved path is required.<br>
The description accompanying Figures 7 and 8 will provide an exhaustive explanation of the<br>
various messages used by the service agents' management and control unit 442 to perform<br>
its various responsibilities.<br>
Reference to Figure 5a, which represents an exemplary tabular representation of the<br>
content of the service agents' management and control unit 442, is now concurrently made<br>
with Figure 4. Each of the rows of Figure 5a, at the exception of the first row, which is a<br>
header row, represents exemplary content of some of the service agents 170 managed and<br>
controlled by the service agents management and control unit 442. Each of the columns of<br>
Figure 5a corresponds to specific information, maintained by the service agents'<br>
management and control unit 442, for each of the service agents 170. The first column<br>
represents an identification of the service agent 170. That identification is typically a number<br>
or a service agent identifier corresponding to the service agent. In accordance to a preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention, each service agent in the access edge node has a unique<br>
service agent identifier, and corresponds to one specific service provider domain 140 or 150.<br>
The second column refers to an identification of a specific service type for the corresponding<br>
service agent. For example, in cases where one service provider domain 140 or 150 offers<br>
multiple services, each of the services offered is associated with a different service type so<br>
as to differentiate between the various services of a service provider domain. The third<br>
column identifies the preferred or necessary Quality of Service (QoS) required for properly<br>
transporting data traffic for that service provider domain and the related service type.<br>
Exemplary criteria for QoS may include delay, bit error rate, bandwidth, and preferred<br>
protocol. The fourth column indicates a port to be used in the regional network to<br>
communicate with the corresponding service provider domain. In addition to this content, the<br>
service agents' management and control unit 442 includes sufficient logical software and<br>
hardware to create additional service agents and remove unnecessary service agents. It<br>
should be noted as well that even though the content of the service agents' management<br>
and control unit has been represented in Figure 5a in the form of a table, such content is not<br>
limited thereto. The service agents' management and control unit could be composed of a<br>
relational database, hard coded components, microprocessors, programming library, etc...<br><br>
Reference is now made to Figure 5b, which represents an exemplary tabular<br>
representation of the content of the service bindings hosting unit 444, concurrently with<br>
Figure 4. Each of the rows of Figure 5b, at the exception of the header row, represents<br>
exemplary content of some of the service bindings 446 hosted in the service bindings<br>
hosting unit 444. Each of the columns of Figure 5b corresponds to specific information,<br>
hosted in the service bindings hosting unit 444, for each of the service bindings 446. The<br>
first column represents an identification of a corresponding service agent, by using for<br>
example the service agent identifier of the service agent. The second column identifies the<br>
service type, as described in relation with Figure 5a. The other columns represent the<br>
transport primitives for data traffic related to the service binding. More specifically, the third<br>
second column identifies a user domain Media Access Control (MAC) address. The fourth<br>
column consists of an identification of a port used by the user domain on the serving access<br>
node. The fifth column corresponds to the local network arbitrary identifier used by the user<br>
domain, and may include for example implicit or explicit VLAN information. The sixth column<br>
refers to a virtual MAC address of the access node serving the user domain. Hence, each<br>
service binding 446 binds together one of the service agents, one of the user domains and<br>
one of the access nodes for providing data traffic between one user domain and one service<br>
provider domain 140 or 150. It should be noted that even though the content of the service<br>
bindings hosting unit 444 has been represented in Figure 5b in the form of a table, such<br>
content is not limited thereto. The service bindings hosting unit could be composed of a<br>
relational database, hard coded components, microprocessors, programming library, etc...<br>
Furthermore, the service bindings hosting unit may further contain a seventh column<br>
which includes an IP address uniquely identifying the user domain or a user device thereof.<br>
That unique IP address could be provided to the user domain or user device by the access<br>
edge node through a protocol such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), using<br>
for example Broadcast mechanism that could be performed prior to the service request<br>
message. The combination of the service agent identifier and the user domain or user<br>
device unique IP address thus represents a simple and reliable way of quickly relating<br>
incoming messages to the proper service binding. Typically, once the service binding has<br>
been created, the access node has been informed thereof, and the data traffic is being<br>
aggregated over the access domain in accordance with the service binding, the aggregated<br>
data traffic received at the access edge node is disaggregated prior to its forwarding to the<br>
corresponding service provider domain using the information provided in the service<br>
bindings hosting unit. More particularly, in the case where the access domain is an Ethernet<br>
network, the service agent identifier is provided, for example, in the field known as the VLAN<br><br>
Tag of Unicast, Multicast and Broadcast messages, while the user domain or user device IP<br>
address is provided in IP messages embedded in the Ethernet messages. Based on the<br>
service agent identifier provided in the VLAN Tag field of Ethernet message, and on the IP<br>
address provided in the embedded IP message, the service agent unit 440 can disaggregate<br>
the data traffic and ensures its forwarding to the corresponding service provider domain, and<br>
inclusion of necessary information on the sending user domain, such as user MAC info and<br>
its local network context.<br>
Returning now to the description of Figure 4, the controlling unit 450 of the access<br>
edge node is responsible for determining, upon receipt of the service request related<br>
message 420, whether it corresponds to one of the service agents. For doing so, the<br>
controlling unit 450 consults the service agents' management and control unit 442 to<br>
determine whether one of the service agents 170 corresponds to the service provider<br>
domain identified in the service request related message 420. In the event that one of the<br>
service agents 170 corresponds thereto, the controlling unit 450 instructs the service agents'<br>
management and control unit 442 to create a service binding 446 for the received service<br>
request related message. The creation of a service binding 446 for the received service<br>
request related message 420 includes adding an entry in the service bindings hosting unit<br>
444, in which:<br>
the service agent ID (first column) corresponds to the service agent identifier<br>
for the service agent corresponding to the requested service provider domain;<br>
the user MAC info is the user device MAC address;<br>
the user port on access node is an identification of the port on the serving<br>
access node with which the user device is connected;<br>
the local network context corresponds to an arbitrary identifier provided in a<br>
field labelled "VLAN tag" of Ethernet messages to be received from the user device<br>
and corresponding a local user domain identifier; and<br>
the access node MAC is a virtual MAC address for the access node serving<br>
the user device for which the service request related message was received.<br>
Then, the controlling unit 450 informs the access node serving the user domain<br>
identified in the service request related message, through a service binding related message<br>
490 sent by the access domain input/output unit 410, of the creation of the service binding<br>
446. In the event that a service binding already exists for the service request related<br>
message 420, the controlling unit 450 informs the serving access node of the existing<br>
service binding through a service binding related message 490.<br><br>
The controlling unit 450 also interacts with the translation table 460. Since each<br>
service agent 170 of the service agents' management and control unit is uniquely identified<br>
by a service agent identifier, it is necessary to keep in the translation table a mapping<br>
between the service agent identifier corresponding to service agents 170 and corresponding<br>
service provider domains (140 or 150). Thus, upon receipt of data traffic at the access<br>
domain input/output unit 410 having a destination address corresponding to a virtual AC<br>
address for the access edge node 160 and a VLAN tag corresponding to one of the service<br>
agent identifier, the controlling unit 450 consults the translation table 460 to obtain a fast<br>
translation of the access edge node virtual MAC address to the destination service provider<br>
domain (140 or 150) address corresponding to the service agent identifier provided in the<br>
VLAN tag.<br>
The controlling unit 450 further consults with the forwarding unit 470, to determine<br>
whether received data traffic at the access domain input/output unit 410 is to be directly<br>
forwarded to the service provider domains input/output unit without any modification.<br>
Finally, the controlling unit 450 can also interact with a regulating unit 480, which can<br>
perform, on received data traffic at either the access domain input/output unit 410 and the<br>
network/application service providers domain input/output unit 430, downstream/upstream<br>
traffic policing and marking, traffic remarking, as indicated and/or required by corresponding<br>
service agents 170.<br>
Reference is now made to Figure 6, which is a schematic representation of one of<br>
the access nodes in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. Because of its<br>
location in the access domain 115, the access node 120 includes an access domain<br>
input/output unit 610 for communicating with the access network 130 of the access domain<br>
115 and with the access edge node 160. The access node 120 also includes a user<br>
domains input/output unit 620 for communicating with the user domains 110. A type of<br>
message received at the access domain input/output unit 610 is the service binding related<br>
messages 490. The service binding related messages 490 are generated by the access<br>
edge node 160, and sent over the access network 130. Examples of service binding<br>
messages 490 will be provided in the description of Figures 7 and 8.<br>
The access node 120 is capable of receiving and handling multiple service binding<br>
related messages 490. The service binding related messages 490 are received at the<br><br>
access node 120 from the access network 130, through the access domain input/output unit<br>
610. Upon receipt of a service binding related message 490, the access domain<br>
input/output unit forwards the received service binding related message 490 to the<br>
controlling unit 630. The controlling unit 630 extracts the contact of the service binding<br>
related message 490, and determines whether there are actions to be taken. An example of<br>
service binding related message 490 is the information about the creation of a new service<br>
binding. As previously described, when the access edge node 160 determines that a new<br>
service binding is required, it proceeds with its creation and informs the access node serving<br>
the requesting user domain of the creation of the service binding. The service bindings<br>
related message 490 used in this particular instance is called ADD_SB (add service<br>
binding). The ADD_SB message is sent from the access edge node 160 to the access node<br>
120, and contains information on the created service binding. The information contained in<br>
the ADD_SB message must then be incorporated into an aggregation unit 680 of the access<br>
node 120.<br>
One of the various responsibilities of the aggregation unit 680 is the hosting of<br>
service bindings related information. Service bindings related information contains specific<br>
service binding information (in the form of service agent identity and service type),<br>
identification on a port of the access node which received the service request related<br>
message, and local network context of the user domain.<br>
The access node 120 further handles incoming data traffic originating from/destined<br>
to user domains to which it provides access service to the access network 130. For doing<br>
so, the access node 120 further contains a translation table 650, a forwarding unit 660, a<br>
regulating unit 670 and an aggregation unit 680. For doing so, data traffic received at the<br>
access node 120 by either the user domain input/output unit 620 or the access domain<br>
input/output unit 610 is forwarded to the controlling unit 630. The controlling unit 630<br>
interacts with the translation table 650. Since each service binding stored in the service<br>
bindings hosting unit 444 of the service agent unit 440 is identified by a combination of<br>
parameters (service agent identity, service type, user device MAC address and access node<br>
virtual MAC address), it is necessary to keep in the translation table 650 a mapping between<br>
the service agent identity corresponding to service agents 170 and corresponding service<br>
provider domains (140 or 150). Thus, upon receipt of data traffic at the access domain<br>
input/output unit 610 having a destination address corresponding to the virtual MAC address<br>
of the access node 120, the controlling unit 630 consults the translation table 650 to obtain a<br>
fast translation of the destination address and VLAN tag so as to correspond respectively to<br><br>
the user domain MAC address and the local identifier. Such translation is required, because<br>
the user domain information is not carried over the access domain between the access edge<br>
node 160 and the access node 120.<br>
The controlling unit 630 further consults with the forwarding unit 660, to determine<br>
whether received data traffic at the access domain input/output unit 610 or at the user<br>
domain input/output unit 620 is to be directly forwarded to the corresponding user domain<br>
110 or the access network 130 without any modification.<br>
Finally, the controlling unit 630 can also interact with a regulating unit 670.<br>
Interaction with the regulating unit 670 is required, for example, when downstream/upstream<br>
traffic policing and marking, traffic remarking, is necessary, as indicated in the properties of<br>
the service binding.<br>
Now that the access node 120 and the access edge node 160have been described in<br>
detail, the foregoing describes more thoroughly how the data traffic is aggregated over the<br>
access domain. In typical Ethernet networks, three types of messages are used for<br>
exchanging data traffic between two entities: Unicast messages, Multicast messages and<br>
Broadcast messages. The Unicast messages are used to exchange data traffic between<br>
one sender and one recipient. The Multicast messages are used for efficiently sending data<br>
traffic from one sender to multiple recipients. As to the Broadcast messages, they are used<br>
to send messages from one sender to all nodes of the network. The present invention<br>
focuses on using service bindings in conjunction with Unicast message so as to aggregate<br>
data traffic over the access domain.<br>
Reference is now made to Figures 7a and 7b. Figure 7a depicts modifications<br>
performed in the network to Unicast messages in the upstream data traffic, in accordance<br>
with the present invention. Figure 7b is a diagram representing the modifications performed<br>
in the network to Unicast messages in the downstream of data traffic. In the present<br>
application, upstream data traffic refers to data traffic sent from the user domain 110 to one<br>
of the service provider domain 140 or 150, while downstream data traffic refers to data traffic<br>
sent from the service provider domain 140 or 150 to one of the user domains 110. Figures<br>
7a and 7b depict Ethernet Unicast messages for exemplary purposes, such as described in<br>
International Electrical and Electronic Engineering (IEEE) 802.3ac. Unicast messages<br>
typically include the following fields: a Destination Address (DA) 710, a Source Address (SA)<br><br>
720, a Type 730, a VLAN Tag 740 and User Data 750. The Destination Address 710 refers<br>
to an address for which the Unicast message is destined, and consists of 6 bytes. The<br>
Source Address 720 indicates from which address the Unicast message originates, and<br>
contains 6 bytes. The Type field 730 is 2 bytes long. The VLAN Tag 740 is 4 bytes long,<br>
and usually refer to a VLAN identifier only known and meaningful to the destination address<br>
and the source address. Finally, the user data 750 varies between 46 - 1500 bytes, and<br>
contains the data traffic being sent from the source address 720 to the destination address<br>
710.<br>
Turning now more specifically to Figure 7a, a Unicast message, originating from the<br>
User Device 110 is represented through its various modifications through the network in<br>
accordance with the present invention. The User Device generates a Unicast message<br>
700a, in which: the Destination Address 710 corresponds to a virtual MAC address for the<br>
access edge node 160, the Source Address 720 is the user device MAC address, and the<br>
VLAN Tag 740 corresponds to a local service identifier of the user device. The Unicast<br>
message 700a generated by the user device is sent and received by the access node 120,<br>
where some modifications are performed by the controlling unit 630 prior to forwarding the<br>
Unicast message over the access network 130. More particularly, the source address 720 is<br>
replaced by a virtual MAC address for the access node, and the VLAN Tag is changed to<br>
correspond to the service agent identification. The access node identifies the service agent<br>
identification from the service bindings stored in the aggregation unit. By replacing the user<br>
device MAC address, the access node improves the performance of the access network 130<br>
by reducing the learning and switching table of all routers and switches within the access<br>
network 130. The modified Unicast message 700b is sent from the access node over the<br>
access network 130 to the access edge node. The access edge node receives the modified<br>
Unicast message 700b, and changes back the source address 720 and the VLAN Tag 740<br>
to correspond to the source address and the VLAN Tag provided initially by the User Device<br>
in the Unicast message 700c. For doing so, the access edge node relies on the service<br>
binding information stored in the service bindings hosting unit 444. The Unicast message<br>
700c is sent from the access edge node 160 to the destination service provider domain 140<br>
or 150.<br>
Referring more specifically to Figure 7b, a description of the modifications to the<br>
Unicast message on downstream data traffic is now provided. The Unicast message 700d is<br>
generated at the service provider domain 140 or 150. The Unicast message 700d has a<br>
destination address corresponding to the user device MAC address, a source address<br><br>
equivalent to the service provider MAC address, and a VLAN tag corresponding to the local<br>
service identification known to the user domain. The access edge node 160 receives the<br>
Unicast message 700d and intercepts it so as to modify its content prior to sending it on the<br>
access network 130. The access edge node 160 changes the destination address to<br>
correspond to a virtual MAC address of the serving access node, modifies the source<br>
address to be the virtual MAC address of the access edge node, and replaces the VLAN tag<br>
by the service agent identification, so as to obtain Unicast message 700e. These<br>
modifications are performed by the access edge node based on the service binding existing<br>
at the access edge node 160 for data traffic between the recipient user device from the<br>
sending service provider domain. The Unicast message 700e is sent from the access edge<br>
node 160 to the service access node 120 over the access network 130. Upon reception of<br>
the Unicast message 700e at the access node 120, the latter relies on its controlling unit 630<br>
and its aggregation unit 680 to identify which service binding its relates to, and to modify the<br>
Unicast message 700e so as to bring it into a manner that will be recognizable by the user<br>
device 110. For doing so, the access node 120 changes the destination address to make it<br>
correspond to the user device MAC address, and modifies the VLAN tag field so as to<br>
correspond to the local service identification, known to the user device 110.<br>
As can be appreciated, the modifications to the Unicast message are visible only to<br>
the access node 120, access network 130 and the access edge node 160. The<br>
modifications to the Unicast message are transparent to the user device 110 and the service<br>
provider domain 140 or 150. The modifications are possible because of the service binding<br>
created by the access edge node 160, and enforced at both the access node 120 and the<br>
access edge node 160. The service binding stored at both the access node and the access<br>
edge node store the information required to perform the modifications to the Unicast<br>
messages. The results of the modifications include the aggregation of data traffic for a<br>
number of service provider domains 140 or 150 through the access edge node 160, and a<br>
better managing of the resources of the access network 130, without impacting the user<br>
domains 110 and the service provider domains 140 and 150.<br>
Although several preferred embodiments of the method and nodes of the present<br>
invention have been illustrated in the accompanying Drawings and described in the<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
METHOD AND NODES FOR AGGREGATING DATA TRAFFIC THROUGH UNICAST<br>
MESSAGES OVER AN ACCESS DOMAIN USING SERVICE BINDINGS<br>
The present invention relates to a method and nodes for performing<br>
data traffic aggregation over an access domain using service bindings. Upon receipt of a<br>
service request related message at an access edge node for a first device of a user domain,<br>
the service request related message identifying the first device of the user domain and one<br>
of the service provider domains, a service binding is created at the access edge node. The<br>
service binding rules data traffic between the first device of the user domain and the service<br>
provider domain by committing an access node serving the user domain and the access<br>
edge node in a manner of managing data traffic therebetween over the access domain. An<br>
access node serving the user domain for which the service request related message is<br>
received is informed of the created service binding. The created service binding is enforced<br>
at the access node and the access edge node for data traffic over the access domain<br>
between the first device of the user domain and the service provider domain by removing a<br>
user device MAC address from Unicast messages exchanged therebetween over the access<br>
domain and replacing with a virtual MAC address recognized by the access node and the<br>
access edge node.</td>
