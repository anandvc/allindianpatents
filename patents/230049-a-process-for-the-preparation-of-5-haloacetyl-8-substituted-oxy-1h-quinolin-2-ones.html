The present invention provides a process for preparing 5-(a-haloacetyI)-8-benzyloxy-(lH)-quinolin-1H-ones such as 5-(a-chhloroacetyl)-8-benzyloxy-(IH)-quinolin-1H-one5 which are useful intermediates from which to prepare 5-[{R)-1H-(5,6-diethyl-indan-1H-ylamino)-l-hydroxy-ethyl]-8-hydroxy-(1H)-quinolinone-1H-one salts.<br>
5-[(R)-2-(5,6-Diethyl-indan-1H-ylamino)-l-hydroxy-ethyl]-8-hydroxy-(1H)-quinolinone-1H-one salts are (3-selective adrenoceptor agonists with potent bronchodilator activity. For example, 5-[(R)-2-(5,6-diethyl-indan-1H-ylamino)-l"hydroxy-ethyl]-8-hydroxy-(1H)-quinolinone-1H-one maleate is especially useful for treating asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In addition, the maleate salt has been shown to have a very long duration of action in vitro and in vivo.<br>
In a first aspect the present invention provides a process for preparing 5-(a-haloacetyl)-8-substituted oxy-(1H)-quinolin-1H-ones comprising:<br>
(a)	reacting<br>
(i) 8-hydroxy-(1H)-quinolin-1H-one with an acylating agent and a Lewis acid to form 5-acetyl-8-hydroxy-(1H)-quinolin-1H-one; or<br>
(ii) 8-hydroxy-(lH)-quinolin-1H-one with an acylating agent to form 8-acetoxy-(lH)-quinoiin-1H-one, and treating, in-situ, the 8-acetoxy-(1H)-quinolin-1H-one with a Lewis acid to form 5-acetyl-8-hydroxy-(1H)-quinolin-1H-one; or<br>

agent in the presence of a solvent co form a 5-(c-haloacetyl)-8-substituted oxy-(ZH)-quinolin-1H-one.<br>
This process provides the 5-(a-chloroacetyl)-8-benzyloxy-(1H)-quinolin-1H-one in high selectivity and yield, and minimizes or eliminates the formation of regioisomers, such as 7-acetyl-8-benzyloxy-(1H)-quinolin-1H-one-(1H).<br>
