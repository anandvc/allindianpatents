				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a method for producing a two-dimensional panel for floor<br>
coverings, wall and ceiling coverings, preferably for applications in moisture-prone rooms,<br>
as well as to a panel produced according to the inventive method.<br>
For applications in the living, working and moisture-prone area, the specialised<br>
trade offers a range of panels, e.g. for production of parquet floors which consist of<br>
different materials and comprise different useful layers, depending on price class and field<br>
of application. Many such panels consist of a pressboard plate or a wood-fibre plate which<br>
has a plastics veneer or real-wood veneer on at least one side, wherein the panels are<br>
appropriately cut and are processed to floor coverings as well as to wall and ceiling<br>
coverings by the aid of the groove-and-tongue connections formed on the lateral surfaces.<br>
Conventional elements are, however, not usable in moisture-prone rooms since the<br>
carrying structure of the panels absorbs air humidity and releases the same, and since<br>
visible damages occur on the useful side and/or the lateral edges because of the resulting<br>
changes in shape due to moisture expansion and shrinking.<br>
A floor or wall covering is known from DE 199 51 812A1 which consists of<br>
several wood elements laid in joint compound structure, wherein the joints between the<br>
wood elements are filled with a water-proof, permanent-elastic and non-crack joint<br>
material. First, the individual wood components are glued onto an underground (e.g. floor<br>
screed) by means of an adhesive bond and, then, the joints between the elements are filled<br>
with the elastic joint material. A disadvantage is the relatively large labour effort, which is<br>
necessary at the location where the coverings are laid, during preparation of this floor<br>
and/or wall covering, in particular as regards filling of the joints with the elastic joint<br>
material.<br>
A similarly large labour effort results from the laying of a parquet floor according<br>
to DE 100 45 457 Al, wherein individual parquet elements are laid by the aid of a cross<br>
joint connector which engages with grooves on the rear side of the individual elements,<br>
and wherein the thus developing grooves are filled in situ with a permanent-elastic joint<br>
mass.<br><br>
According to DE 296 11 303 Ul individual wood tiles have a special profile all<br>
around the narrow edges, wherein there is a cut dovetail profile on the upper half and<br>
vertically a stop edge on the lower half. The joints formed by the dovetail profile are<br>
sealed with a joint mass in a water-proof and crack-resistant manner at the place where the<br>
coverings are laid.<br>
In DE 41 10 176 Al a pre-fabricated building-board element, a method for its<br>
production, as well as a device for conducting the method are described. When producing<br>
the building-board element as set forth in DE 41 10 176 Al, according to a predetermined<br>
joint pattern, several individual ceramics plates are fixed on the suction plates of a suction<br>
table by means of negative pressure applied onto the suction plates, with their visible side<br>
being oriented downwards. Then, from the visible side of the building-plate elements, the<br>
joint gaps are sealed against penetration of joint material by means of rubber elements.<br>
Thereafter, a hardenable joint mass is introduced into the remaining joint gaps, wherein<br>
the building-board element may be removed after hardening of the joint mass and<br>
elimination of the negative pressure applied on the suction plates of the suction table.<br>
Sealing of the joints between the individual ceramics plates is done by rubber beads<br>
projecting in the joint gaps so that after finishing of the building-board element, the joint<br>
mass has a concave joint chamfer on the side of the visible side of the building-board<br>
element.<br>
A pre-formed floor covering is known from US 2,018,711 A which consists of<br>
several individual plates which, according to the main claim, are first glued onto a flexible<br>
base by means of an adhesive bond, with the visible side being oriented downwards,<br>
wherein interspaces are left between the individual plates. Then, the flexible base with the<br>
individual plates glued thereonto is deformed such that the interspaces between plates will<br>
open (cf. Fig. 3). Thereafter, an elastic joint mass is introduced into the interspaces, the<br>
floor covering is put into a planar position (cf. Fig. 4) and the excessive joint mass is<br>
removed. After the joint mass has hardened, the flexible base is removed from the visible<br>
side of the preformed floor covering.<br>
Finally, a two-dimensional panel for floor coverings, wall and ceiling coverings, in<br>
particular for moisture-prone rooms, is known from WO 2004/042166 Al, wherein the<br><br>
panel may consist of several two-dimensional individual elements made of wood, stone,<br>
glass, metal, etc., the lateral surfaces of which forming an interspace which is filled with<br>
an elastic, water-repellent plastics or sealing mass. The plastics or sealing mass establishes<br>
the adhesive connection between the two-dimensional individual elements and forms a<br>
visible structural element at least on the useful side of the panel.<br>
The panel according to WO 2004/042166 Al is, however, relatively complicated<br>
and complex in production, wherein the production comprises the following steps:<br>
-	putting several two-dimensional individual elements onto a non-adhesive base, leaving<br>
interspaces between the adjacent lateral surfaces of the individual elements;<br>
-	fixing the individual elements on the base;<br>
-	introducing a water-repellent plastics or sealing mass into the interspaces;<br>
-	optionally scraping the excessive plastics or sealing mass; and<br>
-	removing the two-dimensional panel after the plastics or sealing mass has hardened.<br>
A further disadvantage resides in that during preparation of parquet floors,<br>
movement joints may arise between the abutting lateral surfaces of the panel into which<br>
moisture may penetrate.<br>
It is an object of the invention to suggest a method for a two-dimensional panel,<br>
which is simple in production, for floor coverings, wall and ceiling coverings or the like,<br>
which can also be used in moist areas, wherein a product is to be attained which is<br>
attractive in terms of visual appearance and function. A further object is to find an<br>
appropriate solution with respect to the movement joints between two abutting panels.<br>
The first object is inventively achieved in that<br><br>
-	at least one upper longitudinal groove is milled into a preferably multi-layered<br>
base panel, starting from its useful side,<br>
-	the longitudinal groove is filled with an elastic water-repellent plastics or sealing<br>
mass, and in that<br>
-	after hardening of the plastics or sealing mass, at least one lower longitudinal<br>
groove is milled into the panel, starting from its rear side, the depth of which groove<br>
reaching as far as to the sealing mass or into the sealing mass of one of the upper<br>
longitudinal grooves, thus forming an elastic expansion joint of the panel.<br>
Thus, in contrast to the configuration according to WO 2004/042166 A1, there is<br>
no longer the need for tediously putting individual rod-shaped elements onto an<br>
appropriate base, leaving equal interspaces, and to then jointing the same with the sealing<br>
mass, instead all longitudinal grooves necessary can be milled into a base panel in one<br>
procedure step, wherein afterwards the plastics or sealing mass is introduced and the<br>
surface is scraped by means of a scraper or the like. The panel is cut as far as to the<br>
plastics or sealing mass on one or several sites of the rear side in order to establish an<br>
elastic expansion joint.<br>
Thus, the inventive panel distinguishes itself in that it has at least one upper<br>
longitudinal groove on its useful side, said groove being filled with a water-repellent<br>
plastics or sealing mass, as well as in that the rear side of the panel has at least one lower<br>
longitudinal groove which reaches as far as to the sealing mass of one of the upper<br>
longitudinal grooves, thus forming an elastic expansion joint of the panel.<br>
The second object is inventively achieved in that<br>
-	one edge groove each is milled into a preferably multi-layered base panel,<br>
starting from its useful side, in the region close to the longitudinal sides of the panel,<br>
-	both edge grooves are filled with an elastic, water-repellent plastics or sealing<br>
mass, and<br><br>
- after hardening of the plastics or sealing mass, a groove as well as a tongue are<br>
milled on the longitudinal sides of the panel for a groove-and-tongue connection, wherein<br>
each of the outer lateral flanks of the sealing mass is milled.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment variant of the invention, furthermore,<br>
starting from the useful side in the region close to the front sides of the panel, one front<br>
groove each is milled, the two front grooves are also filled with an elastic, water-repellent<br>
plastics or sealing mass, wherein after hardening of the plastics or sealing mass, a groove<br>
as well as a tongue is milled on the front sides of the panel for a groove-and-tongue<br>
connection. Here, each of the outer lateral flanks of the sealing mass is milled and laid<br>
open.<br>
Thus, a panel is obtained which, on its longitudinal sides and front sides adjacent<br>
the useful side of the panel, has a water-repellent plastics or sealing mass which forms an<br>
outer framing of the panel. On all lateral and front sides, the panel is lined with the elastic,<br>
water-repellent plastics or sealing mass so that a movement joint, which is elastically<br>
closed due to the abutting sections of the plastics or sealing mass, is established when<br>
joining the panels, e.g. when laying a parquet floor.<br>
On the lateral and front faces of the panels, the plastics or sealing mass forms an<br>
effective edge protection during storage, transport and processing. Furthermore, it is<br>
prevented that water penetrates into the useful layer from the side and/or gets under the<br>
varnish layer during maintainance of parquet floors so that unattractive rims in the region<br>
of the joints between the individual panels are prevented.<br>
The inventive panels are excellently suited for floor coverings with floor heating as<br>
well as for areas with extreme climatic variations, since all longitudinal and transverse<br>
movements are compensated for by the elastic plastics or sealing mass.<br>
The panels may consist of solid wood or comprise a useful layer made of thermally<br>
treated or non-treated, domestic and/or foreign hardwood or coniferous wood, e.g. of<br>
beech, ash, maple, oak, larch etc. The wood used can be exposed to temperatures between<br><br>
180°C and 250°C in a high-temperature apparatus under controlled atmospheric<br>
conditions. With this temperature treatment, a high resistance against fungal and insect<br>
infestation is obtained as well as a high dimension stability is reached without the aid of<br>
chemical substances, wherein soaking processes and coatings can be completely omitted.<br>
Furthermore, dark attractive colourings which remind of precious wood are obtained by<br>
the method. Thanks to the thermal method, the degree of moisture expansion and<br>
shrinking can be reduced by up to 60%, depending on the kind of wood.<br>
Due to the plastics or sealing mass, preferably made of rubber, natural rubber,<br>
polyurethane, etc., a water-repellent panel is formed which is excellently suited for the use<br>
in both moisture-prone rooms and terraces. Because of the visually attractive surface, in<br>
particular when the plastics mass or sealing mass is of a colour, e.g. black, contrasting the<br>
regions where wood is used, an application in all living areas is conceivable. For example,<br>
the wood elements may have an oiled surface at least on the useful side of the panel,<br>
whereby a product is obtained which is particularly attractive for the living area.<br>
The individual panels are commercially available in packages, as are conventional<br>
panels for parquet floors, and may also be laid by do-it-yourselfers as usual.<br>
Preferably, the lateral flanks of the plastics or sealing mass are milled into the edge<br>
grooves as well as into the front grooves as far as to their half width so that a joint width is<br>
provided when joining the panels that corresponds to the joint width present within the<br>
panel.<br>
Furthermore, the inventive method distinguishes itself in that the upper<br>
longitudinal grooves and the two edge grooves are produced in one procedure step,<br>
wherein each upper longitudinal groove which, together with one of the lower longitudinal<br>
grooves, forms an elastic expansion joint, is milled more deeply than the other upper<br>
longitudinal grooves. Because of this measure, a better cohesion is achieved in the area of<br>
the expansion joint. As a sealing mass, e.g. plastics on the basis of a single-component<br>
polyurethane, or a sealing substance on the basis of a polymer (e.g. single or double-<br>
component sealing-adhesives on the basis of silicon-modified polymers) is/are used, which<br>
sealing-substances have a good adhesive property on wood and are chemically resistant<br><br>
against fresh water and salt water as well as against weak acids and lyes. Moreover, rubber<br>
mixtures and natural rubber as well as other suitable plastics with appropriate adhesive<br>
properties may be used.<br>
According to a further development of the invention, after filling and hardening of<br>
the plastics or sealing mass in the upper longitudinal grooves and the two egde grooves,<br>
the useful surface of the panel is smoothed and, optionally, varnished.<br>
A particular advantage of the invention resides in that as a starting product for the<br>
inventive method, a semi-finished product from parquet-floor production can be used, e.g.<br>
a panel with yet unprocessed longitudinal and front sides, i.e. with no groove and tongue<br>
millings.<br>
In addition to the use as a parquet floor, loose floor mats are also conceivable,<br>
which, due to the elastic sealing mass, adapt themselves to floor irregularities between the<br>
expansion joints of the panel, e.g. on the terrace or in the bathroom and/or sauna area. In<br>
this field of application, the panel, on the rear side, may comprise anti-slipping elements<br>
applied in a strip-shaped or point-shaped manner or over the whole surface.<br>
When using the invention as loose floor mats or as a floor covering, the outer rims<br>
of the panel may be layered with the water-repellent plastics or sealing mass for protection<br>
against penetrating moisture, or may also be chamfered or rounded.<br>
In the following, the invention will now be explained in more detail by way of the<br>
drawings. Therein:<br>
Fig. 1 shows an inventive two-dimensional panel for floor coverings, wall and<br>
ceiling coverings in a three-dimensional illustration;<br>

Fig. 1 in a first production step;<br>

Fig. 4 shows an embodiment variant of the inventive panel in a sectional<br>
representation according to Fig. 3;<br>
Fig. 5 shows a top view onto a further embodiment variant of the inventive panel;<br>
and<br>
Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 show sectional representations of the panel along line VI-VI in<br>
Fig. 5 in an enlarged illustration.<br>
The two-dimensional panel 1 which is illustrated in Figs. 1 to 3 for floor coverings,<br>
wall and ceiling coverings has a useful layer 2, a carrying layer 3 and, on the rearside, a<br>
counterlayer 4. The individual layers are glued by means of a glue in a known cross-wise<br>
way, wherein as a starting product of the production method, preferably a semi-finished<br>
product from parquet-floor production can be used, that is, a multi-layered base panel with<br>
yet unprocessed longitudinal and front sides.<br>
Such a panel is the basis for Fig. 2. In a first process step, several longitudinal<br>
grooves 6 are milled into the multi-layered base panel with equal distances, starting from<br>
its useful side 5. Preferably in the same procedure step, one edge groove 8 each is milled<br>
in the region close to the longitudinal sides 7 of the panel 1. Then, all longitudinal grooves<br>
6 and the two edge grooves 8 are filled with an elastic, water-repellent plastics or sealing<br>
mass 9 (cf. Fig. 3), and the projecting material is removed with a suitable scraping tool.<br>
After the plastics or sealing mass 9 has been hardened, at least one lower longitudinal<br>
groove 11 is milled into the panel 1, starting from its rear side 10, the depth of which<br>
groove reaching as far as to the sealing mass 9, so that the carrying layer 3 is interrupted<br>
and an elastic expansion joint 12 is formed in the panel 1.<br>
In a third process step, a groove 13 as well as a tongue 14 are milled on the<br>
longitudinal sides 7 of the panel 1 for a groove-and-tongue connection (cf. dot-and-dash<br>
lines on the longitudinal sides), wherein in each case the outer lateral flank 15 of the<br>
sealing mass 9 in the edge grooves 8 is milled.<br><br>
The groove-and-tongue connection on the front sides of the panel 1 (not illustrated<br>
here) is formed in the same way as on the longitudinal sides 7.<br>
As can be seen from Figs. 1 and 3, the lateral flanks 15 of the plastics or sealing<br>
mass 9 are milled preferably as far as to their half width so that an appearance with equal<br>
groove widths is obtained when joining several panels.<br>
As indicated in Fig. 2, the middle one of the upper longitudinal grooves 6, which<br>
later forms an elastic expansion joint 12 with a lower longitudinal groove 11, has a deeper<br>
milling than the other upper longitudinal grooves lateral to the middle longitudinal groove<br>
6. This results in that the sealing mass 9 in the expansion joint 12 has a larger adhesive<br>
surface, and the panel does not crack very easily along the expansion joint 12.<br>
According to the invention, the two edge grooves 8 are milled as far as to the<br>
region of the tongue 14 of the groove-and-tongue connection so that the plastics or sealing<br>
mass 9 has an L-shaped cross-section in the region of the tongue 14 (cf. Figs. 1 and 3).<br>
Thus, in the compound structure of the individual panels 1 a gap is formed which is well-<br>
sealed downwards and whose tightness can be additionally increased by adhesive bonding<br>
or gluing. In addition to the groove-and-tongue connection described, also clip or snap-in<br>
connections, which require no gluing, as well as any other connection systems are<br>
conceivable.<br>
In addition to the example illustrated in Figs. 1 to 3, many other embodiment<br>
variants are possible as well. Accordingly, several expansion joints 12 per panel can be<br>
provided in case of broad panels. Furthermore, it is possible to provide only one upper<br>
longitudinal groove 6 or also five or seven. In any case, the plastics or sealing mass 9 in<br>
the upper longitudinal grooves 6 off the expansion joint 12 reaches substantially only as<br>
far as to a boundary surface between the useful layer 2 and the carrying layer 3.<br>
The elastic plastics or sealing mass 9 can be injected into the longitudinal grooves<br>
6 and/or the edge grooves 8 may be injected also from the front side of the panel 1 if the<br>
useful side of the panel 1 is covered by a here non-illustrated shaping element, thus<br>
forming closed channels for the injection procedure. After injection of the elastic plastics<br><br><br>
or sealing mass 9 and after its hardening, the shaping element is removed and the useful<br>
side 5 of the panel 1 is optionally treated once again.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a typical panel 1 for a parquet floor, wherein the longitudinal grooves<br>
6 and the elastic expansion joint 12 have a width a of 4mm. The width b of the plastics or<br>
sealing mass 9 in the region of the groove 13 and the tongue 14 is 2mm, the equal distance<br>
c between the longitudinal grooves is about 41mm.<br>
The embodiment variant illustrated in Figs. 5 to 7 has only one middle longitudinal<br>
groove 6 which forms the expansion joint 12. Furthermore, the panel 1, on its longitudinal<br>
sides 7 and front sides 7', adjacent the useful side 5 has a water-repellent plastics or sealing<br>
mass 9 which forms an outer framing of the panel 1 and protects against water penetration<br>
(cf. Fig. 5). The panels may be connected with each other by the aid of an adhesive bond<br>
(e.g. single-component sealing mass on the basis of silicon-modified polymers) which is<br>
identical with the plastics or sealing mass 9 so that a completely homogeneous structure of<br>
the sealing joint between two panels is obtained after hardening.<br>
In Fig. 6, a production step of the panel 1 is illustrated, wherein the longitudinal<br>
and edge grooves have been filled and the expansion joint 12 has already been milled.<br>
After establishing groove and tongue (cf. dashed line in Fig. 6), the final product shown in<br>
Fig. 7 is obtained. Here, the distance c is 86mm, the width b of the sealing mass 9 on the<br>
longitudinal and front sides is 2mm and the thickness of the panel is 14mm. In general, the<br>
longitudinal grooves filled with the plastics or sealing mass 9 may have a width of<br>
between 2mm and 10mm, wherein the visible face plates (distance between two<br>
longitudinal grooves) have a width of between 10mm and 200mm.<br>
The panels 1 may also consist of solid wood or fibre plates or may also be<br>
structured in a double-layered and/or multi-layered (e.g. from plywood) way.<br><br><br>
