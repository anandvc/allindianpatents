3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to antiretroviral pharmaceutical composition. The invention particularly relates to an antiretroviral pharmaceutical composition having a selective combination of a controlled release active formulation and an immediate release active formulation for once daily administration. The invention also relates to the process for manufacture of such once daily antiretroviral pharmaceutical composition.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) which is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is one of the few diseases for which mankind is struggling to find a cure.<br>
In the last several years many antiretroviral agents have been discovered that have since been used to treat AIDS. The drugs that are currently approved for anti-HIV therapy are broadly classified into three categories, namely:<br>
1.	Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTI), which include lamivudine, zidovudine, didanosine, abacavir, stavudine, and zalcitabine.<br>
2.	Non-nucleoside   Reverse   Transcriptase   Inhibitors   (NNRTI),   which   include nevirapine, efavirenz, and delavirdine.<br>
3.	Protease Inhibitors (PI), which include indinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir and amprenavir.<br>
For successful treatment of any disease caused by a microorganism the drug used in the therapy should eliminate the causative organism completely without allowing them to undergo mutation. Mutation may lead to resistant strains that can make treatment more difficult. This development of resistant strains is usually observed when a single agent or drugs belonging to a single category are solely used in the treatment. For most<br>
2<br><br>
diseases caused by microorganisms, it has been found that combining two or more drugs, preferably from different classes have resulted in a greater success rate.<br>
Drugs for the treatment of highly active antiretroviral therapy were initially prescribed as a loose combination of two or three drugs. This was rationalised to fixed dose combinations to be administered twice daily. In our co-pending application number PCT/IN02/00110 we have described a formulation, which further reduced the pill burden to once a day. However to date there are no reports of once a day formulation comprising a three drug combination.<br>
There are three known alternative regimens as follows:<br>
1)	3 NRTIs<br>
2)	2 NRTIs + 1 NNRTI<br>
3)	2 NRTIs+1 PI<br>
Nucleoside-based reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) were the first drugs to be given as antiretroviral agents, and they remain the backbone of therapy against HIV infection and acquired immuno deficiency syndrome (AIDS).<br>
Although various therapy regimens have been tried as indicated above, it has been reported that drug combination comprising three NRTIs is not as effective as other combinations. The combination of two NRTIs, lamivudine and zidovudine which form the backbone of therapy with one NNRTI such as Nevaripine or Efavirenz is ideal. The serum half-life of Lamivudine is about 3 to 6 hours while that of Zidovudine is 1.1 hours. Nevaripine has a long half-life of more than 25 hours and is currently given as 200 mg twice daily. Efavirenz is approved for a dosing of 600 mg once daily.<br>
We propose to use 400 mg Nevaripine to be given as a fixed dose combination with lamivudine and zidovudine once daily. In case of Efavirenz the amount of efavirenz or pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof is 600-800mg preferably.<br>
Multi-drug therapy in case of antiretrovirals has the advantage that drugs have different mechanisms of action and act at different stages of the viral life cycle and they may<br>
3<br><br>
exhibit a synergistic effect on such use. However, this kind of therapy results in the patient having to take multiple pills several times a day and this is known to cause problems of compliance in following the therapy regimen. Several attempts have been made to reduce the pill burden in order to enhance patient compliance.<br>
Lamivudine 150mg and zidovudine 300mg are NRTIs that are to be given twice daily. A fixed dose combination of lamivudine 150mg and zidovudine 300mg (COMBIVIR) has been developed which has reduced the pill load for this combination to two. Similarly, a three drug fixed dose combination of lamivudine 150 mg, zidovudine 300 mg and abacavir 300 mg (TRIZIVIR) has also been developed. However, there are reports of toxicity related to abacavir. Further, the frequency of dosing for both two and three drug combination is still twice daily.<br>
United States Patent No. 6,113,920 discloses a pharmaceutical composition comprising two active pharmaceutical ingredients namely lamivudine and zidovudine and a pharmaceutically acceptable glidant ingredient, selected from a group of colloidal silicon dioxide, microcrystalline cellulose, metallic stearates, calcium carbonate and combinations thereof, in the form of a film coated tablet. The composition contains lamivudine in an amount from 15 to 1500 mg per tablet and zidovudine in an amount from 30 to 1000 mg per tablet. This combination is given twice daily.<br>
United States Patent No. 4,917,900 discloses a pharmaceutical formulation for oral administration in which discrete units comprising zidovudine are provided with a controlled release coating consisting of alkyl esters of acrylic and methacrylic acids and ethylcellulose in a weight ratio of 1:3 to 3:1. These spheroids contain at least 80% of zidovudine and microcrystalline cellulose and mannitol as the core-forming agent.<br>
As discussed above, while a two drug combination product may reduce the pill burden to half, it still has to be given twice daily and when coupled with a third drug, the pill burden is substantially increased.<br>
4<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide for a three-drug antiretroviral pharmaceutical composition, which would reduce the pill load and frequency of drug administration thereby favouring patient compliance and effective treatment.<br>
Another object is to provide a fixed dose combination of lamivudine, zidovudine and atleast one NNRTI drug suitable for once daily administration, which would reduce the pill burden to one and the frequency to once daily.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is directed to the development of a three drug fixed dose combination comprising essentially the antiretroviral drugs lamivudine, zidovudine, and at least one NNRTI drug preferably selected from nevirapine and efavirenz suitable for once daily dosing wherein lamivudine and zidovudine would have a controlled release while nevirapine/ efavirenz will be immediately released.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is related to a method of increasing the in vivo half life of Lamivudine and Zidovudine while not affecting the half life of Nevirapine or Efavirenz and thus reducing the pill burden in a patient suffering from HIV infection and / or Acquired Immunodefficiency Syndrome by administering a three drug antiretroviral composition which comprises of Lamivudine and Zidovudine as a controlled release component and nevirapine or efavirenz as an immediate release component<br>
Yet further object is directed to provide a process for preparing an antiretroviral pharmaceutical composition as above which would reduce the pill load and frequency of drug administration thereby favouring patient compliance and effective treatment.<br>

	Test:   Lamivudine 300  mg (as  ER)  + Zidovudine 600mg (as ER) + Nevirapine 400mg (OD) tablets	Reference:      Lamivudine      150      mg +Zidovudine 300 mg + Nevirapine 200 mg (IR/BD) tablets<br>
	Lamivudine	Zidovudine	Nevirapine	Lamivudine	Zidovudine	Nevirapine<br>
Cmax(mcg/ml)	1.79	1.54	5.17	1.51	1.49	2.88<br>
AUC(O-1) (mcg.hr/ml)	12.18	7.45	36.37	5.84	3.12	18.55<br>
T1/2 (hr)	5.67	2.74	29.34	2.98	0.72	17.82<br>
The results indicate that the composition of the present invention achieves a Cmax of Lamivudine and Zidovudine, which is equivalent to that obtained when the same drugs are administered in immediate release form. However, the invention also succeeds in increasing the AUCo-t values and the half lives of all the drugs in vivo.<br>
It is thus apparent from the above exemplary illustrations that the pharmaceutical composition of the invention serves as a three-drug antiretroviral combination for once daily dosage for a combination treatment especially of NRTIs and NNRTIs. The once daily dosage form of the invention is simple and cost-effective and would serve in reducing the pill burden and frequency of administration and favour patient compliance with the desired drug regime for effective treatment.<br>
