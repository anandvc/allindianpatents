				<td>NOVEL COMPOUNDS TO TREAT DIABETES AND ASSOCIATED CONDITIONS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present application is directed to novel antidiabetic compounds. The causes of Type i and Type II diabetes are still unknown, although both genetic and environmental factors seem to be involved. Type I diabetes (or insulin-dependent diabetes) is an autonomic immune disease in which the responsible autoantigen is-^till unknown. Patients with Type I diabetes need to take insulin intravenously to survive. Tvpe II diabetes (formerly referred to as non-insulin dependent diabetes) is a metabolic disorder resulting from the body"s inability either to make a sufficient amount of insulin or to properly use the insulin that is produced. Insulin secretion and insulin resistance are considered the major metabolic defects, but the precise genetic factors involved remain unknown. Patients with diabetes usually have one or more of the following defects: Under-production of insulin by the pancreas Over-secretion of glucose by the liver Defects in glucose transporters Desensitization of insulin receptors Defects in metabolic breakdown of polysaccharides In addition to the IV administration of insulin, currently available medications used for diabetes include 4 classes of oral hypoglycemic agents listed in the following table.<br><br><br><br>
As is apparent from the above table, there are disadvantages to each of the currently available agents for use in the treatment of diabetes. Accordingly, there is a continuing interest in the identification and development of new agents, particularly orally administered, water-soluble agents that can be used for the treatment of diabetes.<br>

formula I is shownbelow in Scheme IA. ompounds of the formula II were made starting from the second step   shown in Scheme I with the appropriate starting materials. The compounds of formula III may be made by utilizing the chemistry of the last step of Scheme I using the appropriate starting materials.<br>
Scheme IA<br><br><br>
1 lie compounds ot the present invention are useful in the treatment of diseases or disorders characterized by the presence of the elevated blood glucose levels, that is hyperglycemic disorders, such as diabetes melius, including both type I and II diabetes as well as other hyperglycemic related disorders such as obesity, increased cholesterol kidney related disorders, and the like. The compounds are preferably administered at least to reduce the blood glucose level in the host suffering from the hyperglycemic disorder. The sufficient amount of the compound is administered to the subject to reduced the blood glucose level to an acceptable range which is typically about plus or minus 10%, usually plus or minus 8%. and more usually plus or minus 5% of the normal average blood glucose level for the subject. A variety of hosts may be treated with the compounds to reduce blood glucose levels, such as humans and including mammalians host such as livestock, valuable or rare animals, and pets such as dogs and cats. The compounds may be administered by any convenient administration technique including, but not limited to. intravenous, intradermal, intramuscular, subcutaneous, or oral. The dosage delivered to the host will necessarily depend upon the route by which the compound is administered but will generally range from about 50-500mg/70kg human body weight, and usually from about 100-200mg/70kg human body weight.<br>
The compounds will be combined in a physiologically acceptable vehicle to produce a pharmaceutical composition. The nature of the physiologically acceptable vehicle will necessarily depend on the method for which the pharmaceutical^ composition is administered. Exemplary vehicles include water, that is, sterile water for injection, saline, such as phosphate buffered saline, lyophilized powder in the form of tablets or capsules where such forms may include various fillers ,      binders and the like. The amount of the active compound in the pharmaceutical composition will be selected in view of the method by which the pharmaceutical composition is to be administered, and may be determined empirically by those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Figures 1 through 5 present the results of preclinical tests performed using a compound according to the present invention, 4-(l-carboxy-2-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)) ethylenyl-4"-(2,2-dicarbomethoxy) ethyl diphenyl ether.<br>
When 6-week-old male ob/ob mice were given a 50 mg/kg dose of this compound or the vehicle daily for 7 days, the blood glucose concentrations of the mice given the<br><br>
compound were reduced 50% trom those ot the mice given the vehicle only, and the reductions of blood glucose concentrations were observed as early as Day 2 (see Figure 1).<br>
In another experiment. 6-week-old male diabetic ob/ob mice received the indicated oral doses of the test compound daily. Figure 2 shows that the lOmg/kg dose of the compound lowered blood glucose concentrations as effectively as the 50mg/kg dose. The blood glucose concentrations in lean control animals given the highest dose of the test compound (50 mg/kg) did not differ from those in animals given vehicle only.<br>
The ability of this test compound to lower serum triglyceride concentrations and blood pressure was studied in fructose-fed. insulin-resistant rats. For this experiment, male Sprague-Dawley rats initially weighing 150-175g were placed on a 60% fructose-enriched diet for 10 days. On Day 11. rats with hypertriglyceridemia were randomly assigned to receive oral doses of vehicle or the compound (50mg/kg) daily for 7 consecutive days. Serum triglyceride concentrations were measured 24 hours after each administration of test agent, and blood pressure was measured 18 hours after test agent administration. Figure 3 A shows that the test compound effectively lowered serum triglyceride concentrations in these rats, and Figure 3B shows that the rats treated with the test compound had significantly lower blood pressure than did those treated with vehicle.<br>
Basal glucose uptake of 3T3-L1 cells was measured in the presence of two different concentrations of the test compound (0.1 nM and 0.1 uM). Cells were incubated at 37°C for 48 hours with vehicle or the test compound, and then further incubated with ,4C-deoxyglucose for an additional 30 min at 22°C. The cells were washed and lysed, and the total radioactivity in the cells was measured. Figure 4 shows that the glucose uptake increased over the basal level in cells treated with the test compound. This result suggests that this test compound stimulates glucose uptake in differentiated adipocytes.<br>
In an experiment studying the expression of PPAR-y in the adipose tissue of mice, epididymal fat was collected from six different ob/ob mice either treated with vehicle or the test compound (50 mg/kg) for 10 days, homogenized in lyses buffer, and centrifuged. A total of 30 p.g of protein was loaded on to SDS polyacrylamide gel, immunoblotted, and probed with ami PPAR- y antibody raised against a 15-residue synthetic peptide containing conserved sequences of PPAR-y (see Figure 5 A). The bands were quantified and represented in bar graphs (see Figure 5B). The expression levels of PPAR-T in the tissues from vehicle-treated and the compound-treated animals did not differ from each other.<br><br>
The tests described above and illustrated in the figures show that the compounds according to the present invention lower blood glucose concentrations, lower serum triglyceride concentrations, lower systolic blood pressure, and increase glucose uptake by adipose tissue, but do not affect the expression of PPAR-y by adipose tissue.<br><br><br><br>
