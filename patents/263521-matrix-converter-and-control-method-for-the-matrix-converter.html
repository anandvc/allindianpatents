				<td>have been increasingly gaining attentions as next-<br>
generation power converter apparatuses.<br>
A three-phase to three-phase matrix converter is<br>
to obtain ac output voltages of variable voltages and<br>
variable frequencies by direct switching of a three-phase<br>
ac input voltage. As a typical modulation method, an<br>
analog base modulation method in which, with a virtual DC<br>
link formed, sinusoidal modulation is performed by carrier<br>
comparison is proposed in Document 1 (Jun OYAMA and other<br>
five, "VWF On-Line Control of PWM Cycloconverter", IEEJ<br>
Transactions D, IEEJ, Vol. 116 (1996), No. 6, pp. 664-651).<br>
Also, a control method for solving current distortion,<br>
which is an issue in asynchronism between output voltage<br>
command signal and carrier signal, is disclosed in Document<br>
2 (JP 11-341807 A) .<br>
The control methods of Documents 1 and 2, in<br>
either case, is based on an amplitude modulation which is<br>
accomplished by introducing a variable that is a current<br>
distribution ratio, i.e. a ratio of a mid phase current to<br>
a maximum phase current, and by multiplying a factor on<br>
each of an output voltage command signal and a carrier<br>
signal. Further, the control method of Document 2 involves<br>
two steps of control for suppressing changeover of<br>
switching patterns, which serve as information updating<br>
part, so that current distortion in carrier asynchronism is<br><br>
avoided. Due to this, matrix converters of Documents 1 and<br>
2 have an issue that control configuration and computation<br>
become more complex.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is a primary object of the present invention to<br>
provide a matrix converter, as well as a matrix converter<br>
control method, which allows the control-related circuit<br>
construction to be simplified without involving such<br>
computations as ripple computation or carrier amplitude<br>
modulation.<br>
In order to achieve the above object, the present<br>
invention provides a matrix converter for converting a<br>
three-phase ac input voltage into a specified three-phase<br>
ac output voltage, comprising:<br>
an output voltage command signal generating<br>
section for generating an output voltage command signal to<br>
output the specified three-phase ac output voltage;<br>
a current flow ratio generating section for<br>
generating a signal representing a current flow ratio based<br>
on a specified input current command signal;<br>
a signal correcting section for correcting the<br>
output voltage command signal based on the output voltage<br>
command signal generated by the output voltage command<br>
signal generating section and the signal representing the<br><br>
current flow ratio generated by the current flow ratio<br>
generating section;<br>
a PWM conversion signal generating section for<br>
generating a PWM conversion signal based on the output<br>
voltage command signal corrected by the signal correcting<br>
section and a carrier signal; and<br>
a conversion section for converting the three-<br>
phase ac input voltage into the specified three-phase ac<br>
output voltage based on the PWM conversion signal generated<br>
by the PWM conversion signal generating section.<br>
According to this matrix converter, based on the<br>
output voltage command signal generated by the output<br>
voltage command signal generating section and the signal<br>
representing the current flow ratio generated by the<br>
current flow ratio generating section, the output voltage<br>
command signal is corrected by the signal correcting<br>
section. Based on the corrected output voltage command<br>
signal and the carrier signal, the PWM conversion signal is<br>
generated by the PWM conversion signal generating section.<br>
With such a modulation method by input current flow ratio,<br>
a constant average virtual dc link voltage can be obtained<br>
and, as a result, the control-related circuit construction<br>
can be simplified without involving such computations as<br>
ripple computation or carrier amplitude modulation.<br><br>
In one embodiment, given that the input current<br>
command signals are represented by ir * , is* , it * and a<br>
voltage command is represented by Vs * , assuming that the<br>
lowest voltage phase or the highest voltage phase out of<br>
the output voltage command signal is a reference voltage,<br>
the current flow ratio generating section generates the<br>
current flow ratio of the maximum phase by<br><br>
and generates a sum of the current flow ratio of the maximum<br>
phase and the current flow ratio of the mid phase by<br><br>
In this embodiment, the current flow ratio of the<br>
maximum phase as well as the sum of the current flow ratio<br>
of the maximum phase and the current flow ratio of the mid<br>
phase are generated by the current flow ratio generating<br>
section based on the input current command signal, and the<br>
output voltage command signal is corrected by using the<br>
current flow ratios. Thus, the virtual dc link voltage can<br>
be maintained as a constant dc voltage.<br>
In one embodiment, given that the input current<br>
command signals are represented by ir* , is * , it * and that<br>
a phase angle of the input current command signals ir* , is<br>
* , it * relative to the output voltage command signal is<br><br>
represented by Ø , the current flow ratio generating section<br>
generates the current flow ratio by<br><br>
In this embodiment, in generating a current flow<br>
ratio based on the input current command signal, the<br>
current flow ratio generating section looks up to a single<br>
sine table, allowing further simplification to be achieved.<br>
In one embodiment, the carrier signal is a<br>
triangle wave signal having a generally constant amplitude.<br>
In this embodiment, the matrix converter is<br>
easily applicable to digital counters and comparators by<br>
virtue of its constant carrier amplitude, and suitable for<br>
digital control systems by virtue of its capability of<br>
maintaining the PWM modulation resolution constant.<br>
Moreover, the matrix converter, in which the triangle wave<br>
signal suitable for PWM modulation is used as the carrier<br>
signal, allows the circuit for pulse width modulation to be<br>
simplified.<br>
In one embodiment, the carrier signal is a<br>
sawtooth wave signal having a generally constant amplitude.<br>
In this embodiment, the matrix converter is<br>
easily applicable to digital counters and comparators by<br><br>
virtue of its constant carrier amplitude, and suitable for<br>
digital control systems by virtue of its capability of<br>
maintaining the PWM modulation resolution constant.<br>
Moreover, the matrix converter, in which the sawtooth wave<br>
signal is used as the carrier signal, allows carrier<br>
generation and modulation processing to be simplified.<br>
One embodiment further comprises:<br>
a holding section for holding the output voltage<br>
command signal corrected by the signal correcting section<br>
and power supply voltage information, wherein<br>
the holding section updates the output voltage<br>
command signal and the power supply voltage information at a<br>
timing of a peak of the carrier signal, and<br>
the PWM conversion signal generating section<br>
generates the PWM conversion signal based on the output<br>
voltage command signal and the power supply voltage<br>
information held by the holding section.<br>
In this embodiment, update of the output voltage<br>
command signal and the power supply voltage information is<br>
synchronized at the timing of the peak of the carrier<br>
signal, thus making it possible to prevent occurrence of<br>
current distortions as well as to achieve simplification of<br>
the control-related construction.<br>
According to the present invention, there is<br>
provided a matrix converter control method for converting a<br><br>
three-phase ac input voltage into a specified three-phase ac<br>
output voltage, comprising the steps of:<br>
generating an output voltage command signal for<br>
outputting the specified three-phase ac output voltage by an<br>
output voltage command signal generating section;<br>
generating a signal representing a current flow<br>
ratio by a current flow ratio generating section based on a<br>
specified input current command signal;<br>
correcting, by a signal correcting section, the<br>
output voltage command signal generated by the output<br>
voltage command signal generating section based on the<br>
output voltage command signal and the signal representing<br>
the current flow ratio generated by the current flow ratio<br>
generating section;<br>
generating a PWM conversion signal by a PWM<br>
conversion signal generating section based on the output<br>
voltage command signal corrected by the signal correcting<br>
section and a carrier signal; and<br>
converting the three-phase ac input voltage into<br>
the specified three-phase ac output voltage by a conversion<br>
section based on the PWM conversion signal generated by the<br>
PWM conversion signal generating section.<br>
In this matrix converter control method, based on<br>
the output voltage command signal generated by the output<br>
voltage command signal generating section and the signal<br><br>
representing the current flow ratio generated by the current<br>
flow ratio generating section, the output voltage command<br>
signal is corrected by the signal correcting section. Based<br>
on the corrected output voltage command signal and the<br>
carrier signal, the PWM modulation signal is generated by<br>
the PWM modulation signal generating section. With such a<br>
modulation method by input current flow ratio, a constant<br>
average virtual dc link voltage can be obtained and, as a<br>
result, the control-related circuit construction can be<br>
simplified without involving such computations as ripple<br>
computation or carrier amplitude modulation.<br>
As apparent from the above description, according<br>
to the matrix converter and the matrix converter control<br>
method of the invention, there can be realized a matrix<br>
converter in which the control-related circuit construction<br>
can be simplified without involving such computations as<br>
ripple computation or carrier amplitude modulation.<br>

information 8r and the power supply voltage phase<br>
information Vmax, Vmid, Vmin and the reference voltage X/Y<br>
held in the S/H sections 107, 108.<br>

carrier comparison section 105 performs amplitude<br>
modulation of a carrier signal based on a voltage ripple<br>
signal derived from the voltage ripple computing section<br>
102.<br>
Figs. 9A-9F show waveforms of individual sections<br>
by the matrix converter control method of the Comparative<br>
Example, where the input power factor is assumed to be 1<br>
and the output frequency is assumed as equal to that of the<br>
power supply for simplicity's sake. In this case, with<br>
regard to a magnitude relationship of three-phase ac<br>
potential, the mid phase potential is inverted in polarity<br>
in every 60-degree phase angle. Therefore, under the<br>
condition that based on the polarity of the mid phase<br>
voltage (positive: region X, negative: region Y), a<br>
reference waveform (minimum phase for the region X, maximum<br>
phase for the region Y) is changed, potentials with respect<br>
to the reference waveform are<br>
X : E max = V max - V min , E mid = V mid - V min<br>
Y : E max = V max - V min , E mid = V mid - V min<br><br>
where it is understood that two potentials can be obtained.<br>
Meanwhile, with respect to the command signal, a<br>
two-phase modulation waveform resulting from dividing a<br>
three-phase voltage command by a minimum phase is used. In<br>
this case, in the region Y, in which the potential becomes<br>
negative, the polarity is inverted to change over the<br>
waveform to one resulting from division by the maximum<br>
phase. From matching of the output voltage polarity in<br>
this way, the virtual dc link voltage results in a<br>
relationship expressed by the following equations:<br><br>
X : E max = V max - V min , E mid = V mid - V min<br>
Y : E max = -(V min - V max) , E mid = -(V mid - V max)<br><br><br><br>
where pulsating currents by two potentials shown in Fig. 9B<br>
are modulated.<br>
Next, the method for apportioning the command<br>
signal into two signals is defined by the current<br>
distribution ratio, which is a ratio of the mid phase<br>
current to the maximum phase current. Given a semi-cycle T<br>
of the carrier signal, a time T0 from a peak of the carrier<br>
signal to a switching to the mid phase, and a time T1 from<br>
a peak of the carrier signal to a switching to the maximum<br>
phase, the current distribution ratio 'a' is expressed by<br><br><br>
In this case, because of the expression with a power factor<br>
of 1, the ratio of phase voltage is used in Fig. 9A.<br>
Time ratios of connection to the maximum phase<br>
voltage and the mid phase voltage are determined by the<br>
following equations. In this connection, since the maximum<br>
phase value is multiplied by a voltage command value and<br>
the mid phase value is multiplied by a current distribution<br>
ratio, an average virtual dc link voltage is defined by a<br>
value resulting from addition of the mid voltage to the<br>
maximum voltage at a current distribution ratio.<br>
Max. phase	:	(T-T,)/T = V*S/Vtri ••• (1)<br>
Mid phase	:	(T1-T0)/T = aV*S/Vtri ••• (2)<br>
Max. + mid phase	:	(T-T0)/T = (l+a)V*S/Vtri ••• (3)<br>
Carrier amplitude	:	Vtri = Emax + aE mid<br>
In this case, for the region X, the phase of the<br>
lowest voltage out of the output voltage command signals Vu<br>
* , Vv * , Vw * is assumed as the reference voltage Vs * ,<br>
while for the region Y, a voltage command in which the<br>
phase of the highest voltage out of the output voltage<br>
command signals Vu * , Vv * , Vw * is taken as the reference<br>
voltage is assumed as Vs * .<br>
Therefore, the pulsating current is compensated<br>
by amplitude modulation of the carrier signal with the<br>
average virtual dc link voltage, and then PWM modulation<br>
through carrier comparison is performed with two command<br><br>
signals at conduction timing shown in Fig. 10. In this<br>
case, patterns of gating to one-phase portions of the<br>
maximum, mid and minimum phases are isolated by using the<br>
following logical equations:<br>
Max. phase	: X = (Vtri <v></v>
Min. phase	: Z = (Vtri&gt;(l + a)V*s)<br>
Mid phase	: Y = (XuZ).<br>
With respect to the input phase of connection, as<br>
shown in Fig. 11, gate signals for the respective switches<br>
are apportioned by logical circuits based on logic signals<br>
showing the magnitude relationships among the individual<br>
phases.<br>
In the matrix converter of this Comparative<br>
Example, since modulation is performed by multiplying both<br>
command signal and carrier signal by factors with the use<br>
of the current distribution ratio 'a', there has been a<br>
problem that the control configuration or computations<br>
would be complicated.<br>
In the matrix converter of the Comparative<br>
Example, the ratio of the mid phase to the maximum phase<br>
would be defined as the current distribution ratio.<br>
However, in the present invention, the current is<br>
distributed with a normalized current value.<br>
Figs. 3A-3F show normalized current waveforms in<br>
the matrix converter of the invention, where it is assumed<br><br>
that shunting with Cl is applied to the maximum phase and<br>
shunting with C2 is applied to the mid phase. Since the<br>
maximum phase is assumed as 1 in the method of the<br>
foregoing Comparative Example, multiplying by a factor of<br>
2/V3 to set 1 on the boundary of the region X and the<br>
region Y causes flow ratios among the individual phases to<br>
be expressed by the following relationship:<br><br>
In this case, for the region X, the phase of the<br>
lowest voltage out of the output voltage command signals Vu<br>
* , Vv * , Vw * is assumed as the reference voltage Vs * ,<br>
while for the region Y, a voltage command in which the<br>
phase of the highest voltage out of the output voltage<br>
command signals Vu * , Vv * , Vw * is taken as the reference<br>
voltage is assumed as Vs * . Although a sum of flow ratios<br>
of the maximum phase and the mid phase becomes over 1, the<br>
cos30° = —<br>
2<br>
voltage control rate of the maximum voltage command results<br>
from the virtual dc link voltage waveform as:<br>
Thus, the maximum value of flow ratios results in 1<br>
eventually.<br><br>
Multiplying two potentials of the virtual dc link<br>
by the above flow ratio results in an average virtual dc<br>
link voltage waveform. Since a constant dc voltage is<br>
obtained as shown in Fig. 3F, it can be understood that<br>
amplitude modulation of the carrier signal as in the<br>
Comparative Example is unnecessary.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a chart for explaining the<br>
conduction timing described above. At the conduction<br>
timing shown in Fig. 4, PWM modulation by carrier<br>
comparison is performed.<br>
Next, it is shown that the same results as in the<br>
Comparative Example can be obtained by the method of the<br>
invention. It is noted that the power factor is assumed as<br>
1, and the description will be given by phase voltage.<br>
For intervals with the phase angle ranging from<br>
30° to 60°, it follows that<br>
Emid = V^-V^ = Vs-Vt = -j|=(cos0,-cos0,) = cos(rf-*/3).<br>
In this case, since<br><br><br><br>
Comparative Example of Fig. 8, becomes constant in average<br>
virtual dc link voltage, eliminating the needs for blocks<br>
associated with the voltage ripple computation and the<br>
carrier amplitude modulation, so that its construction can<br>
be simplified.<br>
Although Equations (4) and (6) are shown as<br>
blocks for determining current flow ratios, yet it is also<br>
possible to further simplify the construction by looking up<br>
to a single sine table for the determination of mid and<br>
maximum values with the use of a phase angle Ø within the<br>
region X or region Y:<br><br>
Also, a case with the power factor of 1 only is<br>
shown above, and the switching of the region X and Y is<br>
performed by referencing the polarity of the mid phase of<br>
the power supply voltage (three-phase ac input voltage).<br>
However, when the input power factor is variable, it is<br>
also possible to control the power factor by switching with<br>
a phase of the mid phase to which a phase difference is<br>
added.<br>
In the matrix converter of the Comparative<br>
Example of Fig. 8, because the voltage command has a two-<br><br>
phase modulation waveform, the maximum phase and the mid<br>
phase out of the voltage command are subjected to PWM<br>
modulation, and apportioning to the individual phases is<br>
performed by using phase information 9r. Further, as a<br>
measure for a case where the synchronism between power<br>
supply frequency and carrier frequency is not ensured,<br>
updating timing is limited to the reference voltage X/Y,<br>
the voltage command phase information 9r and the power<br>
supply voltage phase information Vmax, Vmid, Vmin.<br>
Figs. 12A to 12D show timings at which distortion<br>
occurs in a case where the matrix converter of the<br>
Comparative Example is asynchronous. In this case,<br>
distortion occurs to three points of change, i.e. change of<br>
reference voltage, phase shift of the two-phase modulation<br>
waveform, and phase shift of the power supply voltage<br>
(current).<br>
Figs. 13A to 13D show effects on the above<br>
changes in individual switching states (maximum, mid and<br>
minimum) of the carrier cycle. These figures are shown by<br>
single-phase output for simplicity, where the phase having<br>
only one phase short-circuited by bold line is the 120°<br>
conduction phase of the two-phase modulation waveform while<br>
the other is any two phases. In the initial state, it is<br>
assumed that the maximum, mid and minimum voltages<br>
correspond to r phase, s phase and t phase, respectively.<br><br>
(1)	State of conduction to the maximum phase (shown in<br>
Fig. 13B)<br>
As the reference voltage X/Y changes, voltage<br>
command values of U and V phases are inverted while<br>
switching signals of r and t phases are switched over. As<br>
a result, the state changes from X (+-) to Y (-+) , whereas<br>
neither U nor V phase changes in switching state to the<br>
maximum and minimum phases.<br>
In a case where the conduction phase and the<br>
switching phase have changed due to a phase shift of the<br>
voltage command phase information 9r, switching between U<br>
phase and V phase causes the state to change from X(+-) to<br>
X(-+) so that the output changes from r phase to t phase.<br>
With regard to the power supply voltage phase<br>
information Vmax, Vmid, Vmin, when the maximum phase and<br>
the mid phase of the input voltage have been switched (r<br>
phase ↔ s phase) , the switch for the U phase to conduct<br>
changes from Sur to Sus•<br>
(2)	State of conduction in the mid phase (shown in<br>
Fig. 13C)<br>
When the reference voltage X/Y has changed, the<br>
state changes from X(+-) to Y(-+), so that both U phase and<br>
V phase change in switching state.<br>
As a result of a phase shift of the voltage<br>
command phase information 9r, the state changes from X(+-)<br><br>
to X(-+), so that both U phase and V phase change in<br>
switching state.<br>
As to the power supply voltage phase information<br>
Vmax / Vmid/ Vmin / when the maximum phase and the mid phase<br>
of the input voltage have been switched, the switch for the<br>
U phase to conduct changes from Sus to Sur.<br>
(3) State of conduction to the minimum phase (shown in<br>
Fig. 13D)<br>
When the reference voltage X/Y has changed, the<br>
state changes from X(+-) to Y(-+), so that both U phase and<br>
V phase change in switching state.<br>
As a result of a phase shift of the voltage<br>
command phase information 9r, the state changes from X(+-)<br>
to X(-+), whereas the switching state does not change<br>
because both U phase and V phase are in the minimum phase.<br>
With regard to the power supply voltage phase<br>
information Vmax, Vmid, Vmin, when the maximum phase and<br>
the mid phase of the input voltage have been switched, the<br>
switching state does not change because both U phase and V<br>
phase are in the minimum phase.<br>
As shown above, in the matrix converter of the<br>
Comparative Example, because of the presence of a mode in<br>
which a change of the signals does not cause a change of<br>
the switching state, it is permitted to update the<br>
reference voltage X/Y during the period of conduction to<br><br>
the maximum phase (Top), and the voltage command phase<br>
information 8r and the power supply voltage phase<br>
information VmaX , Vmid, Vmin during the period of switching<br>
to the minimum phase (Bas), so that balance of current<br>
distribution within the carrier cycle is ensured. Also,<br>
for the updating periods therefor are used a voltage<br>
command mid phase signal that minimizes the conduction<br>
period to the power supply maximum phase (Top) as well as a<br>
voltage command maximum phase signal that minimizes the<br>
conduction period to the power supply minimum phase (Bas).<br>
In the matrix converter of the Comparative<br>
Example, since the voltage command has a two-phase<br>
modulation waveform, the three-phase voltage command is not<br>
used, and only the maximum phase and the mid phase are<br>
subjected to PWM modulation, where phase information 9r is<br>
used for apportioning to the individual phases. Therefore,<br>
not only the reference voltage X/Y and the power supply<br>
voltage phase information (Vmax, Vmid, Vmin), which are<br>
subject to update limitations to avoid distortions due to<br>
asynchronism, but also phase information needs to be<br>
subject to update limitation. Further, update control<br>
involves the use of two signal levels, i.e. a mid phase<br>
signal and a maximum phase signal, giving rise to a problem<br>
of complicated construction of the control system.<br><br>
In the digital control of inverters, signal input<br>
and output are controlled in synchronization with the<br>
timing of PWM carrier cycles in order to take matching of<br>
signal delay time.<br>
In this connection, in the matrix converter of<br>
the invention, on the assumption that a signal wave to be<br>
modulated is updated and held at the timing of a peak of<br>
the carrier signal as shown in Fig. 5, the signal is<br>
switched in a state of conduction to the minimum phase. In<br>
this case, the voltage command phase information 9r and the<br>
power supply voltage phase information Vmax, Vmid/ v"min<br>
correspond to updatable timings, whereas the invention uses<br>
the three-phase voltage command, containing phases, so that<br>
update control for the phase information 9r becomes<br>
unnecessary. The power supply voltage phase information<br>
Vmax/ Vmid, Vm i n is updated in synchronization with the<br>
timing of a peak of the carrier signal.<br>
Also in this invention, the reference voltage X/Y<br>
is updated at the timing of a peak of the carrier signal as<br>
well. The timing of a peak of the carrier signal<br>
corresponds to the minimum phase, where update control<br>
would be performed by level signals, in conventional cases,<br>
so that the input current distribution within the carrier<br>
cycle is unbalanced as shown in Fig. 6A and 6B. On the<br>
other hand, as to the update in the maximum phase, there<br><br>
occurs no changes in switching state with respect to the<br>
changeover of the reference voltage X/Y as shown in Fig. 6C<br>
and 6D.<br>
Changes in switching state by update timing in<br>
this invention are shown in Fig. 5A and 5B. In this case,<br>
with respect to the minimum phase level signal, waveform<br>
update is performed at the timing of a peak of the carrier<br>
signal. As a result, whereas the switching state of the<br>
maximum phase and the minimum phase is changed, the<br>
waveform is maintained symmetrical, making it understood<br>
that current distribution of a half carrier cycle keeps<br>
equal, as compared with the updated waveform in the maximum<br>
phase.<br>
As shown above, update of the reference voltage<br>
X/Y and the power supply voltage phase information Vmax,<br>
Vmid, Vmin is synchronized at the timing of a peak of the<br>
carrier signal in which the voltage command is updated and<br>
held, thus making it possible to prevent occurrence of<br>
current distortions as well as to achieve simplification of<br>
the control-related construction.<br>
In addition, the update of control information in<br>
the pulse pattern generating section 17 of Fig. 2 can be<br>
provided by using such a circuit as shown in Fig. 7 as an<br>
example.<br><br>
According to the matrix converter of this<br>
embodiment, the average virtual dc link voltage is made<br>
constant by the modulation method with the use of input<br>
current flow ratio, eliminating the needs for ripple<br>
computation and computations for carrier amplitude<br>
modulation, so that the control-related construction can be<br>
simplified.<br>
Further, the matrix converter is easily<br>
applicable to digital counters and comparators by virtue of<br>
its constant carrier amplitude, and suitable for digital<br>
control systems by virtue of its capability of maintaining<br>
the PWM modulation resolution constant.<br>
Moreover, the matrix converter is enabled to<br>
reduce input current distortions even in cases of<br>
asynchronism of three-phase ac input voltage and carrier<br>
cycle, with a simple construction in which the output<br>
voltage command and the power supply voltage (current)<br>
information are updated and held at the timing of carrier<br>
peaks.<br><br>
