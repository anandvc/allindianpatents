				<td>VARIABLE BLEED SOLENOID RECOVERY SYSTEM<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/860,009, filed on November 17, 2006. The disclosure of the<br>
above application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates to methods and systems for<br>
controlling shifts of a clutch to clutch transmission.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0004] Automatic transmissions typically include several fluid operated<br>
torque transmitting devices such as clutches. The clutches automatically engage<br>
and disengage according to a predefined pattern to establish different speed<br>
ratios between input and output shafts of the transmission.<br>
[0005] The various speed ratios of the transmission are typically<br>
defined in terms of the ratio Ni/No, where Ni is the input shaft speed and No is<br>
the output shaft speed. Shifting between various speed ratios generally involves<br>
disengaging a clutch associated with the current or actual speed ratio, and<br>
engaging a clutch associated with the desired speed ratio. The clutch to be<br>
1<br><br>
released is referred to as the off-going clutch, while the clutch to be engaged is<br>
referred to as the on-coming clutch. Shifts of this type are referred to as clutch-<br>
to-clutch because no speed responsive or freewheeling elements are used.<br>
[0006] The engaging and releasing of the clutches is controlled by<br>
solenoid operated valves that supply hydraulic fluid to the clutches. For example,<br>
a variable bleed solenoid (VBS) valve is a current-controlled, electro-hydraulic<br>
actuator that provides an outlet pressure that is a precise function of the current<br>
applied to the valve. A constant pressure is supplied to the valve through a fixed<br>
control orifice to a control chamber formed by the valve. The control chamber<br>
pressure can be controlled by allowing the control chamber to bleed to a<br>
reservoir through the variable orifice formed by the VBS valve. With this<br>
structure, a VBS valve can regulate fluid pressure from a maximum value to a<br>
minimum value.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] A recovery control system and method for automatic<br>
transmissions includes a diagnostic module that determines a fault condition of a<br>
variable bleed solenoid (VBS) when the automatic transmission fails to establish<br>
a desired drive ratio. A recovery module initiates a recovery cycle of the VBS<br>
based on the fault condition. The fault condition includes one of a clutch stuck-<br>
on condition and a clutch stuck-off condition. A clutch controlled by the VBS fails<br>
to disengage during the clutch stuck-on condition, and the clutch fails to engage<br>
during the clutch stuck-on condition.<br>
2<br><br>
[0008] In other features, the diagnostic module increments one of a<br>
first count value and a second count value associated with the VBS when the<br>
diagnostic module detects one of the stuck-on condition and the stuck-off<br>
condition, respectively. The recovery module initiates the recovery cycle when<br>
the diagnostic module increments one of the first count value and the second<br>
count value.<br>
[0009] In other features, the diagnostic module stores a first threshold<br>
and a second threshold associated with the stuck-on condition and the stuck-off<br>
condition, respectively, and the diagnostic module activates a fault indicator<br>
when one of the first count value and the second count value exceeds one of the<br>
first threshold or the second threshold, respectively. The recovery module<br>
continues to execute the recovery cycle when the diagnostic module activates<br>
the fault indicator.<br>
[0010] A recovery control system for a variable bleed solenoid (VBS)<br>
for an automatic transmission includes a recovery module that initiates a<br>
recovery cycle of the VBS when one of a first value and a second value that<br>
correspond to a clutch stuck-on condition or a clutch stuck-off condition,<br>
respectively, is detected. A diagnostic module activates a fault indicator when<br>
one of the first value and the second value exceeds one of a first threshold and a<br>
second threshold, respectively. A clutch controlled by the VBS fails to disengage<br>
during the clutch stuck-on condition and the clutch fails to engage during the<br>
clutch stuck-on condition.<br>
3<br><br>
[0011] In other features, the diagnostic module increments one of the<br>
first value and the second value associated with the VBS when the diagnostic<br>
module detects one of the stuck-on condition and the stuck-off condition,<br>
respectively. The recovery module initiates the recovery cycle when the<br>
diagnostic module increments one of the first value and the second value. The<br>
recovery module continues to execute the recovery cycle when the diagnostic<br>
module activates the fault indicator.<br>

specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0018] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should be<br>
understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals<br>
indicate like or corresponding parts and features. As used herein, the term<br>
module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic<br>
circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that executes one<br>
or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or<br>
other suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0019] Referring now to Figure 1, a vehicle is shown generally at 10.<br>
The vehicle includes an engine 12 that drives a transmission 14 through a torque<br>
converter 16. Air is drawn into the engine 12 through a throttle 18. The air is<br>
mixed with fuel and combusted within cylinders (not shown) of the engine 12 to<br>
produce drive torque. The torque converter 16 supplies the engine torque to the<br>
transmission via an input shaft 20. The transmission 14 is a multi-speed<br>
automatic clutch-to-clutch transmission that drives an output shaft 22 based on<br>
engine torque. As can be appreciated, the transmission can also be any type of<br>
automatic transmission. For exemplary purposes, the present disclosure will be<br>
discussed in the context of the clutch-to-clutch transmission.<br>
5<br><br>
[0020] The output shaft 22 drives a driveline 24 of the vehicle 10. A<br>
range selector 26 enables an operator to set the transmission at a desired<br>
operating range including, but not limited to, park, reverse, neutral, and one or<br>
more forward drive positions. Speed and torque relationships between the<br>
engine 12 and the driveline 24 are controlled by hydraulically operated clutches<br>
C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5 of the transmission 14 that enable, for example, six<br>
speed ranges. Pressurized fluid is provided to the clutches from a regulated<br>
hydraulic pressure source 28. The clutches are coupled to the hydraulic<br>
pressure source 28 via control valves 30, which regulate clutch pressure by<br>
supplying or discharging fluid to/from the clutches C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5. A<br>
control module 32 controls variable bleed solenoids (VBSs) 34-1, ..., and 34-n,<br>
referred to collectively as VBSs 34, to operate the control valves 30. Variable<br>
bleed solenoids are electronically controlled valve mechanisms which generate<br>
output signals based on control signals transmitted from the control module 32.<br>
In the present implementation, the control module 32 selectively controls various<br>
combinations of the VBSs 34 to achieve various drive ratios. Each of the VBSs<br>
34 may control one or more clutches.<br>
[0021] Referring now to Figure 2, in the exemplary transmission, the<br>
clutches C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5, referred to collectively as the clutches, are<br>
selectively engaged to provide neutral, six forward drive ratios, and one reverse<br>
drive ratio. Although the exemplary automatic transmission 14 includes six<br>
forward drive ratios and one reverse drive ratio, it is appreciated that the recovery<br>
control system according to the present disclosure can be implemented in<br>
6<br><br>
automatic transmissions having more or fewer drive ratios. In the present<br>
implementation each forward drive ratios. The table of Figure 2 illustrates an<br>
exemplary combination of engaged clutches to establish the various drive ratios.<br>
[0022] The first forward drive ratio is established by engaging the first<br>
clutch C1 and the fifth clutch C5. The second forward drive ratio is established<br>
by disengaging the fifth clutch C5 and substantially simultaneously engaging the<br>
fourth clutch C4. To establish the third forward drive ratio, the fourth clutch C4 is<br>
disengaged as the third clutch C3 is engaged. The fourth forward drive ratio is<br>
established by disengaging the third clutch C3 while engaging the second clutch<br>
C2. To establish the fifth forward drive ratio, the first clutch C1 is disengaged as<br>
the third clutch C3 is substantially simultaneously engaged. The sixth forward<br>
drive ratio is established by disengaging the third clutch C3 and simultaneously<br>
engaging the fourth clutch C4. The reverse drive ratio is established by engaging<br>
the third clutch C3 and the fifth clutch C5. The transmission 14 is in neutral when<br>
only the fifth clutch C5 is engaged.<br>
[0023] Each drive ratio requires the engagement of different<br>
combinations of the clutches. Further, shifting between successive forward ratios<br>
(shift pattern) is accomplished by disengaging one of the clutches, deemed the<br>
off-going clutch, and substantially simultaneously engaging the next clutch,<br>
deemed the on-coming clutch, while another clutch is engaged during the<br>
transition. For example, given the exemplary transmission described above,<br>
shifting from the first drive ratio to the second drive ratio is achieved by keeping<br>
clutch C1 engaged, disengaging clutch C5 and engaging clutch C4.<br>
7<br><br>
[0024] Referring back to FIG. 1, a first speed sensor 36 is responsive<br>
to a rotational speed of the input shaft 20 and generates an input shaft speed<br>
signal. A second speed sensor 38 is responsive to a rotational speed of the<br>
output shaft 22 and generates an output shaft speed signal. A temperature<br>
sensor 40 is responsive to a temperature of a transmission fluid and generates a<br>
transmission fluid temperature signal.<br>
[0025] Operation of the pressure source 28 and the control valves 30 is<br>
controlled by the control module 32 via the VBSs 34 in response to various input<br>
signals. The input signals include, but are not limited to, the input shaft speed<br>
signal (NT), the output shaft speed signal (No), the transmission fluid temperature<br>
signal (Ft) and a range selector position signal that is generated by the range<br>
selector 26. The control module 32 generates control signals based on the input<br>
signals to energize select VBSs 34 to achieve a desired drive ratio. The VBSs<br>
34 regulate the hydraulic pressure supplied by the control valves 30. Clutch<br>
pressure effects shifting between speed ratios by controllably releasing the<br>
pressure in an off-going clutch and controllably applying pressure to an on-<br>
coming clutch.<br>
[0026] The recovery control system of the present disclosure delays<br>
reporting a fault code that indicates performance degradation of the vehicle 10<br>
until the recovery control system attempts to reestablish proper operation of the<br>
vehicle 10.<br>
[0027] Referring now to FIG. 3, the control module 32 includes a<br>
diagnostic module 100 and a recovery module 150. The diagnostic module 100<br>
8<br><br>
communicates with the VBSs 34, the first speed sensor 36, the second speed<br>
sensor 36, the temperature sensor 40, and the range selector 26. The diagnostic<br>
module 100 determines that one of the VBSs 34 is experiencing a fault condition<br>
(i.e. a failed VBS) when the transmission 14 fails to establish a desired drive ratio<br>
required by the shift pattern. The diagnostic module 100 identifies the failed VBS<br>
based in part on the on the range selector position signal, the input shaft speed<br>
signal, and the output shaft speed signal.<br>
[0028] Several problems can cause the fault including, but not limited<br>
to, debris within the failed VBS, debris within a control valve 30, and/or a<br>
malfunction of one of the clutches. As discussed above with respect to FIG. 1,<br>
each of the VBSs 34 control one or more clutches by regulating the hydraulic<br>
pressure supplied to the clutches by the control valves 30. A failed VBS can<br>
result in a clutch fault condition (e.g., clutch "stuck-on" or clutch "stuck-off").<br>
During a clutch stuck-on condition, the transmission 14 cannot disengage a<br>
clutch being used during the current or actual speed ratio. During a clutch stuck-<br>
off condition, the transmission 14 cannot select or engage a clutch needed to<br>
achieve a desired speed ratio. The diagnostic module 100 increments a stuck-on<br>
value or a stuck-off value associated with the failed VBS based on detecting a<br>
stuck-on condition or a stuck-off condition, respectively. The diagnostic module<br>
100 stores a distinct stuck-on threshold and stuck-off threshold for each of the<br>
VBSs 34 in a memory (not shown).<br>
[0029] The recovery module 150 communicates with diagnostic module<br>
100 and initiates a recovery cycle of the failed VBS 34 based on detecting a<br>
9<br><br>
respective stuck-on value or stuck-off value associated with the failed VBS 34.<br>
The recovery module 150 commands the failed VBS to periodically cycle<br>
between an active mode (ON) and an inactive mode (OFF) to regain operation<br>
of the failed VBS. In various embodiments, the recovery module 150 varies a<br>
hydraulic fluid pressure provided to the failed VBS. Additionally, the recovery<br>
module 150 can vary a frequency of the hydraulic fluid pressure to attempt to<br>
regain operation of the failed VBS.<br>
[0030] The recovery module 150 continues to periodically cycle the<br>
failed VBS until the vehicle 10 again requires the use of the failed VBS to<br>
establish a desired speed ratio. The diagnostic module 100 then determines<br>
whether the failed VBS is functioning properly based on the range selector<br>
position signal, the input shaft speed signal, and the output shaft speed signal. If<br>
the failed VBS continues to experience the fault condition, the diagnostic module<br>
increments the stuck-on value or the stuck-off value associated with the failed<br>
VBS.<br>
[0031] The diagnostic module 100 delays reporting a fault associated<br>
with the failed VBS until the stuck-on value or stuck-off value exceeds the<br>
respective stuck-on threshold or stuck-off threshold associated with the failed<br>
VBS. Each of the VBSs 34 possesses calibrated stuck-on and stuck-off<br>
thresholds due to a varying degree of use of various clutches by a driver or<br>
operator (not shown) of the vehicle 10 during a drive cycle. For example, a drive<br>
cycle of the vehicle 10 may execute a shift pattern requiring forward drive ratios<br>
1-6. As depicted in FIG. 2, the C1 corresponds to forward drive ratios 1-4 and<br>
10<br><br>
the C2 corresponds to forward drive ratios 2 and 6. A failed VBS that controls<br>
the operation of C1 would result in the transmission 14 having to establish the<br>
fifth forward drive cycle upon initiating the drive cycle during a stuck-off condition.<br>
However, a failed VBS that controls the operation of the C4 would require the<br>
shift pattern to transition from the first forward drive ratio to the third forward drive<br>
ratio during a stuck-on condition. Furthermore, the failed VBS corresponding to<br>
the C4 would force the transmission 14 to remain in the fifth forward drive ratio<br>
when the transmission 14 commanded a shift to the sixth forward drive ratio.<br>
[0032] Typically, a failed VBS corresponding to the C1 should impact<br>
the performance of the vehicle 10 to a greater extent relative to a failed VBS<br>
corresponding to the C4. Therefore, the stuck-off threshold for a VBS 34<br>
associated with the C1 may exceed the stuck-off threshold a VBS 34 associated<br>
with the C4. In other words, a failure of the C4 to engage is typically more<br>
tolerable to a driver of the vehicle 10 relative to a failure of the C1 in the present<br>
implementation. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that various stuck-on and<br>
stuck-off thresholds are contemplated. In the present implementation, the control<br>
module 32 activates a fault indicator (e.g., a light) informing the driver of the<br>
vehicle 10 of a fault condition when the stuck-on or stuck-off value exceeds the<br>
stuck-on or stuck-off threshold for one of the VBSs 34.<br>
[0033] Referring now to FIG. 4, a method 400 of operating the recovery<br>
control system will be discussed in more detail. Control begins the method in<br>
step 402. In step 404, the control determines whether the engine 12 is turned<br>
on. If the engine 12 is turned off, the method 400 returns to step 404. If the<br>
11<br><br>
engine 12 is turned on, control proceeds to step 406. In step 406, control<br>
determines whether a failed VBS of the VBSs 34 has been detected. If a failed<br>
VBS has not been detected, control proceeds to step 420. If a failed VBS has<br>
been detected, control proceeds to step 408.<br>
[0034] In step 408, control determines whether the clutch fault<br>
condition is a clutch stuck-on condition. If the clutch fault condition is not a clutch<br>
stuck-on condition, control proceeds to step 410. In step 410, control increments<br>
the clutch stuck-off value associated with the failed VBS. If the clutch fault<br>
condition is a clutch stuck-on condition in step 408, control increments the clutch<br>
stuck-on value associated with the failed VBS in step 412. In step 414, control<br>
initiates a periodic recovery cycle of the failed VBS.<br>
[0035] In step 416, control determines whether the clutch stuck-on<br>
value or the clutch stuck-off value has exceeded the stuck-on threshold or the<br>
stuck-off threshold associated with the failed VBS. If the stuck-on threshold or<br>
the stuck-off threshold has not been exceeded, control returns to step 406. If the<br>
stuck-on threshold or the stuck-off threshold has been exceeded, control<br>
proceeds to step 418. In step 418, control activates a fault indicator. In step<br>
420, the method 400 ends.<br>
[0036] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the present disclosure can be<br>
implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure has been<br>
described in connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the<br>
disclosure should not be so limited since other modifications will become<br>
12<br><br>

and a second threshold associated with said VBS and activating a fault indicator<br>
when one of said first count value and said second count value exceeds one of<br>
said first threshold and said second threshold, respectively.<br>
12.	The method of claim 11 further comprising continuing to execute<br>
said recovery cycle when said fault indicator is activated.<br>
16<br><br>
13.	A recovery control system for a variable bleed solenoid (VBS) for<br>
an automatic transmission, comprising:<br>
a recovery module that initiates a recovery cycle of said VBS when<br>
one of a first value and a second value that correspond to a clutch stuck-on<br>
condition or a clutch stuck-off condition, respectively, is detected; and<br>
a diagnostic module that activates a fault indicator when one of said<br>
first value and said second value exceeds one of a first threshold and a second<br>
threshold, respectively,<br>
wherein a clutch controlled by said VBS fails to disengage during<br>
said clutch stuck-on condition and said clutch fails to engage during said clutch<br>
stuck-on condition.<br>
14.	The system of claim 13 wherein said diagnostic module increments<br>
one of said first value and said second value associated with said VBS when said<br>
diagnostic module detects one of said stuck-on condition and said stuck-off<br>
condition, respectively.<br>
15.	The system of claim 13 wherein said recovery module initiates said<br>
recovery cycle when said diagnostic module increments one of said first value<br>
and said second value.<br>
17<br><br>
18<br>
16. The system of claim 13 wherein said recovery module continues to<br>
execute said recovery cycle when said diagnostic module activates said fault<br>
indicator.<br><br>
A recovery control system and method for automatic transmissions includes a<br>
diagnostic module that determines a fault condition of a variable bleed solenoid<br>
(VBS) when the automatic transmission fails to establish a desired drive ratio. A<br>
recovery module initiates a recovery cycle of the VBS based on the fault condition. The fault condition includes one of a clutch stuck-on condition and a clutch stuck-off condition. A clutch controlled by the VBS fails to disengage<br>
during the clutch stuck-on condition, and the clutch fails to engage during the clutch stuck-on condition.<br></td>
