(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br><br><br>
OXIDATION-STABLE GRANULATE CONTAINING UNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under<br>
the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office<br>
at 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br>
WO 2007/122053<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/052810<br><br>
 OXIDATION-STABLE GRANULATE CONTAINING UNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
5 The present invention relates to a water-dispersible granulate comprising 40-90 wt. % of carbohydrates, 2-30 wt.% of lipids and at least 3% of unsaturated fatty acids by weight of the granulate.<br>
10 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is well-known in the food industry that the application of oils containing high levels of unsaturated fatty acids can give rise to serious off-flavour problems. These off-flavour<br>
15 problems are associated with the oxidation of the unsaturated fatty acids, leading to the formation of volatile, potent flavour molecules, such as unsaturated aldehydes. Flavour attributes associated with oxidation products of unsaturated fatty acids include "cardboard", "paint", "oily", "rancid",<br>
20 "metallic" and "fish".<br>
Whilst all unsaturated fatty acids have been associated with the aforementioned stability problems, lipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids, notably lipids containing co-3 and/or co-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are known to be<br>
25 extremely susceptible to oxidation. Oxidation of the latter<br>
fatty acids yields volatile oxidation products that introduce a repugnant flavour to the product containing these fatty acid residues. Typical examples of co-3 PUFA include docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and α-linolenic acid<br>
30 (ALA) . Typical examples of co-6 fatty acid include linoleic acid (LA) , γ-linolenic acid (GLA) and arachidonic acid (AA) .<br><br>
WO 2007/122053<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/052810<br><br><br>
Although it is known that the rate of oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids may be reduced through the addition of anti¬oxidants, the application of such anti-oxidants at best delays the formation of unacceptable off-flavour. However, the shelf-5 life of products containing appreciable amounts of unsaturated fatty acids, especially food products and beverages, is inherently limited as a result of the inevitable oxidation of these fatty acid residues.<br>
10 Furthermore, in some product applications, e.g. in<br>
reconstitutable powders, it is extremely difficult to produce bland tasting products if these products contain a significant quantity of unsaturated fatty acids. The production of reconstitutable powders typically involves one or more<br>
15 processing steps at elevated temperatures (e.g. drying). The oxidation rate of unsaturated fatty acids, however, increases exponentially with incrementing temperature, especially if these fatty acids are exposed to elevated temperatures in the presence of air and/or pro-oxidants.<br>
20<br>
Many scientific publications have been issued that strongly suggest that regular consumption of significant amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids can deliver important health benefits. Furthermore, there is ample evidence showing that in<br>
25 general unsaturated fatty acids are more healthy than saturated fatty acids. Hence, efforts have been made by the industry to develop food products and nutritional preparations that contain appreciable amounts of unsaturated fatty acids, especially polyunsaturated fatty acids. It has also been attempted to<br>
30 incorporate (poly)unsaturated fatty acids in reconstitutable powders.<br><br>
WO 2007/J22053<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/052810<br><br><br>
US 2005/018019 describes the encapsulation of a polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as ω-3 and/or ω-6 PUFA, by spray drying an emulsion containing a carrier to form a powder, followed by encapsulation in a fluid bed dryer. Suitable carriers are said 5 to include modified food starches, maltodextrins, proteins,<br>
sugars and mixtures thereof. It is stated in the US application that it is anticipated that the spray dried and encapsulated oils will be less susceptible to oxidation and the off tastes which accompany oxidation will be reduced. Example 2 describes<br>
10 how 1 kg of water, 100 g milk protein, 50 g modified food<br>
starch, 50 g flow starch and 200 g oil are emulsified using a high pressure homogeniser, followed by spray drying. The spray dried powder is introduced in a fluid bed coater and sprayed under a nitrogen blanket with a mixture of carnauba wax and<br>
15 paraffin.<br>
US 2004/0201116 describes a process of producing oil containing pellets wherein the oil is protected against oxidation. Example 8 describes the preparation of pellets containing<br>
20 polyunsaturated oil by mixing 0.5 kg soybean-based cellulose with 2 kg maltodextrin and slowly dissolving the mixture in 12.5 kg demineralised water. Next, 7.5 kg of the same quality maltodextrin was added slowly together with 3 kg polyunsaturated oil with a high speed mixer to form 22.5 kg<br>
25 pre-emulsion which was homogenised with a two stage homogeniser at a pressure of 250 bar and 275 bar. The mixture was fed to a fluid bed direct pelletising pilot installation to produce pellets with a particle size of between 250-355 urn. Using the same ingredients and process also pellets of a particle size of<br>
30 between 800-1180 urn were prepared. All the pellets prepared had an oil content of more than 23%.<br><br>
WO 2007/122053<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/052810<br><br><br>
The aforementioned processes for producing unsaturated fatty acids containing powders suffer from a number of disadvantages. First of all, these processes are very elaborate, amongst others because they require the use of a substantial amount of 5 water to prepare a pre-emulsion, whereas the same water needs to be removed later to yield a powder. Furthermore, the processes described in the prior art employ a spray drying step which, as mentioned herein before, due to the elevated temperatures accelerates oxidation of the unsaturated fatty 10 acids. Finally, powders having a small particle size, such as those described in US 2005/0181019 suffer from the disadvantage that they are not readily water-dispersible.<br>
EP-A 0 893 953 describes solid carrier particles onto whose 15 outer surface has been coated or absorbed at least one<br>
polyunsaturated fatty acid in liquid form, the particles being suitable for consumption by humans, and dispersible or miscible in water. Example 5 describes the preparation of a PUFA containing powder by mixing 75% maltodextrin (Glucidex® 19) 20   with 25% fungal arachidonic oil (40%  ARA) in a high speed mixer (Grail® 300, Colette; 100 kg; mixing for 10 minutes, speed 1 for mixing arm and chopper). The maltodextrin Glucidex® 19 has a DE of 19 and a particle size well below 200 urn.<br>
25 Also in other areas, such as the flavour industry, efforts have been made to prepare oxidation-stable particulate compositions containing oxidation sensitive flavouring materials. US 5,506,353 describes the use of maltodextrin having a low DE in the preparation of a particulate flavour composition comprising<br>
30 a flavour oil (e.g. citrus oil). Example 3 describes the preparation of a particulate flavour composition comprising orange oil. The composition was prepared by centrifugal atomisation of an emulsion containing 43.61 wt. % water; 7.93<br><br>
WO 2007/122053<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/052810<br><br>
wt.% orange oil; 35.25 wt.% Hystar®; 9.25 wt^% Maltrin® M040 and 3.96 wt.% Capsul®. It is observed that the resuiting particulate flavour composition showed no oxidation after-having been stored at 60°C for 4 weeks. Maltrin® M040 is  5 maltodextrin having 5 DE. The average Particle size of the particulate composition appears to be well below 200 um<br>
There is compelling scientific evidence suggesting that iron deficiency during childhood hamper mental development. 10 Furthermore, it has been suggested that coqnitive capabilities may be impaired as a result of iron deficiency. Hence  it is desirable to supplement nutritional products with iron. From a nutritional perspective, also supplement action with iron.From a  desirable. Both iron and copper are well-known for their pro-15 oxidative properties. This is why product developers will<br>
always try to minimize iron and copper levels in foodstuffs and beverages that contain unsaturated lipids Hence, it is a major challenge to provide an oxidation-stable granulate comprising a substantial amount of unsaturated fatty ^i^s as well as a 20 significant amount of iron and/or copper<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
25 The inventors have succeeded in developing a readily water-dispersible granulate that contains a substantial amount of unsaturated fatty acids as well as a high level of iron and/or copper and which granulate is nonetheless very stable against oxidation. The granulate of  the present invention is easy to<br>
30 manufacture by a process that does not employ  emulsification or pro-oxidative conditions,<br><br>
WO 2007/122053<br><br>
PCTYEP2007/052810<br><br>
 The inventors have found that water-dispersible, highly oxidation-stable granulates comprising (i) 2-30 wt.% of lipids containing at least 3% of unsaturated fatty acids by weight of the granulate and (ii) at least 30 mg/kg of pro-oxidative metal 5 in the form of iron and/or copper can be produced without difficulty by:<br>
•	incorporating the lipids containing the unsaturated fatty<br>
acids as free or non-dispersed lipids;<br>
•	incorporating carbohydrates in an amount of 40-90% by weight<br>
10   of the granulate; and<br>
•	ensuring that the mass weighted average diameter of the<br>
granulate exceeds 100 um.<br>
The present granulate can be produced under very mild 15 conditions by simply absorbing the lipids onto granules containing the carbohydrates and the pro-oxidative metal. Unlike spray drying methods, this method does not yield a powder in which the lipids containing the unsaturated fatty acids are dispersed in a carbohydrate matrix that protects the 20 lipids from the surrounding atmosphere. In the present<br>
granulate, the lipids are present as free oil, rendering it truly surprising that the granulate exhibits exceptional oxidation stability in the presence of pro-oxidative metal.<br>
25 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus, one aspect of the invention relates to a water-dispersible granulate having a mass weighted average diameter of at least 100 um, preferably of at least 200 urn, said granulate comprising:<br>
30 • 40-90 wt.% of carbohydrates;<br>
•	2-30 wt.% of lipids containing at least 1% unsaturated fatty<br><br>
WO 2007/122053<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/052810<br><br><br>
acids by weight of the granulate and<br>
• at least 30 mg/kg of a pro-oxidative metal selected from the group consisting of iron, copper and combinations thereof; wherein at least 50wt.%, preferably at least 70wt.% of the 5   lipids is present as non-dispersed lipids.<br>
The terms "mean diameter" and "average diameter" whenever used herein, refer to the mass-weighted average diameter. The mass-weighted average diameter of a granulate is suitably determined 10 with the help of sieves.<br>
The term "lipid" as used herein encompasses fatty acid containing lipids selected from the group consisting of triglycerides, diglycerides, monoglycerides, phospholipids,<br>
15 free fatty acids and combinations thereof. Most preferably, the lipids of the present invention are selected from the group consisting of triglycerides, diglycerides and combinations thereof. Most preferably, the lipids are triglycerides. The term "oil" as used herein encompasses both lipids that are<br>
20 liquid or solid at e.g. 20°C. Preferably, the lipids have a melting point of less than 40°C, more preferably of less than 30°C, even more preferably of less than 20°C and most preferably of less than 10°C.<br>
25 The term "fatty acid" as used herein encompasses free fatty acids as well as fatty acid residues. Thus, the unsaturated fatty acids of the present invention may be contained in the granulate in the form of fatty acids residues of e.g. triglycerides and/or as free fatty acids.<br>
30<br>
The term "water dispersible" as used herein means that a granulate passes the following test: A sample of 20 g is added<br><br>
WO 2007/122053<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/052810<br><br><br>
to a glass beaker (diameter=6 cm) containing 140 ml of water having a temperature of 75 °C. The mixture is stirred with a magnetic stirrer at a speed that produces a  vortex in the liquid with a depth of 2 mm. Immediately thereafter, the 5 stirred mixture is poured over a 250 um sieve (diameter=10 cm) After 1 minute, the sieve is dried in an oven at 110 °C for 2 hours and weighted. If the observed weight increase of the sieve is less than 1 g, the granulate is water-dispersible. If not, the granulate is not water-dispersible. According to a 10 particularly preferred embodiment, the granulate is cold water dispersible, meaning that the powder is dispersible under the aforementioned test conditions, employing water with a temperature of 10°C.<br>
15 An important advantage of the present granulate resides in the fact that it can be produced without the preparation of a pre-emulsion in which the lipids are dispersed in a continuous (aqueous) phase containing one or more hydrocolloids. The use of such a pre-emulsion ensures that during drying, the<br>
20 dispersed lipids become encased as a dispersed phase in a matrix that is made up of the one or more hydrocolloids. In contrast, in the present granulate, the lipids are suitably absorbed onto pre-formed particles containing the carbohydrates and the pro-oxidative metal. Thus, in the granulate of the<br>
25 present invention, a substantial amount of the lipids is present as non-dispersed oil. Preferably, at least 80 wt.%, most preferably, at least 90 wt.% of the lipids is present as non-dispersed oil. The amount of lipids that is present as non-dispersed oil can suitably be determined by measuring the<br>
30 amount of "free fat", using the methodology described by Vega et al., J- Food Sci. (2005), 30:144-251.<br><br>
WO 2007/122053<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/052810<br><br><br>
The granulates made from pre-emulsions typically contain droplets of dispersed oil that have a small average diameter that is typically within the range of 0.1-10 urn. In contrast, in the present granulate preferably less than 30 wt.%, more 5 preferably less than 10 wt.% and most preferably less than 5 wt.% of the lipids is present as dispersed oil droplets with a diameter of less than 5 urn, especially of less than 10 urn.<br>
The benefits of the present invention are particularly 10 pronounced in case the granulates contains at least 3 wt.% of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), especially polyunsaturated acids selected from the group consisting of co-3 fatty acids, co-6 fatty acids and combinations thereof.<br>
15 The granulates of the present invention are very stable against oxidation, even if these granulates contain substantial levels of the pro-oxidant metal. According to a particularly preferred embodiment, the granulate contains at least 60 mg/kg, more preferably at least 120 mg/kg and most preferably at least 200<br>
20 mg/kg of the pro-oxidative metal. Usually, the content of the pro-oxidative metal does not exceed 800 mg/kg. According to a particularly preferred embodiment, the pro-oxidative metal is iron. The benefits of the present invention are particularly pronounced in case the iron is present as ferrous and/or ferric<br>
25 iron. Most preferably, the iron is present as ferrous iron.<br>
Iron is suitably incorporated in the present granulates in the form of a water-soluble or water-insoluble salt. Examples of iron salt that may advantageously be incorporated in the 30 granulate include: iron fumarate, iron sulphate, iron EDTA, haeme iron, iron phosphate, iron pyrophosphate and iron citrate. According to a preferred embodiment, iron is incorporated as in the form of one or more iron salts selected<br><br>
WO 2007/122053<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/052810<br><br><br>
from the group consisting of iron fumarate, iron sulphate, iron EDTA and haeme iron. The latter iron salts offer the advantage that they exhibit good bioavailability. Most preferably, the iron is incorporated in the form of iron fumarate. 5<br>
The inventors have discovered that the granulates exhibiting particularly good oxidative stability can be prepared by incorporating 20-55 wt.% of maltodextrin, preferably with a DE value comprised between 2 and 20.<br>
10<br>
According to a particularly preferred embodiment, the present granulate comprises at least 4  wt.%, more preferably 6-25 wt.%, must preferably 9-20 wt.% of lipids,   Surprisingly,    it   was found that the present granulate retains both Excellent flowability<br>
15 and oxidation stability even if it contains up to 20 wt.% lipids.<br>
The PUFA present in granulate of the invention are advantageously contained as fatty acids residues in the lipids.<br>
20 Typically, the lipids contain at least 20 wt.%, preferably at least 30 wt.% and most preferably at least 50 wt.% of unsaturated fatty acid residues, said percentages being calculated on the total amount of fatty acid residues contained in the lipids. Preferably, said unsaturated fatty acids are<br>
25 polyunsaturated fatty acids, most preferably polyunsaturated fatty acids selected from the group consisting of co-3 fatty acids, co-6 fatty acids and combinations thereof.<br>
Suitable sources of co-3 fatty acids and ω-6 fatty acids include 30 fish oil, algae oil, linseed oil, rapeseed oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil and corn oil, fish oil, algae oil, linseed oil and rapeseed oil being particularly preferred. The benefits of<br><br>
WO 2007/122053<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/052820<br><br><br>
the present invention are particularly apparent if the granulate contains at least 0.2 wt.%, preferably at least 0.4 wt.% of a triglyceride oil selected from the group consisting of fish oil, algae oil, linseed oil and combinations thereof. 5<br>
Polyunsaturated acids that are particularly sensitive to oxidation and that produce particularly repugnant oxidation products include linoleic acid, a-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic<br>
10 acid. Hence, according to a particularly preferred embodiment, the present granulate comprises at least 0.1 wt.%, preferably at least 0.5 wt.%, more preferably at least 1 wt.% and most preferably at least 3  wt.%  of  polyunsaturated acids selected from the group consisting of linoleic acid, a-linolenic acid,<br>
15 eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, arachidonic acid and combinations thereof.<br>
Besides maltodextrin and the lipids, the present granulate may suitably contain other components, especially hydrophilic<br>
20 components such as carbohydrates, protein, salts and acids. Typically, the present granulate contains at least 50 wt.%, more preferably at least 70 wt.% of carbohydrates. Here the term carbohydrates encompasses any material that predominantly, preferably exclusively consists of monosaccharides and/or<br>
25 polymers of such monosaccharide units. Examples of<br>
carbohydrates include monosaccharides (e.g. glucose, fructose), disaccharides (e.g. sucrose), trisaccharides (e.g. maltriose), oligosaccharides (e.g. high DE maltodextrin) and polysaccharides (e.g starch and low DE maltodextrin).<br>
30<br>
According to a very preferred embodiment, the granulate comprises between 20 and 65 wt.%, preferably between 25 and 55<br><br>
WO 2007/122053<br><br>
PCT7EP2007/052810<br><br><br>
wt.% of a saccharide selected from the group consisting of monosaccharides, disaccharides and combinations thereof.<br>
The mean particle diameter of the present granulate usually 5 does not exceed 2000 urn. Water dispersibility of the present granulate is believed to be optimal if the granulate has a mean particle diameter of more than 400 um and not more than 1500 urn. Most preferably, the mean particle diameter is within the range of 600-1200 urn.<br>
10<br>
In order to be able to absorb a significant quantity of lipids, the non-lipid matrix of the present granulate needs to be porous. Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment, the present granulate has a bulk density within the range of 300-600 g/1,<br>
15 more preferably within the range of 350-450 g/1.<br>
The present granulate, besides unsaturated fatty acids advantageously contains a number of nutritionally desirable ingredients such as minerals, vitamins, flavonoids,<br>
20 carotenoids, etc. In an advantageous embodiment, the granulate comprises between 1 and 20 g/kg, preferably between 2 and 10 g/kg of vitamin C. Also oxidation of vitamin C can be prevented very effectively by incorporating vitamin C in the present granulate.<br>
25<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the granulate comprises between 10 and 100 mg/kg, preferably between 30 and 80 mg/kg of vitamin E. The inclusion of vitamin E offers the advantage that it provides the PUFA with additional protection against<br>
30 oxidation.<br>
The moisture content of the present granulate typically is less than 8 wt.%, preferably less than 5 wt.% moisture. The water<br><br>
WO 2007/122053<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/052810<br><br><br>
activity (aw) of the granulate is preferably between 0.1 and 0.4,   more preferably between 0.15 and O.3.<br>
Another aspect of the invention relates to a process of 5 preparing a granulate according to any One of the preceding claims, said process comprising the steps of:<br>
• preparing core particles containing the carbohydrates and the pro-oxidative metal, said core particles having a mass-weighted average diameter of at least 100 um; 10 • spraying the core particles with lipids containing the unsaturated fatty acids and allowing the lipids to be absorbed by the core particles; and • recovering the granulate.<br>
15 In accordance with a particularly preferred embodiment, the core particles are prepared by agglomerating a powder comprising the carbohydrates and the pro-oxidative metal and optionally other powder ingredients, by Spraying the powder with an aqueous liquid. In an even more Preferred embodiment,<br>
20 the powder is sprayed with an aqueous solution of a saccharide selected from the group consisting of monosaccharides, disaccharides and combinations thereof, followed by drying to obtain the agglomerated powder. The aquecous solution typically contains 5-35 wt.%, preferably 10-30 wt.%  of saccharide.<br>
25<br>
In the present process the core particles are advantageously prepared by creating a fluid bed of the Powder to be agglomerated and by spraying it with a liquid to achieve agglomeration. This advantageous embodiment of the invention<br>
30 may suitably be operated in a fluid bed agglomerating device.<br><br>

PCT/EP2007/052810<br><br><br>
As explained herein before, the core particles should have a certain level of porosity in order to enable the absorption of a substantial amount of lipids. Preferably, the bulk density of the core particles employed in the present method is within the 5 range of 250-500 g/1, more preferably of 300-450 g/1.<br>
A major advantage of the present invention lies in the fact that it can be operated under mild conditions, especially at the stage when the lipids are sprayed onto the core particles. 10 Typically, the core particles are sprayed with the lipids at a temperature below 50°C, preferably below 40°C, most preferably at a temperature below 35°C.<br>
As mentioned herein before, iron deficiency during childhood 15 can hamper mental development and cognitive capabilities may be impaired as a result of such iron deficiency. Also polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially ω-3 fatty acids are believed to play an important role in mental development and cognitive function. The granulates according to the present 20 invention are a particularly useful vehicle for delivering a combination of nutritional components that can be used in the treatment of prevention of retarded mental development or diminished cognitive function. Accordingly, another aspect of the invention relates to the use of the granulates of the 25 present invention in the preparation of a composition for the treatment or prevention of retarded mental development or diminished cognitive function.<br>
The invention is further illustrated by means of the following 30 examples.<br><br>

 Part of the granulate was packaged under vacuum in sachets (21 g per sachet), which sachets were sealed by an inner layer of aluminium and PP with a thickness 9 u.m. Another part of the granulate was  packaged  in sachets (21  g per sachet) made of 5 BOPP (biaxially oriented polypropylene) film. The aluminum<br>
sachets were stored for 3 months at 40°C and a relative humidity of 90%. The BOPP sachets were stored for 1 month under the same conditions. After these storage periods, the granules were dissolved into 140 ml of cold milk and the resulting<br>
10 beverages were tasted by an expert panel. The panel members concluded that the quality of the beverages was acceptable. More particularly, they found that the beverages did not contain objectionable off-flavours resulting from oil oxidation.<br>
