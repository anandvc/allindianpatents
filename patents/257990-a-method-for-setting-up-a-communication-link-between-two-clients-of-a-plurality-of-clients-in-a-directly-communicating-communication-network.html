FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method for setting up a<br>
communication link between two clients of a plurality of<br>
clients in a directly-communicating communication network as<br>
claimed in the precharacterizing clause of patent claim 1.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Communication networks whose components communicate with one<br>
another by packet switching are being used increasingly instead<br>
of line-switching communication networks. Networks such as<br>
these are frequently also referred to as Voice-Over-IP (VoIP)<br>
networks, when the Internet Protocol (IP) is used to<br>
interchange acoustic information (speech data) in the form of<br>
data. In this case, the networks may either be used exclusively<br>
for transmission of speech data or else can transmit both<br>
speech data and other information (for example data, video) as<br>
well in a mixed form.<br><br><br>
In line-switching communication networks, terminals (for<br>
example telephones, fax machines) are always connected to a<br>
communication node (for example to a telephone system). The<br>
entire information flow to and from the terminals in this case<br>
takes place with the involvement of the respective<br>
communication node, with control information, for example for<br>
setting up links, being interchanged between the terminal and<br>
the communication node, while the payload information (the<br>
analog speech signal of the modulated fax signal) is admittedly<br>
interchanged between the terminals that are involved in the<br>
communication link but is passed on (transmitted) by at least<br>
one communication node that is involved in the communication<br>
link.<br>
In speech data networks, the terminals are frequently referred<br><br>
to as "clients", because the terminals in these communication<br>
networks are operated in a similar manner to a computer in a<br>
data network and not only as a telephone or fax machine, but<br>
may also, for example be in the form of a multimedia PC. A<br>
multimedia PC is a computer which has suitable hardware for<br>
inputting information (for example a microphone, camera,<br>
keyboard, scanner etc.) and for outputting information (for<br>
example, a screen/display, loudspeakers, LEDs etc.). Clients<br>
may also be in the form of a miniature PC (so-called PDA -<br>
Personal Digital Assistant) or an extended mobile telephone<br>
(smart phone). The appliances mentioned are often equipped with<br>
a cordless data link and, in the case of mobile telephones are<br>
then also referred to as "WLAN cellphones" (WLAN = Wireless<br>
Local Area Network).<br>
The clients in speech data networks generally interchange the<br>
payload information directly with one another. For this<br>
purpose, once a communication link has been set up, two clients<br>
communicating with one another each interchange the data<br>
packets with the payload information with the knowledge of the<br>
network address of their communication partner, and on the<br>
basis of these network addresses. In order to set up a link, by<br>
contrast, central network nodes (communication nodes) are also<br>
used in the known speech data networks. Network nodes such as<br>
these are known to the speech data networks which use H.323<br>
protocol (ITU-T-H.323) as "gatekeeper" and to the speech data<br>
networks which use the SIP protocol (IETF-SIP; SIP = Session<br>
Initiation Protocol), as SIP proxy servers.<br>
Widespread data networks, in particular, the Internet, are<br>
increasingly using communication structures which are referred<br>
to as "peer-to-peer" networks or else "end-to-end" networks.<br>
One primary field of application for communication structures<br>
such as these is to interchange files, so-called "file<br>
sharing". In this case, a subscriber (client) to a<br>
communication structure such as this checks a number of other<br><br>
clients (typically computers) when looking for a specific<br>
resource (which may be a music file or a computer program) , and<br>
starts to use this resource once it has been found, which<br>
generally involves the transmission ("download") of one or more<br>
files. In this case, either appropriate communication partners<br>
(clients) are found using a database, or else the clients can<br>
be found by appropriate communication methods without any<br>
central instance.<br>
Some of the known "peer-to-peer" networks are used for the<br>
purpose of direct communication. The "media data" that is<br>
interchanged in this case, that is to say the payload data, is<br>
not restricted to speech (speech data) or modulated information<br>
(for example fax transmissions), but also includes moving image<br>
information (video transmission, video conferences, "multimedia<br>
messaging") and other forms of electronic communication. In<br>
communication networks such as these, which are also referred<br>
to as "directly-communicating communication networks", this<br>
means on the one hand that communication links can be set up in<br>
the form of conventional "telephone calls", while on the other<br>
hand it is also possible to transmit extended contents<br>
("multimedia"). Avoiding the use of central network nodes<br>
(communication nodes) in this case results in the advantage of<br>
increased resistance to failures, although it is associated<br>
with the disadvantage that the (switching) functionality of the<br>
network nodes, as is known from line-switching telephony must<br>
be provided by the clients involved in the communication link,<br>
themselves.<br>
The document US 2003/0095546 Al Sakano et al. "IP Telephone<br>
terminal searching for destination with a telephone number to<br>
set up a call connection over an IP network" has already<br>
disclosed a directly communicating communication network in<br>
which clients set up direct communication links with one<br>
another using addresses (IP addresses). In this case it is<br>
proposed to send a search message with a call number to<br><br><br>
adjacent clients, whereby, in cases in which a client who<br>
receives the search message is allocated this call number, this<br>
client makes his IP address available to the first, searching<br>
client in order to initiate a communication link on the basis<br>
of the Internet protocol.<br>
In the case of the known directly-communicating communication<br>
networks, it has been found to be particularly disadvantageous<br>
when a client must have the address information (for example<br>
the network address) of a second client in order to set up a<br>
communication link to that second client. This is a problem<br>
because, in general, there is no network node (for example<br>
communication server) directly associated with the client, with<br>
which it is possible to check an address such as this. Even if<br>
the address information for the desired communication partner<br>
is	known,	it	is	possible	in	directly-communicating<br>
communication networks that it is not possible to reach this<br>
desired communication partner (for example if it is "busy" or<br><br>
if the client has failed) so that, for example it is desirable<br>
to set up a link to an alternative call destination<br>
("alternative	destination").	Since	directly-communicating<br>
communication networks do not use central network nodes for<br>
storage of address information such as this, the problem of<br>
addressing still exists when setting up a connection to an<br>
alternative	call	destination	such	as	this.<br>
One object of the invention is to propose a method	by means of<br>
which the address information which is	required for<br>
communication links in directly-communicating	communication<br>
networks can be determined.<br>
The object is achieved by the features of the invention, in that the following<br>
method steps are carried out successively: first of all (step a) client<br>
address information which is required to set up a communication<br>
link between the clients in pairs is stored for at least one<br><br>
destination client in a first client. Then (step b), the stored<br>
client address information for the destination client is<br>
transmitted from the first client to a calling client, and then<br>
(step c) the calling client uses this client address<br>
information to set up the communication link between the<br>
calling client and the destination client. When the<br>
abovementioned method steps are carried out, this results in a<br>
calling client in the directly-communicating communication<br>
network having transmitted to it the address of the destination<br>
client that is required to set up a communication link, with<br>
the link being set up without any access to a central<br>
communication node or to a central address database. The fact<br>
that call forwarding has been carried out can remain concealed<br>
for the calling client if the destination client forms the call<br>
forward destination for the first client in step a) , and when a<br>
call arrives from the calling client, the first client sends<br>
signaling information for call signaling of a further call to<br>
the destination client in step b), in which case on acceptance<br>
of the further call at the destination client, the latter<br>
transmits a call acceptance signaling message to the first<br>
client, on the basis of which the first client transmits the<br>
client address information for the destination client to the<br>
calling client. In this case the call forwarding is carried out<br>
not only when the first client is busy but also in the case of<br>
a call which is not accepted by the first client, in that the<br>
signaling information for call signaling of the further call is<br>
transmitted to the destination client if the call is not<br>
answered at the first client within a waiting time. This<br>
waiting time can advantageously be set or changed by a user at<br>
the first client, by means of an input. The feature of "call<br>
forwarding" can advantageously be made use of for this purpose<br>
in the event of an unsuccessful call to a free subscriber<br>
(client) in that the details about waiting time are stored in<br>
the first client in step a) , and a call is signaled to the<br>
first client in step b), on the basis of the received signaling<br>
information, and the stored client address information is<br><br><br>
transmitted to the calling client only if the call to the first client is not answered<br>
within the waiting time.<br>
The method allows features to be provided in a directly-communicating<br>
communication network without the inclusion of a central switching instance, in<br>
which case, as a further advantage, the lack of a central communication node or<br>
of a central subscriber directory results in a high degree of operational reliability<br>
and availability in the communication network because, in the event of a failure<br>
of one communication component (dient) only a relatively small portion of the<br>
communication network is affected. Furthermore, communication networks which<br>
use the method according to the invention can be extended more easily and can<br>
be scaled better.<br>
Call forwarding can be set up and carried out in a simple manner and in that in<br>
order to forward a call, the destination client forms the call forward destination<br>
for the first client in step a), and the calling client sends signaling information for<br>
call signaling to the first client between steps a) and b), in order to set up a<br>
communication link.<br>
In the case of call-forwarding, a user at the first claim can enter various call-<br>
forwarding destinations, with a suitable one of the call forwarding destinations<br>
being selected depending on the nature (service) of the call arriving at tiie first<br>
client or of the communication link that is intended with the call. This is achieved<br>
in that the client address information for a plurality of destination clients is stored<br>
in the first client in step a), and is in each case associated with one or more<br>
different services, and when call arrives at the first<br><br>
client, the signaling information in step b) defines the<br>
service which is intended to be supported by the communication<br>
link to be set up, with the client address information for that<br>
destination client which is associated with this service being<br>
selected and transmitted on the basis of this definition. In<br>
this case, the services are advantageously selected from a<br>
group which comprises at least speech services, video services<br>
and data services.<br>
The method according to the invention allows a call to be<br>
signaled to a plurality of clients at the same time and to be<br>
answered at any desired one of these clients in that the<br>
destination client is provided as the follow-me destination in<br>
step a), the calling client sends signaling information for<br>
call signaling to the first client between steps a) and b) in<br>
order to set up a communication link, and the call signaling<br>
takes place both at the first client and at the destination<br>
client in step c) in that the calling client sends further<br>
signaling information for call signaling to the destination<br>
client with the communication link being set up between the<br>
calling client and the destination client when the call is<br>
accepted at the destination client.<br>
In the case of follow-me, it is possible to avoid a situation<br>
in which the calling client sends signaling information to a<br>
plurality of clients, in that, in this case as well, the<br>
destination client is provided as the follow-me destination in<br>
step a) , between steps a) and b), the calling client sends<br>
signaling information for call signaling to the first client in<br>
order to set up a communication link, and the call signaling<br>
takes place both at first client and at the destination client,<br>
in that the first client sends further signaling information<br>
for call signaling of a further call to the destination client,<br>
with the destination client sending a call acceptance message<br>
to the first client after acceptance of this call, and the<br>
first client also transmitting the call reception message with<br><br>
the client address information of the destination client to the<br>
calling client in step b).<br>
The method allows the feature of "callback" to be provided in a<br>
simple manner in a directly-communicating communication<br>
network, in that in order to prepare for a callback, in<br>
situations in which an incoming call from the destination<br>
client to the first client is not accepted in step a) , the<br>
destination client stores the client address information<br>
together with the callback information in the first client, and<br>
in order to carry out the callback in step b) the first client,<br>
as the calling client, requests the destination client to carry<br>
out the callback. In this case, the callback when the client is<br>
busy is requested in that step a) is carried out when the first<br>
client is in the busy state and, the callback is made when the<br>
busy state of the first client no longer exists. In contrast to<br>
this, a callback can also be requested in the case of a client<br>
which is not busy and to which a call has been signaled unsuc-<br>
cessfully in that step a) is carried out when the incoming call<br>
has not been accepted at the first client within a waiting<br>
time, and the callback is completed when an event which<br>
reflects the presence of a user is detected at the first<br>
client. An event such as this advantageously does not need to<br>
be an explicit reaction by a user to a callback request, so<br>
that the callback is initialized with as short a time delay as<br>
possible, for example when a person returns to his desk.<br>
Various non-central message stores (speech boxes, video stores,<br>
e-mail system, etc.) can be used in directly-communicating<br>
communication networks in that in order to record and to call a<br>
message which is intended for the first client,<br>
before step a), a second client sets up a communication link to<br>
the destination client with the message being stored in the<br>
destination client, after step a) the presence of the stored<br>
message is signaled to the first client, in step b) in turn,<br>
the calling client is formed by the first client, and in step<br><br>
c) the stored message is called up at the destination client<br>
using the communication link. In this case, various services<br>
can be used in the communication network, in which case a<br>
plurality of recording clients for storage of messages are<br>
available in the communication network, and, before step a) the<br>
second client selects a suitable one of the recording clients<br>
as the destination client. In this case, in each case at least<br>
one type of recordable message is advantageously associated<br>
with the recording client in which case, in step a) in each<br>
case one recording client is selected which is appropriate for<br>
the type of message to be recorded.<br>
In the event of a brief interruption in an existing<br>
communication link, for example for questions, it is<br>
advantageous for a subscriber (client) who is waiting during<br>
the interruption to be supplied with information (for example<br>
waiting music, product information, etc.). This can be achieved<br>
in that a first communication link exists between the first<br>
client and the second client in step a) , with the client<br>
address information for the destination client being<br>
transmitted by the second client to the first client, the first<br>
client forms the calling client in step b), and the first<br>
communication link is cleared after step b), and after step c),<br>
the communication link which was set up in step c) between the<br>
calling client and the destination client is cleared, and the<br>
first communication link is set up again. In this case, the<br>
destination client is advantageously used as the information<br>
source for waiting times.<br>
Before the interruption of the first communication link, a user<br>
of the second client can decide which contents and which type<br>
of media (speech, images, text information, etc.) should be<br>
output to the first client during the waiting time. This is<br>
achieved in that a plurality of clients can be used as the<br>
destination client in the communication network, with one of<br>
the usable clients being selected as the destination client by<br><br>
the second client in step a) . In this case, the destination<br>
client can advantageously be in the form of an instance on the<br>
same hardware, which forms the basis for the first or for the<br>
second client.<br>
In a directly-communicating communication network,<br>
announcements can be emitted to clients in a simple manner, in<br>
which case a client who is receiving the announcement can be<br>
activated automatically without a user having to do anything in<br>
that in step c) the calling client, when setting up the<br>
communication link, transmits call signaling information along<br>
with a control command to the destination client so that the<br>
call is automatically accepted by the destination client.<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the method according to the invention<br>
will be explained in the following text with reference to the<br>
drawings, in which:<br>
Figures 1a, 1b show the interchange of signaling information<br>
between clients in a directly-communicating<br>
communication network, for the purpose of call<br>
forwarding when free,<br>
Figures 1c, 1d show the interchange of signaling information<br>
for call forwarding when busy,<br>
Figure 2a shows an arrangement of clients in a directly-<br>
communicating communication network for<br>
provision of follow-me in a first variant,<br>
Figure 2b shows the interchange of signaling information<br>
for the implementation of follow-me in a second<br>
variant,<br>
Figure 3a shows the initiation of a callback for a busy<br>
client,<br><br>
Figure 3b shows the interchange of signaling information<br>
for initiation and for carrying out a callback<br>
for a busy client,<br>
Figure 3c shows the signaling of a call for a free (not<br>
busy) client,<br>
Figure 3d shows the signaling information for the<br>
initiation and for carrying out a callback for a<br>
free client,<br>
Figure 4a shows the storage of a message for a client and<br>
the signaling of a stored message for this<br>
client,<br>
Figure 4b shows the calling up of the stored message by<br>
the notified client, and<br>
Figure 5 shows the supply of a client with waiting<br>
information while a communication link is on<br>
hold.<br>
Figure la shows a schematic illustration of clients A, B, C who<br>
are arranged in a directly-communicating communication network<br>
(not illustrated) . The clients A, B, C in this and in the<br>
following exemplary embodiments are in the form of multimedia<br>
PCs which set up communication links with one another in a<br>
packet-switching communication network (IP network; IP =<br>
Internet Protocol) by interchanging signaling information<br>
(control messages) with one another. These control messages are<br>
represented as arrows in the figures with the direction of the<br>
arrow in each case indicating the direction of the information<br>
flow of the respective control message. In this case, a multiple<br>
data interchange can take place between the clients interchanging<br>
the control message in order to interchange said control message,<br><br>
for example in order to acknowledge reception of the control<br>
message in a so-called "handshake process". In the case of the<br>
communication links between the clients as illustrated<br>
schematically in the figures, there is in each case a logic<br>
relationship between two clients, with data packets with payload<br>
information being transmitted between the clients on the basis of<br>
previously interchanged client address information. The payload<br>
information may optionally be speech information (speech data) or<br>
other contents (for example, video information, text<br>
information), and mixed forms of the various types of information<br>
(these are also referred to as "services") are possible.<br>
The clients, control messages and communication links which are<br>
known from Figure la and from the following figures are also<br>
used repeatedly in other figures with the same reference<br>
symbols. These are then clients, control messages and<br>
communication links with essentially the same functions, and<br>
are therefore not described again in the description of the<br>
further figures.<br>
Instead of the multimedia PCs that were used as clients in the<br>
figures, it is also possible to use any other desired<br>
components intended for communication, for example telephony<br>
terminals (IP telephones, VoIP telephones; VoIP = Voice-over<br>
Internet Protocol), fax machines, etc. The significant factor<br>
for the clients described here is that they are designed for<br>
operation in directly-communicating communication networks,<br>
that is to say their function and interaction with other<br>
clients and devices in a communication network take place<br>
without the use of a central instance, for example a<br>
communication node or a central server. This principle is still<br>
applicable when the functionality of a client is not sufficient<br>
to carry out a specific task, and this client therefore<br>
appoints a proxy to carry out the functionality that it is<br>
missing.<br><br>
The implementation of the feature "call forwarding" with the<br>
aid of the method according to the invention will be described<br>
in the following text with reference to Figures 1a, 1b, 1c and<br>
1d, with Figures la and lb showing call forwarding in the case<br>
of a call to a free subscribe and Figures 1c and 1d showing<br>
call forwarding in the case of a call to a busy subscriber.<br>
In Figure la, a user of the client B as the first client has<br>
determined with an input that all calls which reach his<br>
terminal (client B) will be forwarded to the client C as the<br>
destination client after a waiting time TO1 (TO = Time Out) of<br>
20 seconds if the call is not accepted at the client B within<br>
this waiting time TOl. Let us assume that a communication link<br>
is intended to be set up to a client B from the client A as the<br>
calling client. For this purpose, the client A sends a call<br>
signaling message RSI to the client B, which initiates call<br>
signaling (the client B "rings") at the client B. At the same<br>
time the client B sends an acknowledgment message AL1<br>
("alerting") to client A as acknowledgment. The call is not<br>
accepted at the client B, so that the waiting time TOl times<br>
out.<br>
The client B now sends a call redirect message RD1 (RD =<br>
Redirect) to the client A, which instructs the client A now to<br>
signal the call which was signaled to the client B to the<br>
client C as the destination client. The call redirect message<br>
RD1 in this case comprises the client address information for<br>
the client C, which has been entered by the user during his<br>
definition of the client C as the call forwarding destination.<br>
The signaling of the call to the client B is now stopped, and<br>
the client A, as the calling client, sends further call<br>
signaling information RS2 to the client C, after whose<br>
reception the client C starts to signal the call, and in<br>
response to which the client C sends an acknowledgment message<br>
AL2 ("alerting") to the client A for acknowledgment. Once the<br>
call has been accepted at the client C, the client C sends a<br><br>
call acceptance signaling message CN1 ("connect"), to the<br>
client A in response to which the communication link Kl<br>
(payload data link) is established between the client A and the<br>
client C.<br>
As a further example of call forwarding when free, Figure lb<br>
once again shows the waiting time TO1 being carried out in the<br>
client B as the first client by a user, and the client address<br>
information for the client C being defined as the call<br>
forwarding destination (destination client) for calls to the<br>
client B which are not accepted. In this case as well, a call<br>
from the client A to the client B takes place with the aid of<br>
the call signaling message RS1, with this call once again being<br>
acknowledged by the acknowledgment message AL1, and with the<br>
waiting time TOl also passing in this case without the call<br>
having been accepted at the client B. In contrast to the<br>
process described with reference to Figure la, the client B now<br>
ceases to signal the call and now uses a further call signaling<br>
message RS3 to the client C which, in addition to the command<br>
to signal a call to the client C, also includes the additional<br>
information that this call is a forwarded call from the client<br>
A. The call is now signaled to the client C, and an<br>
acknowledgment message AL3 is sent to the client B. Whilst the<br>
client C has accepted the call, the client C sends a call<br>
acceptance message CN3 to the client B in response to which the<br>
client B sends a further call acceptance message CN4 to the<br>
client A as the calling client, including the information that<br>
the call being signaled on the basis of the call signaling<br>
message RS1 has been forwarded to the client C, where it has<br>
been accepted. This call acceptance message CN4 also includes<br>
the client address information for the destination client,<br>
client C, so that the communication link K1 is now set up<br>
between the client A and the client C.<br>
Figure 1c shows call forwarding when busy, in a first variant.<br>
At the client B as the first client, a user defines the client<br><br>
C as the destination client for call forwarding when busy. In<br>
this case, the client address information for the destination<br>
client C is also stored in the client B. The client A now sends<br>
call signaling messages RS1 to the client B which, however, is<br>
already busy with a further communication link, which is not<br>
illustrated here. On the basis of the stored information, the<br>
client B now sends a call redirect message RD2 (for call<br>
forwarding) to the client A, including the designation and the<br>
client address information for the client C as the destination<br>
client, and also including the information that the client B is<br>
busy and that this call will thus be forwarded to the client C.<br>
As the calling client, the client A now sends further call<br>
signaling information RS2 to the client C, by which means the<br>
call is signaled to the client C, and the acknowledgment<br>
message AL2 is sent to the client A. After acceptance of the<br>
call at the client C, the client C sends out call acceptance<br>
message CN1 to the client A, after whose reception the<br>
communication link K1 is set up between the client A and the<br>
client C.<br>
Figure 1d also shows the signaling messages which are<br>
interchanged between the clients A, B, C in order to carry out<br>
call forwarding when busy. In this variant as well, the name<br>
and the client address information for the client C as the<br>
destination client for call forwarding when busy are stored in<br>
the client B as the first client. Client A now once again sends<br>
call signaling messages RS1 to the client B, with the client B<br>
also being busy in this case and not itself signaling the call.<br>
The client B now sends further call signaling messages RS4 to<br>
the client C, from which call signaling message it is evident<br>
that the call is the call which originated from the client A.<br>
In this case, the client address information for the client A,<br>
which is transmitted with the call signaling message RS1 to the<br>
client B, is also passed to the client C. The call is now<br>
signaled to the client C with this fact being signaled by means<br>
of the acknowledgment message AL4 from the client C to the<br><br>
client B. After reception of the acknowledgment message AL4,<br>
the client B sends an acknowledgment message AL5 to the client<br>
A, from which it is evident that the call that was initiated by<br>
the call signaling message RS1 has been forwarded to the client<br>
C and is now being signaled to the client C. After acceptance<br>
of the call at the client C, the client C sends a call<br>
acceptance message CN5 to the client B, in response to which<br>
the client B sends the call acceptance message CN6 to the<br>
client A, from which it is evident that the call has been<br>
accepted at the client C. The call acceptance messages CN5 and<br>
CN6 each also include the client address information for the<br>
client C. The information that the call has been accepted at<br>
the client C is now available in the client A, and the client<br>
address information for the client C is also available at the<br>
same time in the client A (as the calling client). On the other<br>
hand, the client address information for the client A is also<br>
available in the client C, so that the communication link K1<br>
can be set up directly as the payload data link between the<br>
clients A and C.<br>
In the exemplary embodiments described with reference to<br>
Figures 1a, 1b, 1c and 1d, a plurality of call forwarding<br>
destinations can in each case be stored in the client B as the<br>
first client. In this case, one service can be associated with<br>
each of these call forwarding destinations. It is thus<br>
possible, for example to use the client C as the call<br>
forwarding destination, for speech communication links, while a<br>
client D (not illustrated here) can be used as the call<br>
destination for fax messages. This is dependent on the call<br>
signaling message RS1, in each case also including details<br>
about the service which is intended to be used by the intended<br>
communication link K1. In the client B one of those clients<br>
which is suitable for the service of the communication link Kl,<br>
is then selected as the destination client.<br>
The implementation of the feature "follow-me" in a directly-<br><br>
communicating communication network will be explained in the<br>
following text with reference to the Figures 2a and 2b. In the<br>
case of follow-me, a call is signaled not only to a called<br>
terminal (client) but at the same time also to at least one<br>
further client. In this case, the call can be received at any<br>
of the clients to which this call is signaled.<br>
Figures 2a and 2b show the clients A, B, C which are already<br>
known from Figures 1a to 1d. In a first variant of the<br>
embodiment of follow-me, which will be explained with reference<br>
to Figure 2a, the designation and the client address<br>
information for the client C, as the destination client for<br>
follow-me, are stored by a user in the client B as the first<br>
client. In order to set up a communication link, the client A<br>
sends call signaling messages RS1 to the client B. The client B<br>
starts to signal the call ("the client B rings") and also sends<br>
further call signaling messages RS5 to the client C as the<br>
destination client, with the calling client A being indicated,<br>
with his client address information in the call signaling<br>
message RS5 in precisely the same way as in the call signaling<br>
message RS1. On the basis of the received call signaling<br>
message RS5, the call from the client A is now also signaled to<br>
the client C with a call acceptance message, which includes the<br>
client address information for the client C, being sent from<br>
the client C to the client B on acceptance of the call at the<br>
client C, and being passed on from the client B to the client<br>
A. After reception of this call acceptance message by the<br>
client A, the communication link is set up between the client A<br>
as the calling client and the client C.<br>
Alternatively, after acceptance of the call at the client C,<br>
the call acceptance message can also be transmitted directly<br>
from the client C to the client A.<br>
When the call which is signaled at the same time to the client<br>
B and the client C is accepted at the client B instead of the<br><br>
client C, the client B sends a call signaling cancellation<br>
message to the client C, after whose reception at the client D<br>
the call signaling to the client C is stopped, and the client B<br>
also sends a call acceptance signaling message to the client A,<br>
which includes the client address information for the client C,<br>
and after whose reception the client A sets up a communication<br>
link between the client A and the client B.<br>
Figure 2b shows a second variant for implementation of the<br>
feature "follow-me". In this example as well, the client A is<br>
the calling client, the client B is the first client, and the<br>
client C is the destination client. In the same way, the<br>
information is stored in the client B that the client C should<br>
likewise signal each call which is signaled to the client B.<br>
For this purpose, the client address information for the client<br>
C is also stored in the client B. In order to set up a<br>
communication link the client A sends a call signaling message<br>
RS1 to the client B. The call is signaled to the client B, and<br>
at the same time the client B sends a follow-me signaling<br>
message RZ1 back to the client A. It is evident from this<br>
follow-me signaling message RZ1 that the call which was<br>
signaled from the client A to the client B is also intended to<br>
be signaled to the client C with its associated client address.<br>
After reception of this follow-me signaling message RZl, the<br>
client A sends a further call signaling message to the client C<br>
with this call signaling message including the information that<br>
this call is a call which has been connected from the client B.<br>
After reception of the call signaling message RS6, the call is<br>
also signaled to the client C. The signaling of the call is<br>
acknowledged both by client B and by the client C, in each case<br>
by means of an acknowledgment message (not illustrated here) to<br>
the client A. If the call is now accepted at the client C, the<br>
client C sends a call acceptance message to the client A, after<br>
whose reception the client A sends to the client B a control<br>
message to end the call initiated by the call signaling message<br><br>
RS1, and as a result of which the communication link is<br>
furthermore set up between the client A and the client C.<br>
Alternatively, the call which is signaled to the client B and<br>
to the client C at the same time can be answered by the client<br>
B, as a result of which the client B then sends a call<br>
acceptance message to the client A. In this case, the client A<br>
sends a control message to the client C in order to end the<br>
call initiated by the call signaling message (cancellation<br>
message) RS6, and the communication link is also set up between<br>
the client A and the client B.<br>
In the case of the follow-me methods, described with reference<br>
to Figures 2a and 2b, a plurality of follow-me destinations can<br>
also be defined in each case in the first client B. In this<br>
case, a call can optionally be signaled at more than two<br>
terminals (clients) as well; alternatively or additionally<br>
different services can also be associated with these follow-me<br>
destinations, in which case one or more appropriate destination<br>
client or clients can be selected by the client B as a function<br>
of the service which is in each case requested by the call<br>
signaling message RS1. Furthermore, the "sender" of the call<br>
signaling message RS1 can also be evaluated in the client B, so<br>
that only calls from selected calling clients are signaled to<br>
the further clients.<br>
The implementation of the feature "callback" in a directly-<br>
communicating communication network will be described in the<br>
following text with reference to Figures 3a, 3b, 3c and 3d. In<br>
this case, Figures 3a and 3b relate to callback for a busy<br>
subscriber, while Figures 3c and 3d relate to callback for a<br>
free subscriber who has not accepted a call within a previously<br>
selected maximum waiting time.<br>
In order to explain the process for "callback when busy",<br>
Figure 3a shows the client A as the destination client and the<br><br>
client B as the first client and at the same time as the<br>
calling client. The client B in this case has a communication<br>
link K2 with the client C, so that the client B is busy.<br>
The preparation for and implementation of a callback between<br>
the client A and the client B from Figure 3a will be described<br>
in the following text with reference to Figure 3b. In order to<br>
set up a communication link, the client A sends a call<br>
signaling message RS1a to the client B. Since the client B is<br>
busy because of the communication link K2 to the client C, the<br>
client B responds to the call signaling message RSla by sending<br>
a busy message BS1 to the client A. An indication is now<br>
provided at the client A that the desired (called) client B is<br>
busy. The user of the client A now enters a command on his<br>
terminal with the aim of initializing the callback process.<br>
This command results in the client A sending to the client B a<br>
callback request message RR1, which includes the name and<br>
client address information of the client A. The client A sends<br>
an acknowledgment message (not illustrated here) to the client<br>
A in order to acknowledge reception of the callback request<br>
message RR1.<br>
When the communication link K2 has ended, the client B sends a<br>
callback completion message RK1 to the client A, thus signaling<br>
to the client A that the callback which was prepared for with<br>
the callback request message RR1 can take place. The client<br>
address information for the client A which was transmitted with<br>
the callback request message RR1 to the client B and restored<br>
there is used in this case to send the callback completion<br>
message RR1. After reception of the callback completion message<br>
RK1, the client A sends to the client B a new call signaling<br>
message RS1b as a result of which the call from the client A is<br>
signaled to the client B, which is now no longer busy. Once the<br>
call has been accepted at the client B (this step is no longer<br>
illustrated in Figure 3b), the client B sends a call acceptance<br>
message to the client A, as a result of which the communication<br><br>
link is set up between the client A and the client B.<br>
Figures 3c and 3d illustrate the process of callback to a free<br>
subscriber with Figure 3c showing the arrangement in which the<br>
client A is the destination client and the client B is the<br>
first client, and is at the same time a calling client. The<br>
interchange of the signaling messages relating to this between<br>
the client A and the client B is illustrated schematically in<br>
Figure 3d.<br>
As can be seen from Figure 3d, the client A sends a first call<br>
signaling message RS1a to the client B in order to set up a<br>
communication link. As a result of this call signaling message<br>
RSla, the call is signaled to the client B and the client B<br>
sends a call acknowledgment message AL1 ("alerting") to the<br>
client A as an acknowledgment message. A maximum time TO2 (in<br>
this case 20 seconds) is stored in the client A, and defines<br>
the maximum time period for call signaling of a call<br>
originating from the client A. If the call has not been<br>
accepted by the client B within this maximum time T02, the<br>
client A sends to the client B the callback request message RR1<br>
which, in addition to the request for callback, also includes<br>
the client address information for the client A. This callback<br>
request is stored in the client B together with the received<br>
client address information of the client A.<br>
The process of carrying out the callback from the client B to<br>
the client A makes sense, of course, only when a user is<br>
present at the client B for whom the communication link could<br>
be intended. The terminal which forms the client B thus waits<br>
for a corresponding event which could indicate the presence of<br>
a natural person. In this case, this is the pressing of any key<br>
on the user interface of the client B. Any other event which<br>
can be detected by a technical device that is connected to the<br>
client B may, of course, also be used for this purpose. Once<br>
this event has been entered, a callback completion message RK1<br><br>
is sent from the client B to the client A, as a consequence of<br>
which the client A sends to the client B a new call signaling<br>
message RSlb. After reception of the call signaling message<br>
RSlb, the call is signaled to the client B, in which case,<br>
after the call has been accepted, an appropriate call<br>
acceptance message (not illustrated any further here) is sent<br>
from the client B to the client A and this also results in the<br>
communication link being established between the client A and<br>
the client B. In this case, it should be noted that the call<br>
signaling and thus the setting up of the call originate from<br>
the client A both in the case of the call signaling message<br>
RS1a and in the case of the further call signaling message<br>
RSlb, so that the client A is debited with the payment of the<br>
charges, even in the case of the callback, charges which should<br>
generally always be debited to the originally calling client.<br>
In the case of the abovementioned exemplary embodiments it may<br>
be advantageous if a call to a client need not be explicitly<br>
accepted by a user. For this purpose, the call signaling<br>
messages are used to signal to a called client a "message"<br>
command, which results in the call signaling being suppressed<br>
and the called client being switched directly either to a<br>
"replay" mode (receive/replay) or to a completely active mode<br>
("direct addressing" mode, transmission and reception). The<br>
"message" command can alternatively also be used to specify<br>
that a message which will be transmitted subsequently will not<br>
be replayed immediately, but after a defined time delay, at a<br>
specific time, or as a function of a specific event (pressing<br>
of a key, fire alarm, ending of an existing communication link,<br>
etc.) .<br>
Figures 4a and 4b show the signaling of a recorded message for<br>
a relevant client, and the calling of this stored message by<br>
the relevant client is described. The visualization (signaling)<br>
of a waiting message on the user interface of a client is also<br>
referred to as the "message waiting indication".<br><br>
First of all, the recording and the signaling of a message will<br>
be described with reference to Figure 4a. In order to set up a<br>
communication link, a client A sends a call signaling message<br>
RS1 to the client B, where the call is now signaled. However,<br>
the call is not answered at the client B, so that, once a<br>
previously defined waiting time TO1 (in this case 20 seconds)<br>
has elapsed, a control message (not illustrated here) is sent<br>
from the client A to the client B in order to end the call<br>
signaling (call cancellation message), this ending the call<br>
signaling to the client B. The user of the client A is now<br>
offered the option on the user interface to set up a link to a<br>
message store ("call answering service"), in order to store a<br>
message for the client B that cannot be reached. After<br>
confirmation by the user, the client A sets up a communication<br>
link to the client R, which is equipped with an appropriate<br>
memory unit SP1.<br>
In the present case, the client address information for the<br>
client R is permanently programmed in the client A; the client<br>
A may, of course, also have search functions by means of which<br>
one or more clients which have appropriate memory devices can<br>
be found in a directly communicating communication network. In<br>
this case, as in the previous examples, a distinction can<br>
possibly be drawn between different services, so that only<br>
speech memories("voice mail server") are looked for and used<br>
for speech links, and e-mail servers or the like are looked for<br>
and used for example for text messages. The client A uses the<br>
communication link K3 set up to the client R to store the<br>
message to be stored in the data memory SP1 of the client R and<br>
then sets up the link to the client R. After this, the client A<br>
sends to the client B, which is being used as the first client,<br>
a message waiting indication MWI1, which includes the client<br>
address information of the client R being used as the<br>
destination client, and an identification number for the<br>
message to be called up.<br><br>
The process of the client B, which in this case is being used<br>
as the called client, calling up the previously stored message<br>
will be explained in the following text with reference to<br>
Figure 4b. The user of the client B sees the information on the<br>
optical display of the user interface of the client B that a<br>
stored message from the client A can be called up. Once the<br>
user has entered a call-up command, the client B sends a<br>
specific call signaling message RSA to the client A in order to<br>
call up messages, with this call signaling message RSA<br>
including the identification number of the stored message<br>
intended for the client B. Furthermore, the call signaling<br>
message RSA includes the client address information for the<br>
client B. The communication link K4, via which the client R<br>
transmits the message stored in the data memory ST1 to the<br>
client B, is set up between the client B and the client R on<br>
the basis of the client address information interchanged in<br>
this way.<br>
The setting up and the clearing of a communication link from a<br>
waiting client to an information source for waiting information<br>
will be described in the following text with reference to<br>
Figure 5. In this case the waiting client can not only be<br>
supplied with waiting music or audio-based waiting information<br>
but it is also possible to provide, for example video messages<br>
or text-based information to the waiting user depending on the<br>
configuration of the client and the waiting information source.<br>
This feature is thus in general also referred to as "media on<br>
hold".<br>
In the initial state, the client A as the first client and the<br>
client B as the second client are connected to one another in a<br>
communication link K5a. This communication link K5a is assumed<br>
to have been temporarily interrupted by the client B. One<br>
possible reason for this is an inquiry from the client B and a<br>
further possible reason may be the intention of the client B to<br><br>
supply the client A with previously stored information. The<br>
last-mentioned application is typical of a call center, in<br>
which a caller is asking for specific information and this<br>
information is played back to the caller, initiated by a call<br>
center agent.<br>
In order to interrupt the communication link K5a and to start<br>
the information playback, the client B sends to the client A a<br>
call redirect signaling message RD2 (RD = redirect), which in<br>
addition to the "redirect" command includes the client address<br>
information for the client R that is intended to be the<br>
destination client. This client address information is stored<br>
in the client A, which is being used as the first client.<br>
Furthermore, the client B sends a message select signaling<br>
message MS1 (MS = message select) to the client R, in which the<br>
designation of that information which is intended to be made<br>
available to the client A is transmitted to the client R. The<br>
signaling message MS1 for this purpose also, of course,<br>
includes the client address information for the client A. The<br>
client R is equipped with the database SB2, in which a number<br>
of selectable information contents are stored in the form of<br>
files.<br>
As the calling client, the client A now sends signaling<br>
messages (not illustrated here) in order to set up a<br>
communication link K6 to the client A. This signaling message<br>
contains the client address information for the client A. In<br>
the client R, it is found that a message has already been<br>
selected for this client A, so that the client R sends a<br>
acknowledgement message "connect" (likewise, not illustrated<br>
here) to the client A, after whose reception the communication<br>
link K6 is set up. The communication link K6 is a<br>
monodirectional communication is set up. The communication link<br>
K6 is a monodirectional communication link, that is to say only<br>
a single data stream (data channel) is switched, specifically<br>
from the client R to the client A.<br><br>
Alternatively, the information relating to the selected message<br>
can also be transmitted from the client B to the client A. Once<br>
the communication link K6 has been set up, the client A then<br>
itself requests the message from the client R.<br>
In the present exemplary embodiment, this is waiting<br>
information which is transmitted by means of the communication<br>
link K6 from the client R to the client A, where it is<br>
reproduced. This waiting information is used to bridge the time<br>
period for an inquiry (not illustrated here) from the client B.<br>
Once this inquiry has been completed, the client B should end<br>
the replaying of the waiting music to the client A, and the<br>
interrupted communication link K5a should be resumed. For this<br>
purpose, the client B sends a signaling message RUl (connection<br>
transfer message) to the client A, which includes the client's<br>
address information for the client B and reference to the call<br>
redirect signaling message RD2. The client A therefore<br>
recognizes that the client B has the authorization to end the<br>
existing communication link K6 and to request the setting up of<br>
a "new" communication link K5b, which is used as a continuation<br>
of the interrupted communication link K5a. Together with the<br>
signaling message RUl, the client B sends to the client R a<br>
media control message MS2, in order to stop the replaying of<br>
the waiting information.<br>
After reception of the signaling message RUl the communication<br>
link K6 is ended by the client A, and the communication link<br>
K5b is set up between the client A and the client B.<br>
Alternatively, it is also possible to avoid sending the media<br>
control message MS2 from the client B to the client R in order<br>
to allow the communication link K5b to be interrupted once<br>
again by the client B at a later time, in order then to<br>
continue the replaying of the waiting information for the<br>
client A at the previously interrupted point.<br><br>
If the replaying of the waiting information is not carried out<br>
purely to bridge the waiting time but to provide specific<br>
information of the client A, it is advantageous to replay all<br>
of the selected waiting information to the client A. In this<br>
case, the link is not retrieved by the client B with the aid of<br>
the signaling message RU1 at an arbitrary time, and instead of<br>
this the client R then uses a signaling message "message<br>
complete" (not illustrated) to signal to the client B that the<br>
requested information has been replayed completely, in which<br>
case the client B does not initiate the clearing of the<br>
communication link K6 and the setting up of the communication<br>
link K5b to the client A until the "message complete" signaling<br>
message has been received.<br>
Temporary interruptions in the waiting information replay<br>
("announcement") and thus in the communication link K6 are also<br>
possible, for example for a personal inquiry. This inquiry can<br>
be initiated either by sending appropriate signaling messages<br>
from the client B to the clients A and R, or by means of<br>
signaling messages which are sent from the client A to the<br>
clients B and R. Instead of completely interrupting the<br>
communication link K6, it is alternatively possible in the<br>
first-mentioned case to also "merge" the inquiry "softly" into<br>
the waiting information replay. For this purpose, specific<br>
control commands are transmitted with signaling messages<br>
transmitted by the client B leading to appropriate mixing of<br>
the waiting information with the inquiry in the client A.<br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1. A method for setting up a communication link between two clients of a<br>
plurality of clients in a directly-communicating communication network,<br>
in which signaling information comprising client address information is<br>
interchanged between clients who wish to be involved in the communication<br>
link, in order to set up the communication link,<br>
the communication link is set up directly between the clients who wish to be<br>
involved in the communication link, on the basis of the client address<br>
information, characterized by<br>
the following method steps which carried out successively:<br>
a)	a first communication link exists between a calling client and a second<br>
client, the client address information of a destination client being transmitted<br>
by the second client to the calling client,<br>
b)	the first communication link is cleared<br>
c)the calling client uses this client address information to set up the<br>
communication link between the calling client and the destination client, and<br>
d) the communication link set up in step c) between the calling client and the<br>
destination client is taken down and the first communication link is set up<br>
again.<br><br>
2.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the destination client is used as an<br>
information source for waiting times.<br>
3.	The method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein several clients can be used as<br>
destination clients in the communication network, a destination client being<br>
selected as one of the suitable clients by the second client in step a).<br>
4.The method as claimed in one of the preceding claims, wherein the calling<br>
client transmits call signaling information with a control command to the<br>
destination client when setting up the communication link in step c) so that the<br>
call is accepted automatically by the destination client.<br><br><br><br>
ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
TITLE: "A method for setting up a communication link between two clients of a<br>
plurality of clients in a directly communicating communication network"<br>
The invention relates to a method for setting up a communication link between<br>
two clients of a plurality of clients in a directly-communicating communication<br>
network, in which signaling information comprising client address information is<br>
interchanged between clients who wish to be involved in the communication link,<br>
in order to set up the communication link, the communication link is set up<br>
directly between the clients who wish to be involved in the communication link,<br>
on the basis of the client address information, following method steps which<br>
carried out successively a) a first communication link exists between a calling<br>
client and a second client, the client address information of a destination client<br>
being transmitted by the second client to the calling client, b) the first<br>
communication link is cleared c) the calling client uses this client address<br>
information to set up the communication link between the calling client and the<br>
destination client, and d) the communication link set up in step c) between the<br>
calling client and the destination client is taken down and the first<br>
communication link is set up again.</td>
