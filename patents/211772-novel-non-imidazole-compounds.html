H3-Receptor Binding Assay<br>
The source of the H3 receptors in this experiment was guinea pig brain. The animals weighed 400-600 g. The brain tissue was homogenized with a solution of 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5. The final concentration of tissue in the homogenization buffer was 10% w/v. The homogenates were centrifuged at 1,000 x g for 10 min. in order to remove clumps of tissue and debris. The resulting supernatants were then centrifuged at 50,000 x g for 20 min. in order to sediment the membranes, which were<br><br>
next washed three times in homogenization buffer (50,000 x g for 20 min, each). The membranes were frozen and stored at -70°C until needed.<br>
All compounds to be tested were dissolved in DMSO and then diluted into the binding buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5) such that the final concentration was 2[jg/ml with 0.1% DMSO. Membranes were then added (400 \}g of protein) to the reaction tubes.<br>
The reaction was started by the addition of 3 nM [^HJR-a-methyl histamine (8.8<br>
Ci/mmol) or 3 nM [3H]N"-methyl histamine (80 Ci/mmol) and continued under incubation at 30°C for 30 min. Bound ligand was separated from unbound ligand by \ filtration, and the amount of radioactive ligand bound to the membranes was \ quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. All Incubations were performed in duplicate and the standard en-or was always less than 10%. Compounds that inhibited more than 70% of the specific binding of radioactive ligand to the receptor were serially diluted to determine a Kj (nM).<br>
