				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
HIGH   SOLID   TYPE   ANTICORROSIVE   COATING   COMPOSITION<br>
TECHNICAL   FIELD [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a high solid type (namely, with a high content of non-volatile components and a low content of volatile organic components) anticorrosive coating composition capable of forming a coating film having excellent drying properties during coating as well as having excellent oil resistance, solvent resistance, chemical resistance and anticorrosive properties, which is suitable for coating a ship oil   tank,   for   example,   and  to   applications   thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND  ART [0002]<br>
Conventionally, a solid bisphenol A (BPA) type epoxy resin or a novolac epoxy resin and a modified epoxy compound such as diethylene triamine (DETA) adduct are used (blended) for a coating material capable of forming a coating film having excellent oil resistance, solvent resistance, chemical resistance and anticorrosive properties  for use in the inner surface of a product<br>
carrier tank or the like. These coating materials can provide a coating film excellent in oil resistance, solvent resistance and chemical resistance. However, as they contain a relatively high molecular weight resin, they require a large amount of solvent in terms of coating workability and others, and it is difficult to make them a high solid type. If the amount of the solvent is reduced to make them a high solid type, oil resistance, solvent resistance and chemical resistance of the obtained anticorrosive coating film would be inferior to those of the conventional products without reduction of the amount of solvent. [0003]<br>
If an epoxy adduct of an amine compound having a reduced ratio of an epoxy adduct is used in combination with a relatively high molecular weight resin to make them a high solid type, the coating material obtained has drying properties inferior to the conventional products. On the other hand, if a low molecular weight amine is used, the drying rate decreases. [0004]<br>
Furthermore, a high solid type coating material using a modified polyamine such as cardanol or the like is available in the market. However, oil resistance, solvent resistance and chemical resistance of the coating film obtained are inferior to those  of  a  coating material using a modified amine  epoxy compound<br>
such   as   an   adduct   of   diethylene   triamine    (DETA)   and  either   a bisphenol  A   (BPA)   type  epoxy   resin  or  a  novolac  epoxy  resin. [0005]<br>
JP-A-1995 (H3) -275773 ( Patent Document 1, corresponding to JP-B-2505301) discloses "a heavy-duty anticorrosive coated steel obtained by putting a coating layer on pretreated surface of the steel, wherein the coating layer material contains (a) a bisphenol type liquid epoxy resin having 2 or more epoxy groups in one molecule with an epoxy equivalent weight of less than 250, (b) a curing agent containing 10 to 100 parts by weight of an aliphatic polyamide amine or an epoxy compound modified with an aliphatic polyamide amine per 100 parts by weight of a modified amine of xylylenediamine or iso-phorone diamine with an epoxy resin, and (c) 20 to 65 wt%, as Pigment Weight Content, of a pigment". [0006]<br>
However, a coating film formed from the coating material for the heavy-duty anticorrosive coating of steel disclosed in the Patent Document 1 is inferior in oil resistance, solvent resistance and chemical resistance, and has a serious problem particularly in solvent resistance, such that a significant blister takes place in half a day when dipped in a solvent such as   EDC,   MEK  or  benzene   at   room  temperature.<br>
[Patent  Document  1]   JP-A-1995(H3)-275773   (corresponding<br>
DISCLOSURE   OF  THE   INVENTION [Problems  to  be   Solved  by  the   Invention] [0007]<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to solve the above-mentioned problems associated with the prior arts, and to provide a high solid type anticorrosive coating composition capable of forming a coating film having excellent drying properties of the unhardened film (drying quickly) during coating on a base material, as well as capable of forming a coating film having excellent oil resistance, solvent resistance, chemical resistance and anticorrosive properties on the surface of the base material. [0008]<br>
In other words, an object of the present invention is to provide a high solid type anticorrosive coating composition suitable not only for coating a pipeline and the like but also for coating the inner surface of the tanks in a product carrier or a chemical tanker, where high oil resistance, solvent resistance and chemical resistance are required in addition to anticorrosive  properties.<br>
 [Means   for  Solving  the   Problems] [0009]<br>
The high solid type anticorrosive coating composition of the present invention comprises (A) a main component containing a semi-solid state bisphenol type epoxy resin having epoxy equivalent weight of 250 to 300 (a1) , (B) a curing component containing an epoxy adduct of xylylenediamine (b1) and an epoxy adduct of polyamide (b2), wherein the above curing component (B) contains 50 to 200 parts by weight of the epoxy adduct of polyamide (b2) per 100 parts by weight of the epoxy adduct of xylylenediamine (bl) . [0010]<br>
With  regard  to  the  semi-solid  state  bisphenol  type  epoxy resin     (al)     contained    in    the    main    component     (A),     an    epoxy equivalent   weight   of   260   to   280   is   more   preferable   from   the viewpoint  of  the  physical  properties   of  the   coating   film. [0011]<br>
Moreover, from the viewpoint of oil resistance, solvent resistance and chemical resistance of the coating film, it is more preferable that the curing component (B) contains 70 to 150 parts by weight of the epoxy adduct of polyamide (b2) per 100 parts by weight of the epoxy adduct of xylylenediamine (bl). [0012]Furthermore, because of the tendency of the coating film to have excellent crosslinking density, oil resistance, solvent resistance, chemical resistance, water resistance and adhesion to a base material, the ratio of active hydrogen in the curing component (B) to the epoxy group in the main component (A) is preferably in the range of 0.8 to 1.0. [0013]<br>
Moreover, in the present invention, from the viewpoint of increasing adhesion of the coating film to a base material to improve water resistance and the like, one of the preferred embodiments is that the main component (A) or the curing component (B) contains a silane coupling agent, and that the ratio is 0.1 to 4 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the main component (A) . [0014]<br>
Furthermore, in the present invention another preferred embodiment is that the main agent component (A) or the curing component (B) contains an extender pigment (preferably at least one extender pigment selected from the group consisting of silica, talc, mica and barium sulfate). When the extender pigment is added to the paint composition of the present invention, the ratio of the extender pigment used is preferably 20 to 70 parts by weight per   100  parts  by  weight  of  the  main  component   (A).<br>
 [0015]<br>
Moreover, in the present invention, another preferred embodiment  is  that  the main component  (A)  or the  curing component<br>
(B) contains a coloring pigment (preferably at least one coloring pigment selected from the group consisting of titanium white, carbon black and red iron oxide) . When the coloring pigment is added to the coating composition of the present invention, the ratio of the coloring pigment used is preferably 1 to 20 parts by  weight  per   100  parts  by  weight  of  the  main  component   (A).<br>
[0016]<br>
When at least one of the above-mentioned extender pigment and the coloring pigment is added to the coating composition of the  present  invention,   the  volume  content  of  the  total  pigments<br>
(Pigment Volume Content, PVC) including extender and coloring pigments is preferably 20 to 50 %, and more preferably 25 to 45 %, in order to maintain the effect of stress relaxation and water resistance of the coating film as well as the coating workability at an appropriate level. [0017]<br>
The total amount of the bisphenol type epoxy resin (al), the epoxy adduct of xylylenediamine (bl) and the epoxy adduct of polyamide (b2), namely { (al) + (bl) + (b2) } in the anticorrosive coating    composition    is    preferably    15    to    45    wt%,     and   more<br>
preferably  20  to  40  wt%,   from  the  viewpoint  of  oil  resistance, chemical  resistance,   solvent  resistance  and water  resistance  of the   coating  film  obtained. [0018]<br>
The anticorrosive coating composition of the present invention can be utilized as a coating composition particularly for coating a ship or a ship tank. By applying such paint composition on the surface of a base material (for example, a ship tank), a coating film is formed providing the base material with various characteristics such as oil resistance, solvent resistance, chemical resistance and anticorrosive properties. In other words, coating the above-mentioned base material with such coating film is suitable as a method for preventing corrosion. Furthermore, the above-mentioned base material coated by such a coating film has the various excellent properties mentioned above.<br>
[Effect   of  the   Invention]<br>
[0019]<br>
According to the present invention, while limiting the content of a volatile organic component such as a solvent in the coating composition (namely, as a high solid type composition), the    coating   composition    capable    of    forming    a    coating    film<br>
excellent in various properties such as drying properties during coating, oil resistance, solvent resistance, chemical resistance and anticorrosive properties is obtained. Furthermore, by applying the coating composition of the present invention, various excellent properties as mentioned above can be provided to  various  base  materials   (for   example,   ship  tank).<br>
BEST   MODE   FOR  CARRYING   OUT   THE   INVENTION [0020]<br>
In the following, the high solid type anticorrosive coating composition of the present invention, the anticorrosive coating film formed from the coating composition, the base material coated with the coating film, the ship tank coated with the coating film formed from the above-mentioned anticorrosive coating composition, and the method of preventing corrosion of the base material surface will be explained in detail. [0021]<br>
The coating composition of the present invention is referred to as "anticorrosive coating composition" because it is particularly excellent in anticorrosive properties, but included in the preferred embodiments of the coating composition of the present invention are not only the composition used to provide the   base   material   with   anticorrosive   properties   but   also   the<br>
composition  used  to  provide  oil  resistance,   solvent  resistance, chemical  resistance  and  the  like  or  the  composition  used  with  a view to providing adhesive properties  commonly observed  in  epoxy resin-based  coating  compositions. i       [0022]<br>
As for the definition of the amount of the components contained in the coating composition of the present invention, the weight of the "coating composition" or the "main component (A)" referred as the base, unless otherwise noted, is the weight  of solid part alone excluding volatile solvents such as toluene or methylisobutyl ketone. [0023]<br>
High  solid  type  anticorrosive  coating  composition The  high  solid  type  anticorrosive  coating  composition  of the  present  invention  (hereinafter,  it  may be  simply  referred as "the coating  composition")  contains  a  specific  epoxy resin based main  component   (A)   and  a  specific  amine  based  and  amide  based curing components  (B) .     These components  (A)  and  (B)  are normally kept,  stored and transported separately in different  containers, and  are  mixed  together  just  before  use.     Therefore,   the  coating composition of the present invention is a so-called two-component coating  composition. [0024]<br>
The   specific   definition   of   "high   solid   type"   for   the anticorrosive  coating  composition  of  the  present   invention  is that  the  VOC  during  coating  is  340  g/L   (regulated  value  in  the USA)   or  less. [0025]<br>
From the viewpoint of reaction efficiency (rapid and uniform curing of the coating composition), as well as oil resistance, solvent resistance, chemical resistance, solvent resistance, water resistance and adhesion to a base material of the coating film obtained, the ratio of the total number of active hydrogen groups in the epoxy adduct of xylylenediamine (bl) and the epoxy adduct of polyamide (b2) in the curing component (B) to the number of epoxy groups in the epoxy resin (al) in the main component (A) is desirably in the range of 0.5 to 1.0, and more desirably 0.8 to 1.0. [0026]<br>
Therefore,  from the viewpoint as mentioned above,  normally 5  to  25  parts  by  weight,   preferably  10  to  20  parts  by  weight  of the  curing  component   (B)   is  used  per  100  parts  by  weight  of  the main  component   (A)    (including  the  weight  of  volatile  solvent). [0027]<br>
Furthermore,   it  can  also  be  said  that  the  main  component (A)   and  the  curing  component   (B)   are  used  in  such  an  amount  that<br>
the total amount of the epoxy adduct of xylylenediamine (bl) and the epoxy adduct of polyamide (b2), namely {(bl) + (b2)} is normally 20 to 60 parts by weight, and preferably 30 to 50 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the epoxy resin (al) in the main component (A). [0028]<br>
In  the   following,   the  main  component    (A)   and  the  curing component   (B)   will  be  explained  in  more  detail. [0029]<br><main component><br>
The  main  component   (A)   as  a  component  composing  the  high solid   type   anticorrosive   coating   composition   of   the   present invention contains  a  semi-solid state bisphenol  type  epoxy resin having  a   specific  epoxy  equivalent  weight. [0030]<br>
From  the  viewpoint  of  obtaining  a  coating  film  excellent in    the    various    properties,    the    epoxy    equivalent    weight    as mentioned  above  is  in  the  present  invention  normally  in  a  range from  250  to   300   (g/equiv),   preferably  260   to   280   (g/equiv). [0031]<br>
The definition of "semi-solid state" of the bisphenol type epoxy resin (al) is that the viscosity at ordinary temperature (measured   under   the   conditions   of   23°C,    85%   concentration   in<br><br>
xylene  as  solvent,   using  E-type  FMD  viscometer  manufactured  by TOKIMEC Co. ,  Ltd. )   is  normally  in the  range  of  4500  to  5500 mPa. s, and  preferably  4000   to   5000  mPa.s. [0032]<br>
In the present invention, bisphenol type (A type or F type) epoxy resin is used because it can provide a coating film having excellent adhesion to base material and anticorrosive properties, and bisphenol A type is particularly preferable among them. The "epoxy resin" includes a polymer or an oligomer having 2 or more epoxy groups in a molecule, as well as a polymer or an oligomer formed by ring-opening reaction of the epoxy group (collectively called "ring-opening reaction product"). [0033]<br>
Examples of the bisphenol A type epoxy resin mentioned above include a polycondensate of bisphenol A type di-glycidyl ether such as bisphenol A di-glycidyl ether, bisphenol A propylene oxide di-glycidyl ether, bisphenol A ethylene oxide di-glycidyl ether, hydrogenated bisphenol A di-glycidyl ether, hydrogenated bisphenol A propylene oxide di-glycidyl ether, and the like. [0034]<br>
Examples of the representative epoxy resin products which can be used in the present invention include "E-834-85X{PC)" produced  by  Ohtake-Meishin  Chemical  Co.,   Ltd.   (epoxy  eguivalent<br>
weight: 260 to 280, viscosity: about 4000 mPa.s, property: semi-solid state), "Epicoat 834" produced by Japan Epoxy Resins Co., Ltd. (bisphenol A type epoxy resin, epoxy equivalent weight: 230 to 270, viscosity by Gardner/Holz method: P-U/25°C), and the like. [0035]<br>
These bisphenol type epoxy resins can be used alone or in a combination of two or more kinds. When two or more kinds are used in combination, the molecular weight and the epoxy equivalent weight of the bisphenol A type epoxy resin (al) are defined to be the average of the resins used. [0036]<br>
In the main component (A), a small amount of epoxy resin of a type other than bisphenol A such as glycidyl ester type, glycidyl amine type, phenol novolac type, cresol type, dimeric acid-modified type, aliphatic type, alicyclic type, epoxidized oil type and the like may be used together with the bisphenol A type as long as the effects of the present invention are not depressed. [0037]<br>
Viscosity, epoxy equivalent weight, average molecular weight and the like of the bisphenol type epoxy resin (al) may be  suitably adjusted within the predetermined range,  considering<br>
factors,  in addition to the  effect  of the present  invention,  such as   curing  conditions    (e.g.,   air-drying  coating,   baking   finish coating),    coating   workability    and   the    like    of    the    coating composition. [0038]<br>
In  the  present   invention,   in  view  of  adhesion  to  a  base material,   water  resistance  and  anticorrosive  properties  of  the coating  film  obtained,   the  content  of  the  bisphenol  type  epoxy resin  (al)  in the main component  (A)   (including volatile solvent) is   normally   15   to   45   wt%,   and  preferably  20   to   40   wt%. [0039]<br>
Based on the weight of the solid component excluding volatile solvent in the main component (A), the content of the bisphenol type epoxy resin (al) is, in the same sense of the term as above, normally 18 to 55 parts by weight, and preferably 25 to 45 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the solid component. [0040]<br><curing component><br>
The curing component (B) , which is another component composing the high solid type anticorrosive coating composition of the present invention, contains the epoxy adduct of xylylenediamine   (b1)   and  the  epoxy  adduct  of  polyamide   (b2)   in<br>
a   specific  ratio. [0041]<br>
The epoxy adduct of xylylenediamine (b1) is obtained by reacting xylylenediamine with an epoxy resin such as a bisphenol A type epoxy resin. The epoxy resin used in this reaction has normally a lower molecular weight (for example, an epoxy equivalent weight of 184 to 194, and an average molecular weight of 368 to 388) than the epoxy resin in the main component (A) mentioned above. [0042]<br>
The epoxy adduct  of polyamide  (b2)  is  obtained by reacting a  polyamide  with  the   same   epoxy  resin  as   used  for   (bl). [0043]<br>
Examples of the epoxy adduct of xylylenediamine (bl) mentioned above include the commercial products such as "NAD 200P" (MXDA (methaxylylenediamine) epoxy adduct, viscosity: 1000 to 1500 mPa.s) produced by Ohtake-Meishin Chemical Co. , Ltd, and the example of the epoxy adduct of polyamide (b2) include "PA2 97P" (viscosity: 4000 to 7000 mPa.s) produced by Ohtake-Meishin Chemical Co., Ltd. [0044]<br>
The coating composition of the present invention contains, from   the   viewpoint    of   physical   properties,    oil    resistance,<br><br>
solvent resistance, chemical resistance and water resistance of the obtained coating film, normally 50 to 200 parts by weight, and preferably 70 to 150 parts by weight of the epoxy adduct of polyamide (b2) per 100 parts by weight of the epoxy adduct of xylylenediamine (bl). If the content of the epoxy adduct of polyamide (b2) exceeds the above range, a relative content of the solvent increases, which makes it difficult to obtain a high solid type composition, and drying properties of the uncured coating film just after coating tends to be inferior. On the other hand, if the content is lower than above range, properties of the coating film, particularly oil resistance, solvent resistance and chemical resistance tend to be inferior. [0045]<br>
In the coating composition of the present invention, in view of excellent crosslinking density, oil resistance, solvent resistance, chemical resistance and water resistance of the coating film obtained, the total amount of the bisphenol type epoxy resin (al), the epoxy adduct of xylylenediamine (bl) and the epoxy adduct of polyamide (b2), namely { (al) + (bl) + (b2) } is 15 to 45 wt%, and preferably 20 to 40 wt% of the paint composition. [0046]<br><silane coupling agent><br>
In the present invention, addition of one or two or more kinds of silane coupling agent in the main component (A) and/or the curing component (B) is preferable to improve adhesion strength of the coating film to a base material, as well as water resistance. [0047]<br>
As the silane coupling agent mentioned above, those compounds publicly known can be used. In the present invention, a silane coupling agent containing at least one reactive functional group selected from the group consisting of amino group, carboxyl group, hydroxyl group, epoxy group and glycidyl group, preferably that of containing an epoxy group is desirably used. [0048]<br>
Specific examples of the above-mentioned silane coupling<br>
agent containing epoxy group include those shown in (1) to (5)<br>
in Table 1 below. Particularly, (3,4-epoxycyclohexyl)ethyl<br>
trimethoxy silane as shown in (1), and -glycidoxypropyl<br>
trimethoxy silane as shown in (2) (produced by Dow Corning Toray<br>
Co.,     Ltd.      "SH6040"     etc.)     are     preferable.	In     addition,<br>
y-glycidoxy propylmethyl dimethoxy silane as shown in (3) (produced by Dow Corning Toray Co., Ltd. "AY43-026"), and y-glycidoxy  propylmethyl  diethoxy  silane  as  shown  in   (4)   may  be<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
When a silane coupling agent is used in the present invention, it is preferably added in the main component (A) . From the viewpoint of enhancing adhesion of coating film to a base material and water resistance, the amount to be added is normally 0.1 to 4 parts by weight, and preferably 0.2 to 2 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the main component (A). [0050]<br>
Based  on  the  total  weight  of  the  coating  composition  of the  present  invention,  the  amount  of  silane  coupling  agent  to be added is  normally  0.1  to  15  wt%,  preferably  0.5  to  5 wt%,  and more preferably  1  to   3  wt%. [0051]<br>
By adding a silane coupling agent in the coating composition in the above-mentioned amount, adhesion of the coating film formed from the composition to a base material is enhanced without peeling of the film at all even immersed in water for a prolonged time, and effectively prevents a metal base material (particularly a stainless base material) from pitting corrosion, crevice corrosion, dissimilar metal contact corrosion and stress corrosion. These effects are markedly revealed when a silane coupling agent having an epoxy group is added. [0052]<br><extender pigment><br>
In   the   present   invention,    one   or   two   or   more   kinds   of extender  pigments  may  be  added  to  the  main  component   (A)   and/or the  curing  component   (B). [0053]<br>
As  the  extender  pigment  mentioned  above,   conventionally known  compounds  such  as  precipitated  barium  sulfate,   potassium feldspar,  kaolin,  alumina white,  clay,  talc,  bentonite,  magnesium carbonate,  barium carbonate,  silica   (particularly fine  powder), mica  powder,   glass   flake,   stainless   flake,   aluminum  flake, plastic  flake  and  the  like  can  be  used.     Among  them  talc,   silica (particularly  silica  fine  powder),   mica  and  barium  sulfate  are preferably  used  in  the  present   invention. [0054]<br>
When such an extender pigment is added to the coating composition of the present invention, normally 5 to 80 parts by weight, preferably 20 to 70 parts by weight, and more preferably 40 to 60 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the main component (A) may be added. [0055]<br><coloring pigment><br>
In   the   present   invention,    one   or   two   or   more   kinds   of coloring  pigments  may  be  added  to  the  main  component   (A)   and/or<br><br>
the  curing  component   (B). [0056]<br>
As  the  coloring  pigment  mentioned  above,   conventionally known  inorganic  pigments  such  as  carbon  black,   titanium  dioxide       (titanium  white),   red  iron  oxide,   iron  oxide,   iron  hydroxide, ultramarine,  or organic pigments such as cyanin blue,  cyanin green, and  the   like  may  be  used.     Among   them,     titanium  white,   carbon black  and  red  iron  oxide  may  be  preferably  used  in  the  present invention. [0057]<br>
When such a coloring pigment is added to the paint composition of the present invention, normally 1 to 50 parts by weight, preferably 1 to 20 parts by weight, and more preferably 2 to 10 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the main component (A) may be added. [0058]<br>
When at least one of the above-mentioned extender pigment and the coloring pigment is added to the anticorrosive coating composition of the present invention, the pigment volume content (PVC) of the total pigments including extender and coloring pigments is preferably 20 to 50 %, and more preferably 25 to 45 %, in order to maintain the effect of stress relaxation and water resistance  of  the  coating  film  as  well  as  coating  workability  at<br>
an appropriate level. If PVC is lower than the above range, the effect of pigment addition on stress relaxation tends to be insufficient. On the other hand, if PVC exceeds the above range, water resistance of the coating film and coating workability tend to decrease. [0059]<br><other components><br>
In the main component (A) used in the present invention, various other components such as an anti-sagging agent (an anti-settling agent), a fibrous material, the surfactant described in JP-A-1990(H2)-298563, an anti-corrosive pigment, and the like may be suitably added. [0060]<br>
Examples of the anti-sagging agent  include conventionally known compounds  such as organic clay-based wax such as a stearate, a lecithin salt,  an alkyl sulfonate of Al,  Ca,  and Zn,  polyethylene wax,   amide  wax,   hydrogenated   castor  oil  wax,   polyamide  wax,   a mixture   of   hydrogenated   castor   oil   wax   with   polyamide   wax, synthetic  fine  powder  silica,  polyethylene  oxide  based wax,  and the like.     Among them,  polyamide wax,  synthetic fine powder silica, polyethylene   oxide   based   wax   and   organic   clay   based   wax   are particularly  preferable. [0061]<br>
Examples  of  the  commercial  product  of  such  anti-sagging agent  include  "DISPARLON  305",   "DISPARLON  4200-20",   "DISPARLON 6650"   produced   by   Kusumoto   Chemicals,    Ltd.    and   "ASA   T-250F" produced  by  Itoh  Oil   Chemicals   Co.,   Ltd. [0062]<br>
When using  an  antisagging  agent  in  the  present  invention, 0.1  to  10  wt%  of  the  antisagging  agent  may  be  added  in  the  main component   (A). [0063]<br>
Production  of  the  high   solid  type  paint   composition<br>
The  high   solid   type   coating   composition   of   the   present invention   can   be   produced   by   preparing   separately   the   main component  (A)  and the  curing component  (B)  in advance,  and mixing and  kneading  them  just  before   use. [0064]<br>
The main component (A) can be prepared by mixing the resin, the pigment, the solvent and the additives composing thereof, followed by agitating and kneading the mixture. In this case, an SG mill or a high speed disperser may be used by keeping the mill base temperature at 55 to 60°C for about 30 minutes to disperse the components as homogeneously as possible. On the other hand, the curing component (B) can be prepared by mixing the resin, the solvent  and the  like  composing  thereof  and dispersing  them using<br>
an  agitator. [0065]<br>
Use  of  the  coating  composition<br>
By applying and curing the coating composition of the present invention on a base material surface, a coating film (layer) can be formed to provide the base material with various properties such as anticorrosive properties, oil resistance, solvent resistance, chemical resistance and water resistance. In other words, by coating the base material surface with the above-mentioned coating film, excellent oil resistance (particularly required for ship tanks) can be provided to the base material, and at the same time, pitting corrosion, crevice corrosion, dissimilar metal contact corrosion and stress corrosion of the base material can be prevented. [0066]<br>
The paint composition of the present invention may be applied to the surface of a base material such as ship, steel structure, ship tank and the like, using the known methods such as airless spray, air spray, brushing, roller coating and the like. Examples of materials to which the coating composition of the present invention may be applied include steel, nonferrous metals (zinc, aluminum, stainless steel and the like) , and the like. It is   preferable   that   mild   steel    (e.g.,    SS400)    or   the   like   is<br><br>
subjected in advance to surface preparation by polishing using such a tool as grit blasting. For coating work, the coating composition may be suitably diluted with a thinner or the like. [0067]<br>
The   thickness   of   the    above   coating   film   after   curing<br>
(drying)    is   not   particularly   limited.      However,    in   order   to<br>
provide     enough     anticorrosive     properties     efficiently,     the<br>
thickness  is  normally  50  to  500  µm,   and preferably  200  to  300  µm.<br>
[0068]<br>
The coating composition of the present invention, as mentioned above, can provide a coating film of excellent properties on the base material surface. Therefore, it can be suitably applied to, for example, a seawater desalination facility, a part of a marine structure where maintenance work is difficult to implement, around a dam and a water gate, piping in a plant using seawater, river water and industrial water for cooling, a water storage, a water tank, a storage pool for nuclear fuel waste, and the like. [0069]<br>
It can also be used for repair coating of a corroded surface of a base material coated with an anticorrosive coating film. Namely, local corrosion of a stainless steel base material can be prevented by forming an anticorrosive coating  film on a welded<br>
part or a crevice,  and by acting as an adhesive between the coating film  surface  and  a  stainless   steel  plate,   it  can  prevent  local corrosion    stably     for     a     long     time     and    provide     excellent anticorrosive  properties. [0070]<br>
Specifically, repairs of a stainless steel base material can be carried out, for example, by applying the epoxy resin composition of the present invention on the surface of a stainless steel base material having a welded part (weld line) or crevice, and bonding a stainless steel plate on the surface of the coating film before curing. The epoxy resin composition of the present invention may be further coated thereon. [0071]<br>
Such a repair method can be applied without limitation to any structure made of stainless steel and is specifically applied to a water storage vessel, a water storage tank, a nuclear fuel waste storage pool and the like. As local corrosion tends to occur particularly if the nuclear fuel waste storage pool has a welded part (weld line) or a crevice on the surface of the base material inside the storage pool, application of the repair method using the epoxy resin composition of the present invention is effective. [0072]<br>
When  the  coating  composition  of  the  present  invention  is<br>
applied, dried and cured, for example, it is inferred that ring opening of an epoxy group in the epoxy resin contained in the main component (A) occurs, and that the epoxy oxygen (0) is converted into a hydroxyl group (-0H), while the terminal carbon atom of the molecule forming the epoxy group reacts with an amino group (-NH2) of the curing agent to form (-NH-) bond, or the like, thereby bonding  to  the   curing   agent.<br>
EXAMPLES [0073]<br>
The suitable embodiments of the present invention will be explained in further detail with reference to examples. However, the present invention is by no means restricted by these examples. [0074]<br>
[Preparation of the main component, the curing component and  the  coating  composition]<br>
The  coating  compositions  used  in  the  Examples  1  to  2,   and the Comparative Examples  1 to 6 were prepared as  follows according to  the   compositions   shown  in  Table   2. [0075]<br>
First, all the constituents of the main component, that is, the resin, the pigment, the additives and the solvent were charged into a polyethylene container of  1  L volume and dispersed<br>
for 1 to 2 hours using a paint shaker with glass Deads. Then the constituents of the curing component, namely the resin and the solvent were charged in a 1 Kg can and dispersed using a table agitator. Subsequently, the main component and the curing component were mixed, followed by addition of an appropriate amount of a thinner for epoxy compound (trade name: EPICON T-500 thinner) to prepare the coating composition. [0076]<br>
[Preparation  of  a  test   plate]<br>
A  sand  blasted  steel  plate  of  2 . 3  mm  x  70  mm  x  150  mm  in size made  of  SS400   (surface  roughness:  40  to  75  µm)  was prepared.<br>
The coating composition prepared as described above was coated twice (once a day) on the surface of this steel plate using an air spray so that dry thickness of each coated film is 125 µm. After the plate was kept for drying at 23°C for 10 days, the painted steel plate obtained (test plate) was subjected to a test for evaluating  various  properties   of  the  coating  film.<br>
The  test  results  were  shown  in  Table  2,   the  test  methods and   the   details   of   evaluation   criteria   are   shown   in   Table   3 (remarks   14   to  20   in  Table  2). [0077]<br>
