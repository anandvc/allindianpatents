Since the diazabicyclooctane ring systems contain an<br>
asymmetric carbon atom, the compounds of the invention<br>
 may exist in the form of pure enantiomers or of<br>
mixtures of enantiomers. The enantiomers may be<br>
separated by methods known to the skilled person, such<br>
as separation by fractional crystallization of<br>
diastereoisomeric salts of chiral acids, or separation<br>
  by chromatography on a chiral support.<br>
In accordance with the invention the compounds of<br>
general formula (I) may be prepared by a process which<br>
is illustrated by scheme 1 below.<br>
 1,4-Diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octane of formula (II) is<br>
reacted with a compound of general formula (III) in<br>
which X, P, Q, R, W and Ri are as defined above in the<br>
presence of a coupling agent such as, for example,<br>
N/W-carbonyldiimidazole  in  a  solvent  such  as<br>
 dimethylformamide. The carboxylic acid function present<br>
on the compound of general formula (III) may also be<br>
converted,  in a prior step,  into an acid chloride<br>
   function, in order to react with the 1,4-diazabicyclo<br>
 [3.2.1]octane in a solvent such as dichloroethane.<br><br><br>
Alternatively the compounds of general formula (I) may<br>
be prepared by a process which is illustrated by scheme<br>
2 below.<br>
1,4-Diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octane  of  formula   (II)   is<br>
 reacted with a compound of general formula (IV) in<br>
which X, P, Q, R, W and Ri are as defined above and Z<br>
represents a bromine or iodine atom in the presence of<br>
carbon monoxide and a palladium catalyst such as, for<br>
example,  bis(triphenylphosphino)dichloropalladium  and<br>
  of a base such as, for example, triethylamine in a<br>
   solvent such as, for example, dimethylformamide.<br><br><br>
 The compounds of general formula (III) are available<br>
commercially or are accessible by methods described in<br>
the literature, as for example in Can.    J.    Chem.    1988,<br>
66, 420-8.<br>
The compounds of general formula (IV) are available<br>
  commercially or are accessible by methods described in<br>
the literature, as for example in J.   Het.    Chem.   1983,<br>
475.<br>
The  preparation  of  1,4-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octane  is<br>
described in J.   Med.   Chem.   1977, 20, 1333.<br><br>
The examples below illustrate in detail the preparation<br>
of a number of compounds according to the invention.<br>
The elemental microanalyses and the IR and NMR spectra<br>
confirm the structures of the compounds obtained. The<br>
 numbers of the compounds indicated between parentheses<br>
in the titles correspond to those of the table given<br>
later on. In the names of the compounds, the hyphen "-"<br>
forms part of the word, and the underscore mark "_"<br>
serves merely to indicate the line break; it should be<br>
  deleted in the absence of a break, and should not be<br>
   replaced with either a normal hyphen or a space.<br><br>
Example 1 (Compound No. 2).<br>
3-(1,4-Diazabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-4-ylcarbonyl)-ltf-indazole<br>
hydrochloride 1:1.<br>
 A 50 ml reactor is charged with 0.165 g (1.02 mmol) of<br>
 1H-indazole-3-carboxylic  acid  and  1 ml  of  thionyl<br>
chloride and the mixture is heated at reflux for 1 h<br>
  min and concentrated under reduced pressure. Then<br>
 1.2 ml  of pyridine and 0.30 g  (2.67 mmol)  of  1,4-<br>
 diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octane are added and the mixture is<br>
heated at reflux for 1 h 30 min.<br>
The solvent is evaporated off under reduced pressure<br>
and the residue is taken up in 1 ml of chloroform and<br>
purified by chromatography on a silica gel column,<br>
 eluting with a 70/30/3 mixture of ethyl acetate,<br>
methanol and aqueous ammonia.<br>
This gives 0.16 g of product, which is dissolved in<br>
10 ml of acetone before addition of 0.47 ml of a 5N<br>
solution of hydrochloric acid in isopropyl alcohol. The<br>
 crystals obtained (0.17 g) are collected by filtration<br>
and dried under reduced pressure.<br>
Melting point: 286-287°C.<br>
Example 2 (Compound No. 3)<br>
  6-Chloro-3-(1,4-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-4-ylcarbonyl)-<br>
1H-indazole hydrobromide 1:1.<br>
A 10 ml reactor is charged in succession with 0.25 g<br>
(0.9 mmol)   of   3-iodo-6-chloro-lff-indazole,   0.09 g<br>
 (0.13 mmol) of bis(triphenylphosphino)-dichloro-<br>
palladium, 0.25 g (2.24 mmol) of 1,4-diazabicyclo<br>
[3.2.1]octane and 0.31 ml (2.24 mmol) of triethylamine<br>
in solution in 1 ml of dimethylformamide. The mixture<br>
is subsequently purged with carbon monoxide and heated<br>
  at 70°C for 8 h. The reaction mixture is poured into<br>
10 ml of saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution<br>
and the aqueous phase is extracted with chloroform. The<br>
    organic phases are dried,  filtered and concentrated<br>
   inder reduced pressure.  The residue is purified by<br><br>
chromatography on a silica gel column, eluting with a<br>
90/10/1 mixture of chloroform, methanol and aqueous<br>
ammonia.<br>
This gives 0.2 g of product, which is dissolved in 1 ml<br>
 of isopropyl alcohol before addition of 0.13 ml of a 5N<br>
solution of hydrochloric acid in isopropyl alcohol.<br>
The  crystals  obtained  (0.076 g)  are  collected  by<br>
filtration and dried under reduced pressure.<br>
Melting point: 285-286°C.<br><br><br>
Example 3 (Compound No. 1).<br>
3-(1,4-Diazabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-4-ylcarbonyl)-6-methyl-<br>
1H-pyrazolo [3, 4-b] pyridine hydrobromide 2:1.<br>
  By analogy with Example 2, 0.7 g (3.3 mmol) of 3-bromo-<br>
6-methyl-lH-pyrazolo [3,4-jb]pyridine  is  reacted  with<br>
 1.1 g  (9.9 mmol)  of 1,4-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octane in<br>
the   presence   of   0.35 g   (0.5 mmol)   of   bis<br>
(triphenylphosphino)dichloropalladium  and  2.3 ml  of<br>
  triethylamine in 10 ml of dimethylformamide under the<br>
conditions described for Example 1, giving 0.21 g of<br>
product, which is dissolved in 20 ml of acetone before<br>
addition of 0.27 ml of a 5.7 N solution of hydrobromic<br>
 acid in acetic acid. The dihydrobromide crystals are<br>
  collected by filtration and dried under vacuum,<br>
Melting point: 290-291°C.<br>
Example 4 (Compound No. 4).<br>
  3— (1, 4-Diazabicyclo [3.2.1] oct-4-ylcarbonyl) -5-fluoro-<br>
  lH-indazole hydrobromide 2:1.<br>
By analogy with Example 2, 0.23 g (0.88 mmol) of 3-<br>
iodo-5-fluoro-lfl-indazole  is  reacted  with  0.25 g<br>
  (2.19 mmol)  of  1, 4-diazabicyclo [3. 2 .1] octane  in  the<br>
presence of 0.092 g (0.13 mmol) of bis(triphenylphos-<br>
      phino)dichloropalladium and 0.3 ml of triethylamine in<br>
      1 ml  of  dimethylformamide  under  the  conditions<br>
     described for Example 2. This gives 0.136 g of product,<br><br><br>
which is dissolved in 20 ml of acetone before addition<br>
 of  0.18 ml of a 5.7 N solution of hydrobromic acid in<br>
acetic acid. The hydrobromide crystals are collected by<br>
filtration and dried under vacuum.<br>
 Melting point: 283-284°C.<br>

The compounds of the invention were subjected to<br>
pharmacological tests, which demonstrated their<br>
 advantage as active substances of medicaments.<br>
For instance, they were studied with regard to their<br>
affinity for nicotinic receptors containing the α 4β 2<br>
subunit in accordance with the methods described by<br>
  Anderson and Arneric in Eur.    J.    Pharmacol.    1994, 253,<br>
261 and by Hall et al. in Brain Res.   1993, 600, 127.<br>
Male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 150 to 200 g are<br>
decapitated and the whole brain is removed rapidly,<br>
homogenized in 15 volumes of 0.32 M sucrose solution at<br>
 4 °C and then centrifuged at 1000 G for 10 min. The<br>
pellet is discarded and the supernatant is centrifuged<br>
at 20 000 G at 4°C for 20 min. The pellet is recovered<br>
and homogenized using a Polytron™ mill in 15 volumes of<br>
double-distilled water at 4°C,  then centrifuged at<br>
  8000 G for 20 min. The pellet is discarded and the<br>
supernatant and the layer of skin (buffy coat)  are<br>
   centrifuged at 40 000 G for 20 min, and the pellet is<br>
   recovered,  resuspended in 15 ml of double-distilled<br>
  water and centrifuged again at 40 000 G, before being<br><br>
stored at -80°C.<br>
On the day of the experiment the tissue is slowly-<br>
thawed and is suspended in 3 volumes of buffer. 150 p. 1<br>
of this membrane suspension are incubated at 4°C for<br>
 120 min in the presence of 100 \i 1 of 1 nM [3H] -cytisine<br>
in a final volume of 500 |l 1 of buffer, in the presence<br>
or absence of test compound. The reaction is stopped by<br>
filtration on Whatman GF/B™ filters pretreated with<br>
polyethyleneimine, the filters are rinsed with twice<br>
 5 ml of buffer at 4°C and the radioactivity retained on<br>
the filter is measured by liquid scintigraphy. The non-<br>
specific binding is determined in the presence of 10 n M<br>
 (-)-nicotine; the nonspecific binding represents 75% to<br>
85% of the total binding recovered on the filter. For<br>
 each concentration of compound studied, the percentage<br>
inhibition of the specific binding of [3H]-cytisine is<br>
determined, after which the IC50 is calculated, which is<br>
the concentration of compound that inhibits 50% of the<br>
specific binding.<br>
 The IC50 values of the compounds of the invention having<br>
the greatest affinity are situated between 1 and 10 µ M.<br>
The compounds of the invention were also studied with<br>
regard  to  their  affinity  for  nicotinic  receptors<br>
	 containing the α7 subunit,  in accordance with the<br>
methods described by Mark and Collins in J. Pharmacol.<br>
Exp.    Ther.    1982, 22, 564 and by Marks et al. in Mol.<br>
Pharmacol.   1986, 30, 427.<br>
Male OFA rats weighing 150 to 200 g are decapitated,<br>
 the whole brain is removed rapidly and is homogenized<br>
using a Polytron™ mill in 15 volumes of 0.32 M sucrose<br>
solution at 4°C, then centrifuged at 1000 G for 10 min.<br>
The pellet is discarded and the supernatant is<br>
centrifuged at 8000 G at 4°C for 20 min. The pellet is<br>
  recovered and is homogenized using a Polytron™ mill in<br>
15 volumes of double-distilled water at 4°C,  then<br>
centrifuged  at  8000 G  for  20 min.  The  pellet  is<br>
    discarded and the supernatant and layer of skin (buffy<br>
    coat)  are centrifuged at 40 000 G for 20 min.  The<br><br><br>
pellet is recovered and resuspended in 15 volumes of<br>
double-distilled water at 4°C and is centrifuged again<br>
at 40 000 G for 20 min, before being stored at -80°C.<br>
On the day of the experiment, the tissue is slowly<br>
 thawed and is suspended in 5 volumes of buffer. 150 µ 1<br>
of this membrane suspension are preincubated at 37°C<br>
for 30 min, in the dark, in the presence or absence of<br>
the test compound. The membranes are then incubated at<br>
37°C for 60 min, in the dark, in the presence of 50 µ 1<br>
 of 1 nM [3H]-α -bungarotoxin in a final volume of<br>
250 µ 1 of 20 mM HEPES, 0.05% polyethyleneimine buffer.<br>
The reaction is stopped by filtration on Whatman GF/C™<br>
filters pretreated for 3 h with 0.05% polyethylene-<br>
imine. The filters are rinsed with two times 5 ml of<br>
  buffer at 4°C and the radioactivity retained on each<br>
filter is measured by liquid scintigraphy. The<br>
nonspecific binding in the presence of a -bungarotoxin<br>
at 1 µ M final is measured; the nonspecific binding<br>
represents  approximately  60%  of  the  total  binding<br>
 recovered on the filter. For each concentration of<br>
compound studied, the percentage inhibition of the<br>
specific binding of [3H]-a -bungarotoxin is measured and<br>
then the IC50 is calculated, the concentration of<br>
compound that inhibits 50% of the specific binding.<br>
  The IC50 values of the compounds of the invention which<br>
have the greatest affinity are situated between 0.010<br>
and 0.10 |iM.<br>
The IC50 values of some specific compounds are indicated<br>
 in the table below.<br><br>
The above results show that the compounds of the<br>
invention are selective ligands for the α 7 subunits of<br>
  the nicotinic receptor.<br><br>
The results of the various tests suggest the use of the<br>
compounds in the treatment or prevention of disorders<br>
associated with dysfunction of the nicotinic receptors,<br>
 particularly within the central nervous system.<br>
These disorders include cognitive impairment, more<br>
specifically memory impairment, but also attention<br>
impairment,  which  are  associated  with  Alzheimer's<br>
  disease,  pathological  aging  (Age Associated Memory<br>
Impairment,  AAMI),  Parkinson's  disease,  trisomy  21<br>
(Down's syndrome), Korsakoff's alcoholic syndrome, and<br>
vascular dementia (multi-infarct dementia, MDI).<br>
The compounds of the invention might also be useful in<br>
 the  treatment  of  motor  disorders  observed  in<br>
Parkinson's disease or other neurological diseases,<br>
such  as  Huntington's  chorea,  Tourette's  syndrome,<br>
tardive dyskinesia, and hyperkinesias.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also constitute a<br>
  curative or symptomatic treatment for cerebrovascular<br>
accidents and cerebral hypoxic episodes. They may be<br>
used   in   cases   of   psychiatric   pathologies:<br>
schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, panic attacks, and<br>
obsessive compulsive behaviors.<br>
  They may prevent the symptoms caused by withdrawal from<br>
 tobacco, from alcohol, and from various substances that<br>
induce a dependency, such as cocaine, LSD, cannabis and<br>
benzodiazepines.<br>
  furthermore, the compounds of the invention may also be<br>
used for the treatment of lower limb ischemia,<br>
obliterative arteritis of the lower limbs (PAD:<br>
peripheral arterial disease) , cardiac ischemia (stable<br>
angina), myocardial infarction, cardiac insufficiency,<br>
  5cutaneous cicatrization deficiency in diabetic<br>
patients, and varicose ulcers of venous insufficiency.<br>
     For each of the aforementioned pathologies, treatment<br>
    may be performed with the nicotinic agent alone and/or<br><br>
in combination with the reference medicaments indicated<br>
in the pathology.<br>
Consequently the present invention additionally<br>
 provides pharmaceutical compositions containing an<br>
effective dose of at least one compound according to<br>
the invention, in base form or in the form of a salt or<br>
solvate which is pharmaceutically acceptable, and in a<br>
mixture, where appropriate, with suitable excipients.<br><br>
The said excipients are selected according to the<br>
pharmaceutical form and mode of administration desired.<br>
The  pharmaceutical  compositions  according  to  the<br>
 invention may thus be intended for oral, sublingual,<br>
  subcutaneous,   intramuscular,   intravenous,   topical,<br>
intratracheal,  intranasal,  transdermal,  rectal  or<br>
intraocular administration.<br>
 The unit forms of administration may be, for example,<br>
tablets, gel capsules, granules, powders, oral or<br>
injectable solutions or suspensions, transdermal<br>
patches, or suppositories. For topical administration<br>
consideration may be given to ointments, lotions, and<br>
  eyedrops.<br>
The  said unit  forms  are  dosed to  allow a  daily<br>
administration of 0.01 to 20 mg of active principle per<br>
kg of bodyweight, depending on the pharmaceutical form.<br><br>
To prepare tablets, the active principle, in micronized<br>
form or otherwise, is admixed with a pharmaceutical<br>
vehicle, which may be composed of diluents, such as,<br>
for  example,  lactose,  microcrystalline  cellulose,<br>
  starch,  and  formulation adjuvants  such  as  binders<br>
(polyvinylpyrrolidone,    hydroxypropylmethylcellulose,<br>
     etc.), glidants, such as silica, lubricants, such as<br>
     magnesium stearate, stearic acid, glycerol tribehenate,<br>
    and  sodium  stearylfumarate.   Wetting  agents  or<br><br>
surfactants such as sodium lauryl sulfate may also be<br>
added.<br>
The production techniques may be direct tableting, dry<br>
 granulation, wet granulation or hot melting.<br>
The tablets may be plain, coated, for example with<br>
sucrose, or enveloped with various polymers or other<br>
appropriate materials. They may be designed in order to<br>
allow rapid, delayed or sustained release of the active<br>
 principle by virtue of polymeric matrices or of<br>
specific polymers used in the covering.<br>
To prepare gel capsules, the active principle is mixed<br>
with dry pharmaceutical vehicles (simple mixing, dry or<br>
  wet granulation, or hot melting) , or with liquid or<br>
 semisolid pharmaceutical vehicles.<br>
The gel capsules may be hard or soft, and may be film-<br>
coated or not, so as to exhibit rapid, sustained or<br>
delayed activity (for an enteric form, for example).<br><br>
A composition in the form of a syrup or elixir or for<br>
administration in the form of drops may contain the<br>
active principle together with a sweetener, preferably<br>
a    calorie-free    sweetener,    methylparaben    or<br>
 propylparaben as an antiseptic, a flavor enhancer, and<br>
a dye.<br>
Water-dispersible granules and powders may contain the<br>
active principle mixed with dispersants or wetting<br>
 agents, or with dispersants such as<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, and also with sweeteners and<br>
taste corrigents.<br>
For rectal administration, suppositories are employed<br>
  which are prepared with binders that melt at the rectal<br>
temperature, such as cocoabutter or polyethylene<br>
glycols, for example.<br><br>
         For   parenteral   administration,    use   is   made   of   aqueous<br><br>
suspensions, isotonic saline solutions or sterile<br>
injectable solutions containing pharmacologically<br>
compatible dispersants and/or wetting agents, such as<br>
propylene glycol or butylene glycol, for example.<br><br>
The active principle may also be formulated in the form<br>
of microcapsules, where appropriate with one or more<br>
vehicles or additives, or else with a polymeric matrix<br>
or with a cyclodextrin (transdermal patches, sustained-<br>
 release forms).<br>
The topical compositions according to the invention<br>
comprise a medium which is compatible with the skin.<br>
They may in particular be in the form of aqueous,<br>
 alcoholic or aqueous-alcoholic solutions, gels, water-<br>
  in-oil or oil-in-water emulsions having the appearance<br>
of a cream or gel, microemulsions or aerosols, or else<br>
in the form of vesicular dispersions containing ionic<br>
and/or nonionic lipids. These pharmaceutical forms are<br>
 prepared according to the usual methods in the fields<br>
under consideration.<br>
Finally, the pharmaceutical compositions according to<br>
the invention may contain, in addition to a compound of<br>
  general formula (I), other active principles which may<br>
be useful in the treatment of the disorders and<br>
diseases indicated above.<br><br>
