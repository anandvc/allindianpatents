				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a boom control device. In particular, the invention<br>
relates to an intelligent boom control device.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Various construction vehicles with boom are widely used. The boom is a device<br>
including at least three boom sections hinged by horizontal joint shafts. Each boom section<br>
can rotate a considerable angle around the joint shafts. Meanwhile, the whole boom is fixed to<br>
a machine frame by rotary platform, which can bring the whole boom to rotate around the<br>
upright axis vertical to the horizontal plane for 360 degree. A typical application of this<br>
boom is to act as construction apparatus, for example to move objects from one spot to another<br>
and hang up them. At present, such boom devices are widely applied to construction site for<br>
concrete placing and other like works.<br>
For example, concrete pump truck with feed spreading boom is a typical construction<br>
vehicle with boom. Such vehicle is applied to concrete placing according to the operating<br>
control requirements at construction sites that need concrete placing. When boom device is<br>
applied for concrete placing and the like, control requirement for the boom device is relatively<br>
strict, especially there is a need to accurately control movement track of boom end.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a boom structure of such concrete pump truck. The structure and control<br>
principle of this boom will be described with reference to Fig. 1 hereinafter.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, a concreter pump truck 8 includes a boom 9, and a machine frame<br>
10 formed of automobile chassis.<br>
In Fig. 1, the boom 9 is composed of five boom sections 12-16 hinged with each other,<br>
and rotary platform 11 driven by hydraulic motor and being rotatable around upright axis 18.<br>
The five boom sections are called first arm 12, second arm 13, third arm 14, fourth arm 15 and<br>
fifth arm 16, each boom section is controlled by a corresponding one of hydraulic oil cylinders<br>
31-35, respectively. The action of which can revolve the respectively controlled boom section<br>
around their respective joint shafts. Meanwhile, the rotary platform 11 may also be driven to<br>
2<br><br>
rotate by hydraulic rotary motor 30 (not shown in Fig. 1, please refer to Fig. 2). During<br>
construction, by means of the movement of operating handle of a remote controller, operator<br>
can control the gesture of the boom and the rotation of the rotary platform so as to move the<br>
boom end 20 having a terminal hose 17 above the area to be placed with concrete. This<br>
terminal hose 17 is connected to a concrete conveying pump, and the concrete is ejected<br>
through terminal hose 17 to implement concrete placing.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the movement control system of the boom shown in Fig. 1 in the prior art.<br>
This system includes a remote controller 40 which can transmit wireless remote control signal,<br>
a receiver 41 fixed to the vehicle, an electrical hydraulic control element, i.e., electric<br>
proportional multi-way valve 52, the hydraulic oil motor 30, and an executive unit 53<br>
composed of the hydraulic oil cylinders 31-35.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the remote controller 40 includes six proportional rockers 42-47<br>
which may be adjusted to and fro along a primary adjustment direction and may transmit<br>
remote control signals in analog quantity for controlling the rotary platform and the respective<br>
boom sections, respectively. The remote control signals are transmitted to the receiver 41 fixed<br>
to the vehicle by radio wave 51 at a certain frequency. The remote controller 40 also includes a<br>
row of other switch mechanisms 48, 49, 49', 49", and when they are operated other related<br>
remote control radio signals are transmitted by radio wave 51 at a certain frequency to radio<br>
receiver 41. When adjusting the working position of the boom end, if an action of a certain<br>
boom section or a rotary action is needed, the control command can be transmitted by<br>
manipulating the corresponding proportional rockers 42-47 forward or backward. After<br>
receiving the radio signals, the receiver 41 outputs PWM driving signals corresponding to<br>
each boom section or the rotary platform to electric proportional multi-way valve 52 so as to<br>
perform control. The electric proportional multi-way valve 52 includes electric proportional<br>
valves 56-60 for driving hydraulic oil cylinders 31-35, respectively; and further includes an<br>
electric proportional valve 55 for driving a two-way oil motor 30. Elongating or shortening the<br>
hydraulic oil cylinders 31-35 makes the corresponding boom sections pivot about the joint<br>
shafts restrictedly. A rotation of the oil motor 30 can make the whole boom 9 rotate around the<br>
3<br><br>
upright axis 18 by a deceleration mechanism.<br>
The above-described is a typical manner for implementing the action of a single<br>
section boom. This embodiment does not require a boom measuring and sensing system as<br>
well as a coordinate transformation system supported by computer, however, it cause<br>
complicated operation. For example, if assuming in Fig. 1 that terminal hose 17 needs to be<br>
moved from the position shown in the figure to position A without changing the height of the<br>
boom end 20, the operator has to move at least two or more boom sections. Therefore, operator<br>
needs to control two of the rockers 43-47 to move the hose 17 from the position shown in the<br>
figure to point A without changing the height. However, to accomplish this operation quickly,<br>
even an experienced operator can hardly keep the height of the boom end 20 during the<br>
process of movement.<br>
In the prior art, a number of technical solutions to implement automatic control of the<br>
boom movement using automatic control technology have been proposed to solve the<br>
above-described problem of moving multi-sections boom without changing its operation<br>
height. These technique solutions implement a simply and easy control of the boom by means<br>
of a boom measuring and sensing system as well as a coordinate transformation system<br>
supported by computer.<br>
For example, German Patent No. DE-A-4306127 (see also US patent 6862509) owned<br>
by Putzmeister Company regarding boom operating device provides a boom operating device<br>
on which a cylinder (polar) coordinate system is defined, the cylinder coordinate system has<br>
three coordinate axes: ψٱr and h (refer to Fig. 1). The three coordinate axes correspond to<br>
boom rotation(ψ), boom elongating or shortening (r) and boom height lifting and lowering (h).<br>
In the patent owned by Putzmeister Company, a rocker having three primary<br>
adjustment directions is used to implement the control according to three directions of the<br>
cylinder coordinate mode defined above. Each primary adjustment direction of the rocker<br>
corresponds to one coordinate axis. When an operator controls the rocker to move, a signal<br>
corresponding to the related coordinate axis is generated according to the moving direction of<br>
the rocker, and through a computation of a computer, control components corresponding to the<br>
4<br><br>
relative rotation of respective boom sections and the rotation of the whole boom are generated<br>
so that the boom can be controlled to move in the defined coordinate system according to the<br>
action of the rocker. The control components at the three coordinate axes can also be combined<br>
so that an operating/control action can transmit control signals regarding more than two<br>
coordinate axes direction to implement control of the boom end in a simple but accurate way,<br>
especially control of the coordinate axes parallel to the horizontal plane.<br>
In the intelligent boom control device provided in the above-described patent, the<br>
coordinate system defined therein is of great intuitionistic so that it is very convenient for an<br>
operator to move the boom end from one position to another in the space.<br>
However, the intelligent boom control device described above still has obvious<br>
drawback.<br>
As for a typical boom application such as concrete pump truck, when placing concrete,<br>
how to move the boom end from one space position to another space position is only one of<br>
the concerned problems, moreover it is needed to accurately control the movement track of the<br>
boom end, so that the correct placing execution be implemented.<br>
During the placing execution, placing along the direction of straight lines<br>
perpendicular to each other is the typical placing method. In this placing method the<br>
movement track of the boom end is required to be straight line.<br>
In the cylinder coordinate mode provided in the prior art, the movement track of the<br>
boom end is usually an arc line rather than a straight line because of the adaptation of the<br>
rotation axis. Please refer to Fig. 3, this figure shows a formation process of the movement<br>
track accomplishing the movement from point A in a plane to point D in the same plane in the<br>
cylinder coordinate mode described above. In this example, it assumes that movement in the<br>
direction of height axis h is not required, i.e. the movement from point A to point D is at the<br>
same height.<br>
Fig. 3a shows projection of initial position of the boom to the horizontal plane. At this<br>
time, the boom end N is at point A in the cylinder coordinate plane with rotary platform as<br>
origin O. The present operating requirement is shown in Fig. 3b, i.e. moving   the boom end N<br>
5<br><br>
from current coordinate point A to point D, the required track is a length of straight line from<br>
point A to point D shown in Fig. 3b. However, in the cylinder coordinate mode, actual track of<br>
the boom end N is not a straight line.<br>
Please refer to Fig. 3c, this figure shows a track of the boom end in the cylinder<br>
coordinate mode. In the present cylinder coordinate mode, the movement track of the boom<br>
end is decomposed to the ψ axis movement and r axis movement. Decomposing the<br>
movement in this manner, the boom end N will rotate about the ψ axis in the axis direction,<br>
and move on the r axis, i.e., the straight line in the elongating direction MN of the boom at the<br>
same time. In the original state, the end N of the boom MN coincides with point A, i.e. the<br>
projection of the boom MN to the horizontal plane is OA; the projection of the boom to plane<br>
is OB at next time unit because the boom rotates and elongates at the same time during its<br>
movement. Similarly, the projection of the boom to plane is OC at further next time unit, and<br>
the projection of the boom to plane is OD when moving to the terminal target position D. In<br>
this way, the track of the projection of the boom end N on the plane is a length of polygonal<br>
line from point A to point D. This line is a track formed from only few points at time units. In<br>
fact, the track of the boom end N from point A to point D is a length of arc with increasing<br>
radius. Such movement track doesn't have negative effect on general construction operating.<br>
However, in the case of cement placing and the like where control requirement for movement<br>
track of the boom end N is relatively high, the above movement track can't satisfy the<br>
operating requirement.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides an intelligent boom control device which can move a<br>
boom end from one position to another along a straight line track and therefore satisfy the<br>
requirement of the construction where the movement track of the boom end must be a straight<br>
line.<br>
The present invention provides an intelligent boom control device, the boom being<br>
hinged to a rotary platform rotatable around an upright axis fixed to a machine frame, and the<br>
6<br><br>

respectively; wherein a plane defined by the plane rectangular coordinate system consisted of<br>
X axis and Y axis is parallel to the horizontal plane; the Z axis always regards the up direction<br>
vertical to the horizontal plane as the positive direction;<br>

Hereafter, an embodiment of the intelligent boom control device provided in the<br>
invention will be described referring the boom structure of the concrete pump truck shown in<br>
Fig. 1. The boom structure of the concrete pump truck has been described in the background<br>
art, and will not be described again herein. Because the key problem solved by the present<br>
invention is the control of a boom moving in a horizontal plane, the following description will<br>
mainly focus on the movement control of the boom in a horizontal plane. Control of the boom<br>
lifting and lowering in vertical direction will not be described in detail herein because it is<br>
simpler than the movement control in a horizontal plane.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a principle block diagram of an intelligent boom control device according<br>
to the first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, this intelligent boom control device includes a remote controller 70,<br>
a receiver 82 fixed to a concrete pump truck, an angle measurement unit 89, and a control unit<br>
90.<br>
The remote controller 70 includes five proportional rockers 71-75, wherein each of the<br>
proportional rockers 71-74 has a primary direction which can be adjusted forward or backward,<br>
and the proportional rocker 75 has two primary directions in which it can be adjusted by<br>
13<br><br>
fore-and-aft movement and left-and-right movement, respectively, to transmit control signal.<br>
Further, the remote controller 70 has an operating mode selection switch 77, which is designed<br>
as a self-lock selection switch with three steps corresponding to different operating modes<br>
including manual operating mode, cylinder coordinate mode and rectangular coordinate mode.<br>
In addition, this remote controller 70 has a few of other control mechanism. A control signal<br>
generated by operating the control mechanism such as the proportional rockers<br>
correspondingly generates a wireless remote control signal 83 and then transmits it.<br>
The receiver 82 is fixed to a concrete pump truck for receiving the wireless remote<br>
control signal 83 transmitted from the remote controller 70, converting it to control data flow<br>
which is then transmitted to control unit 90 via a CAN (Controller Area Network) data bus 85.<br>
Since many control signals are to be transferred, CAN bus is adopted for information<br>
transmission, which on one hand effectively reduce the signal attenuation due to the length of<br>
electrical wire and on the other hand reduce the weight of the electrical wire harness.<br>
The angle measurement unit 89 includes six angle sensors 88 for measuring the angles<br>
between the respective boom sections, angle between the first arm and machine frame as well<br>
as the rotation angle of the rotary platform deviating from the center position where the boom<br>
is rested when retracted, and transferring the above measured values of the angles to the<br>
control unit 90.<br>
Fig. 4 further shows an electric proportional multi-way valve 52 and an actuating unit<br>
53, function and configuration of which are the same as those illustrated in Fig. 2 and<br>
described in the background art. Identical elements are denoted by same reference numeral<br>
and will not be described again.<br>
The control unit 90 receives the control data flow transmitted from the receiver 82 and<br>
the measured valve of angle transmitted from the angle measurement unit 89 via the CAN data<br>
bus 85, then carries out a calculation based on the above data to generate driving voltage for<br>
controlling the oil motor and the oil cylinders in the actuating unit 53. This control unit 90<br>
converts the control commands into driving voltage, which is crucial for the boom to move in<br>
accordance with expected movement track.<br>
14<br><br>
The control unit 90 includes the following subunit: a command parameter<br>
decomposing unit 91, an actual position calculating unit 92, a movement planning unit 93, a<br>
flow control unit 94 and a PWM (pulse width modulation) voltage output unit 95. Subunits<br>
included in the control unit 90 may be embodied either as software modules or hardware<br>
modules.<br>
The command parameter decomposing unit 91 receives the control data flow<br>
transmitted via bus 85, and decomposes it to recognizable command codes which correspond<br>
to positions of the control mechanisms such as the selection switches and the rocker on the<br>
remote controller 70. Command codes related to the technical problem solved by the present<br>
invention includes operating mode, inclining direction and pushing amount of the rocker of<br>
the remote controller, teaching and clear command, as well as other command codes including<br>
the lock state of the boom and the rotary platform. In fact the inclining direction and pushing<br>
amount of the rocker represent movement control commands such as movement direction and<br>
speed of the boom end. Under the polar coordinate or rectangular coordinate mode, the<br>
command parameter decomposing unit 91 recognizes the real-time data transmitted from the<br>
remote controller 70 and decomposes them into various command codes described above, then<br>
transmits the codes to the movement planning unit 93 as input parameters of the movement<br>
planning unit 93. In manual operating mode, the operating command for a certain boom<br>
section is directly transmitted to the PWM voltage output unit 95.<br>
The actual positions calculating units 92 is used to receive the data of measured value<br>
of angles output from the angle measurement unit 89 via the CAN data bus 85, and calculate<br>
the actual position information of the boom 9 according to said calculated data. The position<br>
information comprises the information regarding strokes of the hydraulic oil cylinders 31-35<br>
and position coordinate of each boom section end including the boom end, which is calculated<br>
according to the relationship between sides and angles of an arbitrary quadrangle after<br>
movement angle of each boom section is obtained, and the calculating result is transmit to the<br>
movement planning unit 93.<br>
The movement planning unit 93 is used to receive the command code outputted from<br>
15<br><br>
the command parameter decomposing unit 91 and the actual position information of the boom<br>
9 calculated by the actual position calculating unit 92 and comprising the actual position of<br>
each boom section end to calculated target position. The coordinates of the target position is<br>
obtained by adding a preset steplength 20 in the movement direction indicated by movement<br>
control command from the proportional rocker to the current position of the boom end. Based<br>
on the target position, the locking state between each boom section of the boom 9 and the<br>
rotary platform 11, and the current position of each boom section of the boom 9 and the rotary<br>
platform 11, the direction and the amount of movement of each boom section of the boom 9<br>
and the rotary platform 11 required to obtained next desired movement track is calculated. The<br>
movement planning unit 93 may need to plan the movement under the following limiting<br>
conditions including: the first arm 12 is locked, the first and second arms 12 and 13 are locked,<br>
the rotary platform 11 is locked, none of the boom sections of the boom 9 is locked, and the<br>
rotary platform is involved in the control in the rectangular coordinate. The result calculated<br>
by the movement planning unit 93 is outputted to the flow control unit 94. The movement<br>
planning unit 93 functions as determining the movement direction and track of the boom end<br>
20 and decomposing the movement of the boom end 20 into the movement the boom sections<br>
12-16 and the rotary platform 11. The movement direction and track of the boom end 20 is<br>
determined according to the movement control command transmitted by the operator via the<br>
remote controller 70 and the current operating mode of the control device. The movement<br>
planning obtained by the movement planning unit 93 should guarantee desired movement of<br>
the boom, for example, movement of the boom end 20 in a plane parallel to the horizontal<br>
plane.<br>
The flow control unit 94 is used to receive the movement planning outputted from the<br>
movement planning unit and judge the reasonableness of the movement planning. If it is<br>
judged that the movement planning is reasonable and feasible, the movement planning will be<br>
used as the basis on which the hydraulic oil flow distribution of the actuating mechanisms for<br>
each boom section and the rotary platform is controlled, whereby the flow control unit 94<br>
outputs a command voltage or command current for each movement mechanism. Said<br>
16<br><br>
command voltage or command current determines opening amount and direction of each<br>
control valve in the electric proportional multi-way valve 52. Thereby, the direction and mount<br>
of the flow of the hydraulic oil distributed into the oil cylinder of each boom section and the<br>
oil motor of the rotary platform are further determined. The direction of the flow determines<br>
whether the oil cylinder elongate or shorten and whether the oil motor will normally rotate or<br>
reversely rotate, while the mount of the flow determines the moving speed of the oil cylinder<br>
and the rotary platform. The cooperating between the each boom section and the rotary<br>
platform determines the movement track of the boom end. Judging whether the movement<br>
planning is reasonable comprises judging whether the sum of the oil supply for each actuating<br>
element does not exceed the maximum valve of the total oil supply, to avoid the case where the<br>
desired movement cannot be realized. If the oil supply exceeds the maximum valve of the total<br>
oil supply, the flow control unit 94 may reduce the oil supply for each actuating element by a<br>
same proportion to realize the normal drive. Judging whether the movement planning is<br>
reasonable further comprises judging the movement continuity of each boom section and the<br>
rotary platform 11 with respect to the current position. The term "continuity" means that there<br>
is no break in the movement of each boom section and the rotary platform 11 with respect to<br>
the current position, i.e., there is no excessive movement variation between adjacent time<br>
periods to avoid uneven movement. If it is judged that the movement satisfies the continuity<br>
requirement, the movement planning is reasonable; if it is judged that the movement does not<br>
satisfy the continuity requirement, the movement planning is unreasonable. The moving speed<br>
of the boom end 20 is kept corresponding to the pushing amount of the proportional rocker by<br>
means of the flow control unit 94, i.e., the speed is slow when the pushing amount is small and<br>
the speed is fast when the pushing amount is great. Further, the flow control unit 94 may<br>
obtain the actual position of the boom based on the measured valve of the actual position of<br>
the boom, and thus obtain the actual movement track of the boom end, whereby adjust the<br>
command voltage or the command current to implement servo control. Furthermore, the flow<br>
control unit 94 may also obtain the moving speed of the boom end 20 based on the position<br>
change of the boom per time unit, whereby adjust the command voltage or the command<br>
17<br><br>
current to implement synchronous control of the boom.<br>
By mean of said movement planning unit 93 and said flow control unit 94, the<br>
movement under cylinder coordinate mode and rectangular coordinate mode may be carried<br>
out with cooperation of the boom sections and the rotary platform.<br>
The PWM voltage output unit 95 is used to receive the command voltage or command<br>
current for each boom section as well as the rotary platform 11 outputted from the flow control<br>
unit 94, or directly receive the command parameters outputted from the command parameter<br>
decomposing unit 91, and generate PWM driving voltage or current for driving the electric<br>
proportional valves 56-60 according to the command so as to drive and control the electric<br>
proportional valves 55-60 and thus control the elongating or shortening of the hydraulic oil<br>
cylinders 31-35 as well as the rotation of the hydraulic motor 30. The elongating or shortening<br>
of the hydraulic oil cylinders 31-35 causes involved boom sections to pivot about joint shafts,<br>
and the rotation of the hydraulic motor 30 also causes the whole boom 9 to rotate about the<br>
upright axis 18 by means of the reducing mechanism. With the rotation of all boom sections<br>
cooperating with the rotation of the whole boom 9, the boom end 20 follows the movement<br>
track desired by the operator.<br>
The above-mentioned intelligent boom control device has three control modes,<br>
comprising manual control mode, cylinder coordinate control mode and rectangular<br>
coordinate control mode. A control mode is chosen among these three control modes by means<br>
of steps on an operating mode switch 77.<br>
Under the manual control mode, the command parameter decomposing unit 91<br>
decomposes the signals received from proportional rockers into signals corresponding to<br>
components. That is, signals from the proportional rockers 71-74 corresponds to the boom<br>
sections 12-15, a first primary adjustment direction 86 (the rocker being inclined forward or<br>
backward) of the proportional rocker 75 corresponds to the boom section 16, and a second<br>
primary adjustment direction 87 (the rocker being inclined leftward or rightward) of the<br>
proportional rocker 75 corresponds to the rotary platform 11. The decomposed control signals<br>
is transmitted to the PWM signal output unit 95, which generates PWM driving voltage to<br>
18<br><br>
drive the electric proportional multi-way valve 52, through a branch 97. The control function<br>
of the manual control mode is the same as that of the prior art shown in the Fig. 2. The manual<br>
control mode is used in the situation where the linkage operating manner of the boom is not<br>
suitable or there is a failure in the system implementing the linkage operating manner. The<br>
inclining directions of said proportional rockers respectively correspond to the movement<br>
direction of the boom sections or the rotary platform. The pushing amounts of said<br>
proportional rockers respectively correspond to the moving speed of the boom section or the<br>
rotary platform. The greater the pushing amount, the faster the moving speed.<br>
Said cylinder coordinate control mode is substantially the same as that disclosed in the<br>
German Patent Application No. DE-A-4306127 of Putzmeister Company, i.e. the cylinder<br>
coordinate system has three components: ψٱr and h (referring to Fig. 1). This embodiment of<br>
the invention is different from the Putzmeister's solution in that, based on the arrangement of<br>
the operating rocker provided on the remote controller of this embodiment, the adjustment of<br>
component r corresponds to the first primary adjustment direction 86 of the rocker 75, i.e., the<br>
forward or backward inclination of the rocker 75 corresponds to the increase or decrease of the<br>
component r, which is the elongating or shortening movement of the boom, while the height h<br>
of the boom end keeps unchanged. At the same time, the adjustment of component ψ<br>
corresponds to the second primary adjustment direction 87 of the rocker 75, i.e., the leftward<br>
or rightward inclination of the rocker 75 corresponds to the increase or decrease of the<br>
component ψ, which is the clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of the rotary platform. As<br>
2-dimensions movement in the horizontal plane of the adjusting action subdivision, the<br>
adjustments of these two components are combined in the rocker having two primary<br>
adjustment directions. If the inclining angle of the rocker 75 is defined with an angle with<br>
respect to said primary adjustment directions, then both the components r and ψ are effective<br>
on the movement of the boom end, thereby the boom carries out the combination of the<br>
elongating or shortening and the rotation while the height h of the boom end keeps unchanged.<br>
The adjustment of the height h of the boom end is controlled by a separate rocker 71 and is<br>
independent of the movement of the boom end in the horizontal plane. The forward inclination<br>
19<br><br>
of the rocker increases the height h, and the backward inclination decrease the height h. The<br>
above-mentioned functions are realized by the cooperation of the actual position calculating<br>
unit 92, the movement planning unit 93, flow control unit 94, and PWM voltage output unit 95<br>
or the like in the control unit 90.<br>
Under the cylinder coordinate control mode, the movement planning unit 93<br>
determines whether the boom 9 elongates or shortens simply according to the component of<br>
the rocker 75 in forward and backward primary direction, whereby the next movement track of<br>
the boom is calculated. Fig. 3c shows a specific movement track of the boom end in the<br>
cylinder coordinate control mode. As seen from Fig. 3c, the finally formed movement track of<br>
the boom end is a curve.<br>
Under the cylinder coordinate control mode, the movement planning is relatively<br>
simple, because the rotation of the boom only relates to the movement of the rotary platform<br>
11, no corresponding relationship with the coordinate is involved, and no dedicated calculation<br>
is needed. The only thing that needs to be done in the movement planning is to decompose the<br>
extending or retracting movement in r direction into movement of each boom section. No<br>
planning for the rotary platform is needed.<br>
The major disadvantage of the above-mentioned cylinder coordinate control mode has<br>
been described above, i.e., under this cylinder coordinate control mode, whilst it is convenient<br>
to move the boom end from one point to another in a horizontal plane, the movement track<br>
between the two points is a curve. It is impossible to form a straight-line movement from one<br>
point to the other point in the same horizontal plane, unless the boom only extending and<br>
retracting movement in the r direction without the rotation movement. No straight-line<br>
movement can be achieved if rotation is involved.<br>
The rectangular coordinate control mode is a unique operating mode. In respect that<br>
the straight-line movement is the dominant movement manner required in placing execution,<br>
this embodiment designs a brand new rectangular coordinate control mode for the control<br>
device. In this rectangular coordinate control mode, it is possible to accomplish the<br>
straight-line movement from one point to another in a same horizontal plane, i.e. the<br>
20<br><br>
movement track is a straight line. Accordingly, this control mode is particularly suitable for<br>
cement placing in the construction.<br>
This rectangular coordinate control mode introduces orthogonal X-axis and Y-axis,<br>
which are different from the cylinder coordinate components r and ψ, as well as a Z-axis,<br>
which is same as the h axis of the cylinder coordinate and will be not described in detail. As<br>
shown in Fig. 5a, the first primary adjustment direction 86 (forward and backward direction)<br>
of the proportional rocker 75 is defined as longitudinal axis Y, and the second primary<br>
adjustment direction 87 (leftward and right direction) is defined as horizontal axis X. The<br>
definitions determine the relationship between the primary adjustment directions of the rocker<br>
75 and the rectangular coordinate system. When the rocker 75 is inclined toward other<br>
adjusting direction than the primary adjustment directions, components of the adjustment on<br>
the two primary adjustment directions are the movement commands in the X axis and the Y<br>
axis, respectively.<br>
It is very easy to determine the X axis and Y axis directions of the rectangular<br>
coordinate system on the remote controller 70, because the primary adjustment directions of<br>
the rocker 75 are fixed. However, it is very difficult to determine the X axis direction and Y<br>
axis direction of the rectangular coordinate system on the horizontal plane in which the boom<br>
end moves, because it needs a reference system. As desired, this embodiment provides two<br>
manners for determining the rectangular coordinate system in which the boom end moves in<br>
the horizontal plane, i.e., centering manner and teaching manner of the proportional rocker 75.<br>
The centering manner of the proportional rocker 75 means that the rectangular<br>
coordinate system of the movement horizontal plane of the boom is determined according to<br>
the boom position when the proportional rocker 75 is centered. The so-called "center" means<br>
that the proportional rocker 75 is placed in a center position in both primary adjustment<br>
directions.<br>
As mentioned, the movement of the proportional rocker 75 causes a response in the<br>
control device 90. In the case where the rectangular coordinate system is determined in this<br>
centering manner, the control device 90 treats the centering of the proportional rocker 75 as a<br>
21<br><br>
particular event, i.e., regarding the centering of the proportional rocker 75 as a different point<br>
between the two control processes before and after it. When the proportional rocker 75 is<br>
centered, the previous control process ends and the next process starts, and it is required to<br>
establish a new rectangular coordinate system.<br>
The new rectangular coordinate system may be established in the following manner:<br>
when the proportional rocker 75 is centered, the rotary platform is used as origin of the<br>
coordinates and the direction in which the boom is extended is used as the positive direction of<br>
the Y axis. As shown in Fig. 5b, when the proportional rocker 75 is centered, the projection of<br>
the boom in the horizontal plane is MN. When the rocker 75 leaves the centering position for<br>
the next time, the movement coordinate system of the boom, which corresponds to the<br>
coordinate system determined on the proportional rocker 75 shown in fig. 5 a, is established in<br>
the following manner: N is used as origin of the coordinate system, the elongating direction of<br>
the boom is used as Y direction, and the X direction is further determined according to the<br>
determined Y direction. Fig. 5c shows the rectangular coordinate system determined based on<br>
the boom position shown in Fig. 5b.<br>
After the rectangular coordinate system of the proportional rocker 75 and the<br>
rectangular coordinate system of the movement horizontal plane of the boom are determined,<br>
the two rectangular coordinate systems are corresponding to each other, i.e., the inclining<br>
direction of the proportional rocker 75 in its rectangular coordinate system indicates the<br>
direction in which the boom end is to be moved in the rectangular coordinate system of the<br>
movement horizontal plane of the boom.<br>
That the rocker 75 inclines from origin O' of the coordinate to point A' as<br>
shown in Fig. 5d means that the boom end N is required to move from the point A overlapping<br>
with the origin O of the coordinate to the point D and the moving speed of the boom end N is<br>
associated with the pushing amount of the proportional rocker 75. The greater the pushing<br>
amount of the proportional rocker 75 is, the faster the moving speed of the boom end is.<br>
Unlike the cylinder coordinate control mode, under the rectangular coordinate control mode,<br>
the movement track moving from the point A to the point D is decomposed into X axis and Y<br>
22<br><br>
axis of the rectangular coordinate system. That is, the boom end N moves in the direction of<br>
the straight line AD and achieves the straight-line movement track, which requires the moving<br>
speed of the boom end in X axis to collaborate with the moving speed of the boom end in Y<br>
axis to keep the boom end N moving in the direction of AD.<br>
The movement planning unit 93 determines the movement direction of the boom in the<br>
rectangular coordinate system based on the inclining direction of the proportional rocker 75. In<br>
order to obtain the movement direction, it is necessary to plan the movement to ensure correct<br>
movement direction of the boom and obtain a straight-line movement track. Since either the<br>
movement of the boom in X axis or the movement of the boom in Y axis is not driven by a<br>
single actuating device, the movement planning in the rectangular coordinate system is<br>
considerable complex.<br>
Since the movement of the boom end is decomposed into the movement in X axis and<br>
the movement in Y axis in the rectangular coordinate system, the movement planning unit 93<br>
has to consider the collaboration between the rotation of the boom and the extension and<br>
retraction of the boom so as to ensure that the boom always move in the movement direction<br>
given by the commands along a straight line. The movement planning unit 93 plans the<br>
movement in the follow manner: firstly, a desired movement direction is calculated based on<br>
the valves of the X component and Y component of the movement control command; then, the<br>
coordinate position reached after moving at a preset steplength in said movement direction<br>
from the current position is calculated, whereby planning the desired movement of each boom<br>
section and the rotary platform 11 required for reaching this position. It also needs to keep the<br>
height of the boom end 20 unchanged during the movement in the movement planning.<br>
Furthermore, in the actual movement, the flow control unit 94 verifies the movement planning<br>
in view of the movement continuity, and performs servo control and synchronization control.<br>
During the movement, if the remote controller 70 is still transmitting the same movement<br>
control command, it is continue to obtain next coordinate position based on the steplength<br>
parameter and plan next movement. The steplength parameter is a preset parameter valve,<br>
which determines at what step size the movement planning unit 93 will carry out the<br>
23<br><br>
movement planning.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5e, the steplength is assumed to 1 meter and it is required to move<br>
from a point A to a point D. Therefore, it is required to move to a point B' which is 1 meter<br>
away from point A. As known from Fig. 5e, the boom should rotate clockwise by an angle ٱ<br>
AMB' (assuming the angle is 0) and the boom should extend a length L (L=MB'- MA). The<br>
movement planning outputted from the movement planning unit 93 is to ensure the boom<br>
extends a length L while the boom rotates clockwise the angle ٱ. In order to move from the<br>
point A to point D, it is required to continuously provide next point B', whereby the movement<br>
planning unit 93 may calculate to obtain a series of movement planning which causes the<br>
boom end 20 to move along the straight line AD. With assistance of the servo control and<br>
synchronous control of the flow control unit 94, it is possible to ensure the boom end 20 move<br>
to point D along a substantially straight-line movement track.<br>
The centering manner for determining the rectangular coordinate system may<br>
advantageously satisfies the control requirement of keeping the boom end to move along a<br>
straight line. However, there are still some disadvantages in this manner. Therefore, this<br>
invention also provides a teaching manner for determining the rectangular coordinate system<br>
in a horizontal plane. The teaching manner determines the rectangular coordinate system for<br>
the following reason: in actual concrete placing, such as placing a crossbeam or a flat plate, the<br>
boom end only need to move in two directions in the horizontal plane, one is the direction<br>
parallel to the crossbeam, and the other is the direction perpendicular to the crossbeam and in<br>
the horizontal plane. As shown in Fig. 6, it is assumed that the desired movement direction for<br>
the boom end is from projection point N to projection point N' in the horizontal plane. The<br>
points N and N' are two different points of the crossbeam which is the target of placing. The<br>
position of the points N and N' may be recorded by the control unit when the boom end is<br>
positioned at the two points to subsequently determine the rectangular coordinate system of<br>
the boom movement by a connecting line between the two points. Further, the coordinate<br>
system will keep unchanged in this working situation and form a fixed rectangular coordinate<br>
system. Once the fixed rectangular coordinate system has been determined, the movement in<br>
24<br><br>
the second primary adjustment direction 87 of the proportional rocker 75 is a straight-line<br>
movement parallel to the straight line NN', for example, PP' shown in Fig. 6. Also, the<br>
movement in the first primary adjustment direction 86 of the proportional rocker 75 is a<br>
straight-line movement perpendicular to the straight line NN'. Even when the rocker is moved<br>
again after centering, it still keep this characteristic, i.e., the coordinate system will not change<br>
due to the change of the boom position, unless the coordinate of the two points N and N' is<br>
cleared.<br>
In order to achieve this function, the remote controller 70 of this embodiment<br>
particularly provides a teaching selecting switch 76, as shown in Fig. 4. Preferably, the<br>
teaching selecting switch 76 comprises an auto-reset switch having three positions, which is<br>
kept in a center position without external force, is in a forward position defined as "teaching"<br>
mode when pushed toward, and is in a backward position defined as "cleaning" mode when<br>
pushed backward. When the operating mode select switch 77 is put to the rectangular<br>
coordinate mode, the teaching selecting switch 76 is used to send a command to memorize<br>
coordinates valve of a certain point and a command to clear coordinates of a certain point. The<br>
commands are then transmitted to the control unit 90 via the CAN data bus 85 to be executed<br>
by the control unit 90. As shown in Fig. 6, after memorizing the coordinates of the two points<br>
N and N', the extending direction of the boom and the direction perpendicular to the direction<br>
of the straight line NN' is defined as the positive direction of the Y axis. It is convenient to<br>
determine the X axis after the Y axis is determined. The X and Y coordinates in the rectangular<br>
coordinate system may be obtain and fixed by the two points memorizing method.<br>
After the rectangular coordinate system is determined by the teaching manner, control<br>
method of the control unit 90 in this coordinate system is the same that when the rectangular<br>
coordinate system is determined by the centering manner.<br>
In order to achieve the described new function, as shown in Fig. 4, the control unit 90<br>
of this embodiment also comprises a feedback display unit 96 for the remote controller. This<br>
unit transmits the information and the state concerned by the operator to a receiver 82 fixed in<br>
the automobile via the CAN data bus 85 connected with the control unit 90, and then transmits<br>
25<br><br>
to the remote controller 70 held in the hand of the operator by a radio wave 84 of certain<br>
frequency. Graphics and text may be displayed on the LCD 81 arranged on the remote<br>
controller 70. In this way, the operator may obtain the feedback information associated with<br>
the current operation in time. This function is an additional function, and is not essential to<br>
realize the intelligent control.<br>
Furthermore, in order to easily establish another rectangular coordinate system after<br>
one rectangular coordinate system has been established, a special switch (not shown) for<br>
rotating the coordinate system may be arranged on the remote controller 70. Once the<br>
rectangular coordinate system has been established, it is possible to use the switch to rotate the<br>
coordinate system on the horizontal plane by a certain angle. This switch may simplify the<br>
establishing process of a new rectangular coordinate system on the basis of an established<br>
rectangular coordinate system.<br>
Compared with the prior art, the above-mentioned embodiment is different in that the<br>
control device establishes the control mode of rectangular coordinate system. Under this<br>
control mode, the control components outputted from the proportional rocker or other control<br>
mechanisms are decomposed according to the X, Y and Z axes of the rectangular coordinate<br>
system so as to obtain the desired information about the movement direction and carry out the<br>
movement planning and control based on the information, whereby obtaining a straight-line<br>
movement track in the desired direction. Because of the arrangement of the rectangular<br>
