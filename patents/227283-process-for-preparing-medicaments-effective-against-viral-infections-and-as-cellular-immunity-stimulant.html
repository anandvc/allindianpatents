				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparing medicaments effective against viral<br>
infections and as cellular immunity stimulant. More particularly this invention pertains to a<br>
process for preparing medicaments using a number of drugs in their molecular form at<br>
concentration levels varying from picogram (10-12) to altogram (10-18) when used in combination<br>
have been found to procedure surprisingly effective action against different types of viral<br>
infections and also capable of enhancing cellular immunity level.<br>
Way back in 1918, Toyama and Kolmer observed that feeding low concentrations of arsenic<br>
enhances antibody production, while antibody suppression occurs following high-level exposure.<br>
There is also evidence in laboratory animals that nickel exposure results in altered resistance to<br>
viras and bacteria (Adkins et. al. 1978).<br>
As regards 'drugs' recent studies have indicated that certain toxic drugs may cause alterations in<br>
the immunity level of persons under treatment. In support of biphasic action of molecular phases<br>
of toxic drugs, the case of "Tamoxiphen" may be cited. Using a cell line of human breast cancer<br>
cells (MCF7), Horwitz et. al. (1978) found that the action of "Tamoxiphen" was biphasic in that<br>
at low extracellular levels (10-7 M) the drug showed agonistic properties in stimulating growth<br>
and inducing progesterone receptors. Higher doses (10-6M) were antagonistic. Interference with<br>
oestradiol may take the form of blocking the binding of oestradiol to cytosolic receptors, and of<br>
reducing the number of receptors available for the natural hormone (Coulson, Tayler &amp; Francis).<br>
It is noteworthy that inventions of antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agent (e.g. anti-malarial and<br>
unti-neoplasic, etc.) are great achievements during World War II and thereafter, but their<br>
effectiveness are gradually on the wane due to increased resistance to drugs and toxicity of these<br>
compounds. As a consequence thereof, more broad-spectrum antibiotics are needed today to treat<br>
even a common infection which could be cured by simply administering penicillin a decade<br>
earlier.<br>
However, no study was initiated to observe the efficiency of a mixture of toxic drugs in<br>
combatting a rather long list of diseases in their extreme dilutions e.g. (10-12 M - 10-18 M), and the<br><br>
present invention has produced unforeseen, surprising result by using a mixture of toxic drugs<br>
which act synergistically in raising the cellular immunity level in treated humans/animals, apart<br>
from being effective against a number of viral infections.<br>
The principal object of this invention is to provide a process for preparing medicaments which<br>
can effectively combat a number of viral infections and can also enhance cellular immunity<br>
levels.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide a process for preparing medicaments acting as<br>
immunostimulant where some of the constituent components are known to be<br>
immunodepressants.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to provide a process for preparing medicaments wherein<br>
the ingredients are present in amounts varying between 10-12 and 10-18 M.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a process for producing storage stable medicaments<br>
having anti-viral activity and also capable of raising cellular immunity level.<br>
The foregoing objects are achieved by the present invention according to which there is provided<br>
a process for preparing medicaments effective against viral infections and as cellular immunity<br>
stimulant which comprises making aqueous alcoholic solutions of the following compounds :-<br>
(i) "cyclophosphamide" -	Bis (2-chloroethyl) phosphamide cyclic propanolamide<br>
ester monohydrate, mol. wt. 279.1;<br>
(ii) "cyclosporin"	-	A member of a group of non-polar cyclic oligopeptides,<br>
having molecular weight of about 1203;<br>
(iii) "azathioprine"	-	6 - [(1 -Methyl - 4- nitro -1H- imidazol - 5-yl) thio]-1H<br>
-purine, mol.wt. 277.3;<br>
(iv) "methotrexate"	-	4 - Amino - 10 - methyl-folic acid, mol. wt. 454.4, and<br>
(v) "prednisolone"	-	(II 0) - 11, 17, 21 - Trihydroxypregna - 1,4 - diene - 3,<br>
20 - dione, mol. wt. 360.5,<br><br>
diluting the individual solutions/suspensions with aqueous alcohol until the solution has a<br>
concentration varying between 10-12 and 10-18M, and thereafter mixing the individual solutions in<br>
equal volumes to obtain a homogenous solution showing biphasic action against viral infections<br>
and also enhancing cellular immunity level.<br>
For the sake of brevity and convenience, brand names or trivial names as appearing above in<br>
respect of the individual constituents have been used in this specification text.<br>
In order to dissolve and dilute the constituent components/compounds of the above<br>
medicaments, it has been observed that 70% ethanol (v/v) can be optimally used.<br>
Dilution of the aforesaid components is carried out in the following mmanner:<br>
(i) "cyclophosphamide" -	IC contain 1.93 mgm; 0.0965 mg diluted with 99 drops of<br>
alcohol,<br>
(ii) "cyclosporin"	-	IC contain 6.666 mgm; 0.3333 mg diluted with 99 drops of<br>
alcohol,<br>
(iii) "azathioprine"	-	50 mgm mixed with 4950 mg. of sugar of milk and then<br>
dissolved in aqueous ethanol (trituration 1:99);<br>
(iv) "methotrexate"	-	IC contain 1.666 mgm; .0833 mg diluted with 99 drops of<br>
alcohol,<br>
(v) "prednisolone"	-	IC contain 2.666 mgm; 0.1333 mg diluted with 99 drops of<br>
ethanol, and thereafter the individual solutions are mixed in<br>
equal volumes.<br>
For enhancing shelf life and also for preventing deterioration of activity on prolonged storage,<br>
use has been made of benzalkonium chloride which is added to the final solution. The amount of<br>
this stabilizer varies between 5 and 25 ppm. One may also use isopropanol as an additional<br>
diluent, if needed or desired.<br><br>
Apart from the foregoing compounds, or nurse compounds selected from the following have<br>
been found to enhance the effectiveness of the subject composition in a synergistic manner. The<br>
amounts added vary between 10-12 to 10-18 M, as is the case with other ingredient drugs :-<br>
(i) "sulfasalazine"	- 5-[p-( 2 - pyridylsultamoyl) phenylazo]-salicylic acid, and<br>
(ii) "arsenious oxide" - AS2O3.<br>
Some of the aforesaid constituents are known to be immunosuppresant. But surprisingly when<br>
used in combination within concentration ranges of 10-12 - 10-18M, they not only show capability<br>
to effectively combat viral infections, they even act as immunostimulants. Antiviral drugs are<br>
available in modern, present day medicines. Most of them are toxic and prolonged administration<br>
often produce adverse side effects. On the contrary the medicaments of the present invention are<br>
harmless, safe to administer even for prolonged period of time and extremely cost - effective. An<br>
extremely toxic abused-drug like AS2O3 has been found to cause immune-alteration at alto-gram<br>
level in admixture with other ingredients.<br>
The medicaments on clinical trial have shown encouraging results as would be evidenced by the<br>
observed data given in a tabular form in the following Example which is given by way of<br>
illustration and not by way of limitation.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Furthermore, the medicaments produced by the process of the present invention have been<br>
found to be effective, inter alia, against the following :<br>
(i)	Infection - Viral diseases : measles, mumps, chicken pox, viral fever, viral hepatitis<br>
(B and non B), herpes;<br>
(ii)	Disfunctional uterine haemorrhage;<br>
(iii)	Dysmenorrhea<br>
(iv)	Diabetes mellitus (non - insulin dependent);<br>
(v)	Epilepsy;<br>
(vi)	Attention deficit hyperactive syndrome;<br>
(vii)	Mental retardation;<br>
(viii)	Autism;<br>
(ix)	Parkinsonism;<br>
(x)	Allergies (Type I, II, III, IV, Gell comb);<br>
(xi)	Diarrhoea of all forms and<br>
(xii)	Various forms of pain including pain from carcinoma.<br>
It may also be noted that the data included in the Example appearing hereinbefore, the<br>
medicaments prepared by the process of the present invention are effective as cellular immunity<br>
stimulant which is manifested by the enhancement of CD4-CD8 levels in the human system,<br>
even though some of the constituent components are known to be immunodepressants. Level and<br>
extent of stimulation are considerably enhanced by the mutual interaction of the components,<br>
thereby establishing synergistic action in the aforesaid medicaments.<br>
While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments<br>
thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be<br>
made therein without deviating from the spirit and scope of this invention. Thus the disclosure<br>
contained herein includes within its ambit the obvious equivalents and substitutes as well.<br>
Having described the invention in detail with particular reference to the illustrative "Example"<br>
given above, it will now be more specifically defined by means of claims appended hereafter.<br><br>
