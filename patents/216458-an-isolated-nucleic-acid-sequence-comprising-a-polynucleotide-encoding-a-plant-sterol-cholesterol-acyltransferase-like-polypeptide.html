				<td>This application claims priority to U.S. provisional application Serial No. 60/152,493, filed August 30, 1999 and herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention is directed to plant acyltransferase-like nucleic acid and amino acid sequences and constructs, and methods related to their use in altering sterol composition and/or content, and oil composition and/or content in host cells and plants.<br>
Related An<br>
Through the development of plant genetic engineering techniques, it is now possible to produce transgenic varieties of plant species to provide plants which have novel and desirable characteristics. For example, it is now possible to genetically engineer plants for tolerance to environmental stresses, such as resistance to pathogens and tolerance to herbicides. It is also possible to improve the nutritional characteristics of the plant, for example to provide improved fatty acid, carotenoid, sterol and tocopherol compositions. However, the number of useful nucleotide sequences for the engineering of such characteristics is thus far limited.<br>
There is a need for improved means to obtain or manipulate compositions of sterols from biosynthetic or natural plant sources. The ability to increase sterol production or alter the sterol compositions in plants may provide for novel sources of sterols for use in human and animal nutrition.<br>
Sterol biosynthesis branches from the famesy! diphosphate intermediate in the isoprenoid pathway. Sterol biosynthesis occurs via a mevalonate dependent pathway in mammals and higher plants (Goodwin,(1981) Biosynthesis of Isoprenoid Compounds, vol \ (Porter, J.W, &amp; Spurgeon, S.L., eds) pp.443-480, John Wiley and Sons, New York), while in green algae sterol biosynthesis is thought to occur via a mevalonate independent pathway (Schwender, et al. (1997) Physiology, Biochemistry, and Molecular Biology of<br><br>
Plant Lipids, (Williams, J.P„ Khan, M.U., and Lem, N.W., eds) pp. 180-182, Kluwer Academic Publishers. Norweil, MA).<br>
The solubility characteristics of sterol esters suggests that this is the storage form of sterols (Chang, era/., 0997)/(n/iu. Rev. Biochem., 66:612-638). Sterol O-acyltransferase enzymes such as acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) catalyze the formation of cholesterol esters, and thus are key to controlling the intracellular cholesterol storage. In yeast, it has been reported that overexpression ofLROl, a homolog of human LCAT, and phospho lipid; di acyl glycerol acyltransferase increased lipid synthesis (Oelkers et al., (2000) J. Biol. Chem., 26:15609-15612; Dahiqvist et al., (2000) Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, 97-,6487-6492),<br>
The characterization of various acylfransferase proteins is useful for the fiirther study of plant sterol synthesis systems and for the development of novel and/or alternative sterol sources. Studies of plant mechanisms may provide means to fixriher enhance, control, modify, or otherwise alter the sterol composition of plant ceils. Funhennore, such alterations in sterol content and/or composition may provide a means for obtaining tolerance to stress and insect damage. Of particular interest are the nucleic acid sequences of genes encoding proteins which may be useful for applications in genetic engineering.<br>

Isolated proteins. Polypeptides and Polynucleotides<br>
A first aspect of the present invention relates to isolated LCAT polynucleotides. The polynucleotide sequences of the present invention include isolated polynucleotides that encode the polypeptides of the invention having a deduced amino acid sequence selected from the group of sequences set forth in the Sequence Listing and to other polynucleotide sequences closely related to such sequences and variants thereof<br>
The invention provides a polynucleotide sequence identical over its entire length to each coding sequence as set forth in the Sequence Listing. The invention also provides the coding sequence for the mature polypeptide or a fragment thereof, as well as the coding sequence for the mature polypeptide or a fragment thereof in a reading frame with other coding sequences, such as those encoding a leader or secretory sequence, a pie-, pro-, or prepro- protein sequence. The polynucleotide can also include non-coding sequences, including for example, but not limited to, non-coding 5" and 3" sequences, stjch as the transcribed, untranslated sequences, termination signals, ribosome binding sites, sequences that stabilize mRNA, introns, polyadenylation signals, and additional coding sequence that encodes additional amino acids. For example, a marker sequence can be included to facilitate the purification of the fused polypeptide. Polynucleotides of the present invention also include polynucleotides comprising a structural gene and the tiaturally associated sequences that control gene expression.<br>
The invention also includes polynucleotides of the formula: X-(R,).-(R-{R3).-Y wherein, at the 5" end, X is hydrogen, and at the 3" end, Y is hydrogen or a metal, R, and R3 are any nucleic acid residue, n is an integer between 0 and 3000, preferably between 1 and 1000 and Rj is a nucleic acid sequence of the invention, particularly a nucleic acid sequence selected from the group set forth in the Sequence Listing and preferably SEQ ID NOs: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10-29, 33, 42-51, 73 and 75. In the formula, R is oriented so that its 5" end residue is at the left, bound to R,, and its 3" end residue is at the rit, bound to R3. Any stretch of nucleic acid residues denoted by either R group, where R is greater than I, may be either a heteropolymer or a homopolymer, preferably a heteropolymer.<br>
The invention also relates to variants of the polynucleotides described herein that encode for variants of the polypeptides of the invention. Variants that are fragments of the polynucleotides of the invention can be used to synthesize full-length polynucleotides of the invention. Preferred embodiments are polynucleotides encoding polypeptide variants wherein 5 to 10, 1 to 5,1 to 3,2,1 or no amino acid residues of a polypeptide sequence of<br><br>
the invention are substituted, added or deleted, in any combination. Particularly preferred are substitutions, additions, and deletions that are silent such that they do not alter the properties or activities of the polynucleotide or polypeptide.<br>
Further preferred embodiments of the invention that are at least 50%, 60%, or 70% identical over their entire length to a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the invention, and polynucleotides that are complementary to such polynucleotides. More preferle are polynucleotides that comprise a region that is at least 80% identical over its entire length to a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the invention and polynucleotides that are complementary thereto. In this regard, polynucleotides at least 90% identical over their entire length are particularly preferred, those at least 95% identical are especially preferred. Further, those with at least 91% identity are highly preferred and those with at least 98% and 99% identity are particularly highly preferred, with those at least 99% being the most highly preferred.<br>
Preferred embodiments are polynucleotides that encode polypeptides that retain substantially the same biological function or activity as determined by the methods described herein as the mature polypeptides encoded by the polynucleotides set forth in the Sequence Listing.<br>
The invention further relates to polynucleotides that hybridize to the above-described sequences. In particular, the invention relates to polynucleotides that hybridize under stringent conditions to the above-described polynucleotides. An example of stringent hybridization conditions is overnight incubarion at 42°C in a solution comprising 50% formamide, 5x SSC (150 mM NaCl, 15 mM trisodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.6), 5x Denhardt"s solution, 10% dextran sulfate, and 20 micrograms/milliliter denatured, sheared salmon sperm DNA, followed by washing the hybridization support in Olx SSC at approximately 65°C. Also included are polynucleotides that hybridize under a wash stringency of 0. IX SSC or O.IX SSPE (at SO"C- Other hybridization and wash conditions are well known and are exemplified in Sambrook, et ai. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition, Cold Spring Harbor, NY (1989), particularly Chapter 11.<br>
The invention also provides a polynucleotide consisting essentially of a polynucleotide sequence obtainable by screening an appropriate library containing the complete gene for a polynucleotide sequence set for in the Sequence Listing under stringent hybridization conditions with a probe having the sequence of said polynucleotide<br><br>
seiquence or a fragment thereof; and isolating said polynucleotide sequence. Methods for screening libraries are well known in the art and can be found for example in Sambrook, ei ai. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition, Cold Spring Harbor, NY (1989), particularly Chapter 8 and Ausubel et al. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, 3" ed, Wiley and Sons, 1995, chapter 6. Nucleic acid sequences useful for obtaining such a polynucleotide include, for example, probes and primers as described herein and in particular SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, 8,10-29, 33,42-51, 73 and 75. These sequences are particularly useful in screening libraries obtained from Arabidopsis, soybean and com for sequences encoding lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase and lecithin:cholesterol acyitransferase-Uke polypeptides and for screening libraries for sequences encoding acyt CoA:cholesterol acyl transferase and acyl CoAxhoIesterol acyl transferase-like polypeptides.<br>
As discussed herein regarding polynucleotide assays of the invention, for example, polynucleotides of the invention can be used as a hybridization probe for RNA, cDNA, or genomic DNA to isolate full length cDNAs or genomic clones encoding a polypeptide and to isolate cDNA or genomic clones of other genes that have a high sequence similarity to a polynucleotide set forth in the Sequence Listing and in particular SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, S, 10-29,33, 42-51, 73 and 75. Suchprobes will generEdly comprise at least 15 bases. Preferably such probes will have at least 30 bases and can have at least 50 bases. Particularly preferred probes wiH have between 30 bases and 50 bases, inclusive.<br>
The coding region of each gene that comprises oris comprised by a polynucleotide sequence set forth in the Sequence Listing may be isolated by screening using a DNA sequence provided in the Sequence Listing to synthesize an oUgonucleolide probe. A labeled oligonucleotide having a sequence complementary to that of a gene of the invention is then used to screen a library of cDNA, genomic DNA or mRNA to identify members of the library which hybridize to the probe. For example, synthetic oligonucleotides are prepared which correspond to the LCAT EST sequences. The oiigonucieotides are used as primers in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques to obtain 5" and 3" terminal sequence of LCAT genes. Alternatively, where oligonucleotides of low degeneracy can be prepared from particular LCAT peptides, such probes may be used directly to screen gene libraries for LCAT gene sequences. In particular, screening of cDNA libraries in phage vectors is useful in such methods due to lower levels of background hybridization.<br><br>
Typically, a LCAT sequence obtainable from the use of nucleic acid probes will show 60-70% sequence identity between the target LCAT sequence and the encoding sequence used as a probe. However, lengthy sequences with as little as 50-60% sequence identity may also be obtained. The nucleic acid probes may be a lengthy fragment of the nucleic acid sequence, or may also be a shorter, oligonucleotide probe. When longer nucleic acid fragments are employed as probes (greater than about 100 bp), one may screen at lower stringencies in order to obtain sequences from the target sample which have 20-50% deviation (i.e., 50-80% sequence homology) from the sequences used as probe. Oligonucleotide probes can be considerably shorter than the entire nucleic acid sequence encoding an LCAT enzyme, but should be at least about 10, preferably at least about 15, and more preferably at least about 20 nucleotides. A higher degree of sequence identity is desired when shorter regions are used as opposed to longer regions. It may thus be desirable to identify regions of highly conserved amino acid sequence to design oligonucleotide probes for delecting and recovering other related LCAT genes. Shorter probes are often particularly useful for polymerase chain reactions (PCR), especially when highly conserved sequences can be identified. (See, Gou\d, et al., PNAS USA (1989) 56:1934-1938.).<br>
Another aspect of the present mvention relates to LCAT polypeptides. Such polypeptides include isolated polypeptides set forth in the Sequence Listing, as well as polypeptides and fragments thereof, particularly those polypeptides which exhibit LCAT activity and also those polypeptides which have at least 50%, 60% or 70% identity,  ■ preferably at least 80% identity, more preferably at least 90% identity, and most preferably at least 95% identity to a polypeptide sequence selected from the group of sequences set forth in the Sequence Listing, and also include portions of such polypeptides, wherein such portion of the polypeptide preferably includes at least 30 amino acids and more prefersdaly includes at least 50 amino acids.<br>
"Identity", as is well understood in the art, is a relationship between two or more solypeptide sequences or two or more polynucleotide sequences, as determined by ;omparing the sequences. In the art, "identity" also means the degree of sequence ■elatedness between polypeptide or polynucleotide sequences, as determined by the match jetween strings of such sequences. "Identity" can be readily calculated by known methods ncluding, but not limited to, those described in Computational Molecular Biology, Lesk, KM., ed., Oxford University Press, New York (1988); Biocomputing: Informatics and Jenome Projects, Smith, D.W., ed..

Methods to determine identity are designed to give the largest match between the sequences tested. Moreover, methods to determine identity are codified in publicly available programs. Computer programs which can be used to determine identity between two sequences iBcIude, but are not limited to, GCG (Devereux, J., et al.. Nucleic Acids Research 12(1):387 (1984); suite of five BLAST programs, three designed for nucleotide sequences queries (BLASTN, BLASTX, and TBLASTX) and two designed for protein sequence queries (BLASTP and TBLASTN) (Coulson, Trends in Biotechnology, J2: 76-80 (1994); Birren, et al.. Genome Analysis, J: 543-559 (1997)). The BLAST X program is publicly available from NCBI and other sources (BLASTManual, Altschul, S., el al., NCBINLM NIH, Bethesda, MD 20894; Altschul, S., et al., J. Mol. Biol., 215:403-410 (1990)). The well known Smith Waterman algorithm can also be used to detennine identity.<br>

A program which can be used with these parameters is publicly available as the "gap" program from Genetics Computer Group, Madison Wisconsin. The above parameters are the default parameters for nucleic acid comparisons.<br><br>
The invention also includes polypeptides of the fonnula;<br>
x-(R,)n-{R:)-(R3VY<br>
wherein, at the amino terminus, X is hydrogen, and at the carboxyl temiinus, Y is hydrogen or a metal, R, and R, are any amino acid residue, n is an integer between 0 and 1000, and Rj is an amino acid sequence of the invention, particularly an amino acid sequence selected from the group set forth in the Sequence Listing and preferably SEQ ID NOs: 3, 5, 7, 9, 74 and 76. In the formula, R, is oriented so that its amino terminal residue is at the left, bound to Rj, and its carboxy terminal residue is at the right, bound to R3. Any stretch of amino acid residues denoted by either R group, where R is greater than 1, may be either a heteropolymer or a homopolymer, preferably a heteropoiymer.<br>
Polypeptides of die present invention include isolated polypeptides encoded by a polynucleotide comprising a sequence selected from the group of a sequence contained m SEQ ID NOs: 2, 4, 6, 8, 73 and 75.<br>
The polypeptides of the present invention can be mature protein or caii be part of a fusion protein.<br>
Fragments and variants of the polypeptides are also considered to be a part of the invention. A fragment is a variant polypeptide which has an amino acid sequence that is entirely the same as part but not all of the amino acid sequence of the previously described polypeptides. The fragments can be "free-standing" or comprised within a lafger polypeptide of which the fragment forms a part or a region, most preferably as a single continuous region. Preferred fragments are biologically active fragments which are those fragments that mediate activities of the polypeptides of the invention, including those with similar activity or improved activity or with a decreased activity. Also included are those polypeptides and polypeptide fragments that are antigenic or immunogenic in an animal, particuiarly a human and antibodies, either polyclonal or monoclonal that specifically bind the antigenic fragments. In one preferred embodiment, such antigenic or immunogenic fragments comprise at least 10 consecutive amino acids from the amino acid sequences disclosed herein or such sequences with at least one conservative amino acid substitution. In additional embodiments, such antigenic or immunogenic fragments comprise at least 15, at least 25, at least 50 or at least 100 consecutive amino acids from the amino acid sequences disclosed herein or such sequences with at least one conservative amino acid substitution. Methods for the production of antibodies from polypeptides and polypeptides conjugated to carrier molecules are well known in the art and can be found<br><br>
for example in Ausubel et al.. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, 3"* ed., Wiley &amp; Sons, 1995, particularly chapter 11.<br>
Variants of the polypeptide also include polypeptides that vary from the sequences set forth in the Sequence Listing by conservative amino acid substitutions, substitution of a residue by another with like characteristics. Those of ordinary skill in the art are aware that modifications in the amino acid sequence of a peptide, polypeptide, or protein can result in equivalent, or possibly improved, second generation peptides, etc., that display equivalent or superior fimctional characteristics when compared to the original amino acid sequence. The present invention accordingly encompasses such modified amino acid sequences. Alterations can include amino acid insertions, deletions, substitutions, truncations, fusions, shuffling of subunit sequences, and the like, provided that the peptide sequences produced by such modifications have substantially the same functional properties as the naturally occurring counterpart sequences disclosed herein.<br>
One factor that can be considered in making such changes is the hydropathic index of amino acids. The importance of the hydropathic amino acid index in conferring interactive biological fimction on a protein has been discussed by Kyte and Doohttle (J. Mol. BioL, 157: 105-132,1982). It is accepted that the relative hydropathic character of amino acids contributes to the secondary structure of the resultant protein. This, in turn, affects the interaction of the protein with molecules such as enzymes, substrates, receptors, DNA, antibodies, antigens, etc.<br>
Based on its hydrophobicity and charge characteristics, each amino acid has been assigned a hydropathic index as follows: isoleucine (+4.5); valine (+4.2); leucine (+3.8); phenylalanine (+2.8); cysteine/cystine (+2.5); methionine (+1.9); alanine (+1.8); glycine (-0.4); threonine (-0.7); serine (-0.8); tryptophan (-0.9); tyrosine (-1.3); proline (-1.6); histidine (-3.2); glutamate/glulamine/aspartate/asparagine (-3.5); lysine (-3.9); and arginine (-4.5).<br>
As is known in the art, certain amino acids in a peptide or protein can be substituted for other amino acids having a similar hydropathic index or score and produce a resultant peptide or protein having similar biological activity, i.e., which still retains biological functionality. In making such changes, it is preferable that amino acids having hydropathic indices within ±2 are substituted for one another. More preferred substitutions are those wherein the amino acids have hydropathic indices within ±1. Most preferred substitutions are those wherein the amino acids have hydropathic indices within ±0.5.<br><br>
Like amino acids can also be substituted on the basis of hydrophilicity. U.S. Patent No. 4,554,101 discloses that the greatest local average hydrophilicity ofa protein, as governed by the hydrophihcity of its adjacent amino acids, correlates with a biological property of the protein. The following hydrophilicity values have been assigned to amino acids: arginine/lysine (+3.0); aspartate/glulamate (+3.0 ±1); serine (+0.3); asparagine/glutamine (+0.2); glycine (0); threonine (-0.4); proline (-0.5 ±1); alanine/histidine (-0.5); cysteine (-1.0); methionine (-1.3); valine (-1.5); leucine/isoleucine (-1.8); tyrosme (-2.3); phenylalanine (-2.5); and tryptophan (-3.4). Thus, one amino acid in a peptide, polypeptide, or protein can be substituted by another amino acid having a similar hydrophilicity score and still produce a resultant protein having similar biological activity, i.e., still retaining correct biological fimction. In making such changes, amino acids having hydropathic indices within ±2 are preferably substituted for one another, those within ±1 are more preferred, and those within iO.5 are most preferred.<br>
As outlined above, amino acid substitutions in the peptides of the present invention can be based on e relative similarity of the amino acid side-chain substituents, for example, their hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, charge, size, etc. Exemplary substitutions that take various of the foregoing characteristics into consideration in order to produce conservative amino acid changes resulting in silent changes within the present peptides, etc., can be selected from other members of the class to which the naturally occurring amino acid belongs. Ar. ino acids can be divided into the following four groups: (1) acidic amino acids; (2) basic amino acids; (3) neutral polar amino acids; and (4) neutral non-polar amino acids. Representative amino acids within these various groups include, but are not limited to: (1) acidic (negatively charged) amino acids such as aspartic acid and glutamic acid; (2) basic (positively charged) amino acids such as arginine, histidine, and lysine; (3) neutral polar amino acids such as glycine, serine, threonine, cysteine, cystine, tyrosine, asparagine, and glutamine; and (4) neutral non-polar amino acids such as alanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and methionine. It should be noted that changes which are not expected to be advantageous can also be useful if these result in the production of functional sequences.<br>
Variants that are fragments of the polypeptides of the invention can be used to produce the corresponding full length polypeptide by peptide synthesis. Therefore, these variants can be used as iniemiediates for producing the full-length polypeptides of the invention.<br><br>
The polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention can be used, for example, in the transformation of host cells, such as plant cells, animal cells, yeast cells, bacteria, bacteriophage, and viruses, as fimher discussed herein.<br>
The invention also provides polynucleotides that encode a polypeptide that is a mature protein plus additional amino or carboxyl-terminai amino acids, or amino acids within the mature polypeptide (for example, when the mature form of the protein has more than one polypeptide chain). Such sequences can, for example, play a role in the processing of a protein from a precursor to a mature form, allow protein transport, shorten or lengthen protein half-life, or facilitate manipulation of the protein in assays or production. It is contemplated that cellular enzymes can be used to remove any additional amino acids from the mature protein.<br>
A precursor protein, having the mature fonn of the polypeptide fused to one or more prosequences may be an inactive form of the polypeptide. The inactive precursors generally are activated when the prosequences are removed. Some or all of the prosequences may be removed prior to activation. Such precursor protein are generally called proproteins.<br>

The expression constructs generally comprise a regulatory sequence functional in a host cell operably linked to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase-like polypeptide or acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase-like polypeptide of the present invention and a transcriptional termination region fionctional in a host plant cell. Of particular interest is the use of promoters (also referred to as transcriptional initiation regions) functional in plant host cells.<br>

Of particular interest is the expression of the nucleic acid sequences of the present invention from transcription initiation regions which are preferentiaily expressed in a plant seed tissue. Examples of such seed preferential transcription initiation sequences include those sequences derived from sequences encoding plant storage protein genes or from genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis in oilseeds. Examples of such promoters include the 5" regulatory regions from such genes asnapin (Kridl ei al., Seed Set Res. /;209:219 (1991)), phaseolin, zein, soybean trypsin inhibitor, ACP, slearoyl-ACP desaturase, soybean a" subunitof P-conglycinin (soy 7s, (Chen era/., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 83:8560-8564 (1986))) and oieosin. Seed-specific gene regulation is discussed in EP 0 255 378 BI and U.S. Patents 5,420,034 and 5,608,152 . Promoter hybrids can also be constructed to enhance transcriptional activity (Hoffinan, U.S. Patent No. 5,106,739), or to combine desired transcriptional activity and tissue specificity.<br>
It may be advantageous to direct the localization of proteins conferring LCAT to a particular subcellular compartment, for example, to the mitochondrion, endoplasmic reticulum, vacuoles, chloroplast or other plastidic compartment. For example, where the genes of interest of the present invention will be targeted to plastids, such as chloroplasts, for expression, the constructs will also employ the use of sequences to direct the gene to the plastid. Such sequences are referred to herein as chloroplast transit peptides (CTP) or plastid a-ansit peptides (PTP). hi this manner, where the gene of interest is not directly inserted into the plastid, the expression construct will additionally contain a gene encoding a transit peptide to direct the gene of interest to the plastid. The chloroplast transit peptides may be derived from the gene of interest, or may be derived from a heterologous sequence having a CTP. Such transit peptides are known in the art. See, for example, Von Heijnee/a/. (1991)PlantMoL Biol. Rep. 9:104-126; Clarke?a/. {19S9) J. Biol. Chem. 264:17544-17550; della-Cioppa et al. (1987) Plant Physiol. 54:965-968; Romer el al.<br><br>
(1993) Biochem. Biophys. Res Commun. /96:1414-1421; and. Shah et al. (1986) Science 253:478-481.<br>
Depending upon the intended use, the constructs may contain the nucleic acid sequence which encodes the entire LCAT protein, a portion of the LCAT protein, the entire ACAT protein, or a portion of the ACAT protem. For example, where antisense inhibition of a given LCAT or ACAT protein is desired, the entire sequence is not required. Furthermore, where LCAT or ACAT sequences used in constructs are intended for use as probes, it may be advantageous to prepare constructs containing only a particular portion of a LCAT or ACAT encoding sequence, for example a sequence which is discovered to encode a highly conserved region.<br>
The skilled artisan will recognize that there are various methods for the inhibition of expression of endogenous sequences in a host cell. Such methods include, but are not limited to antisense suppression (Smith, et al. (1988) Nature 334:724-726), co-suppression (NapoU, et a/. (1989) P/ant Ce//2-.279-289), ribozymes (PCT Publication WO 97/10328), and combinations of sense and antisense Waterhouse, el al. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95:13959-13964.   Methods for the suppression of endogenous sequences in a host cell typically employ the transcription or transcription and translation of at least a portion of the sequence to be suppressed. Such sequences may be homologous to coding as well as non-coding regions of the endogenous sequence.<br>
Regulatory transcript termination regions may be provided in plant expression constructs of this mvention as well. Transcript termination regions may be provided by the DNA sequence encoding the diacylglycerol acyllransferase or a convenient transcription termination region derived from a different gene source, for example, the n-anscript termination region which is naturally associated with the transcript initiation region. The skilled artisan will recognize that any convenient transcript termination region which is capable of terminating transcription in a plant cell may be employed in the constructs of the present invention.<br>
Alternatively, constructs may be prepared to direct the expression of the LCAT or ACAT sequences directly from the host plant cell plastid. Such constructs and methods are known in the art and are generally described, for example, in Svab, et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:8526-8530 and Svab and Maliga (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 90:913-917 and in U.S. Patent Number 5,693,507.<br>
A plant cell, tissue, organ, or plant into which the recombinant DNA coi\stnicts containing the expression constructs have been introduced is considered transformed.<br><br>
transfected, or transgenic. A transgenic or transformed cell or plant also includes progeny of the cell or plant and progeny produced from a breeding program employing such a transgenic plant as a parent in a cross and exhibiting an altered phenotype resulting from the presence of a LCAT nucleic acid sequence.<br>
Plant expression or transcription constructs having a plant LCAT as the DNA sequence of interest for increased or decreased expression thereof may be employed with a wide variety of plant life, particularly, plant life involved in the production of vegetable oils for edible and industrial uses. Most especially preferred are temperate oilseed crops. Plants of interest include, but are not limited to, rapeseed (Canola and High Erucic Acid varieties), sunflower, safilower, cotton, soybean, peanut, coconut and oil palms, and com. Depending on the method for introducing the recombinant constructs into the host cell, other DNA sequences may be required. Importantly, this invention is applicable to dicotyledyons and monocotyledons species alike and will be readily applicable to new and/or improved transformation and regulation techniques.<br>
Of particular interest, is the use of plant LCAT and ACAT constructs in plants to produce plants or plant parts, including, but not limited to leaves, stems, roots, reproductive, and seed, with a modified content of lipid and/or sterol esters and to alter the oil production by such plants.<br>
Of particular interest in the present invention, is the use of ACAT genes in conjunction with the LCAT sequences to increase the sterol content of seeds. Thus, overexpression of a nucleic acid sequence encoding an ACAT and LCAT in an oilseed crop may find use in the present invention to increase sterol levels in plant tissues and/or increase oil production.<br>
It is contemplated that the gene sequences may be synthesized, either completely or in part, especially where it is desirable to provide plant-preferred sequences. Thus, all or a portion of the desired structural gene (that portion of the gene which encodes the LCAT or ACAT protein) may be synthesized using codons preferred by a selected host. Host-preferred codons may be determined, for example, from the codons used most frequently in the proteins expressed in a desired host species.<br>
One skilled in the art will readily recognize that antibody preparations, nucleic acid probes (DNA and RNA) and the like may be prepared and used to screen and recover "homologous" or "related" sequences from a variety of plant sources. Homologous sequences are found when there is an identity of sequence, which may be determined upon-comparison of sequence information, nucleic acid or amino acid, or through hybridization<br><br>
reactions between a known LCAT and a candidate source, Conservative clianges, such as Glu/Asp, Val/rie, Ser/Thr, Arg/Lys and Gln/Asn may also be considered in determining sequence homology. Amino acid sequences are considered homologous by as lirtie as 25% sequence identity between the two complete mature proteins. (See generally, Doolittle, R.F., OF URFS and ORFS (Umversity Science Books, CA, 1986.)<br>
Thus, other LCATs may be obtained &amp;om the specific sequences provided herein. Furthermore, it will be apparent that one can obtain natural and synthetic sequences, including modified amino acid sequences and starting materials for synthetic-protein modeling from the exemplified LCAT and ACAT sequences and from sequences which are obtained through the use of such exemplified sequences. Modified amino acid sequences include sequences which have been mutated, truncated, increased and the like, whether such sequences were partially or wholly synthesized. Sequences which are actually purified fiom plant preparations or are identical or encode identical proteins thereto, regardless of the method used to obtain the protein or sequence, are equally considered naturally derived.<br>
For immimologicai screening, antibodies to the protein can be prepared by injecting rabbits or mice with the purified protein or portion thereof, such methods of preparing antibodies being well known to those in the art. Either monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies can be produced, although typically polyclonal antibodies are more useful for gene isolation. Western analysis may be conducted to determine that a related protein is present in a crude extract of the desired plant species, as detertnined by cross-reaction with the antibodies to the encoded proteins. When cross-reactivity is observed, genes encoding the related proteins are isolated by screening expression libraries representing the desired plant species. Expression hbraries can be constructed in a variety of commercially available vectors, including lambda gtl 1, as described in Sambrook, et ai (Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition (1989) Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York).<br>
To confirm the activity and specificity of the proteins encoded by the identified nucleic acid sequences as acyltransferase enzymes, in vitro assays are performed in insect cell cultures using baculovinis expression systems. Such baculovirus expression systems are known in the art and are described by Lee, et ai U.S. Patent Number 5,348,886, the entirety of which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
In addition, other expression constructs may be prepared to assay for protein activity utilizing different expression systems. Such expression constructs are transformed<br><br>
into yeast or prokaryotic host and assayed for acyltransferase activity. Such expression systems are known in the art and are readily available through commercial sources.<br>
The method of transfomiation in obtaining such transgenic plants is not critical to the instant invention, and various methods of plant transfonnation are currently available. Furthermore, as newer methods become available to transform crops, they may also be directly applied hereunder. For example, many plant species naturally susceptible to Agrobacterium infection may be successfully transformed via tripartite or binary vector methods of Agrobacierium mediated transformation, hi many instances, it will be desirable to have the construct bordered on one or both sides by T-DNA, particularly having the left and right borders, more particularly the right border. This is particularly useful when the construct uses A. tumefaciens ox A. rhizogenes as a mode for transformation, although the T-DNA borders may find use with other modes of transformation, hi addition, techniques of microinjection, DNA particle bombardment, and electroporation have been developed which allow for the transformation of various monocot and dicot plant species.<br>
Normally, included with the DMA construct will be a structural gene having the necessary regulatory regions for expression in a host and providing for selection of transformani ceils. The gene may provide for resistance to a cytotoxic agent, e.g. antibiotic, heavy metal, toxin, etc., complementation providing prototrophy to an auxotrophic host, viral immimity or the like. Depending upon the number of different host species the expression construct or components thereof are introduced, one or more markers may be employed, where different conditions for selection are used for the different hosts.<br>
Non-hmiting examples of suitable selection markers include genes that confer resistance to bleomycin, gentamycin, glyphosate, hygromycin, kanamycin, methotrexate, phleomycin, phosphinotricin, spectinomycin, streptomycin, sulfonamide and sulfonylureas. Maliga et al.. Methods in Plant Molecular Biology, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1995, p. 39. Examples of markers include, but are not limited to, alkaline phosphatase (AP), myc, hemagglutinin (HA), p glucuronidase (GUS), luciferase, and green fluorescent protein (GFP).<br>
Where Agrobacterium is used for plant cell transformation, a vector may be used which may be introduced Into the Agrobacterium host for homologous recombination with T-DNA or the Ti- or Ri-plasmid present in the Agrobacterium host. The Ti- or Ri-plasmid containing the T-DNA for recombination may be armed (capable of causing gall<br><br>
formation) or disarmed (incapable of causing gall formation), the latter being pemiissible, so long as the vir genes are present in the transformed Agrobacterium host. The armed plasmid can give a mixture of normal plant ceils and gall.<br>
In some instances where Agrobacterium is used as the vehicle for transforming ?     host plant cells, the expression or transcription construct bordered by the T-DNA border region(s) will be inserted into a broad host range vector capable of replication in E. coii and Agrobacterium, there being broad host range vectors described in the literature. Conamonly used is pRK2 or derivatives thereof See, for example, Ditta, et al, (Proc. Nat. Acad. ScL. U.S.A. (1980) 77:7347-7351) and EPA 0 120 515, which are incorporated I      herein by reference. Alternatively, one may insert the sequences to be expressed in plant cells into a vector containing separate replication sequences, one of which stabilizes the vector in E. coli, and the other in Agrobacterium. See, for example, McBride and Summerfelt (Plant Mol. Biol. (1990) 14:269"276), wherein the pRiHRI (Jouanin, et al.. Mol. Gen. Genet. (1985) 201:370-374) origin of replication is utilized and provides for added stability of the plant expression vectors Ln host Agrobacterium cells.<br>
Included with the expression construct and the T-DNA can be one or more markera, which allow for selection of transformed Agrobacterium and transformed plant cells. A<br>
number of markers have been developed for use with plant cells, such as resistance to chloramphenicol, kanamycin, the aminoglycoside G4-I8, hygromycin, or the like. The particular marker employed is not essential to this invention, one or another marker being prefened depending on the particular host and the manner of construction.<br>
For transformation of plant cells using Agrobacterium, explants may be combined and incubated with the transformed Agrobacterium for sufficient time for transformation, the bacteria killed, and the plant ccUs cultured in an appropriate selective medium. Once callus forms, shoot formadon can be encouraged by employing the appropriate plant hormones in accordance with known methods and the shoots transferred to rooting medium for regeneration of plants. The plants may then be grown to seed and the seed used to estabUsh repetitive generations and for isolation of vegetable oils.<br>
Thus, in another aspect of the present invention, methods for modifying the sterol and/or stanol composition of a host cell. Of particular interest are methods for modifying the sterol and/or stanol composition of a host plant cell. In general the methods involve eidier increasing the levels of sterol ester compounds as a proportion of the total sterol<br><br>
compounds. The method generally comprises the use of expression constructs to direct the expression of the polynucleotides of the present invention in a host ceil.<br>
Also provided are methods for reducing the proportion of sterol ester compounds as a percentage of total sterol compounds in a host plant cell. The method generally comprises the use of expression constructs to direct the suppression of endogenous acyltransferase proteins in a host cell.<br>
Of particular interest is the use of expression constructs to modify the levels of sterol compounds in a host plant cell. Most particular, the methods find use in modifying the levels of sterol compounds in seed oils obtained from plant seeds.<br>
Also of interest is the use of expression constructs of the present invention to alter oil production in a host cell and in particular to increase oil production. Of particular interest is the use of expression constructs containing nucleic acid sequences encoding LCAT and/or ACAT polypeptides to transform host plant cells and to use these host cells to regenerate whole planis having increase oil production as compared to the same plant not containing the expression construct.<br>
The oils obtained from transgenic plants having modified sterol compound content find use in a wide variety of applications. Of particular interest in the present invention is the use of Uie oils containing modified levels of sterol compounds in applications involved in improving human nutrition and cardiovascular health. For example, phytostanols are beneficial for lowering serum cholesterol (Ling, et al (1995) Life Sciences 57:195-206).<br>
Cholesterol-lowering compositions comprise the oils and sterol ester compound compositions obtained using the methods of the present invention. Such cholesterol lowering compositions include, but are not limited to foods, food products, processed foods, food ingredients, food additive compositions, or dietary/nutritional supplements that contain oils and/or fats. Non-limiting examples include margarines; butters; shortenings; cooking oils; frying oils; dressings, such as salad dressings; spreads; mayonnaises; aiKi vitamin/mineral supplements. Patent documents relating to such compositions include, U.S. Patents 4,588,717 and 5,244,887, and PCT International Publication Nos. WO 96/38047, WO 97/42830, WO 98/06405, and WO 98/06714. Additional non-limiting examples include toppings; dairy products such as cheese and processed cheese; processed meat; pastas; sauces; cereals; desserts, mcludlng frozen and shelf-stable desserts; dips; chips; baked goods; pastries; cookies; snack bars; confections; chocolates; beverages; unextracted seed; and unextracted seed that has been<br><br>
ground, cracked, milled, rolled, extruded, pelleted, defatted, dehydrated, or oiherwise processed, but which still contains the oils, etc., disclosed herein.<br>
The cholesterol-lowering compositions can also take the form of pharmaceuricai compositions comprising a cholesterol-lowering effective amount of the oils or sterol compound compositions obtained using the methods of the present invention, along with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipient, or diluent. These pharmaceutical compositions can be in the form of a liquid or a solid. Liquids can be solutions or suspensions; solids can be in the form of a powder, a granule, a pill, a tablet, a gel, or an extrudate. U.S. Patent 5,270,041 relates to sterol-containing pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
Thus, by expression of the nucleic acid sequences encoding acyltransferase-iike sequences of the present mvention in a host cell, it is possible to modify the lipid content and/or composition as well as the sterol content and/or composition of the host ceil.<br>
The inventioa now being generally described, it will be more readily understood by reference to the following examples which are included for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLES Example 1: RKA Isolations<br>
Total RNA from the inflorescence and developing seeds of Arabidopsis thaUana was isolated for ixse in construction of complementary (cDNA) libraries. The procedure was an adaptation of the DNA isolation protocol of Webb and Knapp (D.M. Webb and S.J. Knapp, (1990) Plant Molec. Reporter, 8,180-185). The following description assumes the use of Ig fresh weight of tissue. Frozen seed tissue was powdered by grinding under liquid nifrogen. The powder was added to 10ml REC buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, pH 9, 0.8M NaCl, lOmM EDTA, 0.5% w/v CTAB (cetyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide)) along wiih 0.2g insoluble polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, and ground at room temperature. The homogenate was centrifiiged for 5 minutes at 12,000 xg to pellet msoluble material. The resulting supernatant fraction was extracted with chlorofonn, and the top phase was recovered.<br>
The RNA was then precipitated by addition of 1 volume RecP (SOmM Tris-HCL pH9, lOmM EDTA and 0.5% (w/v) CTAB) and collected by brief centrifiigation as before. The RKA pellet was redissoWed in 0.4 ml of IM NaCl. The RNA pellet was redissolved in water and extracted with phenol/chloroform. Sufficient 3M potassium acetate (pH 5) ws added to make the mixture 0.3M in acetate, followed by addition of two volumes of<br><br>
ethanoi to precipitate the RNA. After washing with ethanol, this final RNA precipitate was dissolved in water and stored frozen.<br>
Alternatively, total RNA may be obtained using TRIzol reagent (BRL-Lifetechnologies, Gaithersburg, MD) following the manufacturer"s protocol. The RNA precipitate was dissolved in water and stored frozen.<br>
Example 2: Identification of LCAT Sequences<br>
Searches were performed on a Silicon Graphics Unix computer using additional Bioaccellerator hardware and Gen Web software supplied by Compugen Ltd. This software and hardware enabled the use of the Smith-Waterman algorithm in searching DNA and protein databases using profiles as queries. The program used to query protein databases was profilesearch. This is a search where the query is not a single sequence but a profile based on a multiple alignment of amino acid or nucleic acid sequences. The profile was used to query a sequence data set, i.e., a sequence database. The profile contained all the pertinent information for scoring each position in a sequence, in effect replacing the "scoring matrix" used for the standard query searches. The program used to query nucleotide databases with a protein ptofiie was tprofilesearch. Tprofilesearch searches nucleic acid databases using an amino acid profile query. As the search is running, sequences in the database are translated to amino acid sequences in six reading fi-ames. The output file for tprofilesearch is identical to the output file for profilesearch except for an additional column that indicates liie frame in which the best alignment occurred.<br>
The Smith-Waterman algorithm, (Smith and Waterman (1981)/ Molec. Biol. 147:195-197), was used to search for similarities between one sequence from the query and a group of sequences contained in the database.<br>
A protein sequence of Lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase from human (McLean J, etal. (1986) Nucleic Acids Res. 14(23):93 97-406 SEQ ID N0:1)) was used to search the NCBI non-redundant protein database using BLAST. Three sequences were identified from Arabidopsis, GenBank accessions AC004557 (referred to herein as LCATl, SEQ ID N0:2), AC003027 (referred to herein as LCAT2, SEQ ID N0:4), and AL024486 (referred to herein as LCAT3, SEQ K) N0:6). The deduced amino acid sequences are provided in SEQ ID NOs: 3, 5, and 7, respectively.<br>
The profile generated fiom the queries using PSI-BLAST was excised from the hyper text markup language (html) file. The worldwide web (www)/html interface to<br><br>
psiblast at ncbi stores the current generated profile matrix in a hidden field in the html file that is returned after each iteration of psiblast. However, this matrix has been encoded into string62 (s62) format for ease of transport through html. String62 format is a simple conversion of the values of the matrix into html legal ascii characters.<br>
The encoded matrix width (x axis) is 26 characters, and comprise the consensus characters, the probabilities of each amino acid in the order A3,C J&gt;,E,F,G Ji,I,K.,L,M,N, P,Q,R,S,T,V,W,X,Y,Z (where B represents D and N, and Z represents Q and E, and X represents any amino acid), gap creation value, and gap extension value.<br>
The length (y axis) of the matrix corresponds to the length of the sequences identified by PSI-BLAST. The order of the amino acids corresponds to the conserved amino acid sequence of the sequences identified using PSI-BLAST, widi the N-terminal end at the top of the matrix. The probabilities of otiier amino acids at that position are represented for each amino acid along the x axis, below the respective single letter amino acid abbreviation.<br>
Thus, each row of the profile consists of the highest scoring (consensus) amino acid, followed by the scores for each possible amino acid at that position in sequence matrix, the score for opening a gap that that position, and the score for continuing a gap at that position.<br>
The string62 file is converted back into a profile for use in subsequent searches. The gap open field is set to U and the gap extension field is set to 1 along the x axis. The gap creation and gap extension values are known, based on the settings given to the PSI¬BLAST algorithm. The matrix is exported to the standard GCG profile fonn. This format can be read by Gen Web.<br>
The algorithm used to convert the string62 formatted file to the matrix is outlined<br>
in Table 1.	"<br><br>

The protein sequences ofLCATl, LCAT2, and LCAT3 as well as the PSI-BLAST profile were used to search public and proprietary databases for additional LCAT sequences. Two EST sequences were identified which appear to be identical to LCATi and LCAT3, respectively. One additional Arabidopsis sequence was identified from the proprietary databases, LCAT4 (SEQ ID NO".S). The deduced protein sequence of LCAT4 is provided in SEQ 10 N0-.9. Two additional genomic sequences were identified using the PSI-BLAST profile from libraries of Arabidopsis ecotypes Columbia and Landsberg, LCAT7 (SEQ ID NO-.IO) and LCAT8 (SEQ ID NO:Ii). The LCAT7 sequence was present in both the Columbia and Landsberg genomic libraries, while the LCAT8 sequence was only present in the Columbia library.<br>
An open reading frame was predicted from the genomic sequence of LCAT7 in the Arabidopsis public database and this sequence was called MSH12 (referred to herein as LCAT5, SEQ ID NO; 73). The deduced protein sequence of LCAT5 is provided in SEQ ID NO". 74.<br>
The PSI-BLAST profile and the LCAT sequences were used to query the pubhc yeast database and proprietary libraries containing com and soy EST sequences. The yeast genome contains only one gene, LROl (LCAT Related Open reading frame, YNR008W, Figure I) with distinct similarity to the human LCAT. The DNA sequence of LROl is<br><br>
provided in SEQ ID NO: 75 and the protein sequence is provided in SEQ ID NO: 76. Seven EST sequences were identified fi-om soybean libraries as being LCAT sequences. Two sequences from soy (SEQ ID NOs: 12 and 13) are most closely related to the Arabidopsis LCATl sequence, a single sequence was identified as being most closely related to LCAT2 (SEQ ID NO; 14), three were closely related to LCAT3 (SEQ ID NOs: 15-17), and an additional single sequence was identified (SEQ ID NO: 18). A total of 11 com EST sequences were identified as being related to \hs Arabidopsis LCAT sequences. Two com EST sequences (SEQ ID NOs: 19 and 20) were most closely related to LCATl, two sequences were identified as closely related to LCAT2 (SEQ ID NOs: 21 and 22), four com EST sequences were identified as closely related to LCAT3 (SEQ ID NOs: 23-26), and an additional three com EST sequences were also identified (SEQ ID NOs: 27-29).<br>
Example 3: Identification of AC AT Sequences<br>
Since plant ACATs are unknown in the art, searches were performed to identify known and related ACAT sequences fi"om mammahan sources fi-om public databases. These sequences were then used to search public and proprietary EST databases to identify plant ACAT-like sequences.<br>
A public database containing mouse Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) sequences (dBEST) was searched for ACAT-like sequences. The search identified two sequences (SEQ ID 30and3I) which were related (approximately 20% identical), but divergent, to known ACAT sequences.<br>
In order to identify ACAT-like sequences fim other organisms, the two mouse<br>
ACAT sequences were used to search public and proprietary databases containing EST<br>
/ sequences fi"om human and rat tissues. Results of the search identified several sequences<br>
fi-om the human database and from the rat database which were closely related to the<br>
mouse sequences. The human and rat ACAT-like EST sequences were assembled, using<br>
the GCG assembly program, to construct a complete inferred cDNA sequence by<br>
identifying overlapping sequences (SEQ ID NOs: 32 and 33, respectively).<br>
/	The protein sequence of the human ACAT-like sequence was aligned with known<br>
ACAT sequences from human (Chang, ei al. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268:20747-20755, SEQ ID NO:34), mouse (Uehnen, et al. (1995) J. Biol Chem. 270:26192-26201 SEQ ID NO;35) and yeast (Yu, et al (1996) J. Biol Chem. 271:24157-24163, SEQ ID NO:36 and Yang, et al (1996) Science 272:1353-1356, SEQ ED NO:37) using MacVector (Oxford Molecular, Inc.). Results of the alignment demonstrated that the sequence was related to<br><br>
the known sequences, however the related sequence was only about 25% similar to the known sequences.<br>
The protein sequence of the human sterol O-acyltransferase (ACAT, Acyl Co A; Cholesterol acyltransferase, Accession number A48026) related sequence was used to search protein and nucleic acid Genbank databases. A single plant homologue was identified in the public Arabidopsis EST database (Accession A042298, SEQ ID NO:38). The protein sequence (SEQ ID NO:39)was translated from the EST sequence, and was found to contain a peptide sequence conserved in both mammalian and yeast ACATs (Chang et ai, (1997) Ann. Rev. Biochem., 66:613-638).<br>
To obtain the entire coding region corresponding to the Arabidopsis ACAT-like EST, synthetic oligo-nucleotide primers were designed to amplify the 5" and 3" ends of partial cDNA clones containing ACAT-like sequences. Primers were designed according to the Arabidopsis ACAT-like EST sequence and were used in Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) reactions (Frohman et ai (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:8998-9002).<br>
Primers were designed (5"-TGCAAATTGACGAGCACACCAACCCCTTC-3" (SEQ ID NO:40) and 5"-AAGGATGCTTTGAGTTCCTGACAATAGG-3" (SEQ ID N0:4I)) to amplify the 5" end from the Arabidopsis ACAT EST sequence. Amplification of flanking sequences from cDNA clones were performed using the Marathon cDNA Amplification kit (Clontech, CA).<br>
The sequence derived from the 5"-RACE amphfication was used to search proprietary v4ra6ic?op5w EST libraries. A smgle EST accession, LIB25-088-C7 (SEQ ID NO:42), was identified which contamed a sequence identical to the 5"-RACE sequence. Furthermore, LIB25-088-C7 was found to contain the complete putative coding sequence for the Arabidopsis ACAT-like product.<br>
The nucleic acid as well as the putative translation product sequences of A042298 were used to search public and proprietary databases. Four EST sequences were identified in both soybean (SEQ ID NOs:43-46) and maize (SEQ ID NOs:47-50) proprietary databases, and a single ACAT-like sequence was identified fixjm Mortierrella alpina EST sequences (SEQ ID N0:51).<br>
Sequence alignments between ACAT sequences from several different sources were compared to identify the similarity between the sequences. Nucleotide sequences from known human and mouse ACATs, as well as nucleotide sequences from known yeast ACATs were compared to the ACAT-like EST sequences fiim human and Arabidopsis,<br><br>
Analysis of the sequence ahgmnents revealed several classes of ACATs based on sequence similarity. The known human and mouse ACATs, being 88% similar in the nucleotid"e sequence, formed one class of ACATs. Another class of ACATs included the yeast ACATs which are less than 20% similar to the known human and mouse class ACATs.<br>
The final class of ACATs included the Arabidopsis and human sequences disclosed in the present invention. This class is approximately 22%o similar to the known human and mouse ACAT class and approximately 23% similar to the yeast class of ACATs. Thus, the ACAT sequences disclosed in the present invention represent a novel class of ACAT enzymes. Partial mouse sequences of this class ate also provided.<br>

The transformed insect cells were used to assay for acyltransferase activities using methods known in the art (see Example 8).<br>
Example 6: Plant Transformation<br>
A variety of methods have been developed to insert a DNA sequence of interest into the genome of a plant host to obtain the transcription or transcription and translation of the sequence to effect phenotypic changes. Transgenic plants were obtained by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation as described by Radke et al. {Theor. Appl. Genet. (1988) 75:685-694; Plant Cell Reports (1992) 77:499-505). Alternatively, microprojectile bombardment methods, such as described by Klein et al. {Bio/Technology 70:286-291) may also be used to obtein nuclear transformed plants. Other plant species may be similarly transformed using related techniques.<br>
The plant binary constructs described above were used in plant transformation to direct the expression of the sterol acyltransferases in plant tissues. Binary vector constructs were transformed into strain EHAlOl Agrobacterium cells (Hood et al., J. Bacterial (1986) 7(55:1291-1301), by the method of Holsters etal. (Mol. Gen. Genet. (1978) 7(55:181-187). Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants were obtained by Agrobacterium-mtizi&amp;d transformation as described by Valverkens et al., (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. (1988) 55:5536-5540), Bent et al. ((1994), Science 265:1856-1860), and Bechtold et al. ((1993), C. }i.Acad. Sci., Life Sciences 316:1194-1199).<br>
Example 7: Plant Assays for Modified Sterol Content/Profile 7A: NMRofT2£eed<br>
Seed from plants expressing LCAT 1 through 4 under the control of the napin promoter were analyzed by NMR. Arabidopsis seeds from transgenic plants were placed directly into wide-mouth MAS NMR sample tubes.<br><br>
High-resolution spectra were measured at II.7 T (1H=500 MHz, 13C=125 mHz) using Varian NMR Instruments (Palo Alto, CA) Inova™ NMR spectrometers equipped with carbon-observe MAS Nanoprobes™. The 13C spectra were acquired without a field-frequency lock at ambient temperahire (prox. 21-22""C) for 14 hours using the following conditions: spectral width = 29.996 kHz, acquisition time = 2.185 seconds, p/2 pulse (3.8 ms) with no relaxation delay, IH g B2 = 2.5 kHz with Waltz decoupling. Data processing conditions were typically: digital resolution = 0.11 Hz, 0.3 to 1.5 Hz line broadening and time-reversed linear prediction of the first three data points. Chemical shifts were referenced by adding neat tetramethylsilane (TMS) to Arabidopsis seeds and using the resulting referencing parameters for subsequent spectra. The 13C resolution was 2-3 Hz for the most narrow seed resonances. Spectral resolution was independent of MAS spinningspeeds(1.5-3.5kHz)anddata were typically obtained with 1.5 kHz spinning speeds. Spinning sidebands were approx. 1% of the main resonance. PhytosteroI13C assignments were based on model samples composed of triolein, P-sitosterol and cholesterol oleate. Triacylglycerol 13C assignments were made fiiam comparison with literature assignments or with shifts computed fi"om a 13C NMR database (Advanced Chemical Development, Inc., version 3.50, Toronto Canada).<br>
The results of these analyses are displayed in Figure 2 and show that there was a trend of an approximately 2 fold increase of phytosterols in the seeds derived from plant line 5 expressing the LCAT 4 gene (pCGN9998) under the control of the napin promoter. During the course of this analysis it was also noted that the average oil content of seed from plants expressing the LCAT2 construct (pCGN9983) under the control of the napin promoter was higher than that of controls. This is the first in planta evidence supporting the concept that ovcrexpression of a nucleotide sequence encoding a lecithinxholesterol acyltransferase-like polypeptide can increase oil content.<br>
7B;HPLC/MSofT2seed<br>
Seed oil from T2 plants expressing LCATl through 4 under the control of the napin promoter was extracted using an accelerated solvent extractor (ASE) method. Seed samples were ground, using a mortar and pestle, to achieve a fine homogeneous meal. Oil was obtained using a Dionex Accelerated Solvent Extractor (ASE). Clean ground seed w added to an equal amount of diatom£«;eous earth- The ground seed sample and the diatomaceous earth were thoroughly mixed until a homogeneous texture was achieved.<br><br>
The sample was then loaded into the instrument and oil extraction was achieved using hexane under validated laboratory protocols.<br>
Oil from these seed samples was then analyzed for sterol ester analysis using EIPLC/MS for &amp;ee campesterol, stigmasterol, and sitosterol and their fatty acid esters. To the autosampler vial containing approximately 0.1 grams oil was added 0.3 mLs CDCI3. One-hundred microliters of this solution was added to 900 microliters CHCI3. Five microliters of this diluted sample was subsequently injected into an HPLC/MS with positive ion atmospheric pressure ionization. The individual components in the oils were separated using two 4.6 x 50 mm Cg Zorbax columns in series and a gradient using acetonitrile and acetonitrile with 40% CHClj. The sterol concentrations were calculated assuming each sterol and its fatty acids have the same molar responses. This was observed to be the case widi cholesterol and its esters and was assumed to be the case for campesterol, stigmasterol, and sitosterol. In the present study, the sterol identified as stigmaslerol was actually an isomer of this compound.<br>
The results of these analyses are displayed in Figures 3 and 4 and show that there were sterol ester enhancements on the order of 50%. in the seeds derived from six out of seven T2 plant lines expressing LCAT3 (pCGN9968) under the control of the napin promoter.<br>

The supemalant from the transfection mixture was used for generating virus stock which in turn was used for infecting Sf9 cells used in the assay.<br>
The transformed cells were assayed for lecithin:sterol acyltransferase activities using the method described herein. Insect cells were cennifuged and the resulting cell pellet was either used immediately or stored at -70 C for later analysis. Cells were resuspended in iMedium A (100 mM Tricine/NaOH, pH 7.8,10% (w/v) glycerol, 280 mM NaCl with : 0.1 nM Aprorinin, 1 M Leupeptin, and 100 nM Pefabloc (all from Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) and lysed by sonication (2 x 10 sec). Cell walls and odier debris were pelleted by centrifugation (14,000 x g , 10 min, 4""C). The supernatant<br><br>
was transferred to a new vial and membranes pelleted by centrifugation (100,000 x g, Ti 70.1 rotor, 46,000 rpm for 1 hour at 4°C). Total membranes were resuspended in Medium A. Lecithin:sterol acyltransferase activity was assayed in a 0.1 m! reaction mixture containing 100 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7, 28 mM NaCI, 0.03% Triton X-lOO, 0.1 mM sitosterol, 20 iM l,2-["""C]-palinitoyl-phosphalidyi choline (246420 dpm/nmole), and 0.05-20 mg of membrane protein. After 15 minutes at 30 °C, thereaction was tenninaied by addinon of a 0.5 ml solution of methylene chloride:methanol (4:1, v/v) containing 100 jig cholesterol and cholesterol ester as cold carriers. A portion (0.1 ml) of the bottom organic layer was removed and evaporated under nitrogen gas. The concentrated extract was resuspended in 30 p.i of hexane and spotted onto a silica gel-G thin layer chromatographic plate. The plate was migrated m hexane:diethyl etherracetic acid (80:20:1) to the lop, then air dried. Radioactivity was determined by exposure to a Low Energy Phosphor-imaging Screen. Following exposure, the screen was read on a phosphorimager.<br>
The LCAT 4 protein from pCGN10900 in baculovinis membranes showed a radioactive spot in the region of the TLC plate where cholesterol ester migrates indicating that LCAT 4 has the ability to catalyze the transfer of an acyl group from lecithin (PC) to sitosterol to make a sitosterol ester.<br>
Example 9: Plant Assay for Modified Lipid Content<br>
Nir (near infixed spectroscopy spectral scanning) can be used to determine the total oil content of Arabidopsis seeds in a non-destructive way provided that a specfral calibration curve has been developed and validated for seed oil content. A seed oil spectral calibartion curve was developed using seed samples from 85 Arabidopsis plants. Seed was cleaned and scanned using a Foss NIR model 6500 (Foss-Nirs Systems, Inc.). Approximately 50 to 100 milligrams of whole seeds, per sample, were packed in a mini sample ring cup with quartz lens [ IH-0307 ] consisting a mini-insert [ IH-0337 ] and scanned in reflectance mode to obtain the spectral data. The seed samples were then ground, using a mortar and pestle, to achieve a fine homogeneous meal. The ground samples were measured for oil using an accelerated solvent extractor (ASE).<br>
Measurement for the total oil content was performed on the Dionex Accelerated Solvent Extractor (ASE). Approximately 500 mg of clean ground seed was weighed to the nearest 0.1 mg onto a 9 x 9 cm weigh boat. An equal amount of diatomaceous earth was added using a top-loading balance accurate to the nearest 0.01 g. The ground seed sample<br><br>
and the diatomaceous earth were thoroughly mixed until a homogeneous texture was achieved. The sample was loaded on to the instrument and oil extraction was achieved using hexane under validated Laboratory protocols. Standard Rapeseed samples were obtained from the Community Bureau of Reference (BCR). The ASE extraction method was validated using the BCR reference standards. A total percent oil recovery of 99% to 100% was achieved. "As-is" oil content was calculated to the nearest 0.01 mass percentage using the formula:<br>
Oil Content = 100% x (vial plus extracted oil wt - initial vial w[) / (sample wt)<br>
The analytical data generated by ASE were used to perform spectral calibrations. Nir calibration equations were generated using the built-in statistical pkage within the NirSytems winisi software. The spectral calibration portion of the software is capable of calibration and self-validation. From a total of 85 samples, 57 samples were used to generate the total percent oil calibration. The remaining samples were used to validate the oil calibrations. Optimized smoothing, derivative size, and mathematical treatment (modified partial least square) was utilized to generate the calibration. The samples that were not used in building respective calibrations were used as a validation set. Statistical tools such as correlation coefficient (R), coefficient of determination (R), standard error of prediction ( SEP ), and the standard error of prediction corrected for bias (SEPC) were used to evaluate the calibration equations.<br>
T2 seeds fi"om plants that had been transformed with the LCAT genes were cleaned and scanned using a Foss NIR model 6500 (Foss-Nirs Systems, Inc.). Approximately 50 to 100 miUigrams of whole seeds, per sample, were packed in a mini sample ring cup with quartz lens [ IH-0307 ] consisting a mini-insert [ IH-0337 ] and scanned in reflectance mode to obtain the spectral data. Oil percentage in each seed sample was determined using the seed oil spectral cahbration curve detailed above.<br>
The results of these analyses are found in Figure 5 and Table 2 and show that there was a significant increase in the oil level in seed from T2 plants expressing the LCAT2 gene. This increase in oil was seen in plants when LCAT2 was driven by either the 35S constitutive promoter or the seed-specific napin promoter. These results show that overexpression of a nucleic acid sequence encoding a lecithinxholesterol acyltransferase-like polypeptide can increase seed oil production in plants.<br><br><br><br><br>
