The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
1<br><br>
1205/MUM/2004<br><br>
INTERACTIVE  SYSTEM FOR ONLINE COMPLAINT REGISTRATION AND MONITORING AND METHOD THEREOF.<br>
This invention relates to the system for online registration of public complaints. More particularly the invention relates for complaints of public by networked registration and monitoring of complaints of the citizens by the police, with no or minimal human interface.<br>
The traditional method of getting the grievances of the people registered by the police department is very tedious, dilatory, non transparent and inconvenient to the people, whom the police claims to serve. Moreover, the process involves substantial human interface and discretion, which makes the process vulnerable to the curse of corruption and nepotism.<br>
It is common knowledge that often a complainants) visiting a police station and complainants(s) is made to wait for hours and sometimes for even months or years to lodge the complaints and follow up. The complainant(s)/public is treated rather shabbily and even harassed for doling and monetary favour to the policemen. Further with motive to keep the crime statistics artificially low, the police station officers often resort to burking or minimization of offences and the complainant(s) are sent back without getting his/her complaint properly registered. Even if the complainant(s) manages to get the complaint registered, there is no viable monitoring mechanism for complainants to monitor and track the status or fate of his/her complaint. This, an ordinary citizen is caught in a vicious cesspool mired by the following problems:<br>
(a)	Non-registration or burking of complaints.<br>
(b)	Non-transparent   and   non-accountable   traditional   process   of registration   of complaints.<br>
(c)	Too much discretion in the hands of police station officers, which may lead to corruption or favoritisms.<br>
(d)	The traditional process does not provide for effective, prompt and comprehensive supervision by senior police officials.<br>
(e)	In the traditional process/method there is no convenient mechanism available to the citizens/public for effective monitoring or tracking of the action on his/her<br>
1205/MUM/2004<br><br>
complaint. (N.B.: It must be emphasized that the aforesaid short comings of known<br>
art are of a general nature and may not be present in each and every case).<br>
All the aforesaid lacunae in the traditional process/method of manual registration of citizens complaints by the police are substantially over come by the present invention, which provides for online-interactive registration of complaints of the citizens/public by the police.<br>
To assist with the understanding, the invention has been illustrated with the help of accompanying drawings. Figure, 2,3 and 4. Brief description of the drawings;<br>
Fig. 1. shows a flowchart of the general procedure by which the proposed invention operates and how a complaint to the police is registered and monitored online. Fig.2. shows one of the 3 methods by which the proposed invention is implemented viz, police network (of computers) based method, including the embedded implementation code.<br>
Fig.3. shows one of the 3 methods by which the proposed invention is implemented viz, internet based auto method, including the embedded implementation code. Fig.4. shows one of the 3 methods by which the proposed invention is implemented viz, internet based manual method, including the embedded implementation code.<br>

This LAN / WAN of police offices / department is further extended by interconnecting with police network kiosks (front end terminals). The police network kiosks (front end terminal) are created at several locations, these network kiosks are accessible to public (Users) wherein the pubic can come and key in their complaints online. The interactive system generates the instant user ID and password at the time of key in of complaint. The user(s) can use system generated user ID and password for future monitoring purpose. The invented system automatically sorts the complaints jurisdiction wise and directs it in particular folder/account of to the terminal computers of the concerned police station connected via the police optical fiber or V-SAT network. The police officer (end user) designated to operate particular account of respective terminal computer of that police station. This channelising of complaints to the concerned police officer is given as the initial status of the complaint. The concerned police officer then checks his/her folder/account in the police network and acts on the online complaint(s). The police officer periodically posts the status of the complaints along with the details of final disposal of complaints to the central server of the police network.. The central server is located at central complaint cell. The central server can be accessed discretely by the complainant(s) through any of the police network kiosks using the password generated by the system, when the complaint was initially registered, (figure 2.).<br>
According to present invention an interactive system for online complaint(s) registration and monitoring comprises plurality of front-end terminals to key-in the complaint(s) online by user(s), the said front-end terminals interconnected through communication means with police network, the said police network consist central server located at central complaint cell, the plurality of terminal computers located at various police stations the said plurality of terminal computers interconnected with the central server of police network through communication means, the implementation code embedded in the said interactive system, the user(s) can key-in his complaints online directly at any front-end terminal(s), the said implementation code embedded in interactive system register complaint instantly and generate instant user ID and password<br>
1205/MUM/2004<br><br>
for each complaint, the user(s) can use user password and ID to access the status of his complaint any time from any front-end terminal, the central server process the data/ information's key-in by the user(s) and directs the process information data to respective terminal computer(s), the end-user(s) at respective terminal computers) acts on the complaints and update the information's at terminal computer after acts, the central police server process the information and update data / information's.<br>
According to present invention a method for online complaint(s) registration and monitoring by an interactive system according to claim 1 wherein the said user(s) can key-in his complaints online at any front end terminal; the invented implementation code embedded in the system automatically sorts the complaints jurisdiction wise, directs the sorted complaints in particular folder/account of respective terminal computers; theend-user(s) at respective terminal computer check the complaints regularly received in particular folder and act on complaint(s); the said respective end-user periodically update the status of complaint(s) at terminal computer online after act; the said central server of police network interconnected with terminal computers) process the data /information received from respective terminal computer after act; the process data / information updated by the implementation code embedded in system; the user(s) can access the updated status/information of his complaint(s) by using police network kiosk at any place, any time using user ID and password assigned to him by interactive system at the time of complaint key in.<br>

In this method a relevant police websites is created equipped with the feature of interactive-online registration and monitoring of complaints lodged with Police. The website is accessed on the world wide web (www) and can be access by the users (public). The prospective complainants) needs to do is to access the concerned police website and key in his complaint, address it either to<br>
1205/MUM/2004<br><br>
the central complaint cell or to the concerned police officer and just with a click of the mouse the complaint registered online.<br>
The concerned police officer of respective terminal computer then access his folder/account in the website and acts on the complaint(s) received online. The police officer periodically posts the status of complaint(s) and also the details of final disposal on the website through central server, which can be accessed directly by the complainants using the password generated by the system, when the complaint was initially registered.<br>
According to present invention a method for online complaint(s) registration and monitoring by an interactive system wherein the said user(s) can key-in his complaints online at any front end terminal; the invented implementation code embedded in the system automatically sorts the complaints jurisdiction wise, directs the sorted complaints in particular folder/account of respective terminal computers; the end-user(s) at respective terminal computer check the complaints regularly received in particular folder and act on complaint(s); the said respective end-user periodically update the status of complaint(s) at terminal computer online after act; the said central server of police network interconnected with terminal computers) process the data /information received from respective terminal computer after act; the process data / information updated by the implementation code embedded in system; the user(s) can access the updated status/information of his complaint(s) by using police network kiosk at any place, any time using user ID and password assigned to him by interactive system at the time of complaint key in.<br>
Internet based manual methods (figure 4)<br>
This method is applicable when the various police officers or various police stations do not have the access to computers and internet, (due to pacutiy of resources) while the members of public have access to internet due to shared resources like cyber cafe etc. This method is similar to method given above in internet based auto method except that subsequent to online lodging of complaints in the police website, the central complaint cell takes print outs of the complaints sorted jurisdiction wise by the system and manually directs the hard copy of the complaints to the concerned police officers. The channelising of complaint to the concerned police officer is given as the initial status of the complaint<br>
1205/MUM/2004<br><br>
by the centrals complaint cell, having access to internet and central server. The concerned police officer is required to act on the complaint(s) within the specified time frame and give periodic reports to the central complaint cell, the information/data are uploaded as the status quo of the complaint9s). Thus the need for human interaction is substantially minimized and transparency is usddhered in (Figur4).<br>
