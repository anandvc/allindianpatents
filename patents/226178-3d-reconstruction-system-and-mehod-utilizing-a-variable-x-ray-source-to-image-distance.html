				<td>3D RECONSTRUCTION SYSTEM AND METHOD<br>
UTILIZING A VARIABLE X-RAY SOURCE TO<br>
IMAGE DISTANCE<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application is related to, and claims priority from, Provisional Application Number<br>
60/332,516 filed November 23, 2001 titled "3D Reconstruction System and Method<br>
Utilizing a Variable X-ray Source to Image Distance", the complete subject matter of<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Certain embodiments of the present invention generally relate to an x-ray system capable<br>
of varying the distance between the image receptor and the x-ray source. Certain<br>
embodiments of the present invention generally relate to a mobile C-arm based x-ray<br>
system that varies the source to image distance while acquiring images for three<br>
dimensional (3D) image reconstruction.<br>
3D x-ray imaging has become increasingly useful in medical diagnostic procedures and<br>
surgical planning. Computerized Tomography (CT) was the first type of system used for<br>
these purposes. Conventional CT systems employ a fan-shaped x-ray beam directed at a<br>
detector array which has a width dimension much smaller than its length. To obtain<br>
complete scans of a significant volume of anatomy, the x-ray tube and detector array are<br>
rotated around the patient a number of times while the patient is advanced along the axis<br>
of rotation.<br>
More recently, area-beam detectors, such as image intensifiers, have been employed in<br>
icquiring 3D image data. Such systems are based on conventional x-ray systems used for<br>
cardiovascular and/or surgical interventional imaging. The advantage to such systems is<br>
hat they can acquire a full 3D dataset faster than a CT system, and thereby better capture<br>
lynamic events. For example, area-beam 3D imaging of the vessels of the brain using<br>
contrast agents has become extremely useful in the diagnosis and treatment of intra-<br>
Uranial aneurysms.<br>
Heretofore, area-beam detector 3D x-ray imaging systems have operated by rotating an x-<br>
ray tube and detector in circular paths around a central axis of rotation. The axis of<br>
rotation is positioned to be at the center of the region or volume of interest of the patient<br>
anatomy. The x-ray source and x-ray receptor, usually an image intensifier, are typically<br>
mounted on opposite ends of a rotating C-arm support assembly. The x-ray source<br>
irradiates a patient with x-rays that impinge upon a region of interest (ROI) and are<br>
attenuated by internal anatomy. The attenuated x-rays emerge from a back-side of the<br>
patient and are incident upon the receptor. 3D image data is acquired by taking a series of<br>
images as the x-ray tube/C-arm/receptor assembly is rotated about the axis of rotation on<br>
which the region of interest within the patient is centered.<br>
Conventional mobile C-arm assemblies utilize simple support structures and geometries<br>
to mount the x-ray source and the receptor on the C-arm. The support structure holds the<br>
x-ray source and receptor on the C-arm and maintains a predetermined, constant distance<br>
between the x-ray source and receptor. Hence, the distance between the x-ray source and<br>
the axis of rotation, and the distance between the receptor and the axis of rotation remain<br>
constant and fixed.<br>
However, conventional mobile C-arm assemblies experience certain problems when using<br>
an x-ray source and receptor fixedly mounted on a C-arm to generate 3D reconstruction<br>
images. The 3D reconstruction images are formed for an ROI located within a patient<br>
having an oblong cross-section (e.g., a patient laying face up on a table may have a longer<br>
width from shoulder to shoulder and a shorter height from front to back).<br>
Figs. 4-7 illustrate a conventional C-arm assembly 300 that rotates about a circular path<br>
312. The radius of the circular path 312 must be large enough to pass the widest portion<br>
of the patient's anatomy (e.g., shoulder to shoulder). Hence, during a set-up operation<br>
before acquiring a series of patient images, the patient is positioned between the image<br>
receptor 306 and x-ray source 304 to prevent the x-ray source 304 or image receptor 306<br>
from contacting the patient during any part of the rotational scan. In order to obtain<br>
patient images, the x-ray source 304 and image receptor 306 are rotated to various scan<br>
angles about the patient. Each scan angle has a corresponding trajectory through the ROI.<br>
A the scan angle vanes, the trajectory between the image receptor 306 and x-ray source<br>
304 similarly varies and, in addition, the distance between the image receptor 306 and the<br>
exit surface of the patient 308 varies considerably. The distance also varies between the<br>
x-ray source 304 and entrance surface of the patient 309.<br>
is shown in Figs. 4 and 5, the foregoing phenomenon result in a conventional C-arm<br>
assembly 300 affording a limited 3D reconstruction volume 302. The C-arm assembly<br>
300 operates in an ISO centered manner in which the RO1 within the patient remains<br>
centered within the x-ray field 303. In order to maintain the ROI centered within the x-<br>
ray field 303, the x-ray source 304 and image receptor 306 rotate about the patient along a<br>
circular arc 312. The patient is oblong shaped and thus as the x-ray source 304 and image<br>
receptor 306 rotate about a circular path, the image receptor 306 rotates from positions<br>
proximate the patient to positions remote from the patient. When the image receptor 306<br>
is located remote from the patient exit surface 308, the area of anatomy that can be<br>
imaged is limited by the geometric magnification (generally denoted by the arrow 310).<br>
Therefore the dimensions of reconstruction volume 302 are limited as well.<br>
Also, as shown in Fig. 6, the image receptor 306 is positioned a distance 314 from the<br>
patient exit surface 308. The x-rays are emitted from the x-ray source 304 in a cone beam<br>
shape and thus as the image receptor 306 is moved further from the patient, the x-ray field<br>
303 expands. Expansion of the x-ray field 303 effectively magnifies at the image<br>
receptor 306 each image obtained from the region of interest. As the distance 314<br>
increases, the amount of magnification greatly increases, particularly for images taken at<br>
scan angles associated with the shortest distance through the anatomy (e.g., front to back<br>
in the example of Figs. 4-7). The large amount of magnification associated with<br>
positioning the image receptor 306 a distance 314 remote from the patient exit surface<br>
308 causes the image to be blurred, due to the large projected penumbra of the focal spot.<br>
As the sharpness of the focal spot decreases, the quality of the 2D image data decreases,<br>
and therefore the quality of the 3D reconstructed data decreases.<br>
Further, as shown in Fig. 7, the distance from the x-ray source 304 to the image receptor<br>
306 remains constant. However, as the distance 316 decreases, the image receptor 306 is<br>
positioned farther away from the patient in some views, while the x-ray source 304 is<br>
positioned closer to the patient's skin than necessary at certain scan angles, giving rise to<br>
unnecessarily high irradiation doses.<br>
Hence, a need remains for an improved x-ray imaging system capable of reconstructing<br>
3D'volumes of patient information for a region of interest that overcomes the problems<br>
above and previously experienced.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with at least one embodiment, a medical diagnostic imaging system is<br>
provided. The system has a C-arm unit that moves an image receptor and x-ray source<br>
around a patient in non-circular arcs. The receptor and x-ray source are supported by a<br>
support structure, and at least one of the receptor and x-ray source are moveable upon the<br>
support structure, such as in a radial direction toward and away from a central axis of the<br>
support structure. The distances between at least one of the patient and source, and the<br>
patient and receptor are varied such that the receptor and/or source remain positioned<br>
within a desired distance from the patient's surface.<br>
In accordance with at least one embodiment, the medical diagnostic imaging system<br>
includes an image processor. The image processor collects image exposures at exposure<br>
positions as the receptor and x-ray source are moved around the patient. Position data<br>
corresponding to the exposure positions is collected and used, together with the image<br>
exposures, to construct a three dimensional volumetric data set. Images are displayed<br>
based upon the three dimensional volumetric data set.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Ftg. 1 illustrates an x-ray imaging system 10 that includes a C-arm 12 that is electrically<br>
connected to an x-ray generator 14, an image processing computer 16 and a tracker<br>
module 18. The tracker module 18 communicates with a tracking data processor 20<br>
which in turn communicates with the image processing computer 16 and x-ray generator<br>
14. The image processing computer 16 communicates with a monitor 48.<br>
The C-arm 12 includes an x-ray source 36 movably mounted to one side and an x-ray<br>
receptor device 34 movably mounted to the opposed side. The x-ray receptor device 34<br>
may be a flat panel detector, image intensifier and the like. The C-arm 12 is movable in<br>
several directions along multiple image acquisition paths, including, among others, an<br>
orbital tracking direction, longitudinal tracking direction, lateral tracking direction,<br>
transverse tracking direction, pivotal tracking direction, and "wig-wag" tracking<br>
direction. The orbital rotation direction is denoted by arrow A. Fig. 1 illustrates the C-<br>
arm 12, x-ray receptor device 34 and x-ray source 36 in solid lines while located at a first<br>
position (P1), and in shadow lines while located at a second position (P2). Alternatively,<br>
the C-arm 12, x-ray receptor device 34 and x-ray source 36 may be moved along image<br>
acquisition paths in the longitudinal, lateral, transverse and wig-wag tracking directions<br>
and the like. The x-ray source 36 and x-ray receptor device 34 are movable in radial<br>
directions denoted by arrows B and C, respectively.<br>
The tracker module 18 monitors the position of the patient 22, the x-ray receptor device<br>
34, and an instrument or tool 24 (if present) used by a doctor during a diagnostic or<br>
interventional surgical procedure with sensors 40-44. The tracker module 18 provides<br>
tracking component coordinates 26 with respect to each of the patient 22, x-ray receptor<br>
device 34, and instrument 24 to the tracking data processor 20. The tracking data<br>
processor 20 uses the tracking component coordinates 26 to continuously calculate the<br>
positions of the x-ray receptor device 34, patient 22 and instrument 24 with respect to a<br>
coordinate system defined relative to a coordinate system reference point or central axis.<br>
The reference point for the coordinate system is dependent, in part, upon the type of<br>
nicker module 18 to be used. The tracking data processor 20 sends control or trigger<br>
commands 28 to the x-ray generator 14 which in turn causes one or more exposures to be<br>
taken by the x-ray source 36 and x-ray receptor device 34. The tracking data processor<br>
20 provides exposure reference data 30 to the image processing computer 16. The control<br>
or tngger commands 28 and exposure reference data 30 are generated by the tracking data<br>
processor 20, as explained in more detail below, based on the tracking component<br>
coordinates 26 as the C-arm is moved along an image acquisition path.<br>
By way of example, the C-arm 12 may be manually or automatically moved between first<br>
and second positions P1 and P2 as a series of exposures are obtained. The image<br>
acquisition path may be along the orbital rotation direction and the x-ray receptor device<br>
34 may be rotated through a range of motion from 0 to 145° or from 0 to 190°.<br>
Alternatively, the image acquisition path may be along the lateral rotation.<br>
The image processing computer 16 collects a series of image exposures 32 from the<br>
receptor 34 as the C-arm 12 is rotated. The x-ray receptor device 34 collects an image<br>
exposure 32 each time the x-ray source 36 is triggered by the x-ray generator 14. The<br>
image processing computer 16 combines each image exposure 32 with corresponding<br>
exposure reference data 30 and uses the exposure reference data 30 to construct a three-<br>
dimensional volumetric data set as explained below in more detail. The three-<br>
dimensional volumetric data set is used to generate images, such as slices, of a region of<br>
nterest from the patient. For instance, the image processing computer 16 may produce<br>
"From the volumetric data set saggital, coronal and/or axial views of a patient spine, knee,<br>
and the like<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates an exemplary mobile C-arm x-ray unit 110 that may operate based on<br>
positional information entered by the operator and/or position data received from one or<br>
more sensors. The unit 110 is comprised of a mainframe 1 11, a C-arm 112, an L-arm 113<br>
and control panel 114. The lower portion of the mainframe 111 forms a T-shaped<br>
srructure, wherein casters are utilized to provide mobility of the unit 110. The mainframe<br>
111 includes a power panel 117 for controlling the coupling of power, as well as other<br>
devices, to unit 110. The mainframe 111 also includes a vertical lift column 118 that<br>
permits the C-arm 112 and L-arm 113 to move vertically in relation to mainframe 111.<br>
Vertical lift column 118 terminates in an upper housing 119, wherein horizontal extension<br>
am 120 passes through upper housing 119 and permits arm 120 to move perpendicularly<br>
it; relation to vertical lift column 118 by movement of the horizontal extension arm 120 in<br>
-elation to upper housing 119. The C-arrn 112 may be moved along the axis of the<br>
horizontal extension arm 120 to effect transverse tracking motion. The L-arm 113 is<br>
capable of pivoting (pivotal tracking motion) about the horizontal extension arm 120 such<br>
hat the L-arm 113 can be made to pivot in a 360° arc. The horizontal extension arm 120<br>
is coupled Co one end of the L-arm 113, while the other end of the L-arm 1] 3 is coupled<br>
to C-arm 112.<br>
The C-arm M2 is a C-shaped structure having an x-ray emitter 123 at one end of the C-<br>
arrh 112 and a receptor, such as image receptor 124 with a camera 125, at the other end of<br>
the C-arm 112. Alternatively, a flat panel image detector or other x-ray receptor device<br>
may be used instead of the image receptor 124 and camera 125. A collimator assembly<br>
129 may be provided for collimating the x-ray beam from the x-ray emitter 123. A spacer<br>
130 provides a safety distance that a patient may be brought within the x-ray emitter 123.<br>
Sensors 137 may be located on image receptor 124 to detect the position and/or contour<br>
of a patient.<br>
The x-ray emitter 123 is supported within an emitter bracket 127, while the image<br>
receptor 124 is supported within a receptor bracket 131. The emitter and receptor<br>
brackets 127 and 131 are automatically controlled to move the x-ray emitter 123 and<br>
image receptor 124 along radial paths (denoted by arrows B and C, respectively) toward<br>
and away from a center axis 133 that extends in a direction perpendicular to a plane<br>
containing the x-ray emitter 123 and image receptor 124. The C-arm 112 rotates about<br>
the center axis 133. The mainframe 111 includes a CPU which automatically controls the<br>
emitter bracket 127 and the receptor bracket 131 to effect radial movement of the x-ray<br>
emitter 123 and the image receptor 124, respectively. Optionally, the emitter bracket 127<br>
and the receptor bracket 131 may permit manual movement of the x-ray emitter 123 and<br>
the image receptor 124 along the radial paths B and C. The control panel 114 may permit<br>
an operator to enter parameters specifying discrete radial positions of the x-ray emitter<br>
123 and image receptor 124 associated with particular scan positions. For instance, the<br>
operator mause the control panel 114 to move the C-arm 112 to discrete scan positions<br>
and then move the x-ray emitter 123 and the image receptor 124 to corresponding radial<br>
positions. Once maximum and minimum radial positions are defined for the x-ray emitter<br>
1/3 and the image receptor 124, the mainframe 111 may then extrapolate intermediate<br>
radial positions, in relation to the center axis 133, to which the x-ray emitter 123 and the<br>
in age receptor 124 are moved for each discrete scan angle over the range of motion of<br>
the C-arm 11.<br>
Optionally, the radial position of the emitter and receptor brackets 127 and 131 may be<br>
measured and controlled through sensors 132 and 134 located on the emitter and receptor<br>
brackets 127 and 131. Optionally, the emitter and receptor brackets 127 and .131 may<br>
include stepper motors having a known reference point corresponding to a known radial<br>
relation between the C-arm and the x-ray emitter 123, and the C-arm and the image<br>
receptor 124, respectively. The mainframe 111 drives the stepper motors by a desired<br>
number of degrees or rotations to move the x-ray emitter 123 and image receptor 124<br>
desired distances toward or away from the central axis 133.<br>
The unit 110 is typically coupled to a monitoring unit wherein such monitoring unit<br>
includes equipment necessary for viewing the video image provided by the camera 125.<br>
The coupling is accomplished through cables coupled through power panel 117 of the<br>
unit 110 to the monitoring equipment, such as a video display monitoring cart, which is<br>
typically used in conjunction with C-arm x-ray unit 110. Alternatively, the monitoring<br>
equipment and video display monitoring card may be formed integral with the C-arm x-<br>
ray unit 110.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates an alternative x-ray imaging system. X-ray imaging system 200 includes<br>
a detector 210 mounted to a C-arm for detecting x-rays passed through a patient. A<br>
tracking subsystem 220 receives patient coordinate information 225, detector coordinate<br>
information 230 and instrument coordinate information 235. The tracking subsystem 220<br>
may receive the coordinate information 225-235 from a tracker module, such as from<br>
tracker module 18 in Fig. 1 or from a mainframe, such as mainframe 111 in Fig. 2. The<br>
coordinate information 225-235 generated by the tracker module 18 is based on real time<br>
measurements of the positions of the detector 210, an instrument 24 (if used) and the<br>
patient 22. The coordinate information 225-235 generated by the mainframe 11 Ms based<br>
on measurements of the position of the C-arm assembly of Fig. 2, measurements of the<br>
radial positions of the x-ray emitter 123 and image receptor 124, and previously entered<br>
radial positions of the x-ray emitter 123 and image receptor 124. The radial position of<br>
the x-ray emitter 123 and image receptor 124 may be obtained from sensors 132 and 134<br>
located on, or from stepper motors used to drive radial movement of, the emitter bracket<br>
127 and receptor bracket 131. The tracking subsystem 220 processes the coordinate<br>
information 225-235 and passes it to an image processing unit 240 which receives<br>
exposure frames from the detector 2 ] 0 and outputs image frames to the display 250. The<br>
image processing unit 240 includes a frame grabber 260 which collects exposure frames<br>
from the detector 210 at points in time dictated by the position data 245 provided from the<br>
tracking subsystem 220.<br>
The exposure frames are passed from the frame grabber 260 to the image volume<br>
processor 270 which manages storage of exposure frames in a volumetric image memory<br>
280. The image volume processor 270 constructs a three-dimensional patient data<br>
volume in the volumetric image memory 280. The 3-D patient data volume may be<br>
constructed based upon very few exposure frames, such as 10 and the like. As additional<br>
exposure frames are obtained by the frame grabber 260, the accuracy and completeness of<br>
the 3-D patient data volume is improved. In addition to constructing the 3-D patient data<br>
volume, the image volume processor 270 also constructs image slices from the volume.<br>
The slices are stored in the slice data set memory 290.<br>
The display graphics processor 295 accesses the slice data set memory 290 to display the<br>
image slices on the display 250. The display graphics processor 295 also constructs<br>
graphical representations of the instrument or tool 24 and overlays the instrument graphic<br>
with the image slices on the display 250. The display graphics processor 295 may present<br>
multiple two-dimensional image slices simultaneously on the display 250 with instrument<br>
graphics superimposed upon each image slice. Alternatively or in combination with<br>
image slices, the display graphics processor 295 may construct a three-dimensional<br>
rendering of the 3-D patient data volume and display the three-dimensional rendering on<br>
the display 250 separately or in combination with a three-dimensional graphical<br>
representation of the instrument 24. The three-dimensional patient image and three-<br>
dimensional instrument graphic may be controlled to rotate (in a video-type format) to<br>
permit viewing of the patient data volume from multiple angles and to permit viewing of<br>
the instrumert graphic from multiple angles. Rotation of the three-dimensionally<br>
displayed patient data volume may be automatic, such as in a simulated video format, or<br>
may be contrciied manually in a stepwise manner by the operator of the system. For<br>
example, the operator may rotate the image(s) by clicking on the region of interest with a<br>
mouse and dragging the image to cause rotation and/or translation.<br>
Optionally, the C-arm assembly may control radial motion of the x-ray emitter 123 and/or<br>
image receptor 124 based on "capacitive sensing" for patient contour mapping. For<br>
example, sensors 137 may be located on or proximate the imaging plane of the image<br>
receptor 124. During a 3D acquisition procedure, as the C-arm assembly is rotated<br>
through a scan range, the sensors 137 delect the position and/or contour of the patient<br>
surface. The sensors 137 provide the position/contour information as feedback to the<br>
mainframe 111. The mainframe 111 uses the position/contour information to drive the<br>
receptor bracket 131 and move the image receptor 124 radially in the direction of arrow<br>
C. The mainframe 111 drives the receptor bracket 131 in a manner to attempt to retain an<br>
imaging plane of the image receptor 124 within a close tolerance, or a predefined<br>
distance of the patient's surface. Similarly, the mainframe 111 drives the emitter bracket<br>
127 and moves the x-ray emitter 123 radially in the direction of arrow B to maintain a<br>
uniform distance between the x-ray emitter 123 and the image receptor 124.<br>
For example, the sensors 137 may represent pairs of LED emitters and detectors located<br>
on opposite sides of the image receptor 124, with multiple LED emitter/detector pairs<br>
spaced different distances from the imaging plane of the image receptor 124. The image<br>
receptor 124 may be driven radially toward the patient until an outer LED<br>
emitter/receptor pair (e.g., located furthest from the imaging plane) is broken by the<br>
patient's surface, but an inner LED emitter/receptor pair (e.g., located closest to the<br>
imaging plane) remains unbroken. Once the outer LED emitter/receptor pair is broken,<br>
the receptor bracket 131 is stopped. The x-ray emitter 123 may then be driven radially<br>
away from the patient until a desired distance between the x-ray emitter 123 and image<br>
receptor 1 24 is obtained. Optionally, x-ray emitter 123 may be driven radially away from<br>
the patient simultaneously as the image receptor 124 is driven towards the patient. Once<br>
the image receptor 124 and x-ray emitter 123 are in position, a patient image is obtained.<br>
After the patient image is obtained, the C-arm is moved to the next angular scan position<br>
and the image receptor 124 is moved radially toward or away from the patient. By way of<br>
example only, as the C-arm is moved from an angular position proximate a patient's side<br>
to an angular position above the patient's chest, the image receptor 124 becomes<br>
positioned further from the patient's surface. Hence, the patient's surface no longer<br>
interrupts the sensors 137, or outer LED emitter/receptor pair. The sensors 137 feed this<br>
information to the mainframe 111 which in turn drives the receptor bracket 131 to move<br>
the image receptor 124 radially inward toward the patient's chest. The image receptor<br>
124 is moved inward until the outer LED emitter/receptor pair is again broken by the<br>
patient's surface.<br>
Optionally, the sensors 137 (Fig. 2) may be electromagnetic, ultrasound or otherwise.<br>
Electromagnetic sensors continuously detect the absolute distance between the image<br>
receptor 124 and the patient. Optionally, sensors 137 may be used to detect and control<br>
the position of the x-ray emitter 123 relative to the patient.<br>
Figs. 8-10 illustrate an x-ray assembly 400 at different scan angles 408-416 and with the<br>
image receptor 402 and x-ray source 404 moved to different radial distances 420-431<br>
from the patient 406. As shown in Fig. 8, the x-ray assembly 400 when initially located<br>
at scan angle 408, the image receptor 402 is spaced a distance 420 from the surface of the<br>
patient 406. Once the x-ray assembly 400 is rotated to the scan angle 409, the image<br>
receptor 402 is moved radially outward to prevent the image receptor 402 from contacting<br>
the patient 406. When at scan angles 409 and 410, the image receptor 402 is located<br>
distances 421 and 422, respectively from the patient 406. The x-ray source 404 may also<br>
be moved radially to maintain a desired distance between the x-ray source 404 and the<br>
image receptor 402.<br>
As shown in Fig. 9, the distance 423-427 is varied between the x-ray source 404 and the<br>
patsent 406, and the image receptor 402 and the patient 406 when moved between the<br>
scan angles 411-415. When the x-ray assembly 400 is at scan angle 411, the x-ray source<br>
404 is located at a radial distance 423 from the patient 406. When the x-ray assembly 400<br>
is rotated to scan angle 412, the image receptor 402 is moved radially inward towards the<br>
paint 406, and she x-ray source 404 is moved radially outward to distance 424 in order<br>
to maintain the desired distance between the x-ray source 404 and the image receptor 402.<br>
When at scan angles 413, 414, and 415, the x-ray source 404 is moved radially to<br>
dis ances 425, 426, and 427, respectively. Alternatively, as shown in Fig, 10, the x-ray<br>
souce 404 is moved radially in the direction of arrow 43S from a first position located a<br>
distarce 431 from the patient to a second position located a distance 430 from the patient.<br>
Therefore, it should be understood that the x-ray source 404 and the image receptor 402<br>
may be moved independently to increase or decrease the radial distance between the<br>
image receptor 402 and the x-ray source 404, and/or the radial distance between the x-ray<br>
source 404 or image receptor 402 and the patient 406.<br>
While particular elements, embodiments and applications of the present invention have been<br>

thereto since modifications may be made by those skilled in the art, particularly in light of<br>
