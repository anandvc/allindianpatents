				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an air conditioner installing an indoor unit and an outdoor unit of heat cycle<br>
together within a one casing or housing thereof, and in<br>
particular a single-unit type air conditioner  having<br>
at least two openings for blowing out conditioned air into a room.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART<br>
Conventionally, there is already known an air conditioner which installs an indoor unit and an outdoor unit of the heat cycle together within a one casing or housing thereof, for forming them as an unit to be installed or fitted on a windowsill for example. As an example of such the air conditioner of one unit type, in Japanese Laying-open of Utility Model Application No. Sho 59-18214 (1984), there is disclosed an air conditioner, which has a sirocco fan divided into two scroll portions thereof for blowing out the cooled air into the room, through two air outlet openings being provided on a surface of the case at both sides thereof (i.e., at the right-hand side and the left-hand side thereof). With such the construction mentioned above, the air in the room is sucked in or inhaled from a center of the case (i.e., an air in-taking or inlet opening which is formed in a center of the case surface), and then is blown back into the room<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
through the outlet openings at the both sides, thereby achieving an effect of improving of the temperature distribution inside the room (i.e., cooling down or warming up the room temperature).<br>
For realizing such the construction with the most simple manner, a pair of wind paths are formed in symmetry at left and right by means of an inner casing provided in the housing, while positioning the indoor fan, such as the sirocco fan, on a central axis of the air conditioner, in particular, of the main case body thereof.<br>
However, in an actual product of such the air conditioner of one unit type, in particular in which the wind paths are formed in symmetry at left and right, upon requirement of making such the air conditioner of one unit type compact in size, i.e., small-sizing, sometimes it is difficult to position the indoor fan on the central axis of the main case body. In such the instance, there must be provided any means to divide the air and to lead it to the outlet openings at the both sides thereof equally, however it needs rather large space therein. While, if the larger space is needed for obtaining uniform or equal wind volume at the air outlet openings of the both ends, on the other hand, it becomes difficult to maintain sufficient gaps or distances between the electric parts therein and the inner casing defining the wind paths therein. If they come up to each other closely, dewdrops are condensed in the vicinity of the electric parts, in particular when the conditioner is under the cooling operation.  Namely, there is still a possibility<br><br>
- 3 -that the condensed dewdrops enter into the electric parts,<br>
thereby bringing about mall-function or breakdown of the air conditioner.<br>
Further, with the construction of the conventional air conditioner, in particular of the one unit type, to which the present invention relates, there occurs a phenomenon, so-called "short-circuit", where the air blown out from the air outlet openings at both sides returns back to the air inlet opening to be sucked in again, directly, thereby causing a problem of decreasing the air conditioning power,  i.e., cooling or warming power of the air. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, an object according to the present invention, for dissolving such the problems mentioned in the above, is to provide an air conditioner of one unit type, with which can be obtained a small- or compact-sizing of the air conditioner, in particular in which the indoor fan is positioned being shifted to either side in the housing body thereof.<br>
Further, another object according to the present invention is to provide an air conditioner of one unit type, which can be constructed or assembled with ease, while obtaining even wind volumes at the both side of the outlet opening thereof.<br>
Further, other object according to the present invention is also to provide an air conditioner of one unit type, which has superiority in mechanical strength thereof, in particular being preferable in the assembling process<br><br>

5.<br>
Further,  according  to  the  present  invention,  there  is provided  the single-unit type air conditioner as defined  above, wherein an amount of air blown out from said first air blow outlet is larger than that blown out from said second air blow oulet.<br>
Furthermore,  according to the present invention,  there  is provided  the  single-unit  type air conditioner  as  defined  above wherein  said  first  air blow outlet and said  second  air  blow sutlet ara stubstantial ly same to each other in sizes thereof.<br>

Hereinafter, embodiments according to the present invention will be fully explained by referring to the attached drawings.<br>
A first embodiment according to the present invention will be described by referring to Figs. 1 through 4.<br><br>
-                          -8-<br>
By referring to Fig. 1 showing an air conditioner of one unit type of the first embodiment according to the present invention, the air conditioner 10 comprises an indoor fan 1 which is positioned in the inner side of a casing or housing body (or main body of the air conditioner) 11, an indoor heat exchanger 4 which is positioned in front of the indoor fan 1, and an inner casing 7 for forming a pair of air blow or wind paths to left and right therein.  The indoor fan 1 is connected to a fan motor 3 which is provided behind a partition plate 9, and further the fan motor 3 is connected to an outdoor fan 2,  so as to drive them rotationally. Furthermore, for completing a heat cycle, there are further provided a compressor 6 and an outdoor heat exchanger 5, in addition to the indoor heat exchanger 4, positioning the compressor 6 at the center of the others, i.e., between the indoor heat exchanger 4 and the outdoor heat exchanger 5. Among those are connected or piped with cycle pipes  8 circularly.  The air conditioner 10 is divided into an indoor side (lower side in the drawing) and an outdoor side (upper side in the drawing) with the above partition plate 9.<br>
As is apparent from Fig. 1, since the compressor 6 occupies a portion or position within the housing body (i.e., main body of the air conditioner) 11, it is difficult to position the indoor fan 1 within the housing body 11 in symmetry, i.e., on or along the central axis (indicated by a one-dotted line C in the drawing), in particular with maintaining a sufficient distance between the indoor fan 1 and the peripheral parts thereof (i.e., the compressor 6 and<br><br>
- 9 -the cycle pipes 8), therefore, the indoor fan 1 is positioned<br>
shifting from the central axis C for obtaining the air conditioner 10 of compact-size, in particular, for small-sizing the casing body 11 thereof.<br>
Next, with the construction of the air conditioner mentioned above, operations of it will be explained below.<br>
In the indoor side of the air conditioner 10, the air sucked in from the room through the indoor heat exchanger 4 which is positioned in front of the indoor fan 1 is divided by the inner casing 7 into two (2) flows thereof. Namely, the air, after being conditioned or cooled down in the temperature thereof when passing through the indoor heat exchanger 4, they are divided and blown back to the room again, from two (2) air outlet openings which are provided at both sides, i.e., at the left-hand side and the right-hand side, on a front surface of the air conditioner 10, in particular of the casing body 11 thereof.<br>
In this instance, according to the present invention, though the indoor fan 1 is positioned shifting from the central axis of the one-dotted line C as shown in Fig. 1, however, the inner casing 7 forming the wind paths therein is not in symmetry in the configuration thereof. In more details, as can be seen in particular from Fig. 2, the wind paths which are defined within the inner casing 7, in particular with the inner surface thereof, being indicated by broken lines in Fig. 2, have the respective configurations, being different from each other between the left-hand side and the right-hand side thereof, i.e., in the shapes, the<br><br>
- 10-sizes, the areas of the cross sections, and/or the lengths thereof. Namely, by changing or differing the respective configurations of the wind paths defined by the inner casing 7, it is possible to o regulate the winds blowing out through the outlet openings provided at both sides of the air conditioner 10, in particular in volumes thereof.<br>
In Fig. 2, the indoor fan 1 is positioned by shifting (for example, from 17 to 35 mm) from the central axis of the air conditioner 10 or the casing body 11 thereof, and the wind volumes at the outlet openings for blowing out the winds are adjusted by differing the configurations, i.e., the shapes, the sizes, the cross-section areas, and/or the lengths of the wind paths defined by the inner casing 7 at the both sides. However, in the present embodiment, as can be seen from Fig. 2, the two air outlet openings provided at both sides in symmetric on the front surface of the casing body 11 are formed with the sizes being substantially same to each other.<br>
Further, by referring to Fig. 3 showing the air conditioner 10 according to the first embodiment of the present invention in a perspective view thereof, it is apparent that an air inlet opening 13 for sucking in the room air is positioned or formed around at the center on the front surface of the air conditioner 10, while a first outlet opening 14a and a second outlet opening 14b for blowing out the conditioned air is positioned or formed almost in symmetric with each other and with the same sizes (for example, opening width 66 mm for each), at the left side and<br><br>
the right side of the front surface thereof. And, in this figure, a reference numeral 15 indicates an electric part of the air conditioner 10, including a controller of a microcomputer, etc.<br>
With such the construction mentioned above, i.e., with the indoor fan 1 shifting from the central axis, however, according to the present invention, it is possible to adjust or regulate the wind volumes at the first outlet opening 14a and the second outlet opening 14b at desire, by changing and determining the respective configurations thereof, i.e., the shapes, the sizes, the cross-section areas, and/or the lengths of the wind paths, which are defined within the inner casing 7 at the both sides, appropriately.<br>
Further, Fig. 4 shows a perspective view of the inner casing 7 which is formed from styrene form or expanded polystyrene, together with the electric part 15 of the air conditioner 10, according to the first embodiment of the present invention. As is also apparent from this figure, the first outlet opening 14a and the second outlet opening 14b of the inner casing 7 are positioned in symmetric with each other at the both side thereof, and the electric part 15 is positioned within the space which is defined just below the first outlet opening 14a.<br>
With such the construction, as mentioned in the above, it is possible to adjust or regulate the wind velocities at the first outlet opening 14a and the second outlet opening 14b of the inner casing 7, respectively. Therefore, by differing them, in particular, by making the wind volume at<br><br>
-12-<br><br>
the first outlet opening 14a a little bit higher than that of the second outlet opening 14b, it is possible to prevent from condensation of dewdrops or to reduce the amount thereof at the first outlet opening 14a which is neighboring or adjacent to the electric part 15 to be protected from introduction of such the dewdrops therein.<br>
However, when making the wind volume blowing out from the first outlet opening 14a higher than that of the second outlet opening 14b, it gives separate or strange feelings to a person standing in front of the air conditioner 10, being different from the left-hand side to the right-hand side thereof. Therefore, according to the present invention, it is preferable that the wind volumes, blowing out from the first outlet opening 14a higher than that of the second outlet opening 14b, be regulated within the ratio from 5:5 to 6:4. With such the range of volume difference of wind, however, the difference in the wind temperatures between the first outlet opening 14a and the second outlet opening 14b<br>
can be suppressed within 1 °C, giving no such the separate nor strange feelings.<br>
Next, a second embodiment according to the present invention will be described by referring to Figs. 5 through 10, wherein the same reference numerals in those figures indicate the same elements as in the first embodiment shown in Figs. 1 through 4 in the above.<br>
In this second embodiment, there is described a more concrete indexes of the shapes of the air conditioner 10, in<br><br>
13<br>
particular, the sizes of the main body 11, the diameter and the sizes of various portions of the indoor fan 1, as well as a relationship thereof.<br>
In Fig. 5 showing an air conditioner of one unit type of the second embodiment according to the present invention, also the air conditioner 10 comprises the indoor fan 1 which is positioned in the inner side of the housing body (or main body of the air conditioner) 11, the indoor heat exchanger 4 which is positioned in front of the indoor fan 1, and the inner casing 7 for forming air blow path therein.  The indoor fan 1 is connected to the fan motor 3 which is provided behind the partition plate 9, and further the fan motor 3 is connected  to  the  outdoor  fan  2,  so  as  to  drive  them rotationally.  Furthermore, as the refrigerating cycle, there are also provided the compressor 6 and the outdoor heat exchanger 5 in addition to the indoor heat exchanger 4, positioning the compressor 6 at the center of the others, i.e., between the indoor heat exchanger 4 and the outdoor heat exchanger 5.  Among those are also connected or piped with the cycle pipes 8 circularly.  The air conditioner 10 is divided into the indoor side (lower side in the drawing) and the outdoor side (upper side in the drawing) with the above partition plate 9.<br>
Also as is apparent from Fig. 5, since the compressor 6 occupies a portion or position within the housing body (i.e., main body of the air conditioner) 11, it is difficult to position the indoor fan 1 within the housing body 11 in symmetry,  in  particular  with  maintaining  a  sufficient<br><br>
- 14-_<br>
distance between the indoor fan 1 and the peripheral parts thereof (i.e., the compressor 6 and the cycle pipes 8) , therefore it is positioned with shifting from a central axis {indicated by a one-dotted line C in the drawing) for obtaining the air conditioner 10 of compact-size, in particular, for small-sizing the casing body 11 thereof.<br>
Next, with the construction of the air conditioner mentioned above, also operations thereof will be explained, below.<br>
In the indoor side of the air conditioner 10, the air sucked in from the room through the indoor heat exchanger 4 which is positioned in front of the indoor fan 1 is divided by the inner casing 7 into two (2) flows thereof. Namely, the air, after being conditioned or cooled down in the temperature thereof when passing through the indoor heat exchanger 4, they are divided and blown back to the room again, from two (2) air outlet openings which are provided at both sides, i.e., at the left-hand side and the right-hand side, on a front surface of the air conditioner 10, in particular of the casing body 11 thereof.<br>
In this instance, according to the present invention, though the indoor fan 1 is positioned shifting from the central axis of the one-dotted line C as shown in Fig. 5, however, the inner casing 7 forming the wind paths therein is not in symmetry in the configuration thereof. In more details, the wind paths which are defined by the inner casing 7 have the respective configurations, being different from each other between the left-hand side and the right-hand side<br><br>
-15 -<br>
thereof, i.e., in the shapes, the sizes, the areas of the cross sections, and the lengths thereof. Namely, by changing the respective configurations of the wind paths defined by the inner casing 7, it is possible to regulate or equalize the winds blowing through the openings provided at both sides of the air conditioner 10, in particular in velocities or volumes thereof.<br>
From Fig. 6 showing the perspective view of the main body 11 of the air conditioner 10 according to the second embodiment of the present invention, it is apparent that the outlet openings 14a and 14b of the same shapes and sizes are formed or positioned in symmetric at the left-hand side and the right-hand side thereof, with respect to the inlet opening 13 which is formed or positioned around at the central portion of the main body 11, in particular on the central axis of the front surface thereof.<br>
Further, Fig. 7 (a) shows a front view of the air conditioner 10 of the above second embodiment, and 7 (b) shows a front view of an air conditioner 10 of a variation of the second embodiment. From both of those embodiment and the variation, also it is apparent that the outlet openings 14a and 14b of the same shapes and sizes are formed or positioned in symmetry, at left-hand side and the right-hand side in Fig. 7 (a), while at the upper side and the lower side in Fig. 7 (b), with respect to the inlet opening 13 which is formed or positioned around at the central portion of the main body 11, in spite of positional shifting of the indoor fan 1 from the central axis.<br><br>
-16-Further, Fig. 8 shows details of the inner casing 7<br>
with exploded condition thereof, wherein the inner casing 7 is constructed with a first casing portion 71 which is positioned below the indoor heat exchanger 4, a second casing portion 72 which extends from the upper portion of the first casing portion 71 up to around the central portion of the indoor fan 1, and a third casing portion 73 which is positioned on the second casing portion 72. Those portions of the inner casing 7 are also formed from the styrene from or expanded polystyrene as mentioned above.<br>
With such the construction of the inner casing 7, it can be assembled in an order, i.e., the first casing portion 71, the indoor heat exchanger 4, the second casing portion 72, and the third casing portion 73 from an upper side thereof, with ease, therefore having a superiority in assembling process thereof. In particular, the inner casing 7 can be assembled by checking or ascertaining the distances or gaps between the indoor fan 1, etc., when the second casing portion 72 is assembled on the first one.<br>
Figs. 9 (a) and (b) show examples of the shape of the air conditioner 10 according to the present invention, in particular the sizes, including a height H and a width W thereof, and the diameter D of the indoor fan 1, and a relationship between them. From experiences made by the inventors of the present invention, when assuming that the height H of the air conditioner 10 is 1, the width W is selected from 1 to 5 and the diameter D from 0.05 to 0.95 {in Fig. 9 (a) ) , and the width W is selected from 0.7 to 3 and<br><br>
17<br>
the diameter D from 0.3 to 0.95 {in Fig. 9 (b)). More preferably, the width W is to be about from 1 to 2, and the diameter D is preferable to be about from 0.5 to 0.8. Further, for an information, the depth D of the air conditioner 10 is about from 1.5 to 2.0 with respect to the height H. For an information, for example, the sizes of the air conditioner 10 are 560 mm in the width, 375 mm in the height, and 665 mm in the depth, or are 470 mm in the width, 345 mm in the height, and 575 mm in the depth in another, with the air outlet openings at the both sides, each being 66 mm in the width.<br>
Further, Fig. 10 also shows an example of the sizes of the wind paths in the air conditioner 10 according to the present invention. In particular, the wind paths formed in the inner casing 7 is indicated by the broken line in the figure, and there are also shown the values of the gaps or distances at the narrowest between the inner surface of the inner casing 7 and the outer diameter of the indoor fan 1. Those gaps or distances Gl, G2, as being explained in the above, can be adjusted or regulated with ease, when the inner casing 7 is assembled, in particular when the second casing portion 72 is assembled on the first one. And, from the experiments, assuming the diameter D is 1, the narrowest gap Gl at the left-hand side is preferable to be from 0.05 up to 0.2, while the narrowest gap G2 at the right-hand side from 0.1 up to 0.3.<br>
According to the present invention, in particular the second embodiment thereof, it is possible to equalize or even<br><br>
-18-<br>
the volumes of the wind blowing out from the outlet openings 14a and 14b almost symmetrically at the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the air conditioner 10, in particular on the front surface of the case body 11 thereof.<br>
Next, a third embodiment according to the present invention will be described by referring to Figs. 11 through 13, wherein the same reference numerals in those figures indicate the same elements as in the first and second embodiments shown in Figs. 1 through 10 in the above.<br>
According to this third embodiment, as is apparent from Figs. 11 through 13 showing the perspective views of the inner constructions of the air conditioner thereof, there is further provided a supporting plate 120, other than the indoor fan 1, the outdoor fan 2, the fan motor 3, the indoor heat exchanger 4, the outdoor heat exchanger 5, the compressor 6, the inner casing 7 including the portions 71, 72 and 73 thereof, and the partition plate 9, being mounted on a base 100.<br>
By referring to Fig. 11 showing a one example of the third embodiment, the supporting plate 120, being made from a steel plate for example, is connected with a cover 110 of the outdoor fan 2 at the top portion thereof, for example by a screw (not shown), and is extended therefrom crossing over the top of the partition plate 9, to the indoor heat exchanger 4 to be connected at the top portion by a screw (not shown) through a cutting portion of the inner casing 7 (see a reference numeral 7 5 in the above Fig. 4), but with being a little bit shifted near to the compressor 6.   The<br><br>
19 supporting plate 120 also can be connected or screwed with<br>
the partition plate 9 at the top thereof.<br>
With such the construction, the outdoor fan 2, in particular, the cover 110 thereof and the indoor heat exchanger 4, and also the partition plate 9 are connected to the supporting plate 120 together, thereby increasing productivity in the assembling thereof, as well as maintaining or securing the gaps necessary among the indoor heat exchanger 4, the inner casing 7 and the indoor fan 1, and also the distance necessary between the outdoor fan 2 and the cover 110 of the outdoor fan 2. And, with the supporting plate 120, it is needless to say the main body of the air conditioner 10 itself can be increased in the mechanical strength thereof, thereby protecting from cutting or severing of the pipes or conduits, in particular, in the periphery of the heat exchanger and/or the condenser by being shifted or moved therewith in the main body.<br>
By referring to Fig. 12 showing a variation of the third embodiment, the supporting plate 120 is connected with the cover 110 of the outdoor fan 2 at the top portion thereof, and is also extended therefrom crossing over the partition plate 9, up to the indoor heat exchanger 4 to be connected at the top portion thereof. Further, in this variation, there is further provided fixing plates 130 which connect or fix between the base 100 and the indoor heat exchanger 4 therewith.<br>
With the construction of this variation, being apparent therefrom, by also connecting or fixing between the base 100<br><br>
- 20- . and the indoor heat exchanger 4, it is further possible to<br>
maintain or secure the gaps necessary among the indoor heat exchanger 4, the inner casing 7 and the indoor fan 1, with higher certainty, and further to increase the mechanical strength of the air conditioner 10 itself.<br>
Further by referring to Fig. 13 showing an another variation of the third embodiment, the supporting plate 120 is connected, not directly with the outdoor fan 2, but with the outdoor heat exchanger 5 with which is connected the cover 110 of the outdoor fan 2, at the top portion thereof. However, the supporting plate 120 is also extended therefrom crossing over the partition plate 9, up to the indoor heat exchanger 4 to be connected at the top portions thereof.<br>
With the construction of this variation, also being apparent therefrom, by connecting or fixing the indoor heat exchanger 4, the partition plate 9 and the outdoor heat exchanger 5 together, it is possible to increase the productivity in the assembling thereof, as well as maintaining or securing the gaps necessary among the indoor heat exchanger 4, the inner casing 7 and the indoor fan 1, and also the distance necessary between the outdoor fan 2 and the cover 110 of the outdoor fan 2. And, with the supporting plate 120, it is needless to say the main body of the air conditioner 10 itself can be increased in the mechanical strength thereof.<br>
Finally, a fourth embodiment according to the present invention will be described by referring to Figs. 14 and 15, wherein also the same reference numerals in those figures<br><br>
indicate the same elements as in the various embodiments shown in Figs. 1 through 13 in the above.<br>
As apparent from the Fig. 14 showing the perspective view of the air conditioner 10 of the fourth embodiment, the air conditioner 10 is constructed with a cabinet, i.e., the main body of the air conditioner 10 itself, and a surface cover 200 attached on the front surface thereof.<br>
Within the cabinet 10, not shown in those figures, however, there are of course mounted or installed with the compressor, the heat exchangers, the fan motor, the fans and electric parts thereof on the base, in such the manner mentioned in the above.<br>
While, the surface cover 200 are formed with an air inlet grill 210 and a pair of air outlet grills 220 at both sides thereof, i.e., at the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the air inlet grill 210. Between the depth H2 of the air outlet grill 220 and the depth H1 of the air inlet grill 210, there is established a relationship that the former is greater than the latter, i.e., Hl&gt;H2. Further, the air inlet grill 210 has a surface being curved in the shape of an arc, i.e., gradually increasing the depth from the depth H2 at the both sides up to the central portion (i.e., H1) of the surface cover 200.<br>
Further, as apparent in Fig. 15 showing the cross-section view of the air conditioner 10 according to the fourth embodiment, the filter 3 00 is positioned behind the air inlet grill 210, and a filter guide 310 is provided between ,the air inlet grill 210 and the filter 300,  for<br><br>
22<br>
maintaining a predetermined distance L between them.<br>
With the construction mentioned in the above, since the depth H2 of the air outlet grill 220 is so designed that it is lower than the depth Hi of the air inlet grill 210, therefore, it is difficult to cause a phenomenon called "short-circuit", where the conditioned air (i.e., cooled or warmed air) sent out from the air outlet grills 220 is directly returned back to the air inlet grill 210 to be sucked in again. Therefore, it is possible to perform the conditioning function of the air in the room, without decreasing the air conditioning power, i.e., air cooling or warming power.<br>
Further, the air inlet grill 210 is curved in the arc shape, therefore, the area for sucking in the air can be maintained larger, thereby decreasing a ventilation resistance. Moreover, with such the construction, it is also possible to make the distance L between the filter 300 and the air inlet grill 210 as well as to make the air sucking area larger, therefore the wind passing through the air inlet grill 210 comes to be slower in the air volume or velocity thereof. Namely, with this, the wind passing through the air inlet grill 210 is reluctant to drag in the blow-out winds from the outlets 220 of both sides, and the filter 300 is not easily clogged, thereby obtaining protection from decreasing in the amount of wind and enabling to keep or maintain the initial performance of the air conditioner, for a long time period, without decrease thereof.<br><br>
                                  23<br>
