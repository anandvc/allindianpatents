				<td>MODIFICATION OF ALKALINE EARTH SILICATE FIBRES<br>
This invention relates to alkaline earth silicate fibres.<br>
Inorganic fibrous materials are well known and widely used for many purposes (e.g. as<br>
thermal or acoustic insulation in bulk, mat, or blanket form, as vacuum formed shapes, as<br>
vacuum formed boards and papers, and as ropes, yams or textiles; as a reinforcing fibre for<br>
building materials; as a constituent of brake blocks for vehicles). In most of these<br>
applications the properties for which inorganic fibrous materials are used require resistance to<br>
heat, and often resistance to aggressive chemical environments.<br>
Inorganic fibrous materials can be cither glassy or crystalline. Asbestos is an inorganic<br>
fibrous material one form of which has been strongly implicated in respiratory disease.<br>
It is still not clear what the causative mechanism is that relates some asbestos with disease but<br>
some researchers believe that the mechanism is mechanical and size related. Asbestos of a<br>
critical size can pierce cells in the body and so, through long and repeated cell injury, have a<br>
bad effect on health. Whether this mechanism is true or not regulatory agencies have<br>
indicated a desire to categorise any inorganic fibre product that has a respiratory fraction as<br>
hazardous, regardless of whether there is any evidence to support such categorisation.<br>
Unfortunately for many of the applications for which inorganic fibres are used, there are no<br>
realistic substitutes.<br>
Accordingly there is a demand for inorganic fibres that will pose as little risk as possible (if<br>
any) and for which there are objective grounds to believe them safe.<br>
A Line of study has proposed that if inorganic fibres were made that were sufficiently soluble<br>
in physiological fluids that their residence time in the human body was short; then'damage<br>
would not occur or at least be minimised. As the risk of asbestos linked disease appears to<br>
depend very much on the length of exposure this idea appears reasonable. Asbestos is<br>
extremely insoluble.<br>
As intercellular fluid is saline in nature the importance of fibre solubility in saline solution<br>
has long been recognised. If fibres are soluble io physiological sahne solution then, provided<br>
the dissolved components are not toxic, the fibres should be safer than fibres which are not so<br>
soluble. Alkaline earth silicate fibres have been proposed for use as saline soluble, nonmetallic,<br>
amorphous, inorganic oxide, refractory fibrous materials. The invention particularly<br>
relates to glassy alkaline earth silicate fibres having silica as their principal constituent.<br>
International Patent Application No. WO87/05007 disclosed that fibres comprising magnesia,<br>
silica, calcia and less than 10 wt% alumina are soluble in saline solution. The solubilities of<br>
the fibres disclosed were in terms of parts per million of silicon (extracted from the silica<br>
containing material of the fibre) present in a saline solution after 5 hours of exposure.<br>
W087/05007 stated that pure materials should be used and gave an upper limit of 2wt% in<br>
aggregate to the impurities that could be present No mention of alkali metals was made in<br>
this patent.<br>
International Patent Application No. W089/12032 disclosed additional fibres soluble in<br>
saline solution and discusses some of the constituents that may be present in such fibres. This<br>
disclosed the addition of NajO in amounts ranging from 0.28 to 6.84wt% but gave no<br>
indication that the presence of NaiO had any effect.<br>
European Patent Application No. 0399320 disclosed glass fibres having a high physiological<br>
solubility and having 10-20mol% NaiO and 0-5mol% KjO. Although these fibres were<br>
shown to be physiologically soluble their maximum use temperature was not indicated.<br>
Further patent specifications disclosing selection of fibres for their saline solubility include<br>
for example European 0412878 and 0459897, French 2662687 and 2662688, PCT<br>
W086/04S07, WO90/02713, W092/09536, WO93/22251, W094/15883,-W097/16386 and<br>
United States 5250488.<br>
The refractoriness of the fibres disclosed in these various prior art documents varies<br>
considerably and for these alkaline earth silicate materials the properties are critically<br>
dependent upon composition.<br>
As a generality, it is relatively easy to produce alkaline earth silicate fibres that perform well<br>
at low temperatures, since for low temperature use one can provide additives such as boron<br>
oxide to ensure good fiberisation and vary the amounts of the components to suit desired<br>
material properties. However, as one seeks to raise the refractoriness of alkaline earth silicate<br>
fibres, one is forced to reduce the use of additives since in general (albeit with exceptions) the<br>
more components are present, the lower the refractoriness.<br>
W093/15028 disclosed fibres comprising CaO, MgO, SiOj, and optionally ZrO? as principal<br>
constituents. Such fibres are frequently known as CMS (calcium magnesium silicate) or<br>
CMZS ((calcium magnesium zirconium silicate) fibres. WO93/15028 required that the<br>
compositions used should be essentially free of alkali metal oxides. Amounts of up to<br>
0.65wt% were shown to be acceptable for materials suitable for use as insulation at 1000°C.<br>
WO93/15028 also required low levels of A12O3 (
W094/15883 disclosed a number of such fibres usable as refractory insulation at<br>
temperatures of up to 1260°C or more. As with WO93/15028, this patent required that the<br>
alkali metal oxide content should be kept low, but indicated that some alkaline earth silicate<br>
fibres could tolerate higher levels of alkali metal oxide than others. However, levels of 0.3%<br>
and 0.4% by weight NaaO were suspected of causing increased shrinkage in materials for use<br>
as insulation at 1260°C. The importance of keeping the level of alumina low was stressed is<br>
stressed in this document.<br>
W097/16386 disclosed fibres usable as refractory insulation at temperatures of up to 1260°C<br>
or more. These fibres comprised MgO, SiO?, and optionally ZrCh as principal constituents.<br>
These fibres are stated to require substantially no alkali metal oxides other than as trace<br>
impurites (present at levels of hundredths of a percent at most calculated as alkali metal<br>
oxide). The fibres have a general composition<br>
Si02 65-86%<br>
MgO 14-35%<br>
with the components MgO and SiOa comprising at least 82.5% by weight of the fibre, the<br>
balance being named constituents and viscosity modifiers. Such magnesium silicate fibres<br>
may comprise low quantities of other alkaline earths. The importance of keeping the level of<br>
alumina low was stressed is stressed in this document.<br>
WO2003/059835 discloses certain calcium silicate fibres certain calcium silicate<br>
compositions for which fibres show a low reactivity with aluminosilicate bricks, namely: <br>
65%<sio2></sio2>
MgO 
14%<cao></cao>
A1203 
ZrO2<br>
B2O3<br>
P2O5<br>
72% <sio2></sio2>
95% 
This patent also discloses the use of La2O3 or other lanthanide additives to improve the<br>
strength of the fibres and blanket made from the fibres. This patent application does not<br>
mention alkali metal oxide levels, but amounts in the region of ~0.5wt% were disclosed in<br>
fibres intended for use as insulation at up to 1260°C or more.<br>
WO2003/060016 claims a low shrinkage, high temperature resistant inorganic fiber having a<br>
use temperature up to at least 1330 C, which maintains mechanical integrity after exposure to<br>
the use temperature and which is non-durable in physiological fluids, comprising the<br>
fiberization product of greater than 71.25 to about 85 weight percent silica, 0 to about 20<br>
weight percent magnesia, about 5 to about 28.75 weight percent calcia, and 0 to about 5<br>
weight percent zirconia, and optionally a viscosity modifier in an amount effective to render<br>
the product fiberizable.<br>
EP 1323687 claims a biosoluble ceramic fiber composition for a high temperature insulation<br>
material comprising 75-80 wt% of SiO2, 13-25 wt% of CaO, 1-8 wt% of MgO, 0.5-3 wt% of<br>
ZrO2 and 0-0.5 wt% of A12O3, wherein (Zr02 + A1203) is contained 0.5-3 wt% and (CaO <br>
MgO) is contained 15-26 wt%.<br>
Alkaline earth silicate fibres have received a definition in the Chemical Abstract Service<br>
Registry [Registry Number: 436083-99-7] of:-<br>
"Chemical substances manufactured in the form of fibers. This category encompasses<br>
substances produced by blowing or spinning a molten mixture ofalfcaline earth<br>
oxides, silica and other minor/trace oxides. It melts around 1500°C (2732°F). It<br>
consists predominantly of silica (50-82 wt%). calcia and magnesia (18-43 wt%),<br>
alumina, titania and zirconia (
This definition reflects European Health and Safety regulations which impose special<br>
labelling requirements on silicate fibres containing less than 18% alkaline earth oxides.<br>
However as is clearly indicated in relation to W02003/059835, WO2003/060016 and EP<br>
1323687, the silica content of alkaline earth silicate fibres is increasing with the demand for<br>
higher use temperatures and this is leading to lower alkaline earth contents.<br>
The present invention is applicable not only to alkaline earth silicate fibres in this narrow<br>
definition reflected in the Chemical Abstracts definition, but also to alkaline earth silicate<br>
fibres having lower levels of alkaline earth oxides.<br>
Accordingly, in the present specification alkaline earth silicate fibres should be considered to<br>
be materials comprising predominantly of silica and alkaline earth oxides and comprising less<br>
than 10wt% alumina [as indicated in W087/05007 - which first introduced such fibres],<br>
preferably in which alumina, zirconia and titania amount to less that 6wt% [as indicated in<br>
the Chemical Abstracts definition]. For regulatory reasons, preferred materials contain more<br>
than 18% alkaline earth metal oxides.<br>
The prior art shows that for refractory alkaline earth silicate fibres, alkali metals have been<br>
considered as impurities that can be tolerated at low levels but which have detrimental affects<br>
on refractoriness at higher levels.<br>
The applicant has found that, contrary to received wisdom in the field of refractory alkaline<br>
earth silicate fibres, the addition of minor quantities of alkali metals within a certain narrow<br>
range improves the mechanical quality of fibres produced (in particular fibre strength)<br>
without appreciably damaging the refractoriness of the fibres.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of making refractory alkaline earth<br>
silicate fibres from a melt, comprising the inclusion as an intended melt component of alkali<br>
metal to improve the mechanical and/or thermal properties of the fibre in comparison with a<br>
fibre free of alkali metal.<br>
Preferably, the amount of alkali metal (M) expressed as the oxide IV^O is greater than 0.2<br>
mol% and preferably in the range 0.2 mol% to 2.5 mol%, more preferably 0.25 mol% to 2<br>
mol%.<br>
By "a fibre free of alkali metal" is meant a fibre in which all other components are present in<br>
the same proportions but which lacks alkali metal.<br>
The alkali metal is preferably present in an amount sufficient to increase the tensile strength<br>
of a blanket made using the fibre by &gt;50% over the tensile strength of a blanket free of alkali<br>
metal, and less than an amount that will result in a shrinkage as measured by the method<br>
described below of greater than 3.5% in a vacuum cast preform of the fibre when exposed to<br>
1250°C for 24 hours.<br>
It will be apparent that the alkali metal may be provided either as an additive to the melt<br>
(preferably in the form of an oxide), or by using as ingredients of the melt appropriate<br>
amounts of materials containing alkali metal as a component or impurity, or both as an<br>
additive and as a component or impurity. The invention lies in ensuring that the melt has the<br>
desired quantity of alkali metal to achieve the beneficial effects of the invention.<br>
The invention may be applied to all of the prior art alkaline earth silicate compositions<br>
mentioned above.<br>
The scope and further features of the invention will become apparent from the claims in the<br>
light of the following illustrative description and with reference to the drawings in which:-<br>

The inventors produced fibre blanket using a production trial line at their factory in<br>
Bromborough, England. Fibre was produced by forming a melt and allowing the melt to fall<br>
onto a pair of spinners (as is conventionally known).<br>
The base melt had a nominal composition in weight percent:-<br>
SiO2 73.5<br>
CaO 25<br>
La?03 1.5<br>
with other components forming minor impurities and sodium oxide being added in specified<br>
amounts.<br>
The melt stream temperature was monitored using a two colour pyrometer.<br>
Fibres produced from the spinners were passed onto a conveyer and then needled to form<br>
blanket in a conventional manner.<br>
The blanket thickness, density, and tensile strength were measured for fibres produced using<br>
a range of conditions.<br>
The blanket was produced with a view to determining the effect on fibre quality of melt<br>
stream temperature, since it was believed that this had an effect on fibre quality.<br>
The inventors also decided to add alkali metal oxides with the view of flattening the<br>
viscosity-temperature curve of the melt as this was thought a relevant factor in fibre<br>
production as explained further below.<br>
The results of these tests are set out in Table 1 and illustrated graphically in Figs. 1 and 2. In<br>
Table 1, the melt stream temperature, blanket thickness, blanket density, tensile strength and<br>
tensile strength divided by density is shown for all compositions. [The tensile strength<br>
divided by density is calculated to counteract the variation attributable to different amounts of<br>
material being in the blanket]. Also for selected compositions the shrinkage of a preform at<br>
1150°C and 1250°C was measured in the same manner as in WO2003/059S35.<br>
The first thing that is noteworthy is that the blanket strengths show a high variability. This is<br>
because the manufacture ofa blanket involves many variables, including:-<br>
• Composition of the melt<br>
• Temperature of the melt<br>
• Melt stream temperature<br>
• Shot content (melt that has solidified in the form of droplets rather than fibres)<br>
• Fibre diameter<br>
• Fibre length<br>
• Needling conditions<br>
• Post-solidification thermal history<br>
By producing a range of fibres on a single line and significantly varying only melt stream<br>
temperature and composition (each of which will have an affect on shot content, fibre<br>
diameter and fibre length) it was hoped to reduce such variability. However because a blanket<br>
is an aggregated body of individual fibres, there is inevitably a statistical variation in such<br>
aggregate properties as tensile strength.<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 1 there appears to be relatively little variation hi strength with melt<br>
stream temperature, but since the range of melt stream temperatures chosen was selected to<br>
encompass ranges previously found to be effective, this is not surprising.<br>
However, it can be seen that with progressive increases in NaiO content, the strength tends to<br>
increase. Fig. 2 shows the maximum, minimum, and average strengths found for a range of<br>
compositions and it can be seen that blanket strength shows a strong positive correlation with<br>
content. In contrast, the shrinkage of the fibres seemed barely affected.<br>
The fibres with nominal zero Na2O content of course had minor trace amounts (average<br>
measured content 0.038% - maximum 0.1 1%). Extrapolating back to zero NaiO gives an<br>
average tensile strength/density of 0.0675 kPa/[kg/m ]. The average tensile strength/density<br>
for the addition of 0.3% Na2O is 0.1426. The increase in blanket strength is over 100% and<br>
smaller additions (e.g. 0.25 mol%) would be expected to exceed a 50% improvement.<br>
(Table Rempved)<br>
Encouraged by this, and with a view to determining the upper limit of alkali metal oxide that<br>
was appropriate, the inventors produced a range of further alkaline earth silicate fibres using<br>
an experimental rig in which a melt was formed of appropriate composition, tapped through a<br>
8-16 mm orifice, and blown to produce fibre in a known manner. (The size of the tap hole<br>
was varied to cater for the viscosity of the melt - this is an adjustment that must be<br>
determined experimentally according to the apparatus and composition used). Shrinkage of<br>
preforms of the fibre at 1150°C and 1250°C were measured in the same manner as in<br>
W02003/059835. Total solubility in ppm of the major glass components after a 24 hour static<br>
test in a physiological saline solution were also measured for some of the examples.<br>
The results of these studies are shown in Table 2. The fibres in the left of the table were<br>
aimed at assessing the effect of adding approximately equimolar amounts of alkali metal<br>
addition to calcium silicate fibre containing L^Oa (as in W02003/059S35), whereas those to<br>
the right were aimed at assessing the effect of varying the quantity of NaaO in such a fibre.<br>
While not conclusive, the results indicate that for these fibres Na20 and K^O show shrinkages<br>
no worse or even better than fibre free of Na2O, whereas LiaO appears detrimental to<br>
shrinkage.<br>
However, this latter conclusion is thought unsafe since it was determined that the lithium had<br>
been added in the form of lithium tetraborate, and the boron addition may have had a<br>
significant effect. Until proven otherwise, the applicants are assuming that all alkali metals<br>
can be used in the invention, but that the absolute amount of alkali metal may vary from<br>
metal to metal and fibre to fibre. The solubility figures show that total solubility is slightly<br>
increased by the addition of alkali metal oxide.<br>
(Table Rempved)<br>
The right side of Table 2 shows firstly that only a ~1% higher silica content has a big effect<br>
on shrinkage, giving a much lower shrinkage. For these fibres, linear shrinkage at<br>
850°C/24hrs seemed unaffected by all soda additions tested, however the same is not true for<br>
thickness shrinkage, although it is still low. At 1150°C/24hrs there is a slight increase in both<br>
linear and through thickness shrinkage, but at 1250°C/24hrs through thickness whilst still<br>
acceptable grows more significantly for the highest soda addition. All of these figures are<br>
acceptable for some applications whereas other applications could not tolerate the highest<br>
NajO level tested.<br>
The improvement in shrinkage with higher silica levels led the inventors to look to materials<br>
containing still higher silica levels and the results are set out in Table 3 below.<br>
(Table Rempved)<br>
These results show low shrinkage and a reasonably high solubility across the range. It<br>
appears that addition of alkali metal oxide may increase the amount of silica that can be<br>
added to produce a workable alkaline earth silicate fibre, and perhaps with an acceptable<br>
solubility. This is of great significance since, in general, increasing silica content permits<br>
higher use temperatures for alkaline earth silicate fibres.<br>
Fig. 6 shows the shrinkage at various temperatures of preforms of a range of alkaline earth<br>
silicate fibres. The reference SW613 refers to lanthanum containing materials of composition<br>
similar to those set out in Table 3 with varying silica contents as indicated but absent any<br>
alkali metal additioa. [Silica and calcia comprising most of the material with lanthanum oxide<br>
being present in about 1.3%]. One of these fibres also has an addition of 2wt% MgO. Also<br>
shown are shrinkages for a conventional aluminosilicate fibre (RCF) and a magnesium<br>
silicate fibre (MgO Silicate).<br>
It can be seen that all of the SW613 fibres have a shrinkage lower than that of RCF and the<br>
MgO silicate fibres up to 1350°C but rise thereafter. However, there is a progressive increase<br>
in refractoriness with increasing silica content. For the SW613 fibre containing 77 and 79%<br>
Si02, the shrinkage remains below that of RCF and the MgO silicate fibres up to 1400°C and<br>
better could be expected for higher silica contents. In contrast, it can be seen also that<br>
addition of 2% MgO to the SW613 compositions is detrimental to shrinkage. High silica<br>
alkaline earth silicate fibres are difficult to make and addition of alkali metals to such<br>
compositions should improve the quality of such fibres and ease manufacture.<br>
Having shown such effects the applicants conducted a trial to make blanket on a production<br>
line, to see whether the initial results on shrinkage were confirmed. A base composition<br>
comprising: -<br>
SiO2 72.5 - 74wt%<br>
CaO 24 - 26.5wt%<br>
MgO 0.4-0.8wt%<br>
A1202 
La2O3 1.2-1.5wt%<br>
was used and varying amounts of Na2O were added. Blanket having a density 128kg/m3 was<br>
produced having a thickness of ~25mrn. The results, summarised in Fig. 7, show a dramatic<br>
increase in blanket strength with Na20 addition.<br>
These findings relate to compositions containing LaaO} as a component, but similar effects of<br>
alkali rnetal additions are found with alkaline earth silicate fibres not containing La2O3 as a<br>
component.<br>
The inventors also tested other alkaline earth silicate fibres comprising predominantly<br>
magnesium as the alkaline earth component (magnesium silicate fibres) and the results are set<br>
out in Table 4.<br>
This table shows that whereas Na20 and KiO have a small or large respectively detrimental<br>
effect on shrinkage, Li2O has hardly any effect on shrinkage. This does not imply no effect at<br>
all, the inventors observed that whereas the fibres with Na^O and KiO were similar to fibres<br>
without such additives (coarse) the fibre with Li2O addition was significantly finer and of<br>
better quality. At lower quantities, NaaO and KiO may still give shrinkages that are tolerable<br>
in most applications.<br>
(Table Rempved)<br>
The purpose of adding alkali metal is to try to alter the viscosity temperature curve for<br>
alkaline earth silicates so as to provide a more useful working range for the silicates. Fig. 3<br>
shows a graph experimental viscosity/temperature curves for:-<br>
• a high soda glass having the approximate composition in wt%:-<br>
(Table Rempved)<br>
• an alkaline earth silicate melt comprising the approximate composition:-<br>
Ca029<br>
MgO 6%<br>
SiO2 64.5<br>
+ others to 100%<br>
• and the same alkaline earth silicate melt comprising respectively 1 wt% Na20 and 2 wt%<br>
Na2O as an additive.<br>
The viscosity/temperature graph of the high soda glass is a smooth line rising as temperature<br>
falls.<br>
For the known alkaline earth silicate melt (SW) the viscosity is lower and then rises steeply at<br>
a critical temperature value (this is shown as a slope in the graph but that is an artefact of the<br>
graphing process - it actually represents a much steeper change).<br>
Addition of Na'2O to the melt moves this rise in viscosity to lower temperatures.<br>
This extends the working range of the melt so that it becomes less dependent upon<br>
temperature so increasing the tolerance of the melt to fibre forming conditions. Although the<br>
melt stream temperature is important, the melt cools rapidly during the fibre forming process<br>
and so a longer range of workability for the composition improves fibre formation. The<br>
addition of the alkali metal oxides may also serve to stabilise the melt stream so that for a<br>
given set of conditions there is an amount that reduces shot.<br>
Additionally, it is surmised that in small quantities the alkali metal oxides serve to suppress<br>
phase separation in alkaline earth silicate fibres.<br>
Since the alkaline earth silicate systems have a two liquid region in their phase diagrams, the<br>
applicants suspect that addition of alkali metal oxides may move the melts out of a two-liquid<br>
region into a single phase region.<br>
The addition also has the effect of lowering melt stream temperature which may assist in<br>
stability.<br>
The effectiveness of these measures is also shown by the amount of shot present in the<br>
finished material, hi the fibre forming process, droplets of melt are rapidly accelerated (by<br>
being flung off a spinning wheel or being blasted by a jet of gas) and form long tails which<br>
become the fibres.<br>
However that part of the droplets that does not form fibre remains in the finished material in<br>
the form of particles known in the industry as "shot". Shot is generally detrimental to the<br>
thermal properties of insulation formed from the fibres, and so it is a general aim in the<br>
industry to reduce the quantity of shot.<br>
The applicants have found that addition of minor amounts of alkali metal to the melt has the<br>
effect of reducing the amount of shot, and this is shown in Fig. 4 for the lanthanum<br>
containing materials of Table 1, where it can be seen that the shot content was reduced from<br>
-51% to-48%.<br>
Similar effects apply to lanthanum free materials. Table 5 shows the analysed compositions<br>
of a range of alkaline earth silicate fibres (having a lower maximum use temperature) made in<br>
accordance with the compositions of W093/1502S , which were made by spinning using a<br>
melt stream temperature of 1380-142G°C, and with a pair of rotating spinners.<br>
Fig. 5 shows experimentally determined shot contents with error bars indicating one standard<br>
deviation about mean. It can be seen that in the range 0.35 to 1.5 wt% NaaO, there is a<br>
statistical improvement in the shot content as a result of the addition. In particular, a 3 %<br>
reduction in shot for a 0.35wt% soda content is significant.<br>
Since there seems no detrimental effect on shrinkage at such levels (and indeed a slight<br>
improvement) it can be seen that addition of alkali metal oxides is beneficial for the<br>
production of such materials.<br>
(Table Rempved)<br>
Addition of the alkali metal should be at levels that do not excessively detrimentally affect<br>
other properties of the fibre (e.g. shrinkage), but for different applications what is "excessive"<br>
will vary.<br>
The fibres can be used in thermal insulation and may form either a constituent of the<br>
insulation (e.g. with other fibres and/or fillers and/or binders) or may form the whole of the<br>
insulation. The fibres may be formed into blanket form insulation.<br>
Although initial work was primarily related to the addition of NaaO to alkaline earth silicate<br>
fibres, the applicants discovered that when Na2O was used as the additive to high calcium -<br>
low magnesium fibres it had a tendency to promote crystallisation (and hence powderiness of<br>
the fibres) after exposure to temperatures of ~1000°C. This can be seen in Fig. 8 in which<br>
fibre a) -e) had base compositions falling in the region:-<br>
(Table Rempved)<br>
Fibres a), b) and c) show the effect on surface appearance of fibres after exposure to 1050°C<br>
for 24 hours on fibres containing increasing amounts of Na20 (from ~0 through 0.5wr% to<br>
1.06wt% respectively). As can be seen, the fibre absent Na2O has a smooth appearance<br>
indicating little crystallisation, whereas increasing Na2O leads to an increase in surface<br>
roughness indicative of crystallisation.<br>
In contrast, fibres d) and e) show that at 1100°C a fibre containing ~0.5wt% K20 is little<br>
different from a fibre free of KjO, and only starts to show slight surface roughness at 1150°C.<br>
Table 6 shows relative thermal conductivities of blankets having approximate density of<br>
96kg.m"3 formed from fibres having the principal ingredients shown. It also shows thermal<br>
conductivities of these blankets and these figures are shown in Fig. 9. It can be seen that<br>
addition of Na20 and K2O seems to result in lower thermal conductivity from the blankets so<br>
showing improved insulating ability.<br>
(Table Rempved)<br>
The applicants have therefore identified further advantages of the use of alkali metal oxides<br>
as additives to alkaline earth silicate blanket materials, and particular advantage to the use of<br>
potassium. In particular, to avoid promotion of crystallisation by sodium, preferably at least<br>
75mol% of the alkali metal is potassium. More preferably at least 90%, still more preferably<br>
at least 95% and yet still more preferably at least 99% of the alkali metal is potassium.<br>
To test the mutual interaction of LaaOa and KjO on the fibre properties a range of fibres were<br>
made into blankets and tested for shrinkage at various temperatures [24 hours at temperature].<br>
It was found that La^Ch could be reduced and replaced by KjO without significant harm to<br>
the shrinkage properties of the materials, but this led to onset of crystallisation at lower<br>
temperatures than for the La2O3 containing materials. However, replacement of La2O3 in part<br>
by alumina cured this problem. Table 7 indicates a range of materials tested, the temperature<br>
at which crystallisation commenced, and temperature at which the crystals reached ~1 um in<br>
size. The materials all had a base composition of approximately 73.1-74.4wt% SiC&gt;2 and 24.6-<br>
25.3 wt% CaO with all other ingredients amounting to less than 3% in total.<br>
