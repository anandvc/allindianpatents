				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>- 1A -<br>
The invention relates to an electrically conducting lead which for example can be used for transmitting electrical energy in buildings for more efficient transmission of electrical power<br>
Known leads are known to be used in overland leads, cables, wirings, motor windings and connections, and consist of simple straight wires Where such simple wires are visibly laid, the mere sight of these does not correspond to the aesthetic feeling of a human observer. This applies above all in cultural circles in which aesthetic aspects and the harmony of the human being with his surroundings plays an important role in everyday life<br>
It is therefore the object of the invention to improve known electrically conducting leads and lead system with consequent improved aesthetic effect<br>
According to the invention this object is achieved in that the electrical lead is formed of aesthetically pleasing electrically conducting sections which are connected to one another These sections fulfil a double function On the one hand they conduct the electrical current more efficiently, and on the other hand they are more pleasant to look at<br>
Whilst known attempts seek to achieve an aesthetic improvement of electrical leads by way of coverings, the invention proceeds in the reverse way in that they-<br><br>
-1B-<br>
actually direct the attention and surprisingly with this achieve the desired aesthetic effect<br>
The present invention provides an electrically conducting lead consisting of a plurality of electrically conducting sections connected with each other in a chain, wherein said electrically conducting sections are electrically connected with each other one after the other at respective connection points in said chain, each of said electrically conducting sections is in the form of a two-dimensional figure or a three dimensional figure and neighboring pairs of said electrically conducting sections are electrically connected with each other at said respective connection points by soldering or twisting together<br>
With regard to an economic application of material it is suggested that the sections are lined up in a chain Thus with relatively little material large distances can be spanned The invention however also encompasses arrangements which deviate from the form of a chain, for example when a particular aesthetic effect is to be achieved<br><br>
2<br>
In one formation of the invention the sections and/or chains consist of an electrically well conducting material, preferably copper, or of a material provided with an electrically conducting coating. For example a whole chain may be formed as one piece from plastic and subsequently be coated or galvanised with a conducting paste.<br>
A preferred embodiment form envisages the sections to consist of wire Which is bent in the shape of the outlines o'f one or more two-dimensional geometric figure such as squares, rectangles, triangles, circles, polygons, ellipses, arcs, spirals or stars. Such wire figures may be manufactured by machine in a simple manner and connected to one another, wherein a relatively large lead cross section for conducting higher currents with a relatively low ohmic resistance is available. With a suitably skilled selection and arrangement of the geometric figures these may continuously be bent from one or more endless wires so that neither the wires need to be cut nor do the sections need to be connected to one another.<br>
In another embodiment form of the invention it is provided for the sections to be formed as one or more two-dimensional geometric figures such as squares, rectangles, triangles, circles, polygons, ellipses, arcs, spirals or stars of sheet metal or electrically conducting foil. Such figures can be manufactured in a simple manner by cutting out and punching by machine, wherein preferably at the same time a continuous chain is formed. On punching on the visible surfaces of the figures at the same time even further ornaments may be impressed.<br>
For a very special application purpose a further embodiment form is recommended in which the sections are formed as outlines of one or several three-dimensional geometric figures such as cubes, parallelepipedons, tetrahedrons, pyramids, spirals or stars of wire. This embodiment form is suitable particularly for leads hanging freely in space, for example for a hanging lamp if the aesthetic effect is to be brought to the centre attention.<br><br>
3<br>
For increasing the aesthetic effect the geometric figures may be arranged interlaced in one another As such further more the electrical conductability and the mechanical rigidness of the lead can be improved<br>
By lining up various geometric figures in a chain one obtains a larger number of possible combinations for a lead, so that a practically unlimited number of various ornaments is possible This variety may be even further increased by the measure of lining up the same or various geometric figures of varying sizes in a chain<br>
Further advantages and details of the invention result from the subsequent description of embodiment examples with reference to the accompanying drawings,<br>
In the accompanying drawings -<br>
Figure 1 shows three examples for electrically conducting sections according to the invention,<br>
Figure 2 show a first embodiment example of an electrical lead according to the invention which consists of a chain of the said sections,<br>
Figure 3 show a second embodiment example of an electrical lead according to the invention, which consists of a chain of various sections of different sizes<br>
The electrically conducting sections 1, 2, 3 according to the invention shown in the drawings consist of copper wire which is bent into geometric figures With this the wire is in each case formed as a contour of two-dimensional geometric figures such as circles, arcs and squares The invention can be just as simply carried out with other, and in particular three-dimensional geometric figures which are formed by<br><br>
4<br>
correspondingly formed wires or sheets. The figures may however also consist of other materials, in particular plastic which is provided with an electrically conducting coating. An embodiment form in which electrically conducting three-dimensional elements are lined up as a chain is also possible, such as for example balls in the form of a pearl necklace.<br>
At the connection points 4 the sections 1, 2, 3 are connected to one another which for example may be effected by soldering or twisting so that they form a chain 5, 6 which can be indefinately lengthened by joining further sections. In order however to completely or largely avoid a complicated connecting of the sections during the manufacture of the chain lead 5, 6, the wires are continuously formed at the connection points 4, i.e. at the transition from the one to the neighbouring section. The manufacture is simplest when the arrangement of the sections is selected such that the chain lead 5, 6 is knotted from one or more wires, without a particular operating procedure being required for the connection of the sections 1, 2, 3.<br>
A section 1, 2, 3 may consist of several geometric figures interlaced into one another. For example the section 1 consists of a square in which a circle is incorporated, section 2 consists of four small squares which together form a large square, and section 3 of a square in which two complementary arc sections are incorporated.<br>
The chain lead may consist of many equal sections, as the chain lead 5 shown in Figure 2 consisting of only sections 1 joined together, or it may consist of various sections, as the chain lead 6 shown in Figure 3 of the joined sections 1, 2 and 3. Also sections of the same shape and differing sizes may be combined as can be likewise recognized in Figure 3 where the section 2 appears in two different sizes.<br>
Such chain leads 5, 6 according to the invention may advantageously be applied for the electrical supply of<br><br>
5<br>
electrical apparatus at locations which are often sought after by people and where usual electrical leads do not have a particularly aesthetic effect, for example in living and working rooms, but also in the open air. Due to their decorative effect the leads 5, 6 according to the invention are particulary useful for hanging lamps. With this it is not necessarily required that the complete electrical current circuit is equipped with the leads according to the invention. Rather for reasons of cost they are applied above all where they under usual circumstances come into view and are perceived. Apart from the energy supply the leads according to the invention may of course also be used for information transmission. Such electrical leads may be called as Maya Electrical Transmission System.<br><br>
