POSITION INDICATING SYSTEM FOR ELECTRICAL SWITCHING DEVICE<br>
A)	TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention generally relates to a switching device and more particularly to a position indicating device for displaying the operational status of the device.<br>
B)	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The electrical switching devices are used to protect the electrical circuitry and equipment from the damage due to an abnormal condition, such as an overload condition, a relatively high level short circuit or a fault condition. The electrical switching devices include, for example, circuit switching devices and circuit interrupters such as circuit breakers, contactors, motor starters, motor controllers and other load controllers<br>
[0003] These electrical switching devices typically have two operating handle positions corresponding to the status of the separable contacts. For example, these positions include an ON position, in which the separable contacts are closed and an OFF position in which the contacts are open. Some switching devices have a third position which corresponds to a tripped condition in which the contacts are tripped open.<br><br><br>
[0004] Switching devices are usually installed in an enclosure so that the entire control and distribution network arranged in the form of metallic sheets and/or cable wires are housed inside the enclosure. All the operating means are arranged outside the enclosure to prevent an access to the high voltage sections to eliminate the generation of a potential hazard. It is often desirable or essential that the settings of the switching devices remain undisturbed during a maintenance operation. Unauthorized or inadvertent changing of the position of these breakers could result in unwanted interruptions to service or operations and serious damage to an electrical apparatus, or even serious harm to a person. For example, accidental actuation of a circuit breaker might result in electrocution or shock to a workman performing electrical work or repair on equipment downstream from the circuit breaker.<br>
[0005] Therefore enough safety measures must be taken to prevent another person from inadvertently returning the circuit breaker handle to the ON position, when a worker is doing electrical work in an area other than the immediate vicinity of the circuit breaker box or electrical panel. Hence it is necessary for an operator to understand the operational status of the device before carrying out any job on the switching device.<br>
[0006] In an enclosed device, 'ON' and 'OFF' position indicator is a desirable feature. This enables the operator to determine the state of the switching device without opening the cover of the enclosure or without any input or output measurement. Normally the position indicators are LED lamps or any other visual indicators. These indicators are supplied with electrical power to exhibit the current operating condition of a functional device through a visual indication such as a flashing light or by<br><br><br>
lighting a neon sign or bulbs. But the indicators or signals have to be supplied with a back up power during the power supply failure condition to indicate the operating status.<br>
[0007] In all existing motor starter, indication is provided through an electric means like neon bulb or LED. When the starter is switched ON, supply to the LED/Neon bulb is established and it glows. This provides indication for ON state to the user.<br>
[0008] Hence there is need to develop a simple, effective and easily operable position indicating system to exhibit the operating condition of a functional device to an operator to ensure safety to the operating personnel.<br>
C) OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009] The primary object of the present invention is to develop a position indicating system and method for an electrical switching device to exhibit the operational status of the switching device easily without opening the cover of the enclosure encasing the functional device.<br>
[0010] Another object of the present invention is to develop a position indicating system for an electrical switching device to exhibit the operational status of the switching device easily without receiving or providing an input-output measurement.<br><br><br>
[0011] Yet another object of the present invention is to develop a position indicating system for an electrical switching device to exhibit the operational status of the switching device easily through a mechanical means.<br>
[0012] Yet another object of the present invention is to develop a rugged and reliable position indicating system for an electrical switching device to exhibit the operational status of the switching device easily and effectively.<br>
[0013] Yet another object of the present invention is to develop a positional indicating system for an electrical switching device to exhibit the operational status of the switching device easily without requiring an external power source thereby improving the reliability of the indicator device and reducing the power consumption.<br>
[0014] Yet another object of the present invention is to develop a position indicating system for an electrical switching device to exhibit the operational status of the switching device in an exclusively separate module so that the indicator device may be added to any existing device easily without requiring any further or additional modification to the device.<br>
[0015] Yet another object of the present invention is to develop a position indicating system for an electrical switching device to exhibit the operational status of the switching device in an exclusively separate module so that the indicator device may be replaced easily with a standard add-on contact block.<br><br><br>
[0016] These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become readily apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
D) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0017] The abovementioned shortcomings, disadvantages and problems are addressed herein and which will be understood by reading and studying the following specification.<br>
[0018] The various embodiments of the present invention provide a system and method for indicating the operational status of the switching device without opening the cover of the enclosure and without requiring electrical power for indication.<br>
[0019] According to one embodiment of the invention, a single integral bridge is provided in an add-on contact block to provide an indication exhibiting the ON/OFF condition or the operational status of the enclosed operating device using a mechanical means easily without requiring any external power source for indication purposes so that the operational status of the device is indicated without opening the cover of the enclosure housing the operating device.<br>
[0020] The bridge of a two pole add-on is divided into two sections. One section is used for housing the moving contact of a switching device and a spring, while the other section is used for housing the ON/OFF indicator. The indicator consists of a pivot point, actuating point and a flat portion." Two stickers of different colours are<br><br><br>
affixed on the flat portion to indicate the operational status of the enclosed operating device. A green colour sticker label is fixed on the flat portion to indicate the switch "ON" status of an operating device. A red colour sticker label is fixed on the fiat portion to indicate the switch "OFF" status of an operating device. The pivot point is hinged with the housing of the add-on block. The rear actuating portion of the indicator is click fitted to the second half of the bridge. As the bridge moves between two rest positions, the indicator is displaced angularly to project either of the two colour label stickers of rest, the angular displacement of indicator takes place. Due to the angular movement of the indicator, the colour of the indicator is changed from RED to GREEN and vice versa.<br>
[0021] According to another embodiment of the present invention, a method is provided for indicating the operational status of the enclosed operating device. According to the method, an ON/OFF indicator is provided on one of the two sections of an integral bridge. Two colour stickers for example green colour sticker label and blue colour sticker labels are affixed on the flat portion of one section in the bridge. Then the flat portion is moved angularly between two rest positions to project the red sticker label or green sticker label to indicate the OFF and the ON positions of the enclosed operating device. The flat portion is moved angularly to change the colours from green to red and vice versa.<br>
[0022] According to another embodiment of the present invention, an integral bridge is provided in a motor starter to provide an auxiliary "NO" hold on contact for a three pole contactor.<br><br><br>
[0023] Thus the integral bridge of the invention exhibits two different functions. The bridge is not only used for indicating the operational status of the enclosed operating device but also used for providing an auxiliary "NO" hold on contact for a three pole contactor during the usage in a motor starter thereby providing two features with a single module. The reliability of the system is improved due to the usage of mechanical indicators. Since no electrical power is required to operate the indicator, the operating cost is reduced greatly. The device may be fitted as an add-on device to the existing facility easily. The device may be fixed to the switch gears in a user friendly manner.<br>
[0024] These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become readily apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

The indicator consists of a pivot point, actuating point and a flat portion." Two stickers are of different colours are affixed on the flat portion to indicate the operational status of the enclosed operating device. A green colour sticker label is fixed on the flat portion to indicate the switch "ON" status of an operating device. A red colour sticker label is fixed on the flat portion to indicate the switch "OFF" status of an operating device. The pivot point is hinged with the housing of the add-on block. The rear actuating portion of the indicator is click fitted to the second half of the bridge. As the bridge moves between two rest positions, the indicator is displaced angularly to project either of the two colour label stickers of rest, the angular displacement of indicator takes place. Due to the angular movement of the indicator, the colour of the indicator is changed from RED to GREEN and vice versa.<br>
[0028] According to another embodiment of the present invention, a method is provided for indicating the operational status of the enclosed operating device. According to the method, an ON/OFF indicator is provided on one of the two sections of an integral bridge. Two colour stickers for example green colour sticker label and blue colour sticker labels are affixed on the flat portion of one section in the bridge. Then the flat portion is moved angularly between two rest positions to project the red<br><br><br>
sticker label or green sticker label to indicate the OFF and the ON positions of the enclosed operating device. The flat portion is moved angularly to change the colours from green to red and vice versa.<br>
[0029] According to another embodiment of the present invention, an integral bridge is provided in a motor starter to provide an auxiliary "NO" hold on contact for a three pole contactor.<br>

The bridge is not only used for indicating the operational status of the enclosed operating device but also used for providing an auxiliary "NO" hold on contact for a three pole contactor during the usage in a motor starter thereby providing two features with a single module. The reliability of the system is improved due to the usage of mechanical indicators. Since no electrical power is required to operate the indicator, the operating cost is reduced greatly. The device may be fitted as an add-on device to the existing facility easily. The device may be fixed to the switch gears in a user friendly manner.<br>
