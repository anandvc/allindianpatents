transmission scheme that results in additional frequency diversity gain being obtained<br>
while requiring low complexity. Such repetitive transmission scheme is applicable re-<br>
gardless of the number of antennas, and provides improved performance in a channel<br>
environment having low frequency selection.<br>

[23] Figure 19 shows the changes in signal components when cyclic delay is performed.<br>
[24] Figure 20 shows the changes in signal components when 3 respectively different<br>
phase sequences are multiplied to a particular signal.<br>
[25] Repetitive transmission schemes are essential for increasing the quality of commu-<br>
nication systems. Many schemes employ methods for respectively increasing spatial<br>
diversity, time diversity, and frequency diversity. Among these, one of the most<br>
important methods for increasing system quality is the HARQ scheme<br>
[26] The basic concept of the HARQ scheme is to re-transmit the same information<br>
during re-transmission if re-transmission is required due to an error occurrence in a<br>
first transmitted packet, such mat time diversity gain is obtained while signal power is<br>
increased for correcting errors or such that coding gain is increased by transmitting the<br>
new parts of the parity portion for correcting packet errors.<br>
[27] However, despite the use of such HARQ scheme, in certain OFDM systems<br>
employing a single transceiving antenna, because there is no spatial diversity gain,<br>
even if re-transmission is performed during a low moving speed environment in which<br>
the channel changes slowly, the re-transmitted signal passing through a similar channel<br>
again, which results in a high probability that packet errors are not corrected if the<br>
channel is not good. This same drawback is suffered in a multiple transceiving antenna<br>
system without any multiple antenna schemes being applied thereto.<br>
[28]	Additionally, when using the space-time coding based HARQ scheme, spatial<br><br>
diversity gain is obtained, but because the related art scheme had been designed with<br>
the assumption that the channel does not change during re-transmission, if the moving<br>
speed is high, inter-symbol interference occurs due to changes in the channel and the<br>
first transmission should be sent at a spatial multiplexing rate of 1 or above, which<br>
results in the problem of not being useful for a mobile communication system<br>
supporting various types of antenna structures.<br>
[29] Figure 1 is a block diagram showing a structure of art Orthogonal Frequency<br>
Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system having a single transceiving antenna. Figure 2<br>
is a block diagram showing a structure of an Orthogonal Frequency Division Mul-<br>
tiplexing (OFDM) system having multiple transceiving antennas.<br>
[30] User data to be transmitted to a receiving side or data bits corresponding to control<br>
data are inputted into a channel encoder 101. This channel encoder 101 attaches<br>
redundant bits to the data bits in order to reduce the effects with respect to effects or<br>
noise coming from the channel. The outputs of the channel encoder 101 are inputted<br>
into a mapper ICE and are converted into symbols. These symbols are then inputted<br>
into a serial/parallel converter 103. The serial/parallel converter 103 changes serial<br>
data into parallel data. The serial/parallel converter 103 can transmit data to a receiving<br>
side by using a plurality of orthogonal sub-carriers. If transmitting via a plurality of<br>
antennas as shown in Figure 2, the output of the serial/parallel converter 103 is input<br>
into a multi-antenna encoder 104. The multiplex antenna encoder 104 performs space-<br>
time signal processing for converting data symbols into space-time signals. For the<br>
multi-antenna scheme, the transmitting antenna is used to transmit such space-time<br>
signal via channels, and the receiving antenna is used to receive such space-time signal<br>
from the channels. The multi-antenna decoder 105 performs re-conversion of the<br>
received space-time signals into respective data symbols.<br>
[31]	A system, which employs one or more antennas, inputs the signal received via<br>
multiple sub-carriers into a parallel/serial converter 106, which changes parallel<br>
signals into serial signals. The output of the parallel/serial converter 106 is input into a<br>
demapper 107, which changes the data symbols into a bit sequence. For such bit<br>
sequence, the channel decoder 108 performs channel decoding with respect to channel<br>
codes in order to deduce the data.<br>
[32] In a system as shown in Figures 1 and 2, certain repetitive transmission schemes may<br>
be classified in the following manner.<br>
[33]	Repetitive transmission schemes applicable to all systems in which if the feedback<br>
channel is available with one or multiple transceiving antennas may include Automatic<br><br>
Repeat Request (ARQ) schemes, Hybrid ARQ (HARQ) schemes, repetition coding<br>
schemes, etc.<br>
[34] The ARQ scheme employs a method in which the same signal is re-transmitted when<br>
an error occurs in the transmitted packet. The HARQ scheme employs a method in<br>
which the same signal or a different type of signal is re-transmitted when an error<br>
occurs in the transmitted packet The repetition coding scheme employs a method in<br>
which the same signal is repeated many times and transmitted via a single packet, and<br>
such scheme is used for transmission of signals that require accurate reception, such as<br>
control signals.<br>
[35]	Hereafter, repetitive transmission schemes applicable to only systems with multiple<br>
transceiving antennas will be explained. Such schemes may include a space-time<br>
coding scheme, a cyclic delay diversity scheme, a space-time coding based HARQ<br>
scheme, etc.<br>
[36]	The space-time coding scheme employs a method in which the same signal is<br>
transmitted via a different transmit antenna in a subsequent time slot. The cyclic delay<br>
diversity scheme employs a method in which the same signal is transmitted by using<br>
different cyclic delays and different power levels with respect to each antenna. The a<br>
space-time coding based HARQ scheme employs a method in which the initial<br>
transmission is performed according to a spatial multiplexing method, while re-<br>
transmissions are performed in a space-time coding manner if errors occur.<br>
[37]	In communication systems, repetitive transmission schemes have developed in<br>
various ways in order to increase the reliability of the communications environment.<br>
Some repetitive transmission schemes described above are methods that are applicable<br>
to particular communication systems having only one transceiving antenna or multiple<br>
transceiving antennas. Such repetitive transmission schemes operate in the following<br>
manner.<br>
[38] The ARQ scheme is the most basic method for correcting errors when an error<br>
occurs in the transmitted packet. This is a scheme for re-transmitting a packet that is<br>
the same as the transmitted packet, whereby the receiving side discards the erroneous<br>
packet and waits for a new packet.<br>
[39] The HARQ scheme is a combination of the ARQ scheme with channel coding. The<br>
HARQ scheme may be generally classified into two types. The first type is a chase<br>
combining scheme as shown in Figure 3. As shown: in Figure 3, in the chase<br>
combining type HARQ, channel coded packets are transmitted and if the first<br>
transmission failed, the same packet is transmitted during re-transmission. This is the<br><br>
same as the ARQ scheme, but in the chase combining HARQ scheme, erroneous<br>
packets are not discarded but stored in a buffer and later combined with a re-<br>
transmitted packet for error restoration. Thus, errors axe restored by using time<br>
diversity and by increasing signal power.<br>
[40] Figure 4 is a block diagram that shows another example of the HARQ scheme having<br>
an increment redundancy type structure (format). In the increment redundancy type<br>
HARQ scheme, re-transmissions are not performed in the same manner as in the initial<br>
transmission, but the effects of lowering channel coding rate while correcting errors of<br>
a packet are achieved by re-transmitting the additional parity portion of the channel<br>
code.<br>
[41] The repetition coding scheme enqploys a method in which a low channel coding rate<br>
is simply obtained by forming a single packet upon repeating the channel coded blocks<br>
and transmitting the same.<br>
[42] The space-time coding scheme employs a method in which spatial diversity gain is<br>
obtained by transmitting signals via a different transmit antenna with continuously<br>
sending the same signal in a multi-antenna environment. The equation below is the<br>
most basic space-time code and is typically used in a system having two transmitting<br>
antennas.<br><br>
[45] In the above equation, the rows of the matrix represent the transmit antennas while<br>
the columns represent time. As shown in the above equation, the S1 data symbol is<br>
transmitted via the first antenna and then transmitted via the second antenna in the<br>
form of a conjugate complex number, and the S2 data eymbol is transmitted via the<br>
second antenna and then transmitted via the first antenna in the form of a conjugate<br>
' complex number of an opposite code in order to keep the orthogonal proprty between<br>
date symbols. By transmitting in this manner, each data symbol is transmitted trough<br>
all transmit antennas without any inter-symbol interference, thus obtaining full<br>
diversity gain.<br>
[46] Figure 5 is a block diagram showing a cyclic delay diversity scheme. The cyclic<br>
delay diversity scheme is advantageous because when transmitting OFDM symbols in<br>
a system having multiple transmission antennas, as signals are transmitted via all<br><br>
antennas with respectively different delays and/or magnitudes, frequency diversity<br>
gain can be obtained at the receiving side upon combining each delayed signal, and the<br>
complexity of the receiver can be significantly reduced since the signals are combined<br>
and detected (extracted) per each transmission antenna.<br>
[47] Hereafter, the space-time coding based HARQ scheme described above will be<br>
explained. Figure 6 is a drawing to describe a re-transmission method for a space-time<br>
coding based HARQ scheme. Figure 6 shows a scheme of a first transmission and a<br>
second transmission upon reception of its NACK (negative acknowledgement) signal.<br>
[48] As in Figure 6, in a time repetitive re-transmission method using space-time coding,<br>
space diversity gain is additionally acquired when re-transmitting such mat the power<br>
of the re-transmitted signal is increased while diversity gain is also additionally<br>
obtained.<br>
[49] The particular characteristics and effects of the present disclosure will be specified in<br>
more detail as explained hereafter with respect to an embodiment of the present<br>
disclosure.<br>
[SO] The present embodiment relates to a repetitive transmission method. The repetitive<br>
transmission method refers to a scheme in which particular data are transmitted a<br>
plurality of times. When data in transmitted a plurality of times according to the re-<br>
petitive transmission method, the data being transmitted may be the same data or may<br>
be different data. For example, the same data may be transmitted to the receiving side<br>
over a plurality of times. Also, a plurality of same data may be transmitted during a<br>
particular single unit of time. Also, particular data may be transmitted in an initial<br>
transmission, and data resulting from the initially transmitted data having undergone<br>
certain data processing may be transmitted during a second transmission. Also,<br>
particular data may be transmitted in an initial transmission, and a portion of the<br>
initially transmitted data may be transmitted in the second transmission.<br>
[51] As an example of the above-described repetitive transmission method, there is a re-<br>
transmission scheme. The re-transmission scheme refers to a method where the<br>
transmitting side re-transmits data to the receiving side, if the receiving side was not<br>
able to normally reconstruct (decode) the received data. Namely, if the initial<br>
transmission failed, a re-transmission is performed. The data being transmitted through<br>
such re-transmission may be the same data as the initially transmitted data, or may be<br>
data resulting from the initially transmitted data having undergone particular data<br>
processing, or may be a portion of the initially transmitted data.<br>
[52]	Figure 7 is a block diagram showing some concepts in applying the repetitive<br><br>
transmission method according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. Figure 7 is<br>
used to describe the most general concepts of the exemplary embodiment<br>
[53] The example in Figure 7 shows a repetitive transmission scheme for signals having<br>
cyclic delay performed thereto in the time domain with respect to OFDM symbols.<br>
This cyclic delay is conceptually the same as a cyclic shift, whereby a sample included<br>
in an OFDM symbol is cyclically delayed for a particular number of times. The OFDM<br>
symbol refers to a set of data that has been processed using IFFT (Inverse Fast Fourier<br>
Transform) or IDFT (Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform) operations, and has the char-<br>
acteristic of being typically transmitted during the same time period. The above-<br>
mentioned sample refers to the data included in each OFDM symbol, and corresponds<br>
to user data or control signals. Figure 7 shows an example where a single OFDM<br>
symbol includes N samples, and N may be equivalent to the number of sub-carriers<br>
used for communication.<br>
[54] In Figure 7, the OFDM symbol refers to an OFDM symbol that has undergone FFT<br>
or IDFT operations. Namely, the cyclic delay of Figure 7 shows an OFDM symbol<br>
(having undergone FFT or IDFT operations) being cyclically delayed by as much as a<br>
particular sample in the time domain.<br>
[55] Figure 7 shows an example of transmitting an N number of data streams. For each<br>
data stream, a cyclic delay with a respectively different delay value is applied. Namely,<br>
a delay of '0' is applied to a first data stream corresponding to data V, and a power of<br>
g0 is provided. Also, a delay of 'dt' is applied to a second data stream corresponding to<br>
data 's(d1)', and a power of g1 is provided. Also, a delay of 'd N' is applied to an N-th<br>
data stream corresponding to data 's(dN)', and a power of gN is provided. Such first<br>
through N-th data streams may be transmitted via the antennas upon inserting a cyclic<br>
prefix (CP) that equals a certain G number of samples.<br>
[56] In the example of Figure 7, an N number of respectively different cyclic delays may<br>
be applied. Also, an N number of respectively different power controls may be<br>
performed. If the transmissions for a single user are problematic, various cyclic delays<br>
or various power controls may be performed according to the changing channel en-<br>
vironment. Also, if re-transmissions are problematic, various cyclic delays or various<br>
power controls may be performed according to the number of re-transmission oc-<br>
currences. Also, if transmissions for multiple users are problematic, various cyclic<br>
delays or various power controls that are optimized for each user may be performed.<br>
As described above, it is preferable that the cyclic delay or power control values are<br>
changed according to various communication environments. In order to adjust the<br><br>
cyclic delay or power control values in a mote active manner, it is more preferably that<br>
information fed back from the receiving side is used. Namely, the values d1 through<br>
dN or the values g0 through gN can be controlled by using feedback information from<br>
the receiving side.<br>
[57] In the exanple of Figure 7, the number of antennas is not limited, and various<br>
antenna schemes may be applicable. More details regarding such amplication methods<br>
are described below.<br>
[58] In the example of Figure 7, the data 's' through 's(dN)' may be included in a single<br>
data frame or in multiple data frames, and the detailed methods therefor are explained<br>
below.<br>
[59] In the exanple of Figure 1, the data 's' through 's(dN)' may be re-transmission<br>
signals in accordance with ACK/NACK signals transmitted from the receiving side,<br>
and the detailed re-transmission method therefor is explained below.<br>
[60]	In the exanple of Figure 7 may be summarized as follows. The basic concept of a<br>
method using cyclic delay diversity for a time repetitive signal that is proposed in this<br>
exemplary embodiment is shown in Figure 7. Namely, when transmitting a time re-<br>
petitive transmission signal as in Figure 7, it is preferably that each of the repeated<br>
signals has the same or different powers, while having different cyclic delays.<br>
[61] Hereafter, the re-transmission method according to the present embodiment will be<br>
explained with reference to Figures 8 and 9.<br>
[62] Figure 8 is a block diagram showing the concept of performing re-transmissions<br>
according to the present embodiment. Figure 9 is a block diagram showing a scheme<br>
for performing re-transmissions.<br>
[63]	As shown in Figures 8 and 9, data 's' that has not undergone cyclic delay is<br>
transmitted in a first transmission, while data 's(d1)' that has undergone cyclic delay<br>
amounting to dl is transmitted in a first re-transmission. Such re-transmission is<br>
preferably performed when a NACK signal is received. Such re-transmission may be<br>
repeated N times, and if repeated N times, it is preferably that the cyclic delay is<br>
performed according to at least N respectively different cyclic delay values. By the N-<br>
th re-transmission, s(dN) that has been cyclic delayed by dN is transmitted.<br>
[64] For re-transmission, it is preferable that power control is performed. Such power<br>
control is performed according to g0 through gN of Figure 9.<br>
[65] The present embodiment in which cyclic delay diversity is used for the time re-<br>
petitive signal can be applied to any scheme that performs repeated transmissions<br>
according to time.<br><br>
[66] When the present embodiment is applied to the HARQ scheme or the repetition code<br>
scheme, frequency diversity gain can be increased when compared to the related art<br>
methods.<br>
[67] Also, during re-transmissions, regardless of whether the same or different channels<br>
are employed, frequency selectivity can be adjusted by using various power values and<br>
delay values, and thus, frequency diversity gain of a high magnitude can be obtained in<br>
any situation,<br>
[68]	As in Figures 8 and 9, if signals are re-transmitted, the receiving side recognized<br>
each signal as a multi-path signal, and simple detection thereof is possible and because<br>
frequency selectivity can be increased, the overall system performance can be<br>
improved.<br>
[69] As described above, the present embodiment supports various systems having<br>
various numbers of transceiving antennas.<br>
[70] Hereafter, the re-transmission method according to the present embodiment will be<br>
explained by example of application to a multiple antenna system.<br>
[71] Figure 10 is a block diagram showing the concepts of performing re-transmissions<br>
through multiple antennas according to the present embodiment Figure 11 is a block<br>
diagram showing how the re-transmission scheme is performed through multiple<br>
antennas.<br>
[72]	The example of Figure 10 relates to performing re-transmissions through re-<br>
spectively different antennas. Namely, the first transmission is performed through a<br>
first antenna, the first re-transmission is performed through a second antenna, and the<br>
second re-transmission is performed through a third antenna. Also, the first<br>
transmission is to transmit transmission data 's' that has not undergone any cyclic<br>
delay, the first re-transmission is to transmit transmission data s(d1) that has undergone<br>
a cyclic delay of d1, and the second re-transmission is to transmit transmission data s(d<br>
2) that has undergone a cyclic delay of d2.<br>
[73] The example of Figure 11 shows an example that applies the concept of Figure 10.<br>
As shown, re-transmission can be performed for a maximum of N times, and each of<br>
the re-transmitted data can be transmitted through respectively different antennas. The<br>
example of Figure 11 shows when an N number of antennas are used with respect to an<br>
N number of re-transmissions, but the total number of antennas are not limited to such.<br>
For example, when there are 4 re-transmissions and 2 transmit antennas, a possible<br>
transmission scheme would be that the 1st and 3rd re-transmissions go through the 1st<br>
antenna, while the 2nd and 4th re-transmissions go trough the 2nd antenna.<br><br>
[74] The example of Figure 11 shows when certain power control is performed for the<br>
data being re-transmitted. As described above, the power control or cyclic delay may<br>
be based upon information being fed back from the receiving side.<br>
[75] When the re-transmission method of 10 and 11 are employed, respectively different<br>
channels are established per each antenna, and space diversity gain as well as<br>
frequency diversity gain can be obtained. Re-transmissions can also be performed in a<br>
manner other than those shown in Figures 10 and 11.<br>
[76] Namely, among the multiple antenna schemes, a spatial multiplexing scheme that<br>
increases system capacity by obtaining spatial multiplexing gain can be applied. An<br>
exanple thereof is shown in Figures 12 and 13.<br>
[77] Figure 12 is a block diagram showing another concept of performing re-<br>
transmissions through multiple antennas according to the present embodiment. Figure<br>
13 is a block diagram showing a scheme of performing re-transmission through<br>
multiple antennas.<br>
[78] Figure 12, unlike the examples of Figures 10 and 11, shows an exanple where data<br>
re-transmissions are performed at all of the multiple antennas. In Figure 12, S1, S2,...,<br>
SM are respectively different OFDM signals. For exanple, the signals S1 through SM<br>
may be independent OFDM signals, or may be signals, for respectively different M<br>
users. In the exanple of Figure 12, the 1st antenna through the M-th antenna each<br>
transmit particular data. For exanple, the 1st antenna is used for re-transmissions<br>
related to S1, the 2nd antenna is used for re-transmissions related to S2, and the M-th<br>
antenna is used for re-transmissions related to SM.<br>
[79] As shown in Figure 13, data S1 through SM that have not undergone any cyclic<br>
delay can be transmitted in a first data transmission. If a first re-transmission is<br>
performed thereon, a cyclic delay due to a particular cyclic delay value (d1) may be<br>
performed for each of the data S1 through SM.<br>
[80] As shown, when the first transmission or a re-transmission thereof is performed,<br>
power control may be performed upon determining the gO through gM values<br>
according to control information such as channel environment at the like. Also, when<br>
performing the N-th data transmission, the data having undergone a cyclic delay by an<br>
amount of dN as shown in the drawings, can be transmitted through the multiple<br>
antennas.<br>
[81]	If a time-based antenna rotation scheme is applied to the scheme of Figure 12, data<br>
can be repetitively transmitted as in the method of Figures 14 and 15.<br>
[82]	Figure 14 is a block diagram showing another concept of performing re-<br><br>
transmissions through multiple antennas according to the present embodiment. Figure<br>
15 is a block diagram showing a scheme for performing re-transmissions through<br>
multiple antennas.<br>
[83] Figure 14 shows an example in which data re-transmissions are performed at all of<br>
the multiple antennas. In Figure 14, S1, S2,..., SM are respectively different OFDM<br>
signals. In Figure 14, if particular data S1 was transmitted through any one among the<br>
multiple antennas, thereafter, other data excluding S1 are then transmitted. For<br>
example, for the 1st antenna, after S1 is transmitted, S2 data is transmitted instead of<br>
S1, then S3 data and the like may be transmitted thereafter. Also, because particular<br>
data is transmitted by multiple antennas, the data S1 through SM are thus transmitted<br>
to the receiving side at a particular time.<br>
[84] As shown in Figure 15, in the first data transmission, the data S1 through SM that<br>
have not undergone any cyclic delay can be transmitted. When performing a first re-<br>
transmission thereof, a cyclic delay based upon a particular cyclic delay value (d t) may<br>
be performed for each data S1 through SM. Here, the 1st antenna that transmitted SI<br>
then transmits SM(d[) instead of S1(d1) in order to apply an antenna rotation scheme.<br>
Also, the 2nd antenna that transmitted S2 then transmits Sl(d|) instead of S2(d!&gt; in<br>
order to apply an antenna rotation scheme. Also, the M-th antenna that transmitted SM<br>
then transmits SM-l(d1) instead of SM(d1) in order to apply an antenna rotation<br>
scheme.<br>
[85] As shown, in the first transmission or in performing its related re-transmission,<br>
power control may be performed by determining the gO through gM value according to<br>
control information, such as the channel environment, etc. Also, when performing the<br>
N-th data transmission, the data having undergone cyclic delay (by an amount of dN as<br>
depicted) may be transmitted through multiple antennas..<br>
[86] As in Figures 14 and 15, if transmissions are performed upon changing the transmit<br>
antenna of each signal according to time, spatial diversity gain can be additionally<br>
utilized.<br>
[87]	As described above, in the examples in Figures 12 and 14, respectively different<br>
cyclic delays and respectively different power controls may be performed. Also, unlike<br>
what is depicted in Figures 12 and 14, only the signals having error occurrences could<br>
be re-transmitted. Also, for re-transmission, each cyclic delay value and power value<br>
may be received from the receiver as feedback information, or the transmitter may<br>
apply appropriate values therefor.<br>
[88]	A method applicable to the cyclic delay diversity scheme that proposes repetition<br><br>
coding may be achieved according to the examples of Figures 16 and 17.<br>
[89] Figure 16 is a block diagram indicating the data included in a single frame. Figure 17<br>
is a block diagram indicating a method for generating the data frame of Figure 16.<br>
[90] Repetition coding is a scheme that repeals the same data and included such into a<br>
single frame. As the same data is repeated, the effect of lowering the coding rate upon<br>
transmission is created and as a result, the effect of performing accurate data trans-<br>
missions is created.<br>
[91] The repetition coding method according to the present embodiment can generate the<br>
data shown in Figure 16. Namely, a data block including values that have undergone<br>
respectively different cyclic delays with respect to the same data is generated and<br>
transmitted to the receiving side.<br>
[92] The example of Figure 17 depicts a method of generating the data of Figure 16., .<br>
Figure 17 shows an example in which data S that has not undergone any cyclic delay<br>
with respect to the same data S, data S(d1) that has undergone cyclic delay according to<br>
a particular delay value dt, and data S(dN) that has undergone cyclic delay according to<br>
a particular delay value dN are included in a single frame.<br>
[93]	According to the examples of Figures 16 and 17, OFDM symbols that have<br>
undergone cyclic delays in a sequential manner are transmitted N times, which is the<br>
number of times of repetition. Upon such repetition coding transmission, the receiving<br>
side can obtain signal power as well as additional frequency diversity gain, and thus<br>
high performance can be obtained.<br>
[94]	Such repetition coding method can be performed in the time domain or the frequency<br>
domain. The examples of Figures 7 through 17 refer to performing cyclic delays upon<br>
cycling samples in the time domain, but this is merely exemplary, as the same effect as<br>
performing cyclic delay on samples in the time domain may also be obtained by al-<br>
locating a phase sequence in the frequency domain. The cyclic delay method employed<br>
in the repetition signal transmission scheme proposed in the present embodiments are<br>
not intended to be limited to any particular methods, and thus methods for performing<br>
cyclic delays through operations in the frequency domain are also within the scope of<br>
the present disclosure.<br>
[95]	Hereafter, a method of transmitting signals in a cyclic delay manner through op-<br>
erations in the frequency domain will be described.<br>
[96] Figure 18 is a block diagram showing how to implement a cyclic delay transmission<br>
method through frequency rotation (circular shifting).<br>
[97]	In a multi-carrier system such as OFDM, SC-FDMA, etc., an FPT operation (or an<br><br>
equivalent IDFT operation) is performed according to the number of sub-carriers used<br>
for data transmission. The cyclic delay transmission method may be achieved by a<br>
scheme of performing circular shifting (a particular number of times) on the sanples<br>
included within the OFDM symbol in the time domain after the FFT operation is<br>
performed, or by a scheme of applying particular phase components with respect to<br>
frequency conponents prior to performing the FFT operation. Namely, before the<br>
FFT operation are performed, the cyclic delay scheme may be inplemented through<br>
frequency circular shifting.<br>
[98]	As shown in Figure 18, when a certain phase sequence is multiplied to a signal<br>
before prforming the FFT operation, the same effect as a cyclic delay in the time<br>
domain is generated.<br>
[99] Figures 19 and 20 show the changes in signal conponents when cyclic delay is<br>
performed.<br>
[100] Figure 19 shows the original signal conponents before cyclic .delay is performed. If<br>
the original signal undergoes cyclic delay in the time domain by an amount equaling to<br>
a certain cyclic delay value d1, the signal conponents of the original signal then<br>
change to those shown in Figure 20. Namely, upon performing a time delay amounting<br>
to d1, the same effect as performing phase rotation (circular shifting) due to a certain<br>
θ1 corresponding to dl is generated. Namely, performing a time delay of d1 in the<br>
time domain and applying a certain compooent to each sub-carrier in the frequency<br>
domain result in the same effects.<br>
[101] In summary, cyclic delay may be performed by multiplying a particular phase<br>
sequence C1 to the signal of Figure 19, and such phase sequence C1 may be as shown<br>
in the following equation 2.<br>
[104] Figure 21 shows the changes in signal conponents when 3 respectively different<br>
phase sequences are multiplied to a particular signal.<br>
[105] Figure 21 shows the case where a certain phase sequence C(1) is multiplied to a<br>
signal corresponding to a frequency index of 1 through 5, a certain phase sequence<br>
C(2) is multiplied to a signal corresponding to a frequency index of 6 through 10, and<br>
a certain phase sequence C(3) is multiplied to a signal corresponding to a frequency<br>
index of 11 or above. The frequency index 1 through 5 may be for a signal of a<br><br>
particular user 1 (UE1), and a particular phase value 6, may be multiplied to the user 1.<br>
As depicted, the value that has undergone cyclic delay can have various phases. When<br>
a signal that has undergone cyclic delay through a single antenna or multiple antennas<br>
is transmitted, the magnitude of the signal may change according to the respectively<br>
different phase values. In particular, when cyclic delay is applied to a signal that has<br>
undergone channel coding, an advantage that is obtained in that the selectivity at the<br>
receiving side is improved according to changes in signal magnitude.<br>
[106] The present embodiment provides a repetitive signal transmission method with<br>
improved performance through cyclic delays in the time domain or through phase<br>
rotations (circular shifting) in the frequency domain.<br>
[107] The signal repetitive transmission method using a cyclic delay scheme as proposed<br>
by the present disclosure applies cyclic delays to transmit a signal for re-transmission<br>
or repetitive transmission. Accordingly, the receiving side detects these transmitted<br>
signals upon combining thereof, and frequency diversity gain is obtained by increasing<br>
frequency selectivity.<br>
[108] The present disclosure is applicable to any signal that is repeated in time, and in an<br>
OFDM system having multiple transceiving antennas, additional spatial diversity gain<br>
can be obtained by performing transmissions in various forms.<br>
[109] As a result, additional frequency diversity gain can be obtained by the features<br>
described herein mat require low complexity.<br>
[110] The concepts of the present disclosure may be related to Cyclic Shift Transmit<br>
Diversity (CSTD), which is an adaptation of the idea of delay diversity to OFDM<br>
systems. With CSTD, each antenna element in a transmit array sends a circularly<br>
shifted version of the same OFDM time domain symbol. Fere, each antenna adds a<br>
cyclic prefix after circularly shifting the OFDM symbol, and thus the delay-spread<br>
protection offered by the cyclic prefix is unaffected by the CSTD.<br>
[111] The present disclosure provides a method for repetitive transmission using a plurality<br>
of carriers, the method comprising: preparing a plurality of cyclic delays that can be<br>
applied to a plurality of carriers; performing cyclic delays based upon the number of<br>
repetitions for repetitive transmission of data symbols to be transmitted to at least one<br>
receiving side; and transmitting the cyclic delayed data symbols using the plurality of<br>
carriers. The transmitting step may conprise; repetitively transmitting the cyclic<br>
delayed data symbols in a sequential manner in accordance with a reception of a<br>
negative acknowledgement signal from the receiving side. The transmitting step may<br>
be performed through a plurality of antennas. The transmitting step may be performed<br><br>
through a single antenna. A transmitting side of the data symbols respectively<br>
transmitted by the plurality of antennas may be fixed. A transmitting side of me data<br>
symbols respectively transmitted by the plurality of antennas may change according to<br>
the number of repetitions. The transmitting step may be performed by including the<br>
cyclic delayed data symbols into a single frame.<br>
[112] Also, the present disclosure provides a method of repetitive transmissions in multi-<br>
carrier based wireless access techniques, the method comprising: providing multiple<br>
cyclic delay values for a plurality of carriers; performing a cyclic delay procedure<br>
using the multiple cyclic delay values according to the number of repetitive<br>
transmission of data symbols to be transmitted to a receiver; and transmitting the .<br>
cyclic delayed data symbols to the receiver using the plurality of carriers. The<br>
transmitting step may comprise: repetitively transmitting the cyclic delayed data<br>
symbols in a sequential manner in accordance with feedback information from the<br>
receiver. The transmitting step may be performed via multiple antennas. The<br>
transmitting step may be performed via a single antenna. The data symbols may be re-<br>
spectively transmitted via the multiple antennas of a transmitter that is stationary. The<br>
data symbols may be respectively transmitted via the multiple antennas of a transmitter<br>
that changes according to the number of repetitions. The transmitting step may be<br>
performed upon inserting the cyclic delayed data symbols into one data frame.<br>
[113] Additionally, the present disclosure provides an apparatus for performing repetitive<br>
transmissions in multi-carrier based wireless access techniques, the apparatus<br>
comprising: a processor adapted to provide multiple cyclic delay values for a plurality<br>
of carriers and to perform a cyclic delay procedure using the multiple cyclic delay<br>
values according to the number of repetitive transmission of data symbols to be<br>
transmitted to a receiver; and a transmitter cooperating with the processor and adapted<br>
to transmit the cyclic delayed data symbols to the receiver using the plurality of<br>
carriers.<br>
[114] The features and aspects described herein are related to and can be implemented for<br>
various types of communication techniques (such as, but not limited to, broadband<br>
wireless air interface techniques, Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) techniques,<br>
so-called 3.5G or 4G systems designed to provide higher data rates and P-based data<br>
services, etc.) and/or various communication standards (such as, but not limited to,<br>

etc.). As such, at least some of the features described herein are applicable to such<br>
standards that have been developed or that are continuing to evolve.<br><br>
