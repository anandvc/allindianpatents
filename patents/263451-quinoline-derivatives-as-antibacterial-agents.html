				<td>QUINOLINE DERIVATIVES AS ANTIBACTERIAL AGENTS<br>
The present invention relates to the use of quinoline derivatives for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a bacterial infection.<br>
Resistance to first-line antibiotic agents is an emerging problem. Some important examples include penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, multi-resistant salmonellae.<br>
The consequences of resistance to antibiotic agents are severe. Infections caused by resistant microbes fail to respond to treatment, resulting in prolonged illness and greater risk of death. Treatment failures also lead to longer periods of infectivity, which increase the numbers of infected people moving in the community and thus exposing the general population to the risk of contracting a resistant strain infection. Hospitals are a critical component of the antimicrobial resistance problem worldwide. The combination of highly susceptible patients, intensive and prolonged antimicrobial use, and cross-infection has resulted in infections with highly resistant bacterial pathogens.<br>
Self-medication with antimicrobials is another major factor contributing to resistance. Self-medicated antimicrobials may be unnecessary, are often inadequately dosed, or may not contain adequate amounts of active drug.<br>
Patient compliance with recommended treatment is another major problem. Patients forget to take medication, interrupt their treatment when they begin to feel better, or may be unable to afford a full course, thereby creating an ideal environment for microbes to adapt rather than be killed.<br>
Because of the emerging resistance to multiple antibiotics, physicians are confronted with infections for which there is no effective therapy. The morbidity, mortality, and financial costs of such infections impose an increasing burden for health care systems worldwide.<br>
Therefore, there is a high need for new compounds to treat bacterial infections, especially for the treatment of infections caused by resistant strains.<br><br>
Substituted quinolines were already disclosed in US 5,965,572 (The United States of<br>
America) for treating antibiotic resistant infections and in WO 00/34265 to inhibit the<br>
growth of bacterial microorganisms.<br>
WO 2004/011436, WO2005/070924, WO2005/070430 and WO2005/075428 disclose<br>
substituted quinoline derivatives having activity against Mycobacteria, in particular<br>
against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. One particular compound of these substituted<br>
quinoline derivatives is described in Science (2005), 307,223-227.<br>
None of these publications disclose the use of the present substituted quinoline<br>
derivatives according to this invention.<br>

In the framework of this application, the quinoline ring of the compounds of Formula (la) or (Ib) is numbered as follows:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br>
The         <br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
radical may be placed on any available position of the quinoline<br>
moiety.<br>
In the definition of Het, it is meant to include all the possible isomeric forms of the heterocycles, for instance, pyrrolyl comprises 1H-pyrrolyl and 2H-pyrrolyl.<br>
The AT or Het listed in the definitions of the substituents of the compounds of Formula (la) or (Ib) (see for instance R3) as mentioned hereinbefore or hereinafter may be attached to the remainder of the molecule of Formula (la) or (Ib) through any ring carbon or heteroatom as appropriate, if not otherwise specified. Thus, for example, when Het is imidazolyl, it may be 1-imidazolyl, 2-imidazolyl, 4-imidazolyl and the like.<br>
Lines drawn from substituents into ring systems indicate that the bond may be attached to any of the suitable ring atoms.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts are defined to comprise the therapeutically active non-toxic acid addition salt forms which the compounds according to either Formula (la) or (Ib) are able to form. Said acid addition salts can be obtained by treating the base form of the compounds according to either Formula (la) or (Ib) with appropriate acids, for example inorganic acids, for example hydrohalic acid, in particular hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid ; organic acids, for example acetic acid, hydroxyacetic acid, propanoic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, benzenesuulfonic acid, p-tohienesulfonic acid, cyclamic acid, salicyclic acid, p-aminosalicylic acid and paraoic acid.<br>
The compounds according to either Formula (la) or (Ib) containing acidic protons may also be converted into their therapeutically active non-toxic base addition salt forms by treatment with appropriate organic and inorganic bases. Appropriate base salts forms comprise, for example, the ammonium salts, the alkaline and earth alkaline metal salts, in particular lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium salts, salts with<br><br>
organic bases, e.g. the benzathine, N-methyl-D-glucamine, hybramine salts, and salts with amino acids, for example arginine and lysine.<br>
Conversely, said acid or base addition salt forms can be converted into the free forms by treatment with an appropriate base or acid.<br>
The term addition salt as used in the framework of this application also comprises the solvates which the compounds according to either Formula (la) or (Ib) as well as the salts thereof, are able to form. Such solvates are, for example, hydrates and alcoholates.<br>
The term "quaternary amine" as used hereinbefore defines the quaternary ammonium salts which the compounds of formula (I) are able to form by reaction between a basic nitrogen of a compound of formula (I) and an appropriate quaternizing agent, such as, for example, an optionally substituted alkylhalide, arylalkylhalide, alkylcarbonylhalide, Arcarbonylhalide, Hetalkylhalide or Hetcarbonylhalide, e.g. methyliodide or benzyliodide. Preferably, Het represents a monocyclic heterocycle selected from furanyl or thienyl; or a bicyclic heterocycle selected from benzoturanyl or benzothienyl; each monocyclic and bicyclic heterocycle may optionally be substituted with 1,2 or 3 substituents, each substituent independently selected from the group of halo, alkyl and Ar. Preferably, the quaternizing agent is alkylhalide. Other reactants with good leaving groups may also be used, such as alkyl trifluoromethanesulfonates, alkyl methanesulfonates, and alky] p-toluenesulfonates. A quaternary amine has a positively charged nitrogen. Pharmaceutically acceptable counterions include chloro, bromo, iodo, trifluoroacetate, acetate, triflate, sulfate, sulfonate. Preferably, the counterion is iodo. The counterion of choice can be introduced using ion exchange resins.<br>
Compounds of either Formula (la) or (Ib) and some of the intermediate compounds invariably have at least one stereogenic center in their structure which may lead to at least 2 stereochemically different structures.<br>
The term "stereochemically isomeric forms" as used herein defines all possible isomeric forms which the compounds of either Formula (la) or (Ib) may possess. Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of compounds denotes the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms, said mixtures containing all diastereomers and enantiomers of the basic molecular structure. More in<br><br>
particular, stereogenic centers may have the R- or S-configuration; substituents on bivalent cyclic (partially) saturated radicals may have either the cis- or trans-configuratioa Stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of either Formula (la) or (Ib) are obviously intended to be embraced within the scope of this invention.<br>
Following CAS-nomenclature conventions, when two stereogenic centers of known absolute configuration are present in a molecule, an R or S descriptor is assigned (based on Cahn-Ingold-Prelog sequence rule) to the lowest-numbered chiral center, the reference center. The configuration of the second stereogenic center is indicated using relative descriptors [R*,R* ] or [R*,S*], where R* is always specified as the reference center and [R*,R8] indicates centers with the same chirality and [R*,S*] indicates centers of unlike chirality. For example, if the lowest-numbered chiral center in the molecule has an S configuration and the second center is R, the stereo descriptor would be specified as S-R*,S*]. If "α " and "ß" are used: the position of the highest priority substituent on the asymmetric carbon atom in the ring system having the lowest ring number, is arbitrarily always in the "a" position of the mean plane determined by the ring system. The position of the highest priority substituent on the other asymmetric carbon atom in the ring system relative to the position of the highest priority substituent on the reference atom is denominated "a", if it is on the same side of the mean plane determined by the ring system, or "ß", if it is on the other side of the mean plane determined by the ring system.<br>
When a specific stereoisomeric form is indicated, this means that said form is substantially tree, i.e. associated with less than 50 %, preferably less than 20 %, more preferably less than 10 %, even more preferably less than 5%, further preferably less than 2 % and most preferably less than 1 % of the other isomer(s). Thus, when a compound of Formula (la) or (Ib) is for instance specified as (S), this means that the compound is substantially free of the (R) isomer.<br>
The compounds of either Formula (la) and (Ib) may be synthesized in the form of racemic mixtures of enantiomers which can be separated from one another following art-known resolution procedures. The racemic compounds of either Formula (la) and (Ib) may be converted into the corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by reaction with a suitable chiral acid. Said diastereomeric salt forms are subsequently separated, for example, by selective or fractional crystallization and the enantiomers are liberated therefrom by alkali. An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of either Formula (la) and (Ib) involves liquid chromatography using a<br><br>
chiral stationary phase. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.<br>
The tautomeric forms of the compounds of either Formula (la) or (Ib) are meant to comprise those compounds of either Formula (la) or (Ib) wherein e.g. an enol group is converted into a keto group (keto-enol tautomerism).<br>
The N-oxide forms of the compounds according to either Formula (la) or (Ib) are meant to comprise those compounds of either Formula (la) or (Ib) wherein one or several nitrogen atoms are oxidized to the so-called Af-oxide, particularly those N-oxides wherein the nitrogen of the amine radical is oxidized.<br>
The invention also comprises derivative compounds (usually called "pro-drugs") of the pharmacologically-active compounds according to the invention, which are degraded in vivo to yield the compounds according to the invention. Pro-drugs are usually (but not always) of lower potency at the target receptor than the compounds to which they are degraded. Pro-drugs are particularly useful when the desired compound has chemical or physical properties that make its administration difficult or inefficient. For example, the desired compound may be only poorly soluble, it may be poorly transported across the mucosal epithelium, or it may have an undesirably short plasma half-life. Further discussion on pro-drugs may be found in Stella, V. J. et al., "Prodrugs", Drug Delivery Systems, 1985, pp. 112-176, and Drugs, 1985, 29, pp. 455-473.<br>
Pro-drugs forms of the pharmacologically-active compounds according to the invention will generally be compounds according to either Formula (la) or (Ib), the phannaceutically acceptable acid or base addition salts thereof, the stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, the tautomeric forms thereof and the N-oxide forms thereof, having an acid group which is esterified or amidated. Included in such esterified acid groups are groups of the formula -COORx, where Rx is a C1-6alkyl, phenyl, benzyl or one of the following groups :<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Amidated groups include groups of the formula - CONRyRz, wherein Ry is H, C1-6alkyl, phenyl or benzyl and Rz is -OH, H, C1-6alkyl, phenyl or benzyl.<br>
Compounds according to the invention having an amino group may be derivatised with a ketone or an aldehyde such as formaldehyde to form a Mannich base. This base will hydrolyze with first order kinetics in aqueous solution.<br>
Whenever used hereinafter, the term "compounds of Formula (la) or (Ib)" is meant to also include their N-oxide forms, their salts, their quaternary amines, their tautomeric forms or their stereochemically isomeric forms. Of special interest are those compounds of formula (la) or (Ib) which are stereochemically pure.<br>
An interesting embodiment of the present invention relates to those compounds of<br>
Formula (la) or (Ib), the pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base addition salts thereof,<br>
the quaternary amines thereof, the stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, the<br>
tautomeric forms thereof and the n-oxide forms thereof, wherein<br>

Two mobile phases (mobile phase A: 85% 6.5mM ammonium acetate + 15% acetonitrile; mobile phase B: 20% 6.5 mM ammonium acetate + 80% acetonitrile) were employed to run a gradient condition from 100 % A for 3 minutes to 100% B in 5 minutes, 100% B at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/minute<br><br>
for 6 minutes to 100 % A at O.8ml/minute in 3 minutes, and reequilibrate with 100 % A for 3 minutes.<br>

Pharmacological examples<br>
Preparation of bacterial suspensions for susceptibility testing:<br>
The bacteria used in this study were grown overnight in flasks containing 100 ml Mueller-Hinton Broth (Becton Dickinson - cat. no. 275730) in sterile de-ionized water, with shaking, at 37 °C. Stocks (0.5 ml/tube) were stored at -70 °C until use. Bacteria titrations were performed in microtiter plates and colony forming units (CFUs) were determined. In general, an inoculum level of approximately 100 CFUs was used for susceptibility testing.<br>
And bacterial Susceptibility testing: IC90  determination<br>
Microtitre plate assay<br>
Flat-bottom, sterile 96-well plastic microtiter plates were filled with 180µl of sterile deionized water, supplemented with 0.25 % BSA. Subsequently, stock solutions (7.8 x final test concentration) of compounds were added in 45µl volumes in column 2. Serial five-fold dilutions (45 µl in 180 µl) were made directly in the microtiter plates from column 2 to reach column 11. Untreated control samples with (column 1) and without (column 12) inoculum were included in each microtiter plate. Depending on the bacteria type, approximately 10 to 60 CFU per well of bacteria inoculum (100 TCID50), in a volume of 100 µl in 2.8x Mueller-Hinton broth medium, was added to the rows A to H, except column 12. The same volume of broth medium without inoculum was added to column 12 in row A to H. The cultures were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours under a normal atmosphere (incubator with open air valve and continuous ventilation). At the end of incubation, one day after inoculation, the bacterial growth<br><br>
was quantitated fluorometrically. Therefore resazurin (0.6 mg/ml) was added in a volume of 20 ul to all wells 3 hours after inoculation, and the plates were re-incubated overnight. A change in colour from blue to pink indicated the growth of bacteria. The fluorescence was read in a computer-controlled fluoromeler (Cytoiluor Biosearch) at an excitation wavelength of 530 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm. The % growth inhibition achieved by the compounds was calculated according to standard methods. The IC90 (expressed in µg/ml) was defined as the 90 % inhibitory concentration for bacterial growth. The results are shown in Table 2.<br>
Agar dilution method.<br>
MIC99 values (the minimal concentration for obtaining 99 % inhibition of bacterial growth) can be determined by performing the standard Agar dilution method according to NCCLS standards* wherein the media used includes Mueller-Hirtton agar.<br>

Time kill assays<br>
Bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity of the compounds may be determined in a time kill assay using the broth microdilution method *. In a time kill assay on Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA), the starting inoculum of S. aurues and MRSA is 106 CFU / ml in Muller Hinton broth. The antibacterial compounds are used at the concentration of 0.1 to 10 times the MIC (i.e. IC90 as determined in microtitre plate assay). Wells receiving no antibacterial agent constitute the culture growth control. The plates containing the microorganism and the test compounds are incubated at 37 °C. After 0,4,24, and 48 hrs of incubation samples are removed for determination of viable counts by serial dilution (10-1 to 10-6) in sterile PBS and plating (200 ul) on Mueller Hinton agar. The plates are incubated at 37 °C for 24 hrs and the number of colonies are determined. Killing curves can be constructed by plotting the logjoCFU per ml versus time. A bactericidal effect is commonly defined as 3-logio decrease in number of CFU per ml as compared to untreated inoculum. The potential carryover effect of the drugs is removed by serial dilutions and counting the colonies at highest dilution used for plating. No carryover effect is observed at the dilution of 10-2 used for plating. This results in limit of detection 5 X 102 CFU / ml or

Determination of cellular ATP levels<br>
In order to analyse the change in the total cellular ATP concentration (using ATP bioluminescence Kit, Roche), assays are carried out by growing a culture of S. aureus (ATCC29213) stock in 100 ml Mueller Hinton flasks and incubate in a shaker-incubator for 24 hrs at 37 °C (300 rpm). Measure OD405 nm and calculate the CFU/ml. Dilute the cultures to 1 x 106 CFU/ml (final concentration for ATP measurement: 1 x 10s CFU/100 µl per well) and add test compound at 0.1 to 10 times the MTC (i.e.IC90 as determined in microtitre plate assay). Incubate these tubes for 0, 30 and 60 minutes at 300 rpm and 37°C. Use 0.6 ml bacterial suspension from the snap-cap tubes and add to a new 2 ml eppendorf tubes. Add 0.6 ml cell lysis reagent ( Roche kit), vortex at max speed and incubate for S minutes at room temperature. Cool on ice. Let the luminometer warm up to 30°C (Luminoskan Ascent Labsystems with injector). Fill one column (= 6 wells) with 100 µl of the same sample. Add 100 µl Luciferase reagent to each well by using the injector system. Measure the luminescence for 1 sec.<br><br>
