				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be per formed.<br>
It has already been proposed of a bicycle consisting mainly two wheels, a drive gear/paddle gear, a free wheel and a chain. The drive gear is conventional shafted. It is connected with an existing free wheel attached to one side of the hubs of the rear wheel of the existing bicycle with a chain. The speed of a bicycle achieved by normal paddling the drive gear cannot meet the expectation of the riders.<br>
In many countries, many attempts have been made to drive in more speed by improving the existing bicycle. In this context, it is not unnecessary to cite the main features of patented some bicycles in U. S. A.. Most of these patented bicycles consist basically derailer system of multi chain-gear governed by different techniques. The speeds or such inventions are incresed or decresed by derailing the single chain from a gear to smaller or larger gear of the multi gear-free wheel. The ranges of speeds of such inventions are not enough to meet our present day-demands and expectations.<br>
One needs comparatively more speedy bike to get the advantage of less rolling friction between two tyres of the two wheels and road surface at higher speed to have a comfortable journey. However, the speed of this 'less' rolling friction is limited by air resistance. One needs quick paddling to move fast on such a bike, which becomes laborious soon though mechanical advantage is obtained in speedy motion.<br>
Hence slow paddling with little mechanical disadvantage yielding speedy motion would be fit for a comfortable and long time journey<br>
The principal object of this invention is to ride fast during long time of a journey.<br>
The another abject of this invention is to decrease dissipation of energy against frictional forces.<br>
(2)<br><br>
Field of Invention:<br>
The invention "Imporved bicycle" relates the mechanical field of invention.<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
According to this invention this bicycle consists of two main components namely a Common Gear system and an Accelerating free wheel shown in fig. 1 and fig.-2 on the sheet -1 respectively. The common gear system consists of a solid shaft and a concentric hollow shaft. The solid shaft (1 -1) is embeded in the hollow shaft with a set of two similar ball-bearings (2, 2). The concentric hollow shaft (3-3) is embeded in the hollow cylindrical outer with a set of two large similar ball bearings (4,4). Two chain gears (5,6) of different diameters are fastened at the both ends of the hollow shaft.<br>
The accelerating free wheel is nothing but an existing free wheel comprises two parallel chain gears (7,8) of different diameters shown in fig. 2 on the sheet -1.<br>
The common gear system is housed in the front portion of the body perpendicular to the plane of the body frame. A paddle gear (9) is attached to the solid shaft at the side to that of the smaller gear (5) of the hollow shaft. The accelerating free wheel is mounted on the hubs of the rear wheel at the side to that of paddle gear w.r.t. the body frame and also an existing free wheel at the other side. The common gear system, the accelerating free wheel and the existing free wheel are combined with three chains of required lengths. The combined arrangement is shown fig.3 on the sheet - 2. The view of the improved bicycle is shown in fig. 4 on the sheet - 3.<br>
The first chain called drive chain (c1) connects the paddle gear and the smaller gear of the accelerating free wheel. The second chain (c2) connects the other gear of the accelerating free wheel and the smaller gear of the hollow shaft at the same side of the invention. The third chain (c3) connects the other gear of the hollow shaft and the existing free wheel at the other side of the invention.<br>
(3)<br><br>
Brief description of the accompanying drawings:<br>
Figure-1 on the sheet-1 shows a sketch of the common gear system with its principal components :- (1-1) solid shaft/axle, (2,2) ballbearings, (3-3) concentric hollow shaft, (4,4) large ball bearings, (5) chain gear and (6) larger chain gear.<br>
Figure-2 on the sheet -1 shows a sketch of the accelerating free wheel with its main components :- (7) chain gear and (8) large chain gear.<br>
Figure-3 on the sheet- 2 shows a diagram of the combined arrangement. Here (9) paddle gear and (10) existing free wheel are included.<br>
Figure-4 on the sheet - 3 shows the view of the invention c. g. s. -common gear system, a. f. w. - accelerating free wheel, c1 - first/drive chain, c2 - second chain, c3 - third chain.<br>
Details of the invention:<br>
According to this invention the bicycle consists of two main components - a common gear system and an accelerating free wheel, an existing free wheel and three chains.<br>
The common gear system comprises a solid shaft and a concentric hollow cylindrical shaft. The solid shaft (1-1) is embeded in hollow shaft (3-3) with a set of two similar ball bearings (2,2). The concentric hollow shaft is embeded in a hollow cylindrical outer with a set of two similar large ball bearings (4,4). This new technique enables the solid shaft and concentric hollow shaft rotate independently and co-axially. A chain gear (5) having diameter of about 5.5 cm. of 16 teeth and chain gear (6) having diameter of about 8.0 cm. of 22 teeth are fastened at the both ends of the hollow shaft.<br>
The accelerating free wheel is nothing but an existing free wheel having two attached parallel chain gears of diameters abouts 5.5 cm. (7) and 8.0 cm. (8) of teeth 16 and 22 respectively.<br>
(4)<br><br>
The common gear system is housed in the front portion of the body frame. A paddle gear/drive gear (9) having diameter of about 16.5 cm. of 48 teeth is attached to the solid shaft at the side to that of the smaller chain gear (5) of the hollow shaft. The accelerating free wheel with smaller chain gear (7) outward is mounted on the hubs (11) of the rear wheel at the side to that of paddle gear. Also an existing free wheel (10) having diameter of about 6.5 cm. of 18 teeth at the other side.<br>
The common gear system is combined with the accelerating free wheel and the free wheel (10) with three chains of adequate lengths. This combined arrangement is shown-in fig. 3 on the sheet 2. The first chain called drive chain (c1) connects the paddle gear (9) and the outer gear (7) of the accelerating free wheel. The second chain (c2) connects the other gear (8) of the accelerating free wheel and the smaller chain gear (5) of the hollow shaft of the common gear system. The drive chain (c1) and the second chain (c2) are at the same side of this invention w.r.t. the plane of the body frame. The third chain (c3) is connected between the other chain gear (6) of the hollow shaft and the free wheel (10) at the other side of this improved bicycle.<br>
One's Daddling at the beginning rotates the accelerating free wheel and hence the initial starting of the rear wheel. It makes the accelerating free wheel rotate three times the rotations of the drive gear. The second chain is driven in higher speed w. r. t. the first chain and causes increased r. p. m. of the hollow shaft of the common gear system by about 1.4 times. This causes the third chain at the other side drive in further more speed w. r. t. the second chain. This increasing the r. p. m. of the free wheel and hence the rear wheel of this bicycle by about five times the rotations of the drive gear, yields the speedy motion of the improved bicycle.<br>
