"DISPERSE DYE MIXTURES"<br>
BASF   AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT,    a   German    company,    of   D-67056 Ludwigshafen, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br>

DISPERSE DYE MIXTURES<br>
This invention relates to mixtures of disoerse dyes, compositions comprising dispersions of such mixtures and processes for the colouration of svntheti materials with such mixtures .  More particularly, the invention relaces to mixtures of reddish blue monoazo dyes with those of the so called pyrroline type, which tend to be greenish blue.<br>
Monoazo dyes of the above type are disclosed in EP-A-0300626 and E9-A-0347685.<br>
As a component of a mixture of dyes, EP-A-0300626 discloses a dye of the formula<br><br>
where  X   is  Br,   C1  or   I;   Q   is  C,_.,alkyl;   and each  of  Rl  and R2   indeoendently  is  C 1-4 alky!   or  C2-4 alkeny1.<br>

where XA is C4H9 and YA is CH (CH3) C5Hl2..<br>
It is found that certain mixtures, although giving bright shades on polyester when viewed in normal daylight, tend to exhibit a "red" flare in tungsten light which is a serious commercial disadvantage.<br>
lease one of the mixtures disclosed in EP-A-G347535, such a mixture is especially sensitive to reduction and has a relatively low heat: fastness.  Likewise flare can be avoided by using a dye mixture in which the nicrochioohene carries an acetyl group-  However, such-dyes tend to be expensive.<br>
We have found surprisingly chat a mixture of dyes, as defined below, surprisingly not only allows reduction or even elimination of the "red" flare, but provides a much brighter shade and is less sensitive to reduction with consecruent loss of shade.<br>
Thus, the invention provides a mixture of dyestufis containing at least (A) at least one monoazo dye of the formula (I)<br><br><br>
