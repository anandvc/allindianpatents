EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0018]    In accordance with the first to third aspects of the present invention, since the body<br>
is formed from a plurality of body members having different strengths such that at least part<br>
of the low pressure passage and the low pressure chamber is formed from the body member<br>
having a low strength, it is possible to reduce the cost by not forming the entire body from a<br>
material having a higher strength than required.<br>
[0019]    Furthermore, in accordance with the second aspect of the present invention, since the<br>
body is formed by joining the high strength first body member and the low strength second<br>
body member, it is possible to further reduce the cost by employing neither too much nor too<br>
little of a portion formed from a high strength material for a portion on which high pressure gas acts<br>
so that the proportion of the low strength second body member occupying the overall body is<br>
increased.    Moreover, since the fitting projection, which is projectingly provided integrally<br>
with the first body member coaxially with the insertion hole, which coaxially houses the valve<br>
mechanism, is hermetically fitted into the second body member, it is possible to easily obtain<br><br>
concentricity for the first and second body members.<br>
[0020]    Moreover, in accordance with the third aspect of the present invention, since the<br>
housing chamber housing heating means or the heating medium passage through which the<br>
heating medium flows is formed between joining faces of body members that are joined to each<br>
other, it is possible to avoid an increase in the overall size of the body due to the formation of the<br>
heating medium passage or the housing chamber, it is unnecessary to form a heating medium<br>
passage or a housing chamber using another component, thus preventing any increase in the number<br>
of components, and it is possible to prevent the temperature of the body from decreasing.<br>
[0021]    In accordance with the fourth aspect of the present invention, since the housing<br>
chamber housing heating means or the heating medium passage through which the heating<br>
medium flows is formed between joining faces of the body members, it is possible to avoid an<br>
increase in tlie overall size of tiie body due to the formation of the heating medium passage or the<br>
housing chamber, it is unnecessary to form a heating medium passage or a housing chamber using<br>
another component, thus preventing any increase in the number of components, and it is possible to<br>
prevent the temperature of the body from decreasing.<br>
[0022]    Furthermore, in accordance with the fifth aspect of the present invention, since the<br>
fitting projection, which is projectingly provided integrally with the first body member<br>
coaxially with the valve body is hermetically fitted into the second body member, it is<br>
possible to easily obtain concentricity for the first and second body members.<br>
[0023]    In accordance with the sixth aspect of the present invention, since the heating<br>
medium passage or the housing chamber is disposed so as to surround the valve body and the<br>
valve seat, it is possible to heat effectively the surroundings of the valve seat and the valve body,<br>
whose temperatures easily decrease during the pressure reduction action accompanying operation of<br>
the valve mechanism and, moreover, due to the heating medium passage or the housing chamber<br>
having an arc shape the surroundings of the valve seat and the valve body can be substantially evenly<br>
heated.<br>
[0024]    In accordance with the seventh aspect of the present invention, it is possible to heat<br>
more effectively the surroundings of the valve seat and the valve body, whose temperatures easily<br>
decrease during the pressure reduction action accompanying operation of the valve mechanism.<br>
[0025]    In accordance with the eighth aspect of the present invention, it is unnecessary to<br>
carry out machining for forming the groove, thus reducing the cost.<br>
[0026]    In accordance with the ninth aspect of the present invention, it is possible to heat the<br>
body by utilizing engine cooling water effectively.<br>
[0027]    Moreover, in accordance with tenth aspect of the present invention, it is possible to<br>
freely heat the body by the electric heater.<br>

[0044] In such an electromagnetic cut-On vaiVC z,l, uy cutting On tiic suppiy oi cicctiic power to the coil 32 the plunger 37 is moved in a dfrection in which it moves away from the fixed core 36 by the spring force of the return spring 38, the rubber seal 54 of the main valve portion 41b is seated on the valve seat 46 so as to cut off the main valve chamber 45 from the third high pressure passage 30, the pilot valve portion 41a is also seated on the rubber seal 53 so as to cut off the pilot valve chamber 52 from the third high pressure passage 30, and supply of high pressure compressed natural gas to the third high pressure passage 30 side is stopped.<br>
[0045] On the other hand, when electric power is supplied to the coil 32, the plunger 37 first moves toward the fixed core 36 side by the extent to which the pilot valve portion 41a moves away from the rubber seal 53, and the second passage 49 communicating with the third high pressure passage 30 via the first passage 48 communicates with the pilot valve chamber 52. This allows compressed natural gas to gradually flow from the main valve chamber 45 to the third high pressure passage 30 through the pilot valve chamber 52, the second passage 49, and the first passage 48, and the difference m pressure acting on the main valve portion 41b from the main valve chamber 45 and the third high pressure passage 30 side decreases. When the electromagnetic force of the coil 32 exceeds the difference in pressure acting on the main valve portion 41b, the plunger 37 moves fiirther toward the fixed core 36 side, the rubber seal 54 of the mam valve portion 41b moves away from the valve seat 46, and compressed natural gas flows from the main valve chamber 45 to the third high pressure passage 30.<br><br>

[0084] The diaphragm cover 17 is thus formed by press forming thin metal, thereby reducing the cost and weight as well as the size. Moreover, the spring load of the rear coil spring 74 can be changed according to changes in the axial back and forth position of the adjustment member 72, the valve body 59 has acting on it a force in a valve-closing direction due to the difference in pressure between the pressure action chamber 116 and the spring chamber 117 and due to the spring force of the rear coil spring 74 and a force in a valve-opening direction due to the spring force of the coil spring 118 provided in a compressed state between the diaphragm cover 17 and the diaphragm 115, and by adjusting the spring load of the rear coil spring 74 the same action as that of adjustment of the spring load of the coil spring 118 between the diaphragm cover 17 and the diaphragm 115 can be obtained.<br>
[0085] Moreover, since the insertion hole 25 opening on the side opposite to the diaphragm cover 17 is provided in the first body member 18 of the body 16 so as to be coaxial with the valve body 59 so that the valve mechanism 20, which includes the valve body 59, can be inserted into the insertion hole 25, and the open end of the insertion hole 25 is hermetically closed by the adjustment member 72, assembly can be carried out by inserting the valve mechanism 20, which includes the valve body 59, into the insertion hole 25 from the opposite side to the diaphragm 115 and screwing the adjustment member 72 thereinto, thus enhancing the ease of assembly and thereby hermetically<br><br>
closing the insertion hole 25 with the adjustment member 72.<br>
[0086] Furthermore, since the baclc pressure chamber 84, which communicates with the pressure reduction chamber 83 while being hermetically separated from the first to fourth high pressure passages 27,28, 30, and 64 formed within the first body member 18 of the body 16, is formed within the insertion hole 25 whose open end is hermetically closed by the adjustment member 72, so that the other end of the valve body 59 faces the back pressure chamber 84, it is possible to smoothly operate the valve body 59 by making the pressure of the pressure reduction chamber 83 act on opposite ends of the valve body 59 so that there is no difference in pressure that will drive the valve body 59 in the axial direction, and even if swarf is formed due to rubbing of a member that is in contact with the rear coil spring 74, it is possible to prevent as far as possible the swarf fi-om being caught between the valve body 59 and the valve seat 58.<br>
[0087] Furthermore, the body 16 is formed by joining the plurality of body members having different strengths, in this embodiment the first and second body members 18 and 19, and all of the first to fourth high pressure passages 27, 28, 30, and 64, through which high pressure gas flows, are formed within the first body member 18, which has a high strength, and at least some of the small diameter communication passage 85. the outlet passage 86, the valve hole 94. and the communication passage 119, which are first to fourth low pressure passages, and the pressure reduction chamber 83, the back pressure chamber 84, and the pressure action chamber 116, which are furst to third low pressure chambers, in this embodiment the outlet passage 86, the valve hole 94, and the communication passage 119, are formed in the second body member 19, which has a low strength, and it is thus possible to reduce the cost by avoiding forming the entire body 16 from a material having a higher strength than required. Moreover, by employing neither too much nor too little of a portion formed fi"om a high strength material for a portion on which high pressure gas acts, llie proportion of the low strength second body member 19 occupying tlie entire body 16 is mcreased, thus fiirther reducing the cost.<br>
[0088] Furthermore, the valve mechanism 20 having the valve hole 68 opening in a central part and having the valve body 59 that can be seated on the valve seat 58 facmg the valve chamber 66 communicating with the furst to fourth high pressure passages 27, 28, 30, and 64 is housed within the body 16, the valve hole 68 communicating with the small diameter communication passage 85, the outiet passage 86, the valve hole 94, and the communication passage 119, which are first to fourth low pressure passages, and the pressure reduction chamber 83, the back pressure chamber 84, and the pressure action chamber 116, which are first to third low pressure chambers, and the valve body 59 being connected to the diaphragm 115 that operates in response to the pressure of the pressure reduction chamber 83, which communicates with the outlet passage 86; the insertion hole 25, which coaxially houses the valve mechanism 20, is provided in the high strength first body member 18, the first and second body members 18 and 19 are joined so as to overlap each other in a direction along the axis of the valve body 59 while forming the pressure reduction chamber 83 therebetween, and the<br><br>
circular cross-section fitting projection 18a integrally and projectingly provided on the first body member 18 coaxially with the insertion hole 25 is hermetically fitted into the second body member 19, thus making it possible to easily obtain concentricity for the first and second body members 18 and 19.<br>
[0089] Furthermore, since at least one of joining faces of the first and second body members 18 and 19, in this embodiment the face of the second body member 19 joining it to the first body member 18, is provided with the groove 110 for forming between the two body members 18 and 19 that are joined to each other the heating medium passage 109 through which the heating medium flows, it is possible to avoid the overall size of the body 16 from mcreasing due to the formation of the heating medium passage 109, it is unnecessary to form a heating medium passage usmg another component, thus preventing any increase in the number of components, and it is possible to prevent Ihe iemperaLure of (he body 16 from decreasmg.<br>
[0090] Moreover, since the second body member 19 in which the groove 110 is formed is molded, and the groove 110 is formed at the same time as molding of the second body member 19, it is unnecessary to carry out machining for forming the groove 110, thus reducing the cost. [0091] Furthermore, since the heatmg medium passage 109 is formed in an arc shape surrounding the valve body 59 and the valve seat 58 when viewed in a direction along the axis of the valve body 59, it is possible to heat effectively the surroundings of the valve seat 58 and the valve body 59, whose temperatures easily decrease during the pressure reduction action accompanying operation of the valve mechanism 20 and, moreover, due to the heating medium passage 109 having an arc shape the surroundings of the valve seat 58 and the valve body 59 can be substantially evenly heated. [0092] Furthermore, the heating medium passage 109 is disposed at substantially the same position as the valve seat 58 in the direction along the axis of the valve body 59, and it is possible to heat effectively the surroundings of the valve seat 58 and the valve body 59, whose temperatures easily decrease during the pressure reduction action accompanying operation of the valve mechanism 20.<br>
[0093] Moreover, since engine cooling water is introduced into the heating medium passage 109, the body 16 can be heated by utilizing effectively the engine cooling water.<br>
[0094] Furthermore, the valve shaft 105 for operatively connecting the central part of the diaphragm 115 and the valve body 59 of the valve mechanism 20 extends slidably through the partition wall 78 disposed between the pressure action chamber 116, which the one face of the diaphragm 115 faces, and the pressure reduction chamber 83, which communicates with the pressure action chamber 116, the partition wall 78 is provided with the through hole 104 coaxial with the valve body 59, the one end of the cylindrical guide member 106 made of a synthetic resin and fitted into the through hole 104 is provided integrally with the flange portion 106a abutting against one of<br><br>
opposite faces of the partition wall 78, the other end of the guide member 106 is integrally provided with the engagement portion 106b capable of flexing so that it can be inserted into the through hole 104 so that the engagement portion 106b resihently engages with the other face of the partition wall 78 m a state in which it projects from the through hole 104, and the valve shaft 105 is slidably fitted into the guide member 106 so as to extend through the guide member 106.<br>
[0095] The valve shaft 105 is therefore guided by the ginde member 106, which is made of a synthetic resin, thus enabling the production of abraded powder accompanying sliding of the valve shaft 105 to be suppressed. Moreover, even if the through hole 104 provided in the partition wall 78 is formed when casting the second body member 19 and has high surface roughness, by fitting the guide member 106 into the through hole 104 the sliding properties of the valve shaft 105 can be enhanced, and it is possible to make it unnecessary to subject the partition wall to secondary macliuiing in order to increase die sniootliness of tlie ilirougli hole 104, thus reducing the cost. Furthermore, when the guide member 106 is fitted into the through hole 104 until the flange portion 106a at one end thereof abuts against one face of the partition wall 78, since the engagement portion 106b at the other end of the guide member 106 resiliently engages with the other face of the partition wall 78, it is easy to assemble the guide member 106 to the partition wall 78 without employing a special tool.<br>
[0096] Furthermore, the relief valve 22 is mounted on the second body member 19 of the body 16, this relief valve 22 including the second body member 19 provided with the housing hole 96 having at its inner end the annular valve seat 95, a central part of which the valve hole 94 communicating with the pressure reduction chamber 83 faces, the guide body 91 fixed to the second body member 19 so as to form between the guide body 91 and the second body member 19 the valve chamber 97 communicating with the exterior, the valve body 92 guided by the guide body 91 so as to move along the axis of the housing hole 96 and housed in the valve chamber 97 so as to be seated on the valve seat 95, and the spring 93 provided in a compressed state between the valve body 92 and the guide body 91 so as to exhibit a predetermined spring force urging the valve body 92 so as to seat it on the valve seat 95; when the guide body 91 is fixed to the second body member 19, the guide body 91 is fixed to the second body member 19 while compressing the spring 93 disposed between the guide body 91 and the valve body 92, and the guide body 91 is integrally provided with the guide tube portion 91a, which is fitted into the housing hole 96 by only the predetermined guide distance L until fixmg of the guide body 91 to the second body member 19 is completed. Moreover, the guide distance L is the sum of the no-load guide section in which the spring force of the spring 93 does not act on the valve seat 95 via the valve body 92 and the loaded guide section in which the spring force of the spring 93 acts on the valve seat 95 via the valve body 92. [0097]    Therefore, when the guide body 91 is fitted into the housing hole 96, after the guide body<br><br>
91	is fitted into the housing hole 96 by only the no-load guide section while the valve body 92 is centered by the guide body 91 in a state in which no load acts between the valve body 92 and the valve seat 95, partway through the guide body 91 being fitted into the housing hole 96 by only the loaded guide section, the spring force of the spring 93 acts on tlie valve seat 95; in a state in which a load acts between the valve body 92 and the valve seat 95, no misalignment occurs between the valve seat 95 and the valve body 92 seated on the valve seat 95, no tilting occurs between the valve body<br>
92	and the valve seat 95, and no galling occurs between the valve body 95 and the guide body 91. [0098] Furthermore, in this embodiment, since the guide distance L by which the guide tube portion 91a is press fitted into the housing hole 96 is larger than the compression distance fi-om the fi-ee length of the spring 93 up to the point at which the predetermined spring force is exhibited, within the guide distance L of the guide body 91, the press fitting distance fi-om the free state of the spring 93 prior to it being compressed is the no-load guide section, and tiltmg or misalignment between the valve seat 95 and the valve body 92 can reliably be prevented.<br>
[0099] Moreover, although the seat portion of either one of the valve body 92 and the valve seat 95, in this embodiment the seat portion 98 of the valve body 92, is made of rubber, since no tilting occurs between the valve body 92 and the valve seat 95, the seat portion 98 will not be broken due to the tiltmg.<br>
[0100] Furthermore, since the guide body 91 is fixed to the second body member 19 by press fitting the guide tube portion 91a into the housing hole 96 by only the guide distance L, the structure for fixing the guide body 91 to the second body member 19 can be simplified, and assembly can be made easy.<br>
[0101] Moreover, since the guide body 91, the valve body 92, and the spring 93 are formed as the guide body assembly 99 in which the valve body 92 can move relative to the guide body 91, when assembluig the guide body 91 onto the first body member 19 by fitting (press fitting) it into the housing hole 96, the distance from the start of guidmg of the guide body 91 to the point at which the valve body 92 is seated on the valve seat 95 can easily be made the no-load guide section, and assembly of the relief valve 22 becomes easier while reliably preventing tilting and misalignment between the valve seat 95 and the valve body 92. Furthermore, since the valve shaft 92a coaxially connected to the valve body 92 is slidably fitted into the guide hole 100 provided in the guide body 91, which is coaxial with the guide tube portion 91a, and the clip 101 capable of abutting against the guide body 91 so as to restrict movement of the valve body 92 due to the spring urging force of the spring 93 engages with the valve shaft 92a projecting from the guide hole 100, the guide body assembly 99 can be formed by a simple structure in which the clip 101, which can abut against the guide body 91, merely engages with the valve shaft.<br><br>
[0102]   Moreover, since the second body member 19 of the body 16 forming part of the relief valve<br>
22 forms part of the pressure reducing valve, the relief valve 22 can be provided compactly on the<br>
pressure reducing valve.<br>

different strengths from each other, in this embodiment the first body member 18', which has a high strength, and the second body member 19', which has a low strength, while vertically stacked by<br>
cutting a drawn aluminum alloy or by cutting details after forging an aluminum alloy, and the second body member 19' being formed by, for example, cutting details after casting an aluminum alloy. [0106] Provided on at least one of the joining faces of the first and second body members 18' and 19', which are mutually joined to form the body 16', in this second embodiment both of the joining faces of the first and second body members 18' and 19' are grooves 133 and 134 for forming between the mutually joined first and second body members 18' and 19' a housing chamber 132 for housing an electric heater (sheath heater) 131, which is heating means. Moreover, the first and second body members 18' and 19' are molded, and the grooves 133 and 13 4 are formed at the same time as molding of the first and second body members 18' and 19'. [0107] Referring in addition to FIG. 13, the housing chamber 132 formed from the grooves 133 and 134 is formed in an arc shape surrounding a valve body 59 and a valve seat 58 when viewed in a direction along the axis of the valve body 59 in a valve mechanism 20 and is disposed at substantially the same position as the valve seat 58 in a direction along the axis of the valve body 59, and connection terminals 135 and 136 connected to opposite ends of the electric heater 131 housed in the housing chamber 132 extend sideways from the body 16'. [0108] In accordance with this second embodiment, the body 16' can freely be heated by the electric heater 131; moreover, it is possible to heat effectively tlie surroundings of the valve seat 58<br><br>
and the valve body 59, whose temperatures easily decrease during the pressure reduction action accompanying operation of the valve mechanism 20 and, moreover, due to the housing chamber 132 having an arc shape the surroundings of the valve seat 58 and the valve body 59 can be substantially evenly heated.<br>
[0109] Furthermore, since the grooves 133 and 134 forming the housing chamber 132 are formed at the same time as molding of the first and second body members 18' and 19', it is unnecessary to carry out machining for forming the grooves 133 and 134, thus reducing the cost.
