INTERMEDIATES FOR THE PRODUCTION OF A BENZOFURAN OR BENZOTHIOPHENE TYPE DERIVATIVE NITRATED IN THE 5 POSITION, AND<br>
USE THEREOF<br>
The present invention relates to novel nitroaromatic compounds and to a process for their preparation.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of these compounds in preparing heterocyclic benzofUran or benzothiophene type derivatives nitrated in the 5-position.<br>
More particularly, the invention relates to the preparation of a 2-alkyl-5-nitrobenzofuran.<br>
BenzofUran or benzothiophene type structures are encountered in many molecules used in the pharmaceutical field. In particular, European patent EP-A-O 471 609 describes a process for preparing n-butyl-2-nitro-5-benzofxiran, which consists of reacting 2-hydroxy-5-nitro-benzyltriphenylphosphonium bromide with pentanoyl chloride in the presence of pyridine: 2-hydroxy-5-nitro-benzyltriphenylphosphonium bromide is obtained from 2-hydroxy-5-nitro-benzyl bromide and triphenylphosphine.<br>
A completely different synthesis route involving different intermediates has now been discovered.<br>
The present invention provides novel nitroaromatic compounds with general formula:<br>
in which: <br><br>
•	K 1 represents a imear or branched alkyl group containing 1 to 12 carbon atoms, a phenyl group that may be substituted by an alkyl group containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or a halogenophenyl group;<br>
•	R2 represents a hydrogen atom, a hydrocarbon group containing 1 to 12 carbon atoms, which may be a linear or branched alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group, a phenyl group or a phenylilkyl group;<br>
•	Z represents an oxygen or sulphur atom;<br>
•	R represents a hydrogen atom or a substituent;<br>
•	n is a number equal to 0. 1, 2 or 3, preferably 0;<br>
•	when n is greater than 1, two groups R and the successive 2 atoms of the benzene ring can together form a saturated, unsaturated or aromatic cycle containing 5 to 7 carbon atoms;<br>
In formula (F), the benzene ring can carry a substituent. The scope of the invention does not exclude the presence on the benzene ring of any type of substituent, provided that it does not react under the conditions of the invention. More particular examples of group R that can be mentioned include:<br>
•	a hydroxyl group;<br>
•	a linear or branched alkyl group containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl;<br>
•	an alkoxy group containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms;<br>
•	an ester group containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms;<br>
•	an alkylamide group containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms;<br>
•	a carboxamide group;<br>
•	a halogen atom;<br>
•	a trifluoromethyl group.<br>
Preferred compounds of the invention have formula (F) in which R represents a hydrogen atom, a methyl or ethyl group, or a methoxy or ethoxy group.<br><br>
When n is greater than 1, two groups R and the successive 2 atoms of the benzene ring can together form a saturated, unsaturated or aromatic cycle containing 5 to 7 carbon atoms, preferably 6 carbon atoms. Advantageously, two groups R form a benzene ring.<br>
Group R'l is advantageously an alkyl group containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms.<br>
The invention does not exclude the fact that R2 represents a further group such as cycloalkyl, phenyl or arylalkyl, but since group R2 is eliminated, it is important from an economic viewpoint that it should be as simple as possible, for example a lower alkyl group, i.e., containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms. R2 can also represent a hydrogen atom, which corresponds to the presence of a carboxylic group.<br>
In formula (V), Z preferably represents an oxygen atom.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention provides a process for preparing nitroaromatic compounds with formula (I):<br><br>
in which:<br>
•	Ri represents a hydrogen atom, a linear or branched alkyl group containing 1 to 12 carbon atoms, a phenyl group that may be substituted by an alkyl group containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or a halogenophenyl group;<br>
•	R2 represents a hydrogen atom, a hydrocarbon group containing 1 to 12 carbon atoms, which may be a linear or branched alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group, a phenyl group or a phenylalkyl group;<br>
•	Z represents an oxygen or sulphur atom;<br><br>
•	R represents a hydrogen atom or a substituent;<br>
•	n is a number equal to 0. 1, 2 or 3, preferably 0;<br>
•	when n is greater than 1, two groups R and the successive 2 atoms of the benzene ring can together form a saturated, unsaturated or aromatic cycle containing 5 to 7 carbon atoms;<br>
characterized in that it consists of carrying out selective nitration in the 4 position, using a source of N02+ and in the presence of sulphuric acid, of an aromatic compound with formula (11): <br>
in which formula (11), R, R1, R2, Z and n have the meanings given above.<br>
The invention also encompasses nitration of a compound with formula (II) in its acid<br>
form or in its ester form, i.e., a compound with formula (II) in which R2 is either a hydrogen<br>
atom or a hydrocarbon group.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention provides a process for preparing a compound with<br>
formula (II), consisting of reacting:<br>
•	a compound of the 2-hydroxy' or 2-thiobenzaldehyde type with formula (III):<br><br>
in which formula (HI), R, 2 and n have the meanings given above;<br>
•	and a carboxylic acid or a derivative with formula (IV) comprising a leaving group:<br><br>
in which formula (IV): <br>
•	Y represents a leaving group, preferably a halogen atom or a sulphonic ester group with formula -OSO2R whereR is a hydrocarbon group;<br>
•	Ri, R2 have the meanings given above.<br>
In the formula for the sulphonic ester group, R is a hydrocarbon group of any nature. However, given that Y is a leaving group, it is important from an economic viewpoint that R should be simple in nature, and more particularly represents a linear or branched alkyl group containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, preferably a methyl or ethyl group; however, it can also represent a phenyl or tolyl group or a trifluoromethyl group, for example. Preferably, group Y is a triflate group, corresponding to a group ^ representing a trifluoromethyl group.<br>
Preferred leaving groups that can be selected are halogen atoms, namely bromine, chlorine or iodine, preferably a bromine or chlorine atom.<br>
The invention also encompasses the use of a compound with formula (I) for the preparation of a heterocyclic compound with general formula (V):<br><br>
in which formula (V), R, Ri, Z and n have the meanings given above, optionally by saponification when R2 is an ester function, followed by cyclising.<br>
In accordance with the process of the invention, novel intermediates with formula (V) are prepared.<br>
They are obtained by a selective nitration reaction in the 4 position of compounds with formula (II) in which R\ is a linear or branched alkyl group containing 1 to 12 carbon atoms, a<br><br>
phenyl group that may be substituted by an alkyl group containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or a halogenophenyl group.<br>
It has been discovered that it is only possible to carry out selective nitration in a position para to the O or S atom if the starting substrate is an 0- or S-alkylated phenolic or thiophenolic substrate.<br>
It has been discovered that nitration is not selective if the starting substrate is a phenolic substrate containing free OH or SH groups.<br>
It has also been discovered that nitration is only carried out under good conditions if the N02^ source is combined with sulphuric acid.<br>
The selective nitration process of the invention is applicable both to preparing novel compounds with formula (I') in which R'l represents a linear or branched alkyl group containing 1 to 12 carbon atoms; a phenyl group that may be substituted by an alkyl group containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a halogenophenyl group, and to compounds with formula (I) in which Ri has the same meaning as R't but also includes representing a hydrogen atom.<br>
Compounds with formula (I) or (F) can be obtained by nitration of an O- or S-alkylated compound with formula (II), by reacting the latter with a source of N02^: preferably, the reaction may or may not be carried out in an organic solvent.<br>
To this end, said compound is reacted with a source of N02^.<br>
It is possible to start with nitrogen dioxide NO2, nitrous anhydride N2O3, dinitrogen tetroxide N2O4, or nifric oxide NO associated with an oxidising agent such as nitric acid, nitrogen dioxide or oxygen. When the reactant is gaseous under the reaction conditions, it is bubbled into the medium.<br>
It is also possible to use nitrous acid, a nitrose or nitrosyl sulphate or a nitrous salt, preferably an alkali metal salt, still more preferably sodium associated with an oxidising agent, preferably nitric acid.<br><br>
It is also possible to use alkyl nitrites associated with an oxidising agent, more particularly those with formula (VII):<br>
Ra'ONO	(VII)<br>
in which formula (VII), Ra represents a linear or branched alkyl group containing 1 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms.<br>
The quantity of NO2'* source is at least equal to the stoichiometric quantity of the O- or S-alkylated aromatic compound. The ratio between the number of moles of N02'^ source and the number of moles of aromatic O- or S-alkylated compound is advantageously in the range 1.0 to 1.2.<br>
Preferably, a concentrated nitric acid solution is used with a preferred concentration in the range 70% to 99%.<br>
As mentioned above, the NOa^ source is associated with sulphuric acid.<br>
In a variation, the process of the invention consists of using a nitrating mixture (mixture of nitric acid and sulphuric acid comprising 50% to 98% by weight of nitric acid).<br>
The quantity of nitric acid, expressed as the mole ratio of the 0-or S-alkylated aromatic compound/nitric acid, is generally in the range 0.9 to 1.1, preferably in the range 0.95 to 1.05.<br>
The quantity of sulphuric acid, expressed as the mole ratio of the O- or S-alkylated aromatic compound/sulphuric acid, is generally in the range 0.9 to 1.1, preferably in the range 0.95 to 1.05.<br>
The concentration of sulphuric acid is advantageously in the range 50% to 98%.<br>
To this end, nitric acid or a precursor of nitric acid is used, such as dinitrogen tetroxide.<br>
The nitration reaction can optionally be carried out in an organic solvent that is inert under the reaction conditions.<br>
More particular examples of organic solvents that can be cited are aliphatic halogenated hydrocarbons,  more  particularly perchlorinated  hydrocarbons  such  as   tetrachloromethane,<br><br>
hexachloroethane; partially chlorinated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, and 1,2-dichloromethane.<br>
Dichloromethane is the preferred solvent.<br>
Regarding the concentration of the O- or S-alkylated aromatic compound in the reaction medium, it is preferably in the range 0.2 to 3 mole/1, more preferably in the range 0.3 to 1.5 mole/1.<br>
This is generally introduced in the liquid form.<br>
The reaction is advantageously carried out at a temperature in the range -lO^^C to 20°C, preferably in the range -5°C to 10°C, and in an inert gas atmosphere.<br>
The process of the invention is generally carried out at atmospheric pressure.<br>
In a preferred variation of the process of the invention, the nitration step is carried out in a controlled inert gas atmosphere. A rare gas atmosphere can be established, preferably argon, but it is cheaper to use nitrogen.<br>
A number of implementations can be envisaged.<br>
In a first variation, the sulphuric acid solution is charged first, followed by the 0- or S-alkylated aromatic compound and the nitric acid at the same time.<br>
In a fiirther variation, the sulphuric acid and nitric acid solufion is introduced then the 0-or S-alkylated aromatic compound is added, preferably in portions, or it is poured in continuously.<br>
In a still fiarthef variation, the 0- or S-alkylated aromatic compound is introduced into a base stock on the one hand and the sulphuric and nitric acid on the other hand.<br>
The reaction advantageously lasts 3 to 10 hours.<br>
At the end of the reacfion, the desired product with formula (I) is obtained.<br>
The product is recovered using conventional techniques employed in the field.<br>
In particular, water hydrolysis can be carried out, preferably using ice employed in an amount of 100% to 150% by weight of the compound with formula (I) or (F), for example.<br><br>
A solid is obtained that is separated using conventional solid/liquid separation techniques, preferably by filtering.<br>
The desired product is then produced.<br>
In accordance with the process of the invention, the starting compound is a compound with formula (II) which can in particular can be obtained using an O- or S-alkylation reaction of a compound of the 2-hydroxy or 2-thiobenzaldehyde type with formula (III) with a carboxylic acid or a derivative with formula (IV).<br>
One implementation consists of reacting an aromatic compound with formula (III) with a carboxylic acid or a derivative with formula (IV): the reaction is carried out in the presence of a base, preferably in an organic solvent.<br>
A further variation of the process of the invention consists of carrying out the O- or S-alkylation reaction in an aqueous medium in the presence of a base and a phase transfer catalyst.<br>
Of the compounds with formula (III), salicylic aldehyde is preferred.<br>
Regarding the carboxylic acid or derivative with formula (IV), esters of a-halogenocarboxylic acids are preferably used, more preferably methyl or ethyl 2-bromohexanoate.<br>
The mole ratio between the compound with formula (III) and the compound with formula (IV) is advantageously between 1 and 1.2.<br>
In accordance with the process of the invention, the 2-hydroxy or 2-thiobenzaldehyde type compound with formula (III) is reacted in its salt form with the carboxylic acid or derivative with formula (IV), in an organic solvent.<br>
A salt form of a 2-hydroxy or 2-thiobenzaldehyde type compound that has been extemporaneously prepared can be used, but it is also possible to prepare it in situ by reacting the compound of the 2-hydroxy or 2-thiobenzaldehyde type compound and the base.<br>
Thus a base, which can be mineral or organic, is used in the process of the invention.<br><br>
Particularly suitable bases for use in carrying out tk4:pT0cess of the invention are mineral bases such as alkali metal or alkaline-earth metal salts, preferably an alkali or alkaline-earth metal hydroxide, which may be sodium, potassium or calcium hydroxide; or an alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonate, preferably sodium carbonate.<br>
It is also possible to use an organic base such as a quaternary ammonium hydroxide or an amine.<br>
Preferred examples of quaternary ammonium hydroxides that can be used are tetraalkylammonium or trialkylbenzylammonium hydroxides in which the alkyl groups, which may be identical or different, represent a linear or branched alkyl chain containing 1 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>
Preferably, tetramethylammonium hydroxide, tetraethylammonium hydroxide or tetrabutylammonium hydroxide is used.<br>
It is also possible to use trialkylbenzylammonium hydroxides, in particular trimethylbenzylammonium hydroxide.<br>
Examples of amines that can be mentioned include tertiary amines.<br>
Suitable bases that can be cited are tertiary amines, more particularly those with general formula (VIII);<br>
N-(R3)3	(VIII)<br>
in which:<br>
•	groups RB," which may be identical or different, represent hydrocarbon residues containing 1 to 20 carbon atoms, such as alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or heterocyclic groups;<br>
•	2 groups R3 together with the nitrogen atom form a heterocycle containing 4 to 6 atoms.<br>
More particularly:<br><br>
•	symbols R3 represent an alkyl group containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to<br>
4 carbon atoms, or a cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl group or pyridiny! group;<br>
•	2 groups R3 together form a piperidine or pyrrolidine cycle with the nitrogen atom.<br>
Examples of such amines that can be cited are triethylamine, tri-n-propylamine, tri-n-<br>
butylamine, methyldibutylamine, methyldicyclohexylamine, ethyldiisopropylamine, N,N-diethylcyclohexylamine, dimethylamino-4-pyridine, N-methylpiperidine, N-ethylpiperidine, N-n-butylpiperidine, 1,2-dimethylpiperidine, N-methylpyrrolidine, and 1,2-dimethylpyrrolidine.<br>
For reasons of economy, sodium or potassium carbonate are preferred.<br>
While the base is used in its solid form, it is also possible to use the base in solution. The concentration of the starting base solution is not critical. The alkali metal hydroxide solution is employed in a concentration that is generally in the range 10% to 50% by weight.<br>
The quantity of base introduced into the reaction medium takes into account the quantity necessary to change the hydroxyl or thiol function of the 2-hydroxy or 2-thiobenzaldehyde type compound into the salt form.<br>
The hydroxyl or thiol group of the starting substrate with formula (III) can be transformed into its salt form in an initial step. Thus, the compound with formula (III) can be transformed into its salt form either by introducing the base then causing it to react at a temperature that is advantageously in the range 0°C to 100*^C, preferably in the range 25°C to 50°C, or by introducing the base at the same time as the compound with formula (IV).<br>
Generally, the" quantity of base, expressed with respect to the 2-hydroxy or 2-thiobenzaldehyde type compound, is in the range 90% to 120% of the stoichiometric quantity.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the O- or S-alkylation reaction is advantageously carried out in the liquid phase comprising the compound with formula (III) and the compound with formula (IV), in the presence of a base.<br>
One of the starting reactants can act as the reaction solvent, but it is also possible to use an organic solvent.<br><br>
An organic solvent is selected that is less activated than the starting substrate and which preferably dissolves it.<br>
Examples of solvents that are suitable for use in the present invention that can be cited are aromatic hydrocarbons, which may or may not be halogenated, and aliphatic, cycloaHphatic or aromatic ether-oxides.<br>
Examples of aliphatic hydrocarbons that can be cited are aromatic hydrocarbons, more particularly aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylenes, cumene, and petroleum cuts constituted by a mixture of alkylbenzenes, in particular Solvesso type cuts.<br>
Regarding aliphatic or aromatic halogenated hydrocarbons, particular mention can be made of dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane and mono- or dichlorobenzene.<br>
The organic solvent can also be an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic ether-oxide, more particularly dipropyl oxide, diisopropyl oxide, dibutyl oxide, methyltertiobutylether, ethylene glycol dimethylether (or glyme), diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (diglyme); phenyl oxide; dioxane, and tetrahydrofuran (THE).<br>
Examples of more polar aprotic organic solvents that can also be used in the process of the invention that can be cited are aliphatic or aromatic nitriles such as acetonitrile, propionitrile, benzonitrile; linear or cyclic carboxamides such as N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAC), dimethylformamide (DMF), diethylformamide or l-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP).<br>
Preferred solvents are DMAC or DMF.<br>
It is also possible to use a mixture of solvents.<br>
Regarding the concentration of the 2-hydroxy or 2-thiobenzaldehyde type compound in the reaction medium, it is preferably in the range 2% to 50% by weight.<br>
In a variation of the process of the invention, iodide ions are added to accelerate the reaction. Alkali metal iodides can in particular be used, preferably potassium iodide or tetraalkylammonium iodides, preferably tetrabutylammonium iodide.<br><br>
The quantity of iodide used, expressed as the ratio between the number of moles of iodine salt and the number of moles of compound with formula (III), can be in the range 0.05 to 0,2.<br>
The temperature for reacting the aromatic compound with formula (III) with a carboxylic acid or derivative with formula (IV) is advantageously in the range 0°C to 100°C, preferably in the range 25°C to 50°C.<br>
The reaction generally takes place at atmospheric pressure.<br>
In a preferred variation of the process of the invention, the process of the invention is carried out in a controlled atmosphere of inert gases. A rare gas atmosphere can be established, preferably with argon, but it is cheaper to use nitrogen.<br>
From a practical viewpoint, the process is simple to carry out.<br>
One implementation of the invention consists of charging all of the reactants, the base, the organic solvent and optionally the iodide ions.<br>
The medium is then heated to the selected reaction temperature.<br>
As mentioned above, salt formation can be carried out in a previous step and the compound with formula (III), the base and the organic solvent can be introduced, the medium is heated to the selected temperature then the compound with formula (IV) is added along with the optional iodide ions, then heated.<br>
The desired product with formula (II) is obtained.<br>
The product obtained is recovered conventionally.<br>
As an example, the salts formed during the reaction can be eliminated by adding water and extracting the product in the organic phase, in a suitable solvent, for example isopropyl ether.<br>
The organic solvent can be eliminated conventionally by evaporation.<br><br>
In a variation of the process of the invention, the 2-hydroxy - or 2-thiobenzaldehyde type compound with formula (III) is reacted with a carboxylic acid or derivative with formula (IV) in an aqueous medium in the presence of a base and a phase transfer catalyst.<br>
The expression "phase transfer catalyst" means a catalyst that can pass the anion from the aqueous phase to the organic phase.<br>
Known phase transfer catalysts can be used in the process of the invention, in particular those described by Jerry MARCH in "Advanced Organic Chemistry", third edition, John Wiley &amp;Sons, 19S5,p.320ff<br>
A first category of phase transfer catalysts that is suitable for use in the invention includes those of the tris(ether-amine) type which have been described in the literature, in particular in French patent FR-A-2 455 570.<br>
They have the following formula:<br>
N-[-A-0-(-B-0-)n-Rb]3	(VIII)<br>
In which formula, Rb represents an alkyl group containing 1 to 24 carbon atoms, a cyclohexyl group, a phenyl group, an alkylphenyl group the alkyl portion of which contains 1 to 12 carbon atoms, A and B, which may be identical or different, represent a linear alkanediyl group containing 2 or 3 carbon atoms, said atoms possibly being substituted by a methyl or ethyl group.<br>
A specific example of catalysts with formula (VIII) that can in particular be mentioned is tris(3,3-dioxaheptyl)araine (TDA-1).<br>
Catalysts that are preferably employed in the process of the invention are onium salts, more particular quaternary ammonium and/or phosphonium salts.<br>
Onium salts that can be used in the process of the invention are those the onium ions of which derive in particular from nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, sulphur, selenium, oxygen, carbon or iodine and co-ordinated with hydrocarbon residues. Onium ions deriving from nitrogen, phosphorus or arsenic will be four-co-ordinate; onium ions deriving from sulphur, selenium,<br><br>
oxygen or carbon will be three-coordinated; while onium ions deriving from iodine will be two-coordinated.<br>
The hydrocarbon residues co-ordinated to these different elements are alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, cycloalkyl, optionally substituted aralkyl groups, and two co-ordinated hydrocarbon residues can together form a single divalent group.<br>
The nature of the anions bonded to these organic cations is not important. Any "hard" or 'borderline" base will be suitable as the anion.<br>
The terms 'hard" or '*borderHne" base means any anion satisfying the conventional definition given by R, PEARSON in the Journal of Chem. Ed. 45, pages 581-587 (1968).<br>
Particularly suitable onium ions that can be used in the process of the invention are those with the following general formulae:<br><br>
in which formulae:<br>
•	Z represents N, P or As;<br>
•	Y represents S, O, Se or C;<br>
•	Xi, X2, X3 and X4, which may be identical or different, represent:<br><br>
•	a linear or branched alkyl group containing 1 to 16 carbon atoms, optionally substituted by one or more phenyl, hydroxyl, halogen, nitro, alkoxy or alkoxycarbonyl groups, the alkoxy groups containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms;<br>
•	a linear or branched alkenyl group containing 2 to 12 carbon atoms;<br><br>
•    an aryl group containing 6 to 10 carbon atoms, optionally substituted by one or<br>
more alky! groups containing 1  to 4 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group, or an<br>
alkoxycarbonyl group, the alkoxy group containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or a<br>
