				<td>Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an optical pickup, and more particularly, to an optical pickup adopting a multi-coated polarization holographic optical element (ROR)<br>
Generally, an optical pickup is for recording and/or reproducing information such as picture, sound and data on an optical recording medium in a noncontact manner.<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic perspective view of a conventional optical pickup adopting a general HOE. The optical pickup includes a light source 20, a HOE 50 for changing a traveling path of incident light, a phase delay plate 60 for changing a polarization direction of the incident light, an objective lens 70 for converging the light entered from the light source 20 on a recording surface of a recording medium 10, and a photodetector 8 0 for detecting an information signal and an error signal<br>
The objective lens 70 is driven by an actuator (not shown) to correct tracking and focusing errors based on the error signal detected from the photodetector 80.<br>
The HOE 5 0 is arranged at a position along an optical path between the objective lens 70 and the light source 20, which is formed by etching a substrate to form its hologram pattern to provide different diffraction characteristics in accordance with the polarization direction of the incident light Generally, the phase delay plate 60 includes a ? /4<br>
1A<br><br>
wareform plate for changing a linearly polarized light incident from the light source 2 0 into a circularly polarized light and changing the circularly polarized light reflected from the recording medium into the linearly polarized light. A reflecting mirror for changing a traveling path of the light emitted from the light source 20 is arranged at an angle between the light source 20 and the HOE 50 under the consideration of the optical arrangement of the optical pickup. Also, a collimating lens 30 for collimating a divergent light emitted from the light source 2 0 may be further comprised on the optical path between the light source 20 and the reflecting mirror 40<br>
As described above, the optical pickup adopting the HOE 5 0 has a simpler optical structure than an optical pickup adopting a beam splitter.<br>
As shown in FIG 2, the conventional HOE 50 adopted in the above optical pickup uses a substrate 51 made of LiNb3 having a high refractive index, wherein a plurality of grooves 52 are formed by an etching process. The light incident on the HOE is transmitted in a region having the grooves 52 without a phase delay. Meanwhile, the phase of P-polarized light component or S-polarized light component is reversed by 18 0° in a region without the grooves 5 2 Accordingly, a polarized light component passed through the HOE, such as a light 54 of a P-polarized light component, is transmitted directly while the other polarized light component such as a light 55 of an S-polarized light component is diffractively transmitted The HOE 50 can transmit the light directly or<br>
2<br><br>
diffractively according to the polarized light component of the incident light, however, the material of the substrate used therefor, i.e., LiNb3, is expensive. Thus, manufacturing costs of the conventional optical pickup adopting the HOE are high<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In order to overcome the above defect, it is an object of the present invention to provide an optical pickup adopting a holographic optical element (HOE) formed by stacking multiple thin layers.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide an. optical pickup adopting a reflective type HOE formed by stacking multiple thin layers.<br>
Accordingly , the present invention provides an optical pickup having a light source, an objective lens for converging<br>
light emitted from the light source on a recording medium, a holographic optical element. (HOE) arranged along an optical path between the light source and the objective lens, for changing traveling of the incident light, a phase delay plate arranged between the HOE and the recording medium, for changing a polarization direction of the incident light, and a photodetector for receiving the light reflected by the recording medium, wherein the HOE comprises a polarization beam splitter for transmitting one polarized light component of the incident light and reflecting the other polarized light component thereof, and a reflection member having a hologram pattern for diffracting the light passed through the<br>
3<br><br>
polarization beam splitter, for reflecting the incident light, and wherein the HOE is arranged at an angle between the light source and the phase delay plate<br>

Detailed description of the Invention<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, an optical pickup according, to a preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a light source 120, a holographic optical element (HOE) ,150, a phase delay plate 160, an objective lens 170 and a photodetector 18 0 Here, the light source 12 0, the objective lens 170 and<br>
5<br><br>
the photodetector 180 are the same as the light source 20, the objective lens 70 and the photodetector 80 described in FIG 1, thus the description thereof will be omitted. Also, preferably, a collimating lens 130 for collimating a divergent light emitted from the light source 120 is further provided along the optical path between the light source 120 and the HOE 150.<br>
The HOE 150 is arranged at an angle along the optical path between the collimating lens 13 0 and the objective lens 170. The HOE 150 as a reflective type reflects the light from the light source 120 toward a recording medium 10 and the light back from the recording medium 10 toward the photodetector 180 which is near the light source 120<br>
According to an example of the HOE 150, the HOE shown in FIG. 4 includes a polarization beam splitter 151 for transmitting a polarized light component such as the P-polarized light component and reflecting the other polarized light component such as the S-polarized light component and a reflection member 152 having a hologram pattern 152a for diffracting the light passed through the polarization beam splitter 151, which is for completely reflecting the incident light. Also, a transparent member 153 for generating difference in optical axes of respective beams which are reflected from and transmitted through the polarization beam splitter 151 is further included between the polarization beam splitter 151 and the reflection member 152 The polarization beam splitter 151 has a structure in which a plurality of thin layers are stacked to transmit one polarized light component<br>
6<br><br>
Only the S-polanzed light component among the P- and S-polarized light components incident on the HOE 15 0 is completely reflected by the polarization beam splitter 151 and only the P-polarized light component is transmitted through the polarization beam splitter 151. The light passed through the polarization beam splitter 151 is completely reflected by the reflection member 152 and back to the polarization beam splitter 151 to be transmitted Of course, the polarization beam splitter 151 can completely reflect the P-polarized light component and transmit the S-polarized light component Thus, while the P- and S-polarized light components which are incident with the same phase are reflected by the HOE 150, the phases thereof are changed into phases that are different from each other. That is, the light is divided into a light reflected by the polarization beam splitter 151 and a 1lght reflected by the reflection member 152, and the light reflected by the reflection member 152 is diffractively reflected by the hologram pattern 152a As described previously, the reflective type HOE 150 is arranged at an angle, so that the light entering back into the HOE 150 after being reflected by the recording medium 10, which entered into the recording medium 10 after being emitted from the light source 120, is diffractively reflected Accordingly, the photodetector 180 receives an information signal, a focusing error signal and a tracking error signal With respect to the recording medium 10 through the above diffraction<br>
Another example of the HOE 150 will be described now with reference to FIG 5. As shown in FIG 5, the HOE 150 includes<br>
7<br><br>
a transparent substrate 154, multiple thin layers 155 stacked on parts of the transparent substrate 154, and a reflection layer 158 coated over the transparent substrate 154 and the multiple thin layers 155 The reflection layer 159 is formed by a metal coating or a reflection coating<br>
The transparent substrate 154 directly transmits incident light. Thus, the P- and S-polarized light components toward the transparent substrate 154 are transmitted without a phase delay. The multiple thin layers 155 are formed by alternately stacking a first thin layer 156 having a reflective index of n1 and a second thin layer 157 having a reflective index of nl1. The multiple thin layers 155 are obtained by forming a multi-layered structure by alternately coating the first and second thin layers 156 and 157 on the transparent substrate 154 and then partially etching the multi-layered structure The reflective index n1 of the first thin layer 156 and the Reflective index nh of the second thin layer 157 are different from each other<br>
As described above, the multiple thin layers 155 completely transmits the incident light and delays the phase of the S- or P-polarized light component by 180° In order to completely transmit the incident light the optical depth (A) of a pair of first and second thin layers 156 and 157 which are alternately stacked to form the multiple thin layers 155 should not be a multiple of ? /4 in which A is wavelength of the light emitted from the light source 120<br>
The reflection layer 3 58 is formed on the transparent substrate 154 and the surface of the multiple thin layers 155<br>
8<br><br>
by a total reflection coating, thereby completely reflecting the incident light.<br>
Here, the multiple thin layers 155 delay the P- or S-polarized light component of the incident light by 90° Thus, the phase of P- or S-polarized light component reflected by the reflection layer 158 after being incident on the multiple thin layers 155 is delayed by 180° with respect to the incident light. Thus, the HOE 150 shown in FIG. 5 performs the same function as the HOE shown in FIG 4.<br>
The phase delay plate 160 arranged along the optical path between the HOE 150 and the objective lens 170 delays the phase of the light to change a linearly polarized light into a circularly polarized light and a circularly polarized light into a linearly polarized light For this end, the phase delay plate 160 is formed by alternately stacking a first coating layer 161 and a second coating layer 162 which have different reflective indices The phase delay plate 160 can control the phase difference by controlling the number of respective stacked layers of two coating layers 161 and 16 2. Here, preferably, the phase delay plate 160 delays the incident light by as much as 1/4 the wavelength of the light emitted from the light source 120, that is, by 90°<br>
An optical pickup according to another prefoned embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to FJG 7 As shown in FIG 7, the optical pickup includes a light source 220, a HOE 250, a phase delay plate 260, an objective lens 270, and a photodetector 280 next to the light source 220 The light source 220, the objective<br>
9<br><br>
lens 270 and the photodetector 280 are the same as the light source 20, the objective lens 70 and the photodetector 80 described with reference to FIG 1, thus a detailed description thereof will be omitted. Also, preferably, a collimating lens 230 for collimating the divergent light emitted from the light source 220 is further included along the optical path between the light source 220 and the HOE 250<br>
As shown in FIG. 8, the HOE 250 includes a transparent substrate 251 and multiple thin layers 2 55 formed on portions of the transparent substrate 251 by a multi-coating. The transparent substrate 251 directly transmits incident light Thus, the P- and S-polarized light components toward the transparent substrate 2 51 are transmitted without a phase delay. The multiple thin layers 255 have a multi-layered structure which is formed by alternately stacking a first thin layer 256 having a reflective index of n1 and a second thin layer 256 having a reflective index of nh on the transparent substrate 251 and then partially etching the stacked layer The reflective index n1 of the first thin layer 256 and the reflective index nh of the second thin layer 257 are different from each other. The multiple thin layers 255 having the multi-layered structure completely transmits the incident light and delays the phases of the S- and P-polanzed light components of the incident light by 180°<br>
Here, the HOE 250 for reversing the phase of the S-polarized light: component is defined as an S-type HOC while the HOE 250 for reversing the phase of the P-polarized light component is defined as a P-type HOE When adopting the S-<br>
10<br><br>
type HOE, the multiple thin layers 255 directly transmit the P-polarized light component without a phase delay and reversely transmits the S-polanzed light component by 180°. Thus, compared with a light incident on a portion of the transparent substrate 251 where the multiple thin layers 255 are not formed, the HOE functions with respect to the S-polarized light component On the contrary, when adopting the P-type HOE, the multiple thin layers 255 directly transmit the S-polarized light component without a phase delay and reversely transmits the P-polarized light component by 180°. Thus, compared with a light incident on the portion of the transparent substrate 251 where the multiple thin layers 255 are not formed, the HOE functions with respect to the P-polarized light component.<br>
The phase delay plate 260 is arranged at an angle at a position along the optical path between the HOE 2 50 and the objective lens 270 and changes an incident circularly polarized light into a linearly polarized light and an incident linearly polarized light into a circularly polarized light. As shown in FIG 9, the phase delay plate 260 includes<br>
r	<br>
multiple coating layers 263 having a first coating layer 261 and a second coating layer 262 which are alternately stacked with different reflective indices, and a reflection inner 264 coated on one side of the multiple coating layers 263 In the phase delay plate 260 having the above structure, the light is completely reflected by the reflection layer 264, so that a phase difference exists between the incident light and the light passed through the multiple coating layers 263 by 45°<br>
11<br><br>
Here, one polarized light component incident from the light source 220 is reflected by the multiple coating layers 263, and the other polarized light component is transmitted through the multiple coating layers 2 63 and then reflected by the reflection layer 264. For example, the S-pclarized light component among the P- and S-polarized light components having the same phase is reflected by the multiple coating layers 263, and the P-polarized light component is transmitted through the multiple coating layers 263 and then completely reflected by the reflection layer 264. Thus, the phases of the P- and S-polarized light components reflected by the phase delay plate 260 become different from each other. Here, a phase delay of 90° exists between the P- and S-polarized light components in order to change an incident linearly polarized light component: into a circularly polarized light component and an incident circularly polarized light component into a linearly polarized light component<br>
An optical pickup according to still another preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to FTG 10 As shown in FIG. 10, the optical pickup includes a light source 320, a reflecting mirror 34 0, an HOE 350, a phase delay plate 360, an objective lens 370 and a photodetector 380 arranged next to the light source 3?0 The light source 320 and the reflecting mirror 34 0, the objective lens 3 70 and the photodetector 380 are the same as the light source 20, the reflecting mirror 40 and the objective lens 70 and the photodetector 8 0 described with reference to FIG 1, thus a detailed description thereof will be omitted<br>
12<br><br>
Preferably, a col1imating lens 330 for colliating the divergent light emitted from the light source 320 is arranged at a position along the optical path between the light source 320 and the HOE 350.<br>
As shown in FIG 8, the HOE 350 includes a transparent substrate 251 and multiple thin layers 255 formed on part of the transparent substrate 251 by a multiple coating The HOE 350 diffractively transmits the light incident from the recording medium 10 The phase delay plate 360 is formed by alternately stacking a first coating layer 161 and a second coating layer 3 62 each having different reflective indices as shown in FIG 6, which can control the phase difference by controlling the number of respective stacked layers of two coating layers 161 and 162 The phase delay place 360 transmits the incident light by delaying the light emitted from the light source 120, by as much as 1/4 the wavelength of the light, that is, 90°.<br>
As described above, the optical pickup according to the present invention adopts a low-priced HOE and phase delay plate which have a multi-layered structure instead of a high-priced substrate made of LiNb,, thereby reducing the manufacturing cost Also, the function of a reflecting mirror located along the optical path between the light source and the HOE can be replaced by the reflective type HOE or the phase delay plate, thereby providing a small optical pickup having a simple optical structure<br>
