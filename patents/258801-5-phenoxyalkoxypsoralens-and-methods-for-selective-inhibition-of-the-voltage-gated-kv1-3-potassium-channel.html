5-PHENCXYA_K0XYPSORA’ENS AND methods FOR Selective [N’HIBITION OF THE VOLTAGE GATED Kv1.3<br>
POTASSIUM CHANNEL<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a) novel compositions of matter comprising or consisting of 5-phenoxyaikoxypsoralens, b) methods for treating and/or preventing diseases or disorders in human or animal subjects, c) methods and kits for in vivo and/or in vitro inhibition of the selected types of potassium channels and d) the use of 5-phenoxyalkoxypsoralen compositions in the manufacture of pharmaceutical preparations for the treatment and/or prevention of diseases of disorders in human or animal subjects.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
  and Their Functions:<br>
T cells are lymphocytes that have receptors capable of recognizing protein fragments (antigens) derived from foreign, potentially harmful proteins or organisms such as bacteria and viruses or from proteins present in the body of the host. Each T Celt receptor recognizes a different string of amino acids, which comprise the antigen. Essentially there will always be at least one T cell receptor in the total repertoire of T cells, which vl recognize any given antigen, which is in the body.<br>
There are two main types of T cells, namely CD4+ helper T cells and CD8+ killer T cells. Helper T Cells (Th) carry receptors that engage antigens present on the surfaces of an antigen-presenting ceil (APC) such as dendritic cells and sometimes macrophages. It is only by engagement with an antigen present on an APC and a subsequent process known as co-stimulation that a Th Celt can become activated so that it may attack that specific antigen.  Before the<br><br>
  destroyed, most of the effector T ceils die. However, some effector T cells remain in a resting or quiescent state and are then known as "memory T ceils/ At least two types of Memory T cells exist, each having different migratory characteristics and effector functions. The first type of memory T cells are known as "effector memory T cells" (I’M) and produce IFN-y, TNF-a and IL-2 or pre-stored person (in the case of CD8s) when they encounters an antigen. The second type of memory T ceils, known as "central memory T cells" (TCM), express the chemokine receptor CCR7 similar to naive T cells and lack immediate effector function. When TEM cells encounter the same antigen that initially caused their activation, they quickly convert back to effector T cells without the need for co-stimulation. Such rapid redeployment of effector T cells without the need for co-stimulation allows the immune system to attack the antigen in a very efficient manner.<br>
ion Channels: Molecular Targets for Pharmacological Intervention<br>
Ion channels are proteins embedded within the eel! membrane that control the selective flux of ions across the membrane, thereby allowing the rapid movement of ions during electrical signaling processes. Because ion concentrations are directly involved in the electrical activity of excitable cells (e.g., neurons), the functioning (or malfunctioning) of ion channels can substantially control the electrical properties and. behavior of such cells. Indeed, a variety of disorders, broadly termed as "chahnelopathies," are believed to be linked to ion channel insufficiencies or dysfunctions.<br>
Ion channels are referred to as "gated" if they can be opened or closed. The basic types of gated ion channels include a) ligand-gated channels, b) mechanically gated channels and c) voltage-gated channels. In particular, voltage-gated channels are found in neurons and muscle cells. They open or<br><br><br>
In recent years, drug development "efforts have included work aimed at identifying and characterizing various ion channels and designing agents that increase or decrease the flux of ions through those ion channels to bring about desired therapeutic’ effects.<br>
Kv1,3 Channels and Their Roll in T Cell Physiology.<br>
The predominant voltage-gated potassium ion channel in human T-lymphocytes is encoded by Kvt.S, a S/7a/cer-re!ated gene. Kv1.3 channels have been characterized extensively at the molecular and physiological level and are known to play a vital role in controlling T-iymphocyte proliferation, mainly by maintaining the membrane potential of resting T-lymjSiiocytes. For example, encephalitogenic and anthropogenic rat T cells that have been chronically activated with myelin antigens have been shown to express a unique channel phenotype (high Kv1.3 channels and low IKCa1 channels), distinct from that seen in quiescent and acutely activated T cells (Beeton et ai., 2001, Selective blockade of T lymphocyte K{+) channels ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model for multiple sclerosis. Proc. Natl. Acad. Set. USA 98:13942) and such findings have been confirmed in myelin antigen specific T cells from human patients suffering from multiple sclerosis (MS). Contrary to myelin-reactive T cells from  healthy controls and to amidogen or control antigen activated T cells from MS patients, myelin reactive T cells from MS patients predominantly expressed surface markers of terminally differentiated effector memory T ceils (CCR7-CD45RA') and exhibited the Kv1.3’'9’lKCal"' phenotype (Wolff et ai., The voltage-gated Kvl .3 K(+) channel in effector memory T cells as new target for MS. 2003, J. Clin. Invest, 111:1703). In the same study, it was shown that this special K"‘ channel phenotype made the proliferation of effector memory T cells highly sensitive to inhibition by Kv1.3 blockers. Naive and central memory T cefts were only affected at 10-fold higher concentrations of Kvl.3 blockers and could escape Kvl.3 inhibition during subsequent stimulation through the up-regulation of the calcium-activated potassium channel Inca.<br><br>
" <br>
Kv1.3 and IKCa1 Expression and Functional Roles in Naive and Memory T-cells<br>
Naive, central! memory (TCM) and effector memory T (TEM) cells are classified based on the expression of the chemokine receptor CCR7 and the phosphatase CD45RA. Naive (CCR7XD45RA’) and TCM (CCR7XD45RA") cells migrate to the lymph node using CCR7 as an entry code, before migrating to sites of inflammation. In contrast. TEM cells have the ability to home directly to sites of inflammation, where they can secrete high amounts of interferon (IFN-y) and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and exhibit immediate effector function. The expression patterns of Kv1.3 and IKCa1 change dramatically as naive cells become memory cells. At rest, CD4' and CDS'" T-cells of all three subsets exhibit - 200 to 400 Kv1.3 channels, and 0 to 30 IKCa1 channels (Wulff et al., The voltage-gated Kv1.3 K(+) channel in effector memory T cells as new target for MS. 2003, J. Clin. Invest. 111:1703). Activation has diametrically opposite effects on channel expression; as naive and TCM cells move from resting to proliferating blast cells, they transcription ally up-regulate IKCal to -500 channels per cell. In contrast, activation of TEM cells enhances Kv1.3 expression without any change in IKCal levels (Wulff et al., 2003, J. Clin, invest 111:1703). Functional Kv1.3 expression increases dramatically within 15 h of activation to a level of 1500 Kvl3 channels/ceil, remains elevated for the following 48 to 72 h, and then returns to baseline over the next five days (Beeton et al.. A novel fluorescent toxin to detect and investigate Kv1.3 channel up-regulation in chronically activated T lymphocytes. 2003, J. Bioi. Chem. 278:9928)<br>
The subset-specific channel expression has important functional consequences, since Kv1.3 and IKCal regulate Ca’"" entry into T-ceils through Ca’*-release-activated Ca’"" channels that exhibit 'upside-down' voltage-dependence compared with voltage-gated Ca’"" channels. A negative membrane<br><br><br>
Depolarization resulting from Kv1.3 and IKCa1 blockade is inhibitory for Ca’"" influx, signaling and lymphocyte activation. As Kv1.3 channels predominate in resting T-cities of the three subsets, the Kv1.3 blocker She, but not the IKCa1 blocker TRAM-34, suppress antigen or amidogen-driven activation.  , She is 10-fold more effective on TEM cells than on naive and TCM cells (IC50 values of 400 pM and 4 nM, respectively), due to the fact that the latter cells rapidly up-regulate IKCal after stimulation and become less sensitive to Kv1.3 inhibitors (Wulff et al., The voltage-gated Kv1.3 K(+) channel in effector memory T cells as new target for MS. 2003, J. Clin. Invest. 111:1703). Once IKCal is up-regulated in naive and TCM cells, the reactivation of these cells is sensitive to IKCal but not Kv1.3 blockade.   cells can up-regulate IKCal following mitogen or antigen stimulation, even if their initial activation is suppressed by Kv1.3 blockade; and can consequently escape further inhibition by Kv1.3 inhibitors (Wulff et aL, 2003, J. Clin. Invest 111:1703). Early in vivo studies support these in vitro findings. The Kv1.3 blockers MgTX (Koo et al., Blockade of the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.3 inhibits immune responses in vivo. 1997, J. Immunol. 158:1520) and correlate (Koo et al., Correlate and derivatives are novel immunosuppressants blocking the lymphocyte Kv1.3 potassium channels. 1999. Cell Immunol. 197:99) effectively suppress the primary delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response in mini-pigs, but are much less effective in suppressing the secondary DTH response, presumably   to the fact that the activated naive or TCM cells involved have up-regulated IKCal expression. In contrast, TEM cells exclusively up-regulated Kv1.3 channels, and are persistently suppressed by Kv1.3 inhibitors.<br><br>
Kv1.3 and IKCa1 Expression and Functional Roles in Naive and Memory B-cells<br>
A similar change in potassium channel expression takes place during the differentiation from naive into class-switched memory B cells. While naive (lgD'CD27') and "early" memory B cells (igD'CD27’) rely on IKCa1 for their proliferation, class-switched (igD"CD271 memory B cells rely on Kv1.3 and their proliferation is therefore potently inhibited by the Kv1.3 blockers She and Psora-4 (Wulff et al. K+ channel expression during B cell differentiation: implications for Immunomodulation and autoimmunity. 2004. J. Immunol. 173:776-86). Thus, Kv1.3 blockers selectively target "late" memory responses in both the T- and B-cell lineage should be useful for the treatment of autoimmune disorders.<br>
Kv1,5 Channels and Repulation/DereQulation of Cardiac Rhythm<br>
Ion flux through voltage gated potassium channels also plays a role in regulation of cardiac rhythms. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac rhythm disturbance. AF can be treated or prevented by agents that prolong the atrial action potential duration and refractoriness. Indeed, drugs such as dovetailed, almokalant, amiodarone and d-sotalol can effectively suppress AF. However, such drugs may also prolong the ventricular action potential duration, thereby giving rise to life threatening or lethal ventricular arrhythmias. This potential for antiarrhythmic drugs to actually cause certain types of an'hythmias while preventing others is sometimes referred to as the drug's "proarrhythmic potential." Proarrhythmic potential is an important dose-limiting factor in the use of antiarrhythmic drugs. In fact, a common proarrhythmic event reported to result from the use of traditional antiamhythmic drugs that prolong ventricular depolarization (QT intent/al) to treat AF is a condition known as tirades de pointes, which is a rapid polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.<br><br>
  channels could prove to be a viable new approach for the treatment of AF with minimal or no proan’hythmic potential. However’ it is also possible that, untoward inhibition of Kv1.5 channels in patients who have normal heart rhythms could induce an electrical imbalance and actually cause arrhythmias in such patients. Thus, when developing drugs that are intended to inhibit potassium channels other than Kv1.5 (e.g., drugs intended to inhibit Kv1.3 channels to treat T cell mediated diseases), it may be desirable to design these drugs to display selectivity for the target potassium channels (e.g., Kv1.3 channels) over the heart-affecting Kv1.5 channels.<br>
In view of the foregoing, there remains a need for the synthesis and development of new potassium channel inhibitors that are specific for certain potassium channels over other potassium channels, thereby providing specific therapeutic effects with minimal side effects.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides 5-Phenoxyalkoxypsoraiens, a new class of small-molecules that block the Kv1.3 channel in the low nummular range and preferentially suppress the proliferation of effector memory T cells and affect knife and central! memory T cells only at much higher concentrations. Given the known m vitro and in vivo effects of peptide and non-peptide inhibitors of the Kv1.3 channel, the present invention further comprises the therapeutic and/or diagnostic use of these 5-phenoxyalkoxypsoralens for any diagnosis or treatment that results from or is facilitated by blocking or inhibiting of the Kv1.3 channel, including but not limited to the use of 5-phenoxyalkoxypsoralens as immunosuppressants and/or for the treatment of<br><br><br>
in accordance with the invention there are provided compositions of matter   comprising   or  consisting   of  5-phenoxyalkoxypsoraiens   of  general<br><br>
wherein:<br>
n is 1 through 10, cyclic or acyclic and optionally substituted or unsubstituted;<br>
IsO, S, N, Chirp; and<br>
R1 is arch heterocyclyl or cycloalkyl and is optionally substituted   one or more substituents selected from alkyl, alkoxy, amino and its alkyl derivatives, acylamino, carboxyl and its alkyl ester, cyano, halo, hydroxy, nitro and sulfonamide groups.<br>
Further in accordance visit the present invention, there are provided pharmaceutical preparations for administration to human or veterinary patients, said preparations comprising a 5-Phenoxyaikoxypsoralen of General Formula I above or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof alone or in combination   pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, exciplents and other ingredients commonly used in pharmaceutical preparations for oral, rectal, intravenous, intraarterial, intradermally, subcutaneous, intramuscularly, intrathecal, sublingual, buccal, intranasal, trans-mucosal, trans-dermal, topical, other enteral, other parenteral and/or other possible route(s) of administration.<br><br>
  administering to the subject a therapeutic or preventative amount of a composition of General Formula I above or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative thereof. Various diseases and disorders may be treated or prevented by inhibiting selected types of potassium channels. For example, compositions of the present invention that inhibit Kv1.3 channels on human T ceils may be used to treat or prevent T ceil mediated diseases or disorders, such as various autoimmune diseases and disorders. The following are some non-limiting examples of some T cell mediated autoimmune diseases or disorders that may be prevented or treated by the methods of the present invention, categorized p’th respect to the target organ that is principally affected by each such disease:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Irrespective of the particular organ(s) affected, T-lymphocytes are believed to contribute to the development of autoimmune diseases. The currently available therapies for these diseases are largely unsatisfactory and typically involve the use of glucocorticoids (e.g. methylprednisolone, prednisone), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, gold salts, methotrexate, antimalarials, and other immunosuppressants such as cyclosporin and FK-506. Also, another T cell mediated disorder that may be prevented or treated by the methods of the present invention is graft vs. host disease and/or rejection of transplanted organs. T-lymphocytes play a central role in the immune response and they are responsible, in large measure, for the rejection of many transplanted organs. They are also responsible for the so-called graft-versus host disease in which transplanted bone marrow cells recognize and destroy MHC-mismatched host tissues. Accordingly, drugs such as cyclosporin and FK506 that suppress T-cell immunity are used to prevent transplant rejection and graft-versus-host disease. However, immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporin A is limited by severe side effects such as liver and renal damage. Selective inhibitors of the Kv1.3 potassium channel, such as the 5-Phenoxyalkoxypsoraiens of Genera! Formula I above, may be less likely to cause such side effects and, thus, may be used alone or in combination with other agents (e.g., cyclosporin and/or FK506) to treat or prevent rejection of transplanted tissues or organs and/or<br><br>
 Preventing or treating diseases that are associated with effector memory T cells, such as; bone resorption and periodontal disease, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, type-1 diabetes mellitus and multiple sclerosis. In addition to T ceil mediated diseases, the Kv1.3 channel has been determined to regulate energy homeostasis, body weight and peripheral insulin sensitivity. Thus, the methods of the present invention may be used to treat other diseases and disorders that involve abnormal homeostasis, body weight and peripheral insulin sensitivity by inhibiting Kv1.3 channels on cell membranes, such other diseases and disorders include but are not necessarily limited to bone resorption in periodontal disease, Type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity. Additionally, for Multiple Sclerosis in particular, the current therapy with interferon-beta and Coaxing only benefits about 60% of patients. The appearance of neutralizing antibodies in around 40% of patients treated with interferon-beta makes interferon-beta treatment less effective over time in the responsive patients. Thus, the 5-Phenoxya!koxypsoralens disclosed herein may provide substantial improvements in the treatment of MS.<br>
Still further in accordance with the present invention, there are provided methods for causing a desired inhibition of a first type of potassium channel (e.g., Kv1.3 channels) while not causing undesired inhibition of a second type of potassium channel (e.g., Kv1.5 channels) in a human or animal subject. Such methods generally comprise the step of administering to the human or animal subject a compound of General Formula ! in an amount and form that a) causes the desired inhibition of potassium channels of the first type but b) does not cause the undesired inhibition of potassium channels of the second type. The "desired inhibition of a first type of potassium channel" can be, for example, any inhibition of any type of potassium channel that causes an intended therapeutic or preventative effect, such as inhibition of Kv1.3 potassium channels to treat or prevent a T cell mediated disorder in the human or animal<br><br>
  Effect untoward effect or any effect other than the desired therapeutic or preventative effect, such as the inhibition of Ki/15 potassium channels in a vary that causes a proarrhythmic effect or increases the potential for cardiac arrhythmia in the human or animal subject.<br>
Still further in accordance p’th the present Invention, there are provided methods for inhibiting potassium channels in vitro by contacting ceils with one or more compounds of General Formula !. Such methods may be useful in pharmacological research and/or for screening of drug candidates. Specific compounds of General Formula 1 may be selected for use in these methods on the basis of their relative inhibitory selectivity for certain type(s) of potassium channels over other type(s) of potassium channels.<br>
