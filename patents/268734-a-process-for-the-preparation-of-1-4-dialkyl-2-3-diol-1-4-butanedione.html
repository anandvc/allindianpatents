				<td>A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF 1.4-DIALKYL-2,3-DIOL-1,4-<br>
BUTANEDIONE<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to the field of organic synthesis and more<br>
particularly to a process for the preparation of compounds of formula (I) by the aldol<br>
condensation between an alkyl glyoxal (II) and an acetol derivative (III), said<br>
condensation being promoted by specific acidic conditions, according to Scheme (1):<br>
Scheme 1: aldol condensation of glyoxals and acetols according to the invention<br><br>
wherein R1 represents a linear or branched C1 to C5 alkyl group.<br>
Prior art<br>
The compounds of formula (I), as defined below, can be useful as starting material<br>
for the construction of compounds having a more complex skeleton, such as 4-hydroxy-<br>
2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone (known as Furaneol®, Trademark of Firmenich SA).<br>
Various processes for the preparation of compounds of formula (I) have been<br>
reported, for example Briggs et al, J. Chem. Soc. Perkin. Trans. I, 1985, 795 relates to a<br>
multistep synthesis of the 3,4-dihydroxyhexane-2,5-dione starting from tartaric acid, or<br>
Bassignani et al, J Org. Chem., 1978, 43, 4245 relates to the synthesis of the<br>
3,4-dihydroxyhexane-2,5-dione by oxidizing the expensive 2,5-dimethylfuran with the<br>
toxic and expensive KC103/OsO4 system. Another reported method to synthesize<br>
compounds (I) is the reductive dimerisation of glyoxals promoted by various methods (for<br>
instance see Buchi et al, J. Org. Chem., 1973, 38. 123).<br>
More recently, F.Naef and al. (WO 2006/048795) reported a method of<br>
preparation by aldol condensation between an alkyl glyoxal and an acetol derivative, this<br>
method requiring the mandatory presence of specific catalysts, such as Zn(AcO)2. The<br>
reported method suffers from relatively low yields and the mandatory use of metal salts as<br>
catalysts, as well as from very long reaction times.<br>
The above-mentioned methods of preparation are in general quite long and<br>
expensive or require the use of a heavy metal which implies problems of purification of<br>
the final product and of waste treatment. Furthermore, frequently the yields are low.<br>
Therefore, there is still a need for a method of preparation that is more<br>
environmental friendly, more direct or fast and providing good yields.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
In order to overcome the problems aforementioned, and provide also an<br>
alternative process for the preparation of compounds of formula (I), the present invention<br>
relates to a process aimed at the synthesis of compounds (I) in a single step and with good<br>
yields.<br>
The process of the invention concerns more specifically the aldol condensation<br>
between an alkyl glyoxal (II) and an acetol derivative (III) under acidic condition without<br>
requiring the mandatory presence of a metal salt, contrary to the prior art aldol process.<br>
Therefore, the process of the invention concerns the preparation of a compound of<br>
formula<br><br>
wherein each R1 represents, simultaneously or independently from each other, a linear or<br>
branched C1to C5 alkyl group,<br>
by the aldol condensation, in an aqueous reaction medium, between a glyoxal of formula<br><br>
wherein R1 has the same meaning as defined above,<br>
and an a-hydroxy ketone of formula<br><br>
wherein Rl has the same meaning as defined above,<br>
said process being characterized in that said aqueous reaction medium has a pH<br>
comprised between 0 and 6, and that the process is carried out at a temperature comprised<br>
between 50°C and the reflux temperature.<br>
The invention's process does not require metal catalysts, and therefore can be<br>
carried out in the absence of such compounds. In particular the catalysts of formula FeX3<br>
or MX2, wherein M is Zn2+, Mg2+, Cu2+, Fe2+ or Ca2+ and X is a C1-C7 carboxylate, a<br>
halide or an acetylacetonate derivative of formula [R2COCHCOR2]-, R2 representing a<br>
C1-C3 alkyl group or a phenyl group, as described in WO 2006/048795 are not required.<br>
According to particular embodiment of the invention, said process can be also free of any<br>
useful amount of catalysts of formula M(X)n, wherein n is 2 or 3, X is as defined above<br>
and M is a transition or alkaline-earth metal.<br>
As mentioned above the process takes place within a specific pH range of the<br>
aqueous reaction medium, i.e. form a weakly acidic to strong acidic medium.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention the present process is preferably<br>
carried out in a reaction medium having a pH comprised between 0 and 4.6, preferably<br>
between 0.0 and 3.0, or even comprised between 0.5 and 2.3.<br>
The pH can be set up to the desired value by adding into the reaction medium an<br>
acid or a base, in such a case the pH of the medium once fixed may change within the<br>
desired range during the reaction. Mixtures of acids can also be used. Alternatively, the<br>
pH of the medium can be regulated and maintained throughout the reaction by using a<br>
buffer.<br>
It is useful also to note here that an aqueous reaction medium consisting of water<br>
and compounds (II) and (III), is as such already acidic and therefore in some case it may<br>
not be necessary to add an acid to acidify the aqueous reaction medium, but rather it may<br>
be necessary to add a base to increase the pH to the desired value.<br>
Any type of acid can be used, i.e. organic, inorganic or acidic resin. Such acids are<br>
well known by a parson skilled in the art. As typical examples, one may cite the<br>
following: HCl, H2SO4, H3PO4, C1-C7 sulphonic acids (e.g. MeC6H4SO3H, MeSO3H,<br>
CF3SO3H), C1-C7 carboxylic acids (e.g. C6H5COOH, CH3COCOOH, CH3COOH,<br>
C2H5COOH) and the acidic resins such as the carboxylic or sulphonic acid supported on a<br>
methacrylic based or styrene based matrix (e.g. the one known under the tradenames<br>
Dowex® 50x8 or Amberlite® ICR 50).<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the invention, said acid is a carboxylic<br>
derivative as described above.<br>
As a base, to adjust the pH or to generate a buffer, typically an alkaline hydroxide<br>
such as NaOH or KOH, or an alkaline carbonate or bicarbonate such as Na2CO3 or<br>
NaHCO3, may be used.<br>
For the sake of clarity, by "aqueous reaction medium" it is meant here the medium<br>
wherein the reaction takes place. Therefore, the aqueous reaction medium comprises, or<br>
preferably consists of:<br>
- water and optionally a fully miscible solvent,<br>
- an appropriate amount of at least an acid or a base or of a mixture thereof, such as a<br>
buffer;<br>
- the compounds of formula (II) and (III), and optionally (I).<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the invention, said aqueous reaction<br>
medium may comprise at least 10% of water, preferably at least 15% or even more<br>
between 20% and 60% of water, percentage being relative to its own weight. The above-<br>
mentioned fully miscible solvent may be present in amount ranging between 0% and<br>
100%, percentage being relative to the weight of water. Typical examples of such<br>
solvents are tetrahydrofuran (THF), or a lower alcohol such as methanol, ethanol or a<br>
propanol.<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the invention, both Rl groups have the<br>
same meaning. According to a further embodiment both R1 groups represent a methyl<br>
group and therefore the glyoxal (II) is methyl glyoxal. the acetol (III) is acetol (i.e.<br>
l-hydroxy-2-propanone) and the dihydroxy-dione (I) is 3,4-dihydroxyhexane-2,5-dione.<br>
The amount in which the acetol derivative (III) may be employed in the<br>
invention's process is typically comprised between 0.5 and 20 molar equivalents, relative<br>
to the glyoxal. According to a particular embodiment said amount may range from 2 to<br>
10 molar equivalents, relative to the glyoxal.<br>
The temperature at which the process of the invention can be carried out is<br>
comprised between 50°C and 120°C, more preferably between 65°C and 95°C. If<br>
necessary, the reaction can also be carried out in the presence of pressure, so as to react<br>
the higher temperature of the described ranges.<br>
As mentioned above, the compound of formula (I) can be a valuable intermediate<br>
for the preparation of furanone derivatives and in particular, when R1 and R2 are both a<br>
methyl group, for the preparation of the flavor ingredient 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-<br>
furanone.<br>
Therefore another object of the present invention is a process for the preparation<br>
of a furanone of formula<br><br>
comprising the following steps:<br>
- the preparation of a compound (I), as defined hereinabove, according to a process as<br>
described in the present invention; and<br>
- the cyclisation of said compound (I).<br>
The cyclisation step can be performed according to any method known to a person<br>
skilled in the art. For example, one may cite a cyclisation method in the presence of a<br>
buffer such the ones described by Buchi et al. in J.Org.Chem, 1973, 123, or by Selinov et<br>
al. in US2002/0111500, or by Briggs et al/. in J.Chem.Soc. Perkin Trans. 1,1985, 795.<br>
Examples<br>
The invention will now be described in further detail by way of the following<br>
examples, wherein the temperatures are indicated in degrees centigrade and the<br>
abbreviations have the usual meaning in the art.<br>
Example 1<br>
Experimental procedure<br>
A solution of methyl glyoxal 43% wt in water (2.00 g, 11.9 mmol), hydroxy-acetone<br>
(4.42 g, 59.7 mmol), and acetic acid (1.43 g, 23.8 mmol) in water (0.9 ml) were stirred<br>
during 16 hours at 70° C (pH of the reaction medium was around 2.0). At the end of the<br>
reaction the reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure giving 2.1 g of the<br>
crude 3,4-dihydroxyhexane-2,5-dione (56% purity measured by GC vs. internal standard).<br>
Crude 3,4-dihydroxyhexane-2,5-dione was distilled under reduced pressure to give<br>
3,4-dihydroxyhexane-2,5-dione (1.56g, 74% purity, 66% yield) as a pale yellow solid.<br>
The product obtained had the same 1H-NMR spectra as those described in Buchi et al<br>
J.Org.Chem., 1973, 38, 123.<br>
Following the same experimental procedure as above several other experiments<br>
according to the invention were performed. The results are summarized in the Table 1.<br>
