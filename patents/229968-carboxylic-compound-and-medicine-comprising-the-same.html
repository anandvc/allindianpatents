SPECIFICATION<br>
Carboxylic compound and medicine comprising the same<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a carboxylic compound which exerts potent hypoglycemic action, plasma insulin decreasing action, and triglyceride decreasing action, and enables preventive and/or therapeutic treatment of diseases such as diabetes, complications of diabetes, hyperlipemia, and atherosclerosis, without causing weight gain or obesity.    The present invention also relates to a medicine comprising the compound.<br>
Background Art<br>
Diabetes, which is a metabolic disorder caused by plural factors, is roughly classified into Type I diabetes caused by failure of insulin secretion and Type II diabetes resulting from decline of insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues.    A rapid increase of Type II diabetes has been recognized in recent years, attributable to environmental factors such as obesity and hyperphagia as background factors. Diabetes prevalence rate in the world is estimated to be 5%.<br>
Insulin and sulfonylurea agents are frequently used for medicinal treatments of diabetes.    However, insulin and sulfonylurea agents induce hypoglycemia as a side effect and sulfonylurea agents also induce secondary pancreatic failure because of exhaustion of pancreas.    Biguanide agents improve the insulin sensitivity and slightly normalize hyperglycemia, however, the agents have possibility to induce lactic acidosis.    A thiazolidinedione type therapeutic medicine for diabetes, which has been recently developed, has an improving effect on insulin resistance in periphery (Expert Opinion on Investigational Drugs, 9, pp 1347-1361, 2000), and is considered to achieve suitable blood glucose control without causing hypoglycemia.    However, the medicine is reported to have side effects such as serious hepatic disorder.    Therefore, a non-thiazolidinedione type medicine for improving insulin resistance is desired.<br>
As a non-thiazolidinedione type compound, 2,2-dichloroalkanecarboxylic acid compound is known to lower a blood glucose level in a diabetes-model animal,<br><br>
and also exhibit decreasing actions of plasma insulin and plasma triglycerides (European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 33, pp775-787, 1998). Hyperinsulinemia suggests the presence of insulin resistance, and hyperlipemia, as a dysfunction of lipid metabolism with diabetes, is considered to be a risk factor of atherosclerosis.    Therefore, improvements of the above symptoms are important for preventive and/or therapeutic treatment of diabetes and complications of diabetes.<br>
For example, the following Compound A exert anti'diabetes actions in various animal models (Compound 3e described in Eur. J. Med. Chem., 33, pp.775-787, 1998J Metabolism, 48, pp 34-40, 1999), and effectiveness thereof is considered to be superior to that of thiazolidinedione type compounds.    Compound A has no PPAR y   activating action which is the mode of action of thiazolidinedione type compounds (Archives of Toxicology, 73, pp44O450, 1999).    Therefore, Compound A has an apparently different action from that of thiazolidinedione type compounds, and is expected to achieve reduction of side effects. Compound A<br><br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
In order to achieve effective treatment of diabetes and complications of diabetes, a compound is desired which has higher activity or has equal or higher activity at a lower dose to easily control a blood glucose level and to avoid drug interactions under combination with other agents, as well as to reduce or eliminate side effects.<br>
From the forgoing point of view, a compound which is more potent than Compound A or has the same level of activity at a lower dose as compared with Compound A is expected to be useful for preventive and/or therapeutic treatment of diabetes and complications of diabetes, and moreover, hyperlipemia and atherosclerosis.<br>

Test example 1<br>
The compounds of the present invention and the aforementioned Compound A and pioglitazone hydrochloride each as a reference compound were subjected to the measurements of the actions of lowering plasma glucose, insulin, and triglyceride in vivo according to the following method (Metabolism, 48, pp34~40, 1999, Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 44, pp2601-2611, 2001).<br><br>
(1)	Method for the measurement<br>
C57BL/KsJ db/db mouse (Journal of Clinical Investigation, 85, pp 962-967, 1990) was used as an experimental animal, which was developed in The Jackson Laboratory (USA) and is known as a model animal with obesity, hyperlipemia, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance.<br>
Bloods were collected from seven weeks old db/db mice from their orbital sinus by using heparin-treated capillary tubes.    After centrifugation of the bloods, plasma was collected and then subjected to measurements of concentrations of plasma glucose, insulin, and triglyceride to divide the animals.    From the next day of the day of blood collection, the administrations of the compounds were started. The compounds were orally administered once a day for 14 days.    On the 14th day, blood was collected from orbital sinus two hours after the administration of the compounds.    Plasma was collected, and subjected to measurements of concentrations of plasma glucose, insulin, and triglyceride.<br>
The dose required for reduction of plasma glucose concentration by 25 % (ED25) was obtained using the value of the vehicle administered group as 100 % (Arznimittel-Forschung, 40, pp 156-162, 1990).<br>
(2)	Results<br>
Table 1 shows the actions of the compounds of the present invention and the reference compounds for reduction of plasma glucose, insulin, and triglyceride.    The results shown in table 1 indicate that the compounds of the present invention give more potent actions for reduction of plasma glucose, insulin, and triglyceride than Compound A and pioglitazone hydrochloride.<br><br><br>
The compounds of the present invention were found to have the actions even at lower doses.    Therefore, as for the plasma glucose reducing action, doses that induce the actions were compared by calculating ED25 values.    Ratios of the effects of the compounds of the present invention and the reference compounds on reduction of plasma glucose are shown in Table 2 as ED25 values.    Among the compounds of the present invention, the compound of Example 2 (4) gave the value of 0.6 mg/kg;<br><br>
the compound of Example 4 (4) gave 1.1 mg/kg; and the compound of Example 5 (4) gave 0.5 mg/kg, whereas the compound A gave 2.8 mg/kg.    The compounds of the present invention thus gave the same level of plasma glucose reducing action at 1/2.5 to 1/5.6 doses as that of compound A.<br>
These results revealed that the medicine comprising the compound of the present invention was expected to achieve reduction of side effects and prevention of drug interactions when used in combination with other agents.<br><br>
