				<td>The present invention relates to a method for producing an<br>
anisotropic, sintered ferrite magnet.<br>
The present invention relates to a high-performance ferrite magnet<br>
having substantially a magnetoplumbite-type crystal structure extremely<br>
useful for wide ranges of magnet applications such as rotors for<br>
automobiles or electric apparatuses, magnet rolls for photocopiers, etc.,<br>
particularly to a high-performance ferrite magnet having a microstructure<br>
having a higher coercivity iHc (or higher coercivity iHc and residual<br>
magnetic flux density Br) than those of the conventional ferrite magnets<br>
and optionally a high squareness ratio Hk/iHc, and a method for producing<br>
such a high-performance ferrite magnet.<br>
BACKGROUND OF 1HE INVENTION<br>
Ferrite magnets are widely used in various applications including<br>
rotors of motors, electric generators, etc. Recently, ferrite magnets having<br>
higher magnetic properties are required particularly for the purposes of<br>
miniaturization and reduction in weight in the field of rotors for<br>
automobiles and increase in performance in the field of rotors for electric<br>
apparatuses.<br>
High-performance sintered magnets such as Sr ferrite or Ba ferrite<br>
are conventionally produced through the following processes. First, iron<br>
oxide is mixed with a carbonate, etc. of Sr or Ba and then calcined to cause<br>
a ferritization reaction (ferrite-forming reaction). The resultant calcined<br>
clinker is coarsely pulverized, mixed with SiO2, SrCO3, CaCO3, etc. for<br>
controlling sintering behavior and A12O3, Cr2O3, etc. for controlling iHc,<br>
and then finely pulverized to an average diameter of 0.7-1.2 mm in a<br>
solvent. A slurry containing the finely pulverized ferrite-forming material<br>
is wet-molded while being oriented in a magnetic field. The resultant<br>
green body is dried, sintered and then machined to a desired shape. To<br>
increase the properties of the ferrite magnets produced by such a method,<br>
there are the following five methods available.<br>
The first method is a fine pulverization method. When the size of<br>
crystal grains in the sintered body is close to about 0.9 mm, a critical single<br>
magnetic domain diameter of a magnetoplumbite (M)-type Sr ferrite<br>
magnet, its iHc is maximum. Accordingly, fine pulverization may be<br>
carried out to an average diameter of 0.7 mm or less, for instance, taking<br>
into consideration the crystal grain growth at the time of sintering. This<br>
method is, however, disadvantageous in that finer pulverization leads to<br>
poorer water removal at the time of wet molding, resulting in poorer<br>
production efficiency.<br>
The second method is to make the sizes of the crystal grains in the<br>
sintered body as uniform as possible. Ideally, the sizes of the crystal<br>
grains are made as uniformly as possible equal to the above critical single<br>
magnetic domain diameter (about 0.9 mm), because crystal grains larger<br>
than or smaller than this size have low iHc. Specific means for achieving<br>
high performance in this method is to improve a particle size distribution of<br>
fine powder. In commercial production, however, other pulverization<br>
apparatuses than ball mills, attritors, etc. cannot be used, naturally posjng<br>
limitations in the level of improvement in magnetic properties by fine<br>
pulverization. Also, an attempt was recently published to produce fine<br>
ferrite powder having a uniform particle size by a chemical precipitation<br>
method. Such method is, however, not suitable for industrial mass<br>
production.<br>
The third method is to improve crystal orientation affecting<br>
magnetic anisotropy. Specific means in this method is to improve the<br>
dispersion of ferrite particles in a fine powder slurry by adding a surfactant,<br>
or to increase the intensity of a magnetic field at the time of orientation,<br>
etc.<br>
The fourth method is to improve the density of a sintered body. A<br>
Sr ferrite sintered body has a theoretical density of 5.15 g/cc. Sr ferrite<br>
magnets commercially available at present have densities ranging from 4.9<br>
g/cc to 5.0 g/cc, corresponding to 95-97% of the theoretical density.<br>
Though improvement in Br is expected by increasing the density of a<br>
ferrite magnet, a higher density than the above level needs such density-<br>
increasing means as HIP, etc. However, the use of such density-<br>
increasing means leads to increase in the production cost of ferrite magnets,<br>
depriving the ferrite magnets of advantages as inexpensive magnets.<br>
The fifth method is to improve a saturation magnetization as or a<br>
crystal magnetic anisotropy constant of a ferrite compound per se, which is<br>
a main component (main phase) of the ferrite magnet. It is likely that the<br>
improvement in the saturation magnetization as directly leads to<br>
improvement in the residual magnetic flux density Br of the ferrite magnet.<br>
It is also likely that the improvement in the crystal magnetic anisotropy<br>
constant leads to improvement in the coercivity iHc of the ferrite magnet.<br>
Though research is being carried out on W-type ferrite having a higher<br>
saturation magnetization than that of the conventional ferrite compound<br>
having an M-type crystal structure, the W-type ferrite has not been<br>
subjected to mass production because of difficulty in the control of a<br>
sintering atmosphere.<br>
Widely used at present among the above methods for improving the<br>
properties of ferrite magnets are the first to fourth methods, though it is<br>
difficult to drastically improve the properties of ferrite having a main phase<br>
expressed by SrOnFe203 by the first to fourth methods for the reasons<br>
described below. The first reason is that the above first to fourth methods<br>
include conditions lowering productivity or steps difficult to carry out from<br>
the aspect of mass production. The second reason is that further<br>
improvement in magnetic properties, particularly Br, is extremely difficult<br>
because they are close to the theoretically highest level.<br>
Next, as a result of investigation of a hexagonal magnetoplumbite-<br>
type sintered ferrite magnet described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 9-<br>
115715, it has been found that higher iHc cannot easily be achieved.<br>
It may be considered as a specific means for the above fifth method<br>
to mix ferrite expressed by AOnFe203, wherein A is Sr and/or Ba, with<br>
other types of metal compounds such as metal oxides to replace part of A<br>
and Fe elements in the ferrite with other elements thereby improving the<br>
magnetic properties of the ferrite.<br>
The magnetism of the magnetoplumbite-type ferrite magnet is<br>
derived from a magnetic moment of Fe ions, with a magnetic structure of a<br>
ferri-magnet in which magnetic moment is arranged partially in antiparallel<br>
by Fe ion sites. There are two methods to improve the saturation<br>
magnetization in this magnetic structure. The first method is to replace<br>
the Fe ions at sites corresponding to the antiparallel-oriented magnetic<br>
moment with another element, which has a smaller magnetic moment than<br>
Fe ions or is non-magnetic. The second method is to replace the Fe ions<br>
at sites corresponding to the parallel-oriented magnetic moment with<br>
another element having a larger magnetic moment than Fe ions.<br>
Also, increase in a crystal magnetic anisotropy constant in the<br>
above magnetic structure can be achieved by replacing Fe ions with another<br>
element having a stronger interaction with the crystal lattice. Specifically,<br>
Fe ions are replaced with an element in which a magnetic moment derived<br>
from an orbital angular momentum remains or is large.<br>
With the above findings in mind, research has been conducted for<br>
the purpose of replacing Fe ions with various elements by adding various<br>
metal compounds such as metal oxides. As a result, it has been found that<br>
Mn, Co and Ni are elements remarkably improving magnetic properties.<br>
However, the mere addition of the above elements would not provide<br>
ferrite magnets with fully improved magnetic properties, because the<br>
replacement of Fe ions with other elements would destroy the balance of<br>
ion valance, resulting in the generation of undesirable phases. To avoid<br>
this phenomenon, ion sites of Sr and/or Ba should be replaced with other<br>
elements for the purpose of charge compensation. For this purpose, the<br>
addition of La, Nd, Pr, Ce, etc. is effective, resulting in magnetoplumbite-<br>
type ferrite magnets having high Br or high Br and coercivity.<br>
When compounds of rare earth elements such as La and compounds<br>
of M elements such as Co are added to produce high-performance ferrite<br>
magnets by the fifth method, it is usual to carry out the addition of such<br>
compounds before the calcination, namely before the ferritization reaction.<br>
Such addition method is called herein "prior-addition method." Though<br>
the ferrite magnets formed by the prior-addition method have high Br and<br>
high iHc, the squareness ratio Hk/iHc tends to remarkably decrease as the<br>
amounts of these elements added increase, particularly when R is La and M<br>
is Co. The tendency of decrease in the squareness rajjo Hk/iHc by the<br>
prior-addition method is also appreciated in the case of R = La, M = Co +<br>
Zn, or M = Co + JVJn. Because the critical demagnetizing field intensity<br>
decreases by decrease in the squareness ratio Hk/iHc, the ferrite magnets<br>
are likely to lose its magnetization. How easily the ferrite magnets lose<br>
their magnetization is critical particularly when the ferrite magnets are<br>
assembled in magnetic circuits for rotors, etc. Ferrite magnets with higher<br>
squareness ratio Hk/iHc are thus desired.<br>
Therefore, high-performance ferrite magnets satisfactory both in a<br>
coercivity iHc (or coercivity iHc and residual magnetic flux density Br) and<br>
in a squareness ratio Hk/iHc are desired.<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a high-<br>
performance ferrite magnet having substantially a magnetoplumbite-type<br>
crystal structure, which has higher coercivity iHc (or higher coercivity iHc<br>
and residual magnetic flux density Br) than those of conventional ferrite<br>
magnets and also has high squareness ratio Hk/iHc, thus useful in wide<br>
varieties of magnet applications such as rotors for automobiles and electric<br>
appliances, magnet rolls for photocopiers, etc., and a method for producing<br>
such a high-performance ferrite magnet.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a high-<br>
performance ferrite magnet having substantially a magnetoplumbite-type<br>
crystal structure, which has higher coercivity iHc (or higher coercivity iHc<br>
and residual magnetic flux density Br) and higher squareness ratio Hk/iHc<br>
than those of conventional ferrite magnets, and also has a micro structure in<br>
which the concentration of an R element is high in crystal grain boundaries,<br>
and a method for producing such a high-performance ferrite magnet.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided method for producing an anisotropic,<br>
sintered ferrite magnet having a basic composition represented by the<br>
following general formula:<br>
(A1-xRx)O.n[ (Fe1-yMy)2O3] by atomic ratio,<br>
wherein A is Sr or (Sr+Ba), and Sr is an indispensable element, R is at<br>
least one of rare earth elements including Y, M is at least one element<br>
selected from the group consisting of Co, Mn, Ni and Zn, and Co is an<br>
indispensable element, and the percentage of Co in M is 50 atomic % or<br>
more, and x, y and n are numbers meeting the following conditions:<br>
0.01 =;x=0.4,<br>
0.005 =sy=0.04, and<br>
5=n=6<br>
said anisotropic, sintered ferrite magnet having a magnetoplumbite-<br>
type crystal structure,<br>
said method comprising the steps of uniformly mixing at least one of<br>
Sr compound and Ba compound with Fe compound; calcining the resultant<br>
uniform mixture; adding the R element and the M element in the form of a<br>
compound to the resultant calcined powder at a pulverization step after the<br>
calcination thereof; molding the resultant pulverized powder in a in a<br>
magnetic field; and sintering the resultant green body, wherein a hydroxide<br>
of the R element is added as said R compound, and/or a hydroxide of the M<br>
element is added as said M compound.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As a result of intense research in view of the above objects, the<br>
inventors have found that the addition of an R element and an M element<br>
by a post-addition method or a prior/post-addition method to ferrite having<br>
a basic composition represented by (A1.xRx)O-n[(Fe1.yMy)2O3], wherein A is<br>
Sr and/or Ba, R is at least one of rare earth elements including Y, and M is<br>
at least one element selected from the group consisting of Co, Mn, Ni and<br>
Zn can turn the ferrite to a higher-performance ferrite substantially having a<br>
magnetoplumbite-type crystal structure with a higher squareness ratio<br>
Hk/iHc and a reduced variation of shrink ratio, while keeping good<br>
coercivity iHc (or good coercivity iHc and residual magnetic flux density<br>
Br). The present invention has been completed based upon this finding.<br>
Thus, the ferrite magnet according to the first embodiment of the<br>
present invention has a basic composition represented by the following<br>
general formula:<br>
wherein A is Sr and/or Ba, R is at least one of rare earth elements including<br>
Y, M is at least one element selected from the group consisting of Co, Mn,<br>
Ni and Zn, and x, y and n are numbers meeting the following conditions:<br>
and has a substantially magnetoplumbite-type crystal structure, the R<br>
element and/or the M element being added in the form of a compound at a<br>
pulverization step after calcination.<br>
The ferrite magnet according to the second embodiment of the<br>
present invention has a basic composition represented by the following<br>
general formula:<br>
(A1-xRx)O-n[(Fe1.yMy)2O3] by atomic ratio,<br>
wherein A is Sr and/or Ba, R is at least one of rare earth elements including<br>
Y, M is at least one element selected from the group consisting of Co, Mn,<br>
Ni and Zn, and x, y and n are numbers meeting the following conditions:<br>
and has a substantially magnetoplumbite-type crystal structure, the R<br>
element and/or the M element being added in the form of a compound both<br>
at a mixing step before calcination and at a pulverization step after<br>
calcination.<br>
In both cases, the concentration of the R element is preferably<br>
higher in boundaries than in the magnetoplumbite-type crystal grains.<br>
When the R element is La and the M element is Co, the ferrite magnet has a<br>
residual magnetic flux density Br of 4,100 G or more, a coercivity iHc of<br>
4,000 Oe or more and a squareness ratio Hk/iHc of 92.3% or more at 20°C.<br>
Also, when the R element is La and the M element is Co plus Mn and/or Zn,<br>
the ferrite magnet has a residual magnetic flux density Br of 4,200 G or<br>
more, a coercivity iHc of 3,000 Oe or more and a squareness ratio Hk/iHc<br>
of 93.5% or more at 20°C.<br>
The method for producing a ferrite magnet according to the first<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the ferrite magnet having a basic<br>
composition represented by the following general formula:<br>
(A1.xRx)O-n[(Fe1.yMy)2O3] by atomic ratio,<br>
wherein A is Sr and/or Ba, R is at least one of rare earth elements including<br>
Y, M is at least one element selected from the group consisting of Co, Mn,<br>
Ni and Zn, and x, y and n are numbers meeting the following conditions:<br>
0.01=x=0.4,<br>
[x/(2.6n)]=sy=s[x/(1.6n)], and<br>
5=sn=6,<br>
and substantially having a magnetoplumbite-type crystal structure,<br>
the method comprising the steps of uniformly mixing a compound of Sr<br>
and/or Ba with an iron compound; calcining the resultant mixture; adding<br>
the R element and/or the M element in the form of a compound to the<br>
resultant calcined powder at a pulverization step thereof; and sintering the<br>
resultant mixture.<br>
The method for producing a ferrite magnet according to the second<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the ferrite magnet having a basic<br>
composition represented by the following general formula:<br>
(A1.xRx)O-n[(Fe1.yMy)2O3] by atomic ratio,<br>
wherein A is Sr and/or Ba, R is at least one of rare earth elements including<br>
Y, M is at least one element selected from the group consisting of Co, Mn,<br>
Ni.and Zn, and x, y and n are numbers meeting the following conditions:<br>
0.01^x^0.4,<br>
[x/(2.6n)]:sy
5sns6,<br>
and substantially having a magnetoplumbite-type crystal structure,<br>
the method comprising the steps of adding a compound of the R element<br>
and/or the M element at a percentage of more thanO atomic % and 80<br>
atomic % or less on an element basis at a step of uniformly mixing a<br>
compound of Sr and/or Ba with an iron compound; calcining the resultant<br>
uniform mixture; adding the remaining amount of the compound of the R<br>
element and/or|the M element to the resultant calcined powder at a<br>
pulverization step thereof; and sintering the resultant mixture.<br>
In both cases, added as the R element compound is preferably an<br>
oxide, a hydroxide, a carbonate or an organic acid salt of at least one<br>
element selected from the group consisting of La, Nd, Pr and Ce. Also,<br>
preferably added as the M element compound is an oxide, a hydroxide, a<br>
carbonate or an organic acid salt of at least one element selected from the<br>
group consisting of Co, Mn, Ni and Zn. It is also preferable to add only a<br>
Co compound as the M element compound.<br>
In a case where a high-performance ferrite magnet is produced by<br>
the post-addition or prior/post-addition of the R element and the M element,<br>
the resultant ferrite magnet shows extremely suppressed tendency of<br>
decrease in a squareness ratio Hk/iHc as the amounts of the R element and<br>
the M element added (values of x and y) increase, as compared with the<br>
ferrite magnets obtained by the prior-addition method.<br>
The post-addition or prior/gost-addition of the R element and the M<br>
element may lead to the deterioration of Br and iHc and to variation in a<br>
shrinkage ratio of a sintered body. To prevent the deterioration of Br and<br>
iHc and the variation of a sintering shrinkage ratio, it is preferable to add an<br>
Fe compound at the time of pulverization after calcination, in such an<br>
amount as not to hinder the magnetic orientation of a green body along a<br>
magnetic field during a process of forming the green body. Specifically,<br>
the amount of the Fe compound post-added is preferably 0.1-11 weight %<br>
on an iron element basis, based on the total amount of Fe contained in the<br>
ferrite magnet.<br>
It has been found that when the post-addition method is adopted, the<br>
amounts of the R element and the M element (values of x and y) increase,<br>
resulting in decrease in a molar ratio n, which in turn leads to the<br>
deterioration of Br and iHc. It has also been found that when the molar<br>
ratio n decreases, variations in the size of the resultant sintered body may<br>
take place. The mechanism of decrease in the molar ratio n is as follows:<br>
Investigation is conducted on the case of the production of a ferrite magnet<br>
by the post-addition method, in which calcined ferrite powder having a<br>
composition of SrO5.9Fe203, namely SrFen 8O18 7 (molar ratio n is 5.9), is<br>
used, and a La oxide is added in the course of fine pulverization to<br>
substitute about 20% of the Sr ion site with La. In this case, in order that<br>
the ferrite magnet contains substantially the same number of Co atoms as<br>
that of La atoms under charge compensation conditions, the corresponding<br>
amount of a Co oxide is simultaneously added. Assuming that all of Co<br>
added is contained as the M phase, the resultant ferrite sintered body has<br>
Thus, the molar ratio n decreases from 5.9 at the stage of a calcined<br>
powder to 4.9 by the post-addition of the La oxide and the Co oxide.<br>
When the molar ratio n becomes less than 5, the relative percentage of<br>
components corresponding to the Fe ion site bearing magnetism decreases,<br>
resulting in drastic decrease in magnetic properties. At the same time, the<br>
sintering shrinkage ratio indicating how much the size changes in the<br>
course from the green body to the sintered body drastically changes,<br>
resulting in large unevenness in the sizes of the resultant ferrite magnet<br>
products.<br>
The molar ratio n of the calcined powder may be set large in<br>
advance, taking into consideration a decrease in the molar ratio n by the<br>
post-addition method. However, this means is not effective.<br>
Investigation will be made assuming that calcined powder having a<br>
composition of SrO-n1Fe2O3 is used, and that both a La oxide and a Co<br>
oxide are added at the time of fine pulverization to produce a high-<br>
performance ferrite magnet having the following basic composition:<br>
(Sr1-xLax)O-n2[(Fe1-yCoy)2O3] by atomic ratio,<br>
wherein 0.01=x=0.4, and x/(2.6n2)=sy=sx/(1.6n2). If the values of x and y<br>
were determined such that n1 = 6.5, and n2 = 5.9, the molar ratio n2 of the<br>
resultant ferrite magnet would be 5.9, within a range (5-6) of the molar<br>
ratio n suitable for the ferrite magnet. However, the ferrite magnet shows<br>
extremely poor magnetic properties in this case. The reason therefor is<br>
that when the molar ratio nx of the calcined powder is more than 6,<br>
undesirable phases such as a-Fe2O3 other than the M phase appear in the<br>
calcined powder. Because the undesirable phases are non-magnetic<br>
phases, they reduce the magnetic orientation of a green body obtained by a<br>
wet-molding method in a magnetic field. Thus, when the molar ratio nt of<br>
the calcined powder exceeds 6, \Br, a squareness ratio Hk/iHc, etc.<br>
drastically decrease, even if the molar ratio n2 of a ferrite magnet obtained<br>
by the post-addition method is controlled within the range of 5-6.<br>
Accordingly, it is preferable to add an iron compound such as iron<br>
oxide, etc. by a post-addition method, to set the molar ratio n of a sintered<br>
ferrite magnet obtained by the post-addition method and/or the prior/post-<br>
addition method within the desired range of 5-6 without excessively<br>
increasing the molar ratio n of the calcined powder. It is preferable that<br>
the calcined powder has a molar ratio of 5-6 before the post-addition.<br>
In addition, the post-addition method or the prior/post-addition<br>
method is advantageous for the reason that it makes easy the mass<br>
production of ferrite magnets. This is because the calcined powder of Sr<br>
and/or Ba ferrite containing no or small amounts of R elements and M<br>
elements can be used in the post-addition method or the prior/post-addition<br>
method. More conveniently, by controlling the amounts of R elements<br>
and M elements at the fine pulverization step after calcination, it is made<br>
easy to produce ferrite magnets containing R elements and M elements<br>
whose amounts differ depending on fine pulverization lots, namely ferrite<br>
magnets having various magnetic properties.<br>

THE BEST MODE FOR CONDUCTING THE INVENTION<br>
[1] Ferrite magnet<br>
The basic composition of the ferrite magnet to which the present<br>
invention is applicable is represented by the following general formula:<br>
(A1.xRx)O-n[(Fe1.yMy)2O3] by atomic ratio,<br>
wherein A is Sr and/or Ba R is at least one of rare earth elements including<br>
Y,M is at least one element selected from the group consisting of Co, Mn,<br>
Ni and Zn, and x, y and n are numbers meeting the following conditions:<br>
0.01=;x=0.4,<br>
[x/(2.6n)]=y=[x/(1.6n)], and<br>
5=n=6.<br>
To impart good magnetic properties to the ferrite magnet of the<br>
present invention, the value of n (molar ratio) should be between 5 and 6.<br>
When the value of n exceeds 6, undesirable phases such as a-Fe2O3 other<br>
than the magnetoplumbite phase are generated, resulting in drastic decrease<br>
in magnetic properties. On the other hand, when the value of n is less<br>
than 5, Br of the ferrite magnet drastically decreases.<br>
The value of x is between 0.01 and 0.4. When the value of x is<br>
less than 0.01, sufficient effects of the post-addition method or the<br>
prior/post-addition method cannot be obtained. On the other hand, when<br>
the value of x exceeds 0.4, the magnetic properties of the ferrite magnet<br>
rather decrease.<br>
To investigate the permissible range of a ratio of the R element / the<br>
M element added in connection with charge compensation, Sr, La and Co<br>
were selected as the A element, the R element and the M element,<br>
respectively, and SrCO3, Fe2O3, La2O3, and Co3O4 were formulated in such<br>
proportions as to provide the following basic composition:<br>
(Sr1.xLax)On[(Fe1.yCoy)2O3] by atomic ratio,<br>
wherein x = 0.15, y = 0.77-2.08 x 10 2, and n = 6.0,<br>
wet-mixed, and then calcined at 1200°C for 2 hours. The magnetic<br>
properties of the resultant coarse powder were measured. It has thus been<br>
found that there is no substantial deterioration in magnetic properties, as<br>
long as the ratio of x/ny is within the range of 1.6-2.6, not limited to the<br>
conditions under which the charge balance is fully kept, namely to a ratio<br>
of x to y satisfying the relation of y = x/2n. When the value of y deviates<br>
from x/(2.0n), there is likelihood that Fe2+ is contained, though there are no<br>
problems. On the other hand, when the ratio of x/ny exceeds 2.6 or is less<br>
than 1.6, remarkable decrease in magnetic properties is appreciated.<br>
Accordingly, the ratio of x/ny should be between 1.6 and 2.6. This<br>
condition may be converted to the formula of y as follows:<br>
[x/(2.6n)]«sy=s[x/(1.6n)].<br>
In typical example, the preferred range of y is 0.04 or less,<br>
particularly 0.005-0.03. Even when the contents of the R element and the<br>
M element meet the equation of y = x/(2.0n), part of the R element and/or<br>
the M element may be accumulated in high concentration in the vicinity of<br>
grain boundaries, without causing any problems.<br>
In any of the post-addition method and the prior/post-addition<br>
method, the R element is preferably at least one selected from the group<br>
consisting of ta, Nd, Pr and Ce. In one example of the ferrite magnets of<br>
the present invention, the percentage of La in R is preferably 50 atomic %<br>
or more, more preferably 70 atomic % or more, particularly preferably 99<br>
atomic % or more to improve saturation magnetization thereof. The R<br>
element may be composed of La only.<br>
In another example of the ferrite magnets of the present invention,<br>
the total percentage of Nd, Pr and/or Ce in R is preferably 50 atomic % or<br>
more, more preferably 70 atomic % or more, particularly preferably 99<br>
atomic % or more to improve saturation magnetization thereof.<br>
In a further example of the ferrite magnets of the present invention,<br>
the total percentage of one or more of La, Nd, Pr and Ce in R is preferably<br>
50 atomic % or more, more preferably 70 atomic % or more, particularly<br>
preferably 99 atomic % or more to improve saturation magnetization<br>
thereof.<br>
The M element is preferably composed of Co only, or Co plus Mn<br>
and/or Ni. Particularly to have higher Br and iHc than those of the<br>
conventional ferrite magnets, it is preferable to select Co plus Mn and/or Ni<br>
as M. The addition of Mn contributes to provide ferrite magnets with<br>
good magnetic properties, even when the R element is added in a smaller<br>
amount than the level that would be required by the charge compensation<br>
conditions but for Mn.<br>
When Mn is contained, the content of Mn is preferably 0.4<br>
atomic % or more, assuming that the total amount of Mn and the other M<br>
element is 100 atomic %. For instance, when M consists of Co and Mn,<br>
the content of Mn is preferably 0.4-75 atomic %, more preferably 0.7-60<br>
atomic %, particularly preferably 1-50 atomic %, assuming that Co + Mn is<br>
100 atomic %. When the content of Mn is less than 0.4 atomic %,<br>
improvement in Br_by adding Mn cannot be appreciated. On the other<br>
hand, when the content of Mn exceeds 75 atomic %, iHc of the ferrite<br>
magnet drastically decreases.<br>
Also, when Co + Mn +Ni (Zn) are selected as the M elements, the<br>
content of Mn is preferably 0.4-75 atomic %, more preferably 0.7-60<br>
atomic %, particularly preferably 1-50 atomic %, assuming that the total<br>
amount of Co + Mn +Ni (Zn) is 100 atomic %.<br>
Further, when M consists of Co and Ni, the percentage of Ni in M is<br>
preferably 10-75 atomic %, more preferably 10-60 atomic %, particularly<br>
preferably 10-50 atomic %, based on the total amount (100 atomic %) of<br>
the M elements, to have higher Br and iHc than those of the conventional<br>
ferrite magnets. When the percentage of Ni in M is less than 10 atomic %,<br>
remarkable improvement in Br cannot be obtained. On the other hand,<br>
when the percentage of Ni exceeds 75 atomic %, iHc of the ferrite magnet<br>
decreases drastically.<br>
Further, when Mn and/or Ni is selected as M, the content of Mn is<br>
preferably 0.4-75 atomic %, more preferably 0.7-60 atomic %, particularly<br>
preferably 1-50 atomic %, based on the total amount (100 atomic %) of Mn<br>
+ Ni, so that the ferrite magnet can have higher magnetic properties than<br>
those of the conventional ferrite magnets.<br>
The ferrite magnet obtained by the post-addition method or<br>
prior/post-addition method of the present invention substantially has a<br>
magnetoplumbite-type crystal structure. When the R element is La and<br>
the M element is Co, the ferrite magnet has a residual magnetic flux density<br>
Br of 4,100 G or more, a coercivity iHc of 4,000 Oe or more and a<br>
squareness ratio Hk/iHc of 92.3% or more at 20°C. Also, when the R<br>
element is La and the M element is Co plus Mn and/or Zn, the ferrite<br>
magnet has a residual magnetic flux density Br of 4,200 G or more, a<br>
coercivity iHc of 3,000 Oe or more and a squareness ratio Hk/iHc of 93.5%<br>
or more at 20° C.<br>
The Hk used herein, which is a parameter measured to obtain the<br>
squareness ratio, is a value on the H axis in a graph of a 4pI-H curve,<br>
wherein 4pl represents the intensity of magnetization and H represents the<br>
intensity of a magnetic field, at a position in the second quadrant where 4pI<br>
is 0.95 Br. The squareness ratio is defined as a value of Hk/iHc obtained<br>
by dividing Hk by iHc in the above demagnetization curve.<br>
In the ferrite magnet of the present invention, the M element is<br>
sufficiently dissolved in the magnetoplumbite-type ferrite crystal grains,<br>
though the concentration of the M element tends to be higher in the crystal<br>
grain boundaries than in the crystal grains.<br>
[2] Production method<br>
In the standard process for producing ferrite magnets essentially<br>
comprising the steps of mixing of starting material powders -» calcination<br>
-&gt; fine pulverization of calcined-&gt;powder -&gt; molding -» sintering -»<br>
machining, the basic composition of the ferrite magnet is substantially<br>
achieved at the fine pulverization step and thereafter.<br>
Preferable as materials for supplying the R elements are oxides or<br>
hydroxides of R elements, particularly hydroxides. Specifically, one or<br>
more of oxides such as La2O3, hydroxides such as La(OH)3, carbonate<br>
hydrates such as La2(CO3)3-8H2O, organic acid salts such as<br>
La(CH3CO2)31.5H2O, La2(C2O4)310H2O, etc. may be used. Oxides,<br>
hydroxides, carbonates and organic acid salts of R elements (Nd, Pr, Ce)<br>
other than La may also be used. Further, one or more of oxides,<br>
hydroxides, carbonates and organic acid salts of mixtures of rare earth<br>
elements (La, Nd, Pr and Ce) may also be used. The addition of<br>
hydroxides of R elements tends to improve Br, iHc and a squareness ratio<br>
Hk/iHc than the addition of oxides thereof. In addition, inexpensive<br>
Misch metals (mixed rare earth elements) containing 50 atomic % or more<br>
of one or more of La, Nd, Pr and Ce may also be used.<br>
Compounds of M elements are preferably added in the form of<br>
oxides or hydroxides, particularly hydroxides. Specifically, one or more<br>
of oxides such as Co3O4; hydroxides such as Co(OH)2, Co3O4n1HjO,.<br>
wherein n1 is a positive number; carbonates such as CoCO3; basic<br>
carbonates such as m2CoCO3m3Co(OH)2-m4H2O, wherein m2, m3 and m4<br>
are positive numbers, may be used. Oxides, hydroxides or carbonates of<br>
Mn, Ni or Zn may also be used. The addition of hydroxides of M<br>
elements tends to improve Br, iHc and a squareness ratio Hk/iHc than the<br>
addition of oxides thereof.<br>
In both of the post-addition method and the prior/post-addition<br>
method, it is preferable to add iron compounds at the time of pulverization<br>
(particularly fine pulverization) after calcination to adjust the molar ratio n.<br>
The addition of iron compounds at the time of pulverization serves to<br>
arbitrarily adjust the values of y and n at the time of fine pulverization.<br>
The iron compounds post-added may be one or more oxides<br>
selected from Fe3O4, Fe2O3 (a-Fe2O3, Y~Fe2O3) and FeO. Also, hydroxides<br>
of iron may be one or more of Fe(OH)2, Fe(OH)3 and FeO(OH).<br>
The amount of the iron compound post-added is preferably 0.1-11<br>
weight % on an iron element basis, per the total amount of Fe added.<br>
When the amount of the iron compound post-added is less than 0.1<br>
weight %, sufficient effects of addition cannot be obtained. On the other<br>
hand, when the amount of the iron compound post-added exceeds 11<br>
weight %, orientation of ferrite particles at the time of molding in a<br>
magnetic field is reduced, resulting in drastic decrease in Br.<br>
The post-addition of the iron compound serves to increase the molar<br>
ratio n, resulting in drastic improvement in a squareness ratio. For<br>
instance, when the R element is La and the M element is Co, the ferrite<br>
magnet has a squareness ratio Hk/iHc of 92.3% or more at 20°C. Also,<br>
when the R element is La and the M element is Co plus Mn and/or Zn, the<br>
ferrite magnet has a squareness ratio Hk/iHc of 93.5% or more at 20°C.<br>
In both cases, the resultant ferrite magnets have a stable shrinkage ratio.<br>
Also at the pulverization step after calcination, spinel-type ferrite<br>
compounds such as CoOFe203 instead of the Co compound, MnOFe203<br>
instead of the Mn compound, ZnO-Fe2O3 instead of the Zn compound, (Co,<br>
Mn)OFe203 instead of the Co compound and the Mn compound, (Mn,<br>
Zn)OFe203 instead of the Mn compound and the Zn compound, (Co,<br>
Zn)OFe203 instead of the Co compound and the Zn compound, and (Co,<br>
Mn, Zn)OFe203 instead of the Co compound, the Mn compound and the<br>
Zn compound may be added to suppress decrease in the molar ratio n by<br>
the post-addition method.<br>
At the wet-fine pulverization step after calcination, powder of<br>
compounds of the R elements and/or the M elements, and if necessary,<br>
powder of the iron compounds are added in such amounts as to obtain the<br>
formulation equal to the final composition of the ferrite sintered body.<br>
Wet fine pulverization is carried out until the average diameter of the<br>
powder mixture becomes 0.4-0.9 mm. A slurry of finely pulverized<br>
powder is concentrated or dried, crumbled, milled, wet-molded and then<br>
sintered.<br>
When pulverization is carried out to an average diameter of less<br>
than 0.4 mm, undesirable crystal grain growth takes place at the sintering<br>
step, resulting in decrease in coercivity and the deterioration of water<br>
removal characteristics at the wet-molding step. Also, when the average<br>
diameter of the powder exceeds 0.9 mm, there are a lot of coarse crystal<br>
grains in the structure of the ferrite sintered body.<br>
It is preferable to add SiO2, .CaO2 GaCO3, etc. as elements for<br>
controlling a sintering phenomenon at the pulverization step after<br>
calcination. SiO2 is an additive for suppressing crystal grain growth at the<br>
sintering step, and the amount of SiO2 added is preferably 0.05-0.5<br>
weight %, assuming that the basic composition of the ferrite magnet is 100<br>
weight %. When the amount of SiO2 added is less than 0.05 weight %,<br>
excessive crystal grain growth takes place at the sintering step, resulting in<br>
decrease in coercivity. On the other hand, when the amount of SiO2<br>
added exceeds 0.5 weight %, crystal grain growth is excessively suppressed,<br>
resulting in insufficient improvement in orientation that occurs<br>
simultaneously with the crystal grain growth, which leads to decrease in Br.<br>
CaO is an element for accelerating the crystal grain growth, and the<br>
amount of CaO added is preferably 0.35-0.85 weight %, assuming that the<br>
basic composition of the ferrite magnet is 100 weight %. When the<br>
amount of CaO added exceeds 0.85 weight %, excessive crystal grain<br>
growth takes place at the sintering step, resulting in decrease in coercivity.<br>
On the other hand, when the amount of CaO added is less than 0.35<br>
weight %, crystal grain growth is excessively suppressed, resulting in<br>
insufficient improvement in orientation that occurs simultaneously with the<br>
crystal grain growth, which leads to decrease in Br.<br>
The ferrite magnet produced by the prior/post-addition method is<br>
likely to have substantially an intermediate microstructure between the<br>
microstructure of the prior-addition method and that of the post-addition<br>
method. In the prior/post-addition method, when the R element added at<br>
the pulverization step, particularly fine pulverization step, after calcination<br>
is 20 atomic % or more, particularly 40 atomic % or more, and less than<br>
100 atomic %, for instance, 50-80 atomic %, per the total amount of the R<br>
element added, good improvement in a squareness ratio Hk/iHc can be<br>
achieved. Also, in the prior/post-addition method, when the M element<br>
added at the pulverization step, particularly fine pulverization step, after<br>
calcination is 20 atomic % or more, particularly 40 atomic % or more, and<br>
less than 100 atomic % per the total amount of the M element added,<br>
remarkable improvement in a squareness ratio Hk/iHc can be achieved.<br>
The important requirements for obtaining the high-performance<br>
ferrite magnet are that the composition of the ferrite powder used should be<br>
properly controlled, and that the ferrite powder should not be agglomerated<br>
in a slurry. As a result of investigation to achieve a state in which each<br>
particle of the ferrite powder exists independently in the slurry, it has been<br>
found that the agglomeration of ferrite powder is destroyed by drying or<br>
concentrating a ferrite powder slurry obtained by the wet-fine pulverization<br>
of ferrite powder, adding a dispersant to the resultant high-concentration<br>
slurry and milling the slurry, resulting in improvement in orientation of<br>
ferrite magnet powder, which leads to improvement in magnetic properties.<br>
It has also been found that by adding a dispersant to the slurry at a mixing<br>
step, good dispersion can be achieved due to surface modification of ferrite<br>
magnet powder by the adsorption of the dispersant, resulting in further<br>
improvement in a magnetic force of the ferrite magnet.<br>
Known as dispersants are surfactants, higher aliphatic acids, higher<br>
aliphatic acid soap, aliphatic acid esters, etc. It has been found that the<br>
dispersion of ferrite particles can be improved by using a polycarboxylic<br>
acid dispersant, one of anionic surfactants, effectively preventing the<br>
agglomeration of ferrite particles. There are many types of<br>
polycarboxylic acid dispersants, and particularly effective for improvement<br>
in the dispersion of ferrite particles among them is an ammonium salt of<br>
polycarboxylic acid.<br>
The amount of the dispersant added is preferably 0.2-2 weight %,<br>
per a solid component in the fine powder slurry. When the amount of the<br>
dispersant added is less than 0.2 weight %, effects of adding the dispersant<br>
cannot be obtained. On the other hand, when it exceeds 2 weight %, the<br>
residual magnetic flux density of the ferrite magnet rather decreases.<br>
The present invention will be described in detail below referring to<br>
EXAMPLES, without intention of restricting the scope of the present<br>
invention thereto.<br>
REFERENCE EXAMPLES 1-9, COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES 1-3<br>
SrCO3, Fe2O3, oxides of R elements and oxides of M elements were<br>
formulated to provide the following basic composition:<br>
(Sr1.xRx)O-n[(Fe1.yMy)2O3] by atomic ratio,<br>
wherein n = 6.0, x = 0.15, and y = x/2n = 0.0125, wet-mixed, and then<br>
calcined at 1200°C for 2 hours in the air. La was selected as the R<br>
element under the criterion that La has an ion radius close to a radius of an<br>
Sr ion. Also, Ti, V, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn were selected as the M<br>
elements under the criterion that they had ion radii close to a radius of an<br>
Fe ion.<br>
As COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1, a ferrite composition in which n<br>
= 6.0 and x = y = 0 in the above basic composition, namely SrO6.0Fe203,<br>
was calcined in the same manner. Also, as COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES<br>
2 and 3, calcined powder having the same composition as in REFERENCE<br>
EXAMPLES except that the R element was La and that the M element was<br>
Cu or Co + Cu was produced.<br>
Each calcined powder was coarsely pulverized in a dry state by a<br>
roller mill, and each of the resultant coarse powder was measured with<br>
respect to magnetic properties by a vibration-type magnetometer. The<br>
highest intensity of a magnetic field in which measurement was carried out<br>
was 12 kOe, and a saturation magnetization as and He were determined by<br>
a-l/H2 plot. The resultant phases of the coarse powder were identified by<br>
X-ray diffraction, with the results summarized in Table 1. It is<br>
appreciated from Table 1 that when Cu was not contained as the M element,<br>
only X-ray diffraction peaks for a magnetoplumbite phase (M phase) were<br>
observed in any powder. It is also appreciated from Table 1 that when La<br>
was selected as the R element, and Mn, Mn + Co, Ni or Ni + Co was<br>
selected as the M element, the resultant calcined powder had higher as (or<br>
higher as and He) than that in COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1, suggesting<br>
that such calcined powder had a potential that a high-performance, bulk<br>
ferrite magnet could be formed therefrom by sintering.<br>
In the present invention, combinations of La and Mn + Ni, La and<br>
Mn + Co + Ni, La and Mn + Co + Zn, La and Co + Ni + Zn, La and Mn +<br>
Ni + Zn, and La and Mn + Co + Ni + Zn may further by used. Among<br>
them, when Co is contained, the percentage of Co in the M elements is<br>
preferably 10 atomic % or more to have higher Br and iHc than those of<br>
conventional ferrite magnets.<br>
2 hours in the air. The calcined powder was coarsely pulverized in a dry<br>
state by a roller mill, and then finely pulverized in a wet state by an attritor<br>
to produce a slurry containing fine powder of 0.80 mm in average diameter.<br>
At an early stage of the fine pulverization of each coarse powder, 0-2.5<br>
weight % of La2O3 and 0-2.3 weight % of CoO, based on the weight of the<br>
coarse powder, were added. Also, 1.3 weight % of Cr2O3 was added at an<br>
early stage of the fine pulverization of coarse powder to produce a slurry as<br>
a comparative material. In any cases, 0.50 weight % of SrCO3, 0.30<br>
weight % of SiO2 and 0.80 weight % of CaCO3 (0.45 weight % as CaO),<br>
based on the weight of the coarse powder, were added as sintering aids.<br>
For instance, the final basic composition obtained when 2.50 weight % of<br>
La2O3 and 1.15 weight % of CoO were added approximately corresponds to<br>
the following formula:<br>
(Sr1.xLax)0-n[(Fe1.yCoy)203] by atomic ratio,<br>
wherein x = 0.15, y = x/2n, and n = 5.25.<br>
A slurry containing each fine powder of 0.8 mm was wet-molded in<br>
a magnetic field of 10 kOe, and each of the resultant green bodies was<br>
sintered at 1210-1230°C for 2 hours. Each of the resultant sintered bodies<br>
was machined to a shape of about 10 mm x 10 mm x 20 mm to measure<br>
magnetic properties at 20°C by a B-H tracer. The results are shown in Fig.<br>
1.<br>
It is clear from Fig. 1 that the addition of 2.50 weight % of La2O3<br>
and 1.15 weight % of CoO (indicated by "V") greatly improves iHc as<br>
compared with no addition (indicated by "O"), with extremely smaller<br>
decrease in Br in a high iHc region than in the case of the addition of Cr2O3<br>
that is usually added to increase iHc (indicated by " X "). Further, iHc was<br>
low when only CoO was added (indicated by "A, ?"), or when the<br>
balance of charge compensation was destroyed (indicated by "O").<br>
This EXAMPLE has proved that by utilizing the post-addition<br>
method in which the La compound and the Co compound are added to<br>
provide the Sr ferrite magnet with the desired basic composition, at the<br>
time of fine pulverization after the preparation of coarse calcined powder,<br>
the Sr ferrite magnet has higher Br and iHc than the original Sr ferrite<br>
magnet.<br>
Next, observation by a scanning-type electron microscope (SEM)<br>
was carried out on samples cut away in an appropriate size from sintered<br>
bodies prepared by adding La2O3 and CoO at a fine pulverization step.<br>
Table 2 shows the results of SEM analysis of magnetoplumbite-type ferrite<br>
crystal grains and crystal grain boundaries in these samples. It is clear<br>
from Table 2 that La (R element) and Co (M element) are fully dissolved in<br>
the magnetoplumbite-type ferrite crystal grains, though they also exist in<br>
crystal grain boundaries in large amounts. Further, analysis by SEM, etc.<br>
at 20 sites in each of the crystal grain boundaries and the crystal grains of<br>
this sample have revealed that La (R element) and/or Co (M element) tend<br>
to be higher in concentration in the crystal grain boundaries than in the<br>
magnetoplumbite-type ferrite crystal grains. This clearly has a close<br>
relation to the fact that the ferrite magnet was prepared by the post-addition<br>
method in which La2O3 and CoO were added for adjustment to the basic<br>
composition of the sintered body at the fine pulverization step after<br>
Though this EXAMPLE indicates a case where R = La and M = Co,<br>
it should be noted that ferrite magnets formed from combinations of other<br>
R elements and other M elements would also have high coercivity iHc (or<br>
high coercivity iHc and residual magnetic flux density Br), as long as they<br>
have the same microstructures as in this EXAMPLE.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
This EXAMPLE shows that variation of magnetic properties and<br>
shrinkage ratio decreases by the addition of an iron compound at a fine<br>
pulverization step after calcination, in the production of ferrite magnets by<br>
a post-addition method.<br>
SrCO3 and Fe2O3 were formulated to provide a basic composition of<br>
SrO-nFe2O3, wherein n = 5.9, wet-mixed, and then calcined at 1250°C for 2<br>
hours in the air. The calcined powder was coarsely pulverized in a dry<br>
state by a roller mill, and then finely pulverized in a wet state by an attritor<br>
to produce a slurry containing fine powder of 0.8 mm in average diameter.<br>
Added at an early stage of the fine pulverization of the coarse powder were<br>
2.5 weight % of La2O3, 1.2 weight % of Co3O4 and 2-8 weight % of Fe3O4<br>
(magnetite), based on the weight of the coarse powder. Further, 0.1<br>
weight % of SrCO3,1.0 weight % of CaCO3 and 0.3 weight % of SiO2,<br>
based on the weight of the coarse powder, were added as sintering aids.<br>
Each of the resultant fine powder slurries were wet-molded in a magnetic<br>
field of 10 kOe, and each of the resultant green bodies was sintered at<br>
1210-1230°C for 2 hours. The resultant sintered body had a basic<br>
composition approximately corresponding to the following formula:<br>
(Sr1.xLax)O-n[(Fe1.yCoy)2O3] by atomic ratio,<br>
wherein x = 0.15, y = x/2n, and n = 5.32-5.67.<br>
The resultant sintered body was machined to a shape of about 10<br>
mm x 10 mm x 20 mm to measure magnetic properties at 20°C by a B-H<br>
tracer. The results are shown in Fig. 2, in which the axis of ordinates<br>
represents Br (kG), and the axis of abscissas represents iHc (kOe).<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Ferrite magnets having the following basic composition:<br>
(Sr1.xLax)O-5.20[(Fe1.yCoy)2O3] by atomic ratio,<br>
wherein x = 0.15, and y = x/2n, were prepared in the same manner as in<br>
EXAMPLE 2 except for adding no Fe3O4. The resultant ferrite magnets<br>
had a molar ratio n decreased to 5.20. the magnetic properties measured<br>
in the same manner as in EXAMPLE 2 are shown in Fig. 2.<br>
It is clear from Fig. 2 that magnetic properties are improved when<br>
2-8 weight % of Fe3O4 was added than when the amount of Fe3O4 added<br>
was 0 weight %. For instance, the addition of 6 weight % of Fe3O4<br>
contributed to increase in Br by about 100 G in a case where there was no<br>
change in iHc, and increase in iHc by about 600 Oe in a case where there<br>
was no change in Br, as compared to no addition of Fe3O4 (EXAMPLE 3).<br>
It has further been found by investigation in connection with Fig. 2<br>
that not only improvement in Br, iHc and a squareness ratio Hk/iHc but<br>
also stabilization of shrinkage ratio can be achieved by the addition of 0.1-<br>
11 weight % (on an Fe element basis) of Fe3O4 as compared to no addition<br>
of Fe3O4 (EXAMPLE 3). Also, when the amount of Fe3O4 added was 0.1-<br>
11 weight % (on an Fe element basis), high-coercivity, high-performance<br>
ferrite magnets having Br of 4,150-4,400 G, iHc of 4,050-4,500 Oe, and a<br>
squareness ratio Hk/iHc of 94.5-96% were obtained.<br>
Next, correlation between the amount of Fe3O4 added and a<br>
shrinkage ratio will be investigated. As shown in Fig. 3, the shrinkage<br>
ratio includes a shrinkage ratio (Sh//) along the direction of magnetic<br>
anisotropy (Mag.) substantially identical to the direction of a magnetic field<br>
applied in a wet-molding process, and a shrinkage ratio (Sh_L) along the<br>
direction vertical thereto, each being defined as follows:<br>
(Sh//) = (h1-h2)/h1xl00(%),<br>
(Sh-L) = (lrl2) / \ x 100 (%),<br>
11 Length of green body,<br>
12: Length of sintered body,<br>
hx: thickness of green body, and<br>
h2: thickness of sintered body.<br>
With respect to ferrite magnets obtained in EXAMPLES 2 and 3, the<br>
dependency of the correlation of iHc and (Sh1) on the amount of Fe3O4<br>
added (molar ratio n) is shown in Fig. 4. In Fig. 4, five plots (O) in a<br>
case where 8.0 weight % of Fe3O4 was added indicate a range of the<br>
variation of (Sh_L) at a sintering temperature of 1210-1230°C A(Shl), a<br>
range of variation of (Sh_L) at each amount of Fe3O4 added, is defined by<br>
the formula: A(Shl) = (maximum of Sh_L) - (minimum of Sh_L). Fig. 4<br>
verifies that as the amount of Fe3O4 added (molar ratio n) increases, the<br>
range of variation of shrinkage ratio A(Sh_L) decreases. Further, when the<br>
amount of Fe3O4 added increases to 15 weight %, the molar ratio n can be<br>
increased to about 6, and A(Sh_L) can be made extremely small. Thus, in<br>
the ferrite magnets formed by the post-addition method, (Shi) and A(Sh_L)<br>
can freely be controlled within the ranges of (Sh_L) = 11-13.5% and A(Shl)<br>
= 0.05-0.9%. To suppress dimensional variations of ferrite magnet<br>
products, A(Sh-L) is preferably 0.05-0.8%, more preferably 0.05-0.5%,<br>
particularly preferably 0.05-0.3%.<br>
Further, A(Shl / Shi I), a range of variation of (Shi / Sh//) at each<br>
amount of Fe3O4 added, is defined by the formula: A(Sh_L / Sh//) =<br>
(maximum of Shi / Sh//) - (minimum of Shi / Sh//). It has been verified<br>
from measurement results related to Fig. 4 that as the amount of Fe3O4<br>
added (molar ratio n) increases, the range of variation of shrinkage ratio<br>
A(Shl / Sh//) decreases. Further, when the amount of Fe3O4 added<br>
increases to 15 weight %, the molar ratio n can be increased to about 6, and<br>
A(Shl / Sh//) can be made extremely small. Thus, in the ferrite magnets<br>
formed by the post-addition method, (Shi / Sh//) and A(Shl / Sh//) can<br><br>
freely be controlled within the ranges of (Shi / Sh//) = 1.6-2.4 and A(Shl /<br>
Sh//) = 0.05-0.30. To suppress dimensional variations of ferrite magnet<br>
products, as the molar ratio n nears about 6, D(Sh_L / Sh//) can be made<br>
small, with (Shi / Sh//) controlled to 1.9-2.2. D(Sh± / Sh//) is controlled<br>
to more preferably 0.05-0.20, further preferably 0.05-0.15, particularly<br>
preferably 0.05-0.10.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 4<br>
La and Co were selected as the R element and the M element,<br>
respectively, and SrCO3, Fe2O3, La2C)3 and Co3O4 were formulated to<br>
provide the following basic composition:<br>
(Sr1.xLax)O-n[(Fe1.yCoy)2O3] by atomic ratio,<br>
wherein x = 0-0.5, y = x/2n, and n = 5.85, wet-mixed, and then calcined at<br>
1200°C for 2 hours in the air. The calcined powder was coarsely<br>
pulverized in a dry state by a roller mill, and then finely pulverized in a wet<br>
state by an attritor to produce a slurry containing fine powder of 0.8 \im in<br>
average diameter. Added as sintering aids at an early stage of the fine<br>
pulverization of the coarse powder were 0.40 weight % of SiO2 and 0.80<br>
weight % of CaCO3 (0.45 weight % as CaO), based on the weight of the<br>
coarse powder. Each of the resultant fine powder slurries was wet-molded<br>
in a magnetic field of 10 kOe, and each of the resultant green bodies was<br>
sintered at 1210-1230°C for 2 hours. Each of the resultant sintered bodies<br>
was machined to a shape of about 10 mm x 10 mm x 20 mm.<br>
SrCO3 and Fe2O3 were formulated to provide a basic composition of<br>
SrOnFe203, wherein n = 5.6, wet-mixed, and then calcined at 1250°C for 2<br>
hours in the air. Thereafter, 2-8 weight % of Fe3O4 (magnetite) was added<br>
at an early stage of the fine pulverization step of coarse powder by a post-<br>
addition method in the same manner as in EXAMPLE 2, to produce sintered<br>
ferrite magnets. Each of the resultant sintered bodies substantially had the<br>
following composition:<br>
(Sr1-xLax)O-n[(Fe1.yCoy)2O3] by atomic ratio,<br>
wherein x = 0.15, y = x/2n, and n = 5.01-5.35.<br>
Among them, ferrite magnets having n of 5.01-5.20 had<br>
substantially as high magnetic properties as those of EXAMPLE 3, fully<br>
satisfactory for practical applications. Also, the ferrite magnets having n<br>
exceeding 5.20 had substantially as high magnetic properties as those of the<br>
equimolar-ratio ferrite magnets obtained in EXAMPLE 2.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 5<br>
Ferrite magnets were produced in the same manner as in EXAMPLE<br>
2 except that a molar ratio n in the basic composition of SrOnFe2O3 was<br>
controlled to 6.3 at the time of mixing before calcination, and that 6<br>
weight % of Fe3O4 (magnetite) was added at an early stage of the fine<br>
pulverization step of coarse powder by a post-addition method, and their<br>
magnetic properties were measured at 20°C by a B-H tracer. The resultant<br>
ferrite magnet substantially had the following composition:<br>
(Sr1.xLax)O-5.94[(Fe1.yCoy)2O3] by atomic ratio,<br>
wherein x = 0.15, and y = x/2n.<br>
The magnetic properties of these ferrite magnets were so low that<br>
they could not be plotted in Fig. 2. Considerable precipitation of a-Fe2O3,<br>
which may be considered due to insufficient ferritization reaction, was<br>
observed in the calcined powder of this COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE. It<br>
was confirmed that the precipitation of a-Fe2O3 deteriorated the magnetic<br>
properties of the final ferrite magnets.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
SrCO3 and Fe2O3 were formulated to provide a basic composition of<br>
SrOnFe203, wherein n = 5.9, wet-mixed, and then calcined at 1250°C for 2<br>
hours in the air. The calcined powder was coarsely pulverized in a dry<br>
state by a roller mill, and then finely pulverized in a wet state by an attritor<br>
to produce a slurry containing fine powder of 0.8 mm in average diameter.<br>
Added at an early stage of the fine pulverization of each coarse powder<br>
were 2.5 weight % of La2O3 and 1.2 weight % of Co3O4, together with 6<br>
weight % of Fe3O4 (magnetite) or 6.2 weight % of Fe2O3 (hematite), based<br>
on the weight of the coarse powder. Further, 0.3 weight % of SrCO3,1.0<br>
weight % of CaCO3 and 0.3 weight % of SiO2, based on the weight of the<br>
coarse powder, were added as sintering aids at an early stage of the fine<br>
pulverization of each coarse powder. Each of the resultant two fine<br>
powder slurries was wet-molded in a magnetic field of 10 kOe, and each of<br>
the resultant green bodies was sintered at 1210-1230°C for 2 hours. Each<br>
of the resultant two sintered bodies substantially had the following formula:<br>
(Sr1.xLax)O-n[(Fe1.yCoy)2O3] by atomic ratio,<br>
wherein x = 0.15, y = x/2n, and n = 5.55 (when 6 weight % of Fe3O4 was<br>
added) or n = 5.50 (when 6.2 weight % of Fe2O3 was added).<br>
Each of the resultant sintered bodies was machined to a shape of<br>
about 10 mm x 10 mm x 20 mm to measure magnetic properties at 20° C by<br>
a B-H tracer. The results are shown in Fig. 5, in which the axis of<br>
ordinates represents Br (kG), and the axis of abscissas represents iHc<br>
(kOe).<br>
It has been found from Fig. 5 and its related investigation that the<br>
addition of 6 weight % of Fe3O4 (magnetite) or 6.2 weight % of Fe2O3<br>
(hematite) contributes to remarkable improvement in magnetic properties,<br>
D(Sh_L), and D(Sh_L / Sh//) as compared with EXAMPLE 3. Thus, Fe2O3<br>
(hematite) is as effective as Fe3O4 (magnetite) in the post-addition method.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
SrCO3 and Fe2O3 were formulated to provide a basic composition of<br>
SrOnFe2O3, wherein n = 5.9, wet-mixed, and then calcined at 1250°C for 2<br>
hours in the air. The calcined powder was coarsely pulverized in a dry<br>
state by a roller mill, and then finely pulverized in a wet state by an attritor<br>
to produce a slurry containing fine powder of 0.8 mm in average diameter.<br>
Added at an early stage of the fine pulverization of each coarse powder<br>
were 2.5 weight % of La2O3, 0.6 weight % of Co3O4 and 0.6 weight % of<br>
ZnO, together with 2-8 weight % of Fe3O4 (magnetite), based on the weight<br>
of the coarse powder. Further, 0.1 weight % of SrCO3,1.0 weight % of<br>
CaCO3 and 0.3 weight % of SiO2, based on the weight of the coarse powder,<br>
were added as sintering aids at an early stage of the fine pulverization of<br>
each coarse powder. Each of the resultant two fine powder slurries wa,s<br>
wet-molded in a magnetic field of 10 kOe, and each of the resultant green<br>
bodies was sintered at 1210-1230°C for 2 hours. Each of the resultant<br>
sintered bodies substantially had the following formula:<br>
(Sr1-xLax)O-n[(Fe1-yCo05yZi05y)2O3] by atomic ratio,<br>
wherein x = 0.15, y = x/2n, and n = 5.32-5.67.<br>
Each of the resultant sintered bodies was machined to a shape of<br>
about 10 mm x 10 mm x 20 mm to measure magnetic properties at 20° C by<br>
a B-H tracer. The results are shown in Fig. 6, in which the axis of<br>
ordinates represents Br (kG), and the axis of abscissas represents iHc<br>
(kOe).<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
Ferrite magnets were produced in the same manner as in EXAMPLE<br>
6 except for no post-addition of Fe3O4 to measure their magnetic properties.<br>
The ferrite sintered bodies obtained without post-addition of Fe3O4<br>
substantially had the following formula:<br>
(Sr1-xLax)O-n[(Fe1-yCo05yZn05y)2O3] by atomic ratio,<br>
wherein x = 0.15, y = x/2n, and n = 5.20.<br>
The magnetic properties of the ferrite sintered bodies are shown in<br>
Fig. 6. It is clear from Fig. 6 that magnetic properties are improved when<br>
2-8 weight % of Fe3O4 was post-added (EXAMPLE 6) than when no Fe3O4<br>
was added (EXAMPLE 7). For instance, the addition of 6-8 weight % of<br>
Fe3O4 contributed to increase in Br by about 100 G in a case where there<br>
was no change in iHc, and increase in iHc by about 600 Oe in a case where<br>
there was no change in Br, as compared to no addition of Fe3O4.<br>
It has further been found from related investigation that not only<br>
improvement in magnetic properties but also stabilization of shrinkage ratio<br>
can be achieved by the addition of 0.1-11 weight % (on an Fe element<br>
basis) of Fe3O4 as compared to no addition of Fe3O4 (EXAMPLE 7).<br>
Specifically, the post-addition of Fe3O4 could provide high-Br, high-<br>
performance ferrite magnets with Br of 4,250-4,450 G, iHc of 3,000-3,800<br>
Oe, and a squareness ratio Hk/iHc of 94.5-97%.<br>
(Sh±) and D(Sh_L) of the ferrite magnets can freely be controlled<br>
within the ranges of (Sh±) = 11-13.5% and D(Shl) = 0.05-0.9%. To<br>
suppress dimensional variations of ferrite magnet products, D(ShJ_) can be<br>
made preferably 0.05-0.8%, more preferably 0.05-0.5%, particularly<br>
preferably 0.05-0.3%. In addition, (Sh-L / Sh//) and D(Sh± / Sh//) can<br>
freely be controlled within the ranges of (Sh± / Sh//) = 1.6-2.4 and D(ShJ_ /<br>
Sh//) = 0.05-0.30. To suppress dimensional variations of ferrite magnet<br>
products, as the molar ratio n nears about 6, D(ShJ_ / Sh//) can be made<br>
small, with (Sh_L / Sh//) controlled to 1.9-2.2. A(Sh± / Sh//) is controlled<br>
to more preferably 0.05-0.20, further preferably 0.05-0.15, particularly<br>
preferably 0.05-0.10.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
SrCO3 and Fe2O3 were formulated to provide a basic composition of<br>
SrO-nFe2O3, wherein n = 5.6, wet-mixed, and then calcined at 1250°C for 2<br>
hours in the air. Thereafter, 2-8 weight % of Fe3O4 (magnetite) was added<br>
at an early stage of the fine pulverization step of coarse powder by a post-<br>
addition method in the same manner as in EXAMPLE 6, to produce sintered<br>
ferrite magnets. Each of the resultant sintered bodies substantially had the<br>
following composition:<br>
(Sr1.xLax)O-n[(Fe1.yCo05yZn05y)2O3] by atomic ratio,<br>
wherein x = 0.15, y = x/2n, and n = 5.00-5.34.<br>
Among them, ferrite magnets having n of 5.00-5.20 had<br>
substantially as high magnetic properties as those of EXAMPLE 7, fully<br>
satisfactory for practical applications. Also, the ferrite magnets having n<br>
exceeding 5.20 had substantially the same magnetic properties as those of<br>
the equimolar-ratio ferrite magnets obtained in EXAMPLE 6.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
A ferrite magnet was produced in the same manner as in EXAMPLE<br>
8 except for adding no Fe3O4 (magnetite) at an early stage of the fine<br>
pulverization step of coarse powder, to measure magnetic properties<br>
thereof. The resultant ferrite magnet had a squareness ratio Hk/iHc of<br>
93.5%.<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
SrCO3, Fe2O3, La2O3 and Co3O4 were formulated to provide a basic<br>
composition represented by the following formula:<br>
(Sr1.xLax)O-n[(Fe1.yCoy)2O3] by atomic ratio,<br>
wherein x = 0.075, y = x/2n, and n = 5.9, wet-mixed, and then calcined at<br>
1250°C for 2 hours in the air. The calcined powder was coarsely<br>
pulverized in a dry state by a roller mill, and then finely pulverized in a wet<br>
state by an attritor to produce a slurry containing fine powder of 0.8 mm in<br>
average diameter. Added at an early stage of the fine pulverization of<br>
each coarse powder were 1.25 weight % of La2O3 and 0.6 weight % of<br>
Co3O4, together with 1-4 weight % of Fe3O4 (magnetite), based on the<br>
weight of the coarse powder. Further, 0.1 weight % of SrCO3,1.0<br>
weight % of CaCO3 and 0.3 weight % of SiO2, based on the weight of the<br>
coarse powder, were added as sintering aids at an early stage of the fine<br>
pulverization of coarse powder. The resultant fine powder slurry was<br>
wet-molded in a magnetic field of 10 kOe, and each of the resultant green<br>
bodies was sintered at 1210-1230°C for 2 hours. Each of the resultant<br>
sintered bodies substantially had a basic composition corresponding to<br>
(Sr1.xLax)O-n[(Fe1.yCoy)2O3] by atomic ratio,<br>
wherein y = x/2n, x = 0.15, and n = 5.61-5.78.<br>
Each of the resultant sintered bodies was machined to a shape of<br>
about 10 mm x 10 mm x 20 mm to measure magnetic properties at 20° C by<br>
a B-H tracer. It has been found that any ferrite magnets had substantially<br>
as high magnetic properties as those of the equimolar-ratio ferrite magnets<br>
shown in Fig 2.<br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
A ferrite magnet was produced in the same manner as in EXAMPLE<br>
10 except for adding no Fe3O4 (magnetite) at an early stage of the fine<br>
pulverization step of coarse powder, to measure magnetic properties<br>
thereof.<br>
The comparison of EXAMPLES 10 and 11 indicated the tendency<br>
that as the amount of Fe3O4 added increased, the magnetic properties were<br>
gradually improved, and both A(Shl) and A(Shl / Sh//) decreased.<br>
EXAMPLE 12<br>
SrCO3, Fe2O3, La2O3, Co3O4 and ZnO were formulated to provide a<br>
basic composition represented by the following formula:<br>
(Sr1.xLax)O-n[(Fe1.yCo05yZn05y)2O3] by atomic ratio,<br>
wherein x = 0.075, y = x/2n, and n = 5.9, wet-mixed, and then calcined at<br>
1250°C for 2 hours in the air. The calcined powder was coarsely<br>
pulverized in a dry state by a roller mill, and then finely pulverized in a wet<br>
state by an attritor to produce a slurry containing fine powder of 0.8 mm in<br>
average diameter. Added at an early stage of the fine pulverization of<br>
each coarse powder were 1.25 weight % of La2O3, 0.3 weight % of Co3O4<br>
and 0.3 weight % of ZnO, together with 1-4 weight % of Fe3O4 (magnetite),<br>
based on the weight of the coarse powder. Further, 0.1 weight % of<br>
SrCO3,1.0 weight % of CaCO3 and 0.3 weight % of SiO2, based on the<br>
weight of the coarse powder, were added as sintering aids at an early stage<br>
of the fine pulverization of coarse powder. The resultant fine powder<br>
slurry was wet-molded in a magnetic field of 10 kOe, and each of the<br>
resultant green bodies was sintered at 1210-1230°C for 2 hours. Each of<br>
the resultant sintered bodies substantially had a basic composition<br>
corresponding to<br>
(Sr1.xLax)O-n[(Fe1.yCo05yZn05y)2O3] by atomic ratio,<br>
wherein x = 0.15, y = x/2n, and n = 5.60-5.77.<br>
Each of the resultant sintered bodies was machined to a shape of<br>
about 10 mm x 10 mm x 20 mm to measure magnetic properties at 20°C by<br>
a B-H tracer. It has been found that any ferrite magnets had substantially<br>
as high magnetic properties as those of the equimolar-ratio ferrite magnets<br>
shown in Fig 6, and that their A(Sh±) was stably less than 0.5%.<br>
EXAMPLE 13<br>
A ferrite magnet was produced in the same manner as in EXAMPLE<br>
12 except for adding no Fe3O4 (magnetite) at an early stage of the fine<br>
pulverization step of coarse powder, to measure magnetic properties<br>
thereof at 20°C by a B-H tracer.<br>
The comparison of EXAMPLES 12 and 13 indicated the tendency<br>
that as the amount of Fe3O4 added increased, the magnetic properties were<br>
gradually improved, and both A(Sh±) and A(Sh_L / Sh//) decreased.<br>
By adding both La and Co, and by utilizing the post or prior/post-<br>
addition method by which the molar ratio n can be freely controlled, it is<br>
possible to provide high-coercivity, high-performance ferrite magnets<br>
having Br of 4,400-4,500 G, iHc of 4,400-4,500 Oe and Hk/iHc of 95-96%<br>
at 20°C, when compositions are selected to meet 0.1^x
By adding Cr2O3 and/or A12O3 remarkably increasing iHc while<br>
decreasing Br in an amount of 0.1-2 weight %, more preferably 0.2-1.5<br>
weight %, particularly preferably 0.3-1.0 weight %, it is possible to provide<br>
high-performance ferrite magnets having higher coercivity than that of<br>
conventional ferrite magnets while keeping high Br. When the amount of<br>
Cr2O3 and/or A12O3 added is less than 0.1 weight %, effects of adding such<br>
component are not appreciated. On the other hand, when it exceeds 2<br>
weight %, Br drastically decreases. For instance, when 0.3-1.0 weight %<br>
of Cr2O3 and/or A12O3 is added to the ferrite magnets of the present<br>
invention, they can be turned to high-performance ferrite magnets having<br>
extremely high coercivity, specifically Br of 4,200-4,300 G and iHc of<br>
4,800-5,200 Oe at 20°C.<br>
By adding La, Co and Zn and/or Mn, and by utilizing the post or<br>
prior/post-addition method by which the molar ratio n can be freely<br>
controlled according to the present invention, it is possible to provide high-<br>
Br, high-performance ferrite magnets having Br of 4,400-4,600 G, iHc of<br>
3,300-3,800 Oe and Hk/iHc of 95-97% at 20°C.<br>
In the above EXAMPLES utilizing the post-addition method and/or<br>
the prior/post-addition method, the Fe compounds such as magnetite or<br>
hematite were post-added at the time of fine pulverization. However, it<br>
should be noted that the timing of the post-addition of the Fe compounds is<br>
not particularly restricted, as long as it is after calcination. The post-<br>
addition of the Fe compounds can be carried out at any time between a<br>
state of calcined powder obtained by completion of a ferritization reaction<br>
and molding. When the post-addition of the Fe compounds is carried out<br>
at a time outside the fine pulverization step, it is preferable to perform<br>
uniform mixing such as mixing with agitation. When compounds of the R<br>
elements and/or the M elements are post-added, their post-addition can be<br>
carried out at any time between a state of calcined powder obtained by<br>
completion of a ferritization reaction and molding.<br>
Next, it has been found that if compounds of rare earth elements are<br>
added not in the form of oxides but in the form of hydroxides, carbonates<br>
or organic acid salts in the production of the ferrite magnets of the present<br>
invention, reactivity would be improved, resulting in increase in the<br>
magnetic properties of the resultant ferrite magnets. The first factor for<br>
achieving improvement in the magnetic properties is that the hydroxides,<br>
carbonates or organic acid salts of the R elements such as La, etc. are in the<br>
form of finer powder than R element oxides. The second factor is that<br>
when the hydroxides, carbonates or organic acid salts of the rare earth<br>
elements are decomposed to oxides in a temperature elevation stage at<br>
calcination or sintering, primary crystal grains are made finer, resulting in<br>
increase in reactivity. The third factor is that the above decomposition<br>
reaction per se contributes to increase in reactivity. It appears that these<br>
first to third factors similarly exist in the case of hydroxides, etc. of the M<br>
elements such as Co, etc.<br>
One example suitable for mass production is that hydroxides, etc. of<br>
the R element and the M element are added at the time of pulverization<br>
(particularly fine pulverization) after calcination to provide the final<br>
composition of the ferrite magnet according to the present invention.<br>
Effects of improving magnetic properties by hydroxides, etc. of the R<br>
elements and/or the M elements are remarkable particularly in the case of<br>
the post-addition method. This is because a ferrite composition undergoes<br>
only one high-temperature process, particularly a sintering process, in the<br>
post-addition method, whereby high reactivity of hydroxides, carbonates or<br>
organic acid salts is much more effective than in the case of a post-addition<br>
method using oxides.<br>
As an applied example in which a hydroxide of the M element is<br>
post-added, the direct addition of the hydroxide powder may be changed to<br>
the addition of a hydroxide of the M element formed by mixing a<br>
dispersion of ferrite material powder in a CoCl2 aqueous solution with an<br>
alkaline material such as NaOH, NH4OH, etc. The same is true of La.<br>
EXAMPLE 14<br>
SrCO3 and Fe2O3 were formulated to provide a basic composition of<br>
SrO5.9Fe203, wet-mixed, and then calcined at 1200°C for 2 hours in the<br>
air. The calcined powder was coarsely pulverized in a dry state by a roller<br>
mill, and then finely pulverized in a wet state by an attritor to produce a<br>
slurry containing fine powder of 0.7-0.8 \xm in average diameter.<br>
La(OH)3 and Co(OH)2 were added at an early stage of the fine<br>
pulverization of coarse powder. Further, 0.50 weight % of SrCO3, 0.80<br>
weight % of CaCO3 and 0.45 weight % of SiO2, based on the weight of the<br>
coarse powder, were added as sintering aids. The resultant fine powder<br>
slurry was wet-molded in a magnetic field of 10 kOe, and each of the<br>
resultant green bodies was sintered at 1210-1230°C for 2 hours. Each of<br>
the resultant sintered bodies substantially had the following formula:<br>
(SrlxLax)On[(Fei.yCoy)2O3],<br>
wherein x = 0.15, y = x/2n, and n = 5.20.<br>
Each of the resultant sintered bodies was machined to a shape of<br>
about 10 mm x 10 mm x 20 mm to measure magnetic properties at 20° C by<br>
a B-H tracer. The results are shown in Table 3.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 6<br>
A ferrite magnet was produced in the same manner as in EXAMPLE<br>
A t-l jf<br>

at a mixing step before calcination, to measure magnetic properties thereof.<br>
The results are shown in Table 3.<br>
EXAMPLE 15<br>
A ferrite magnet was produced in the same manner as in EXAMPLE<br>
14 except for adding La2O3 and Co3O4 in such amounts as to meet x = 0.15<br>
and y = x/2n at an early stage of the fine pulverization step of coarse<br>
powder, to measure magnetic properties thereof at 20°C by a B-H tracer.<br>
The results are shown in Table 3.<br>
20° C. It is considered that the value of Hk/iHc is a measure representing<br>
not only a squareness ratio of a demagnetization curve, but also the<br>
effectiveness of a La element and a Co element substituted to A ion sites<br>
and Fe ion sites in the M-type ferrite sintered body.<br>
The comparison of EXAMPLES 14 and 15 and COMPARATIVE<br>
EXAMPLE 6 in Table 3 indicated that by adding the La compound and the<br>
Co compound at the time of fine pulverization, and by using La(OH)3 and<br>
Co(OH)2 as the La compound and the Co compound, iHc could be<br>
remarkably improved while keeping the squareness ratio Hk/iHc at a good<br>
level.<br>
EXAMPLE 16<br>
A calcined powder having a basic composition of SrO-6.0Fe2O3 was<br>
produced by calcination at 1200°C for 2 hours in the air. The calcined<br>
powder was coarsely pulverized in a dry state by a roller mill, and then<br>
finely pulverized in a wet state by an attritor to produce a slurry containing<br>
fine powder of 0.8 \xm in average diameter. Co3O4, ZnO and La(OH)3<br>
were added in such amounts as to have a basic composition represented by<br>
(Sr1.xLax)O-n[(Fe1.yCo05yZn05y)2O3], wherein x = 0.15, y = x/2n, and n = 5.3,<br>
at an early stage of the fine pulverization of coarse powder. Also, 0.50<br>
weight % of SrCO3, 0.40 weight % of SiO2 and 0.80% weight of CaCO3<br>
(0.45 weight % as CaO), based on the weight of the coarse powder, were<br>
added as sintering aids at an early stage of the fine pulverization of coarse<br>
powder. The resultant fine powder slurry was wet-molded in a magnetic<br>
field of 10 kOe, and each of the resultant green bodies was sintered at<br>
1210-1230°C for 2 hours. Each of the resultant sintered bodies was<br>
machined to a shape of about 10 mm x 10 mm x 20 mm to measure<br>
magnetic properties at 20°C by a B-H tracer. The results are shown in<br>
Table 4.<br>
EXAMPLE 17<br>
A ferrite magnet was produced in the same manner as in EXAMPLE<br>
16 except for adding La2O3 in place of La(OH)3 at the time of fine<br>
pulverization, to measure magnetic properties thereof at 20°C by a B-H<br>
tracer. The results are shown in Table 4.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 7<br>

16 except for adding La2O3 in place of La(OH)3 at the time of mixing<br>
before calcination, to measure magnetic properties thereof. The results<br>
are shown in Table 4.<br>
The comparison of EXAMPLES 16 and 17 and COMPARATIVE<br>
EXAMPLE 7 in Table 4 indicated that the post-addition of La, Co and Zn<br>
served to improve Hk/iHc. It is also clear that La(OH)3 is effective in the<br>
case of adding La, Co and Zn.<br>
EXAMPLE 18<br>
SrCO3, Fe2O3, La2O3 and Co3O4 were formulated to provide a basic<br>
composition represented by the following formula:<br>
(Sr1-xLx)O-n(Fe1-yCoy)2O3],<br>
wherein x = 0.075, y = x/2n, and n = 5.9, wet-mixed, and then calcined at<br>
1200°C for 2 hours in the air. The calcined powder was coarsely<br>
pulverized in a dry state by a roller mill, and then finely pulverized in a wet<br>
state by an attritor to produce a slurry containing fine powder of 0.7-0.8 mm<br>
in average diameter. Post-added at an early stage of the fine pulverization<br>
of each coarse powder were La2O3 and Co3O4 in such amounts as to meet x<br>
= 0.15, y = x/2n, and n = 5.55. Further, 0.50 weight % of SrCO3, 0.80<br>

wherein x = 0.075, y = x/2n, and n = 5.9, wet-mixed, and then calcined at<br>

0.80 weight % of CaCO3 and 0.45 weight % of SiO2, based on the weight<br>

EXAMPLE 20<br>
SrCO3, Fe2O3, Co3O4, ZnO and La2O3 were formulated to provide a<br>
basic composition represented by the following formula:<br>
(Sr1.xLax)O-n[(Fe1.yCo0 5yZn0.5y)2O3] by atomic ratio,<br>
wherein x = 0.075, y = x/2n, and n = 6.0, wet-mixed, and then calcined at<br>
1200°C for 2 hours in the air. The calcined powder was coarsely<br>
pulverized in a dry state by a roller mill, and then finely pulverized in a wet<br>
state by an attritor to produce a slurry containing fine powder of 0.8 mm in<br>
average diameter. Post-added at an early stage of the fine pulverization of<br>
each coarse powder were La2O3, Co3O4 and ZnO in such amounts as to<br>
meet x = 0.15, y = x/2n, and n = 5.65. Further, 0.50 weight % of SrCO3,<br>
0.40 weight % of SiO2 and 0.80 weight % of CaCO3 (0.45 weight % as<br>

EXAMPLE 21<br>
SrCO3, Fe2O3, Co3O4, ZnO and La(OH)3 were formulated to provide<br>
a basic composition represented by the following formula:<br>
(Sr1.xLax)O-n[(Fe1.yCo05yZn05y)2O3] by atomic ratio,<br>
wherein x = 0.075, y = x/2n, and n = 6.0, wet-mixed, and then calcined at<br>

and each of the resultant green bodies was sintered at 1210-1230°C for 2<br>

about 10 mm x 10 mm x 20 mm to measure magnetic properties at 20°C by<br>
a B-H tracer. The results are shown in Table 6.<br>
EXAMPLE 22<br>
To measure the temperature characteristics of the ferrite magnets of<br>
the present invention, ferrite magnets produced at x = 0.15 (EXAMPLE 18)<br>
were machined to a predetermined shape as samples. Also, ferrite<br>
magnets were produced in the same manner as in EXAMPLE 18 except for<br>
changing x to 0, 0.10 and 0.20, respectively, and likewise machined to a<br>
predetermined shape as samples. Each sample was set in a vibration-type<br>
magnetometer (VSM-3, available from Toei Kogyo K.K.) to measure<br>
magnetic properties at temperatures varying every 10°C from -60° C to<br>
+100°C, thereby determining a temperature coefficient (a) of Br and a<br>
temperature coefficient (p) of iHc at -60°C to +100°C. The results are<br>
shown in Table 7.<br>
Table 7<br>
x a (%/°C) p (%/°C)<br>

0.15 -0.192 0.196<br>
0.20 -0.191 0.132<br>
It has been found from investigation in connection with the data of<br>
Table 7 that the ferrite magnets of the present invention obtained by<br>
addition of La and Co have p ranging from 0.13 %/°C to 0.36 %/°C. Also,<br>
related investigation has revealed that the ferrite magnets of the present<br>
invention as shown in Table 7 have Curie temperatures (Tc) in a range of<br>
425°C<tc in a composition range of o.01="x=0.4.&lt;br/">
EXAMPLE 23<br>
To measure the temperature characteristics of the ferrite magnets of<br>
the present invention obtained by addition of La, Co and Zn, ferrite<br>
magnets of EXAMPLE 20 (x = 0.15) were machined to a predetermined<br>
shape as samples. Each sample was measured with respect to magnetic<br>
properties at-60°C to +100°C in the same manner as in EXAMPLE 22,<br>
thereby determining a temperature coefficient (a) of Br and a temperature<br>
coefficient (b) of iHc. The results are shown in Table 8.<br>
The data of Table 8 have revealed that the ferrite magnets of the<br>
present invention obtained by addition of La, Co and Zn have b ranging<br>
from 0.26 %/°C to 0.36 %/°C.<br>
Fig. 7 shows the EPMA analysis results of the ferrite magnets of<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 4 (prior-addition method, x = 0.15, and n =<br>
5.85). Fig. 8 shows the EPMA analysis results of the ferrite magnets of<br>
EXAMPLE 1 (post-addition method, x = 0.15, n = 5.25, and Fe3O4 = 0<br>
weight %). Fig. 9 shows the EPMA analysis results of the ferrite magnets<br>
of EXAMPLE 2 (post-addition method, x = 0.15, n = 5.55, and Fe3O4 = 6<br>
weight %). Fig. 10 shows the EPMA analysis results of the ferrite<br>
magnets (prior/post-addition method, x = 0.20, n = 5.90, and Fe3O4 = 6<br>
weight %) produced in the same manner as in EXAMPLE 10 except for<br>
preparing calcined powder having a basic composition of<br>
(Sr1.xLax)O-n[(Fe1.yCoy)2O3], wherein x = 0.10, y = x/2n, and n = 6.0, and<br>
adding predetermined amounts of La2O3, Co3O4 and Fe3O4 at the time of<br>
fine pulverization.<br>
Each sample for EPMA analysis as shown in Figs. 7-10 was<br>
embedded in a resin such that a c surface of the ferrite magnet appeared on<br>
a surface of the resin, and mirror-polished for EPMA line analysis with<br>
A12O3 abrasive powder having a particle size of 0.05 mm. Used as an<br>
EPMA apparatus was an electron probe micro-analyzer (EPM-810Q,<br>
available from Shimadzu Corp.). The measurement conditions were an<br>
acceleration voltage of 15 kV, an acceleration current of 0.1 mA, and an<br>
irradiation beam diameter of 1 mm. In Figs. 7-10, the axis of ordinates<br>
represents the counts per second (c.p.s.) of each element of La, Co, Sr and<br>
Fe, and the axis of abscissas represents a scanning distance (mm). Figs. 7-<br>
10 show scales for the c.p.s. and the scanning distance. Spectroscopic<br>
crystals used in the EPMA apparatus were lithium fluoride (LiF) for the<br>
line analysis of La, pentaerythritol [PET, C(CH2OH)4] for the line analysis<br>
of Sr, rubidium acidic phthalate [(RAP, C6H4(COOH)(COORb)] for the line<br>
analysis of Fe, and LiF for the line analysis of Co.<br>
As shown in Figs. 7-10, variations of the c.p.s. of La read on the<br>
EPMA results in an arbitrary 80-mm range on a surface of each sample was<br>
defined as A(c.p.s.). In Fig. 7 (prior-addition method, x = 0.15, and n =<br>
5.85), A(c.p.s.) = 0.119 kc.p.s. In Fig. 8 (post-addition method, x = 0.15,<br>
n = 5.25, and Fe3O4 = 0 weight %), A(c.p.s.) = 0.512 kc.p.s. In Fig. 9<br>
(post-addition method, x = 0.15, n = 5.55, and Fe3O4 = 6<br>
weight %), A(c.p.s.) = 0.557 kc.p.s. In Fig. 10 (prior/post-addition<br>
method, x = 0.20, n = 5.90, and Fe3O4 = 6 weight %), A(c.p.s.) = 0.252<br>
kc.p.s.<br>
It is clear from investigation in connection with Fig. 7 that the prior-<br>
addition method provides D(c.p.s.) = 0.07-0.15 kc.p.s., suggesting that La is<br>
distributed more uniformly by the prior-addition method than the post-<br>
addition method in Figs. 8 and 9 and the prior/post-addition method in Fig.<br>
10. The investigation of Figs. 8 and 9 has revealed that the post-addition<br>
method provides A(c.p.s.) = 0.35-0.65, suggesting that the distribution of<br>
La is the most non-uniform. Further, Figs. 8 and 9 have revealed the<br>
tendency that the addition of Fe3O4 slightly contributes to increase in<br>
A(c.p.s.). Next, Fig. 10 has revealed that in the prior/post-addition method<br>
in which the contribution of the post-addition to the value of x and/or y is<br>
20% or more and less than 100%, D(c.p.s.) is 0.15-0.35, suggesting that the<br>
distribution of La is between that of the post-addition method and that of<br>
the prior/post-addition method.<br>
Fig. 11 shows the magnetization-temperature curves of the ferrite<br>
magnets produced by the prior-addition method, each of which has a basic<br>
composition represented by (Sr1.xLax)O-n[(Fe1.yCoy)2O3] by atomic ratio,<br>
wherein x = 0.10-0.40, y = x/2n, and n = 5.9. The axis of ordinates<br>
represents magnetization (relative value), x = 0 represents a ferrite<br>
magnet having a conventional composition of SrO5.9Fe203.<br>
An intersection of a tangent (broken line) of each curve and the axis of<br>
abscissas (magnetization = 0) is defined as the first Curie temperature (Tc1),<br>
and an intersection of each curve and the axis of abscissas (magnetization =<br>
0) is defined as the second Curie temperature (Tc2). Fig. 11 shows that in<br>
the magnetization-temperature curves of the ferrite magnets of x = 0-0.40<br>
produced by the prior-addition method, curve portions encircled by O are<br>
convexly curved relative to the tangent (broken line) extending through Tc1<br>
Fig. 12 shows magnetization-temperature curves obtained by<br>
measurement of samples cut away from the same ferrite magnets as in Fig.<br>
9 (post-addition method, x = 0.15, n = 5.55, and Fe3O4 = 6 weight %). Fig.<br>
12 further shows magnetization-temperature curves obtained by<br>
measurement of samples cut away from the same ferrite magnets as in Fig.<br>
10 (prior/post-addition method, x = 0.20, n = 5.90, and Fe3O4 = 6<br>
weight %). In the case of those obtained by the post-addition method<br>
shown in Fig. 12,Tc1 = 447°C, and Tc2 = 453°C, curve portions encircled<br>
by O being concavely curved relative to the tangent (broken line)<br>
extending through Tc1. In the case of those obtained by the prior/post-<br>
addition method shown in Fig. 12, Tcx = 445°C, and Tc2 = 453°C, curve<br>
portions encircled by O being concavely curved relative to the tangent<br>
(broken line) extending through Tc1<br>
EXAMPLE 24<br>
A ferrite magnet having the following basic composition:<br>
(Sr1.xLax)O-n[(Fe1.yCoy)2O3] by atomic ratio,<br>
wherein x = 0.15, y = x/2n, and n = 5.55, was produced by a post-addition<br>
method in the same manner as in EXAMPLE 2 except for using calcined<br>
powder having a basic composition of SrO-5.9Fe2P3, adjusting an average<br>
diameter of fine powder to 0.65 mm, and adding 7 weight % of Fe3O4 at the<br>
time of fine pulverization. 4pI-H curves of this ferrite magnet at 20° C<br>
and -40°C, respectively, are shown in Fig. 13. By utilizing the post-<br>
addition method with a desired amount of Fe3O4 added, and adjusting the<br>
average diameter of fine powder to a level of 0.4-0.65 mm suitable for high<br>
Br, extremely high Br, iHc and squareness ratio Hk/iHc, specifically Br of<br>
4.4 kG, iHc of 4.5 kOe and a squareness ratio Hk/iHc of 95% at 20°C, have<br>
been realized.<br>
The measurement results of a critical demagnetizing field intensity<br>
(AH) of this high-performance ferrite magnet at -40°C will be explained<br>
below. In Fig. 13, an operation line pi determined by a magnetic circuit<br>
comprising a ferrite magnet has an operation point at a point A on the B-H<br>
curve, and the operation point A corresponds to a point Q on the 4peI-H<br>
curve. By measurements under the condition of pi = pc +1 = 3, wherein<br>
pi represents a permeance coefficient on the 4pI-H curve, and pc represents<br>
a permeance coefficient on the B-H curve, AH was 2240 Oe as shown in<br>
Fig. 13. pi' is an operation line parallel with the operation line pi. Under<br>
the conditions of —40°C, and pi = pc +1 = 3, a magnetic flux density at the<br>
operation point A before application of AH is Bdr When AH of 2240 Oe<br>
is applied, the operation point moves to a point D on the B-H curve<br>
corresponding to the intersection C of the operation line pi1 and the 4jiI-H<br>
curve. After removal of a demagnetizing field, the operation point<br>
substantially returns to the point A at DH = 0. Thus, the magnetic flux<br>
density (Bdt) = 3650 G at the point A before application of AH is<br>
substantially equal to the magnetic flux density (Bd2) at the operation point<br>
after application and removal of DH, which returns to the point A.<br>
Accordingly, the irreversible loss of magnetic flux defined by [(Bd1 - Bd2)<br>
/ Bd1] x 100% is substantially 0%.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 8<br>
A ferrite magnet was produced in the same manner as in<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 4 except for formulating starting materials by a<br>
prior-addition method to have the following basic composition:<br>
(Sr1.xLax)O'n[(Fe1.yCoy)2O3] by atomic ratio,<br>
wherein x = 0.15, y = x/2n, and n = 5.85. 4pI-H curves of this ferrite<br>
magnet at +20°C and -40°C, respectively, are shown in Fig. 14. Because<br>
this ferrite magnet was produced by the prior-addition method, a<br>
squareness ratio Hk/iHc was as low as 76% at 20°C, though Br and iHc<br>
were as high as 4.4 kG and 4.5 kOe, respectively, at 20°C.<br>
Fig. 14 shows the measurement results of a critical demagnetizing<br>
field intensity (AH') of this ferrite magnet with a poor squareness ratio in<br>
the same manner as in Fig. 13 at -40°C. In Fig. 14, an operation line pi<br>
determined by a magnetic circuit comprising a ferrite magnet has an<br>
operation point at a point H on the B-H curve, and the operation point H<br>
corresponds to a point K on the 4jiI-H curve, pi' and pi" are operation<br>
lines parallel with the operation line pi. As shown in Fig. 14, a critical<br>
magnetic field intensity (AH') at which demagnetization does not take<br>
place under the conditions of -40°C and pi = 3 is 560 Oe (25% relative to<br>
AH in Fig. 13).<br>
Next, an irreversible loss of magnetic flux was measured after<br>
application and removal of a demagnetizing field of 2240 Oe in the same<br>
manner as in Fig 13. When the demagnetizing field of 2240 Oe is applied<br>
under the conditions of-40°C and pi = 3, the operation point moves to a<br>
point G on the B-H curve corresponding to the intersection F of the<br>
operation line pi' and the 4jiI-H curve. After removal of a demagnetizing<br>
field of 2240 Oe, the operation point substantially returns to the point H', at<br>
which the magnetic flux density (Bd2') is 3240 G. Since the magnetic<br>
flux density (Bdj') at the operation point H is 3640G before application of<br>
the demagnetizing field of 2240 Oe, the irreversible loss of magnetic flux is<br>
[(3640-3240) / 3640] x 100% = 11.0%, suggesting a larger loss of<br>
magnetic flux than in Fig 13.<br>
Investigation of Figs. 13 and 14 has revealed that in the case of the<br>
ferrite magnet of the present invention (R = La, and M = Co) having Br of<br>
4100 G or more, iHc of 4000 Oe or more and Hk/iHc of 92.3% or more,<br>
AH may be preferably 1000 Oe or more, more preferably 1500 Oe or more,<br>
particularly preferably 2000 Oe or more under the conditions of-40°C and<br>
pi^3. This ferrite magnet is suitable for solid, cylindrical magnets or ring-<br>
shaped magnets with radial or polar anisotropy capable of being<br>
magnetized symmetrically or unsymmetrically with 4-24 magnetic poles,<br>
more preferably 4-16 magnetic poles. The solid, cylindrical magnet or the<br>
ring-shaped magnet may be constituted by an integral ferrite magnet or a<br>
plurality of ferrite magnet pieces bonded together. Such integral or<br>
combined ferrite magnets can constitute, for instance, long magnet rolls for<br>
photocopiers. The present invention greatly contributes to improvement<br>
in performance and miniaturization of rotors, photocopiers, etc.<br>
In the ferrite magnet of the present invention (R = La, and M = Co<br>
+ Zn and/or Mn) having Br of 4200 G or more, iHc of 3000 Oe or more<br>
and Hk/iHc of 93.5% or more at 20°C, too, AH can be greatly improved<br>
with irreversible loss of magnetic flux suppressed.<br>
Though the above EXAMPLES are related to Sr ferrite whose R and<br>
M elements are substituted, it should be noted that Ba ferrite and Sr-Ba<br>
ferrite, whose R and M elements are substituted, also substantially have a<br>
magnetoplumbite-type crystal structure showing higher coercivity iHc (or<br>
higher coercivity iHc and residual magnetic flux density Br) than those of<br>
conventional ferrite magnets.<br>
Compounds effective for improving magnetic properties such as<br>
B2O3, Bi compounds, etc., other than SiO2 and CaO, may be added to the<br>
ferrite magnet of the present invention having a magnetoplumbite-type<br>
crystal structure. Also, the ferrite magnet of the present invention may<br>
contain less than predetermined amounts of inevitable impurities, in<br>
addition to the above indispensable components.<br>
APPLICATIONS IN INDUSTRY<br>
Because the ferrite magnet of the present invention is produced by<br>
the post-addition method and/or the prior/post-addition method in which<br>
the molar ratio n can freely be controlled, not only has it a microstructure in<br>
which the concentrations of rare earth elements are high in crystal grain<br>
boundaries, but also is it easily mass-produced. Thus, the ferrite magnet<br>
of the present invention has higher coercivity iHc (or higher coercivity iHc<br>
and residual magnetic flux density Br), higher squareness ratio Hk/iHc and<br>
smaller variation of a shrinkage ratio than those of conventional ferrite<br>
magnets.<br>
The ferrite magnets having such characteristics according to the<br>
present invention are extremely useful for various rotors, actuators, etc.<br>
required to have high Br and iHc. The Co content of less than 10<br>
atomic % extremely reduces iHc, while the Co content exceeding 95.<br>
atomic % substantially nullifies the effects of adding Zn.<br>
The ferrite magnet according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention has higher iHc than that of conventional ferrite magnets, while<br>
keeping Br equal to or higher than that of the conventional ferrite magnets.<br>
Therefore, such ferrite magnet of the present invention is expected to be<br>
used for motors for ABS, starters, etc.<br>
The ferrite magnet according to another embodiment of the present<br>
invention has higher Br than that of conventional ferrite magnets, while<br>
keeping iHc equal to or higher than that of the conventional ferrite magnets.<br>
Therefore, such ferrite magnet of the present invention is expected to be<br>
used for motors for compressors of air conditioners, etc.<br>
