				<td>COPPER-BORON MASTER ALLOY AND ITS USE IN MAKING SILVER-COPPER ALLOYS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to master metal compositions adapted for alloying with<br>
silver, to processes for making silver alloys using the master metal compositions, and to<br>
the optional further treatment of the alloys to make shaped articles and/or to effect<br>
precipitation hardening thereof.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides copper-based master alloys for alloying with silver, said<br>
master alloys containing germanium, boron and optionally other alloying ingredients<br>
including silver and/or zinc and/or silicon and/or indium.<br>
The invention further provides substantially pure copper or a copper alloy (e.g. a<br>
Cu-Ge or Cu-Zn-Ge or Cu-Ge-Si or Cu-Ge-Zn-Si alloy) containing up to 2 wt% boron<br>
introduced into the copper by means of a compound that is decomposable in situ in<br>
molten copper to form boron. Said compounds may be selected from the group<br>
consisting of alkyl boron compounds, boron hydrides, boron halides, boron-containing<br>
metal hydrides, boron-containing metal halides and mixtures thereof. Decomposition in<br>
situ is believed superior to current methods of making copper-boron master alloys by<br>
rapid melting together of copper and finely divided boron, which tends to give rise to<br>
boron hard spots. In some embodiments, usable master alloys are therefore obtainable<br>
which can impart greater boron content to the alloys in which they are incorporated<br>
while keeping development of hard spots to low acceptable levels. Boron contents of<br>
such alloys may be up to the 2 wt% level of currently available Cu-B alloys, or may be<br>
less where boron in the resulting precious metal alloy is being used as a grain refiner.<br>
Some embodiments provide Ag-Cu-Ge-B, Ag-Cu-B, Ag-Cu-B-Si or Ag-Cu-Ge-B-Si<br>
containing silver in an amount sufficient to facilitate melting or casting of the copper<br>
e.g. 1-30 wt% Ag, typically 1—25 wt% Ag and more typically 10-25 wt% Ag.<br>
The invention relates in one embodiment to a master metal composition adapted<br>
for alloying with silver to give a silver alloy containing at least 77 wt % Ag and at least<br>
0.5 wt% Ge, said master metal comprising Cu, Ge and 0.001-0.5, typically 0.005-0.3<br>
wt% boron together with any further ingredients for said alloy and any impurities.<br>
The invention further provides a process for making a silver alloy containing at<br>
least 77 wt% Ag, 1-7.2 wt% Cu, at least 0.5 wt% Ge and 0.005-0.3 wt% B together with<br>
any further ingredients for said silver alloy and any impurities, comprising the step of<br>
melting together fine silver and the master metal composition as aforesaid.<br>
The invention provides in a yet further embodiment a process for making a<br>
master alloy used in the manufacture of silver articles, which process comprises melting<br>
copper and optionally germanium or other alloying ingredients, and adding boron to the<br>
melt in the form of a compound selected from the group consisting of alky] boron<br>
compounds, boron hydrides, boron halides, boron-containing metal hydrides, boroncontaining<br>
metal halides and mixtures thereof. The present invention is applicable e.g.<br>
to the manufacture of master alloys e.g. Cu-Ge-B master alloys and Cu-B master alloys.<br>
Use of a master alloy provides a number of technical benefits. Boron is a very<br>
light element that is easily lost in the melting process. If the boron level in the alloy is<br>
too high or the boron has not been dissolved properly the result is boron hard spots,<br>
which appear as drag marks in the surface of the silver when the piece is polished.<br>
However, more boron than is needed is routinely added to compensate for its loss<br>
during melting. What happens to the additional boron is at present unknown. One<br>
possibility is that it may react with oxygen present in the silver. Another possibility is<br>
that it may react with the material of a graphite crucible in which the alloy is typically<br>
melted. A third possibility is that it may diffuse towards the surface of the melt and<br>
become oxidized by any atmospheric oxygen present. However, the combination of<br>
germanium and boron in the master alloy is believed to exhibit a protective effect and<br>
germanium may protect boron in the same manner that it protects copper.<br>
In some embodiments, order of addition of the alloying ingredients may be<br>
significant, ft is difficult to add the germanium first to a copper alloy and then to add the<br>
boron. The problem is that when using copper boride as the source of boron a much<br>
higher temperature is required to dissolve the boron into the alloy and the germanium<br>
content of the alloy may therefore be put at risk by overheating. The present master<br>
alloy is therefore normally made by melting together the highest melting elements first<br>
and progressively working through the lower melting temperature elements.<br>
Alternatively, boron is added e.g. as a boron hydride or metal boron hydride, which<br>
decomposes in contact with the molten metal of the master alloy and disperses boron<br>
into the alloy with reduced opportunity for development of hard spots and the like.<br>
The invention further provides a method for casting a master alloy containing at<br>
least Cu and B including the steps of:<br>
(a) forming a precursor master melt containing at least Cu;<br>
(b) dispersing throughout said master melt a compound selecting from the group<br>
consisting of alkyl boron compounds, boron hydrides, boron halides, boron-containing<br>
metal hydrides, boron-containing metal halides and mixtures thereof; and<br>
(c) allowing the melt to solidify.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Master alloys<br>
The master alloy may comprise 80-95 wt % Cu (or of Cu together with further<br>
ingredients for said alloy as set out below) and 20-5 wt % Ge. A preferrred class of such<br>
alloys comprises 80-86.7 wt % Cu (or of Cu together with further ingredients for said<br>
alloy) and 20-13.3 wt % Ge. A still more preferred class of alloys comprises 82-84.55<br>
wt % Cu and any iurther ingredients for said alloy and 15.5-18 wt% Ge. Alloys with<br>
about 0.03 wt% B can give desirable boron contents in the silver alloys into which they<br>
are incorporated. A preferred class of the master alloys comprises only copper,<br>
germanium, boron and impurities.<br>
The master alloy may provide the whole of the copper required for the silver<br>
alloy. Alternatively, the silver alloy may be made by melting together copper and a<br>
master alloy of the above defined genus.<br>
Incorporation of boron into copper metal or copper master alloys<br>
The master alloy precursor to which boron is added may be pure copper, Cu-Ge,<br>
or Cu or Cu-Ge further comprising small amounts of casting adjuvants e.g. Si or Ag to<br>
facilitate casting and prevent development of surface cracking and porosity. The copper<br>
or alloy will normally be at a nominal temperature for casting or pouring e.g. about<br>
1150-1200°C. The melting temperature influences the kinetics of boron evaporation<br>
which determines the final boron concentration in the cast master alloy. The selected<br>
temperature should be sufficiently above the liquidus temperature of the alloy to prevent<br>
freezing in a die during continuous casting or freezing in a grain box during grain<br>
making. While the alloys are readily cast at atmospheric pressures, higher or lower<br>
pressures should not affect the benefits of the invention, but will affect the kinetics of<br>
boron evaporation. Furthermore higher boron content is desirable for master alloys<br>
which may be melted with precious metal to make casting grain and then further melted<br>
to form rod, wire, or investment casting.<br>
In an embodiment, sufficient boron is added to the master alloy so that an<br>
effective amount remains in the cast precious metal alloy or master alloy for effective<br>
grain refinement and deoxidation. Typically, the boron content is between 100 ppm and<br>
1600 ppm for a master alloy, with a nominal boron content in the cast master alloy of<br>
about 250 ppm being more typical. Typically, from 0.01% to 0.16% of boron added to<br>
the precursor alloy melt is effective.<br>
Boron is incorporated into the present master alloys for use, in the eventual<br>
silver alloys, as an oxygen scavenger and/or as a grain refiner. It may be added as a<br>
metal boride e.g. copper boride. Alternatively it may be added e.g. to the molten master<br>
alloy e.g. Cu, Cu-Ge, Ag-Cu-Ge, Ag-Cu-Si or Ag-Cu-Ge-Si containing at least 50 wt%<br>
Cu and optionally containing incidental ingredients by bubbling a gaseous borane e.g.<br>
diborane into the master alloy in admixture with a non-reactive gas such as argon, by<br>
introducing into the master alloy a borane which is solid at ambient temperatures e.g.<br>
decaborane B10H,4 (m.p 100°C5 b.p. 213°C), or by adding an alkylated borane e.g.<br>
triethylborane or tri-n-butyl borane, although the latter reagents are spontaneously<br>
combustible and require care in handling. Preferably, however, the boron is added as a<br>
metal borohydride, e.g. a borohydride of an alkali metal, a pseudo-alkali metal or an<br>
alkaline earth metal, e.g. lithium borohydride. Sodium borohydride is especially<br>
preferred because it is widely available commercially and can be obtained in the form of<br>
relatively large pellets which are convenient to handle during precious metal melting<br>
operations.<br>
As previously explained, the boron compound may be introduced into molten<br>
copper or copper alloy in the gas phase, advantageously in admixture with a carrier gas<br>
which assists in creating a stirring action in the molten copper or copper alloy and<br>
dispersing the boron content of the gas mixture into said alloy. Suitable carrier gases<br>
include, for example, hydrogen, nitrogen and argon. The gaseous boron compound and<br>
the carrier gas may be introduced from above into a vessel containing molten copper or<br>
copper alloy e.g. a crucible in a copper-melting furnace, a casting ladle or a tundish<br>
using a metallurgical lance which may be a elongated tubular body of refractory<br>
material e.g. graphite or may be a metal tube clad in refractory material and is immersed<br>
at its lower end in the molten copper or alloy. The lance is preferably of sufficient<br>
length to permit injection of the gaseous boron compound and carrier gas deep into the<br>
molten copper or copper alloy. Alternatively the boron-containing gas may be<br>
introduced into the molten copper or copper alloy from the side or from below e.g.<br>
using a gas-permeable bubbling plug or a submerged injection nozzle. For example,<br>
Rautomead International of Dundee, Scotland manufacture horizontal continuous<br>
casting machines in the RMK series for the continuous casting of semi-finished<br>
products. The copper or alloy to be heated which may be is placed in a solid graphite<br>
crucible, protected by an inert gas atmosphere which may for example be oxygen-free<br>
nitrogen containing 
electrical resistance heating using graphite blocks. Such furnaces have a built-in facility<br>
for bubbling inert gas through the melt.<br>
Addition of small quantities of thermally decomposable boron-containing gas to<br>
the inert gas being bubbled through the melt readily provides from a desired few ppm to<br>
some hundreds or even thousands of ppm of boron into the molten metal or alloy. The<br>
introduction of the boron compound into the copper or copper alloy as a dilute gas<br>
stream over an period of time, the carrier gas of the gas stream serving to stir the molten<br>
copper or alloy, rather than in one or more relatively large quantities is believed to be<br>
favourable from the standpoint of avoiding development in the metal or alloy of boron<br>
hard spots, with the result that the resulting boron-containing alloy can serve as a master<br>
alloy for precious metal alloy manufacture with reduced development of hard spots.<br>
Compounds which may be introduced into molten copper or alloy thereof in this way<br>
include boron trifluoride, diborane or trimethylboron which are available in pressurised<br>
cylinders diluted with hydrogen, argon, nitrogen or helium, diborane being preferred<br>
because apart from the boron, the only other element is introduced into the alloy is<br>
hydrogen. A yet further possibility is to bubble carrier gas through the molten copper or<br>
alloy thereof to effect stirring thereof and to add a solid boron compound e.g. NaBH4 or<br>
NaBF4 into the fluidized gas stream as a finely divided powder which forms an aerosol.<br>
The boron compound may also be introduced into the molten copper or copper<br>
alloy in the liquid phase, either as such or in an inert organic solvent. Compounds which<br>
may be introduced in this way include alkylboranes or alkoxy-alkyl boranes such as<br>
triethylborane, tripropylborane, tri-Hrbutylborane and methoxydiethylborane which for<br>
safe handling may be dissolved in hexane or THF. The liquid boron compound may be<br>
filled and sealed into containers of copper foil resembling a capsule or sachet using<br>
known liquid/capsule or liquid/sachet filling machinery and using a protective<br>
atmosphere to give filled capsules sachets or other small containers typically of capacity<br>
0.5-5 ml, more typically about 1-1.5 ml. As an alternative the capsules or sachets may<br>
be of a polymer e.g. polyethylene or polypropylene. The filled capsules or sachets in<br>
appropriate number may then be plunged individually or as one or more groups into the<br>
molten copper or alloy thereof. A yet further possibility is to atomize the liquid boroncontaining<br>
compound into a stream of carrier gas which is used to stir the molten copper<br>
or copper alloy as described above. The droplets may take the form of an aerosol in the<br>
carrier gas stream, or they may become vaporised therein.<br>
Also as previously explained, preferably the boron compound is introduced into<br>
the molten copper or copper alloy in the solid phase, e.g. using a solid borane e.g.<br>
decaborane Bi0H14 (m.p. 100°C, b.p. 213°C). However, the boron is preferably added<br>
in the form of either a boron containing metal hydride or a boron containing metal<br>
fluoride or other halide. When a boron-containing metal hydride is used, suitable<br>
metals include sodium, lithium, potassium, calcium, zinc and mixtures thereof. When a<br>
boron-containing metal fluoride is used, sodium is the preferred metal. Most preferred<br>
is sodium borohydride, NaBFLi which has a molecular weight of 37.85, contains 28.75%<br>
boron and can be obtained in the form pf relatively large pellets which are convenient to<br>
handle during precious metal melting operations.<br>
Boron may be lost as vapour from molten copper or copper alloy at elevated<br>
temperatures and it may be necessary to make sequential additions of boron to maintain<br>
an adequate concentration for grain refining. To enable better mixing into the copper or<br>
copper alloy, the boron compound may be wrapped in a thin copper foil or thin foil of<br>
an inert material (i.e. a material which decomposes in the molten silver substantially<br>
without residue), such as paper or plastics sheet. Preferred metal for the foil is copper,<br>
but silver may also be used since it assists casting properties. The foil preferably has a<br>
thickness of from about 0.01 mm to about 0.3 mm to enable the foil-wrapped boron<br>
compound to be well submerged in the molten copper or alloy before the foil melts<br>
through releasing the boron compound. Once released, the constituents of the boron<br>
compound combine with oxygen in the melt to effectively deoxidize the melt and the<br>
boron is believed to react (although ;the effectiveness of the invention does not depend<br>
on the accuracy of this theory) with some x&gt;f the elements in the melt to form discrete<br>
insoluble particles dispersed throughout the base material which act as nucleation sites<br>
promoting the formation of fine grains that are uniform in size and resist growth.<br>
When boron is added to molten metal e.g. as diborane, the compound<br>
decomposes to boron and hydrogen e.g.<br>
B2H6-&gt;2B(s) + 3H2(g).<br>
The hydrogen is effective to deoxidize the melt<br>
When sodium borohydride is first added to the molten metal, the initial reaction<br>
is believed to be decomposition of the boron containing grain refiner.<br>
(1) NaBH4(s)^Na(g)+B(s)+2H2(g)<br>
After decomposition, the sodium, hydrogen and boron are all effective to deoxidize the<br>
melt as follows:<br>
(2) Na(g)+0.502(g) -^Na20(s)<br>
(3) H2(g)+0.502(g) -+H20(g)<br>
(4) B(s)H).502(g)+0.5H2(g) -&gt;HBO(g)<br>
To achieve a uniform casting, the boron may be dispersed throughout the molten metal<br>
by stirring for in excess of 1 minute and typically for from 1 -5 minutes. Stirring may be<br>
by any means which does not contaminate the molten metal such as with a graphite<br>
stirring rod.<br>
The resulting master alloy is then cast by a method suitable for forming a<br>
desired product. One such useful product is casting grains. Casting grains are particles<br>
that are sold to jewellery manufacturers who then investment cast the grains of master<br>
alloy with grains of precious metal to form a desired article of jewellery. Subsequent to<br>
stirring, molten master alloy is poured into a grain box which is a container with<br>
openings in the bottom, through which the liquid metal flows to make the desired shape<br>
and size of grains. The grain box may be made from materials similar to a melting<br>
crucible, such as, but not limited to, graphite, clay/graphite, ceramic and silicon carbide.<br>
The molten master alloy is formed into discreet droplets in the grain box as it flows<br>
through the openings and is then solidified into roughly spherical particles in grain tank<br>
containing water into which the master alloy droplets fall and solidify. The master alloy<br>
casting grain is then removed from the grain tank and dried e.g. by centrifugal force and<br>
hot air. The resulting roughly spherical grains have a typical diameter of from about 0.1<br>
mm to about 5 mm.<br>
Alloys that may be made from the present master alloys<br>
The present master alloys may be used to make alloys of silver.<br>
The present master alloys may be used to make silver/germanium alloys having<br>
an Ag content of at least 75% by weight, a Ge content of between 0.5 and 3% by<br>
weight, the remainder being copper apart from any incidental ingredients and<br>
impurities, which alloy contains boron as a grain refiner. If desired, the copper content<br>
may also be substituted, in part, by one or more incidental ingredient elements selected<br>
from Al, Ba, Be, Cd, Co, Cr, Er, Ga, In, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Pd, Pt, Si, Sn, Ti, V, Y, Yb,<br>
Zn and Zr, provided the effect of germanium in terms of providing firestain and tarnish<br>
resistance is not unduly affected. The weight ratio of germanium to incidental ingredient<br>
elements may be from 100: 0 to 80: 20, preferably from 100: 0 to 60: 40. The term<br>
"incidental ingredients" permits the ingredient to have ancillary functionality within the<br>
alloy e.g. to improve colour or as-moulded appearance, and includes amounts of the<br>
metals or metalloids Si, Zn, Sn or In appropriate for "deox".<br>
The alloys that may be made according to the invention include coinage grade,<br>
800-grade (including 830 and 850 grades and the like) and standard Sterling silver and<br>
an alloy of silver containing an amount of germanium that is effective to reduce firestain<br>
and/or tarnishing. The ternary Ag-Cu-Ge alloys and quaternary Ag-Cu-Zn-Ge or Ag-<br>
Cu-Ge-Si alloys that can suitably be made by the method of the present invention are<br>
those having a silver content of at least 80%, and most preferably at least 92.5%, by<br>
weight of the alloy, up to a maximum of no more than 98%, preferably no more than<br>
97%. The germanium content of the Ag-Cu-(Zn)-Ge or Ag-Cu-(Si)-Ge alloys should be<br>
at least 0.1 wt%, preferably at least 0.5 wt%, more preferably at least 1.1 wt% The<br>
germanium content is most preferably not more than 1.5%, by weight of the alloy, more<br>
preferably no more than 4 wt% up tp a maximum of preferably no more than 6.5 wt%.<br>
Silicon, in particular, may be atided to silver alloys e.g. in an amount of up to 0.5<br>
wt %, typically 0.5-3 wt %, more usually 0.1-0.2 wt%, and is conveniently provided in<br>
the form of a copper-silicon master alloy containing e.g. about 10 wt% Si. When<br>
incorporated e.g. into casting grain of a silver-copper-germanium ternary alloy it can<br>
provide investment castings that appear bright immediately on removal from the mould.<br>
It may be added to casting grain e.g. before investment casting or it may be incorporated<br>
into the silver at the time of first melting to form an alloy.<br>
The remainder of ternary Ag-Cu-Ge alloys, apart from impurities, incidental<br>
ingredients and any grain refiner, will be constituted by copper, which should be present<br>
in an amount of at least 0.5%, preferably at least 1%, more preferably at least 2%, and<br>
most preferably at least 4%, by weight of the final alloy. For an '800 grade' ternary<br>
silver alloy, for example, a copper content of 18.5% is suitable. Appropriate levels of<br>
copper are incorporated into the master alloy, copper usually comprising at least 50 wt%<br>
of said master alloy.<br>
The remainder of quaternary Ag-Cu-Zn-Ge alloys, apart from impurities and any<br>
grain refiner, will be constituted by copper which should be present in an amount of at<br>
least 0.5%, preferably at least 1%, more preferably at least 2%, and most preferably at<br>
least 4%, by weight of the alloy, and zinc which should be present in a ratio, by weight,<br>
to the copper of no more than 1:1. Therefore, zinc is optionally present in the silvercopper<br>
alloys in an amount of from 0 to 100 % by weight of the copper content. For an<br>
'800 grade' quaternary silver alloy, for example, a copper content of 10.5% and zinc<br>
content of 8% is suitable. Where present, zinc may be incorporated into the master<br>
alloy.<br>
In addition to silver, copper and germanium, and optionally zinc, the silver<br>
alloys preferably contain a grain refiner to inhibit grain growth during processing of the<br>
alloy, and this grain refiner is added as part of the master alloy. Suitable grain refiners<br>
include boron, iridium, iron and nickel, with boron being particularly preferred. The<br>
grain refiner, preferably boron, may be present in the Ag-Cu-(Zn)-Ge or Ag-Cu-(Si)-Ge<br>
alloys in the range from 1 ppm to 100 ppm, preferably from 2 ppm to 50 ppm, more<br>
preferably from 4 ppm to 20 ppm, by weight of the alloy.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the silver alloy is a ternary alloy consisting, apart<br>
from impurities and any grain refiner, of 80% to 96% silver, 0.1 % to 5% germanium<br>
and 1 % to 19.9% copper, by weight of the silver alloy. In a more preferred<br>

by weight of the alloy, together with 1 ppm to 40 ppm boron as grain refiner. In a<br>
further preferred embodiment, the silver alloy is a ternary alloy consisting, apart from<br>
impurities and grain refiner, of 92.5% to 96% silver, 0. 5% to 2% germanium, and 1%<br>
to 7% copper, by weight of the alloy, together with 1 ppm to 40 ppm boron as grain<br>
refiner. A particularly preferred ternary silver alloy being marketed under the name<br>
ArgentiumTM comprises 92.7-93.2 wt% Ag, 6.1-6.3 wt% Cu and about 1.2 wt% Ge.<br>
Particular known silver alloys that may benefit from incorporation of boron as<br>
Cu-B or Cu-Ge-B using the master alloys of the invention include the following:<br>
(i) US-A-3811876 (Harigawa et al, K. K. Suwa Seikosha, the disclosure of which<br>
is incorporated herein by reference) which discloses silver alloys hi which Sn, In and Zn<br>
are disclosed as synergistically reducing tarnish. It describes and claims alloys<br>
consisting essentially of 4-10 wt%;Sn, 0.5 - 12 wt% In, and 0.1 - 5 wt% Zn, the<br>
remainder being silver. It also alleges that mechanical strength and tarnish resistance<br>
may be further increased by adding Ti, Zr, Be, Cr, Si, Al, Ge and/or Sb which protect<br>
the surface of silver alloys by oxidizing preferentially and forming stable oxides.<br>
Amounts of such additional elements less than 0.001 wt% are ineffective. If more than 1<br>
wt% Ti, Zr, Be, Cr or Si is added, the alloy is said to become brittle and insoluble<br>
components are said to form that interfere with polishing. Additions of 0.001 - 5 wt%<br>
Al, Ge and Sb are said to promote tarnish resistance without reducing workability. The<br>
alloy is stated not to suffer from firestain because of the absence of copper, but is soft.<br>
(ii) US-A-4973446 (Bernhard et al., United Precious Metal Refining, the disclosure<br>
of which is incorporated herein by reference) which discloses a silver alloy composition<br>
of the Sn, In, Zn type that also contains copper and boron. It comprises 89-93.5 wt%<br>
Ag, 0.01-2 wt% Si, about 0.001-2 wt% B, about 0.5-5 wt% Zn, about 0.5-6 wt% Cu,<br>
about 0.25-2 wt% Sn, and about 0.01-1.25 wt% In. Silicon is added as a de-oxidant.<br>
Boron is added to reduce the surface tension of the molten alloy, and to allow it to blend<br>
homogeneously. Zinc is added to reduce the melting point of the alloy, to add<br>
whiteness, to act as a copper substitute, to act as a deoxidant, and to improve fluidity of<br>
the alloy. Copper is added as a conventional hardening agent for silver, as well as acting<br>
as the main carrying agent for the other materials. Tin is added to improve tarnish<br>
resistance, and for its hardening effect. Indium is added as a grain-refining agent, and to<br>
improve the wetability of the alloy. Silver must be present in the necessary minimal<br>
percentage to qualify as either coin silver or sterling silver. Master alloys for use in<br>
creating the above silver alloy compositions are also disclosed and may comprise 0.91-<br>
30.77 wt% Si, 0.001-30.77 wt% B, 4.54-76.93 wt% Zn, 4.54-92.31 wt% Cu, 2.27-30.77<br>
wt% Sn, and 0.09-19.24 wt % In. A typical master alloy comprises about 25 wt% Zn,<br>
about 54 wt% Sn, about 0.75 wt% In, about 19.44 wt% Cu, about 0.135 wt% B, and<br>
about 0.675 wt% Si. In the experience of the present inventors, although tarnish<br>
resistance is exhibited to some extent, together with some firestain reduction on<br>
investment casting, firestain resistance on soldering or annealing is not obtained<br>
because of the copper content. The disclosure if US-A-5039479 (Bernhard et al, also<br>
incorporated herein by reference) is similar.<br>
(iii) GB-B-2255348 (Rateau, Albert and Johns; Metaleurop Recherche, the<br>
disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference) which discloses a silver alloy<br>
that maintains the properties of hardness and lustre inherent in Ag-Cu alloys while<br>
reducing problems resulting from the tendency of the copper content to oxidise. The<br>
alloys are ternary Ag-Cu-Ge alloys containing at least 92.5 wt% Ag, 0.5-3 wt% Ge and<br>
the balance, apart from impurities, copper. The alloys are stainless in ambient air during<br>
conventional production, transformation and finishing operations, are easily deformable<br>
when cold, easily brazed and do not give rise to significant shrinkage on casting. They<br>
also exhibit superior ductility and tensile strength. Germanium exerts a protective<br>
function that is responsible for the advantageous combination of properties exhibited by<br>
the new alloys, and was in solid solution in both the silver and the copper phases. The<br>
microstructure of the alloy is constituted by two phases, a solid solution of germanium<br>
and copper in silver surrounded by a filamentous solid solution of germanium and silver<br>
and copper. The germanium in the copper-rich phase inhibits surface oxidation of that<br>
phase by forming a thin GeO and/or GeO? protective coating that prevents the<br>
appearance of firestain during brazing and flame annealing. Furthermore the<br>
development of tarnish is appreciably delayed by the addition of germanium, the surface<br>
turning slightly yellow rather than black and tarnish products being easily removed by<br>
ordinary tap water. The alloy is useful inter alia in jewellery.<br>
(iv) US-A-6168071 (Johns, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference) which describes and claims inter alia a silver/germanium alloy having an Ag<br>
content of at least 77% by weight, a Ge content of between 0.5 and 3% by weight, the<br>
remainder being copper apart from any impurities, which alloy contains boron as a grain<br>
refiner at a concentration of up to about 20 parts per million. If desired, an alkyl boron<br>
compound, boron hydride, boron halide, boron-containing metal hydride, boroncontaining<br>
metal halide and mixture thereof may be used to provide the boron content<br>
of the alloy instead of the disclosed CuB master alloy.<br>
(v) US-A-6406664 (Diamond, the disclosure of which is 'incorporated herein by<br>
reference) which discloses a silver alloy said to be firestain and tarnish resistant and<br>
comprising 92.5-96 wt% Ag, 0.1-0.38 wt% Ge, 0.5-3.8 wt% Sn, 0.001-0.008 wt% B,<br>
0.001-0.1 wt% Ni, balance copper, the boron being used as a grain refiner, the tin and<br>
nickel content being said to permit the amount of germanium to be reduced. The alloy is<br>
said to be capable of being age hardened, soldered, welded, formed, cast and<br>
mechanically worked. The product is stated not to shrink, to be non-porous, and to<br>
exhibit no fire scale as a result of processing involving elevated temperatures.<br>
(vi) US 6726877 (Eccles, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference) which discloses an allegedly fire scale resistant, work hardenable jewellery<br>
silver alloy composition comprising at least 86 wt% Ag, 0.5 - 7.5 wt% Cu, 0.07 - 6 wt%<br>
of a mixture of Zn and Si wherein 0.02 - 2 wt % Si and 0.01 - 2.0 wt% Ge are present.<br>
The alloy may also include rheology modifying and other additives to aid in improving<br>
the castability and/or wetting performance of the molten alloy. For example, about up to<br>
3.5% by weight of a modifying additive selected from In, B or a mixture thereof may be<br>
added to the alloy to provide grain refinement and/or provide greater wettability of the<br>
molten alloy. The compositions may be formed by the addition of a master alloy to fine<br>
silver, the master alloy comprising e.g. 52.5 - 99.85 wt % Cu, 0.1 - 35 wt % Zn and 0.05<br>
-12.5 wt% Ge.<br>
(vii) US 6841012 (Croce; Steridyne Laboratories, the disclosure of which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference) which discloses an allegedly tarnish resistant silver<br>
alloy, comprising: at least about 85% by weight of silver, and a balance of said alloy<br>
including zinc, copper, indium tin and iron and optionally further comprising at least<br>
one of gold, silicon, manganese, boron, bismuth, cobalt, chromium and lead. The<br>
presence of zinc is said to add to the whiteness of the alloy. Copper is said to act as a<br>
conventional hardening agent and to add malleability. Indium is said to add brilliance,<br>
ductility, and facilitates casting of the alloy. Tin is said to add to the hardness,<br>
malleability, ductility, and solderability of the alloy. Iron is said to add to the hardness<br>
of the alloy. Boron is said to contribute to the elimination of fire scale.<br>
(viii) US 6913657 (Ogasa, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference) which discloses alloys of a variety of precious metals. In one embodiment it<br>
discloses a hard precious metal alloy member consisting essentially of a silver alloy, the<br>
silver alloy having a silver content of not less than 80.0 wt %, and containing<br>
gadolinium in an amount of not less than 50 ppm but less than 15,000 ppm. Boron in<br>
amounts of 0.01-0.1 wt% is added to some of the alloys.<br>
(ix) US-A-2004/0219055 (Croce, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference) which discloses anti-tarnish silver alloys of the Zn, Cu, In, Sn family the<br>
alloy having at least 85 wt% Ag and the balance also including Fe. Boron is an optional<br>
ingredient.<br>
Post-treatment of articles made using the master alloys<br>
Ag-Cu-Ge silver alloy workpieces and shaped articles made from the above<br>
master alloys and heated to an annealing temperature may be self-hardening on<br>
controlled air cooling, so that products of useful hardness can be obtained without the<br>
need for reheating to effect annealing and/or precipitation hardening. The use of<br>
reheating to e.g. 180-350°C, and preferably 250-300°C, to develop further hardness is,<br>
however, also possible according to the invention. Over-aging of Ag-Cu-Ge silver<br>
alloys during precipitation hardening does not cause a significant drop-off of the<br>
hardness achieved. Processing workpieces is possible, for example as part of soldering<br>
or annealing in a mesh belt conveyor furnace or hi investment casting, reduces the<br>
number of process steps required to produce articles of a required hardness and in<br>
particular eliminates quenching e.g. with water which is required for Ag-Cu Sterling<br>
silver.<br>
A surprising difference in properties exists between conventional Sterling silver<br>
alloys and other Ag-Cu binary alloys on the one hand and Ag-Cu-Ge silver alloys on the<br>
other hand, in which gradual cooling of the binary Sterling-type alloys results in coarse<br>
precipitates and little precipitation hardening, whereas gradual cooling of Ag-Cu-Ge<br>
alloys results in fine precipitates and useful precipitation hardening, particularly where<br>
the silver alloy contains an effective amount of grain refiner. Furthermore, the addition<br>
of germanium to sterling silver changes the thermal conductivity of the silver alloy,<br>
compared to standard sterling silver. The International Annealed Copper Scale (LACS)<br>
is a measure of conductivity in metals. On this scale the value of copper is 100%, pure<br>
silver is 106%, and standard sterling silver 96%, while a sterling alloy containing 1.1%<br>
germanium has a conductivity of 56%. The significance of this is that the Argentium<br>
sterling and other germanium-containing silver alloys do not dissipate heat as quickly as<br>
standard sterling silver or their non-germanium-containing equivalents, a piece will take<br>
longer to cool, and precipitation hardening to a commercially useful level (preferably to<br>
Vickers hardness 110 or above, more preferably to 115 or above) can take place during<br>
natural air cooling or during slow controlled air cooling.<br>
Thus after the master metal defined above has been incorporated into a silver<br>
alloy starting with e.g. 999 or 9999 fine silver from a bullion manufacturer, the resulting<br>
alloy may be subjected to the further steps of annealing and/or brazing a shaped article<br>
of the alloy in a furnace, and hardening by subsequent air cooling. Thus the alloy may<br>
be annealed and/or brazed by heating in a furnace at 600-680°C, preferably 600-660°C<br>
and more preferably 600-650°C. The annealing may be during investment casting, and<br>
hardening may be by air-cooling the investment or allowing it to air cool. The final<br>
product may be an article of jewellery or giftware.<br>
The ability of the present silver alloys to precipitation harden enables the copper<br>
content of the alloy to be reduced. Even though an alloy of lower copper content may be<br>
relatively soft as cast, reheating at a low temperature e.g. 200-300°C may bring the<br>
hardness up to the level of normal sterling silver or better. This is a significant<br>
advantage because the copper content is actually the most detrimental part of the alloy<br>
from the standpoint of corrosion resistance, but in a standard sterling alloy less copper<br>
means unacceptably low hardness. If the copper content is reduced, the silver content<br>
may simply be increased which is a preferred option. Other possibilities include<br>
increasing the germanium content or adding zinc or another alloying element. Silver<br>
alloy of Ag 973 parts per thousand and containing about 1.0 wt% Ge, balance copper,<br>
has been successfully precipitation hardened by gradual air cooling from an annealing<br>
temperature, and it is believed that Ag-Cu-Ge alloys with silver content above this level<br>
are also precipitation hardenable. The copper in a master alloy may be adjusted<br>
according to the silver content.<br>
The benefit of not having to quench to achieve the hardening affect is a major<br>
advantage of silver alloys that can be made from the present master alloys. There are<br>
very few times in practical production that a silversmith can safely quench a piece of<br>
nearly finished work. The risk of distortion and damage to soldered joints when<br>
quenching from a high temperature would make the process not commercially viable. In<br>
fact standard sterling can also be precipitation hardened but only on subsequent<br>
quenching and this is one reason why precipitation hardening is not used for sterling<br>
silver.<br>
How the invention may be put into effect will now be further described, by way<br>
of illustration only, in the following Examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
A master alloy is made by melting together 79 wt% Cu, 18 wt% Ge and 3 wt%<br>
of a Cu/B alloy containing 2 wt% boron. The Cu is melted together with the Cu/B<br>
master alloy. High temperatures can be used because there are no other elements to<br>
damage. The temperature is then lowered and the germanium is added just above the Ge<br>
melting point. Melting is therefore in descending order of melting temperatures i.e.<br>
copper/copper-boron master alloy/germanium. The resulting master alloy comprises,<br>
apart from impurities, and with a 50% boron loss on melting, about 82 wt% Cu, about<br>
18 wt% Ge and about 0.03 wt% boron, together with any impurities.<br>
There is then added 72g of the above master alloy and 928 g of 9999 purity fine<br>
silver which when melted together just above the melting point of the fine silver (e.g. at<br>
about 960-1200°C) with a 50% boron loss gives the desired silver/copper/germanium<br>
ternary alloy of composition about 92.8 wt% Ag, 5.90 wt% Cu, 1.30 wt% Ge and about<br>
11 ppm boron. The master alloy is weighed and placed in a crucible for melting and the<br>
fine silver is weighed and placed in the crucible, which is then heated to melt the silver<br>
and the master alloy under a protective cover of natural gas to prevent unnecessary<br>
oxidation. Silver has a known affinity for oxygen, which affinity increases with<br>
temperature. When exposed to air, molten silver will absorb about twenty-two times its<br>
volume of oxygen. Like silver, copper also has a great affinity for oxygen, typically<br>
forming copper oxide. Thus, in forming or re-melting sterling silver and other silvercopper<br>
alloys, care must be taken to prevent oxidation. When the mixture becomes<br>
molten, it may be stirred e.g. with a carbon rod and poured through a tundish into water,<br>
so that the silver becomes solidified into shot-like granules or pellets of diameter about<br>
3-6 mm which is the form in which sterling silver is typically sold.<br>
The resulting alloy granules are used in investment casting using traditional<br>
methods and is cast at a temperature of 950-980°C and at a flask temperature of not<br>
more than 676°C under a protective atmosphere. The investment material which is of<br>
relatively low thermal conductivity provides for slow cooling of the cast pieces.<br>
Investment casting with air-cooling for 15-25 minutes followed by quenching of the<br>
investment flask in water after 15-25 minutes gives a cast piece having a Vickers<br>
hardness of about 70 which is approximately the same hardness as sterling silver. The<br>
products exhibit excellent tarnish and firestain resistance and have a fine grain structure<br>
due to their boron content. It has been found that a harder cast piece can be produced<br>
by allowing the flask to cool in air to room temperature, the piece when removed from<br>
the flask having a Vickers hardness of about 110. Contrary to experience with Sterling<br>
silver, where necessary, the hardness can be increased even further by precipitation<br>
hardening e.g. by placing castings or a whole tree in an oven set to about 300°C for 20-<br>
45 minutes to give heat-treated castings of approaching 125 Vickers. The germanium<br>
content is towards the upper limit of that presently considered desirable in a 0.925 type<br>
alloy.<br>
As an alternative, the master alloy and fine silver in the form of granules can be<br>
mixed together in a crucible, and poured straight into the investment mould, giving<br>
similar results to those described above.<br>
Example 2<br>
The fine silver granules and the master alloy of Example 1 in the proportions set<br>
out in that example are formed into sheet by continuously casting at 1150-1200°C.<br>
Pieces of the sheet are brazed together to form shaped articles by passage through a<br>
brazing furnace and are simultaneously annealed. Precipitation hardening develops<br>
without a quenching step by controlled gradual air-cooling in the downstream cooling<br>
region of the furnace. For this purpose, it is desirable that the material should spend at<br>
least about 8-30 minutes in the temperature range 200-300°C which is most favourable<br>
for precipitation hardening. Articles which have been brazed in a furnace in this way<br>
and gradually cooled can achieve hardness of 110-115 Vickers.<br>
Example 3<br>
A second master alloy is made by melting together 81.5 wt% Cu, 15.5 wt% Ge<br>
and 3 wt% of a Cu/B alloy containing 2 wt% boron. The resulting master alloy<br>
comprises, apart from impurities, and with a 50% boron loss on melting about 84.5 wt%<br>
Cu, about 15.5 wt% Ge and about 0.03 wt% boron, together with any impurities.<br>
There is then added 72g of the second master alloy and 928 g of 9999 silver<br>
which when melted together at about 960-1200°C with a 50% boron loss gives the<br>
desired silver/copper/germanium ternary alloy of composition about 92.8 wt % Ag, 6.08<br>
wt % Cu, 1.12 wt % Ge and about 11 ppm boron. The subsequent performance of the<br>
alloy is similar to that of Example 1. The germanium content is towards the lower limit<br>
of that presently considered desirable in a 0.925 type alloy.<br>
Example 4<br>
A master alloy is made by melting together copper and germanium in the<br>
proportions given in Example 1. The copper is melted by heating in a gas-fired fiirnace<br>
or an induction furnace to about 11509 under a charcoal melt cover which gives a<br>
reducing atmosphere. The germanium is added to the copper by wrapping pieces of the<br>
germanium in copper foil and plunging the wrapped germanium to the bottom of the<br>
melt using a graphite or plumbago stirring rod. When addition of the copper is complete<br>
the temperature is lowered to 1100°C, pellets of sodium borohydride to give 0.5 wt%<br>
boron are wrapped in copper foil and are plunged to the bottom of the melt using a<br>
graphite or plumbago stirring rod as described above. The sodium borohydride<br>
decomposes with evolution of hydrogen over a period of 1-2 minutes leaving boron and<br>
some sodium in the melt.<br>
After boron addition, the crucible is pivoted to permit the molten alloy to be<br>
poured into a tundish whose bottom is formed with very fine holes. The molten alloy<br>
pours into the tundish and runs through the holes in fine streams which break into fine<br>
pellets which iall into a stirred bath of water and become solidified and cooled. The<br>
cast pellets are removed from the bath and .dried to give a master alloy as casting grain.<br>
The above master alloy can be used in the manufacture of Ag-Cu-Ge alloys containing<br>
boron as melt refiner e.g. using the procedures of the preceding Examples. Dispersion<br>
of boron into the master alloy using the borohydride is very effective, and the resulting<br>
silver alloys can contain up to 20 ppm boron, or if desired above 20 ppm boron without<br>
development of hard spots.<br>
In particular, the procedure of the Example may be used to manufacture Ag-Cu-<br>
Ge casting grain for Sterling-type alloys containing about 40 ppm boron. Boron loss on<br>
re-melting reduces the boron content of the final cast alloy to 20 ppm or below, which is<br>
still an effective amount for grain refinement, and offers the possibility of producing<br>
cast, investment cast or other products having more consistent microstructure and<br>
properties.<br>
Example 5<br>
The procedure of Example 4 is repeated except that prior to addition of the<br>
boron, silicon is added in an amount that will impart to the intended final alloy 0.05 -<br>
0.2 wt% Si as incidental ingredient.<br>
Example 6<br>
A master alloy is made by melting together 56 wt% Cu, 28 wt% Ag, 13 wt% Ge<br>
and 3 wt% of a Cu/B alloy containing 2 wt% boron. The Cu (m.p. 1085°C) is melted<br>
together with the Cu/B master alloy. High temperatures can be used because there are<br>
no other elements to damage. The temperature is then lowered and the silver (m.p.<br>
962°C) is added followed by the germanium which is added just above the Ge melting<br>
point (m.p. 938°C). Melting is therefore in descending order of melting temperatures i.e.<br>
copper/copper-boron master alloy/silver/germanium. The resulting master alloy<br>
comprises about 0.03 wt% boron.<br>
There is then added lOOg of the above master alloy and 900 g of 9999 purity<br>
fine silver which when melted together just above the melting point of the fine silver<br>
(e.g. at about 960-1200°C) with a 50% boron loss gives the desired<br>
silver/copper/germanium ternary alloy of composition similar to that in Example 1.<br>
Addition of the master alloy to the fine silver is as described in Example 1, and it is<br>
formed as described in that example into alloy granules are used in investment casting<br>
as described in Example 1.<br>
Example 7<br>
A master alloy is made by melting together 59 wt% Cu, 28 wt% Ag and 13 wt%<br>
Ge. Sodium borohydride is then introduced into the alloy as described in Example 4 to<br>
give a boron content of about 1000-1100 ppm. The master alloy is used to make a<br>
Sterling grade jewellery or silversmithing alloy as described in Example 7.<br>
Example 8<br>
In a modification of the procedure in Example 7, the sodium borohydride is<br>
wrapped in silver foil and introduced into said master alloy.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
