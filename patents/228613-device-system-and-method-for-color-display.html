DEVICE. SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR COLOR DISPLAY<br>
Field Of The Invention<br>
The invention relates generally to color display devices, systems and methods and, more particularly, to display devices, systems and methods having improved color image reproduction capability.<br><br><br>
increasing steadily. A typical color LCD device is schematically illustrated in Fig. 2A. Such a device includes a light source 202, an array of liquid crystal (LC) elements (cells)<br><br>
Otlier than controlling the geometric arrangement of pixels, the '375 patent does not describe or suggest any visual interaction between the three primary colors and the fourth color in the repetitive sequences.<br><br>
LCDs are used in various applications. LCDs are particularly common in portable devices, for example, the small size displays of PDA devices, game consoles and mobile telephones, and the medium size displays of laptop ("notebook") computers. These applications require than and miniaturized designs and low power consumption. However, LCD technology is also used in non-portable devices, generally requiring larger display sizes, for example, desktop computer displays and TV sets. Different LCD applications may require different LCD designs to achieve optimal results. The more "traditional" markets for LCD devices, e.g., the markets of battery-operated devices (e.g., PDA, cellular phones and laptop computers) require LCDs with high brightness efficiency, which leads to reduced power consumption. In desktop computer displays, high resolution, image quality and color richness are the primary considerations, and low power consumption is only a secondary consideration. Laptop computer displays require both high resolution and low power consumption; however, picture quality and color richness are compromised in many such devices. In TV display applications, picture quality and color richness are generally the most important considerations; power consumption and high resolution are secondary considerations in such devices.<br>
Typically, the light source providing back-illumination to LCD devices is a Cold Cathode Fluorescent Light (CCFL). Fig. 3 schematically illustrates typical spectra of a CCFL, as is known in the art. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the light source spectra include three, relatively narrow, dominant wavelength ranges, corresponding to red, green and blue light, respectively. Other suitable light sources, as are known in the art, may alternatively, be used. The RGB filters in the filter sub-pixel array are typically designed to reproduce a sufficiently wide color gamut (e.g., as close as possible to the color gamut of a corresponding CRT monitor), but also to maximize the display efficiency, e.g., by selecting filters whose transmission curves generally overlap the CCFL spectra peaks in Fig. 3. In general, for a given source brightness, filters with narrower transmission spectra provide a wider color gamut but a reduced display brightness, and vice versa. For example, in applications where power efficiency is a critical consideration, color gamut width may often be sacrificed. In certain TV applications, brightness is an inipoitant consideration; however, dull colors are not acceptable.<br><br>
Fig. 4A schematically illustrates typical RGB filter spectra of existing laptop computer displays. Fig. 4B schematically illustrates a chromaticity diagram representing the reproducible color gamut of the typical laptop spectra (dashed-triangular area in Fig. 4B), as compared with an ideal NTSC color gamut (dotted triangular area in Fig. 4B). As shown in Fig, 4B, the NTSC color gamut is significantly wider than the color gamut of the typical laptop computer display and therefore, many color combinations included in the NTSC gamut are not reproducible by the typical color laptop computer display.<br>
Summary Of The Invention<br>
Many colors seen by humans are not discernible on standard red-green-blue (RGB) monitors. By using a display device with more than three primary colors, the reproducible color gamut of the display is expanded. Additionally or alternatively, the brightness level produced by the display may be significantly increased. Embodiments of the present invention provide systems and methods of displaying color images on a display device, for example, a thin profile display device, such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) device, using more than three primary colors.<br>
An aspect of the invention provides improved multi-primary display devices using more than three sub-pixels of different colors to create each pixel. In embodiments of this .aspect of the invention, the use of four to six (or more) different color sub-pixels, per pixel, allows for a wider color gamut and higher luminous efficiency. In some embodiments, the number of sub-pixels per pixel and the color spectra of the different sub-pixels may be optimized to obtain a desired combination of a sufficiently wide color gamut, sufficiently high brightness, and sufficiently high contrast.<br>
- In some embodiments of the invention, the use of more than three primary colors may expand the reproducible color gamut of the display by enabling the use of relatively narrow wavelength ranges for some of the primary colors, e,g,, red, green and blue, thus increasing the saturation of those primary colors. To compensate for a potentially reduced brightness level from such narrower ranges, in some embodiments of the invention, broad wavelength range primary colors, e.g., specifically designed yellow and/or cyan, may be used in addition to the narrow wavelength range colors, thus increasing the overall brightness of the display. In further embodiments of the invention, additional primary colors (e.g., magenta) and/or different primary color spectra may be<br><br><br><br>

For each sub-pixel there is a corresponding cell in LC array 214. Back-illumination source 212 provides the light needed to produce the color images. The transmittance of each of the sub-pixels is controlled by the voltage applied to a corresponding LC cell of array 214, based on the image data input for the corresponding pixel. An n-primaries controller 218 receives the input data, e.g., in RGB or YCC format, optionally scales the data to a desired size and resolution, and adjusts the magnitude of the signal delivered to the different drivers based on the input data for each pixel. The intensity of white light provided by back-illumination source 212 is spatially modulated by elements of the LC array, selectively controlling the illumination of each sub-pixel according to the image data for the sub-pixel. the selectively attenuated light of each sub-pixel passes through a corresponding color filter of color filter array 216, thereby producing desired color sub-pixel combinations. The human<br><br>
vision system spatially integrates the light filtered through the different color sub-pixels to perceive a color image.<br>
The color gamut and other attributes of LCD devices m accordance with embodiments of the invention may be controlled by a number of parameters. these parameters mclude: the spectra of the back illumination element (light source), for example a Cold Cathode Fluorescent Light (CCFL); the spectal transmission of the LC cells in the LC array; and the spectral transmission of the color filters. In a 3-primaries display, the first two parameters, namely, the spectra of the light source and the spectral transmission of the LC cell, are typically dictated by system constraints and, therefore, the colors for the filters may be selected straightforwardly to provide the required colorimetric values at the "comers" of the desired RGB triangle, as shown in Fig. lA. To maximize the efficiency of 3-prnaries LCD devices, the spectral transmissions of the filters are designed to substantially overlap, to the extent possible, with the wavelength peaks of the light source. The filters selection in 3-primary LCD devices may be based primarily on maximizing the overall brightness efficiency. In this context, it should be noted that selectmg filters having narrower spectral transmission curves, which result in more saturated primary colors, generally decreases the over-all brightness level of the display.<br>
For a multi-primary display with more than three primary colors, in accordance with embodiments of the invention, an infinite number of filter combinations can be selected to substantially overlap a required color gamut. The filter selection method of the invention may mclude optmiizing the filter selection according to the following requirements: establishing sufficient coverage of a desired two-dimensional color gamut, for example, the NTSC standard gamut for wide-gamut applications and a "conventional" 3-color LCD gamut for higher brightness applications; maximizing the brightness level of a balanced white point that can be obtained from combining all the primary colors; and adjusting the relative intensities of the primary colors in accordance with a desired illumination standard, e.g., the D65 white point chromatzcity standard of High Definition TV (HDTV) systems.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention provide systems and methods of displaying color images on a display device, for example, a thin profile display device, such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) device, using more than three primary colors. A<br><br>
number of embodiments of the invention are described herein in the context of an LCD device with more than three primary colors; wherein the number of color filters used per pixel is greater than three. This arrangement has several advantages in comparison to conventional RGB display devices. First, the n-primary display device in accordance with the invention enables expansion of the color gamut covered by the display. Second, the device in accordance with the invention enables a significant increase in the luminous efficiency of the display; in some cases, an increase of about 50 percent or higher may be achieved, as discussed below. This feature of the invention is particularly advantageous for portable (e.g., battery-operated) display devices, because increased luminous efficiency extends the battery life and overall weight of such devices. third, a device in accordance with the invention enables improved graphics resolution by efficient utilization of a sub-pixel rendering technique of the present invention, as described in detail below with reference to specific embodiments of the invention.<br>
In some multi-primary display devices in accordance with embodunents of the invention, more than three sub-pixels of different colors are used to create each pixel. In embodiments of the invention, the use of four to six (or more) different color sub-pixels, per pixel, allows for a wider color gamut and higher luminous efficiency. In some embodiments, the number of sub-pixels per pixel and the transmittance spectrum of die different sub-pixel filters may be optimized to obtain a desired combination of a sufficiently wide color gamut, sufficiently high brightness, and sufficiently high contrast.<br>
For example, the use of more than three primaries in accordance with an embodiment of the invention may enable expansion of the reproducible color gamut by enabling, the use of filters with. nan-ower transmission curves (e.g., narrower effective transmission ranges) for the R, G and B color filters and, thus, increasing the saturation of the R, G and B sub-pixels. To compensate for such narrower ranges, m some embodiments of the invention, broader band sub-pixel filters may be used in addition to the RGB saturated colors, thus increasing the overall brightness of the display. In accordance with embodunents of the invention, an optimal combination of color gamut width and over-all picture brightness can be achieved, to meet the requirements of a given system, by appropriately designing the sub-pixel filters of the n-primary display and the filter arrangement.<br><br>
Figs! 5A and 6A schematically illustrate transmission curves for two, respective, alternative designs of a five-primary display device in accordance with embodiments of<br><br>
3-color LCD. In this embodiment, the over-all brightness level of the 5-color LCD device is similar to that of a 3-color LCD device having a much nari'ower color gamut.<br><br>
The white point coordinates for this embodiment, as calculated from the transmission spectra and the back-illumination spectra using methods known in the known art, are x=0.310; y=0.343. Other designs may be used in embodiments of the invention, including tlie use of different primaiies and/or additional primaiies (e.g., 6 color<br><br>

The sub-gamut regions in Fig. 15 represent approximated boundaries from which primary colors may be selected to provide large gamut coverage and/or high brightness levels, while maintaining a desned white point balance, in accordance with embodiments of the invention. The positions of the primary<br><br><br><br><br><br>
To determine the smallest super-pixel structure that meets the above requirements, the number of n-primary pixels lengthwise or widthwise in each super-pixel is set to a value of one, for example, NL= I, whereby the aspect ratio of the multi-primary pixel is given by m2/3n. Therefore, the smallest super-pixel structure would be obtained for a value of m whereby m2 divided by 3n is as close as possible to<br><br>
a 5-primaries display system in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. In this 5-primaries configuration, wherein, for example, the primaries are RGB, cyan (C) and<br><br><br><br>
2001. Optionally, following the up scaling, re-sampling may be performed in two stages, to simplify computation, as follows. In a first stage, data is allocated for each of the super-pixels. In a second stage, re-sampling is performed at the super-pixel level, based on the Icnown structure of the super-pixels. After the data is re-sampled to an n-primary pixel grid, which may be defined, for example, by the color-weighted centers of each of the n-primary pixels, a set of n-primary coefficients may be computed for each of the n-primary pixels by an n-primary converter 1104. The n-primary data for all, e.g., m, n-primary pixels making-up each of the super-pixels is combined by a super-pixel collector 1106, and the collected data is received by a distributor 1108, which distributes the in*n coefficients of the m n-primary pixels to the sub-pixels according to the defined internal arrangement.<br>
In a 6-primaries display system according to an embodiment of the invention, one possible configuration may include a super-pixel arrangement essentially analogous to the 5-primaries super-pixel arrangement described above with reference to Figs. 9, with appropriate changes, e.g., adding a magenta sub-pixel element to each pixel of the super-pixel structure. A system for producing 6-primary images in accordance with this embodiment, and the flow of data in such a system, may be substantially as described above with reference to Fig. 11. As illustrated schematically in Fig. 10, a super-pixel structure with n==6 and m=4 has a length 4/3 that of a 3-primary pixel, and a width of 3 pixels. The total number of sub-pixels in this super-pixel structure is thus 4/3x3x3 = 12, whereby two 6-primary pixels are accommodated by each super-pixel, as illustrated schematically by the shadowed area in Fig. 10. The average length of this 6-primary pixel is 4/3 and its width is 3/2 and thus the super-pixel aspect ratio in this embodiment is 8:9, which is relatively close to the desired 1:1 ratio.<br>
Other configurations may also be used in accordance with embodiments of the invention; for example, the six sub-pixels may be arranged in two rows of three sub-pixels each. In this two-row arrangement, the resolution of a standard XGA display adapted to operate in a six-primaries mode according to the invention is reduced 1024 x 384 pixels, and the resolution of a standard SXGA display operating m the 6-primaries mode is reduced to 1280 x 512. Such a configuration of pixels may be useful for TV and video applications as described below.<br><br>
The above examples demonstrate that an increase in the number of different color filters, e.g., 4-6 different colors instead of 3, without appropriate modification of the LC an-ay, may reduce the apparent resolution of the display. However, for TV and video applications this reduction in apparent resolution may not be crucial. Standard definition NTSC TV systems have a resolution of 480 lines (effectively 525 lines with blanldng lines) at an interlaced field rate of 60 Hz (frame rate of 30 Hz). When digitized, the resolution of NTSC systems varies within the range of 960 x 480 to 352 x 480. PAL systems have a resolution of 576 TV lies at an mterlaced field rate of 50 Hz (firame rate of 25 Hz). In digital form, the resolution of PAL systems varies within the range of 1024 X 576 to 480 X 576, depending on the aspect ratio (e.g., 4:3 or 16:9) and on the shape (e.g., rectangular or square) of the pixels. Therefore, in accordance with embodiments of the invention, existing SXGA displays can be converted into four-, five- or six-primaries display systems, as described above, that display standard definition TV images without any degradation in image resolution, because the reduced resolution of such converted devices is still higher than the resolution of standard TV image data. It should be noted that in all the cases described above, where the resolution is reduced horizontally, and in the case of five- and six-primaries where the resolution is reduced vertically, the resolution of converted display systems in accordance with embodiments of the invention are compatible with (or exceed) the resolution of NTSC systems (480 lines) and are at least very close to the resolution of PAL systems (576 lines). In certain cases where an XGA display is converted to operate as a 4-6 primary display', some resolution may be lost; however, a sophisticated arrangement of the sub-pixels within each pixel, as described below, can be used to compensate for the slightly decreased resolution. Thus will be apparent to a person skilled in the art that many existing types of 3-color LCD devices can be converted into more-than-three-primary displays, according to embodiments of the invention, capable of displaying TV standard images with no effective reduction in resolution. Other resolutions, number of primaries and pixel arrangements may be used in accordance with embodiments of the invention.<br>
In various applications, especially in mixed video and computer graphics applications, any loss of resolution should preferably be avoided. For pixels with six sub-pixelsarranged in two rows, as described above, special arrangement of the different sub-pixel colors can be implemented to improve the display resolution. An example of<br><br><br>
and the gamut of the CMY primaries spans the solid triangle. The shadowed hexagonal area in Fig. 13A represents the conjunctive gamut of both the CMY and RGB primary sets. A first mode of operation of this display is a high resolution, "limited gamuf mode, which is suitable, inter alia, for graphics applications. In this mode, the resolution can be the same as that of a corresponding 3-primary display (e.g. 1280 x 1024 pixels for<br><br><br>
black-and-white graphics, for example, using a SXGA display, yielding an effective resolution of 3840 x 1024 pixels, instead of the original 1280 x 1024 resolution. The arrangement and handling of the pixels for this mode of operation may be as in the high resol tion, "limited gamut" mode described above. Additional modes of operation are<br><br>
also possible m accordance with embodiments of the invention; such additional modes may be designed in accordance with specific display requirements.<br>
Fig. 13B schematically illustrates possible data flow schemes for a 6-primary display system in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the invention, using RGB-CMY primary color sets as described above. In this example, the resolution of the mput data is assumed to be at the original resolution of the display; otherwise, appropriate scaling may be required as described above. A pixel collector 1302 collects image data corresponding to a pair of three-priraary pixels, namely, a RGB pixel and a CMY pixel, which together form a single 6-primary pixel. The original image data may be provided in any suitable format known in the art, for example, RGB or YCC format. Using matrix multiplication units 1304 and 1306 and, subsequently, an n-primary combiner 1308, the collected data of the two three-color pixels is converted mto gray-scale values for the different sub-pixels. If the color values of both pixels fall within the shadowed hexagonal area in Fig. 13A, e.g., if all the sub-pixels have positive gray scale values, then the gray levels used to drive the respective LC sub-pixels are unchanged.<br>
Referring to Fig. 13A, when the input data falls outside the CMY triangle but within the RGB triangle, the data may be handled in a number of different manners, depending on the specific application. In one embodiment, the data is represented only by the RGB sub-pixel component, and the CMY component is set to zero illumination. In another embodiment, the input data is represented by the RGB component, and the CMY component represents the color combination nearest the desired color. For the purpose of this embodiment of the invention, the "nearest" color combination may be defined in terms of brighmess, chromaticity, or simply by setting any negative sub-pixel values to zero. In a further embodiment, the CMY component represents the color combination nearest as possible to the desired color, and any difference between the desired color and the CMY representation is con'ected by the RGB component. The three different embodiments discussed above differ mainly in the method of presenting saturated colors. In the first embodiment, saturated colors are reproduced accurately, from colorimetric point of view, but at a relatively low brightness level. In the second embodiment, the brightness level is maximized, but saturation is decreased. In the third embodiment, the saturation and brightness level fall within the range in between the<br><br>
maximum and minimuin levels of the first and second embodiments. It should be appreciated that, by transposing the references to CMY and RGB, respectively, in the above analysis, the same analysis applies to a situation in which the input data falls outside the RGB triangle but within the CMY triangle in Fig. 13 A.<br>
Referring to Fig. 13 A, it should be noted that any color combination within the 6-color gamut (the peripheral dotted hexagon) that falls outside the "star of David" shape formed by the conjoined triangular areas of the RGB gamut and CMY gamut, can be reproduced accurately only by the full six-primary pixel representation. In an embodiment of the invention, an algorithm using two-dimensional look-up-tables ("LUTs"), as described in Applicants' pending International Application PCT/IL02/00410, filed May 23, 2002, entitled "System and method of data conversion for wide gamut displays", the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, may be applied to derive the correct sub-pixel values for all six primaries in real time. In this embodiment of the invention, the average color of the RGB and the CMY combinations may be calculated, and the resulting color may be transformed, e.g., using a six-primary converter, to produce the sub-pixel coefficients of the corresponding n-primary pixel.<br>
The systems and methods described above are suitable for display devices in which colors are perceived by spatial integration of the sub-pixels by the human vision system. However, color integration by the human vision system can also be performed temporally and, therefore, embodiments of the present invention also provide sequential display devices, systems and methods, for example, sequential color LCD devices, using more than three primary colors. This concept is described m detail, in the context of sequenctial n-primary color image projection devices, in Applicants' International Application PCT/ILOl/00527, entitled "Device, System and Method For Electronic True Color Display", filed June 7, 2001, and published December 13, 2001 as WO 01/95544, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. In sequential projection color displays devices, four or more different color fields are projected sequentially, each for a short time period, and the process is repeated periodically at a sufficiently high frequency, whereby the human vision system temporally integrates the different color fields into a full color image.<br><br>
An advantage of LCD devices based on sequential color representation, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, is that such devices can display more-than-three-primary color images at a resolution comparable to the resolution at which the same devices can display tlu'ee-primary-color, e.g., RGB, images. Sequential LCD display devices do not require a color sub-pixel filter matrix in registry with the LCarray. Instead, each LC element controls the intensity of all the primary colors for a given pixel, each primary color being conti'olled during designated time slots, whereby the LC array is utilized-to its full resolution. Color combinations are created by sequentially back-illuminating the LC array with different primary colors, in analogy to sequential projection devices. However, in contrast to projection devices, which typically require significant physical space to contain the projection optics, namely, the optical setup that projects a miniature spatial light modulator onto a screen, the sequential LCD device of the present invention does not require projection optics and may, thus, be implemented in flat configui-ations.<br>
the architecture of a flat n-primaiies display according to an embodiment of the present invention includes an LC array (panel) having a desired size and resolution. Such LCD panels are used, for example, in portable computers as are known in the ail. However, in the sequential LCD defaces of the present invention, the LC panel may be used without an adjacent array of color sub-pixel filters, whereby the LC array may operate as a monochromatic gray level device. The. cells of the LC an*ay are selectively attenuated to produce a. series of more-than-three primary gray-level patterns, each pattern corresponding to one of more-than-three primary color components of the displayed image. Each gray-level pattern is back-illuminated with light of the corresponding primary color. Switching among the different back-illuminations colors is synchronized with the sequence of gray-level patterns produced by the LC array, whereby each gray level pattern in the sequence is illuminated with light of the correct primary color. The light for the desired back-illumination may be produced by filtering white light (or other color light) through pre-selected color filters, each filter corresponding to one of the more-than-three primary colors. The back-illumination color sequence is repeated at a sufficiently high frequency, synchronized with the periodic sequence of pattems produced by the LC array, whereby the viewer perceives a full color image by temporal integration of the as described above.<br><br>
Parts of a sequential LCD device in accordance with an embodiment of the invention are schematically illustrated in Fig, 14. It should be appreciated that the sequential color LCD devices described herein illustrate only an exemplary embodiment of the invention. In alternate embodiments of the invention, other systems and methods may be used to create the different colors of back-illumination light. Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments of the invention, instead of using an LC array as described above,other methods known in the art may be used to sequentially produce the gray level patterns corresponding to the different primary color components.<br>
In one enrbodiment of the invention, illustrated schematically in Fig. 14, the different illumination colors are produced sequentially, using a single light source, or a set of light sources, for example, a white light source 1410, by sequentially filtermg the white light through a series of different color fdters 1413. The color filters may be placed on a rotating filter wheel 1412. To obtain the desired back-illumination, the colored light passing through one of color filters 1413 on filter wheel 1412 may be focused, e.g., using a lens 1414, into a light guide 1416. The light guide funnels the filtered hght to a back-illumination arrangement 1422 juxtaposed an LC array 1420, as known in the art, illuminating the LC array substantially uniformly. In some variations of this embodiment, the back-illumination arrangement and light guide are similar to those used in back-illuminated portable computers, e.g., laptop computers, or in light-table devices. In some such devices, light from fluorescent light bulbs is reflected by an arrangement of reflectors/diffusers to obtain substantially uniform illummation. Alternatively, as shown schematically in Fig. 14, the light funnel 1416 may mclude multiple light exits 1418 that may be used in conjunction with reflectors/diffusers in back-illumination arangement 1422 to obtain uniform illumination. In alternate embodiments other structures may be used to provide back-illumination of different primary colors.<br>
In alternate embodiments of the invention, the back-illumination is generated by an array of Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs), each LED capable of selectively producing light at one of more than three different wavelength ranges. The different color LED emissions are activated sequentially, and the color sequence is synchronized with the sequence of gray-level patterns produced by the LC array. la a three-primary, e.g., RGB, device using LED back-illumination, in order to obtain a sufficiently wide color gamut,<br><br>
the red, green and blue LED emissions are typically designed to have narrow respective spectra. In particular, the peak of the emission distribution of such devices is typically in the range of 630-680 nm for the red emission, 500-540 nm for the green emission, and 400-480 nm for the blue emission. Unfortunately, existmg three-color devices do not utilize the brightness-efficient wavelength range of 540-570 mn, perceived as orange-yellow light, at which wavelength range the human eye is most sensitive. Therefore, adding a fourth LED emission in the range of 540-570 nm, in accordance with embodiments of the invention, can significantly improve the brightness efficiency. Assuming that the quantum efficiency of all diodes is substantially the same, a yellow LED would produce more visual brightness per Ampere. To talce advantage of this efficiency, by activating the four LED emission ranges described above, in some embodiments of the invention, at least four primary colors, namely, red, green, blue and yellow-orange, are used.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the invention, instead of using a fourth emission range, an array of standard RGB LEDs may be activated in accordance with an activation sequence that produces a higher intensity of the desired back-illumination sequence, Instead of the standard activation sequence of R-G-B-R-G-B, some embodiments of the invention use a hybrid periodic activation sequence, for example, R-G-B-RG-BG-RB, to produce the desired back-illumination sequence. Other activation sequences of the RGB LED emissions are also possible, for example, sequences mcluding the same emission components (e.g., R, G, B, RG, BG and RB) arranged in different orders, sequences in which some of the "mixed" components (e.g., RG, BG, or RB) are omitted, sequences including additional components (e.g., a full RGB emission component), or any other suitable combinations of "pure" and/or "mixed" LED emissions capable of produce the desired back-illumination sequence. It should be appreciated that the over-all brightness level produced by the exemplary activation sequence of R-G-B-RG-BG-RB, determined by the smn 3R+3G+3B, is about 50 percent higher than the average brightness produced by a corresponding standard R-G-B-R-G-B sequence, determined by the sum 2R-I-2G+2B.<br>
The sequential LCD device in accordance with embodiments of the invention is activated at a sufficiently high frequency to enable a viewer to temporally integrate the sequence of n-primary images into a full color image. Additionally, to produce a video<br><br>
image, the sequential LCD device in accordance with embodiments of the invention is activated at a sufficiently high rate to enable reproduction of the required number of frames per second. A sequential color LCD device that operates at a sufficiently fast rate, using back-illumination of three primary colors, namely, red, green a blue light, is described in Ken-ichi Takatori, Hiroshi Imai, Hideld Asada and Masao Imai, "Field-Sequential Smectic LCD with TFT Pixel Amplifier", Functional Devices Research Labs, NEC Corp., Kawasaki, Kanagawa 216-8555, Japan, SID 01 Digest, incorporated herein by reference. In an embodiment of the present invention, a version of this three-color device is adapted to produce n-primary color images, wherein n is greater than three. In such n-primary n-adapted sequential illumination device, light generated by a (preferably) white light source is filtered through n, sequentially interposed, color filters, to produce the desired sequence of n-primary color back-illumination. A filter switching mechanism, for example, a rotating filter wheel including more than three different color filters, such as the filter wheel described above with reference to Fig. 14, may be used to sequentially interpose the different color filters in light path of the back-illumination. An arrangement similar to that used in existmg laptop computers may be used to funnel and diffuse the filtered light illuminating the LC array. In some embodiments, the light source and filter switching mechanism (or, alternatively, the array of LEDs described above) are housed in an external device, and a light guide is used to funnel colored light into the back-illumination arrangement of the LCD device, as described above with reference to the embodiment of Fig. 14.<br>
