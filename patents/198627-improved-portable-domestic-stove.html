				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a portable domestic stove particuiariy meant for burning firewood.<br>
The advantage of using a grate positioned spaced above the bottom of the stove is well known. This provides an additional path for air and aids in me full combustion of the biomass besides providing a convenient route for clearing me residues of combustion particularly the ash. Immovable stoves particularly meant for burning firewood have been constructed and are popular. In them the additional air entry for the grate is through a tunnel provided below and parallel to the platform for keeping me sticks of firewood. The ash is also drawn out through this horizontal tunnel. This horizontal tunnel frequently gets blocked by die ashes and other fuel residues thereby interfering whh the air flow and the arrangement inconvenient even for large immovable stoves is too complicated for use in small portable stoves.<br>
Portable stoves with a grate mat are so far available have been designed to bum coal or other such short bits of solid fuel and as such do not have a platform outside the cavity of the stove for resting the long sticks of fire wood. Sticks of firewood when kept in the conventional portable stoves would rail down when their tips have been burnt The burning tip of the firewood that has fallen out from the firebox would soon get extinguished and considerable effort is required to rekindle the same when it is manually repositioned. This adds to the inefficiency of the stove. Though the difficulty has been experienced by many for centuries no attempt has so far been made to rectify the defect The object of this invention is to provide an efficient portable domestic stove particularly meant for burning sticks of firewood employing the grate mechanism. It is also another object of mis invention to provide a means whereby the sticks of firewood would spontaneously slide into the cavity of the stove when their tips have been burnt A further object of this invention is to provide a simple means of ash collection and removal by doing away with the existing horizontal tunnel for drawing off the ash of present day immovable firewood burning stoves.<br>
Accordingly this invention provides an improved portable domestic stove for burning firewood comprising a grate (G) and a stove body (B) housing a cavity (C) having at least one mouth (M) at the top for keeping the cooking utensil to be heated, means provided for holding the grate (G) within the cavity (C) of the stove above and positioned spaced from the bottom of the said cavity, said cavity above the grate opening to the exterior at the side of the stove through the firebox entrance (D), means for air entry to the underside of the grate being provided, characterized in that said stove body has a raised platform (F) leading to the cavity of the stove above the grate through the firebox entrance (D), said platform extending outwards from the said firebox entrance, for resting the sticks of firewood to be burnt<br><br>
If the platform (F) is inclined downwards towards the firebox entrance (D) from its outer end the sticks of firewood would spontaneously slide into the cavity of the stove when their tips have been burnt So as to enable easy ash collection and removal the invention proposes a stove body with an open bottom for its cavity (C). By simply lifting up the stove body the ash collected in a tray can be removed In the absence of a tray the portable stove can be placed in a fresh place and reused.<br>
The invention will be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein: Fig.l: is a plan view of the stove according to the invention; Fig.2: is the sectional elevation of the stove taken in the plane X-X shown in Fig.l.<br>
As shown in the figures the portable domestic stove according to the invention comprises a stove body B housing a cavity C having at least one mourn M at the top for keeping the cooking utensil to be heated, means provided for holding a grate G within the cavity C of the stove above and positioned spaced from the bottom of the said cavity, said cavity above the grate opening to the exterior at the side of the stove through the fire box entrance D, means for air entry to the underside of the grate (openings such as V on the side wall of the stove) being provided, said stove body having a raised platform F leading to the cavity of die stove through the firebox entrance D, said platform extending outwards beyond 7.5 cm from the firebox entrance D, for resting the sticks of firewood to be burnt The mouth M of the stove is provided with projections P for enabling the air to pass out under the cooking utensil. The downward extension L of the said platform provides a seating means for the said stove body. The teg or downward extension L is preferably provided towards the outer end of said platform. This seating means under the said platform would prevent toppling of the stove when long sticks of wood are placed on die stove. The provision of the platform F would make the stove a bit oblong and large sized for transportation and this might have prevented the persons skilled in the art from designing such portable stoves in the past. But the provision of the platform enables the full utilization of the grate mechanism for burning firewood as the sticks of firewood can be kept on the platform on a level with or at a higher level man the grate. The tips of the fire wood sticks would men remain within or close to the firebox even after they have been burnt and are therefore likely to remain un-extinguished.<br>
The stove body has an open bottom for its cavity C. The portable stove after use in one place can be lifted up and placed in another place and reused. The ashes falling down through the grate would then be deposited in the first position and would not interfere with the airflow in the second position of the stove. These stoves with an open bottom are also easier to mould and it is<br><br>
also easy to remove an ashtray kept under die grate of these stoves by simply lifting up the stove body.<br>
The platform F is inclined downwards towards die firebox entrance D from its outer end. This would enable die sticks of firewood to slide into die cavity C of die stove as tbeir tips are being burnt In some stoves die moitfh M and firebox entrance D together form a common opening. As for existing stoves die mourn M can be closed by a metal plate and means provided for conducting the smoke away frora the cavity of the stove through another opening on the stove body and a chimney pipe can be provided on die said opening for sucking up the smoke. A tray is usually provided for collecting die ash falling down through die grate, said tray being usually dimensioned to be contained witfiin die cavity C of die stove body. By lifting up die stove foody die ashtray can be taken out, cleaned and replaced, me procedure being quite effortless.<br><br><br>
I claim:<br>

the stove above and positioned spaced from the bottom of the said cavity, said cavity above the<br>
grate opening to the exterior at the side of the stove through die firebox entrance (D), means for<br>
air entry to the underside of the grate being provided, characterized in that said stove body has a<br>
raised platform (F) leading to me cavity of the stove above the grate through the firebox entrance<br>
(D), said platform extending outwards from the said firebox entrance, for resting the sticks of<br>
firewood to be burnt.<br>
