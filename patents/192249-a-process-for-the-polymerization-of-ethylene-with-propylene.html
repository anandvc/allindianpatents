process for the polvmerizatlon of ethylene/using a The present invention relates to a/ catalytic<br>
component based on Vanadium supported on an inert solid<br>
matrix, which can be used in the production of ethylene<br>
propylene (EP) elastomers and ethylene propylene diene<br>
(EPDM) terpolymers in processes of the heterogeneous<br>
type as the suspension or the gas phase, preferably in<br>
suspension.<br>
Elastomers which can be obtained using the cata¬lytic component of the present invention are character¬ized by a better morphology and the polymerization process is characterized by a substantial absence or large reduction in the fouling of the reactor.<br>
The first document which describes supported catalysts based on Vanadium, useful for the preparation of EP elastomers, is GB-A-1.309.303. Elastomeric polymers are produced in a liquid medium consisting of one of the monomers and in the presence of a supported<br><br>
catalyst of the Ziegler-Natta type comprising a halide of a metal belonging to groups IVB, VB, VIE and an organometallic compound.<br>
GB-A-2.105.355 describes the use of supported catalysts based on Vanadium in the preparation of EP elastomers in gas phase. The support is selected from inorganic oxides and mixed oxides such as silica, alumina, Magnesium oxide, Titanium oxide and aluminium silicates; carbon black; zeolites; silicon carbide; minerals containing magnesium, aluminium and silicon, such as talc,and kaolin. The above inert support is impregnated with an Aluminium alkyl, preferably chlori¬nated, and an oleosoluble compound of Vanadium (III) or (V). The molar ratio Al/V is between 10/1 and 200/1, preferably between 20/1 and 60/1.<br>
US-A-5.002.916 describes a catalytic component supported on an inert matrix, represented by the formula:<br><br>
R is cclected from alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl and haloaJ-kyl;<br>
ED is an electron donor selected from alkyl and aromat¬ic carboxylic acids, esters, ketones, amines and alcohols; X is selected from chloride, bromide, fluoride and RCO2.<br><br>
The solutions proposed in both the English and American documents however have some disadvantages.<br>
In fact for the solution proposed by GB'355 both the Aluminium and the Vanadium necessary for the polymerization are totally deposited on the inert support. In other words, the supported catalyst de¬scribed in the English patent is not a catalytic component, but a real catalyst which excludes the use of other cocatalysts. In addition the solution proposed in this document can only be used in polymerization in gas phase, not in a liquid one.<br>
As far as the supported catalytic component described in US-A-5.002.916 is concerned, this relates to a component which uses particularly valuable raw materials, requires a particularly difficult prepara¬tion process and in addition the elastomeric composi¬tions which can be obtained have the inconvenience of having a certain degree of crystallinity.<br>
A catalytic component for the preparation of EP elastomers has now been found which overcomes the above disadvantages.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the polymerization of ethylene with propylene and optionally with another diene such as herein described, said process being carried out in a suspension of a liquid monomer of propylene saturated with ethylene, in the presence of a catalyst containing Vanadium and a cocatalyst basically consisting of an organic compound of Aluminium and optionally in the presence of a halogenated promotor, characterized in that the catalyst containing Vanadium is supported on an inert matrix such as herein described and is prepared by:<br>
a)	impregnation of the said inert matrix such as herein described with a solution, in hydrocarbons or halofaydrocarbons, of a Vanadium compound with an oxidation state of between 3 and 3;<br>
b)	optional removal of the solvent used in step (a), from the impregnated support obtained in step (a),<br>
c)	treatment of the inert material impregnated with Vanadium of step a.   or (b), with a hydrocarbon solution of a compound having<br>
general formula (I) RoAlXm wherein R is a CfC^o alkyl radical, X is a halogen, n + m = 3, and m is an integer from 0 to 2, the above step (c) being carried out in an inert atmosphere, preferably in an atmosphere of ethylene or alpha-olefins, the molar ration between Aluminium of step (c) and Vanadium of step (a) being between 1/1 and 6/1;<br>
d)	optional separation and purification of the catalyst containing Vanadium obtained in step (c),-<br>
e)	using the said catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene with propylene to produce the said ethylene-propylene elastomers.<br>
The term inert matrix refers to inorganic oxides	<br><br>
and mixed oxides such as silica, alumina. Magnesium oxide. Titanium oxide and aluminium silicates; carbon black; zeolites; silicon carbide; minerals containing magnesium, aluminium and silicon, such as talc and kaolin alumina, Magnesium oxide. The term inert matrix also refers to inert polymeric supports, such as stryrene-divinylbenzene copolymer.<br>
The above inert supports preferably have an average diameter of between 5 and 400 /i, preferably between 10 and 120 fi; in fact it may be difficult to transport and suspend very large particles in the solvent whereas, on the other hand, it may be difficult to recover very fine particles.<br>
Tne inert support has a sufficient quantity of sites on the surface to fix the catalyst by complexa-tion or chemical bond. It is preferable for the inert support to have a high surface area and porosity which allow free access of the reagents to the catalytic sites. Surface areas of between 10 and 1000 m^/q and a porosity of between 0.1 and 4 ml/g are therefore prefeiabl
In the preferred form of einbodiment, the inert matrix is selected from alumina and silica, silica is even more preferable.<br><br>
It is well known that inorganic oxides can contain water absorbed on the surface. As water is poisoning for the catalyst, it is necessary to subject the inert support to thermal treatment to reduce the content of water to very low levels, usually less than 2000 ppm, preferably less than 1000 ppm. In addition it is also preferable to eliminate traces of Oxygen from the pores of the support, for example by evacuating and pressur¬izing the above support various times with a dry inert gas, for example nitrogen or ethylene itself.<br>
In step (a) the Vanadium compound is dissolved in a solvent selected from hydrocarbons and halohydrocar-bons; typical examples of hydrocarbon solvents are toluene, benzene, heptane; typical examples of halo-hydrocarbons are dichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride, tri or tetrachloroethane. Other solvents or co-sol¬vents, for example ethers, however can also be used, provided that the quantity does not jeopardize the solubility of the Vanadium compound.<br>
In the preferred form of embodiment the solvent is dichloromethane.<br>
The Vanadium compound used in step (a) is a Vanadium salt soluble in hydrocarbons in which the valence of Vanadium is between 3 and 5. Mixtures of these Vanadium compounds can obviously be used. Non-<br><br>
limiting examples of these compounds are:<br>
—	Vanadyl trihalides, alkoxyhalides and alkoxides such<br>
as VOCI3, V0Cl2(0Bu) and VO(OC2H5)3;<br>
—	Vanadium tetrahalides and Vanadium alkoxyhalides such as VCl^ and VCljCOBu);<br>
—	Vanadium and Vanadyl acetyl acetonates and chloro acetyl acetonates, such as V(AcAc)3, V0Cl2(AcAc) , V0(AcAc)2 wherein (AcAc) is an acetylacetonate;<br>
—	Complexes between Vanadium halide and Lewis bases such as VCI3.2THF wherein THF is tetrahydrofuran.<br>
In the preferred form of embodiment the Vanadium is V(III) acetyl acetonate.<br>
The quantity of Vanadium reacted with the inert support is almost totally adsorbed on the matrix itself.<br>
At the end of step (a) the inert support has a content of Vanadium of between 0.01 and 1 mmole of Vanadium per gram of support, preferably between 0.1 and 0.5 mmoles per gram of support.<br>
The impregnation operation (step a) , is carried cut by putting the inert support in contact, pr*=ferah1y under stirring, with the solution of Vanadium compound. This operation is normally carried out at a temperature of between 10 and 40°C and for a time which depends on the concentration and quantity of Vanadium; a time of<br><br>
between 5 minutes and 2 hours is usually sufficient to ensure impregnation of the inert matrix, but higher times, do not cause any inconvenience. Step (a) is carried out in an environment of inert gas, for example in an atmosphere of nitrogen, argon or helium.<br>
The above step (a) is carried out by putting the inert support in contact with a solution of Vanadium, the volume of the above solution preferably being about the same as the total porosity of the inert support.<br>
Operating in this way, at the end of step (a) a humid but flowing powder is obtained which can be dried or used as such. A much higher volume can be used however, which is then dried.<br>
When step (a) has been carried out, the dispersion thus obtained can be used as such for step (c), or the solvent can be removed (step b) from the solid obtained in step (a). This can be carried out with the conven¬tional techniques, for example by filtration and subsequent drying of the solid, or by simple drying of the impregnated solid obtained in step (a).<br>
As in step (a), disc step (c) is carried out in an inert atmosphere. However, in a preferred form of embodiment, step (c) is carried out in an atmosphere of ethylene, or a mixture of ethylene ami alpha-olefin, the latter in liquid or gas form, so as to cover the<br><br>
support granule with a layer of homo or copolymer, thus obtaining a prepolymerized catalyst.<br>
Among the compounds having general formula (I) R^AIX^ wherein R is a C^-CJQ alkyl radical, X is a halide, n + m = 3, and m is an integer from 0 to 2, which can be used in step (c) , alkyl Aluminium chlo¬rides, such as A1(C2H5)2C1, Al (€2115)012 are particularly useful, the most preferred being diethylaluminium chloride (DEAC).<br>
The catalytic component obtained in step (c) can be used in the polymerization phase as it is obtained, or it can preferably be separated and purified with the normal separation and purification techniques, for example filtration and washing.<br>
The catalytic component thus prepared at the end of step (c) is used in the preparation of EP copoly¬mers together with a cocatalyst having general formula (I). The above cocatalyst can be the same as or differ¬ent from the organic compound of Aluminium used in step (c). Dialkyl Aluminium chlorides, particularly diethyl-alumxjiiam chloride, are particularly useful cs cocata¬lyst. The molar ratio between cocatalyst and Vanadium can vary from 5 to 1000, preferably from 9 to 60.<br>
In the copolymerization process, as well as the supported catalyst of the present invention and cocata-<br><br>
lyst, it is preferable, as known to experts in the field, also to use a catalysis activator. These activa¬tors usually belong to the group of chlorinated organic compounds, for example ethyl trichloroacetate, n-butyl perchlorocrotonate, diethyl dichloromalonate, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform. The molar ratio between activator and Vanadium can vary from 0/1 to 1000/1, preferably from 0.5/1 to 40/1, even more preferably from 1/1 to 10/1.<br>
The process of the present invention relates to the copolymerization of ethylene with higher alpha-olefins.<br>
The process of the present invention is carried out in suspension, in a reaction medium (in a liquid or gas phase, but preferably in a liquid phase) in which the polymer is basically insoluble. In the preferred form of embodiment the reaction medium prevalently consists of one of the comonomers, to which a saturated hydrocarbon, such as propane, butane, pentane or hexane or aromatics, preferably propane, is optionally added<br>
— c:  J ■! 1 .^ ^»»4-CiZs     vu ^ ... *^v^. i w .<br>
The polymerization temperature is m.aintained at between -5°C and 65°C, preferably between 25 and 50°C. The .contact times vary from 10 minutes to 6 hours, preferably from 30 minutes to 1 hour.<br><br>
The polymerization is generally carried out in the presence of hydrogen as moderator and regulator of the molecular weight, operating at a total pressure of between 5 and 10 bars, preferably between 8 and 3 0 bars, with a ratio between partial pressure of ethylene and partial pressure of hydrogen of more than 4, preferably higher than 20. Other components can however be used as molecular weight regulators, for example diethylzinc.<br>
The elastomeric copolymers which can be obtained with the process of the present invention contain from 35% to 35% by weight of ethylene, preferably from 45% to 75% by weight and have a Mooney viscosity, MLl+4 at 125°C, of between 5 and 120, preferably between 15 and 90.<br>
The term higher alpha-olefins means alpha-olefins having a number of carbon atoms of between 3 and 10, for example propylene, butene-1, pentene-1. In particu¬lar the process of the present invention relates to elastomeric ethylene-propylene copolymers.<br>
As is known LO experts in the field, ethylene and higher alpha-olefins can be copolymerized with other monomers to give elastomeric terpolymers (EPDM). These termonomers can be selected, as known to experts in the field, from:<br><br>
—	dienes with a linear chain such as 1, 4-hexadiene and 1, 6-octadiene;<br>
—	acyclic dienes with a branched chain such as S-methyl-l,4-hexadiene; 3,V-dimethyl-l,6-octadiene ; 3,7-dimethyl-l,7-octadiene; dihydro myrcene and di-hydrocymene;<br>
—	alicyclic dienes with a single ring such as 1,4-cyclohexadiene; 1,5-cyclooctadiene; 1,5-cyclododeca-diene;<br>
—	dienes having condensed and bridged alicyclic rings such as methyltetrahydroindene; dicyclopenta-diene; bicyclo-(2,2,1-)-hepta-2,5-diene; alkenyl, alkylidene, cycloalkenyl and cycloalkylidene norborne-nes such as 5-methylene-2-norbornene (MNB); 5-ethyl-idene-2-norbornene (ENB); 5-propenyl-2-norbornene; 5-isopropenyl-2-norbornene ; 5-(4-cyclopentenyl)2-norbornene; 5-cyclohexylidene-2-norbornene.<br>
Among the non conjugated dienes tyf)ically used for preparing these copolymers, dienes containing at least one double bond in a tensioned ring are preferred. The third monomer which is mostly preferred is S-erhyli-dene-2-norbornene (ENB).<br>
Apart from the minimum fouling of the autoclave, the process of the present invention allows copolymers to be produced which, with the same composition, have<br><br>
a lower crystallinity than those of the prior art.<br>
The following examples provide a better under¬standing of the present invention. EXAMPLES<br>
All the reagents are commercially produced; the solvents and liquid activators were deaerated under nitrogen and anhydrified on alumina or molecular sieves.<br>
The organic compounds of aluminium were used in a dilute solution in hexane.<br>
The copolymers obtained in the following examples were characterized as follows:<br>
A)	Composition and reactivity ratio: These were deter¬<br>
mined by infrared analysis of the polymer in the form<br>
of films with a thickness of 0.2 mm using a Perkin<br>
Elmer FTIR spectrophotometer 1760 model.<br>
The propylene content was determined by measuring the ratio between the absorbances of bands 4 390 and 4255 cm"^ and using a calibration curve calibrated with standard polymers.<br>
The ~-f*'^2 ?-cduct v;as determined with the spectro¬scopic method described in literature (European Polymer Journal, 4, pages 107-114 (1968).<br>
B)	ML Mooney viscosity (1+4): this was determined at<br>
100 and 125°C according to the method ASTM D1646-87.<br><br>
C)	The melting heat, correlated to the crystallinity of the copolymer was determined by DSC with the instrument Perkin-Elmer DSC7 in an inert atmosphere and with a scanning rate of 20°C/min.<br>
D)	The evaluation of the fouling of the polymerization reactor was determined by observing the morphology of the product at the end of the polymerization, after evaporation of the reaction medium.<br>
When there is no presence of particles, the classification is "D".<br>
When the polymer is present in the form of parti¬cles englobed (molten) in the polymeric mass, the classification is "C".<br>
When the polymer is present in the form of sepa¬rate but attached particles, the classification is "B".<br>
When the polymer is present in the form of sepa¬rate and free-flowing particles, the classification is "A".<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1 - Ethylene Propylene copolymer-ization.<br>
830 9iams of liquid propylene were charged into a perfectly anhydrous 2.8 dm^ autoclave equipped with a propeller stirrer. The autoclave is thermostat-regu¬lated at about 40°C, saturated with ethylene until an overpressure of 3.5 bars is reached and then with a<br><br>
further overpressure of 0.1 bars of hydrogen. The total pressure in the top of the autoclave was 19.1 bars.<br>

port.<br>
After stirring for 10 minutes the catalyst was dried.<br>
It was then saturated with ethylene. 6.25 mmoles of DEAC in 50 cm^ of hexane were then rapidly added. The mixture was left to react at room temperature for about 60 minutes and was then decanted. The liquid proved to be perfectly colourless. After separation of the liquid, the solid was dried at reduced pressure and 6.75 grams of powder containing 1.8% of vanadium were obtained. B) Copolymerization of ethylene and propylene.<br>
810 grams of liquid propylene are charged into a perfectly anhydrous cylindrical 2.8 dm- autoclave equipped with a propeller stirrer. The c.utoclave is thermostat-regulated at 40°C, saturated with ethylene up to an overpressure of 4 bars, and subsequently charged with a further overpressure of 0.1 bars of hydrogen. The total pressure in the top of the auto¬clave is 19.6 bars.<br>
A hexane solution containing 5.4 mmoles of DEAC and subsequently 0.2 55 grams of the catalyst previously prepared in hexane containing 0.7 mmoles of ethyl trichloroacetate were then introduced. The reaction is carried out at a constant temperature, feeding the<br><br>
ethylene in continuous in order to keep the total pressure constant.<br>
After 60 minutes, the monomers were evaporated and the autoclave was opened. Fouling classification: "A/B" in the sense that the particles present on the surface are easily separated.<br>
92 grains of polymer were recovered equal to 20 Kg of polymer per gram of Vanadium. The characterizations are shown in table 1. EXAMPLE 7 A) Preparation of the prepolymerized catalyst.<br>
5.21 grams of silica dehydrated for 4 hours under nitrogen were impregnated under pumping of nitrogen and mechanical stirring with a solution containing 1.95 mmoles of Vanadium (III) acetylacetonate in dichlorome-thane.<br>
The mixture is left to evaporate at 40 °C in a nitrogen stream under stirring for 30 minutes.<br>
It is then saturated with ethylene at atmospheric pressure. 4.87 mmoles of DEAC in 50 ml of hexane were then rapidly adaed. It was immediately observed that the apparatus tended to go under vacuum, for about 230 minutes, at room temperature, then the mixture was left to decant. The liquid proved to be perfectly colour¬less. It was dried under reduced pressure and 7.44<br><br>
grains of powder containing 1.34% of Vanadium were<br>
obtained.<br>
B) Copolymerization of ethylene and propylene.<br>
790 grains of liquid propylene are charged into a perfectly anhydrous cylindrical 2.8 dm^ autoclave equipped with a propeller stirrer. The autoclave is thermostat-regulated at 40°C and then saturated with ethylene until an overpressure of 5 bars is reached and then with hydrogen until an overpressure of 0.1 bars is reached. The total pressure in the top of the autoclave is 20.5 bars.<br>
A hexanic solution containing 5.7 mmoles of DEAC and subsequently 0.45 grams of the catalyst previously prepared in hexane containing 0.9 mmoles of ethyl trichloroacetate were then introduced. The reaction is carried out at a constant temperature, feeding the ethylene in continuous in order to keep the total pressure constant.<br>
After 60 minutes, the monomers were evaporated and the autoclave was opened. Fouling classification: "A/B" in the sense that tne particles present on the surface are easily separated.<br>
127 grams of polymer were recovered equal to 21.1 Kg of polymer per gram of Vanadium. The characteriza¬tions are shown in table 1.<br><br><br>
It should be noted that in the composirive range from 66.8 to 62.3% by weight of ethylene, with the process of the present invention crystallinities of 1.07%, 0.34% and 0.92% respectively (examples 4, 5 and 7) are obtained. These values were determined by dividing the melting heat by 272 j/g, as indicated in the experimental part of US-A-5.002.916.<br>
For compositions going from 61.4% to 66.4% of ethylene, US-A-5.002.916 obtains a crystallinity of between 4.6% and 8.2%. More specifically US'916 obtains the following results: -- with 66.4% of ethylene a crystallinity of 7.5% is<br><br>
obtained;<br>
—	with 65.7% of ethylene a crystallinity of 8.2% is obtained;<br>
—	with 61.7% of ethylene a crystallinity of 4.6% is obtained;<br>
—	with 61.4% of ethylene a crystallinity of 6.5% is obtained.<br>
Comparative EXAMPLE 8<br>
A catalyst as described in GB-A-2.105.355 is prepared.<br>
A gram of silica (equal to that used in the previous samples) and 100 cc of anhydrous hexane are put into a 100 cc tailed test-tube under vacuum and magnetic stirring.<br>
0.2 4 grams (2 mmoles) of DEAC are then added and the mixture is gently stirred for 3 0 minutes. The solvent is then evaporated at room temperature until a free-flowing powder is obtained.<br>
0.1 mmoles of Vanadium (III) acetylacetonate dissolved in 10 cc of anhydrous toluene are added (molar ratio Al/V = 20).<br>
The mixture left under stirring for 30 minutes, and the solvent is then evaporated at room temperature until a free-flowing catalyst is obtained.<br>
1.2 grams of catalyst containing 0.0051 grams of<br><br>
Vanadium are thus obtained.<br>
The catalyst thus obtained was tested under the same conditions as example 6 with the difference that the DEAC was only used for cleansing (about 0.7 mmoles) and all the catalyst previously prepared was used.<br>
Only 3.0 grains of copolymer were obtained with a yield of 0.59 kg of polymer per gram of Vanadium. Comparative EXAMPLE 9<br>
With the same method described in comparative example 8, a catalyst was prepared using a greater quantity of Al-alkyl in the synthesis, in order to have a final ratio Al/V = 52.<br>
The catalyst thus obtained was tested under the same conditions as the previous example and 3.5 grams of polymer were obtained equal to a yield of 0.59 kg of polymer per gram of Vanadium.<br>
Comparative examples 8 and 9 show that the cata¬lysts described in GB-A-2.105.355, which are efficient in copolymerization in a gas phase, are not efficient in mass polymerization.<br><br><br>
