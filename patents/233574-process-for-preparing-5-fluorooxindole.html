5 -fluorooxindole and a process for preparing its preparation<br>
intermediates, more specifically to a process for preparing<br>
5-fluorooxindole which is useful as a synthetic intermediate<br>
for a medicine such as an anticancer agent or anti-inflammatory<br>
and analgesic agent and a simple and easy process for preparing<br>
2 -(5 -fluoro-2-nitrophenyl)-2 - substituted acetic acid ester<br>
which is a preparation intermediate.<br>
Background Art<br>
As a conventional method for preparing a 2-(5-halogeno-<br>
2-nitrophenyl)-2-substituted acetic acid ester compound from<br>
2 , 4 -dihalogenonitrobenzene compound, it has been known a method<br>
of synthesizing dimethyl 2 - (5 -halogeno-2 -nitrophenyl) malonate<br>
by reacting dimethyl malonate with 2,4-dihalogenonitrobenzene<br>
in the presence of sodium hydride in dimethyl sulfoxide<br>
(Synthesis, 1993, 51). However, according to this method,<br>
complicated operations are required since sodium hydride having<br>
highly ignitable property is used and the reaction generates<br>
a hydrogen gas, so that it has problems as an industrial production<br>
process.<br>
Also, as a process for producing 5-fluorooxindole from<br>
2 - (5-f luoro-2-nitrophenyl) malonic acid di ester which is a kind<br>
of the above-mentioned 2- (5-halogeno-2-nitrophenyl)-2-substituted<br>
acetic acid ester, it has been described in Synthesis,<br>
1993, 51, a process for producing 5 - f luorooxindole by reacting<br>
lithium chloride with dimethyl 2-(5 -fluoro-2-nitrophenyl)-<br>
malonate in a mixed solvent of water and dimethyl sulfoxide to<br>
once form methyl 5 -fluoro-2-nitrophenylacetate, and then,<br>
reducing the resulting compound in acetic acid in the presence<br>
of iron and cyclizing the resulting compound. However,<br>
according to this process, there are problems that the reaction<br>
system is complicated and a total yield of the obj ective compound<br>
is as low as 49%.<br>
An object of the present invention is to solve the<br>
above -mentioned problems and to pro vide an industrially suitable<br>
process for preparing 5 - f luorooxindole from an easily available<br>
2 - (5 - f luoro-2 -nitrophenyl) malonic acid diester with a simple<br>

A further object of the present invention is to solve the<br>
above -mentioned problems and to pro vide an industrially suitable<br>
process for preparing a 2 - (5 -halogeno- 2 -nitrophenyl) malonic<br>

compound with a simple and easy method.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a novel 5 - f luorooxindole- 3 -carboxylic acid ester and<br>
a 2- (5- halogeno-2 -nitrophenyl) - 2 - subs tituted acetic acid<br>
ester compound which are useful as synthetic intermediates of<br>
