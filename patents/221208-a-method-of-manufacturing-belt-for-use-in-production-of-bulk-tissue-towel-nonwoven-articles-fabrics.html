				<td>1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The "present invention relates to the papermaking arts, and specifically to the manufacture of paper tissue and toweling, which may be collectively referred to as bulk tissue. The present invention also relates to the manufacture of nonwoven articles and fabrics by processes such as hydroentanglement. In particular, the present invention relates to belts, which have had a functional polymeric resin material deposited in precise preselected areas onto their base structures to fill those areas and, when desired, to form a layer of desired thickness thereover. Belts of this type are' used in the manufacture of bulk tissue and towel, and of nonwoven articles and fabrics.<br>
2.	Background of the Invention<br>
Soft, absorbent disposable paper products, such as facial tissue, bath tissue and paper toweling, are a pervasive feature of contemporary life in modern industrialized societies. While there are numerous methods for manufacturing such products, in general terms, their manufacture begins with the formation of an embryonic paper web in the forming section of a paper machine. The embryonic paper web is then transferred to a through-air-drying (TAD) fabric by means of an air flow, brought about by vacuum or suction, which deflects the web and forces it to conform, at least in part, to the topography of the TAD fabric. Downstream from the<br><br>
transfer point, the web, carried on the TAD fabric, passes through a through-air dryer, where a flow of heated air, directed against the web and through the TAD fabric, dries the web to a desired degree. Finally, downstream from the through-air dryer, -the web may be adhered to the surface of a Yankee dryer and imprinted thereon by the surface of the TAD fabric, for further and complete drying. The fully dried web is then removed from the surface of the Yankee dryer with a doctor blade, which foreshortens or crepes the web and increases its bulk. The foreshortened web is then wound onto rolls for subsequent processing, including packaging into a form suitable for shipment to and purchase by consumers.<br>
As noted above, there are many methods for manufacturing bulk tissue products, and the foregoing description should be understood to be an outline of the general steps shared by some of the methods. For example, the use of a Yankee dryer is not always required, as, in a given situation, foreshortening may not be desired, or other means, such as "wet creping", may have already been taken to foreshorten the web.<br>
The present application is concerned, at least in part, with the TAD fabrics used on the through-air dryer of a bulk tissue machine. Historically, TAD fabrics were woven from monofilament yarns in weave patterns which provided their paper-supporting surfaces with knuckles, elevated relative to other areas on the surfaces, having relatively long floats. Upon transfer from a forming fabric to the paper-contacting surface of such a TAD fabric, the embryonic paper web would assume, at least in part, the topography of that surface. As a consequence, the portions of the embryonic paper web<br><br>
deflected between the knuckles becomes less dense relative to those on the knuckles, ultimately giving the bulk tissue product - softness and absorbency. Upon subsequent pressure transfer from the TAD fabric to the surface of a Yankee dryer, the knuckles on the paper-contacting surface of the TAD fabric imprint and density those portions of the paper web lying thereon. This densification, in turn, strengthens the bulk tissue product as a whole. The densification was typically enhanced by abrading or sanding the paper-contacting surface of the TAD fabric to provide the knuckles with flat surfaces, thereby increasing the contact area between the paper web and the Yankee dryer, * and enlarging the knuckle imprints to strengthen the bulk tissue product further and to dry it more completely.<br>
Driven by consumer interest in softer, more absorbent and stronger bulk tissue products, development initially centered on the weave patterns used to produce TAD fabrics. For example, in the now expired U.S. Patents Nos. 4,191,609 and 4,239,065 to Trokhan, which are assigned to the Procter &amp; Gamble Company of Cincinnati, Ohio, TAD fabrics woven in weave patterns having nonnumerically consecutive warp-pick sequences are shown. The disclosed weave patterns provide the paper-supporting surfaces of the subject TAD fabrics with a plurality of wicker-basket-like cavities disposed in a bilaterally staggered array, each such cavity being bounded by knuckles on the top-surface plane of the fabric. The TAD fabrics enable a bulk tissue product, having a patterned array of relatively closely spaced uncompressed pillow-like zones, each zone being circumscribed by a picket-like lineament comprising alternately spaced areas of compacted fibers and<br><br>
relatively  non-compacted  fibers  and  formed  by  the %top-surface-plane knuckles, to be produced.<br>
During the 1980's, an alternate means for providing a TAD fabric with the equivalent of wicker-basket-like cavities was developed. Procter &amp; Gamble's U-S. Patents Nos. 4,528,239; 4,529,480; and 4,637,859 to Trokhan, which are among the earliest U.S. patent documents on these means, show a TAD belt comprising a foraminous woven element, that is, a woven base fabric, having a coating of a polymeric resin material in preselected areas. More specifically, the polymeric resin material provides the TAD belt with a macroscopically monoplanar, patterned, continuous network surface which serves to define within the TAD belt a plurality of discrete, isolated deflection conduits or holes, rather than wicker-basket-like cavities. To produce the TAD belt, the foraminous woven element is thoroughly coated with a liquid photosensitive resin to a controlled thickness above its upper surface, and a mask or a negative having opaque and transparent regions which define a desired pattern is brought into contact with the surface of the liquid photosensitive resin and the resin is exposed to actinic radiation through the mask. The radiation, typically in the ultraviolet (UV) portion of the spectrum, cures these portions of the resin exposed through the mask, but does not cure these portions shadowed by the mask. The uncured resin is subsequently removed by washing to leave behind the foraminous woven element with a coating in the desired pattern formed by the cured resin.<br>
The seminal U.S. patent disclosing this method is Procter &amp; Gamble's U.S. Patent No. 4,514,345 to Johnson et al. In addition to disclosing the method for making<br><br>
the TAD belt described in the preceding paragraph, this patent also shows a fabric in which the polymeric resin material forms a plurality of discrete protuberances on its surface. That is to say, the pattern is the reverse of a continuous network having holes. Instead, the pattern is of discrete areas which are occluded or blocked by the polymeric resin material in an otherwise open foraminous woven element. Belts of this kind may be used in the forming section of a bulk tissue machine to form embryonic paper webs having discrete regions of relatively low basis weight in a continuous background, of relatively high basis weight, as shown for example, in Procter &amp; Gamble's U.S. Patent No. 5,277,761 to Van Phan et al. Belts of this kind may also be used to manufacture nonwoven articles and fabrics, which have discrete regions in which the density of fibers is less than that in adjacent regions, by processes such as hydroentanglement. Also in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,080,691 and 6,120,642 to Kimberly-Clark there is disclosed a papermaking fabric for producing a soft, bulky tissue web wherein the web contact surface is a three dimensional porous nonwoven material. This material may be in the form of fiberous mats or web, extruded networks or foams. Attachment of the porous nonwoven material can be by lamination, extrusion, adhesives, melt bonding, entanglement, welding, needling, nesting or layering.<br>
In addition to discrete {non-continuous) and continuous networks of polymeric resin material on the foraminous woven element, the method disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,514,345 to Johnson et al. may also be used to manufacture fabrics having semicontinuous networks of polymeric resin material. For example. Proctor &amp;<br><br>
Gamble's U.S. Patent No. 5,714,041 to Ayers et al. shows a belt, useful as a TAD fabric, having a framework of protuberances arranged in a semicontinuous pattern to provide a semicontinuous pattern of deflection conduits. By "semicontinuous"  is meant that each protuberance, extends  substantially  throughout  the  belt  in  an essentially linear fashion, and that each protuberance is spaced apart from adjacent protuberances. As such, the protuberances may be lines which are generally straight, parallel and equally spaced from one another, or may be in the shape of zigzags . which are generally parallel and equally spaced from one another.<br>
In some bulk-tissue applications, press fabrics having a continuous, semicontinuous or discrete network of polymeric resin material on their paper-contacting surfaces are used. By "press fabric" is meant a fabric normally used on the press section of a paper machine and comprising a base fabric or other support structure and one or more layers of staple fiber material attached to at least one side thereof. For example, Procter &amp; Gamble's U.S. Patent No. 5,556,509 to Trokhan et al. shows "press fabrics" having continuous and discrete networks of polymeric material on their paper-contacting surfaces and used to make bulk tissue products.<br>
The method disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,514,345, and the refinements thereto disclosed in subsequent Procter &amp; Gamble U.S. patents, are quite elaborate and time-consuming. A more direct approach for providing a forming, press or TAD fabric, or a fabric used in the manufacture of nonwoven articles and fabrics by processes such as hydroentanglement, with a coating of a polymeric resin material in the form of a continuous, semi continuous or discrete network has long been sought<br><br>
in  the  industries  concerned.  The present  invention satisfies this long-felt need.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is a method for manufacturing a belt for use in the production of bulk tissue and towel, and of nonwoven articles and fabrics. The method comprises a first step of providing a base substrate for the belt.<br>
Sacrificial material is then deposited onto the base substrate in a precise predetermined pattern, which predetermined pattern is to be imparted onto products manufactured with the belt. The sacrificial material penetrating into the base substrate and, when desired, forms a layer of desired thickness thereover, to provide a mold within and, when desired, on the base substrate. Subsequently, a functional polymeric resin material is deposited onto the base substrate to fill in and, when desired, to cover areas thereof not previously covered by the sacrificial material with a layer of desired thickness, that is, to fill the mold defined by the sacrificial material. The polymeric resin material is then set or fixed by appropriate means.<br>
Finally, the sacrificial material is removed from the belt newly manufactured from the base substrate. Typically, the sacrificial material is removed through the application of an appropriate solvent or heat. Either before or after the removal of the sacrificial material,  the deposited polymeric resin material may optionally be abraded to provide it with a uniform thickness  and  a  smooth,  macroscopically  monoplanar surface,  when desired,  or to expose any sacrificial<br><br>
material that may have been covered by the polymeric resin material for subsequent removal.<br>
The present invention will now be described in more complete detail, with frequent reference being made to the figures identified below.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The method for fabricating a belt in accordance with the present invention begins with the provision of a base substrate. Typically, the base structure or substrate is a fabric woven from monofilament yarns. More broadly, however, the base substrate may be a woven, nonwoven or knitted fabric comprising yarns of any of the varieties used in the production of paper machine clothing or of belts used to manufacture nonwoven articles and fabrics, such as monofilament, plied monofilament, multif ilament and plied multifilament yarns. These yarns may be obtained by extrusion from any of the polymeric resin materials used for this purpose by those of ordinary skill in the art. Accordingly, resins from the families of polyamide, polyester, polyurethane, polyaramid, polyolefin and other resins may be used.<br>
Alternatively, the base substrate may be composed of mesh  fabrics,  such  as  those  shown  in  commonly assigned U.S.  Patent No.  4,427,734 to Johnson,  the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. The base substrate may further be a spiral-link belt of the variety shown in many U.S. patents, such as U.S. Patent No. 4,567,077 to Gauthier, the teachings of which are also incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Moreover, the base substrate may be produced by spirally winding a strip of woven, nonwoven, knitted or mesh fabric in accordance with the methods shown in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 5,360,656 to Rexfelt et al. , the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. The base substrate may accordingly comprise a spirally wound strip, wherein each spiral<br><br>
turn 'is joined to the next by a continuous seam making the base substrate endless in a longitudinal direction.<br>
The above should not be considered to be the only possible forms for the base substrate. Any of the varieties of base substrate used by those of ordinary skill in the paper machine clothing and related arts may alternatively be used.<br>
Once the base substrate has been provided, one or more layers of staple fiber batt may optionally be attached to one or both of its two sides by methods well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Perhaps the best known and most commonly used method is that of needling, wherein the individual staple fibers in the batt are driven into the base structure by a plurality of reciprocating barbed needles. Alternatively, the individual staple fibers may be attached to the base substrate by hydroentangling, wherein fine high-pressure jets of water perform the same function as the above-mentioned reciprocating barbed needles. It will be recognized that, once staple fiber batt has been attached to the base substrate by either of these or other methods known by those of ordinary skill in the art, one would have a structure identical to that of a press fabric of the variety generally used to dewater a wet paper web in the press section of a paper machine.<br>
Alternatively still, the base substrate may be a structure which has been rendered impermeable to fluids, such as air and water, with a coating of a polymeric resin material, which at least partially impregnates the structure and which may form a layer of a desired thickness on one of its two sides. An impermeable base substrate may be used in the present invention in the manufacture of an embossing belt of the variety shown in<br><br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,340,413, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. The embossing belt disclosed therein is essentially impermeable and comprises a rear layer and a web-contacting layer, which has a large number of uniformly distributed depressions and, positioned therebetween, surface portions for forming a corresponding relief pattern in a fibrous web passing through a press section of a paper machine. The embossing belt also transfers the embossed fibrous web to the dryer section of the paper machine.<br>
Furthermore, structures of this type, whether permeable or not, can have a random surface topography. This topography can be repeated within a structure, or obviously, repeated in a subsequent structure produced for the same paper, tissue or nonwoven production machine. Fabrics of this type are taught in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,080,691 and 6,120,642, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The belts manufactured in accordance with the present invention may be used on the forming, press or through-air-drying sections of a paper machine, especially those providing tissue or towel products or on a machine used to manufacture nonwoven articles and fabrics by processes such as hydroentanglement. Those having a needled batt-on-base substrate are most suitable for use on a press section, while those lacking staple fiber batt may find use on any of these sections or machines. In some cases, it may be necessary to aPPly an initial layer or additional batt to the structure after application of the resin. In such cases the patterned resin may lie below a layer of batt fibers.<br><br>
Once the base substrate/ with or without the addition of staple fiber batt material, has been provided, it is mounted on the apparatus 10 shown schematically in Figure 1. It should be understood that the base substrate may be either endless or seamable into endless form during installation on a paper machine. As such, the base substrate 12 shown in Figure 1 should be understood to be a relatively short portion of the entire length of the base substrate 12. Where the base substrate 12 is endless, it would most practically be mounted about a pair of rolls, not illustrated in the figure but most familiar to those of ordinary skill in the paper machine clothing arts. In such a situation, apparatus 10 would be disposed on one of the two runs, most conveniently the top run, of the base substrate 12 between the two rolls. Whether endless or not, however, the base substrate 12 is preferably placed under an appropriate degree of tension during the process. Moreover, to prevent sagging, the base substrate 12 may be supported from below by a horizontal support member as it moves through apparatus 10.<br>
Referring now more specifically to Figure 1, where the base substrate 12 is indicated as moving in an upward direction through the apparatus 10 as the method of the present invention is being carried out, apparatus 10 comprises a sequence of several stations through which the base substrate 12 may pass incrementally as a belt is being manufactured therefrom.<br>
In the first station, the mold element deposition station 14, a piezojet array 16 mounted on transverse rails 18,20 and translatable thereon in a direction transverse to that of the motion of the base substrate 12 through the apparatus 10, as well as therebetween in<br><br>
a direction parallel to that of the motion of the base substrate 12, may be used to deposit in repeated steps to build up the desired amount of sacrificial material onto the base substrate 12 in a predetermined pattern. Alternatively, other means for depositing the small droplets required for the practice of the present invention, as will be discussed below, may be known to those of ordinary skill in the art or may be developed ' in the future, and may be used in the practice of the present invention. In addition the deposit of the sacrificial material need not only be traversing the movement of the base substrate but can be parallel to such movement, spiral to such movement or in any other manner suitable for the purpose.<br>
The sacrificial material penetrates into the base substrate, and, when desired, forms a layer of a desired thickness thereover, in the predetermined pattern. That pattern may be an array of discrete locations which are to be the ultimate locations of a corresponding array of discrete holes or passages for fluid through the belt being manufactured from the base substrate 12, or on the surface of the belt of the base substrate 12. In such a case, as the belt is to be impermeable, the sacrificial material, which is removed later in the belt manufacturing process, and which is not present in a completed belt, is deposited in the discrete locations, where it becomes attached and, where the base substrate 12 is permeable, blocks the passages therethrough, and may rise to a predetermined height and/or shape above the surface of the base substrate 12. Collectively, the discrete locations having the sacrificial material comprise a mold which is subsequently to be filled by a functional polymeric resin material, so called because<br><br>
it is a functional part of the belt when manufacture has been completed.<br>
It  should  be  appreciated  that  the  discrete locations described in the preceding paragraph may be provided with the sacrificial material  in a manner forming, for example, an outline of a familiar object, such as a cloud, flower, swan or leaf, or a corporate or company logo, which is to appear in the desired array on the product to be manufactured on the belt. Moreover, the  array  of  outlines  may  be  superimposed  on  a background array of smaller discrete holes.<br>
Alternatively, the sacrificial material may be deposited in a semicontinuous network, for example, a semicontinuous pattern extending substantially throughout the base substrate 12 in an essentially linear fashion, such that the sacrificial material becomes attached to the base substrate 12 along lines which are generally parallel and equally spaced from one another. Such lines may be either curved, straight, or zigzag. More generally, a semi-continuous network comprises straight or curved lines, or lines having both straight and curved segments, which are spaced apart from one another and do not cross one another.<br>
Alternatively still, the sacrificial material may be deposited in a continuous network extending substantially throughout both dimensions of the surface of the base substrate 12 and defining a plurality of discrete open areas in a predetermined array. These discrete open areas, are ultimately to be filled by a polymeric resin material and become the ultimate locations of discrete areas, filled by the polymeric resin material, on the surface of the belt. In this regard, it should be appreciated that the discrete open<br><br>
areas may form outlines of familiar objects, such as clouds, flowers, swans or leaves, or of corporate or company logos, whose appearance on the product to be manufactured on the belt may be desired. Moreover, the array of outlines may be superimposed on a background array of smaller discrete areas which are filled by the polymeric resin material.<br>
The piezojet array 16 comprises at least one but preferably a plurality of individual computer-controlled piezojets, each functioning as a pump whose active component is a piezoelectric element. As a practical matter an array of up to 256 piezo jets or more may be utilized if the technology permits. The active component is a crystal or ceramic which is physically deformed by an applied electric signal. This deformation enables the crystal or ceramic to function as a pump, which physically ejects a drop of a liquid material each time an appropriate electric signal is received. As such, this method of using piezojets to supply drops of a desired material repeatedly so as to build up the desired amount of material in the desired shape in response to computer-controlled electric signals is commonly referred to as a "drop-on-demand" method.<br>
The degree of precision of the jet in depositing the material will depend upon the dimensions and shape of the structure being formed. The type of jet used and the viscosity of the material being applied will also impact the precision of the jet selected.<br>
Referring again to Figure 1, the piezojet array 16, starting from an edge of the base substrate 12, or, preferably, from a reference thread extending lengthwise therein, translates lengthwise and widthwise across the base substrate 12, while the base substrate 12 is at<br><br>
rest, aeposics ttie sacriticial material in the form of extremely small droplets of lOp (10 microns)or more such as 50|J (50 microns) or lOOp, (100 microns) , in one of the above-described patterns. The translation of the piezojet array 16 lengthwise and widthwise relative to the base substrate 12, and the deposition of droplets of the sacrificial material from each piezojet in the array 16, are controlled by computer in a controlled manner to produce the predetermined pattern of the sacrificial material in a controlled geometry in three planes length, width and depth or height (x, y, z dimensions or directions) within and, when desired, on the base substrate 12. One or more passes over the base substrate 12 may be made by piezojet array 16 to deposit the desired amount of sacrificial material and to create the desired shape. In this regard, the deposits can take any number of shapes as illustrated generally in Figure 9. The shapes can be square, round conical, rectangular, oval, trapezoidal etc. with a thicker base tapering upward. Depending upon the design chosen, the amount of material deposited can be layered in decreasing fashion as the jet repeatedly passes over the deposit area.<br>
When the pattern has been completed in a band between the transverse rails 18,20 across the base substrate 12, the base substrate 12 is advanced<br>
Lengthwise an amount equal to the width of the band, and<br>
i ;he procedure described above is repeated to produce the<br>
predetermined pattern in a new band adjacent to that previously completed. In this repetitive manner, the entire base substrate 12 can be provided with the predetermined pattern.<br><br>
Alternatively, the piezojet array 16, again starting from an edge of the base substrate 12, or, preferably, from a reference thread extending lengthwise therein, is kept in . a fixed position relative to the transverse rails 18,20, while the base substrate 12 moves beneath it, to deposit the sacrificial material in the desired pattern in a lengthwise strip around the base substrate 12. Upon completion of the lengthwise strip, the piezojet array 16 is moved widthwise on transverse rails 18,20 an amount equal to the width of the lengthwise strip, and the procedure described above is repeated to produce the predetermined pattern in a new lengthwise strip adjacent to that previously completed. In this repetitive manner, the entire base substrate 12 can be provided with the predetermined pattern.<br>
At one end of the transverse rails 18,20, a jet-check station 22 is provided for testing the flow of sacrificial material from each jet. There, the jets can be purged and cleaned to restore operation automatically to any malfunctioning jet unit.<br>
The sacrificial material is a solid material which melts quickly upon heating, and sets to bond firmly with the base substrate 12 upon cooling. The sacrificial material may be supplied from a heated reservoir, where it is maintained in a liquid state, and pumped through a feed line to the piezojet or piezojets. The viscosity of the sacrificial material at the point of delivery in conjunction with the jet size is important in defining the size and shape of the droplets formed on the base substrate 12 and in time the resolution of the pattern ultimately achieved.<br><br>
The sacrificial material may be.&gt; a non-aqueous, solvent-removable wax, or a water-soluble wax, such as water-soluble polyethylene g'lycol or polyvinyl alcohol. More generally, the sacrificial material may be any material which is deliverable though a piezojet in extremely small droplets in the size range given above, and which may ultimately be removed from the base substrate 12 by means not destructive to the base substrate 12 and any functional polymeric resin material thereon. In addition to these requirements, the sacrificial material has to be capable of being fixed or set within and on the base substrate 12 as quickly as possible following deposition thereon, in order to control its penetration into and distribution within and on the base substrate, that is, to control and confine the sacrificial material within the desired volume of the base substrate 12, and to prevent its undesirable ticking and spreading. Also by depositing the droplets in a repeating pattern, that being by layering one droplet on top of the next, the height or z-direction of the sacrificial material on the base substrate is controlled and may be uniform, varied or otherwise adjusted as desired. Note the pattern can be random, a repeating random pattern on a base substrate or such patterns that are repea table from belt to belt for quality control.<br>
In the second station, the imaging/repair station 24, transverse rails 26,28 support a digital imaging camera 30, which is translatable across the width of base substrate 12, and a repair-jet array 32, which is translatable both across the width of the base substrate 12 and lengthwise relative thereto between transverse rails 26,28, while the base substrate 12 is at rest.<br><br>
The digital imaging camera 30 views the deposited sacrificial material to locate any faulty or missing discrete mold elements, or similar irregularities in a semicontinuous or continuous pattern produced thereby within and, when desired, on the base substrate 12. Comparisons between the actual and desired patterns are made by a fast pattern recognizer (FPR) processor operating in conjunction with the digital imaging camera 30. The FPR processor signals the repair-jet array 32 to deposit additional sacrificial material onto the mold elements detected to be faulty or missing. As before, at one end of the transverse rails 26,28, a repair-jet check station 34 is provided for testing the flow of material from each repair jet. There, each repair jet can be purged and cleaned to restore operation automatically to any malfunctioning repair-jet unit.<br>
In the third station, the polymer deposition station 36, transverse rails 38,40 support a metering device, such as a bulk-jet array 42, which is translatable thereon in a direction transverse to that of the motion of the base substrate 12 through the apparatus 10, as well as therebetween in a direction parallel to that of the motion of the base substrate 12, while the latter is at rest. The bulk-jet array 42 is ased to deposit the functional polymeric resin material onto or within the' base substrate 12, except in regions filled with the sacrificial material, to fill the mold formed by the sacrificial material within the base substrate 12 and, when desired, on the base substrate 12 to form a layer of desired thickness thereover. The latter may be a polyurethane or photosensitive resin, as well as others from the classes to be identified below as being capable of deposition by piezojet array. The<br><br>
bulk-jet array 42 fills the base substrate 12 and, when desired, leaves a uniformly thick layer of the functional polymeric resin material, preferably no thicker than the regions of removable material, on the base substrate 12. As such, the polymeric resin material could ultimately reside entirely within the surface plane of the base substrate 12 or above the surface plane of the base substrate 12. This surface is usually the contacting surface with the paper, tissue, towel or nonwoven product to be produced. It is envisioned that some products/processes will require this resin to be primarily on the nonproduct contact surface. In this case fluid flow or mechanical pressure differences that occur when the belt and the produced products are in contact will still cause local density or texture differences.<br>
A setting device 44, if required to se.t or fix the polymeric resin material being used, may also be mounted on the transverse rails 38,40, and follows the bulk-jet array 42 across the base substrate 12 to set or fix the material deposited thereby. The setting device 44 may be a heat source, for example, an infrared, hot air, microwave or laser source; cold air; or an ultraviolet or visible light source, the choice being governed by the requirements of the polymeric resin material being<br>
used.<br>
i<br>
It should be understood that the functional polymeric resin material also needs to be fixed on or within the base substrate 12 following its deposition thereon. The means by which the functional polymeric resin material is set or fixed depends on its own physical and/or chemical requirements. Photopolymers are cured with light, whereas hot-melt materials are set by<br><br>
cooling. Aqueous-based latexes and dispersions are dried and then cured with heat, and reactive systems are cured by heat. Accordingly, the functional polymeric resin materials may be set by curing, cooling, drying, or any combination thereof.<br>
The proper fixing of the functional polymeric resin material is required to control its penetration into and distribution within the base substrate 12, that is, to control and confine the material within the desired volume of the base substrate 12. Such control is important below the surface plane of the base substrate 12 to prevent wieking and spreading, that is, to prevent the functional polymeric resin material from spreading underneath the sacrificial material deposited earlier. Such control may be exercised, for example, by maintaining the base substrate 12 at a temperature which will cause the functional polymeric resin material to set quickly upon contact. Control may also be exercised by using such materials having well-known or well-defined curing or reaction times on base substrates having a degree of openness such that the functional polymeric resin material will set before it has time to spread beyond the desired volume of the base substrate 12.<br>
Again, at one end of the transverse rails 38,40, a bulk-jet check station 46 is provided for testing the flow of material from each bulk jet. There, each bulk jet can be purged and cleaned to restore operation automatically to any malfunctioning bulk-jet unit.<br>
Alternatively, the polymeric resin material may be deposited onto or within the base substrate 12 by spraying, blade coating, single-pass-spiral (SPS) coating, multiple-thin-pass (MTP) coating, or any other<br><br>
methods known in the art to apply a liquid material to a textile substrate.<br>
The fourth station is the mold element removal station 48. Here, the sacrificial material, originally deposited in the mold element deposition station 14, is removed by appropriate means. For example, if the sacrificial material is a wax, the mold removal station 48 may include a heat source of appropriate temperature to melt the wax and enable it to flow from the base substrate 12. If, on the other hand, the sacrificial material is a solvent-removable material, the mold element removal station 48 would provide a treatment, such as by spraying or immersion, with an appropriate solvent, such as water. In practice, the base substrate 12 may be directed in a serpentine path in and out of a solvent bath to allow it to be showered for more efficient removal of the sacrificial material. Alternatively, the serpentine path may be entirely within an agitated solvent bath. By increasing the temperature of the bath, the removal of the sacrificial material may proceed even more efficiently. In any event, the removal of the sacrificial material is carried out by means not destructive to the base substrate 12 and the functional polymeric resin material thereon, and leaves the base substrate 12 with the functional resin in the pattern desired.<br>
Finally^ the optional fifth and last station is grinding station 50, where an appropriate abrasive is used to provide the polymeric resin material with a uniform thickness and a smooth, macroscopically monoplanar surface. It should be understood that the grinding station 50 may alternatively be disposed before the mold element removal station 48 to expose any<br><br>
sacrificial material that may be covered by the polymeric resin material. In any case, the optional grinding station 50 comprises, a roll having an abrasive surface, and another roll or backing surface on the other side of the base substrate 12 to ensure that the grinding will result in a uniform thickness and a smooth, macroscopically monoplanar surface.<br>
As an example, reference is now made to Figure 2, which is a plan view of a permeable base substrate 12, which comprises a system of machine-direction (MD) yarns 52 interwoven with a system of cross-machine-direction (CD) yarns 54. The base substrate 12 is shown as it would appear upon exit from imaging/repair station 24. As such, the base substrate 12 includes a plurality of mold elements 56 of sacrificial material set forth in a predetermined pattern taking the form of an array of discrete locations which are to be the ultimate locations of discrete passages through the belt being manufactured.<br>
Figure 3 is a plan view of the base substrate 12 as it would appear upon exit from polymer deposition station 36. At this point, the substrate may properly be referred to as an intermediate belt product 58, implying that the belt is depicted at an intermediate stage in its manufacture. Polymeric resin material 60 fills in the base substrate 12 except for the locations occupied by the mold elements 56 of sacrificial material.<br>
Figure 4 is a plan view of a completed belt 62 as it would appear upon exit from mold element removal station 48 and optional grinding station 50. The belt 62 includes functional polymeric resin material 60 except at those locations formerly occupied by mold elements 56 of sacrificial material, whose removal leaves the<br><br>
polymeric resin material 60 with a plurality of discrete passages 64 in a predetermined pattern. Since the base substrate 12 in this example is permeable to fluids such as air and water, the discrete passages 64 provide paths to and through the base substrate 12. In this example, a portion of the base substrate 12 is visible in each of the discrete passages 64.<br>
Figure 5 is a cross-sectional view of a completed belt 62 taken as indicated in Figure .4. In this example, polymeric resin material 60 forms a layer of a desired thickness over the base substrate 12, except for the areas represented by the discrete passages 64.<br>
Alternative embodiments of the belt are shown in Figures 6 and 7. Figure 6 is a plan view of a belt 66 whose base substrate 12 has a plurality of discrete areas 68 of polymeric resin material dn a predetermined array. Such a belt 66 may be used in the forming section of a papermaking machine.<br>
Figure 7 is a plan view of a belt 70 having a semicontinuous network of polymeric resin material on its surface. The semicontinuous network extends substantially throughout the belt 70 in an essentially linear fashion. Each portion 72 of the semicontinuous network extends in substantially straight line, which may zigzag to some extent, parallel to others making up the network. Each portion 72 is of polymeric resin material.<br>
Figure 8 is a plan view of a belt 8Q of the variety shown in Figure 4 having an additional pattern superimposed upon a pattern of discrete passages 82. The additional pattern 84, which is a logo, but which may also be a familiar object, may also be repeated in a desired array on the belt 80. A portion of the permeable<br><br>
base substrate 12 is visible in each of the discrete passages 82, as well as in the additional pattern 84.<br>
In an alternate embodiment of the present-invention, the mold element deposition station 14, the imaging/repair station 24, and the polymer deposition station 36 may be adapted to produce a belt from the: base substrate 12 in a spiral technique, rather than by indexing in the crossmachine direction as described above. In a spiral technique, the mold element deposition station 14, the imaging/repair station 24, and the polymer deposition station 36 start at one edge of the base substrate 12, for example, the left-hand edge in Figure 1, and are gradually moved across the base substrate 12, as the base substrate 12 moves in the direction indicated in Figure 1. The rates at which the stations 14,24,36 and the base substrate 12 are moved are set so that the pattern desired in the finished belt is spiralled onto the base substrate 12 in a continuous manner. In this alternative, the polymeric resin, material deposited by the polymer deposition station 36 may be partially set or fixed as each spiral passes beneath the setting device 44, and completely set when the entire base substrate 12 has been processed through apparatus 10.<br>
Alternatively, where the piezojet array 16 deposits the sacrificial material in the desired pattern in a lengthwise strip around the base substrate 12, the imaging/repair station 24 and the polymer deposition station 36 may also be kept in a fixed position aligned with the piezojet array 16, while the'base substrate 12 moves beneath them, so that the pattern desired in the finished belt is applied to a lengthwise strip around the base substrate 12. Upon completion of the lengthwise<br><br>
strip, the piezoj.et array 16, the image/repair station 24 and the polymer depbsition station 36 are moved widthwise an amount equal to the width of the lengthwise strip,  and  the  procedure  is  repeated  for  a  new lengthwise strip adjacent to that previously completed. In this repetitive manner, the entire base substrate 12 can be completely processed into a belt.Furthermore, the entire apparatus can remain in a fixed position with the material processed.    It  should be noted  that  the material need not be a full width belt but can be a strip of material such as that disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,360,656 to Rexfelt, the disclosure of which is incorporated  herein  by  reference,  and  subsequently formed into a full width belt.  The strip can be unwound and wound up on a set of rolls after fully processing. These rolls of belting  materials can be stored and can then be used to form an endless full width structure using, for example,  the teachings of the immediately aforementioned patent.<br>
Properties  of  the  functional  polymeric  resin<br>
material,  such  as  its  resistance  to  wear  and  to<br>
oxidation, are important for the durability of the belt.<br>
In addition to the importance of the curing, setting or<br>
reaction  times  of  the  functional  polymeric  resin<br>
material, as discussed above, the viscosity of the resin<br>
naterial  during delivery to  the belt  may also be<br>
Important  as  aforesaid.  Specifically,  in  another<br>
embodiment  of  the  present  invention,  the  polymer<br>
leposition station 36 comprises a second piezojet array,<br>
.nstead of a bulk-jet array 42. Where a piezojet array<br>
.s used to deposit polymeric resin onto or within the<br>
&gt;ase  substrate  12,  except  in  regions  filled  with<br>
acrificial material,  the choice of polymeric resin<br><br>
material is limited by the requirement that its viscosity be 100 cps (100 centipoise) or less at the time of delivery, that is; when the polymeric resin material is in the nozzle of a piezojet ready for deposition, so that the individual piezojets can provide the polymeric resin material at a constant drop delivery rate.<br>
Polymeric resin materials which may be applied either by piezojet array or by bulk-jet array include those in the following four classes:<br>
1.	Hot melts and moisture-cured hot melts;<br>
2.	Two-part reactive systems based on urethanes<br>
and epoxies;<br>
3.	Photopolymer   compositions   consisting   of<br>
reactive acrylated monomers and acrylated oligomers<br>
derived from urethanes, polyesters, polyethers, and<br>
silicones; and<br>
4.	Aqueous-based  latexes  and  dispersions  and<br>
particle-filled formulations including acrylics and<br>
polyurethanes.<br>
As noted above, a piezojet array is capable of supplying the polymeric resin material in the form of extremely small droplets having an average diameter of IQ/i (10 microns) or more, so long as its viscosity is less than 100 cps (100 centipoise} at the time of delivery. Moreover, the piezojet array can deposit the polymeric resin material with great precision one layer at a time, making it unnecessary to grind the surface of the coating formed thereby to achieve a uniform thickness, and enables one of ordinary skill in the art to control the z-direction geometry of the coating. That is to say, the piezojet array can deposit the polymeric resin material with such precision that the surface will<br><br>
be monoplanar without having to be ground or, alternatively, that the surface will have some predetermined three-dimensional structure. Further, in this embodiment, some of the individual piezojets in the piezojet array may be used to deposit one polymeric resin material, while others may be used to deposit a different polymeric resin material, to produce a surface having microregions of more than one type of polymeric resin material.<br>
Modifications to the above would be obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art, but would not bring the invention so modified beyond the scope of the appended claims. In particular, while piezojets are disclosed above as being used to deposit the sacrificial material, and possibly the functional polymeric resin material, in preselected locations on the base substrate, other means for depositing droplets thereof in the size range desired may be known to those of ordinary skill in the art or may be developed in the future, and such other means may be used in the practice of the present ;invention. For example, in processes requiring a relatively larger scale pattern such that the final elements such as round hemispheres, a relatively large, even a single resin disposition nozzle can comprise the entire jet array. The use of such means would not bring the invention, if practiced therewith, beyond the scope of the appended claims.<br><br><br>
