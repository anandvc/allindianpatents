PIPERAZINYLPYRAZINES COMPOUNDS AS ANTAGONISTS OF SEROTONIN 5.HT2 RECEPTOR.<br>
Field of the Invention The present invention relates to novel compounds, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds, to processes for their preparation, as well as to the use of the compounds for the preparation of a medicament which particularly acts on the central nervous system.<br>
Background of the Invention Many diseases of the central nervous system are influenced by the adrenergic, the dopaminergic, and the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems. For example, serotonin has been implicated in a number of diseases and conditions which originate in the central nervous system. A number of pharmacological and genetic experiments involving receptors for serotonin strongly implicate the 5-HT2c receptor subtype in the regulation of food intake (Obes. Res, 1995. 3, Suppl. 4,449S-462S). The 5-HT2c receptor subtype is transcribed and expressed in hypothalamic structures associated with appetite regulation. It has been demonstrated that the 5-HT2c receptor agonist 7n-chlorophenyIpiperazine (mCPP), which has some preference for the 5-HT2c receptor, reduces food intake in mice that express the normal 5-HT2c receptor while the compound lacks activity in mice expressing the mutated inactive form of the 5-HT2c receptor (Nature 1995,374,542-546). In a recent clinical study, a slight but sustained reduction in body weight was obtained after 2 weeks of treatment with mCPP m obese subjects (Psychopharmacology 1997,133,309-312). Recently, a series of pyrrolo[3,2,l-/y]quinolines derivatives was identified to be 5-HT2C receptor agonists having selectivity over the 5-HT2A receptor (Isaac M., et al., Borg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2000.10^ 919-921). The compounds are said to offer a novel approach to the treatment of obesity and epilepsy.<br>
Weight reduction has also been reported from clinical studies with other "serotonergic" agents (see, e.g., Drugs 1998,1,456-470). For example, the 5-HT reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine and the 5-HT releasing agent/reuptake inhibitor dexfenfluramine have exhibited weight reduction in controlled studies. However,<br><br>
currently available drugs that increase serotonergic transmission appear to have only a moderate and, in some cases, transient effects on the body weight.<br>
The 5-HT2c receptor subtype has also been suggested to be involved in CNS disorders such as depression and anxiety (Exp. Opin. Invest Drugs 1998,7,1587-1599; I Drugs 1999,2,109-120).<br>
The 5-HT2c receptor subtype has further been suggested to be involved in urinary disorders such as urinary incontinence (E)rugs 1999,2,109-120).<br>
Compounds which have a selective effect on the 5-HT2c receptor may therefore have a therapeutic potential in the treatment of disorders like those mentioned above. Of course, selectivity also reduces the potential for adverse effects mediated by other serotonin receptors.<br>

Step 1: 2-Chloro-3"(4 -butoxycarbonyH"piperazinyl)pyrazine. The title compound was prepared according to the procedure described in WO 00/76984. A mixture of 7\/'-BoC"piperazine (11.47 g, 61.5 mmol), K2CO3 (S;5 g, 61 mmol) and 2,3-dichloropyrazine (9.20 g, 61.7 mmol) in acetonitrile (100 mL) was stirred at 100<br>
°C for 40 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated, dissolved in toluene, washed<br>
with water, dried (MgS04), and concentrated. The residue was purified by chromatography on silica gel using toluene/EtOAc (7:3) as eluent to give 18.3 g (100%) of the title product. HRMS miss called for C13H19N4O2 (M)"^ 298.1197, found 298.1206.<br>
Step 2: 2-[3-(4-/e/^-Butoxycarbonyl-l-piperazmyI)-2-pyrazinyloxy] ethanoL The<br>
title compound was prepared according to the procedure described in WO 00/76984. KO-^Bu (9.92 g, 103 mmol) was added to a mixture of the product obtained in step 1 (18.14 g, 60.7 mmol) and ethylene glycol (25 mL, 448 mmol) in pyridine (125 mL) at<br>
85 ^'C. The reaction mixture was stirred for 15 h and then poured into ice-water and extracted with toluene. The organic phase was dried (MgS04) and concentrated. The residue was purified by chromatography on silica gel using toluene/EtOAc (1:1) as eluent to give 16.9 g (85%) of the title product HRMS   for C15H24N4O4 (M)-" 324.1798, found 324.1784.<br>
Step 3: tert’butyl 4-{3-[2-(3-formylphenoxy)ethoxy]-2-pyrazinyl}-l-piperazine carboxylate.<br>
A solution of the compound obtained in step 2 above (1.5 g, 4.7 mmol) in dry tetrahydrofliran (THF; 10 mL) was treated with 3-hydroxybenzaldehyde (0.74 g, 6.06 mmol) and triphenylphosphine (1.59 g, 6,06 mmol). This solution was stirred at room temperature then treated with diethyl azodicarboxylate (0.96 mL, 6.06 mmol) in dry THF (5 mL). After 1 hr, TLC indicated some remaining 2-[3-(4-re?t-butoxycarbonyl-l-pipera2inyl)-2-pyrazinyloxy]ethanol The reaction was heated at reflux under<br><br>
nitrogen for 5 h, then left to cool to room temperature overnight. TLC again showed unreacted starter. The mixture was treated with further triphenylphosphine (0.80 g, 3.03 mmol), diethyl azodicarboxylate (0.5 mL, 3.03 mmol) and S-hydroxybenzal-dehyde (0.40 g, 3.03 mmol), then stirred at RT for a further 3 hrs (reaction complete by TLC). The volatiles were removed in vacuo and the residue was purified by flash column on silica gel, eluting with petroleum ether/ethyl acetate (2:1). This furnished 0.33 g (16%) of the title product as a colourless oil. ^H NMR (CDCI3) 5 1.5 (s, 9H); 3.5 (bs, 8H), 4.45 (m, 2H); 4.75 (m, 2H); 7.2 (d, IH); 7.45 (s, IH); 7.5 (m, 2H); 7.6 (s, IH); 7.75 (s, IH).<br>
Step 4: teri-Bntyl 4-(3-{2-[3-(4-morphoUnylmethyI)phenoxy ethoxy}-2-pyrazinyl)-l-piperazine carboxylate.<br>
A stirred solution of the aldehyde from step 3 above (71.2 mg, 0.166 mmol) in 1 dichloroethane (5 mL) was treated with morpholine (19 mg, 0.22 mmol), 3A molecular sieves and sodium triacetoxyborohydride (52 mg, 0.25 mmol). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 5 h (TLC monitoring). The solution was filtered and the filtrate was treated with an excess of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The ether extracts were separated and dried over magnesium sulfate. The mixture was filtered and solvent was removed in vacuo to give 54 mg (65%) of<br>
the title product as a yellow oil. Pure by NMR. ^H NMR (CDCI3) 5 1.4 (s, 9H); 2,35 (m, 4H); 3.4 (m, lOH); 3.65 (m, 4H); 4.3 (m, 2H); 4.65 (m, 2H); 6.75 (d, IH); 6,9 (m, 2H); 7.2 (t, IH); 7.5 (s, IH); 7.7 (s, IH).<br>
Step 5:2-(l-Pipera2inyI)-3-{2-I3-(4-raorphoIinyImethyl)phenoxy]ethoxy}pyramid,<br>
The product from step 4 above (54 mg, 0,11 mmol) was dissolved in dry ether (20 mL), stirred at room temperature and treated with hydrogen chloride in ether (-€ M; 5 mL), The resulting white suspension was stirred for 2 h, then quickly filtered off. The hydrochloride salt (hygroscopic), was dissolved in water and neutralized with sodium carbonate. The free base was extracted into dichloromethane. The organic layers were dried magnesium sulfat, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo to finish 13 mg (29%) of the title product as a pale yellow oil. LS/MS purity 100%. ^H NMR (CDas) 5 1.8 (b, IH); 2.45 (m, 4H); 2,95 (m, 4H); 3.45 (s, 2H); 3.55 (m, 4H); 3.7<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Affinity assay<br>
The 5-HT2c receptor affinity of compounds in the Examples was determined in competition experiments, where the ability of each compound in serial dilution to displace ^H-labelled 5-HT, bound to membranes prepared from a transfected HEK293 cell line stably expressing the human 5-HT2c receptor protein, was monitored by Scintillation Proximity Assay technology. Non-specific binding was defined using 5 pM mainspring. Results obtained for exemplary compounds of the invention are illustrated in Table 1 below. Typically, the 5HT2c receptor affinity values (Ki, nM) were in the range of 1 nM to 1500 nM, preferably 1 nM to 100 nM.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
