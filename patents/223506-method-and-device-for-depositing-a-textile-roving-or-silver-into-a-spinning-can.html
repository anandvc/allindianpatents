				<th>Full Text</th>

The invention relates to a method for depositing a textile roving or sliver into a spinning can and also to uniform depositing of textile roving or sliver through a sliver duct into a spinning can and to a device for the same.<br>
Methods and devices of this type are known in the textile industry, for the purpose, downstream of a drawframe, of depositing roving or sliver as uniformly as possible into a spinning can  Corresponding devices are found virtually at all the exits of textile drawframes or cards, for the purpose of depositing sliver cycloidally into the can. The cans used may be either round cans or rectangular cans.<br>
In most known devices, the turntable speed and therefore the sliver tension in the sliver duct are set optimally to the delivery speed of the sliver, by the rotational speed of the turntable being coordinated with the conveying speed or delivery speed predetermined by the drawframe and the calender rolls.<br>
Consequently, particularly during the stopping and starting of the drawframe, low sliver tensions may occur, which, in critical situations, may lead to a sliver build-up in the sliver duct. As is known, in order to solve this problem, basically, higher turntable speeds or sliver ducts with a larger cross section are selected. However, these solutions are not conducive to the quality of the sliver.<br>
US 5,595,049 discloses a method and a device for depositing sliver into a can, wherein the rpm-lag between the pressure rolls (calendar rolls) and the coiler head (turntable) is set as a function of the sliver output speed. However the US 5,595,049 discloses that in the range of lower output speeds low lags are used whereas at higher speeds higher lags appear.<br>
US 4,709,452 relates to a method and a device for filling a sliver can, wherein after a starting phase the axis of the can (C2) is shifted away from the axis (CI) of the coiler tube. (See column 2, line 50-68 of the US-Patent.) A change of the lag is not disclosed.<br>
GB 1 485 743 describes an apparatus for distributing slivers inside cans, wherein the duct of the turntable is formed from two tubular portions. Also a change of the lag is not disclosed.<br><br>
Furthermore, during depositing, the problem arises that, although the path covered from the transfer point, that is to say the point of transfer of the sliver from the sliver-duct end into the can, is virtually circular, in most cases the deposited sliver loop does not follow the predetermined path or does not deposit it in the can at the location necessary for optimum can filling. The reason for this is that, as regards a non-round can traversing in a transverse direction and in the case of a rotating can when the sliver is deposited onto the can centre, that is to say the sliver does not spread over the can centre, the exit of the sliver duct or the rotating transfer point has, during one half-revolution of the turntable, a corotating or codirectional speed component relative to the speed vector of the can point vertically below the sliver-duct end, and, during the subsequent half-revolution of the turntable, the two speed components are contrarotating or contradirectional. During the said corotation, the relative speed between the two components is lower, and, for example in the case of a rectangular can, the sliver emerging from the sliver duct is deposited nearer to the can edge. During the contrarotating movement of the turntable and can, the situation is similar, except that the sign is reversed, that is to say, in the case of a rectangular can, depositing takes place further away from the can edge. Even where round cans are concerned, similar problems arise when the sliver is deposited over the centre. When the sliver is deposited in this way, there is always corotation or always contrarotation, but, here too, the fluctuations in relative speed, that is to say the difference between the said speed components, and consequently non-uniform sliver depositing occur.<br>
Moreover, undesirable, what may be referred to as chimneys occur as a further consequence of non-uniform sliver depositing.<br><br>
The object of the present invention is to avoid the abovementioned disadvantages and to optimize sliver depositing into a can.<br>
The advantages of the invention, in terms of its first aspect, are, above all, that, particularly during running phases of the drawframe which do not correspond to the uniform sliver delivery, an optimized sliver tension can be set in the sliver duct and therefore sliver build-ups can be prevented. It is possible, furthermore, basically to select sliver ducts with a smaller diameter. A larger sliver weight range could likewise be covered by a single sliver-duct diameter.<br>
In particular, the speed ratio of the turntable to the calender rolls during the starting and/or stopping phase of the drawframe is selected higher than during the sliver production phase having a constant delivery speed. As a result, sliver already or still being transported into the sliver duct can be transported smoothly out of the sliver duct into the can. Sliver build-ups in these critical phases no longer occur. The machine runs more accurately and with fewer actions taken by operating personnel. Preferably, the calender rolls and the turntable are driven by separate drives. It is particularly -<br><br>
preferred, in this case, to use an individual drive for the turntable. The advantage of this is that there is no need for a maintenance-intensive drive with belts, for example flat belts, which are normally connected to a main motor of the drawframe.<br>
The invention, in terms of its first to fourth aspect, can be employed, irrespective of the type of spinning can used. The can may, for example, have a round or a rectangular cross section. The raising and lowering of the can bottom before the filling or during the filling of the can with sliver can be carried out by means of springs in the can or by lifting means which are external or internal, that is to say moveable in the can interior.<br>
The advantage of the invention, in terms of the second to fifth aspect of the invention, are, in particular, that different variants are proposed, by means of which the adverse effects of the usually sinusoidal fluctuations in the relative speed or of difference between the parallel or anti-parallel speeds of the can-side sliver-duct end and the can point located below it can be compensated. As regards cans traversing back and forth and in the case of round cans when depositing onto the centre takes place, therefore, the corotating and contrarotating or codirectional and contradirectional speed components can be compensated. When round cans are used for depositing a sliver over the can centre, the invention can likewise be employed, provided that the position of the can-side sliver-duct end in relation to the turntable is taken into account correspondingly.<br>
It was recognized, according to the second or third aspect  of  the  invention,  that  a  non-uniform  and, moreover,  not positionally optimum sliver depositing can be avoided by the relative speeds of the turntable<br><br>
or sliver duct, on the one hand, and the can, on the other hand, being influenced.<br>
According to the second aspect of the invention, which can be employed in the case of cans traversing back and forth and in the case of round cans when a sliver is deposited onto the centre, in particular, the rotational speed of the turntable is varied during a revolution of the turntable, in that the rotational speed of the motor driving the turntable is changed. If the transfer point and the can, both lying on the same vertical axis (vertical projection of the transfer point onto the can), each have a speed component of the same direction, the turntable speed is preferably increased, in order to increase the relative or differential speed. In the case of contrarotation of the transfer point and the can, the turntable speed is preferably reduced, in order to reduce the relative or differential speed. A constant relative or differential speed is optimally achieved in this way.<br>
Preferably, in relation to an average rotational speed, the turntable is accelerated during the half-period of corotation and braked during the half-period of contrarotation. The speed vector runs through preferably a positive sine half-wave in the acceleration phase and preferably a negative sine half-wave in the braking phase. The sinusoidal oscillation moves about the average value of the turntable rotational speed. The two half-waves adjoin one another continuously, so as to repeat during the next revolution of the turntable. This results in a continuous movement of the turntable with successive acceleration and braking phases with a sinusoidal speed profile, against the background of a continuous rotation of the turntable in one direction of rotation.<br>
The change in the rotational speeds of the turntable is preferably implemented by the drive for the turntable<br><br>
being designed as an individual drive. Preferably, for this purpose, a correspondingly activated electric motor is used, which can accomplish the appropriate rapidity in the speed changes.<br>
According to the third aspect of the invention, instead of or in addition to a change in rotational speed of the turntable, alternatively the speed profile of the can may be changed. In this case, too, the drive for the can is designed preferably as an activated individual drive.<br>
If round cans are used, in which corotation and contrarotation alternate only when sliver is deposited onto the centre, but are not possible when sliver is deposited over the centre, the can is moved preferably more slowly than the average can rotational speed in the case of corotation of the sliver-duct end and of its vertical projection onto the can, but preferably more quickly in the case of contrarotation.<br>
Where a rectangular can is concerned, the translational speed of the can is preferably reduced in the case of corotation and is preferably increased in the case of contrarotation. This results, overall, in a continuous sequence of acceleration and braking phases of the can, these two phases being produced both in one and in the other translational direction of the can displacement.<br>
The speed profile of the can is advantageously such that the- relative speed of the can runs through a negative sinusoidal semi-oscillation (braking) during the half-period of corotation of the two speed components and through a positive sinusoidal semi-oscillation (acceleration) during the half-period of contrarotation. Against the background of an average translational speed as offset, the sinusoidal speed profile of the can in this case then compensates the sinusoidal  profile  of  the  relative  vector  of  the<br><br>
transfer point or sliver-duct end, on the one hand, and a turntable axis, on the other hand, held to be responsible for the non-uniform sliver depositing.<br>
According to the fourth aspect of the invention, the conveying speed of the sliver is changed in order to avoid the non-uniform sliver depositing. In this case, preferably, the conveying speed is increased or reduced, depending on the position of the can-side sliver-duct end. In the case of non-round cans or in the case of round cans (with the sliver being deposited onto the centre), the conveying speed is preferably higher when the speed component of the can-side sliver-duct end, on the one hand, and the speed vector of the vertical projection of the sliver-duct end onto the can, on the other hand, point in the same direction, and conversely in the case of contrarotation. In the case of round cans and when a sliver is deposited over the centre, the conveying speed is to be varied as a function of the distance of the can-side sliver-duct end from the can wall.<br>
Preferably, the conveying speed is likewise varied sinusoidally. In this case, the sliver is conveyed with a positive sinusoidal semi-oscillation, that is to say it leaves the calender rolls located upstream of the sliver duct at a higher than average speed in the case of the said corotation. In contrast to this, in the case of contrarotation of the said speed vectors, the sliver is transported more slowly. Alternatively, the calender rolls transport the sliver at a constant speed at the exit of the drawframe, whilst the sliver is transported into the can at a varying speed by a conveying means intended for conveying the sliver and arranged downstream of the calender rolls. The average conveying speed of the said conveying means is in this case essentially equal to the delivery speed by the calender rolls. The sliver should in this case not be tautly tensioned, since the sliver would otherwise be<br><br>
distorted during a turntable half-revolution. The sliver must therefore constantly sag slightly, or a sliver store is used between the calender rolls and the conveying means.<br>
According to the fifth aspect of the invention, which can be employed in the case of non-round cans, the pressure force exerted by the can bottom or portions of the can bottom is periodically increased and reduced.<br>
A preferred variant of the invention according to the fifth aspect, the can bottom is tilted in relation to the can longitudinal axis and this tilting is maintained preferably during the movement of the rectangular can from one corner point to the other. During the subsequent return displacement, the can bottom is then tilted to the other side about the can longitudinal axis. The pressure force in this case determines the degree of tilting. An optimum pressure force can thereby be obtained under the corotation and contrarotation conditions alternating cyclically during a turntable revolution.<br>
In a further preferred variant, an increase in pressure force on the horizontally oriented can bottom, as compared with the average pressure force, is carried out when the said speed components are codirectional. During the second turntable half-revolution, that is to say when the said speed components are contradirectional, according to the invention the pressure force is lowered, as compared with the average pressure force. The increase and the lowering of the pressure force are preferably applied sinusoidally.<br>
According to the invention, the periodic variation in 'the can pressure force is carried out by a lifting means arranged outside the can and acting on the can bottom. Lifting means of this type are known from the prior  art,  for  example  from  DE 198 13 538.6,  the<br><br>
disclosure content of which is also included herewith. In this case, according to the invention, advantageously by means of magnetic and/or electric and/or pneumatic force action on the can bottom, the pressure force of the can bottom or on the uppermost deposited sliver loop can be varied as a result of the tilting of the can bottom or of the raising or lowering of the can bottom.<br>
Preferably, the device according to the invention has, according to its various aspects, a control and/or regulating device for controlling and/or regulating the speeds of the turntable or of the can or of the sliver conveyance or of the can pressure force. A computer is preferably used in this case.<br>
Advantageous developments of the invention are characterized by the features of the subclaims.<br>

Fig. 5a,b,c   show diagrammatical illustrations of a<br>
longitudinal view, a transverse view and a top view of a rectangular can with a second tilting means for tilting the can bottom.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a round can 30 with rising side walls 31 and with a lower can wall 32. Arranged centrally in the can 30 is at least one helical spring 34 which acts on a can bottom 33 vertically moveable in the can 30. The can bottom 33 is connected to a can-side retaining cord 35, one end of which is fastened to the lower can wall 32 on the inside of the can.<br>
A standing surface 36 for the can 30 is set in rotational movement by means of a drive train 37 and a driving wheel, not illustrated, so that the can 30 likewise rotates during the depositing of the sliver 25, specifically at a uniform rotational speed.<br>
Arranged above the can bottom 33 is a turntable 10, through which runs a curved sliver duct 5, the can-side end 7 of which runs eccentrically both to the centre axis Ml of the can 30 and to the centre axis M2 of the turntable 10. Sliver 25 is transported through the sliver duct 5 by calender rolls 27, located downstream of an exit of a drawframe, not illustrated, and is deposited in loop form on the can bottom 33 or onto the already deposited sliver loops. The calender rolls 27 are connected to a main motor 20 of the drawframe via belts, for example flat belts.<br>
The turntable 10 is driven via a drive train 11 which is operatively connected to a driving wheel 12. The driving wheel 12 is  in this case connected to an<br><br>
individual drive 13 which is preferably designed as an electric motor and which can be activated via a control and/or regulation 14.<br>
The speed ratio of the calender rolls 27 to the turntable 10 is constant during normal operation, that is to say at a constant delivery speed. Particularly during the starting and stopping of the drawframe, however, relatively more sliver 25 is delivered into the sliver duct 5 than at a constant delivery speed. In these phases, therefore, the turntable 10 in actual fact rotates too slowly. According to the invention, the speed ratio of the turntable 10 and calender rolls 27 is increased, particularly at these times, in order to transport the excess sliver 25 out of the sliver duct 5 into the can 30.<br>
In order to set this changed speed ratio, the control or regulation 14 is preferably used. This receives, for example via a line 21, a signal from the drive 20 driving the calender rolls 27, in order to stipulate to the drive 13 the appropriate rotational speed for the turntable 10. When the delivery speed for the sliver 25 reaches a constant value, the speed ratio of the calender rolls 27 and the turntable 10 is likewise set at a constant value, in order to ensure a uniform transport of the sliver 25 through the sliver duct 5.<br>
When the drawframe is started, the control or regulation 14, taking into account the increase according to the invention of the speed ratio of the turntable 10 to the calender rolls 27, either predetermines constant rotational speed of the turntable 10 or else sets the turntable rotational speed according to the start-up speed of the motor 20, either by means of control steps or, with feedback to the motor 20, by means of closed-loop steps.<br><br>
A similar procedure is adopted when the drawframe is stopped. Taking into account the increase according to the invention in the speed ratio of the turntable 10 to the calender rolls 27 during or after stopping, the control or regulation 14 predetermines either constant or variable rotational speed for the turntable 10.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates diagrammatically which speed components play a part in the depositing of sliver into a spinning can. For the sake of simplicity, the situation is explained with reference to a rectangular can 30. The statements may, however, also be applied accordingly to a round can. In this case, depositing onto the centre or depositing over the centre may take place. It must then be taken into account that, in the case of depositing onto the centre, as in the case of a rectangular can, corotation and contrarotation also occur, whereas, in the case of depositing over the centre, always corotation or always contrarotation occurs. Depending on fluctuations in the relative or differential speed of the can-side sliver-duct end and the can projection point located below it, the corresponding higher or lower speeds, as compared with the respective average speed must then be selected.<br>
The rectangular can 30 illustrated in a top view in Fig. 2 is moved back and forth at the speed VK in order to deposit a sliver (not illustrated) . Near the reversal point of this back-and-forth movement, the can is slowed correspondingly, in order then to be accelerated again to the normal speed in the other direction. The sliver is deposited into the can 30 from above through a curved sliver duct 5, the sliver duct 5 being fastened in a turntable 10. In order to achieve a sinusoidal depositing of the sliver, the turntable 10 is set in rotational movement, so that the translational movements of the can 30 and the rotational movement of the turntable 10 give rise, in total, to the desired loop shape of the sliver.<br><br>
Fig. 2 illustrates two different instantaneous recordings of positions of the sliver duct 5. In one position of the sliver duct 5, the upper position in Fig. 2, the can-side end 7 of the sliver duct 5 moves in the same direction as the can 30, specifically at the tangential speed VBK which is illustrated as being broken down into two speed components, on the one hand, into a component VBK,P parallel to the speed vector of the can VR and, on the other hand, into a component VBK,s perpendicular to VR. This parallelism of VBK.P and VR designates what may be referred to as the situation of corotation, that is to say the speed component VBK,P of the can-side sliver-duct end or, in other words, of the transition point, on the one hand, and the speed vector of the sliver-duct end projected onto the can, on the other hand, pointing in the same direction at this time point.<br>
The position of the sliver duct 5 which is the lower position in Fig. 2 shows the situation of contrarotation of the sliver-duct end 7 and of the can 30. The speed vector VBK is divided, here, into an ante-parallel component VBK,a and a perpendicular component VBK,S to VR. The transmission from corotation to contrarotation, and vice versa, is marked by the line L.<br>
It became clear that the sliver is deposited nearer to the can longitudinal edge during the said corotation than in the case of contrarotation. The reason for this is that the relative speed between the can and the transfer point are not optimal. Various possibilities for optimizing the speeds are discussed below. An attempt is preferably made, in this case, to compensate the sinusoidal fluctuations of the said relative or differential speed, by superposing on this sine function a cosine function with, as far as possible, the same amplitude and the same wavelength, so that the<br><br>
relative or differential speed acquires as constant a value as possible.<br>
The invention, according to its second aspect, can be explained by means of Fig. 1 (in this case, the setting, discussed above, of independent speed ratios with a turntable and calender rolls not at the forefront). During the above-described corotation phase of the can 30 and sliver-duct end 7 or transfer point, according to the invention the turntable 10 is driven at a higher than average turntable rotational speed. During the contrarotation phase, that is to say during the subsequent half-revolution of the turntable 10, the speed of the latter is reduced, as compared with its average rotational speed, in order then to be accelerated again subsequently. The speed of the turntable 10 or of the sliver-duct end 7 preferably has a sinusoidal profile about its average rotational speed. These functions are controlled or regulated preferably by the control or regulation 14.<br>
The device illustrated in Fig. 3 is virtually identical to that of Fig. 1. The only essential difference is that the standing surface 36 for the can 30 is driven by means of an individual drive 38 via a driving wheel 35 and a drive frame 37. The individual drive 38, preferably designed as an electric motor, is connected to a control or regulation 14. This design makes it possible for the standing surface 36 and consequently the can 30 to experience both a faster and a slower rotational movement, as compared with the mean or average - can rotational speed, during a turntable revolution 10.<br>
In order to achieve an optimized depositing of the sliver 25 in the can 30, the drive 38 for the can 30 is controlled or regulated via the control or regulation 14, in such a way that, during the corotation of the sliver-duct end 7 and the can point<br><br>
located below it, the can 3D is driven more slowly and preferably with a speed profile corresponding to the negative sinusoidal semi-oscillation, as compared with the mean can rotational speed. During contrarotation, the can 30 is driven more quickly and preferably with a speed profile corresponding to the positive sinusoidal semi-oscillation, as compared with the mean can rotational speed.<br>
In a design variant of the invention, the sliver 25 is conveyed more quickly during one half-revolution of the turntable 10 and more slowly during the other half-revolution than the mean conveying speed. For this purpose, the calender rolls 27 are not driven at a constant speed, but according to the variation in the conveying speed. For this purpose, the rotational speed of the main motor 20 (see Fig. 1) of the upstream drawframe is varied correspondingly. Alternatively, the conveying speed for the sliver leaving the drawframe remains constant 25; it is then necessary to have a further conveying means for the sliver 25 downstream of the calender rolls, with a sliver store located between them, this conveying means bringing about the desired fluctuations in the conveying speed.<br>
Figures 4 and 5 illustrate various lifting means for the can bottom 33, by which the pressure force of the can bottom 33 or of portions of the can bottom 33 in the direction of the underside of the turntable 10 (not illustrated for the sake of clarity) can be set.<br>
In a diagrammatic illustration of Fig. 4 with a longitudinal view (Fig. 4a), a transverse view (Fig. 4b) and a top view (Fig. 4c) of a rectangular can 30, a lifting means known per se is provided, having carrying , supports 42 which engage through slots 39 on the narrow sides 31a of the can 30 under the can bottom 33, in order to move the can bottom 33 downwards or upwards during  filling with sliver or<br><br>
before a new filling. According to the invention, the can bottom 33 is tiltable about the can longitudinal axis A, this being capable of being implemented, for example, by means of a gripping device 40 pivotable about an axis S and engaging from outside on grips 45 of the lifting device.<br>
This tilting device tilts the can bottom 33 preferably to one side during the movement of the can 30 in one direction of displacement and to the other side during the movement of the can 30 in the other direction of displacement, so that the pressure force exerted by the raised can-bottom portion is increased during corotation conditions and the pressure force exerted by the lowered can-bottom portion is reduced during contrarotation conditions.<br>
An alternative embodiment of a tilting device is illustrated in Fig. 5a, 5b and 5c. In this case, magnetic forces exerted by magnets 50 from outside the can 30 act on magnets 52 arranged on the can inside, the magnets 50, 52 extending along the can longitudinal wall 31b. Such magnetic raising and lowering devices are known, for example, from DE 198 13 538.6. By the magnets 50 being appropriately activated (control means not illustrated), according to the invention the can bottom 33 can be tilted about the longitudinal axis A, as in the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 4.<br>
In addition, the tilting movement of the can bottom 33 may have superposed on it a can pivoting movement about the can longitudinal axis A, as described, for example, in EP 681 980.<br>
In modifications of the embodiments of Fig. 4 and 5, these modifications not being illustrated, the can bottom 33 is not tilted, but, instead, is moved in a horizontal position, during one turntable half-revolution under corotation conditions,  a little<br><br>
way upwards in order to increase a pressure force and, during the other turntable half-revolution in the case of contrarotation, a little way downwards in order to lower the pressure force. This cyclic upward and downward movement of the can bottom thus has a period of one can revolution, whilst the tilting devices according to Fig. 4 and 5 have a period of essentially the duration of a can displacement from one end point to the other end point and back again.<br>
A combination of the various aspects of the invention is also possible.<br>
The invention can be used for a wide variety of areas of the textile industry, for example, in addition to drawframes, also in the case of cards.<br><br><br>
