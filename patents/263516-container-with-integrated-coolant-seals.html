				<td>CONTAINER WITH INTEGRATED COOLANT SEALS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	The invention relates to a container for holding and transporting parts<br>
through a dip coating process. More particularly, the invention is directed to a<br>
container having integrated coolant channel seals to militate against the entry of a<br>
fluid into the coolant channels of a fuel cell plate assembly during the dip coating<br>
process.<br>
BACKGROUND SUMMARY<br>
[0002]	Fuel cell systems are increasingly being used as a power source in a<br>
wide variety of applications. Fue cell systems have been proposed for use in power<br>
consumers, such as vehicles, as a replacement for internal combustion engines, for<br>
example. Fuel cells are electrochemical devices which combine a fuel such as<br>
hydrogen and an oxidant such as oxygen to produce electricity. The oxygen is<br>
typically supplied by an air stream. The hydrogen and oxygen combine to result in<br>
the formation of water. Other fuels can be used such as natural gas, methanol,<br>
gasoline, and coal-derived synthetic fuels, for example.<br>
[0003]	The basic process employed by the fuel cell system is efficient,<br>
substantially pollution-free, quiet, free from moving parts (other than an air<br>
compressor, cooling fans, pumps and actuators), and may be constructed to leave<br>
only heat and water as by-products. The term "fuel cell" is typically used to refer to<br>
either a single cell or a plurality of cells depending upon the context in which it is<br>
used. The plurality of cells is typically bundled together and arranged to form a<br>
stack with the plurality of cells commonly arranged in electrical series. Since single<br>
fuel cells can be assembled into stacks of varying sizes, systems can be designed to<br>
produce a desired energy output level providing flexibility of design for different<br>
applications.<br>
[0004]	Different fuel cell types can be provided such as phosphoric acid,<br>
alkaline, molten carbonate, solid oxide, and proton exchange membrane (PEM), for<br><br>
example. The basic components of a PEM-type fuel cell are two electrodes<br>
separated by a polymer membrane electrolyte. Each electrode is coated on one<br>
side with a thin catalyst layer. The electrodes, catalyst, and membrane together<br>
form a membrane electrode assembly (MEA).<br>
[0005]	In a typical PEM-type fuel cell, the MEA is sandwiched between<br>
"anode" and "cathode" diffusion mediums (hereinafter "DM's") or diffusion layers that<br>
are formed from a resilient, conductive, and gas permeable material such as carbon<br>
fabric or paper. The DM's serve as the primary current collectors for the anode and<br>
cathode, as well as provide mechanical support for the MEA. The DM's and MEA's<br>
are pressed between a pair of electronically conductive plates which serve as<br>
secondary current collectors for collecting the current from the primary current<br>
collectors. The plates conduct current between adjacent cells internally of the stack<br>
in the case of bipolar plates and conduct current externally of the stack (in the case<br>
of monopolar plates at the end of the stack).<br>
[0006]	The bipolar plates typically include two thin, facing metal sheets. One<br>
of the sheets defines a flow path on one outer surface thereof for delivery of the fuel<br>
to the anode of the MEA. An outer surface of the other sheet defines a flow path for<br>
the oxidant for delivery to the cathode side of the MEA. When the metal sheets are<br>
joined, the joined surfaces define a flow path for a cooling fluid. The plates are<br>
typically produced from a formable metal that provides suitable strength, electrical<br>
conductivity, and corrosion resistance, such as 316L alloy stainless steel, for<br>
example.<br>
[0007]	The bipolar plates may include at least one coating applied to the<br>
exterior. Typically, the at least or e coating is applied using a dipping process. During<br>
the dipping process, the bipolar plates are submerged in at least one tank of fluid.<br>
Any amount of fluid that enters the coolant channels significantly affects the contact<br>
resistance and the uniformity of the current distribution throughout the active area of<br>
the bipolar plate, rendering the bipolar plate substantially unsuitable for Stack builds.<br>
Therefore, the coolant channels of the bipolar plates are sealed during the dipping<br><br>
process. Generally, the fluid is prevented from entering the coolant channels by<br>
manually securing metal seal blocks over the coolant channel headers using a<br>
plurality of fasteners.<br>
[0008]	Such seal blocks require the use of additional equipment and tools to<br>
seal the coolant channels from the fluid. The additional equipment is excessively<br>
heavy and easily susceptible to improper installation.<br>
[0009]	It would be desirable to produce a container having integrated coolant<br>
seals for militating against entry of a fluid into internal coolant channels of bipolar<br>
plates during a dip coating process, wherein the container is economical to produce<br>
and the complexity of production and use thereof is minimized.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0010]	According to the present invention, a container having integrated<br>
coolant seals for militating against entry of a fluid into internal coolant channels of<br>
bipolar plates during a dip coating process, wherein the container is economical to<br>
produce and the complexity of production and use thereof is minimized, has<br>
surprisingly been discovered.<br>
[0011]	In one embodiment, the container system comprises a first plate; a<br>
second plate spaced from the first plate and movable in respect of the first plate; at<br>
least one rail extending between the first plate and the second plate, the rail having<br>
a plurality of seal blocks disposed thereon; and at least one band adapted to<br>
interconnect the first plate, the second plate, and the seal blocks.<br>
[0012]	In another embodiment, the container comprises a first outer plate; a<br>
second outer plate spaced from the first plate; at least one rail extending between<br>
the first outer plate and the second outer plate, the rail having a plurality of seal<br>
blocks disposed thereon; a first inner plate disposed on the rail; a second inner plate<br>
spaced from the first inner plate and linearly movable in respect to the first inner<br>
plate, wherein the first inner plate and the second inner plate are disposed on the rail<br>
intermediate the first outer plate and the second outer plate, and wherein the seal<br><br>
blocks are disposed on the rail intermediate the first inner plate and the second inner<br>
plate; and a band adapted to interconnect the first inner plate, the second inner<br>
plate, the first outer plate, and the steal blocks.<br>
[0013]	In another embodiment, the container for a dip coating process<br>
comprises a first plate having a plurality of apertures formed therein; a second plate<br>
spaced from the first plate and linearly movable in respect to the first plate, the<br>
second plate having a plurality of apertures formed therein; at least one rail<br>
extending between the first plate and the second plate, the rail having a plurality of<br>
apertures formed therein and a plurality of seal blocks disposed thereon, wherein<br>
each of the seal blocks includes a fastening portion adapted to be received on the<br>
rail and a sealing portion adapted to be removeably attached to the fastening<br>
portion, the sealing portion including at least one seal disposed thereon; a band<br>
adapted to interconnect the first plate, the second plate, and the seal blocks; and a<br>
clamp to militate against movement of the second plate relative to the first plate.<br>

be employed and affixed elsewhere on the container 10, as desired.<br>
[0023]	The plates 12, 14 are generally rectangular in shape, each having a first<br>
end 30 and a second end 32. The ends 30, 32 may include a slot 34 formed in an<br>
outer edge thereof and a leg portion 36 extending downwardly therefrom. The slot<br><br>
34 is adapted to receive one of the guide rails 16,18 therein. The leg portion 36<br>
includes a protuberance 38 extending laterally outwardly therefrom to form a ledge<br>
39. The ledge 39 is adapted to seat on a lip 40 of a tank 41, shown in Fig. 4. The<br>
tank 41 is adapted to hold a fluid (not shown) such as a cleansing fluid, a rinsing<br>
fluid, and a coating fluid, for example, therein. The plates 12, 14 may include a<br>
handle 42 disposed on an outer surface thereof, a handle 44 disposed on an upper<br>
surface thereof, and a plurality of apertures 46 formed therein to reduce a mass of<br>
the container 10 and allow the fluid to flow therethrough. Any conventional material<br>
may be used to produce the plates 12,14 such as a plastic and a metal, for<br>
example, which is compatible with the fluid.<br>
[0024]	The guide rails 16,18 have a first end 48 and a second end 50. A<br>
tenon 52 is formed on the guide rails 16,18 and extends laterally outwardly from an<br>
upper surface and a lower surface of the guide rails 16, 18. The tenon 52 extends<br>
from the first end 48 to the second end 50 of the guide rails 16, 18 substantially<br>
parallel to a longitudinal axis theroof. In the embodiment shown, the first end 48 of<br>
each of the guide rails 16, 18 is d sposed in respective slots 34 of the ends 30, 32 of<br>
the first plate 12 and affixed therein. Apertures 53 are formed by the mating of the<br>
slots 27 of the hook portion 26 of the clamp 24 and the slots 34 of the second plate<br>
14. The second end 50 of each of the guide rails 16, 18 is slideably disposed in<br>
respective apertures 53 of the ends 30, 32 of the second plate 14. The guide rails<br>
16,18 may include a plurality of apertures 54 formed therein to reduce the mass of<br>
the container 10 and allow the flow of the fluid therethrough.<br>
[0025]	The support rails 20, 22 include a first end 56 and a second end 58.<br>
Apertures 59 adapted to receive the second end 58 of the support rails 20, 22 are<br>
formed in the ends 30, 32 of the s.econd plate 14. Additional apertures 59 adapted to<br>
receive the first end 56 of the support rails 20, 22 are formed in the ends 30, 32 of<br>
the first plate 12. The first end 56 of each of the support rails 20, 22 is disposed in<br>
respective apertures 59 of the ends 30, 32 of the first plate 12 and affixed therein.<br><br>
The second end 58 of each the support rails 20, 22 is slideably disposed in<br>
respective apertures 59 of the erds 30, 32 of the second plate 14.<br>
[0026]	A plurality of spacec apart seal blocks 60, as shown in Fig. 2, is<br>
disposed on the guide rails 16, 13. The seal blocks 60 and the plates 12, 14 are<br>
interconnected by at least one band 61. The band 61 is adapted to cause the seal<br>
blocks 60 to separate when the container 10 is returned to an open position. The<br>
band 61 is produced from a flexible material such as polyethylene terephthalate<br>
(PET), for example. In the embodiment shown, the band 61 is affixed to the seal<br>
blocks 60 and the plates 12, 14 by a plurality of fasteners. It is understood that the<br>
band 61 can be affixed by any conventional method such as gluing and the like, for<br>
example.<br>
[0027]	As clearly illustrated in Fig. 2, each seal block 60 includes a fastening<br>
portion 62 and a sealing portion 64. The fastening portion 62, adapted to facilitate<br>
an interchange of the sealing portion 64, is slideably disposed on one of the guide<br>
rails 16, 18. It is understood that the fastening portion 62 and the sealing portion 64<br>
can be joined by any conventional method, or the seal block 60 can be formed as a<br>
unitary piece, if desired. A first elongate mortise 66 is formed in an edge of the<br>
fastening portion 62. The mortise 66 is adapted to receive the tenon 52 of the guide<br>
rails 16, 18 therein. An interlocking joint is created by the mating of the tenon 52<br>
and the first mortise 66. A second mortise 68 formed in another edge of the<br>
fastening portion 62 extends substantially parallel to a vertical axis thereof. The<br>
second mortise 68 includes an upoer portion having a cavity 70 formed therein.<br>
[0028]	The sealing portion 64 is generally rectangular in shape and includes a<br>
tenon 72 formed on an edge thereof. The tenon 72 extends substantially parallel to a<br>
vertical axis of the sealing portion 64 and is adapted to be received in the mortise 68<br>
of the fastening portion 62. An interlocking joint is created by the mating of the<br>
mortise 68 and the tenon 72. A tab 74 extends laterally outwardly from the tenon 72<br>
and is adapted to be received in the cavity 70 of the fastening portion 62. The tab<br>
74 is formed to facilitate an alignment of the fastening portion 62 with the sealing<br><br>
portion 64 and a retention therewith. In the embodiment shown, a seal 76 (also<br>
illustrated by phantom lines) is disposed on a periphery of at least one of a first face<br>
and a second face of the sealing portion 64 of the seal blocks 60. The seal 76 may<br>
be produced from any conventional material such as rubber, for example. In the<br>
embodiment shown, the seal blocks 60 are produced from polytretrafluoroethylene<br>
(PTFE) to facilitate slideable contact with the guide rails 16, 18 and militate against<br>
an accumulation of the fluid. Wher the container 10 is in the open position as shown<br>
in Fig. 1, an opening 78 is formed between each of the adjacent seal blocks 60. The<br>
opening 78 is adapted to receive a bipolar plate 80 therein, as illustrated in Fig. 3.<br>
The bipolar plate 80 includes at least one coolant channel header (not shown)<br>
formed therein.<br>
[0029]	The container 10 may include at least one pair of spaced apart arms 82<br>
having a cross-member 84 extenc ing therebetween. In the embodiment shown, the<br>
cross-member 84 is secured to the container 10 by a plurality of fasteners such as<br>
screws, bolts, and the like, for example. The arms 82 having a generally U-shaped<br>
cross-section, are adapted to receive a coupon 86 therein. The coupon 86 is<br>
adapted for testing at least one of an adherence of the fluid to the bipolar plate 80 and<br>
a formulation thereof. The coupor 86 is disposed in the arms 82 of the container 10 to<br>
span at least one of the apertures 46 formed in the plates 12,14 to facilitate surface<br>
contact with the fluid. A closure 88 is adapted to removeably secure the coupon 86 in<br>
the arms 82. In the embodiment shown, the closure 88 includes a knob 90 affixed to an<br>
end portion 92 slideably disposed in an elongate aperture 100.<br>
[0030]	In operation, the coupon 86 is inserted into the arms 82 and secured<br>
therein by the closure 88. The bipolar plates 80 are then disposed in the openings<br>
78 of the container 10 with a bottom edge in slideable contact with the support rails<br>
20, 22. Thereafter, the second plate 14 of the container 10 with the hook portion 26<br>
of the clamp 24 disposed thereon is caused to slide along the guide rails 16,18 in a<br>
direction towards the first plate 12, thereby causing the seal 76 of each of the seal<br>
blocks 60 to contact a surface of the bipolar plates 80 surrounding the coolant<br><br>
channel header of each of the bipolar plates 80. The latch portion 28 of the clamp<br>
24 is positioned on the hook portion 26 of the clamp 24. The lever 29 of clamp 24 is<br>
then actuated to urge the second plate 14 towards the first plate 12 and move the<br>
container 10 to a closed position, as shown in Fig. 4. The actuation of clamp 24<br>
compresses the bipolar plates 80 between the seal blocks 60 to form a substantially<br>
fluid-tight seal therebetween.<br>
[0031]	Using the handle 44 disposed on the plates 12, 14, the container 10<br>
including the bipolar plates 80 is lifted and disposed in the tank 41 of fluid.<br>
Thereafter, as illustrated in Fig. 4, the container 10 is removed from the tank 41 and<br>
the ledge 39 is seated on the lip 40 of the tank 41. Excess fluid is caused to drain by<br>
gravity and drip from the container' 0 and the bipolar plates 80 into the tank 41. Any<br>
remaining fluid on the bipolar plates 80 is allowed to dry. It is understood that the<br>
container 10 can be disposed in additional tanks of other fluids during the dip coating<br>
process as desired. Once the fluid has dried, the clamp 24 is released. The second<br>
plate 14 is caused to move in an opposite direction away from the first plate 12,<br>
permitting the bipolar plates 80 anc the seal blocks 60 to separate, and return the<br>
container 10 to the open position. The handle 42 disposed on the plates 12, 14 of<br>
the container 10 may be used to assist in opening the container 10, if desired. The<br>
bipolar plates 80 are removed from the container 10 and the coupon 86 is removed<br>
from the arms 82.<br>
[0032]	Figs. 5 and 6 show another embodiment of the invention which includes a<br>
container similar to that shown in Figs. 1, 3, and 4. Reference numerals for similar<br>
structure in respect of the description of Figs. 1,2,3, and 4 are repeated in Figs. 5 and<br>
6 with a prime (') symbol.<br>
[0033]	Fig. 5 shows a continer 10'. The container 10' includes a first outer<br>
plate 12' and a spaced apart second outer plate 14'. A first guide rail 16' and a<br>
spaced apart second guide rail 18' are disposed between the first plate 12' and the<br>
second plate 14'. A first support rail 20' and a spaced apart second support rail 22'<br>
also extend between the first plate 12' and the second plate 14'. The container 10'<br><br>
also includes a first inner plate 110 and a spaced apart second inner plate 112<br>
disposed on the guide rails 16', 18'. At least one clamp 24', adapted to militate<br>
against movement of the second inner plate 112 relative to the first inner plate 110,<br>
is disposed on the container 10'. In the embodiment shown, the clamp 24' is a<br>
toggle clamp including a hook portion 26' having a slot 27' formed therein and a latch<br>
portion 28' provided with a lever 29' thereon It is understood that other clamps types<br>
can be employed and affixed elsewhere on the container 10', as desired.<br>
[0034]	The outer plates 12', 14' are generally rectangular in shape, each<br>
having a first end 30' and a second end 32'. The ends 30', 32' may include a slot 34'<br>
formed in an outer edge thereof and a leg portion 36' extending downwardly<br>
therefrom. The slot 34' is adaptec to receive one of the guide rails 16', 18' therein.<br>
The leg portion 36' includes a protuberance 38' extending laterally outwardly<br>
therefrom to form a ledge 39'. The ledge 39' is adapted to seat on a lip 40' of a tank<br>
41', shown in Fig. 6. The tank 41' is adapted to hold a fluid (not shown) such as a<br>
cleansing fluid, a rinsing fluid, and a coating fluid, for example, therein. The outer<br>

elongate mortise (not shown) is formed in an edge of the fastening portion 62'. The<br>
mortise is adapted to receive the tenon 52' of the guide rails 16', 18' therein. An<br>
interlocking joint is created by the mating of the tenon 52' and the mortise.<br>
[0040]	In the embodiment shown, the sealing portion 64' is generally<br>
rectangular in shape and include * a seal 76' disposed on a periphery of at least one<br>
of a first face and a second face hereof. The seal 76' may be produced from any<br>
conventional material such as rubber, for example. In the embodiment shown, the<br>
seal blocks 60' are produced fron polytretrafluoroethylene (PTFE) to facilitate<br>
slideable contact with the guide rails 16', 18' and militate against an accumulation of<br>
the fluid. When the container 10' is in the open position, an opening 78' is formed<br>
between each of the adjacent seal blocks 60'. The opening 78' is adapted to receive<br>
a bipolar plate 80' therein. The bipolar plate 80' includes at least one coolant<br>
channel header (not shown) formed therein.<br>
[0041]	The container 10' may include at least one pair of spaced apart arms 82'<br>
having a cross-member 84" extending therebetween. In the embodiment shown, the<br>
cross-member 84" is secured to the container 10' by a plurality of fasteners such as<br>
screws, bolts, and the like, for example. The arms 82' having a generally U-shaped<br>
cross-section, are adapted to receive a coupon 86' therein. The coupon 86' is adapted<br>
for testing at least one of an adherence of the fluid to the bipolar plates 80' and a<br>
formulation thereof. The coupon 36' is disposed in the arms 82' of the container 10' to<br>
span at least one of the apertures 46' formed in the inner plates 12', 14' to facilitate<br>
surface contact with the fluid. A closure 88' is adapted to removeably secure the<br>

90' affixed to an end portion 92' s ideably disposed in an elongate aperture 100".<br>
[0042]	In operation, the coupon 86' is inserted into the arms 82' and secured<br>
therein by the closure 88'. Bipolar plates 80' are disposed in the openings 78' of the<br><br>
container 10' with a bottom edge in slideable contact with the support rails 20', 22'.<br>
Thereafter, the second inner plate. 112 of the container 10' with the hook portion 26'<br>
of the clamp 24' disposed thereor is caused to slide along the guide rails 16', 18' in a<br>
direction towards the first inner plate 110, thereby causing the seal 76' of each of the<br>
seal blocks 60' to contact a surface of the bipolar plates 80' surrounding the coolant<br>
channel header of each of the bipolar plates 80'. The latch portion 28' of the clamp<br>
24' is positioned on the hook portion 26' of the clamp 24'. The lever 29' of clamp 24'<br>
is then actuated to urge the second inner plate 112 towards the first inner plate 110<br>
and move the container 10' to a closed position, as shown in Fig. 6. The actuation of<br>
clamp 24' compresses the bipolar plates 80' between the seal blocks 60' to form a<br>
substantially fluid-tight seal therebetween.<br>
[0043]	Using the handle 44' disposed on the outer plates 12', 14', the<br>
container 10' including the bipolar plates 80' is lifted and disposed in the tank 41' of<br>
fluid. Thereafter, the container 10' is removed from the tank 41' and the ledge 39' is<br>
seated on the lip 40' of the tank 41'. Excess fluid is caused to drain by gravity and<br>
drip from the container 10' and the bipolar plates 80' into the tank 41'. Any remaining<br>
fluid on the bipolar plates 80' is allowed to dry. It is understood that the container 10'<br>
can be disposed in additional tanks of other fluids during the dip coating process as<br>
desired. Once the fluid has driec, the clamp 24' is released. The second inner plate<br>
112 is caused to move in an opposite direction away from the first inner plate 110,<br>
permitting the bipolar plates 80' and the seal blocks 60' to separate, and return the<br>
container 10' to the open position. The bipolar plates 80' are removed from the<br>
container 10' and the coupon 86' is removed from the arms 82'.<br>
[0044] In another embodiment of the invention (not shown), a container includes<br>
a plurality of spaced apart seal blocks. The seal blocks are interconnected by at<br>
least one band. Each seal block includes a fastening portion and a sealing portion.<br>
The fastening portion is adaptec to facilitate an interchange of the sealing portion.<br>
When the container is in an open position, an opening is formed between each of<br>
the adjacent seal blocks. The opening is adapted to receive a bipolar plate therein.<br><br>
The bipolar plate includes at leas: one coolant channel header formed therein. At<br>
least one seal formed on the bipolar plate is adapted to surround the at least one<br>
