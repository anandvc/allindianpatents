IMMUNOSUPPRESSANT COMPOUNDS AND COMPOSITIONS<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001)	This application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. ยง 119(e) to<br>
U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/547,757, filed February 24, 2004. The disclosure of the priority application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and for all purposes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0002]	The invention provides a novel class of immunosuppressant compounds<br>
useful in the treatment or prevention of diseases or disorders mediated by lymphocyte<br>
interactions, particularly diseases associated with EDG receptor mediated signal<br>
transduction.<br>
Background<br>
[0003]	EDG receptors belong to a family of closely related, lipid activated G-<br>
protein coupled receptors. EDG-1, EDG-3, EDG-5, EDG-6, and EDG-8 (also respectively termed SI PI, S1P3, SIP2, SIP4, and S1P5) are identified as receptors specific for sphingosine-1-phosphate (SIP). EDG2, EDG4, and EDG7 (also termed LPA1, LPA2, and LPA3, respectively) are receptors specific for lysophosphatidic (LPA). Among the SIP receptor isotypes, EDG-1, EDG-3 and EDG-5 are widely expressed in various tissues, whereas the expression of EDG-6 is confined largely to lymphoid tissues and platelets, and that of EDG-8 to the centra) nervous system. EDG receptors are responsible for signal transduction and are thought to play an important role in cell processes involving cell development, proliferation, maintenance, migration, differentiation, plasticity and apoptosis. Certain EDG receptors are associated with diseases mediated by lymphocyte interactions, for example, in transplantation rejection, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases,<br><br>
infectious diseases and cancer. An alteration in EDG receptor activity contributes to the pathology and/or symptomology of these diseases. Accordingly, molecules that themselves alter the activity of EDG receptors are useful as therapeutic agents in the treatment of such diseases.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br><br>
[0018]	The invention provides compounds that are useful in the treatment and/or<br>
prevention of diseases or disorders mediated by lymphocyte interactions. Also provided are methods for treating such diseases or disorders.<br>
Definitions<br>
(0019]	In this specification, unless otherwise defined:<br>
[0020]	"Alkyl" as a group and as a structural element of other groups, for example<br>
halo-substituted-alkyl, alkoxy, acyl, alkylthio, alkylsulfonyl and alkylsulfinyl, can be either straight-chained or branched. "Aikenyl" as a group and as a structural element of other groups contains one or more carbon-carbon double bonds, and can be either straight-chain, or branched. Any double bonds can be in the cis- or trans- configuration. A preferred aikenyl group is vinyl. "Alkynyl" as a group and as structural element of other groups and compounds contains at least one C=C triple bond and can also contain one or more C=C double bonds, and can, so far as possible, be either straight-chain or branched. A preferred alkynyl group is propargyl. Any cycloalkyl group, alone or as a structural element of other groups can contain from 3 to 8 carbon atoms, preferably from 3 to 6 carbon atoms. "Aikylene" and "alkenylene" are divalent radicals derived from "alkyl" and "aikenyl" groups, respectively. In this application, any alkyl group of R1 can be optionally interrupted by a member of the group selected from -S-, -S(O)-, -S(o)2~, -NR3- and -O- (wherein R3 is hydrogen or C1-6alkyl). These groups include -CHr-o-CH2-, -CH2-S(o)2-CH2- -(CH2)2~NR3-CH2-, -CH2-o-(CH2)2-&gt; and the like.<br>
[0021]	"Aryl" means a monocyclic or fused bicyclic aromatic ring assembly<br>
containing six to ten ring carbon atoms. For example, C1-6aryl can be phenyl, biphenyl or naphthyl, preferably phenyl. "Arylene" means a divalent radical derived from an aryl group. For example, arylene as used in this application can be phenylene, biphenylene, naphthylene and the like.<br>
[0022]	"Halo" or "halogen" means F, CI, Br or I, preferably F or CI. Halo-<br>
substituted alkyl groups and compounds can be partially halogenated or perhalogenated, whereby in the case of multiple halogenation, the halogen substituents can be identical or different. A preferred perhalogenated alkyl group is for example trifluoromethyl.<br><br>
[0023J	"Heteroaryl" means aryl, as defined in this application, provided that one<br>
or more of the ring carbon atoms indicated are replaced by a hetero atom moiety selected from N, 0 or S, and each ring is comprised of 5 to 6 ring atoms, unless otherwise stated. For example, heteroaryl as used in this application includes thiophenyl, pyridinyl, furanyl, isoxazolyl, benzoxazolyl or benzo[l,3]dioxolyl, preferably thiophenyl, furanyl or pyridinyl. "Heteroarylene" means heteroaryl, as defined in this application, provided that the ring assembly comprises a divalent radical.<br>
[0024]	As used in the present invention, an EDG-l selective compound (agent or<br>
modulator) has a specificity that is selective for EDG-l over EDG-3 and over one or more of EDG-5, EDG-6, and EDG-8. As used herein, selectivity for one EDG receptor (a "selective receptor") over another EDG receptor (a "non-selective receptor") means that the compound has a much higher potency in inducing activities mediated by the selective EDG receptor (e.g., EDG-l) than that for the non-selective S1 P-specific EDG receptor. If measured in a GTP-yS binding assay (as described in the Example below), an EDG-l selective compound typically has an EC50 (effective concentration that causes 50% of the maximum response) for a selective receptor (EDG-l) that is at least 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 500, or 1000 fold lower than its EC50 for a non-selective receptor (e.g., one or more of EDG-3, EDG-5, EDG-6, and EDG-8).<br>

[0037]	Further preferred compounds are shown in the examples and table 1, infra.<br>
[0038]	The invention provides forms of the compound that have the hydroxyl or<br>
amine group present in a protected form; these function as prodrugs. Prodrugs are<br>
compounds that are converted into an active drug form after administration, through one or<br>
more chemical or biochemical transformations. Forms of the compounds of the present<br>
invention that are readily converted into the claimed compound under physiological<br>
conditions are prodrugs of the claimed compounds and are within the scope of the present<br>
invention. Examples of prodrugs include forms where a hydroxyl group is acylated to form<br>
a relatively labile ester such as an acetate ester, and forms where an amine group is acylated<br>
with the carboxylate group of glycine or an L-amino acid such as seR1ne, forming an amide<br>
bond that is particularly susceptible to hydrolysis by common metabolic enzymes.<br>
[0039]	Compounds of Formula I can exist in free form or in salt form, e.g.<br>
addition salts with inorganic or organic acids. Where hydroxy] groups are present, these<br>
groups can also be present in salt form, e.g. an ammonium salt or salts with metals such as<br>
lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, zinc or magnesium, or a mixture thereof. Compounds<br>
of Formula I and their salts in hydrate or solvate form are also part of the invention.<br>
[0040]	When the compounds of Formula I have asymmetR1c centers in the<br>
molecule, vaR1ous optical isomers are obtained. The present invention also encompasses enantiomers, racemates, diastereoisomers and mixtures thereof. Moreover, when the compounds of Formula I include geometR1c isomers, the present invention embraces c is-<br><br>
compounds, trans-compounds and mixtures thereof. Similar considerations apply in relation to starting mateR1als exhibiting asymmetR1c carbon atoms or unsaturated bonds as mentioned above.<br>
Methods and Pharmaceutical Compositions for Treating Immunomodulatory Conditions<br>
[0041]	The compounds of Formula I in free form or in pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt form, exhibit valuable pharmacological properties, e.g. lymphocyte recirculation modulating properties, for example, as indicated by the in vitro and in vivo tests of Example 56 and are therefore indicated for therapy. Compounds of Formula I preferably show an EC50 in the range of 1 x 10"n to I x 10"5 M, preferably less than 50nM. The compounds exhibit selectivity for one or more EDG/S1P receptors, preferably EDG-l/SI P-1. EDG-1/S1P-1 selective modulators of the present invention can be identified by assaying a compound's binding to EDG-1/S1P-1 and one or more of the other EDG/S1P receptors (e.g., EDG-3/S1P-3, EDG-5/S1P-2, EDG-6/S1P-4, and EDG-8/S1P-5). An EDG-l/SlP-1 selective modulator usually has an EC50 for the EDG-1 /SIP-1 receptor in the range of 1 x 10"M to 1 x 10'5 M, preferably less than 50 nM, more preferably less than 5 nM. It also has an EC50 for one or more of the other EDG/S IP receptors that is at least 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 500, or 1000 fold higher than its EC50 forEDG-l/SlP-1. Thus, some of the EDG-1/SIP-1 modulatory compounds will have an EC50 for EDG-I/S1 P-l that is less than 5 nM while their EC50 for one or more of the other EDG/S 1P receptors are at least 100 nM or higher. Other than assaying binding activity to the EDG/S IP receptors, EDG-1/S1P-1 selective agents can also be identified by examining a test agent's ability to modify a cellular process or activity mediated by an EDG/S 1P receptor.<br>
[0042]	The compounds of formula I are, therefore, useful in the treatment and/or<br>
prevention of diseases or disorders mediated by lymphocytes interactions, for example in transplantation, such as acute or chronic rejection of cell, tissue or organ alio- or xenografts or delayed graft function, graft versus host disease, autoimmune diseases, e.g. rheumatoid arthR1tis, systemic lupus erythematosus, hashimoto's thyroidis, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, diabetes type I or II and the disorders associated therewith, vasculitis, pernicious anemia, Sjoegren syndrome, uveitis, psoR1asis, Graves ophthalmopathy, alopecia areata and others, allergic diseases, e.g. allergic asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic<br><br>
rhinitis/conjunctivitis, allergic contact dermatitis, inflammatory diseases optionally with<br>
underlying aberrant reactions, e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease or ulcerative<br>
colitis, intR1nsic asthma, inflammatory lung injury, inflammatory liver injury, inflammatory<br>
glomerular injury, atherosclerosis, osteoarthR1tis, irR1tant contact dermatitis and further<br>
eczematous dermatitises, seborrhoeic dermatitis, cutaneous manifestations of<br>
immunologically-mediated disorders, inflammatory eye disease, keratoconjunctivitis,<br>
myocarditis or hepatitis, ischemia/reperfusion injury, e.g. myocardial infarction, stroke, gut<br>
ischemia, renal failure or hemorrhage shock, traumatic shock, T cell lymphomas or T cell<br>
leukemias, infectious diseases, e.g. toxic shock (e.g. superantigen induced), septic shock,<br>
adult respiratory distress syndrome or viral infections, e.g. AIDS, viral hepatitis, chronic<br>
bacteR1al infection, or senile dementia. Examples of cell, tissue or solid organ transplants<br>
include e.g. pancreatic islets, stem cells, bone marrow, corneal tissue, neuronal tissue, heart,<br>
lung, combined heart-lung, kidney, liver, bowel, pancreas, trachea or oesophagus. For the<br>
above uses the required dosage will of course vary depending on the mode of administration,<br>
the particular condition to be treated and the effect desired.<br>
[0043]	Furthermore, the compounds of formula I are useful in cancer<br>
chemotherapy, particularly for cancer chemotherapy of solid tumors, e.g. breast cancer, or as an anti-angiogenic agent.<br>
[0044]	The required dosage will of course vary depending on the mode of<br>
administration, the particular condition to be treated and the effect desired. In general,<br>
satisfactory results are indicated to be obtained systemically at daily dosages of from about<br>
0.03 to 2.5 mg/kg per body weight. An indicated daily dosage in the larger mammal, e.g.<br>
humans, is in the range from about 0.5 mg to about 100 mg, conveniently administered, for<br>
example, in divided doses up to four times a day or in retard form. Suitable unit dosage<br>
forms for oral administration compR1se from ca. I to 50 mg active ingredient.<br>
[0045]	The compounds of Formula I can be administered by any conventional<br>
route, in particular enterally, for example, orally, e.g. in the form of tablets or capsules, or parenterally, for example, in the form of injectable solutions or suspensions, topically, e.g. in the form of lotions, gels, ointments or creams, or in a nasal or a suppository form. Pharmaceutical compositions compR1sing a compound of Formula 1 in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form in association with at least one pharmaceutical<br><br>
acceptable carR1er or diluent can be manufactured in conventional manner by mixing with a<br>
pharmaceutical^ acceptable carR1er or diluent.<br>
(0046]	The compounds of Formula I can be administered in free form or in<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, for example, as indicated above. Such salts can be<br>
prepared in a conventional manner and exhibit the same order of activity as the free<br>
compounds.<br>

Methods for PrepaR1ng Compounds of the Invention<br>

immunomodulatory compounds of the invention. In the reactions descR1bed, it can be necessary to protect reactive functional groups, for example hydroxy, amino, imino, thio or carboxy groups, where these are desired in the final product, to avoid their unwanted participation in the reactions. Conventional protecting groups can be used in accordance<br><br>
with standard practice, for example, see T.W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts in "Protective<br>
Groups in Organic Chemistry", John Wiley and Sons, 1991.<br>
[00100]	Compounds of Formula I, in which A is 2-carboxy-ethyI, can be prepared<br><br>
[00101]	in which B, E, X, Y, R, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are as defined for Formula I<br>
above. Compounds of Formula I can be prepared sequentially by treating a compound of<br>
formula 2 with a suitable acid (e.g. TFA, and the like), reacting with f-butyl acrylate in the<br>
presence of a suitable amine (e.g. DIEA, and the like) and removing the /-butyl protecting<br>

[00103]	in which B, E, X, Y, R] R2, R3, R4 and R5 are as defined for Formula I<br>

Additional Processes for PrepaR1ng Compounds of the Invention:<br>
[00105]	A compound of the invention can be prepared as a pharmaceutical ly<br>
acceptable acid addition salt by reacting the free base form of the compound with a pharmaceuticaliy acceptable inorganic or organic acid. Alternatively, a pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salt of a compound of the invention can be prepared by reacting the free acid form of the compound with a pharmaceuticaliy acceptable inorganic or organic base. Alternatively, the salt forms of the compounds of the invention can be prepared using salts of the starting mateR1als or intermediates.<br>
[00106]	The free acid or free base forms of the compounds of the invention can be<br>
prepared from the corresponding base addition salt or acid addition salt from, respectively. For example a compound of the invention in an acid addition salt form can be converted to the corresponding free base by treating with a suitable base (e.g., ammonium hydroxide solution, sodium hydroxide, and the like). A compound of the invention in a base addition salt form can be converted to the corresponding free acid by treating with a suitable acid (e.g., hydrochloR1c acid, etc.).<br>
[00107]	Compounds of the invention in unoxidized form can be prepared from N-<br>
oxides of compounds of the invention by treating with a reducing agent (e.g., sulfur, sulfur dioxide, tR1phenyl phosphine, lithium borohydR1de, sodium borohydR1de, phosphorus tR1chloR1de, tR1bromide, or the like) in a suitable inert organic solvent (e.g. acetonitR1le, ethanol, aqueous dioxane, or the like) at 0 to 80ยฐC.<br>
[00108]	Prodrugs deR1vatives of the compounds of the invention can be prepared by<br>
methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art (e.g., for further details see Saulnier et al., (1994), Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters, Vol. 4, p. 1985). For example, appropR1ate prodrugs can be prepared by reacting a non-deR1vatized compound of the invention with a suitable carbamylating agent (e.g., 1,1-acyIoxyalkylcarbanochloR1date, para-nrtrophenyl carbonate, or the like).<br>
[00109]	Protected deR1vatives of the compounds of the invention can be made by<br>
means known to those of ordinary skill in the art. A detailed descR1ption of techniques applicable to the creation of protecting groups and their removal can be found in T W. Greene, "Protecting Groups in Organic Chemistry", 3rd edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1999.<br><br>
[00110]	Compounds of the present invention can be conveniently prepared, or ,<br>
formed duR1ng the process of the invention, as solvates (e.g., hydrates).   Hydrates of compounds of the present invention can be conveniently prepared by recrystatlization from an aqueous/organic solvent mixture, using organic solvents such as dioxin, tetrahydrofuran or methanol.<br>
[00111]	Compounds of the invention can be prepared as their individual<br>
stereoisomers by reacting a racemic mixture of the compound with an optically active resolving agent to forma pair of diastereoisomeR1c compounds, separating the diastereomers and recoveR1ng the optically pure enantiomers. While resolution of enantiomers can be carR1ed out using covalent diastereomeR1c deR1vatives of the compounds of the invention, dissociable complexes are preferred (e.g., crystalline diastereomeR1c salts). Diastereomers have distinct physical properties (e.g., melting points, boiling points, solubilities, reactivity, etc.) and can be readily separated by taking advantage of these dissimilaR1ties.  The diastereomers can be separated by chromatography, or preferable, by separation/resolution techniques based upon differences in solubility. The optically pure enantiomer is then recovered, along with the resolving agent, by any practical means that would not result in<br>
4<br>
racemization. A more detailed descR1ption of the techniques applicable to the resolution of<br>
stereoisomers of compounds from the their racemic mixture can be found in Jean Jacques,<br>
Andre Collet, Samuel H. Wilen, "Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions", John Wiley<br>
And Sons, Inc., 1981.<br>

involves:<br>
[00113]	(a) reacting a compound of formula 2 with either /-butyl acrylate,<br>

Solutions of test compounds ranging from l0mM to 0.01 nM are prepared in DMSO/50mM HCI and then diluted into assay buffer (20mM HEPES, pH7.4, l00mM NaCl, l0mM MgC12, 0.1 % fat free BSA). Assay buffer containing 10mM GDP is mixed with wheat germ agglutinin-coated SPA-beads (Img/well) followed by the addition of human EDG-1 membrane protein suspension (10 ng/well) and test compound. The bead/membrane/compound assay components are then mixed for 10-15 minutes on a shaker at room temperature. GTP [y-35S] (200pM) and bead/membrane/compound assay mixture are added to individual wells of a 96 well Optiplate โข (final volume 225 /well), sealed and incubated at room temperature for 110 to 120 minutes under constant shaking. After centR1fugation (2000rpm, 10 minutes) luminescence is measured with a Topcon โข instrument.<br><br>
[00160]	EC50 values are obtained by fitting the GTP [y-35S] binding curves (raw<br>
data) with the dose response curve-fitting tool of OR1GIN V. 6.1. Basal binding (no<br>
compound) and the highest stimulation of GTP [y-  S] binding achieved by an agonist are<br>

Concentrations of EDG receptor expressing membranes range between 13-19 jag per well.   Compounds of the invention were tested according to the above assay and were observed to exhibit selectivity for the S1P-1 (EDG-1) receptor. For example: (i) 3-(4-f4-(4-cyclohexyl-3-methvl-Dhenoxymethyl)-phenyl']--piperidin-l-yl-propionic acid (example 1) has an EC5o of 0.22 nM in the above assay and is at least 1000 fold selective for S1P-1 compared to one or more of the other receptors including S1P-3, S1P-5, SlP-6 and SlP-8; and (ii)3-[4-r4-r2-Methyl-biphenyl-4-yloxymethyl)-phenyl-piperidin-1-yl}-propionic acid (Example 8) has an EC50 of 2nM, &gt;10ยตM, 2ยตM, &gt;10ยตM and 370nM for S1P-1, S1P-2, S1P-3, S1P-4 and S1P-5, respectively.<br>

The cells are then washed four times with washing buffer (25 ยตl/each). The calcium flux is assayed after adding 25 ยตl of SEQ2871 solution to each well of cells. The same assay is performed with cells expressing each of the different EDG receptors. Titration in the FLIPR calcium flux assay is recorded over a 3-minute interval, and quantitated as maximal peak height percentage response relative to EDG-1 activation.<br><br>

25%/H20 (200 ยตl), 4% DMSO, and FTY720 (l0ยตg) are included as negative and positive<br>
controls, respectively. Mice (C57bl/6 male, 6-10 week-old) are administered 250-300 ยตL of<br>
compound solution orally by gavages under short isoflurane anesthesia.<br>
[00164]	Blood is collected from the retro-orbital sinus 6 and 24 hours after drug<br>
administration under short isoflurane anesthesia. Whole blood samples are subjected to hematology analysis. PeR1pheral lymphocyte counts are determined using an automated analyzer. Subpopulations of peR1pheral blood lymphocytes are stained by fluorochrome-conjugated specific antibodies and analyzed using a fluorescent activating cell sorter (Facscalibur). Two mice are used to assess the lymphocyte depletion activity of each compound screened. The result is an ED50, which is defined as the effective dose required displaying 50 % of blood lymphocyte depletion. Compounds of the invention were tested according to the above assay and were preferably found to exhibit an ED50 of less than lmg/kg, more preferably an ED50 of less than 0.5 mg/kg. For example: (i) 3-f4-f4-f4-cvclohexvl-3"methyl-phenoxymethyl-phenyl--piperidin-l-yl-propionic acid (example I) exhibits an ED50 of 0.1 mg/kg; and (ii) 3-f4-[4-(2-methyl-biphenyl-4-vloxymethylV phenvll-piperidin-l-yl)-propionic acid (Example 8) exhibits and ED50 of 0.2mg/kg and G.8mg/kg at 6 and 48 hours, respectively.<br>

or (ii) human VEGF (1 fig/chamber) in 0.5 ml of 0.8% w/v agar (containing hepaR1n, 20 U/ml) are implanted subcutaneously in the flank of mice. SI P or VEGF induces the growth of vasculaR1zed tissue around the chamber. This response is dose-dependent and can be quantified by measuR1ng the weight and blood content of the tissue. Mice are treated once a day orally or intravenously with a compound of formula I starting 4-6 hours before implantation of the chambers and continuing for 4 days. The animals are sacR1ficed for measurement of the vasculaR1zed tissues 24 hours after the last dose. The weight and blood content of the vasculaR1zed tissues around the chamber is determined. Animals treated with a compound of formula 1 show reduced weight and/or blood content of the vasculaR1zed tissues compared to animals treated with vehicle alone. Compounds of Formula I are anti-angiogenic when administered at a dose of about 0.3 to about 3mg/kg.<br>

[00167]	A mouse breast cancer cell line oR1ginally isolated from mammary<br>
carcinomas is used, e.g. JygMC(A). The cell number is adjusted to 5xl05 for plating in fresh medium before the procedure. Cells are incubated with fresh medium containing 2.5mM of thymidine without FCS for 12 hours and then washed twice with PBS, followed by addition of fresh medium with 10% FCS and additionally incubated for another 12 hours. Thereafter the cells are incubated with fresh medium containing 2.5mM of thymidine without FCS for 12 hours. To release the cells from the block, the cells are washed twice with PBS and replated in fresh medium with 10% FCS. After synchronization, the cells are incubated with or without vaR1ous concentrations of a compound of formula I for 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 or 24 hours. The cells are harvested after treatment with 0.2% EDTA, fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol solution, hydrolyzed with 250ยตg/ml of RNaseA (type 1-A: Sigma Chem. Co.) at 37ยฐC for 30 minutes and stained with propidium iodide at l10mg/ml for 20 minutes. After the incubation peR1od, the number of cells is determined both by counting cells in a Coulter counter and by the SRB coloR1metR1c assay. Under these conditions compounds of formula I inhibit the proliferation of the tumor cells at concentrations ranging from 10*12 to I0"6 M.<br><br>
