				<td>FORMING MACHINE HAVING IMPROVED<br>
TRANSMISSION MECHANISMS<br>
This invention relates to a forming machine, more<br>
particularly to a forming machine for producing forged<br>
products.<br>
A forming machine for producing forged products<br>
typically includes a feeding mechanism for feeding<br>
a wire material to a cutting mechanism for cutting<br>
the wire material into wire sections which are<br>
delivered to a die assembly through a conveying clamp<br>
mechanism. The forming machine further includes a<br>
drive mechanism which drives the cutting mechanism<br>
and the conveying clamp mechanism through a first<br>
transmission mechanism and which also drives the<br>
feeding mechanism through a second transmission<br>
mechanism.<br>
The first transmission mechanism includes a cam<br>
mechanism which has cam plates to cam respectively<br>
the cutting mechanism and the conveying clamp<br>
mechanism so that the cutting mechanism and the<br>
conveying clamp mechanism are actuated<br>
intermittently to perform their respective cutting<br>
and delivering actions. The second transmission<br>
mechanism includes a driven gear driven by a drive<br>
gear of the drive mechanism, and a link connected to<br>
and reciprocated by the driven gear. The feeding<br>
mechanism is driven by the link and advances the wire<br>
material in an intermittent manner.<br>
The intermittent advancement of the wire material<br>
by the feeding mechanism are arranged to alternate<br>
with the cutting action of the cutting mechanism and<br>
the delivering action of the conveying clamp mechanism.<br>
To advance intermittently the wire material, the link<br>
of the second transmission mechanism is moved forward<br>
and backward by the driven gear. When the driven<br>
gear rotates by 180 degrees, the link moves forward<br>
to actuate the feeding mechanism so that the wire<br>
material is advanced. As the feeding mechanism is<br>
actuated, the cutting mechanism and the conveying<br>
clamp mechanism are temporarily stopped from<br>
proceeding with the cutting action and the forwarding<br>
action, respectively. When the driven gear rotates<br>
further by 180 degrees, the link moves backward so<br>
that the feeding mechanism temporarily stops<br>
advancing the wire material. At this time, the<br>
cutting mechanism and the conveying clamp mechanism<br>
perform the cutting and forwarding actions,<br>
respectively. Thus, the frequency ratio of the<br>
advancement of the wire material and the cutting and<br>
delivering of the cut wire sections is 1:1.<br>
In order to increase the speed of such a forming<br>
machine, attempts have been made by increasing the<br>
rotating speed of the drive gear and the driven gear.<br>
However, this increases the speedof the reciprocation<br>
of the cam plates, thereby resulting in increased<br>
impacts between each cam plate and one of the cutting<br>
mechanism and the conveying clamp mechanism. The<br>
increased impact forces tend to produce considerable<br>
vibrations in the forming machine, thereby increasing<br>
an incidence of damaging the machine components.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide<br>
a forming machine with improved transmission<br>
mechanisms for a feeding mechanism, a cutting<br>
mechanism and a conveying clamp mechanism.<br>
According to this invention, a forming machine<br>
which includes a die assembly, comprises: a cutting<br>
mechanism adapted to cut a feed material; a conveying<br>
clamp mechanism adapted to deliver a cut section of<br>
the feed material from the cutting mechanism to the<br>
die assembly; a feeding mechanism adapted to advance<br>
the feed material to the cutting mechanism; a first<br>
transmission mechanism connected to the cutting<br>
mechanism and the conveying clamp mechanism; a<br>
drive mechanism driving the first transmission<br>
mechanism; and a second transmission mechanism driven<br>
by the drive mechanism for driving the feeding<br>
mechanism. The second transmission mechanism<br>
includes a driven wheel driven by the drive mechanism,<br>
a first swing member connected to the feeding mechanism<br>
and confronting the driven wheel, and an eccentric<br>
pin projecting axially from the driven wheel and<br>
connected slidably to the first swing member. The<br>
eccentric pin slides relative to the first swing member<br>
while rotating along with the driven wheel so that<br>
the first swing member is turned to and fro in a cycle<br>
motion and completes one cycle for each revolution<br>
of the eccentric pin.<br>
Other features and advantages of the present<br>
invention will become apparent in the following<br>
detailed description of the preferred embodiments of<br>
the invention, with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings, in which:<br>

preferred embodiment of the invention.<br>
Before the present invention is described in<br>
greater detail, it should be noted that same reference<br>
numerals have been used to denote like elements<br>
throughout the specification.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, a first preferred embodiment<br>
of the present invention includes a housing 3, a<br>
feeding mechanism 4 disposed at the front of the<br>
housing 3. In the housing 3 are provided a drive<br>
mechanism 61, a first transmission mechanism 51, a<br>
cutting mechanism 52 , a conveying clamp mechatnism 53 ,<br>
and a second transmission mechanism 62.<br>
The housing 3 includes a base 31 that extends in<br>
a front-to-rear direction of the housing 3 , a machine<br>
body 32 mounted on the base 31 inside the housing 3<br>
for supporting a forging mechanism (not shown) and<br>
a die assembly ( not shown) , and a fixed pivot seat<br>
33 mounted on the base 31 at the left side of the machine<br>
body 32.<br>
The feeding mechanism 4 is provided to advance a<br>
feed material (e.g. wire) 30 in a front-to-rear<br>
direction. The feeding mechanism 4 includes two<br>
upper transmission gears 411 intermeshed with two<br>
lower transmission gears 411 and a sector-shaped drive<br>
gear 412 intermeshed with the lower transmission gears<br>
411. The upper and lower transmission gears 411 are<br>
connected coaxially and respectively to four upper<br>
and lower feed rollers (not shown) for pinching the<br>
feed material 30 therebetween. The wire material<br>
3 0 is advanced between the upper and lower feed rollers<br>
(not shown) . Since the constructions of the base 31,<br>
the machine body 32, and the feeding mechanism 4 are<br>
known, they are not detailed hereinafter.<br>
Referring to Figures 2-4, the cutting mechanism<br>
52 and the conveying clamp mechanism 53 are provided<br>
to cut the feed material 30 and to convey and deliver<br>
the cut sections of the feed material 30 to a next<br>
processing station, i.e. a die assembly (not shown).<br>
The cutting mechanism 52 is disposed at a level below<br>
the conveying clamp mechanism 53. The first<br>
transmission mechanism 51 is a cam mechanism which<br>
has a substantially vertical slide plate 511 that is<br>
mounted slidably on the machine body 32 in the<br>
front -to-rear direction, a first cam pi ate 512 mounted<br>
on the slide plate 511 and confronting the cutting<br>
mechanism 52, and a second cam plate 516 mounted on<br>
the slide plate 511 above the first cam plate 512 and<br>
confronting the conveying clamp mechanism 53. The<br>
first and second cam plates 512 and 516 are used to<br>
actuate the cutting mechanism 52 and the conveying<br>
clamp mechanism 53, respectively.<br>
The first camplate 512 has a first flat face section<br>
513, a second flat face section 515, and a first<br>
inclined surface 514 between the first and second flat<br>
face sections 513 and 515. The second cam plate 516<br>
includes an indented part defining a second inclined<br>
surface 517, and third and fourth flat face sections<br>
518 , 519 formed respectively on two sides of the second<br>
inclined surfaces 517. Since the constructions of<br>
the first transmission mechanism 51, the cutting<br>
mechanism 52 and the conveying clamp mechanism 53 are<br>
known in the art, the details thereof are omitted<br>
herein for the sake of simplicity.<br>
Referring to Figure 5 in combination with Figures<br>
1 and 2, the drive mechanism 61 includes a drive gear<br>
611 driven by a power unit (not shown), and a crank<br>
612 which includes a front end connected to the<br>
vertical slide plate 511 of the first transmission<br>
mechanism 51 and a rear end pivoted eccentrically to<br>
the drive gear 611 so that the crank 612 is driven<br>
by the drive gear 611 and reciprocates the slide plate<br>
511 .<br>
The second transmission mechanism 62 includes a<br>
reverse gear 621 meshed with the drive gear 611, a<br>
driven wheel in the form of a driven gear 622 meshed<br>
with the reverse gear 621, an eccentric pin 623<br>
eccentrically connected to the driven gear 622, afirst<br>
swing member 63 connected to the eccentric pin 623,<br>
and a reciprocating unit 64 connected to the first<br>
swing member 63.<br>
The reciprocating unit 64 includes a first<br>
connecting rod 641 connected to the first swing member<br>
63, a length adjustment unit 642 mounted movably on<br>
the machine body 32 and connected to the first<br>
connecting rod 641, and a second connecting rod 644<br>
connected to the length adjustment unit 642. The<br>
length adjustment unit 642 has an elongated adjustment<br>
hole 643 . A connecting end of the second connecting<br>
rod 644 is connected slidably to the adjustment hole<br>
643. A front end of the second connecting rod 644<br>
is connected to a second swing member 413 . The second<br>
swing member 413 is disposed coaxially with the<br>
sector-shaped drive wheel 412 for synchronous<br>
movement. The position of the connecting end of the<br>
second connecting rod 644 in the adjustment hole 643<br>
may be changed to adjust the total length of the<br>
reciprocating unit 64 (the sum of the lengths of the<br>
first and second connecting rods 641, 644 plus the<br>
length of a portion of the length adjustment unit 642 ) .<br>
As such, the turning angle of the second swing member<br>
413 may be changed to adjust the length of the feed<br>
material 30 to be advanced by the feeding mechanism<br>
4 .<br>
When a lower end of the length adjustment 642 is<br>
turned rearward by the first connecting rod 641, the<br>
sector-shaped drive wheel 412 is rotated<br>
counterclockwise so that the feed rollers (not shown)<br>
connected to the transmission gears 411 rotate and<br>
advance the feed material 30.<br>
The first swing member 63 includes an elongated<br>
swing plate 631 with a bottom end which is pivoted<br>
to the pivot seat 33 to turn about a pivot axis 635.<br>
The pivot axis 635 is substantially parallel to the<br>
axis of the driven gear 623, and the swing plate 631<br>
is confronting the driven gear 623. An elongated<br>
through hole 632 is formed in the swing plate 631,<br>
and a slide block 633 is mounted within the through<br>
hole 632 to slide along the length of the through hole<br>
632. The eccentric pin 623 of the driven gear 622<br>
is connected pivotally to the slide block 633. The<br>
first connecting rod 641 is connected pivotally to<br>
the swing plate 631.<br>
In operation, when the drive gear 611 of the first<br>
transmission mechanism 61 is rotated<br>
counterclockwise, the crank 612 moves the slide plate<br>
511 forward so that the cutting mechanism 52 and the<br>
conveying clamp mechanism 53 are actuated.<br>
Simultaneously, the reverse gear 621 is moved<br>
clockwise, and the driven gear 622 is turned<br>
counterclockwise. Inaddition, the eccentric pin 623<br>
rotates around the axis 620 of the driven gear 622<br>
and moves the slide block 633. The slide block 633<br>
is therefore slid within the through hole 632 of the<br>
swing plate 631. As the slide block 633 is moved,<br>
the swing plate 631 of the first swing member 63 is<br>
turned forward to a first position as shown in Figure<br>
4 and rearward to a second position as shown in Figure<br>
5 .<br>
Since the first swing member 63 is turned about<br>
the pivot axis 630 arranged below the axis 620 of the<br>
driven gear 622 and since the position of the pivot<br>
axis 630 of the first swing member 63 is more forward<br>
than the axis 620 of the driven gear 622 (i.e. the<br>
pivot axis 630 is not aligned with the axis 620 along<br>
a vertical line and is located forwardly of the<br>
vertical line), the turning angle 91 of the eccentric<br>
pin 623 which rotates counterclockwise and rearward<br>
to swing the first swing member 63 from the first<br>
position (figure 1) to the second position (figure<br>
2) is smaller than 180 degrees. When the first swing<br>
member 63 is turned rearward to the second position,<br>
as shown in Figure 2, the first swing member 63 pulls<br>
the first connecting rod 641 rearward so that the<br>
bottom end of the adjustment member 42 is moved<br>
rearward. The second swing member 413 therefore<br>
rotates the sector-shaped driven gear 412 of the<br>
feeding mechanism 4 counterclockwise, thereby<br>
actuating the feeding mechanism 4 to advance the feed<br>
material 30. At that time, the crank 612 of the first<br>
transmission mechanism 61 pulls the slide plate 511<br>
rearward so that the cutting mechanism 52 does not<br>
cut the wire material 30, and the conveying clamp<br>
mechanism 53 does not deliver the cut sections of the<br>
feed material 30.<br>
When the first swing member 63 is turned from the<br>
second position to the first position, the eccentric<br>
pin 623 rotates counterclockwise by an angle 92 which<br>
is equal to 360 degrees - 61 and which is greater than<br>
180 degrees. At this time, the feeding mechanism 4<br>
does not advance the feed material 30. However, the<br>
first transmission mechanism 51 moves the slide plate<br>
511 forward and actuates the cutting mechanism 52 and<br>
the conveying clamp mechanism 53 to cut the feed<br>
material 30 and to deliver the cut section of the feed<br>
material 30 to the die assembly (not shown),<br>
respectively.<br>
As mentioned above, when the eccentric pin 623<br>
rotates along with the driven gear 622 , the first swing<br>
member 63 is swung by the eccentric pin 623 so that<br>
the first swing member 63 moves to and fro in a cycle<br>
motion and completes one cycle of the cycle motion<br>
for each revolution of the eccentric pin 623. The<br>
first swing member 63 executes a first stroke movement<br>
(from the first position to the second position of<br>
the first swing member 63) , and a second stroke<br>
movement (the second position to the first position)<br>
in one cycle of its cycle motion. The eccentric pin<br>
623 rotates by a first angle 91 for the first stroke<br>
movement of the first swing member 63 and by a second<br>
angle 92 for the second stroke movement. The first<br>
angle 61 is smaller than the second angle 62.<br>
In this embodiment, 61 is equal to 140 degrees,<br>
whereas 92 is equal to 220 degrees. Thus, the<br>
eccentric pin 623 of the driven gear 622 rotates<br>
counterclockwise by an angle of 140 degrees to actuate<br>
the feeding mechanism 4 to advance the feed-material<br>
30 one time. Since the time taken by the eccentric<br>
pin 623 to turn 140 degrees is less than that to turn<br>
220 degrees, the time required by the feeding mechanism<br>
4 to advance the feed material 30 is reduced, compared<br>
to the time taken in the course of stopping advancement<br>
of the feed material 30. Therefore, the time<br>
provided for the cutting mechanism 5 2 and the conveying<br>
clamp mechanism 53 to perform their respective cutting<br>
and delivering actions can be increased.<br>
Referring once again to Figures 2 to 4, since the<br>
time needed to activate the cutting mechanism 52 and<br>
the conveying clamp mechanism 53 has been prolonged,<br>
the first and second inclined surfaces 514, 517 of<br>
the first and second cam plates 512, 516 can be<br>
increased in length so that the slope angles thereof<br>
can be decreased, thereby reducing the pressure<br>
induced on the first and second cam plates 512, 516<br>
during their camming actions. Therefore, when the<br>
drive gear 611 is speeded up in order to increase the<br>
production rate of the forming machine, vibration<br>
movements can be reduced.<br>
Referring to Figure 6, there is shown a second<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention. In<br>
the second embodiment, the feeding mechanism 4'<br>
includes an upper sector-shaped driven gear 411' and<br>
a lower sector-shaped drive gear 412 which are<br>
interftieshed each other and which are connected<br>
coaxially and respectively to a pair of feed rollers<br>
(not shown) to pinch the feed material 30 therebetween<br>
for advancement. When the sector-shaped lower gear<br>
412 rotates clockwise, the feedmaterial 30 is advanced<br>
to the cutting mechanism 52 .<br>
The direction of the sector-shaped drive gear 412<br>
to advance the feed material 30 in this embodiment<br>
is opposite to that of the drive gear 412 in the first<br>
embodiment. Furthermore, the direct ion of the driven<br>
gear 622' to drive the first swing member 63 is opposite<br>
to that of the driven gear 622 in the first embodiment .<br>
No reverse gear is provided in this embodiment, and<br>
the driven gear 622 ' is meshed directly with the drive<br>
gear 611. Thus, when the drive gear 611 rotates<br>
counterclockwise, the driven gear 622' rotates<br>
clockwise.<br>
The first swing member 63 includes an elongated<br>
swing plate 631. The eccentric pin 623 of the driven<br>
gear 622' is connected directly to the slide block<br>
633 in the through hole 632 of the swing plate 631.<br>
The swing plate 631 has a bottom end pivoted directly<br>
to the left side of the machine body 32 . The length<br>
adjustment member 642 is fixed directly to a front<br>
side of the swing plate 631 so that the length<br>
adjustment member 642 is swung synchronously with the<br>
swing plate 631.<br>
Therefore, when the driven gear 622' is driven by<br>
the drive gear 611 to rotate clockwise, the swing plate<br>
631 turns from the first position to the second<br>
position, and the sector-shaped drive gear 412 rotates<br>
counterclockwise so that the feed mechanism 4' does<br>
not advance the feed material 30. At this time, the<br>
cutting mechanism 52 and the conveying clamp mechanism<br>
53 are activated to perform the respective cutting<br>
and delivering actions. When the driven gear 622'<br>
continues to rotate, the swing plate 631 is turned<br>
from the second position to the first position, and<br>
the sector-shaped drive gear 412 rotates clockwise<br>
so that the feed material 30 is advanced. This<br>
embodiment provides the same result as the previous<br>
embodiment.<br>
