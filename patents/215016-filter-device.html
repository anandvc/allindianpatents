				<td>Filter device<br>
The invention relates to a filter device for filtering<br>
a hydraulic fluid, with a filter housing in which a<br>
filter element is disposed.<br>
The invention also relates to a filter element for a<br>
filter device of this type and to a hydraulic circuit<br>
with a filter device.<br>
Filter devices of the type stated at the beginning have<br>
many uses, for example in self-propelled machinery,<br>
such as construction or agricultural machinery for<br>
example. In such cases, the hydraulic systems have to<br>
meet very high requirements concerning the cleanliness<br>
of the hydraulic fluid in order for them to operate as<br>
intended over long periods without any malfunctions and<br>
with little wear. With many hydraulic systems there is<br>
already a high risk of damage occurring to the<br>
hydraulic pumps being used when they are put into<br>
operation for the first time, on account of residues of<br>
dirt remaining in the hydraulic fluid tank. In<br>
particular in the case of complexly shaped tanks formed<br>
as a cast part or welded construction, reliable,<br>
thorough cleaning is scarcely possible with a<br>
reasonable amount of effort. Therefore, at least one<br>
protective filter which holds back dirt particles of a<br>
minimum size of about 60 µm is usually disposed<br>
upstream of the hydraulic pumps.<br>
However, protective filters of this type are usually<br>
not adequate to ensure the required long-term wear<br>
resistance of the highly stressed hydraulic components.<br>
To do so, in many cases much smaller dirt particles<br>
have to be effectively filtered out from the hydraulic<br>
fluid. For this purpose, a separate fine filter, with<br><br>
a fineness of less than 15 µm, that is to say with<br>
which dirt particles of a minimum size of approximately<br>
15 µm can be removed, may be used in addition to said<br>
protective filter. In this case, the protective filter<br>
is used in the form of a suction filter, which is<br>
disposed in the intake line of the hydraulic pump, and<br>
the fine filter is fitted in the return line or<br>
pressure line of the hydraulic system. In this case,<br>
screening elements are usually used as the suction<br>
filter, while filter elements with filter material of<br>
npnwoven fabric, which in many cases themselves still<br>
filter out dirt particles of a size of around 5 µm from<br>
the hydraulic fluid with an efficiency of at least 50%,<br>
can be used in the pressure or return filters.<br>
Although the use of two separate filters with different<br>
filter fineness makes it possible to achieve a long<br>
service life of the hydraulic system, it involves<br>
considerable costs both in terms of fitting out a<br>
system for the first time and in terms of servicing.<br>
Alternatively, it may also be envisaged to use only a<br>
single filter with a fineness of at least about 20 µm,<br>
so that dirt particles of a size of at least 20 µm are<br>
still filtered out from the hydraulic fluid with an<br>
efficiency of 99% by means of the single filter used.<br>
This not only permits reliable protection of the<br>
hydraulic pumps, but also protects the further<br>
hydraulic components from contaminants. Since the<br>
filter is disposed upstream of the pump, however, and<br>
consequently has to be formed as a suction filter, a<br>
large overall volume is required for the filter, in<br>
order that, in spite of the filter fineness used, a<br>
relatively low permissible pressure loss on the suction<br>
side of the hydraulic pump is not exceeded. This<br>
disadvantage is particularly significant whenever a<br>
heavy-bodied oil has to be used as the hydraulic fluid<br><br>
or low temperatures, and consequently high viscosities<br>
for the hydraulic fluid, are to be expected when the<br>
hydraulic system is put into operation.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to develop a<br>
filter device of the type stated at the beginning which<br>
ensures reliable protection both of a hydraulic pump<br>
and of other highly stressed hydraulic components and<br>
has a compact, easy-to-service form of construction.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention in<br>
the case of a filter device of the generic type by the<br>
filter element comprising a first and a second<br>
subelement, the first subelement having a higher filter<br>
fineness than the second subelement and both<br>
subelements being insertable through a common insertion<br>
opening into the filter housing, and by it being<br>
possible for hydraulic fluid to be fed to each<br>
subelement via a separate supply inflow in the filter<br>
housing and for filtered hydraulic fluid to be<br>
discharged from both subelements via a common outflow<br>
in the filter housing.<br>
According to the invention, a combination filler<br>
element which can be inserted into the filter housing<br>
and has two subelements with different fineness is<br>
provided for the filter device. The filter housing has<br>
at least two access openings, so that different flows<br>
of hydraulic fluid can be fed to the two subelements.<br>
The filtered hydraulic fluid can then be discharged via<br>
a third opening in the filter housing. Such a<br>
configuration of the filter device makes it possible to<br>
dispose one of the two subelements of the filter<br>
element upstream of a hydraulic pump, while the other<br>
subelement can be disposed downstream of other<br>
hydraulic components. The subelement disposed upstream<br><br><br>
of the hydraulic pump may in this case have a coarser<br>
fineness than the other subelement, so that the<br>
pressure loss on the suction side of the hydraulic pump<br>
can be kept low, while at the same time even very small<br>
dirt particles can be filtered out of the hydraulic<br>
fluid by means of the other subelement, in that the<br>
subelement is disposed in the return line of the<br>
hydraulic system. To do so, separate access openings<br>
for the two subelements are provided on the filter<br>
housing.<br>
Since the two subelements can be inserted into the<br>
filter housing via a common insertion opening, the<br>
filter device is also distinguished by being very easy<br>
to service, since it is not required to dismantle the<br>
filter device completely to allow the two subelements<br>
to be exchanged.<br>
The two supply inflows are preferably separated fluid-<br>
tightly from each other by means of at least one<br>
sealing element. Such a configuration provides the<br>
possibility of inserting the two subelements into a<br>
common receiving space of the filter housing, into<br>
which the two supply inflows open, it then being<br>
ensured by at least one sealing element that the supply<br>
inflow for the first subelement is separated fluid-<br>
tightly from the supply inflow for the second<br>
subelement. O-ring seals may be used, for example, as<br>
the sealing elements. The sealing elements are<br>
preferably held on the subelements and can be inserted<br>
together with the filter elements into the filter<br>
housing.<br>
In the case of a preferred embodiment, it is provided<br>
that at least the first subelement has an associated<br>
bypass line with a bypass valve. The first subelement<br><br>
is distinguished by a higher fineness, so that there is<br>
the risk, in particular for this subelement of it<br>
gradually becoming clogged during its use. This<br>
results in an increasing pressure loss. To avoid an<br>
impermissible pressure increase at the first<br>
subelement, the bypass valve is provided in the form of<br>
a pressure-relief valve, which releases the bypass line<br>
if a pressure increase beyond fixed normal values takes<br>
place on the flow-accepting side of the first<br>
subelement. This avoids damage to the first<br>
subelement.<br>
It is of advantage if the bypass line connects the<br>
supply inflow of the first subelement to the supply<br>
inflow of the second subelement. Such a configuration<br>
has the advantage that, in the event of an<br>
impermissible pressure increase at the first<br>
subelement, the hydraulic fluid can continue to be<br>
filtered by means of the second subelement even though<br>
the first subelement is bypassed, so that, even when<br>
the first subelement is clogged, at least relatively<br>
coarse dirt particles continue to be filtered out of<br>
the hydraulic fluid by means of the second subelement.<br>
Alternatively, it may be provided that the bypass line<br>
connects the supply inflow of the first subelement to<br>
the common outflow of the first and second subelements.<br>
In this case it is of advantage if a screening element<br>
is provided in the bypass line.<br>
A detachably connectable cover is preferably provided<br>
for closing the insertion opening. In this case, it is<br>
particularly favorable if the filter housing has a<br>
filter casing for receiving the filter element, which<br>
can be closed fluid-tightly by means of the cover. A<br>
through-opening, which forms a supply inflow for one of<br><br>
the two subelements or the common outflow for both<br>
subelements, is preferably disposed in a bottom wall of<br>
the filter casing.<br>
In the case of a particularly compact configuration of<br>
the filter device according to the invention, it is<br>
provided that the filter casing has two lateral<br>
through-openings. For example, it may be provided that<br>
the filter casing is cylindrically shaped, with two<br>
through-openings being formed on the lateral surface of<br>
the cylinder and forming, for example, a supply inflow<br>
for the first subelement and a common outflow. It may<br>
alternatively be provided that the two supply inflows<br>
for the subelements are disposed at different heights<br>
in the lateral surface of the cylinder, while the<br>
common outflow is disposed in the bottom wall of the<br>
cylinder.<br>
The present invention is also based on the object of<br>
providing a filter element for use in the filter device<br>
stated above.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by<br>
the filter element comprising a first and a second<br>
subelement, the first subelement having a higher filter<br>
fineness than the second subelement. The filter<br>
element according to the invention can consequently be<br>
used in the form of a combination filter element<br>
simultaneously for the protection of a hydraulic pump<br>
and for the protection of highly stressed hydraulic<br>
components. The advantages which can be achieved in<br>
this way have already being presented in connection<br>
with the discussion of the filter device according to<br>
the invention.<br><br>
It is favorable if the first subelement has a fineness<br>
of less than approximately 20 µm, in particular a<br>
fineness of less than about 15 µm, so that even dirt<br>
particles of a size of 15 µm can still be filtered out<br>
of the hydraulic fluid with an efficiency of at least<br>
99%.<br>
The first subelement preferably comprises a filter<br>
material with a nonwoven fabric, since this allows a<br>
higher fineness to be ensured in a simple way. For<br>
example, it may be provided that even dirt particles of<br>
a size of about 5 µm are still filtered out with an<br>
efficiency of at least 50% by means of the nonwoven<br>
fabric.<br>
To ensure reliable protection of a hydraulic pump, it<br>
is favorable if the second subelement has a fineness of<br>
less than 60 µm. To do so, the second subelement may<br>
be formed, for example, as a screening element.<br>
In the case of a particularly preferred configuration<br>
of the filter element according to the invention, it is<br>
provided that the two subelements can be detachably<br>
connected to each other. This provides the possibility<br>
of inserting the two subelements in the connected state<br>
into the filter housing, or removing them from it, in a<br>
simple way. The two subelements can be detached from<br>
each other, so that they can be exchanged independently<br>
of each other.<br>
A configuration which can be produced at particularly<br>
low cost is distinguished by the fact that the two<br>
subelements can be non-detachably connected to each<br>
other. For example, it can be provided that the two<br>
subelements are adhesively bonded or welded to each<br>
other.<br><br>
The filter element is preferably shaped in a<br>
substantially cylindrical manner, the two subelements<br>
being disposed axially one behind the other. This<br>
provides the possibility of inserting the combination<br>
filter element into a cylindrical filter casing of a<br>
filter housing in a simple way.<br>
It is of advantage if the filter element comprises a<br>
sealing ring, preferably running around in the<br>
peripheral direction, for the fluid-tight separation of<br>
the supply inflows of the two subelements. For<br>
example, it may be provided that the two subelements<br>
are formed in a hollow-cylindrical manner and can in<br>
each case be flowed through from the outside inward,<br>
and that the sealing element is axially disposed<br>
approximately at the height of the connection between<br>
the two subelements. This makes it possible to<br>
position the combination filter element in a<br>
cylindrical filter casing which is provided on its<br>
lateral surface with two through-openings, which are<br>
respectively associated with a subelement and are in<br>
fluid connection with an annular space surrounding the<br>
filter element, the annular space being axially<br>
subdivided into two fluid-tightly separate portions by<br>
means of the sealing element, so that different flows<br>
of fluid can be fed to the subelements via the two<br>
portions.<br>
It may alternatively be provided that the two<br>
subelements are formed in a hollow-cylindrical manner<br>
and can be flowed through radially from the inside<br>
outward, a partition being positioned between the two<br>
subelements, and the two subelements respectively<br>
accepting flow on the end face at their free ends.<br>
This provides the possibility of disposing a sealing<br><br>
ring respectively at the free ends of the two<br>
subelements, so that the annular space surrounding the<br>
subelements can be separated fluid-tightly from the<br>
free ends of the subelements. The filtered hydraulic<br>
fluid can be fed via the annular space to a common<br>
outflow, while the free ends of the subelements have<br>
separate associated supply inflows.<br>
To achieve a particularly compact configuration, it is<br>
provided in the case of a preferred embodiment that the<br>
filter element comprises a bypass valve for bypassing<br>
the first subelement. For example, it may be provided<br>
that the filter element is formed in a hollow-<br>
cylindrical manner, the two subelements being axially<br>
disposed one behind other and respectively forming a<br>
portion of the lateral surface of the filter element,<br>
and that the bypass valve is disposed on an end face of<br>
the filter element. It may alternatively be provided<br>
that the bypass valve is mounted on a partition between<br>
the two subelements.<br>
In the case of a particularly preferred embodiment, it<br>
is provided that the second subelement can be flowed<br>
through in two directions. This provides the<br>
possibility of changing the direction of throughflow<br>
through the second subelement, so that a more effective<br>
back-washing effect is achieved, prolonging the<br>
lifetime of the filter considerably. The second<br>
subelement may, for example, be shaped in a hollow-<br>
cylindrical manner, the filter material used forming<br>
the lateral surface of the cylinder and being supported<br>
both on its outer side and on its inner side in each<br>
case by a supporting tube having through-openings.<br>
The present invention is also based on the object of<br>
providing a hydraulic circuit which provides the<br><br>
possibility of ensuring reliable protection of at least<br>
one hydraulic pump and highly stressed hydraulic<br>
components by means of the filter device explained at.<br>
the beginning.<br>
To achieve this object, the invention proposes a<br>
hydraulic circuit with a supply of hydraulic fluid<br>
which is made available to at least one hydraulic<br>
consumer by means of a pump, and can be fed back from<br>
the consumer to the hydraulic supply via at least one<br>
return line, and also with a filter device of the type<br>
stated at the beginning, one supply inflow of the<br>
filter device being connected to the hydraulic supply,<br>
the other supply inflow being connected via a return<br>
line to at least one consumer and the outflow of the<br>
filter device being connected to the pump. With this<br>
hydraulic circuit, the pump can be reliably protected.<br>
To do so, the supply inflow associated with the second,<br>
coarser subelement of the filter device is connected to<br>
the hydraulic supply, and the hydraulic pump is<br>
connected to the common outflow of the filter device.<br>
The hydraulic fluid which is fed to the pump from the<br>
hydraulic supply is consequently filtered via the<br>
second subelement. This involves only a relatively<br>
small pressure drop at the second subelement, on<br>
account of its relatively low fineness, so that the<br>
hydraulic pump is loaded only a little. To filter even<br>
very small dirt particles effectively out of the<br>
hydraulic fluid, the first subelement is disposed in a<br>
return line leaving the hydraulic consumer. To do so,<br>
the return line is connected to the supply inflow of<br>
the filter device associated with the second<br>
subelement, so that the hydraulic fluid flowing out<br>
from the consumer flows via the first subelement to the<br>
common outflow of the filter device and is effectively<br>
filtered as it does so. Consequently, coarsely<br><br>
filtered hydraulic fluid from the hydraulic supply and<br>
finely filtered hydraulic fluid from the consumer can<br>
be fed simultaneously to the hydraulic pump via the<br>
filter device. The finer, first subelement is flowed<br>
through exclusively by the hydraulic fluid which<br>
originates from the system return and is fed to the<br>
hydraulic pump. The coarser, second subelement, on the<br>
other hand, is flowed through only by the amount<br>
constituting the difference between the pump delivery<br>
flow and the return flow.<br>
It is favorable if the first subelement has an<br>
associated bypass valve or pressure-relief valve, by<br>
which the pressure drop at the first subelement can be<br>
limited.<br>
It may be provided that only a partial flow of the<br>
hydraulic fluid delivered by the at least one pump is<br>
passed to the supply inflow of the filter device<br>
associated with the first subelement, while the<br>
remaining hydraulic fluid is fed to the hydraulic<br>
supply. For example, it may be provided that at least<br>
two hydraulic pumps are used, downstream of which there<br>
is respectively disposed a hydraulic consumer, for<br>
example a hydraulic steering system and working<br>
hydraulics, only the working hydraulics being connected<br>
to the supply inflow of the first subelement, while the<br>
hydraulic steering is connected to the hydraulic<br>
supply.<br>
It may alternatively be provided that all the hydraulic<br>
fluid delivered by the at least one pump is fed to the<br>
supply inflow of the filter device associated with the<br>
first subelement.<br><br><br>

figure 6 shows a block diagram of a hydraulic circuit<br>
with a filter device according to the third<br>
embodiment.<br>
In figure 1, a first embodiment of a filter device,<br>
denoted overall by the reference numeral 10, is<br>
schematically represented in a sectional view. This<br>
device comprises a filter housing 12 with a<br>
substantially cylindrical filter head 14, with which a<br>
likewise cylindrically formed filter casing 16 is<br>
connected in the axial direction and which can be<br>
closed fluid-tightly on the upper end face, remote from<br><br><br>
the filter casing 16, by means of a cover 18. The<br>
filter head 14 has in its side wall a first supply<br>
inflow 20 for feeding in hydraulic fluid to be filtered<br>
and an outflow 22 for discharging filtered hydraulic<br>
fluid. A second supply inflow 24 is provided in a<br>
bottom wall 26 of the filter casing 16. Branching off<br>
from the first supply inflow 20 is a bypass line 28,<br>
which is aligned parallel to the longitudinal axis of<br>
the filter casing 16 and at the free end 29 of which a<br>
bypass valve 30 is disposed in the form of a spring-<br>
loaded nonreturn valve 30.<br>
Arranged within the filter casing 16 and with a spacing<br>
from its side wall 32 is a combination filter element<br>
34, which extends from a supply-inflow connection piece<br>
36, protruding from the inside of the bottom wall 26 of<br>
the filter casing 16, up to the height of an inflow<br>
connection piece 38, positioned within the filter head<br>
14. The supply-inflow connection piece 36 is in this<br>
case in flow connection with the second supply inflow<br>
24, while the inflow connection piece 38 is in flow<br>
connection with the first supply inflow 20.<br>
The combination filter element 34 has a cylindrical<br>
configuration and comprises a first subelement 40, with<br>
which the inflow connection piece 38 is connected, and<br>
a second subelement 42, with which the first subelement<br>
40 is directly connected in the axial direction and<br>
which is in flow connection with the supply-inflow<br>
connection piece 36. The two subelements 40 and 42 in<br>
each case have a filter material 44 and 46,<br>
respectively, which forms a cylinder jacket, and is<br>
supported on its outer side by a supporting tube 4 8 and<br>
50, respectively, having through-openings. For the<br>
second subelement 42, a further supporting tube 52,<br>
having through-openings, is additionally provided on<br>

the inner side of the filter material 46. At the end<br>
faces, the two subelements 40 and 42 in each case have<br>
an end cap 54 and 56, respectively, at the mutually<br>
facing ends, and on the free end faces there is in each<br>
case disposed a terminating plate 58, and 60,<br>
respectively, with a through-opening which is passed<br>
through by the inflow connection piece 38 and the<br>
supply-inflow connection piece 36, respectively. The<br>
inner space 62 of the first subelement 40, surrounded<br>
by the filter material 44, is consequently in flow<br>
connection with the first supply inflow 20 via the<br>
inflow connection piece 38, while the inner space 64 of<br>
the second subelement 42, surrounded by the filter<br>
material 46, is in flow connection with the second<br>
supply inflow 24 via the supply-inflow connection piece<br>
36. The supporting tube 48 of the first subelement and<br>
the outer supporting tube 50 of the second subelement<br>
are disposed with a spacing with respect to the side<br>
wall of the filter casing 16, thereby forming a common<br>
annular space 66, the annular space 66 being separated<br>
fluid-tightly from the first supply inflow 20 and the<br>
second supply inflow 24 by means of an O-ring 68,<br>
disposed on the terminating plate 60 of the second<br>
subelement 42, an O-ring 69, disposed on the<br>
terminating plate 58 of the first subelement 40, and an<br>
O-ring 70, surrounding the inflow connection piece 38.<br>
The annular space 66 is in flow connection with the<br>
outflow 22. This has the consequence that both the<br>
hydraulic fluid fed via the first supply inflow 20 to<br>
the first subelement and the hydraulic fluid fed via<br>
the second supply inflow 24 to the second subelement 42<br>
can be discharged via the annular space 66 and the<br>
outflow 22.<br>
Since the second subelement 42 has both on its outer<br>
side and on its inner side in each case a supporting<br><br>
tube 50 and 52, respectively, it can be flowed through<br>
radially in both directions, that is both from the<br>
inside outward, as indicated by the arrow 72, and from<br>
the outside inward, as symbolized by the arrow 74. By<br>
contrast with this, the first subelement 40 can only be<br>
flowed through from the inside outward, corresponding<br>
to the arrow 76.<br>
A nonwoven fabric with a high fineness may be used, for<br>
example, as the filter material 44 for the first<br>
subelement 40, so that even dirt particles of a size of<br>
about 5 |im can still be filtered out with an efficiency<br>
of at least 50%.<br>
By contrast with the first subelement 40, the second<br>
subelement 42 is of a coarser configuration; it may,<br>
for example, be formed as a screening element with a<br>
fineness of at least approximately 60 µm.<br>
An example of a hydraulic circuit in which the filter<br>
device 10 can be used is represented in figure 2. In<br>
this case, two hydraulic pumps P1 and P2, driven by a<br>
motor M, are connected to the common outflow 22. The<br>
pump P1 is in flow connection via a three-way valve 79<br>
with a double-acting hydraulic cylinder 81, in which a<br>
piston 83 is displaceably mounted. From the hydraulic<br>
cylinder 81, a line leads back to the three-way valve<br>
79 and from the latter via a return line 85 to the<br>
first supply inflow 20 of the filter device 10.<br>
Disposed downstream of the hydraulic pump P2 is a two-<br>
way valve 87, via which hydraulic fluid can be fed to a<br>
consumer 89. From the latter, a return line 91<br>
likewise leads to the first supply inflow 20 of the<br>
filter device 10.<br><br>
The second supply inflow 24 of the filter device 10 is<br>
in flow connection via a feed line 93 with a hydraulic<br>
supply 95. The latter is also connected via the bypass<br>
line 28 and the bypass valve 30 to the first supply<br>
inflow 20.<br>
In the case of the hydraulic circuit sketched in figure<br>
2, all the hydraulic fluid delivered by the two pumps<br>
P1 and P2 is fed via the first supply inflow 20 to the<br>
first subelement 40 and filtered by the latter.<br>
Depending on the intensity of the pump delivery flow<br>
fed to the pumps P1 and P2 and of the return flow<br>
returned from the hydraulic system via the return line<br>
85 and the return line 91, either hydraulic fluid is<br>
sucked in from the supply 95 via the second subelement<br>
42 or else excess hydraulic fluid is discharged via the<br>
second subelement 46 to the hydraulic supply 95. For<br>
this purpose, the second subelement 46 can be flowed<br>
through in both directions, a change in the direction<br>
of throughflow having the consequence of an effective<br>
back-flushing effect, by which the lifetime of the<br>
filter can be prolonged significantly.<br>
If the combination filter element 40 is to be<br>
exchanged, all that is required to do so is to detach<br>
the cover 18 of the filter device 10, in order<br>
subsequently to remove the inflow connection piece 38<br>
and the combination filter element 34 from the filter<br>
housing 12. Access to the filter housing 12 in the<br>
region of the filter casing 16 is consequently not<br>
required to exchange the combination filter element 34.<br>
The filter device 10 is therefore particularly easy to<br>
service.<br>
Alternative configurations of the filter device<br>
according to the invention are represented in figures 3<br><br>
and 5. These are constructed in a similar way to the<br>
filter device 10 explained above with reference to<br>
figure 1. Therefore, the same reference numerals as in<br>
figure 1 have been used for identical or functionally<br>
equivalent components. In the case of the filter<br>
device 100 represented in figure 3, a substantially<br>
cylindrically formed filter housing 12 with a filter<br>
head 14 and a filter casing 16 is likewise used, the<br>
first supply inflow 20 being arranged on the filter<br>
head 14 and the second supply inflow 24 being arranged<br>
on the bottom wall of the filter casing 16. The common<br>
outflow 22 is arranged in the region of the side wall<br>
32 of the filter casing 16. A combination filter<br>
element 102 with a first subelement 104 and a second<br>
subelement 106 is positioned within the filter casing<br>
16, the first subelement 102 having a higher fineness<br>
than the second subelement 106. Both subelements 104<br>
and 106 are formed in a hollow-cylindrical manner and<br>
have in each case on the free end faces a terminating<br>
plate 108 and 110, respectively, with a central<br>
through-opening, and on the mutually facing free end<br>
faces there is disposed in each case an end cap 112 and<br>
114, respectively. By contrast with the exemplary<br>
embodiment represented in figure 1, however, the two<br>
end caps 112, 114 do not form a fluid-tight partition<br>
between the inner spaces of the two subelements 104 and<br>
106, but have in each case a through-opening, a bypass<br>
valve 116 being disposed on the end cap 112 of the<br>
first subelement 104. The bypass valve 116 is<br>
consequently held on the combination filter element 102<br>
and can be removed together with the latter from the<br>
filter housing 12. A separate bypass valve, as used in<br>
the case of the filter device 10, can be omitted in the<br>
case of the filter device 100.<br><br>
The flow onto the first filter element 104 takes place<br>
via the first supply inflow 20 and the terminating<br>
plate 108, the first subelement being flowed through<br>
from the inside outward, as symbolized in figure 3 by<br>
the arrow 118. The second subelement 106 is likewise<br>
flowed through from the inside outward, corresponding<br>
to the arrow 120. The inner spaces of the two<br>
subelements 104 and 106 are in flow connection via the<br>
bypass valve 116, so that in the event of an<br>
impermissible pressure increase at the first subelement<br>
104, a flow connection between the flow-accepting side<br>
of the first subelement 104 and the flow-accepting side<br>
of the second subelement 106 is released. That is to<br>
say, even if the first subelement 104 is bypassed by<br>
means of the bypass valve 116, at least coarse<br>
filtering of the hydraulic fluid still takes place by<br>
means of the second subelement 106.<br>
For the fluid-tight sealing of the annular space 66,<br>
which surrounds the combination filter element 102 and<br>
is in flow connection with the outflow 22, from the<br>
supply inflows 20 and 24, on the terminating plate 108<br>
and 110 there is disposed in each case an annular seal<br>
122 and 124, respectively.<br>
An example of a hydraulic circuit according to the<br>
invention, in which the filter device 100 can be used,<br>
is represented in the manner of a block diagram in<br>
figure 4. In this case, hydraulic fluid is fed to the<br>
filter device 100 from a hydraulic supply 126 via the<br>
second supply inflow 24, associated with the second<br>
subelement 106, and two hydraulic pumps P1 and P2 are<br>
connected to the common outflow 22, downstream of which<br>
pumps there is disposed in each case a consumer 128 and<br>
130, respectively. The latter may, for example, take<br>
the form of a hydraulic steering system.<br><br>
By contrast with the circuit sketched in figure 2, in<br>
the case of the hydraulic circuit according to figure 4<br>
it is provided that only the flow of hydraulic fluid<br>
originating from the consumer 128. is passed via a<br>
return line 132 to the first supply inflow 20 of the<br>
filter device 100, while the flow of hydraulic fluid<br>
delivered by the pump P2 is returned from the consumer<br>
130 directly into the hydraulic supply 126.<br>
If a pressure increase beyond fixed normal values takes<br>
place on the flow-accepting side of the first<br>
subelement 104, a flow connection to the supply inflow<br>
24 of the second subelement 106 is released by the<br>
bypass valve 116, i.e. the hydraulic fluid originating<br>
from the consumer 128 is fed directly to the second<br>
subelement 106, without coming into contact with the<br>
hydraulic fluid located in the hydraulic supply 126.<br>
A further alternative configuration of a filter device<br>
according to the invention is represented in figure 5.<br>
This is denoted overall by the reference 135. It is<br>
configured in a way similar to the filter device 100<br>
explained with reference to figure 3. Used in this<br>
case, however, is a combination filter element 137, the<br>
first and second subelements 139 and 141 of which are<br>
respectively flowed through from the outside inward.<br>
The through-opening disposed on the bottom wall 26 of<br>
the filter casing 16 in this case forms the common<br>
outlet 22 of the filter device 135, while the first<br>
supply inflow 20 and the second supply inflow 24 are<br>
disposed- on the filter head 24 and on the side wall 32<br>
of the filter casing 16, respectively.<br>
To ensure that the hydraulic fluid fed in via the first<br>
supply inflow 20 is filtered exclusively by the finer<br><br>
subelement 139, a sealing ring 147 is held at the<br>
height of the mutually facing end caps 143" and 145,<br>
respectively, of the two subelements 139, 141 on the<br>
combination filter element 137, said sealing ring<br>
axially dividing the annular space 66 surrounding the<br>
combination filter element 137 into two regions, which<br>
are in each case in flow connection with one of the two<br>
supply inflows 20 and 24, respectively.<br>
Disposed on the terminating plate 149 of the first<br>
subelement 139/*, having a central through-opening, is<br>
a bypass valve 151, downstream of which in the<br>
direction of throughflow a screening element 153 is<br>
disposed. If, in the event of an impermissible<br>
pressure increase, the first subelement 139 is<br>
bypassed, in that the bypass valve 151 goes over into<br>
its open position, a flow connection between the first<br>
supply inflow 20 and the common outflow 22 is released,<br>
although it is then ensured by means of the screening<br>
element 153 that the hydraulic fluid fed to the first<br>
supply inflow 20 is freed of coarse dirt particles by<br>
means of the screening element 153 even when the first<br>
subelement is bypassed.<br>
An example of a hydraulic circuit in which the filter<br>
device 135 can be used is represented in figure 6.<br>
This substantially corresponds to the hydraulic circuit<br>
sketched in figure 4, although, by contrast with the<br>
latter, in the event of an impermissible pressure<br>
increase on the flow-accepting side of the first<br>
subelement 139, a direct flow connection to the common<br>
outlet 22 is provided by the bypass valve 151, the<br>
screening element 153 additionally being used, ensuring<br>
coarse filtering of the hydraulic fluid originating<br>
from the hydraulic consumer 128.<br><br>
