				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a device and method for extracting defective<br>
roving (bobbin) out of a multitude of simultaneous roving processes.<br>
When fibers are processed into yarn by means of a spinning process the<br>
quality of the end product is significantly influenced by the process<br>
parameters. In a spinning process a sliver is drafted by which a roving is<br>
created. This is followed by the actual spinning in the ring spinning frame is<br>
which the roving is drafted, twisted and wound. A continuous monitoring of<br>
the creating of the roving which does not influence the process is not known.<br>
The processing of the sliver, which is rolled up loosely in cylindrical cans, into<br>
roving is a particularly critical process which is particularly substantial for the<br>
quality of the end product. The technical challenge of the transformation of<br>
the sliver into yarn by drafting and finally twisting lies in keeping the drafting<br>
force exerted on the sliver such that the thickness of the yarn resulting after<br>
spinning is constant. Because the process in question is continuous and<br>
proceeds at high speed with a medium (sliver/yarn) of quasi endless length it<br>
is unfavorable (practice according to the state of the art) to extract samples<br>
for measurement as the machine must be set back for this purpose.<br>
Mechanical interference in the process is in any case unfavorable because the<br>
small mechanical strength of the sliver and the not yet twisted yarn make it<br>
practically impossible.<br>
Up to now an online monitoring of roving for the most important quality<br>
parameters such as thickness (especially hank), distribution of thickness over<br>
length (especially unevenness, cut length, roving stretch, hank variation)<br>
and/or periodic faults and others was not possible concerning the processing<br>
of fibers. The normal procedure today is to take samples of roving out of the<br>
production process and examine them in the laboratory. This practice however<br>
has various significant disadvantages. The largest disadvantage is the<br>
considerable length of time that passes until the results of the analysis are<br>
available because the machine either continues to work or stands still during<br>
this time. If any fault is discovered, a lot of material and/or a lot of time is<br>
lost. This means that correcting measures are only possible at a later time.<br>
Besides, only the monitoring of one roving process is possible. Normally,<br>
however, more than one hundred roving stations are operated in parallel in<br>
one machine. Thus there is an obvious need for a method and a device which<br>
makes possible a monitoring of the roving which is as constant as possible,<br>
reliable and moderate in cost and which can operate without interference or<br>
even interruption of the production process.<br>
Optical or mechanical sensor systems comprise different disadvantages for<br>
monitoring quality parameters such as thickness, distribution of thickness over<br>
the length, periodical faults and others. Thickness measurements with only<br>
one optical sensor do not yield satisfactory results since the material to be<br>
measured generally does not have a cylindrical cross section. For reliable<br>
optical thickness measurements, more than one optical sensor measuring in<br>
different directions are required. Measurement devices which mechanically act<br>
on the material to be measured cannot be used practically due to the<br>
sensitivity of the fibers in the processing stage.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to solve the problems of facilities<br>
according to the state of the art with a method and a device which especially<br>
works simply, precisely and at moderate cost and, if desired, is also suited to<br>
be integrated into existing facilities. Occurring faults are to be detected as<br>
quickly as possible. The measurement results generated by means of the<br>
facility are on the one hand suitable for detecting problems and representing<br>
them visually and on the other hand for the independent correction of the<br>
parameters influencing the roving process. The stability of the system is to<br>
guarantee the simplicity of the device.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a device for extracting defective<br>
roving (bobbin) out of a multitude of simultaneous roving processes,<br>
comprises : a module for periodically or continuously generating measured<br>
values of each of said simultaneous roving processes ; a module for<br>
dynamically calculating a reference value from at least one of said measured<br>
values ; a module for comparing each of said measured values with said<br>
reference value ; a module for sending and/or displaying a separation signal<br>
by which defective rovings are separated ; and, means such as sensors (1.1<br>
to 1.8), at multiple production positions, for sensing relevant material<br>
parameters such as quality and volume of fiber material, and for analyzing the<br>
information, thus obtained, by comparing the results tested at various points<br>
in time within a single process, in order to determine parameters such as<br>
herein described. The device may have a module for sending and/or<br>
displaying information for localizing said defective rovings and/or information<br>
about the degree of deviation from said reference value and/or a module for<br>
calculating said reference value from a representative subensemble of said<br>
measuring values. The composition of said subensemble is changed<br>
periodically or non-periodically with time. The preliminary reference values are<br>
calculated from at least two subgroups, each subgroup consisting of a<br>
selection of said measured values, said preliminary reference values are<br>
compared with each other, and the measured values forming a subgroup<br>
are excluded from calculating said reference value if the preliminary reference<br>
value from said subgroup deviates from another preliminary reference value<br>
by a defined deviation. The device may have a module for automatically<br>
eliminating said roving processes after receiving said separation signal. Said<br>
measured values are selected from the group consisting of thickness,<br>
especially hank ; distribution of thickness over length, especially unevenness,<br>
cut length, roving stretch, hank variation ; and/or periodic faults of said roving<br>
process. The device may have a module for calculating a statistical<br>
distribution from said measured values and for subsequently evaluating,<br>
classifying and, if desired, saving in a library statistical characteristics of said<br>
distribution. Environmental influences are compensated by evaluating and<br>
comparing said measured values with said reference value. The device may<br>
have a module for a periodical or continuous generation of measuring values<br>
within one roving process. Said sensor measures the fiber mass and said<br>
sensor is a capacitive sensor. The device comprises a processing unit, which<br>
serves to control a drafting mechanism, and a servo unit standing in a<br>
functional connection with said processing unit.<br>
The invention also provides a method for extracting defective roving (bobbin)<br>
out of a multitude of simultaneous roving processes, comprising the steps of:<br>
periodically or continuously generating measured values for each of said<br>
simultaneous roving processes ; dynamically calculating a reference value<br>
from at least one of said measured values ; comparing each of said<br>
measured values with said reference value ; sending and/or displaying a<br>
separation signal by which defective rovings are separated ; sensing and<br>
analyzing the information thus obtained by comparing the results tested at<br>
various points in time within a single process ; and, obtaining defect-free<br>
roving (bobbin) out of defective roving, so extracted.<br>
The invention disclosed makes it possible for the first time to monitor<br>
and analyze the most important quality parameters such as thickness<br>
(hank, etc.), distribution of thickness over the length (unevenness %,<br>
cut length CV %, roving stretch, hank variation, etc.), periodical faults<br>
and others in real time by means of registration of the parameters<br>
influencing the production process by means of sensors and leading<br>
them to a suitable analyzing unit.<br>
The invention disclosed preferably monitors the relevant material<br>
parameters by means of capacitive sensors. These have the<br>
characteristics that they determine the volume of the fiber<br>
material and thus do not depend on its form and arrangement.<br>
Furthermore these sensors react in a very short time which,<br>
even with the very fast processes in question, allows a sufficiently fast registration <br>
of all relevant and interesting parameters.<br>
Because the fibers to be processed are in general natural products it is important <br>
that their characteristics which vary with changing environmental conditions <br>
are taken into consideration. Especially varying temperatures and air<br>
humidity must be taken into consideration. Even the advantageously used<br>
capacitive sensors are subject to certain environmental influences. These can<br>
be taken into consideration by a corresponding additional installation in the<br>
process in order to compensate a possible drift of the facility. This kind of<br>
solution however is relatively complicated and subject to disturbances.<br>
The invention disclosed here solves this problem in a very elegant, superior<br>
way. Because in any case many equal processes (normally more than one<br>
hundred) run in parallel and generally each of these is inventively monitored<br>
online a simple but all the same convincing advantage of this invention is that<br>
it takes advantage of this plurality. For this purpose a starting condition is<br>
determined in which the parameters of a choice of relevant parallel processes<br>
(of a subgroup) are determined to serve as reference. Then the statistic distribution <br>
of a relevant subgroup which is however constantly acquired and<br>
updated is considered and compared with the considered stations such that<br>
possibly occurring outliers can be detected immediately and if desired<br>
represented graphically and removed. Furthermore the statistical distribution<br>
of all measured values is determined from the subgroups which constantly<br>
change in their assembly in time. This constantly changing distribution curve is<br>
compared to experimental values stored in a library which serve for the<br>
determination of unusual conditions.<br>
If the environmental conditions change for all observed stations this has no<br>
influence on the detection of outliers as the reference value and its statistical<br>
distribution on average changes regularly for all parallel processes and the<br>
arrangement gets along without additional sensors. Naturally additional parameters <br>
can be taken into consideration if required. The facility, however, is<br>
kept in an inherently stable condition by its inventive arrangement which<br>
condition takes advantage of the availability of the measured values of a relevant <br>
subgroup or all processes running parallel in an aimed manner. Thus<br>
unwanted deviations can be eliminated manually or by means of a suitable<br>
control circuit. The registered data is represented graphically and analyzed<br>
statistically such that it serves in helping making decisions for the management <br>
and as data source for the course of the process.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The inventive functional principle and examples of embodiments are explained <br>
in more detail in connection with the following figures by means of examples <br>
and diagrams. The invention is however not restricted to such embodiments <br>
but can, if desired, be extended to similar applications.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a possible distribution curve of measured values.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a possible distribution curve of displaced and unwanted<br>
measured values.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a schematic representation of a roving facility.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a capacitive sensor and a drafting mechanism in a three-<br>
dimensional view.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a capacitive sensor and a drafting mechanism in a two-<br>
dimensional view.<br>
Fig. 6 shows eight coupled sensors with a measuring box in a three-<br>
dimensional view.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a capacitive sensor and a drafting mechanism in a three-<br>
dimensional view.<br>
Figure 1 shows a possible statistic distribution of a relevant amount of measured <br>
values which is determined from a subgroup of considered sensor values.<br>
The abscise X diagrammatically shows the actual deviation from a determined<br>
starting value (here, e.g., zero) and the ordinate Y shows the occurrence of<br>
the sensor values. The distribution of the measured values over the observed<br>
sensor values is made clear by curve K. The facility described here is adjusted<br>
such that the mean value M of all observed measured results is at a deviation<br>
X from zero. This curve is a reference for the other sensors. Measured values<br>
which are within a defined bandwidth B fulfill the desired quality prescriptions. <br>
The values outside are indicated, examined and possibly corrected or<br>
sorted out. The determined reference data is in general compared to stored<br>
data from a database. In this manner dangerous conditions can be additionally<br>
recognized and impeded.<br>
Figure 2 shows the effect of a drifting of the facility. If the measured values of<br>
all the sensors observed for the forming of reference change due to changed<br>
environmental influences, this has no influence on the determination of outliers.<br>
 Due to a drifting of the facility the measured values are displaced in this<br>
case, the mean value and distribution are displaced evenly, as shown by arrow<br>
D in Figure 2. Mean value M and distribution curve K are as before, still<br>
references relatively to which the measured values are compared although<br>
these have been displaced due to drifting. The band width B of the tolerable<br>
measured values is also determined relatively to mean value M and from<br>
experimental values stored in a library.<br>
A further important value for judging the process is the form of distribution<br>
curve K. If this curve deviates considerably from the experimental values<br>
Stored in a library, which is exemplified by means of curve K* the process<br>
must also be examined. This kind of unwanted form of distribution curve K*<br>
 can be caused by measured values from one part of the facility which deviate<br>
from the norm. For this reason it is sensible to determine the reference values<br>
at a lower level of the facility. Thus regions with problems can be determined<br>
and turned off faster by which the monitoring process of the facility is spared<br>
of unwanted measured values. The measured values and the determined reference <br>
values are, if required, stored in a library such that they are available<br>
for the later finding of a decision.<br>
Considering these observations it becomes obvious that the facility advantageously <br>
references concerning its own mean value M and experimental values<br>
and thus has an inherent stability which cannot be brought out of balance by<br>
changing influences. Due to this stabilization referring to the mean value and<br>
the experimental values and the modular design of the facility a compensation<br>
of the sensor drifting and a processing true to time of all relevant measured<br>
values is actually possible.<br>
Figure 3 diagrammatically shows a preferred design of a roving facility. The<br>
basic modules 6.1 to 6.8 consisting of a collector-circuit-module control unit 5<br>
(termed CCM control unit in the following) and eight sensors 1.1 to 1.8 can<br>
be seen. (The CCM control unit and the sensors are not numbered in Fig. 3<br>
in order to allow a better general view. For further details of a basic module<br>
6.1 to 6.8, cf. Fig. 6.) Individual basic modules 6.1 to 6.8 are connected to<br>
each other and to a machine-processing station 25 (termed MP station in the<br>
following) by means of data transfer lines 20. The energy supply of all elements <br>
can be simultaneously guaranteed via the data transfer lines 20. An MP<br>
station typically receives the data of fifteen CCM control units 5. Different<br>
MP stations 25.1 to 25.5 are connected in succession and connected to a central <br>
processing unit 26. The central processing unit 26 can again register and<br>
analyze the data of several such chains of MP stations 25.<br>
With the preferred embodiment shown here the data of all sensors 1 is registered <br>
and analyzed. The modular design of the facility with its preferred<br>
branched design makes it possible to maintain control over complex facilities.<br>
Environmental influences which possibly change and the drift of the facility<br>
generally create the necessity for additional sensors and correcting variables in<br>
order to compensate these changes. With the inventively combined, modular<br>
design shown here no additional measured values are required. Naturally it is<br>
possible to take additional values into account if required. The facility, however, <br>
is in general inventively inherently stable. Because the object is to detect<br>
outliers it is sufficient to use measured data of a relevant subgroup of sensors,<br>
which however constantly may change its composition, to form a reference<br>
value and a reference distribution. The forming of reference data is advantageously <br>
carried out centrally on the level of a central processing unit 26. In<br>
order not to distort the reference value when a problematic condition is on<br>
hand it is useful, with larger facilities, to determine reference values on lower<br>
levels, e.g. on the level of the MP stations 25 such that this branch can be<br>
switched off when the reference data deviates considerably from norm such<br>
that negative influences do not spread into the whole facility.<br>
It can be presumed that even when the measured results drift due to changing<br>
environmental influences which act on the sensors or the electronics this does<br>
not cause problems. Even though the drift varies from sensor to sensor in a<br>
random manner, the statistical drift of each individual sensor corresponds to<br>
the statistical drift of all sensors. Due to this circumstance the facility<br>
generally does not require additional measured values as it references and<br>
stabilizes itself relatively to a mean value determined from its own statistical<br>
data. Thus it is also guaranteed that even at very high processing speeds a<br>
precise registration and analysis of all measured values is guaranteed. A<br>
further advantage of this modular inherently stable design is that the facility is<br>
especially suitable for combination with existing facilities as no modification of<br>
the facility is required.<br>
The arrangement according to the invention is not only able to find outliers<br>
between the single roving processes, it is also suitable to identify outliers<br>
within each roving process by comparing the results tested at various points in<br>
time within a single process. This will help determine parameters such as<br>
unevenness, cut length, roving stretch, hank variation and periodic faults.<br>
Figure 4 shows a capacitive sensor 1 advantageously consisting of two sensor<br>
plates 10.1 and 10.2 for the measurement of the capacity and a casing 11,<br>
which is for fixing of the sensor (not shown in detail here) and contains sensor<br>
electronics (not shown in detail). Via a connecting cable 12 sensor 1 is supplied <br>
with energy, monitored and measured data is transmitted. Roving 3 is<br>
moved in the direction indicated by arrow P through a measuring field 13<br>
which is between the two sensor plates 10.1 and 10.2. The roving 13 influences<br>
measuring field 13 in dependence of the volume of fibers located in measuring <br>
field 13. The thus caused change in measuring field 13 is registered and<br>
fed into analysis via connecting cable 12.<br>
A CCM control unit is for control, monitoring and registration of the measured <br>
data from sensor 1 and if necessary of a drafting mechanism 2. It is<br>
connected with other components via a connecting cable 19.<br>
The roving 3 is pulled through rolls 15.1 and 15.2 in the direction indicated by<br>
arrow P. By means of drafting mechanism 2, consisting of a fixed roll 15.1 and<br>
a roll 15.2 adjustable relatively to roll 15.1 at a distance A (cf. Fig. 5) in the<br>
shown embodiment, a defined drafting force is exerted on the roving 3. The<br>
drafting force is adjusted by the distance between the two rolls 15.1 and 15.2.<br>
The material to be processed located outside rolls 15.1 and 15.2 is termed<br>
sliver 4. Rolls 15.1 and 15.2 are slewably fitted on axes 16.1 and 16.2 (cf.<br>
Figure 5) and, if required, can also be driven. In the shown, embodiment axis<br>
16.1 is rigidly fixed to a casing 17. Axis 16.2 and with it roll 15.2 is also fixed<br>
to casing 17 and can, in opposition to roll 15.1, be dislocated radially in its<br>
axial distance A (cf. Figure 5). For this purpose there is a manually or remotely <br>
controllable adjusting mechanism (not shown in detail) inside casing 17.<br>
Of course, in order to achieve drafting which is adapted to the characteristics<br>
of the material of sliver 4 to be processed into roving 3, technically equivalent<br>
solutions can be provided by means of embodiments with more rolls than the<br>
embodiment with the two rolls 16.1 and 16.2 shown here (cf. Fig. 7). The momentary <br>
pressing force of rolls 16.1 and 16.2 can be determined and analyzed<br>
by means of pressure sensors of e.g. piezoelectric nature which are also preferably <br>
located in casing 17. The energy supply and transmission of measuring<br>
and adjusting signals of drafting mechanism 2 and the adjusting mechanisms<br>
on the inside of casing 17 are carried out via a connecting cable 18. The here<br>
shown facility can also include measurement of parameters to obtain information <br>
on production related aspects like length of roving, production<br>
strips, weight of roving and others.<br>
Figure 5 shows sensor 1, drafting mechanism 2, roving 3 and sliver 4 viewed<br>
from behind. The back side of casing 17 of drafting mechanism 2 is removed<br>
(which is indicated by the hatching) such that axes 16.1 and 16.2 of rolls 15.1<br>
and 15.2 can be seen. Distance A of axes 16.1 and 16.2 is variable such that<br>
the pressing force acting on roving 3 or sliver 4 can be adjusted. The CCM<br>
control unit 5 is for registration and transmission of the measured data and<br>
monitoring of sensor 1 and drafting mechanism 2. These elements form a<br>
basic unit and can be extended with additional sensors if required. One such<br>
module is advantageously used for the online monitoring of one roving process.<br>
Figure 6 shows a further embodiment in which a modular basic unit 6 consists<br>
of a CCM control unit 5 and eight sensors 1.1 to 1.8. The design of a module<br>
6 basically depends on the concept of the CCM control unit 5 and thus can<br>
function in spite of the difference in appearance. Here the arrangement of<br>
sensors 1.1 to 1.8 is chosen such that the roving 3.1 to 3.8 is guided through<br>
the sensor plates 10.1 to 10.8 from top to bottom. The CCM control unit 5 is<br>
advantageously designed such that it can register the results of all eight sensors <br>
1.1 to 1.8 sequentially at very short time intervals or in parallel.<br>
Figure 7 shows another preferred embodiment comprising a sensor 1, drafting<br>
mechanisms 2.1 to 2.4, a CCM control unit 5, a roving 3, a sliver 4, and<br>
connecting cables 12, 18, 19. The three drafting mechanisms 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3<br>
are controlled by the CCM control unit 5 and are responsible for the<br>
adjustment of the thickness and the correction of long term faults of the<br>
sliver. They receive their response from the sensor 1 in functional connection<br>
with the CCM control unit 5. The drafting mechanism 2.4 is also controlled by<br>
the CCM sensor unit 5 and is located on the opposite side of the sensor 1 so<br>
that the sliver 4 passes first the drafting units 2.1 to 2.3 and the measuring<br>
filed 13 of sensor 1 and then passes the drafting unit 2.4. While the drafting<br>
units 2.1 to 2.3 are responsible for long term corrections, the drafting unit 2.4<br>
is foreseen to correct short term and random faults. It is also controlled by<br>
sensor 1 in functional connection with CCM sensor unit 5. If desired the<br>
precision of this preferred arrangement can be enhanced to meet specific<br>
targets by adding more sensors 1 and/or drafting units 2.<br>

1. A device for extracting defective roving (bobbin) out of a multitude<br>
of simultaneous roving processes, comprising :<br>
a module for periodically or continuously generating measured<br>
values of each of said simultaneous roving processes ;<br>
a module for dynamically calculating a reference value from at<br>
least one of said measured values ;<br>
a module for comparing each of said measured values with said<br>
reference value ;<br>
a module for sending and/or displaying a separation signal by<br>
which defective ravings are separated ; and,<br>
means such as sensors (1.1 to 1.8), at multiple production<br>
positions, for sensing relevant material parameters such as quality and<br>
volume of fiber material, and for analyzing the information, thus obtained, by<br>
comparing the results tested at various points in time within a single process,<br>
in order to determine parameters such as herein described.<br>
2. The device as claimed in claim 1 comprising a module for sending<br>
and/or displaying information for localizing said defective ravings and/or<br>
information about the degree of deviation from said reference value.<br>
3. The device as claimed in claim 1 comprising a module for<br>
calculating said reference value from a representative subensemble of said<br>
measuring values.<br>
4. The device as claimed in claim 3 wherein the composition of said<br>
subensemble is changed periodically or non-periodically with time.<br>
axial distance A (cf. Figure 5). For this purpose there is a manually or remotely <br>
controllable adjusting mechanism (not shown in detail) inside casing 17.<br>
Of course, in order to achieve drafting which is adapted to the characteristics<br>
of the material of sliver 4 to be processed into roving 3, technically equivalent<br>
solutions can be provided by means of embodiments with more rolls than the<br>
embodiment with the two rolls 16.1 and 16.2 shown here (cf. Fig. 7). The momentary <br>
pressing force of rolls 16.1 and 16.2 can be determined and analyzed<br>
by means of pressure sensors of e.g. piezoelectric nature which are also preferably <br>
located in casing 17. The energy supply and transmission of measuring<br>
and adjusting signals of drafting mechanism 2 and the adjusting mechanisms<br>
on the inside of casing 17 are carried out via a connecting cable 18. The here<br>
shown facility can also include measurement of parameters to obtain information <br>
on production related aspects like length of roving, production<br>
stops, weight of roving and others.<br>
Figure 5 shows sensor 1, drafting mechanism 2, roving 3 and sliver 4 viewed<br>
from behind. The back side of casing 17 of drafting mechanism 2 is removed<br>
(which is indicated by the hatching) such that axes 16.1 and 16.2 of rolls 15.1<br>
and 15.2 can be seen. Distance A of axes 16.1 and 16.2 is variable such that<br>
the pressing force acting on roving 3 or sliver 4 can be adjusted. The CCM<br>
control unit 5 is for registration and transmission of the measured data and<br>
monitoring of sensor 1 and drafting mechanism 2. These elements form a<br>
basic unit and can be extended with additional sensors if required. One such<br>
module is advantageously used for the online monitoring of one roving process.<br>
dynamically calculating a reference value from at least one of said<br>
measured values ;<br>
comparing each of said measured values with said reference<br>
value ;<br>
sending and/or displaying a separation signal by which defective<br>
rovings are separated ;<br>
sensing and analyzing the information thus obtained by<br>
comparing the results tested at various points in time within a single process ;<br>
and,<br>
obtaining defect-free roving (bobbin) out of defective roving , so<br>
extracted.<br>
12. The method of claim 11 wherein said separation signal comprises<br>
information for localizing said defective rovings and/or information about the<br>
degree of deviation from said reference value.<br>
13. The method of claim 11 wherein said reference is calculated from<br>
a representative subensemble of said measuring values.<br>
14. The method of claim 13 wherein the composition of said<br>
subensemble changes periodically or non-periodically with time.<br>
15. The method of claim 11 wherein preliminary reference values are<br>
calculated from at least two subgroups, each subgroup consisting of a<br>
selection of said measured values, said preliminary reference values are<br>
compared with each other, and the measured values forming a subgroup are<br>
excluded from calculating said reference value if the preliminary reference<br>
value from said subgroup deviates from another preliminary reference value<br>
by a defined deviation.<br>
16. The method as claimed in claim 11 wherein defective ravings are<br>
eliminated manually or automatically after receiving said separation signal.<br>
17. The method as claimed in claim 11 wherein said measured values<br>
are selected from the group consisting of thickness, especially hank ;<br>
distribution of thickness over length, especially unevenness, cut length, roving<br>
stretch, hank variation ; and/or periodic faults of said roving process.<br>
18. The method as claimed in claim 11 wherein a statistical<br>
distribution is calculated from said measured values, and subsequently<br>
statistical characteristics of said distribution are evaluated, classified and, if<br>
desired, saved in a library for later decision finding.<br>
19. The method as claimed in claim 11 wherein environmental<br>
influences are caused to be compensated by evaluating and comparing said<br>
measured values with said reference value.<br>
20. The method as claimed in claim 11 comprising a periodical or<br>
continuous generation of measuring values within one roving process.<br>
21. A device for carrying out the method as claimed in claim 11<br>
comprising a sensor for measuring the fiber mass.<br>
22. The device as claimed in claim 21 wherein said sensor is a<br>
capacitive sensor.<br>
23. The device as claimed in claim 21 comprising a processing unit,<br>
which serves to control a drafting mechanism, and a servo unit standing in a<br>
functional connection with said processing unit.<br>
24. A device for extracting defective roving (bobbin) out of a<br>
multitude of simultaneous roving processes, substantially as herein<br>
described, particularly with reference to and as illustrated in the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
25. A method for extracting defective roving (bobbin) out of a<br>
multitude of simultaneous roving processes, substantially as herein<br>
described, particularly with reference to and as illustrated in the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
The invention disclosed makes it possible to monitor and analyze<br>
the most important fiber quality parameters such as thickness, distribution of<br>
thickness over the length, periodical faults and others in real time by means<br>
of registration of the parameters influencing the production process by means<br>
of sensors and leading them to a suitable analyzing unit. A device for<br>
extracting defective roving (bobbin) out of a multitude of simultaneous roving<br>
processes, comprises : a module for periodically or continuously generating<br>
measured values of each of said simultaneous roving processes ; a module<br>
for dynamically calculating a reference value from at least one of said<br>
measured values ; a module for comparing each of said measured values<br>
with said reference value ; a module for sending and/or displaying a<br>
separation signal by which defective rovings are separated ; and, means such<br>
as sensors (1.1 to 1.8), at multiple production positions, for sensing relevant<br>
material parameters such as quality and volume of fiber material, and for<br>
analyzing the information, thus obtained, by comparing the results tested at<br>
various points in time within a single process, in order to determine<br>
parameters such as herein described.</td>
