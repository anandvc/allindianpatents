SPACE-TIME SCRAMBLING FOR CELLULAR SYSTEMS<br>
I.        Claim of Priority under 35 U.S.C. §119<br>
[0001]	The present Application for Patent claims priority to Provisional Application<br>
Serial No. 60/663,504, entitled "Space-Time Scrambling for Cellular Systems," filed March 18, 2005, and Provisional Application Serial No. 60/710,502, entitled "Space-Time Scrambling for Cellular Systems," filed August 22, 2005, both assigned to the assignee hereof, and expressly incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
I.	Field<br>
[0002]	The present disclosure relates generally to communication, and more specifically<br>
to techniques for transmitting data in cellular systems.<br>
II.	Background<br>
[0003]	A cellular system is a wireless multiple-access communication system that can<br>
concurrently communicate with multiple terminals, e.g., cellular phones. A cellular system may utilize a multiple-access technique such as Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), or Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA).<br>
[0004]	A cellular system often employs multiple antennas to achieve higher throughput<br>
and/or greater reliability for data transmission on the downlink to the terminals. A terminal may estimate the downlink channel response and may send feedback information to a base station. The base station may then spatially process the data transmission for the terminal based on the feedback information. For example, the base station may perform beamforming in order to steer the data transmission toward the terminal.<br>
[0005]	Spatial processing based on feedback information (e.g., beamforming) may be<br>
undesirable for several reasons. First, overhead is incurred to send the feedback information from the terminal to the base station. Second, feedback-based spatial processing for the recipient terminals may degrade the performance of other terminals communicating with other base stations.    The data transmission to the recipient<br><br>
WO 2006/102252	PCT/US2006/010084<br><br>
3<br>
terminals causes interference to the other terminals, and the spatial processing based on<br>
the feedback information may result in the interference being unpredictable to these<br>
other terminals. The unpredictable fluctuation in the interference observed by these<br>
other terminals may degrade both the accuracy of their measurements of the wireless<br>
channels and the predictability of the channel properties. The reduced measurement<br>
accuracy and channel predictability degrade link adaptation for these other terminals.<br>
[0006]	There is therefore a need in the art for techniques to transmit data in cellular<br>
systems.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007]	Techniques for transmitting data with space-time scrambling in cellular systems<br>
(e.g., CDMA systems) are described herein. Space-time scrambling refers to the processing of a data stream in a time-variant but deterministic manner such that the data stream is sent via multiple antennas and achieves diversity and possibly other desirable benefits. Depending on the manner in which space-time scrambling is performed, diversity may be achieved over spatial domain or both spatial and temporal domains. Space-time scrambling may be used to implement various multiple-input multiple-output (MEMO) and multiple-input single-output (MISO) transmission schemes. M1MO transmission schemes are characterized by the mapping of one or multiple data streams to multiple antennas. Space-time scrambling may also be used for various applications such as, e.g., High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) in the 3GPP W-CDMA standard.<br>
[0008]	According to an embodiment of the invention, an apparatus (e.g., for a base<br>
station) is described which includes a processor and at least two transmitter units. The processor generates at least one stream of data symbols and performs space-time scrambling on the at least one stream of data symbols (e.g., by performing matrix multiplication with a sequence of matrices) to generate at least two streams of output chips. The transmitter units transmit the at least two streams of output chips from at least two antennas to at least one receiver (e.g., for at least one terminal) in a cellular system.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0029]	The word "exemplary" is used herein to mean "serving as an example, instance,<br>
or illustration." Any embodiment described herein as "exemplary" is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments.<br>
[0030]	The transmission techniques described herein may be used for various cellular<br>
systems such as CDMA systems, TDMA systems, FDMA systems, OFDMA systems, and so on. A CDMA system may implement one or more CDMA radio access technologies (RATs) such as Wideband-CDMA (W-CDMA), cdma2000, and so on. cdma2000 covers IS-2000, IS-856, and IS-95 standards. A CDMA system may thus be a W-CDMA system or a cdma2000 system. A TDMA system may implement one or more TDMA RATs such as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), Digital Advanced Mobile Phone System (D-AMPS), and so on. These various RATs and standards are known in the art. W-CDMA and GSM are described in documents from an organization named "3rd Generation Partnership Project" (3GPP). cdma2000 is described in documents from an organization named "3rd Generation Partnership<br><br>
WO 2006/102252	PCT/US2006/010084<br>
7<br>
Project 2" (3GPP2). 3GPP and 3GPP2 documents are publicly available. For clarity, the transmission techniques are described below for a W-CDMA system.<br>
[0031]	FIG. 1 shows a cellular system 100 with multiple base stations 110 and multiple<br>
terminals 120. A base station is generally a fixed station that communicates with the terminals and may also be called a Node B (3GPP terminology), an access point, or some other terminology. Each base station 110 provides communication coverage for a particular geographic area 102. The term "cell" can refer to a base station and/or its coverage area depending on the context in which the term is used. To improve system capacity, the base station coverage area may be partitioned into multiple smaller areas, e.g., three smaller areas 104a, 104b, and 104c. Each smaller area is served by a respective base transceiver subsystem (BTS). The term "sector" can refer to a BTS and/or its coverage area depending on the context in which the term is used. For a sectorized cell, the BTSs for all sectors of that cell are typically co-located within the base station for the cell. A radio network controller 130 couples to base stations 110 and provides coordination and control for these base stations.<br>
[0032]	A terminal may be fixed or mobile and may also be called a user equipment<br>
(UE) (3GPP terminology), a mobile station, a wireless device, or some other terminology. A terminal may be a cellular phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a wireless modem card, and so on. A terminal may communicate with zero, one, or multiple base stations on the downlink and uplink at any given moment. The downlink (or forward link) refers to the communication link from the base stations to the terminals, and the uplink (or reverse link) refers to the communication link from the terminals to the base stations. In the following description, a serving base station is a base station with which a terminal communicates. A neighbor base station is a base station from which a terminal may receive pilot and overhead information but not user data.<br>
[0033]	3GPP supports High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA), which is a set of<br>
channels and procedures that enables high-speed packet data transmission on the downlink. For HSDPA, a High Speed Downlink Shared Channel (HS-DSCH), which is a transport channel, carries data for individual terminals. The HS-DSCH is processed (e.g., encoded) and mapped to one or more High Speed Physical Downlink Shared Channels (HS-PDSCHs), which are physical channels. The HS-PDSCHs may carry data in a time division multiplexed (TDM) manner or in a TDM and code division<br><br>
WO 2006/102252	8	PCT/US2006/010084<br>
multiplexed (CDM) manner to the terminals. Control information for the HS-PDSCHs is sent on one or more Shared Control Channels for the HS-DSCHs (HS-SCCHs), which are physical channels. The control information includes various parameters used by the terminals to properly receive the HS-PDSCHs.<br>
[0034]	FIG. 2 shows various physical channels used for downlink transmission to the<br>
terminals. For 3GPP Release 5, a base station may transmit up to 15 HS-PDSCHs on the downlink for HSDPA. The HS-PDSCHs are shared among all terminals under the coverage of the base station. Each HS-PDSCH is assigned a specific channelization code with a spreading factor of 16 (SF = 16). The channelization codes for the HS-PDSCHs and other physical channels in W-CDMA are called orthogonal variable spreading factor (OVSF) codes. A spreading factor of 16 means that the channelization code is a sequence of 16 chips. Data for individual terminals is processed as transport blocks on the HS-DSCH. Each transport block is sent on one or more HS-PDSCHs in one transmission time interval (TTI).<br>
[0035]	The base station may also transmit up to four HS-SCCHs on the downlink. Each<br>
HS-SCCH is assigned a specific channelization code with a spreading factor of 128 (SF = 128). The HS-SCCHs are also shared among all terminals and carry control information for the HS-PDSCHs. The control information indicates the channelization codes, the modulation scheme, the recipient terminal for each HS-PDSCH, and other information needed for HS-PDSCH processing at the terminal. The base station sends the control information on the HS-SCCHs two slots ahead of the corresponding packet transmissions on the HS-PDSCHs. The base station may serve one or more terminals in each TTI. A served terminal receives control information from only one HS-SCCH but may receive data from one or multiple HS-PDSCHs.<br>
[0036]	The HS-PDSCHs and HS-SCCHs for HSDPA are described in various 3GPP<br>
documents including TS 25.211, TS 25.212, TS 25.213, TS 25.214, TS 25.308, and TR 25.858, all of which are publicly available.<br>
[0037]	Each terminal that is receiving HSDPA is also assigned a downlink Dedicated<br>
Physical Channel (DPCH), which is called an associated DPCH when used for HSDPA. The associated DPCH may be used to send higher layer control information and power control information to the terminal. The associated DPCH is assigned a specific channelization code with a spreading factor of 256. Each terminal continually monitors its associated DPCH.<br><br>
WO 2006/102252	PCT/US2006/010084<br>
9<br>
[0038]	Each terminal that is receiving HSDPA also processes common physical<br>
channels (or simply, common channels) such as a Primary Common Control Physical Channel (P-CCPCH) and a Common Pilot Channel (CPICH). The common channels are sent to all terminals under the coverage of the base station. The P-CCPCH carries a Broadcast Channel (BCH) that carries system-specific and cell-specific information for the terminals. The timing of the P-CCPCH is used as a time reference for common and shared channels. The frame timing of the CPICH, HS-PDSCHs, and HS-SCCHs is related to the timing of the P-CCPCH. The frame timing of dedicated physical channels (e.g., the associated DPCH) may or may not be aligned with the frame timing of the P-CCPCH. The CPICH carries a pilot that is used by the terminals for various functions such as estimation of the wireless channel response, pilot strength, received signal quality, and so on. Each common channel is assigned a specific channelization code with a specific spreading factor. For the P-CCPCH and CPICH, the spreading factor is 256.<br>
[0039]	Table 1 lists some of the downlink physical channels that a terminal may process<br>
when receiving HSDPA from a base station. Each physical channel is assigned a specific channelization code. The spreading factors for the different types of physical channels are given in Table 1.<br>
Table 1 - Downlink Physical Channels<br><br>
Physical Channel	Spreading Factor	Max Num of Channels	Description<br>
HS-DPSCH	16	15 per base station	Carry user data for specific terminals.<br>
HS-SCCH	128	4 per base station	Carry signaling for the HS-PDSCHs.<br>
Associated DPCH	256	1 per terminal	Carry control information for a specific terminal.<br>
Common Channels	256	1 set per base station	Carry broadcast and overhead data and pilot from a base station.<br>
[0040]	FIG. 3 shows a frame structure for HSDPA.  The timeline for transmission on<br>
the downlink is divided into radio frames. Each radio frame is identified by a 12-bit system frame number (SFN) that is transmitted on a control channel. Each radio frame has a duration of 10 milliseconds (ms) and is further partitioned into 15 slots, which are<br><br>
WO 2006/102252	PCT/US2006/010084<br>
10<br>
labeled as slot 0 through slot 14. Each slot includes 2560 chips and has a duration of 2/3 ms. Each chip has a duration of 260.42 nanoseconds (ns) for a chip rate of 3.84 megachips/second (Mcps).<br>
[0041]	The HS-PDSCHs are transmitted in TTIs, which are also called sub-frames.<br>
Each TTI spans three slots and has a duration of 2 ms. A new TTI for the HS-PDSCHs starts at the frame boundary. The HS-PDSCHs are assigned channelization codes with spreading factor of 16. Hence, a data symbol is sent on an HS-PDSCH in a symbol period of 16 chips. For the HS-PDSCHs, each TTI includes 480 symbol periods, and each symbol period includes 16 chips. A data symbol may be a modulation symbol for data. Data symbols may be spread with a channelization code to generate output chips.<br>
[0042]	FIG. 4 shows a block diagram of an embodiment of base station 110 and two<br>
terminals 120x and 120y in cellular system 100. Base station 110 is equipped with multiple (T) antennas 434a through 434t, terminal 120x is equipped with a single antenna 452x, and terminal 120y is equipped with multiple (R) antennas 452a through 452r. For simplicity, FIG. 4 shows only the processing units for downlink transmission from the base station to the terminals.<br>
[0043]	At base station 110, a TX data processor 420 receives user data (e.g., for<br>
HSDPA) from a data source 412 and control and overhead data from a controller/ processor 440. TX data processor 420 processes the various types of data and generates one or more (S) streams of data chips. A space-time scrambler 430 performs space-time scrambling on the S streams of data chips and provides multiple (T) streams of output chips to T transmitter units (TMTRs) 432a through 432t. Each transmitter unit 432 processes (e.g., converts to analog, filters, amplifies, and frequency upconverts) its output chip stream and generates a downlink signal. The downlink signals from transmitter units 432a through 432t are transmitted from antennas 434a through 434t, respectively.<br>
[0044]	At each terminal 120, one or multiple antennas 452 receive the transmitted<br>
downlink signals, and each antenna provides a received signal to a respective receiver unit (RCVR) 454. Each receiver unit 454 processes (e.g., filters, amplifies, frequency downconverts, and digitizes) its received signal and provides a stream of input samples. For multi-antenna terminal 120y, a space-time descrambler 460y performs space-time descrambling on the input samples and provides descrambled samples. For each terminal, a receive (RX) data processor 470 processes the input samples or the<br><br>

scrambler 430a, which are an embodiment of TX data processor 420 and space-time scrambler 430, respectively, at base station 110 in FIG. 4. For this embodiment, TX data processor 420a includes a data processor 510 for the HS-PDSCHs, a data processor 512 for the HS-SCCHs, a data processor 514 for the associated DPCH, and a data processor 516 for the common channels (e.g., the P-CCPCH and CPICH). TX data processor 420a may also include other data processors for other physical channels, which are not shown in FIG. 5A for simplicity.<br>
[0047]	Within data processor 510 for the HS-PDSCHs, a coding and symbol mapping<br>
unit 520 receives user data to be sent to the terminals and demultiplexes the user data into D data streams to be transmitted in parallel, where in general D &gt; 1. Unit 520 processes each data stream and provides a corresponding stream of data symbols. The processing by unit 520 may include CRC attachment, bit scrambling, channel encoding (e.g., with a Turbo code, a convolutional code, a block code, and so on), rate matching, interleaving, symbol mapping (or modulation), and so on. Unit 520 may process each data stream in accordance with fixed coding and modulation schemes. Alternatively, unit 520 may process each data stream in accordance with adaptive coding and modulation schemes, which may be selected based on feedback received from the recipient terminals.<br>

[0049]	A space-time processing unit 522 receives D data symbol streams from unit 520,<br>
performs space-time processing, and provides S output symbol streams, where in general 1  D. In an embodiment, unit 522 provides each data<br><br>
WO 2006/102252	12	PCT/US2006/010084<br><br>
symbol stream as an output symbol stream, and each output symbol is equal to a data symbol. In another embodiment, unit 522 implements space-time transmit diversity (STTD) and maps each data symbol stream into two output symbol streams. Unit 522 may perform STTD as follows. For each pair of data symbols, {sa and Sb}, to be sent in two symbol periods for a given data symbol stream, unit 522 generates two symbol pairs, {sa and Sb} and {-s*b and s*a}, where " * " denotes a complex conjugate. Unit 522 then maps the first symbol pair {^a and Sb} onto the first output symbol stream and maps the second period pair {- s*b and s*a} onto the second output symbol stream. The second<br>
output symbol stream thus contains all of the data symbols sent in the first output symbol stream. However, the output symbols in the second stream are reordered and conjugated and/or negated, which allows a recipient terminal to optimally combine the received symbols. Unit 522 may perform STTD in other manners. Unit 522 may also perform space-time processing based on other space-time diversity schemes.<br>
[0050]	Unit 522 may map each data symbol stream to one or multiple output symbol<br>
streams. In an embodiment, which is assumed for the description below, the S output symbol streams from unit 522 are sent simultaneously from S virtual antennas, one output symbol stream from each virtual antenna. In another embodiment, multiple output symbol streams may be code division multiplexed and sent from one virtual antenna. In any case, each virtual antenna corresponds to a different spatial channel that is formed with the T transmit antennas at base station 110.<br>
[0051]	Each output symbol stream may be sent on one or more HS-PDSCHs, or more<br>
specifically, on 1 to 15 HS-PDSCHs for 3GPP Release 6. The segmentation of an output symbol stream to HS-PDSCHs, which is called physical channel segmentation, may be performed by various processing units within the transmit path. For example, the physical channel segmentation may be performed by unit 520, 522, 524,430, and so on. For clarity, the following description assumes that the physical channel segmentation is performed by unit 524.<br>
[0052]	Spreading and chip scrambling unit 524 receives the S output symbol streams<br>
from unit 522, performs spreading and chip scrambling (if applicable), and provides S streams of data chips. Unit 524 may process each output symbol stream as follows. Unit 524 first demultiplexes the output symbol stream into N output symbol substreams to be sent on N HS-PDSCHs, where 1

WO 2006/102252	PCT/US2006/010084<br>
13<br>
each output symbol substream with a channelization code assigned to the HS-PDSCH carrying that substream. Unit 524 performs spreading by repeating an output symbol multiple times to generate SF replicated symbols and then multiplying these SF replicated symbols with the SF chips of the assigned channelization code to generate SF chips, where SF = 16 for the HS-PDSCH. Unit 524 may scale the N chip streams for the N HS-PDSCHs with the same or different weights and then combine/add the scaled chip streams for all N HS-PDSCHs. Unit 524 may scramble the stream of combined chips with the scrambling code for the base station to generate a stream of data chips for the output symbol stream. The chip scrambling is performed by multiplying each combined chip with a respective chip of the scrambling code. Unit 524 may omit the chip scrambling and provide the stream of combined chips directly as the stream of data chips. Unit 524 may selectively perform chip scrambling, e.g., perform chip scrambling if space-time scrambling is not performed and omit chip scrambling if space-time scrambling is performed.<br>
[0053]	In general, any number of HS-PDSCHs (up to the number of available HS-<br>
PDSCHs) may be sent from each virtual antenna, and the symbols for these HS-PDSCHs may be spread with the assigned channelization codes, combined, and possibly chip scrambled to generate the data chip stream for that virtual antenna. The spreading and chip scrambling for each virtual antenna may be performed independently. The same or different numbers of HS-PDSCHs and the same or different HS-PDSCHs may be sent from the S virtual antennas. It may be advantageous to cycle through all of the available channelization codes for the HS-PDSCHs as few times as possible across the S virtual antennas, so that each channelization code is used for as few virtual antennas as possible. This helps to orthogonalize the S streams being sent simultaneously from the virtual antennas.<br>
[0054]	Data processor 510 may perform channel coding, modulation, space-time<br>
processing, spreading, and chip scrambling in other manners. For example, the symbol mapping may be performed in unit 524.<br>
[0055]	Data processor 512 processes control data for the HS-PDSCHs, which is sent on<br>
the HS-SCCHs. Data processor 512 may provide one data chip stream for each virtual antenna or one data chip stream for each data chip stream provided by data processor 510. Data processor 514 processes control data for each terminal, which is sent on the associated DPCH.   Data processor 516 processes overhead data for the radio access<br><br>

system, which is sent on the P-CCPCH. Data processor 516 also performs processing for the CPICH and other common channels. Data processors 512, 514 and 516 may perform processing for the HS-SCCHs, the associated DPCH, and the common channels (e.g., the P-CCPCH and CPICH), respectively, as specified by 3GPP. In general, the data for each physical channel may be sent from zero, one, multiple, or all S virtual antennas.<br>
[0056]	A combiner 530 receives the data chip streams from data processors 510, 512,<br>
514 and 516, combines the data chip streams for each virtual antenna, and provides S combined data chip streams for the S virtual antennas. The data processing and combining may also be performed in other manners.<br>
[0057]	Space-time scrambler 430a includes a space-time scrambling unit 538 that<br>
performs space-time scrambling for the S combined data chip streams and provides T output chip streams, one output chip stream for each antenna at the base station. The space-time scrambling may also be called spatial spreading, pseudo-random transmit steering, matrix pseudo-random steering, and so on. The space-time scrambling may be performed in various manners. In an embodiment, space-time scrambling is performed with matrix multiplication. For this embodiment, the S data chip streams are multiplied with different matrices and mapped to the T physical antennas. In another embodiment, space-time scrambling is performed based on a space-time code. The space-time code receives a block of data chips from the S streams, maps the data chips to physical antennas based on a linear or non-linear mapping scheme, and provides output chips for the T physical antennas.<br>
[0058]	For the embodiment shown in FIG. 5A, the data chip streams from the data<br>
processors for different physical channels are combined by combiner 530 and then space-time scrambled by unit 538. For this embodiment, space-time scrambling is performed for the physical channels that are combined by combiner 530.<br>

Space-time scrambler 430b includes space-time scrambling units 540, 542, 544 and 546 that perform space-time scrambling for the data chip streams from data processors 510, 512, 514 and 516, respectively.  A combiner 550 combines<br><br>

the output streams from all space-time scrambling units 540, 542, 544 and 546 and provides T output chip streams for the T physical antennas. For the embodiment shown in FIG. 5B, space-time scrambling may be selectively applied on each type of physical channel and on each physical channel of a given channel type by controlling the operation of the space-time scrambling unit for that channel type.<br>
[0060]	The space-time scrambling may also be performed in other manners.    For<br>
example, the physical channels to be space-time scrambled may be combined first, then space-time scrambled, and then combined with physical channels that are not space-time scrambled. As another example, the space-time scrambling may be incorporated within TX data processor 420, e.g., performed before or after the spreading.<br>
[0061]	FIG. 6 shows an embodiment of a space-time scrambling unit 600, which<br>
performs space-time scrambling using matrix multiplication. Space-time scrambling unit 600 may be used for space-time scrambling unit 538 in FIG. 5A and for each of space-time scrambling units 540, 542, 544 and 546 in FIG. 5B. Space-time scrambling unit 600 receives the S (combined or uncombined) data chip streams from TX data processor 420 and processes and maps these data chip streams to the T physical antennas.<br>
[0062]	Within space-time scrambling unit 600, a matrix multiplier 610 receives S data<br>
chips from the S streams in each chip period, multiplies these S data chips with a matrix, and provides T output chips for that chip period. Matrix multiplier 610 may perform space-time scrambling for each chip period n, as follows:<br>
x(n) = V(n)-s(n) ,	Eq(l)<br>
where  s(n) is a T x 1 vector containing S data chips for chip period n and T - S zeros, U(n) is a T x T matrix used for space-time scrambling in chip period n, and x(n) is a T xl vector containing T output chips for chip period n.<br>
[0063]	Each data chip stream may be mapped to one entry of vector s(/i), and the<br>
remaining entries of s(n) may be filled with zeros. Each entry of s(«) is multiplied with a respective column of matrix U(«) to obtain a vector, and the S vectors obtained based on the S non-zero entries of s(n) are added to obtain vector x(n). Only S columns of U(/i) are used, and the other T-S columns of U(?i) are multiplied with<br><br>

16<br>
zeros and thus effectively not used. U(n) may be set equal to the identity matrix I, or U(/z) = I, to disable space-time scrambling.<br>
[0064]	A given matrix U(n) may be used for one chip period, multiple chip periods,<br>
one symbol period, multiple symbol periods, one slot, and so on. The chip scrambling by unit 524 in FIGS. 5A and 5B may be disabled if the matrix is updated at the chip rate and different matrices are used for different chip periods. Space-time spreading and scrambling is achieved if multiple matrices are used for each symbol period, so that each data symbol is spread and scrambled over both space and time. In this case, the spreading by unit 524 in FIGS. 5A and 5B and the space-time scrambling by matrix multiplier 610 in FIG. 6 may be implemented with a joint space-time spreading and scrambling unit.<br>
[0065]	In an embodiment, the matrices used for space-time scrambling are generated as<br>
needed. In another embodiment, which is shown in FIG. 6, a set of matrices is pre-computed and stored in a matrix look-up table (LUT) 612. A matrix selector 614 then selects a specific matrix to use for space-time scrambling in each chip period from among the available matrices. The matrix selection may be performed in various manners, as described below.<br>
[0066]	Various types of matrices may be used for the space-time scrambling.   In an<br>
embodiment, unitary matrices are used for space-time scrambling. A unitary matrix U<br>
is characterized by the property VH -U = I, where " H " denotes a conjugate transpose.<br>
The columns of a unitary matrix are orthogonal to one another, and each column has<br>
unit power. The use of unitary matrices may simplify space-time descrambling by the<br>
terminals. In another embodiment, matrices that are not unitary or orthogonal are used<br>
for space-time scrambling.<br>
[0067]	The matrices used for space-time scrambling may be generated in various<br>
manners. In an embodiment, the matrices are generated based on a unitary base matrix and a set of scalars. The rows of the base matrix may be multiplied with different combinations of scalars to obtain different matrices for space-time scrambling.   Each<br>
scalar may be a real or complex value, e.g., +1, -1, +j, -j, and so on, where j = V-T. The scalars may be selected to have unit magnitude so that the matrices generated with these scalars are unitary matrices.   The base matrix may be a Walsh matrix or a<br><br>

17<br>
Hadamard matrix. A 2x2 Walsh matrix W2x2 and a larger size Walsh matrix W2Nx2N may be given as:<br><br><br><br><br>
Walsh matrices have dimensions that are powers of two, e.g., 2,4, 8, and so on.<br>
[0068]	The base matrix may also be a Fourier matrix. For a T x T Fourier matrix FT)a.,<br>
the element in the n-th row and m-th column of F^, fnm, may be expressed as:<br><br><br><br><br>
for n = l,...,T and m = l,...,T.<br><br>
Eq(3)<br><br>
Fourier matrices of any square dimension (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on) may be formed. Other matrices may also be used as the base matrix.<br>
[0069]	The matrices used for space-time scrambling may also be generated in other<br>
manners. For example, the matrices may be defined based on the scrambling code for the base station. As another example, the matrices may be generated based on a search for matrices that can provide good performance.<br>
[0070]	In an embodiment, the space-time scrambling is performed in a deterministic<br>
manner without requiring either feedback from the recipient terminals or knowledge of the wireless channels for these terminals. For example, a predetermined sequence of matrices may be used for the matrix multiplication. This matrix sequence is known to both the base station and the recipient terminals.<br>
[0071]	The sequence of matrices used for space-time scrambling may be formed based<br>
on the set of matrices available for space-time scrambling. In an embodiment, the matrices in the set are selected in a sequential order, and each selected matrix is used for space-time scrambling for a predetermined time interval. This time interval is also called the scrambling interval. In an embodiment, neighboring base stations start with the same matrix at a reference time (e.g., at the start of each frame), and these base stations use the same sequence of matrices for space-time scrambling. In another embodiment, neighboring base stations start with different matrices at the reference time, and these base stations use different sequences of matrices for space-time scrambling.    In yet another embodiment, neighboring base stations use different<br><br>
WO 2006/102252                                                      18	PCT/US2006/010084<br>
sequences of matrices but start with same matrix. For example, one base station may use a matrix sequence of {A, B, D, C, ...} and another base station may use a matrix sequence of {A, C, B, D, ...}, where A, B, C and D are different matrices. The use of different sequences of matrices may randomize intra-cell interference, which is the interference observed by the terminals in a given cell from the base stations for the neighbor cells.<br>
[0072]	In another embodiment, the matrices in the set are selected in a pseudo-random<br>
manner (e.g., based on the scrambling code for the base station), and each selected matrix is used for space-time scrambling for a predetermined time interval. For example, the set may contain 2L matrices that are assigned indices of 0 through 2L -1, where L may be equal to 1, 2, 3, 4, or some other integer. L bits of the scrambling code may then be used to select one of the 2L matrices in the set. At the start of each scrambling interval, the L most significant bits (MSBs), the L least significant bits (LSBs), or some other L bits of the scrambling code may be used as an L-bit index to look-up table 612. Table 612 would then provide the matrix with this L-bit index. This embodiment provides several advantages. First, since the terminals are synchronized to the scrambling code of the serving base station, this embodiment provides a simple method to determine the matrices used by the base station for space-time scrambling. Second, neighboring base stations are assigned different scrambling codes and hence use different sequences of matrices that are uncorrelated, which may randomize inter-cell interference. Third, a terminal can ascertain the matrices used by its serving base station as well as the matrices used by the neighbor base stations for which the terminal has timing information. The identity and timing of each base station may be ascertained by demodulating the common pilot transmitted by that base station on the CPICH.<br>
[0073]	In general, neighboring base stations may use the same or different sequences of<br>
matrices for space-time scrambling. For example, neighboring base stations may use a common sequence of matrices for broadcast and other common channels and may use different sequences of matrices for other physical channels (e.g., for HSDPA). The same or different sequences may also be used for different channel conditions. For example, neighboring base stations may use the same sequence of matrices when transmitting to terminals with high Doppler and may use different sequences of matrices when transmitting to terminals with low Doppler.<br><br>
WO 2006/102252	PCT/US2006/010084<br>
19<br>
[0074]	In  general,  a terminal  may determine the  matrices  used for space-time<br>
scrambling by a given base station based on (1) information that is continually transmitted by the base station (e.g., the scrambling code), (2) signaling sent by the base station, (3) broadcast information sent by the base stations in the cellular system, and/or (4) information available at the terminal. The terminal may perform advance receiver processing based on knowledge of the matrices used by the serving and neighbor base stations in order to suppress or possibly cancel inter-cell interference. The terminal may also use this knowledge in order to combine transmissions sent by multiple base stations with space-time scrambling.<br>
[0075]	The update rate for the matrices is related to the scrambling interval and may be<br>
flexibly selected. In an embodiment, the update rate is once per chip, and a different matrix is selected for each chip period. For this embodiment, the chip scrambling may be omitted. In another embodiment, the update rate is once per data symbol, and a different matrix is selected for each symbol period, which is 16 chips for the HS-PDSCHs. In yet another embodiment, the update rate is once per multiple (Q) data symbols, and a different matrix is selected for each Q-symbol interval. In yet another embodiment, the update rate is once per slot, and a different matrix is selected for each slot. In general, the update rate may be selected such that multiple matrixes are used for a code block, which is sent in one TTI for the HS-PDSCHs. Space-time scrambling provides diversity for a multi-antenna transmission to the recipient terminals and further randomizes this transmission so that other terminals do not suffer reduced measurement reliability due to the interference from this transmission. Hence, the scrambling matrix should be updated several times per code block length (in order to provide diversity) and several times per measurement interval (in order to reduce the degradation in measurement reliability).<br>
[0076]	The matrices may be selected for use in a periodic manner.   A sequence of<br>
matrices selected for use is called a cycle. A sequence may include different matrices or may include multiple instances of a given matrix. The smallest periodicity by which the matrices are selected is called a cycle period or cycle length. In an embodiment, the cycle period is equal to one frame. This embodiment facilitates the selection of matrices based on the scrambling code, which restarts at the beginning of each frame. In another embodiment, the cycle period is less than a frame. For example, the cycle period may be equal to a TTI, a slot, or some other duration.  This embodiment may<br><br>
WO 2006/102252	PCT/US2006/010084<br>
20<br>
reduce the number of matrices needed for space-time scrambling. In yet another embodiment, the cycle length is more than a frame.<br>
[0077]	Space-time scrambling may be selectively applied across time, code, and so on.<br>
In an embodiment, space-time scrambling is selectively applied for each TTI. Signaling (e.g., a bit) may be sent for each TTI to indicate whether or not space-time scrambling is performed in that TTI. In another embodiment, space-time scrambling is applied for only certain pre-defined TTIs of a frame. For example, space-time scrambling may be (1) performed for TTIs in which the recipient terminals are able to perform space-time descrambling and (2) omitted for TTIs in which the recipient terminals that are unable to perform space-time descrambling are served. The base station may send signaling to indicate which TTIs have space-time scrambling applied.<br>
[0078]	In yet another embodiment, space-time scrambling is applied on only certain<br>
physical channels. For example, space-time scrambling may be applied on the HS-PDSCHs and not applied on other physical channels. Table 2 lists some scenarios for applying space-time scrambling and the matrix update rate for each scenario. If space-time scrambling is applied on all physical channels for HSDPA, which are the HS-PDSCHs, HS-DSCHs, associated DPCH, and common channels, then the matrices may be updated at any rate, e.g., once per chip or less frequently. If space-time scrambling is applied on only some physical channels for HSDPA (e.g., the HS-PDSCHs, HS-DSCHs, and/or associated DPCH), then the matrices may be updated at a rate of once per shortest symbol period for these physical channels or less frequently. The shortest symbol period is determined by the shortest spreading factor for all physical channels applied with space-time scrambling. If space-time scrambling is applied on only some physical channels, then the update rate may be set to one or multiple times the smallest spreading factor in order to preserve orthogonality among these physical channels.<br>

[0079]	In general, space-time scrambling may be selectively applied on physical<br>
channels and/or selectively applied across time. Space-time scrambling may be selectively applied for compatibility reasons, so that the performance of terminals that do not support space-time scrambling is not degraded. Space-time scrambling may be selectively applied based on a predetermined scheme, based on feedback information from the terminals, and so on.<br>
[0080]	In an embodiment, each base station is associated with one sequence of matrices.<br>
This matrix sequence may be used for space-time scrambling for any and all physical channels.<br>
[0081]	In another embodiment, each base station is associated with multiple sequences<br>
of matrices, which may be generated and used in various manners. In an embodiment, each matrix sequence is generated by cycling through the set of matrices in a different order. In another embodiment, each matrix sequence is generated with a different set of matrices or a different subset of one set of matrices. Different matrix sequences may be used for different slots of a given TTI, different TTIs of a given frame, different frames, and so on. Different matrix sequences may also be used for different physical channels or different types of physical channels.<br>
[0082]	In yet another embodiment, each base station is associated with different matrix<br>
sequences that can provide different performance for different channel conditions. A matrix sequence may be selected for use based on feedback from the terminals. For example, the terminals may measure received signal qualities for different matrix sequences and may send back the matrix sequence with the best received signal quality. As another example, the base station may cycle through the different matrix sequences and select the matrix sequence with the most favorable feedback, e.g., the fastest acknowledgments (ACKs) from the terminals for correctly decoded packets. The terminals may be informed of the matrix sequence used for space-time scrambling.<br>
[0083]	Space-time scrambling randomizes the transmission of the D data symbol<br>
streams and results in stable and similar transmission performance for these data symbol streams. The stable and similar performance may allow for a reduction in the feedback from the terminals. A terminal receiving HSDPA typically measures the received signal quality based on the CPICH, determines a channel quality indicator (CQI) based on the received signal quality measurement, and sends the CQI back to the serving base station. The base station may select an appropriate coding and modulation scheme for<br><br>
WO 2006/102252	PCT/US2006/010084<br>
22<br>
the terminal based on the reported CQI. With space-time scrambling, the terminal may send the CQI at a lower rate, e.g., only once every several TTIs, once per frame, and so on.<br>
[0084]	For the embodiments described above, space-time scrambling is performed<br>
using matrix multiplication. Space-time scrambling may also be performed using a space-time code or a set of space-time codes. Each space-time code may map a block of data chips to the T transmit antennas based on a specific mapping scheme. The mapping for each space-time code may be such that (1) each block of K data chips is sent in a K-chip interval, where K &gt; 1, (2) all or as many of the K data chips are sent from the T transmit antennas in each chip period, and/or (3) each data chip is sent from all or as many of the T transmit antennas over the K-chip interval. Different mappings may be used for different space-time codes.<br>
[0085]	FIG. 7 shows a process 700 performed by a transmitter (e.g., a base station) to<br>
transmit data with space-time scrambling. At least one stream of data symbols is generated, e.g., by encoding, interleaving^ and symbol mapping blocks of data (block 712). The data symbol stream(s) may be mapped to one or more physical channels and spread with channelization codes assigned to the physical channels.<br>
[0086]	Space-time scrambling is performed on the at least one stream of data symbols<br>
to generate at least two streams of output chips (block 720). The space-time scrambling may be achieved by performing matrix multiplication with a sequence of matrices (as shown in FIG. 7) or by using space-time codes (not shown in FIG. 7). For space-time scrambling with matrix multiplication, a matrix is selected for each time interval in which space-time scrambling is performed, e.g., based on the scrambling code for the base station (block 722). Data to be sent in each time interval is then multiplied with the matrix selected for that time interval (block 724).

[0087]	A terminal performs the complementary space-time descrambling to recover a<br>
multi-antenna transmission sent with space-time scrambling. Each base station transmits a Primary Synchronization Channel (SCH) and a Secondary SCH that are not scrambled and may be used for initial acquisition. The terminal may perform acquisition for a base station based on the SCHs transmitted by that base station. The<br><br>

terminal may obtain the timing of the base station and determine the sequence of matrices used by the base station for space-time scrambling. The terminal may perform space-time descrambling based on the sequence of matrices in order to invert the physical channels that have been space-time scrambled.  For each scrambling interval,<br>
the terminal may perform matrix multiplication with an inverted matrix U"1, which is<br>
equal to UH if U is a unitary matrix. The terminal is able to perform space-time descrambling even if the space-time scrambling changes at a fast rate (e.g., every chip or every symbol). Alternatively, the terminal may perform space-time equalization, which is a combination of equalization and space-time descrambling that are performed jointly.<br>
[0088]	FIG. 8 shows a process 800 performed by a receiver (e.g., a terminal) to receive<br>
data sent with space-time scrambling. At least one stream of input samples is received for at least one receive antenna (block 812). Space-time descrambling is then performed on the at least one input sample stream to obtain at least one stream of descrambled samples (block 820). The space-time descrambling may be achieved by performing matrix multiplication with a sequence of matrices (as shown in FIG. 8) or by performing space-time decoding (not shown in FIG. 8). For each time interval in which space-time scrambling is performed, a matrix used for space-time scrambling in that time interval is determined, e.g., based on the scrambling code for the base station (block 822). Data received in each time interval is multiplied with an inverted matrix for that time interval (block 824). The at least one descrambled sample stream is further processed (e.g., despread, demodulated, deinterleaved, and decoded) to obtain at least one decoded data stream for the terminal (block 826).<br>

ABSTRACT <br>
“SPACE-TIME SCRAMBLING FOR CELLULAR SYSTEMS"<br>
Techniques for transmitting data with space-time scrambling in cellular systems (e.g., CDMA systems) are described. At least one stream of data symbols is generated, mapped to one or more physical channels, and spread with channelization codes for the physical channels. Space-time scrambling is performed on the at least one stream of data symbols to generate at least two streams of output chips. The space-time scrambling may be achieved by performing matrix multiplication with a sequence of matrices. For each time interval in which space-time scrambling is performed, a matrix may be selected (e.g., based on a scrambling code for a base station), and data to be sent in the time interval is multiplied with the selected matrix. The matrices used for space-time scrambling may be defined and selected in various manners. The streams of output chips are processed and transmitted from respective transmit antennas.<br></td>
