				<td>METHOD FOR PREPARING PHOTOREACTIVE POLYMERS AND<br>
IMMOBILIZATION OF BIOMOLECULES ONTO THESE POLYMERS<br>
Field of the invention<br>
This invention relates to a quick method for preparation of photoreactive<br>
polymers and immobilization of biomolecules onto these polymers. Photoreactive<br>
polymers are polymers, which become highly reactive when, exposed to light of<br>
specific wavelength and co-valently bind with the biomolecules. This method of<br>
immobilization is mild, simple and independent of pH and temperature. Advantage of<br>
the invention is that photo-immobilization technique can be easily manipulated and<br>
controlled.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Demand for immobilization of biomolecules onto organic or inorganic<br>
polymer has increased dramatically in recent years, particularly in the post genome<br>
era. Immobilized biomolecules have versatile applications in clinical laboratories,<br>
biosensors, membrane bioreactors. diagnostics, genomics. proteomics, drug screening,<br>
affinity chromatography and many other related fields. There are different approaches<br>
to immobilize a biomolecule onto an inert surface such as (i) to activate the polymer<br>
surface, (ii) to activate the biomolecule or (iii) activate both prior to immobilization.<br>
From the practical point of view, approach (i) is a better choice as in most of the cases<br>
the biomolecules are precious and sensitive towards chemicals and during activation<br>
some of them may be lost.<br>
Biomolecules immobilized on the polymer surfaces are widely used in<br>
diagnostics, biosensors, membrane bioreactors, genomics, proteomics, drug screening,<br>
affinity chromatography and many other related fields [Krysteva, et. al., Covalent<br>
binding of enzymes to synthetic membrane containing acrylamide units, using<br>
formaldehyde, Biotechnol Appl. Biochem. 13: 106-111 (1991); Pandey, et.al.,<br>
Amperometric enzyme sensor for glucose based on graphite paste-modified<br>
electrodes. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 33:139-144 (1992)].<br>
Demand for simple and rapid method of immobilization of biomolecules onto<br>
polymer surfaces continues to grow in the post genome era.<br>
.here are various methods available for immobilization of biomolecui^ onto<br>
the polymer surfaces. Covalent immobilization may results in better biomolecule<br>
activity, reduced nonspecific adsorption, and greater stability [Tiller, J. et. al.. A novel<br>
efficient enzyme-immobilization reaction on NHi polymers by means of L- ascorbic<br>
acid. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 30. 155-162 (1992)]<br>
There are number of ways for the covalent immobilization of biomolecules<br>
onto different polymer supports. Glucose oxidase, uricase. xanthine oxidase and<br>
penicillin acylase were immobilized on alkylamine glass or silica gel through<br>
glutaraldehyde coupling method [Guo, et. al., Immobilization of glucose oxidase and<br>
peroxidase and their application in flow injection analysis for glucose in serum, Appl.<br>
Biochem. Biotechnol. 23(1): 15-24 (1990); Nakamura, et. al.. Immobilization of<br>
uricase on protamine bound to glass beads and its application to determination of uric<br>
acid. Anal. Biochem. 152(2): 386-390 (1986); Tawa. et. al.. Immobilization of<br>
xanthine oxidase to controlled pore-glass. Application to high- performance liquid<br>
chromatography. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 12: 107-110 (1983)]. Glucose oxidase,<br>
cholesterol oxidase and uricase immobilized on controlled pore glass were applied for<br>
determining glucose, cholesterol and urea respectively in serum.<br>
Thionyl chloride-activated succinamidopropyl-controlled-pore glass was used<br>
to covalently immobilize rabbit anti- bovine IgG. [Stabel, et. al., Anti-IgG<br>
immobilized controlled pore glass. Thionyl chloride-activated succinamidopropyl<br>
glass as a covalent immobilization matrix, Appl. Biotechnol. 36(2):87-96(1992)],<br>
Enzymes such as acetylcoenzyme<br>
A synthetase was immobilized on CNBr-activated controlled pore glass.<br>
Activation of inert organic polymer surface such as polystyrene, polypropylene or<br>
polyethylene has been reported to occur through radiation graft polymerization or<br>
gaseous plasma technique [de Queiroz, et. al., Surface studies of albumin immobilized<br>
onto PE and PVC films, J. Biomater. Sci. Polym. 8: 667-681(1997); Siephia, et. al.,<br>
Immobilization of enzymes on polypropylene bead surfaces by anhydrous ammonia<br>
gaseous plasma technique. J Biomed. Mater. Res. 22(5): 417-22 (1988)].<br>
However, all these methods suffer from one or more shortcomings such as (i)<br>
they are tedious (ii) they are time consuming, (iii) they require hazardous chemicals,<br>
or (iv) require harsh reaction conditions.<br>
The photolinker- mediated technique permits covalent binding of a<br>
Diomolecule to solid surface under gentle reaction condition. This method is usually<br>
based on a photolinker having atleast two functional groups, one of which is<br>
essentially a photoactivable group.<br>
There are different methods available for immobilization of biomolecule<br>
through a photolinker. Eisner, et. al. U.S. Pat. No. 5.427.799, describes a method for<br>
the activation of an inert surface by a two-ring heterocyclic photolinker such as<br>
psorlene by a photochemical reaction.<br>
Jacobsen. et. al.. U.S Pat. No. 6,033,784. discloses a method for<br>
photochemical activation of a polymer surface using quinone. Using primary amino<br>
containing quinone derivative, amino group is introduced onto polystyrene surface.<br>
However, these groups can not easily bind with the protein without addition of one or<br>
more activating reagent. Preparation of such plates and photolinker are also time<br>
consuming and cumbersome.<br>
Recently Nahar et. al. and Bora.et.al [Nahar. et. al.. Light-induced activation<br>
of an inert surface for covalent immobilization of a protein ligand. Anal. Biochem.<br>
294: 148-153 (2001); Nahar, P. US patent pending, Method for photochemical<br>
activation of polymer surface and immobilization of biomolecules onto activated<br>
surface; Bora, et.al.,<br>
Covaient immobilization of proteins onto photoactivated polystyrene<br>
microtiter plates for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay procedures, J. Immunol.<br>
Methods. 268: 171-177 (2002)] and later Naqvi et. al. [Naqvi, et. al., Introduction of<br>
functional groups onto polypropylene and polyethylene surfaces for immobilization of<br>
enzymes. Anal. Biochem. 306: 74-78 (2002)] published a simple, rapid and mild<br>
procedure for light- induced activation of inert polymers such as polystyrene,<br>
polypropylene and polyethylene using 1- fluoro 2- nitro -4- azido benzene.<br>
However, in most of these photolinker- mediated procedures, surfaces were<br>
activated by a photochemical reaction whereas biomolecules were immobilized by a<br>
thermochemical reaction. Hence, biomolecule must have one or more functional<br>
group (s) for reaction with the activated surface resulting covalent linkage. In contrast,<br>
in photochemical immobilization technique, biomolecule can be immobilized<br>
irrespective of their functional group. There are very few reports on photochemical<br>
immobilization of biomolecule.<br>
Sigrist, H. et al immobilized biomolecule on an inert surface by using a<br>
photolinker polymer made by reaction of BSA and 3-(triethylamine)-3-(misothiocyanophenyldiazirine).<br>
Photolinker polymer was then used to bind streptavidin<br>
as well as polystyrene surface simultaneously by exposing to light [Sigrist. et. al..<br>
Light dependent, Covalent immobilization of biomolecules on inert surface,<br>
Biotechnology 10: 1026-1028 (1992)]. However, preparation of this photolinker itself<br>
is a time consuming multistep procedure.<br>
Guire. U.S Pat. No. 3.959.078 disclosed a method where immobilization of<br>
enzyme was carried out using a photolinker. 1- fluoro 2- nitro —4- azido benzene. In<br>
this method, amino- bearing matrix was activated by 1- fluoro 2- nitro -4- azido<br>
benzene in a thermochemical reaction at 37°C for 20 hours. In the subsequent step<br>
enzyme was immobilized in 16 hours onto the activated surface by a photochemical<br>
reaction. Disadvantage of this method is its long reaction time in both the steps. None<br>
of the above method gives the simple and rapid preparation of a photoreactive surface<br>
and rapid immobilization of biomolecule onto this photoreactive surface.<br>
The following table gives the disadvantages of the prior art processes.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The present invention comprises a rapid and efficient method for modification<br>
of polymer surface for the introduction of latent reactive group onto it and<br>
immobilization of biomolecules onto said modified polymer surface by light energy.<br>
More specifically, polymer surface with latent photoreactive group is prepared rapidly<br>
by microwave-mediated reaction of 1- fluoro-2- nitro-4- azidobenzene with a<br>
polymer having a reactive nucleophilic group. The modified polymer (photoreactive<br>
polymer) thus prepared has photoreactive azido group, which under UV light<br>
generates highly reactive nitrene capable of binding with the biomolecule.<br>
Concentration of photolinker plays an important role in preparing<br>
photoreactive polymer. Best result was obtained when the ratio of the photolinker<br>
(FNAB) and polymer is 1:1 (w/'w). Further increase in FNAB did not increase the<br>
photoreactive group in a polymer. The efficacy of the photoreactive surface was<br>
determined by immobilizing HRP onto it and subsequently assaying the immobilized<br>
enzyme. When untreated surface (FNAB: 0 me) was used, there was practically no<br>
immobilization of biomolecule onto it. (fig 1, fig 2 and fig 3).<br>
Microwaves were found an excellent tool for making photoreactive surface.<br>
Thus, photoreactive LCAA-CPG prepared in 70 microwave irradiation was found to<br>
give better results than the photoreactive surface obtained by prior art i.e 37°C for 20<br>
hours (table 1).<br>
Microwave radiation for 60 seconds was also found to give photoreactive<br>
aminosilica with good results (fig 4). For aminopolystyrene also 60 seconds<br>
microwave irradiation was sufficient for the reaction of the polymer and FNAB to<br>
produce photoreactive amino polystyrene. (Fig 5). In contrast to amino polymer,<br>
hydroxyl group bearing polymer needed a basic catalyst for the reaction with FNAB.<br>
Optimization of amount of KOH (catalyst) was carried out by performing the reaction<br>
of PVA and FNAB by stirring at room temperature for one hour in presence of<br>
toluene and different amount of KOH in aqueous solution. 6.5 ul of 30 % KOH was<br>
found as optimum for the reaction of PVA and FNAB (50 mg each) in presence of 5<br>
ml toluene, (fig 6). The applicants also optimized the time required for making<br>
photoreactive PVA using KOH at room temperature. The optimum time was 60<br>
minutes, (fig 7). However, comparable results were obtained by microwave<br>
irradiation in 10 minutes.<br>
In photoactivation procedure PVA was activated by exposing FNAB coated<br>
PVA to UV light. The photoactivated PVA was then used to immobilize horse radish<br>
peroxidase at 37°C for 1 hour. In the invented procedure, photoreactive PVA was<br>
prepared by the reaction of PVA and FNAB by microwave irradiation (or by thermal<br>
incubation at 37°C). Horse radish peroxidase immobilization on this photoreactive<br>
PVA was then carried out by exposing them to UV light. Results in table 2 showed<br>
that photoreactive polymer (surface activated thermally) gave better immobilization<br>
of biomolecule than thermoreactive (surface activated by light) surface. Hence,<br>
photochemical immobilization procedure (thermochemical activation and<br>
photochemical immobilization) as described in this invented procedure is better<br>
option than thermochemical immobilization (photochemical activation and<br>
thermochemical immobilization) procedure.<br>
The applicants have optimized the concentration of linker (FNAB) and time of<br>
incubation with polymer (PVA) for the preparation of photoreactive polymer. In the<br>
second step, enzyme (HRP) was immobilized onto the polymer by its photoreactive<br>
group by light energy. Thus, immobilization of enzyme onto the alkylamino silica gel<br>
was carried out by UV light in a UV stratalinker in different time. The optimum time<br>
for photoimmobilization of enzyme on photoreactive alkylamino silica gel was found<br>
as 10 minutes. However, increase in UV irradiation time beyond 10 minutes did not<br>
increase immobilization (fig 8). Immobilization of HRP onto photoreactive LCAACPG<br>
was found optimum in 20 minutes (fig 9). However, photoreactive PVA requires<br>
60 minutes of UV irrradiation for optimum immobilization of HRP. Further increase<br>
in UV irradiation time decreases the absorbance, which may be due to the<br>
deactivation of some immobilized enzymes, (fig 10). Enzyme concentration is also an<br>
important factor for immobilization. 2 ug HRP/ 50 mg photoreactive PVA was found<br>
optimum for the immobilization on PVA ar "ther increase did not appreciable<br>
increase its immobilization (fig 11). However, ; ainum amount of HRP was 4 ug/ 50<br>
mg support for immobilization on photoreactive LCAA-CPG (fig 12) and alkylamino<br>
silica gel (fig 13). Total active enzyme immobilized on 20 mg LCAA-CPG and 20<br>
mg alkylamino silica gel was found 160 U and 120 U respectively.<br>
Thus, in the present invention, this method of preparation of photoreactive<br>
support is simple, rapid and overcomes drawbacks of the reported methods. Also, the<br>
immobilization of biomolecules onto the photoreactive surfaces are simple and fast.<br>
The advantages of the process of the invention are given in the Table below:<br>
