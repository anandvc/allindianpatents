DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The term "optically single compound" as used herein means that it is comprised of any one of a plurality of optical isomers when they are present, and it includes not only a compound completely free from other optical isomers but also a compound having a chemically pure degree.  In other words, it may contain other optical isomers, provided that they do not exert influences upon its physical constants and physiological activity.<br>
Firstly, the compound of the present invention represented by formula (I):<br>
  (I)<br>

having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a halogen atom and a nitro group), a hydrogen atom, or an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms.<br>
When the substituent group R^ is a substituent group represented by formula:<br>
  t<br>
it may be any group which is not changed by the reaction to convert the cyano group of the compound of formula (I) into aminomethyl group, but preferably a group in which R^, R' and R" are different from one another.  Illustrative examples of such a case include (R)- and (S)-l-phenylethyl, (R)- and (S)-1-phenylpropyl, (R)- and (S)-l-phenyl-2-(p-tolyl)ethyl, (R)-and (S)-l-(l-naphthyl)ethyl and the like groups.<br>

Of these protecting groups, aralkyl groups are preferred in view of simple and easy production.  Of these aralkyl groups, benzyl group is preferred.  The phenyl group of the benzyl group may have another substituent groups.  For example, it may have at least one substituent group selected from the group consisting of an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, an alkoxyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a halogen atom and a nitro group.  Illustrative examples of such groups other than benzyl group include 4-methoxybenzyl,<br><br>
4-chlorobenzyl, 4-nitrobenzyl, 2,4-dichlorobenzyl, 2,4-dinitrobenzyl, 3,5-dichlorobenzyl, 3,5-dinitrobenzyl and the like groups.<br>
The substituent group R^ represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, but the "alkyl group" may be a straight- or branched chain alkyl group. Further, the substituent group R^ is not always limited to such an alkyl group, provided that it functions as a elimination group.<br>
Next, the compound of the present invention represented by formula (II):<br>
  (II)<br>
is described.  In this formula, n is an integer of 2 to 5, and the substituent group R^ is hydrogen atom or a substituent group represented by formula;<br><br>
wherein R*, R^ and R'^ each represents a phenyl, phenylmethyl or naphthyl group (which may be substituted with at least one substituent group selected from the group consisting of an<br><br>
alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, an alkoxyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a halogen atom and a nitro group), a hydrogen atom, or an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms.<br>
As the substituent group of the following formula,<br><br>
the same substituent groups described in relation to the compound of formula (I) may be used.  Further, the substitutent group R^ may be an amino group-protecting group as in the compound of formula (I):<br>
Next, the compound of the present invention represented by formula (III):<br>
  (III)<br>
is described.  In this formula, n is an integer of 2 to 5, and the substituent group R" is a substituent group represented by formula:<br><br><br>
wherein R*, R' and R"^ each represents a phenyl, phenylmethyl or naphthyl group (which may be substituted with at least one substituent group selected from the group consisting of an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, an alkoxyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a halogen atom and a nitro group), a hydrogen atom, or an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, with the proviso that R^, R*' and R" are different from one another.<br>
Illustrative examples of the substituent group represented by formula:<br><br>
include (R)- and (S)-l-phenylethyl, (R)- and (S)-l-phenylpropyl, (R)- and (S)-l-phenyl-2-(p-tolyl)ethyl, (R)-and (S)-l-(1-naphthyl)ethyl and the like groups.<br>
Of these groups, (R)- or (S)-l-phenylethyl group is preferred in view of simple and easy production, and its phenyl group may have another substituent groups.  For example, it may have at least one substituent group selected<br><br>

Illustrative examples of such groups include (R)- and (S)-l-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethyl, (R)- and (S)-l-(4-chlorophenyl)ethyl, (R)- and (S)-l-(4-nitrophenyl)ethyl, (R)- and (S)-l-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl, (R)- and (S)-l-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)ethyl, (R)- and (S)-l-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)ethyl, (R)- and (S)-l-(3,5-dinitrophenyl)ethyl and the like groups.<br>
Next, production process of the compounds of the present invention, firstly the compound represented by formula (I),<br>
  (I)<br>
is described.<br>
According to the present invention, a compound represented by the following formula (IV-2) is used for the synthesis of one of the compound of formula (I) in which n is 2, and this starting compound can be synthesized by a known method.  For example, it can be obtained from 1-cyano-cyclopropanecarbonic acid ester in accordance with the following reaction scheme when the method of Meyers et al. (J.   Org.   Chem. ,   1973, 22^,   36) is employed.<br><br><br>
(IV-2) Production of the compound of formula (I) from the compound of formula (IV) can be effected by allowing the compound of formula (IV) to react with hydrogen cyanide in the presence of a compound represented by the following formula (V) or a salt thereof:<br>
NHzR^	(V)<br>
wherein R^ represents a hydrogen atom or a substituent group represented by formula:<br><br>
wherein R^, R*' and R'^ each represents a phenyl, phenylmethyl or naphthyl group (which may be substituted with at least one substituent group selected from the group consisting of an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, an alkoxyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a halogen atom and a nitro group), a hydrogen atom, or an alkyl group having 1 to 4<br><br>
carbon atoms, with the proviso that R^, R' and R° are not hydrogen atoms at the same time.<br>
Examples of the salt of this case include acid addition salts such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, nitrate and the like inorganic acid salts.<br>
Each of R*, R' and R*^ is a phenyl, phenylmethyl or naphthyl group (which may be substituted with at least one substituent group selected from the group consisting of an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, an alkoxyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a halogen atom and a nitro group), a hydrogen atom, or an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and R*, R^ and R"  may preferably be different from one another.  That is, a compound having asymmetric carbon is preferred as the compound of formula (V).  More preferred is a case of either of the two optical isomers, namely optically single compound.<br>
Illustrative examples of the compound of formula (V) include (R)- and (S)-l-phenylethylamine, (R)- and (S)-l-phenylpropylamine, (R)- and (S)-l-phenyl-2-(p-tolyl)ethylamine, (R)- and (S)-l-(l-naphthyl)ethylamine, (R)-and (S)-l-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethylamine, (R)- and (S)-l-(4-chlorophenyl)ethylamine, (R)- and (S)-l-(4-nitrophenyl)ethylamine, (R)- and (S)-l-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethylamine, (R)- and (S)-l-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)ethylamine, (R)- and (S)-l-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)ethylamine, (R)- and (S)-l-(3,5-<br><br>
dinitrophenyl)ethylainine and the like.<br>
Hydrogen cyanide to be used in this reaction may be generated outside the reaction system and introduced into the system or directly generated in the reaction system.  Its generation in the reaction system may be effected by employing a salt exchange reaction of potassium cyanide, sodium cyanide, lithium cyanide and the like alkali cyanides with various acidic substances, typically hydrochloric acid, in water.  Alternatively, it may be generated by adding sodiiim hydrogen sulfite or the like reducing agent to the just described alkali cyanides.  In this connection, trimethylsilyl cyanide or the like organic cyanide or diethylal\imin\am cyanide or the like organic metal cyanide may be used in stead of hydrogen cyanide.<br>
Any solvent can be used in this reaction, provided that it is inert to the reaction, preferably water or a solvent which is miscible with water.  Examples of the water-miscible solvent include alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol and the like, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane and the like, ketones such as acetone and the like and nitrogen-containing solvents such as acetonitrile and the like.  As occasion demands, these solvents may be used as water-containing solvents.<br>
This reaction is carried out at a temperature of approximately from -20 to 100°C, preferably from 50°C to the boiling point of solvent used.<br><br>
When this reaction is carried out with an optically single amine, the product becomes a mixture of two diastereomers, but one of the diastereomers is formed preferentially than the other.  In other words, this reaction is characterized by the diastereo-selective reaction.  For example, when (S)-l-phenylethylamine is used as the amine, the product becomes a mixture of l-[(S)-l-cyano-[(S)-l-phenylethylamino]raethyl]-l-ethoxycarbonylcyclopropane and its diastereomer l-[(R)-l-cyano-[(S)-l-phenylethylamino]methyl]-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclopropane, with a formation ratio of 73:27.  In this connection, when (R)-l-phenylethylamine is used, the product becomes a mixture of l-[(S)-l-cyano-[(R)-l-phenylethylamino]methyl]-l-ethoxycarbonylcyclopropane and its diastereomer l-[(R)-l-cyano-[(R)-l-phenylethylamino]methyl]-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclopropane, and the formation ratio will become about 3:7.<br>
The thus obtained two diastereomers can be separated by usually used means, such as silica gel column chromatography, thin layer chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography and the like.<br>
Of the thus separated optical isomers, an isomer which is not necessary can be converted into a diastereomer mixture containing necessary isomer by treating it in a protic solvent to effect epimerization easily, i.e., converting the configuration of the carbon atom bonded to a cyano group.<br><br>
Such a treatment may be carried out with heating. Any ptotic solvent can be used, provided that it is inert to the compound, with its preferred examples including methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol and the like alcohols. Mixture solvents of these protic solvents with other solvents may also be used.  Examples of such other solvents include ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and the like, ketones such as acetone and the like, nitrogen-containing solvents such as acetonitrile and the like, aromatic hydrocarbon solvents such as toluene and the like and aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents such as hexane and the like.  That is, when the 1-[(R)-1-cyano-[(S)-1-phenylethylamino]methyl]-1-<br>
ethoxycarbonylcyclopropane obtained above is heated under reflux for 30 minutes in ethanol, it becomes a 73:27 mixture of l-[(S)-l-cyano-[(S)-l-phenylethylamino]methyl]-l-ethoxycarbonylcyclopropane and l-[(R)-l-cyano-[(S)-l-phenylethylamino]methyl]-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclopropane.  Thus, it is possible to introduce it easily into an optically active form having either one of the configurations.<br>
In this connection, a member of the compound of formula (I) in which the substituent group R^ is an alkoxycarbonyl group, an aralkyloxycarbonyl group or an aliphatic or aromatic acyl group can be obtained easily by converting it from a compound of formula (I) whose R^ is a hydrogen atom by means of usually used substitution reaction.<br>
Next, a process for the production of the compound of<br><br>
formula (II) from the compound of formula (I) is described.<br>
The compound of formula (II) can be produced by-reducing the cyano group of the compound of formula (I) and then effecting cyclization of the thus formed amino compound. The reduction and cyclization can be effected by reducing the starting compound in an atmosphere of hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst and then carrying out condensation cyclization continuously with heating.  Alternatively, the amino compound of the following formula obtained by the reduction reaction<br><br>
may be once isolated and then heated to effect cyclization. Any reaction can be used in this reaction, provided that it is inert to ester and R^ and can reduce the cyano group into aminomethyl group.  Examples of such a reaction include a catalytic hydrogeneration reaction which uses palladixim-carbon, Raney nickel and the like catalysts, of which a reaction in which Raney nickel is used is particularly preferred.<br>
Any solvent can be used in this reaction, provided that it is inert to the reaction.  Preferred examples of the solvent include methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol and the like alcohols and 1,4-dioxane and the like ethers.  These<br><br>
solvents may be used by dissolving ammonia therein.  As occasion demands, these solvents may be used by mixing with water.  The ammonia-containing solvent may be prepared by dissolving ammonia gas in a solvent or mixing it with aqueous ammonia.<br>
The catalytic hydrogenation reaction is carried out at a temperature of approximately from 0 to 40°C, preferably from 5 to room temperature.  The cyclization reaction is carried out at a temperature of approximately from 0 to 200°C, preferably from room temperature to 180°C.  The hydrogen gas pressure at the time of the catalytic hydrogenation may be within the range of from 1 to 100 atmospheric pressures, preferably from 20 to 70 atmospheric pressures.  When the catalytic hydrogenation reaction is carried out approximately at room temperature, it may sometimes be necessary to carry out the cyclization reaction by continuously heating the reaction system at from 50°C to 180°C.<br>
Next, a process for the production of the compound of formula (III-l) from the compound of formula (II) is described.<br>
The compound of formula (III-l) can be produced by reducing the compound of formula (II).  In general, the carbonyl moiety of the amide group is reduced by allowing a hydrogenation agent to react therewith.  Examples of the hydrogenation agent to be used in this reaction include<br><br>
aluminiim hydride compounds such as lithium aluminiom hydride, sodium aluminum bis(2-methoxyethoxy)hydride and the like and various boron compounds (diborane and the like for instance) which are used in the combination system of sodium borohydride with methanesulfonic acid, boron trifluoride and the like, of which lithium aluminum hydride and sodium aluminum bis(2-methoxyethoxy)hydride are particularly preferred.<br>
This reaction is generally carried out in the presence of a solvent which is not particularly limited with the proviso that it is inert to the reaction.  Examples of the solvent include diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and the like ethers and toluene and the like hydrocarbon solvents, of which tetrahydrofuran is preferred.<br>
This reaction may be carried out at a temperature of from 0°C to the boiling point of used solvent, preferably from room temperature to 100°C.<br>
Next, a process for the production of the compound of formula (VI) from the compound of formula (III-2) is described.<br>
The compound of formula (VI) can be produced by removing R^^ from the compound of formula (III-2) by its catalytic hydrogeneration or acid hydrolysis.<br>
For example, when a catalytic hydrogeneration is employed, palladium-carbon, palladium hydroxide, Raney nickel and the like may be used as the catalyst, of which palladium-<br><br>
carbon and palladium hydroxide are particularly preferred. Any solvent can be used in this reaction, provided that it is inert to the reaction.  Preferred examples of the solvent include methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol and the like alcohols and tetrahydrofuran and the like ethers.  These solvents may be used by adding water.  As occasion demands, these solvents may be used by adding acetic acid, hydrochloric acid or the like acid.<br>
This reaction is carried out at a temperature of from 0 to 100°C, preferably from 5 to 50°C.  The hydrogen gas pressure of this reaction may be within the range of from 1 to 100 atmospheric pressures, preferably from 1 to 50 atmospheric pressures.<br>
The aforementioned processes can be summarized as follows (for example, the case wherein R^ is an ethyl group).<br><br>
Optically active form (antipode) of the compound represented by formula (VI):<br><br><br>
can be produced in the following manner (for example, the case wherein R^ is ethyl group, R^ is a methyl group, R^  is a phenyl group and R" is a hydrogen atom).<br><br>
That is, the compound of formula (I) is produced by allowing the compound of formula (IV) to react with hydrogen cyanide in the presence of an optically single compound of the compound of formula (V) or a salt thereof.  The term "optically single compound of the compound of formula (V)"<br><br>
means either of two optical isomers when they exist in the compound of foirmula (V) in which R^, R' and R*^ are different from one another.<br>
When this reaction is carried out with an optically single amine as shown above, the compound of formula (I) is formed as a mixture of two diastereomers, but a diastereo-selective reaction progresses and one of the diastereomers is formed preferentially than the other.  The thus obtained two diastereomers can be separated by usually used means to obtain only the necessary optical isomer.  In this connection, one of the thus obtained optically active isomers, which is not necessary, can be converted easily into necessary isomer by effecting epimerization in a protic solvent, i.e., converting the configuration of the carbon atom bonded to a cyano group, so that it is possible to obtain only an optically active substance having either one of the configurations.<br>
Next, the compound of formula (II) is obtained as an optically single compound by reducing the cyano group of the thus obtained optically single compound of formula (I) and then effecting cyclization of the thus formed amino compound.<br>
Next, the compound of formula (III-l) is obtained as an optically single compound by reducing the thus obtained optically single compound of formula (II).<br>
Finally, the compound of formula (VI) is produced as an optically single compound by subjecting the optically<br><br>
single compound of formula (III-2) to catalytic hydrogeneration or acid hydrolysis to effect the deprotection.<br>
Alternatively, an optically active form (antipode) of the compound of formula (VI) can also be produced by forming diastereomer salts of a racemate of the compound represented by formula (VI) with an optically active acid such as tartaric acid and subsequently carrying out optical resolution.  Since the compound of formula (VI) is a dibasic compound, two diastereomer salts [compound (VI):tartaric acid = 1:1 and compound (VI):tartaric acid = 1:2] are obtained which can be produced selectively.  For example, (S)-form of the compound of formula (VI) can be produced by forming its 1:1 salt with D-tartaric acid, and isolating the salt by recrystallization to carry out' optical resolution.  Examples of the preferred solvent to be used in this case include methanol, ethanol and the like alcohol solvents which may be used alone or as a mixture solvent with water.<br>
The thus obtained compound of formula (VI) can be introduced into an excellent antibacterial agent in accordance with the method disclosed in JP-A-2-231475 and JP-A-3-95176.<br>
