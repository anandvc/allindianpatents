				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
 The present invention generally relates to a process for prow density detergent composition. More particularly, the invention is directed to a process during which low density detergent agglomerates are produced by feeding a liquid acid precursor of a surfactant and dry starting detergent material including a silica material and a neutralizing agent into a high speed mixer followed by a drying apparatus. The process produces a free flowing, low density detergent composition which can be commercially sold as a conventional non-compact detergent composition or used as an admix in a low dosage, "compact" detergent product.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  <br>
Recently, there has been considerable interest within the detergent industry<br>
for laundry detergents which are "compact" and therefore, have low dosage volumes. To facilitate production of these so-called low dosage detergents, many attempts have been made to produce high bulk density detergents, for example with a density of 600 g/1 or higher. The low dosage detergenta are currently in high demand as they conserve resources and can be sold in small packages which are more convenient for consumers. However, the extent to which modem detergent products need to be "compact" in nature remains unsettled. In fact, many consumers, especially in developing countries, continue to prefer a higher dosage levels in their respective laundering operations. Consequently, there is a need in the art of producing modem detergent compositions for flexibility in the ultimate density of the final composition.<br>
Generally, there are two primary types of processes by which detergent granules or powders can be prepared. The first type of process involves spray-drying an aqueous detergent slurry in a spray-drying tower to produce highly porous detergent granules. In the second type of process, the various detergent components are dry mixed after which they are agglomerated with a binder such as a nonionic or anionic surfactant. In both processes, the most important factors which govern the density of the resulting detergent granules are the density, shape, porosity and surface area of the various starting materials and their respective chemical composition. These parameters, however, can only be varied within a limited range. Thus, flexibility in the substantial bulk density can only be achieved by additional processing steps which lead to lower densities of the detergent granules.<br>
There have been many attempts in the art for providing processes which increase the density of detergent granules or powders. Particular attention has been given to densificationof spray-dried granules by post tower treatment. For example, one attempt involves attach process in which spray-dried or granulated detergent powders containing sodium tripolyphosphate and sodium sulfate are densified and spheronized in a Marumeriser. This apparatus comprises a substantially horizontal, roughened, rotatable table positioned within and at tie base of a substantially vertical, smooth walled cylinder. This process, however, is essentially a batch process and is therefore test suitable for the large scale production of detergent powders. More recently, other attempts have been made to provide a continuous processes for increasing the density of "post-tower" or spray dried detergent granules. Typically, such processes require a feat apparatus which pulverizes or grinds the granules and a second apparatus which increases the density of the pulverized granules by agglomeration. While these processes achieve the desired increase in density by treating or densifying "post tower" or spray dried granules, they do not provide a process which has the flexibility of providing lower density granules.<br>
Moreover, ail of the aforementioned processes are directed primarily for densifying or otherwise proceasing spray dried granules. Currently, the relative amounts and types of materials subjected to spray drying processes in die production of detergent granules has been limited. For example, it has been difficult to attain high levels of surfactant in the resulting detergent composition, a feature which facilitates production of detergents in a more efficient manner. Thus, it would be desirable to have a process by which detergent compositions can be produced without having the limitations imposed by conventional spray drying techniques.<br>
To that end, the art is also replete with disclosures of processes which entail agglomerating detergent compositions. For example, attempts have been made to agglomerate detergent builders by mixing zeolite and/or layered silicates in a mixer to form free flowing agglomerates. While such attempts suggest that their process can be used to produce detergent agglomerates, they do not provide a mechtnigm by which a starting detergent materials in die form of pastes, liquids and dry materials can be effectively agglomerated into crisp, free flowing detergent agglomerates having low densities.<br>
Accordingly, there remains a need in the art to have a process for continuously producing a low density detergent composition directly from starting detergent ingredients. Also, there remains a need for such a process which is more<br>
efficient, flexible and economical to facilitate large-scale production of detergents of low as well as high dosage levels.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <br>
The present invention meets the aforementioned needs in the art by providing a process which produces a low density (less than about 500 g/1) detergent composition directly from starting ingredients such as a liquid acid precursor of a surfactant and dry detergent ingredients. The dry ingredients include a silica material which ultimately is agglomerated such that it forms part of or is in the agglomerate particles themselves rather man "coated" on the outer surface of the agglomerates. Unexpectedly, this provides a low density agglomerate composition having improved physical properties. The process does not use the conventional spray drying towers currently used and is therefore more flexible with regard to the variety of detergent compositions which can be produced in the process. Moreover, the process is more amenable to environmental concerns in that it does not use spray drying towers which typically emit particulates and volatile organic compounds into the atmosphere.<br>
As used herein, the term "agglomerates" refers to particles formed by agglomerating detergent granules or particles which typically have a smaller mean particle size man me formed agglomerates. All percentages used herein are expressed as "percent-by-weight" unlets indicated otherwise. All viscosities described herein are measured at 70°C and at shear rates between about 10 to 50 sec" ^preferably at 25 sec-1. All documents cited herein are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a process for preparing low density detergent agglomerates having a density of below about 500 g/1 is provided. The process comprises the steps of: (a) agglomerating a liquid acid precursor of a detergent surfactant and dry starting detergent material in a high speed mixer to<br>
obtain detergent agglomerates, wherein the dry starting detergent material includes a silica material and an alkaline inorganic material; and (b) drying the detergent agglomerates so as to form the detergent composition having a density of less than about 600 g/1.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the invention, another process for preparing low density detergent agglomerates having a density of below about 500 g/1 is provided. The process comprises the steps of: (a) agglomerating a liquid acid precursor of a detergent surfactant and dry starting detergent material in a high speed mixer to obtain detergent agglomerates, wherein the dry starting detergent material includes a fumed silica material and an alkaline inorganic material; (b) mixing the detergent agglomerates in a moderate speed mixer to further agglomerate the detergent agglomerates; and (c) drying the detergent agglomerates so as to form the low density detergent composition having a density of less than about 500 g/1. The low density detergent composition made by any of the process embodiments described herein is also provided.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide a process for continuously producing a low density detergent composition directly from starting detergent ingredients. It is also an object of the invention to provide a process which is more efficient, flexible and economical to facilitate large-scale production of detergents of low as well as high dosage levels. These and other objects, features and attendant advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from a reading of the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment and the appended claims.<br>
STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a process for preparing a low density detergent composition comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	agglomerating a liquid acid precursor of a detergent surfactant and dry starting detergent material such as hereinbefore described in a high speed mixer to obtain detergent agglomerates, wherein said dry starting detergent material includes a silica material such as hereinbefore described and an alkaline inorganic material such as hereinbefore described; and<br>
(b)	drying said detergent agglomerates so as to form said detergent composition having a density of less than 500 g/l.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The present invention is directed to a process which produces free flowing, low density detergent agglomerates having a density of below about 500 g/l, preferably from about 350 g/l to about 500 g/l. The process produces low density detergent agglomerates from a liquid acid precursor of a detergent surfactant, typically of an anionic surfactant. Generally speaking, the present process is used in the production of normal as opposed to low dosage detergents whereby the resulting detergent agglomerates can be sued as a detergent or as a detergent additive. It should be understood that the process described herein can be continuos or batch depending upon the desired application. Process<br>
In the first step of the process, starting detergent materials are fed into a mixer fro agglomeration. To achieve the desired density of below 500 g/l, the agglomeration step is carried forth initially in a high speed mixer after which an<br><br>
optional moderate speed mixer may follow if further agglomeration is desired. The starting detergent materials preferably include a liquid acid precursor of a surfactant, preferably an anionic surfactant, and dry detergent material including silica and an alkaline inorganic material, the components of which are described more fully hereinafter. The starting detergent materials ate agglomerated in the presence of a silica material as described more lolly hereinafter to produce agglomerate particles having the desired low density. To that end, the instant process preferably entails mixing from about 1% to about 20%, more preferably from about 3% to about 10%, and most preferably from about 3% to about 5%, by weight of a silica material into the high speed mixer. The alkaline inorganic material is included to serve as an in situ neutralizing agent for the acid precursor in the high speed mixer. The relative amount of the alkaline material can vary since it should be present in an amount sufficient to neutralize the acid precursor. The nature and composition of the entering or starting detergent materials and optional  adjunct ingredients can vary as described in detail hereinafter.<br>
It has unexpectedly been found that by having the silica in the agglomerate rather man as a coating agent, a tew density agglomerate can be formed. This is contsary to expectations since using silica as a coating or dusting agent to such that it is deposited on the outer surface of agglomerate particles will raise or increase the density. However, as demonstrated by the present process invention, silica inside the agglomerate particles lowers the density as is desired for producing a low density agglomerated composition. While not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the silica whan subjected agglomeration with a surfactant and subsequent drying step forms a hollow "finger-like" structure inside the individual agglomerate particles, thereby increasing the internal void space in each agglomerate particle. This, of course, results in mote porous agglomerates having a relatively low density.<br>
The other essential step in the process involves drying the agglomerates exiting the high speed mixer or moderate speed mixer if it is optionally used. This can be completed in a wide variety of apparatus including but not limited to fluid bed dryers. The drying step enhances the free flowability of the agglomerates and facilities the "fluffy" or "puffy" physical characteristics of the resulting agglomerates. Accordingly, sufficient drying must occur in order to produce the desired low density agglomerates. In that regard, the drying temperature used in the whichever drying apparatus will preferably be from about 50 8C to about 300 8C, more preferably from about 80 °C to about 2S0 °C, and most preferably, from about 100 °C to about 250 °C.<br>
Preferably, the mean residence time of the starting detergent materials in the high speed mixer (e.g. Lddige Recycler CB 30 or other similar equipment) is from about 2 to 45 seconds while the residence time in the optional low or moderate speed mixer (e.g. Lddige Recycler KM 300 "Ploughshare" or other similar equipment) is from about 0.5 to 15 minutes.<br>
The detergent agglomerates produced by the process preferably have a surfactant level of from about 20% to about 55%, more preferably from about 35% to about 55% and, most preferably from about 45% to about 55%. The particle porosity of the resulting detergent agglomerates produced according to the process of the invention is preferably in a range from about 5% to about 50%, more preferably at about 25%. In addition, an attribute of dense or densified agglomerates is the relative particle size. The present process typically provides detergent agglomerates having a mean particle size of from about 250 microns to about 1000 microns, and more preferably from about 400 microns to about 600 microns. As used herein, the phrase "mean particle size" refers to individual agglomerates and not individual particles or detergent granules. The combination of the above-referenced porosity and particie size results in agglomerates having density values of below 500 g/1. Such a feature is especially useful in the production of laundry detergents having varying dosage levels as well as other granular compositions such as dishwashing compositions.<br>
In an optional step of the present process, the detergent agglomerates exiting the fluid bed dryer are further conditioned by cooling the agglomerates in a fluid bed cooler or similar apparatus as axe well known in the art. Another optional process step involves adding a coaling agent to improve flowability and/or minimize over agglomeration of the detergent composition in one or more of the following locations of the instant process: (1) the coating agent can be added directly after the fluid bed cooler; (2) the coating agent may be added between the fluid bed dryer and the fluid bed cooler, (3) the coating agent may be added between the fluid bed dryer and the moderate speed mixer; and/or (4) the coating agent may be added directly to the moderate speed mixer and the fluid bed dryer. The coating agent is preferably selected from the group consisting of aluminosilicates, silicates, carbonates and mixtures thereof. The coating agent not only enhances the free flowability of the resulting detergent composition which is desirable by consumers in that it permits easy scooping of detergent during use, but also serves to control agglomeration by preventing or minimizing over agglomeration, especially when added directly to the optional moderate speed mixer. As those skilled in the art are<br>
well aware, over agglomeration can lead to very undesirable flow properties and aesthetics of the final detergent product.<br>
Optionally, the process can comprise the step of spraying an additional binder in one or both of the mixer or fluid bed dryers. A binder is added for purposes of enhancing agglomeration by providing a "binding" or "sticking" agent for the detergent components. The binder is preferably selected from the group consisting of water, anionic surfactants, nonionic surfactants, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl pynolidone polyacrylatea, cttric acid and mixtures thereof. Other suitable binder materials including those listed herein are described in Beerse et al, U.S. Patent No. 5,108,646 (Procter &amp; Gamble Co.), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Other optional steps contemplated by the present process include screening the oversized detergent agglomerates in a screening apparatus which can take a variety of forms including but not limited to conventional screens chosen for the desired particle size of the finished detergent product Other optional steps include conditioning of the detergent agglomerates by subjecting the agglomerates to additional (faying in the one of the aforementioned drying apparatus.<br>
Other optional steps in the preeent process involve recycling oversized and undersized agglomerates aa described in Capeci et al, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,419,392 and 5,516,448 (Procter &amp; Gamble). Also, the step of including an anhydrous material at selected points in the process can be incorporated as described by Capeci et al, U.S. Patent No. 5,366,652 and 5,486,303 (Procter &amp; Gamble). Optionally, the agglomerates exiting the moderate speed mixer can be dried m a spray drying tower as described in Capeci et al, U.S. Patent 5,496,487 (Procter &amp; Gamble).<br>
Another optional step of the instant process entails finishing the resulting detergent agglomerates by a variety of processes including spraying and/or admixing other conventional detergent ingredients. For example, the finishing step encompasses spraying perfumes, brighteners and enzymes onto the finished agglomerates to provide a more complete detergent composition. Such techniques and ingredients are well known in the art.<br>
The liquid acid precursor of detergent surfactant used in the process is<br>
preferably in the form of an aqueous liquid acid precursor of an anionic surfactant,<br>
although forms are also contemplated by the invention. This so-called acid<br>
precursor of a surfactant paste contains at least about 5% water, more preferably at<br>
least about 10% water.	The surfactant itself ultimately formed via<br>
neutralization in situ in the high speed mixer is preferably selected from a variety of<br>
known anionics and compatible mixtures thereof. Detergent surfactants useful herein are described in U.S. Patent 3,664,961, Norris, issued May 23, 1972, and in U.S. Patent 3,919,678, Laughlin et al., issued December 30,1975, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. Nonlimiting examples of die preferred anionic surfactants useful in the surfactant paste include the conventional C11-C18 alkyl benzene sulfonates ("LAS"), primary, branched-chain and random C10-C20 alkyl sulfates ("AS"), the C10-C18 secondary (2,3) alkyl sulfates of the formula CH3(CH2)x(CHOS03'M+) CH3 and CH3 (CH2)y(CHOS03"M+) CH2CH3 where x and (y + 1) are integers of at least about 7, preferably at least about 9, and M is a water-solubilizing cation, especially sodium, unsaturated sulfates such as oleyl sulfate, and the C10-C18 alkyl aikoxy sulfates ("AEXS"; especially EO 1-7 ethoxy sulfates).<br>
Other adjunct surfactants may be optionally used in the process invention. Useful cationic surfactants also include those described in U.S. Patent 4,222,905, Cockrell, issued September 16,19*0, and in U.S. Patent 4,239,659, Murphy, issued December 16,1980, both of which are also incorporated herein by reference. Of the surfactants, anionics and cationica are preferred and anionics are most preferred.<br>
Optionally, other exemplary surfactants useful in the invention include and C10-C18 alkyl aikoxy carboxylates (especially the EO 1-5 ethoxycarboxylates), the C10-18 glycerol ethers, the C10-C18 alkyl polyglycosides and their corresponding sulfated polyglycosides,and C12-C18alpria-sulfonated fatty acid esters. If desired, the conventional nonionic and amphoteric surfactants such as the C12-C18 alkyl ethoxylates (" AE") including the so-called narrow peaked alkyl ethoxyiates and C6-C12 alkyl phenol alkoxylates (especially ethoxylates and mixed ethoxy/propoxy), C12-C18 betaines and sulfobetaines ("sultaines"),C10-C18 amine oxides, and the like, can also be included in the overall compositions. The C10-C18 N-alkyl polyhydroxy fatty acid amides can also be used. Typical examples include the C12-C18N-methylglucamidea. See WO 9,206,154. Other sugar-derived surfactants include the N-alkoxy polyhydroxy fatty acid amides, such as C10-C18 N-(3-methoxypropyl) glucamide. The N-propyl through N-hexyl C12-C18 giucamides can be used for low sudsing. C10-C20 conventional soaps may also be used. If high sudsing is desired, the branched-chain C10-C16 soaps may be used. Mixtures of anionic and nonionic surfactants are especially useful. Other conventional useful surfactants are listed in standard texts.<br>
Dry Detergent Material<br>
The starting dry detergent material of the present process preferably comprises an alkaline inorganic material and a silica material. The alkaline inorganic material is<br>
preferably selected from the group consisting of carbonates, silicates, phosphates and mixtures thereof. Sodium carbonate is the most preferred alkaline inorganic material used in the process and is preferably in the form of a solid powder. Silica is highly dispersed amorphous silicon dioxide that is commercially available in many forms. Most commonly, silica has a tapped density of from 50 g/1 to 120 g/1. The specific surface area of the particles ranges from 25 square meters per gram to 800 square meters per gram. The surface of the silica particles can be chemically modified to change their behavior with respect to water. For example, silica particles may be treated with organosilanes to make the particles predominantly hydrophobic. It has bean found that silicas that are hydrophobic in nature work extremely well in the current process invention; however, hydrophilic silicas axe useful in the process, as weil. Diatonuceous earth rnaieriais may be used in conjunction with, for, the silicas mentioned herein.<br>
Commercially, silicas are usually prepared by one of two techniques; either by precipitation (i.e. precipitated silicas) or by high temperature flame hydrolysis (i.e. fumed silicas). Both precipitated silicas and fumed silicas are useful in the current process invention. Precipitated silicas generally have an agglomerate size of from 3 micrometers to 100 micrometers, whereas fumed silicas made by flame hydrolysis usually have particles which are substantially spherical and have an average particle diameter offrom about 7 nm to about 40 nm. Fumed silicas having an average particle size of from about 7 to about 25 nm are preferred in the present invention. Exemplary commercially available silicas useful in the process invention include those supplied by Degussa AG (Germany) identified as Aeroail™, and particularly preferred is Aerosil™ R927. Silicas which are hydrophobic, fumed and have surface areas of at least about 110 square meters par gram and an average particle diameter size of 16 nm are moat preferred.<br>
The dry detergent material also preferably includes a detergent aluminosilicate builder which are referenced at aluminosilicate ion exchange materials. The aluminosilicate ion exchange materials used herein as a detergent builder preferably have both a high calcium ion exchange capacity and a high exchange rate. Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that such high calcium ion exchange rate and capacity are a function of several interrelated factors which derive from the method by which the aluminosilicate ion exchange material is produced. In that regard, the aluminosilicate ion exchange materials used herein are preferably produced in accordance with Corkill et al, U.S. Patent No. 4,605,509 (Procter &amp; Gamble), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Preferably, the aluminosilicate ion exchange material is in "sodium" form since the potassium and hydrogen forms of the instant aluminosilicate do not exhibit the as high of an exchange rate and capacity as provided by the sodium form. Additionally, the aluminosilicate ion exchange material preferably is in over dried form so as to facilitate production of crisp detergent agglomerates as described herein. The aluminosiiicate ion exchange materials used herein preferably have particle size diameters which optimize their effectiveness as detergent builders. The term "particle size diameter" as used herein represents the average particle size diameter of a given aluminosilicate ion exchange material as determined by conventional analytical techniques, such as microscopic determination and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The preferred particle size diameter of the aluminosilicate is from about 0.1 micron to about 10 microns, more preferably from about 0.S microtis to about 9 microns. Most preferably, the particle size diameter is from about 1 microns to about 8 microns.<br>
Preferably, the aluminosilicate ion exchange material has the formula Naz[AlO2)2.(SiO2)y3xH20 wherein z and y are integers of at least 6, the molar ratio of z to y is from about 1 to about 5 and x is from about 10 to about 264. More preferably, the aluminosilicate has the formula<br>
Na12{(AlO2)12.(Si02)l2]xH20 <br>
wherein x is from about 20 to about 30, preferably about 27. These preferred aluminosilicates are available commercially, for example under designations Zeolite A, Zeolite B and Zeolite X. Alternatively, naturaily-occuring or synthetically derived aluminosilicate ion exchange materials suitable for use herein can be made as described in Krummel et al, U.S. Patent No. 3,981,669, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The aluminosilicates used herein are further characterized by their ion exchange capacity which is at least about 200 mg equivalent of CaCO3 hardness/gram, calculated on an anhydrous basis, and which is preferably in a range from about 300 to 352 mg equivalent of CaCO3 hardness/gram. Additionally, the instant aluminosilicate ion exchange materials are still further characterized by their calcium ion exchange rate which is at least about 2 grains Ca++/galior/minute/-granVgallon, and more preferably in a range from about 2 grains Ca++/gallon/minute/graro/gallon to about 6 grains Ca++/gallon/minute/-gram/gallon.<br>
An especially preferred set of dry detergent material is selected from the group consisting of aluminosilicates, crystalline layered silicates, sodium carbonate and mixtures thereof<br>
Adiunct Detergent Ingredients<br>
The starting dry detergent material in the present process can include additional detergent ingredients and/or, any number of additional ingredients can be incorporated in the detergent composition during subsequent steps of the present process. These adjunct ingredients include other detergency builders, bleaches, bleach activators, suds boosters or suds suppressers, anti-tarnish and anti-corrosion agents, soil suspending agents, soil release agents, germicides, pH adjusting agents, non-builder alkalinity sources, chelating agents, smectite clays, enzymes, enzyme-stabilizing agents and perfumes. See U.S. Patent 3,936,537, issued February 3,1976 to Baskerville,- Jr. et al„ incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Other builders can be generally selected from the various water-soluble, alkali metal, ammonium or substituted ammonium phosphates, polyphosphates, phosphonates, polyphosphonatcs, carbonates, borates, polyhydroxy sulfonates, polyacctates, carboxylases, and polycarboxylates. Preferred are the alkali metal, especially sodium, salts of the above. Preferred for use herein are the phosphates, carbonates, C10-18 fatty acids, polycarboxylates, and mixtures thereof. More preferred are sodium tripolyphosphate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, citrate, tartrate mono- and di-succinates, and mixtures thereof (see below).<br>
In comparison with amorphous sodium silicates, crystalline layered sodium silicates exhibit a clearly increased calcium and magnesium ion exchange capacity. In addition, the layered sodium silicates prefer magnesium ions over calcium ions, a feature necessary to insure that substantially all of the "hardness" is removed from the wash water. These crystalline layered sodium silicates, however, are generally more expensive than amorphous silicates as well as other builders. Accordingly, in order to provide an economically feasible laundry detergent, the proportion of crystalline layered sodium silicates used must be determined judiciously.<br>
The crystalline layered sodium silicates suitable for use herein preferably have the formula<br>
NaMSix02x+l.yH20 <br>
wherein M is sodium or hydrogen, x is from about 1.9 to about 4 and y is from about 0 to about 20. More preferably, the crystalline layered sodium silicate has the formula<br>
NaMSi205.yH20 <br>
wherein M is sodium or hydrogen, and y is from about 0 to about 20. These and other crystalline layered sodium silicates are discussed in Corkill et al, U.S. Patent No. 4,605,509, previously incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Specific examples of inorganic phosphate builders are sodium and potassium tripolyphosphate, pyrophosphate, polymeric metaphosphate having a degree of<br>
polymerization of from about 6 to 21, and orthophosphates. Examples of polyphosphonate builders are the sodium and potassium salts of ethylene diphosphonic acid, the sodium and potassium salts of ethane 1 -hydroxy-1, 1 -diphosphonic acid and the sodium and potassium salts of ethane, 1,1,2-triphos-phonic acid. Other phosphorus builder compounds are disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,159,581; 3,213,030; 3,422,021; 3,422,137; 3,400,176 and 3,400,148, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Examples of nonphosphorus, inorganic builders are tetraborate decahydrate and silicates having a weight ratio of SiO2 to alkali metal oxide of from about 0.5 to about 4.0, preferably from about 1.0 to about 2.4. Water-soluble, nonphosphorus organic builders useful herein include the various alkali metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium polyacetates, carboxylates, polycarboxylates and polyhydroxy sulfonates. Examples of polyacetate and polycarboxylate builders are the sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts of ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, nitrilotriacetic acid, oxydisuccinic acid, mellitic acid, benzene polycarboxylic acids, and citric acid.<br>
Polymeric polycarboxylate builders are set forth in U.S. Patent 3,308,067, Diehl, issued March 7,1967, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Such materials include the water-soluble salts of homo- and copolymers of aliphatic carboxylic acids such as maleic acid, itaconic acid, mesaconic acid, furnaric acid, aconitic acid, citraconic acid and methylene malonic acid. Some of these materials are useful as the water-soluble anionic polymer as hereinafter described, but only if in intimate admixture with the non-soap anionic surfactant.<br>
Other suitable polycarboxylates for use herein are the polyacetal carboxylates described in U.S. Patent 4,144,226, issued March 13,1979 to Crutchfield et al, and U.S. Patent 4,246,495, issued March 27, 1979 to Crutchfield et al, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. These polyacetal carboxylases can be prepared by bringing together under polymerization conditions an ester of glyoxylic acid and a polymerization initiator. The resulting polyacetal carboxyiate ester is then attached to chemically stable end groups to stabilize the polyacetal carboxyiate against rapid depolymerization in alkaline solution, converted to the corresponding salt, and added to a detergent composition. Particularly preferred polycarboxylate builders are the ether carboxyiate builder compositions comprising a combination of tartrate monosuccmate and tartrate disuccinate described in U.S. Patent 4,663,071, Bush et al., issued May 5, 1987, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Bleaching agents and activators are described in U.S. Patent 4.412.P34, Chung et al., issued November 1, 1983, and in U.S. Patent 4,483,781, Hartman, issued "November 20,1984, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. Chelating agents are also described in U.S. Patent 4,663,071, Bush et al., from Column 17, line 54 through Column 18. line 68, incorporated herein by reference. Suds modifiers are also optional ingredients and are described in U.S. Patents 3,933,672, issued January 20,1976 to Bartoletta et al., and 4,136,045, issued January 23,1979 to Gault et al., bom incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Suitable smectite clays for use herein are described in U.S. Patent 4.762,645, Tucker et al, issued August 9,1988, Column 6, line 3 through Column 7, line 24, incorporated herein by reference. Suitable additional detergency builders for use herein are enumerated in the Baskcrville patent, Column 13, line 54 through Column 16, line 16, and in U.S. Patent 4,663,071, Bush et al, issued May 5,1987, both incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In order to make the present invention more readily understood, reference is made to the following examples, which are intended to be illustrative only and not intended to be limiting in scope.<br>
EXAMPLES I-IV<br>
These Examples illustrates a batch mode of the instant process and one Example outside the scope of the invention. A low density agglomerated detergent composition is prepared using a lab tilt-a-pin (commercially available from Processall, Inc.) mixer. The mixer is first charged with a mixture of powders, namely sodium carbonate (mean particle size of 5-40 microns made via Air Classifier Mill), light density, granular sodium tripolyphosphate (commercially supplied by FMC Corp. and referenced herein as "STPP")), 2eolite type A (commercially supplied by Ethyl Corp. and noted as below as "Zeolite A"), and fumed silica (commercially supplied by Cabot Corporation under the trade name M-5 Cab-o-sil™), except Example IV did not use this or any fumed silica material. The liquid acid precursor of sodium alkylbenzene sulfonate (C12H25-C6H4-SO3-H or "HLAS" as referenced herein) surfactant is then added on top of the powder mixture while the mixer is operated for about 15 seconds at 700 rpm until discrete granules are formed in the mixer. The composition of the agglomerates formed are set forth below in Table I.<br>
TABLE I<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Unexpectedly, the resulting agglomerates of Examples I, II and II have a bulk density below 500 g/L, all of which are made by a process involving silica and within the scope of the process invention. By contrast, the agglomerates produced in Example IV did not involve silica (i.e., outside the scope of the process invention) which resulted in agglomerates hiving a density of above 500 g/L<br>
EXAMPLE V-VIII <br>
These Examples describe agglomerated compositions made by the process described in the Examples I-III with exception mat a different silica material is used in the process invention. Specifically, fumed versus precipitated, and hydrophobic versus hydrophilic silicas were used in the process to illustrate that all of these various silicas provide agglomerates having low densities (i.e. below about 500 g/1). All of the silicas are commercially supplied by Degussa under the various trade names noted below. The following compositions are made as shown in Table III.<br>
TABLE III<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Unexpectedly, the resulting agglomerates which are made in accordance with the process invention all have a bulk density below 500 g/L.<br>
Having thus described the invention in detail, it will be clear to those skilled in the art that various changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention and the invention is not to be considered limited to what is described in the specification. <br><br><br><br><br><br>
