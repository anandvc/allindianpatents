Disclosure of Invention<br>
[1] The present application claims the priority benefits of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/765,214 filed on February 6,2006 and Korean Patent<br>
Applications Nos. 10-2006-0109113 and 10-2007-0009094 respectively filed<br>
on November 6, 2006 and January 29,2007 in Republic of Korea. The entire<br>
contents of these applications are herein fully incorporated by reference.<br>
[2] The present invention relates to a Voice Call Continuity (VCC), and more<br>
particularly, to selecting, by a VCC application server or a terminal, a<br>
domain by taking into account user preferences and operator policy and<br>
placing originating and/or terminating calls over the selected domain.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[3] In general, a Voice Call Continuity (VCC) refers to a type of application,<br>
namely, a home IMS application which is capable of transporting voice calls<br>
between a CS (circuit-switched) domain and an IMS (IP multimedia<br>
subsystem) domain. The VCC (also referred to as the VCC application)<br>
provides functions of voice call originations, voice call terminations and a<br>
domain transfer from the CS domain to the IMS domain or vice versa. Here,<br>
the domain transfer refers to transferring access legs for voice calls toward a<br>
user equipment (UE) (i.e., a terminal) from the CS domain to the IMS<br>
domain or vice versa during an active session. The access leg denotes a call<br>
control leg between a VCC UE and a Domain Transfer Function (DTF) of<br>
the VCC application.<br><br>
[4] The domain transfer for a certain voice call/session from the CS domain<br>
to the IMS domain or vice versa is performed only when a DTF is<br>
positioning on a signal path of the voice call/session setup. For this,<br>
positioning of the DTF on the way of the signal path of the voice call/session<br>
setup is referred to as anchoring in IMS or anchoring.<br>
[5] Fig. 1 illustrates an architecture of a network for providing a VCC<br>
service.<br>
[6] As illustrated in Fig. 1, a VCC UE 10 denotes any type of terminal which<br>
support the VCC service. The VCC UE can access CS and PS (packed<br>
switched) domains.<br>
That is, when accessing the CS domain, the VCC UE uses a UE-CS (not<br>
shown) provided therein, whereas a UE-IMS (not shown) provided therein is<br>
used when accessing the PS domain.<br>
[7] A VCC application 20 is an application server for providing the VCC<br>
service, and is constituted with entities which perform a series of functions.<br>
That is, the series of functions may include functions required to setup voice<br>
calls toward the VCC UE, and functions required to switch an access leg of<br>
the VCC UE between the CS domain and the IMS domain with maintaining<br>
an active session. Here, as shown, the series of functions can be a Domain<br>
Transfer Function 20a, a Domain Selection Function 20d, a CS Adaptation<br>
Function 20b, and a CAMEL Service Application 20c. Detailed capabilities<br>
and operations of the series of functions are described in 3GPP TS 23.206<br>
Vl.2.0.<br>
[8] Generally, the CS domain entities include Visited Mobile Switching<br>
Center<br>
(VMSC), Gateway MSC (GMSC), gsmSCF, and the like. The IMS domain<br>
entities include P-CSCF, S-CSCF, I-CSCF and Media Gateway Control<br><br>
Function (MGCF).<br>
These are known entities.<br>
[9] Hereinafter, a method for processing VCC call origination and VCC call<br>
termination in a VCC service will be explained with reference to Figs. 2<br>
through 5 according to the background art, which is implemented in the<br>
network architecture of Fig. 1. Figs. 2 through 5 illustrate signal paths (or<br>
routing) for performing an outgoing/ incoming call setup session. That is,<br>
Figs. 2 and 3 illustrate a signal path of an originating call in the VCC service.<br>
In particular, Fig. 2 illustrates a signal path of an originating call over a CS<br>
domain in the VCC service, while Fig. 3 illustrates a signal path of an<br>
originating call over an IMS domain in the VCC service. An originating call<br>
is also known as an outgoing call, i.e., a call outgoing from the VCC UE 10<br>
to the VCC application 20. Meanwhile, Figs. 4 and 5 illustrate a signal path<br>
of a terminating call in the VCC service. Particularly, Fig. 4 illustrates a<br>
signal path of a terminating call over the CS domain in the VCC service,<br>
while Fig. 5 illustrates a signal path of a terminating call over the IMS<br>
domain in the VCC service. A terminating call is also known as an incoming<br>
call, i.e., a call incoming to the VCC UE 10 terminal from the VCC<br>
application 20. Here, the VCC call denotes a call which is terminated or<br>
originated by the VCC UE 10, namely, a voice call having a call continuity<br>
by being anchored in the VCC application 20 located in the home IMS<br>
domain, even while a domain is transferred from the CS domain to the IMS<br>
domain or vice versa.<br>
[10] It is assumed in Figs. 2 through 5 that a user of a UE (i.e., VCC UE) is a<br>
VCC subscriber allowing for a home network thus to use the VCC service,<br>
and is currently residing in a visited network.<br>
[11] Hereinafter, a signal path of outgoing calls over a CS domain will be<br>
explained with reference to Fig. 2 according to the background art<br>
[12] When a VCC subscriber attempts to place a CS call, the UE which is<br><br>
currently residing in the visited network executes a CS call setup by the<br>
VMSC on the CS domain. The CS call is transported over to a Domain<br>
Transfer Function (DTF) in the IMS domain of the home network, where it is<br>
anchored in the IMS. Next, the session (i.e., the call) corresponding to this is<br>
transported over to PSTN, for example, which is a terminating network.<br>
Afterwards, normal IMS terminating procedures take place.<br>
[13] Hereinafter, a signal path of outgoing calls over an IMS domain will be<br>
explained with reference to Fig. 3 according to the background art.<br>
[14] When a VCC subscriber attempts to place an IMS call, the UE which is<br>
currently residing in the visited network executes an IMS call setup on the<br>
IMS domain. The IMS call is transported over to P-CSCF via IP-CAN.<br>
Afterwards, the IMS call is transported over to the DTF in the IMS domain<br>
of a home network, and then transported over to PSTN in a terminating<br>
network. Afterwards, normal IMS terminating procedures take place.<br>
[15] Hereinafter, a signal path of incoming calls over a CS domain will be<br>
explained with reference to Fig. 4 according to the background art.<br>
[16] When an originating party (or A-party) attempts to place a call to a<br>
terminating party (or B-party), the originating party originates a call which<br>
reaches a Gateway MSC (GMSC). If the B-party is recognized as a VCC<br>
subscriber in the home network, the call is routed to a DTF in the IMS<br>
domain. From the DTF, if the call is to be placed over the CS domain, the<br>
call is routed back to the CS domain via- GMSC, namely, to the VMSC in the<br>
visited network. Here, all calls originating from the PSTN to the CS domain<br>
are routed to the IMS domain which is thusly anchored in the DTF.<br>
[17] Hereinafter, a signal path of incoming calls over an IMS domain will be<br>
explained with reference to Fig. 5 according to the background art.<br>
[18] If an incoming call could be placed to the UE over the IMS domain, the<br>
call anchored in the DTF proceeds over to a terminating terminal, namely, to<br>
an IMS URI of the UE via the P-CSCF and the IP-CAN of the visited<br><br>
network. That is, the call undergone the same anchoring procedure as<br>
illustrated in Fig. 4 is terminated in the IMS domain of the visited network.<br>
[19] Thus, as illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3, when the UE originates a call (i.e.,<br>
the call is an outgoing call), the user of the UE (i.e., the VCC subscriber)<br>
selects a certain domain (i.e., IMS domain or CS domain) that he prefers to<br>
use without taking operator policy into account, and directs the call to the<br>
selected domain. Therefore, the background art has technical limitations in<br>
that the UE selects a domain without taking the operator policy into account,<br>
and directs the call to the selected domain. Here, the operator policy includes<br>
information related to the domain selection for calls depending on a current<br>
state of a network (e.g., a state regarding resource allocation or traffic, etc.).<br>
[20] Furthermore, as illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5, the UE can not receive an<br>
incoming call over a domain (i.e., IMS domain or CS domain) that he prefers<br>
to use. In other words, in the background art, when selecting a domain for an<br>
incoming call, a network (i.e., CCCF in detail) selects the domain for an<br>
incoming call toward the UE based upon the operator policy without taking<br>
into account the UE user's preferences with respect to selecting the domain.<br>
Accordingly, the background art contains a technical problem/ limitation in<br>
that the UE user' preference of a domain selection cannot be or is not taken<br>
into account by the VCC application when the VCC application selects a<br>
domain in the domain selection process for the incoming call toward the UE.<br>
[21] Therefore, as aforementioned, from the UE perspective, since the UE<br>
selects a domain without considering the operator policy which could be<br>
changed (or updated) due to, for example, a network state or traffic, etc.,<br>
there occurs a call inconsistency caused by the traffic of a certain domain<br>
(IMS or CS) generated over a network or a lack of resources allocated for a<br>
certain domain, or a frequent domain transfer.<br>
[22] Furthermore, from the network perspective, the network (e.g., CCCF)<br>
selects a domain without taking into account the user's preferences for<br><br>
selecting a domain of an outgoing call. Accordingly, a call inconsistency<br>
occurs or unnecessary domain transfers may be triggered frequently, in case<br>
the UE has a mechanical problem or the UE can not be connected to a certain<br>
domain.<br>
[23] In addition, the UE user can register or update user preferences through<br>
web pages other than the UE. In this case, if the updated preferences are not<br>
notified to the network or UE, the domain may incorrectly be selected, which<br>
results in a malfunction of the UE.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
[24] Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a UE that<br>
sets or updates in a network (i.e., a VCC application) user preferences (which<br>
includes domain selection information) with respect to incoming calls and<br>
accordingly calls can be placed by taking the user preferences into account<br>
when the network selects a domain for the incoming calls.<br>
[25] It is another object of the present invention to provide a method and<br>
terminal for selecting a domain of outgoing calls by taking into account<br>
operator policy of a network when originating outgoing calls by a UE, the<br>
operator policy including domain selection information indicating a network-<br>
preferred domain to be selected.<br>
[26] Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of<br>
considering one of operator policy information indicating a network<br>
preferred domain and user preference information indicating a user-preferred<br>
domain when selecting a domain for an incoming or outgoing call by a<br>
terminal or a network server such as a VCC application server.<br>
[27] Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of<br>
providing domain selection information, which has higher priority between<br><br>
the operator policy information and the user preference information, and<br>
selecting a domain for an incoming or outgoing call using the domain<br>
selection information which has higher priority between them.<br>
[28] Another object of the present invention is to provide a method, terminal<br>
and server for providing a VCC service, which address the limitations and<br>
disadvantages associated with the background art.<br>
[29] To achieve these and other objects, there is provided according to an<br>

a terminal, domain selection information related to an outgoing call from a<br>

Detailed Description of the invention<br>
[49] The present invention is applicable to a Voice Call Continuity (VCC)<br>
field of 3GPP, and it may also be applicable to other communication fields.<br>
[50] The present invention conceptually is related to selecting a domain of an<br>
ongoing call base on user preferences (referred to as 'first Domain Selection<br>
Information') or operator policy (referred to as 'second Domain Selection<br>
Information') in case of transferring a domain of the ongoing call from CS<br>
domain to IMS domain or vice versa. The present invention may provide<br>
preferred embodiments for incoming call and outgoing call as follows.<br>
[51] The present invention conceptually is related to, first, setting or<br>
updating, by a UE, so-called domain selection information related to<br>
selecting a domain in a corresponding entity of a network, whereby an<br>
incoming call toward the UE can be placed over a domain desired by a UE<br>
user. The incoming call toward the UE is placed toward the UE based upon<br>
the set or updated domain selection information. Especially, the domain<br>
selection information can be set or updated in a certain entity (e.g., a VCC<br>
application) of the network through the UE handled by the UE user or<br>
through a web page which the UE user accesses using any other terminal<br>
(e.g., PCs or PDAs). Also, when a network server selects a domain for an<br>
incoming call, a domain for the incoming call may be selected using one of<br>
the user preferences and operator policy.<br><br>
Here, depending on information related to predefined network management<br>
policy, predefined rules (or policy), information preset by a user and etc., it<br>
may be defined (or set) such that one of the user preferences and the operator<br>
policy may have higher priority than the other. Based on the domain<br>
selection information (i.e., the user preferences or the operator policy) having<br>
precedence, a domain for the incoming call may be selected. Further the<br>
second domain selection information may include 'precedence information1<br>
indicating which one of the first domain selection information (user<br>
preferences) and the second domain selection information (operator policy)<br>
has higher priority (or precedence) than the other. Here, the precedence<br>
information, which indicates which domain selection information should be<br>
used among the first domain selection information (the user preferences) the<br>
second domain selection information (the operator policy).<br>
[52] Second, when placing an outgoing call originated by the HE, the UE<br>
receives and stores the set or updated domain selection information notified<br>
by a certain entity (e.g., a VCC application) of a network. Afterwards, the<br>
UE selects a domain (e.g., IMS domain or CS domain) for an outgoing call<br>
based upon the stored domain selection information to place the call over the<br>
selected domain. Here, the domain selection information is set or updated by<br>
being included in operator policy, and such operator policy information can<br>
be transmitted from the network entity such as the VCC application to the<br>
UE. Also, when a network server selects a domain for an outgoing call, a<br>
domain for the outgoing call may be selected using one of the user<br>
preferences and operator policy. Here, depending on information related to<br>
predefined network management policy, predefined rules (or policy),<br>
information preset by a user and etc., it may be defined (or set) such that one<br>
of the user preferences and the operator policy may have higher priority than<br>
the other. Based on the domain selection information (i.e., the user<br>
preferences or the operator policy) having higher priority, a domain for the<br><br>
outgoing call may be selected. Further, the second domain selection<br>
information may include 'precedence information' indicating which one of<br>
the first domain selection information (user preferences) and the second<br>
domain selection information (operator policy) has higher priority (or<br>
precedence) than the other. Here, the precedence information indicates which<br>
domain selection information should be used between the first domain<br>
selection information (the user preferences) and the second domain selection<br>
information (the operator policy).<br>
[53] Hereinafter, terms used or to be used in the description of the present<br>
invention will now be generally defined.<br>
[54] An UE according to the present invention may include all types of<br>
terminals which can be used for the VCC service. For instance, the UE<br>
according to the present invention comprehensively includes mobile<br>
communications terminals (e.g., UEs, mobile phones, cellular phones, DMB<br>
phones, DVB-H phones, PDAs, PTT, etc.), digital TV sets, GPS navigation,<br>
portable game machines, MP3, other home appliances, and the like.<br>
[55] User preferences, first domain selection information, generally denote<br>
information (or parameter) for defining domain selection information which<br>
indicates what domain the UE user prefers to use for incoming or outgoing<br>
calls when the UE (or terminal) is available over both the CS domain and<br>
IMS domain. The user can set priority (i,e., preference) of a domain (e.g.,<br>
;JMS domain or CS domain) preferred to-be-used for the outgoing or<br>
incoming calls and stores it in the UE. The UE accordingly can select the<br>
domain for the outgoing calls based upon the stored priority (i.e., user<br>
preference). If the UE user, on the other hand, has registered (or updated)<br>
user preferences in a certain entity (e.g., VCC application) of a network by<br>
use of the UE (or any other terminal), a domain (i.e., IMS domain or CS<br>
domain) for incoming calls can be selected according to the registered user<br>
preferences. Conversely, the user preferences for incoming calls toward the<br><br>
UE can be set by the UE, information of which is transmitted to a certain<br>
entity (e.g., VCC application) of the network to be then stored. The user<br>
preferences can include other information in addition to the user-preferred<br>
domain selection information. The user preference can be transmitted from<br>
the UE to the VCC application (network server) via a V3 interface (11 in Fig.<br>
1) such as aUt interface which is a direct communication interface between<br>
the VCC application and the UE. The V3 interface and the Ut interface are<br>
known in the art Operator policy generally means information related to<br>
domain selection as well as policy (or information) related management and<br>
maintenance on a network and/or a system, second domain selection<br>
information. However, operator policy, second domain selection information,<br>
denotes information (or parameter) for defining just domain selection<br>
information which indicates which domain is required (or preferred) by an<br>
operator to use for incoming calls or outgoing calls when the UE (or the<br>
terminal) is available over both the CS domain and IMS domain. The<br>
operator policy can be applied to both the outgoing calls and incoming calls.<br>
For example, the incoming and/or outgoing calls can be routed to the CS<br>
domain or IMS domain based upon the operator policy. Alternatively, the<br>
operator policy may not have any information regarding the incoming and/or<br>
outgoing calls. Also, priorities for a user's preferred domain of incoming and/<br>
or outgoing calls (e.g., 1. IMS over I-RLAN; 2.CS; 3.IMS over PS; etc.)may<br>
be listed based upon the operator policy. The incoming and/or outgoing calls<br>
can be routed to the CS domain or IMS domain based upon the list of<br>
priorities. Operator policy including the network- preferred domain selection<br>
information can be provided to the UE from the network entity such as the<br>
VCC application through a V3 interface using a Device Management (DM),<br>
Client Provisioning (CP) or Factory Provisioning (FP), etc. The DM, CP, and<br>
FP are known in the art. For instance, each of the UE and the VCC<br>
application can include a DMA unit to provide the DM function. Also, the<br><br>
operator policy for incoming calls can be set and stored by the network and<br>
then transmitted to the VCC application.<br>
[56] Hereinafter, construction and operations of the present invention will be<br>
explained in detail with reference to Figs. 6 through 9.<br>
[57] Fig. 6 is a signal flowchart illustrating three different examples of<br>
storing user preferences in a network such that the network entity such as the<br>
VCC application 20 can select a domain for incoming calls based upon the<br>
user preferences, depending on the precedence information, in accordance<br>
with one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[58] More particularly, in Fig. 6, the first example is illustrated through a<br>
series of steps (SIO), the second example is illustrated through a series of<br>
steps (S20), and the third example is illustrated through a series of steps<br>
(S30). The three examples in Fig. 6 are classified according to a subject by<br>
which user preferences are stored in a certain entity of a network. The steps<br>
SIO, S20 and S30 are mutually independent without any relation to one<br>
another, and the receiving step S2 of Fig. 6 can incorporate any of these steps<br>
SIO, S20 and S30.<br>
[59] In the first example in Fig. 6, the series of steps (SIO) is a signal<br>
flowchart illustrating, that a UE user sets or updates user preferences<br>
(including the user-preferred domain selection information indicating the<br>
user's preferred domain) and transmits the set or updated user preferences to<br>
a VCC application^^ a network.<br>
[60] Hereinafter, the series of steps (SIO) as the first example in Fig. 6 will<br>
be explained.<br>
[61] As shown in Fig. 6, a UE user sets or updates user preferences to include<br>
domain selection information for indicating a domain preferred by the user,<br>
e.g., for incoming calls toward the UE 10 (SI 1). Here, the UE user may<br><br>
query the current user's preferences from the VCC application 20 before step<br>
SI1.<br>
[62] The UE 10 then transmits the user preferences including the user-<br>
preferred domain selection information to the VCC application 20 (S 12).<br>
This can be made by using a V3 interface such as aUt interface between the<br>
UE 10 and the VCC application 20.<br>
Each of the UE 10 and the VCC application 20 may include aUt interface<br>
unit to provide the Ut interface.<br>
[63] The VCC application 20 stores the received user preferences in an<br>
internal memory or in a remote entity (e.g., HSS (home subscriber server) of<br>
a home network) (S 13). As an example, If the user preferences is preset to<br>
have higher priority than the operator policy, the VCC application 20 can<br>
make a domain selection for incoming calls by using the user preferences<br>
when selecting the domain for the incoming calls-toward the UE 10. On the<br>
other hand, if the operator policy is preset to have higher priority than the<br>
user preferences, the VCC application 20 can make a domain selection for<br>
incoming calls by using the operator policy when selecting the domain for<br>
the incoming calls toward the UE 10.<br>
[64] The VCC application 20 can optionally transmit a response message<br>
(e.g., an ACK message) with respect to step S12 (S14). The response<br>
message (e.g., the ACK message) in step S ;14 can be transmitted before or<br>
after step S 13, and is an optional step.<br>
[65] Hereinafter, the series of steps S20 as the second example in Fig. 6 will<br>
be explained.<br>
[66] In the second example, a user (i.e. a VCC subscriber) sends the user<br>
preferences including the user-preferred domain selection information to the<br>
VCC application 10 through any other wired/wireless communication device<br>
such as PCs or PDAs other than the UE 10, and sets or updates previous user<br>
preferences in the VCC application 20 (S21). For example, the user can<br><br>
access the VCC application 20 via the wired/ wireless communication device<br>
such as the PC to update or set the user preferences, e.g., to update or set the<br>
user-preferred domain selection information. Alternatively, the user can<br>
access a webpage which is interworked with the VCC application 20 via any<br>
other wired/wireless communication device other than the UE so as to update<br>
or set the user preferences. Here, the communication device (e.g., PC) and<br>
the VCC application 20 may be connected to each other via aUt interface or<br>
VCC UE-VCC application interface or any other interface. At step S21, the<br>
user preferences can be obtained from the VCC application itself or from an<br>
external device.<br>
[67] Then the VCC application 20 transmits the set or updated user<br>
preferences including the user-preferred domain selection information to the<br>
UE 10 (S22). The UE 10 then stores the received user preferences in a<br>
certain memory provided in the UE (S23).<br>
[68] The UE 10 may optionally transmit a response message (e.g., an ACK<br>
message) in response to step S22 (S24). The response message (e.g., the<br>
ACK message) in step S24 may be transmitted before or after step S23, and<br>
is an optional step.<br>
[69] Accordingly, in the second example of Fig. 6, the VCC application 20<br>
selects a domain for incoming calls based upon the user preferences stored<br>
therein (e.g.,,. user preferences that the user stores by use of any other wired/<br>
wireless communication device other than the UE) or the operator policy, -<br>
depending on the precedence information. The UE, on the other hand, selects<br>
a domain for outgoing calls based on the user preferences stored in step S23<br>
or the operator policy, depending on the precedence information.<br>
[70] Hereinafter, the series of steps S30 as the third example in Fig. 6 will be<br>
explained.<br><br>
[71] This example illustrates that the UE queries the user preferences that the<br>
VCC ap- plication has (stores). The UE queries the user preferences for<br>
incoming calls from the VCC application 20 (S31).<br>
[72] The VCC application 20 retrieves the user preferences (including the<br>
user-preferred domain selection information) which have previously been<br>
stored in an internal entity or a remote or external entity (S32). Here, the<br>
internal entity can be one of the Domain Transfer Function 20a, the CS<br>
Adaptation Function 20b, the CAMEL Service Application 20c, and the<br>
Domain Selection Function 20d of the VCC application 20, or any other<br>
VCC element. The VCC application 20 uses the user preferences or the<br>
operator policy to perform a domain selection for an incoming call,<br>
depending on the precedence information as discussed above. The VCC<br>
application 20 returns the<br>
retrieved user preferences to the UE (S33).<br>
[73] As aforementioned, in the first to third examples illustrated in Fig. 6,<br>
when the VCC application 20 selects a domain for incoming calls, or when<br>
the UE selects a domain for outgoing calls, the VCC application 20 or the<br>
UE 10 can take into account the user preferences including the user-preferred<br>
domain selection information or the operator policy including the network-<br>
preferred domain selection information, depending on the precedence<br>
- information. Fig. 7 is a signal flowchart illustrating, as an example, a<br>
"procedure of transmitting operator policy for outgoing calls from a network -<br>
server to a UE in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The procedure (steps S71, S72 and S73) of Fig. 7 can be used in the<br>
receiving step S2 of Fig. 6, whereby the UE receives the operator policy<br>
from the VCC application.<br>
[74] Referring to Fig. 7, operator policy for outgoing calls is set or updated<br>
in the VCC application 20 (S71). This operator policy includes the network-<br>
preferred domain selection information, and can include other information,<br><br>
e.g., the precedence information. The VCC application 20 then transmits the<br>
set or updated operator policy to the UE 10, e.g., via a V3 interface such as<br>
using a DM method (S 72).<br>
[75] The UE 10 then stores the received operator policy for the outgoing<br>
calls in a certain memory or storage unit (S73). The UE 10 then transmits a<br>
response message (e.g., an ACK message) to the VCC application 20 in<br>
response to step S72 (S74). Here, the response message (i.e., the ACK<br>
message) in step S74 may be transmitted before or after step S73, and can be<br>
an optional step.<br>
[76] After steps S71 to S74 performed, for placing an outgoing call, the UE<br>
10 can then take into account the set or updated operator policy or the user<br>
preferences stored in UE, to select a domain for the outgoing call, and then<br>
places the outgoing call over the selected domain (e.g., CS domain or IMS<br>
domain). That is, the UE 10 may determine (or check, or detect) which<br>
domain selection information has been preset to get higher priority between<br>
the user preference (i.e., first domain selection information) and the operator<br>
policy (i.e., second domain selection information). Next, using the<br>
determined domain selection information (i.e., the user preference or the<br>
operator policy), the UE 10 makes domain selection and places the outgoing<br>
call over the selected domain (e.g., CS domain or IMS domain): As an<br>
example, if the operator policy is preset to have higher priority than the user<br>
preferences, the-UE 10- can make a domain selection for outgoing calls by<br>
using (or referring, or retrieving) the operator policy when selecting the<br>
domain for the outgoing calls toward the VCC application 20. On the other<br>
hand, if the user preferences is preset to have higher priority than the<br>
operator policy, the UE 10 can make a domain selection for outgoing calls by<br>
using (or referring, or retrieving) the user preferences when selecting the<br>
domain for the outgoing calls toward the VCC application 20. Only as an<br>
example, as illustrated in Fig. 7, the outgoing call over the CS domain can be<br><br>
placed according to the series of steps in Fig. 7 (i.e., S75 to S85), or the<br>
outgoing call over the IMS domain can be placed according to the series of<br>
steps in Fig. 7 (i.e., S75' to S82'). The processes of placing a call over the CS<br>
domain or the IMS domain as indicated in steps S75 to S85 and steps S75' to<br>
. S82', onGe the domain selection has been according to the present invention,<br>
are known and thus are not further discussed.<br>
[77] Fig. 8 is a signal flowchart illustrating, as an example, a procedure of<br>
placing an incoming call after selecting a domain by taking user preferences<br>
or operator policy into account, depending on precedence information in<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[78] As illustrated in Fig. 8, a series of steps (i.e., S 11 to S 14 in Fig. 8) for<br>
transmitting by a UE the user preferences including the user-preferred<br>
domain selection information for incoming calls, to a VCC application are<br>
the same as the series of steps in Fig. 6 (S 11 to S 14). Therefore, the detailed<br>
explanation of the series of steps in Fig. 6 (i.e., Sll to S 14) can be equally<br>
applied to the series of steps in Fig. 8 (i.e., S 11 to S 14).<br>
[79] After completing steps S 11 to S 14, a series of steps (S 15 to S 19) are<br>
executed when an incoming call is routed to the home network. When a call<br>
is requested (e.g., steps S15-S17), the VCC application 20 selects a domain<br>
(e.g., either the CS domain or the IMS domain) for the incoming call by<br>
taking the user preferences (including the user- preferred domain selection<br>
information) orthe operator policy (including the network- preferred domain<br>
selection information) into account (S 18). As an example, if the operator<br>
policy is preset to have higher priority than the user preferences, the VCC<br>
application 20 can make a domain selection for incoming calls by using (or<br>
referring, or retrieving) the operator policy when selecting the domain for the<br>
incoming calls toward the UE 10. On the other hand, if the user preferences<br>
is preset to have higher priority than the operator policy, the VCC application<br>
20 can make a domain selection for incoming calls by using (or referring, or<br><br>
retrieving) the user preferences when selecting the domain for the incoming<br>
calls toward the UE 10. Also, the domain selection for incoming calls can be<br>
executed by the DSF of the VCC application 20.<br>
[80] Once the domain has been selected, the VCC application 20 transmits<br>
the incoming call over the selected domain using known techniques. For<br>
instance, if the CS domain is selected, the incoming call over the CS domain<br>
is placed according to the series of sub-steps 10-19 of step S90 in Fig. 8. If<br>
the IMS domain is selected, the incoming call over the IMS domain is placed<br>
according to the series of sub-steps 10'-18' of step S92 in Fig. 8.<br>
[81] Hereinafter, constructions and operations of the UE (i.e., terminal) and<br>
the VCC application according to the present invention will now be<br>
explained.<br>
[82] The UE and the VCC application according to the present invention may<br>
basically include hardware construction which is required for<br>
intercommunications in order to set or update user preferences and operator<br>
policy.<br>
[83] For instance, as shown in Fig. 9, the UE 10 according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention may comprise a transmitter 41 for transmitting the<br>
domain selection information related to incoming calls, namely, the user<br>
preferences to a VCC application, a memory or storage unit 42 for storing<br>
the user preferences, the operator-policy received from the VCC application,<br>
and other information, a receiver 43 for receiving (terminating) incoming<br>
calls which the VCC application transmits by taking the user preferences or<br>
operator policy into account, an input unit 44 for receiving a user's input such<br>
as a user's preferences, a display unit 45 for displaying information, menus,<br>
etc., and a controller/processor 46 for controlling these components. The UE<br>
may also include other known components such as aUt interface unit 47, a<br>
DM unit 48, etc. The controller 46 can determine which domain selection<br>
information of user preferences and operator policy to select domain of<br><br>
ongoing calls, by checking (detecting) which one of user preferences and<br>
operator policy is preset to have higher priority than the other.<br>
[84] Also, the UE according to an embodiment of the present invention may<br>
comprise the receiver 43 for receiving the operator policy from the VCC<br>
application, a selection unit for selecting a domain for outgoing calls based<br>
upon the operator policy or the user preferences, and the transmitter 41 for<br>
transmitting (originating) the outgoing calls over the selected domain. Here,<br>
the selection unit can be the controller 46 which can be a type of controller<br>
for selecting the domain for the outgoing calls. As aforementioned,<br>
operations and functions of each component of the UE including technical<br>
characteristics of the present invention have been explained. Besides,<br>
components of the UE which are basically required to receive the VCC<br>
service can be obvious to those skilled in the art, explanation of which will<br>
thusly not be repeated. .<br>
[85] As described above, for incoming calls in the present invention, since a<br>
network (i.e., VCC application) can recognize information related to<br>
selecting a domain that a UE user prefers to use based upon user preferences,<br>
the network can effectively place incoming calls over the domain which can<br>
be selected by taking into account the current communication circumstances<br>
of the UE.<br>
. [86] Also, for outgoing calls in the-present invention, since the UE can<br>
recognize domain selection information based upon operator policy, the<br>
information on the current communication circumstances of the network can<br>
be taken into account when the UE selects a domain for the outgoing call.<br>
[87] In addition, as described above, since the user preferences or the<br>
operator policy are taken into account to select a domain and incoming<br>
and/or outgoing calls are placed over the selected domain, calls can<br>
effectively be placed in a VCC which takes into account the current<br>
communication circumstances of the UE and/or network.<br><br>
Therefore, the present invention effectively prevents a frequent domain<br>
transfer, which may unnecessarily be caused by placing calls in a VCC<br>
without taking into account the current communication circumstances of the<br>
UE and network, a lack of resources or a call inconsistency.<br>
[88] The present invention has been explained with reference to<br>
embodiments illustrated in the drawings, which, however, are just exemplary.<br>
It will also be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications<br>
and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from<br>
the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present<br>
invention cover modifications and variations of this invention provided they<br>
come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.<br><br>

information for storage in the storage unit,<br>
wherein the terminal supports voice call continuity (VCC) that is a<br>
home Internet Protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS) application capable of<br>
transporting voice calls between a circuit-switched (CS) domain and an IP<br>
multimedia subsystem (IMS) domain,<br>
wherein the controller selects either the circuit switched (CS) domain or<br><br>
the IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) domain for the outgoing call based on<br>
the domain selection information of the operator policy information or the<br>
user preference information, and<br>
wherein the controller selects either the circuit switched (CS) domain or<br>
the IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) domain for the outgoing call based on<br>
the domain selection information of the user preference information, if the<br>
user preference information has a higher priority than the operator policy<br>
information, or<br>
wherein the controller selects either the circuit switched (CS) domain or<br>

transmits a query regarding a network's preference of a domain to a voice<br>
call continuity (VCC) application server, and receives the operator policy<br>
information including the domain selection information from the VCC<br>
application server for storage in the terminal.<br><br><br><br>
ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
METHOD FOR PROVIDING AN INCOMING/OUTGOING CALL IN<br>
VOICE CALL CONTINUITY SERVICE AND TERMINAL AND SERVER<br>
THEREOF<br>
A method, server and terminal for providing a Voice Call Continuity<br>
(VCC) service, are discussed. According to an embodiment, the terminal<br>
includes a storage unit (42) to store operator policy information and user<br>
preference information, the user preference information including domain<br>
selection information specifying a user-preferred domain to be used when<br>
originating the outgoing call from the terminal, the operator policy<br>
information including domain selection information specifying a network-<br>
preferred domain to be used when originating the outgoing call from the<br>
terminal; and a controller (46) to perform a domain selection for the outgoing<br>
call based on the user preference information or the operator policy<br>
information.</td>
