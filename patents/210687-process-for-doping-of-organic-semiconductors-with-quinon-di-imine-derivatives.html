The following specification	particularly describes the<br>
invention  and  the  manner	in  which  it  is    to  be<br>
performed : 	GRANTED<br><br>
ORIGINAL <br>
382/MUM/2004<br><br>

The invention relates to the use of an organic mesomeric compound as organic dopant for doping of an organic, semiconductor matrix material for changing its electrical properties, a doped semiconductor matrix material and an electronic component manufactured from such a material.<br>
Since a couple of decades the doping of silicon semiconductors is standard of technology. According to this technology, by generating electrical charge carriers in the material, an increase in the initial quite low conductivity and - depending on the type of dopant used - a change in the Fermi level of the semiconductor is achieved.<br>
Since a couple of years it has become known that one can heavily influence organic semiconductors by doping with respect to their electrical conductivity. Such organic semiconductor matrix materials can be built-up either from compounds having good electron donator properties or from compounds having good electron receiver properties. For doping of electron donator materials strong electron accepters such as Tetra-cyano-quinon-di-methan (TCNQ) OR 2, 3, 5, 6-Tetrafluoro-tetracyano-1, 4-benzo-quinon-dimethan (F4TCNQ) have become known. M.Pfeiffer, A. Beyer, T. Fritz, K. Leo, Appl. Phys. Lett., 73 (22), 3202-3204 (1998), und J. Blochwitz, M. Pfeiffer, T. Fritz, K. Leo, Appl. Phys. Lett.. 73 (6), 729-731 (1998). These generate through electron transfer processes in electron donator type base material (hole transport materials) so-called holes, through their number and mobility the conductivity of the base material changes more or less significantly. As matrix materials with hole transport properties, N, N' perarylized benzidine TPD or N, N' ,N" perarylized start burst compounds like the substance TDATA, or certain metal phthalocyanrnes, especially like zinc phthalocyanine ZnPc are known.<br>
However, the compounds investigated so far have - for a technical application -disadvantages in the production of doped semiconductor organic layers or suitable electronic components with that kind of doped layers, since the production processes in the mass production plants or in the technical standard cannot be controlled to sufficiently precise degree, which leads to high control and regulating effort within the processes, in order to achieve a desired product quality, or to<br>
2<br><br>
undesirable tolerances of the products. Further there are disadvantages in using presently known organic dopants with respect to electronic component structures like LEDs, field effect transistors (FET) or solar cell themselves, because the said production difficulties while handling the dopants can lead to undesired non-uniformity in the electronic components or undesired aging effects of the electronic components. However, simultaneously it should be considered that the dopants to be used show suitable affinity towards electrons and other properties suitable for the application case, because, for example, the dopants - under given conditions -also co-determine the conductivity or other electrical properties of the organic semiconductor layer.<br>
Therefore, the task of the invention is to provide organic dopants for doping of organic semiconductors, which can be easily handled in the production and which lead to electronic components, whose organic semiconductor materials are reproducible.<br>
In the invention this task is resolved by using an organic mesomeric compound as organic dopant, which is a quinone or quinone derivative, especially an un-substituted, substituted or anelled quinone or quinone derivative or a 1, 3, 2-dioxaborin or 1,3, 2-dioxaborin derivative, especially an un-substituted, substituted or anelled 1, 3, 2-dioxaborin or 1, 3, 2-dioxaborin derivative and which has under the same evaporation conditions a lower volatility than tetrafluro-tetracyano-quinone-dimethane (F4TCNQ). As quinone derivative in the sense of the invention especially those quinonoide systems are to be understood, in which one. two or more quinonoide oxygen atom(s) is/are replaced by a mesomeric and / or inductive electron drawing, double bonded substitutes, especially by such a substitute given further below. Those rests are to be understood as inductive electron drawing, which show vis-a-vis carbon an 1-effect especially against unsaturated hydrocarbon. Through the higher evaporation temperature or lower volatility under the same conditions the production processes can be better controlled and thus can be conducted with lesser effort and in reproducible manner, wherein through the provision of quinones or their derivatives or 1, 3, 2-dioxaborines or their derivatives as dopants ensure in the respective component - at<br><br><br>
lower diffusion coefficient - component structures uniform overtime, and facilitate a sufficient electrical conductivity of organic semiconductor matrix at favorable electron affinity of dopants. Further, through the dopants charge carrier injection of contacts in the doped layer can be improved. Further, the doped organic semiconductor material or the resultant electronic component can show an improved long term stability based on the compounds used in the invention. This refers, for example, to a reduction in the dopant concentration over time. Further, this refers to the stability of doped layer, which is arranged in the neighborhood of un-doped layers of an electro-optical component, so that this results in to electro-optic components with increased long term stability of electro-optical properties such as luminosity factor in case of a given wavelength, efficiency of a solar cell etc.<br>
Preferred further developments result from the following sub-claims.<br>
The volatility can be determined here as the evaporation rate or as vaporization of a substrate measured as layer thickness growth per time unit (nm/s) under otherwise same conditions (for example, a pressure of 2 x 10-4 Pa and given evaporation temperature, for example 150°C). Preferably, the volatility of compounds according to the invention is the 
Through the vaporization rate of the substrate with the compounds according to the invention - for example - by using a quartz thickness monitor, it can be determined how it can be usually deployed in the production of OLEDs. Especially, the ratio of vaporization rates of matrix materials and dopants can be measured through independent readings of the same by using two separate quartz thickness monitors, in order to adjust the doping ratio.<br>
The volatility relative to that of F4TCNQ can be based on the pure compound or on the volatility from a given matrix material, for example ZnPc. It is understood that the compounds used in accordance to the invention are preferably finished in such a way that these evaporate more or less or practically un-decomposed. However, under the circumstances targeted precursors can be deployed as dopant source, which releases the compounds used according to the<br><br><br>
invention, for example acid additive salts, for example, of a volatile or non-volatile inorganic or organic acid, or charge transfer complexes of the same, wherein the acids or electron dopants are preferably non-volatile or only marginally volatile or wherein the charge transfer complex itself acts as dopant.<br>
Preferably the dopant is selected in such a manner that it generates - under the otherwise same conditions like especially doping concentration - (mol. Ratio dopant : matrix, layer thickness, current strength) precisely same as or preferably higher conductivity than F4TCNQ with the given matrix material (for example Zinc phtalo cyanine or any other matrix material mentioned further below), for example, a conductivity (S/cm) greater than / equal to 1.1-times, 1.2-times or greater than / equal to 1.5-times or two times that of F4TCNQ as dopant.<br>
Preferably the dopant used according to the invention is selected in such a way that the semi-conductor, organic matrix material doped with this - after a change of temperature from 100°C to room temperature (20°C) - still shows &gt; 20%, preferably &gt; 30%, especially preferred &gt; 50% or 60% of conductivity (S/cm) of the value at 100°C.<br>

least two, several or all of Quinoide rings can be anelled with each other under mesomeric link to a larger Quinoide system or can be linked mesomeric through one or several bridges or can be linked under not forming a larger mesomeric system. The compound can be especially selected from the group of compounds 1-33, without restricting itself to this. The Quinoide system can be especially selected from the group of compounds 1-33, without being restricted itself to this. One, two, three or more or all the aromatic rings can be selected by a group-Ml-C- (R) =C (R) -M2- or-Ml-C (=z) -M2-with Ml, M2 equal and / or un-equal and from the group ~0-, -S-, -NR-,<br>
The substitutes A, B, K, D, E, F, G; H of compounds 14 and 15 can be different or even equal and can assume following structures, Imin-nitrogen =N-, phosphine =P-0- of the substituted methylene carbon =C-R19.<br>

The residue R1 to R32 (which are bonded with a Quinoide or aromatic system of a compound used according to the invention and which are arranged next to each<br><br>
other and which are separated through two, three or four atoms of Quinoide or aromatic structure) can be bonded with each other with the build-up of a carbocyclic. especially aromatic rings, or heterocyclic, especially hetero carbocyclic ring. This is applicable especially for the compounds 1 to 33, however, also for other quinones or quinone derivatives used according to the invention. Each of this applies, for example, pair-wise alternative or simultaneously for the residues Rl, R2 and / or R3, R4 of the compounds 1, 3. 3b, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, the residues Rl, R2; R2, R3; R4, R5 and / or R5, R6 of the compound 2, the residues Rl, R2; R3, R4; R5, R6; R7, R8 of the<br>

Each two neighboring residues of R1 - R32 can be bonded with each other through a carboxy- - (CO) - or a carbimide group - (CNR) -, wherein for this R the analogue substitution sample is valid like for R1 - R30, It is, however, also possible that two neighboring residues R are linked with each other in such a way through carbon atoms or hetero atoms, that a new carbocyclic or heterocyclic structure element is<br><br>
condensed on the respective cyclic base structure. For example, in the compound type 1 the residues R1 and R2 as well as R3 and R4an mean condensed benzo residue or naputuo residue, but these can also stand for a condensed thiophen-, furan-, 1,3,4- oxidazol-, pyridine-, pyrazin-, triazin-, tetrazin-, pyran-, thiopyran-, dithiin-, phosporin-, phthalic acid anhydride, phthalic acid imide or dithiazol residue, wherein these residues intern can be substituted exclusively or partially through other electron attracting groupings like halogen, under this preferably, fluor or chlor, trifluormethyle or cyan, nitro, nitroso, sulfo, carboxy, carbalkoxy, halogen-carbonyle, carbamoyl, forrnyl, amidinformyle.

The aromatic residues with which the Quinoide systems can be substituted and / or anelled, can be perhalogenized, especially perfluorized, perchlorated or perfluorochlorated. If necessary, some of the halogen atoms, for example, up to half or more can be substituted through hydrogen.<br>
