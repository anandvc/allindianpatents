				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
AROMATIC AMINE DERIVATIVE AND ORGANIC ELECTROLUMINESCENT ELEMENT MADE WITH THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to organic electroluminescent devices which are used as a surface light-emitting member of wall-type televisions or a light source such as a backlight for displays, and exhibit a long service life and a high efficiency of light emission, as well as novel aromatic amine derivatives capable of realizing such electroluminescent devices.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Organic electroluminescent (EL) devices which utilize organic substances are expected to be useful for application as an inexpensive full color display device of the solid light emission type having a great size and various developments on the organic EL devices are being conducted. In general, an organic EL device has a construction comprising a light emitting layer and a pair of electrodes sandwiching the light emitting layer. The light emission of the organic EL device is a phenomenon in which, when an electric field is applied between the two electrodes, electrons are injected from the cathode side and holes are injected from the anode side, the electrons are recombined with the holes in the light emitting layer to form an excited state, and energy generated when the excited state returns to the ground state is emitted as light.<br>
As compared with an inorganic light emitting diode, conventional organic EL devices requires high driving voltage and only exhibited low luminance or low efficiency of light emission. Moreover, characteristic degradation of the conventional organic EL devices was also extravagant and as a result, they were not practically used. Although recent organic EL devices<br><br>
are improved step by steps, it has been still demanded to develop organic EL devices operable at low driving voltage, with excellent luminance and favorable<br>
efficiency of light emission.<br>
For example, there is disclosed such a technique using a single<br>
monoanthracene compound as an organic light-emitting material (Japanese<br>
Unexamined Patent Application Laid-Open No. Hei 11-3782A).   However, in<br>
this technique, a luminance obtained by using the material is as low as 1650<br>
cd/m2, for example, at a current density of 165 mA/cm2, and an efficiency of<br>
light emission thereof is very low, i.e., only 1 cd/A, which is practically<br>
unusable.   Also, there is disclosed a technique using a single bisanthracene<br>
compound as an organic light emitting material (Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application Laid-Open No. Hei 8-12600).   However, in this technique, an<br>
efficiency of light emission obtained by using the material is also as low as<br>
about 1 to 3 cd/A.   Therefore, further improvement of the technique has bee<br>
demanded for rendering it practically usable.   Further, there is disclosed a<br>
technique using a mono- or bis-anthracene compound together with a distearyl<br>
compound in an organic light emitting medium layer (International<br>
Application Published under PCT No. WO 00/06402).   However, the device<br>
described therein fails to show a sufficiently long half lifetime and, therefore,<br>
further improvement has been demanded therefor.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made to solve the above problems.   An object of the present invention is to provide organic EL devices having a long service life and a high efficiency of light emission, and aromatic amine derivatives capable of realizing such organic EL devices.<br>
As a result of extensive researches for developing aromatic amine derivatives having the above suitable properties and organic EL devices using the aromatic amine derivatives, the inventors have found that the object of the present invention can be achieved by using aromatic amine derivatives represented by any one of the following general formulae (I) to (III) and (D to (III1) in which a substituted diphenyl amino group is bonded to a pyrene<br><br>
structure.    The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of the above finding.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides an aromatic amine derivative<br>

In the general formulae (I) to (III) and (D to (IlD, m and n are each an integer of 0 to 5 and preferably 0 to 2.<br>

Among the aromatic amine derivatives represented by the general formula (I), especially preferred are those represented by the general formulae (II) and (III).   Among the aromatic amine derivatives represented by the general formula GO, especially preferred are those represented by the general formulae (ID and (IIIO.<br>
Specific examples of the aromatic amine derivatives represented by the general formulae (I) to (III) and GO to (IIIO include compounds (l) to (69) enumerated below, though not particularly limited thereto.    Meanwhile, in the following compounds, Me represents a methyl group.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
In the aromatic amine derivative represented by any of the general formulae (I) to (III) and (D to (III1), since the diphenylamino group having a substituent group is bonded to the pyrene structure, the association between the compounds is prevented, resulting in a prolonged life thereof.    Further, the aromatic amine derivatives have a strong fluorescence in a solid state, and are excellent in field light emission, which leads to a fluorescent quantum efficiency as high as 0.3 or more.   In addition, the aromatic amine derivatives of the present invention exhibit not only excellent capabilities of injecting and transporting holes from the metal electrode or organic thin film layers, but also excellent capabilities of injecting and transporting electrons from the metal electrode or organic thin film layers and, therefore, are usefully usable as light emitting materials for organic EL devices.   Besides, the aromatic amine derivatives of the present invention may be used together with other hole transporting materials, electron transporting materials or doping materials.<br>
The organic EL device of the present invention includes an anode, a cathode, and one or plural organic thin film layers.    In the case of one layer type, a light emitting layer as the organic thin film layer is provided between the anode and cathode.   The light emitting layer contains the light emitting material and may further contain a hole injecting material and an electron injecting material in order to effectively transport holes injected from the anode or electrons injected from the cathode to the light emitting material. The aromatic amine derivatives represented by the general formulae (I) to (III) and (D to (III") have a high light emitting property and excellent hole injectability and hole transportability as well as excellent electron injectability and electron transportability and, therefore, can be used as a light emitting material in the light emitting layer.<br>
In the organic EL device of the present invention, the light emitting layer contains the aromatic amine derivative of the present invention in an amount of preferably 0.1 to 20% by weight and more preferably 1 to 10% by weight.    Further, the aromatic amine derivatives of the present invention which are represented by the general formulae (I) to (III) and (D to (IIP) exhibit not only an extremely high fluorescent quantum efficiency but also<br><br>
high hole transportability and electron transportability, and further are capable of forming a uniform thin film, so that the light emitting layer may be formed from the aromatic amine derivatives only.<br>
On the other hand, in the case where the organic EL device of the present invention includes two or more organic thin film layers having at least the light emitting layer which are sandwiched between the cathode and anode, the organic thin film layers preferably include an organic layer containing the aromatic amine derivative represented by any of the general formulae (I) to (III) and (D to (III1) as a main component which is provided between the anode and the light emitting layer.    Such an organic layer may be a hole injecting layer, a hole transporting layer, etc.<br>
Examples of the organic EL device of a multilayer type include those having multilayer structures such as (an anode/a hole injecting layer/a light emitting layer/a cathode), (an anode/a light emitting layer/an electron injecting layer/a cathode) and (an anode/a hole injecting layer /a light emitting layer/an electron injecting layer/a cathode).<br>
The light emitting layer may also optionally contain, in addition to the aromatic amine derivatives of the present invention, conventionally known materials such as light emitting materials, doping materials, hole injecting materials and electron injecting materials according to requirements.    The organic EL device having such a multilayer structure can be prevented from suffering from deterioration in luminance and service life due to quenching. If required, the light emitting materials, doping materials, hole injecting materials and electron injecting materials may be used in combination with each other.    The use of the doping materials enables the resultant device to be improved in luminance of light emitted and efficiency of light emission, and further emit a red color light or a blue color light.    Further, in the organic EL device of the present invention, the hole injecting layer, the light emitting layer and the electron injecting layer may respectively have a multilayer structure including two or more layers.   In this case, the multi-layer hole injecting layer may include a hole injecting layer into which holes are injected from the electrode, and a hole transporting layer for accepting the holes from<br><br>
the hole injecting layer and transporting the holes to the light emitting layer. Also, the multi-layer electron injecting layer may include an electron injecting layer into which electrons are injected from the electrode, and an electron transporting layer for accepting the electrons from the electron injecting layer and transporting the electrons to the light emitting layer.    These respective layers may be selectively used according to various factors such as energy level of the materials used, heat resistance, and adhesion to the organic thin film layers or the metal electrodes.<br>
Examples of the light emitting material or doping material that is usable in the light emitting layer together with any of the aromatic amine derivatives represented by the above general formulae (I) to (III) and (I1) to (III1) according to the present invention include anthracene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, pyrene, tetracene, coronene, chrysene, fluoresceine, perylene, phthaloperylene, naphthaloperylene, perynone, phthaloperynone, naphthaloperynone, diphenyl butadiene, tetraphenyl butadiene, coumarin, oxadiazole, aldazine, bisbenzoxazoline, bisstyryl, pyrazine, cyclopentadiene, quinoline metal complexes, aminoquinoline metal complexes, benzoquinoline metal complexes, imines, diphenyl ethylene, vinyl anthracene, diaminocarbazole, pyrane, thiopyrane, polymethine, merocyanine, imidazole-chelated oxinoid compounds, quinacridone, rubrene and fluorescent dyes, though not particularly limited thereto.<br>
The hole injecting material is preferably made of compounds which have a good hole transportability as well as excellent capabilities of accepting holes injected from the anode and injecting the holes into the light emitting layer or light emitting material, prevent excited particles produced in the light emitting layer from moving into the electron injecting layer or electron injecting material, and exhibit an excellent capability of forming a thin film. Specific examples of the hole injecting material include phthalocyanine derivatives, naphthalocyanine derivatives, porphyrin derivatives, oxazole, oxadiazole, triazole, imidazole, imidazolone, imidazole thione, pyrazoline, pyrazolone, tetrahydroimidazole, hydrazone, acyl hydrazone, polyaryl alkanes, stilbene, butadiene, benzidine-type triphenyl amine, styryl amine-type<br><br>
triphenyl amine, diamine-type triphenyl amine and derivatives thereof, as well as polyvinyl carbazoles, polysilanes, and high molecular materials such as conductive polymers, though not particularly limited thereto.<br>

Examples of the additives include antioxidants, ultraviolet<br>
10     absorbers and plasticizers.<br>
As described above, by using the aromatic amine derivative of the present invention in organic thin film layers of the organic EL device, the obtained organic EL device can exhibit a long life and a high efficiency of light emission.<br>
15	The organic EL device of the present invention is suitably applied to, for<br>
example, surface light-emitting members such as a wall-type TV flat panel displays, light sources for copiers, printers, back light for liquid crystal displays and, measuring equipments, display panels, marker light, etc. Further, the material of the present invention can be used not only for organic<br>
20     EL devices but also in other applications such as electrophotographic members, photoelectric converters, solar cells, image sensors, etc.<br>
