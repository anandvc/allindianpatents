				<td>The present invention relates to a quinazoline derivative of the formula I and process for preparation thereof.<br>
The present invention relates to quinazoline derivatives, processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them as active ingredient, methods for the treatment of disease states associated with angiogenesis and/or increased vascular . permeability and to their use in the manufacture of medicaments for use in the production'of antiangiogenic and/or vascular permeability reducing effects in warm-blooded animals such as humans,<br>
Normal angiogenesis plays an important role in a variety of processes including embryonic development, wound healing and several components of female reproductive function. Undesirable or pathological angiogenesis has been associated with disease states including diabetic retinopathy, psoriasis, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, atheroma, Kaposi's sarcoma and haemangioma (Fan et al, 1995, Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 16: 57-66; Folkman, 1995, Nature Medicine 1:27-31). Alteration of vascular permeability is thought to play a role in both normal and pathological physiological processes (Cullman-Bove et 'al, 1993, Endocrinology 133: 829-837; Senger et al, 1993, Cancer and Metastasis Reviews, 12: 303-. 324), Several polypeptides with in vitro endothelial cell growth promoting activity have been identified including, acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors (aFGF &amp; bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). By virtue of the restricted expression of its receptors, the growth factor activity of VEGF, in contrast to that of the FGFs, is relatively specific towards endothelial cells. Recent evidence indicates that VEGF is an important stimulator of both normal and pathological angiogenesis (Jakeman et al, 1993, Endocrinology, 133: 848-859;' Kolch et al, 1995, Breast Cancer Research and Treatment, 36:139-155) and vascular permeability (Connolly et al, 1989, J. Biol. Chem. 264: 20017-20024). Antagonism of VEGF action by sequestration of VEGF with antibody can result in inhibition of tumour growth (Kim et al, 1993, Nature 362: 841-844).<br>
Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are important in the transmission of biochemical signals across the plasma membrane of cells. These transmembrane molecules characteristically consist of an extracellular ligand-binding domain connected through a segment in the plasma membrane to an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Binding of ligand to the receptor results in stimulation of the receptor-associated tyrosine kinase activity which leads to phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on both the receptor and other<br><br>
intracellular molecules. These changes in tyrosine phosphorylation initiate a signalling<br>
cascade leading to a variety of cellular responses. To date, at least nineteen distinct RTK<br>
subfamilies, defined by amino acid sequence homology, have been identified. One of these<br>
subfamilies is presently comprised by the fins-like tyrosine kinase receptor, Fit or Fltl, the<br>
kinase insert domain-containing receptor, KDR (also referred to as Flk-1), and another<br>
fins-like tyrosine kinase receptor, Flt4. Two of these related RTKs, Fit and KDR, have been<br>
shown to bind VEGF with high affinity (De Vries et al, 1992, Science 255: 989-991; Terman<br>
etal, 1992, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1992, 187: 1579-1586). Binding of VEGF to<br>
these receptors expressed in heterologous cells has been associated with changes in the<br>
tyrosine phosphorylation status of cellular proteins and calcium fluxes.<br>
Compounds which have good activity against epidermal growth factor (EGF)<br>
receptor tyrosine kinase'are disclosed in the European Patent No. 0566226.' The present<br>
invention is based on the discovery of compounds that surprisingly inhibit the effects of<br>
VEGF, a property of value in the treatment of disease states associated with angiogenesis<br>
and/or increased vascular permeability such as cancer, diabetes, psoriasis, rheumatoid<br>
arthritis, Kaposi's sarcoma, haemangioma, acute and chronic nephropathies, atheroma, arterial<br>
restenosis, autoimmune diseases, acute inflammation and ocular diseases with retinal vessel<br>
proliferation. Compounds of the present invention possess higher potency against VEGF<br>
receptor tyrosine kinase than against EGF receptor tyrosine kinase. Furthermore, compounds<br>
of the present invention, possess substantially higher potency against VEGF receptor tyrosine<br>
kinase than against EGF receptor tyrosine kinase or FGF Rl receptor tyrosine kinase. Thus<br>
compounds of the invention which have been tested possess activity against VEGF receptor<br>
tyrosine kinase such that they may be used in an amount sufficient to inhibit VEGF receptor<br>
tyrosine kinase whilst demonstrating no significant activity against EGF receptor tyrosine<br>
kinase or FGF Rl receptor tyrosine kinase.<br>

Within the present invention it is to be understood that a quinazoline of the formula I or a salt thereof may exhibit the phenomenon of tautomerism and that the formulae drawings within this specification can represent only one of the possible tautomeric forms. It is to be understood that the invention encompasses any tautomeric form which inhibits VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity and is not to be limited merely to any one tautomeric form utilised within the formulae drawings.<br>
It is also to be understood that certain quinazolines of the formula I and salts thereof can exist in solvated as well as unsolvated forms such as, for example, hydrated forms. It is to be understood that the invention encompasses all such solvated forms which inhibit VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity.<br>
For the avoidance of any doubt, it is to be understood that when Y is, for example, a group of formula -NR5CO-, it is the nitrogen atom bearing the R5 group which is attached to the quinazoline ring and the carbonyl (CO) group is attached to R4, whereas when Y1 is, for example, a group of formula -CONR -, it is the carbonyl group which is attached to the quinazoline ring and the nitrogen atom bearing the R group is attached to R .

For the avoidance of any doubt, it is to be understood that when X1 carries a C,. 4aminoalkyl substituent it is the CMalkyl moiety which is attached to X1 whereas when X1 carries a C1.4alkylamino substituent it is the amino moiety which is attached to X and an analogous convention applies to other groups.<br>
The present invention relates to the compounds of formula I as hereinbefore defined as well as to the salts thereof. Salts for use in pharmaceutical compositions will be pharmaceutically acceptable salts, but other salts may be useful in the production of the compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the invention may, for example, include acid addition salts of the compounds of formula I as hereinbefore defined which are sufficiently basic to form such salts. Such acid addition salts include for example salts with inorganic acids such as with hydrogen halides (especially hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid of which hydrochloric acid is particularly preferred) or with sulphuric or phosphoric acid as well as salts with organic acids affording pharmaceutically acceptable anions, such as for example trifluoroacetic, citric or maleic acid. In addition where the compounds of formula I are sufficiently acidic, pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be formed with an inorganic substance or organic base which affords a pharmaceutically acceptable cation. Such salts include for example an alkali metal salt, such as a sodium or potassium salt, an alkaline earth metal salt such as a calcium or magnesium salt, an ammonium salt or for example a salt with methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, piperidine, morpholine or tris-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine.<br><br>

(a) Compounds of the formula I and salts thereof may be prepared by the reaction of a compound of the formula III:<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
 (wherein R , R , R4 and Y1 are as defined hereinbefore and L1 is a displaceable group), with a compound of the formula IV:<br>

The reaction is advantageously effected in the presence of either an acid or a base. Such an acid is, for example, an anhydrous inorganic acid such as hydrogen chloride. Such a base is, for example, an organic amine base such as, for example, pyridine, 2,6-lutidine, collidine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, triethylamine, morpholine, N-methylmorpholine or diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, or for example, an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal carbonate or hydroxide, for example sodiuni carbonate, potassium carbonate, calcium carbonate, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. Alternatively such a base is, for example, an alkali metal hydride, for example sodium hydride, or an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal amide, for example sodium amide or sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide. The reaction is preferably effected in the presence of an inert solvent or diluent, for example an alkanol or ester such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol or ethyl acetate, a halogenated solvent such as methylene chloride, trichloromethane or carbon tetrachloride, an ether such as tetrahydrofuran or 1,4-dioxan, an aromatic solvent such as toluene, or a dipolar aprotic solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one or dimethylsulphoxide. The reaction is conveniently effected at a temperature in the range, for example, 10 to 150°C, preferably in the range 20 to 80°C.<br>
The compound of the invention may be obtained from this process in the form of the free base or alternatively it may be obtained in the form of a salt with the acid of the formula H-L1 wherein L1 has the meaning defined hereinbefore. When it is desired to obtain the free base from the salt, the salt may be treated with a base as defined hereinbefore using a conventional procedure.<br>

The identification of compounds which potently inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity associated with the VEGF receptors such as Fit and/or KDR and which inhibit angiogenesis and/or increased vascular permeability is desirable and is the subject of the present invention. These properties may be assessed, for example, using one or more of the procedures set out below: (a) In Vitro Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibition Test<br>
This assay determines the ability of a test compound to inhibit tyrosine kinase activity. DNA encoding VEGF or epidermal growth factor (EOF) receptor cytoplasmic domains may be obtained by total gene synthesis (Edwards M, International Biotechnology Lab 5(3), 19-25, 1987) or by cloning. These may then be expressed in a suitable expression system to obtain polypeptide with tyrosine kinase activity. For example VEGF and EGF<br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br>
cytoplasmic domains, which were obtained by expression of recombinant protein in insect cells, were found to display intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. In the case of the VEGF receptor Fit (Genbank accession number X51602), a 1.7kb DNA fragment encoding most of the cytoplasmic domain, commencing with methionine 783 and including the termination codon, described by Shibuya et al (Oncogene, 1990, 5: 519-524), was isolated from cDNA and cloned into a baculovirus transplacement vector (for example pAcYMl (see The Baculovirus Expression System: A Laboratory Guide, L.A. King and R. D. Possee, Chapman and Hall, 1992) or pAc360 or pBlueBacHis (available from Invitrogen Corporation)). This recombinant construct was co-transfected into insect cells (for example Spodoptera frugiperda 21(Sf21)) with viral DNA (eg Pharmingen BaculoGold) to prepare recombinant baculovirus. (Details of the methods for the assembly of recombinant DNA molecules and the preparation and use of recombinant baculovirus can be found in standard texts for example Sambrook et al, 1989, Molecular cloning - A Laboratory Manual, 2nd edition, Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press and O'Reilly et al, 1992, Baculovirus Expression Vectors - A Laboratory Manual, W. H. Freeman and Co, New York). For other tyrosine kinases for use in assays, cytoplasmic fragments starting from methionine 806 (KDR, Genbank accession number L04947) and methionine 668 (EGF receptor, Genbank accession number X00588) may be cloned and expressed in a similar manner.<br>
For expression of cFlt tyrosine kinase activity, Sf21 cells were infected with plaque-pure cFlt recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 3 and harvested 48 hours later. Harvested cells were washed with ice cold phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) (lOmM sodium phosphate pH7.4, 138mM NaCl, 2.7mM KC1) then resuspended in ice cold HNTG/PMSF (20mM Hepes pH7.5, 150mM NaCl, 10% v/v glycerol, 1% v/v Triton X100, 1.5mM MgCl2, ImM ethylene glycol-bis(paminoethyl ether) N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), ImM PMSF (phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride); the PMSF is added just before use from a freshly-prepared lOOmM solution in methanol) using 1ml HNTG/PMSF per 10 million cells. The suspension was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 13,000 rpm at 4°C, the supernatant (enzyme stock) was removed and stored in aliquots at -70°C. Each new batch of stock enzyme was titrated in the assay by dilution with enzyme diluent (lOOmM Hepes pH 7.4, 0.2mM Na3VO4, 0.1% v/v Triton X100, 0.2mM dithiothreitol). For a typical batch, stock enzyme is diluted 1 in 2000 with enzyme diluent and 50jal of dilute enzyme is used for each assay well.<br>
A stock of substrate solution was prepared from a random copolymer containing tyrosine, for example Poly (Glu, Ala, Tyr) 6:3:1 (Sigma P3899), stored as 1 mg/ml stock in PBS at -20°C and diluted 1 in 500 with PBS for plate coating.<br>
On the day before the assay lOOul of diluted substrate solution was dispensed into all wells of assay plates (Nunc maxisorp 96-well immunoplates) which were sealed and left overnight at 4°C.<br>
On the day of the assay the substrate solution was discarded and the assay plate wells were washed once with PBST (PBS containing 0.05% v/v Tween 20) and once with 50mM Hepes pH7.4.<br>
Test compounds were diluted with 10% dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) and 25ul of diluted compound was transferred to wells in the washed assay plates. "Total" control wells contained 10% DMSO instead of compound. Twenty five microlitres of 40mM MnCl2 containing 8uM adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) was added to all test wells except "blank" control wells which contained MnCl2 without ATP. To start the reactions 50ul of freshly diluted enzyme was added to each well and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes. The liquid was then discarded and the wells were washed twice with PBST. One hundred microlitres of mouse IgG anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc. product 05-321), diluted 1 in 6000 with PBST containing 0.5% w/v bovine serum albumin (BSA), was added to each well and the plates were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature before discarding the liquid and washing the wells twice with PBST. One hundred microlitres of horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-linked sheep anti-mouse Ig antibody (Amersham product NXA 931), diluted 1 in 500 with PBST containing 0.5% w/v BSA, was added and the plates were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature before discarding the liquid and washing the wells twice with PBST. One hundred microlitres of 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) solution, freshly prepared using one 50mg ABTS tablet (Boehringer 1204 521) in 50ml freshly prepared 50mM phosphate-citrate buffer pHS.O + 0.03% sodium perborate (made with 1 phosphate citrate buffer with sodium perborate (PCSB) capsule (Sigma P4922) per 100ml distilled water), was added to eaeh well. Plates were then incubated for 20-60 minutes at room temperature until the optical density value of the "total" control wells, measured at 405nm using a plate reading spectrophotometer, was approximately 1.0. "Blank" (no ATP) and "total" (no compound) control values were used to determine the dilution range of test compound which gave 50% inhibtion of enzyme activity.<br>
(h) In Vitro HUVEC Proliferation Assay<br>
This assay determines the ability of a test compound to inhibit the growth factor-stimulated proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC).<br>
HUVEC cells were isolated in MCDB 131 (Gibco BRL) + 7.5% v/v foetal calf serum (PCS) and were plated out (at passage 2 to 8), in MCDB 131+ 2% v/v PCS + 3(ig/ml heparin + l^g/ml hydrocortisone, at a concentration of 1000 cells/well in 96 well plates. After a minimum of 4 hours they were dosed with the appropriate growth factor (i.e. VEGF 3ng/ml, EOF 3ng/ml or b-FGF 0.3ng/ml) and compound. The cultures were then incubated for 4 days at 37°C with 7.5% CO2. On day 4 the cultures were pulsed with luCi/well of tritiated-thymidine (Amersham product TRA 61) and incubated for 4 hours. The cells were harvested using a 96-well plate harvester (Tomtek) and then assayed for incorporation of tritium with a Beta plate counter. Incorporation of radioactivity into cells, expressed as cpm was used to measure inhibition of growth factor-stimulated cell proliferation by compounds.<br>
(c) In Vivo Rat Uterine Oedema Assay<br>
This test measures the capacity of compounds to reduce the acute increase in uterine weight in rats which occurs in the first 4-6 hours following oestrogen stimulation. This early increase in uterine weight has long been known to be due to oedema caused by increased permeability of the uterine vasculature and recently Cullinan-Bove and Koos (Endocrinology, 1993,133:829-837) demonstrated a close temporal relationship with increased expression of VEGF mRNA in the uterus. We have found that prior treatment of the rats with a neutralising monoclonal antibody to VEGF significantly reduces the acute increase in uterine weight, confirming that the increase in weight is substantially mediated by VEGF.<br>
Groups of 20 to 22-day old rats were treated with a single subcutaneous dose of oestradiol benzoate (2.5(j.g/rat) in a solvent, or solvent only. The latter served as unstimulated controls. Test compounds were orally administered at various times prior to the administration of oestradiol benzoate. Five hours after the administration of oestradiol benzoate the rats were humanely sacrificed and their uteri were dissected, blotted and weighed. The increase in uterine weight in groups treated with test compound and oestradiol benzoate and with oestradiol benzoate alone was compared using a Student T test. Inhibition of the effect of oestradiol benzoate was considered significant when p
According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a compound of the formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as defined hereinbefore in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier.<br>
The composition may be in a form suitable for oral administration, for example as a tablet or capsule, for parenteral injection (including intraveous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular or infusion) as a sterile solution, suspension or emulsion, for topical administration as an ointment or cream or for rectal administration as a suppository. In general the above compositions may be prepared in a conventional manner using conventional excipients.<br>

The compound will normally be administered to a warm-blooded animal at a unit dose within the range 5-5000 mg per square metre body area of the animal, i.e. approximately 0.1-100 mg/kg. A unit dose in the range, for example, 1-100 mg/kg, preferably 1-50 mg/kg is envisaged and this normally provides a therapeutically-effective dose. A unit dose form such as a tablet or capsule will usually contain, for example 1-250 mg of active ingredient.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a compound of the formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as defined hereinbefore for use in a method of treatment of the human or animal body by therapy.<br>
We have now found that compounds of the present invention inhibit VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity and are therefore of interest for their antiangiogenic effects and/or their ability to cause a reduction in vascular permeability.<br>
Thus according to this aspect of the invention there is provided the use of a compound of the formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in the manufacture of a medicament for use in the production of an antiangiogenic and/or vascular permeability reducing effect in a warm-blooded animal such as a human being.<br>

As stated above the size of the dose required for the therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of a particular disease state will necessarily be varied depending on the host treated, the route of administration and the severity of the illness being treated. Preferably a daily dose in the range of 1-50 mg/kg is employed. However the daily dose will necessarily be varied depending upon the host treated, the particular route of administration, and the severity of the illness being treated. Accordingly the optimum dosage may be determined by the practitioner who is treating any particular patient.<br>
The antiangiogenic and/or vascular permeability reducing treatment defined hereinbefore may be applied as a sole therapy or may involve, in addition to a compound of the invention, one or more other substances and/or treatments.

In the field of medical oncology it is normal practice to use a combination of different forms of treatment to treat each patient with cancer. In medical oncology the other component(s) of such conjoint treatment in addition to the antiangiogenic and/or vascular permeability reducing treatment defined hereinbefore may be: surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Such chemotherapy may cover three main categories of therapeutic agent:<br>
