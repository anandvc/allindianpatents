				<td>The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus<br>
for detecting the wiring phase of an unknown phase voltage<br>
relative to a reference phase voltage in an electrical power<br>
distribution system having a poly phase power line.<br>
Modern power distribution systems use poly phase power lines<br>
for distributing electricity. A poly phase power line<br>
comprises a plurality, typically three, conductors, each<br>
conductor carrying a specified phase voltage. As is well<br>
known, a poly phase power line may or may not have a neutral<br>
conductor which, if present, constitutes an additional<br>
conductor of the poly phase power line. Moreover, in addition<br>
to these conductors of a typical poly phase power line, there<br>
may or may not be a further conductor which carries the<br>
ground potential.<br>
While a poly phase power line offers many advantages for<br>
certain types of loads, e.g. electrical machines employing<br>
rotating magnetic fields, there are many electrical consumers<br>
which are not connected to all the phases available in a<br>
given poly phase power line. For many types of loads it is<br>
sufficient that the load is connected between two of the<br>
phases, or more typical, between one of the available phases<br>
and the neutral conductor. This wiring scheme is widely<br>
spread particularly in the low voltage networks used for<br>
supplying consumer appliances with electricity in the<br>
domestic domain. In Europe, the low voltage power<br>
distribution network has three wiring phases, each at a<br>
voltage of 220 Volt to 240 Volt to neutral, the three phases<br>
being spaced apart at an angle of 120 °. Particularly in the<br><br>
domestic domain, most electrical loads are connected between<br>
one of the three wiring phases R, S, T and the neutral<br>
conductor N, the particular phase R or S or T to which the<br>
load is actually connected, being insignificant for most<br>
types of single phase applications and loads, and therefore<br>
typically unknown.<br>
In some cases it is, however, desirable to detect the phase<br>
to which a given load is connected. For example, in a power<br>
line communication system that uses the existing power line<br>
distribution network for telecommunication purposes, it may<br>
be highly desirable for the transmitter to know the phase<br>
voltage to which the receiver is connected, because it may be<br>
'expected that the communication between the transmitter and<br>
the receiver via a power line is better if the transmitter<br>
and the receiver are connected to the same phase voltage than<br>
if the transmitter and the receiver communicates with each<br>
other across different phases through capacitive or inductive<br>
cross talk between the phases.<br>
In an electricity metering system for metering the electric<br>
energy consumed by a plurality of consumers, there are good<br>
reasons to detect the wiring phase of an electricity meter<br>
located inside or outside of the consumer premises. For<br>
example, the detection of the wiring phase allows to judge<br>
whether a consumer has unlawfully rewired the electricity<br>
meter in order to prevent the meter from correctly measuring<br>
the consumed energy. If the meters communicate with other<br>
nodes in a remote metering system through power line<br>
communication, the knowledge of the phase to which the<br>
respective remote meters at the consumer premises are<br>
connected, is valuable information for optimising the<br>
communication performance of the remote metering system as a<br>
whole.<br>
From US 4,626,622 it is known to identify an unknown phase<br>
within a poly phase network by comparison of the unknown<br><br>
phase with a known reference phase of the poly phase network.<br>
The system comprises a first device connected to the<br>
reference phase and a second device connected to the unknown<br>
phase at another location. The first and second devices each<br>
comprise a modem for establishing a telephone connection<br>
between the two devices. The first device includes circuitry<br>
to produce a digital signal representative of the. alternating<br>
voltage of the reference phase. This representative signal is<br>
transmitted through the two modems and the telephone<br>
connection from the first to the second device. The second<br>
device includes a phase detection circuit for identifying the<br>
unknown phase by detecting the phase angle between the<br>
alternating voltage of the reference phase, and the<br>
alternating voltage of. the unknown phase.<br>
While the method and system known from this document is<br>
suitable to carry out the identification of the unknown phase<br>
when the reference location of known wiring phase at a point<br>
of the poly phase network, e.g. the outlets of a substation<br>
transformer, is far from the location where the phase is<br>
unknown, this method and system has the drawback that a<br>
separate telephone connection between the first and the<br>
second devices is required. In many cases, a separate<br>
telephone connection is not available.<br>
The IEC 61334-5-2 defines a method for identifying an unknown<br>
phase within a poly phase network by means of injecting a<br>
short data packet or time stamp signal into the poly phase<br>
network when a first reference point, e.g. a zero crossing,<br>
occurs in the reference phase voltage. The poly phase network<br>
itself serves to communicate the short data packet or time<br>
stamp signal to the location where the unknown phase has to<br>
be identified. At the location of the unknown phase, the<br>
short data packet or time stamp signal is extracted from the<br>
poly phase power line, and a time interval between the<br>
occurrence of the short data packet or time stamp signal and<br>
a reference point, e.g. a zero crossing in the unknown phase<br><br>
voltage is measured. That time interval is then indicative of<br>
. the phase angle between the reference phase and the unknown<br>
phase. The phase angle thus determined allows to identify the<br>
unknown phase wiring.<br>
While the phase identification method defined in this<br>
standard does not require a separate telephone line between<br>
the location of known phase and the location of unknown<br>
phase, this method suffers from the drawback that power line<br>
communication generally has a limited range only. The<br>
electrical characteristics of power lines are not ideally<br>
suited for transmitting communication signals. Moreover, many<br>
electrical loads connected to power lines tend to generate a<br>
significant noise floor such that already at moderate<br>
distances from the location of the transmitter, the signal to<br>
noise ratio for detecting the short data packet or time stamp<br>
signal becomes unacceptably low. This limits the use of the<br>
phase detection method according to the IEC standard.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention, to<br>
provide a method and apparatus for detecting the wiring phase<br>
of an unknown phase voltage relative to a reference phase<br>
voltage in an electrical poly phase power distribution<br>
system, which method and device allow to detect the wiring<br>
phase even if the location of unknown wiring phase is at a<br>
larger distance from the known reference phase and a direct<br>
communication channel connecting the location of known phase<br>
and the location of unknown wiring phase is not available.<br>
This object is solved in accordance with the present<br>
invention as defined in the independent patent claims.<br>
Advantageous embodiments of the present invention are given<br>
in the dependent claims.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, in order<br>
to detect the wiring phase of an unknown phase voltage at a<br>
remote location relative to a reference phase voltage (R) at<br><br>
a reference location in an electrical power distribution<br>
system having a single phase or poly phase power line (R, S,<br>
T, N) , at least one relay location to relay signals between<br>
said reference location and said remote location is arranged<br>
between said reference location and said remote location and<br>
connected to a wiring phase of the poly phase power line. A<br>
first phase relation is detected between the reference wiring<br>
phase at the reference location and the wiring phase at a<br>
said relay location. Moreover, a second phase relation is<br>
detected between the wiring phase at the relay location and<br>
the wiring phase at the remote location. Based oh the first<br>
and second phase relation the wiring phase of the remote<br>
location relative to the reference wiring phase may be<br>
obtained.<br>
The first phase relation can be obtained in a number of<br>
different ways. If a new node at a remote location is newly<br>
added to extend an existing network, a previously existing<br>
node of the network may take the function of a relay location<br>
for which the wiring phase is already known from a previous<br>
detection. In this case it is sufficient that the relay<br>
location performs the detection of the second phase relation<br>
between the wiring phase at the relay location and the newly<br>
added remote location. The wiring phase at the remote<br>
location can then be determined at the remote location or at<br>
the relay location on the basis of the second phase relation<br>
thus detected and the already known wiring phase of the relay<br>
location, or the relay location transmits the detected second<br>
phase relation to the reference location where the wiring<br>
phase of the remote location may be determined using the<br>
knowledge of the wiring phase of the relay location.<br>
If the at least one relay locations between the reference<br>
location and the remote location have unknown arbitrary<br>
wiring phases, it may be advantageous to detect a first phase<br>
relation between the wiring phase at the reference location<br>
and the wiring phase at the relay location, and transmit it<br><br>
toward said remote location. A second phase relation between<br>
said relay location and said remote location is detected.<br>
Based on said first phase relation and said second phase<br>
relation, the wiring phase at said remote location relative<br>
to the wiring phase at the reference location can be<br>
detected.<br>
Advantageously, the locations may be nodes of a network using<br>
the power line as a communication signal transmission medium.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
wiring phase of an unknown phase voltage relative to a<br>
reference phase voltage in an electrical power distribution<br>
system having a single phase or poly phase power line is<br>
detected by transmitting from a reference location a first<br>
time stamp signal when a first reference point in the<br>
reference phase voltage occurs. The first time stamp signal<br>
is received at a relay location where a first time interval<br>
is measured between the occurrence of the first time stamp<br>
signal and the occurrence of a reference point in a first<br>
arbitrary wiring phase of the power line, to obtain first<br>
phase relation information indicative of a phase relation<br>
between the reference phase voltage and the first arbitrary-<br>
phase voltage. From the relay location a relay message is<br>
transmitted which comprises this phase relation information.<br>
Moreover, from the relay location a relay time stamp signal<br>
is transmitted when a second reference point in the first<br>
arbitrary phase voltage occurs.<br>
According to this embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
generation of a relay time stamp signal together with a relay<br>
message comprising said phase relation information allows to<br>
relay at the relay location the reference phase information<br>
to a remote location, without there being a need for a direct<br>
communication channel between the reference location and the<br>
remote location.<br><br><br>
The relay location may be followed by additional relay<br>
locations to bridge even larger distances between the<br>
reference location and the remote location. Advantageously, a<br>
further relay at a third location receives the relay time<br>
stamp signal and the relay message from the preceding relay<br>
location and measures a second time interval between the<br>
occurrence of the relay time stamp signal and the occurrence<br>
of a reference point in a second arbitrary phase voltage at<br>
the third location to obtain second phase relation<br>
information indicative of a phase relation between the wiring<br>
phase voltages at the consecutive relay locations. At the<br>
 third location, the second phase relation information and the<br>
first phase relation information that was received from the<br>
preceding relay location, is then combined. The combined<br>
phase relation information is indicative of the phase<br>
relation between the reference phase voltage and the wiring<br>
phase voltage at the third location. This information can be<br>
transmitted to the further location in the form of a further<br>
relay message, or this information can be used to determine<br>
the unknown wiring phase at the third location.<br>
The term 'reference location' may refer to a location or node<br>
where the wiring phase of the power line is known, be it<br>
simply by definition, as would be the case at the outlet of a<br>
three phase transformer. The term remote location then refers<br>
to a location or node where the wiring phase is unknown. It<br>
has to be noted, however, that in the alternative', the term<br>
'reference location' may also refer to a location or node<br>
where the wiring phase is unknown and the term ' remote<br>
location' refers to a location or node where the wiring phase<br>
is known. In the embodiment described above, the combined<br>
phase relation between adjacent locations is taken along to<br>
the remote location. It does not make a principal difference<br>
for detecting an unknown wiring phase whether this phase<br>
relation is taken along in the direction from the location<br>
with the known wiring phase to the location with the unknown<br>
wiring phase or in the opposite direction. In the former case<br><br>
the information required to determine the unknown wiring<br>
phase is available at the location of unknown wiring phase,<br>
while in the latter case this information is available at the<br>
location of known wiring phase.<br>
The phase relation information can be represented in terms of<br>
time, in terms of phase angles or in terms of 'hops' between<br>
consecutive phases to be distinguished in the phase diagram<br>
which describes the polyphase system. In a three phase system<br>
each hop would correspond to a phase angle of 120°. If there<br>
is a need to also detect reverse wiring, then in a three<br>
phase system there would be six different wiring<br>
possibilities to be distinguished, and each hop would<br>
correspond to 60° because in this case there are three normal<br>
phases plus another three reverse phases to be considered.<br>
The phase relation information in a received relay message<br>
and the phase relation information obtained from measuring<br>
the time interval between the received time stamp signal and<br>
a reference point in a wiring phase voltage at the receiver<br>
location can be combined in a variety of ways, and preferably<br>
by simply adding the respective time intervals, associated<br>
phase angle values or number of hops. This addition may<br>
advantageously be a modulo M addition. If the phase relation<br>
information is represented in terms of time, then M denotes<br>
the period of the alternating voltage carried on the poly<br>
phase power line. If the phase relation information is<br>
represented in terms of phase angles, M denotes the phase<br>
angle value'associated with a full cycle, that is 2n or 360°.<br>
If the phase relation information is represented in terms of<br>
a number of hops between the phases, then M denotes the<br>
number of wiring phase possibilities to be distinguished in<br>
the poly phase system.<br>
Preferably, the time interval between the occurrence of a<br>
time stamp signal and the occurrence of a reference point is<br>
measured redundantly in order to increase the reliability of<br><br>
the final measurement result. Preferably, for measuring a<br>
particular time interval, the transmitter transmits more than<br>
one time stamp signals, each time stamp signal being<br>
synchronized with a reference point in the phase voltage of<br>
the transmitter. This enables the receiver to repeat the<br>
measurement of the time interval between the time stamp<br>
signal and the occurrence of a reference point in the phase<br>
voltage of the receiver in order to decide the measured time<br>
interval based on a majority vote, and/or to inform the<br>
transmitter of a time interval measurement failure if a clear<br>
majority vote is not achieved.<br>
Advantageously, the same relays which relay the time stamp<br>
signal and phase relation information, may be used to relay a<br>
return message from the remote location of unknown phase<br>
wiring to the reference phase location in order to inform the<br>
reference phase location of the detected wiring phase at the<br>
remote location.<br>
Preferably, the respective reference points in the reference<br>
phase and in the arbitrary wiring phases at the respective<br>
relay location(s) and remote location are predetermined<br>
repetitive events which occur with a period T which is the<br>
alternating voltage period of the poly phase power<br>
distribution network, e.g. 20ms in case of a 50Hz system.<br>
Zero crossings of the respective phase voltages with a slope<br>
of specified sign are particularly suitable as reference<br>
points.<br>
A time stamp signal may be a short burst or any kind of<br>
suitable data packet or symbol sequence that is short in<br>
comparison with the phase voltage period T divided by the<br>
number of wiring phase possibilities to be distinguished. The<br>
time stamp signal can also be a phase discontinuity and/or an<br>
amplitude discontinuity in a more complex signal, bit<br>
sequence or message signal.<br><br>
Preferably, in a poly phase system with an odd number N of<br>
phases, the phase relation information is mapped onto 2N<br>
different wiring phases, for example at a spacing of 60° if N<br>
= 3, in order to take account of the possibility that at a<br>
relay location or at the remote location with the unknown<br>
phase wiring, a particular phase may be connected with<br>
reversed polarity. This feature may be particularly useful in<br>
remote electricity metering applications in order to detect a<br>
wiring error or unlawful rewiring of the remote meter at the<br>
consumer premises.<br>
The time stamp signals and messages generated at the various<br>
locations may preferably be transmitted from one location to<br>
the next by means of power line communication, or by means of<br>
any other communication technology which offers a<br>
communication range sufficient to bridge the distance to the<br>
next relay location, for example optical cable or radio<br>
communication. If power line communication is used for<br>
transmitting the time stamp signals and messages from one<br>
location to the next, these signals may be injected into all<br>
the N phases of the poly phase power line, or it may be<br>
sufficient to inject these signals into a single phase only,<br>
due to the rather strong capacitive and inductive coupling<br>
that exists in a typical poly phase power line between the<br>
various phases. In applications with a large number of<br>
available relay locations, e.g. in a remote electricity<br>
metering system with a considerable number of consumers<br>
connected to the same low voltage network section, blue tooth<br>
communication or any other limited range radio communication<br>
can be a suitable communication technology between the<br>
various consecutive locations up to the remote location the<br>
phase wiring of which is to be detected. .<br>
The present invention also relates to an apparatus for<br>
performing or participating in a method according to the<br>
present invention. An embodiment of a relay apparatus for<br>
detecting the phase wiring of an arbitrary unknown phase<br><br>
voltage comprises a circuit for receiving a first time stamp<br>
signal, a circuit for measuring a time interval between the<br>
occurrence of said time stamp signal and the occurrence of a<br>
reference point in an arbitrary wiring phase voltage of said<br>
power line to obtain phase relation information indicative of<br>
a phase relation between said time stamp signal and said<br>
arbitrary phase voltage, a circuit for generating and<br>
transmitting a relay message which comprises said phase<br>
relation information, and a circuit for generating and<br>
transmitting a relay time stamp signal when a second<br>
reference point in said arbitrary phase voltage occurs. The<br>
relay apparatus according to this embodiment preferably also<br>
comprises a circuit for receiving phase relation information<br>
attributed to said first time stamp signal, which phase<br>
relation information may be in the form of a relay message<br>
from a relay apparatus at a preceding relay location. The<br>
circuit for generating a relay message then preferably<br>
combines the received phase relation and the phase relation<br>
information obtained from measuring the time interval, to<br>
generate the relay message such that it comprises the<br>
combined phase relation information.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the present invention,<br>
an apparatus for detecting the phase wiring of an arbitrary-<br>
unknown phase voltage comprises a circuit for receiving a<br>
time stamp signal, a circuit for measuring a time interval<br>
between the occurrence of the time stamp signal and the<br>
occurrence of a reference point in said arbitrary unknown<br>
wiring phase voltage to obtain phase relation information<br>
indicative of a phase relation between said time stamp signal<br>
and said arbitrary unknown phase voltage, a circuit for<br>
receiving a relay message comprising phase relation<br>
information indicative of a phase relation between the<br>
reference phase and the time stamp signal, and a circuit for<br>
combining the phase relation information indicative of a<br>
phase relation between the time stamp signal and said<br>
arbitrary unknown phase voltage and said received phase<br><br>
relation information, as well as a circuit for determining<br>
the phase wiring of said unknown arbitrary phase voltage from<br>
said combined phase relation information. An apparatus<br>
according to this embodiment of the present information is<br>
able to communicate with a preceding relay location in order<br>
to determine the phase wiring of the unknown arbitrary phase<br>
voltage at the location of the apparatus.<br>
A particularly advantageous application of the present<br>
invention resides in the field of remote metering the<br>
consumption of electricity distributed to a large number of<br>
-consumers through a public electricity distribution system. A<br>
remote metering system of this kind may comprise a<br>
concentrator located e.g. at a secondary substation for<br>
transforming the voltage carried on the medium voltage<br>
distribution network, e.g. 2 0 kV, into a low voltage, e.g.<br>
23 0 V. The secondary sub station feeds a low voltage<br>
polyphase network to which a plurality of consumers is<br>
connected. Each consumer has an electricity meter capable of<br>
communicating with the concentrator of the network section to<br>
which it is connected. In order to assist the concentrator in<br>
detecting the wiring phase of the remote meters connected to<br>
its low voltage network section, each remote meter preferably<br>
comprises a relay apparatus according to the present<br>
invention and/or an apparatus for detecting the phase wiring<br>
of an arbitrary unknown phase voltage according to the<br>
present invention.<br>

Fig. 1 shows the outline of a system for detecting the wiring<br>
phase of an unknown phase voltage in an electrical power<br>
distribution system according to the present invention. In<br>
Fig. 1, L denotes a poly phase power line as a part of an<br>
electrical power distribution system. The poly phase power<br>
line L in Fig. 1 is a three phase power line having three<br>
phases denoted as R, S and T, as well as a neutral conductor<br>
N. Between any two of the three phases R, S and T there is a<br>
phase shift of 120°, as is well known for three phase power<br>
distribution systems. PC in Fig. 1 denotes parasitic<br>
distributed coupling capacitances between the three phases R,<br>
S and T of the poly phase power line L.<br>
Reference numeral 1 denotes a node connected to the power<br>
line L at a first location. In the embodiment of Fig. 1, the<br><br>
node 1 is connected to all the three phases R, S and T as<br>
well as to the neutral conductor N of the power line L in<br>
order to be able to inject and extract power line<br>
communication signals into and from the power line L,<br>
although due to the parasitic capacitive coupling between the<br>
three phases it would be sufficient to connect the node lto<br>
less than all the three phases. The node 1 uses one of the<br>
three phases R, S and T as a reference phase. Any one of the<br>
available phases R, S and T may be chosen at node 1 as a<br>
reference phase. Without any loss of generality it may be<br>
assumed that R denotes the reference phase in the wiring<br>
phase detection system shown in Fig. 1.<br>
Reference numerals 2 and 3 in Fig. 1 denote relay nodes<br>
connected to arbitrary, a priori unknown phases of the poly<br>
phase power line L. In the example shown in Fig. 1, relay<br>
node 2 is connected between phase T and neutral N, while<br>
relay node 3 is connected between phase R and neutral N. The<br>
wiring phase of these relay nodes is arbitrary in the sense<br>
that any of the available phases of the power line L may be<br>
used, without a need to know in advance which of the phases<br>
the node is connected to. It has to be noted that although a<br>
poly phase power line is shown in this embodiment, the<br>
present invention is not limited to wiring phase detection<br>
for poly phase power lines. In case of a single phase power<br>
line it may be interesting to detect reverse wiring of a<br>
consumer at a remote location. The present invention is also<br>
applicable to single phase systems.<br>
Reference numeral 4 denotes a node connected to an unknown<br>
arbitrary phase of the poly phase power line L. The node 4<br>
may be any kind of apparatus or circuit for which the<br>
information is of interest to which of the three phases R, S<br>
and T it is connected. As an example, the node 4 may be a<br>
single phase or poly phase electricity meter for which it is<br>
desired to detect its wiring phase (s) relative to the<br>
reference phase R, e.g. in order to be able to detect errors<br><br>
or fraud in the way the meter is connected to the poly phase<br>
power line L, and/or in order to use the remote meter 4 as a<br>
node in power line communication applications like remote<br>
metering of electricity in an optimised way.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Fig. 1, there is no need for a<br>
direct communication channel between the reference location<br>
of node. 1 and the remote location of the node 4 the wiring<br>
phase of which is to be detected. In order to be able to<br>
perform this detection, the nodes 2 and 3 act as relays. The<br>
operation of this system of Fig. 1 will be explained in the<br>
following making reference to Fig. 2.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a time diagram for illustrating the operation of<br>
the wiring phase detection system shown in Fig. 1 according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The upper portion of Fig. 2 shows the three phase voltages R,<br>
S and T over time. As shown, the three phase voltages are<br>
sign waves with the phase voltage S being 120° behind the<br>
phase voltage R, and the phase voltage T being 120° behind<br>
the phase voltage S and thus 120° ahead of the phase voltage<br>
R. Each of the three phase voltages have two zero crossings<br>
per cycle, that is one zero crossing per cycle with a<br>
specified slope. In the diagram of Fig. 2, the zero crossings<br>
with a positive slope are denoted R+, S+ and T+,<br>
respectively, while zero crossings with a negative slope are<br>
denoted with R-, S- and T-, respectively. In the embodiment<br>
shown, zero crossings with a positive slope in the respective<br>
phase voltages R, S and T have been chosen to serve as<br>
reference points of the respective phase voltages. In Fig. 2,<br>
the horizontal axis t denotes the time axis, while the dashed<br>
lines in the vertical direction Y in Fig. 2 correlate various<br>
events shown in Fig. 2 with certain points of the phase<br>
voltages R, S and'T, as will be explained in detail in the<br>
following. The arrows A and B in Fig. 2 indicate that for<br>
reasons of space on the drawing sheet, the time axis has been<br><br>
drawn in three portions one above the other. The two points<br>
connected by the arrow A are actually coincident on the time<br>
axis. The same applies for the two points connected by the<br>
error B. P denotes the alternating voltage period in the<br>
three phase voltages R, S and T which is 20 ms in case of a<br>
50 Hz system. The numerals 1 to 4 in the right hand portion<br>
of Fig. 2 refer to the nodes 1 to 4 in Fig. 1 to indicate the<br>
location where the respective events depicted in Fig. '2 take<br>
place.<br>
In order to perform the detection of the wiring phase of node<br>
4 in Fig. 2, the node 1 connected to the reference phase R<br>
sends a message S1 with a time stamp TS therein essentially<br>
coinciding with a zero crossing R+ of the reference phase R.<br>
The embodiment shown in Fig. 1 uses power line communication<br>
to transmit this time stamp TS in the message S1 of node 1 to<br>
the relay node 2. The relay node 2 receives the message S1<br>
with the time stamp TS and measures a time interval, denoted<br>
T1 in Fig. 2, between the received time stamp TS in the<br>
message S1 and the occurrence of a reference point T+ in the<br>
arbitrary phase voltage T to which the node 2 is connected.<br>
The node 2 then takes the measured time interval T1 to<br>
generate a message M1(T1) which contains the information<br>
about a phase relation between the received time stamp signal<br>
TS in the message S1 and the wiring phase of the node 2. The<br>
node 2 generates a message S2 which contains a time stamp<br>
signal TS coinciding with the occurrence of another reference<br>
point T+ in the phase voltage of the wiring phase T of node<br>
2. The message S2 generated and transmitted by the node 2 via<br>
the power line L furthermore comprises the phase relation<br>
information message M1(T1).<br>
The message S2 is received at the relay node 3, and the relay<br>
node 3 then measures a time interval, denoted T2 in Fig. 2,<br>
between the received time stamp TS in the message S2 from the<br>
node 2, and the occurrence of a reference point R+ in the<br><br>
phase voltage to which the node 3 is connected. In this<br>
example the time interval T2 reaches from T+ to R+.<br>
At node 3, the phase relation information M1(T1) contained in<br>
the message S2 and the measured time interval T2 is suitably<br>
combined to obtain combined phase relation information as<br>
will be exemplified in more detail below. Node 3 then<br>
generates a message S3 which comprises a time stamp TS as<br>
well as the combined phase relation information M2(T1+T2) .<br>
This message S3 is transmitted by the node 3 via the power<br>
line L at a timing such that the time stamp TS coincides with<br>
a subsequent reference point R+ on the phase voltage R to<br>
which the node 3 is connected in the embodiment shown.<br>
At the node 4, the message S3 containing the time stamp TS is<br>
received, and the node 4 measures a time interval, denoted T3<br>
in Fig. 2, between the time stamp TS in the message S3 and a<br>
reference point S+ in the phase voltage S to which the node 4<br>
is connected. The combined phase relation information<br>
M2(T1+T2) in the message S2 and the time interval T3 is<br>
sufficient for node 4 to determine is wiring phase relative<br>
to the wiring phase of the reference node 1. Node 4 can<br>
determine its relative wiring phase by combining the phase<br>
relation information M2(T1+T2) in the received message S3 and<br>
the measured time interval T3 . Node 4 may then generate a<br>
return message S4 which contains a message M3 (T1+.T2+T3) with<br>
the phase relation information thus combined. This message S4<br>
may be relayed via the nodes 3 and 2 back to the node 1 to<br>
inform the node 1 about the wiring phase of the node 4.<br>
In the embodiment shown, the phase relation information<br>
obtained for measuring the respective time intervals T1, T2<br>
and T3 is preferably expressed in terms of an integer<br>
obtained by mapping the measured time interval T1, T2 and T3,<br>
respectively, onto one of N integers, N being the number of<br>
wiring phase possibilities to be distinguished in the wiring<br>
phase detection. This mapping operation corresponds to<br><br>
dividing the measured time interval by P/N. In the embodiment<br>
shown in Fig. 2, three wiring phase possibilities are<br>
considered, such that N = 3. Accordingly, in the depicted<br>
example T1 is mapped onto 2 (two) , T2 is mapped onto 1 (one)<br>
and T3 is mapped onto 1 (one) . The integers obtained by this<br>
mapping operation are a suitable representation of phase<br>
relation information. Combining the phase relation<br>
information can advantageously take place simply by adding<br>
these integers, and most preferably by means of a modulo N<br>
addition. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 3 this will lead to<br>
the following result: The message M1(T1) will carry the<br>
integer 2. The combined phase relation information carried in<br>
the message M2 (T1+T2) is 2 + 1 mod 3 = 0 which indicates that<br>
the node 3 is connected to the same wiring phase as the<br>
reference phase. The operation 0 + 1 mod 3 performed at node<br>
4 will then reveal that node 4 is one phase behind the<br>
reference phase, that is node 4 is connected to the phase-<br>
voltage S. Accordingly, the message M3 transmitted back to<br>
the reference node 1 simply contains the integer 1.<br>
It has to be noted that while the integer representation of .<br>
the phase relation information just described is a<br>
particularly advantageous implementation in terms of<br>
computational complexity, there are of course other<br>
possibilities to represent the phase relation information<br>
obtained from the measurement of the time intervals Tl, T2<br>
and T3. Other representations would include the explicit time<br>
intervals in terms of seconds or in terms of phase angle or<br>
any other suitable representation. The exemplary embodiment<br>
in Fig. 3 distinguishes between three wiring phases R, S and<br>
T. If inverse phase wirings are to be considered as<br>
additional wiring possibilities, then this will result in six<br>
different phases, i.e. N = 6. In this case, the reference<br>
points of the inverse phase voltages (not shown in the<br>
figure) will coincide with the points R-, S- and T- shown in<br>
Fig. 2.<br><br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 2, the message portions Ml, M2 and<br>
M3 and the time stamp TS are respectively integrated into a<br>
single message S1, S2, S3 and S4. Alternatively, it would be<br>
possible to transmit the time stamp signal TS and the<br>
associated message portion M1 in separate messages, there<br>
being no necessity to transmit the message portions M1 to M3<br>
at a specified timing.<br>
The message S1 shown in Fig. 2 does not comprise a message<br>
portion, because this message has been generated by the<br>
reference node and need not carry any additional phase<br>
relation information. Nevertheless, in order to obtain a<br>
unified communication protocol, it may be advantageous to<br>
provide also the message S1 with a message portion which may<br>
contain dummy information. The message S4 is shown in Fig. 2<br>
without a time stamp signal, because this message serves to<br>
report the combined phase relation information obtained at<br>
node 4 back to the reference node 1 for which a specified<br>
timing is not required. Nevertheless, again for the sake of a<br>
unified communication protocol it may be advantageous to ,<br>
build the message S4 with a time stamp similar to the other<br>
messages, and to transmit the message S4 such that its time<br>
stamp coincides with a reference point in the wiring phase of<br>
the node S4.<br>
Fig. 3 shows an embodiment of a time stamp signal. The signal<br>
shown in Fig. 3 consists of first portion 31 and a second<br>
portion 32. The first portion 31 comprises an alternating<br>
signal pattern at a specified frequency. The portion 32<br>
comprises a signal pattern at the same specified frequency,<br>
however, with an inverse phase relative to the phase of the<br>
signal pattern 31. The phase discontinuity between the first<br>
portion 31 and the second portion 32 constitutes the time<br>
stamp TS.<br>
Fig. 4 shows an embodiment of a message signal which<br>
integrates a time stamp signal and a message portion. In Fig.<br><br>
4,	reference numeral 31 and 32 denote the signal sections<br>
described above with reference to Fig. 3. TS denotes a time<br>
stamp in the form of a phase discontinuity between the signal<br>
portions 31 and 32. The two signal portions 31 and 32<br>
constitute a header H which is useful for establishing bit<br>
synchronization. Reference character F in Fig. 4 denotes a<br>
message field. The message field F may comprise a plurality<br>
of message sub fields N1, N2, ..., Ni. Advantageously, the<br>
messages S1 to S4 shown in Fig. 2 are structured in<br>
accordance with the embodiment of Fig. 4. Each of the message<br>
fields N1 to Ni comprises phase relation information as<br>
described in connection with Fig. 2, and furthermore the<br>
address of the node where this phase relation information has<br>
been obtained as described above, that is by combining<br>
received phase relation information and a measured time<br>
interval. Advantageously, each node that receives phase<br>
relation information and combines the received phase relation<br>
information with information obtained from measuring a time<br>
interval between the time stamp and a reference point on its<br>
wiring phase, appends the combined phase relation information<br>
thus obtained together with its own node address to the<br>
message that it relays to the next node. In this way, the<br>
message S4 in Fig. 2 from the node 4 back to the node 1 in<br>
Fig. 1 comprises phase relation information that allows the<br>
node 1 to obtain the wiring phase of all the nodes involved<br>
in the wiring phase detection of node 4.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a block diagram of a node forming part of the<br>
system shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 5 the reference characters R,<br>
5,	T and N denote the three phases and neutral, respectively,<br>
of the power line L, as explained before. The node shown may<br>
be connected to one or all of the three phases. TR denotes a<br>
transceiver circuit for establishing power line communication<br>
»<br>
via the power line L. CCT, CCS and CCR denote coupling<br>
capacitors, which allow the transceiver circuit TR to<br>
transmit and receive power line communication signals from<br>
those phases of the power line L to which the node is<br><br>
connected. Of course, alternatively inductive coupling means<br>
may be used for this purpose, for example coupling<br>
transformers, as is well known as such. Power line<br>
communication signals may be injected into and extracted from<br>
one conductor only or into/from more or all conductors of the<br>
power line, on each phase with a separate transceiver front<br>
end or with a single transceiver front end for all lines in<br>
parallel. ZD denotes a reference point detector, for example<br>
a zero crossing detector circuit which is connected to detect<br>
zero crossings at a specified one of the three phases R, S<br>
and T to which the node shown in Fig. 5 is connected. The<br>
specified phase is that phase of the node the wiring of which<br>
is to be detected. MC denotes a micro controller circuit. MEM<br>
denotes a memory section, and TM denotes a timer circuit. IF<br>
denotes an interface circuit for interfacing the node shown<br>
in Fig. 5 with other circuitry not shown in the Figure,' e.g.<br>
circuitry for metering the consumption of electricity or for<br>
performing any other function not directly related to the<br>
principles of the present invention. B denotes a bus for<br>
exchanging data and address information between the micro<br>
controller unit MC, the memory section MEM, the transceiver<br>
circuit TR, the zero crossing detector ZD, the timer TM and<br>
the interface circuit IF. IRQ denotes an interrupt request<br>
line to notify the micro controller unit MC of interrupts<br>
generated by the transceiver circuit TR and the zero detector<br>
circuit ZD, respectively, as will be explained in the<br>
following.<br>
The node shown in Fig. 5 operates under software control in<br>
accordance with program data stored in the memory section MEM<br>
to perform operations as described above with reference to<br>
Fig. 2. If the node of Fig. 5 is controlled to act as the<br>
node 1 at the reference location, that phase to which the<br>
input IN1 of the zero crossing detector ZD is connected, will<br>
be the reference phase for performing the wiring phase<br>
detection, that is phase R in Fig. 5. Whenever the zero<br>
crossing detector ZD detects a zero crossing with positive<br><br>
slope, ZD generates an interrupt request on the line IRQ for<br>
the micro controller MC and places information on the bus B<br>
that a zero crossing with a specified slope has occurred. In<br>
response to the interrupt request, the micro controller will<br>
read information from bus B concerning the source of the<br>
interrupt and then instruct the transceiver circuit TR to<br>
place a predetermined signal pattern on the power line L<br>
which contains a time stamp, e.g. as explained above in<br>
connection with Fig. 3 or Fig. 4. The node at the reference<br>
location 1 preferably also transmits a message which contains<br>
an address of the remote node 4 the phase wiring of which is<br>
to be detected. Advantageously, each message transmitted by a<br>
node contains not only the remote node address but a list of<br>
node addresses of all nodes involved in the detection of the<br>
wiring phase of the remote node 4 as well as an address<br>
pointer field which contains the address of the respective<br>
next node to which the message is to be addressed. Each node<br>
contained in the list updates the address pointer field in<br>
accordance with the entries in the list of node addressees to<br>
achieve that the relay messages follow a sequence of nodes<br>
defined in the node address list.<br>
The transceiver circuit TR will listen to communication on<br>
the power line L. Whenever the transceiver circuit TR<br>
receives a message addressed to its own node, it will perform<br>
the necessary demodulation and decoding steps, inform the<br>
micro controller MC about the reception of a new message and<br>
place the received data on the bus B. If the micro controller<br>
MC identifies the message to be a return message S4 from a<br>
remote node the phase wiring of which is to be detected, the<br>
micro controller MC will evaluate the information contained<br>
in the received message in accordance with the operations<br>
described above to obtain the phase wiring of the remote<br>
node, and store the result in the memory section MEM.<br>
If the node shown in Fig. 5 receives a wiring phase detection<br>
message, the transceiver circuit TR receives such a message,<br><br>
informs the micro controller MC via an interrupt request of<br>
the received message and places its content on the data bus B<br>
as before. The micro controller MC evaluates the address and<br>
message content to determine whether the message has to be<br>
relayed to another node. If so, it then instructs the timer<br>
TM to begin a time measuring operation. At the occurrence of<br>
a reference point on the phase to which the zero detector<br>
circuit of the node is connected, a further interrupt request<br>
is generated to the micro controller, this time by the zero<br>
crossing detector, and in response to this interrupt request<br>
the micro controller will then stop the time measuring<br>
operation of the timer circuit TM and suitably process the<br>
data concerning the time interval measured by the timer<br>
circuit TM in accordance with the principles described above.<br>
The time information thus obtained and phase relation<br>
information extracted from the received message are then<br>
combined under program control by the micro controller MC,<br>
and a new message is assembled by the micro controller MC<br>
which contains the resulting combined phase relation<br>
information. This message is made available to the<br>
transceiver circuit TR through the data bus B. At the<br>
occurrence of a further reference point in the phase to which<br>
the zero crossing detector ZD is connected, the micro<br>
controller MC then instructs the transceiver circuit TR to<br>
generate and transmit a message that contains a time stamp<br>
and the combined phase relation information as well as the<br>
address of that node the wiring phase of which is to be<br>
detected, which address was contained in the previously<br>
received message. Advantageously, as explained before, the<br>
message also contains said list of addresses of said address<br>
pointer field that was updated by the node to indicate the<br>
address of the next node for the message.<br>
On the other hand, if the micro controller determines from<br>
the address and content of a received message that it<br>
contains a wiring phase detection request concerning its own<br>
node, the micro controller MC extracts the phase relation<br><br>
information contained in the received message and measures<br>
the time between the time stamp in the received message and<br>
the occurrence of a reference point in the phase to which the<br>
zero crossing detector ZD is connected, according to the same<br>
principles as described before, using the timer circuit TM.<br>
The result of this time interval measurement is then combined<br>
by the micro controller MC with the phase relation<br>
information in the received message. The combined phase<br>
relation information thus obtained is then included by the<br>
micro controller in a return message generated by the<br>
transceiver circuit TR to inform the reference node about the<br>
phase wiring of the present node relative to the reference<br>
phase of the requesting node.<br>
According to the embodiment shown in Fig. 5, each of the<br>
nodes 1 to 4 has essentially the same configuration and<br>
operates under software control by virtue of a micro<br>
controller in accordance with the message content it has<br>
received. At least one node is adapted to generate a wiring<br>
phase detection request message addressed to a specified<br>
remote node, as described.. Any node involved in the relay<br>
process that receives a wiring phase detection request<br>
message not for itself but for a different node, will take<br>
the received message and perform a relay operation as<br>
described before. A node that receives a wiring phase<br>
detection request message for itself, will perform the<br>
operations as described to return a message to the requesting<br>
node where the wiring phase detection request message<br>
originated in order to inform that node about its own wiring<br>
phase relative to the wiring phase of the requesting node.<br>
When a zero crossing triggers the generation of a time stamp<br>
signal, a time offset may occur between the zero crossing and<br>
the time stamp. This offset may be due to a header preceding<br>
the actual time stamp, as shown for example in Fig. 3, and/or<br>
due to a limited processing speed of the micro controller MC.<br>
The effect of this is that the time stamp and the associated<br><br>
zero crossing do not perfectly coincide. If the number of<br>
phase wiring possibilities is low (e.g. N=3), this offset may<br>
be negligible. A simple solution to compensate the delay<br>
between the zero crossing and the associated time stamp is,<br>
to add to each measured time interval the known offset.<br>
Fig. 6A shows an embodiment of a time stamp detector circuit<br>
for detecting a time stamp signal shown in Fig. 3. The time<br>
stamp detector circuit of Fig. 6A may be a part of the<br>
transceiver circuit TR in Fig. 5. In Fig. 6A, IN2 denotes the<br>
input of the time stamp detector circuit. This input is<br>
connected to receive an input signal from the receiver and<br>
demodulator (not shown) of the transceiver circuit TR in Fig.<br>
5. R1 and R2 denote two resistors connected to constitute a<br>
voltage divider. A denotes an operational amplifier or<br>
comparator the positive input of which is connected to the<br>
output of the voltage divider Rl, R2 and the negative input<br>
of which is connected to ground. C1 and R3 denote a capacitor<br>
and a resistor, respectively, which are connected to<br>
differentiate an output signal at the negative output of the<br>
operational amplifier A. Similarly, C2 and R4 denote a<br>
differentiator which is connected to differentiate an output<br>
signal at the positive output of the amplifier A. D1 denotes<br>
a diode connected in parallel with the resistor R3 such that<br>
the cathode of this diode is connected to the capacitor C1<br>
while the anode is connected to ground. D3 denotes a diode<br>
which is connected in parallel to the resistor R4 such that<br>
the cathode of diode D3 is connected with the capacitor C2<br>
while the anode of diode D3 is connected to ground. The<br>
cathode of diode Dl is connected with the resistor R5 through<br>
a further diode D2. The cathode of diode D3 is connected to<br>
the same node of the resistor R5 through, a diode D4. This<br>
node of the resistor R5 is connected with the input of a<br>
retriggerable monoflop MF. The other output of the resistor<br>
R5 is connected to ground. The output of this monoflop<br>
constitutes the output OUT of the time stamp detector<br>
circuit. The retriggerable monoflop has a time period of<br><br>
about 1.5 times the duration between two regular consecutive<br>
edges of the signal section 31 shown in Fig. 4.<br>
Fig. 6B illustrates the operation of the time stamp detector<br>
of Fig. 6A. The upper diagram in Fig. 6B shows the voltage<br>
wave form at the input IN2 of the time stamp detector. The<br>
operational amplifier A converts this input signals into<br>
complementary digital signals at its positive and negative<br>
outputs. The differentiator and the subsequent diode network<br>
connected to the respective outputs emphasize only; the<br>
positive edges in the output signals of the respective<br>
outputs. These differentiated and rectified signals are<br>
combined at the resistor R5, this leading to an output signal<br>
across the resistor R5 as shown in the middle of Fig. 6B. The<br>
signal across resistor R5 triggers the retriggerable monoflop<br>
which will maintain its triggered state as long as the pulses<br>
across R5 are regularly spaced, as shown. As soon as the time<br>
stamp occurs, i.e. the phase inversion in the signal at the<br>
input IN2, a pulse across R5 will be missing such that the<br>
monoflop MF will fall back into the reset state and thus<br>
generate a detection signal at the output OUT. In order to<br>
avoid spurious output pulses at the output OUT, it is<br>
preferable to mask the output signal at OUT by mearis of an<br>
AND gate with a control signal that indicates a locked state<br>
when detecting the preamble 31 of the time stamp signal.<br>
Alternative implementations of a time stamp detector circuit<br>
may be based on integrating the signal at the input IN2 and<br>
comparing the integrated signal with a threshold that will be<br>
reached when the duration of a signal segment of constant<br>
amplitude is longer than usual, i.e. when the phase inversion<br>
occurs. Other alternatives of detecting the time stjamp signal<br>
according to the embodiment of Fig. 3 may adopt a digital<br>
signal pattern detector or any other suitable circuit known<br>
per se.<br><br>
The zero crossing detector ZD may be implemented in a variety<br>
of ways well known as such. A suitable implementation of the<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DETECTING THE WIRING<br>
PHASE OF AN ARBITRARY UNKNOWN PHASE VOLTAGE RELATIVE TO A<br>
REFERENCE PHASE VOLTAGE<br>
The present invention relates to detecting the wiring phase of<br>
an unknown phase voltage relative to a reference phase voltage<br>
in an electric power distribution system having a polyphase<br>
power line L. In order to reliably detect the wiring phase at<br>
the remote location 4 relative to a reference wiring phase<br>
even if the remote location 4 is at a larger distance from the<br>
reference location 1, at least one relay location 2, 3 is<br>
arranged between the reference location 1 and the remote<br>
location 4 and connected to the wiring phase of the polyphase<br>
power line L. A first phase relation is detected between the<br>
reference wiring phase voltage at the reference location 1 and<br>
the wiring phase voltage at the relay location 2, 3. A second<br>
phase relation is detected between the wiring phase voltage at<br>
the relay location 2, 3 and the wiring phase voltage at the<br>
remote location 4. The wiring phase of the remote location 4<br>
relative to the wiring phase at the reference location 1 is<br>
detected based on the first phase relation and the second<br>
phase relation. The present invention is advantageous in that<br>
a direct communication channel between the remote location 4<br>
and the reference location 1 for detecting the phase relation<br>
is not required.</td>
