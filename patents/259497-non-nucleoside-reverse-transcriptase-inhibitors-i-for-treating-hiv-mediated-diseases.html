NON-NUCLEOSIDE REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE INHIBITORS I FOR TREATING HIV MEDIATED DISEASES<br>
This application claims benefit under Title 35 U.S.C. 119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/457,144, filed March 24, 2003, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The related application filed herewith, Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (J. P. Dunn et al), is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
The invention relates to the field of antiviral therapy and, in particular, to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors for treating Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) mediated diseases. The invention provides novel heterocyclic compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds, methods for treatment or prophylaxis of HIV mediated diseases employing said compounds in monotherapy or in combination therapy, and a process for preparing novel heterocyclic compounds.<br>
The human immunodeficiency virus HIV is the causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a disease characterized by the destruction of the immune system, particularly of the CD4+ T-cell, with attendant susceptibility to opportunistic infections. HIV infection is also associated with a precursor AIDS - related complex (ARC), a syndrome characterized by symptoms such as persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, fever and weight loss.<br>
In common with other retroviruses, the HIV genome encodes protein precursors known as gag and gag-pol which are processed by the viral protease to afford the protease, reverse transcriptase (RT), endonuclease/integrase and mature structural proteins of the virus core. Interruption of this processing prevents the production of normally infectious virus. Considerable efforts have been directed towards the control of HIV by inhibition of virally encoded enzymes.<br>
Currently available chemotherapy targets two crucial viral enzymes; HIV protease and HIV reverse transcriptase, (J. S. G. Montaner et al. Antiretroviral therapy: 'the state of the art", Biomed &amp; Pharmacother. 1999 53:63-72; R. W. Shafer and D. A. Vuitton, Highly active retroviral therapy (HAART) for the treatment of infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1, Biomed. &amp; Pharmacother.1999 53:73-86; E. De Clercq, New Developments in Anti-HIV Cehmotherap. Curr, Med. Cliem. 2001 8:1543-1572).   Two general classes of RTI inhibitors<br>
FS/23.01.2004<br><br>
have been identified: nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI).<br>
NRTIs typically are 2',3'-dideoxynucleoside (ddN) analogs which must be phosphorylated prior to interacting with viral RT. The corresponding triphosphates function as competitive inhibitors or alternative substrates for viral RT. After incorporation into nucleic acids the nucleoside analogs terminate the chain elongation process. HIV reverse transcriptase has DNA editing capabilities which enable resistant strains to overcome the blockade by cleaving the nucleoside analog and continuing the elongation. Currently clinically used NRTIs include zidovudine (AZT), didanosme (ddl), zalcitabine (ddC), stavudine (d4T), lamivudine (3TC) and tenofovir (PMPA).<br>
NNRTIs were first discovered in 1989. NNRTI are allosteric inhibitors which bind reversibly at a nonsubstrate binding site on the HTV reverse transcriptase thereby altering the shape of the active site or blocking polymerase activity. (R. W. Buckheit, Jr,, Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: perspectives for novel therapeutic compotatds and sti'ategies for treatment of HIV infection, Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs 2001 10(8)1423-1442; E. De Clercq The role ofnonO-nuceloside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) in the therapy ofHTV-1 infection, Antiviral Res. 1998 38:153-179; G. Moyle, The Emerging Roles of Non-Nucleoside Reverse Traitscriptase Inhibitors in Antiviral Therapy, Drugs 2001 61(l):19-26) Although over thirty structural classes of NNRTIs have been identified in the laboratory only three compounds have been approved for HTV therapy: efavirenz, nevirapine and delavirdhie. Although initially viewed as a promising class of compounds, in vitro and in vivo studies quickly revealed the NNRTIs presented a low barrier to the emergence of drug resistant HTV strains and class-specific toxicity. Drug resistance frequently develops with only a single point mutation in the RT.<br>
While combination therapy with NRTTs, Pis and NNRTIs has, in many cases, dramatically lowered viral loads and slowed disease progression, significant therapeutic problems remain. The cocktails are not effective in all patients, potentially severe adverse reactions often occur and the rapidly-replicating HTV virus has proven adroit at creating mutant drug-resistant variants of wild type protease and reverse transcriptase.<br>
There remains a need for safer drugs with activity against wild type and commonly occurring resistant strains of HTV.<br>
Benzyl-pyridazinone compounds have been extensively investigated as thyroxin analogs which can decrease plasma cholesterol without stimulating cardiac activity (A. H. Underwood et al A thyromimetic- that decreases plasma cholesterol -without increasing cardiovascular' activity<br><br>
Nature 1986 324(6096):425-429; P. D. Leeson et al Selective thyromimetics. Cardiac-sparing thyroid hormone analogs containing 3'-ajylmethyl substituents 1 Med Chem 1989 32(2):320-326; P. D. Leeson et al EP 0188351). W09624343 (D. J. Dunnington) discloses oxo-pyridazinylmethyl substituted tyrosines are selective antagonists for the haematopoietic phosphatase' SH2 domain which may render them useful to increase erythropoiesis and haematopoiesis. WO 9702023 (D. J. Dunnington) and WO9702024 (D. J. Dunnington) further disclose these compounds are specific inhibitors of the human Stat 6 SH2 domain and may be useful for treating asthma, allergic rhinitis and anemia. WO2001085670 (H. Shiohara et al) discloses related malonamide derivatives useful for treating circulatory diseases. EP 810218 (D. A. Allen et al) discloses benzoyl substituted benzyl-pyridazinone compounds which are cyclooxygenase inhibitors and potential antiinflammatory or analgesic compounds. None of the references teaches therapy for HIV infections or inhibition of HIV reverse transcriptase.<br>

The heterocyclic compounds of the present invention are prepared by a two-stage process (Scheme 1) comprising construction of an appropriately substituted aryl ring 2 and subsequently introducing the heterocyclic ring 3. Although stages can be accomplished in any order, the heterocyclic ring is generally introduced after the modifications of the aryl ring are completed. Substituted alkyl m-hydroxyphenylacetate la or ?n-hydroxyphenylacetonitrile lb derivatives are convenient starting materials. They are often commercially available or readily prepared from commercially available precursors. Alternatively the aryl ring may be substituted with a methyl lc or carboxylic acid ester Id substituent which is subsequently converted to lb (for example,<br><br><br>
Preparation of Phenvlacetic Acid and Phenvlacetonitile Precursors f Scheme 1) Ethyl 3-hydroxy-4-methylphenylacetate (5a) was prepared from ethyl 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenylacetate as shown in Scheme 2. The phenol was converted to the triflate ester 4b which was subjected to displacement with Me2Zn3 DH3AL-H and PdCl2(dppf) (E.-i. Negishi in Metal-catalyzed Cross-Coupling Reactions, F. Diederich and P. J. Stang (eds.), Wiley-VCH, Mannheim 1998, chap.l; E. Erdik, Tetrahedron 1992 48:9577-9648) to afford the 4c. Boron tribromide demethylation afforded 5a. Ethyl 3-hydroxy-4-ethylphenylacetate 5b was prepared by Friedel-Crafts acylation of 4d which afforded ethyl 4-acetyl-3-methoxyphenylacetate (4e). Reduction of the ketone with triethylsilane and TEA produced the corresponding 4-ethyl substituted derivative 4f which was demethylated with BBr3 to afford 5b. Ethyl 3-hydroxy~4-zso-propylphenylacetate (5c) was prepared by Wittig olefination of 4e and subsequent catalytic hydrogenation of the 2-propenyl substituent to yield 4h. Demethylation with boron tribromide produced 5c.<br><br><br>
Ethyl 3,4-dimethyl-54iydroxyphenylacetate (8) was prepared by formylation of 6a and esterificatioa of the resulting carboxylic acid 6b to produce ethyl 3-fonnyl-4-hydroxy-5~ methoxyphenyl acetate (7a). Reduction of the aldehyde and hydrogenolysis the resulting benzyl alcohol afforded 7b. The second methyl substituent was introduced by sequential treatment of 7b with triflic anhydride which yielded 7c and displacement with Me2Zn, PdCl2(dppf) and DIBAL-H [supra) to produce 7c. Boron tribromide mediated demethylation afforded 8. (Scheme<br>
3)<br><br>
Ethyl 4-chloro-3-hydroxyphenyl acetate (10) was prepared from 4-chIoro-3-methox3^toluene by sequential free radical bromination (9b), nucleophilic displacement of the bromine atom with cyanide (9c) and a two-step hydrolysis of the nitrile to the amidine hydrochloride 9d and<br><br>
subsequently to the ethyl ester 9e. Boron tribromide mediated demethylation as described previously afforded 10. (Scheme 4)<br><br>
6-Methyl derivatives were prepared from 3-hydroxy-2-metbylbenzoic acid (11) which was chlorinated (NaOCl/NaOH) and esterified to afford 13. Cupric acetate mediated coupling {infra) of benzeneboronic acid provided the diaiyl ether 14. The nitrile was introduced by sequential reduction, mesylation and cyanide displacement to afford 17. The mesylate underwent an in situ displacement by chloride during the mesylation reaction. *<br>
SCHEME 5<br><br>
6- fluoro- and chloro- derivatives were available from 6-cliloro-2-fluoro-3-methylphenol (IS) and 3-bromo-2?4-dichlorotoluene (19), respectively (Scheme 6). The base-catafyzed reaction of 18 and j?-fluoro-nitrobenzene yielded daiiyl ether 20. Conversion of the nitro substiuent to the corresponding amine followed by "diazotization and reduction produced 4-chloro-2-fluoro-3-phenoxytoluene (22). One skilled in the art will appreciate that the availability of amino-■ substituted aryl groups affords the possibility to replace the amino substiuent with a variety of other substituents utilizing the Sandmeyer reaction.   Cupric chloride-mediated coupling (see<br><br>
infra) of 19 afforded the corresponding 2?4-rdicliloro-3-phenoxytoluene (23). Elaboration of the acetonitrile sidechain in 24 and 25 was accomplished by benzylic brominatioaand displacement.<br><br>
Benzofran 31 and dihydrobenzofuran 29 derivatives (Scheme 7) were prepared from dihydrobenzofiiran (26). Acylation with ethyl chloro oxalate produced the a-ketoester 27 which, was reduced to the corresponding phenylacetic acid derivative 28a under Wolff-Kischner conditions. The preparation of 29 by a Wilgerodt reaction also has been reported (J. Dunn et ah J. Med Chem 1986 29:2326). Freidel-Crafts acylation with acetyl chloride afforded the acetyl derivative 28b which was converted to the acetate 28c under Baeyer-Villiger conditions and subsequently hydrolyzed to 29. The corresponding benzofuran analogs were prepared by benzylic bromination and concomitant dehydrohalogention to yield 31.<br><br><br>
The preparation of diaiyl ethers has been reviewed (J. S. Sawyer, Recent Advances in Diaiyl Ether Synthesis, Tetrahedron 2000 56:5045-5065). The diaiyl ethers required herein were prepared by three different methods (Scheme 8): (i) Cu(OAc)2 catalyzed condensation of substituted benzene boronic acids and phenols (D. A. Evans et aL, Synthesis of Diaiyl Ethers through the Copper-Promoted Aiylation of Phenols with Aiyl Boronic Acids, An Expedient Synthesis of Thyroxine, Tetrahedron Lett, 1998 39:2937-2940 and D. M. T. Chan et al, New N-and O-Atylations with Phenylboronic Acids and Cupric Acetate, Tetrahedron Lett. 1998 39:2933-2936; Scheme 1, conditions (a), (b), (e), (f), (i); (ii) by variations of the Ullmann diaiyl ether synthesis with Cu(I) salts (J.-F. Marcoux et aL, A General Copper-Catalyzed Synthesis of Diaryl Ethers, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997 119:10539-540; E. Buck et al, Ullmann Diaiyl Ether Synthesis: Rate Acceleratiortby 2f216,6-tetramethylhepta7ie-3,5-dione, Org. Lett, 2002 4(9): 1623-1626) ; conditions (c), (d) and (h); or by nucleophilic aromatic displacement reactions (Sawyer supra pp 5047-5059; conditions Scheme 1(g) and (j). An alternative process utilizing palladium-catalyzed coupling procedures also has been reported (G. Mann et al, Palladium-Catalyzed Coupling Involving Unactivated Aiyl Halides. Sterically Induced Reductive Elimination to Form the C-OBondin Diaiyl Ethers, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1999 121:3224-3225). One skilled in the art will appreciate that optimal procedure will vary depending on the nature and position of substituents on the aryl rings.<br><br><br>
Substituted 7?z-cresol derivatives are also suitable substrates for coupling using these procedures. After introduction of the meta substituent the intermediate can be converted to the corresponding phenylacetonitrile derivative by bromination and cyanide displacement (Scheme 9).<br><br><br>
coupling of compounds with a fused aryl, heteroaryl or heterocyclic ring to produce diacyl ethers, alkylaryl ethers or arylaralkylethers can be carried out by the same procedures. The preparation of aralkyloxy benzofuranylacetate and aryloxydihydrobenzofuranylacetate derivatives is exemplified in Scheme 10. Aralkoxybenzofurans are prepared by Mitsunobu coupling of the alcohol and the hydroxybenzofuranacetic acid.<br><br>
Axalkyl aryl ethers were prepared using Mitsunobu conditions (Scheme 11; O. Mitsunobu, Synthesis 1981 1-28). Alternatively aralkyl ethers can be prepared via a classical Williamson ether synthesis (J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry; 4th Edition; Wiley &amp; Sons: New York,<br><br>
1992;pp. 386-87) or utilizing palladium-catalyzed coupling (M. Palucki et al, Palladium-catalyzed Intermolecidar Carbon-Oxygen Bond Formation; A New Synthesis of Aryl Ethers, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997 119:3395-96).<br><br><br>
Preparation of Diphenvlamirie Intermediates (Scheme 1: X = NR6)<br>
Diphenylamine compounds with in the scope of the present invention can be prepared by ' palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions as described by Hartwig (Transition Metal Catalyzed Synthesis  of Aryl Amines and Aiyl Ethers from Aryl Halides and Triflates: Scope and Mechanism, Angew. Chent Int Ed, Eng. 1998 37:2046-67)<br>
Preparation of Diphenvi Methane Intermediates (Scheme 1: 2: X = CH? or C=Q)<br>
Diphen3dmethane compounds of the present invention can be prepared by reduction of the corresponding benzoyl derivatives 42. While reductions are conveniently carried out with triethylsilylhydride and trifluoroacetic acid, a variety of other procedures to effect this transformation are well known within the art.<br><br>
The preparation of the requisite benzoyl derivatives has been described in U. S. Patent No. 5,886,178 (D. A. Allen et al). The synthesis of benzoyl substituted benzofuran derivatives have also been reported in U. S. Patent No. 4,780,480 (J. P. Dunn) and the scientific literature (J. P. Dunn et at Analgetic and Antiinflammatory 7-Aroylbenzofw-an-5&gt;-ylacetic acids and 7-Aroylbenzothiophene-5-ylacetic Acids, J. Med. Chent 1986 29:2326) These references are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>

The oxadiazolone, thiadiazolone and triazolone compounds of the present invention can be prepared by cyclization of a diacyl hydrazone derivative according to formula V. Without wishing to be limited by a specific mechanism or sequence of reaction steps, the oxadiazolones can be prepared by treating an acylhydrazone IV with the appropriate, acyl derivative and cyclizing the resulting diacyl compound One skilled in the art will appreciate that IV is an ambident micleophile and initial reaction could be at either the carbonyl oxygen or the nitrogen and subsequent ring closure of either produces the same product<br><br><br>

Kristinsson et al, Synthesis of Heterocycles. V. l,3,4-Thiazo-2(3H)one, Helv. Chim. Acta 1982 65:2606). Alternatively, cyclization of N-acyl-N'-alkoxycarbonyl hydrazides with Lawesson's reagent can directly produce the thiadiazole (B. P. Rasmussen et ah Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr. 1985 62). Triazolones 48 were prepared by carbamoylation of an acyl hydrazide 46d with ethyl isocyanate to yield an N-acyl-N-carbamoylhydrazide 47 cyclized to the triazolone 48 upon treatment with methanolic potassium hydroxide.<br><br><br>

The term "therapeutically effective amount" as used herein means an amount required to reduce symptoms of the disease in an individual. The dose will be adjusted to the individual requirements in each particular case. That dosage can vary within wide limits depending upon numerous factors such as the severity of the disease to be treated, the age and general health condition of the patient, other medicaments with which the patient is being treated, the route and form of administration and the preferences and experience of the medical practitioner involved. For oral administration, a daily dosage of between about 0.01 and about 100 mg/kg body weight per day should be appropriate in monotherapy and/or in combination therapy. A preferred daily dosage is between about 0.1 and about 500 mg/kg body weight, more preferred 0.1 and about 100 mg/kg body weight and most preferred 1.0 and about 10 mg/kg body weight per day. Thus, for administration to a 70 kg person, the dosage range would be about 7 mg to 0.7 g per day. The daily dosage can be administered as a single dosage or in divided dosages, typically between 1 and 5 dosages per day. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect for the individual patient is reached. One of ordinary skill in treating diseases described herein will be able, without undue experimentation and in reliance on personal knowledge, experience and the disclosures of this application, to ascertain a therapeutically effective amount of the compounds of the present invention for a given disease and patient<br>
hi embodiments of the invention, the active compound or a salt can be administered in combination with another antiviral agent, such as a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, another nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or HIV protease inhibitor. When the active compound or its derivative or salt are administered in combination with another antiviral agent the activity may be increased over the parent compound. When the treatment is combination<br><br>
therapy, such administration may be concurrent or sequential with respect to that of the nucleoside derivatives. "Concurrent administration" as used herein thus includes administration of the agents at the same time or at different times. Administration of two or more' agents at the. same time can be achieved by a single formulation containing two or more active ingredients or by substantially simultaneous administration of two or more dosage forms with a single active agent.<br>
It will be understood that references herein to treatment extend to prophylaxis as well as to the treatment of existing conditions, and that the treatment of animals includes the treatment of humans as well as other animals. Furthermore, treatment of a HIV infection, as used herein, also includes treatment or prophylaxis of a disease or a condition associated with or mediated by HTV infection, or the clinical symptoms thereof.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations are preferably in unit dosage forms. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into "unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form.<br>
