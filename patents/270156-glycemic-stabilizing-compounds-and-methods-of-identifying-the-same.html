GPR41 AND MODULATORS THEREOF FOR THE TREATMENT OF<br>
INSULIN-RELATED DISORDERS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to methods for identifying a glycemic stabilizing<br>
compound, for example, a compound that controls insulin secretion, by determining<br>
whether a compound modulates GPR41 functionality. Accordingly, compounds of the<br>
present invention are useful in the prophylaxis or treatment of insulin-related disorders<br>
such as hypoglycemia, an insulin-secreting or insulin-dependent tumor, agmg, insulin<br>
resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, or diabetes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Cells use glucose as a main source of energy. Therefore, food is first broken down<br>
by the body to glucose prior to being utilized. Glucose is then released from the gut into the<br>
blood resulting in a rise in blood glucose levels. In response to this rise in glucose level,<br>
pancreatic β-islet cells increase their production and secretion of insulin. Insulin circulates<br>
through the blood and acts as a messenger, sending a signal to insulin responsive organs<br>
such as the adipose tissue, muscle and liver, to increase their intake of glucose. In this way<br>
arise in blood glucose is accompanied by a subsequent increase in insulin secretion from β-<br>
cells. It is the rise in insulin that acts to return blood glucose levels to normal In healthy<br>
individuals blood glucose levels are kept fairly constant. This state of equilibrium, called<br>
normoglyccmia (normal glucose level) is tightly controlled by insulin.<br>
In diseases such as diabetes this tight regulation of blood glucose level is lost,<br>
leading to the increased blood glucose levels observed in diabetics. A state of<br>
hyperglycemia (high glucose level) can occur due to an insufficient production of insulin by<br>
the pancreatic β-cells and/or through inadequate uptake of glucose by target organs such as<br>
muscle, Liver and fat. The end result is an increase in blood glucose level. Thus, diabetes<br>
can be thought of as the result of two types of impairment: impaired insulin secretion from<br>
the β-cells and impaired insulin sensitivity by the major insulin responsive organs. This<br>
impaired insulin sensitivity, also known as insulin resistance (because the organs are<br>
resistant to the effects of insulin), means that more insulin is required in order for the target<br>
organs to increase their glucose uptake. Insulin resistance leads to increased pressure on the<br>
β-cells because the β-cells need to increase their insulin secretion to compensate for insulin<br>
resistance. This is an escalating problem leading first to impaired glucose tolerance and;<br>

eventually, complete loss of insulin secretion due to the inability of the pancreas to keep up<br>
with the ever-increasing demand for insulin.<br>
Diabetes is a diagnostic term for a group of disorders characterized by abnormal<br>
glucose homeostasis resulting in elevated blood glucose. There arc many types of diabetes,<br>
but the two most common are Type J, also referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes melhtus<br>
or IDDM, and Type II, also referred to as non-insulin-dependent diabetes melhtus or<br>
NTDDM. Type 1 diabetes is mainly a disease with a young age of onset, and is due to the<br>
destruction of the insulin secreting β3-cclls in the pancreas by the immune system. In this<br>
case the body fails to recognize the pancreatic β-cells as being self and destroys its own<br>
cells. With the destruction of the β-cells there is a complete loss of insulin secretion and so<br>
affected individuals have an absolute dependency on insulin for survival. Type II diabetes<br>
is mainly a disease with a later age of onset, usually after the age of 40, but in recent years it<br>
is more common to find younger people being diagnosed with Type II diabetes. It is mainly<br>
characterized by insulin resistance and beta cell exhaustion and is often associated with<br>
obesity. Type II diabetes is more common than Type I diabetes and accounts for 90-95% of<br>
all diabetes cases diagnosed worldwide.<br>
Chrome exposure of tissues to hyperglycemia can result in diverse complications<br>
including microvascular problems of neuropathy, refinopathy and nephropathy and the<br>
macrovascular complications of stroke, coronary heart disease, and peripheral vascular<br>
disease. Inappropriate control of blood glucose level is also a characteristic of diseases<br>
other than diabetes such as obesity and Syndrome X. For example, one of the<br>
characteristics of Syndrome X is insulin resistance or glucose intolerance. In addition,<br>
obesity is characterized by hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, a feature shared with<br>
NIDDM, hypertension and atherosclerosis. Further, obesity is a major risk factor for<br>
NIDDM. The risk of developing NIDDM is tripled in subjects 30% or more overweight,<br>
and three-quarters of NIDDM patients are overweight.<br>
Obesity, which is the result of an imbalance between caloric intake and energy<br>
expenditure, is highly correlated with insulin resistance and diabetes in experimental<br>
animals and humans. However, the molecular mechanisms that are involved in obesity-<br>
diabetes syndromes still under investigation. During early development of obesity,<br>
increased insulin secretion balances insulin resistance and protects patients from<br>
hyperglycemia (Le Stunff, et al., Diabetes 43:696-702 (1989)). However, over time, (3 cell<br>
function deteriorates and non-insulin-dependent diabetes develops in about 20% of c    se<br>
individuals (Pederson, P., Diab. Metab. Rev. 5:505-509 (1989), and Brancati, F. L., et al.,<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/052566                                                                                                    PCT/US2005/039551<br>
Arch. Intern. Med. 159:957-963 (1999)). Given its high prevalence in modern societies,<br>
obesity has thus become the leading risk factor for N1DDM (Hill, J. 0., et al., Science<br>
280:1371-1374 (1998)). However, the factors which predispose some patients to alteration<br>
of insulin secretion in response to fat accumulation remain unknown. Unfortunately,<br>
effective long-term therapies to treat obesity are still not available.<br>
Diabetes afflicts several million people worldwide. In the United States alone, there<br>
are more than 18 million diabetics, with 600,000 new cases diagnosed each year. People<br>
with diabetes are at higher risk for heart disease, blindness, kidney failure, infection,<br>
extremity amputations, and other conditions. It is estimated that the direct medical<br>
expenditures and indirect expenditures attributable to diabetes in the United States were<br>
$132 billion in 2002. Taken together, diabetes complications are one of the nation's leading<br>
causes of death.<br>
Therapies do exist to treat diabetes, such as α-glucosidase inhibitors, biguanides,<br>
thiazolidinediones, meglitinidcs, sulfonylureas and exogenous insulin. However, these<br>
therapies have limited effectiveness and arc associated with significant safety and<br>
tolerability issues such as risk for hypoglycemic episodes, weight gain, gastrointestinal<br>
disturbances and anemia. In addition, many of the treatment options require injection or<br>
multiple daily dosings which present compliance challenges.<br>
In addition to disorders that benefit from increasing insulin secretion such as<br>
diabetes, there are a number of disorders that can benefit from decreasing insulin secretion.<br>
For example, a decrease in insulin secretion can result in an increase in blood glucose which<br>
is needed during hypoglycemia. In addition, for example, decreasing insulin secretion can<br>
be useful for a patient with an insulinoma, which is a tumor that secretes excess insulin.<br>
Insulin can also serve as a growth factor for certain tumors. Further, caloric restriction is<br>
known to down-regulate insulin secretion and this may be a mediator of caloric restriction's<br>
favorable impact on longevity. Thus, a reduction in insulin secretion can be beneficial to<br>
treat aging. In all these cases, a reduction in insulin levels can be beneficial.<br>
Thus, there exists a need for the identification of an agent which safely and<br>
effectively modulates insulin secretion and/or blood glucose levels for the treatment of<br>
insulin-related disorders such as hypoglycemia, an insulin-secreting or insulin-dependent<br>
tumor, aging, insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, or diabetes. The present<br>
invention satisfies this need and provides related advantages as well.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Applicants have disclosed herein that human GPR41 is expressed predominantly<br>
in the pancreas (sec Figure 1) and mouse GPR4J is expressed in the pancreas and<br>
pancreatic islet cell lmes"(see Figures 2 and 3). The pancreas is divided into lobnles by<br>
connective tissue scptae. Lobules are composed largely of grape-like clusters of<br>
exoenine cells called acini, which secrete digestive enzymes. Embedded within the<br>
pancreatic exoenne tissue are islets of Langerhans, the endocrine component of the<br>
pancreas. Islets make up only 1% of the pancreas.. Islets contain several ceil types and<br>
arc richly vasculanzcd.   The islet cell types include:alpha, heta, delta, A, B, C, D, and E<br>
It is the beta islet ceils that secrete insulin.<br>
Applicants also disclose herein that mouse GPR41 is up-regulated in pancreatic<br>
islet cells from db/db diabetic mice compared to islets from C57 wild-type mice (see<br>
Figure 2). Further, Applicants have disclosed herein the G-proiem coupling of GPCR<br>
GPR41 to G-alpha 1 and G-alpha 12/13 (see Figures 4 and 5). In addition. Applicants<br>
disclose herein that GPR41 agonists induce 1P3 signaling in cells cotransfected with<br>
Gq/Gi (see Figure 6). Using MIN6 insulinoma cells. Applicants further disclose herein<br>
that a GPR41 agonist inhibits insulin secretion (Figure 7) and reversed the beneficial<br>
effect of an oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT) lowering compound (Figure 8).<br>
Although a number of receptor classes exist in humans, the most abundant and<br>
currently therapeutically relevant is represented by the G protein-coupled receptor<br>
(GPCR) class. It is estimated that there are some 30,000-40,000 genes within the human<br>
genome, and of these, approximately 2% arc estimated to code for GPCRs. GPCRs<br>
represent an important area for the development of pharmaceutical products: from<br>
approximately 20 of the 100 known GPCRs, approximately 60% of all prescription<br>
Pharmaceuticals have been developed.<br>
GPCRs share a common structural motif, having seven sequences of between 22<br>
to 24 hydrophobic amino acids that form seven alpha helices, each of which spans the<br>
membrane (each span is identified by number, i.e., transmembranc-1 (TM-1),<br>
transmembrane-2 (TM-2), etc.). The transmembrane helices are joined by strands of<br>
amino acids between transmembrane-2 and transmembrane-3, transmembrane-4 and<br>
transmembranc-5, and transmembrane-6 and transmembrane-7 on the exterior, or<br>
"extracellular" side, of the cell membrane (these are referred to as "extracellular" regions<br>
1, 2 and 3 (EC-1, EC-2 and EC-3), respectively). The transmembrane helices are also<br>
joined by strands of amino acids between transmembrane-1 and transmcmbrane-2,<br>

WO 2006/052566                                                                                                    PCT/US2005/039551<br>
transmembrane-3 and transmembrane-4, and transmembrane-5 and transmembrane-6 on<br>
the interior or "intracellular" side of the cell membrane (these are referred to as .<br>
"mtraccllular" regions 1,2 and 3 (IC-i, 1C-2 an.d.l.C-3), respectively). The "carboxy"<br>
("C") icrminus of the receptor lics-injhc intracellular space wtfhm the ceil, and the<br>
"ammo"1 (N") terminus of the receptor lies m tlic extracellular space outside of the cell.<br>
Generally, when a ligand-binds with fhe receptor (often referred to as "acu\ation"<br>
of the receptor); there is a change in the conformation of the recepior that facilitates<br>
coupling between the intracellular region and an intracellular "G-protein." It has been<br>
reported that GPCRs are "promiscuous" with respect to G proteins, i.e., thai a GPCR. can<br>
interact with more than one G protein. See, K.enakin, 1',, 4i Life Sciences 1095 (1988)<br>
Although other G proteins exist, currently. Gq, Gs.Gi. Gz and Go are G proteins that<br>
have been identilied. Ligand-acuvated GPCR coupling with the G-protein initiates a<br>
signaling cascade process (referred to as "signal transduction'*). Under normal .<br>
conditions, signal tracsduction ultimately results in cellular iicrivationor cellular<br>
inhibition. Although not wishing to be bound to theory, it is thought that the IC-3 loop<br>
as well as the carboxy terminus of the receptor interact with the G protein<br>
There are also promiscuous G proteins, which appear to couple ro several classes<br>
of GPCRs to the phosphohpase C pathway, such as Gal 5 or Gal 6 -(Offennaans &amp;<br>
Simon. J Biol Chem 270:15175-80 (1995)), or chimeric G proteins designed to couple a<br>
large number of different GPCRs to the same pathway, e.g. phospholipase C (Milligan &amp;.<br>
Rees, Trends in Pharmaceutical Sciences 20:118-24 (1999)).<br>
Gi-coupled GPCRs lower intracellular cAMP levels. The melanophore<br>
technology (see infra) is useful for identifying Gi-coupled GPCRs and also for<br>
identifying modulators of said Gi-coupled GPCRs.<br>
Under physiological conditions, GRCRs exist in the cell membrane in equilibrium<br>
between two different conformations: an "inactive" state and an "active" state. A<br>
receptor in an inactive state is unable to link to the intracellular signaling transduction<br>
pathway to initiate signal transduction leading to a biological response. Changing the<br>
receptor conformation to the active state allows linkage to the transduction pathway (via<br>
the G-protein) and produces a biological response.<br>
A receptor can be stabilized in an active state by a ligand or a compound such as<br>
a drug. Recent discoveries, including but not exclusively limited to modifications to the<br>
amino acid sequence of the receptor, provide means other than ligands or drugs to<br>
promote and stabilize the receptor in the active state conformation. These means<br>

effectively stabilize the receptor in an active state by simulating the effect of a hgand<br>
binding to the receptor. Stabilization by such hgand- independent means is termed<br>
"constitutive receptor activation."<br>
The sequence of CPR41 was first published in the literature by Sawzdargo et al<br>
(Sawzdargo et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comrrmn., 239:543-547 (1997))   Sawzdaruo<br>
et al. amplified human genorrue DNA using PCR with degenerate primers based on<br>
conserved sequences within the human and rat galanin receptor 1 (GALRf) and rat<br>
GALR2. One product contained a segment showing 100% homology to a portion of the<br>
3-pnme region of the human CD22 gene. Sawzdargo searched for open reading frames<br>
in tins region and identified the GPR40 and GPR41 genes^ The GRR41 gene has JIO<br>
introns   GPR4I encodes a predicted 346 amino acid GPCR containing 7 transmembrane<br>
domains, 1 glycosylation site, 1 PKC phosphorylation site. 2 PKA/PKC phosphor} lation<br>
sites, and 1 palmitoylation site, which is located in the C-terrninal domain. The GPR41<br>
protein shares 98% amino acid identity with GPR42, but little similarity with GALRs.<br>
Sawzdargo et al. further reported that the GPR41 gene is located downstream of CD22.<br>
which was previously mapped to 19ql3.1.<br>
GPR41 was classified as an orphan receptor, meaning thai no hgand had been<br>
identified for the receptor. .Recently. Brown et al. have reported that GPR41 is activated<br>
by propionate and other short chain carboxyhc acid anions (Brown et at., J. Biol. Chem ,<br>
278:11312-11319 (2003)). In addition, Brown et al. indicate that GPR41 activates the<br>
Gi/o family pioteins and GPR41 is primarily expressed in adipose tissue.<br>
In contrast to the disclosure herein that GPR41 is expressed in the beta cells of<br>
the pancreas, WO 01/61359 (filing date February 19, 2001) indicates that GPR41 is<br>
restricted to adipose tissue. In addition, WO 01/61359 indicates that GPR41 can be used<br>
as a screening target for compounds that inhibit lipolysis. Since GPR41 is coupled to Gi,<br>
such compounds would be agonists of GPR41. Agonists of GPR41 are also<br>
hypothesized in WO 01/61359 to be useful, for example in the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for the treatment of dyslipidaemia and conditions associated with<br>
dyslipidemia, coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis, thrombosis or obesity, angina,<br>
chronic renal failure, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, type II diabetes or metabolic<br>
syndrome. This is in contrast to the disclosure herein that an inverse agonist or<br>
antagonist of GPR41 would be useful, for example, in the manufacture of a medicament<br>
for treatment of an insulin-related disorder such as diabetes.<br>

tor example, an effective dose can be an amount that can prevent an insuhn-i elated<br>
disorder.<br>
GLYCEMIC STABILIZING COMPOUND is intended to mean a compound<br>
that stabilizes blood glucose levels. Stabilization of blood glucose can be direct or<br>
indneet. For example, a glycemic-stabmzmg compound can stabilize blood glucose<br>
levels in an individual with diabetes by increasing insulin secretion, in" addition, loi<br>
example, a glycemic-stabilizmg compotind can stabilize blood glucose, Ievels.in an   '<br>
individual with hypoglycemia by decreasing insulin secretion. Further, for example, a<br>
glycemic-stabilizmg compound can stabilize blood glucose levels by increasing glucose<br>
sensitivity at an organ or tissue.<br>
IMPAIRED GLUCOSE TOLERANCE (IGT) as used herein is intended to<br>
indicate that condition associated with insulin-resistance that is intermediate between hank,   -<br>
type 2 diabetes and normal glucose tolerance. (NGT). IGT is diagnosed by a procedure<br>
wherein an affected person's postprandial glucose response is determined to be abnormal as<br>
assessed by 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose levels. In this test, a measured amount of<br>
glucose is given to the patient and blood glucose levels aremeasured at regular intervals.<br>
usually every half hour for the first two hours and every hour thereafter. In a "normal" or<br>
non-lGT individual, glucose levels rise during the first two hours to a level less than 140<br>
mg/dl and then drop rapidly. In an IGT individual, the blood glucose levels are higher and<br>
the drop-off level is at a slower rate.<br>
IN NEED OF PREVENTION OR TREATMENT as used herein refers to a<br>
judgment made by a caregiver (e.g. physician, nurse, nurse practitioner, etc. in the case of<br>
humans; veterinarian in the case of animals, including non-human mammals) that an<br>
individual or animal requires or will benefit from treatment This judgment is made based<br>
on a variety of factors that are in the realm of a caregiver's expertise, but that include the<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2006/052566                                                                                                    PCT/US2005/039551<br>
knowledge that the individual or animal is ill, or will be ill, as the result of a condition that<br>
is treatable by the compounds of the invention.<br>
INDIVIDUAL as used herein refers to any animal, including mammals, preferably<br>
mice, rats, other rodents, rabbits, dogs, cats, swine, cattle, sheep, horses, or pnmates, and<br>
most preferably humans.<br>
INHIBIT or INHIBITING, in relationship to the term "response" shall mean that a<br>
response is decreased or prevented in the presence of a compound as opposed to in the<br>
absence of the compound.<br>
INSULIN-RELATED DISORDER means a disorder related to the level of<br>
insulin in the blood or at an organ or tissue. As used herein, an insulin-related disorder<br>
can be the result of, for example, too little insulin secretion, loo much insulin secretion,<br>
or even normal insulin secretion coupled with resistance of an organ to insulin   An<br>
insulin-related disorder is intended to include, for example, a disorder thai would benefit<br>
from a decrease in insulin secretion, for example, hypogiycemia, an insulinoma, a tumor<br>
where insulin is a growth factor, or aging. In addition, an insulin-related disorder is<br>
intended to include, for example, a disorder that results in elevated blood glucose and<br>
would benefit from an increase in insulin secretion. Such disorders include, for example,<br>
insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes such as Type I diabetes or Type<br>
II diabetes. Further, in some embodiments, the term insulin-related disorder can include<br>
diseases that are related to an elevated blood glucose level, for example, atherosclerosis,<br>
heart disease, stroke, hypertension, Syndrome X, obesity, and peripheral vascular<br>
disease.<br>
INSULIN RESISTANCE as used herein is intended to encompass the usual<br>
diagnosis of insulin resistance made by any of a number of methods, including but not<br>
restricted to: the intravenous glucose tolerance test or measurement of the fasting insulin<br>
level. It is well known that there is a good correlation between the height of the fasting<br>
insulin level and the degree of insulin resistance. Therefore, one could use elevated fasting<br>
insulin levels as a surrogate marker for insulin resistance for the purpose of identifying<br>
which normal glucose tolerance (NGT) individuals have insulin resistance. A diagnosis of<br>
insulin resistance can also be made using the euglycemic glucose clamp test.<br>
INVERSE AGONIST means material, for example, a ligand or candidate<br>
compound that binds either to the endogenous form or to the constitutively activated form<br>
of the receptor so as to reduce the baseline intracellular response of the receptor observed in<br>
the absence of an agonist. An intracellular response can be, for example, modulation of<br>

GTP binding to membranes or modulation of the level of a second messenger such as<br>
cAMP or IP3. In some embodiments, an INVERSE AGONIST is material not previously<br>
known to reduce the baseline intracellular response of the receptor observed m the absence<br>
of an agonist.<br>
L1GAND shall mean an endogenous, naturally occurring molecule specific for an<br>
endogenous, naturally occurring receptor.<br>
As used herein, the terms MODULATE or MODULATING shall mean to refer<br>
to an increase or decrease in the amount, quality, response or effect of a particular<br>
activity, function or molecule. A GPR41 MODULATOR is an agent that modulates the<br>
GPR41 receptor<br>
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION shall mean a composition comprising<br>
at least one compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. For example, a<br>
pharmaceutical composition can comprise at least one active ingredient, whereby the<br>
composition is amenable to investigation for a specified, efficacious outcome in an animal<br>
(for example, a mammal such as a human). Those of ordinary skill in the art will<br>
understand and appreciate the techniques appropriate for determining whether an active<br>
ingredient has a desired efficacious outcome based upon the needs of the artisan.<br>
RECEPTOR FUNCTIONALITY shall refer to the normal operation of a receptor<br>
to receive a stimulus and moderate an effect in the cell, including, but not limited to<br>
regulating gene transcription, regulating the influx or efflux of ions, effecting a catalytic<br>
reaction, and/or modulating activity through G-protcins. A GPR41 functionality can be, for<br>
example, binding a G-protein such as Gi or G12/13, signaling through a second messenger<br>
such as cAMP or IP3 (when using a chirneric G-protein), specifically binding to a GPR41-<br>
specific antibody, specifically binding to a compound such as a GPR41 agonist or inverse<br>
agonist, modulating insulin secretion or modulating blood glucose levels in vivo.<br>
SECOND MESSENGER shall mean an intracellular response produced as a result<br>
of receptor activation. A second messenger can include, for example, inositol tnphosphate<br>
(IP3), diacylglycerol (DAG), cyclic AMP (cAMP), cyclic GMP (cGMP), and Ca2+.<br>
Second messenger response can be measured for a determination of receptor activation. In<br>
addition, second messenger response can be measured for the direct identification of<br>
candidate compounds, including for example, inverse agonists, partial agonists, agonists,<br>
and antagonists.<br>
The invention relates to a method for identifying a glycemic stabilizing<br>
compound, comprising: a) contacting a candidate compound with GPR41, and b)<br>

WO 2006/052566                                                                                                    PCT/US2005/039551<br>
determining whether GPR41 functionality is modulated, wherein a modulation in GPR4]<br>
functionality is indicative of the candidate compound being a glycemic stabilizing<br>
compound. The screening method can be used to identify a compound which can be, for<br>
example, an agonist, inverse agonist, partial agonist, or antagonist of GPR41.<br>
As used herein, "GPR41" refers to a polypeptide with the ammo acid sequence as<br>
shown in SEQ ID NO 2, or a variant 01 ortholog of this sequence that retains<br>
substantially the function of a polypeptide with the amino acid sequence as referenced in<br>
SEQ ID NO:2.<br>
It is understood that limited variations or modifications to GPR41 can be made<br>
without destroying its function. For example, GPR41 is intended to include other<br>
GPR41 polypeptidcs, for example, mammalian species orthologs of the human GPR41<br>
polypeptide. The sequences of species orthologs of human GPR41 are present m the<br>
database, for example, a mouse ortholog of GPR41 can be found in GenBank at<br>
Accession No. XM145470 and a rat ortholog of GPR41 can be found in GenBank at<br>
Accession No. XM344880. In addition, GPR41 includes variants such as allelic<br>
variants, splice variants and conservative amino acid substitution variants of GPR41.<br>
For example, GPR41 includes variants that retain substantially the function of the wilci-<br>
type GPR41 polypeptide such as, for example, the ability to signal through G-alpha 1 or<br>
G-alpha 12/13, the ability to specifically bind to a GPR41-specific antibody, the ability<br>
to specifically bind to a compound such as a known ligand or agonist, the ability to<br>
specifically bind to agonist or inverse agonist compounds disclosed herein, or the ability<br>
to regulate insulin secretion or blood glucose levels. A GPR41 variant need not function<br>
to the same level as the wild-type GPR41, and need not contain every function of the<br>
wild-type GPR41.<br>
Conservative and non-conservative amino acid changes, gaps, and insertions to<br>
an amino acid sequence can be compared to a reference sequence using available<br>

The invention thus further provides pharmaceutical formulations comprising a<br>
compound disclosed herein or identified by methods of the invention or a<br>
pharmaccutically acceptable salt or derivative thereof together with one or more<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers thereof and/or prophylactic ingredients. The<br>
carrier(s) arc "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of<br>
the formulation and not overly deleterious to the recipient thereof.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations include those suitable for oral, rectal, nasal, topical<br>
(including buccal and sub-lingual), vaginal orparenteral (including intramuscular, sub-<br>
cutaneous and intravenous) administration or in a form suitable for administration by<br>
inhalation or insufflation.<br>
The compounds of the invention, together with a conventional adjuvant, carrier,<br>
or diluent, can thus be placed into the form of pharmaceutical formulations and unit<br>
dosages thereof, and in such form can be employed as solids, such as tablets or filled<br>
capsules, or liquids such as solutions, suspensions, emulsions, elixirs, gels or capsules<br>
filled with the same, all for oral use, in the form of suppositories for rectal<br>
administration; or in the form of sterile injectable solutions for parenteral (including<br>
subcutaneous) use. Such pharmaceutical compositions and unit dosage forms thereof<br>
can comprise conventional ingredients in conventional proportions, with or without<br>
additional active compounds or principles, and such unit dosage forms can contain any<br>
suitable effective amount of the active ingredient commensurate with the intended daily<br>
dosage range to be employed.<br>
For oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition can be in the form of, for<br>
example, a tablet, capsule, suspension or liquid. The pharmaceutical composition can be<br>
made in the form of a dosage unit containing a particular amount of the active ingredient.<br>
Examples of such dosage units are capsules, tablets, powders, granules or a suspension,<br>
with conventional additives such as lactose, manmtol, corn starch or potato starch; with<br>
binders such as crystalline cellulose, cellulose derivatives, acacia, com starch or gelatins;<br>
with disintegrators such as corn starch, potato starch or sodium carboxyraelhyl-cellulosc;<br>
and with lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate. The active ingredient can also be<br>
administered by injection as a composition wherein, for example, saline, dextrose or<br>
water can be used as a suitable pharmaceuticaUy acceptable carrier.<br>
The invention relates to a method for selectively activating a GPR41 receptor in a<br>

compound with GPR41, and b) determining whether GPR41 functionality is modulated,<br>
wherein a modulation in GPR41 functionality is indicative of the candidate compound<br>
bemg a glycemic stabilizing compound. For example, in one embodiment, the method<br>
further comprises administering to said individual an effective amount of an agent used<br>
for the treatment of diabetes, blood lipid disorders, or obesity in combination with an<br>
effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition containing a GPR41 inverse agonist.<br>
In one embodiment, the individual is a mammal and in another embodiment the<br>
individual is a human.<br>
As used herein the term "treating" in reference to a disorder means a reduction in<br>
severity of one or more symptoms associated with a particular disorder. Therefoie,<br>
treating a disorder does not necessarily mean a reduction in severity of all symptoms<br>
associated with a disorder and does not necessarily mean a complete reduction in the<br>
severity of one or more symptoms associated with a disorder. Similarly, the term<br>
"preventing" means prevention of the occurrence or onset of one or more symptoms<br>
associated with a particular disorder and does not necessarily mean the complete<br>
prevention of a disorder. The methods of the invention can be used to treat an insulin-<br>
related disorder including, for example, hypoglycemia or diabetes.<br>
The dose when using the compounds disclosed herein or identified by methods of<br>
the invention can vary within wide limits, and as is customary and is known to the<br>
physician, it is to be tailored to the individual conditions in each individual case. It<br>
depends, for example, on the nature and severity of the illness to be treated, on the<br>
condition of the patient, on the compound employed or on whether an acute or chrome<br>
disease state is treated or prophylaxis is conducted or on whether further active<br>
compounds are administered in addition to the compounds disclosed herein or identified<br>
by methods of the invention. Representative doses of the present invention include,<br>
33<br><br>
WO 2006/052566                                                                                                    PCT/US2005/039551<br>
about 0.01 mg to about 1000 mg, about 0.01 to about 750 mg, about 0.01 to about 500<br>
mg, 0.01 to about 250 mg, 0.01 mg to about 200 mg, about 0.01 mg to 150 rag, about<br>
0.01 mg to about 100 mg, and about 0.01 mg to about 75 rag. Multiple doses can be<br>
administered during the day, especially when relatively large amounts are deemed to be<br>
needed, for example 2, 3 or 4, doses. If appropriate, depending on individual behavior<br>
and as appropriate from the patients physician or care-giver it can be necessary to deviate<br>
upward or downward from the daily dose.<br>
The amount of active ingredient, or an active salt or derivative thereof, required<br>
for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular salt selected but also with the<br>
route of administration, the nature of the condition being treated and the age and<br>
condition of the patient and will ultimately be at the discretion of the attendant physician<br>
or clinician. In general, one skilled in the art understands how to extrapolate in vivo data<br>
obtained in a model system, typically an animal model, to another, such as a human.<br>
Typically, animal models include, but are not limited to, the rodent diabetes models as<br>
described m Example 19, infra (other animal models have been reported by Reed and<br>
Scnbncr in Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism, 1.75-86 (1999)). In some circumstances,<br>
these extrapolations can merely be based on the weight of the animal model in<br>
comparison to another, such as a mammal, for example, a human, however, more often,<br>
these extrapolations are not simply based on weights, but rather incorporate a variety of<br>
factors. Representative factors include the type, age, weight, sex, diet and medical<br>
condition of the patient, the severity of the disease, the route of administration,<br>
pharmacological considerations such as the activity, efficacy, pharmacokinetic and<br>
toxicology profiles of the particular compound employed, whether a drug delivery<br>
system is utilized, on whether an acute or chronic disease state is being treated or<br>
prophylaxis is conducted or on whether further active compounds are administered m<br>
addition to the compounds disclosed herein or identified by methods of the invention and<br>
as part of a drug combination. The dosage regimen for treating a disease condition with<br>
the compounds and/or compositions of this invention is selected in accordance with a<br>
variety factors as cited above. Thus, the actual dosage regimen employed can vary<br>
widely and therefore can deviate from a preferred dosage regimen and one skilled in the<br>
art will recognize that dosage and dosage regimen outside these typical ranges can be<br>
tested and, where appropriate, can be used in the methods of this invention.<br>
The desired dose can conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided<br>
doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example, as two, three, four or more sub-<br>
34<br><br>
WO 2006/052566                                                                                                    PCT/US2005/039551<br>
doses per day. The sub-dose itself can be further divided, e.g., into a number of discrete<br>
loosely spaced administrations. The daily dose can be divided, especially when<br>
relatively large amounts are administered as deemed appropriate, into seveial, for<br>
example 2, 3 or 4, part administrations. If appropriate, depending on individual<br>
behavior, it can be necessary to deviate upward or downward from the daily dose<br>
indicated.<br>
The compounds disclosed herein or identified by methods of the invention can be<br>
administrated in a wide variety of oral and parcnteral dosage forms. It will be obvious to<br>
those skilled in the art that the following dosage forms can comprise, as the active<br>
component, either a compound disclosed herein or identified by methods of the invention<br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound disclosed herein or identified by<br>
methods of the invention.<br>
For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds disclosed herein<br>
or identified by methods of the invention, the selection of a suitable pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier can be either solid, liquid or a mixture of both. Solid form<br>
preparations include powders, tablets, pills, capsules, cachets, suppositories, and<br>
dispersible granules. A solid carrier can be one or more substances which can also act as<br>
diluents, flavouring agents, solubilizers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders,<br>
preservatives, tablet disintegrating agents, or an encapsulating material.<br>
In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in a mixture with the<br>
finely divided active component. In tablets, the active component is mixed with the<br>
carrier having the necessary binding capacity in suitable proportions and compacted to<br>
the desire shape and size.<br>
The powders and tablets can contain varying percentage amounts of the active<br>
compound. A representative amount in a powder or tablet can contain from 0.5 to about<br>
90 percent of the active compound; however, an artisan would know when amounts<br>
outside of this range are necessary. Suitable carriers for powders and tablets are<br>
magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch,<br>
gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, a low melting wax,<br>
cocoa butter, and the like. The term "preparation" is intended to include the formulation<br>
of the active compound with encapsulating material as carrier providing a capsule in<br>
which the active component, with or without carriers, is surrounded by a carrier, which is<br>
thus in association with it. Similarly, cachets and lozenges are included. Tablets,<br>
35<br><br>
WO 2006/052566                                                                                                    PCT/US2005/039551<br>
powders, capsules, pills, cachets, and lozenges can be used as solid forms suitable for<br>
oral administration.<br>
For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax, such as an admixture of fatty<br>
acid glyecrides or cocoa butter, is first melted and the active component is dispersed<br>
homogeneously therein, as by stirring. The molten homogenous mixture is then poured<br>
into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool, and thereby to solidify.<br>
Formulations suitable for vaginal administration can be presented as pessaries,<br>
tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or sprays containing in addition to the active<br>
ingredient such earners as are known in the art to be appropriate.<br>
Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions, for<br>
example, water or waler-propylcnc glycol solutions. For example, parenteral injection<br>
liquid preparations can be formulated as solutions in aqueous polyethylene glycol<br>
solution. Injcctable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous<br>
suspensions can be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or<br>
wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation can also be a<br>
sterile injectable solution or suspension in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or<br>
solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and<br>
solvents that can be employed are water, Ringer's solution, and isotomc sodium chloride<br>
solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or<br>
suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including<br>
synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use m the<br>
preparation of injectables.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention can thus be formulated for<br>
parenteral administration (e.g. by injection, for example bolus injection or continuous<br>
infusion) and can be presented in unit dose form in ampoules, pre-filled syringes, small<br>
volume infusion or in multi-dose containers with an added preservative. The<br>
pharmaceutical compositions can take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions<br>
in oily or aqueous vehicles, and can contain formulatory agents such as suspending,<br>
stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient can be in<br>
powder form, obtained by aseptic isolation of sterile solid or by lyophilization from<br>
solution, for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile, pyrogen-free water, before<br>
use.<br>

Aqueous solutions suitable for oral use can be prepared by dissolving the active<br>
component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavors, stabilizing and thickening<br>
agents, as desired.<br>
Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely<br>
divided active component in water with viscous material, such as natural or synthetic<br>
gums, resins, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulosc, or other well known<br>
suspending agents.<br>
Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted,<br>
shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for oral administration. Such liquid forms<br>
include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. These preparations can contain, in<br>
addition to the active component, colorants, flavors, stabilizers, buffers, artificial and<br>
natural sweeteners, dispersanls, thickeners, solubilizing agents, and the like.<br>
For topical administration to the epidermis the compounds according to the<br>
invention can be formulated as ointments, creams or lotions, or as a transdermal patch.<br>
Ointments and creams can, for example, be formulated with an aqueous or oily<br>
base with the addition of suitable thickening and/or gelling agents. Lotions can be<br>
formulated with an aqueous or oily base and will in general also contain one or more<br>
emulsifying agents, stabilizing agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, thickening<br>
agents, or coloring agents.<br>
Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges<br>
comprising active agent in a flavored base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth;<br>
pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin or<br>
sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable<br>
liquid carrier.<br>
Solutions or suspensions are applied directly to the nasal cavity by conventional<br>
means, for example with a dropper, pipette or spray. The formulations can be provided<br>
in single or multi-dose form. In the latter case of a dropper or pipette, this can be<br>
achieved by the patient administering an appropriate, predetermined volume of the<br>
solution or suspension. In the case of a spray, this can be achieved for example by<br>
means of a metering atomizing spray pump.<br>
Administration to the respiratory tract can also be achieved by means of an<br>
aerosol formulation in which the active ingredient is provided m a pressurized pack with<br>
a suitable propellant. If the compounds disclosed herein or identified by methods of the<br>
invention or pharmaceutical compositions comprising them are administered as aerosols,<br>
37<br><br>
WO 2006/052566                                                                                                    PCT/US2005/039551<br>
for example as nasal aerosols or by inhalation, this can be carried out, for example, using<br>
a spray, a nebulizer, a pump nebulizer, an inhalation apparatus, a metered inhaler or a dry<br>
powder inhaler. Pharmaceutical forms for administration of the compounds disclosed<br>
herein or identified by methods of the invention as an aerosol can be prepared by<br>
processes well-known to the person skilled in the art. For their preparation, for example,<br>
solutions or dispersions of the compounds disclosed herein or identified by methods of<br>
Ihe invention in water, water/alcohol mixtures or suitable saline solutions can be<br>
employed using customary additives, for example benzyl alcohol or other suitable<br>
preservatives, absorption enhancers for increasing the bioavailability, solubilizers,<br>
dispersants and others, and, if appropriate, customary propellants, for example include<br>
carbon dioxide, CFC's, such as, dichlorodifluoromethanc, tnchlorofluoromethane, or<br>
dichlorotetrafluoroethane; and the like. The aerosol can conveniently also contain a<br>
surfactant such as lecithin. The dose of drag can be controlled by provision of a metered<br>
valve.<br>
In formulations intended for administration to the respiratory tract, including<br>
intranasal formulations, the compound will generally have a small particle size for<br>
example of the order of 10 microns or less. Such a particle size can be obtained by<br>
means known in the art, for example by micronization. When desired, formulations<br>
adapted to give sustained release of the active ingredient can be employed.<br>
Alternatively the active ingredients can be provided in the form of a dry powder,<br>
for example, a powder mix of the compound in a suitable powder base such as lactose,<br>
starch, starch derivatives such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Conveniently the powder carrier will form a gel in the<br>
nasal cavity. The powder composition can be presented in- unit dose form for example in<br>
capsules or cartridges of, for example, gelatin, or blister packs from which the powder<br>
can be administered by means of an inhaler.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations can be in unit dosage forms. In such form, the<br>
preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active<br>
component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package<br>
containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and<br>
powders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet,<br>
cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged<br>
form.<br>

Tablets or capsules for oral administration and liquids for intravenous<br>
administration arc particularly useful compositions.<br>
Insulin-related disorders include, for example, hypoglycemia, an insulin-secreting<br>
or insulin-dependent tumor, aging, insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, or<br>
diabetes.<br>
Hypoglycemia is defined as abnormally low blood glucose. Hypoglycemia can<br>
result, for example, from excessive insulin or a poor diet. For example, hypoglycemia<br>
can occur when a person with diabetes has injected too much insulin, eaten too little<br>
food, or has exercised without extra food. Symptoms of hypoglycemia include, for<br>
example, a feeling of nervousness or weakness, headache, blurred vision, hunger, and<br>
excessive sweatincss.<br>
Insulin-secreting tumors include, for example, insulinomas. An insulinoma is a<br>
tumor of the beta cells in areas of the pancieas called the islets of Langerhans. Although<br>
not usually cancerous, such tumors may cause the body to make extra insulin and may<br>
lead to a blood glucose level that is too low. In addition to insuhn-secreting tumors,<br>
some tumors that do not secrete insulin can use insulin as a growth factor. While insulin<br>
may or may not be the sole growth factor used by the tumor, reduction in the amount of<br>
insulin in the body may reduce the growth of the tumor.<br>
Aging is the physiological processes that occur in an organism as it gets older.<br>
Caloric restriction down-regulates insulin secretion and there is reason to suspect that<br>
these effects are key mediators of caloric restriction's favorable impact on longevity.<br>
Thus, strategies for down-regulating insulin can be useful to slow the process of aging<br>
and increase longevity.<br>
Diabetes and related conditions such as insulin resistance and impaired glucose<br>
tolerance have been described above herein.<br>
In addition, insulin resistance is a common feature of polycystic ovary syndrome<br>
(PCOS) and drugs such as rosiglitazone and metformin has been used in the treatment of<br>
PCOS (Sepilian and Nagamani J. Chn. Endocrinol Metab. Oct. 14,2003; Baillargeon et<br>
al., Fertil. Steril. 82:893-902 (2004)). PCOS is characterized, for example, by bilaterally<br>
enlarged polycystic ovaries, amenorrhea, and infertility. It is inherited as an aulosomal<br>
dominant condition. Other symptoms of the disease can include, for example, hirsutism<br>
and obesity. Hormonally, PCOS is characterized, for example, by increased secretion of<br>

Another indication for the compounds of the invention is treatment of<br>
lipodystrophy, for example, as caused by anti-retroviral therapy for HIV infection. Some<br>
patients on long term AIDS therapy known as highly active anti-retroviral therapy<br>
(HAART) are increasingly developing a syndrome called lipodystrophy. Symptoms<br>
include insulin sensitivity, the redistribution of fat from the face, arms and legs to the<br>
abdomen and upper back, and cholesterol changes. About 14 percent of people on<br>
HAART eventually develop type 2 diabetes. The drug rosiglitazone has been shown to<br>
improve insulin sensitivity in HIV-positive patients who received the treatment for three<br>
months. Patients had about a 20 percent improvement on a standard test to measure<br>
insulin sensitivity and also increased their total body fat, particularly the amount of fat on<br>
their face, arms and legs, which went up by 24 percent. By comparison, patients talcing<br>
the placebo had a 2 percent decrease in face, arm and leg fat.<br>
In some embodiments, said insulin-related disorder includes a condition related to<br>
an elevated blood glucose concentration, such as atherosclerosis, heart disease, stroke,<br>
hypertension, obesity, Syndrome X and peripheral vascular disease.<br>
Atherosclerosis is a process where deposits of fatly substances, cholesterol and<br>
other substances build up in the inner lining of an artery. This buildup is called plaque<br>
Plaques that rupture cause blood clots to form that can block blood flow to the heart<br>
(heart attack) or the brain (stroke). Heart attack is the number one cause of death for<br>
both men and women in the United States and stroke is the number three cause of death<br>
[see, for example, Nature Medicine, Special Focus on Atherosclerosis, (2002) 8:1209-<br>
1262]. Abnormally high levels of circulating lrpids arc a major predisposing factor m<br>
development of atherosclerosis. Elevated levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL)<br>
cholesterol, elevated levels of Iriglycerides, or low levels of high density lipoprotein<br>
(HDL) cholesterol are, independently, risk factors for atherosclerosis and associated<br>
pathologies.<br>
Heart disease includes, but is not limited to, cardiac insufficiency, coronary<br>
insufficiency, coronary artery disease, and high blood pressure (hypertension).<br>
Peripheral vascular disease refers to diseases of blood vessels outside the heart and bram.<br>
Organic peripheral vascular diseases are caused by structural changes in the blood<br>
vessels, such as inflammation and tissue damage. Peripheral artery disease is an<br>
example. Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a condition similar to coronary artery<br>
disease and carotid artery disease. In PAD, fatty deposits build up along artery walls and<br>
affect blood circulation, mainly in arteries leading to the legs and feet. In its early stages<br>
40<br><br>
WO 2006/052566                                                                                                    PCT/US2005/039551<br>
a common symptom is cramping or fatigue in the legs and buttocks dunng activity. Such<br>
cramping subsides when the person stands still. This is called "intermittent<br>
claudication." People with PAD have a higher risk of death from stroke and heart attack,<br>
due to the risk of blood clots.<br>
Syndrome X, also called metabolic syndrome, is characterised by a group of<br>
metabolic risk factors in one peison. They include: central obesity (excessive fat tissue<br>
in and around the abdomen), atherogcnic dyslipidemia (blood fat disorders - mainly high<br>
triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol), raised blood pressure (130/85 mmHg or higher),<br>
insulin resistance or glucose intolerance, prothrombotic state (e.g., high fibrinogen or<br>
plasminogen activator inhibitor [-1] in the blood), and proinflammatory state (e.g.,<br>
elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in the blood).<br>
While the compounds disclosed herein or identified by the methods of the<br>
invention can be administered as the sole active pharmaceutical agent as described heiein<br>
above, they can also be used in combination with one or more agents including, for<br>
example, agents that are used for the treatment of diabetes, blood lipid disorders, or<br>
obesity. For example, a compound such as a GPR41 inverse agonist or antagonist can be<br>
used in combination with one or more agents belonging to the class of drugs known as a-<br>
glucosidase inhibitors, aldose reductase inhibitors, biguanides, thiazolidinediones,<br>
meglitinides, sulfonylurcas, insulin, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, squalene synthesis<br>
inhibitors, fibrate compounds, LDL catabolism enhancers, angjotensin converting<br>
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, lipase inhibitors, serotonin and/or noradrenaline releasers or<br>
reuptake inhibitors.<br>
α-Glucosidase inhibitors belong to the class of drugs which competitively inhibit<br>
digestive enzymes such as oc-amylase, maltase, a-dextrinase, sucrase, etc. in the pancreas<br>
and or small intestine. The reversible inhibition by α-glucosidase inhibitors retard,<br>
diminish or otherwise reduce blood glucose levels by delaying the digestion of starch and<br>
sugars. Some representative examples of α-glucosidase inhibitors include acarbosc, N-<br>
(l,3-dihydroxy-2-propyl)valiolarnine (generic name; voglibose), miglitol, and α-<br>
glucosidase inhibitors known in the art.<br>
The class of aldose reductase inhibitors are drugs which inhibit the first-stage<br>
rate-limiting enzyme in the polyol pathway and thereby prevent or arrest diabetic<br>
complications. In the hyperglyccmic state of diabetes, the utilization of glucose in the<br>
polyol pathway is increased and the excess sorbitol accumulated intracellularly as a<br>
consequence acts as a tissue toxin and hence evokes the onset of complications such as<br>

diabetic neuropathy, retinopathy, and nephropathy. Examples of the aldose reductasc<br>
inhibitors include tolurcstat; epalrestat; 3,4-dihydro-2,8-diisopropyl-3-thioxo-2μM,4-<br>
benzoxa/.me-4-aceticacid;2,7-difluorospiro(9/1/-fluorcne-9,4l-imidazolidme)-2I,51-dione<br>

zopolrestat; sorbiml;and l-[(3-bromo-2-benzofurauyl)sulfonylJ-2,4-iniidazolidinedi(&gt;ae<br>
(M-16209), and aldose rcductase inhibitors known in the art.<br>
The biguanides arc a class of drugs that stimulate anaerobic glycolysis, increase<br>
the sensitivity to insulin in the peripheral tissues, inhibit glucose absorption from the<br>
intestine, suppress of hepatic gluconcogencsis, and inhibit fatty acid oxidation<br>
Examples of biguanides include phenformin, metformin, buformin, and biguanides<br>
known in the art<br>
Insulin secretion enhancers belong to the class of drugs having the property to<br>
promote secretion of insulin from pancreatic (5 cells. Examples of the insulin secretion<br>
enhancers include sulfonylureas (SU). The sulfonylurcas (SU) are drugs which promote<br>
secretion of insulin from pancreatic p cells by transmitting signals of insulin secretion<br>
via SU receptors in the cell membranes. Examples of the sulfonylureas include<br>
tolbutamide; chlorpropamide; tolazarmde; acetohexamide; 4-chloro-N-[(l-<br>
pyrolidinylamino) caibonyl]-benzenesulfonamide (generic name: gjycopyramide) or its<br>
ammonium salt; glibenclamide (glyburide); gliclazide; l-butyI-3-metaniiylurea;<br>
carbutamide; glibonuride; glipizide; gliquidone; glisoxepid; glybuthiazole; glibuzolc;<br>
glyhexamide; glymidinc; glypinamide; phenbutamide; tolcyclamide, glimepiride, and<br>
other insulin secretion enhancers known in the art. Other insulin secretion enhancers<br>
include N-[[4-( 1 -methyIethyl)cyclohexyl)carboiiyl]-D-phenyIalanine (Nateglinidc);<br>
calcium (2S)-2-benzyl-3-(cis-hexahydro-2-isomdolinylcarbonyI)propionatedihydrate<br>
(Mitiglmide, KAD-1229); and other insulin secretion enhancers known in the art.<br>
Thiazolidinediones belong to the class of drugs more commonly known as TZDs<br>
Thiazolidinediones are a class of drugs for type 2 diabetes that lower the blood sugar by<br>
increasing the sensitivity of cells to insulin. Insulin can then move glucose from the<br>
blood into cells for energy. These drugs can also increase HDL.<br>
Examples of thiazolidinediones include rosiglitazone, pioglitazonc, and<br>
thiazolidinediones known in the art. Rezulin (troglitazone) was the first drug in this class<br>
in the U.S., but was taken off the market because of liver toxicity. Sister compounds<br>

WO 2006/052566                                                                                                    PCT/US2005/039551<br>
now available with a better safety profile include Actos (pioghtazone) and Avandia<br>
(rosiglitazone). The main contraindications to the use of these medications include liver<br>
disease and heart failure. These drugs can also cause a significant increase in fluid<br>
retention and thereby increase the risk of heart failure.<br>
Meglitinides are used to stop the rapid rise m blood sugar that can occur<br>
immediately after a person with type 2 diabetes cats a meal. These compounds, which<br>
include, for example, repaglinide (Prandin) and nateglinide (Starlix), work by inci easing<br>
the amount of insulin produced by the pancreas similar to the way sulfonyurea<br>
medications work. Meglitinides are taken before eating a meal. Side effects associated<br>
with this class of drugs includes low blood sugar, upper respiratory infections including<br>
sinus conditions, headache, joint and back pain, nausea, diarrhea and constipation<br>
The different types of insulin are categorized according to how fast they start to<br>
work (onset) and how long they continue to work (duration). The types now available<br>
include rapid-, short-, intermediate-, and long-acting insulin. There are premixed rapid-<br>
and intermediate-acting insulins available, including: 70% intermediate-acting (NPH)<br>
and 30% short-acting regular insulin, called 70/30 insulin; 50% intermediate-acting<br>
(NPH) and 50% short-acting regular insulin, called 50/50 insulin; 75% intermediate-<br>
acting (NPH) and 25% rapid-acting Humalog (lispro), called 75/25 insulin; 70%<br>
intermediate-acting (NPH); and 30% rapid-acting NovoLog (insulin aspart), called<br>
MovoLog Mix 70/30. Insulin usually is given as an injection into the tissues under the<br>
skin (subcutaneous). It can also be given through an insulin pump or jet injector, a<br>
device that sprays the medication into the skin.<br>
Insulin lets sugar (glucose) enter cells, where it is used for energy. Without<br>
insulin, the blood sugar level rises above what is safe for the body. Usually, a rapid- or<br>
short-acting and an intermediate- or long-acting insulin is taken to provide the constant<br>
and variable levels of insulin that the body needs. The short-acting insulin reduces blood<br>
sugar levels quickly and then wears off. Some long-acting insulins start taking effect<br>
when rapid- or short-acting insulins begin to wear off. The new long-acting insulin,<br>
Lantus, starts to work within a few minutes after it is given and continues to work at the<br>
same rate for about 24 hours.<br>
The combination of a rapid- or short-acting and intermediate- or long-acting<br>
insulin helps keep blood sugar levels within a range that is safe for the body throughout<br>
the day. Thus insulin can be used to treat people with type 1 diabetes, people with type 2<br>
diabetes whose pancreas produces little or no insulin or whose oral medications do not<br>

WO 2006/052566                                                                                                    PCT/US2005/039551<br>
control their blood sugar. These people may take insulin either alone or along with oral<br>
medication, people with type 2 diabetes whose blood sugar levels are high because of a<br>
severe illness or major surgery, women with type 2 diabetes who are pregnant or breast-<br>
feeding who cannot keep their blood sugar levels within a safe range with diet and<br>
exercise. Only one oral diabetes medication (glybunde) has been studied for use during<br>
pregnancy.<br>
The major side effect of msulin can be a dangerously low blood sugar level<br>
(severe hypoglycemia). A very low blood sugar level can develop within 10 to 15<br>
minutes. Insulin can contribute to weight gam, especially in people with type 2 who<br>
already are overweight. Other possible side effects of long-term insulin use include rhe<br>
loss of fatty tissue (lipodystrophy) where the insulin is injected and, rarely, allergic<br>
reactions that include swelling (edema).<br>
Statin compounds belong to a class of drugs that lower blood cholesterol levels<br>
by inhibiting hydroxymethylglutalyl Co A (HMG-CoA) reduclase. HMG-CoA xcductase<br>
is the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. A statin that inhibits this<br>
reductase lowers serum LDL concentrations by upreguiatmg the activity of LDL<br>
receptors and responsible for clearing LDL from the blood. Examples of the statm<br>
compounds include rosuvastatin, pravastatin and its sodium salt, svmvastatin. lovastatin,<br>
atorvastatin, fluvastatin, cerivastatin, and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors known in the<br>
art<br>
Squalene synthesis inhibitors belong to a class of drugs that lower blood<br>
cholesterol levels by inhibiting synthesis of squalene. Examples of the squalene<br>
synthesis inhibitors include (S)-a-[Bis[2,2-dimethyl-l-oxopropoxy)methoxy]<br>
phosphJnyll-3-phenoxybenzenebutanesuIfoiuc acid, mono potassium salt (BMS-188494)<br>
and squalene synthesis inhibitors known in the art<br>
Fibrate compounds belong to a class of drugs that lower blood cholesterol levels<br>
by inhibiting synthesis and secretion of triglycerides in the liver and activating a<br>
lipoprotein lipase. Fibrates have been known to activate peroxisomc proliferators-<br>
actjvated receptors and induce lipoprotein lipase expression. Examples of fibrate<br>
compounds include bezafibrate, beclobrate, binifibrate, ciplofibrate, clinofibrate,<br>
clofibrate, clofibric acid, etofibrate, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, nicofibrate, piri fibrate,<br>
ronifibrate, simfibrate, theofibratc, and fibrates known in the art.<br>

LDL (low-density lipoprolein) catabolism enhancers belong to a class of drugs<br>
that lower blood cholesterol levels by increasing the number of LDL (low-density<br>
lipoprotein) receptors, examples include LDL catabohsm enhancers known in the art.<br>
Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors belong to the class of drugs that<br>
partially lower blood glucose levels as well as lowering blood pressure by inliibiting<br>
angiotensin converting enzymes. Examples of the angiotensin converting enzyme<br>
inhibitors include captopril, enalapril, alacepril, delapril; ramipril, hsraopril, imidapnl,<br>
benazepril, ceronapril, cilazapnl, enalaprilat, fosinopnl, movcltopril, perindopril,<br>
quinapril, spirapril, temocapril, trandolapril, and angiotensin converting enzyme<br>
inhibitors known in the art.<br>
Lipase inhibitors include, for example, anti-obesity compounds such as Orlistat<br>
(XEN1CAL™). Orlistal inhibits fat absorption directly but also tends to produce a high<br>
incidence of unpleasant gastric side-effects such as diarrhea and flatulence.<br>
Another class of anti-obesity drugs includes serotonin and/or noradrenaline<br>
releasers or reuptake inhibitors. For example, sibutramine (Meridia™) is a mixed 5-<br>
HT/noradrenalme reuptake inhibitor. The main side effect of sibutramine can be an<br>
increase in blood pressure and heart rate in some patients. The serotonin<br>
releaser/rcuptake inhibitors fcnfluramine (Pondimin™) and dexfenfluramine (ReduxiM)<br>
have been reported to decrease food intake and body weight over a prolonged period<br>
(greater than 6 months). However, both products were withdrawn from use after reports<br>
of preliminary evidence of heart valve abnormalities associated with their use.<br>

The term "in a glucose dependent manner" means that insulin secretion is<br>
increased in response to a high concentration of glucose, but not in response to a low<br>
concentration of glucose. Some drugs that have been used for the treatment of diabetes<br>
increase insulin secretion regardless of the level of glucose in the blood. This is not<br>
68<br><br>
WO 2006/052566                                                                                                    PCT/US2005/039551<br>
desirable because these drugs increase insulin secretion even under conditions of<br>
hypoglycemia. The increased insulin then further exacerbates the hypoglycemia,<br>
sometimes to critical levels. A high concentration of glucose means that the<br>
concentration of glucose in the blood or around cells is higher than a normal glucose<br>
concentration range, for example, 16.8 mmol/L is a high concentration of glucose. A<br>
low concentration of glucose means that the concentration of glucose in the blood or<br>
around cells is lower than a normal glucose concentration range, for example, 3.3<br>
mmol/L or less.<br>
The cellular mechanism of action of insulin secretion is the increase in<br>
intracellular cAMP. As disclosed herein, GPR41 is expressed in pancreatic beta islet<br>
cells. GPR41 is coupled to Gi so an inverse agonist or antagonist of GPR41 will icsult in<br>
an increase in cAMP in pancreatic beta islet cells and an increase in insulin secreiion.<br>
One object of the invention relates to a method of (a) performing a method of the<br>

commonly occurring isotope of such atoms or the more scarce radio-isotope or nonradio-<br>
active isotope.<br>
Synthetic methods for incorporating radio-isotopes into organic compounds<br>
including those applicable to those compounds of the invention are well known in the art<br>
and include incorporating activity levels of tritium into target molecules include. A.<br>
Catalytic Reduction with Tritium Gas - This procedure normally yields high specific<br>
activity products and requires halogenatcd or unsaturated precursors. B.    Reduction<br>
with Sodium Borohydridc [3H] - This procedure is rather inexpensive and requires<br>
precursors containing reducible functional groups such as aldehydes, ketoncs, lactones,<br>
esters, and the like. C.    Reduction with Lithium Aluminum Hydride [}H ] - This<br>
procedure offers products at almost theoretical specific activities. It also requires<br>
precursors containing reducible functional groups such as aldehydes, kelones, lactones,<br>
esters, and the like. D.    Tritium Gas Exposure Labeling - This procedure involves<br>
exposing precursors containing exchangeable protons to tritium gas in the presence of a<br>
suitable catalyst. E.    N-Mcthylation using Methyl Iodide [3H] - This procedure is<br>
usually employed to prepare O-methyl or N-methyl (3II) products by treating appropriate<br>
precursors with high specific activity methyl iodide (3H). This method in general allows<br>
for high specific activity, such as about 80-87 Ci/mmol.<br>
Synthetic methods for incorporating activity levels of 125I into target molecules<br>
include: A.  Sandmeyer and like reactions - This procedure transforms an aryl or<br>
heteroaryl amine into a diazonmm salt, such as a tctrafluoroborate salt, and subsequently<br>
to 125I labelled compound using Nau I. A represented procedure was reported by Zhu,<br>
D.-G. and co-workers in J. Org. Chem 67:943-948 (2002)). B. Ortho 125Iodination of<br>
phenols - This procedure allows for the incorporation of 125I at the ortho position of a<br>
phenol as reported by Collier, T. L. and co-workers in J. Labelled Compd Radiopharm.,<br>

42: S264-S266'(1999)). C. Aryl and heteroaryl bromide; exchange with U51 - This<br>
method is generally a two step process. The first step is the conversion of the aryl or<br>
heteroaryl bromide to the corresponding tri-alkyltin intermediate using for example, a Pd<br>
catalyzed reaction [i.e. Pd(Ph3P)4] or through an aryl or heteroaryl lithium, in the<br>
presence of a tri-alkyltinhalide or hexaalkylditin [e.g., (CH3)3SnSn(Cll3)3]. A<br>
represented procedure was reported by Bas, M.-D. and co-workers in J. Labelled Compd<br>

A radiolabelled GPR41 compound of Table 1 or Table 2 can be used in a<br>
screening assay to identify/evaluate compounds. In general terms, a newly synthesized<br>
or identified compound (i.e., candidate compound) can be evaluated for its ability to<br>
reduce binding of the "radio-labelled compound of Table 1 or Table 2" to the GPR41<br>
receptor. Accordingly, the ability of a candidate compound to compete with the "radio-<br>
labelled compound of Table 1 or Table 2" for the binding to the GPR41 receptor directly<br>
correlates to its binding affinity.<br>

GPR41(k) is a single arnino acid mutation of GPR41 where amino acid 224 is mutated to<br>
a lysine.<br>
Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine transfection reagent<br>
(Invitrogen) and following manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, on day 1 cells<br>
were plated on 96-well plates at a density of 3xlO6 cells/plate. On the following day a<br>
DNA/Lipofectamine mixture was prepared for each plate as follows: 1 uL of DNA (40ng<br>
of pCMV-GPR41) per 3 wells, or 2uL of DNA (20ng of pCMV-GPR41 combined with<br>
pcDNA-Gq/Gi) in 25pL of OPTI-MEM (Gibco) was gently mixed with 2uL of<br>
Lipofectamine reagent in 25p.L of OPTI-MEM and the resulting solution was incubated<br>
for 30 minutes at room temperature. 96pX of OPTI-MEM was added to give a final<br>
volume of 150pX. Cells were then washed once with lOOuL/well of PBS, and DN A-<br>
Liptofectamine mixture was tihen gently added to the plate (50p.L/well). The cells weio<br>
then incubated for 4 hours at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5%CO2<br>
Regular cell media was added to the transfection reagent.   Cells were then incubated ax<br>
37°C /5%CO2 overnight.<br>
On day 3, regular growth media was carefully removed from wells and replaced<br>
with lOOuX, of inositol-free/serum-free DMEM (Gibco) containing 0.4uCi of [3H]-myo-<br>
inositol (Perkin-Elmer). Cells were incubated overnight at 37°C with 5%CO?. On day 4,<br>
[3H]-myo-inositol-containing labeling media was removed and replaced with 100(.iL of<br>
inositol-free/serum-free DMEM containing l0uM parglyline (Sigma) and 10 mM lithium<br>
chloride (Sigma). Cells were incubated for 1 hour at 37°C /5%CO2- Solution was then<br>
carefully removed and 160 pX per well of ice cold 0.1M formic acid was added to the<br>
cells. The cells were lysed by incubating plates at -80°C for at least 1 hour.<br>
Separation of IP3 from cell lysates was performed using chromatography on<br>
AG1-X8 formate resin (Bio-Rad). 400p.L of formate resin slurry (0. lg of resin in lmL<br>
of water) was added per each well of Multiscreen filter plate (Milliporc). Water was<br>
drained from the wells and resin was then washed with 200 μL of water using Millipore<br>
filtration unit. Plates with lyscd cells were thawed and lysates were transferred into<br>

G-alpha 12/13 coupling of GPR41<br>
In this example, the coupling of GPR41 to G-alpha 12/13 (Gal2/13) was<br>
determined using a cAMP assay as described below.<br>
Briefly, the experiment was performed as follows: 293 cells were transfeclcd<br>
with the indicated CMV-drivcn expression plasmul indicated on the X-axis, alonjj with<br>
one of the following chimeras: (a) "control": parental CMV expression plasnud, (b)<br>
"Gs/G12 chimera": CMV-Gs/G12 plasmid encoding human Gs in which the C-temimai<br>
11 amino acids were switched to those corresponding to the C-tcrminus of GI2. or (c)<br>
"Gs/G13 chimera": CMV-Gs/G13 plasmid encoding human Gs in which the C-terminal<br>
11 amino acids were switched to those corresponding to the C-terminus of G13. 24-<br>
hours later, the cells were analyzed for cAMP levels using a "Flash Plate" kit as<br>
described below.<br>
A Flash Plate™ Adcnylyl Cyclase kit (New England Nuclear; Cat. No.<br>
SMP004A) designed for cell-based assays was modified for use with crude plasma<br>
membranes. The Flash Plate wells contained a scmtillant coating which also contains a<br>
specific antibody recognizing cAMP. The cAMP generated in the wells was quantitalcd<br>
by a direct competition for binding of radioactive cAMP tracer to the cAMP antibody.<br>
The following serves as a brief protocol for the measurement of changes in cAMP levels<br>
in whole cells that express GPR41.<br>
Transfected cells were harvested approximately twenty four hours aftei transient<br>
transfection. Media was carefully aspirated off and discarded. 5ml of cell dissociation<br>
buffer was added to each plate. Cells were pipetted off the plate and the cell suspension<br>
was collected into a 50ml conical centrifuge tube. Cells were then centrifuged at room<br>
temperature at 1,100 rpm for 5 minutes. The cell pellet was carefully re-suspended into<br>
an appropriate volume of Assay Buffer which consisted of lA vol of PBS and Vi vol of<br>
stimu jtion buffer (about 3ml/plate). The cells were then counted using a<br>

hemocytometer and additional assay buffer was added to give the appropriate number of<br>
cells (with a final volume of about 50ul/well).<br>
cAMP standards and Detection Buffer (comprising 1 LICI of tracer [12bI] cAMP<br>
(50ul) to 11ml Detection Buffer) was prepared and maintained in accordance with the<br>
manufacturer's instructions.  The assay was initiated by additi on of 50ul of cAMP<br>
standards to appropriate wells followed by addition of 50ul of PBS to wells HI 1 and<br>
H12 of a 96 well plate. 50ml of Stimulation Buffer was added to all standard wells. The<br>
cells were added to the appropriated wells. Forskolm was diluted with Assay Buffer into<br>
2x stock, then added to the cells at 50ul /well and incubated for 60 minutes at room<br>
temperature. 1 OOul of Detection Mix containing tracer cAMP was then added to the<br>
wells. Plates were then mcubated an additional 2 hours followed by counting in a<br>
Wallac MicroBeta scintillation counter  Values of cAMP/well were then extrapolated<br>
from a standard cAMP curve which was contained within each assay plate.<br>

Identification of GPR41 Modulators<br>
In this example, GPR41 agonists were identified using a screening protocol in<br>
Xenopus melanophores.<br>
Melanophorc Technology<br>
Melanophores are skin cells found in lower vertebrates. They contain pigmented<br>
organelles termed melanosomes. Melanophores arc able to redistribute these<br>
melanosomes along a microtubule network upon G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)<br>
activation. The result of this pigment movement is an apparent lightening or darkening<br>
of the cells. In melanophores, the decreased levels of mtracellular cAMP that result from<br>
activation of a Gi-coupled receptor cause melanosomes to migrate to the center of the<br>
cell, resulting in a dramatic lightening in color. If cAMP levels are then raised,<br>
following activation of a Gs-coupled receptor, the melanosomes are re-dispersed and the<br>
cells appear dark again. The increased levels of diacylglycerol that result from activation<br>
of Gq-coupled receptors can also induce tills re-dispersion. In addition, the technology is<br>
also suited to the study of certain receptor tyrosme kinases. The response of the<br>
melanophores takes place within minutes of receptor activation and results in a simple,<br>
robust color change. The response can be easily detected using a conventional<br>
absorbance microplate reader or a modest video imaging system. Unlike other skin cells,<br>
the melanophores derive from the neural crest and appear to express a full complement<br>

WO 2006/052566                                                                                                    PCT/US2005/039551<br>
of signaling proteins. In particular, the cells express an extremely wide range of G-<br>
proteins and so are able to functionally express almost all GPCRs.<br>
Melanophores can be utilized to identify compounds, including natural ligands,<br>
which bind to and/or activate GPCRs. This method can be conducted by introducing test<br>
cells of a pigment cell line capable of dispersing or aggregating their pigment in response<br>
to a specific stimulus and expressing an exogenous clone coding for the GPCR. An<br>
initial stale of pigment disposition can be set using, for example, using melatonin, MSI I<br>
or light. The test cells are then contacted with chemical compounds, and it is determined<br>
whether the pigment disposition in the cells changed from the initial state of pigment<br>
disposition. Dispersion of pigments cells due to the candidate compound, including bin<br>
not limited to a ligand, coupling to the GPCR will appear dark on a petn dish, while<br>
aggregation of pigments cells will appear light.<br>
Materials and methods were followed according to the disclosure of U.S. Patent<br>
Number 5,462,856 and U.S. Patent Number 6,051,386  These patent disclosures are<br>
hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
Melanophores were transfected by electroporation with a plasmid which<br>
contained the coding sequence of human GPR41. The cells were plated in 96-well<br>
plates  48 hours posl-transfection, half of the cells on each plate were treated with 10nM<br>
melatonin. Melatonin activates an endogenous Gi-coupled receptor in the melanophores<br>
and causes them to aggregate their pigment. The remaining half of the cells were<br>
transferred to serum-free medium 0.7X L-15 (Gibco). After one hour, the cells in serum-<br>
free media remained in a pigment-dispersed state while the melatonin-treated cells were<br>
m a pigment-aggregated state. At this point, the cells were treated with different<br>
compounds from a proprietary compound library containing 140,000-150,000 organic<br>
small molecule compounds. If GPR41 bound to the compound, the melanophores would<br>
be expected to undergo a color change in response to the compound. Since the receptor<br>
can couple to Gi, the pigment-dispersed cells underwent a dose-dependent pigment<br>
aggregation.<br>

Transfections were performed using Lipofbctamine transfection reagent<br>
(Invitrogen) and following manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, on day 1 cells<br>
were plated on 96-well plates at a density of 4x106 cells/plate  On the following day a<br>
DNA/Lipofectamine mixture was prepared for each plate as follows: 2.5 uL of DNA<br>
(250ng of pCMV-GPR41 or pCMV blank vector) per 8 wells and 2.5uL of DNA (250ng<br>
of pcDNA 3.1-Gq/Gi) in 200uL of DME (Gibco) was gently mixed with 2.5uL of<br>
Lipofectaminc reagent in 200uL of DME and the resulting solution was incubated foi 30<br>
minutes at room temperature. Growth media was aspirated off from the cells and<br>
55JJ.1/WC11 of DME were added. DNA-Liptofectamine mixture was then gently added Lo<br>
the plate (45μl/well). The cells were then incubated for 4 hours at 37°C in a humidified<br>
atmosphere containing 5%CO2. Regular cell growth media was added to the transfection<br>
reagent.   Cells were then incubated at 37°C /5%CO2 overnight.<br>
On day 3, regular growth media was carefully removed from wells and replaced<br>
with lOOuL of inositol-free/serum-free DMEM (Gibco) containing 0.4u.Ci of [3H]-myo-<br>
inositol (Perkin-Elmer). Cells were incubated overnight at 37°C with 5%CO2. On day 4,<br>
[3H]-myo-inositol-conlaining labeling media was removed and replaced with 100 μL of<br>
inositol-free/serum-free DMEM containing 10ΜM parglyline (Sigma) and 10 mM lithium<br>
chloride (Sigma) with/out compound. Cells were incubated for 3 hours at 37°C /5%CO2.<br>
Solution was then carefully removed and 160 μL per well of ice cold 0.1M formic acid<br>
was added to the cells. The cells were lysed by incubating plates at -80°C for at least 1<br>
hour.<br>
Separation of IP3 from cell lysates was performed using chromatography on<br>
AG1-X8 formate resin (Bio-Rad). 400 μL of formate resin slurry (0.lg of resin in l mL<br>
of water) was added per each well of Multiscreen filter plate (Millipore). Water was<br>
drained from the wells and resin was then washed with 200uL of water using Millipore<br>
filtration unit. Plates with lysed cells were thawed and lysates were transferred into<br>
Multiscreen filter plate, containing formate resin. Plates were incubated for 10 minutes<br>
at room temperature and lysates were then drained from filter plates with filtration unit.<br>
Plates were washed four times with water (200nL/well) and thoroughly drained. Elution<br>

Mouse insulinoma line, MCN6, was plated into multi-well tissue culture dishes<br>
and cultured 2 days m Dulbecco's Minimum Essential Media (DMEM) supplemented<br>
with 15% fetal bovine serum. The cells were rinsed and fasted in low glucose (lOmg/dl)<br>

300mg/dl glucose and the compounds of interest: glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and<br>
cyclopropanecarboxylic acid (CPC). GLP-1, 7-36 amide, a known inhibitor of insulin<br>
secretion, was purchased from Sigma and used at 25 nM concentration and CPC was<br>
purchased from Aldrich and was used at 5 μM or 1 uM. Control wells with glucose only<br>
(both lOmg/dl and 300mg/dl) were run for comparison. Supernatants from the glucose<br>

Oral Glucose Tolerance Test<br>
A GPR41 modulator such as an agonist, antagonist or inverse agonist can be<br>
tested for its effect on plasma glucose after oral glucose administration is tested.<br>
For example, male C57bl/6 mice at age 67 days can be fasted for 18 hours and<br>
randomly grouped to receive a GPR41 modulator at selected doses, or vehicle (PET<br>
which contains 80% PEG, 10% Tween80, and 10% Ethanol). The GPR41 modulator is<br>
delivered orally via a gavagc needle (p.o. volume at 100 u.1). Thirty minutes after<br>
administration of the GPR41 modulator or vehicle, mice are administered orally with<br>
dextrose at 3 g/kg dose. Levels of blood glucose are determined at several rime points<br>
using Glucometer Elite XL (Bayer).<br>
Glucose tolerance can also be tested using i.p. delivery of glucose. For example,<br>
68 day old male C57B1/6 mice are treated with a GPR41 modulator at 100 mg/kg or with<br>

Assays for Determination of GPCR Activation<br>
A variety of approaches are available for assessment of activation of human<br>
GPCRs. The following are illustrative; those of ordinary skill in the art are credited with<br>
the ability to determine those techniques that are preferentially beneficial for the needs of<br>
the artisan.<br>
1. Membrane Binding Assays: [35SlGTPyS Assay<br>
When a G protein-coupled receptor is in its active state, cither as a result of<br>
ligand binding or constitutive activation, the receptor couples to a G protein and<br>
stimulates the release of GDP and subsequent binding of GTP to the G protein. The<br>
alpha subunit of the G protein-receptor complex acts as a GTPase and slowly hydrolyzes<br>
82<br><br>
WO 2006/052566                                                                                                    PCT/US2005/039551<br>
the GTP to GDP, at which point the receptor normally is deactivated. Activated<br>
receptors continue to exchange GDP for GTP. The non-hydrolyzable GTP analog,<br>
[35S]GTPyS, can be utilized to demonstrate enhanced binding of [35S]GTPyS to<br>
membranes expressing activated receptors. The advantage of using [j5S]GTPyS binding<br>
to measure activation is that: (a) it is genencally applicable to all G protein-coupled<br>
receptors; (b) it is proximal at the membrane surface making it less likely to pick-up<br>
molecules which affect the intracellular cascade.<br>
The assay utilizes the ability of G protein coupled receptors to stimulate<br>
[35SJGTPyS binding to membranes expressing the relevant receptors. The assay can,<br>
therefore, be used m the direct identification method to screen candidate compounds to<br>
endogenous GPCRs and non-endogenous, constitutively activated GPCRs. The assay is<br>
generic and has application to drug discovery at all G protein-coupled receptors.<br>
The [35S]GTPyS assay is incubated in 20 mM HEPES and between 1 and about<br>
20mM MgCl2 (this amount can be adjusted for optimization of results, although 20mM is<br>
preferred) pH 7.4, binding buffer with between about 0.3 and about 1.2 nM [35S]GTP7S<br>
(this amount can be adjusted for optimization of results, although 1.2 is preferred) and<br>
12.5 to 75 fig membrane protein (e.g, 293 cells expressing the GPR41; this amount can<br>
be adjusted for optimization) and 10 JJM GDP (this amount can be changed for<br>
optimization) for 1 hour. Wheatgerm agglutmin beads (25 ul; Amersham) are then<br>
added and the mixture incubated for another 30 mmutes at room temperature. The tubes<br>
are then centrifuged at 1500 x g for 5 minutes at room temperature and then counted in a<br>
scintillation counter.<br>
2. Adenylyl Cyclasc<br>
A Flash Plate™ Adenylyl Cyclasc kit (New England Nuclear; Cat No.<br>
SMP004A) designed for cell-based assays can be modified for use with crude plasma<br>
membranes. The Flash Plate wells can contain a scintillant coating which also contains a<br>
specific antibody recognizing cAMP. The cAMP generated in the wells can be<br>
quantitated by a direct competition for binding of radioactive cAMP tracer to the cAMP<br>
antibody. The following serves as a brief protocol for the measurement of changes in<br>
cAMP levels in whole cells that express a receptoi.<br>
Transfected cells are harvested approximately twenty four hours after transient<br>
transfection. Media is carefully aspirated off and discarded   10ml of PBS is genlly<br>
added to each dish of cells followed by careful aspiration, lml of Sigma cell dissociation<br>
buffer and 3ml of PBS are added to each plate. Cells are pipetted off the plate and the<br>

cell suspension is collected into a 50ml conical centrifuge tube. Cells are then<br>
centrifuged at room temperature at 1,100 rpm for 5 minutes   The cell pellet is carefully<br>
re-suspended into an appropriate volume of PBS (about 3ml/plate). The cells are then<br>
counted using a hemocytometer and additional PBS is added to give the appropriate<br>
number of cells (with a final volume of about 50ul/well).<br>
cAMP standards and Detection Buffer (comprising lμCi of tracer [125lj cAMP<br>
(50u,l) to 1 lml Detection Buffer) is prepared and maintained in accordance with the<br>
manufacturer's instructions  Assay Buffer is prepared fresh for screening and contains<br>
50μl of Stimulation Buffer, 3μl of candidate compound (12ΜM final assay concentration)<br>
and 50fil cells. Assay Buffer is stored on ice until utilized. The assay, preferably carried<br>
out, for example, in a 96-well plate, is initiated by addition of 50μl of cAMP standards to<br>
appropriate wells followed by addition of 50ul of PBSA to wells HI 1 and 1112. 50μl of<br>
Stimulation Buffer is added to all wells. DMSO (or selected candidate compounds) is<br>
added to appropriate wells using a pin tool capable of dispensing 3μl of compound<br>
solution, with a final assay concentration of 12uM candidate compound and 100ΜL total<br>
assay volume. The cells are then added to the wells and incubated for 60 minutes at<br>
room temperature. 100μl of Detection Mix containing tracer cAMP is then added to the<br>
wells. Plates are then incubated additional 2 hours followed by counting m a Wallac<br>
MicroBeta scintillation counter. Values of cAMP/well are then extrapolated from a<br>
standard cAMP curve which is contained within each assay plate.<br>
3.        Cell-Based cAMP for Gi Coupled Target GPCRs<br>
TSHR is a Gs coupled GPCR that causes the accumulation of cAMP upon<br>
activation. TSHR can be constitutivcly activated by mutating ammo acid residue 623<br>
(i.e., changing an alanine residue to an isoleucine residue)   A Gi coupled receptor is<br>
expected to inhibit adenylyl cyclasc, and, therefore, decrease the level of cAMP<br>
production, which can make assessment of cAMP levels challenging. An effective<br>
technique for measuring the decrease m production of cAMP as an indication of<br>
activation of a Gi coupled receptor can be accomplished by co-transfectmg, non-<br>
endogenous, constitutively activated TSHR (TSHR-A623I) (or an endogenous,<br>
constitutively active Gs coupled receptor) as a "signal enhancer" with a Gi linked target<br>
GPCR to establish a baseline level of cAMP. Upon creating an endogenous or non-<br>
endogenous version of the Gi coupled receptor, the target GPCR is then co-transfected<br>
with the signal enhancer, and it is this material that can be used for screening. In some<br>
embodiments, this approach is preferably used in the direct identification of candidate<br>

WO 2006/052566                                                                                                    PCT/US2005/039551<br>
compounds against Gi coupled receptors. It is noted that for a Gi coupled GPCR, when<br>
this approach is used, an inverse agonist of the target GPCR will increase the cAMP<br>
signal and an agonist will decrease the cAMP signal.<br>
On day one, 2 x 104 293 cells/well are plated out. On day two. two reaction tubes<br>

mixing 2]ag DNA of each receptor transfected into the mammalian cells, for a total of<br>
4μg DNA (e.g., pCMV vector, pCMV vector with mutated THSR (TSHR-A6231);<br>
TSHR-A623I and GPCR, etc.) m 1 2ml serum free DMEM (Irvine Scientific, Irvine,<br>
CA); tube B is prepared by mixing 120ul lipofectamine (Gibco BRL) in 1.2ml serum<br>
free DMEM. Tubes A and B are then admixed by inversions (several times), followed<br>
by incubation at room temperature for 30-45minutes. The admixture is referred to as the<br>
"transfection mixture". Plated 293 cells arc washed with 1XPBS, followed by addition<br>
of 10ml serum free DMEM. 2 4ml of the transfection mixture is then added to the cells,<br>
followed by incubation for 4 hours at 37°C/5% CO2. The transfection mixture is then<br>
removed by aspiration, followed by the addition of 25ml of DMEM/10% Fetal Bovine<br>
Serum. Cells are then incubated at 37°C/5% CO2. After 24 hours incubation, cells are<br>
harvested and utilized for analysis.<br>
A Flash Plate™ Adenylyl Cyclasc kit (New England Nuclear: Cat No.<br>
SMP004A) is designed for cell-based assays, but can be modified for use with crude<br>
plasma membranes depending on the need of the skilled artisan. The Flash Plate wells<br>
contain a scintillant coating which also contains a specific antibody recognizing cAMP.<br>
The cAMP generated in the wells can be quantitated by a direct competition for binding<br>
of radioactive cAMP tracer to the cAMP antibody. The following serves as a brief<br>
protocol for the measurement of changes in cAMP levels in whole cells that express a<br>
receptor of interest.<br>
Transfected cells are harvested approximately twenty four hours after transient<br>
transfection  Media is carefully aspirated off and discarded. 10ml of PBS is gently<br>
added to each dish of cells followed by careful aspiration. 1ml of Sigma cell dissociation<br>
buffer and 3ml of PBS is added to each plate. Cells are pipetted off the plate and the cell<br>
suspension is collected into a 50ml conical centrifuge tube. Cells are then centrifuged at<br>
room temperature at 1,100 rpm for 5 minutes. The cell pellet is carefully re-suspended<br>
into an appropriate volume of PBS (about 3ml/plate). The cells are then counted using a<br>
hemocytometer and additional PBS is added to give the appropriate number of cells<br>
(with a final volume of about 50μl/well).<br>

a.         GPCR:Gs Fusion Constuct<br>
The design of the GPCR-G protem fusion construct can be accomplished as<br>
follows: both the 5' and 3' ends of the rat G protem Gscc (long form;. Itoh, H. el al., Proc.<br>
Natl. Acad Sci 83:3776 (1986)) are engineered to include a HindHI sequence thereon.<br>
Following confirmation of the correct sequence (including the flanking Hindlll<br>
sequences), the entire sequence is shuttled into pcDNA3.1(-) (Invitrogen, cat no. V795-<br>
20) by subclorung using the Hindlll restriction site of that vector. The correct orientation<br>
for the Gsa sequence is determined after subcloning into pcDNA3.1(-). The modified<br>
pcDNA3.1(-) containing the rat Gsa gene at HindlH sequence is then verified, this<br>
vector is now available as a "universal" Gsa protein vector. The pcDNAS.l(-) vector<br>
contains a variety of well-known restriction sites upstream of the Hindlll site, Lhus<br>
beneficially providing the ability to insert, upstream of the Gs protein, the coding<br>
sequence of a receptor of interest. This same approach can be utilized to create other<br>
"universal" G protein vectors, and, of course, other commercially available or proprietary<br>
vectors known to the artisan can be utilized—the important criteria is that the sequence<br>
for the GPCR be upstream and in-frame with that of the G protein.<br>
b.         Gq(6 amino acid deletion)/Gi Fusion Construct<br>
The design of a Gq(del)/Gi fusion construct can be accomplished as follows: the<br>
N-terminal six (6) amino acids (amino acids 2 through 7, having the sequence of<br>
TLESIM (SEQ ID NO:11)) of Gocq-subunit is deleted and the C-terminal five (5) amino<br>
acids having the sequence EYNLV (SEQ ID NO: 12) is replaced with the corresponding<br>
amino acids of the Goci Protein, having the sequence DCGLF (SEQ ID NO-13). This<br>
fusion construct can be obtained by PCR using the following primers:<br>
5'-gatcAAGCTTCCATGGCGTGCTGCCTGAGCGAGGAG-3' (SEQ ID<br>
NO: 14) and<br>
51-<br>
gatcGGATCCTTAGAACAGGCCGCAGTCCTTCAGGTTCAGCTGCAGGATGGTG-<br>
3' (SEQ ID NO:15)<br>
and Plasmid 63313 which contains the mouse Gaq-wild type version with a<br>
hemagglutinin tag as template. Nucleotides in lower caps are included as spacers.<br>
TaqPlus Precision DNA polymerase (Stratagene) can be utilized for the<br>
amplification by the following cycles, with steps 2 through 4 repeated 35 times: 95°C for<br>
2 min; 95°C for 20 sec; 56°C for 20 sec; 72°C for 2 min; and 72°C for 7 mm. The PCR<br>
product can be cloned into a pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced using the<br>

pH 7.4; "Membrane Wash Buffer" is comprised of 20mM HEPES and O.lmM EDTA,<br>
pH 7.4; "Binding Buffer" is comprised of 20mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, and 10 mM<br>
MgCl2, pH 7 4.<br>
b.         Procedure<br>
All materials are kept on ice throughout the procedure. Firstly, the media is<br>
aspirated from a confluent monolayer of cells, followed by rinsing with 10ml cold PBS,<br>
followed by aspiration. Thereafter, 5ml of Membrane Scrape Buffer is added to scrape<br>
cells; this is followed by transfer of cellular extract into 50ml centrifuge tubes<br>
(centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 17 minutes at 4°C). Thereafter, the supernatant is<br>
aspirated and the pellet is resuspended m 30ml Membrane Wash Buffer followed by<br>
centrifuge at 20,000 rpm for 17 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant is then aspirated and the<br>
pellet resuspended in Binding Buffer. This is then homogenized using a Brinkman<br>
Polytron™ homogenizer (15-20 second bursts until the all material is m suspension)<br>
This is referred to herein as "Membrane Protein".<br>
Bradford Protein Assay<br>
Following the homogenization, protein concentration of the membranes is<br>
determined using the Bradford Protein Assay (protein can be diluted to about 1.5mg/ml,<br>
aliquoted and frozen (-80°C) for later use; when frozen, protocol for use will be as<br>
follows: on the day of the assay, frozen Membrane Pro tern is thawed at room<br>
temperature, followed by vortex and then homogenized with a Polytron at about 12 x<br>

Binding Buffer (as per above); Bradford Dye Reagent; Bradford Prolem Standard<br>
is utilized, following manufacturer instructions (Biorad, cat. no. 500-0006).<br>
b.         Procedure<br>
Duplicate tubes are prepared, one including the membrane, and one as a control<br>
"blank". Each tube contains 800ul Binding Buffer. Thereafter, 10μl of Bradford Proiem<br>
Standard (lmg/ml) is added to each tube, and lOul of membrane Protein is then added lo<br>
just one tube (not the blank). Thereafter, 200ul of Bradford Dye Reagent is added to<br>
each tube, followed by vortexing of each tube. After five (5) minutes, the tubes are re-<br>
vortexed and the material therein is transferred to cuvettes. The cuvettes are read using a<br>
CECIL 3041 spectrophotometer, at wavelength 595.<br>
Identification Assay<br>
a.         Materials<br>
GDP Buffer consists of 37.5ml Binding Buffer and 2mg GDP (Sigma, cat. no. G-<br>
7127), followed by a series of dilutions in Binding Buffer to obtain 0.2 uM GDP (final<br>
concentration of GDP in each well is 0.1 uM GDP), each well comprising a candidate<br>
compound has a final volume of 200ul consisting of lOOul GDP Buffer (final<br>
concentration, 0.1 uM GDP), 50ul Membrane Protein in Binding Buffer, and 50ul<br>
[J5S]GTPyS (0.6 nM) in Binding Buffer (2.5 ul [35S]GTPyS per 10ml Binding Buffer).<br>
b.         Procedure<br>
Candidate compounds can be screened using a 96-well plate format (these can be<br>
frozen at -80°C). Membrane Protein (or membranes with expression vector excluding<br>
the Target GPCR, as control), are homogenized briefly until in suspension. Protein<br>
concentration is be determined using the Bradford Protein Assay set forth above<br>
Membrane Protein (and control) is diluted to 0.25mg/ml in Binding Buffer (final assay<br>
concentration, 12.5ug/well). Thereafter, lOOul GDP Buffer is added to each well of a<br>
Wallac Scintistrip1M (Wallac). A 5ul pin-tool is used to transfer 5 ul of a candidate<br>
compound into such well (i.e., 5μl in total assay volume of 200 ul is a 1:40 ratio such<br>
that the final screening concentration of the candidate compound is lOuM). Again, to<br>
avoid contamination, after each transfer step the pm tool should be rinsed in three<br>
reservoirs comprising water (IX), ethanol (IX) and water (2X) - excess liquid should be<br>

shaken from the tool after each nnse and dried with paper and kimwipes. Thereafter.<br>
50ul of Membrane Protein is added to each well (a control well comprising membranes<br>
without the Target GPCR is also utilized), and prc-mcubated for 5-] 0 minutes at room<br>
temperature. Thereafter, 50|il of [35S]GTPyS (0.6 nM) in Binding Buffer is added to<br>
each well, followed by incubation on a shaker for 60 mmutes at room temperature (plates<br>
arc covered with foil). The assay is then stopped by spinning of the plates at 4000 RPM<br>
for 15 minutes at 22°C. The plates are aspirated with an 8 channel manifold and sealed<br>
with plate covers. The plates arc read on a Wallac 1450 using setting "Prol #37" (as per<br>
manufacturer's instructions).<br>

centrifuged at 49,000 X g for 15 minutes at 4°C. The resulting pellet is then resuspended<br>
in buffer containing 20mM HEPES, pH 7.4 and 0.1 mM EDTA, homogenized for 10<br>
seconds, followed by ccntrifugation at 49,000 x g for 15 minutes at 4°C. The resulting<br>
pellet is then stored at -80°C until utilized. On the day of direct identification screening,<br>
the membrane pellet is slowly thawed at room temperature, resuspended in buffer<br>
containing 20mM HEPES, pH 7.4 and 10mM MgCl2, to yield a final protein<br>
concentration of 0.60mg/ml (the resuspended membranes are placed on ice until use).<br>

coupled to Gal2/13 (see Example 5 and Figure 5), a promiscuous G protein such as<br>
Gal5, Gal6, or the chimeric Gq/Gi alpha subunit may not be required in order to cause a<br>
detectable calcium flux. To prepare Fluo4-AM (Molecular Probe, #F14202) incubation<br>
buffer stock, 1 mg Fluo4-AM is dissolved in 467/xl DMSO and 467/xl Pluoronic acid<br>
(Molecular Probe, #P3000) to give a lmM stock solution that can be stored at -20°C for<br>
a month.  Fluo4-AM is a fluorescent calcium indicator dye.<br>
Candidate compounds arc prepared in wash buffer (IX HBSS/2.5mM<br>
Probenicid/20mM HEPES at pH 7.4).<br>
At the time of assay, culture medium is removed from the wells and the celis are<br>
loaded with 100/xl of 4fM Fluo4-AM/2.5 mM Probenicid (Sigma, #P8761)/20mM<br>
HEPES/complete medium at pH 7.4. Incubation at 37°C/5% CO2 is allowed to proceed<br>
for 60 minutes.<br>

After the 1 hour incubation, the Fluo4-AM incubation buffer is removed and the<br>
cells are washed 2X with 100 /xl wash buffer. In each well is left 100 [d wash buffer.<br>
The plate is returned to the incubator at 37°C/5% CO2 for 60 minutes.<br>
FLIPR (Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader; Molecular Device) is programmed lo<br>
add 50 μl candidate compound on the 30th second and to record transient changes m<br>
mtracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2-s-J) evoked by the candidate compound for<br>
another 150 seconds. Total fluorescence change counts arc used to determine agonist<br>
activity using the FLIPR software. The instrument software normalizes the fluorescent<br>
reading to give equivalent initial readings at zero.<br>
Although the foregoing provides a FLIPR assay for agomst activity using stably<br>
transfected cells, a person of ordinary skill in the art would readily be able to modify the<br>
assay in order to characterize antagonist activity. Said person of ordinary skill in the art<br>
would also readily appreciate that, alternatively, transiently transfected cells could be<br>
used.<br>
Example 17<br>
MAP Kinase Assay<br>
MAP kinase (mitogen activated kinase) can be monitored to evaluate receptor<br>
activation. MAP kinase can be detected by several approaches   One approach is based<br>
on an evaluation of the phosphorylation state, either unphosphorylated (inactive) or<br>
phosphorylatcd (active). The phosphorylated protein has a slower mobility in SDS-<br>
PAGE and can therefore be compared with the unstimulated protein using Western<br>
blotting. Alternatively, antibodies specific for the phosphorylated protein are available<br>
(New England Biolabs) which can be used to detect an increase in the phosphorylaled<br>
kinase. In either method, cells are stimulated with the candidate compound and then<br>
extracted with Laemmli buffer. The soluble fraction is applied to an SDS-PAGE gel and<br>
proteins are transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose or Immobilin.<br>
tmmunoreactive bands are detected by standard Western blotting technique. Visible or<br>
chemiluminescent signals are recorded on film and can be quantified by densitometry.<br>
Another approach is based on evaluation of the MAP kinase activity via a<br>
phosphorylation assay. Cells are stimulated with the candidate compound and a soluble<br>
extract is prepared. The extract is incubated at 30°C for 10 minutes with gamma-j2P-<br>
ATP, an ATP regenerating system, and a specific substrate for MAP kinase such as<br>
94<br><br>
WO 2006/052566                                                                                                    PCT/US2005/039551<br>
phosphorylated heat and acid stable protein regulated by insulin, or PHAS-I. The<br>
reaction is terminated by the addition of H3PO4 and samples are transferred to ice. An<br>
aliquot is spotted onto Whatman P81 chromatography paper, which retains the<br>
phosphorylated protein. The chromatography paper is washed and counted for 32P is a<br>
liquid scintillation counter. Alternatively, the cell extract is incubated with gamma-j2P-<br>
ATP, an ATP regenerating system, and biotinylated myelin basic proem bound by<br>
streptavidin to a filter support. The myelin basic protein is a substrate for activated MAP<br>
kinase. The phosphorylation reaction is earned out for 10 minutes at 30°C. The extiact<br>
can then be aspirated through the filter, which retains, the phosphorylated myelin basic<br>
protein. The filter is washed and counted for 32P bv liquid scintillation counting.<br>
Example 18<br>
Receptor Binding Assay<br>
In addition to the methods described herein, another means for evaluating a<br>
candidate compound is by determining binding affinities to the GPR41 receptor. This<br>
type of assay generally requires a radiolabelled ligand to the GPR41 receptor. In<br>
addition to the use of known ligands for the GPR41 receptor and radiolabels thereof,<br>
GPR41 agonist compounds disclosed herein can be labelled with a radioisotope and used<br>
in an assay for evaluating the affinity of a candidate compound to the GPR41 receptor.<br>
A radiolabelled GPR41 compound such as a GPR41 agonist disclosed herein can<br>
be used in a screening assay to identify/evaluate compounds. In general terms, a newly<br>
synthesized or identified compound (i.e., candidate compound) can be evaluated tor its<br>
ability to reduce binding of the radiolabelled GPR41 agonist to the GPR41 receptor.<br>
Accordingly, the ability to compete with the radiolabelled GPR41 agonist for the binding<br>
to the GPR41 receptor directly correlates to the binding affinity of the candidate<br>
compound to the GPR41 receptor.<br>
ASSAY PROTOCOL FOR DETERMINING RECEPTOR BINDING FOR GPR41 :<br>
A.       GPR41 RECEPTOR PREPARATION<br>
For example, HEK293 cells (human ladney, ATCC) can be transiently or stably<br>
transfectcd with GPR41 as described herein. For example, 293 cells can be transiently<br>
transfected with 10 ug human GPR41 receptor and 60 ul Lipofectamine (per 15-cm<br>
dish), and grown in the dish for 24 hours (75% confluency) with a media change. Cells<br>
are removed with 10ml/dish of Hepes-EDTA buffer (20mM Hepes +10 mM EDTA, pH<br>
7.4). The cells are then centnfuged in a Beckman Coulter centrifuge for 20 minutes,<br>
95<br><br>
WO 2006/052566                                                                                                    PCT/US2005/039551<br>
17,000 rpm (JA-25.50 rotor). Subsequently, the pellet is rcsuspended m 20mM<br>
Hepes + 1 mM EDTA, pH 7 4 and homogenized with a 50- ml Dounce homogemzer and<br>
again ccntrifuged. After removing the supernatant, the pellets are stored at -80°C, until<br>
used m binding assay. When used m the assay, membranes arc thawed on ice for<br>
20 minutes and then 10mL of incubation buffer (20mM Hepes. lmM MgCl2,100mM<br>
NaCl, pH 7.4) is added. The membranes are then vortexed to resuspend the crude<br>
membrane pellet and homogenized with a Bnnkmann PT-3100 Polytron homogemzer<br>
for 15 seconds at setting 6. The concentration of membrane protein is determined using<br>
the BRL Bradford protein assay.<br>
B.        BINDING ASSAY<br>
For total binding, a total volume of 50ΜL of appropriately diluted membranes<br>
(diluted in assay buffer containing 50mM Tns HC1 (pH 7.4), lOmM MgCb, and lmM<br>
EDTA; 5-50μg protein) is added to 96-wcll polyproylene microtiter plates followed by<br>
addition of 100μl of assay buffer and 50ul of radiolabelled GPR41 agonist   For<br>
nonspecific binding, 50ul of assay buffer is added instead of 100μl and an additional<br>
50μl of 10μM cold GPR41 is added before 50ul of radiolabelled GPR41 agonist is<br>
added. Plates are then incubated at room temperature for 60-120 minutes. The binding<br>
reaction is terminated by filtering assay plates through a Microplate Devices GF/C<br>
Unifiltcr filtration plate with a Brandell 96-well plate harvester followed by washing<br>
with cold 50 mM Tris IIC1, pH 7.4 containing 0.9% NaCl. Then, the bottom of the<br>
filtration plates are sealed, 50ul of Optiphase Supermix is added to each well, the top of<br>
the plates are sealed, and plates are counted in a Tnlux MicroBeta scintillation counter.<br>
For compound competition studies, instead of adding 100u.l of assay buffer, lOOul of<br>
appropriately diluted candidate compound is added to appropriate wells followed by<br>
addition of50j.il of radiolabelled GPR41 agonist.<br>
C.        CALCULATIONS<br>
The candidate compounds are initially assayed at 1 and 0.1 uM and then at a<br>
range of concentrations chosen such that the middle dose would cause about 50%<br>
inhibition of a radiolabelled GPR41 agonist binding (i.e., IC50). Specific binding in the<br>
absence of candidate compound (Bo) is the difference of total binding (BT) minus non-<br>
specific binding (NSB) and similarly specific binding (in the presence of candidate<br>
compound) (B) is the difference of displacement binding (BD) minus non-specific<br>
binding (NSB). IC50 is determined from an inhibition response curve, logit-log plot of %<br>
B/Bo vs concentration of candidate compound.<br>

Rodent Diabetes Model<br>
Rodent models of type 2 diabetes associated with obesity and insulin re;3istance<br>
have been developed. Genetic models such as db/db and ob/ob [see Diabetes (1982)<br>
31:1-6J in mice and fa/fa in zucker rats have been developed for understanding the<br>
pathophysiology of disease and for testing candidate therapeutic compounds [Diabetes<br>
(1983) 32:830-838; Annu Rep Sankyo Res Lab (1994) 46:1-57]. The homozygous<br>
animals, C57 BL/KsJ-db/db mice developed by Jackson Laboratory are obese,<br>
hyperglycemic, hyperinsulinemic and msulinresistant [J Chn Invest (1990) 85.962-967J,<br>
whereas hetcrozygotes are lean and normoglycemic. In the db/db model, mice<br>
progressively develop insulinopenia with age, a feature commonly observed in late<br>
stages of human type 2 diabetes when sugar levels are insufficiently controlled. Since<br>
this model resembles that of human type 2 diabetes, the compounds of the present<br>
invention are tested for activities including, but not limited to, lowering of plasma<br>
glucose and triglycerides. Zucker (fa/fa) rats are severely obese, hyperinsulinemic, and<br>
msulin resistant {Coleman, Diabetes (1982) 31:1; E Shafrir in Diabetes Melhtus. II<br>
Rifkin and D Porte, Jr, Eds [Elscvier Science Publishing Co, New York, ed. 4, (1990),<br>
pp. 299-340]}, and the fa/fa mutation may be the rat equivalent of the murine db<br>
mutation [Friedman et al, Cell (1992) 69:217-220; Truetl et al, ProcNatl Acad Sci USA<br>
(1991) 88:7806]. Tubby (tub/tub) mice are characterized by obesity, moderate insulin<br>
resistance and hyperinsulinemia without significant hyperglycemia [Coleman et al,<br>
Heredity (1990) 81:424].<br>
The present invention encompasses the use GPR41 modulators for reducing the<br>
insulin resistance and hyperglycemia in any or all of the above rodent diabetes models, in<br>
humans with type 2 diabetes or other preferred insulin-related disorders or disorders of<br>
lipid metabolism described previously, or in models based on other mammals. Plasma<br>
glucose and insulin levels can be tested, as well as other factors including, but not limited<br>
to, plasma free fatty acids and triglycerides.<br>

In Vivo Assay for Anti-Hyperglycemic Activity of GPR41 modulators<br>
Genetically altered obese diabetic mice (db/db) (male, 7-9 weeks old) arc housed<br>
(7-9 mice/cage) under standard laboratory conditions at 22°C and 50% relative humidity,<br>
and maintained on a diet of Punna rodsnt chow and water ad libitum. Pnor to treatment,<br>
blood is collected from the tail vein of each animal and blood glucose concentrations arc<br>
determined using One Touch Basic Glucose Monitor System (Lifescan). Mice that have<br>
plasma glucose levels between 250 to 500 mg/dl are used. Each treatment group consists<br>
of seven mice that are distributed so that the mean glucose levels are equivalent in each<br>
group at the start of the study, db/db mice are dosed by micro-osmotic pumps, inserted<br>
using isoflurane anesthesia, to provide compounds of the invention, saline, or an<br>
irrelevant compound to the mice subcutaneously (s.c). Blood is sampled from the tail<br>
vem at intervals thereafter and analyzed for blood glucose concentrations. Significant<br>
differences between groups (comparing compounds of the interest to saline-treated) are<br>
evaluated using Student t-tcst.<br>
The foregoing is provided by way of illustration and not limitation. Other<br>
illustrative rodent models for type 2 diabetes have been described [Moller D£, Nature<br>
(2001) 414:821-7 and references therein; and Reed MJ et al., Diabetes, Obesity and<br>

Mouse Atherosclerosis Model<br>
Adiponectm-deficicnt mice generated through knocking out the adiponectin gene<br>
have been shown to be predisposed to atherosclerosis and to be insulin resistant. The<br>
mice are also a suitable model for ischemic heart disease [Matsuda, M et al. J Biol Chem<br>
(2002) July, and references cited therein, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein<br>

Adiponectin knockout mice are housed (7-9 mice/cage) under standard laboratory<br>
conditions at 22°C and 50% relative humidity. The mice are dosed by micro-osmotic<br>
pumps, inserted using isoflurane anesthesia, to provide compounds of the invention,<br>
saline, or an irrelevant compound to the mice subcutaneously (s.c). Neomtimal<br>
thickening and ischemic heart disease are determined for different groups of mice<br>
sacrificed at different time intervals. Significant differences between groups (comparing<br>
compounds of the interest to saline-treated) are evaluated using Student t-test.<br>

In Vivo Pig Model of I-IDL-Cholesterol and Atherosclerosis<br>
The utility of a compound of interest as a medical agent in the prevention or<br>
treatment of a high total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio and conditions relating<br>
thereto is demonstrated, for example, by the activity of the compound in lowering the<br>
ratio of total cholesterol to IIDL-cholesterol, m elevating HDL-cholesteroL or in<br>
protection from atherosclerosis in an in vivo pig model. Pigs are used as an animal<br>
model because they reflect human physiology, especially lipicl metabolism, more closel}<br>
than most other animal models. An illustrative in vivo pig model not intended to be<br>
limiting is presented here.<br>
Yorkshire albino pigs (body weight 25.5 — 4 kg) are fed a saturated fatty acid rich<br>
and cholesterol rich (SFA-CHO) diet during 50 days (1 kg chow 35 kg-1 pig weight).<br>
composed of standard chow supplemented with 2% cholesterol and 20% beef tallow<br>
[Royo T et al., European Journal of Clinical Investigation (2000) 30.843-52]. Saturated<br>
to unsaturated fatty acid ratio is modified from 0.6 in normal pig chow to 1.12 in the<br>
SFA-CHO diet. Animals are divided into two groups, one group (n = 8) fed with the<br>
SFA-CHO diet and treated with placebo and one group (n = 8) fed with the SFA-CHO<br>
diet and treated with the modulator (3.0 mg kg-1). Control animals are fed a standard<br>
chow for a period of 50 days. Blood samples are collected at baseline (2 days after the<br>
reception of the animals), and 50 days after the initiation of the diet. Blood lipids arc<br>
analyzed. The animals are sacrificed and necropsied.<br>

choleslerol, and LDL-cholesterol are measured using the automatic analyzer Kodak<br>
Ektachem DT System (Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, NY, USA)   Samples wuh<br>
