				<td>Window with an opaque coating<br>
The invention relates to a window with an opaque<br>
coating comprising a surface region which has opaque<br>
surface portions and which is perforated by surface<br>
portions allowing light to pass through and distributed<br>
over the surface.<br>
For panes (of windows), it is known (DE-C2-37 08 577)<br>
to reduce or . to delimit their transparent surface<br>
portions by opaque coatings (in particular by opaque<br>
designs or patterns printed by screen printing and<br>
baked). Such panes are widely used for windows called<br>
sunroofs in motor vehicles, where the printed designs<br>
and their opaque (surface) portions act as a sunscreen<br>
and heat shield respectively. Cross-linked opaque<br>
coatings hide adhesive strips and also other parts<br>
which are fastened to the panes or integrated into the<br>
(laminated) windows. Finally, windshields for vehicles<br>
with a printed pattern provided to form a protective<br>
screen in the region between the folding sun visors are<br>
known (DE-C2-40 33 188).<br>
A laminated window for vehicles, with a symbol embedded<br>
in the composite adhesive layer, which is represented<br>
by an electroluminescent light element or which may be<br>
illuminated from the rear, is known from<br>
EP-A1-0 267 331. The electrical conductors needed are<br>
represented in a virtually invisible manner by<br>
transparent conducting layers or pathways inside the<br>
composite. After switching on the supply voltage, the<br>
light symbol seems to float in the window without<br>
visible conductors. The document mentioned discloses<br>
two different types of light element. In the first, the<br>
two current carrying electrodes are provided on the<br>
same substrate and are straddled by the light element,<br>
which in turn comprises an intersection electrode. From<br>
the electrical point of view, two capacitors mounted in<br>
series are thus formed. In the second type, one of the<br><br>
two electrodes is placed each time in the form of a<br>
transparent thin layer on the two inner surfaces of the<br>
laminated window and the light element is placed<br>
therebetween. Also, the option according to which the<br>
light exiting through one of the windows can be<br>
prevented by means of an opaque coating is described<br>
therein.<br>
The basic principles of electroluminescence have been<br>
known for a long time. A detailed documentation of this<br>
technology, with application examples, descriptions of<br>
material and the colors of light which can be produced<br>
is available at the Internet address<br>
"http://www.dupont.com/mcm/luxprint/about.html",(last<br>
updated May 2001), such that there is scope to consider<br>
the details only briefly here.<br>
A capacitor is produced from two conducting layers, at<br>
least one of which is transparent/lets light through.<br>
On the transparent electrode, an (opaque) layer with<br>
light pigments and an insulating (dielectric) layer is<br>
inserted into the capacitor. If an A.C. voltage<br>
(normally 100 V) is applied to the two electrodes of<br>
this element, the latter excites currents in the light<br>
pigments which in turn create, by dispersive processes,<br>
light which exits through the transparent electrode.<br>
The electrode layers together with the<br>
electroluminescent layer itself and the dielectric<br>
layer can be deposited by screen printing in a thick<br>
layer on suitable media, such as glass and PET films.<br>
By means of this known effect, surface light effects<br>
are obtained, which can be used for many applications<br>
(lighting, logos, illuminated signs), if one adapts to<br>
the relatively low light density and to the choice of<br>
colors which is limited by the materials which can be<br>
used. Furthermore, the electroluminescent elements<br>
(hereinafter, light elements) are not transparent, by<br>
themselves, such that a face provided with them does<br><br>
not allow (day) light to pass through.<br>
The object of the invention is to assign an additional<br>
function to an opaque coating, Structured with<br>
transparent surface portions distributed over the<br>
surface, of a transparent (window) pane.<br>
According to the invention, this objective is achieved<br>
by the fact that at least one flat electroluminescent<br>
light element with several layers, including a<br>
transparent electrode, is placed in at least some of<br>
the opaque surface portions of the surface region,<br>
which element,after applying an electrical supply<br>
voltage to the side of the transparent electrode,<br>
radiates light through at least one of the faces of the<br>
window.<br>
In this way, the window, which serves for example as a<br>
sunscreen or a heat shield during the day in daylight,<br>
may also serve by low luminosity as an illumination<br>
system over its entire surface without any dark region<br>
being present since the light emitted by the<br>
electroluminescent element passes uniformly through the<br>
open surface portions and is also diffused uniformly<br>
through the opaque surface portions.<br>
The characteristics of the secondary claims relate to<br>
advantageous variants of this object.<br>
According to the latter, at least one electro-<br>
luminescent element laid down in several layers (light<br>
elements) with at least one transparent electrode,<br>
which emits light over (at least) one of the flat faces<br>
of the pane after applying a voltage, is combined with<br>
at least some of the opaque surface portions of the<br>
coating. Thus, the window allows light to' pass through<br>
in the transparent surface portions and at the same<br>
time radiates light, on application of a current,<br>
through its nontransparent surface portions - which at<br><br>
the same time form the surface of the light element.<br>
The electroluminescent layer itself is opaque, as has<br>
already been mentioned. It does not have to be combined<br>
with another opaque coating.<br>
A window of this type has a surprising effect from the<br>
visual and esthetic point of view - the surface portion<br>
considered "dark" itself now radiates light. It is<br>
possible to provide several light elements side by side<br>
to be switched on separately in various regions of the<br>
surface, it being possible for the electrodes and the<br>
current leads to be masked relatively simply under the<br>
opaque coating. In this case, the electrode allowing<br>
light to pass through may possibly be used as a common<br>
(ground) electrode for all the light elements. It is<br>
thus possible to obtain various light effects, or also<br>
to control the intensity of the light over several<br>
levels (depending on the respective surface to be<br>
illuminated and possibly on the color of its light) .<br>
In the application case mentioned, a partially<br>
transparent window pane of this sort may replace<br>
particular interior lighting in a motor vehicle, such<br>
as a sunroof in a motor vehicle with the light element<br>
in the "on" state and with enough area or light<br>
intensity, it however being possible for a certain<br>
amount of light still to enter by the top through the<br>
glazed roof during the day.<br>
A prior condition for this double effect is naturally<br>
that, in the portions of window allowing light to pass<br>
through, as high a transparency as possible is provided<br>
which is undisturbed by conductor structures or the<br>
like. A fine resolution structure of this type may be<br>
created reproducibly, simply and reliably by the known<br>
method of screen printing. Naturally, it is important<br>
that the various layers of the light element are<br>
printed with very accurate superposition in the region<br>
of the pattern. However, this is also a well-mastered<br><br>
industrial process.<br>
Naturally, light effects of the aforementioned type may<br>
also be obtained on all the other (laminated) windows,<br>
which are provided with a partially transparent printed<br>
pattern of this sort, thus for example in the sun visor<br>
region, if the higher costs incurred by producing<br>
multiple prints and electrical connections are<br>
acceptable.<br>
Of course, it is not necessarily essential to embed a<br>
light element of this sort in a laminated window, but<br>
this arrangement will be preferred for reasons of<br>
safety with regard to the fairly high supply voltage.<br>
The embedded placement in a laminated window further<br>
protects the light element against mechanical action<br>
and against the penetration of moisture and of dirt.<br>
The material of the window itself is in principle<br>
chosen freely; it is equally possible to use windows<br>
made of plastic or of glass. Similarly, hybrid<br>
composites can be manufactured industrially in a known<br>
manner.<br>
In principle, it also does not matter whether the light<br>
element is applied or printed directly on a surface of<br>
such a window, or whether it is produced on a separate<br>
support substrate, such as for example a PET film,<br>
which will then satisfactorily be assembled to the<br>
rigid window or incorporated in a laminated composite.<br>
Similarly, it is possible for the ratio of the surface<br>
area of the light element to the total surface area of<br>
the window, or to said surface region of the structured<br>
opaque coating to be chosen freely. As required, it is<br>
possible to place several light elements having, as<br>
appropriate, different colors and shapes, side by side.<br>
Finally, it may also be beneficial in some application<br><br>
cases for light to be radiated by one or more<br>
electroluminescent light elements on both faces of the<br>
window. There is then no need for a separate opaque<br>
coating, since the electroluminescent layers themselves<br>
do not allow visible light to pass through. In<br>
principle, it is also possible to "stack" several<br>
electroluminescent light elements of this type on each<br>
other, as appropriate with opposite orientations to<br>
each other, possibly using only a single common<br>
intermediate electrode.<br>
It has also been possible to obtain another particular<br>
light effect, by enclosing, of course, the light<br>
element in a laminated window, but by not placing the<br>
opaque coating directly on the electrode layer, but<br>
from the other side of the external window on the outer<br>
surface thereof (and thereby providing it, for example<br>
by baking, with sufficient mechanical strength). A<br>
certain proportion of nonoriented light could still<br>
exit, by lateral dispersion, possibly through surface<br>
portions of this opaque coating which allow light to<br>
pass through.<br>
Other details and advantages of the subject of the<br>
invention will become apparent from the drawing of an<br>
exemplary embodiment and by its detailed description<br>
which follows.<br>
In the accompanuying drawings having a simplified representation,<br>
fig. 1 is a view of a window with an opaque coating<br>
with a structure in the form of a pattern; and<br>
fig. 2 shows, in a section through the window of<br>
figure 1 along the line II-II, the outline<br>
structure of the layers of this laminated<br>
window equipped with an electroluminescent<br>
light element according to the invention.<br>
According to figure 1, a naturally transparent window 1<br>
is provided with an opaque coating 2. In a surface<br><br>
region 3 (surrounded by a broken line for more<br>
clarity), the latter is perforated with surface<br>
portions 4 allowing light to pass through, therefore<br>
transparent, distributed uniformly over the surface,<br>
which alternate with opaque surface portions 5, while<br>
considering moreover that in this case the entire<br>
surface region 3 is covered with the design<br>
illustrated.<br>
The regular pattern shown here and its size with<br>
respect to the surface area of the window is however<br>
only an exemplary embodiment or arrangement. By means<br>
of screen printing, it is possible to produce virtually<br>
any other desired combination, in particular for an<br>
irregular surface, of opaque and transparent surface<br>
portions. The opaque surface portions do not<br>
necessarily have to be contiguous, within the scope of<br>
the invention. We will return again to this aspect<br>
below.<br>
At least some of the opaque surface portions 5 are now<br>
coupled to an electroluminescent light element, whose<br>
presence is indicated by two electrical connection<br>
wires L. Its structure will now be described in more<br>
detail with reference to figure 2.<br>
In transverse section, the surface of a first<br>
transparent (glass) pane 1.1 (which is turned toward a<br>
space to be illuminated in the mounted position) is<br>
followed firstly by a polyvinyl butyral (PVB) adhesive<br>
layer 6, which is assembled to a PET film 7 (preferably<br>
in the form of a previously laminated film) . The two<br>
films 6 and 7 are transparent.<br>
The PET film 7 is. preferably continuously coated (in a<br>
manner known per se) with a transparent conducting<br>
layer 8, for example made of indium tin oxide (ITO),<br>
which forms one of the electrodes for an<br>
electroluminescent light element EL. After the ITO<br><br>
layer 8, comes the electroluminescent layer 9 deposited<br>
according to the desired arrangement or design, over<br>
which an (electrically nonconducting) dielectric layer<br>
10 is again deposited.<br>
The latter is followed by a highly conducting electrode<br>
layer 11, for example made of metallic silver. A silver<br>
layer of this sort has the well-known effect of a<br>
thermal mirror, that is to say that it strongly<br>
reflects infrared. This thermal protection effect may<br>
be advantageously exploited specifically in the case of<br>
use as a sunroof in motor vehicles.<br>
The electrode layer 11 is again covered with an opaque<br>
color layer 12, which prevents the light radiated by<br>
the electroluminescent light element exiting toward<br>
this face and also has the effect of attenuating the<br>
passage of heat and light toward the inside. It also<br>
has a decorative aspect. The color layer 12 may be<br>
removed, if the light has to be emitted from both faces<br>
of the window 1, or when, for example, the electrode<br>
layer 11 has to have a certain mirror effect. The<br>
opacity of the coating in the opaque surface portions<br>
is then provided only by the electroluminescent layer,<br>
with assistance from the dielectric layer and from the<br>
structured electrode layer, as appropriate.<br>
The PET film 7, the transparent conducting layer 8, the<br>
electroluminescent layer 9, the dielectric layer 10 and<br>
the conducting electrode layer 11, whose numerical<br>
references are brought together in a frame finely<br>
outlined with broken lines for the purpose of clarity,<br>
form the minimum components of the electroluminescent<br>
light element EL, except for the electrical connection<br>
wires.<br>
Its manufacture may be carried out as follows: firstly,<br>
the transparent conducting coating 8 is deposited (for<br>
example by spraying) on the PET substrate 7 (also<br><br>
directly on one surface of a rigid pane, as required).<br>
The desired arrangement or design of the<br>
electroluminescent layer. 9 is then produced, preferably<br>
by overlaying as a thick layer, followed by the<br>
dielectric layer 10. Next, the counter electrode 11 is<br>
deposited on the dielectric layer. The latter would<br>
have to be taken close to the edge of the window 1, in<br>
at least one location, in order to be able to produce,<br>
in a relatively simple manner, the electrical<br>
connection.<br>
To prevent short circuits, it is absolutely necessary<br>
that the dielectric layer 10 covers at least the same<br>
surface area as the counter electrode 11. Therefore, if<br>
the dielectric layer 10 itself does not fully cover the<br>
surface, but is structured according to a design as in<br>
the representation, the counter electrode 11 must also<br>
be structured in the same way, so that it cannot be<br>
short-circuited with the transparent electrode 8. On<br>
the other hand, if the layers 10 and 11 also extend<br>
over the transparent surface portions 4 of the surface<br>
region 3, unlike the drawing, then naturally, they must<br>
themselves be sufficiently transparent.<br>
The surface portion of the electroluminescent layer 9<br>
may however be smaller than the surface areas of the<br>
dielectric layer 10 and of the counter electrode 11.<br>
The opaque surface regions (of the electroluminescent<br>
layer 9) once again must not be crosslinked directly<br>
one with the other, but they may be configured, for<br>
example, likewise in the form of a dot pattern. If the<br>
dielectric is not transparent, the surface portions<br>
allowing light to pass through must then be recessed by<br>
printing, for example, the electroluminescent layer and<br>
the dielectric with the same surface structure, while<br>
the electrode is produced directly on the surface. Each<br>
point then forms a specific light capacitor of small<br>
spread, and it is then possible to radiate different<br>
light colors likewise with a choice of different<br><br>
materials (which however involves several screen<br>
printing operations). If it is necessary to prevent<br>
light exiting through the dielectric, another printing<br>
of an opaque mask corresponding to the design of the<br>
electroluminescent layer would then be necessary.<br>
By referring to the design illustrated in figure 1, it<br>
would also be possible for example to imagine covering<br>
only the intersection regions of the pattern with the<br>
electroluminescent layer.<br>
The composite is completed by another layer, another<br>
PVB film 13 and a second (glass) pane 1.2,<br>
respectively, assembled thereto. It is recognized that<br>
the PVB layer 13 is connected to the layer 6 of the<br>
same material by melting the edge of the window 1.<br>
Thus, the inner region of the composite is sealed<br>
virtually hermetically against moisture and dirt. The<br>
two PVB layers 6 and 13 must be considered as together<br>
forming the intermediate layer for bonding the<br>
laminated window.<br>
Furthermore, all the intermediate spaces in the<br>
structure of the electroluminescent layer are filled<br>
with PVB. Broken lines between the various portions of<br>
cut layers indicate the continuous extensions of the<br>
respective layers behind the plane of the section.<br>
The proportions of size and thickness are in this case<br>
strongly distorted, since in reality the layers 8 to 12<br>
are much thinner than the PVB layers 6 and 13.<br>
Similarly, the PET film 7 is in reality markedly<br>
thinner than a PVB film, yet much thicker than the<br>
layers 8 to 12.<br>
An electrical connection conducting pathway 14, which<br>
is deposited in a known manner (in the form of a thin<br>
strip of metal or as a printed conducting pathway) on<br>
the layer 8, and which may be connected to the outside<br><br>
(by means of conductors L illustrated in figure 1), so<br>
as to power the electroluminescent light element, has<br>
been indicated close to the edge of the window 1 on the<br>
transparent electrode layer 8. In another variant, it<br>
is also possible to deposit an opaque coating in the<br>
form of a frame 15 on the inner face of the pane 1.2 in<br>
order to mask the edge regions of the pane at the<br>
periphery.<br>
Finally, arrows denote the passages of light<br>
(transparent surface portions 4) or the light rays to<br>
be emitted by the electroluminescent light element<br>
(opaque surface portions 5). It is recognized that both<br>
the latter pass through the transparent electrode 8<br>
together with the films 6 and 7 and the pane 1.1 and<br>
exit through the face of the latter.<br>
The two electrodes 8 and 11, which are in all cases<br>
reliably electrically insulated from each other by the<br>
dielectric layer 10, may, in a suitable manner known<br>
per se, each be separately electrically connected to<br>
the output wires L and be taken to the outside. The<br>
corresponding technologies have already been described<br>
many times and do not have to be stated in detail here.<br>
In a variant of the electroluminescent light element EL<br>
known in principle from EP-A1-0 267 331, it would also<br>
be possible to conceive dividing the ITO layer 8<br>
deposited on the PET film 7 into one or more regions<br>
and to connect each of the surface regions thus formed<br>
in pairs to different poles of the supply voltage. The<br>
electrode layer, that is to say the counter electrode<br>
11, would then act in a known manner as a bridging<br>
electrode in each case between two light elements<br>
mounted electrically in series. Its surface resistance<br>
would then be as low as possible. A silver layer would<br>
be suitable for this purpose. This configuration has<br>
the advantage that all the external electrical<br>
connections only have to be in a single plane.<br><br>
