				<td>REAGENT FOR ORGANIC SYNTHESIS AND METHOD OF ORGANIC SYNTHESIS<br>
REACTION WITH THE REAGENT<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a reagent for organic<br>
synthesis and a method of organic synthesis reaction using<br>
this reagent, and in more detail, it relates to a reagent for<br>
organic synthesis which is a compound which rapidly changes<br>
from a liquid phase state to a solid phase state due to a<br>
change in solution composition and/or solution temperature,<br>
which is provided as a compound acting as a reaction substrate<br>
or a catalyst in an organic synthesis reaction, or which is<br>
provided as a compound which bonds to unreacted compounds or<br>
byproducts in an organic synthesis reaction, which can be eas-<br>
ily removed from the reaction system after the; reaction; and<br>
to a method of organic synthesis using this reagent.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In chemical reaction processes, methods of separating as a<br>
solid a specified component dissolved in a liquid are widely<br>
used. This is because, by solidifying (crystallizing) only<br>
the specified component, separation and/or purification after<br>
the reaction are simplified. In particular, recently, in suc-<br>
cessive multistage synthesis such as compound library synthe-<br>
sis and the like used in the research and development of phar-<br>
maceuticals, after the completion of each reaction, by solidi-<br>
fying (crystallizing) the unnecessary compounds, the removal<br><br>
of the solidified (crystallized) substances becomes easy, and<br>
it is possible to prevent the processes from becoming compli-<br>
cated.<br>
The solidification (crystallization) of specified compo-<br>
nents dissolved in a solution in this way is implemented by<br>
satisfying defined conditions in the relationship with chemi-<br>
cal properties and physical properties of the compounds, and<br>
with the solvent.<br>
However, the conditions for solidification (crystalliza-<br>
tion), in many cases, must be found by experience based on<br>
trial and error. Especially, in successive multistage synthe-<br>
sis, because it is necessary to consider the solidification<br>
(crystallization) conditions based on the characteristic prop-<br>
erties of the compounds synthesized in each of the stages,<br>
process development is very expensive and time consuming.<br>
In order to solve such problems, in the prior art, there<br>
was known a means of using a chemically modified reagent on<br>
polystyrene or silica, and separating the liquid including the<br>
products, and the reagents, by filtration after the reaction.<br>
With these reagents, it is possible to easily separate unre-<br>
acted compounds added in excess, byproducts, and catalysts, in<br>
an organic synthesis reaction or the like, without complicated<br>
separation processes.<br>
Further, Patent Document 1 discloses a method for practic-<br>
ing a nucleophilic substitution reaction (Mitsunobu reaction)<br>
of an alcohol for producing a desired product, including a<br>
step of reacting an alcohol and a nucleophilic reagent with an<br><br>
azodicarboxylate and a phosphine, wherein at least one of the<br>
azodicarboxylate and phosphine include at least one fluorous<br>
tag (a retention group of a highly fluorinated alkyl group or<br>
the like). Here, for example, fluorous solvents including<br>
perfluorocarbon or the like, will be present as a third phase<br>
without mixing with organic solvents or water, and have the<br>
characteristic of dissolving compounds having a fluorous tag.<br>
Because of this, by adding a fluorous solvent to a uniform re-<br>
action phase, it is possible to easily separate a compound<br>
which must be separated from the product, and which has a flu-<br>
orous tag.<br>
Further, by using a fluorous carrier which selectively<br>
bonds to a fluorous tag, it is possible to easily separate a<br>
compound having a fluorous tag by solid-liquid.extraction.<br>
Patent Document 1: Japanese Publication No. 2005-508890 of<br>
PCT Application.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
However, in the case of utilizing a reaction using a chem-<br>
ically modified reagent on polystyrene or silica, for the<br>
reagent carried on the polystyrene or silica, the reaction<br>
point is only at the solid liquid interface, thus the reactiv-<br>
ity is often low. Further, there was the problem that it was<br>
not possible to use this method in many synthesis reactions<br>
where a product is produced by the reaction from sterically<br>
plural directions, two or more reagents, because the reaction<br><br>
was carried out on a solid surface.<br>
Further, in the method disclosed in Patent Document 1, in<br>
the case of using a fluorous solvent when separating a com-<br>
pound having a fluorous tag, there was the problem that the<br>
costs of the reaction could not be kept low because fluorous<br>
solvents are expensive. Further, in the case of using a fluo-<br>
rous carrier in the separation of a compound having a fluorous<br>
tag, in addition to using an expensive fluorinated silica gel<br>
or the like, the separation operation is complex and cannot be<br>
easily used.<br>
The present invention was made in view of the above prob-<br>
lems, and has the objective of providing a reagent for organic<br>
synthesis and a method of organic synthesis reaction using the<br>
reagent, whereby a chemical reaction can be carried cut in a<br>
liquid phase, and further, the separation of the unnecessary<br>
compounds from the liquid phase after the completion of the<br>
reaction can be carried out easily and also at low cost.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems<br>
The present inventors have carried out diligent research<br>
in order to solve the above problems. As a result, they ar-<br>
rived at and completed the present invention, discovering that<br>
by using a reagent for organic synthesis including an aromatic<br>
group having a specified hydrophobic group, and having a prop-<br>
erty of reversibly changing from a liquid phase state to a<br>
solid phase state according to changes in the solution compo-<br>
sition and/or the solution temperature, it is possible to car-<br>
ry out the separation of unnecessary compounds from the liquid<br><br>
phase after the completion of the reaction, easily and fur-<br>
thermore, at low cost.<br>
Specifically, the present invention provides the follow-<br>
ing.<br>
The first aspect of the invention provides a reagent for<br>
organic synthesis which can be used for organic synthesis re-<br>
actions, shown in the below Chemical Formula (1), having a<br>
property of reversibly changing from a liquid phase state to a<br>
solid phase state according to changes in solution composition<br>
and/or solution temperature.<br><br>
(In the formula, Rx to R5 may be the same or different, and<br>
represent hydrogen, halogen, or alkyl group with a carbon num-<br>
ber of 1 to 30 which may have a substituent group, alkoxyl<br>
group with a carbon number of 1 to 30 which may have a sub-<br>
stituent group, aryl group with a carbon number of 1 to 30<br>
which may have a substituent group, acyl group with a carbon<br>
number of 1 to 30 which may have a substituent group,<br>
thioalkyl group with a carbon number of 1 to 30 which may have<br>
a substituent group, dialkylamino group with a carbon number<br>
of 1 to 30 which may have a substituent group, nitro group or<br>
amino group, and at least two of R1 to R5 are alkyl group with<br>
a carbon number of 18 to 30 which may have a substituent<br><br>
group, alkoxyl group with a carbon number of 18 to 30 which<br>
may have a substituent group, acyl group with a carbon number<br>
of 18 to 30 which may have a substituent group, thioalkyl<br>
group with a carbon number of 18 to 30 which may have a sub-<br>
stituent group, or dialkylamino group with a carbon number of<br>
18 to 30 which may have a substituent group. Further, in the<br>
formula, X represents a reagent active site having one or more<br>
atoms selected from the group consisting of a carbon atom,<br>
oxygen atom, sulfur atom, and nitrogen atom.)<br>
According to the reagent for organic synthesis according<br>
to the first aspect, in addition to having a reagent active<br>
site having one or more atoms selected from the group consist-<br>
ing of carbon, oxygen, sulfur, or nitrogen atoms, it also has,<br>
as substituent groups on the. aromatic ring, at least two of:<br>
alkyl group with a carbon number of 18 to 30 which may have a<br>
substituent group, alkoxyl group with a carbon number of 18 to<br>
30 which may have a substituent group, acyl group with a car-<br>
bon number of 18 to 30 which may have a substituent group, a<br>
thioalkyl group with a carbon number of 18 to 30 which may<br>
have a substituent group, or a dialkylamino group with a car-<br>
bon number of 18 to 30 which may have a substituent group.<br>
Because of this, the reagent for organic synthesis can be dis-<br>
solved uniformly with high concentration in many organic sol-<br>
vents, and it can react with a high degree of reactivity with<br>
other compounds in many organic solvents.<br>
Further, the reagent for organic synthesis according to<br>
the first aspect can also be used mainly as a nucleophilic<br><br>
scavenger, electrophilic scavenger, synthesis building block,<br>
reaction accelerator, condensation agent, or metal ligand.<br>
Namely, it can be used in a wide range of applications, as a<br>
reaction substance for unnecessary ,substances such as byprod-<br>
ucts, catalysts, and unreacted reaction substrate and the<br>
like, as a reaction substrate in an organic synthesis reac-<br>
tion, and as a catalyst or reaction accelerator in an organic<br>
synthesis reaction, and in addition, it has the property of<br>
reversibly changing from a liquid phase state to a solid phase<br>
state according to changes in solution composition and/or so-<br>
lution temperature, and thus can be easily separated from the<br>
reaction system by solidification after the reaction.<br>
In this way, any compounds added to a reaction system, and<br>
byproducts generated in the reaction system, can be easily<br>
separated from the reaction system, or a specified reaction<br>
substrate or reaction accelerator can be added to the reaction<br>
system as a compound which can be easily separated later, and<br>
can be easily separated from the reaction system after the<br>
completion of the reaction.<br>
Further, in a reaction using the reagent for organic syn-<br>
thesis of the first aspect, the organic synthesis reaction can<br>
be carried out at low cost without using particularly expen-<br>
sive reagents.<br>
Here, the "reagent for organic synthesis" indicates all<br>
reagents used for carrying out organic synthesis reactions, or<br>
processes after the reaction, and includes reaction sub-<br>
strates, reaction accelerators, and synthesis building blocks,<br><br>
and the like. The reagent for organic synthesis according to<br>
the present invention is not particularly limited in terms of<br>
the amount used, and can be used in any case such as the case<br>

reacted with other reaction substrate substances among elec-<br>
trophilic reagents used a chemical reaction, and to compounds<br>

diate provided for the organic synthesis reaction of the de-<br>
sired compound in the present invention, and indicates a gen-<br>
eral term for a compound which can impart an arbitrary reagent<br>
activity to a reaction substrate by introducing a specified<br>
functional group via chemical bonding in an arbitrary reaction<br>
substrate.<br>
The term "condensation agent" indicates a compound which<br>

reaction system, and for example, acids, bases, catalysts and<br>
the like can be mentioned.<br>
The second aspect of the invention provides a reagent for<br>
organic synthesis according to the first aspect, characterized<br>
in that, in Chemical Formula (1), X is a functional group<br>
shown by (A) to (M), or (A') to (M') below.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
(In the formulas (A) to (M), Y is an ester bond, ether bond,<br>
amide bond, thioester bond, sulfide bond, urea bond, carbamate<br>
bond, or carbonate bond, or an alkylene group with a carbon<br>
number of 1 to 10 which may have such bonds. Further, in for-<br><br>
mulas (M) and (M'), m and n are independently 0 or 1, Za is a<br>
chlorine atom or a bromine atom, Zb is a hydroxyl group, chlo-<br>
rine atom, or a bromine atom.)<br>
Here, a "carbamate bond" is the chemical bond shown in<br>
Chemical Formula (N).<br><br>
Further, a "carbonate bond" is the chemical bond shown in<br>
Chemical Formula (0).<br><br>
The reagent for organic synthesis of the second aspect can<br>
be used for the following applications. Namely, in the case<br>
that among the compounds (1) indicated in the second aspect, X<br>
is reagent active site shown by the Chemical Formula (A) to<br>
(C) or (A') to (C), because it has a reaction center having<br>
nucleophilicity, such as a thiol group, amino group, or the<br>

Further, in the case that among the compounds (1) shown in<br>
the second aspect, X is a reagent active site indicated by the<br>
Chemical Formulas (D) to (H), or (D') to (H'), because it has<br>
a reaction center having electrophilicity, such as a carbonyl<br>
carbon atom, or the like, it can be used as an electrophilic<br>
scavenger. Further, also in the case that among the compounds<br>
(1), X is a reagent active site shown by the Chemical Formulas<br><br>

group is bonded, and the carbon atom to which to a halogen<br>
atom, not directly bonded to a benzene ring, is bonded have<br>
electrophilicity, it can be used as an electrophilic scav-<br>
enger.<br>
Moreover, in the case that among the compounds (1) indi-<br>

by the Chemical Formulas (A) to (H), or (A1) to (H1), because<br>
structural changes for a compound having arbitrary reagent ac-<br>
tivity are possible via a sulfide bond, thioester bond, amino<br>
bond, amide bond, carbamate bond, urea bond, carbonate bond,<br>

second aspect, X is a reagent active site shown by the Chemi-<br>
cal Formulas (I), (J), (I') or (J'), because an amino group or<br>
the like shows strong basicity, it can be used as a reaction<br>
accelerator as a strong base. Namely, these compounds, as<br>
strong bases, by capturing active hydrogen of one portion of<br>
the reaction substrate, can be used as reaction accelerators<br>
for nucleophilic reactions, deprotecting reactions, esterifi-<br>
cation reactions of carboxylic acids, alkylation reactions of<br>
active methylenes, alkylation reactions of amines, alkylation<br>
reactions of phenols, alkylation reactions of thiols, and the<br>
like.<br>
In the case that among the compounds (1) indicated in the<br>
second aspect, X is a reagent active site shown by the Chemi-<br><br>
cal Formulas (K), or (K'), the unbonded electron pair of the<br>
phosphorous atom is donated to a metal atom, and in addition,<br>
an electron pair is back-donated from the metal atom to the n<br>
orbital of the tertiary phosphine. Because of this, these<br>
compounds can form strong coordination bonds with metal atoms.<br>
Further, in the case that among the compounds (1) indicat-<br>
ed in the second aspect, X is a reagent active site shown by<br>
the Chemical Formulas (K), (L), (K'), or (L'), because (K) or<br>
(K') act in the same way as triphenylphosphine, and further,<br>
because (L) or (L') act in the same way as diethyl azodicar-<br>
boxylate, these can be used as condensation agents for many<br>
condensation reactions publicly known as Mitsunobu reactions.<br>
The third aspect of the invention provides a reagent for<br>
organic synthesis according to the first or second aspect,<br>
wherein in the Chemical Formula (1), R2 and R4 are a docosyloxy<br>
group (C22H45O-) , and Rl, R3 and R5 are hydrogen.<br>
Because the reagent for organic synthesis according to the<br>
third aspect has two docosyloxy groups, it can be dissolved<br>
uniformly at high concentration in many organic solvents, and<br>
it can react with a high degree of reactivity with other com-<br>
pounds in many organic solvents.<br>
The fourth aspect of the invention provides a reagent for<br>
organic synthesis according to the third aspect, wherein in<br>
the Chemical Formula (1), the reagent active site X is a func-<br>
tional group shown by the formula (M) or (M').<br>

(In Formula (2a), m and n are independently 0 or 1, Za is a<br>
chlorine atom, or bromine atom, Zb is a hydroxyl group, chlo-<br>
rine atom, or bromine atom.)<br>
Because the reagent for organic synthesis according to the<br>
fourth aspect has a hydroxyl group, chlorine atom, or bromine<br>
atom, it can be used as an electrophilic scavenger. Further,<br>
because the reagent for organic synthesis according to the<br>
fourth aspect has two docosyloxy groups, it can.be dissolved<br>
uniformly at high concentration in many organic solvents, and<br>
it can react with a high degree of reactivity with other com-<br>
pounds in many organic solvents.<br>

organic synthesis according to the first: aspect, wherein in<br>
the Chemical Formula (1), the reagent active site X is a hy-<br>
droxymethyl group, and R2 and R4 are a docosyloxy group<br>
(C22H45O-) , and R1, R3 and R5 are hydrogen.<br>
In other words, the invention according to the fifth as-<br>
pect is a reagent for organic synthesis shown by the following<br>
Chemical Formula (2) which can be used for organic synthesis.<br><br><br>
Because the reagent for organic synthesis according to the<br>
fifth aspect has a hydroxyl group, it can be used as an nucle-<br>
ophilic scavenger. Further, because the reagent for organic<br>
synthesis according to the fifth aspect has two docosyloxy<br>
groups, it can be dissolved uniformly at high concentration in<br>
many organic solvents, and it can react with a high degree of<br>
reactivity with other compounds in many organic solvents.<br>
The sixth aspect of the invention provides a method of or-<br>
ganic synthesis reaction using the reagent for organic synthe-<br>
sis according to any one of the first to fifth aspects, com-<br>
prising a reaction step of carrying out a reaction wherein the<br>
reagent for organic synthesis is dissolved in a reaction sys-<br>
tem where the reagent active site X of Chemical Formula (1)<br>
participates in the reaction, and after this, a separation<br>
step of separating the reagent for organic synthesis and the<br>
reacted reagent for organic synthesis.<br>
Taking note of the reagent for organic synthesis disclosed<br>
in the fifth aspect, the invention according to the sixth as-<br>
pect is method of organic synthesis reaction using the reagent<br>
for organic synthesis according to the fifth aspect, compris-<br>

pates in the reaction, and after this, a separation step of<br>
separating the reagent for organic synthesis and the reacted<br>
reagent for organic synthesis.<br>
According to the method of organic synthesis reaction ac-<br>
cording to the sixth aspect, in the reaction step, it is pos-<br>
sible to carry out a chemical reaction for producing the de-<br>
sired compound, using the reagent for organic synthesis ac-<br>
cording to any one of the first to fifth aspects. Further,<br>
because it is possible to separate, by the separation step,<br>
byproducts having a hydrophobic carrier group of the reagent<br>
for organic synthesis among the byproducts produced by the<br>
chemical reaction, and the reagent, for organic synthesis added<br>
to the reaction system in excess and remaining unreacted, it<br>

particularly limited in the used amount of the reagent for or-<br>
ganic synthesis, and can be carried out with any amount, such<br>
as the case of using the reagent for organic synthesis in<br>
large industrial amounts, or in the case of using small<br>
amounts in testing and research.<br>
Further, the separation step in the method of organic syn-<br>
thesis reaction according to the sixth embodiment includes a<br>
step of crystallizing and separating the reagent for organic<br>
synthesis, and the reacted reagent for organic synthesis, by<br>
means of changing the solution composition and/or by means of<br>
changing the solution temperature. Namely, because the<br>
reagent for organic synthesis disclosed in any one of the<br>
first to fifth aspects reacts, sharply to changes in solvent<br>
composition and/or solvent temperature, by using a means to<br>
change the composition and/or the temperature of the solvent,<br>
the reagent for organic synthesis or the reacted reagent for<br>
organic synthesis can be crystallized, and the reagent for or-<br>
ganic synthesis and the reagent for organic synthesis after<br>
reaction can be easily crystallized and separated in a state<br>
where the desired compound of the synthesis remains in the so-<br>
lution.<br>
As the means for changing the solution composition, for<br>
example, the means of adding another solvent to the reaction<br>
system, such as a poor solvent with respect to the reagent for<br>
organic synthesis, or the means of concentrating the solvent<br>
can be mentioned. As a means for changing the solution tern-<br><br>
perature, for example, the means of cooling the solution can<br>
be mentioned.<br>
Effects of the Invention<br>
According to the present invention, the reagent for organ-<br>
ic synthesis can be uniformly dissolved in many organic sol-<br>
vents, and thus can be reacted with a high degree of reactivi-<br>
ty with other compounds. Further, after the reaction, it is<br>
possible to choose from many separation methods such as a sol-<br>
id liquid separation method by crystallizing the reagent for<br>
organic synthesis, and the reacted reagent for organic synthe-<br>
sis, or a liquid liquid extraction method by adding a separa-<br>
tion solvent which is immiscible with the reaction solvent,<br>
and partitioning the reagent for organic synthesis and the re-<br>
acted reagent for organic synthesis into the separation sol-<br>
vent. Because the separation conditions of these separation<br>
methods can be uniformly determined based on the properties of<br>
the reagent for organic synthesis, it is not necessary to con-<br>
sider the separation conditions based on the characteristic<br>
properties or the like of each organic synthesis reaction.<br>
This not only simplifies process development, but also, for<br>
example, makes it possible to accelerate the research and de-<br>
velopment of pharmaceuticals and the like by compound library<br>
synthesis and the like, and this can in turn contribute to<br>
technical innovations in the biochemical industry and chemical<br>
industry.<br>
Further, organic synthesis reactions using the organic<br>
synthesis reagent of the present invention do not use espe-<br><br>
cially expensive compounds, and thus the organic synthesis re-<br>
action can be carried out at low cost.<br>
PREFERRED MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Embodiments of the invention are described in detail be-<br>
low. These embodiments do not in any way limit the reagent<br>
for organic synthesis or the method of organic synthesis reac-<br>
tion using this reagent of the present invention, and appro-<br>
priate modifications can be made within the scope of the ob-<br>
jectives of the present invention.<br>
Reagent for Organic Synthesis<br>
The reagent for organic synthesis according to the present<br>
embodiment is shown by Chemical Formula (1) where R1 to R5 may<br>
be the same or different, and represent a hydrogen, halogen,<br>
alkyl group, alkoxyl group, aryl group, acyl group, thioalkyl<br>
group, or dialkylamino group with a carbon number of 1 to 30<br>
which may have a substituent group; nitro group, or amino<br>
group, and at least two of R1 to R5 are alkyl group, alkoxyl<br>
group, acyl group, thioalkyl group, or dialkylamino group with<br>
a carbon number of 18 to 30 which may have a substituent<br>
group. Further, in the formula, X represents a reagent active<br>
site having at least one atom selected from the group consist-<br>
ing of carbon, oxygen, sulfur or nitrogen atom.<br><br><br>
Because the above compound has at least two hydrophobic<br>
groups selected from the group consisting of alkyl group,<br>
alkoxyl group, acyl group, or thioalkyl group with a carbon<br>
number of 18 to 30 which may have a substituent group, it can<br>
show sufficient hydrophobicity, and can dissolve in a wide<br>
range of organic solvents, and further, a compound where the<br>
3-position and 5-position with respect to X (R2 and R4) are<br>
substituted with an alkoxyl group with a carbon number of 18<br>
to 30 is also stable with respect to acid treatment, and is<br>
especially suitable for the reagent for organic synthesis of<br>
the present invention.<br>
Reagent Active Site<br>
In the above Chemical Formula (1), X indicates a reagent<br>
active site having at least one atom selected from the group<br>
consisting of carbon, oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen atom.<br>
Here, X may also have a structure indicated by the following<br>
Chemical Formulas (A) to (M), or (A') to (M'). Here, Y is an<br>
ester bond, ether bond, amide bond, amino bond, thioester<br>
bond, sulfide bond, urea bond, carbamate bond or a carbonate<br>
bond, or an alkylene group with a carbon number of 1 to 10<br>
which may have one of these bonds. Further, in Formulas (M)<br>
and (M'), m and n are independently 0 or 1, Za is a chlorine<br><br>
atom or bromine atom, and Zb is a hydroxyl group, chlorine<br>
atom, or bromine atom.<br><br><br><br>
Further, in the reagent for organic synthesis of the<br>
present embodiment, a compound where R2 and R4 are docosyloxy<br>
groups (C22H45O-), and R1, R3 and R5 are hydrogen is preferable.<br>
Furthermore, the reagent for organic synthesis of the<br><br>
present embodiment may be a compound shown by the following<br>
Chemical Formula (2).<br><br>
Namely, the compound shown by the Chemical Formula (2) is<br>
a reagent for organic synthesis shown by the Chemical Formula<br>
(1), wherein in the Chemical Formula (1), X is a hydroxymethyl<br>
group, R2 and R4 are docosyloxy (C22H45O-) , R1, R3 and R5 are hy-<br>
drogen.<br>
Here, the compound shown by the Chemical Formula (2) has a<br>
hydroxyl group, and because it shows nucleophilicity, it can<br>
be used as a nucleophilic scavenger.<br>
Manufacturing Method of the Reagent for Organic Synthesis<br>
The manufacturing method of the reagent for organic syn-<br>
thesis indicated in the above formula is not particularly lim-<br>
ited, but it can generally be synthesized by various reactions<br>
such as the following.<br>
A compound having a plurality of phenolic hydroxyl groups<br>
such as methyl gallic acid, and a long chain brominated alkyl<br>
are reacted in N,N-dimethylformamide, under basic conditions,<br>
to yield an aromatic compound having an alkoxy group. Next,<br>
an ester site is converted to the other substituting group to<br>
induce the desired compound by a functional group substitution<br>
by a publicly known means, or the aromatic compound is combine<br><br>
to a specially prepared reagent active site in an arbitrary<br>
bounded form to manufacture the reagent of the present embodi-<br>
ment .<br>
Method of Organic Synthesis Reaction<br>
The reagent for organic synthesis of the present embodi-<br>
ment can be used by the same method of use as the reagent used<br>
in the liquid phase organic synthesis reactions of the prior<br>
art which do not have a hydrophobic carrier group. Namely, in<br>
a state wherein the reaction substrate to be reacted is dis-<br>
solved or dispersed in a solvent, a reagent for organic syn-<br>
thesis having a hydrophobic carrier group is added, and a re-<br>
action is carried out. Here, as the solvent used in the reac-<br>
tion system, it is possible to use a general organic solvent<br>
in the reaction, but because the reactivity is increased as<br>
the solubility of the reagent for organic synthesis in the<br>
solvent increases, it is preferable to select a solvent for<br>
which the solubility of the reagent for organic synthesis is<br>
high. Specifically, tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane, di-<br>
ethylether, hexane, cyclohexane, N,N-dimethylformamide and the<br>
like are preferable, but it is not particularly limited to<br>
this. To confirm the progress of the reaction, the same meth-<br>
ods used for general liquid phase organic synthesis reactions<br>
can be applied. Namely, thin layer silica gel chromatography,<br>
high speed liquid chromatography, and the like can be used to<br>
track the reaction.<br>
Reaction Step<br>
In the reaction step, by reacting a specified reaction<br><br>
substrate and the reagent for organic synthesis, or by using<br>
the reagent for organic synthesis as a reaction accelerator in<br>
a specified chemical reaction, it is possible to obtain the<br>
desired compound. Further, it is possible to carry out an ar-<br>
bitrary chemical reaction for obtaining the desired compound,<br>
and reacting residual reaction substrate added in excess to<br>
the reaction system, and byproducts, with the reagent for or-<br>
ganic synthesis.<br>
Use of the Reagent for Organic Synthesis as a Synthesis Build-<br>
ing Block<br>
In the case of using the reagent for organic synthesis as<br>
a synthesis building block, for example, consideration can be<br>
given to using the reagent for organic synthesis as a reaction<br>
substrate in a nucleophilic addition reaction, nucleophilic<br>
substitution reaction, dehydration condensation reaction, and<br>
the like. As a reagent for organic synthesis reaction which<br>
can be used in such a reaction, there is no particular limita-<br>
tion, and for example, in the reagent for organic synthesis<br>
shown in Chemical Formula (1), a reagent for organic synthesis<br>
where X is a reagent active site shown by (A) to (H) or (A')<br>
to (H1) can be mentioned. As the solvent used for the reac-<br>
tion, any solvent which can be ordinarily used for these reac-<br>
tions can be used, and in the present embodiment, from the<br>
point of solubility of the reagent for organic synthesis hav-<br>
ing a hydrophobic carrier group, it is possible to use<br>
tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane, cyclohexane/N,N-dimethylfor-<br>
mamide mixed solvent and the like.<br><br>
Use or the Reagent for Organic Synthesis as a Reaction Accel-<br>
erator<br>
The reagent for organic synthesis of the present embodi-<br>
ment can be used as a reaction accelerator. The effect as a<br>
reaction accelerator depends on the properties of the reagent<br>
active site of the reagent for organic synthesis, for example,<br>
the degree of acidity and basicity, the catalytic activity and<br>
the like. A reagent active site having such properties can be<br>
introduced on a hydrophobic carrier group by using a synthesis<br>
building block.<br>
There is no particular limitation on the reagent for or-<br>
ganic synthesis which can be used as a reaction accelerator,<br>
and for example, in the reagent for organic synthesis shown by<br>
Chemical Formula (1), a reagent for organic synthesis where X<br>
is a reagent active site shown by (I), (J), (I') or (J') can<br>
be mentioned. These reagents for organic synthesis show<br>
strong basicity, and by scavenging active hydrogens of the re-<br>
action substrate, can accelerate nucleophilic reactions, de-<br>
protecting reactions, esterification reactions of carboxylic<br>
acids, alkylation reactions of active methyl, alkylation reac-<br>
tions of secondary amines, alkylation reactions of phenols,<br>
and alkylation reactions of thiols.<br>
Acceleration of Deprotecting Reactions<br>
A reagent for organic synthesis having strong basicity can<br>
be used, for example, for the deprotecting reaction of an Fmoc<br>
group (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl group), known as a protect-<br>
ing group of amino groups, and the like, but it is not partic-<br><br>
ularly limited to these reactions. As the solvent used for<br>
the reaction, any one which can be ordinarily used for such<br>
reactions can be used, and in the present embodiment, from the<br>
point of solubility of the reagent for organic synthesis hav-<br>
ing a hydrophobic carrier group, it is possible to use<br>
tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane, cyclohexane/N,N-dimethylfor-<br>
mamide mixed solvent and the like.<br>
The added amount of the reagent for organic synthesis used<br>
in the reaction can be appropriately set by one skilled in the<br>
art in consideration of the solubility of the reagent for or-<br>
ganic synthesis in the used solvent, the equilibrium constant<br>
of the acid-base equilibrium of the basic groups, the reaction<br>
stoichiometry, and the like, and generally, it is preferable<br>
to add one to five, times the theoretically required amount.<br>
Further, a reagent for organic synthesis having a strong<br>
basicity, in the same was as its use as an accelerator or a<br>
deprotecting reaction, can be used as an accelerator of a nu-<br>
cleophilic reaction, deprotecting reaction, esterification re-<br>
action of a carboxylic acid, alkylation reaction of an active<br>
methylene, alkylation reaction of an amine, alkylation reac-<br>
tion of a phenol, alkylation reaction of a thiol, and the<br>
like. In these cases, it is possible to use the same solvent<br>
as the solvent used for a deprotecting reaction, and further,<br>
it is possible to accelerate the reaction by adding the<br>
reagent for organic synthesis in an amount which is the same<br>
as that of the reagent for organic synthesis used to acceler-<br>
ate deprotecting reactions.<br><br>
Use of the Reagent for Organic Synthesis as a Condensation<br>
Agent<br>
The reagent for organic synthesis of the present embodi-<br>
ment can be used as a condensation agent. For example, the<br>
reagent for organic synthesis can be used as condensation<br>
agent replacing the triphenylphosphine and diethyl azodicar-<br>
boxylate required in the dehydration condensation reaction<br>
publicly known as the Mitsunobu reaction. As such a reagent<br>
for organic synthesis, for example, in the reagent for organic<br>
synthesis shown in Chemical Formula (1), a reagent for organic<br>
synthesis where X is a reagent active site shown by (K), (L),<br>
(K'), or (L') can be mentioned.<br>
The dehydration condensation reaction which can be used in<br>
the present embodiment is not particularly limited, and for<br>
example, ester synthesis reactions, amide synthesis reactions<br>
and ether synthesis reactions can be mentioned. The solvent<br>
used for the reaction is not particularly limited if it is a<br>
solvent which can be ordinarily used for such reactions, and<br>
in the present embodiment, from the point of solubility of the<br>
reagent for organic synthesis having a hydrophobic carrier<br>
group, it is possible to use tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane,<br>
cyclohexane/N,N-dimethylformamide mixed solvent and the like.<br>
The added amount of the reagent for organic synthesis used<br>
in the reaction can be appropriately set by one skilled in the<br>
art in consideration of, for example, in the case of a Mit-<br>
sunobu reaction, the solubility of the reagent for organic<br>
synthesis with respect to the used solvent, the stoichiometry<br><br>
of the Mitsunobu reaction, and the like, and in the case of<br>
adding the reagent for organic synthesis as a substitute sub-<br>
stance of triphenylphosphine, it is preferable to add from 1<br>
to 5 equivalents with respect to one equivalent of the dehy-<br>
drated hydroxyl group, and in the case of adding as a substi-<br>
tute substance for diethyl azodicarboxylate, it is preferable<br>
to add from 1 to 5 equivalents with respect to one equivalent<br>
of the dehydrated hydroxyl group.<br>
Use of the Reagent for Organic Synthesis as a Nucleophilic<br>
Scavenger and an Electrophilic Scavenger<br>
By using the reagent for organic synthesis of the present<br>
embodiment as a nucleophilic scavenger and an electrophilic<br>
scavenger, it is possible to capture electrophilic reagents or<br>
nucleophilic reagents added in excess and remaining unreacted<br>
in the reaction liquid, and compounds having electrophilicity<br>
and nucleophilicity produced as byproducts in the chemical re-<br>
action. Alternatively, in the case of using the reagent for<br>
organic synthesis of the present embodiment as a nucleophilic<br>
scavenger, and an electrophilic scavenger, it is also possible<br>
to bond it to the unreacted reaction substrate, and make the<br>
reaction proceed on the reagent for organic synthesis. The<br>
reagent for organic synthesis which can be used in such reac-<br>
tions is not particularly limited, and for example, in the<br>
reagent for organic synthesis shown in Chemical Formula (1), a<br>
reagent for organic synthesis wherein the reagent active site<br>
X is shown by (A) to (C) or (A') to (C) if a nucleophilic<br>
scavenger, or the reagent active site X is shown by (D) to (H)<br><br>
and (M), or (D') to (H') and (M') if an electrophilic scav-<br>
enger, can be mentioned.<br>
The added amount of the reagent for organic synthesis used<br>
in the reaction can be appropriately set by one skilled in the<br>
art in consideration of the solubility of the reagent for or-<br>
ganic synthesis with respect to the used solvent, and the<br>
electrophilicity and nucleophilicity of the compound to be<br>
captured and the like, and it is preferable to add from 1 to 5<br>
equivalents of the reagent for organic synthesis with respect<br>
to one equivalent of the expected residual amount of the nu-<br>
cleophilic or electrophilic reaction substrate.<br>
For the case of using the reagent for organic synthesis of<br>
the present embodiment as a nucleophilic scavenger, for exam-<br>
ple, a form of use such as the following can be mentioned.<br>
Namely, in the case of carrying out a peptide synthesis<br>
reaction using an active amino acid in an N,N-dimethylfor-<br>
mamide/propionitrile mixed solvent, a peptide bond is formed<br>
when adding an excess amount of the activated amino acid with<br>
respect to the N terminal amino group of the peptide. Because<br>
the excess active amino acid remaining in the reaction system<br>
has electrophilicity, it is easy to form an ester bond with<br>
this by adding the compound shown in Chemical Formula (2).<br>
After the reaction, by adding a solvent such as cyclohexane or<br>
the like, it is possible to recover the nucleophilic scavenger<br>
bonded to the active amino acid from the amide layer, and a<br>
peptide to which 1 amino acid residue is attached, at the N<br>
terminal of the peptide before the reaction, remains in the<br><br>
reaction system.<br>
Use of the Reagent for Organic Synthesis as a Peptide Synthe-<br>
sis Reagent<br>
Among the reagents for organic synthesis of the present<br>
embodiment, those shown by Chemical Formula (1) where X indi-<br>
cates (M) or (M') can be used as electrophilic scavengers, and<br>
especially, can be used as peptide synthesis reagents. In the<br>
case of use as a peptide synthesis reagent, in the reagent ac-<br>
tive site shown by Chemical Formulas (M) and (M1), a carbon<br>
atom bonded to the hydroxyl group in the reagent active site,<br>
as well as a carbon atom bonded to the hailogen atom which is<br>
not directly bonded to the benzene ring, have electrophilici-<br>
ty, and thus can bond with the carboxyl group of the amino<br>
acid, and thus the peptide synthesis reaction can be carried<br>
out by sequentially forming bonds to an activated amino acid<br>
in the state wherein the carboxyl group is bonded to the<br>
reagent for organic synthesis.<br>
At the completion of the peptide synthesis reaction, by<br>
adding acid to the reagent for organic synthesis separated<br>
from the reaction system, it is possible to easily separate<br>
only the peptide. Here, the reagent for organic synthesis<br>
having a reagent active site (M) or (M') does not activate the<br>
carbonyl group when the amino acid is bonded to the reagent<br>
for organic synthesis, and thus there is no generation of in-<br>
termediates having an oxazolone skeleton which would lead to<br>
racimization of the a carbon, and thus in the process of pep-<br>
tide synthesis, racimization of the peptide does not occur.<br><br>
Further, applications of the reagent for organic synthesis<br>
having a reagent active site (M) or (M') are not limited to<br>
applications as a reagent for peptide synthesis. Specifical-<br>
ly, for example, applications as a hydrophobic carrier group,<br>
by reacting the reagent for organic synthesis having a reagent<br>
active site with the desired compound, can be mentioned. Such<br>
reagents for organic synthesis used as a hydrophobic carrier<br>
group are also included within the scope of the present inven-<br>
tion.<br>
Use of the Reagent for Organic Synthesis as a Metal Ligand<br>
By using the reagent for organic synthesis as a metal lig-<br>
and, the reagent for organic synthesis can coordinate with and<br>
capture metal ions added to the reaction system as catalysts<br>
or the like.. The reagent for organic synthesis which can be<br>
used for such a reaction is not particularly limited, and for<br>
example, in the reagent for organic synthesis shown by Chemi-<br>
cal Formula (1), a reagent for organic synthesis where X is a<br>
reagent active site shown by (K) or (K') can be mentioned.<br>
The added amount of the reagent for organic synthesis used<br>
in the reaction can be appropriately set by one skilled in the<br>
art in consideration of the solubility of the reagent for or-<br>
ganic synthesis with respect to the solvent, and the normal<br>
coordination number of the metal ion and the like, and it is<br>
preferable to add from 1 to 5 equivalents of the reagent for<br>
organic synthesis with respect to one equivalent of the added<br>
metal ion.<br>
For the case of using the reagent for organic synthesis as<br><br>
a nucleophilic scavenger, electrophilic scavenger, or metal<br>
ion ligand, in the chemical reaction preceding the reaction<br>
for trapping the excess compounds and the like, it is possible<br>
to use a solvent commonly used in this reaction, and in the<br>
present embodiment, from the point of the solubility of the<br>
reagent for organic synthesis having a hydrophobic carrier<br>
group, it is preferable to use tetrahydrofuran,<br>
dichloromethane, a cyclohexane/N,N-dimethylformamide mixed<br>
solvent or the like as the solvent.<br>
Separation Step<br>
The reagent for organic synthesis of the present embodi-<br>
ment reacts sharply to changes in the solution composition<br>
and/or temperature, and crystallizes. Because of this, it is<br>
possible to crystallize the reagent for organic synthesis us-<br>
ing the means of changing the composition and/or temperature<br>
of the solution. Further, the separation step of the reagent<br>
for organic synthesis can by carried out by liquid liquid ex-<br>
traction separation, by adding a separation solvent which is<br>
immiscible with the reaction solvent used in the reaction<br>
step, but which can easily dissolve the reagent for organic<br>
synthesis.<br>
Separation by Changing the Solution Composition<br>
As a preferred means for changing the solution composi-<br>
tion, for example, the means of adding a poor solvent for the<br>
reagent for organic synthesis to the reaction solution can be<br>
mentioned. Here, by adding a solvent with high affinity for<br>
the reaction solvent, there is no phase separation of the liq-<br><br>
uid phase, and thus is it possible to easily change the solu-<br>
tion composition. As the poor solvent, it is possible to use<br>
any solvent, and it is possible to use the same solvent used<br>
as the reaction solvent, and a solvent which differs form the<br>
reaction solvent. For example, in the case of using<br>
dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran and diethylether or the like<br>
as the reaction solvent, it is possible to use acetonitrile,<br>
N,N-dimethylformamide, and methanol and the like as the poor<br>
solvent. By adding the poor solvent to the reaction solvent,<br>
the polarity of the solution increases, and the reagent for<br>
organic synthesis, and the reacted reagent for organic synthe-<br>
sis can crystallize and solid liquid separation becomes possi-<br>
ble. When carrying out the solid liquid separation, it is<br>
possible to use a suction filter such as, for example, a sepa-<br>
ratory funnel, and in order to complete the separation of the<br>
products from a reagent having a hydrophobic carrier group, an<br>
octadecylsilylated (ODS) silica gel filter or an ODS short<br>
column may be used.<br>
Separation by Concentration of the Solution<br>
As another preferable means for changing the solution com-<br>
position, for example, the means of concentrating the solvent<br>
of the solution in which the reagent for organic synthesis,<br>
and the reacted reagent for organic synthesis are dissolved,<br>
can be mentioned. Here, concentrating refers to distilling<br>
away a part of the solvent. When distilling a part of the<br>
solvent, it is preferable to carry out the distillation within<br>
a range wherein the reagent for organic synthesis, and the re-<br><br>
acted reagent for organic synthesis crystallize, while the<br>
synthesized desired compound does not crystallize. These con-<br>
ditions can be appropriately set by one skilled in the art in<br>
consideration of the added amount of the reagent for organic<br>
synthesis, the estimated produced amount of the desired com-<br>
pound, the solubility of each compound and the like.<br>
Separation by Changing the Solution Temperature<br>
In the separation step, by changing the solution tempera-<br>
ture, it is possible to crystallize and separate the reagent<br>
for organic synthesis and the reacted reagent for organic syn-<br>
thesis. In the present embodiment, as a preferably used means<br>
for changing the solution temperature, there is no particular<br>
limitation so long as it is a means for changing the tempera-<br>
ture of the solution in which the reagent for organic synthe-<br>
sis and the reacted reagent for organic synthesis are dis-<br>
solved. Specifically, the means of cooling the solution can<br>
be mentioned. For example, in the case of using cyclohexane<br>
as the reaction solvent, by cooling to 5°C or less, it is pos-<br>
sible to crystallize the reagent for organic synthesis and the<br>
reacted reagent for organic synthesis. Further, in the case<br>
of using N,N-dimethylformamide as the reaction solvent, by<br>
heating in the reaction step, the solubility of the reagent<br>
for organic synthesis increases, and by cooling after the re-<br>
action, the reagent for organic synthesis and the reacted<br>
reagent for organic synthesis can be crystallized.<br>
In the case of crystallizing the reagent for organic syn-<br>
thesis by changing the solution composition and the solution<br><br>
temperature, by adding octadecylsilylated silica gel, glass<br>
beads or the like as crystallization seeds, it is possible to<br>
easily form the crystals.<br>
Separation by Liquid Liquid Extraction<br>
In the separation step, by adding a separation solvent<br>
which does not mix with the reaction solvent in which the<br>
reagent for organic synthesis is dissolved in the reaction<br>
step, and for which the solubility of the reagent for organic<br>
synthesis is greater than the solubility of the reagent for<br>
organic synthesis in the reaction solvent, it is possible to<br>
dissolve the reagent for organic synthesis and the reacted<br>
reagent for organic synthesis in the separation solvent. By<br>
separating with a separatory funnel the separation solvent in<br>
which the reagent for organic synthesis, and the reacted<br>
reagent for organic synthesis are dissolved, it is possible to<br>
easily separate the reagent for organic synthesis, and the re-<br>
acted reagent for organic synthesis from the reaction solvent.<br>
In the present embodiment, the separation solvent which<br>
can be used is not particularly limited, and in the case of<br>
using acetonitrile, propionitrile, and N,N-dimethylformamide<br>
or the like as a reaction solvent, for example, cyclohexane,<br>
and decalin or the like can be used.<br>
Namely, for example, in the case of using N,N-dimethylfor-<br>
mamide as the reaction solvent, by adding cyclohexane as the<br>
separation solvent to the reaction system after the completion<br>
of the chemical reaction, heating, and then cooling, the<br>
reagent for organic synthesis, and the reacted reagent for or-<br><br>
ganic synthesis are selectively distributed into the cyclohex-<br>
ane phase. By separating the cyclohexane phase with a separa-<br>
tory funnel, it is possible to obtain an N,N-dimethylformamide<br>
solution from which the reagent for organic synthesis, and the<br>
reacted reagent for organic synthesis have been removed.<br>
In the method of organic synthesis reaction of the present<br>
embodiment, after separating the reagent for organic synthe-<br>
sis, it is possible to further carry out a process for sepa-<br>
rating the reagent for organic synthesis and an atomic group<br>
bonded to the reaction active site, and to isolate the sepa-<br>
rated atomic group. In such a case, as a reagent which can be<br>
used when separating the reagent for organic synthesis and the<br>
atomic group bonded to the reaction active site, trifluoroac-<br>
etate,.and acids such as hydrochloric acid and the like; bases<br>
such as sodium hydroxide; as well as hydrogenation catalysts<br>
such as palladium and the like can be mentioned. Among these,<br>
trifluoroacetate can be preferably used.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The present invention is explained below with reference to<br>
the following Examples, but the present invention is not in<br>
any way limited by these examples.<br>
Example 1: Synthesis of an Amine Having a Hydrophobic Carrier<br>
Group<br>
One gram of 2,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde, 8.4 g of 1-bromod-<br>
ocosane, and 6 g of potassium carbonate were dissolved in 20<br>
ml of N,N-dimethylformamide, and reacted for 8 hours under a<br><br>
