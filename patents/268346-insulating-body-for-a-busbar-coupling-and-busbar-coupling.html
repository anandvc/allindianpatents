Insulating body for a busbar coupling, and busbar coupling<br>
The invention relates to an insulating body for a busbar coupling for holding contact pieces which are connected by means of a connection element and are associated with switch panels of the switchgear assembly, which insulating body has a hollow-cylindrical internal contour with a centering means for the connection element.<br>
An insulating body such as this is known from DE 101 19 333 C5. The insulating body disclosed there is designed to hold contact pieces which are associated with switch panels of a switchgear assembly. A connection element which runs within the contact pieces is used to connect the contact pieces. The hollow-cylindrical internal contour of the insulating body rests externally on the contact pieces and, centrally, has a centering means in the form of a circumferential ring, which centering means is used as an assembly aid for the arrangement of the connection element.<br>
One object of the present invention is to design an insulating body of the type mentioned initially which allows simple assembly in a busbar coupling.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved for an insulating body of the type mentioned initially in that the insulating body surrounds the connection element and the contact pieces at a distance, and in that the centering means is formed by a plurality of studs, which are arranged distributed on the internal contour.<br><br>
An insulating body of this type can be assembled in an advantageous manner since, because its internal diameter is larger than the external diameter of the contact pieces, there is no need on the one hand for pushing onto the contact pieces with a large amount of effort and an accurate fit and, on the other hand, the centering means, which is in the form of a plurality of studs, allows flexible centering of the connection element such that, in the event of any slight misalignment of switch panels to be connected in a switchgear assembly, the required flexibility to compensate for the misalignment is provided by the studs as centering means.<br>
In a further refinement of the invention, the internal contour and the studs have a conductive coating. A conductive coating such as this is particularly advantageous because this allows field control in a simple manner. The conductive coating on the studs results in contact being made between the connection element and the insulating body in a simple manner, with the conductive coating on the insulating body resulting in the entire insulating body being at the same potential as the contact pieces and connection element when in the installed state, as a result of which no partial discharge processes can occur in the cavity which is formed between the insulating body and the connection element.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the conductive coating is formed from a wear-resistant conductive lacquer. A wear-resistant conductive lacquer such as this is particularly advantageous because this allows assembly simply by pushing the connection element into the insulating body, without any adverse effect on the field control characteristics of the insulating body.<br><br>
In a further refinement of the invention, an outer conductive layer is provided on the insulating body. An outer conductive layer such as this is particularly advantageous in order to achieve a field reduction of the potential in the insulating body.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to a busbar coupling for a switchgear assembly for connection of two switch panels with insulating bushes for each switch panel, which each surround one contact piece and have a connection element for connection of the contact pieces as well as an insulating element which has a hollow-cylindrical internal contour with a centering means for the connection element.<br>
A busbar coupling such as this is likewise known from DE 101 19 333 C5. The busbar coupling, as disclosed there, for a switchgear assembly for connection of two switch panels of the switchgear assembly comprises insulating bushes for each switch panel. The insulating bushes each surround one contact piece. A connection element for connection of the contact pieces is in this case surrounded by an insulating element with a hollow-cylindrical internal contour and with a centering means for the connection element. In this case, the insulating element from DE 101 19 333 C5 surrounds the contact pieces of the busbar coupling in an interlocking manner.<br>
The object of the present invention is to design a busbar coupling of the type mentioned above which has a flexible configuration with simple assembly.<br>
According to the invention, this is achieved in the case of a busbar coupling such as this in that the insulating element is in the form of an insulating body according to the invention as described above.<br><br>
Since the insulating element is in the form of an insulating body according to the invention, the busbar coupling according to the invention on the one hand can advantageously be assembled easily because the characteristics of the insulating body according to the invention avoid the need for the effort to push the insulating body onto the contact pieces with an accurate fit, while on the other hand allowing simple assembly, with any minor misalignments between the switch panels to be connected being compensated for.<br>
Further refinements and preferred embodiments of the busbar coupling according to the invention will become evident from the dependent claims and from the exemplary embodiment.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail in the following text using the drawing and one exemplary embodiment, with reference to the attached figures, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a cross-sectional view of one exemplary embodiment of a busbar coupling according to the invention, with one exemplary embodiment of an insulating body according to the invention; and<br>
Figure 2 shows a cross-sectional view through one exemplary embodiment of an insulating body according to the invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows one exemplary embodiment of a busbar coupling 1 for connection of two switch panels 2 and 3 of a switchgear assembly, for example of a gas-insulated medium-voltage switchgear assembly. The busbar coupling 1 has a design which is essentially symmetrical with respect to an axis A, with the design of the busbar coupling 1 being explained with reference to the switch panel 2 in the following text, and with corresponding<br><br>
parts which are designed to be the same for the switch panel 3 being provided with the same reference symbols with an apostrophe.<br>
An insulating bush 4 has a contact piece 5 which is encapsulated in it and can be connected by means of a screw union 6 to a conductor, which is not illustrated in the figure, of the switchgear assembly. At its end which projects into an internal-conical cavity 7, the contact piece 5 has a spherical configuration, or in other words a ball end 8. A completely circumferential attachment flange 9 is encapsulated in the insulating bush 4 and is in the form of a control electrode 11 at its encapsulated end 10. The bail ends 8, 8' of the contact pieces 5, 5' are conductively connected to one another via a connection element 12, with the connection element 12 in the exemplary embodiment having a plurality of segments which are arranged circumferentially one behind the other and are held in a cylindrical shape by means of annular springs 13, 14. An internal sleeve 15 is provided in the interior of the connection element 12, in order to support and provide the shape for the connection element 12. An insulating body 16 composed of an elastic material, for example silicone rubber, extends into the insulating bushes 4 and 4' into the area of the internal-conical cavities 7 and 7', and has an internal diameter which is greater than the external diameter of the connection element 12 and of the contact pieces 5, 5' . An external contour of the insulating body 16 in this case has two external-conical sections 17 and 18, which are designed to produce an accurate fit with the internal-conical cavities 7, 7' in the insulating bushes 4, 4' . A centering means 19 is provided centrally in the area of the axis A on the insulating body 16 and is used for holding and centering the connection element 12. The insulating body 16 has a conductive coating 20, which extends over the hollow-cylindrical internal contour of the insulating body 16 and beyond the centering means 19. The<br><br>
conductive coating 20 thus makes contact with the connection element 12<br><br>
in the area of the centering means. Supporting sleeves 21 and 22 are provided in order to make the insulating body 16 robust, and the external diameters of these supporting sleeves 21 and 22 correspond to the internal diameter of the hollow-cylindrical internal contour of the insulating body 16, and they are designed to absorb the compression-pressure forces during assembly of the busbar coupling 1. The insulating body 16 furthermore has an outer conductive layer 23, which is intended for field reduction together with the conductive coating 20 and the control electrodes 11, 11' . The control electrodes 11, 11' are in this case aligned such that the outer conductive layer 23 of the insulating body has the load from the electric field strength in the area of its ends reduced, as a result of which there are no field peaks in this area.<br>
Figure 2 shows a cross-sectional view through one exemplary embodiment of an insulating body 16 according to the invention as shown in Figure 1. In the interior, the insulating body 16 has the hollow-cylindrical internal contour 24 on which the centering means 19 is arranged, in the form of circumf erentially arranged studs 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 and 30, centrally with respect to the longitudinal extent of the insulating body 16. In the exemplary embodiment, the multiplicity of the studs are formed by six studs separated by angles of 60 degrees, although other configurations are likewise possible here.<br>
The conductive coating 20 and the outer conductive layer 23 are in this case formed from a wear-resistant conductive lacquer, for example from a silicone lacquer with carbon-black particles added to it, thus ensuring secure assembly while maintaining the field control characteristics of the inner and outer conductive layers.<br><br><br><br>
