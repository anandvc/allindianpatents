				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparing silicon carbide<br>
and optionally aluminum and silumin (aluminum silicon alloy) in a salt melt. Silica<br>
and silicate rocks and/or aluminum containing silicate rocks are used as raw material,<br>
with/without soda (Na2C03) and/or limestone (CaC03) dissolved in fluorides,<br>
in particular cryolite.<br>
The products prepared are of high purity.<br>
WO 95/33870 (EP patent 763151), in the following designated as "WO<br>
95", discloses a process for continuous preparation and batch preparation in one<br>
or more steps in one or more furnaces, of silicon (Si), optionally silumin (AlSialloys)<br>
and/or aluminum metal (Al) in a melting bath using feldspar or feldspar<br>
containing rocks dissolved in fluoride. In said process Si of high purity is prepared<br>
by electrolysis (step I) in a first furnace with a replaceable carbon anode arranged<br>
underneath the cathode, and a carbon cathode arranged at the top of the<br>
furnace. For the preparation of silumin the silicon-reduced residual electrolyte<br>
from step I is transferred to another furnace, and Al is added (step II). Then Al is<br>
prepared in a third furnace (step III) by electrolysis after Si has been removed in<br>
step I and possibly in step II. It also describes combinations of furnaces with a<br>
partition wall in the preparation of the same substances. Further, process equipment<br>
for the procedure is described.<br>
The present invention represents a further development and improvement<br>
of the above-mentioned process.<br>
The most important further development is that SiC of high purity is prepared<br>
in molten Si, as explained below.<br>
A great improvement is that it is possible to prepare pure Si (which is converted<br>
to SiC), pure low-iron low-alloyed Al-alloys (AlSi-alloys) and pure lowphosphorus<br>
high-alloyed Al-alloys (SiAI-alloys) in the same furnace (step I) by<br>
varying such parameters as the choice of raw material, current density (voltage)<br>
and time. The proportions of the Si and Al-products are adjusted by the choice of<br>
raw material and cathodic current density (voltage) in the electrolysis bath and<br>
mechanical manipulation of the cathodes. Further the; r.nmnn.sition of the Al2<br>
(AlSi-alloy) as referred to herein, is an Al-alloy with an amount of Si which is<br>
lower than that of an eutectic mixture (12% Si, 88% Al). Correspondingly, a highalloyed<br>
alloy (SiAI-alloy) as.referred to herein is an alloy having a Si-content<br>
above that of an eutectic mixture.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a process for preparing<br>
silicon carbide and optionally aluminum and silumin (aluminum silicon alloy)<br>
in the same cell, step I. Carbon is added to the Si fraction in step II, and SiC is<br>
crystallized from molten Si and C in step III. The process takes place by<br>
I. subjecting silicate and/or quartz containing rocks to electrolysis in a salt<br>
melt consisting of a fluoride-containing electrolysis bath, whereby silicon<br>
and aluminum are formed in the same bath, and aluminum<br>
formed, which may be low alloyed, flows downwards to the bottom and<br>
is optionally drawn off,<br>
II. carbon powder from the cathode material and/or from external sources<br>
is added directly to the molten bath or frozen bath in addition to cathode<br>
deposit, the frozen, bath and the cathode deposit being crushed<br>
before or after the addition of carbon particles;<br>
III. the obtained mixture is melted at a temperature above 1420°C, and<br>
SiC is crystallized by cooling.<br>
Soda may be added to the electrolysis bath so that said bath will be basic<br>
if quartz is used, in order to avoid loss of Si in the form of volatile Sip4. With high<br>
concentrations of soda the melting point of the mixture is reduced, and the use of<br>
added fluorides goes down. Limestone is added if necessary to reduce the absorption<br>
of phosphorus in the Si deposited on the cathode.<br>
In connection with the crystallization the fluorides should preferably be<br>
acidic.<br>
A new feature according to the invention is that carbon which has either<br>
been taken from the cathode (e.g. as turnings) or from external sources, is mixed<br>
with silicon (in electrolyte). The carbon powder may then either be added to the<br>
molten bath and/or added to the solid frozen bath and/or the cathode deposit. If<br>
molten bath or frozen bath is used the cathode deposit must in advance be<br>
scraped into the bath. The carbon is mixed with the desired fractions and<br>
crushed to desired grain size. The obtained mixture consisting of Si, electrolyte<br>
and C is either melted directly or preferably subjected to acid treatment as described<br>
below. If acid treatment is employed, the melting of the acid-treated powder<br>
will correspond to step III. Carbon must in any case be added in stoichiometric<br>
excess to obtain a complete conversion to SiC in the Si melting process, steps<br>
II and III.<br>
An advantageous alternative is that concentrated H2SO4 is added to the<br>
untreated, pulverized cathode deposit (step II) containing 20% Si, and/or the pulverized<br>
bath (electrolyte) containing 20% Si after the cathode deposit has been<br>
scraped into the bath, and carbon. The powder fractions initially result in a concentration<br>
of Si to about 50% as the sulfuric acid has a good dissolving effect on<br>
cryolite. This mixture of 50% Si and other residual products, i.a. acidic sulfates,<br>
represents a sticky substance which must be treated further. By diluting the mixture<br>
with water and adding HCI in dilute amounts for some time a very good liberation<br>
of Si-grains floating to the surface is achieved. The HCI addition has the<br>
effect in addition to the refining of Si, that the powder mixture does not remain<br>
sticky. In this manner it is possible to obtain an increase in concentration of Si<br>
together with C in a Si/C/electrolyte grain mixture with a sand-water consistency.<br>
This sand-water consistency has the effect that the mixture is easy to filter and is<br>
washed with water and dried at room temperature. As a consequence of the increase<br>
of the concentration of Si and C in the powder mixture, the use of jig as a<br>
separator (WO 97) becomes superfluous. What happens is that the acidic mixture<br>
gradually reacts with the electrolyte and dissolves it. The Si-grains which are<br>
partly embedded in electrolyte, are gradually liberated and get in contact with the<br>
acid/water mixture. The acidic water attacks the contaminations in Si and C,<br>
which primarily consist of metals. Hydrogen gas is formed on the surface and in<br>
the pores of the Si- and C-grains, which results in an uplift even in very dilute<br>
acid. In addition to the fact that Si (d = 2,3 g/cm3) and C (d = 2,1 g/cm3) float up<br>
to the surface of the water, the Si- and C-grains will be hanging there until they<br>
are scraped away from the surface. The refining of the Si-grains has also been<br>
improved in addition to the concentration, since the acids over a longer time get<br>
in better contact with the liberated Si- and C-grains. (The Si- and C-grains are so<br>
pure that one gets below the detection limit for all the elements analyzed with<br>
microprobe equipment. This means that there is not any analysis method which<br>
can determine Si purer than about 99.99% as long it is impossible to concentrate<br>
Si to -100% from a Si/C/electrolyte grain mixture).<br>
Example 1 (from WO 95)<br>
I. A feldspar of the type CaAI2Si208 containing 50% SiO2) 31% AI2O3 and<br>
0,8% Fe2Os, was dissolved in cryolite and electrolyzed with a cathodic current<br>
density of 0,05 A7cm2 (U = 2,5-3,0 V) for 18,5 hours. In the deposit around the<br>
cathode highly purified Si was formed separate from small FeSi-grains. In the<br>
electrolyte dissolved AI203 was formed. Al is not formed when the current density<br>
is so low.<br>
Since Al was not formed in the bath (Al^-containing electrolyte) this was<br>
the reason why bath was drawn off from this furnace (step I) and to another furnace<br>
(step II) in which residues of Si and Si(IV) were removed by addition of Al<br>
before the electrolysis and the preparation of Al in a third furnace (step III). (See<br>
WO 95).<br>
II. The cathode deposit which contained about 20% Si, was knocked off the<br>
cathode. In addition carbon (graphite, C) from the cathode followed. The obtained<br>
mixture of powder was acid washed as described above to obtain a mixture<br>
in which the concentration of Si and C had been increased.<br>
III. The mixture from II together with residues of acid fluorides was melted<br>
above 1420°. The crystallized Si contained large areas with "highly purified" SIC<br>
as demonstrated by microprobe analysis. The purity in the sample was 99,997 %<br>
SiC in a matrix consisting of 99,997-99,99999 % Si.<br>
Conclusion: The reason why not only SiC was obtained, was a stoichiometric<br>
deficit of carbon in the Si-melt, steps II-III. The reason why Si only and not Al was<br>
formed in step I in this case, was the low current density (voltage).<br>
Example 2 (Alternative process for step I with formation of Al)<br>
A diorite (rock) containing feldspar and quartz, analyzed to contain 72%<br>
SiO2, 16% AI2O3 and 1,4% Fe2O3l was dissolved in cryolite and electrolyzed at a<br>
cathodic current density of 0,5-1,6 A/cm2 (U = 2,5-8,0 V)for 16.5 hours. In the<br>
deposit around the cathode highly purified Si and many small separate FeSigrains<br>
were formed. Underneath the electrolyte Al (low-alloyed AlSi-alloy) was<br>
formed, and this had a low iron content.<br>
5<br>
Conclusion: The reason why both Si and Al were formed in step I was the high<br>
current density (voltage). The reason why the Al (AlSi-alloy) has a low iron content,<br>
was that the FeSi-grains remain in the deposit on the cathode.<br>
Carbon was not added in the experiment. SiC could therefore not be<br>
formed.<br>
It must be expected that if carbon is added to a steadily purer Si, the purity<br>
of the resulting SiC will also be increased.<br>
Example 3 (Alternative process for step I with formation of Al)<br>
Quartz containing close to 99,9% Si02 was dissolved in cryolite (NasAIFe),<br>
mixed with 5% soda (Na2CO3) and electrolyzed with a cathodic current density of<br>
0.5 A/cm2 (U = 6-7 V) for 44 hours. In the deposit around the cathode highly purified<br>
Si was formed. Most of (12 kg) of the cathode deposit was pushed into the<br>
bath (the electrolyte). The remaining cathode deposit (8 kg) was lifted out with<br>
the cathodes together with the residues of the anode. The cathode deposit was<br>
easily knocked off the cathodes and was mixed with the electrolyte in the bath.<br>
Both contained 20% Si. Small amounts of Al (low alloyed AlSi-alloy) were formed,<br>
which were low in iron and phosphorus. Iron and phosphorus poor AlSi-alloys are<br>
defined as 
110 ppm Fe and 0,08 ppm P. The crystallized silicon contained a total of 3 ppm<br>
contamination corresponding to 99,9997 % Si.<br>
Conclusion: The reason why both Si and Al were formed in step I was the high<br>
current density (voltage). Al originates from electrolyzed cryolite. The reason why<br>
Al (the AlSi-alloy) was now high alloyed with Si, was that Si from the cathode deposit<br>
starts to dissolve in Al. The reason why the Al-alloy is iron and phosphorus<br>
poor was that the raw materials initially are low in iron and phosphorus.<br>
The silicon together with residues of small grains of FeSi prepared by acid<br>
refining as described above without carbon addition, contains a total of 75 ppm<br>
Fe and about 15 ppm P. The concentrated Si powder mixture contained 80% Si<br>
or more than 80% Si. After crystallization of Si from the Si-melt, Si contained only<br>
3,0 ppm contaminations. A mixing of slag with the acidic fluorides in Si will promote<br>
the formation of an even purer SiC. In a possible crystallization of SiC from<br>
a fluoride-refined Si-melt which also contains carbon, one must expect an even<br>
lower content of contaminations in SiC than demonstrated in example 1.<br>
If it is desired to prepare Al together with Si, the cathodic current density<br>
should be relatively high, at least above 0,05 A/cm2, preferably above 0,1, in particular<br>
above 0,2 A/cm2. An upper limit is about 2, preferably about 1,6 A/cm2. In<br>
addition to the formation of aluminum with a high current density, the electrolysis<br>
rate also increases with increasing cathodic current density.<br>
With electrolysis it was found that the purity of Si was in the range 99,92 -<br>
99,99%. Previously (W095), in order to concentrate Si further above 20% from<br>
the cathode deposit, the cathode deposit was crushed so that as much as possible<br>
of free and partly not free Si-grains would float up and could be taken up on<br>
the surface in a heavy liquid consisting of different C2H2Br4/acetone mixtures with<br>
a density of up to 2,96 g/cm3. Si in solid form has a density of 2.3 g/cm3 and will<br>
float up, while solids of cryolite have a density of 3 g/cm3 and will remain at a bottom.<br>
After filtration and drying of the powder for removal of heavy liquid, the different<br>
concentration fractions were mixed with water/H2SO4/HCI for refining Si.<br>
In WO 97/27143, in the following designated as "WO 97", water, HCI and<br>
H2SO4 in this order were added to crushed cathode deposit, containing 20% Si,<br>
to refine Si with a dilute NaOH which was formed by adding water. Then it was<br>
tried to concentrate the powder containing Si refined with HCI, with concentrated<br>
H2SO4.<br>
Neither in WO 95 nor in WO 97 Si was concentrated more than to about<br>
40%. The reason for this is that the fluorooxosilicate complexes in the cathode<br>
deposit were hydrolyzed in water and NaOH to form a difficultly soluble hydrated<br>
silica. As a consequence of this an addition of H2SO4 after the treatment with water<br>
did not accomplish the concentration effect which it has when added directly<br>
to untreated dry powder. Concentrated HCI does not have any essential concentrating<br>
effect as it contains much water in contrast to concentrated H2S04. In WO<br>
97 a jig was used to concentrate Si further. This resulted only in an insignificant<br>
concentration.<br>
When it is primarily desired to prepare SiC, a quartz containing rock is<br>
suitably used as starting material. If Al is also of interest, a rock containing an Alrich<br>
feldspar, for instance anorthite (CaAI2Si2O8) is suitably used.<br>
Si may be melted together with Al prepared in the electrolysis (step I), to<br>
form Fe-poor, P-poor, low alloyed A|Si-alloys and/or high alloyed SiAI-alloys,<br>
which are desired alloys in many connections.<br>
Both the high alloyed SiAI-alloys and the low-alioyed AtSi-alloys may be<br>
dissolved in HCI or H2SO4. Al goes into solution and "pure"-Si-powder (-100%<br>
Si), free of electrolyte, is formed. From dissolved Al pure products of AlCb and<br>
Al2(SO4)3 are formed.<br>
With respect to equipment it is suitable that the waits consisting of graphite<br>
in the electrolysis furnace advantageously can be replaced by SiC or silicon nitride-<br>
bound SiC.<br>
The walls of the electrolysis furnace do not have to consist of Si (WO 95,<br>
figure 2 number 4). Further, Si does not have to cover the anode stem, since a<br>
current jump does not take place between the cathode and anode, even when<br>
they grow together.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
