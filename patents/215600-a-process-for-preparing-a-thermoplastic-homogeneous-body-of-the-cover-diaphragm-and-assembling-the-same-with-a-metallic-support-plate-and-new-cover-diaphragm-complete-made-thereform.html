3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br><br>
PROVISIONAL<br>
The following specification describes the<br>
invention.	<br><br>
COMPLETE The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
4. DESCRIPTION: Starts from page 2.<br>
5. CLAIMS:    2 claims on page no. 14.<br>
6.	DATE AND SIGNATURE : On page no. 14 of the Complete Specification.<br>
7.	ABSTRACT OF THE INVENTION : Given on a separate page<br><br>
The Invention in the endeavor is to replace the sheet metal press part called 'Cover' of Cover Diaphragm Complete used on Air Suction Valve, by a suitable Engineered Plastic Polymer that injection molded using the L-Joint as insert during the manufacturing process.<br>
The invention is a 'Value Engineered Exercise' that is aimed at not only reducing the cost of the product but also eliminating various criticalities involved in the manufacturing process of the 'Cover Diaphragm Prior Art', &amp; simplify the same satisfying all the functional parameters as in the Prior Art without affecting the performance of the product.<br>
PRIOR ART :<br>
The existing design of the Cover Diaphragm Complete uses a Bent Tube called as L-Joint either with a formed end or open tube fitted with Brass jet with a hole of size ranging from diameter 0.5 mm to 0.9 mm as the need of the particular ' Air Suction Valve' required for various Two wheeler application. This 'L-Joint' is furnace brazed using copper as brazing media on a sheet metal press part called 'Cover'; the brazing need to be especially leak proof as the Air is needed to be suctioned out through the hole provided on the L-Joint and not thro' the blow hole formed in the brazing or from any other point. The Brazed assembly of L-Joint with cover is then called as 'Cover Diaphragm Complete' &amp; &amp; is plated suitably with zinc plating &amp; suitable passivation to have sufficient rust Prevention during its performance on the vehicle.<br>
DEFICIENCIES OR DRAWBACKS IN THE EXISTIG ART :<br>
The existing art involves a series of main broad operations to manufacture Cover Complete Diaphragm and those are as below -<br>
a)	Manufacture of L-Joint<br>
b)	Manufacture of Cover<br><br>
Copper  Brazing  of un-plated  L-Joint with  cover,  that  need  to  be<br>
completely leak proof.<br>
Zinc plating of the brazed Cover Diaphragm Complete to satisfy the<br>
plating specifications of plating thickness of min.13µm without having<br>
dull finish white patches, un-plated patches etc.<br>
Check for abnormalities such as -<br>
1.	Blockage of 60.5 hole due to overflow of copper during brazing due to capillary action.<br>
2.	Plating (Zinc) - built up edge formation at the L-Joint formed end during plating that reduces the hole size which is critical.<br>
3.	Flattening operation need to be done to achieve the flatness within 0.1 at the face of 635 of cover; as the brazing is done in the furnace at 700-800°C which affects the flatness of the cover due to temperature in furnace and cooling outside.<br>
4.	Check for a blow hole / leakage at brazing etc.<br>
The above process is highly critical and precision that involves -<br>
a)	costs incurred due to unnecessary movement / transportation of the material; as logistics is too lengthy.<br>
b)	Rejections / Rework at each stage that not only reduces the margin(s) but also give rise to improper process capability which needs 100% inspection that may result in passing further of rejected parts to assembly line.<br>
c)	The general manufacturing lead time from raw material to finished part becomes to high due to its process sequence and criticalities that results into high inventory costs; and further reduces the production capacity for a given period, as the product schedules need to be completed in a given month in order to feed the customer assembly lines. This means lower production in given period.<br><br>
d)	Due to the critical requirement of the leakages at brazing of cover with L-Joint; the tolerance required in both item at the fitment zone are highly precise.<br>
e)	As the product geometry after brazing L-Joint to Cover makes it odd to control parameters involving operators skill instead of machine process for plating process. It becomes very critical to satisfy the plating requirements such as thickness, salt spray tests (corrosion resistance tests), control un-plated patches / dull plating etc. especially at the back side that give rise to visual plating defects such as built up edge at 0O.5 hole.<br>
f)	The manufacturing process of cover using Sheet Metal (M.S.Crca sheets) involves various operations that includes -<br><br>
1.	strip cutting to size.<br>
2.	blanking<br>
3.	05.00 hole piercing and proving the form for holding the L-Joint upright.<br>
4.	Forming stages of the cover using power presses: to form depth 6.5mm.<br>
5.	Piercing hole (mounting)04.2 +0.2 (2 Nos.) and maintaining distance 37.2+/-0.1.<br>
6.	Flattening operation to maintain the bottom face of Diameter 35.00mm, flat within 0.1mm. These processes give rise to various process flaws such as burr formation at the piercing no proper control at hole size05.OO where L -Joint is held.<br>
THE PURPOSE OF THE INVENTION :<br>
Considering the criticalities of processing, precision tolerance specifications, logistics involved in the manufacturing of the Cover Diaphragm Complete - Prior Art &amp;<br><br>
need to reduce the rejections, optimizing the cost structure to benefit the end user, a need was felt to review the aspects of the design - Prior Art &amp; the 'PURPOSE' of the new invention is to simplify the 'Existing Art' to a new invention using 'Value engineering Techniques' satisfying all the functional /performance criteria that provides a better product quality at lesser price to benefit the end user reducing the manufacturing lead time to the optimum possible level in this mass production, recurring requirement item on a monthly basis.<br>
This invention relates to a new cover diaphragm complete made from plastic / polymer for use on air suction valve and a method of preparing the same. In order to manufacture the 'Cover Diaphragm complete in plastic such as either plain or glass reinforced or mineral filled or talc filled engineering polymers as detailed below can be used .<br>
1.	Dupont polyamides - Zytel HTN with Glass reinforced grades such as '53 G or 54 G'<br>
2.	Glass filled 15% ~50% nylon 6.6 (natural or any colour)<br>
3.	Acetyl co-polymer plain or glass reinforced.<br>
4.	Nylon 6 plain or glass reinforced to any per cent ranging from 15-50%.<br>
5.	Polypropylene - co-polymer or homopolymer with glass or mineral filled or talc filled to the extent of 40%.<br>
6.	'Linear PPS/PPS' (Poly Phenylene Sulfide) plain or glass reinforced in the range from 15-50% of any colour (grades commonly named as 'Fortran'.<br>
7.	PBT (Poly Butyl Terepthalate) - plain or glass filled in the range 15 to 50%.<br>
Considering the application, weatherability and other functional requirements we have selected Dupont Zytel nylons as per grade '53 G 50 G', and considering the functional parameters of the cover diaphragm complete. We have modified the design satisfying the end use, that comprise of basically two parts -<br>
1.     Homogeneous,   versatile   and   strong   plastic   body   moulded   using thermoplastics as mentioned above.<br><br>
2. A sheet metal part named support plate that is assembled along with the thermoplastic body of cover diaphragm complete on air suction valve body and can be tightened with desired torque upto 21 kg/m effectively without damaging the thermoplastic cover diaphragm.<br>
The two parts may be as per the enclosed sketches in the figures and the support plate can be strengthened with higher thickness sheets upto even 2mm that can be used even if the plastic cover tubular part is shifted into any angle as desired on the vehicle assembly.<br>
The thermoplastic homogeneous body of the cover diaphragm can be injection moulded using suitable single or multicavity mould on either vertical or horizontal automatic or semiautomatic or manual type injection moulding machines.<br>
The processing temperatures while injection moulding may vary as per the thermoplastic grade chosen for the purpose.<br>
As in case of present thermoplastic grade chosen here 'Zytel HTN 53G50' on a screw type automatic machine the plasticizing temperatures of various metering zones may be as below:-<br>
1.	Feed zone (Zone 1)	:	150°C ~ 175°C<br>
2.	Plasticizing Zone (Zone 2):	185°C ~ 190°C<br>
3.	Metering Zone (Zone 3)     :	195°C~230°C<br>
4.	Nozzle Temp. °C	:	235°C~260°C<br>
The injection pressure that can be in a range from 300 Bar to 1200 Bar depending upon a particular Grade of chosen thermoplastic, its moulding temperatures, mold design in such a way that this precision product does not generates excessive flash on the moulded part. The thermoplastic materials may be pre-dried in case they are of hygroscopic nature for effective removal of entrapped moisture.<br><br>
In present case Zytel 53 G 50 needs pre-drying in oven or hopper drier for 2-3 hours at 90°C-120°C temperatures.<br>
The mould is tightened on the mounting platon movement provided on the injection moulding machine in use and depending upon the required productivity per stroke the mould may consist of multiple cavities.<br>
The mould locking pressure(s) and injection speed are dependent on the injection pressure and plasticizing temperatures pertaining to desired grades as indicated and the mould may be water cooled or may have oil heating depending upon the 'plastic grade' chosen. The temperature of the oil used for mould heating can be controlled using 'MTC (mold temperature control).<br>
The thermoplastic cover manufacturing therefore starts with 'pre-drying of polymer granules' either in oven or hopper dryer from which the material enters the feeding zone of the screw and barrel of the injection moulding machine that is subsequently elasticized and metered; through either open nozzle with 'suckback' system or a nozzle with shut-off valve to avoid drooling of material.<br>
Through the nozzle plasticized material is injected with pressure into the pre-mounted locked mould ensuring that there is no underfilling of the cavity and is allowed to crystallize / polymarise (cool) for which the time may be 4-12 seconds. Subsequently the job is ejected out of the mould by opening the mould by reverse platon movement. The whole moulding cycle may be of 0.5-1.2 minutes. The ejected part (job) may be de-gated for removal of unwanted runners and spruces and deflashing by blade or any other such process.<br>
The tubular part of the 'cover diaphragm' moulding requires subsequent machining or drilling operation by which the 'cover' gets an opening required which may be of size 0.5 mm upto 0.9-1.00 mm as the design permits.    This is an additional<br><br>
operation as the punch of 0.5 mm though may be provided in the mould itself but that may prove to have a short life and may get broken in mouldig cycle.<br>
The homogeneous thermoplastic cover is now ready but as in same application(s) as the tightening of the cover diaphragm is on an aluminium casting with M-4 screws that is tightened with a torque upto 21 Kg m force to avoid leakage through other zones of 'air suction valve' a suitable 'support plate' as shown in the figure is assembled with the thermoplastic cover to withstand the assembly torque. The support plate is generally a sheetmetal press part using M.S. CRCA sheets of thickness ranging from 0.8 mm to 2.0 mm as per the need of the application; and is plated subsequently by either zinc plating or chrome plating with a surface coat of 8-15 microns to get effective rust prevention.<br>
In addition to above the 'new cover diaphragm complete' can also be manufactured using the modified L-Joint (tube part manufactured using steel tube) integrally molded with the thermoplastic cover using the plastic polymers as listed earlier (like Zytel nylons 53G50). In this process the modified L-Joint need to be insert molded while the cover is being molded.<br>
In this manufacturing method as per Fig.4(b), the L-Joint as described in the prior art, is slightly modified wherein in order to arrest the upward/downward movement, and probable leakage through the joining zone of the metallic L-Joint and thermoplastic cover the modified L-Joint is being used.<br>
The modification provision of a groove on the outer diameter of the L-Joint of size 0.2-0.4 mm and 1mm wide. These grooves can be one or more, say 2 or 3, the grooved L-Joint is made flat at bottom upto groove diameter either by grinding or milling the outer diameter so that it grips properly in the thermoplastic molded cover. The modified L-Joint after complete manufacture need to be plated for rust prevention being a steel part, and can then be used as insert while molding cover integrally with the modified L-Joint in subsequent plastic injection molding process as described earlier in this<br><br>
chapter. Being insert molding design, the mold however should be specifically designed to accommodate the insert, and then can be molded on the plastic injection molding machine.<br>
In each cycle, a new pre-manufactured insert (modified L-Joint) is to be placed inside the cavity suitably provided to fit the same before mold locking. Subsequently as the moulding cycle starts, the mold gets locked by the machine platen movement and the plasticized thermoplastic melt fills up the cavity portion of the cover part carved in the mold through the runner and gate system. After the polymer melt crystalise/polymarise the part is ejected out of the mold. The mold can be single or multicavity mold depending upon the desired productivity per machine stroke (shot).<br>
The ejected part is raw and may have the unwanted runner / sprues and flashes. These unwanted runner flashes can be easily deflashed using cutters and blades. Subsequent to the deflashing, the molded cover part integrally with modified L-Joint as insert is fitted with a suitably designed 'support plate' and new cover diaphragm complete is ready as per the present invention.<br>
The orientation of the modified L-Joint is taken care in the mold design stage itself and the cover diaphragm comes out with specific required angle as the design calls for.<br>
Thus, a new cover diaphragm complete' can be designed and manufactured using -<br>
1.	Modified L-joint integrally molded with thermoplastic cover assembled with a suitable support plate that takes care of high tightening torque of M4 screws.<br>
2.	Whole body can be of completely homogeneous thermoplastic cover assembled with a suitable support plate to take care of the tightening torque specification.<br><br>
