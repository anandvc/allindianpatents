				<td>The present invention relates to a piperidine compound.<br>
The present invention relates to heterocyclic derivatives having pharmaceutical activity, to processes for preparing such derivatives, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such derivatives and to the use of such derivatives as active therapeutic agents.<br>
PharmaceuticaHy active piperidine derivatives are disclosed in PCT/SEO1/01053, EP-Al-1013276, WO00/08013, W099/38514 and WO99/04794.<br>
Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines that are released by a wide variety of cells to attract macrophages, T cells, eosinophils, basophils and neutrophils to sites of inflammation and also play a role in the maturation of cells of the immune system. Chemokines play an important role in immune and inflammatory responses in various diseases and disorders, including asthma and allergic diseases, as well as autoimmune pathologies such as rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis. These small secreted molecules are a growing superfamily of 8-14 kDa proteins characterised by a conserved four cysteine motif. The chemokme superfamily can be divided into two main groups exhibiting characteristic structural motifs, the Cys-X-Cys (C-X-C, or a) and Cys-Cys (C-C, or )3) families. These are distinguished on the basis of a single ammo acid insertion between the NH-proximal pair of cysteine residues and sequence similarity<br>
The C-X-C chemokines include several potent chemoattractants and activators of neutrophils such as interleukin-8 (IL-8) and neurrophil-activating peptide 2 (NAP-2).<br>
The C-C chemokines include potent chemoattractants of monocytes and lymphocytes but not neutrophils such as human monocyte chemotactic proteins 1-3 (MCP-1, MCP-2 and MCP-3), RANTES (Regulaced on Activation, Normal T Expressed and Secreted), eotaxin and the macrophage inflammatory proteins lα and 1ß (MTP-lα and MTP-1ß).<br>
Studies have demonstrated that the actions of the chemokines are mediated by subfamilies of G protein-coupled receptors, among which are the receptors designated CCR1, CCR2, CCR2A, CCR2B, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CCR6, CCR7, CCR8, CCR9, CCR10, CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3 and CXCR4. These receptors represent good targets for drug development since agents which modulate these receptors would be useful in the treatment of disorders and diseases such as those mentioned above.<br>
The CCR5 receptor is expressed on T-lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, microglia and other cell types. These detect and respond to several<br>
chemokines, principally "regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted" (RANTES), macrophage inflammatory proteins (MIP) MEP-lα and MIP-1ß and monocyte chemoattractant protein-2 (MCP-2)<br>
This results in the recruitment of cells of the immune system to sites of disease   In many diseases it is the cells expressing CCR5 which contribute, directly or indirectly, to tissue damage   Consequently, inhibiting the recruitment of these cells is beneficial in a wide range of diseases<br>
CCR5 is also a co-receptor for HIV-1 and other viruses, allowing these viruses to enter cells. Blocking the receptor with a CCR5 antagonist or inducing receptor internalisation with a CCR5 agonist protects cells from viral infection<br>
The present invention provides a compound of formula (I)<br>

Dess martin penodmane (3 18 g) was added to a solution of 3,4-difluorovmyl alcohol (CAS number 149946-84-9) (1 18 g) in dicholoromethane (22 ml) at 0°C under argon and the reaction mixture allowed to stir for 1 hour   The mixture was put directly on to a column for purification via flash column chromatography elutmg with a gradient (ethyl acetate - 10%,<br>
 ethyl acetate and isohexane) yield 654 mg NMR (CDCl3) 6 0 (d, 1H), 6 50 (d, 1H), 7 10 (dd, 1H), 7 30 (m, 1H), 7 80 (m, 2H)<br>
EXAMPLE 15<br>
The ability of compounds to inhibit the binding of RANTES was assessed by an in vitro radioligand binding assay  Membranes were prepared from Chinese hamster ovary cells which expressed the recombinant human CCR5 receptor  These membranes were incubated with 0.1 nM iodinated RANTES, scintillation proximity beads and various conSScentrations of the compounds of the invention in 96-well plates. The amount of iodinated RANTES bound to the receptor was determined by scintillation counting   Competition curves were obtained for compounds and the concentration of compound which displaced 50% of bound iodinated RANTES was calculated (IC50)   Preferred compounds of formula (I) have an IC50 of less than 50jxM<br>
EXAMPLE 16<br>
The ability of compounds to inhibit the binding of MlP-lα was assessed by an in vitro radioligand binding assay   Membranes were prepared from Chinese hamster ovary cells which expressed the recombinant human CCR5 receptor   These membranes were incubated with 0.lnM iodinated MlP-lα, scintillation proximity beads and various concentrations of the compounds of the invention in 96-well plates   The amount of iodinated MTP-lα bound to the receptor was determined by scintillation counting   Competition curves were obtained for compounds and the concentration of compound which displaced 50% of bound iodinated MJP-lα was calculated (IC50). Preferred compounds of formula (I) have an IC50 of less than 50UM<br>
Results from this test for certain compounds of the invention are presented in Table II In Table II the results are presented as Pic50 values   A Pic50 value is the negative log (to base 10) of the IC50 result, so an IC50 of lµM (that is 1 x 10'6M) gives a Pic50 of 6. If a compound was tested more than once then the data below is an average of the probative tests results.<br>
