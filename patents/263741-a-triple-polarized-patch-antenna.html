				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an antenna arrangement comprising a first, a second and a<br>
third patch, each patch being made in a conducting material and having a first and a<br>
second main surface, which patches are placed one above the other with the first patch at<br>
the top, such that all of said main surfaces are essentially parallel to each other, in which<br>
antenna arrangement the first patch has a first edge, the second patch has a second edge<br>
and the third patch has a third edge, where furthermore the antenna arrangement comprises<br>
a feeding arrangement.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The demand for wireless communication systems has grown steadily, and is still growing,<br>
and a number of technological advancement steps have been taken during this growth. In<br>
order to acquire increased system capacity for wireless systems by employing uncorrelated<br>
propagation paths, MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) systems have been considered<br>
to constitute a preferred technology for improving the capacity. MIMO employs a number<br>
of separate independent signal paths, for example by means of several transmitting and<br>
receiving antennas. The desired result is to have a number of uncorrelated antenna ports<br>
for receiving as well as transmitting.<br>
For MIMO it is desired to estimate the channel and continuously update this estimation.<br>
This updating may be performed by means of continuously transmitting so-called pilot<br>
signals in a previously known manner. The estimation of the channel results in a channel<br>
matrix. If a number of transmitting antennas Tx transmit signals, constituting a transmitted<br>
signal vector, towards a number of receiving antennas Rx, all Tx signals are summated in<br>
each one of the Rx antennas, and by means of linear combination, a received signal vector<br>
is formed. By multiplying the received signal vector with the inverted channel matrix, the<br>
channel is compensated for and the original information is acquired, i.e. if the exact<br>
channel matrix is known, it is possible to acquire the exact transmitted signal vector. The<br>
channel matrix thus acts as a coupling between the antenna ports of the Tx and Rx<br>
antennas, respectively. These matrixes are of the size MxN, where M is the number of<br>
2<br><br>
inputs (antenna ports) of the Tx antenna and N is the number of outputs (antenna ports) of<br>
the Rx antenna. This is previously known for the skilled person in the MIMO system field.<br>
In order for a MIMO system to function efficiently, uncorrelated, or at least essentially<br>
uncorrelated, transmitted signals are required. The meaning of the term "uncorrelated<br>
signals" in this context is that the radiation patterns are essentially orthogonal. This is<br>
made possible for one antenna if that antenna is made for receiving and transmitting in at<br>
least two orthogonal polarizations. If more than two orthogonal polarizations are to be<br>
utilized for one antenna, it is necessary that it is used in a so-called rich scattering<br>
environment having a plurality of independent propagation paths, since it otherwise is not<br>
possible to have benefit from more than two orthogonal polarizations. A rich scattering<br>
environment is considered to occur when many electromagnetic waves co-incide at a<br>
single point in space. Therefore, in a rich scattering environment, more than two<br>
orthogonal polarizations can be utilized since the plurality of independent propagation<br>
paths enables all the degrees of freedom of the antenna to be utilized.<br>
Antennas for MIMO systems may utilize spatial separation, i.e. physical separation, in<br>
order to achieve low correlation between the received signals at the antenna ports. This,<br>
however, results in big arrays that are unsuitable for e.g. hand-held terminals. One other<br>
way to achieve uncorrelated signals is by means of polarization separation, i.e. generally<br>
sending and receiving signals with orthogonal polarizations.<br>
It has then been suggested to use three orthogonal dipoles for a MIMO antenna with three<br>
ports, but such an antenna is complicated to manufacture and requires a lot of space when<br>
used at higher frequencies, such as those used for the MIMO system (about 2 GHz). Up to<br>
six ports have been conceived, as disclosed in the published application US<br>
2002/0190908, but the crossed dipole and the accompanying loop element is still a<br>
complicated structure that is difficult to accomplish for higher frequencies to a reasonable<br>
cost.<br>
The objective problem that is solved by the present invention is to provide an antenna<br>
arrangement suitable for a MIMO system, which antenna arrangement is capable of<br>
sending and receiving in three essentially uncorrelated polarizations. The antenna<br>
3<br><br>
arrangement should further be made in a thin structure to a low cost, and still be suitable<br>
for higher frequencies, such as those used in the MIMO system.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
This objective problem is solved by means of an antenna arrangement according to the<br>
introduction, which antenna arrangement further is characterized in that the feeding<br>
arrangement comprises a first feeding point arranged in the first patch, positioned at a first<br>
imagined line passing the patches essentially perpendicular to the respective first and<br>
second main surfaces, where the feeding arrangement further comprises at least a second<br>
and a third feeding point arranged in the second patch, each of said second and a third<br>
feeding points being positioned at a respective distance from the first imagined line, where<br>
a second and third imagined line passes perpendicular to, and intersects, the first line and<br>
where the second imagined line also intersects the second feeding point and the third<br>
imagined line also intersects the third feeding point, the second and third imagined line<br>
presenting an angle a between each other, the angle a being essentially 90°, where the first<br>
feeding point is arranged for feeding the first patch transmission as well as in reception<br>
and the second and third feeding points are arranged for feeding the first and second<br>
patches, respectively, in transmission as well as in reception, and where, in a first mode of<br>
operation, the first feeding point enables a first constant E-field being obtained in a first<br>
slot created between the first and second edges, which first E-field further is directed<br>
between said edges, and, in a second mode of operation, the second feeding point<br>
contributes to obtaining a second E-field in a second slot created between the second and<br>
third edges, which second E-field further is directed between the second and third edges<br>
and has a sinusoidal variation along the second slot, and, in a third mode of operation, the<br>
third feeding point contributes to obtaining a third E-field in the second slot, which second<br>
E-field further is directed between the second and third edges and has a sinusoidal<br>
variation along the second slot.<br>
Preferred embodiments are disclosed in the dependent claims.<br>

PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
According to the present invention, a so-called triple-mode antenna arrangement is<br>
provided. The triple-mode antenna arrangement is designed for transmitting three<br>
essentially orthogonal radiation patterns.<br>
As shown in Figure la-c, illustrating a first embodiment of the present invention, a triple-<br>
mode antenna arrangement 1 comprises a first 2, second 3 and third 4 patch. Each patch 2,<br>
3, 4 is relatively thin, having a first 5, 6, 7 and a second 8, 9, 10 main surface, which first<br>
5, 6, 7 and second 8, 9, 10 main surfaces are essentially parallel to each other, and the<br>
patches 2, 3, 4 are made in a conducting material, such as copper. The patches 2, 3, 4 are<br>
preferably round in shape and placed one above the other with the first patch 2 at the top.<br>
The patches 2, 3, 4 also have a corresponding first, second and third edge 11, 12, 13.<br>
The triple-mode mode antenna arrangement 1 also comprises a centrally located first<br>
coaxial feed line 14, having a first centre conductor 15 that makes electrical contact with<br>
the first patch 2 in its central area, constituting a first feeding point 16. The first centre<br>
conductor 15 makes no electrical contact with any of the other patches 3, 4. The first<br>
coaxial feed line 14 further passes through the central area of the second 3 and third 4<br>
patch by means of holes 17a, b made into these, through which the first coaxial feed 14<br>
line may run.<br>
The triple-mode mode antenna arrangement 1 further comprises a second 18, and third 19<br>
coaxial feed line, having a second 20 and third 21 centre conductor, respectively, which<br>
second 20 and third 21 centre conductor each makes electrical contact with the second<br>
patch 3 in its outer area, thereby constituting a second 22 and third 23 feeding point. Also,<br>
with reference to Figure lc, the second 22 and third 23 feeding points are positioned at an<br>
appropriate distance d from a first imagined line 24 passing through the first feeding point<br>
16 essentially perpendicular to the main planes 5, 6, 7; 8, 9, 10. The distance d is<br>
preferably essentially the same for the second 20 and third 21 centre conductors (only<br>
shown for the third feeding point in Figure la).<br>
6<br><br>
A second 25 and third 26 imagined line passes perpendicular to the first imagined line 24<br>
and each intersect the second 22 and third 23 feeding points, presenting an angle a<br>
between each other. The angle a is essentially 90°. The lines 24, 25, 26 are inserted for<br>
explanatory reasons only, and are not part of the real device 1.<br>
The feeding coaxial lines 14, 18, 19 with their centre conductors 15, 20, 21 constitute a<br>
feeding arrangement.<br>
The second 20 and third 21 centre conductors make no electrical contact with any of the<br>
other patches 2, 4, and mainly extend perpendicular to the main surfaces 5, 6, 7; 8, 9, 10 of<br>
the patches 2, 3, 4. These coaxial feed lines 20, 21 further passes through the outer area of<br>
the third patch 4 by means of holes 27, 28 made into this, through which these coaxial feed<br>
20, 21 lines may run.<br>
The electrical contact between the first 2 and second 3 patch and their belonging centre<br>
conductors 15; 20, 21 at the corresponding feeding points 16; 22, 23 is for example<br>
obtained by means of soldering.<br>
By means of the first 14, second 18 and third 19 coaxial feed lines, the patches 2, 3, 4 are<br>
excited in three different ways, in a first, second and third mode of operation, enabling<br>
three orthogonal radiation patterns to be transmitted.<br>
At the first mode of operation, the first patch 2 is fed by a signal from the first coaxial feed<br>
line 14. The second patch 3 then acts as a ground plane for the first patch 2. In this a way a<br>
degenerated hat-monopole is obtained.<br>
Also with reference to Figure 2a, which for reasons of clarity shows the patches without<br>
the feeding arrangement, this results in a constant magnetic current loop 29 running in a<br>
circumferential slot 30 created between the edges 11,12 of the first and second 3 patch,<br>
respectively. This magnetic current 29 corresponds to a first E-field 31, all around the<br>
circumference of the first 2 and second 3 patch, which first E-field 31 is constant and<br>
directed essentially perpendicular to the main surfaces 5, 6; 8, 9 of the first 2 and second 3<br>
patch in the slot 30. In Figure 2a, this is shown with a number of arrows.<br>
7<br><br>
With reference to Figure la-c, at the second mode of operation, one signal is fed to the<br>
second patch 3 via the second feeding point 20, from the second coaxial feed line 18. The<br>
third patch 4 then acts as a ground plane for the second patch 3.<br>
With reference also to Figure 2b, which for reasons of clarity shows the patches without<br>
the feeding arrangement, this in turn results in a second E-field 32 directed essentially<br>
perpendicular to the main surfaces 6, 7; 9, 10 of the second 3 and third 4 patches in a<br>
circumferential slot 33 created between the edges 12, 13 of the second 3 and third 4 patch,<br>
respectively, having a sinusoidal variation all around the circumference of the second 3<br>
and third 4 patch. The E-field 32 is shown in Figure 2b as a number of arrows having a<br>
length that corresponds to the strength of the E-field, where the arrows indicate an<br>
instantaneous E-field distribution as it varies harmonically over time.<br>
With reference to Figure la-c, the third mode of operation corresponds to the second mode<br>
of operation, but here one signal is fed to the second patch 3 via the third coaxial feed line<br>
19, the signal in question being in phase with the signal that is fed to the second feeding<br>
point 22. However, as mentioned above, the corresponding third feeding point 23 is<br>
displaced 90° with respect to the second feeding point 22 with reference from the first<br>
feeding point 16. The third patch 4 also here acts as a ground plane for the second patch 3.<br>
Also with reference to Figure 2c, which for reasons of clarity shows the patches without<br>
the feeding arrangement, this in turn results in a third E-field 34 directed essentially<br>
perpendicular to the main surfaces 6, 7; 9, 10 of the second 3 and third 4 patches in the<br>
circumferential slot 33 created between the edges 12, 13 of the second 3 and third 4 patch,<br>
respectively, having a sinusoidal variation all around the circumference of the second 3<br>
and third 4 patch. Using the same reference direction for the fields, if the second E-field<br>
32 varies with sine, the third E-field 34 varies with cosine. This means that the third E-<br>
field 34 further is perpendicular to the second E-field 32, this will be explained more in<br>
detail later.<br>
In the same way as for the second mode of operation, the third E-field is shown in Figure<br>
2c as a number of arrows having a length that corresponds to the strength of the E-field,<br>
where the arrows indicate an instantaneous E-field distribution as it varies harmonically<br>
over time.<br>
8<br><br>
Thus, the triple-mode antenna arrangement 1 is now excited in three different ways, thus<br>
acquiring three different modes with a first 31, second 32 and third 34 E-field, constituting<br>
aperture fields which all ideally are orthogonal to each other.<br>
The corresponding radiation patterns are also orthogonal, and the correlation equals zero,<br>
where the correlation p may be written as<br><br>
In the equation above, Ω. represents a surface and the symbol * means that it is a complex<br>
conjugate. For the integration of the radiation pattern, Ω represents a closed surface<br>
comprising all space angels, and when this integration equals zero, there is no correlation<br>
between the radiation patterns, i.e. the radiation patterns are orthogonal to each other. The<br>
denominator is an effect normalization term.<br>
When determining that the radiation patterns are orthogonal, it is possible to use the<br>
aperture fields. When considering the aperture fields, Ω. represents an aperture surface.<br>
The aperture fields between the edges 11, 12, 13 are orthogonal since the integration of a<br>
constant (the first mode) times a sinusoidal variation (second or third mode) over one<br>
period equals zero. Further, the integration of two orthogonal sinusoidal variations,<br>
sine*cosine, (the second and third mode) over one period also equals zero. As these fields<br>
31, 32, 34 are orthogonal at the aperture of the antenna arrangement 1 and correspond to<br>
aperture currents (not shown) of the antenna 1, which aperture currents then also are<br>
orthogonal, the far-field also comprises orthogonal field vectors, as known to those skilled<br>
in the art.<br>
Having three, at least essentially, orthogonal radiation patterns is desirable, since this<br>
enables the rows in the channel matrix to be independent. This in turn means that the<br>
present invention is applicable for the MIMO system.<br>
By means of superposition, all modes of operation may be operating at the same time, thus<br>
allowing the triple-mode antenna arrangement to transmit three essentially orthogonal<br>
radiation patterns.<br>
9<br><br>
The actual implementation of the feeding arrangement is not important, but may vary in<br>
ways which are obvious for the skilled person. The important feature of the present<br>
invention is that the patches 2, 3, 4 are fed in three modes of operation, where the first<br>
mode of operation results in an E-field 31 being acquired at the circumferential slot 30<br>
between the first 2 and second 3 patch. The other modes of operation result in two E-fields<br>
32, 34 which have sine variations of the field strength being acquired at the<br>
circumferential slot 33 between the second 3 and third 4 patch, where one of these E-fields<br>
is rotated 90° with respect to the other. This function is not limited by the design of the<br>
feeding arrangement or how the feeding points 16, 22, 23 are conceived. They may for<br>
example obtain electrical connection in a contactless manner, i.e. by means of capacitive<br>
coupling as known in the art.<br>
In an alternative second embodiment with reference to Figure 3a-b, the patch arrangement<br>
of a triple-mode mode antenna arrangement 1' is the same as for the first embodiment,<br>
having the same reference numerals in the drawings. The difference between the<br>
embodiments is found in the feeding arrangement, where the triple-mode mode antenna<br>
arrangement 1 comprises a first 14, second 18a, third 19a, fourth 18b and fifth 19b<br>
coaxial feed line, having a first 15, second 20a, third 21a, fourth 20b and fifth 21b centre<br>
conductor, respectively.<br>
The positioning of the first coaxial feed line 14 having a first centre conductor 15 and a<br>
first feeding point 16 corresponds with the one described above in connection with the<br>
first embodiment, and will not be further discussed here.<br>
The second 20a, third 21a, fourth 20b and fifth 21b centre conductor each makes electrical<br>
contact with the second patch 3 in its outer area, having a second 20a, third 21a, fourth<br>
20b and fifth 21b centre conductor, respectively, that each makes electrical contact with<br>
the second patch 3 in its outer area, there constituting a second 22a, third 23a, fourth 22b<br>
and fifth 23b feeding point. Also with reference to Figure 3c, the second 22a third 23a,<br>
fourth 22b and fifth 23b feeding points are positioned at an appropriate distance d from a<br>
first imagined line 24 passing through the first feeding point 16 essentially perpendicular<br>
to the main planes 5, 6, 7; 8, 9, 10. The distance d essentially is the same for the second<br>
20a, third 21a, fourth 20b and fifth 21b centre conductors.<br>
10<br><br>
A second 25 and third 26 imagined line passes perpendicular to the first imagined line 24.<br>
The second imagined line 25 intersects the second 22a and fourth 22b feeding point<br>
having the first imagined line 24 positioned between them. The third 26 imagined line<br>
intersects the third 23a and fifth 23b feeding points, having the first imagined line (24)<br>
positioned between them. Furthermore, the second 25 and third 26 imagined lines present<br>
an angle a between each other. This is a way to define the angle between feeding points,<br>
the angle a is essentially 90°. The defining of an angle between feeding points in the<br>
above manner is referred to as an angular displacement further in the text. The lines 24,<br>
25, 26 are inserted for explanatory reasons only, and are not part of the real device 1'.<br>
There is thus an angular displacement of essentially 90° between the second 22a third 23a,<br>
fourth 22b and fifth 23b feeding points all the way around the circumference of a circle<br>
with the radius d. The second 22a third 23a, fourth 22b and fifth 23b feeding points are<br>
then positioned in such a way that the second 22a and fourth 22b feeding points are<br>
opposite each other and the third 23a and fifth 23b feeding points are opposite each other,<br>
the clockwise order of the succeeding feeding points of the second patch 3 being the<br>
second 22a, the third 23a, the fourth 22b, and the fifth 23b.<br>
The feeding coaxial lines 14, 18a, 19a, 18b, 19b with their centre conductors 15, 20a, 21a,<br>
20b, 21b constitute a feeding arrangement.<br>
The second 22a and fourth 22b feeding point constitute a first feeding point pair and the<br>
fourth 23a and fifth 23b feeding point constitute a second feeding point pair. The feeding<br>
points in a feeding point pair are positioned at opposite sides of the first imagined line 24,<br>
separating each feeding point in a pair with an angular displacement of essentially 2*a =<br>
180°. Furthermore, each pair of corresponding feeding points has an angular displacement<br>
of 180°. This results in that all the feeding points are evenly distributed around the patch,<br>
each one separated with an angular displacement of essentially 90°.<br>
The second 20a, third 21a, fourth 20b and fifth 21b centre conductors makes no electrical<br>
contact with any of the other patches 2, 4, and mainly extend perpendicular to the main<br>
surfaces 5, 6, 7; 8, 9, 10 of the patches 2, 3, 4. These second 18a, third 19a, fourth 18b and<br>
11<br><br>
fifth 19b coaxial feed lines passes through the outer area of the third patch 4 by means of<br>
holes 27a, 28a, 27b, 28b made into this, through which these coaxial feed lines 18a, 19a,<br>
18b, 19b may run.<br>
The electrical contact between the first 2 and second 3 patches and the belonging centre<br>
conductors 15; 20a, 21a, 20b, 21b at the corresponding feeding points 16; 22a, 23a, 22b,<br>
23b is for example obtained by means of soldering.<br>
The second 18a and fourth 18b coaxial feed lines are fed 180° out of phase with each<br>
other, such that the second 22a and fourth 22b opposite feeding points are fed with a phase<br>
difference of 180°. Further, the third 19a and fifth 19b coaxial feed lines are also fed 180°<br>
out of phase with each other, such that the third 23a and fifth 23b opposite feeding points<br>
are fed with a phase difference of 180°. This phase shift may be introduced by means of<br>
conventional phase shifters (not shown), commonly used in the art, or in any other<br>
convenient way.<br>
The triple-mode mode antenna arrangement 1' according to the second embodiment has<br>
three modes of operation which corresponds to those described in connection with the first<br>
embodiment with reference to Figure 2a-c, and the same radiation properties are obtained<br>
here. The difference between the first and second embodiment is that the second<br>
embodiment comprises four feeding points at the second patch 3 instead of two. These<br>
four feed points constitutes a more balanced feeding, which is more easily impedance<br>
matched, but at the same time comprises a more complicated structure.<br>
Due to reciprocity, for the transmitting properties of all the triple-mode antenna<br>
arrangements 1, 1' described, there are corresponding equal receiving properties, as<br>
known to those skilled in the art, allowing the triple-mode antenna arrangement to both<br>
send and receive in three essentially uncorrelated modes of operation.<br>
The invention is not limited to the embodiments described above, which only should be<br>
regarded as examples of the present invention, but may vary freely within the scope of the<br>
appended claims.<br>
Other types of patches may be conceivable, instead of those described. For example, the<br>
patches may have other shapes, for example square, rectangular or octagonal as well as<br>
12<br><br>
cross- or star-shaped. The three patches may also have different shapes between<br>
themselves, i.e. the first patch may be octagonal, the second patch square etc.<br>
The patches may be made in any appropriate conducting material, for example copper,<br>
aluminium, silver or gold. The patches may further be made from thin metal sheets and<br>
separated by air only, held in place by means of appropriate retainers (not shown).<br>
Alternatively, the patches may be etched from copper-clad laminates.<br>
Any kind of feeding of the patches is within the scope of the invention, where different<br>
kinds of probe feed are the most preferred. The capacitive probe feed mentioned above is<br>
such an alternative.<br>
The distance d between the first imagined line and the respective feeding points does not<br>
have to be the same for every feeding point, but may vary if appropriate. The positioning<br>
of the feeding points is determined by which impedance that is desired. In other words, the<br>
distance d is generally varied in order to obtain a desired impedance matching.<br>
The first imagined line does not have to pass through a central area of the patches, but may<br>
pass the patches wherever appropriate.<br>
The feed network may further be implemented in many different ways, which ways are<br>
obvious for the person skilled in the art. The patches may be fed in such a way that other<br>
mutually orthogonal polarizations may be obtained, for example right-hand circular<br>
polarization and/or left-hand circular polarization.<br>
