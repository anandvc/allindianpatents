FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel cannabinoid receptor modulators, in particular cannabinoid 1 (CB1) or cannabinoid 2 (CB2) receptor modulators, and uses thereof for treating diseases, conditions and/or disorders modulated by a cannabinoid receptor (such as pain, neurodegenative disorders, eating disorders, weight loss or control, and obesity).<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The endogenous cannabinoid system comprises two main receptors, CB1 and CB2, and a number of ligands including anandamide and virodhamine which demonstrate the greatest activity at the cannabinoid receptor (Jonathan A W &amp; Louis J A, Obes Man., 5-19, 20f05). Anandamide, which is produced postsynaptically, is the main fatty acid involved in the system. It gains access to the extra cellular space and activates CB1 cannabinoid receptors located on presynaptic nerve terminals. This activation causes presynaptic inhibition of y-aminobutyric acid or glutamate through inhibition of calcium channels, while simultaneously interfering with vesicle release and activating potassium channels.<br>
However, anandamide is prone to rapid enzymatic hydrolysis. This represents a serious drawback in its use as a drug because, inter alia, substances which are susceptible to hydrolytic cleavage may undergo changes in the gastrointestinal tract.<br>
CB1 receptors are predominantly located in the brain and other neurons, while CB2 receptors are predominantly located in immune cells. Stimulation of these receptors is known to affect the central and peripheral action on lipid and glucose metabolism in adipose tissue and most notably, helps to regulate food intake, energy balance and nicotine dependence as well as regulate fear and anxiety.<br>
-2-<br><br>
There is evidence suggesting that CB1 agonists or antagonists, respectively, increase or decrease the motivation to work for palatable ingesta (Gallate J E and McGregor I S, Psychopharmacology, 142, 302-308, 1999 and Gallate J E, Saharov T, Mallet P E and McGregor I S, 1999, Eur. J. Pharmacol, 370, 233-240, 1999). Cannabinoids appear to directly stimulate eating by actions on appetitive processes, making food stimuli more salient and rapidly inducing eating even in satiated animals (Williams C M and Kirkham TC, Physiol. Behav., 76, 241-250, 2002).<br>
Current data reveals that cannabinoids mediate suppression of inflammation in vitro and in vivo through stimulation of CB2 receptors (Ehrhart J, et.al. J. Neuroinflammation, 2, 29, 2005). The inflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide, cytokines, and chemokines play an important role in microglial cell-associated neuron cell damage. Activated microglial cells have been implicated in a number of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, HIV and dementia.<br>
Compounds capable of modulating the cannabinoid (CB) receptor activity can be used in the treatment of CB receptor mediated syndromes, diseases or disorders which include appetite, metabolism, diabetes, obesity, glaucoma associated intra-ocular pressure, mood disorders, seizures, substance abuse, learning disorders, cognition disorders, memory disorders, organ contraction, muscle spasm, respiratory disorders, locomotor activity disorders, movement disorders, immune disorders, inflammation, cell growth disorders, eye-diseases, allergies and allergic reactions, pain, anxiety, psychotic afflictions, pathological states of brain, gastrointestinal disorders, nausea, vomiting, giddiness, urinary and fertility problems, cardiovascular diseases, neuroinfiammatory pathologies, diseases of the central nervous system, neurodegenerative syndromes, diseases and disorders, sleep disorders, dermatological disorders, leukocyte activation-associated disorder, autoimmune diseases, nephrological pathologies, delayed or immediate hypersensitivity, infectious parasitic, and viral and bacterial diseases.<br>
At present, various CB modulators have been characterized as agonists, inverse<br>
agonists or antagonists to CB1  and/or CB2 receptors.    These modulators include<br>
naphthalen-lyl-(4-pentyloxy-naphthalen-l-yl) methanone (believed to be SAB-378), 4-<br>
(2,4-dichlorophenylamino)-N-(terahydro-pyran-4ylmethyl)-2-trifluromethyl-benzamide<br>
(GW-842166X),	N-( 1 -piperidinyl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1 -(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-<br>
methylpyrazole-3 -carbox-amide	(SRI 41716 A),	3 -(4-chlorophenyl-N'-(4-<br>
chlorophenyl)sulfonyl-N-methyl-4-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-lH-pyrazole-l-carboxamide<br>
-3-<br><br><br>
SAB-378 (CB1 Agonist)	GW-842166X (CB2 Agonist)<br>
(SLV-319), and (R)-(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-[4-morpholinylmethyl]-pyrrolo-[l,2,3-de]-l,4-benzoxazin-6-yl](l-naphthyl) methanone (WIN 55212-2).<br><br>
SR-141716A	SLV-319	(WIN 55212-2)<br>
(CB1 inverse agonist)      (CB1 Antagonist)<br>
These modulators have reached advanced stages of clinical trials for the treatment of pain, neurodegenerative disorders, psychotic disorders, neurological syndromes, diseases or disorders, eating disorders, Alzheimer's disease, alcohol dependency, diabetes, obesity and/or smoking cessation.<br>

There exists an unmet need for treatment of alcohol abuse. Health risks associated with alcoholism include impaired motor control and decision making, cancer, liver disease, birth defects, heart disease, drug/drug interactions, pancreatitis and interpersonal problems. Studies have suggested that endogenous cannabinoid tone plays a critical role in the control of ethanol intake. The endogenous CB1 receptor antagonist SR-141716A has been shown to block voluntary ethanol intake in rats and mice. (See, Arnone, M, et al., "Selective Inhibition of Sucrose and Ethanol Intake by SR141716, an Antagonist of Central Cannabinoid (CB1) Receptors," Psychopharmacol, 132,104-106 (1997)). For a review, see, Hungund, B. L and B. S. Basavarajappa, "Are Anadamide and Cannabinoid Receptors involved in Ethanol Tolerance? A Review of the Evidence," Alcohol &amp; Alcoholism, 35(2) 126-133, 2000.<br>
Current treatments for alcohol abuse or dependence generally suffer from noncompliance or potential hepatotoxicity. There is an unmet need for more effective treatments of alcohol abuse/dependence.<br>
There also still exists a need for safer and more effective therapeutic treatments for diseases, conditions and/or disorders modulated by cannabinoid receptors(such as pain,obesity), including those modulated by CB1 or CB2 receptors.<br>

It is to be understood that the present invention encompasses all isomers of compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives, including all geometric, tautomeric 1 0 and optical forms, and mixtures thereof (e.g. racemic mixtures). Where additional chiral centres are present in compounds of formula (I), the present invention includes within its scope all possible diastereoismers, including mixtures thereof. The different isomeric forms may be separated or resolved one from the other by conventional methods, or any given isomer may be obtained by conventional synthetic methods or by stereospecific or asymmetric syntheses.The subject invention also includes isotopically-labeled compounds,   which are identical to those recited in<br>
-71 -<br><br>
formulas I and following, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nikogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine, iodine, 20 and chlorine such as 3H, nC, 14C, 18F, 123I and 125I.<br>
Compounds of the present invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds that contain the aforementioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of the present invention. Isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3H, 14C are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated,<br>
■a<br>
i.e.,   H, and carbon-14, i.e., 14C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of<br>
11	R<br>
preparation and detectabihty. C and F isotopes are particularly useful in PET (positron emission tomography), and 125I isotopes are particularly useful in SPECT (single photon emission computerized tomography), all useful in brain imaging. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e, 2H, can afford 30 certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labeled compounds of formula I and following of this invention can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Schemes andlor in the Examples below, by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may be prepared in crystalline or non-crystalline form, and, if crystalline, may optionally be hydrated or solvated. This invention includes within its scope stoichiometric hydrates or solvates as well as compounds containing variable amounts of water and/or solvent.<br>

This protocol was performed with the compound of Example 294 at 0.01, 0.1, 0.3, and 1 mg/kg (LP.), and gabapentin at 100 mg/kg (LP.) to evaluate the ability of the compound of Example 294 in reducing neuropathic hyperalgesia. The Seltzer method is also generally described in Seltzer et al., Pain 1990, 43:205-18.<br>
1.	Rats were anesthetised using ketamine / xylazine (40 / 5 mg/kg/ml, i.p.). After induction of anaesthesia, the left thigh was shaved and cleaned.<br>
2.	The left sciatic nerve was exposed at mid thigh level through a small incision.<br>
3.	The nerve was cleared from adhering muscle tissue.<br>
4.	One half of the nerve thickness was tightly ligated just after the bifurcation of common sciatic nerve using 7.0 silk sutures.<br>
5.	The wound was closed with muscle and skin sutures and povidone was applied.<br>
6.	The animals were allowed to recover for 12 to 15 days postligation.<br>
7.	Mechanical hyperalgesia was examined in the model of rat neuropathic pain, using the paw pressure technique (Ugo Basile Analgesymeter, Cat. No. 37215, Comerio, Italy).<br>
8.	Paw withdrawal thresholds were recorded for both the ipsilateral and the contralateral hind paws before (predose) and 0.5 and 1 hour after drug or vehicle administration (postdose).<br>
9.	The cut-off was set at 150g pressure and the endpoint was taken as paw withdrawal or vocalization.<br>
Data Analysis:<br>
The threshold withdrawal latency (naive, predose &amp; postdose) values are represented as mean ± SEM. See Walker KM, Urban LA, Medhurst SJ, Patel S, Panesar M, Fox AJ and Mcintyre P., "The VRl antagonist capsazepine reverses mechanical hyperalgesia in models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain", J. Pharmacol. Expt. Ther. 304: 56-62, 2003. The percent reversal of neuropathic mechanical hyperalgesia was calculated from withdrawal threshold latency values according to the following formula:<br>
% Reversal     =    Ipsilateral postdose - Ipsilateral predose  X 100% Contralateral predose - Ipsilateral predose<br>
Data statistical analyses were performed on the percent reversal values by one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Tukey's test using GraphPad Prism software.<br>

This method is also generally described in Miletic G and Miletic V, "Long-term changes in sciatic-evoked A-fiber dorsal horn field potentials accompany loose ligation of the sciatic nerve in rats," Pain 84:353-359, 2000.<br>
1.	Rats were anesthetised using ketamine/xylazine (40/5 mg/kg, i.p.). After induction of anaesthesia, the left thigh was shaved and cleaned.<br>
2.	The left sciatic nerve was exposed at mid thigh level through small incision.<br>
3.	The nerve was cleared from adhering muscle tissue.<br>
4.	Four loose ligatures of Ethicon 4-0 chromic gut (Johnson &amp; Johnson) at 1 mm space were placed around the nerve after the bifurcation of common sciatic nerve.<br>
5.	The wound was closed with muscle and skin sutures &amp; povidone was applied.<br>
6.	The animals were used for experiment after 7 days of ligation.<br>
7.	Mechanical hyperalgesia was examined in the model of rat neuropathic pain, using the paw pressure technique (Ugo Basile Analgesymeter, Cat. No. 37215, Comerio, Italy).<br>
8.	Paw withdrawal thresholds were recorded for both the ipsilateral and the contralateral hind paws before (predose) and 0.5 and 1 hour after drug or vehicle administration (postdose).<br>

Ther., 310: 905-914, 2004. The mice were given intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of vehicle, standard or test drug. Analgesia was assessed by measuring tail flick latency (reaction) at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 hours post dosing. The cut-off latency was set at 10 Seconds and the endpoint was taken as tail flick response of the tail.<br>
Data Analysis<br>
The tail flick latency (basal &amp; reaction) values were represented as mean ± SEM. Maximum analgesia (% MPE) was calculated according to the following formula:<br>
% Maximum Possible analgesic effect  =    (Reaction latency - Basal latency) x   100<br>
(Cut-off latency- Basal latency)<br>
Data analyses were performed on the percent MPE values by one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Tukey's test. The results are shown in Figure 3.<br>

Three wells for total binding, three wells for basal binding, and three wells for nonspecific binding at 0.2 nM concentration of radioligand were used. Basal binding was defined by 50 uM GDP (Guanosine diphosphate) and non-specific binding was defined by 10 uM unlabeled GTPyS. 10 ug rat cerebellum membrane, 50 uM of GDP, WIN-55212-2 or test compound (1 uM or 300 nM ), 10 uM unlabeled GTPyS, and 0.2 nM of [35S]GTPyS were added into a 96 well plate and the final volume of the reaction mixture was made with GTPyS buffer (50 mM Tris, 3 raM anhydrous MgCl2, 0.2mM EGTA and 100 mM NaCl pH 7.4) to 200ul. The plates were incubated at 30°C for 1 hour. Then the reaction was stopped by filtration using a Whatman GF/B-96 microfilter plate. Three washings were given using Tris-HCl. The radioactivity bound to the brain membrane was retained on the filter disks to which scintillation fluid was added (Microscint PS). Then plates were read for radioactive counts using a Beta Liquid Scintillation Counter (Packard Instruments, IL, USA).<br>

The rat cerebellar brain membrane was prepared as follow:<br>
1.	Sacrifice the rat and take out the whole brain and seperate cerebellum as fast as possible and keep it on ice.<br>
2.	Take the weight of the cerebellum and homogenize in 30 ml of homogenizing buffer<br>
(50mM Tris-HCL containing 1 mM EDTA and 5% sucrose , pH 7.5 ) using homogenizer in cold condition.<br>
3.	Centrifuge the homogenized cerebellum at 18000 rpm (38000 g) for 15 min at 4°C.<br>
4.	Resuspend the pellet in 5 ml 50 mM Tris-HCL containing 1 mM EDTA and keep it on ice for 30 min.<br>
5.	Pass the membrane through insulin syringe to ensure uniform suspension.<br>
6.	Centrifuge the membrane at 18000 rpm at 4°C for 20 min.<br>
7.	Reconstitute the pellet in 3 ml of GTPyS buffer and estimate the protein by BCA assay and store the membrane in aliquots of lOOOug of protein.<br>
CB1 agonist and antagonist activity screening assay<br>
The test compounds were screened at a final concentration of 1 uM or 300 nM in the absence and presence of 1 \xM of WIN 55,212-2 in the same manner as described in the GTPyS binding assay.<br>
An agonist will stimulate the GTPyS binding over the basal.<br>
An antagonist will inhibit the WIN-55212-2 (CB1 agonist) and induce stimulation of GTPyS binding without significantly altering the basal binding.<br>
An inverse agonist will decrease the basal GTPyS binding and/or produce more than 100% inhibition of the agonist (WIN-55212-2) induced stimulation.<br>
A partial agonist normally produces only partial stimulation over basal and also partially inhibits agonist (WIN-55212-2) induced stimulation of GTPyS binding. Data Analysis:<br>
The percent stimulation of GTPyS binding by each test compound at 1 uM or 300 nM concentration in the absence and presence of luM WIN 55,212-2 was calculated by comparing it with basal specific bound (Basal binding - Non Specific binding) values.<br>
The results are shown in Table III below.<br>

IX. Assay for Determining Agonist and Antagonist Activity to CB1  and CB2 Receptors<br>
1.	Antagonism of CB1/ CB2 receptors expressed in CHO cells.<br>
h-CBl/CHO or h-CB2/CHO cells were grown in HAM's F12 DMEM medium (Sigma) with 10% FBS (Hyclone), 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution and 400 ug/ml of G418 (Sigma). 5000 cells were seeded per well in a 96 well plate and incubated for 24 hours at 37° C in 5% CO2. On the day of assay, cells were washed with warm Krebs buffer containing 0.1% fatty acid free (FAF) BSA (Sigma) and re-suspended in the same buffer containing ImM IBMX. Test antagonist or reference compound (AM 251 (l-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-4-methyl-N-(l-piperidyl)pyrazole-3-carboxamide) for CB1 and SR 144528 for CB2) diluted in FAFBSA + IBMX + Krebs buffer was added to the cells and incubated for 10 miutes at room temperature. CP 55,940 (30 nM final concentration for CB1 testing and 10 nM of the same for CB2 testing) was added to cells followed by forskolin (10 uM final concentration) and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. At the end of incubation, cells were lysed using lysis reagent from the cAMP estimation kit and cAMP was quantitated by the chemiluminescence method described in the manufacturer's instructions (DiscoveRZ). EC50 values were calculated from dose response curves by nonlinear regression analysis using PRISM software.<br>
