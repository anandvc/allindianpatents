DESCRIPTION<br>
VALEROLACTONE COMPOUNDS AND PERFUME COMPOSITION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a valerolactone compound and a process for preparing the same, and a perfume composition containing the valerolactone compound.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Sandalwood (Japanese name: Byakudan) which has been mainly produced in the eastern district of India has a noble characteristic odor. Therefore, sandalwood has been highly prized as a material for Buddhist statues and various craft carving materials in the Orient. An essential oil obtained from the core and root of the sandalwood by water steam distillation has been used as a perfume from old times. The characteristics of this sandalwood oil reside in that the sandalwood oil shows a soft and sweet woody odor and a balsamic odor, and has high sustainability odor. Therefore, the sandalwood oil has been widely used in oriental-type fragrance, perfume, cosmetics, soap, incense stick and the like (for example, see "Fundamental Knowledge of Perfumes and Flavor Preparation" authored and edited by Mototaka Nakajima, Sangyo-tosyo Kabushiki Kaisya, initial edition third printing (2000), p.322-323).<br>
However, with increased consciousness on environmental protection, and reinforcement of forest protection as flood control measures in recent years, there is a tendency that excessive felling of natural timber is suppressed. The amount<br><br>
of felling of sandalwood is restricted by the govemments in the countries producing it, and deficient supply and cost increase of sandalwood oil has become a problem in the fragrance industry.<br>
For this reason, as a substitute for sandalwood oil, sandalwood-type aroma chemicals such as 2-methyl-4-(2,2,3-trimethyl-3-cyclopenten-l-yl)-2-buten-1-ol, 2-ethyl-4-(2,2,3-trimethyl-3-cyclopenten-l-yl&gt;2-buten-l-ol, 3-methyl-5-(2,2,3-trimethyl-3-cyclopenten-l-yl)-pentan-2-ol, and isocamphylcyclohexanol have been used. However, these sandalwood-type aroma chemicals are deficient in the soft and characteristic sweet odor of natural sandalwood. Therefore, it is difficult to sufficiently reproduce the odor of natural sandalwood.<br>
Generally, as a perfume supplementary to the sweet flavor of a perfume composition, there have been proposed esters, lactones, faranons, vanillins, and the like. Among them, lactones, for example,γ-pentyl-γ-butyrolactone (another nameγ-nonalactone) and 5-pentyl-5-valerolactone (another name 5-decalactone) have coconut-like and milk-like sweetness. Therefore, the lactones exhibit effects of producing food-like sweetness. It is said thatγ-ethyl-y-l-butenyl-8-valerolactone (for example, see JP-A-Showa-53-84975) is costus-like lactone, and that saturatedγ-ethyl-y-butyl-5-valerolactone (for example, trade name: COSTAULON manufactured by PFW) is costus-like and woody-like lactone.<br>
In addition, as a lactone compound which can be used as a perfume, 4-cyclohexylpentanolide (for example, see JP-B-Showa-62-5123) and a-alkyl-β-alkyl-5-alkyl-5-valerolactone have been known (for example, see USP No.3,380,457).<br><br>
As explained above, since many of the above-mentioned lactones have no woody odor, even when the lactones are directly added to sandalwood-type aroma chemicals, the harmony of perfumes are insufficient, and moreover, foodlike sweetness impairs the characteristics of the natural sandalwood. In addition, among the lactones, those having a woody odor show a strong costus-like odor, and are insufficient in sweetness. Therefore, even when they are added to sandalwood-type aroma chemicals, sweetness having a natural sandalwood-like sweetness cannot be supplemented. In other words, conventionally, the perfume compositions having a characteristic soft and sweet woody and balsamic odor of natural sandalwood have not yet been artificially obtained.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The valerolactone compound of the present invention is represented by the formula (I), and has a sweet odor useful as a perfume substance.<br>
Among the compounds resented by the formula (I), α-methyl-β-ethyl-y-methyl-y-l-propenyl-5-valerolactone resented by the formula (II) is especially preferable since this compound itself has both a woodsy odor and a coumarin-like sweet odor which reminds of tonka beans, and is easily harmonized with a woodsy perfume. In other words, when a perfume composition is prepared by combining the valerolactone compound represented by the formula (II) with a woody perfume, a soft and sweet milk-like odor harmonized with a woody odor can be exhibited.<br>
Especially, when the valerolactone compound represented by the formula (II) is combined with a synthetic sandalwood-type aroma chemical, there can be provided an odor harmonized with the woody odor of the sandalwood-type aroma chemical, which has soft and sweet milk-like woody and balsamic odor, so that odor characteristics of natural sandalwood can be easily exhibited. Also, this valerolactone compound has an advantage such as long-lasting effect<br>
In addition, the valerolactone compound represented by the formula (I) is characterized in that the compound has an alkyl group on position a, p or y except position 5. Most of valerolactones commonly used as a perfume have an alkyl substituent on position 5, and have a sweet coconut-like odor. The more the number of the carbon atoms is, the stronger the characteristic milk-like odor<br><br>
becomes, so that it is more likely to be used for food flavor due to its odor character.<br>
On the other hand, the valerolactone compound represented by the formula (I) has a fragrance similar to the compound having an alkyl substituent on position 5 and a unique woodsy fragrance which the 5-substituted compound does not have; nevertheless this compound does not have an alkyl substituent on position 6. Therefore, the valerolactone compound has an advantage that the compound is easily harmonized with various perfumes, for instance, perfumes used in household products such as detergents for clothes and softeners for clothes; personal care and cosmetic products such as soap, body soap, shampoo, cosmetics and perfumes; environmental hygiene products such as air fresheners, deodorants, incense sticks and candles; and the like.<br>
In other words, since an alkyl substituent is introduced into the valerolactone on either position a, p or y, a compound having various characteristic odor such as a woody odor, a spicy odor and a floral odor together with a sweet odor can be synthesized. Furthermore, since an unsaturated bond is introduced into the valerolactone, the odor becomes stronger and gives various odor.<br>
For instance, the compound represented by the formula (III) has both a woody and a spicy odor, and emits a novel and strong odor which reminds of costus and iris.<br>
The compound represented by the formula (IV) has both a woody odor and floral odor. In addition, this compound has a novel and soft fragrance as compared to the compound represented by the formula (III).<br>
The compound represented by the formula (V) has a cedarwood-like<br><br>
woody odor and a coumarin-like sweet odor.<br>
The compound represented by the formula (VII) has both a woody odor and a green odor. Also, this compound has a novel odor which reminds of sandalwood, although this fragrance is slightly weaker than that of the compound represented by the formula (II).<br>
Each of the valerolactone compounds represented by the formula (I) can be included alone in the perfume composition, respectively. Altematively, the valerolactone compounds can be used in combination with two or more kinds. For instance, when two or more compounds selected from the group consisting of the compounds represented by the formula (II), the compounds represented by the formula (III), the compounds represented by the formula (IV), the compounds represented by the formula (V), the compounds represented by the formula (VI) and the compounds represented by the formula (VII) are used in combination, various odor having odor characters and various strength of odor, such as a woody odor, a floral odor, a spicy odor and a costus odor can be imparted to the compound. In addition, such combination has an advantage that the odor can be more easily matched with the uses of the fragrances as compared with the single use of the compound.<br>
The compound represented by the formula (V) has a woody odor and a novel coumarin-like sweet odor. The combination of the compound represented by the formula (V) with the compound represented by the formula (II) is especially suitable for the use as a substitute for a coumarin.<br>
The valerolactone compound represented by the formula (I) can be synthesized, for instance, via a route as shown in the Scheme 1.<br>
More specifically, an alkaline condensation reaction of an acrylonitrile<br><br>
derivative with a malonic acid ester derivative is carried out in the presence of an alkali such as sodium methoxide. Subsequently, the resulting compound A can be converted to a compound B with a hydride reducing reagent such as lithium borohydride (LiBH4). Thereafter, the nitrile moiety is hydrolyzed in the presence of an alkali (an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide and the like), and the resulting product is treated with an acid such as sulfuric acid, to synthesize a hydroxyvalerolactone C. The hydroxyl group of this compound is oxidized with an oxidizing agent such as pyridinium dichromate (PDC), to give an aldehyde D. The number of carbon atoms in the aldehyde is increased by Wittig reaction, and the resulting olefin is isomerized, to synthesize a compound F. In addition, the compound F' can be easily synthesized from the olefin having a side chain on position y by treating the olefin with hydrogen using a hydrogenation catalyst such as palladium/carbon (Pd/C).<br><br><br>
Also, a compound in which R4 is a phenyl group can be synthesized via a<br><br>
route as shown in the Scheme 2. More specifically, a compound G can be synthesized by carrying out an alkaline condensation reaction of an acrolein derivative with an aldehyde, followed by carrying out the oxidation.<br><br>
The valerolactone compound represented by the formula (II) can be synthesized, as shown in the Scheme 3, by using as a starting material, propanal represented by the formula (H) or 2-methyl-2-pentenal represented by the formula (J). In the scheme, X represents a hydrogen atom or a metal atom. The metal atom includes alkali metal atoms such as a potassium atom and a sodium atom, alkaline earth metal atoms such as a calcium atom and a magnesium atom, and the like. When the metal atom is an alkaline earth metal atom, X in the compound represented by the formula (L) is read as X/2.<br><br><br>
More specifically, the compound represented by the formula (K) and the compound represented by the formula (L) are sequentially prepared by treating propanal represented by the formula (H) or 2-methyl-2-pentenal represented by the formula (J) with a base. The resulting reaction solution is treated with an acid to react the -COOX group with the -OH group in the compound represented by the formula (L) to form a ring closure, and thereby the valerolactone compound represented by the formula (N) is prepared.<br>
First, propanal or 2-methyl-2-pentenal is treated with a base. In this case, propanal or 2-methyl-2-pentenal can be treated with a base in a solvent.<br>
The solvent is preferably a polar solvent from the viewpoint of enhancing<br><br>
the reactivity. For instance, lower alcohols having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, such as methanol, ethanol and isopropanol, and water are preferable. Among them, the combined use of water and a lower alcohol is preferable.<br>
The amount of the solvent is preferably 0 to 1000 parts by weight, more preferably 50 to 700 parts by weight, even more preferably 100 to 500 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of propanal or 2-methyl-2-pentenal, from the viewpoint of increasing the yield and enhancing the reactivity.<br>
The base includes alkali metal hydroxides such as potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide, and alkaline earth metal hydroxides such as calcium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide, alkali metal salts of a lower alcohol having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, such as potassium methoxide and sodium methoxide, and the like. Among them, one or more bases selected from the group consisting of potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium methoxide and sodium methoxide are preferable.<br>
The amount of the base is preferably 0.001 to 10 mol, more preferably 0.005 to 5 mol, even more preferably 0.01 to 1 mol, per one mol of propanal or 2-methyl-2-pentenal,<br>
As a method for treating propanal or 2-methyl-2-pentenal with a base, there can be cited, a method including mixing propanal or 2-methyl-2-pentenal with a base, for instance, a method including previously dissolving a base in a solvent and adding propanal or 2"methyl"2-pentenal to the resulting solution, a method including previously dissolving propanal or 2-methyl"2-pentenal in a solvent and adding a base or a solution thereof to the resulting solution, and the like.<br>
The atmosphere in which propanal or 2-methyl-2-pentenal is treated with<br><br>
the base is not limited to specified ones. The atmosphere is preferably an atmosphere of an inert gas such as nitrogen gas or argon gas. The temperature at which propanal or 2-methyl-2-pentenal is treated with the base is not limited to specified ones. The temperature may be usually 20*^ to 60'C.<br>
The end point for treating propanal or 2-methyl-2-pentenal with the base can be regarded as the time when propanal or 2-methyl-2-pentenal has disappeared as confirmed by, for instance, gas chromatography, thin layer chromatography or the like. The time period required for the treatment of propanal or 2-methyl-2-pentenal with the base cannot be absolutely determined since the time period varies depending on the reaction conditions. The time period is usually 1 to 48 hours or so.<br>
Next, the reaction solution obtained is treated with an acid to give a valerolactone compound.<br>
It is preferable that water and an ether are added to the reaction solution, the resulting solution is stirred and allowed to separate into an aqueous layer and an ether layer, and the aqueous layer is taken out from the solution by removing the ether layer to use the aqueous layer in the acid treatment, prior to the treatment of the reaction solution with an acid.<br>
In this case, as the ether, those commonly used such as diethyl ether can be used. The amounts of water and the ether are not limited to specified ones. Each amount of water and the ether is preferably 50 to 200 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the reaction solution, respectively.<br>
The acid includes inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid and phosphoric acid; and organic acids such as acetic acid, citric acid and tartaric acid. Among them, inorganic acids are preferable.<br><br>
The treatment of the reaction solution with the acid can be usually carried out by adding the acid to the reaction solution (aqueous layer) so that the pH of the reaction solution (aqueous layer) is 1 to 6, preferably 2 to 4, to make the solution acidic. During this treatment, the liquid temperature of the reaction solution is not limited to specified ones, and may be usually 5° to 40*^0 or so. The end point of the acid treatment can be regarded as the time point when the pH of the reaction solution is included in the above-mentioned range, as determined by using a pH test paper (for instance, commercially available from Merck under the trade name of Acilit pH 0 to 6).<br>
The valerolactone compound of the present invention is contained in the reaction mixture thus obtained by the acid treatment. The valerolactone compound can be isolated by adding, for instance, an ether to the reaction mixture to extract a crude product, and thereafter purifying the crude product by the use of silica gel chromatography or the like.<br>
The perfume composition of the present invention contains the valerolactone compound represented by the formula (I). The valerolactone compound represented by the formula (I) is a compound having a novel odor. Therefore, various novel odor can be easily created by combining this compound with various fragrances.<br>

The perfume composition of Example 9 in an amount of 0.4 parts by weight was sprayed to 99.6 parts by weight of a powder detergent composition having components described in the following Table 4, and 20 g of the resulting mixture was weighed. The mixture was dissolved in 30 L of hard water having 3.5°DH. A commercially available cotton towel having a weight of 2 kg was<br><br>
dipped in this aqueous solution, and stirred for 5 minutes, rinsed for 1 minute and dehydrated. When the flavor of this cotton towel was evaluated, a soft and sweet odor was recognized, and the effect of a valerolactone compound represented by the formula (II) was confirmed.<br><br>
Example 11 [Perftime composition for cloth softening agent]<br>
When 8 parts by weight of the perftime D obtained in Example 7 (e.g. compositions Di, D2, D3, D4 etc.) was added to 92 parts by weight of a perftime composition having components described in the following Table 5, perftime compositions for a cloth softening agent having a strong and sweet odor giving a volume to the odor could be obtained, respectively.<br><br><br><br>
Example 12 [Softening composition for cloth]<br>
The perftime composition of Example 11 in an amount of 5 parts by weight was added to 99.5 parts by weight of a softening agent composition having components described in the following Table 6, and 3 g of the mixture was weighed. Themixture was dissolved in SOL of water. A commercially available cotton towel having a weight of 2 kg was dipped in this aqueous solution, and stirred at 25°C for 1 minute. After dehydration, the cotton towel was dried at room temperature; the odor of the cotton towel was evaluated on the next day. As a result, a natural sandalwood-like odor was felt together with musk-like, amber-like and floral-like odor even in a dried cloth, and sweet odor was continued.<br><br>
Example 13 [Perftime composition for shampoo]<br>
When 5 parts by weight of the perftmie D obtained in Example 7 (e.g. compositions Di, D25 D3, D4 etc.) was added to 95 parts by weight of a perftime<br><br>
composition having components described in the following Table 7, perfume compositions for a shampoo having a soft and sweet odor intrinsic in natural sandalwood could be obtained, respectively.<br><br>
Example 14 [Perfiime composition for liquid body shampoo]<br><br>
When 10 parts by weight of the perfume D obtained in Example 7 (e.g. compositions Di, D2, D3, D4 etc.) was added to 90 parts by weight of a perfume composition having components described in the following Table 8, perfume compositions for a liquid body shampoo characterized in remaining of a soft and sweet odor on a skin could be obtained, respectively.<br><br><br>
Example 15 [Perfume composition for incense stick]<br>
When 5 parts by weight of the valerolactone compound represented by the formula (II) was added to 95 parts by weight of a perfume composition having components described in the following Table 9, a perfume composition for an incense stick having an oriental sweet odor like perfume could be obtained.<br><br><br>
Example 16 [Flavor composition for imparting milk flavor]<br>
When 0.8 part by weight of the valerolactone compound represented by the formula (II) was added to 99.2 parts by weight of a flavor composition having components described in the following Table 10, a perfume composition<br><br>
for imparting a milk flavor, having volume and a natural milk flavor could be obtained.<br><br><br>
When 0.1 part by weight of the flavor composition of Example 16 was added to 99.9 parts by weight of a milk coffee composition having components described in the following Table 11, a milk coffee composition having rich sweetness and a suitable bitter flavor could be obtained.<br><br>
