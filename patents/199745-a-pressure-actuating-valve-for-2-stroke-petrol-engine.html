				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>This Pressure Actuating Valve is devised to minimize escapement of unburnt charge from the exhaust port during scavenging action in 2- stroke engine. One reason for this problem is the higher location of exhaust port, compared to transfer ports. This valve closes the path, while rich charge is escaping through upper portion of exhaust port. This valve divides exhaust pipe in two compartments i.e. upper and lower. While lower compartment has direct access to exit, the upper compartment has this access through an opening in the valve body. This opening is closed and opened by a hinged flap valve actuating under gas pressure. A gripping mechanism controls the timing of valve. Exhaust gases disengage the grip and open the valve. The opened valve presents a large attack angle to exhaust flow, therefore gets again closed. When in closed position, it does not allow any gases, which have gradually become a rich charge, to escape through upper compartment. This saved charge burns along with main charge, resulting in to enhancement in fuel efficiency and thrust of the engine.</td>

				<td>The present invention relates to a Pressure Actuating Valve for 2-Stroke petrol engine<br>
It is a known fact that 2-Stroke petrol engines suffer from a major disadvantage, that is, a large portion of unburnt charge or fuel-air mixture escapes through the exhaust port during scavenging aption, as scavenging and charging actions take place simultaneously in 2-Stroke engines. This phenomenon is called short-circuiting of charge. This short-circuiting is the main contributory factor for low efficiency and higher emission levels in 2-Stroke engines.<br>
Some measures are already in use to minimize the escapement of unburnt charge (short circuiting) through the exhaust port, such as crowning of piston top, or using deflectors, making angular direction of flow of fresh charge through transfer ports, in the opposite direction to the exhaust port, etc. But still a substantial quantity of unburnt charge escapes through the exhaust port, mainly due to its higher location in comparison to the location of intake or transfer ports, which is a necessary evil in 2-Stroke engines as set out below.<br>
The higher location of exhaust port in comparison to the intake or transfer ports has two divergent effects. One of which is highly desirable and the other is equally undesirable i.e. during the piston journey from Top Dead Centre (TDC) to Bottom Dead Centre (BDC), it is most desirable to open the exhaust port first so that the burnt gases at high pressure may be allowed to escape and the pressure in the cylinder brought down, so that the fresh charge of fuel-air mixture is able to enter into the cylinder through the transfer ports. This desirable feature can be achieved only when the exhaust port is opened first. Therefore exhaust port is located at a higher location in comparison to the transfer ports. On the other hand it causes the exhaust port to close late in comparison to the transfer ports during the return journey of the piston i.e. from Bottom Dead Centre (BDC) to Top Dead Centre (TDC). This is equally an undesirable feature, because, both, the exhaust port and transfer ports are open and scavenging and charging actions take place simultaneously. The charge in the cylinder is gradually getting rich and till the exhaust port gets closed, the said short circuiting continues to take place. But considering a stage when transfer ports have just closed but the exhaust port is yet to be closed, only the fully concentrated or rich charge is escaping through the exhaust port, because by then the charge in the cylinder attains full rich ness, to the extent possible. This escapement of fully rich charge continues till the exhaust port gets closed. Evidently, short-circuiting during the above stage is particularly harm full because of high richness of the charge. This stage contributes largely to the total short-circuiting of charge. Although short-circuiting begins to take place much earlier to this stage, it starts to become particularly harm full, little before and during the course of the above mentioned stage, because of high richness of charge. This valve is particularly designed to<br>
prevent said short-circuiting when charge in the cylinder gets sufficiently rich or concentrated.<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide a Pressure Actuating Valve for 2-Stroke petrol engine which significantly reduces the escapement of unburnt charge from the exhaust port, due to short circuiting, a problem associated with 2-Stroke engines and is much more intense in the prior structures of this general type.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to provide a Pressure Actuating Valve for 2-Stroke petrol engine, which effectively improves volumetric efficiency, fuel efficiency and thrust of the engine and reduces emission levels, particularly hydrocarbons in the exhaust gases of 2-Stroke engine.<br>
Further and additional objects will become apparent from the description/accompanying drawings and appended claims.<br>

Referring to Fig. 1-5 (sheet 1-2) of one form of Pressure Actuating Valve, which is generally made of alloy steel, the valve body (1) is a base plate having a trapezoid like shape such that when fitted in the exhaust pipe (13), its longer sides (1d) make a close fit and flush with the internal walls of the exhaust pipe (13)and the concave curve (1c) on its one (broader) end rests inline or coincides with the curved surface of cylinder bore(17), leaving some clearance from the running piston (16) for taking care of linear expansion of the valve body (1), due to heat. . The relative position of the valve body (1), at the mouth of the exhaust port (18) is such, that the height of its end having concave curve (1c), from the lower surface of the exhaust port (18) is not less than 50% and not more than 75% of the total height of the exhaust port (18). Valve body (1) has one rectangular shaped opening (1a) in its middle portion (This opening could be of semi oval or other like shaped), for transfer of gases (20). Valve body (1) also has an oblong hole(1b), at the other (narrower) end and is used to position and clamp the valve body (1) to the exhaust pipe wall (12a) with the help of nut (10) and bolt (11) in conjunction with an arc shaped washer (2), whose arc diameter is equal to the bore diameter of the exhaust pipe and arc thickness is not less than15% and not more than 25% of bore diameter of the exhaust pipe (depending upon the design requirements). This arc shaped washer (2) ensures closing and sealing of the narrower end (1b) of the valve body (1) from the gap between it and the exhaust pipe wall (12a), thus leaving only the rectangular shaped opening (1a) for transfer of gases, after the Pressure Actuating Valve is fitted and clamped in the exhaust pipe (13). (This arc shaped washer (2) could be integral to the valve body 1). To accommodate arc shaped washer (2) and ensure close fitting with the exhaust pipe (13) walls, the said narrower end (1b)<br>
has been given a slight bend. The said clamping is done through a drilled hole (12), situated at a predetermined point in the exhaust pipe wall (12a), towards Top Dead Centre. This point is determined by the distance from the centre of the concave curve (1c) at one end of the valve body (1) to the centre of the oblong hole(1b) at the other end of the valve body (1), which is not less than 140% and not more than 200% of the exhaust pipe (13) bore diameter, (depending upon the design requirements). To ensure its positioning firmly and avoid springing action while in operation a supporting web (5), at right angle is provided at the centre of broader end, having concave curve (1c), whose edge rests on the lower surface of the exhaust pipe (13), for support.<br>
A vital part of this Pressure Actuating Valve is a thin rectangular metallic plate, similar in shape, but little over size than to the rectangular opening (1a), which carries a hinge (4a) on its one end and acts as a flap valve (3). To give strength to this flap valve (3), a supporting web (7), is provided at the centre line of its entire length, at right angle. This supporting web (7) in.turn carries a servo foil (7a) on its tip for giving additional force in closing the flap valve (3), while in operation. This is to be understood that the flap valve (3), supporting web (7) and servo foil (7a), all the three are at right angle to each other. This flap valve (3), is disposed on the valve body (1) with the help of a hinge pin (4). The hinge pin (4) passing through the hinge (4a) of the flap valve (3) and its ends fixed with the valve body (1), such that the hinge pin (4) is positioned on the edge of the rectangular opening (1a), which is towards concave curve (1c) of the valve body (1).Thus making flap valve (3), oscillate on the hinge, in such a way that when in closed or up position it covers/ shuts the rectangular opening (1a) completely and when in down position it uncovers/ opens the rectangular opening (1a).<br>
In order to make this flap valve (3) to operate at desired timing, a gripping mechanism consisting of an 'L shaped (other shapes are also viable) spring (9) and an adjusting hook (8) is disposed on the valve body (1). A friction edge (6) is also disposed on the centre line of the flap valve (3) at its end which is towards oblong hole (1b) and at a right angle to it, but in the opposite direction to supporting web (7). The friction edge (6) has a shape of convex curve with a small groove cut at the bottom of the convex curve. One arm of the 'L' shaped spring (9) is fixed with the valve body and the other free arm from its mid point, rests firm, with the spring pressure, in the cut groove of the convex curve of friction edge (6), when the flap valve (3) is in closed position. The end of free arm of spring (9) is placed in the loop of the adjusting hook (8), provided on the valve body (1), for proper and controlled movement of the spring arm. When the hinged flap valve (3) comes to open position, the free arm of the spring (9) looses contact from the friction edge (6). The adjusting hook (8) ensures that the free arm of the spring (9) does not over jump its set position and get stuck up during operation.<br>
This Pressure Actuating Valve, after fitting in the exhaust pipe (13), divides the exhaust pipe in two compartments i.e. upper compartment (14), which<br>
is towards Top Dead Centre and lower compartment (15), which is towards Bottom Dead Centre. The upper compartment (14) is thus completely closed and sealed from exit, due to close fitting of two longer sides (1d) of the valve body (1) with the internal walls of the exhaust pipe 1(3) and the arc shaped washer (2) on its narrower end (1b). At the broader end side (1c), both the compartments open in the cylinder and getting closed and open by the movement of the piston (16). In this position, while the lower compartment (15) has the direct connectivity for gases to pass to exit, the upper compartment (14) has this connectivity to exit via rectangular opening (1a). Therefore any escapement of gases (20) from upper compartment (14) have to be through the rectangular opening (1a), which is getting opened and closed by the hinged flap valve (3). This hinged flap valve (3) in turn actuates according to the direction of gas pressure acting on it and its timing being controlled by the above gripping mechanism.<br>
The operation of this valve is based upon the phenomena that the pressure of gases (20), while the piston(16) is descending from Top Dead Centre (TDC) to Bottom Dead Centre (BDC), is much higher than while it is ascending from Bottom Dead Centre (BDC) to Top Dead Centre (TDC). The above pressure difference has been put to advantage to operate the valve in such a fashion that the high pressure of burnt gases, while the piston(16) is descending through the upper compartment (14), pushes the spring and force opens the flap valve (3) by over coming the gripping force, which in turn gives way to the gases (20) to pass from upper compartment (14) to lower compartment (15) through the rectangular opening (1a). Since the lower compartment (15) is directly open to the exit through exhaust pipe (13), the gases (20) eventually pass to the exit through it. With the further travel of the piston (16) downwards and its reaching to the lower compartment (15), the reduced pressure which is still quite high now acts on the other side also or from beneath the valve body (1). In this position, flap valve (3), presents a large attack angle to the gas flow and is forced to close and gripped by gripping mechanism i.e. spring (9) and friction edge (6) provided on the valve body (1). To give more thrust for closing, a servo foil (7a) is provided to the valve, which presents small surface area, which is not less than 3% and not more than 5% of the area of the exhaust port (18), at right angle to the gas flow. Alternatively, a small coil spring (21) can be used to serve the purpose of servo foil (7a) by making a spring seat (22) on supporting web (5) and another spring seat (23) on supporting web (7), as shown at fig 5, sheet no. 2 (all other features remain same).<br>
After the flap valve (3) has come to closed position, there is no escapement of gases (20) through the upper compartment (14). During further downward and upward journey of the piston (16), the low pressure of gases (20) is not able to over come the gripping force. Therefore flap valve (3) remains closed and all the escapement of gases take place through the lower compartment (15) only. Consequently all the escapement of gases stops after the piston has covered the lower compartment (15) during its upward journey<br>
Jowards Top Dead Centre (TDC). Hence the area of upper compartment (14), which was exposed to the exit in the earlier structures of prior art has been timely closed as set out above and does no,t allow any gases (20), (which by now have become fully rich mixture), to escape. The net result is that the undesirable phenomena i.e. the escapement of unburnt mixture due to the higher location of the exhaust port in comparison to the transfer ports has been taken care of by this valve by not allowing the gases to pass to the exit through its upper compartment (14).<br>
It is this saving of rich mixture and making it to burn along with the main charge that benefits the overall performance of the engine as well as contributes in lowering the emission levels particularly hydro carbons and enhancing its thrust, volumetric efficiency and fuel efficiency.<br>
While a specific embodiment has been illustrated and described, it is to be understood that the relative positions of the components, dimensions and shapes may vary as the size of the engine or other design requirements necessitate. Accordingly, variation modifications and substitution of equivalent mechanism can be effected within the scope of this invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
