FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel compound, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, compositions containing them, and their use for treating medical disorders resulting from a deficiency in growth hormone.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Growth hormone is a hormone, which stimulates growth of all tissues capable of growing. In addition, growth hormone is known to have a number of effects on metabolic processes, e.g., stimulation of protein synthesis and free fatty acid mobilisation and to cause a switch in energy metabolism from carbohydrate to fatty acid metabolism. Deficiency in growth hormone can result in a number of severe medical disorders, e.g., dwarfism.<br>
Growth hormone Is released from the pituitary. The release is under tight control of a number of hormones and neurotransmitters either directly or indirectly. Growrth hormone release can be stimulated by growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) and inhibited by somatostatin. In both cases the hormones are released from the hypothalamus but their action is mediated primarily via specific receptors located in the pituitary. Other compounds which stimulate the release of growth hormone from the pituitary have also been described. For example arginine, L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-Dopa), glucagon, vasopressin, PACAP (pituitary adenylyl cyclase activating peptide), muscarinic receptor agonists and a synthetic hexapeptide, GHRP (growth hormone releasing peptide) release endogenous growth hormone either by a direct effect on the pituitary or by affecting the release of GHRH and/or somatostatin from the hypothalamus.<br>
In disorders or conditions where increased levels of growth hormone is desired, the protein nature of growth hormone makes anything but parenteral administration non-viable. Furthermore, other directly acting natural secretagogues, e.g., GHRH and PACAP, are longer polypeptides for which reason parenteral administration is preferred.<br>
The use of certain compounds for increasing the levels of growth hormone in mammals has previously been proposed, e.g. in EP 18 072, EP 83 864, WO 8302272, WO 8907110, WO 8901711, WO 8910933, WO 8809780, WO 9118016, WO 9201711, WO 9304081, WO 9413696, WO 9517423, WO 9514666, WO 9615148, WO 9622997, WO 9635713. WO 9700894, WO 9722620, WO 9723508, WO 9740023, and WO 9810653,<br><br>
The composition of growth hormone releasing compounds is important for their growth hormone releasing potency as well as their bioavailability. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a novel compound with growth hormone releasing properties. Moreover, it is an object to provide a novel growth hormone releasing compound (growth hormone secretagogue) which are specific and/or selective and have no or substantially no side-effects, such as e.g. release of LH, FSH, TSH, ACTH, vasopressin, oxytocin, Cortisol and/or prolactin. It is also an object to provide a compound which has a good oral bioavailability.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
in accordance with the present invention there is provided a novel compound which act directly on the pituitary cells under normal experimental conditions in vitro to release growth hormone therefrom.<br>
The growth hormone releasing compound can be utilized in vitro as unique research tools for understanding, inter alia, how growth hormone secretion is regulated at the pituitary level.<br>
Moreover, the growth hormone releasing compound of the present invention can also be administered in vivo to Increase endogenous growth hormone release.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to the compound obtainable by the procedure as described in example 1, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention relates to the compound obtainable by the procedure as described in example 1, and which compound is 2-Amino-N-[(1R)-2-[{3R)-3-benzyl-3-(N,N',N'-trimethylhydra2inocarbonyl)piperidin-1-y!]-1-<br><br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
The structure of the compound obtainable by the procedure as described in example 1 can e.g. be verified by X-ray diffraction analysis (e.g. as described in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 19th Edition (1995), especially pages 160 and 561-562).<br>
Any possible combination of two or more of the embodiments described herein is comprised within the scope of the present invention.<br><br>
The method in general<br>
The procedure used in this patent is based on peptide couplings well known in the art, and should in no way be interpreted as limiting the invention in any way.<br>
In the procedure, prior to a coupling of amino acid or peptide residues, a suitable protecting group such as tert butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) can be removed with methods well known to those skilled in the art. It is also possible to avoid the use of protecting groups. The appropriate amino acids may be protected and deprotected by methods known in the art and described by e.g. T.W. Green (Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2. Ed., John Wiley and Sons, New York 1991).<br>
Example 1 describes the procedure in details. By resolution of the racemic mixture of 3-benzylpiperidine-1,3-dicarboxylic acid 1-tert-butyl ester to obtain one of the enantiomeric compounds, the final compound obtained by the procedure is the diastereomer<br><br>
The compound of the present invention exhibits an improved resistance to proteolytic degradation by enzymes because it is non-natural, in particular because the natural amide bonds are replaced by non-natural amide bond mimetics. The increased resistance to proteolytic degradation of the compound of the invention in comparison with known hormone releasing peptides is expected to improve its bioavailability compared to that of the peptides suggested in the prior literature.<br><br>

Pharmacological Methods<br>
The compound of the present invention may be evaluated in vitro for its efficacy and potency to release growth hormone in rat pituitary primary cultures, and such evaluation may be performed as described below.<br>
The isolation of rat pituitary cells is a modification of O, Sartor et al.. Endocrinology 116. 1985, pp. 952-957. Male albino Sprague-Dawley rats (250 +/- 25 grams) were purchased from Mollegaard, Lille Skensved, Denmark. The rats were housed in group cages (four animals/cage) and placed in rooms with 12 hour light cycle. The room temperature varied from 19-24'C and the humidity from 30 - 60%.<br>
The rats were decapitated and the pituitaries dissected. The neurointermediate lobes were removed and the remaining tissue was immediately placed in ice-cold isolation buffer (Gey's medium (Gibco 041-04030) supplemented with 0.25% D-glucose. 2% non-essential amino acids (Gibco 043-01140) and 1% bovine serum albumine (BSA) (Sigma A-4503)). The tissue was cut into small pieces and transferred to isolation buffer supplemented with 3.8 mg/ml of trypsin (Worthington #3707 TRL-3) and 330 mg/ml of DNase (Sigma D-4527). This mixture was incubated at 70 rotations/min for 35 min at 37'C In a 95/5% atmosphere of O2/CO2. The tissue was then washed three times in the above buffer. Using a standard pasteur pipette, the tissue was then aspirated into single cells. After dispersion, cells were filtered through a nylon filter (160 mm) to remove undigested tissue. The cell suspension was washed<br><br>
3 times with isolation buffer supplemented with trypsin inhibitor (0.75 mg/ml, Worthington #2829) and finally resuspended in culture medium; DMEM (Gibco 041-01965) supplemented with 25 mM HEPES (Sigma H-3375), 4 mM glutamine (Gibco 043-05030H), 0.075% sodium bicarbonate (Sigma S-8875), 0.1% non-essential amino acid, 2.5% fetal calf serum (FCS, Gibco 011-06290), 3% horse semm (Gibco 034-06050), 10% fresh rat serum, 1 nM T3 (Sigma T-2752) and 40 mg/l dexamethasone (Sigma D-4902) pH 7.3, to a density of 2 x 10 cells/ml. The cells were seeded into microtiter plates (Nunc, Denmark), 200 ml/well, and cultured for 3 days at 37'C and 8% CO2.<br>
Compound testing<br>
After culturing, the cells were washed twice with stimulation buffer (Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (Gibco 041-04020) supplemented with 1% BSA (Sigma A-4503), 0.25% D-glucose (Sigma G-5250) and 25 mM HEPES (Sigma H-3375) pH 7.3) and preincubated for 1 hour at 37°C. The buffer was exchanged with 90 ml stimulation buffer (37'C). Ten ml test compound solution was added and the plates were incubated for 15 min at 37°C and 5% CO2. The medium was decanted and analyzed for GH content in an rGH SPA test system.<br>
The compound was tested in doses ranging from 10 pM to 100 mM. A dose-response relation was constructed using the Hill equation (Fig P, Biosoft). The efficacy (maximal GH released, Emax) was expressed in % of the E„ax of GHRP-6. The potency (EC50) was determined as the concentration inducing half maximal stimulation of the GH release.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be evaluated for its metabolic stability using the procedure described below:<br>
The compound is dissolved at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in water. 25 ml of this solution is added to 175 ml of the respective enzyme-solution (resulting in an enzyme:substrate ratio (w/w) of approximately 1:5). The solution is left at 37°C overnight. 10 ml of the various degradation solutions is analyzed against a corresponding zero-sample using flow injection electrospray mass spectrometry (ESMS) with selected ion monitoring of the molecular ion. If the signal has decreased more than 20% compared to the zero-sample, the remainder of the solution is analyzed by HPLC and mass spectrometry in order to identify the extent and site(s) of degradation precisely.<br>
Several standard peptides (ACTH 4-10, Angiotensin 1-14 and Glucagon) have been included in the stability tests in order to verify the ability of the various solutions to degrade peptides.<br>
Standard peptides (angiotensin 1-14, ACTH 4-10 and glucagon) were purchased from Sigma, MO, USA)<br><br>
Enzymes (trypsin, chynnotrypsin, elastase aminopeptidase M and carboxypeptidase Y and B) were all purchased from Boehringer Mannheim GmbH (IVIannheim, Germany)<br>
Pancreatic enzyme mix; trypsin, chymotrypsin and elastase in 100 mlVI ammoniumbicarbonate pH 8.0 (all concentrations 0.025 mg/ml).<br>
Carboxypeptidase mix: carboxypeptidase Y and B in 50 mM ammoniumacetate pH 4.5 (all concentrations 0,025 mg/ml).<br>
Aminopeptidase M solution: aminopeptidase IVI (0.025 mg/ml) in 100 mM ammoniumbicarbonate pH 8.0<br>
Mass spectrometric analysis was performed using two different mass spectrometers. A Sciex API III triple quadrupole LC-MS instrument (Sciex instruments, Thornhill, Ontario) equipped with an electrospray ion-source and a Bio-Ion 20 time-of-flight Plasma Desorption instrument (Bio-Ion Nordic AB, Uppsala, Sweden).<br>
Quantification of the compound (before and after degradation) was done on the API III instiument using single ion monitoring of the molecular ion in question with flow injection of the analyte. The liquid flow (MeOH:water 1:1) of 100 ml/min was controlled by an ABI 140B HPLC unit (Perktn-Elmer Applied Biosystems Divisions, Foster City, CA). The instrument parameters were set to standard operation conditions, and SIM monitoring was performed using the most intense molecular ion (in most cases this corresponded to the doubly charged molecular ion).<br>
Identification of degradation products furthermore involved the use of plasma desorption mass spectrometry (PDMS) with sample application on nitrocellulose coated targets and standard instrumental settings. The accuracy of the hereby determined masses is generally better than 0.1%.<br>
Separation and isolation of degradation products was done using a HY-TACH C-18 reverse phase 4.6x105 mm HPLC column (Hewlett-Packard Company, Palo Alto, CA) with a standard acetonitril: TFA separation gradient. The HPLC system used was HP1090M (Hewlett-Packard Company, Palo Alto, CA).<br><br><br><br>
