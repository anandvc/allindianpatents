				<td>This is a non-provisional application claiming priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119 from<br>
United States provisional application 60/337,753, filed on November 9, 2001.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Field of the Invention : The present invention relates to a device for injecting a<br>
viscous medicament. In particular, the present invention relates to an injector capable of<br>
delivering medicaments to animal and human subjects and to a method for delivering<br>
medicaments to animal or human subjects.<br>
State of the Art: Automatic injectors (hereinafter referred to "autoinjectors") are<br>
well known in the medical and veterinary industries and enable the automatic injection of<br>
a desired dose of medicament to animal or human subjects. Autoinjectors are generally<br>
designed according to one of two delivery mechanisms : those that deliver medicament<br>
using a needle (hereinafter "needled" autoinjectors); and those that do not (hereinafter<br>
"needle-less" autoinjectors) No matter what their design, autoinjectors are thought to<br>
exhibit several advantages relative to simple hypodermic syringes. For instance,<br>
because autoinjectors may be designed to automatically and reliably deliver a desired<br>
dose of medicament on demand, they facilitate quick, convenient, and accurate delivery<br>
of medicaments. In particular, autoinjectors are well suited for use by human subjects<br>
who must self-administer therapeutic substances. Moreover, where autoinjectors<br>
incorporate a needled injection mechanism, they may be designed so that the needle is<br>
hidden from view before, during, and after a delivery cycle, thereby<br>
reducing or eliminating any anxiety associated with the act of penetrating<br>
a visible needle into the subject's tissue. Various different injection devices are<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,797,489, 5,176,645, 5,527,287, 5,300,030, and<br>
6,270,479, U.S. Patent Application 20010005781, and International Publications<br>
WO 94/13342 and WO 95/31235.<br>
[0004] Despite the benefits they provide, however, state of the art<br>
autoinjectors are not generally designed for delivery of viscous medicaments.<br>
Because the medicament delivered by needle-less autoinjectors is typically<br>
accelerated to a very high velocity (e.g., 800 feet per second (fps) to 1,200 fps) to<br>
effect injection, needle-less autoinjectors are not well suited for the delivery of<br>
viscous medicaments or medicaments incorporating particles larger than a few<br>
microns in any dimension. Moreover, autoinjectors including needled injection<br>
mechanisms are generally designed to deliver aqueous solutions having very low<br>
viscosities, such as insulin or epinephrine solutions, and, therefore, do not<br>
typically address the performance hurdles presented when seeking to deliver<br>
viscous medicament via a needled injection mechanism.<br>
[0005] Generating an injection force of sufficient magnitude to drive a viscous<br>
medicament through a needle of suitable gauge within a suitable amount of time is<br>
one performance hurdle that must be overcome in order to deliver a viscous<br>
medicament via a needled injection device. To ensure the safety and comfort of<br>
the subject, the gauge of the needles used in needled injection devices typically<br>
ranges from about 21 gauge to about 31 gauge. Yet, a number of existing and<br>
emerging medicaments designed for delivery via subcutaneous, intramuscular, or<br>
intra-articular injection exhibit viscosities that range up to and above 10 Poise,<br>
100 Poise, 1,000 Poise, and even 10,000 Poise. As is easily appreciated by<br>
reference to the Hagen-Poiseuille Law, F = 8QµL(R2/r4), wherein "F" represents<br>
the injection force required, "Q" represents the flow rate of the material injected,<br>
2<br>
"µ" represents the viscosity of the material injected, "L" represents the length of<br>
the needle used, "R" represents the internal diameter of the reservoir containing<br>
the material to be injected, and "r" represents the internal diameter of the needle<br>
used, injection of such medicaments through a needle of suitable gauge may<br>
require an injection force that approaches or exceeds 100 pounds. For example,<br>
the Hagen-Poiseuille Law indicates that in order to deliver 0.5 cc of a medicament<br>
having a viscosity of 200 Poise within 10 seconds via a syringe having an internal<br>
diameter of 4.5 mm and a 0.5 inch needle having an internal diameter of 0.012<br>
inches (a 24 gauge needle), an injection force of approximately 100 pounds would<br>
be required. However, the injection mechanisms provided in currently available<br>
needled autoinjectors are generally not designed to generate such high injection<br>
forces.<br>
[0006] Subject discomfort is a second hurdle facing the design of a needled<br>
autoinjector capable of delivering viscous medicaments. For instance, the sudden<br>
application of a force suitable for delivering a viscous medicament via a needle of<br>
suitable gauge may startle the subject, particularly if the application of such force<br>
causes the transmission of noticeable recoil or impact forces. Thus, an injector<br>
capable of delivering viscous medicaments would ideally incorporate a driver that<br>
operates without producing sudden, potentially distressing noises or transmitting<br>
significant recoil or impact forces to the subject. In addition, driving a needle into<br>
the subject with the same force required to drive a viscous medicament through a<br>
needle of desired gauge may cause the subject unnecessary physical discomfort.<br>
For instance, where the gauge of the needle ranges from about 21 to 31 gauge, an<br>
insertion force ranging from about 1 to 7 pounds is believed to be most<br>
comfortable. Some studies even suggest that human subjects experience the least<br>
amount of pain when the needle is inserted with the least amount of force<br>
3<br>
necessary. Therefore, in order to minimize or reduce the discomfort of the<br>
intended subject, an injector capable of injecting viscous medicaments should not<br>
only operate unobtrusively, but, where desired, the injector should be capable of<br>
inserting a needle with an insertion force tailored to minimize subject discomfort.<br>
Ideally, such an injector would generate both an insertion force and an injection<br>
force sufficient to deliver a viscous medicament through a needle of desired gauge<br>
within a suitable amount of time using a single driving mechanism.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
(0007] The present invention provides a needled injector that may be used to<br>
deliver medicaments exhibiting a wide range of viscosities to human or animal<br>
subjects. In the context of the present invention, the term "viscosity" refers to the<br>
resistance of a material to sheer forces as measured at a 1.0 sec-1 shear rate and<br>
25°C using a Haake Rheometer, the term "viscous" is used to define medicaments<br>
having a viscosity of about 1 Poise or greater as measured at a 1.0 sec-1 shear rate<br>
and 25°C using a Haake Rheometer, and the term "medicament" is used to define<br>
any beneficial agent that may be administered by injection to either a human or<br>
animal subject. For example, medicaments that may be delivered using the<br>
injector of the present invention include liquids, suspensions, gels, solutions,<br>
slurries, and pastes containing any physiologically or pharmacologically active<br>
substance, or any other substance that may be of value in treating or caring for<br>
human or animal subjects.<br>
[0008] In each of its embodiments, the injector of the present invention may<br>
be designed to generate an injection force of sufficient magnitude to deliver a<br>
viscous medicament through a needle of suitable gauge within a chosen amount of<br>
time. Where desired, the injector of the present invention may be designed to<br>
drive the needle of the injector into the tissue of the subject with an insertion force<br>
that is tailored to minimize subject discomfort. Advantageously, the operation of<br>
the injector of the present invention is simple, quiet, and does not result in the<br>
transmission of noticeable recoil or impact forces. In addition, the design of the<br>
injector is extremely flexible, allowing the injector for use in virtually any context<br>
calling for the subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intra-articular injection of a<br>
medicament. Therefore, not only can an injector of the present invention be<br>
designed to deliver a wide range of medicaments, even viscous medicaments, but<br>
the injector of the present invention operates unobtrusively, thereby serving to<br>
minimize any anxiety experienced by the subject.<br>
[0009] The present invention also includes a method of injecting medicament.<br>
In each of its embodiments, the method of the present invention includes<br>
providing a desired medicament, providing a needle of a desired gauge, inserting<br>
the needle into the tissue of the subject, and generating an injection force<br>
sufficient to drive the medicament through the needle and into the tissue of the<br>
subject. Though the medicament provided in the method of the present invention<br>
may exhibit any viscosity, the method of the present invention preferably includes<br>
providing a viscous medicament. The gauge and length of the needle provided<br>
and used in the method of the present invention will depend upon, for example,<br>
the medicament delivered, the proposed subject, and whether the injection is<br>
subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intra-articular. Nevertheless, the gauge and length<br>
of the needle are preferably chosen to minimize subject discomfort. Further, the<br>
injection force generated in the method of the present invention must be sufficient<br>
to deliver a desired dose of the provided medicament within a suitable amount of<br>
time. Preferably, the injection force generated in the method of the present<br>
invention is sufficient delivering a desired dose of a chose medicament within, 10<br>
seconds, and even more preferably within 5 seconds. The exact magnitude of the<br>
injection force generated in the method of the present invention, however,<br>
depends on various factors, such as the medicament chosen, the length an gauge<br>
of the needle chosen and the desired delivery time. The method of the present<br>
invention may further include providing an insertion force, which is less than the<br>
injection force. The insertion force may be tailored to minimize subject<br>
discomfort as the needle is inserted into the tissue of the subject. For example,<br>
where the intended subject is human and the gauge of the needle provided ranges<br>
from between 21 gauge and 31 gauge, an insertion force of between about 1<br>
pound and 7 pounds is preferred, with an injection force of between about 1 and 4<br>
pounds being even more preferable. However, where the method of the present<br>
invention involves providing an insertion force, the magnitude of the insertion<br>
force will vary according to several factors, such as the anticipated subject, the<br>
gauge of the needle used to deliver the medicament, and whether the injection is<br>
to be subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intra-articular.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0011] The injector 10 of the present invention includes a pressurized gas<br>
source 50, an actuator 100, a driver 150, and a dispenser 200. The dispenser 200<br>
of the injector 10 includes a reservoir 210 for containing a desired amount of a<br>
chosen medicament 220 and a needle 250, such as a hypodermic needle, suitable<br>
for subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intra-arricular delivery of the chosen<br>
medicament 220. The actuator 100 actuates the transmission of pressurized gas<br>
from the pressurized gas source 50 to the driver 150, and as pressurized gas is<br>
delivered to the driver 150, the driver 150 exerts at least an injection force. The<br>
injection force is of sufficient magnitude to expel the medicament 220 through the<br>
needle 250 of the dispenser 200 within a desired amount of time.<br>
Advantageously, the design of the injector 10 of the present invention is extremely<br>
flexible, allowing the injector 10 to be designed to deliver a wide range of<br>
medicaments in virtually any human or veterinary context calling for the injection<br>
of the subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intra-arricular injection of medicament.<br>
An exemplary injector 10 according to the present invention is illustrated in FIG.<br>
1.<br>
[0012] Though any suitable source of pressurized gas may be used as the<br>
pressurized gas source 50 of the injector 10 of the present invention, it is presently<br>
preferred that the pressurized gas source 50 includes a microcylinder 52 of<br>
compressed gas. Microcylinders are economical, compact, and capable of storing<br>
varying amounts of gas at high pressures. For example, commercially available<br>
microcylinders can be reliably and inexpensively filled with about 1 gram to about<br>
30 grams of a suitable gas, such as carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, oxygen,<br>
nitrogen, or air, at pressures ranging between about 200 pounds per square inch<br>
("psi") to about 3,000 psi and above. Moreover, microcylinders having such<br>
capabilities can be extremely compact, having a length of one inch or less and a<br>
diameter of one-half inch or less. Therefore, a microcylinder 52 of pressurized<br>
gas provides a powerful, economical source of pressurized gas that allows the<br>
fabrication of an injector that is highly portable 10 and easy to use.<br>
[0013] Where a microcylinder is utilized in conjunction with the injector of<br>
the present invention, two general microcylinder designs are presently preferred.<br>
The first general design 54 (hereinafter referred to as a "sealed microcylinder") is<br>
illustrated in FIG. 2, and is exemplified by microcylinders having a cylinder body<br>
56 and a seal 58. Such microcylinders are available from Leland Limited, Inc., of<br>
South Plainfield, New Jersey. In order to release compressed gas maintained<br>
within a sealed microcylinder, the seal 58 must be compromised (e.g., broken,<br>
pierced, or otherwise penetrated). The second general microcylinder design 60<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "break-away microcylinders") is shown in FIG. 3 and is<br>
exemplified by microcylinders that include an elongated neck 62 extending away<br>
from a cylinder body 56, the elongated neck 62 being designed to break away<br>
upon application of a predetermined force. Such microcylinders are described in<br>
U.S. Patent 6,047,865 and U.S. Patent 5,845,811 and are manufactured by BOC<br>
Limited of London, U.K. As is easily appreciated, compressed gas stored within a<br>
break-away microcylinder is released when the elongated neck 62 of the<br>
microcylinder is broken. Though each of the embodiments illustrated and<br>
discussed herein utilize either a sealed microcylinder or a breakaway<br>
9<br>
microcylinder, the injector 10 of the present invention may be designed to utilize a<br>
microcylinder 52 of any suitable design.<br>
(0014] Where a microcylinder 52 is used as the pressurized gas source 50 of<br>
the injector 10 of the present invention, the microcylinder 52 is preferably<br>
disposed within a cap 64. A cap 64 effectively increases the dimensions of the<br>
microcylinder 52 and thereby eases manipulation of the microcylinder 52 when<br>
the microcylinder 52 is not mounted to the body 12 of the injector 10. Where<br>
provided, a cap 64 is configured to receive a microcylinder 52 of desired<br>
configuration and may be designed to maintain the microcylinder 52 within the<br>
cap 64 via any suitable means. For instance, the caps 64 illustrated in FIG. 1,<br>
FIG. 4 through FIG. 10, and FIG. 25 and FIG. 26 are sized and shaped such that<br>
the microcylinders 52 disposed therein are maintained within the caps 64 by a<br>
friction fit created by the interface of the microcylinders 52 with the inner walls<br>
66 of the caps 64. Though the caps 64 illustrated in FIG. 1, FIG. 4 through FIG.<br>
10, and FIG. 25 and FIG. 26 are designed to receive and maintain sealed<br>
microcylinders or breakaway microcylinders, a cap 64 used in an injector 10<br>
according to the present invention may be designed to receive and maintain a<br>
microcylinder 52 of any suitable design.<br>
[0015] A cap 64 may also facilitate mounting of the microcylinder 52 to the<br>
body 12 of the injector 10 of the present invention. For example, the cap 64 may<br>
be configured to allow mounting of the cap 64 to the body 12 of the injector 10<br>
using any bonding or adhesive process providing secure attachment of the cap 64<br>
to the body 12 of the injector 10. Alternatively, the cap 64 may include a first<br>
portion of a fastening mechanism that is complimentary to a second portion of a<br>
fastening mechanism provided on the body 12 of the injector 10. For instance, the<br>
cap 64 may be provided with a first threaded area that is compatible with a second<br>
threaded area formed on the body 12 of the injector 10. Alternatively, the cap 64<br>
may include a first portion of a snap-fit connector complimentary to a second<br>
portion of a snap fit connector provided on the body 12 of the injector 10. Further<br>
examples of fastening mechanisms that may be incorporated in a cap 64 and the<br>
body 12 of the injector 10 to facilitate mounting of the microcylinder 52 to the<br>
injector 10 are toggle assemblies and male/female connectors. However, it is to<br>
be understood that the cap 64 may incorporate any fastening mechanism capable<br>
of securely fastening the cap 64 to the body 12 of the injector 10.<br>
[0016] In order to minimize the unwanted escape of pressurized gas from the<br>
injector 10 of the present invention, one or more sealing members 18 may be<br>
provided where the cap 64 or microcylinder 52 interface with the body 12 of the<br>
injector 10. Such sealing members 18 may include O-rings or any other suitable<br>
sealing device capable of reducing or eliminating the escape of pressurized gas.<br>
The injector 10 illustrated in FIG. 1 includes a sealing member 18 positioned such<br>
that, as the microcylinder 52 is mounted to the body 12 of the injector, a seal is<br>
formed between the body 12 of the injector 10 and the microcylinder 52 before the<br>
seal 58 of the microcylinder 52 is compromised. FIG. 5 and FIG. 6 illustrate<br>
injectors 10 of the present invention including a sealing member 18 positioned<br>
between the cap 64 and the body 12 of the injectors 10. The sealing member 18 is<br>
positioned within a seat 70 formed within the cap 64 and creates a seal that<br>
reduces or eliminates the escape of pressurized gas from the injector 10. Though<br>
the various figures providing illustrations of injectors of the present invention<br>
illustrate sealing members 18 at particular positions between the microcylinder 52,<br>
the cap 64, and the body 12 of the injector 10, the placement of sealing members<br>
18 is not limited to the exact positions illustrated.<br>
[0017] The actuator 100 of the injector 10 of the present invention may<br>
include any suitable mechanism capable of actuating the flow of pressurized gas<br>
from the pressurized gas source 50 to the driver 150 of the injector 10. For<br>
instance, where the injector 10 of the present invention includes a microcylinder<br>
52 of compressed gas, the actuator 100 may include or trigger, piercing<br>
mechanism, plunger, or other force transfer mechanism that, upon actuation,<br>
compromises the microcylinder 52 (e.g., pierces, breaks, or penetrates the seal 58<br>
or breaks away the elongated neck 62 of the microcylinder 52) and allows<br>
pressurized gas to escape to the driver 150 of the injector 10. Alternatively, where<br>
the design of the injector 10 does not require that the actuator 100 compromises<br>
the pressurized gas source 50, the actuator 100 may include a valve for actuating<br>
the flow of pressurized gas from the pressurized gas source 50 to the driver 150.<br>
In order to prevent accidental activation, or "firing," of the injector 10, the<br>
actuator 100 may also be linked to or protected by a safety mechanism that serves<br>
to prevent triggering of the actuator 100 until a deliberate act is executed in<br>
preparation for use of the injector 10.<br>
[0018] FIG. 1 illustrates an injector 10 according to the present invention that<br>
includes an actuator 100 comprising a valve assembly 102 that allows the user to<br>
actuate flow of compressed gas from the pressurized gas source 50, through a first<br>
fluid path 16, and to the driver 150 of the injector 10. The valve assembly 102<br>
includes a valve seat 104, a valve body 106, a button 108, and a biasing element<br>
110, which may include a spring, a rubber bumper, a polymer bumper, or any<br>
other suitable resilient member. The biasing element 110 is placed within the<br>
valve seat 104 and acts against the valve body 106 to maintain valve body 106 in a<br>
normally closed position. In the closed position, the valve body 106 obstructs the<br>
first fluid path 16 and prevents gas flow to the driver 150. However, when<br>
sufficient pressure is exerted on the button 108, the valve body 104 is moved<br>
against the biasing member 110 into an open position (shown in FIG. 1). As the<br>
valve body 106 is placed in an open position, a depression 112 formed in the valve<br>
body 106 forms a second fluid path 114, which allows pressurized gas to flow<br>
from the first fluid path 16 to the driver 150. The valve body 106 may also<br>
include one or more sealing members 18, such as one or more O-rings. The<br>
sealing members 18 work to minimize any escape of pressurized gas from the<br>
valve assembly 102, particularly when the valve body 106 is placed in an open<br>
state.<br>
[0019] As can be appreciated by reference to FIG. 1, where an injector 10<br>
according to the present invention includes an actuator 100 comprising a valve<br>
assembly 102, the injector 10 may be provided with a mechanism designed to<br>
compromise the pressurized gas source 50 as it is mounted to the injector 10. The<br>
mechanism illustrated in FIG. 1 includes a hollow pierce pin 14, which defines a<br>
first fluid path 16 and penetrates the seal 58 of the microcylinder 52 as the cap 64<br>
containing the microcylinder 52 is threaded onto the body 12 of the injector 10. In<br>
order to minimize the undesired escape of pressurized gas from the system, a<br>
sealing member 18, such as an O-ring, may be positioned between the<br>
microcylinder 52 and the body 12 of the injector 10 (shown in FIG. 1) or between<br>
the cap 64 and the body 12 of the injector 10. As the microcylinder 52 is secured<br>
to the injector 10, the sealing member 18 forms a seal between the microcylinder<br>
52 and the body 12 of the injector 10 before the hollow pierce pin 14 has<br>
completely breached the seal 58 of the microcylinder 52. Once, the microcylinder<br>
52 is secured to the injector 10 and the seal 58 of the microcylinder 52 is<br>
compromised, the flow of pressurized gas from the microcylinder 52 to the driver<br>
150 is simply actuated through actuation of the valve assembly 102 of the actuator<br>
100.<br>
[0020] Instead of a valve assembly, the actuator 100 may simply include a<br>
piercing assembly, as is shown FIG. 4. Pressurized gas flow between the<br>
pressurized gas source 50 and the driver 150 of the injector 10 shown in FIG. 4 is<br>
actuated simply by mounting a cap 64 containing a microcylinder 52 to the body<br>
12 of the injector. As the cap 64 containing the microcylinder 52 is mounted to<br>
the injector 10, a hollow pierce pin 14 compromises the seal 58 of the<br>
microcylinder 52 and pressurized gas is delivered to the driver 150 from the<br>
microcylinder 52 through the first fluid path 16.<br>
[0021] Where a breakaway microcylinder 52 is used as the pressurized gas<br>
source 50 of an injector 10 according to the present invention, the actuator 100 of<br>
the injector 10 may include a plunger assembly 124, as shown in FIG. 6. The<br>
plunger assembly 124 may be incorporated into the body of the injector (not<br>
shown), or the plunger assembly 124 may be incorporated into a cap 64 containing<br>
the microcylinder 52 (shown in FIG. 6). Regardless of where it is provided, the<br>
plunger assembly 124 includes a passageway 126 within which the plunger 128 is<br>
disposed. The plunger assembly 124 may further include one or more sealing<br>
members 18, which form a seal between the plunger 128 and the passageway 126<br>
and minimize the undesired escape of pressurized gas through the plunger<br>
assembly 124 during use of the injector 10. Theplunger 128 may be moved back<br>
and forth within the passageway 126 and may be maintained within the<br>
passageway 126 of the actuator plunger mechanism 124 simply through a friction-<br>
fit or any other suitable means. Whether it is included in the body 12 of the<br>
injector 10 or a cap 64 containing the microcylinder 52, the plunger assembly 124<br>
is positioned such that the depression of the plunger 128 with sufficient force will<br>
break away the elongated neck 62 of the microcylinder 52. Though the plunger<br>
128 of the plunger assembly 124 illustrated in FIG. 6 is positioned generally<br>
perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the microcylinder 52 contained within<br>
the cap 64, such a configuration is not required, as shown in FIG. 7 and FIG. 8.<br>
[0022] The injector illustrated in FIG. 6 includes a safety mechanism 20,<br>
which serves to minimize accidental activation of the injector 10. The safety<br>
mechanism 20 includes a first portion 22, a second portion 24, and a spring 26.<br>
The first portion 22 is generally cylindrical in shape and includes a stop 32 and a<br>
slot 30 terminating in a port 31. The second portion 24 of the safety mechanism<br>
20 is also generally cylindrical in shape. At its distal end 34, the second portion<br>
24 includes a lip 36 sized to allow the passage of the adjustable tip 230 of the<br>
dispenser 200, but the lip 36 also serves as a mechanical stop, preventing the<br>
passage of the body 12 of the injector 10 through the distal end 34 of the second<br>
portion 24. The spring 26 is positioned within a seat 38 formed in the body 12 of<br>
the injector 10, and after the spring 26 is positioned within the seat 38, the first<br>
and second portions 22, 24 of the safety mechanism 20 are fastened together by<br>
any suitable means. For example, the first and second portions 22, 24 may be<br>
bonded, welded, glued, threaded, or snap-fit together. The spring 26 acts against<br>
the distal end 40 of the first portion 22 to bias the safety mechanism in a "safe"<br>
position. In the safe position, the stop 32 included on the first portion 22 prevents<br>
actuation of the actuator 100 included in the injector 10.<br>
[0023] The safety mechanism is moved out of the safe position illustrated in<br>
FIG. 6 by sliding the first and second portions 22, 24 against the spring 26 such<br>
that the stop 32 no longer interferes with the actuator 100. This may be<br>
accomplished by positioning the injector 10 generally perpendicularly against the<br>
tissue of a subject and applying a downward force sufficient to overcome the bias<br>
force exerted by the spring 26 of the safety mechanism 20. In the example shown<br>
in FIG. 7, the neck 129 of the plunger 128 passes through the slot 30 as the first<br>
and second portions 22, 24 are slid against the spring 26. Preferably, however, the<br>
slot 30 is sized to prevent the body 130 of the plunger 128 from being expelled<br>
from the passageway 126 as pressurized gas is released from the microcylinder<br>
52.<br>
[0024] The driver 150 of the present invention may be designed as a single<br>
stage driver 152 or a multistage driver 154. FIG. 4 and FIG. 24 illustrate injectors<br>
10 according to the present invention including a single stage driver 152, while<br>
FIG. 1, FIG. 5, FIG. 6, FIG. 9, FIG. 10, and FIG. 23 illustrate injectors 10<br>
according to the present invention including a multistage driver 154.<br>
[0025] Where the driver 150 of the present invention is a single stage driver<br>
152, the single stage driver 152 includes a single stage piston 156 disposed within<br>
a pneumatic cylinder 158 having at least one chamber 160. The single stage<br>
piston 156 provided in the single stage driver 152 includes a injection stage 162<br>
and may include a sealing member, such as an O-ring or cup seal (not shown in<br>
FIG. 4), that forms a seal between the injection stage 162 and the wall 164 of the<br>
chamber 160 of the pneumatic cylinder 158. The single stage piston 156<br>
optionally includes a plunger 166, which extends out and away from the injection<br>
stage 162 and is positioned to act against the dispenser 200 as the single stage<br>
piston 156 is driven through its stroke within the pneumatic cylinder 158.<br>
[0026] As pressurized gas enters the pneumatic cylinder 158 of a single stage<br>
driver 152, the pressurized gas acts against the injection stage 162 and drives the<br>
single stage piston 156 through its stroke with an injection force. The magnitude<br>
of the injection force exerted by the single stage piston 156 is equal to the surface<br>
area of the injection stage 162 multiplied by the pressure created within the<br>
chamber 160 of the pneumatic cylinder 158 (Force = Pressure x Area). Therefore,<br>
where a given pressure or pressure profile is produced within the chamber 160 of<br>
the pneumatic cylinder 158, the magnitude of the injection force exerted by the<br>
single stage piston 156 may be adjusted, as desired, by increasing or decreasing<br>
the surface area of the injection stage 162. The injection stage 162 of the single<br>
stage piston 154 is sized to ensure that the single stage piston 156 exerts an<br>
injection force sufficient to deliver a desired dose of a chosen medicament within<br>
a desired amount of time.<br>
[0027] A multistage driver 154 included in an injector 10 according to the<br>
present invention includes a pneumatic cylinder 158 having at least two chambers<br>
167, 168 and a multistage piston 170 having at least an insertion stage 172 and an<br>
injection stage 162. The insertion stage 172 of the multistage piston 170 is<br>
characterized by a first surface area and may include a first sealing member 174,<br>
such as an O-Ring. Alternatively, the first sealing member 174 may be provided<br>
in a seat 176 created within the wall 178 of the first chamber 167. The injection<br>
stage 162 of the multistage piston 170 is characterized by a second surface area,<br>
which is larger than the first surface area of the insertion stage 172. The injection<br>
stage 162 may include a second sealing member 180, such as an O-ring or cup<br>
seal, which creates a seal between the wall 182 of the second chamber 168 and the<br>
injection stage 162 as the multistage piston 170 is driven through its stroke. The<br>
multistage piston 170 may also a plunger 166 that extends out and away from the<br>
injection stage 162 and is positioned to act against the dispenser 200 of the<br>
injector 10. The pneumatic cylinder 158 and the multistage piston 170 are<br>
designed such that pressurized gas entering the pneumatic cylinder 158 acts<br>
against the insertion stage 172 and the injection stage 162 sequentially, thereby<br>
causing the multistage piston 170 to sequentially exert at least an insertion force<br>
and an injection force.<br>
[0028] Pressurized gas entering a multistage driver 154 included in an injector<br>
of the present invention acts sequentially against each stage. For example,<br>
pressurized gas entering the multistage driver 154 illustrated in FIG. 1, FIG. 5,<br>
FIG. 6, FIG. 9, FIG. 10, FIG. 23 acts first against the insertion stage 172 and<br>
second against the injection stage 162 of the multistage piston 170. As<br>
pressurized gas acts against the insertion stage 172, the multistage piston 170<br>
exerts an insertion force. The magnitude of the insertion force is equal to the<br>
pressure produced within the first chamber 167 of the pneumatic cylinder 158<br>
multiplied by the surface area of the insertion stage 172 (Force = Pressure x Area).<br>
Therefore, where a given pressure or pressure profile is produced within the first<br>
chamber 167, the insertion force exerted by the multistage piston 170 may be<br>
increased or decreased as desired simply by increasing or decreasing the surface<br>
area of the insertion stage 172. Advantageously, the insertion stage 172 of a<br>
multistage piston 170 may be sized such that the multistage piston 170 exerts an<br>
insertion force that minimizes subject discomfort.<br>
[0029] Once the insertion stage 172 of the multistage piston 170 is driven<br>
through a predetermined stroke, pressurized gas enters the second chamber 168 of<br>
the pneumatic cylinder 158 and acts against the injection stage 162, causing the<br>
multistage piston 170 to exert an injection force. The injection force exerted by<br>
the multistage piston 170 is equal to the pressure generated within the second<br>
chamber 168 multiplied by the surface area of the injection stage 162. Therefore,<br>
where a given pressure or pressure profile is produced within the second chamber<br>
168, the magnitude of the injection force exerted by the multistage piston 170 may<br>
be increased or decreased, as desired, by increasing or decreasing the surface area<br>
of the injection stage 162. Again, the injection stage 162 is sized to ensure the<br>
production of an injection force sufficient to deliver a desired dose of a chosen<br>
medicament within a desired amount of time.<br>
[0030] Achieving a desired pressure or pressure profile within the driver of an<br>
injector of the present invention may be accomplished by altering one or more of<br>
several design variables. For example, if the injector of the present invention does<br>
not include a pressure regulator or a restrictor, the pressure produced within driver<br>
will depend on the pressure and volume of compressed gas contained within the<br>
pressurized gas source, the volume of the pneumatic cylinder, and the stroke of<br>
the piston included in the pneumatic cylinder. If the injector includes a restrictor,<br>
the pressure generated within the driver will depend upon the pressure and volume<br>
of compressed gas contained within the pressurized gas source, the maximum rate<br>
of gas flow permitted by the restrictor, and the rate at which the medicament flows<br>
from the dispenser once a suitable injection force is generated. Finally, where the<br>
injector of the present invention includes a pressure regulator, the pressure<br>
generated within the driver can be controlled independently of the volume of the<br>
pneumatic cylinder, the stroke of the piston, or the rate at which medicament<br>
flows from the dispenser. Therefore, to create a desired pressure, series of<br>
pressures, or pressure profile within the driver of the injector of the present<br>
invention, any one of several components can be adjusted or added.<br>
[0031] FIG. 1, FIG. 2, FIG. 5, FIG. 6, FIG. 23, and FIG. 24 illustrate injectors<br>
10 according to the present invention that do not include either a restrictor or a<br>
pressure regulator. The pressure generated within the pneumatic cylinder 158 of<br>
the driver 150 of such injectors 10 can be accurately predicted and adjusted using<br>
the Ideal Gas Law, P1 V1 = P2V2. If the volume and pressure of the pressurized<br>
gas source 50 are taken to be P1 and V1, respectively, and the volume of the<br>
pneumatic cylinder 158 is taken to be V2, then the pressure (P2) generated within<br>
the pneumatic cylinder equals 158 the product of P1 and V1 divided by V2.<br>
Therefore, the pressure generated within the pneumatic cylinder 158, is directly<br>
proportional to volume and pressure of the gas contained within the pressurized<br>
gas source 50 and inversely proportional to the volume of the pneumatic cylinder<br>
158. Using this relationship, the pressure generated within the pneumatic<br>
cylinder 158 of an injector 10 lacking both a restrictor and a pressure regulator can<br>
be adjusted to a desired magnitude simply by modifying the pressure of the gas<br>
contained within the pressurized gas source 50 or by modifying the volume of<br>
either the pressurized gas source 50 or the pneumatic cylinder 158.<br>
[0032] As can be easily appreciated, where the injector 10 of the present<br>
invention does not include either a restrictor or a pressure regulator, the pressure<br>
produced in the one or more chambers 160, 167, 168 of the pneumatic cylinder<br>
158 will decrease at least slightly as the piston 156,170 moves through its stroke.<br>
This is because the pressure (P2) generated within pneumatic cylinder 158 is<br>
inversely proportional to the volume (V2) filled by the pressurized gas, and as the<br>
piston 156, 170 moves through its stroke the volume (V2) filled by pressurized gas<br>
necessarily increases. However, the extent to which the pressure (P2) decreases<br>
within the one or more chambers 160,167,168 of the pneumatic cylinder 158 can<br>
be at least partially controlled by varying the pressure (P1) and volume (V1) of gas<br>
contained in the pressurized gas source 50 or by increasing or decreasing the<br>
stroke of the piston 156,170, which will increase or decrease the change in<br>
volume (V2) as the piston 156, 170 is driven through the pneumatic cylinder 158.<br>
For example, for a pneumatic cylinder 158 of a given volume, the drop in pressure<br>
will be attenuated as the volume or pressure of gas delivered by the pressurized<br>
gas source 50 increases. Conversely, the drop in pressure within a pneumatic<br>
cylinder 158 of a given volume will be accentuated as the pressure or volume of<br>
gas delivered by the pressurized gas source 50 is decreased. Therefore, even<br>
where the injector 10 of the present invention does not include a restrictor or a<br>
pressure regulator, the range of insertion or injection forces produced by the driver<br>
150 of the injector 10 may be controlled by controlling the volume of the<br>
pneumatic cylinder 158, the dimensions of each stage 162, 172 of the piston 156,<br>
170, and the volume and pressure of pressurized gas stored within the pressurized<br>
gas source 52.<br>
[0033] If greater control of the pressure produced within the driver 150 is<br>
desired, the injector 10 of the present invention may be provided with a restrictor<br>
300 or a pressure regulator 400. FIG. 9 illustrates an injector 10 according to the<br>
present invention including a restrictor 300, while FIG. 10 illustrates an injector<br>
10 according to the present invention, which include a pressure regulator 400. By<br>
providing the injector 10 of the present invention with a restrictor 300 or a<br>
pressure regulator 400, a substantially constant gas pressure can be produced<br>
within the pneumatic cylinder 158 of the driver 150, thereby producing<br>
substantially constant insertion or injection forces.<br>
[0034] As can be appreciated by reference to FIG. 9, where a restrictor 300 is<br>
included in the injector 10 of the present invention, the restrictor 300 may simply<br>
include a plate 302 having an orifice 304 sized as desired to limit gas flow to a<br>
targeted maximum rate. The flow rate allowed by such a restrictor 300 is easily<br>
increased or decreased by increasing or decreasing the size of the orifice 304<br>
included in the plate 302. Alternatively, the injector 10 may include an adjustable<br>
restrictor (not shown) that allows the user to select a desired rate of gas flow<br>
within a given range. For instance, an adjustable restrictor may include a screw<br>
mechanism that is advanced or retracted as desired within a fluid passageway. As<br>
the screw mechanism is advanced within the fluid passageway, the fluid<br>
passageway is contracted and allows a relatively smaller maximum gas flow. As<br>
the screw mechanism is retracted, however, the fluid passageway is expanded,<br>
allowing a relatively larger maximum gas flow. Though the restrictor 300 shown<br>
in FIG. 9 is positioned between the actuator 100 and the pressurized gas source 50<br>
of the injector 10, a restrictor 300 included in an injector 10 of the present<br>
invention can be positioned in any other suitable location, such as between the<br>
actuator 100 and the pneumatic cylinder 158 of the driver 150.<br>
[0035] By adjusting the maximum gas flow allowed by the restrictor 300, the<br>
injector 10 of the present invention may be designed to provide a substantially<br>
constant injection force. In order to achieve a substantially constant injection<br>
force through use of a restrictor 300, the maximum rate of gas flow permitted by<br>
the restrictor 300 is tuned to match the rate at which medicament 220 is expelled<br>
from the dispenser 200 once an injection force is created within the pneumatic<br>
cylinder 158 of the driver 150. If the maximum rate of gas flow allowed by the<br>
restrictor 300 is tuned to match the rate at which the medicament 220 is expelled<br>
from the dispenser 200, the pressure within the pneumatic cylinder 158 will<br>
remain substantially constant as the medicament 220 is delivered to the subject.<br>
Therefore, the injector 10 of the present invention can be designed to exert a<br>
substantially constant injection force simply by providing the injector 10 with a<br>
properly tuned restrictor 300.<br>
[0036] FIG. 1 Oa through FIG. 13 illustrate an exemplary pressure regulator<br>
400, which allows constant insertion and injection forces to be produced<br>
independently of the volume of the pneumatic cylinder 158 included in the driver<br>
150, the stroke of the piston 170, or the rate at which medicament 220 is expelled<br>
from the dispenser 200. The pressure regulator 400 illustrated in these figures<br>
includes a base 402 and a cylindrical protrusion 404 extending out from the base<br>
402. The cylindrical protrusion 404 includes a first seat 406 for a first sealing<br>
element 408, a second seat 410 for a second sealing element 412, and a first fluid<br>
path 414. The first fluid path 414 facilitates flow of compressed gas from the<br>
pressurized gas source 50 to the actuator 100. The base 402 includes third seat<br>
416 for a third sealing element 418 and serves as a platform for a first spring<br>
element 420, a second spring element 422, and a spacer ring 424. The first and<br>
second spring elements 420,422 are positioned over the base 402 and around the<br>
cylindrical protrusion 404, and the spacer ring 424 is positioned over the first and<br>
second springs elements 420, 422. The sealing members 408,412,418 included<br>
in the pressure regulator may include any suitable sealing element, such as a<br>
gasket or an O-ring seal. Though any suitable structure may be used to create a<br>
pressure regulator 400 useful in the injector of the present invention, the pressure<br>
regulator 400 illustrated in FIG. 10a through FIG. 13 provides a compact device<br>
capable of maintaining the pressure within the driver 150 at or below a<br>
predetermined level.<br>
[0037] In use, pressurized gas passes from the pressurized gas source 50,<br>
through the first fluid path 414 of the pressure regulator 400, and to the driver<br>
150. As it flows to the driver 150 and accumulates, the pressurized gas exerts<br>
pressure against the base 402 of the pressure regulator 400. The pressure acting<br>
against the base 402 causes the base 402 to exert a force against the first and<br>
second spring elements 420,422, and as the pressure within the system<br>
approaches a predetermined threshold, the force exerted by the base 402 begins to<br>
compress the first and second spring elements 420,422. This pushes the first seal<br>
408 closer to an aperture 426, thereby restricting flow of pressurized gas from the<br>
pressurized gas source through the aperture 426. If the pressure acting against the<br>
base 402 reaches or exceeds the predetermined threshold, the force exerted by the<br>
base 402 overcomes the first and second spring elements 420,422 and the first<br>
seal 408 of the pressure regulator 402 seals the aperture 426, terminating gas flow<br>
from the pressurized gas source 50. As the pressure decreases below the<br>
predetermined threshold, the force exerted by the base 402 decreases and the first<br>
and second spring elements 420,422 draw the first seal 408 away from the<br>
aperture 426, allowing pressurized gas to flow from the pressurized gas source 50<br>
once again.<br>
[0038J The threshold pressure of the pressure regulator 400 shown in FIG. 10a<br>
through FIG. 13 is easily set to any desired value. The maximum pressure that is<br>
allowed by the pressure regulator 400 is determined by the surface area of the base<br>
402 and the combined bias force exerted by the first and second spring elements<br>
420, 422. For example, a pressure regulator designed to maintain the pressure<br>
within the driver at or below about 100 psi may be designed by providing a base<br>
402 having a diameter of about 0.5 inches and first and second spring elements<br>
420,422 that exert a combined maximum spring force of 20 lbs. As a pressure<br>
within the driver 150 reaches or exceeds about 100 psi, the force exerted by the<br>
base 402 against the first and second spring elements 420,422 will reach or<br>
exceed 20 lbs. (Force = Pressure x Area), causing the first seal 408 to seal the<br>
aperture 426 and terminate gas flow into the driver 150. By increasing or<br>
decreasing either the surface area of the base 402 or the combined bias force<br>
exerted by the first and second spring elements 420,422, a pressure regulator 400<br>
may be designed to maintain virtually any desired maximum pressure within the<br>
driver 150.<br>
(0039] As can be seen in FIG. 10b, the injector 10 of the present invention is<br>
not limited to including only a pressure regulator 400 or only a restrictor 300. If<br>
desirable or necessary, the injector 10 of the present invention may include both a<br>
pressure regulator 400 and a restrictor 300. Further, as is appreciable by reference<br>
to FIG. 10a and FIG. 10b, where the injector 10 of the present invention is<br>
provided with a pressure regulator 400, the pressure regulator 400 may be<br>
contained within a housing 430. Such a housing 430 is designed to received<br>
within the body 12 of the injector 10, and the housing 430 may be mounted to the<br>
body 12 using any suitable means. For example, the housing 430 may include a<br>
first threaded area complimentary to a second threaded area provided on the body<br>
12 of the injector 10. Alternatively, the housing 430 may be mounted to the body<br>
12 using any suitable adhesive or bonding methods. Though the pressure<br>
regulator 400 need not be provided in a housing 430 separate from the body 12 of<br>
the injector 10, providing a housing 430 for the pressure regulator may ease the<br>
manufacture of the body 12 and may simplify the inclusion of a pressure regulator<br>
400 in an injector 10 of the present invention.<br>
[0040] Just as the use of a housing 430 for the pressure regulator 400 may<br>
simplify inclusion of a pressure regulator 400 in the injector 10 of the present<br>
invention, providing an injector 10 of the present invention with a multi-piece<br>
body 12 may ease fabrication of the injector 10. For instance, the body 12 of the<br>
injectors 10 illustrated in FIG. 5 and FIG. 6 is constructed of a proximal portion<br>
40 and a distal portion 42. The proximal and distal portions 40, 42 are joined at<br>
an interface 44, for example, by a threading mechanism, a suitable adhesive,<br>
bonding, or welding process, or any other known means providing secure<br>
attachment. A sealing member 18, such as an O-ring, may be provided at the<br>
interface 44 of the proximal and distal portions 40, 42 in order to reduce or<br>
eliminate the unwanted escape of pressurized gas from the injector 10. Both the<br>
proximal portion 40 and the distal portion 42 are designed with various features<br>
that facilitate the assembly and proper function of the injector 10, and by<br>
manufacturing the proximal and distal portions 40,42 as different pieces, the<br>
design and creation of the various features of each portion may be eased. For<br>
example, if the proximal and distal portions 40, 42 of the body 12 of the injectors<br>
illustrated in FIG. 5 and FIG. 6 were integrated into a one-piece body, the creation<br>
of the seat 176 for the first sealing member 174 would be relatively difficult,<br>
possibly requiring custom tooling and likely increasing the cost of fabricating the<br>
injector 10 of the present invention. However, because the proximal portion 40 of<br>
the injectors 10 illustrated in FIG. 5 and FIG. 6 is manufactured separately from<br>
the distal portion 42, the seat 176 for the first sealing member 174 is easily and<br>
inexpensively created within the proximal portion 40 before the proximal portion<br>
40 and the distal portion 42 are joined to form the body 12 of the injector 10.<br>
Therefore, though it is not required, the body 12 of the injector 10 of the present<br>
invention may be manufactured in multiple components to facilitate the<br>
manufacture or fabrication of the injector 10.<br>
[0041] As is true of the components already discussed, the design of the<br>
dispenser 200 of the injector 10 of the present invention is flexible. The dispenser<br>
200 of the injector 10 need only include a reservoir 210, such as a syringe 211,<br>
suitable to contain a desired viscous medicament 220, a needle 250 of suitable<br>
gauge to deliver the desired medicament 220 to the subject, and a piston 270 to<br>
drive the medicament from the reservoir 210 through the needle 250. Though the<br>
injectors 10 illustrated herein include a dispenser 200 including a piston 270 that<br>
is separate from the single stage or multistage pistons 156, 170 included in the<br>
driver 150 of those injectors 10, the piston 270 of the dispenser 200 may also be<br>
integrated into the plunger 166 of the piston 156, 170 included in the driver 150.<br>
[0042] The gauge of the needle 250 included in the dispenser 200 is generally<br>
chosen to be as small as practical. Although the force and time required to deliver<br>
a given medicament 220 through the needle 250 will generally increase as the<br>
diameter of the needle 250 decreases, subject comfort generally increases as the<br>
diameter of the needle 250 decreases. As a result, particularly where the intended<br>
subject is human, the gauge of the needle 250 included in the dispenser is<br>
preferably ranges from 21 gauge to 31 gauge. Even more preferably, the needle<br>
250 included in the dispenser will have a gauge ranging between 24 gauge and<br>
31 gauge, and most preferably, the needle 250 will have a falling within the range<br>
of 27 gauge to 31 gauge. Though a smaller gauge needle will generally be<br>
preferred over a larger gauge needle, where the difference in gauge would not<br>
significantly alter the comfort of the subject, the larger gauge needle may be<br>
chosen to decrease the injection force or injection time required to deliver a given<br>
medicament. Further, although 21 gauge to 31 gauge needles are presently<br>
preferred, where desired or necessary, the injector of the present invention can be<br>
provided with a needle having a gauge outside that presently preferred range.<br>
[0043] To the extent possible, the inner diameter Dr of the reservoir 210<br>
should be chosen to approximate the gauge of the needle 250. This is because the<br>
injection force required to drive a viscous medicament from the reservoir 210<br>
through the needle 250 increases exponentially as the inner diameter Dr of the<br>
reservoir 210 increases away from the inner diameter Dn of the needle 250. Of<br>
course, the benefits of approximating the inner diameter Dr of the reservoir 210 to<br>
the inner diameter Dn of the needle 250 are balanced against other design factors,<br>
such as the desired size of the dispenser 200 and the volume of medicament 220 to<br>
be delivered.<br>
[0044J The dispenser 200 may also include a bias mechanism 280, whereby<br>
the needle 250 and reservoir 210 of the dispenser 200 are maintained in a retracted<br>
position until an insertion or injection force is communicated to the dispenser 200<br>
from the driver 150. Where the driver 150 of the injector 10 includes a single<br>
stage piston 156, the bias mechanism 280 retains the reservoir 210 and needle 250<br>
in a retracted position until an injection force is exerted against the piston 270 of<br>
the dispenser. However, where the driver 150 of the injector 10 includes a<br>
multistage piston 170, the bias mechanism 280 maintains the needle 250 and<br>
reservoir 210 in a retracted position until an insertion force is exerted against the<br>
piston 270 of the dispenser. Moreover, regardless of whether the injector 10<br>
includes a multistage driver 154 or single stage driver 152, as the pressure created<br>
within the injector 10 dissipates after an injection cycle, the bias mechanism 280<br>
automatically retracts the reservoir 210 and needle 250 within the dispenser 200.<br>
[0045] The bias mechanism 280 may include any suitable device for biasing<br>
the reservoir 210 and needle 250 in a retracted position. For example, the bias<br>
mechanism 280 may include a coil spring 282 supporting the reservoir 210 and<br>
needle 250 within the dispenser 200. Alternatively, the bias mechanism 280 may<br>
include any other suitable biasing member, such as a solid or foamed rubber or<br>
polymer bumper, or a fluid filled, resilient bladder. The spring rate or force<br>
required to compress the bias mechanism 280 may be varied, as desired, provided<br>
that such spring rate or force is at least sufficient to bias the reservoir 210 and<br>
needle 250 in a retracted position.<br>
[0046] Where an injector 10 of the present invention includes a single stage<br>
driver 152 and a bias mechanism 280, the injection force exerted by the single<br>
stage driver 152 and the bias force exerted by the bias mechanism 280 may be<br>
adjusted to provide an effective insertion force of desired magnitude. The<br>
effective insertion force is the force with which the needle 250 extends from the<br>
casing 219 of the dispenser, and where the injector 10 of the present invention<br>
includes a single stage driver 150 and a bias mechanism 280, the effective<br>
insertion force is equal to the injection force generated by the single stage driver<br>
152 minus the bias force exerted by the bias mechanism 280. By adjusting either<br>
the injection force exerted by the single stage driver 152 or the bias force exerted<br>
by the bias mechanism 280, a desired effective insertion force may be achieved.<br>
For instance, where an injection force of 10 lbs. is required, an effective insertion<br>
force of about 1 lbs. to about 7 lbs. may be achieved by providing a bias<br>
mechanism 280 that exerts a bias force of about 9 lbs. to about 3 lbs. Even if<br>
higher injection forces are necessary, an effective insertion force of about 1 lbs. to<br>
about 7 lbs. may be achieved by providing a bias mechanism 280 capable of<br>
exerting a higher bias force. Therefore, even where the injector 10 of the present<br>
invention includes a single stage driver 152, the injector 10 may be designed to<br>
provide an effective insertion force tailored to minimize subject discomfort, while<br>
simultaneously generating an injection force sufficient to deliver a chosen<br>
medicament within a desired amount of time.<br>
[0047J The effective insertion force of an injector 10 including a multistage<br>
driver 154 and a bias mechanism 280 may also be adjusted as desired. Where the<br>
injector 10 of the present invention includes a multistage driver 154 and a bias<br>
mechanism 280, the effective insertion force is equal to the insertion force exerted<br>
by the multistage driver 154 minus the bias force exerted by the bias mechanism<br>
280. Consequently, the effective insertion force provided by an injector 10<br>
including a multistage driver 154 and a bias mechanism 280 is easily adjusted by<br>
altering either the insertion force exerted by the multistage driver 154 or the bias<br>
force exerted by the bias mechanism 280. For example, where the bias<br>
mechanism 280 exerts a bias force of about 1 lbs. and an effective insertion force<br>
of about 1 lbs. to 7 lbs. is desired, the pressurized gas source 50 and the multistage<br>
driver 154 of the injector 10 may be designed to exert an insertion force of about 2<br>
lbs. to 8 lbs. Alternatively, if the pressurized gas source 50 and multistage driver<br>
154 of the injector 10 are designed to exert an insertion force of about 5 lbs. and<br>
an effective insertion force of about 1 lbs. to about 4 lbs. is desired, the dispenser<br>
200 of the injector 10 may be provided with a bias mechanism 280 exerting a bias<br>
force of about 1 lbs. to 4 lbs. Thus, where the injector 10 of the present invention<br>
includes both a bias mechanism 280 and a multistage driver 154, the effective<br>
insertion force provided by the injector 10 can be tailored, as desired, to minimize<br>
subject discomfort.<br>
[0048] A range of about 1 lbs. to about 7 lbs. is specifically discussed in<br>
relation to injectors 10 of the present invention including multistage and single<br>
stage drivers 152, 154, because it is thought that, where a needle having a gauge<br>
ranging from 21 gauge to 31 gauge is used, an effective insertion force of between<br>
about 1 lbs. and 7 lbs. will minimize subject discomfort. However, the injector 10<br>
of the present invention is not limited to those designs providing an effective<br>
insertion force ranging from about 1 lbs. to about 7 lbs. The design of the injector<br>
10 of the present invention is highly flexible, and the injector 10 of the present<br>
invention may be designed to insert the needle 250 included in the dispenser 200<br>
with virtually any desired force.<br>
[0049] FIG. 14 through FIG. 15 illustrate a first syringe cartridge 204 that may<br>
be used as a dispenser 200 in an injector 10 according to the present invention<br>
(See FIG. 1, FIG. 9 and FIG. 10). As can be seen in FIG. 14, the dispenser 200<br>
includes a sleeve 202 and a syringe cartridge 204. The sleeve 202 is attached to<br>
the body 12 of the injector 10 and is designed to receive and retain the syringe<br>
cartridge 204. Any suitable attachment mechanism may be used to attach the<br>
sleeve 202 to the body 12 of the injector 10. For example, the sleeve 202 may be<br>
permanently attached to the body 12 of the injector 10 through a bonding process,<br>
a welding process, or by any other suitable means for permanent attachment.<br>
Alternatively, the sleeve 202 may be removably attached to body 12 of the<br>
injector 10 using, for example, a threading mechanism, a snap-fit connection, a<br>
male/female connection mechanism, or any other suitable mechanism providing<br>
non-permanent attachment. The sleeve 202 facilitates removable attachment of<br>
the syringe cartridge 204 and serves to protect the pneumatic cylinder 158 when<br>
the syringe cartridge 204 is removed.<br>
[0050] FIG. 14 provides an exploded view of the sleeve 202, syringe cartridge<br>
204, and the components which facilitate releasable mounting of the syringe<br>
cartridge 204 within the sleeve 202. As can be seen in FIG. 14, the sleeve 202<br>
includes a spacer ring 206 and a locking ring 208. Once the sleeve is mounted to<br>
the body 12 of the injector 10, the locking ring 208 and the spacer ring 206 are<br>
maintained within the sleeve 202 by a retaining member 212, such as a ridge or<br>
any other suitable structure or device. The syringe cartridge 204 is advanced<br>
through the sleeve 202 until a seal 216 included at the proximal end 218 of the<br>
syringe cartridge 204 abuts the body 12 of the injector 10. Once the syringe<br>
cartridge 204 is fully advanced, it may be locked into place by applying a first<br>
torque, which causes locking members 223, included on the casing 219 of the<br>
syringe cartridge 204, to engage biased locking tabs 222 included in the locking<br>
ring 208. After use, the syringe cartridge 204 may be removed from the injector<br>
10 by applying a second torque, which disengages the biased locking tabs 222<br>
from the locking members 223 of the syringe cartridge 204. It is to be understood,<br>
however, that the dispenser 200 of the first embodiment of the injector 10 need<br>
not include a sleeve 202 and the syringe cartridge 204 may be permanently<br>
attached to the injector 10, particularly where the injector 10 is designed for a<br>
single use.<br>
[0051] FIG. 15 provides a cross-sectional view of the syringe cartridge 204.<br>
As can be seen by reference to FIG. 15, the casing 219 of the syringe cartridge<br>
204 houses a biasing mechanism 280 and a syringe 211 having a piston 270 and a<br>
needle 250, such as a hypodermic needle, through which medicament 220 is<br>
delivered. The biasing mechanism 280 supports the syringe 211 within the casing<br>
219 and biases the reservoir 210 and needle 250 in a retracted position. The<br>
biasing mechanism 280 preferably includes a coil spring 282 through which the<br>
syringe 211 and needle 250 can be disposed.<br>
[0052] The syringe cartridge 204 shown in FIG. 14 through FIG. 15 also<br>
includes an adjustable tip 230, which engages the distal end 221 of the casing 219<br>
in any manner that permits the adjustable tip 230 to be advanced or retracted<br>
relative to the distal end 221 of the casing 219. For instance, the adjustable tip<br>
230 may include a first threaded area and the distal end 221 of the casing 219 may<br>
include a second threaded area complimentary to the first threaded area, allowing<br>
the adjustable tip 230 to be advanced or retracted along the distal end 221 of the<br>
casing 219. However, the adjustable tip 230 may be mounted by any other<br>
suitable mechanism, such as a snap-fit mechanism or a ratchet fit mechanism, that<br>
allows the adjustable tip 230 to be advanced or retracted along the distal end 221<br>
of the casing 219. Though the syringe cartridge 204 need not include an<br>
adjustable tip 230, providing the syringe cartridge with an adjustable tip 230<br>
facilitates simple adjustment of the depth to which the needle 250 is inserted.<br>
[0053] FIG. 16 through FIG. 22 illustrate a collapsible syringe cartridge 240<br>
hat may be used in an injector 10 according to the present invention. The<br>
collapsible syringe cartridge 240 includes a casing 219 having a collapsible<br>
portion 290 and a fixed portion 292. A syringe 211 serves as the reservoir 210.<br>
The syringe 211 terminates in a needle 250 of desired gauge and includes a piston<br>
270. The collapsible syringe cartridge 240 further includes a bias mechanism 280<br>
including a coil spring 282, which maintains the syringe 211 and needle 250 in a<br>
normally retracted position within the casing 219. Advantageously, the<br>
collapsible portion 290 of the casing 219 allows the use of a shorter piston 156,<br>
170 within the driver 150 and thereby facilitates the construction of a shorter<br>
injector 10.<br>
[0054] As can be seen in FIG. 5, FIG. 6, and FIG. 16 through FIG. 22, the<br>
casing 219 of the collapsible syringe cartridge 240 is designed to facilitate<br>
mounting of the collapsible syringe cartridge 240 within the body 12 of the<br>
injector 10. The casing 219 of the collapsible syringe cartridge 240 is not only<br>
shaped and sized to fit within a complimentary mounting area 242 provided in the<br>
body 12 of the injector 10, but the casing 219 also provides a suitable mechanism<br>
by which the collapsible syringe cartridge 240 may be mounted to an injector 10<br>
of the present invention. For example, as is shown in FIG. 5, FIG. 6, and FIG. 16<br>
through FIG. 22, the casing 219 may include a first threaded area that is<br>
complimentary to a second threaded area formed within the body 12 of the<br>
injector 10. Alternatively, the casing 219 of the collapsible syringe cartridge 240<br>
may include one or more locking tabs 246 (shown in FIG. 20 through FIG. 22)<br>
complimentary to one or more recesses (not shown) formed within the body 12 of<br>
the injector 10. Though FIG. 5, FIG. 6, and FIG. 16 through FIG. 22 show<br>
collapsible syringe cartridges 240 including two specific mounting mechanisms, a<br>
collapsible syringe cartridge 240 useful with an injector 10 of the present<br>
invention may incorporate any other suitable mounting mechanism.<br>
[0055] The collapsible portion 290 of the casing 219 is sized such that it can<br>
be displaced into and out of the fixed portion 292 of the casing 219. To help<br>
ensure that the collapsible portion 290 is not entirely displaced from the fixed<br>
portion 292, the distal end 293 of the collapsible portion 290 may be provided<br>
with a first lip 294 and the proximal end 295 of the fixed portion 292 may be<br>
provided with a second lip 296. As the collapsible portion 290 extends out of the<br>
fixed portion 292, the first lip 294 engages the second lip 296, which inhibits<br>
further extension of the collapsible portion 290 from the fixed portion 292. The<br>
collapsible portion 290 is also shaped and sized to receive the coil spring 282 that<br>
serves as the biasing mechanism 280. The coil spring 282 maintains the<br>
collapsible portion 290 in a normally extended position, which corresponds to the<br>
retracted position of the syringe 211 and needle 250.<br>
[0056] The proximal end 297 of the collapsible portion 290 includes an orifice<br>
298 sized to permit positioning of the syringe 212 within the collapsible the<br>
syringe cartridge 240. However, the orifice 298 is also sized to catch the proximal<br>
end 213 of the syringe 211 as the syringe 211 is positioned through the orifice<br>
298. Thus, as an injection or insertion force is applied to the piston 270 included<br>
in the syringe 211 and the syringe 211 is displaced against the coil spring 282, the<br>
collapsible portion 290 is displaced with the syringe 211 into the fixed portion 292<br>
of the casing 219 (shown in FIG. 19). Significantly, because the collapsible<br>
portion 290 is displaced within the fixed portion 292 of casing 219, the plunger<br>
166 of the multistage or single stage piston 156, 170 included in the driver 150<br>
need only be long enough to expel a desired dose of medicament 220 from the<br>
syringe 211. In contrast, where a syringe cartridge does not include a collapsible<br>
portion 290, such as the syringe cartridge 204 shown in FIG. 14 and FIG. 15, the<br>
plunger 166 of the piston 156, 170 must be long enough to both displace the<br>
syringe 211 within the syringe cartridge 204 and expel a desired dose of<br>
medicament 220.<br>
[0057] If desired, the collapsible syringe cartridge 240 may be provided with a<br>
locking mechanism that serves to minimize accidental compression of the syringe<br>
211 before the collapsible syringe cartridge 240 is mounted to an injector 10. For<br>
example, as shown in FIG. 20 through FIG. 22, the collapsible portion may<br>
include one or more ears 272, which extend away from the outer surface of the<br>
collapsible portion 290. When the collapsible portion 290 is in a locked position,<br>
the one or more ears 272 cannot pass through the proximal end 295 of the fixed<br>
portion 292 of the casing 219, thereby preventing the collapsible portion 290 from<br>
being displaced within the fixed portion 292. In an unlocked position, the one or<br>
more ears 272 are aligned with one or more corresponding passages 276 provided<br>
in the proximal end 295 of the fixed portion 292 of the casing 219. The one or<br>
more corresponding passages 276 allow the one or more ears 272 to pass through<br>
the proximal end 295 of the fixed portion 292 of the casing 219, thereby allowing<br>
the collapsible portion 290 to be displaced within the fixed portion 292.<br>
Preferably, the body 12 of the injector 10 and the collapsible syringe cartridge 240<br>
are designed such that mounting the collapsible syringe cartridge 240 to the<br>
injector 10 aligns the one or more ears 272 with the one or more corresponding<br>
passages 276, while removing the collapsible syringe cartridge 240 from the<br>
injector 10 misaligns the one or more ears 272 with one or more corresponding<br>
passages 276.<br>
[00581 If desired, the collapsible syringe cartridge 240 may also include an<br>
adjustable tip 230, which engages the distal end 221 of the casing 219 in any<br>
manner that permits the adjustable tip 230 to be advanced or retracted relative to<br>
the distal end 221 of the casing 219. Again, the adjustable tip 230 may include a<br>
first threaded area complimentary to a second threaded area provided at the distal<br>
end 221 of the casing 219. However, adjustable tip 230 may be mounted by any<br>
other suitable mechanism, such as a snap-fit mechanism or a ratchet fit<br>
mechanism, that allows the adjustable tip 230 to be advanced or retracted along<br>
the distal end 221 of the casing 219.<br>
[0059] The injector 10 of the present invention may also include a pressure<br>
relief mechanism for dissipating gas pressure developed within the pneumatic<br>
cylinder 158. For example, the injector 10 of the present invention may be<br>
designed to allow venting of pressurized gas once the piston 170 reaches a<br>
predetermined position within the pneumatic cylinder 158. As is shown in FIG. 5,<br>
the pneumatic cylinder 158 of the driver 150 may terminate in a vent chamber<br>
500. The vent chamber 500 is sized so that the seal created between the piston<br>
170 and the pneumatic cylinder 158 is broken as the piston 170 reaches the end of<br>
a predetermined stroke. Once the seal between the piston 170 and the pneumatic<br>
cylinder 158 is broken, pressurized gas escapes from the pneumatic cylinder 158<br>
and into the vent chamber 500. The injector shown in FIG. 5 is designed such that<br>
pressurized gas moving into the vent chamber 500 is free to escape the injector 10<br>
by flowing around or through the casing 219 of the dispenser 200. If desired,<br>
however, the vent chamber 500 may additionally include a fluid path (not shown)<br>
extending from the vent chamber 500, through the body 12 of the injector 10, and<br>
to the exterior surface 13 of the body 12. Such a fluid path may be desirable or<br>
necessary where more rapid venting of the pressurized gas is desired or where the<br>
design of the injector 10 does not permit pressurized gas flowing into the vent<br>
chamber 500 to escape around or through the dispenser 200.<br>
[0060] FIG. 6 illustrates yet another pressure relief mechanism that may be<br>
incorporated into a plunger assembly 124 serving as the actuator 100 of an<br>
injector 10 of the present invention. Such a pressure relief mechanism includes a<br>
fluid path 510 formed within the body 130 of the plunger 128 of the plunger<br>
assembly 124. The fluid path 510 includes a vent512 formed in the side of the<br>
plunger 128. When the vent 512 is located on the interior side of sealing member<br>
18 of the plunger assembly 124, a sealed environment is maintained within the<br>
injector 10. However, if the plunger 128 is displaced such that the vent 512 is<br>
located on the exterior side of the sealing member, fluid communication between<br>
the interior and exterior of the injector 10 is permitted. As the plunger 128 is<br>
depressed and the microcylinder 52 is compromised, the pressurized gas escaping<br>
from the microcylinder 52 enters the fluid path 510 and acts against the plunger<br>
128, creating a displacement force sufficient to displace the plunger 128 such that<br>
the vent 512 is positioned on the exterior side of the sealing member 18.<br>
However, as long as the plunger 128 is depressed with a force equal to or greater<br>
than the displacement force resulting from the pressurized gas, the plunger 128<br>
will not be displaced and fluid communication between the interior of the injector<br>
10 and the exterior environment will be prevented. Once the plunger 128 is<br>
released, however, such as at the end of the delivery cycle, the plunger 128 will be<br>
displaced such that the vent 512 is positioned on the exterior side of the sealing<br>
element 18 and pressurized gas contained within the injector 10 will exit the<br>
injector 10 through the plunger 128.<br>
[0061] Where, the injector 10 includes a safety mechanism 20, the safety<br>
mechanism 20 may be designed to help ensure proper functioning of the pressure<br>
relief mechanism shown in FIG. 6. For instance, as shown in FIG. 6, the width of<br>
the slot 30 included in the first portion 22 of the safety mechanism 20 is smaller<br>
than the width of the body 130 of the plunger 128. Thus, when the safety<br>
mechanism 20 is moved out of the safe position, the plunger 128 can not be<br>
displaced to such an extent that the vent 512 formed in the plunger 128 is<br>
positioned on the exterior side of the sealing member 18. However, as the safety<br>
mechanism 20 moves back into the safe position, the slot 30 opens into port 31,<br>
which is sized to allow the body 130 of the plunger 128 to be displaced such that<br>
the orifice 512 is positioned on the exterior side of the sealing member 18.<br>
Moreover, the stop 32 of the safety mechanism 20 may include a lip 33, which<br>
prevents the plunger 128 from being entirely expelled from the passageway 126 of<br>
the plunger mechanism 124. Thus, the injector 10 of the present invention may<br>
include a safety mechanism 20 which not only minimizes the possibility of<br>
accidentally firing the injector 10, but which also works in concert with a venting<br>
mechanism to ensure that pressurized gas is properly vented from the injector 10.<br>
[0062] Significantly, the driver 150 and dispenser 200 of the injector 10 of the<br>
present invention need not be separate devices. As shown in FIG. 23 and FIG. 24,<br>
the dispenser 200 may incorporate the driver to simplify construction of injector<br>
10. In such an instance, the reservoir 210, such as a syringe 211, of the dispenser<br>
200 serves as at least a portion of the pneumatic cylinder of the driver, and the<br>
piston 270 of the dispenser 200 may be designed as a single stage piston 156 or a<br>
multistage piston 170 that acts directly against medicament 220 contained within<br>
the reservoir 210. As it reduces the size of the injector 10 and decreases the<br>
amount of materials used to manufacture the injector 10, incorporating the driver<br>
within the dispenser 200 provides a more economical and portable device. Where<br>
the driver and dispenser 200 are integrated, however, the cross-sectional diameter<br>
of the piston 156,170 is limited to the maximum interior diameter of the reservoir<br>
210. Though the injectors 10 illustrated in FIG. 23 and FIG. 24 do not include a<br>
pressure regulator or a restrictor, if desired, injectors 10 including an integrated<br>
driver and dispenser 200 may be provided with a pressure regulator or restrictor,<br>
such as those already described.<br>
[0063] In addition, the injector of the present invention may be designed for a<br>
single use or for multiple uses. Where the injector is designed for a single use,<br>
each of the components of the injector are designed to be disposed after a single<br>
use and may be permanently integrated into a single housing. However, where the<br>
injector of the present invention is designed as a multiple use injector, at least one<br>
of the components of the injector is designed for repetitive use. Regardless of<br>
whether or not the actuator and driver a multiple use injector of the present<br>
invention are designed as discrete devices, both the pressurized gas source and the<br>
dispenser of a multi-use injector according to the present invention will are<br>
preferably be designed as modular components. Such a design facilitates the easy<br>
attachment and detachment of the pressurized gas source and the dispenser to and<br>
from the actuator or the driver of the injector.<br>
[0064J The injector of the present invention is desirable because the design of<br>
the injector is flexible, allowing the injector of the present invention to be<br>
designed to deliver medicaments exhibiting a wide range of viscosities. In<br>
particular, the injector of the present invention is well suited for the delivery of<br>
viscous medicaments and may be designed to deliver viscous medicaments having<br>
viscosities of 1 Poise or greater, 10 Poise or greater, 20 Poise or greater, 50 Poise<br>
or greater, or even 100 Poise or greater. Generally, the injector of the present<br>
invention will be configured to exert an injection force ranging from about 5 lbs.<br>
to about 200 lbs. However, the design of the injector of the present invention is<br>
not limited to an injector providing an injection force falling within the range of<br>
between about 5 lbs. and 200 lbs. The injector of the present invention may be<br>
configured to exert any desired injection force tailored to ensure delivery of a<br>
desired dose of a chosen medicament within a desired amount of time.<br>
[0065] The Hagen-Poiseuille Law may be used to determine the injection<br>
force required to deliver a desired dose of a chosen medicament within a<br>
predetermined amount of time. For example, in order to deliver 0.5 cc of a<br>
medicament having a viscosity of 200 Poise within 10 seconds via a syringe<br>
having an internal diameter of 4.5 mm and a 0.5 inch needle having an internal<br>
diameter of 0.012 inches (a 24 gauge needle), the Hagen-Poiseuille Law indicates<br>
that an injection force of approximately 100 pounds is required. Such a force<br>
determination maybe undertaken for any dose of any chosen medicament that is to<br>
be delivered through a chosen syringe and needle. As is easily appreciated, even<br>
when the viscosity of the medicament remains constant, adjusting one or more of<br>
the variables represented in the Hagen-Poiseuille Law will result in a different<br>
required injection force. Therefore, even where the rheological properties of the<br>
medicament to be delivered remain the same, greater or lesser injection forces<br>
may be needed, depending on, for example, the desire delivery time, the length<br>
and gauge of the needle to be used, and the diameter of the syringe or other<br>
reservoir used to contain the medicament before it is expelled through the needle.<br>
[0066] Once the desired injection force is determined, the various components<br>
of the injector of the present invention may be adapted to generate a desired force,<br>
forces, or force profile. As can be appreciated from the foregoing description, the<br>
pressurized gas source and driver of the injector of the present invention can be<br>
configured to achieve a desired force, forces, or force profile. For example, a<br>
pressure of 197 psi can be achieved within a pneumatic cylinder having an<br>
internal diameter of 0.75 inches and an internal length of 2.50 inches by providing<br>
the injector of the present invention with a commercially available microcylinder<br>
having internal measuring 0.35 inches x 1.50 inches and containing gas stored at<br>
1,750 psi. As the internal diameter of the pneumatic cylinder equals 0.75 inches,<br>
the injection stage of a single stage or multistage piston included within the driver<br>
would also measure 0.75 inches, resulting in the generation of an injection force<br>
of 87 lbs. Additionally, if a pressure of 197 psi is produced within the pneumatic<br>
cylinder, providing a the driver with a multistage piston having an insertion stage<br>
measuring 0.20 inches in diameter would result in the generation of an insertion<br>
force of 6 lbs. If substantially constant insertion or injection forces are required or<br>
desired, the injector of the present invention may be configured to include a<br>
pressure regulator or restrictor, such as those already described herein. Although<br>
the injector of the present invention is preferably configured to generate injection<br>
forces ranging between about 5 lbs. and about 120 lbs., and, where desired, to<br>
provide insertion forces or effective insertion ranging between about 1 lbs. and 7<br>
lbs., the injector of the present invention is not limited to such configurations and<br>
may be designed to provide desired injection or insertion forces falling outside<br>
those presently preferred ranges.<br>
[0067] In addition, the injector of the present invention is desirable because<br>
the drive mechanism of the injector is relatively simple and operates relatively<br>
quietly, without the transmission of significant impact or recoil forces. Where the<br>
injector of the present invention includes a multistage driver, the injector of the<br>
present invention is capable of generating insertion and injection forces using a<br>
single driving mechanism. Moreover, the specifications and configuration of the<br>
pressurized gas source and driver of the injector of the present are easily adjusted<br>
to provide insertion forces that minimize subject discomfort, while providing<br>
injection forces that maximize delivery efficiency of even highly viscous<br>
medicaments. Even where the injector of the present invention includes a single<br>
stage driver, the injector of the present invention may be designed to generate an<br>
injection force suitable for delivering a desired dose of a chosen medicament,<br>
while providing an effective insertion force tailored to minimize subject<br>
discomfort. Due to the simplicity of the pneumatic driving mechanism used in the<br>
injector of the present invention, moving parts within the injector are limited and<br>
operate relatively unobtrusively, allowing the injector of the present invention to<br>
function without generating excess noise or transmitting significant impact or<br>
recoil forces.<br>
[0068] The components of the injector of the present invention may be<br>
manufactured using any suitable materials and known manufacturing processes.<br>
For example, known metals, metal alloys, composites, or natural or synthetic<br>
rubber or polymer materials may be used to fabricate the dispenser, the driver, the<br>
actuator, and, where included in the pressurized gas source, the cap. Moreover,<br>
suitable glass materials may be used in the fabrication of one or more components<br>
of the dispenser. Such materials may be molded, machined, cast, or formed<br>
through other suitable manufacturing process to produce components of desired<br>
shape and size. Specific materials that may be used to fabricate one or more of<br>
the various components and subcomponents of the injector of the present<br>
invention include, for example, aluminum and aluminum alloys, stainless steel,<br>
such as 304 or 316 stainless steel, glass reinforced nylon, liquid crystal polymer<br>
(LCP), PEEK polymer, and Delryn polymer. Of particular use in fabricating the<br>
reservoir and casing of the dispenser of the injector of the present invention are<br>
304 stainless steel, 316 stainless steel, LCP, and PEEK polymer. However, as will<br>
be appreciated by those of skill in the art, the injector of the present invention may<br>
be fabricated using any material and manufacturing process providing an injector<br>
capable of withstanding the anticipated operational stresses of an injector designed<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
[0069] The present invention also includes a method of injecting viscous<br>
medicaments. In each of its embodiments, the method of the present invention<br>
includes providing a medicament, providing a needle of a desired gauge, inserting<br>
the needle into the tissue of the subject, and generating an injection force<br>
sufficient to drive the viscous medicament through the needle and into the tissue<br>
of the subject. Preferably, the medicament provided in the method of the present<br>
invention is a viscous medicament (i.e., a medicament having a viscosity greater<br>
than 1 Poise). Even more preferably, the method of the present invention includes<br>
providing a medicament having a viscosity of 10 Poise or greater, 20 Poise or<br>
greater, 50 Poise or greater, or 100 Poise or greater. Though the medicament<br>
provided in the method of the present invention is preferably a viscous<br>
medicament, the method of the present invention is not so limited and may include<br>
providing a medicament exhibiting a viscosity below 1 Poise.<br>
[0070] Because the comfort of the subject generally increases as the gauge of<br>
the needle decreases (i.e., the inner diameter of the needle decreases), the needle<br>
provided in the method of the present invention preferably has a gauge ranging<br>
between 21 gauge and 31 gauge. Even more preferably, the gauge of the needle<br>
provided in the method of present invention ranges between 24 gauge and 31<br>
gauge, and most preferably, the gauge of the needle provided in the method of the<br>
present invention ranges between 27 and 31 gauge. However, such needle gauge<br>
ranges are simply presently preferred ranges. The gauge of the needle used in the<br>
method of the present invention will vary depending on, for example, the viscosity<br>
of the medicament to be injected, the nature of the subject, the tissue of the subject<br>
where the injection will take place, the injection force generated, and the desired<br>
time for injection. Therefore, the gauge and length of the needle used in the<br>
method of the present invention may vary with the desired application.<br>
[0071] Further, the injection force generated in the method of the present<br>
invention is sufficient to deliver a desired dose of the provided medicament within<br>
a suitable amount of time. Preferably, the injection force is sufficient to deliver a<br>
desired dose of the provided medicament within 10 seconds. Even more<br>
preferably, the injection force generated in the method of the present invention is<br>
sufficient to deliver a desired dose of the provided medicament within 5 seconds.<br>
In order to accomplish delivery of a desired dose of the provided medicament<br>
within the presently preferred times, the injection force generated in the method of<br>
the present invention will generally range between about 5 lbs. and 200 lbs.<br>
However, as is true of each of the other aspects of the method of the present<br>
invention, the magnitude of the injection force generated in the method of the<br>
present invention is variable and will depend on, for example, the dispenser<br>
provided, the medicament provided and the dose of the medicament to be<br>
delivered. The injection force generated in the method of the present invention<br>
need only be of sufficient magnitude to deliver a desired dose of the provided<br>
medicament within a suitable amount of time. Thus, depending upon the<br>
application, the injection force generated in the method of the present invention<br>
may be lower than 5 lbs. or higher than 200 lbs. Moreover, the method of the<br>
present invention is not limited to the generation of injection forces sufficient to<br>
deliver a desired dose of the provided medicament within the presently preferred<br>
amounts of time.<br>
[0072] In another embodiment, the method of the present invention further<br>
includes providing an insertion force or an effective insertion force, which is less<br>
than the injection force and may be tailored to minimize subject discomfort as the<br>
needle is inserted into the tissue of the subject. For example, where the intended<br>
subject is human and the gauge of the needle provided ranges from between 21<br>
gauge and 31 gauge, an insertion force of between about 1 pound and 7 pounds is<br>
presently preferred, with an injection force of between about 1 and 4 pounds being<br>
even more preferable. However, the magnitude of an insertion generated in the<br>
method of the present invention may vary according to several factors, such as the<br>
anticipated subject, the gauge of the needle to be inserted into the tissue of the<br>
subject, and the desired avenue of injection (e.g., subcutaneous, intramuscular, or<br>
intra-articular. Further, where the method of the present invention includes<br>
providing an insertion force, both the injection force and the insertion force are<br>
preferably generated using a single drive mechanism.<br>
(0073] In each of its embodiments, the method of the present invention may<br>
further include providing an injector of the present invention. For example, FIG.<br>
26 through FIG. 29 illustrate one embodiment of the method of the present<br>
invention carried out with an injector according to the present invention. FIG. 26<br>
illustrates the injector providing a needle 250 and a medicament placed against the<br>
tissue 600 of a subject. As shown in FIG. 27, actuation of the actuator 100 causes<br>
pressurized gas from the microcylinder 52 to the driver 150, and as pressurized<br>
gas acts against the insertion stage 172 of the multistage piston 170, an insertion<br>
force is generated, which drives the syringe 211 and needle 250 against the bias<br>
mechanism 280 and into the tissue 600 of the subject. Once the seal formed<br>
between the insertion stage 172 and the wall 174 of the first chamber 167 of the<br>
pneumatic cylinder 158 breaks, pressurized gas acts against the injection stage 162<br>
of the multistage piston 170, providing an injection force. The injection force is<br>
greater than the insertion force and is transmitted to the plunger 270 of the syringe<br>
211. As the multistage piston 170 is driven through the second chamber 168 of<br>
the pneumatic cylinder 158 with the injection force, the plunger 270 drives a<br>
desired dose of medicament 220 from the syringe 211 and into the tissue 600 of<br>
the subject (shown in FIG. 28). Preferably, once a desired amount of medicament<br>
220 is delivered, the forward progress of the multistage piston 154 terminates and<br>
the pressure within the pneumatic cylinder 152 dissipates. As the pressure within<br>
the pneumatic cylinder 152 dissipates, the force transmitted by the multistage<br>
piston 170 to plunger 270 also dissipates and becomes incapable of overcoming<br>
the bias force exerted by the biasing mechanism 280. As the force exerted by the<br>
multistage piston is not longer equal to or greater than the bias force exerted by<br>
the bias mechanism 280, the syringe 211 and needle 250 are automatically<br>
retracted by the bias mechanism 280 into the casing 219 of the dispenser 200<br>
(shown in FIG. 29).<br>
[0074] The embodiment of the method of the present invention illustrated in<br>
FIG. 26 through FIG. 29, however, is merely exemplary and does not limit the<br>
scope of the method of the present invention. In particular, the method of the<br>
present invention is not limited to providing the injector illustrated in FIG. 26<br>
through FIG. 29. Any injector of the present invention may be used to carry out<br>
one or more embodiments of the method of the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
[0075J FIG. 25 provides a graph illustrating that the forces exerted by the<br>
injector of the present invention may be adjusted simply by altering the pressure<br>
generated within the pneumatic cylinder of the driver of the injector or by altering<br>
the surface area of the piston included within the driver. As can be appreciated by<br>
reference to the graph, where a given pressure is generated, the forces exerted by<br>
the piston increase as the diameter of the piston increases and decrease as the<br>
diameter of the piston decreases. In addition, where a piston of a given diameter<br>
is provided, the forces exerted by the piston increase as the pressure within the<br>
pneumatic cylinder increases and decrease as the pressure within the pneumatic<br>
cylinder decreases. Therefore, the information graphed in FIG. 25 illustrates that<br>
the force, forces, or force profiles exerted by the driver of an injector of the<br>
present invention may tailored to suit one or more desired applications simply by<br>
altering the pressure generated within the pneumatic cylinder of the driver or by<br>
altering the surface area of the insertion or injection stages included in the<br>
multistage or single stage piston provided within the pneumatic piston.<br>
Example 2<br>
[0076J An injector according to the present invention was tested to determine<br>
the injection time required to deliver a material of chosen viscosity through<br>
needles having different gauges. The injector used in the tests utilized a<br>
pressurized gas source including a commercially available 12 gram sealed<br>
microcylinder that was filled with 0.2 grams of nitrogen at 1,750 psi. The actuator<br>
of the injector included a piercing mechanism, and threading a cap containing the<br>
sealed microcylinder onto the body of the injector such that the seal of the<br>
microcylinder was compromised by the piercing mechanism actuated the injector.<br>
The injector included a restrictor formed of a plate having an orifice measuring<br>
0.0015 inches in diameter, and the restrictor was positioned between the piercing<br>
mechanism of the actuator and the driver of the injector. The driver of the injector<br>
was a multistage driver including a pneumatic cylinder having first and second<br>
chambers and a multistage piston including an insertion stage and an injection<br>
stage. The pneumatic cylinder was 2.50 inches in length and had a maximum<br>
internal diameter of 0.75 inches. The insertion stage of the multistage piston<br>
measured 0.2 inches in diameter, and the injection stage of the multistage piston<br>
measured 0.75 inches in diameter. Upon actuation of the injector, the multistage<br>
driver generated an insertion force of about 6 lbs. and an injection force of about<br>
84 lbs.<br>
[0077] In each test the injector was provided with a dispenser having a sleeve<br>
and syringe cartridge as illustrated in FIG. 14 and 15. In each test the syringe of<br>
the syringe cartridge was pre-filled with 0.5 cc of a non-Newtonian formulation<br>
having a static viscosity of about 1,000 Poise and a dynamic viscosity of about<br>
200 Poise as measured at a 1.0 sec-1 shear rate and 25°C using a Haake<br>
Rheometer. However, the syringe cartridge provided in the first test included a<br>
0.5 inch 24 gauge needle, while the syringe cartridge provided in the second test<br>
included a 0.5 inch 27 gauge needle. Before each test, the formulation was heated<br>
to between about 41° C. and 43° C.<br>
[0078] The results of the tests are provided in Table 1. As can be interpreted<br>
from Table 1, the gauge of the needle directly affects the time required to deliver a<br>
chosen formulation, all else being the same. However, in each test the desired<br>
amount of the chosen formulation was delivered well within 10 seconds.<br>
Moreover, in each test the injector produced very little noise and did not transmit<br>
noticeable impact or recoil forces.<br>
