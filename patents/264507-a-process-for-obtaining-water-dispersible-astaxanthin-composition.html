				<td>Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of water dispersible<br>
astaxanthin  composition.   The  composition  produces   red   colour  in  aqueous<br>
medium.<br>
Background of invention and Description of Prior Art<br>
Astaxanthin is a ketocarotenoid (3,3'-dihydroxy ß ,ß carotene- 4, 4'   dione)   used<br>
extensively in  farmed salmon,   trout  and   poultry  as pigmentation   source. The<br>
green alga Haematococcus is one of the natural sources which accumulate<br>
astaxanthin upto 2-3% of dry biomass. The organism has gained commercial<br>
importance owing to its high content of astaxanthin.   The interest in the human<br>
health application of astaxanthin is increasing as it has been approved by FDA as<br>
dietary supplement.<br>
Its high antioxidant activity implied many nutraceutical and pharmaceutical applications. The biological functions of astaxanthin include protection against oxidation of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids, protection against UV light effects, immune response, pigmentation. (Lorenz, R.T. and Cysewski, G.R., 2000. Commercial potential for Haematococcus microalgae as a natural source of astaxanthin. Trends in Biotechnology. 18,160-167). Like majority of carotenoids, astaxanthin is water-insoluble. Hence cannot be used as food colourant in aqueous medium and requires a chemical system to overcome the problem.<br><br>
Therefore the present invention was aimed at preparation of astaxanthin containing composition which could be used as nutraceutical as well as colourant in the aqueous medium.<br>
In the present invention astaxanthin is obtained from Haematococcus pluvialis SAG 19-1 a. The culture was obtained from Sammlung von Algenkulturen, Pflanzen Physiologisches Institut, Universitat Gbttingen, Gottingen, Germany. Astaxanthin constitutes 85-90% of total carotenoids in this organism.<br>
Procedures currently reported for preparation of water soluble carotenoid composition are as follows:<br>
Reference may be made to the method of Lockwood et al 2003 (Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences, 92, 922-926; Improved Aqueous solubility of Crystalline astaxanthin by Captisol (Sulfobutyl Ether ß-cyclodextrin) wherein ß-cyclodextrin was used to increase the aqueous solubility of astaxanthin. The limitation in this method is that the solubility of astaxanthin is very low that it cannot be used as food colorant.<br>
Reference may be made to US patent 6132790 wherein carotenoid composition is reported. Carotenoid composition comprising a carotenoid in an oil solvent, dispersion of a water dispersible matrix and a stabilizer is reported. The limitation in this method is that the carotenoid emulsion is held at 75°C which is not suitable for heat labile carotenoids.<br><br>
Reference may be made to US patent 0169999 wherein process for production of water-dispersible formulation containing carotenoids is reported. The limitation in this method is that the carotenoid emulsion is treated at 130°C which is not suitable for heat labile carotenoids.<br>
Reference may be made to US patent 6261622 wherein water-dispersible carotenoid pigment preparation is reported. Water-dispersible carotenoid pigment preparation, prepared by blending the carotenoid pigment and the dispersion stability containing the soybean extract fiber as an ingredient is reported. The limitation in this method is that the preparation is a carotenoid-containing aqueous composition.<br>
Reference may be made to US patent 5364563 wherein powdered aqueous carotenoid dispersions is reported. It describes a process for producing a powdered carotenoid preparation comprising forming a suspension of a carotenoid in high boiling oil without the presence of an organic solvent. The suspension is superheated with steam for maximum period of thirty seconds to form a solution of carotenoid in oil. After that, solution is emulsified in an aqueous solution of a colloid and thereafter spraying and drying the emulsion, a powder is formed. The limitation in this method is that losses of carotenoids at high temperatures used during the treatment with superheated steam.<br><br>
Reference may be made to US patent 4726955 wherein process for the preparation of a finely divided, pulverulent carotenoid preparation is reported. It describes dissolving a carotenoid in a volatile, water-miscible, organic solvent at 50°C to 240°C, under atmospheric or super atmospheric pressure, in less than 10 seconds, immediately precipitating the carotenoid in colloidal disperse form from the resulting molecular disperse solution by rapidly mixing with an aqueous dispersion of a colloid at 0°C to 50°C and freeing the resulting dispersion from the solvent and the dispersing medium in a conventional manner. The limitation in this method is that the colour of the precipitated carotenoid colloidal disperse will differ considerably when compared to the original colour of the carotenoid.<br>
Reference may be made to US 0156871 wherein water-soluble compositions of bioactive lipophilic compounds is reported. It describes water-soluble composition, comprising a solubilizing agent. The limitation in this method is that the preparation includes antibiotics and solubilizing agents and it is meant for therapeutic purpose and not for food applications.<br>
Reference may be made to US 5811609 wherein process for the preparation of a water dispersible carotenoid preparation in powder form is reported. It describes preparation of a water dispersible carotenoid preparation in the form of discrete carotenoid microparticles comprising the steps of milling a carotenoid in an aqueous medium in the presence of a hydrocolloid to form a suspension, heating the suspension formed by the milling to a temperature sufficiently high to cause a<br><br>
total or partial melting of the carotenoid, subsequently cooling the suspension, and finely dividing and drying the suspension to form a powder. The limitation in this method is that the carotenoid emulsion is held at 150°C to 200°C which is not suitable for heat labile carotenoids.<br>
Reference may be made to US patent 5,968,251 wherein production of carotenoid preparations in the form of coldwater-dispersible powders, and the use of the novel carotenoid preparations is reported for synthetic carotenoids. It describes preparing a molecular-disperse solution of a carotenoid. The carotenoid results as nanodisperse phase in the aqueous phase. The limitation in this method is that the carotenoid emulsion is for synthetic carotenoids which exists mainly (75%) as trans forms while natural carotenoids exists as mixture of cis and trans forms. .<br>
Reference may be made to European patent 1455598 wherein carotenoid formulation is reported. It discloses the use of a lycopene coated with a water non-soluble thin film comprising amphiphilic protein polymer for coloring with red color, foods, pharmaceuticals or cosmetics.

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of water dispersible astaxanthin composition. Astaxanthin is a ketocarotenoid which is known to have high antioxidant activity. Owing to this property its potential in nutraceutical and pharmaceutical applications is increasing. However its lipophilic property limits its application in food formulations of aqueous nature. Therefore the present invention<br><br>
focused on a process for water dispersible astaxanthin to increase its scope of application and to utilize its beneficial effects to a maximum extent.<br>
The invention involved preparation of astaxanthin extracted from encysted cells of Haematococcus pluvialis SAG 19-1 a in food grade organic solvents such as dichloromethane for solubilizing the astaxanthin followed by addition of edible matrix with stabilizer and homogenization of the mixture and evaporation of organic solvent followed by drying the mixture.<br>
The present invention provides a process for the preparation of water dispersible astaxanthin composition, wherein the process steps comprise:<br>
a)	dissolving of astaxanthin obtained from Haematococcus cells in food grade organic solvent selected from acetone, dichloromethane, isobutyl acetate, n-butyl alcohol, heptane, iso-amyl alcohol in a ratio of 1 to 0.5 to 1.0 under nitrogen gas in dim light (to prevent oxidation of the compound due to exposure to light and air);<br>
b)	Mixing of astaxanthin in organic solvent to edible matrix selected from edible starch, Maltodextrin, cyclodextrin dissolved in hot water in the concentration ratio of 10:1 to 12:1 at 40-60°C with stabilizer selected from gum acacia, ascorbic acid and citric acid in the concentration range of 0.5% to 2.0%;<br>
c)	The viscous mixture thus obtained was homogenized with ultrasonic homogenizer for 5 sec.   The solvent was evaporated by known vacuum<br><br>
distillation and the aqueous layer was dried at 45°C. The resulting dry composition can be used as astaxanthin water dispersible preparation (as food colorant) especially in jellies, fruit juices, milk shakes, dairy products etc. The preparation is found to be stable for long time at low temperatures. The water dispersible astaxanthin thus obtained consisted of astaxanthin in the concentration range of 6.1-7.5%, maltodextrin 84-86%, gum acacia 08-1.2%, ascorbic acidO.9-1.2%, citric acid 4.0-4.9%.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the solvent for making carotenoid composition may be selected from acetone, dichloromethane, isobutyl acetate, n-butyl alcohol, heptane, iso-amyl alcohol.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the edible matrix may be selected from starch, dextrin, maltodextrin. p-cyclodextrin.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the stabilizing agent incorporated at 0.5-2.0% level.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, evaporating the solvent by vacuum distillation.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the stabilizing agent is preferably gum acacia, ascorbic acid and citric acid.<br><br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, drying the water content at 40-50°C.<br>
The novelty of the invention is that the astaxanthin composition is easily dispersible in aqueous phase, therefore can be used as food colorant. Another advantage is that the process does not involve heating at high temperature which is undesirable for heat labile astaxanthin. Yet another advantage is that food grade solvents can be used for in the process hence considered safe. Yet another advantage is that the astaxanthin composition adds nutraceutical value to the food since astaxanthin has very high antioxidant activity.<br>
