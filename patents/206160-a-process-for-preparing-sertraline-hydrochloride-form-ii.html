NHCH3<br><br><br>
is approved, under the trademark Zoloft®, by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for the treatment of depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder. U.S. Patent No. 4,536,518 ("the '518 patent") describes the preparation of sertraline hydrochloride with a melting point of 243-245oC by treating an ethyl acetate/ether solution of the free base with gaseous hydrogen chloride. The solid state properties of the sertraline hydrochloride so produced are not otherwise disclosed. <br>
 According to U.S. Patent No. 5,248,699 ("the '699 patent"), the sertraline hydrochloride produced by the method of the '518 patent has a crystalline form denominated "Form II." The '699 patent discloses four other polymorphs designated Forms I, III, IV, and V.          The present invention includes new polymorphic forms of sertraline hydrochloride. Polymorphic forms of a compound can be distinguished in a laboratory by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy and by other methods such as, infrared spectrometry It is desirable to investigate all solid state forms of a drug, including all polymorphic forms, and to determine the stability, dissolution and flow properties of each polymorphic form.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides; processes for preparing sertraline hydrochloride Forms XI, Form XII, Form XIII, Form XIV, Form XV and Form XVI; compositions containing sertraline hydrochloride Forms XI-XVI; methods of using sertraline hydrochloride Forms XI-XVI to prepare other forms of sertraline hydrochloride and methods of using sertraline hydrochloride Forms XI-XVI to treat depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder. Sertraline Hydrochloride Form XI<br>
One embodiment of the present invention provides the sertraline hydrochloride Form XI. Sertraline hydrochloride Form XI is a benzyl alcohol hemi-solvate of formula I:<br><br>
The invention further provides a method of obtaining sertraline hydrochloride Form XI by crystallization of sertraline hydrochloride from benzyl alcohol. Although benzyl alcohol may be toxic in large quantities, its administration in dosages contemplated by the present invention is generally pharmaceutically acceptable. Benzyl alcohol is a known antimicrobial preservative and thus provides compositions containing benzyl/alcohol with improved shelf life against bacteria, mold, fungus and yeast.<br><br><br>
Sertraline hydrochloride Form XI is characterized by its powder X-ray diffraction pattern which exhibits characteristic reflections at about 6.9±0.2, 8.7±0.2, 9.7±0.2, 14.0±0.2,16.0±0.2, 17.3±0.2, 17.7±0.2, 20.3±0.2, 20.7±0.2,22.\±02,22.5±0.2, 23.0±0.2, 23.8±0.2, 24.9±0.2, and 29.2±0.2 degrees two-theta, as shown in Figure 1. The infrared absorption spectrum of sertraline hydrochloride Form XI has absorption bands at 698, 739, 750, 781, 817, 838, 886, 954, 1001, 1030, 1040, 1075, 1134, 1201, 1312, 1328, 1493, 1560, and 1595 cm'1, as shown in Figure 2.<br>
Sertraline hydrochloride Form XI is prepared by dissolving sertraline hydrochloride in benzyl alcohol. Since, by the methods of the present invention, the starting material sertraline hydrochloride is completely dissolved, any form of sertraline hydrochloride may be used, including, but not limited to sertraline hydrochloride Forms I-X, XII-XVI and amorphous sertraline hydrochloride. Preferably, the concentration of sertraline hydrochloride, after it has completely dissolved in benzyl alcohol, is about 0.5 M or greater. The concentration should not be so high that the sertraline hydrochloride does not completely dissolve in a reasonable amount of time at 100°C. To obtain the benzyl alcohol hemi-solvate, sertraline hydrochloride Form XI, the concentration should be preferably about 1M. While we have obtained sertraline hydrochloride Form XI as the benzyl alcohol hemi-solvate, higher solvates like mono-solvates, di-solvates and tri-solvates may also be obtainable by this method. Mono-solvates have a crystal structure containing one solvent molecule per molecule of sertraline hydrochloride. Di-solvates have two molecules of solvent per sertraline hydrochloride and tri-solvates have three.<br>
It may be necessary to heat the benzyl alcohol or sertraline hydrochloride/benzyl alcohol mixture in order to facilitate dissolution of sertraline hydrochloride. The preferred elevated temperature is 100°C when heating is used.<br><br>
After complete dissolution of the sertraline hydrochloride, crystallization of sertraline hydrochloride Form XI may be induced by cooling from the elevated temperature. In order to produce homogeneous solvate crystals, crystal growth should be slow and so the cooling likewise should be conducted slowly. To produce the sertraline hydrochloride Form XI hemi-solvate selectively and homogeneously, the solution is preferably cooled at a rate of about 38°C h-1 or less. When the preferred concentration range is used, cooling to about room temperature should produce the solvate in good yield without any further cooling being required. The choice to further cool the solution is within the province of one of ordinary skill in the art informed by this disclosure.<br>
The resulting crystals may be isolated by any method known to the art, such as by decanting the benzyl alcohol off the crystals or by filtration. Evaporation is also a suitable way to remove excess alcohol although heating of the crystals under high vacuum may be required to remove unsolvated benzyl alcohol by evaporation. Filtration is the preferred method of isolation. Residual solvent can be removed by vacuum filtration by allowing the isolated crystals to remain on the filter paper or sintered glass, whichever the case may be, for several minutes with heating and/or by rinsing with a volatile solvent in which benzyl alcohol is soluble but sertraline hydrochloride Form XI is not.<br>
The novel Form XI of sertraline hydrochloride is useful as an intermediate in the preparation of sertraline hydrochloride Form X. By the methods of the present invention, sertraline hydrochloride Form XI is heated under vacuum for a sufficient amount of time to transform sertraline hydrochloride Form XI to sertraline hydrochloride Form X. The completeness of the transformation can be determined by sampling the material. Preferably, sertraline hydrochloride Form XI is heated to about 80 °C, for about 24 h, which consistently results in the complete conversion to sertraline hydrochloride Form X<br><br>
As described in more detail in commonly-assigned, co-pending U.S. application Serial No. 09/448,985 filed November 24, 1999, sertraline hydrochloride Form X is characterized by a powder X-ray diffraction pattern having principal peaks at 15.0±0.2, 16.0±0.2, 16.5±0.2, 17.0±0.2, 18.1±0.2, 21.0±0.2,22.4±0.2, 24.9±0.2, 25.4±0.2, 26.2, 27.1,28.4, and 29.0°±0.2 degrees two-theta. The IR spectrum of sertraline hydrochloride Form X is characterized by the following bands: 742, 776, 806, 824, 1002, 1017, 1028, 1060, 1079, 1135, 1218, 1314, 1336, and 1560 cm-1. The DSC of sertraline hydrochloride Form X shows a small endotherm at about 190°C followed by a melting endotherm at about 250°C.    The use of the novel sertraline hydrochloride Form XI of the present invention to prepare solutions of sertraline hydrochloride and benzyl alcohol in another solvent such as a syrup or elixir base or an ophthalmic solution or solution for injection is considered to be within the contemplated invention. Sertraline hydrochloride Form XI contains the antimicrobial agent benzyl alcohol. The use of sertraline hydrochloride Form XI in any solid state like a powder, granulate or compressed tablet, to prepare a solution containing sertraline hydrochloride and benzyl alcohol is taught by the present invention. The solid form can be dissolved in a solvent providing in one step sertraline hydrochloride as well as a preservative to increase the shelf life of the solution. Processing advantages flow from the use of sertraline hydrochloride Form XI for the preparation of a sertraline hydrochloride solution containing a preservative. Although not allowing much control of the proportion of benzyl alcohol to sertraline hydrochloride when sertraline hydrochloride Form XI is used alone, since the proportion is predetermined at 1:2 by the form itself, one skilled in the art will appreciate that the amount of alcohol can be reduced in relation to sertraline hydrochloride by using a mixture of sertraline hydrochloride Form XI and another form of sertraline hydrochloride, including, but not<br><br>
limited to sertraline hydrochloride sertraline hydrochloride Forms I-X, XII-XVI and amorphous sertraline hydrochloride, which do not contain benzyl alcohol. The advantages of adding the preservative and sertraline hydrochloride in the same step include simplifying the formulation process by omitting a separate addition step and potentially more accurately controlling the quantity of benzyl alcohol since a larger quantity of material is measured than when the preservative is added separatively. Sertraline Hydrochloride Form XII<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention provides a new form of sertraline hydrochloride designated, sertraline hydrochloride Form XII, which is a hydrated form of sertraline hydrochloride, and processes for making sertraline hydrochloride Form XII. Sertraline hydrochloride Form XII may be obtained from any of the known forms of sertraline hydrochloride. Suitable forms of sertraline hydrochloride include, but are not limited to, sertraline hydrochloride Form I, Form II, Form III, Form V and anhydrous sertraline hydrochloride. Sertraline hydrochloride Form V is the preferred starting material. Sertraline hydrochloride Form XII can be made by exposing sertraline hydrochloride to water vapors. Sertraline hydrochloride Form V is exposed to water vapor for a time sufficient for the transformation to sertraline hydrochloride Form XII. Preferably, sertraline hydrochloride Form V is exposed to water vapor for about seven days. The transformation may be monitored by x-ray powder diffraction techniques. In order to preserve sertraline hydrochloride in an uncontaminated state when exposed to water vapor for a prolonged period of time, the starting sertraline hydrochloride should be placed in a sealed chamber. Sertraline hydrochloride Form XII is characterized by its powder X-ray diffraction pattern which has characteristic reflections at about 4.3±0.2, 12.0±0.2, 13.4±0.2, 14.4±0.2, 16.3±0.2, 17.4±0.2, 19.4±0.2, 20.9±0.2, 21.4±0.2, 22.4±0.2, 23.0±0.2,23.5±0.2 and 25.3±0.2 degrees two-theta, as shown in Figure 3. Of<br>
these, the reflections at about 4.3, 12.0,13.4,16.3 and 17.4±0.2 degrees are especially characteristic.<br>
Sertraline Hydrochloride Form XIV<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention provides sertraline hydrochloride Form XIV and processes for making sertraline hydrochloride Form XIV. Sertraline hydrochloride Form XTV may be obtained by dissolving sertraline hydrochloride in methanol and a non-polar solvent, such as hexane.   Since, by the methods of the present invention, the starting material sertraline hydrochloride is completely dissolved, any form of sertraline hydrochloride may be used, including but not limited to, sertraline hydrochloride Forms I-X, XII-XVI and amorphous sertraline hydrochloride.<br>
In one preferred method of making sertraline hydrochloride Form XIV, sertraline base is initially dissolved in a mixture of methanol and hexane. Preferred conditions involve addition of sertraline base to an approximately 1:1 mixture of methanol and hexane to produce an approximately 150-200 mM solution. Depending upon the concentration and ratio of methanol to the nonpolar solvent, heating may be required to facilitate the dissolution of sertraline base. After dissolution of the base is complete, gaseous hydrogen chloride is bubbled through the solution until a pH of about 0.5 to about 1.5, more preferably about 1.0 is attained. Sertraline hydrochloride Form XIV should precipitate from the solvent over time. If the gaseous hydrogen chloride is added at elevated temperature, then the solution may be allowed to cool, or be actively cooled, to a temperature below ambient, to induce crystallization. The precipitated sertraline hydrochloride Form XTV may be separated from the solvent conventionally, as by filtration or decanting.In another embodiment of the present invention, sertraline hydrochloride Form XIV is made from sertraline hydrochloride Form II. By the method of the present<br><br>
invention, sertraline hydrochloride Form XTV is made by adding sertraline hydrochloride Form II to methanol to form a suspension. Preferably about 3 volumes of methanol are used, based on the weight of the sertraline hydrochloride Form II. However, lesser amounts of solvent will also effect the transformation, albeit in some instances more slowly. The transformation of sertraline hydrochloride Form II to sertraline hydrochloride Form XIV is accelerated by heating the suspension to an elevated temperature. The reflux temperature of methanol is suitable for accelerating the transformation sufficient that it is substantially complete in about an hour. The sertraline hydrochloride Form XIV may then be isolated conventionally, e.g., by decanting or filtering.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, sertraline hydrochloride Form XIV is useful for preparing sertraline hydrochloride Form II. This process involves transforming sertraline hydrochloride Form XIV into Form II by suspending sertraline hydrochloride Form XTV in a solvent selected from the group consisting of ethyl acetate, acetone, and t-butyl-methyl-ether to form a suspension of sertraline hydrochloride. Typical loadings range from about 5 volumes to about 20 volumes of solvent based upon the weight of sertraline hydrochloride Form XTV, more preferably about 10 volumes (herein volumes based on weight is measured in units of milliliters/gram or equivalently liters/kilogram). The transformation of sertraline hydrochloride Form XIV to sertraline hydrochloride Form II is facilitated by heating the suspension to about 25 °C to the reflux temperature of the solvent. Preferably, the suspension is heated to reflux. The suspension is heated and stirred for a time sufficient for the transformation to sertraline hydrochloride Form II to be substantially complete. Preferably, the suspension is heated for about 2 to about 3 hours. The suspension is then cooled, or is allowed to cool, to further facilitate the transformation to sertraline hydrochloride Form II. Sertraline hydrochloride Form II is isolated conventionally, e.g., by decanting or filtering.<br><br>
Sertraline hydrochloride Form XIV is characterized by a powder X-ray diffraction pattern having reflections at about 7.4±0.2, 9.6±0.2, 12.0±0.2, I2.8±0.2, 14.3±0.2, 16.0±0.2, 16.2±02,18.0±0.2,21.1±0.2,23.2±0.2,23.6±0.2,24.3±0.2, 24.9±0.2, 25.7±0.2, 26.7±0.2, 29.6±0.2 and 32.5±0.2 degrees two-theta, as shown in Figure 5. Sertraline Hydrochloride Form XIII<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention provides a new form of sertraline hydrochloride designated sertraline hydrochloride Form XIII and processes for making sertraline hydrochloride Form XIII By the methods of the present invention, sertraline hydrochloride Form XIII may be obtained by heating sertraline hydrochloride Form XIV crystals to a temperature of about 60°C for about 24 hours. The sertraline hydrochloride Form XIII obtained in this manner is characterized by a powder X-ray diffraction pattern having reflections at about 8.5±0.2,13.3±0.2,14.0±0.2, 15.3±0.2,16.3±0.2,17.5±0.2, 20.1±0.2,21.5±0.2,22.5±0.2, 23.6±0.2,25.0±0.2 and 25.9±0.2 degrees two-theta, as shown in Figure 4. Sertraline Hydrochloride Form XV<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention provides a new form of sertraline hydrochloride designated sertraline hydrochloride Form XV and processes for making sertraline hydrochloride Form XV.   By the methods of the present intention, sertraline hydrochloride Form XV may be obtained by precipitation from aqueous solutions of isopropanol with either sertraline base or sertraline hydrochloride as starring material.<br>
In one preferred process for making sertraline hydrochloride Form XV, sertraline base initially is dissolved in isopropanol with a non-polar organic compound as co-solvent to facilitate dissolution of the sertraline base. A particularly preferred solvent is a mixture of isopropanol and hexane, more preferably an approximately 1:1 mixture of isopropanol :hexane. Under these preferred conditions, sertraline hydrochloride Form XV<br><br>
can be prepared without heating, though in solvent systems having a higher proportion of isopropanol or at higher sertraline base concentrations, heating may be required to obtain complete dissolution. Either concentrated or dilute aqueous hydrochloric acid is then added to deliver at least one equivalent of chloride per equivalent of sertraline base. The use of even highly concentrated aqueous hydrochloric acid provides sufficient water to favor the precipitation of sertraline hydrochloride in Form XV. The addition of the hydrogen chloride induces precipitation of sertraline as its hydrochloride salt over a period of hours without the need for active cooling below ambient temperature. However, if heating was used to dissolve the sertraline base then cooling of the solution to ambient temperature may further induce crystallization. The precipitated crystals may then be isolated conventionally, e.g., by filtering or decanting, to yield sertraline hydrochloride Form XV.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, sertraline hydrochloride Form XV is made by the process of adding sertraline base to isopropanol to form a suspension. Preferably, the isopropanol is warmed to about 40-50°C either before or after addition of the sertraline base. Aqueous hydrochloric acid is then added to the mixture of sertraline base and isopropanol in an amount sufficient to form sertraline hydrochloride. The resulting suspension of sertraline hydrochloride is heated to facilitate dissolution of sertraline hydrochloride. Preferably the reaction is heated to about 60°C.  Water is also added during heating of the sertraline hydrochloride solution to facilitate complete dissolution. Upon complete dissolution, the mixture is stirred at room temperature for a time sufficient to induce the transformation to sertraline hydrochloride Form XV and precipitation of sertraline hydrochloride Form XV. The precipitated sertraline hydrochloride Form XV may then be isolated by conventional methods.<br><br>
Sertraline base for use in the processes of the present invention may be produced by dissolving sertraline mandelate in ethyl acetate followed by neutralization of the sertraline mandelate with aqueous sodium hydroxide. The organic phase is separated from the aqueous phase and dried using magnesium sulfate. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure to produce sertraline base as an oil. Methods for making sertraline base are set forth in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,536,518 and 5,248,699, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, sertraline hydrochloride Form XV is made from sertraline hydrochloride Form VI. Co-pending U.S. application Serial No. 09/448,985 discloses sertraline hydrochloride Form VI and processes for making sertraline hydrochloride Form VI. Sertraline hydrochloride Form VI may be made according to the following Examples 18, 19, and 20 and is characterized by a powder x-ray diffraction pattern comprising peaks at 7.3±0.2,12.1±0.2, 12.7±0.2, 14.0±0.2, 15.6 ±0.2, 17.6 ±0.2, 20.1 ±0.2, 20.6 ±0.2, 21.9±0.2, 22.7±0.2, 23.0±0.2, 23.8±0.2, 24.3±0.2, 25.4 ±0.2, and 26.3 ±0.2 degrees two-theta.<br>
By the methods of the present invention, sertraline hydrochloride Form XV may be prepared by suspending sertraline hydrochloride Form VI in aqueous isopropanol. Preferably, about 1 to about 4, more preferably about 3 volumes, of isopropanol is used based on the weight of the sertraline hydrochloride starting material. Sertraline hydrochloride Form XV is preferably prepared by recrystallization from such a suspension using a solvent system comprising isopropanol and water in a ratio of about 5:1 to about 7:1 (v/v), and more preferably about 6:1. Water may be provided by using aqueous isopropanol or by adding water to either anhydrous isopropanol or aqueous isopropanol in order to bring the water content within the afore-mentioned preferred range. The suspension is stirred for a time sufficient to facilitate the transformation of sertraline<br><br>
hydrochloride Form VI to sertraline hydrochloride Form XV. The transformation may be monitored by x-ray diffraction methods. The suspension is preferably heated to accelerate the transformation of sertraline hydrochloride Form VI to sertraline hydrochloride Form XV, the reflux temperature of isopropanol being a suitable temperature for this purpose. Sertraline hydrochloride Form XV may be isolated conventionally, e.g., by decanting or filtering, with optional washing of the crystals with isopropanol.<br>
Sertraline hydrochloride Form XV is characterized by a powder X-ray diffraction pattern having reflections at about 6.5±0.2,10.7±0.2,12.9±0.2, 14.2±0.2, 15.2±0.2, 16.6±0.2, 17.5±0.2,18,1±0.2, 19.9±0.2, 20.4±0.2 24.0±0.2 and 24.5±0.2 degrees two-theta, as shown in Figure 6.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, sertraline hydrochloride Form V can be prepared from sertraline hydrochloride Forms XIV and XV. Each of these novel forms can be transformed to sertraline hydrochloride Form V by heating crystals of the novel forms, preferably to 70°C or above, more preferably 80°C or above, for sufficient time to complete the transformation. The reaction may be monitored by powder x-ray diffraction methods. The transformation to sertraline hydrochloride Form V is substantially complete after heating sertraline hydrochloride Forms XIV or XV to 80°C for 24 hours.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, sertraline hydrochloride Form XV is useful for preparing sertraline hydrochloride Form II. This process involves transforming sertraline hydrochloride Form XV into sertraline hydrochloride Form II by suspending sertraline hydrochloride Form XV in a solvent selected from the group consisting of ethyl acetate, acetone, t-butyl-methyl-ether (MTBE) and cyclohexane. Typical loadings range from about 5 volumes to about 20 volumes of solvent based upon the weight of sertraline hydrochloride Form XV, more preferably about 10 volumes<br><br>
(herein volumes based on weight is measured in units of miliiliters/gram or equivalently liters/kilogram). The transformation of sertraline hydrochloride Form XV to sertraline hydrochloride Form II is facilitated by heating the suspension to about 25°C to the reflux temperature of the solvent. Preferably, the suspension is heated to reflux. The suspension is refluxed for a time sufficient for the transformation to sertraline hydrochloride Form II to be substantially complete. Preferably, the suspension is heated for about 2 to about 3 hours. Alternatively, the suspension may be stirred at room temperature for a time sufficient to facilitate the transformation of sertraline hydrochloride Form XV to sertraline hydrochloride Form II. Completion of the transformation may be determined by monitoring the reaction using a suitable means, e.g., x-ray powder diffraction methods. Upon conversion of sertraline hydrochloride Form XV to sertraline hydrochloride Form II, the suspension is then cooled to a temperature range of about room temperature to about 5°C to further facilitate the transformation to sertraline hydrochloride Form II. The sertraline hydrochloride Form II is isolated conventionally, e.g., by decanting or filtering. Sertraline Hydrochloride Form XVI<br>
The novel form of sertraline hydrochloride designated Form XVI and processes for preparing sertraline hydrochloride Form XVI have also been discovered. Sertraline hydrochloride Form XVI is a form of sertraline hydrochloride with low-crystallinity which can be distinguished from truly amorphous sertraline hydrochloride by the presence of broad peaks at about 15.6 and 23.G±0.2 degrees two-theta, as shown in Figure 7, and can be distinguished from other more crystalline forms by absence of the characteristic reflections of those forms. Sertraline hydrochloride Form XVI may be prepared from sertraline base by precipitation from a solution in a single component, non-aqueous, nonpolar solvent system selected from the group consisting of hexane, cyclohexane and toluene.<br><br>
According to the preferred process for obtaining sertraline hydrochloride Form XVI, sertraline base is initially dissolved in hexane, cyclohexane or toluene. About 5 to about 20 volumes of solvent, more preferably about 10 volumes, are used per weight of sertraline base. At this loading, it may be necessary to heat the suspension to an elevated temperature to facilitate the dissolution of the sertraline base in the solvent, in which case the preferred elevated temperature is from about 30 oC to the reflux temperature of the solvent, more preferably from about 40°C to the reflux temperature of the solvent. Although the formation of a clear solution is preferable, it is not strictly required since any undissolved sertraline base will go into solution as sertraline hydrochloride Form XVI precipitates as will become apparent from the following description.<br>
Gaseous hydrogen chloride is bubbled through the solution (or suspension) containing sertraline base until a pH of about 1 to about 1.5 is reached. Addition of the hydrogen chloride induces precipitation of the sertraline hydrochloride salt. Precipitation of the salt reduces the concentration of the sertraline base in solution which allows the dissolution of more of the sertraline base if any remains undissolved. Monitoring of the pH of the solution and maintenance additions of hydrogen chloride, if necessary, are recommended in such a case to maintain the pH of the solution in the preferred range. At some of the loadings recommended for practice of this method, gel formation may occur. Any gel that forms typically may be broken up so as to allow filtration or decanting, by continued stirring of the mixture. After precipitation is substantially complete the crystals may be isolated conventionally by filtering or decanting, optionally washing with solvent, to yield sertraline hydrochloride Form XVI.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, sertraline hydrochloride Form XVI is useful for preparing sertraline hydrochloride Form II. This process involves transforming sertraline hydrochloride Form XVI into sertraline hydrochloride Form II by<br><br>
suspending Form XVI in a solvent selected from ethyl acetate and acetone. Typical loadings range from about 5 volumes to about 20 volumes of solvent based upon the weight of sertraline hydrochloride, more preferably about 10 volumes (herein volumes based on weight is measured in units of milliliters/gram or equivalently liters/kilogram). Sertraline hydrochloride Form XVI is suspended for a time sufficient to induce the transformation of sertraline hydrochloride Form XVI to sertraline hydrochloride Form II The suspension may be stirred. The transformation of sertraline hydrochloride Form XVI into sertraline hydrochloride Form II is facilitated by heating, the reflux temperature of the solvents being suitable for facilitated the transformation to sertraline hydrochloride Form II sufficient that the transformation is substantially complete in about two hours. The suspension of sertraline hydrochloride Form II is then cooled or is allowed to cool, preferably to room temperature. Sertraline hydrochloride Form II is isolated conventionally, e.g., by decanting or filtering.<br>

As illustrated by the above-described use of sertraline hydrochloride Form XI with other forms to prepare syrups, elixirs and solutions, compositions of the present invention generally may contain the novel forms of the present invention alone or in mixture with other forms of sertraline hydrochloride. Such compositions may also contain a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, i.e. one or more pharmaceutical excipients.

Excipients that may also be present in a solid composition of the novel forms of sertraline hydrochloride further include disintegrants such as sodium starch glycolate, crospovidone, low-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose and others. Additional<br><br>
excipients include tableting lubricants such as magnesium and calcium stearate, sodium stearyl fumarate and polyethylene glycol; flavorings; sweeteners; preservatives; pharmaceutically acceptable dyes and glidants such as silicon dioxide.<br>

The powder X-ray spectrum of Form XVI has two broad reflections at 15.6 and 23.0 at 28.<br>
EXAMPLE 13<br>
Preparation of Sertraline Hydrochloride Form V from form XVI<br>
Sertraline Hydrochloride Form XVI crystals were heated to 80 °C for 24 h to give<br>
sertraline hydrochloride Form V.<br>
EXAMPLE 14 Preparation of Sertraline Hydrochloride Form XVI from Sertraline Base<br>
Sertraline base (5 g) was suspended in hexane (50 mL) and the suspension was<br>
heated to 40 °C to dissolve the base. The solution was then allowed to cool to 30oC and<br>
gaseous hydrochloric acid was bubbled into the solution until the pH of the solution<br>
reached about 1.5. The solution gelled while it was being acidified but remained stirrable.<br>
The gel was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. Sertraline hydrochloride Form XVI<br>
precipitated from the hexane. The hexane was removed by filtration and the residue was<br>
washed with fresh hexane. The residue was determined to be sertraline hydrochloride<br>
Form XVI.<br>
EXAMPLE 15<br>
Preparation of Sertraline Hydrochloride Form XVI from Sertraline Base<br>
Sertraline base (5.8 g) was dissolved in toluene (200 mL). Gaseous hydrochloric<br>
acid was bubbled (about pH 1.5) through the solution to induce the formation of sertraline<br>
hydrochloride Form XVI. The solution gelled while it was being acidified but remained<br><br><br>
stirrable. Filtration and drying at 50°C for 16 hours yields sertraline hydrochloride Form<br>
XVI (6.61gr.).<br>
EXAMPLE 16 Preparation of Sertraline Hydrochloride Form II from Form XVI<br>
Sertraline hydrochloride Form XVI (5 g) was suspended in ethyl acetate (50 mL)<br>
and the suspension was refluxed for 2 h. The suspension was then cooled to about 40 °C<br>
and filtered. The solid residue was found to be sertraline hydrochloride Form II.<br>
EXAMPLE 17 Preparation of Sertraline Hydrochloride Form II from Form XVI<br>
Sertraline hydrochloride Form XVI (5 g) was suspended in acetone (50 mL) and<br>
the suspension was refluxed for 2 h. The suspension was then cooled to about 40°C and<br>
filtered. The solid residue was found to be sertraline hydrochloride Form II.<br>
Example 18<br>
Preparation of Sertraline Hydrochloride ethanolate Form VI by reslurry of Form I<br>
Sertraline hydrochloride Form I (1 g) and absolute ethanol (20 mL) were stirred at<br>
room temperature for 24 hours. Filtration of the mixture yielded sertraline hydrochloride<br>
ethanolate-Form VI.<br>
Example 19<br>
Preparation of Sertraline hydrochloride ethanolate Form VI-by reslurry of Form II<br>
Sertraline hydrochloride Form II (1 g) and absolute ethanol (20 mL) were stirred at<br>
room temperature for 24 hours. Filtration of the mixture yielded sertraline hydrochloride<br>
ethanolate Form VI.<br>
                                                         Example 20                                        Preparation of Sertraline Hydrochloride ethanolate -Form VI-from Form V<br>
Sertraline hydrochloride Form V (1 g) and ethanol absolute (20 mL.) were stirred<br>
at room temperature for 24 hrs. Filtration of the mixture yielded sertraline hydrochloride<br>
ethanolate Form VI.<br>
Example 21<br>
Preparation of Sertraline Hydrochloride Form H from Form XIV<br>
Sertraline hydrochloride Form XIV (3 g) was suspended in ethyl acetate (45 mL).<br>
The suspension was heated at reflux for 2 hours to facilitate the transformation of<br>
sertraline hydrochloride Form XTV to sertraline hydrochloride Form II. The suspension<br>
was then cooled. Sertraline hydrochloride Form II was isolated by filtration.<br>
Example 22<br>
Preparation of Sertraline Hydrochloride Form II from Form XIV<br>
Sertraline hydrochloride Form XIV (3 g) was suspended in acetone (30 ml). The<br>
suspension was heated at reflux for 2 hours to facilitate the transformation of sertraline<br>
hydrochloride Form XTV to sertraline hydrochloride Form II. The suspension was then<br>
cooled.  Sertraline hydrochloride Form II was isolated by filtration.<br>
Example 23<br>
