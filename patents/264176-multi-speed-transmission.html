12 to the output shaft 14 in at least eight forward torque ratios and one reverse torque<br>
ratio as indicated in the truth table of FIG. 2. Each of the forward torque ratios and the<br>
reverse torque ratios is attained by engagement of one or more of the torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms (i.e. first intermediate clutch 80, a second intermediate clutch 82, a third<br>
intermediate clutch 84, a brake 90 and a brake 92). Those skilled in the art will readily<br>
understand that a different speed ratio is associated with each torque ratio. Thus, at least<br>
eight forward speed ratios and at least one reverse speed ratio may be attained by<br>
transmission 10. An example of the gear ratios that may be obtained using the<br>
embodiments of the present invention are also shown in FIG. 2. Of course, other gear<br>
ratios are achievable depending on the gear diameter, gear tooth count and gear<br>
configuration selected.<br>

transmission 10 of FIG. 1, as well as the connections for the clutches 80, 82, 84 and<br>
brakes 90, 92. The nodes 24A, 26A, 28A, 42A, 44A, 46A, 52A, 54A, 56A, 72A, 74A<br>
and 76A of the lever diagram 10A represent the gear members 24, 26, 28, 42, 44, 46, 52,<br>
54, 56, 72, 74 and 76 of FIG. 1 such that the same numerical designation with the<br>
addition of an A suffix is used to identify the corresponding node. For example, the<br>
nodes 24A and 42A shown in FIG. 3 represent sun gears 24 and 42 respectively shown in<br>
FIG. 1. Other components of FIG. 3 have the same numbering convention for the<br>
corresponding components in FIG. 1. Moreover, the operation or engagement of<br>
7<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: P000571-PTT-DLT<br>
clutches 80, 82, 84 and brakes 90, 92 to establish the various forward and reverse gear<br>
speeds will now be described with continuing reference to FIGS. 1, 2 and 3.<br>
[0044]	To establish the reverse torque ratio (Rev), the torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms or clutches are selected as set forth in the table of FIG. 2. As shown in FIG.<br>
2, first and second brakes 90, 92 and third intermediate clutch 84 are engaged to achieve<br>
the reverse torque ratio (Rev).<br>
[0045]	In neutral, none of the clutches or brakes are carrying torque. As noted in<br>
FIG. 2, in this gear state, the first and second brakes 90 and 92 are engaged but not<br>
carrying torque.<br>
[0046]	A first forward torque ratio (listed as 1st (first gear) in the truth table of<br>
FIG. 2), is achieved by engaging first and second brakes 90 and 92 and first intermediate<br>
clutch 80. An arrow is provided in FIG. 2 that emanates from third intermediate clutch<br>
84 that is released and points to the clutch that is engaged (clutch 80). when transitioning<br>

2, is established by engagement of first and second brakes 90, 92 and second intermediate<br>
clutch 82. The shift from first gear to second gear occurs as follows: releasing first<br>
intermediate clutch 80 and engaging second intermediate clutch 82 while maintaining<br>
engagement of brakes 90, 92. An arrow is provided in FIG. 2 that emanates from the<br>
clutch that is released (clutch 80) and points to the clutch that is engaged (clutch 82).<br>
[0048]	The subsequent torque ratio, indicated as 3rd (third gear) in the truth table<br>
of FIG. 2, is established by the engagement of second brake 92, first and second<br>
intermediate clutches 80 and 82. The shift from second gear to third gear occurs as<br>
follows: clutch 82 and brake 92 remain engaged, brake 90 is released and clutch 80 is<br>
engaged. An arrow is provided in FIG. 2 that emanates from the brake that is released<br>
(brake 90) and points to the clutch that is engaged (clutch 80).<br>
[0049]	The next subsequent forward torque ratio, indicated as 4th (fourth gear) in<br>
the truth table of FIG. 2, is established with the engagement of second brake 92. second<br>
and third intermediate clutches 82, 84. The shift from third gear to fourth gear is<br>
achieved as follows: engagement of clutch 82 and brake 92 are maintained, clutch 80 is<br>
8<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: P000571-PTT-DLT<br>
released and clutch 84 is engaged. An arrow is provided in FIG. 2 that emanates from the<br>
clutch that is released (clutch 80) and points to the clutch that is engaged (clutch 84).<br>
[0050]	A subsequent forward torque ratio indicated as 5th (fifth gear) in FIG. 2, is<br>
established with the engagement of second brake 92 and first and third intermediate<br>
clutches 80 and 84. The shift from fourth gear to fifth gear occurs as follows: the<br>
engagement of clutch 84 and second brake 92 are maintained, clutch 82 is released and<br>
clutch 80 is engaged. An arrow is provided in FIG. 2 that emanates from the clutch that<br>
is released (clutch 82) and points to the clutch that is engaged (clutch 80).<br>
[0051]	A subsequent forward torque ratio indicated as 6tn (sixth gear), in the truth<br>
table of FIG. 2, is established with the engagement of first, second and third intermediate<br>
clutches 80, 82 and 84. The shift from fifth gear to sixth gear occurs as follows: the<br>
engagement of clutches 80 and 84 are maintained, brake 92 is released and clutch 82 is<br>
engaged. An arrow is provided in FIG. 2 that emanates from the brake that is released<br>
(brake 92) and points to the clutch that is engaged (clutch 82).<br>
[0052]	The next subsequent torque ratio, indicated as 7th (seventh gear) in the<br>
truth table of FIG. 2, is established with the engagement of brake 90 and first and third<br>
intermediate clutches 80, 84. The shift from sixth gear to seventh gear occurs as follows:<br>
the engagement of clutches 80 and 84 are maintained, clutch 82 is released and brake 90<br>
is engaged. An arrow is provided in FIG. 2 that emanates from the clutch that is released<br>
(clutch 82) and points to the brake that is engaged (brake 90).<br>
[0053]	The next subsequent torque ratio, indicated as 8th (eight gear) in the truth<br>
table of FIG. 2, is established with the engagement of brake 90 and second and third<br>
intermediate clutches 82, 84. The shift from seventh gear to eighth gear occurs as<br>
follows: the engagement of clutch 84 and brake 90 are maintained, clutch 80 is released<br>
and clutch 82 is engaged. An arrow is provided in FIG. 2 that emanates from the clutch<br>
that is released (clutch 80) and points to the clutch that is engaged (clutch 82).<br>
[0054]	The present invention contemplates that downshifts follow the reverse<br>
sequence of the corresponding upshift (as described above), and several power-on skip-<br>
shifts that are single-transition are possible (e.g. from 1st to 3rd).<br>
[0055]	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described<br>
in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br>
