Technical Field<br>
[ 1 ]	The present invention relates to a battery safety device adapted to form an<br>
electrical circuit and convert a charged state of the battery to a discharged state when<br>
compressed by a predetermined pressure or higher. Also, the present invention relates<br>
to a battery having the safety device.	<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	As recent electronic appliances rapidly become wireless and portable, a non-<br>
aqueous electrolyte secondary battery having large capacity and high energy density<br>
has been developed as their driving power source. However, such a non-aqueous<br>
electrolyte secondary battery is exposed to danger in that, when a strong external<br>
pressure or an external impact caused by a nail or nipper is applied, the interior of the<br>
cell is damaged and the cell may ignite or explode.<br>
[3]	In particular, since the positive electrode active material is sensitive to voltage, the<br>
reactivity between the positive electrode and the electrolyte increases aS the battery is<br>
charged and the voltage rises. The surface of the positive electrode then decomposes<br>
and oxidation reaction occurs to the electrolyte. This increases the danger of fire or<br>
explosion.<br>
[4]	Such a safety problem becomes more important as the battery, specifically the non-<br>
aqueous electrolyte secondary battery (for example, lithium secondary battery), has<br>
larger capacity and higher energy density.		<br>
Disclosure<br>
[5]	The present invention is directed to that substantially obviates one or more<br>
problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.<br>
[6]	It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for lowering the<br>
charged state of a cell before it is damaged by an external impact caused by a pressure,<br>
a nail or a nipper by positioning a safety device inside or outside the cell so that the<br>
battery is safe from the external impact<br><br>
[7] To achieve this object and other advantages in accordance with the purpose of the<br>
invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, there is provided a battery comprising<br>
an electrode assembly and a safety device on and positioned outside of the electrode<br>
assembly, wherein the safety device is adapted to form an electrical circuit when a<br>
predetermined pressure or higher is applied to both of the electrode assembly and the safety<br>
device and convert state of charge of the electrode assembly to a discharged state, wherein<br>
the safety device has a first metal plate, a PSCF (pressure-sensitive conducting film), and a<br>
second metal plate, which are in contact with each other, and wherein the safety device is<br>
adapted to discharge the electrode assembly within 60 seconds when a predetermined<br>
pressure or higher is applied to the safety device and the first and second metal plates are<br>
directly electrically connected in parallel to positive and negative electrodes, respectively.<br>
[8] According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a safety<br>
device for a battery, comprising a first metal plate, a pressure-sensitive conducting film<br>
and a second metal plate, which are adapted to form an electrical circuit when compressed<br>
by a predetermined pressure or higher and convert the charged state of the battery to the<br>
discharged state, wherein the first metal plate, the pressure-sensitive conducting film, and<br>
the second metal plate are adapted to discharged the battery within 60 seconds when a<br>
predetermined pressure or higher is applied to the first metal plate, the pressure-sensitive<br>
conducting film, and the second metal plate, and the first and second metal plates are to be<br>
directly electrically connected in parallel to positive electrode and negative electrode of the<br>
battery, respectively, and the safety device is on and positioned outside of the electrode<br>
assembly.<br>
[9] According to still another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method<br>
for adjusting the safety of a battery by converting the charged state of the battery to the<br>
discharged state, before the battery is damaged by a pressure, through an electrical circuit<br>
formed on a safety device by means of the pressure, wherein the safety device has a first<br>
metal plate, a pressure-sensitive conducting film, and a second metal plate which are<br>
sequentially laminated and are in contact with each other, and wherein the safety device is<br>
adapted to discharged the battery within 60 seconds when a predetermined pressure or<br>
higher is applied to both of the battery and safety device, and the first and second metal<br><br>
plates are directly electrically connected in parallel to positive electrode and negative<br>
electrode of the battery, respectively, and the safety device is on and positioned outside of<br>
the battery.<br>

Mode for Invention<br>
[20]	Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
[21]	Hereinafter, according to the present invention will be explained with reference to<br>
the accompanying drawings.<br>
[22]	The present invention is characterized in that in order to lower the charged state of<br>
a cell by sensing the application of an external impact caused by a pressure, a nail, or a<br>
nipper or an external pressure to a battery, a battery is provided with a safety device<br>
adapted to exhibit electrical conductivity in the case of an external impact or external<br>
compression.<br>
[23]	As a non-limiting example of a safety device for exhibiting electrical conductivity<br>
in the case of an external impact or external compression, the present invention<br>
provides a safety device having a PSCF interposed between two metal plates (for<br>
example, collectors) through which current can flow and adapted to conduct current,<br>
when a predetermined pressure or higher occurs, in the direction of the pressure (refer<br>
to FIG. 1).<br>
[24]	As a non-limiting example of the PSCF, an ACF (anisotropic conductive film) is<br>
provided.<br>
[25]	The ACF refers to an adhesive film including an insulating adhesive having a<br>
thickness of 15-35um and electrically conductive balls composed of fine electrically<br>
conductive particles having a diameter of 3-15µm dispersed therein. The idea of the<br>
present invention is not limited by the thickness of the adhesive film and the diameter<br>
of the electrically conductive particles constituting the ACF. The electrically<br>
conductive particles include carbon fibers, metal (Ni, solder), and metal.<br>
(Ni/Au)-coated plastic balls. This is just an illustration of the embodiments of the<br>
present invention and is not a general term for the PSCF. It is obvious t:&gt; those skilled<br>
in the art that any PSCF can be applied to the principle of the present invention.<br>
[26]	The adhesive material includes thermoplastic material (styrene butadiene rubber,<br>
polyvinyl butylene), thermosetting material (epoxy resin, polyurethane, acrylic resin),<br>
and a mixture of thermoplastic material and thermosetting material.<br>
[27]	The metal plate used in the present invention may be made of any metal having<br>
electrical conductivity, such as aluminum metal, copper metal, and nickel metal.<br>
[28]	The metal plate preferably has excellent thermal conductivity so that, in a normal<br>
or special situation, heat can be dispersed from inside the battery to the thermally<br>
conductive metal plate via a terminal.<br>
[29]	The operation of a battery having a safety device adapted to exhibit electrical con-<br>
ductivity when a predetermined pressure or higher is applied in the case of an external,<br>
impact or external compression according to the present invention will aow be<br><br>
described with reference to the drawings.<br>
[30]	The safety device according to the present invention includes a first metal plate, a<br>
second metal plate, and a PSCF interposed between both metal plates and adapted to<br>
exhibit electrical conductivity when a predetermined pressure or higher is applied. An<br>
example of the safety device, as shown in FIG. 1, includes collectors acting as the<br>
metal plates and an ACF acting as the PSCF.<br>
[31 ]	The ACF acts as a nonconductor through which no current is applied to flow<br>
during a normal state and, when a predetermined pressure or higher occurs, conducts<br>
current in the direction of the pressure.<br>
[32]	As shown in FIG. 1, the first metal plate (collector) of both metal plates positioned<br>
on both surfaces of the ACF is electrically connected to the positive electrode of the<br>
battery and the second metal plate (collector) to the negative electrode thereof.<br>
[33]	In the battery having the inventive safety device connected thereto, both metal<br>
plates are electrically insulated from each other by the ACF, as long as no external<br>
pressure is applied to them, and no current flows between them. The battery then<br>
functions normally and maintains the charged state.<br>
[34]	When a pressure caused by an external impact and the like is applied to the battery<br>
having the inventive safety device connected thereto, both metal plates are electrically<br>
connected to each other. This is because the ACF exhibits electrical conductivity when<br>
the pressure reaches a predetermined level. The battery is then discharged and the<br>
internal voltage of the battery drops abruptly. In the discharged state, the battery does<br>
not ignite nor explode even when an impact caused by an external pressure, a nail, or a<br>
nipper is applied thereto. As such, the present invention can improve the safety of the<br>
battery by lowering the charged state of the cell before it explodes, when a pre-<br>
determined pressure or higher is applied to the metal plates due to an external impact<br>
cause by a pressure, a nail, or a nipper.<br>
[35]	The inventive safety device is preferably positioned perpendicularly to a direction<br>
in which most pressure is applied to the battery in the case of an external impact or<br>
external compression.<br>
[36]	The inventive safety device may be positioned inside or outside the cell, but is<br>
preferably positioned outside.<br>
[37]	When positioned outside the battery, the inventive safety device may be used while<br>
being exposed or while being enclosed by a polymer layer having electrical insulation<br>
property.<br>
[38]	Meanwhile, examples of connection of the safety device according to the present<br>
invention to a battery are illustrated FIG. 2.<br>
[39]	FIG. 2 shows a pouch-type battery having the inventive safety device connected<br>
thereto.<br><br>
[40]	In general, a pouch-type battery is of a lamination type and includes at least one<br>
positive electrode plate and at least one negative electrode plate which are laminated<br>
alternately. The lamination-type battery has positive and negative electrode leads for<br>
connecting the positive and negative electrode plates to the exterior of he battery, re-<br>
spectively. The leads are connected to a power source on the exterior of the battery<br>
sheath.<br>
[41]	The inventive safety device including the first and second metal plates and the<br>
ACF interposed between them are laminated together with the outermost positive<br>
electrode plate and/or the outermost negative electrode plate. The first metal plate is<br>
electrically connected to a part of the positive electrode plate, to the positive electrode<br>
lead, or to the positive electrode terminal and the second metal plate is electrically<br>
connected to a part of the negative electrode plate, to the negative electrode lead, or to<br>
the negative electrode terminal.<br>
[42]	The inventive safety device may be laminated directly adjacent to the electrode<br>
plate, but is preferably laminated on the exterior of the battery sheath and only<br>
electrically connected to the positive and negative electrodes.<br>
[43]	FIG. 3 shows a can-type battery having the inventive safety device connected<br>
thereto.	<br><br>
[44]	In general, a can-type battery has an electrode assembly including positive and<br>
negative electrode plates and a separator placed in a container including a can and a<br>
cap. The container acts as an electrode terminal (positive electrode terminal in FIG. 3)<br>
and an electrode terminal having the opposite polarity (negative electrode terminal in<br>
FIG. 3) protrudes from the container while being insulated.	<br>
[45]	The container of the can-type battery can act as the first metal plate of the inventive<br><br>
safety device. Therefore, the second metal plate of the inventive safety device is<br>
positioned parallel to at least one surface of the container with the ACF interposed<br>
between them and a part of the second metal plate is electrically connected to the<br>
electrode terminal having the opposite polarity.<br>
[46]	The inventive safety device may be used for any type of battery, including a<br>
primary battery and a secondary battery, as long as it has been charged. As a non-<br>
limiting example, the inventive safety device may be used for a lithium secondary<br>
battery including a) a positive electrode capable of lithium ion intercalution/dein-<br>
tercalation, b) a negative electrode capable of lithium ion intercalation/deintercalation,<br>
c) a porous separator, and d) a non-aqueous electrolyte including lithium salt and<br>
electrolyte compound.<br>
[47]	The non-aqueous electrolyte includes cyclic carbonate and/or linear carbonate. The<br>
cyclic carbonate may be, for example, ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate<br>
(PC), gamma-butyrolactone (GBL). The linear carbonate is, for example, preferably at<br><br>
least one selected from the group consisting of diethyl carbonate (DEC), dimethyl<br>
carbonate (DMC), ethylmethyl carbonate (EMC), and methyl propyl carbonate (MPC).<br>
[48]	The lithium salt included in the non-aqueous electrolyte is preferably selected from<br>
the group consisting of LiClO4 , LiCF3 SO3 , LiPF , LiBF , LiAsF , and LiN(CF3 SO2 )2 .<br>
[49]	As the negative electrode active material, carbon, lithium metal or alloy is<br>
preferably used. In addition, metal oxide capable of lithium ion intercalation/dein-<br>
tercalation and having a potential for lithium of less than 2V, such as TiO2 or SnO 2,<br><br>
may also be used.<br>
[50]	The positive electrode active material is preferably a lithium-containing transition<br>
metal oxide and, for example, is preferably at least one selected from the group<br>
consisting of LiCoO2 , LINiO2 , LiMn2 O4 , LiMnO2 , and LiNi Cox O2 (0<x a></x><br>
positive electrode made of metal oxide, such as MnO , or a composition thereof may<br>
also be used.<br>
[51]	The porous separator may be, for example, a polyolefin-based separator.<br>
[52]	The inventive lithium secondary battery may be manufactured by a conventional<br>
method of placing a porous separator between positive and negative electrodes and<br>
injecting a non-aqueous electrolyte including lithium salt, such as LiPF6 , and an<br><br>
additive.<br>
[53]	EXAMPLES<br>
[54]	The present invention will now be described in more detail with reference to the<br>
following examples, which are only given as an illustration of the present invention<br>
and do not limit the present invention.<br>
[55]	Example 1<br>
[56]	As shown in FIG. 2, the inventive safety device including a first metal plate<br>
(positive electrode collector), a second metal plate (negative electrode collector), and<br>
an ACF interposed between both metal plates was attached to a pouch- type cell in such<br>
a manner mat the first and second electrode plates were electrically connected to the<br>
positive and negative electrodes, respectively. The positive and negative electrodes of<br>
the pouch-type cell were made of LiCoO and carbon, respectively, and the electrolyte<br>
was made of 1M LiPF6 solution having base composition of EC:EMC (1:2).<br><br>
[57]	The cell was charged to 4.2V and local crush experiment was performed by<br>
compressing the inventive safety device in the vertical direction with a rod having a<br>
diameter of 1cm at a speed of 3mm/min.<br>
[58]	The experiment result showed that, as the pressure applied to the ACF rose, the<br>
voltage abruptly dropped to about 0V. The cell was stable without explosion and the<br>
exothermic temperature was very low, i.e., about 70°C or lower (refer to FIG. 4).<br>
[59]	Example 2<br>
[60]	Cell manufacturing and local crush experiment were performed in the same manner<br><br>
as in Example 1, except that the cell was charged to 4.3V for experiment under severer<br>
condition than Example 1.<br>
[61]	The experiment result showed that, as the pressure rose, the voltage abruptly<br>
dropped to about OV. The cell was stable without explosion and the exothermic<br>
temperature was very low, i.e., about 70°C or lower (refer to FIG. 5).<br>
[62]	Example 3<br>
[63]	Cell manufacturing and local crush experiment were performed in he same manner<br>
as in Example 1, except that the cell was charged to 4.4V for experiment under severer<br>
condition than Example 2.<br>
[64]	The experiment result showed that, as the pressure rose, the voltage abruptly<br>
dropped to about OV. The cell was stable without explosion and the exothermic<br>
temperature was very low, i.e., about 70°C or lower (refer to FIG. 6).<br>
[65]	Comparative example 1<br>
[66]	Cell manufacturing and local crush experiment were performed in the same manner<br>
as Example 1, except that the inventive safety device was not attached to the cell.<br>
[67]	The experiment result showed that the cell exploded. Voltage drop did not occur<br>
before the explosion, but voltage drop and heat occurred concurrently with the<br>
explosion. The exothermic temperature was very high, i.e., about 600°C or higher<br>
(refer to FIG. 7).<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
[68]	The inventive safety device is connected to a battery and prevents a cell from being<br>
damaged or at least from igniting or exploding, even when an external impact caused<br>
by a pressure, a nail, or a nipper or an external pressure is applied, by conducting the<br><br>
current of the cell to the safety device and discharging the battery before the cell is<br>
damaged by the cell.	<br>
[69]	Although there has been a limitation in increasing the energy density of a non-<br>
aqueous secondary battery (for example, lithium secondary battery) due to the safety<br>
problem of the battery, the inventive safety device can increase operating charging<br>
voltage of the battery while securing the stability thereof, thereby to realize a battery<br>
having high energy density.<br>
[70]	The forgoing embodiments are merely exemplary and are not to be construed as<br>
limiting the present invention. The present teachings can be readily applied to other<br>
types of apparatuses. The description of the present invention is intended to be il-<br>
lustrative, and not to limit the scope of the claims. Many alternatives, modifications,<br>
and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
SAFETY DEVICE FOR A BATTERY, BATTERY HAVING THE SAME AND<br>
METHOD OF ADJUSTING THE SAFETY OF SAID BATTERY<br><br>
Disclosed is a battery safety device adapted to form an electrical circuit when compressed<br>
by a predetermined pressure or higher and convert the charged state of a battery to the<br>
discharged state, a battery having the safety device, and a method for adjusting the safety<br>
of a battery by converting the charged state of the battery to the discharged state, before<br>
the battery is damaged by a pressure, through an electrical circuit formed on a safety<br>
device by means of the pressure. The safety device has a first metal plate, a second metal<br>
plate, and a pressure-sensitive conducting film interposed between both metal plates and<br>
adapted to exhibit electrical conductivity when a predetermined pressure or higher is<br>
applied. The first and second metal plates are electrically connected to the positive and<br>
negative electrodes of the battery, respectively. The safety device connected to a battery<br>
prevents the battery from being damaged or at least from igniting or exploding, even<br>
when an external impact caused by a pressure, a nail, or a nipper or an external pressure<br>
is applied to the battery, by conducting the current of the battery to the safety device and<br>
discharging the battery before the battery is damaged by the external impact or external<br>
pressure.</td>
