FUSED ZIRCONIA-BASED SOLID OXEDE FUEL CELL<br>
Oh-Hun Kwon<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION^)<br>
The present application claims priority from U.S. provisional patent application no. 60/477', 147, filed June 9, 2003, entitled "FUSED ZIR.CONIA-BASED SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELL," naming inventor Oh-Hun Xwon, which application is incorporated "by reference herein in its entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention generally relates to novel solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In pursuit of high-efficiency, environmentally friendly energy production, solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technologies have emerged as a potential alternative to conventional turbine and combustion engines. Fuel cell technologies typically have a higher efficiency and have lower CO and NOx emissions than traditional combustion engines. In addition, fuel cell technologies tend to be quiet and vibration-Zee. Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have an advantage over other fuel cell varieties. For example, SOFCs may use fuel sources such as natural gas, propane, methanol, kerosene, and diesel, among others because SOFCs operate at high enough operating temperatures to allow for internal fuel re formation. However, challenges exist in reducing the cost of SOFC systems to be competitive with combustion engines and other fuel cell technologies. These challenges include lowering the cost of materials, improving degradation or life cycle, and improving operation characteristics such as current and power density.<br>
A typical SOFC has an electrolyte made from an expensive, high-purity, chemically co-precipitated stabilized zarconia. Chemically co-precipitated stabilized zhrcoiiia may also be used in a porous support tube structure or doped with nickel to produce a fuel electrode (anode). Other expensive materials such as doped lanthanum manganite have been proposed as an air electrode (cathode). The cathode can also be made of a composite of doped lan&amp;anumniangaiiite and stabilized zixconia.<br>
In addition to the cost of materials3 conductivity degradation in the electrolyte should be considered. Typicaljy, chemically co-precipitated stabilized zirconia-based electrolytes degrade at a rate as high as 0.5 percent per thousand hours of operation. This degradation has been attributed to gradual changes in the crystalline structure of the solid electrolyte and/or reaction with impurities. Degradation may also occur through on-and-off cycling. On-and-off cycling c}'cles temperatures, creating temperature differences between components during cooling and reheating. Even small difT-rcn".-s in expansion coefficients among various components of an SOFC lead to cracks, flaws, and separations during cycling. These cracks, flaws and separations degrade conductivity and increase resistivity between components. Lost conductivity, increases hi resistivity, and degradation of contact surface also lead to a reduction in operating voltages and current densities. As a solid electrolyte degrades, its resistance increases, "detracting from the potential of the fuel cell. In addition, increases in resistance in the electrolytes, electrodes or interconnects reduce the power output. As<br><br>
a result of degradation, the expensive fuel cell components are replaced more frequently, leading to higher overall energy costs.<br>
As such, many typical fuel cell systems suffer from deficiencies in providing a low cost alternative to other energy sources. In view of the foregoing, it is considered generally desirable to provide an improved SOFC having electrode and electrolyte materials having suitable properties for use in demanding SOFC applications.<br>

FIG. 5 illustrates an SOFC system.<br>
The use of the same reference symbols in different drawings indicates similar or identicaTitems.<br>
MODES FOR CAIStYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
In one particular embodiment, the disclosure is directed to a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) including a layer formed of fused material. For example, the SOFC may include an electrolyte formed of fused, doped<br><br>
zicconia powder, such as fused, stabilized zirconia. In another exemplary embodiment, the SOFC may further include a conductivity agent, such as nickel, iron, cobalt, and other transition metals. A solid oxide fuel cell stack may be formed of a plurality of SOFCs.<br>
FIG. 1 depicts an exemplary SOFC.   The SC?C hts two electrodes 102 and 106, and an electrolyte 104. The anode 102 overlies the electrolyte 104. The electrolyte 104 overlies the cathode 106. In operation, oxygen ions are transported across the electrolyte 104 to react with incoming fuel. This ion transport produces an electrical potential between the anode 102 and the cathode 106. In more detail, oxygen-containing gas enters through a cathode and diffuses to a cathode/electrolyte interface. Fuel diffuses through an anode to an anode/electrolyte interface. Oxygen ions are transported across the electrolyte from the cathode interface to the anode interface, where the oxygen ions react with the fuel. Multiple SOFCs as shown in FIG. 1 may be stacked on top of each other to form a solid oxide fuel cell stack.<br>
According to another embodiment, the electrode of the solid oxide fuel cell is formed of a fused material, such as a fused powder. Alternatively ox ad/ itionally, a fused powder may be used to fonn an interconnect.<br>
Fused material may take various farms including a wide range of oxide and non-oxide materials. Oxide materials, in particular, include doped and undoped zirconia, ceria, and gallia. The zirconia and ceria      . -materials maybe stabilized with various oxides including oxides of yttrium, scandium, samarium, ytterbium and. gadolinium. In one specific embodiment, a fused electrolyte pov/dei maybe yttria-stabilized ziicotna with at least about 8 mole percent yttria and may be formed through an arc melting or fusion process. For example, the yttria-stabilized zirconia may include at least about 8.5 mole percent yttria, at least about 9 mole percent yttria, at least about 9.5 mole percent yttria, or at least about 10 mole percent yttria. In another embodiment, the fused electrolyte powder maybe 10 mole percent yttria-stabilized zirconia formed through an arc melting or fusion process.<br>
The fused electrode material may take similar forms to that of the fused electrolyte material. For example, a component of electrode material may be a stabilized zirconia, stabilized with approximately 8 to 10 mole percent yttria, and be formed using an arc melting or fusion process. The fused electrode material may contain conductivity agents, such as metals and metaJ oxides, such as nickeL La this case, nickel oxide may be mixed with fused powder, which is processed to for sintered, fused electrodes, the nickel oxide being reduced to nickel in a reducing atmosphere. Reduction of the nickel oxide may not only provide desirable conductivity in the resulting electrode, but also desirable porosity for fuel and/or oxygen migration to the electrolyte surface.<br>
Fused powder tends to have a greater amount of impurities than more expensive chemical precipitation powder. In general, the impurities of fused powders may be less than about 2% or less than about 1% by weight. However, in some embodiments, the impurities maybe greater than about 0.2%, 0.5%, 0.7%, or 1% and as high as 2% or higher, but generally less than 5% by weight The impurities may include inert components, such as alumina, that have limited influence on the. properties of the electrolyte, electrode, or interconnect The percentages of impurities will vary depending on the inclusion of inert components.<br><br>
An exemplary electrolyte may "be fonned using a tape-casting method with an organic binder. The electrolyte may then be densified by sintering, which includes pressureless sintering, hot pressing, hot isostatically pressing, hot uniaxiaUy pressing, or hot forging. The electrolyte may be co-formed with the balance of an SOFC or SOFC stack, such as by co-sintering, and preferably co-hot pressing so as to form a cell or stack in one densification step. The resulting electrolyte is durable with a reasonable ionic conductivity at least about 0.05 S/cm, such as at least about 0.10 S/cm or at least about 0.12 S/cm. In one exemplary embodiment, the electrical conductivity is not greater than about 0.5 S/cm, such as not greater than about 0.3 S/cm or not greater than about 0.2 S/cm. For example, the ionic conductivity may be between about 0.12 S/cm and about 02 S/cm. Moreover, the electrolyte conductivity degrades at not more than about 2.5%, such as not more than about 2.0%, not more than about 0.5%, not more than about 0.2%, or not more than about 0.1% per 1,000 hours.<br>
The electrolyte may be used in a solid oxide fuel cell having an anode and a cathode, as already described above. The solid oxide fuel cell including the electrolyte may be included in a stack of solid oxide fuel cells, and may include 3 or more cells, such as at least 4 cells, but may include 10, 50 or greater than 100 fuel cells, among various configurations.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A batch of arc-melted and air-quenched crude including 10 mole percent yttria stabilized zirconia (Sample 1) was milled to an average particle size of approximately 0.6 micrometers by an attrition mill using yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystals (Y-TZP) milling media, followed by a spray drying.<br>
	The spray-dried puwdei was mixed with an organic binder in solvent and tape cast to form thin tapes<br>
of approximately 0.4 millimeters thick S'dine spray-dried powder was cold isostatically pressed into rectangular tiles at 207 MPa, resulting in a green density of about 55% of theoretical density. In parallel^green tiles were also pressed using a chemically co-precipitated powder having 8 mole percent yttria, TZ8 Y, available from Tosoh.<br>
The flexible green tape of yttria-stabilized zirconia was cut into bar or disk shapes with a laser machine. The green bars and disks were sintered on zirconia setter plates in a furnace with an increasing temperature at a rate of 100°C per hour to 1,500°C and held at l,500°C for one hour, followed by a cooling by power shutdown. The sintered density was higher than 98% of theoretical density.<br>
A 4-probe electrical conductivity test was used to determine the electrical conductivity of the sintered yttria-stabilized zirconia samples. Commercially available platinum paste was used to establish electrical contacts. .Hie samples were then baked at 900°C for high temperature measurements.<br>
The electrolyte from the 10 mol'e percent yttria-stabilized zirconia fused powder showed a negligible<br>
*<br>
degradation at ls000°C for 1,000 hours, compared to a significant degradation of the TZ8Y sample. As shown in FIG. 2 over long term, the 10 mole percent yttria-stabilized fused powder maintains a higher conductivity and lower degradation rate than the TZ8Y sample from chemically co-precipitated powder.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
A 1000 hour test was conducted on exemplary samples of fused 10 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia (Saniple 2) and 10 mol% chemically co-precipitated yttria-stabilized zirconia. The 10 mol% chemically co-precipitated yttria-stabilized zirconia is labeled TZ10Y, the raw material powder from Tosoh company.<br>
A 4-probe electrical conductivity test was used ic dcmrmme the electrical conductivity of the sintered yttria-stabilized zirconia samples. Electrolyte bar samples of each of the respective samples were subjected to voltage testing every 10 minutes for 1000 hours at 1000DC using a 1mA current Platinum wires (Diameter=0.2 mm) were fixed with Platinum paste (TR7905/Tanaka Kflrinzoku Kogyo ELK.) to each bar to form electrodes. The wire and the paste were dried at 100°C during 5 hours then sintered at 1000°C during 5 hours (300°C/h).<br>
As shown on FIG. 3, the conductivities of both samples are almost constant in time. The TZ10Y average conductivity is around 0.145 S.cm"1 and the fused electrolyte sample (Saniple 2) shows an average conductivity around 0.130 S.cml. Thus, the conductivity of TZ10Y sample is 10% higher than the fused<br>
Sample 2.<br>
For each sample the conductivity degradation as a function of time has been calculated and is shown in FIG, 4. The results indicate a slight slope break after 340. hours for both samples. The TZ10Y electrolyte and the fiised Sample 2 electrolyte show a slight decrease. This degradation was probably caused by a temperature deviation. Prior to the change, the temperature suddenly increased to 1004°C and likely modified the conductivity of the samples. After the deviation, the toixipcxanare returned to 1000°C. Later, the deviation started again and increased continuously to reach 1010°C at the. end of the test. After th'e slope break, the degradation remained constant. The overall average degradation rates for TZ10Y and Sample 2 are 2.8% and 2AVo, respectively. However, for extended periods, such. as. beyond 600 hours, the degradation was negligible, such as not greater than about 0.1% per 1000 hours.<br>
While, the fused powder-based samples may exhibit a similar degradation profile to chemically co-precipitated powder-based samples having an equivalent doping of stabilizing agents, Sample 1 shows superior performance and the fused powder is less expensive and therefore more cost effective than chemically co-precipitated powders. In addition, slower average degradation rates for the Sample 2'may lead to better conductivity in SOFCs during longer SOFC use, such as -&gt;0,000 hours or more.<br>
The solid oxide fuel cells described above may be incorporated into a SOFC system for producing power. FIG. 5 depicts an exemplary SOFC system. The system includes a fuel system 502, an air System 504, a SOFC stack 508, and a power conditioner 510. The system may also include a reformer 506 depending on the expected operating temperature of the SOFC stack.<br>
Fuel enters the fuel system 502. The fuel system 502 may clean the fuel and/or heat the fuel in preparation for reforming or reaction. The fuel system 502 may include heat exchangers, compressors, pumps, absorption beds, and other components. From the fuel system 502, the fuel enters a reformer 506. The reformer 506 may use the fuel to produce hydrogen and other molecules. The reformer 506 is typically used<br><br>
fox low temperature SOFC systems. High temperature SOFC systems may have the advantage of internal reforming and thus utilise unreformed fuel.<br>
Air enters the air system 504. The air system 504 may clean, compress, purify, and/or heat the air. The air system may include compressors, absorption beds, membranes, and heat exchangers, among other components.<br>
The fuel and air are directed to the SOFC stack 508. The fuel is typically directed across the anodes<br>
of the fuel cells in the SOFC stack and the air is typically directed across the cathodes. In the case of SOFCs,<br>
oxygen ion transport across the electrolyte from the. cathode to the anode produces an electric potential. This<br>
electric potential is conditioned -with a power conditioner 510 that is electrically coupled to the SOFC stack<br>
508. The power conditioner 510 may deliver power to a grid or circuitry. Exhaust from the SOFC stack may<br>
be used for heat exchange or in the reformation process.	♦<br>
