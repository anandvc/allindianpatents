				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing oxo-oxazoline derivatives using a simple and inexpensive method.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Oxo-oxazoline derivatives are critical intermediates for compounds (WO98/08867) which are TRH (thyrotropin releasing hormone) derivatives represented by the following general formula (VIII):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein RA is a hydrogen atom or optionally substituted lower alkyl; Y is an optionally substituted alkyl.<br>
Further, compounds represented by the following general formulas (III-A), (III-B), (IV-A), or (IV-B):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1 is an optionally substituted lower alkyl, an optionally substituted aryl, an alkynyl, or an optionally substituted heteroaryl, and derivatives thereof, are useful as tools for combinatorial chemistry.<br>
Conventionally, as a method for producing oxo-oxazoline derivatives haying a lower alkyloxycarbonyl group or a carboxyl group, a method of cyclizing a starting material while retaining its stereochemistry, and a method using cyclization reaction without reference to stereoselectivity are known.<br>
An example of the method of cyclizing a starting material while retaining its stereochemistry is the following:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
(Tetrahedron, 48, 2507, 1992). In this reaction, L-alio-threonine used as a starting material is allowed to react with phosgene and potassium hydroxide in toluene at 0°C for one hour, thereby obtaining a cyclized product which retains its stereochemisty. Unfortunately, this method encounters a problem in industrialization since the method employs L-alio-threonine which is more expensive than its natural type, and phosgene which is toxic to the human body.(Formula Removed)<br>
An example of the cyclization method without reference to stereoselectivity is the following:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
(Japanese Laid-Open Publication No. 60-34955). In this reaction, a starting material is allowed to react with potassium carbonate in water at 60°C for 1.5 hours to obtain a cyclized product. It is believed that the stereochemistry of the material is maintained in view of the mechanism of this method. Therefore. it is considered that allo-threonine needs to be used as a starting material in order to obtain a cis-form cyclized product.<br>
Although a resultant cyclized product is an oxo-oxazoline derivative which does not have a lower alkyloxycarbonyl group or a carboxyl group, the following method is known:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
(Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan., 44, 2515, 1971). In this reaction, a starting material is allowed to react in thionyl chloride at 60°C for 24 hours without solvent, thereby obtaining a cyclized product at a yield of 65%. In this method, similar to the method of the present invention, the position of an ethyl group is inverted after the reaction. However, the<br>
starting material is not an amino acid derivative, and the relationship between the amino group and the hydroxyl group of the starting material is different from that of a starting material used in the method of the present invention. Moreover, since the reaction is conducted in thionyl chloride, the yield is as low as 65%.<br>
Similar to the method of the present invention, a cyclization reaction with inversion is known:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
(Heterocycl. Commun., 2, 55, 1996). An example in which trifluoroacetic anydride is used in the first step is disclosed. Although in the method of the present invention, the yield of a cyclization reaction is as high as 83%, the yield of the cyclization reaction disclosed in the above-described publication is as low as 40% in both a method using tosyl chloride and a method using trifluoroacetic anydride. Moreover, the method of the present invention is superior in regard to simplicity of reaction.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The production method of the present invention will be described in detail in which a starting material is one optically active substance. When the other material is used, similar reactions can be carried out. When a starting material has a substituent which is an obstacle to a reaction in first to sixth steps shown below, the starting material may be protected in advance in accordance with a method described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Theodora W Green (John Wiley &amp; Sons), and the like, and deprotected in an appropriate stage.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1, R2, R3, and Y are as described above.<br>
(First step)<br>
In the first step, R2OC(=0)-Hal, wherein Hal is halogen, [R2OC(=0) ]20, and the like are caused to react with a compound represented by a general formula (V-A) to obtain a compound (VII-A) in which an amino group is protected by R2OC(=0)-. This step can be carried out in accordance with a method described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Theodora W Green (John Wiley &amp; Sons), and the like.<br>
For example, a compound represented by a general formula (V-A) is caused to react with 1-0 equivalent to 3.0 equivalents, preferably 1.0 equivalent to 1.5 equivalents, of R20C(=0)-Hal, wherein Hal is halogen, and 2.0 equivalents to 6.0 equivalents, preferably 2.0 equivalents to 3.0 equivalents, of an organic base (e.g.,<br>
triethylamine, and the like) or an inorganic base (e.g., sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydrogencarbonate, potassium hydrogencarbonate, and the like), in a mixed solvent, such as water-toluene, water-dioxane, water-acetone, and the like, or a solvent, such as water, dioxane, and the like at -20°C to 50°C, preferably 0°C to 20°C for 0.5 to 3 hours to obtain a compound represented by a general formula (VII-A).<br>
In the above-described IV), "step of protecting an amino group with R2OC(=0)-" refers to this first step.<br>
(Second step)<br>
In the second step, the carboxyl group of a compound represented by a general formula (VII-A) is esterified to obtain a compound represented by a general formula (II-A). This step can be carried out by a commonly used esterif ication.<br>
For example, a compound represented by the general formula (VII-A) is dissolved in a solvent, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, and the like, and allowed to react with 1 equivalent to 5 equivalents, preferably 1 equivalent to 2 equivalents, of ahalogenating agent, such as thionyl chloride, hydrochloric acid, phosphorus oxychloride, and the like, at -20°C to 50°C, preferably 0°C to 25°C, one hour to 24 hours, preferably one hour to 3 hours to obtain a compound represented by a general formula (II-A).<br>
In the above-described IV), "step of esterifying a carboxyl group" refers to this second step.<br>
(Third step)<br>
The third step is a cyclization reaction in which the stereochemistry of R1 is reversed.<br>
For example, a compound represented by a general formula (I-A) can be obtained in accordance with 1) to 3) described below. 1) a compound represented by a general formula (II-A) is dissolved in a solvent, such as toluene, ethyl acetate, cyclohexane, acetonitrile, and the like, preferably toluene. The amount of the solvent is preferably 1 V to 50 V, particularly 1 V to 10 V, where use of 1 ml of a solvent with respect to 1 g of a starting material is referred to as 1 V. 2)1.0 equivalent to 20 equivalents, preferably 1.0 equivalent to 2.0 equivalents, of thionyl chloride are added at 25°C to 80°C, preferably 25°C to 50°C. Thionyl chloride can be used as a solvent. 3) The reaction solution is stirred at 25°C to 80°C, preferably 60°C to 80°C, for 5 hours to 48 hours, preferably 6 hours to 12 hours.<br>
In this reaction, the closer the equivalent value of thionyl chloride is to 1.0 and the higher the "V" value of the amount of the solvent, the proportion of the cis-form of the intended compound was increased (the proportion of the trans-form was decreased).<br>
The yield of the total compounds of cis-form and trans-form is not substantially affected by the equivalent value of thionyl chloride and the amount of the solvent.<br>
In the above-described IV), "step of treating with thionyl chloride" refers to this third step.<br>
(Fourth step)<br>
In the fourth step, an ester compound represented<br>
by the general formula (I-A) is hydrolyzed to carboxylic acid. This step can be carried out by a commonly used hydrolysis.<br>
For example, a compound represented by the general formula (I-A) is dissolved in a solvent, such as water, and the like, and 0.1 equivalent to 10 equivalents, preferably 1 equivalent to 5 equivalents, of acid (e.g., hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and the like) are added to the solution at 0°C to 100°C, preferably 25°C to 80°C. The resultant solution is allowed to react at 25°C to 100°C, preferably 50°C to 80°C for 1 hour to 5 hours to obtain a compound represented by a general formula (III-A). This step can be carried out under basic conditions.<br>
(Fifth step)<br>
In the fifth step, a compound represented by the general formula (III-A) is hydrolyzed to obtain allo-amino acid derivatives represented by a general formula (IV-A).<br>
For example, a compound represented by the general formula (III-A) is dissolved in a solvent, such as water, and 0.1 equivalent to 20 equivalents, preferably 1 equivalent to 10 equivalents, of acid (e.g., hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and the like) are added to the solution at 0°C to 100°C, preferably 25°C to 80°C. The resultant solution is allowed to react at 25°C to 100°C, preferably 80°C to 100°C for 1 hour to 48 hours to obtain a compound represented by the general formula (IV-A).<br>
(Sixth step) (peptide bond formation)<br>
Three amino acid derivatives are subjected to two<br>
peptide bond formation to synthesize a compound (VI) (WO98/08867). A compound represented by the general formula (I-A) obtained by the above-described method is used to synthesize the compound (VI) in the following two methods (method A and method B).<br>
Method A<br>
Method B   (Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R4 is the protecting group of a carboxyl group, R5 is the protecting group of an amino group, and R1 and Y are as described above.<br>
Method A - First step<br>
The carboxyl group of 3-(4-thiazole)alanine synthesized in accordance with a method described in Synth. Commun., 20, 22, 3507 (1990) and Chem. Pharm. Bull., 38, 1, 103 (1990), is protected as an ester, such as methyl ester, benzyl ester, t-butyl ester, diphenylmethyl ester, and the like, resulting in a compound represented by a general formula (VIII). This compound and a compound represented by the general formula (III-A) are subjected to a peptide bond formation.<br>
When the carboxyl group is protected as diphenylmethyl ester, the protecting reaction can be carried out as follows. 3-(4-thiazole)alanine is dissolved in a mixed solvent of an alcohol solvent, such as methanol, ethanol, and the like and a solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, and the like. 1 to 3 equivalents, preferably 1 to 2 equivalents, of diphenyl diazomethane are added to the solution at 0 to 50°C, preferably 20 to 40°C for 10 minutes to 1 hour, preferably 20 to 40 minutes. The resultant solution is allowed to react at the same temperature for 30 minutes to 3 hours, preferably 1 to 2 hours while being stirred.<br>
The peptide bond formation is described in "Peputido Gosei [Peptide Synthesis]" (Nobuo Izumiya, Maruzen), and the like, and can be carried out by such a commonly used peptide bond formation method.<br>
As commonly used peptide bond formation methods, a method employing a condensing agent, such as N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and the like, an azide<br>
method, an acid chloride method, an acid anhydride method, an active ester method, and the like. When a starting material has a substituent (amino, carboxy, hydroxyl, and the like) which is an obstacle to the peptide formation, the substituent can be protected in advance in accordance with a method described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Theodora W. Green (John Wiley &amp; Sons), and the like, and the protecting group is removed at a desired stage.<br>
A compound represented by the general formula (VIII) and a compound represented by the general formula (III-A) are dissolved in a solvent, such as N,N-dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, and the like. An N,N-dimethylformamide solution of a base, such as triethylamine, and the like, and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), is added to that solution at -10 to 10°C, preferably in ice bath. 1-hydroxybenzotriazole may be added. The resultant solution is stirred at 10 to 50°C, preferably 20 to 30°C, for one hour to one day, preferably 5 to 10 hours, followed by typical subsequent processes. Thus, a compound represented by a general formula (IX) can be obtained.<br>
Method A - Second step<br>
A deprotecting reaction can be carried out by a commonly used deprotecting reaction (Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Theodora W. Green (John Wiley &amp; Sons)). For example, when R4 is diphenylmethyl, a compound represented by a general formula (IX) can be added to anisole and trif luoro aceticacidat -10 tol0°C, preferably in ice bath. The mixture is stirred at the same temperature for 5 to 30 minutes, preferably 10 to 20 minutes. After the mixture is warmed to 20 to 40°C, the mixture can be stirred for 1 to 4 hours, preferably 2 to 3 hours.<br>
The resultant deprotected substance can be reacted with a pyrrolidine derivative synthesized by a method described in Tetrahedron, 27, 2599 (1971) through a peptide bond formation similar to method A - first step, thereby obtaining a compound represented by the general formula (VI).<br>
Method B - First step<br>
The amino group of 3-(4-thiazole)alanine synthesized in accordance with a method described in Synth. Commun., 20, 22, 3507 (1990) and Chem. Pharm. Bull., 38, 1, 103 (1990), is protected by a protecting group for an amino group, such as t-butyloxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl, phthaloyl, trifluoroacetyl, and the like to obtain a compound represented by a general formula (X). This compound and a pyrrolidine derivative synthesized by a method described in Tetrahedron, 27, 2599 (1971) are subjected to a peptide bond formation.<br>
When t-butyloxycarbonyl is used for the protection, the protecting reaction can be carried out as follows. 3-(4-thiazole)alanine is dissolved in a solvent, such as dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, and the like. Boc20 is added to the solution at 0 to 50°C, preferably 10 to 30°C, and stirred for 1 to 5 hours, preferably 2 to 4 hours.<br>
A peptide bond formation can be carried out in a manner similar to that of the above-described method A - First step.<br>
Method B - Second step<br>
A deprotecting reaction for an amino group can be carried out as follows, When the protecting group is t-butyloxycarbonyl, a compound represented by a general<br>
- &amp;--<br>
formula (XI) is dissolved in a solvent, such as ethyl acetate, and the like. 1 to 4 N hydrochloric acid-ethyl acetate solution is added to that solution at -10 to 30°C, preferably in ice. The resultant mixture is stirred at the same temperature for 1 to 5 hours, preferably 2 to 3 hours.<br>
The resultant deprotected substance can be subjected to a peptide bond formation similar to that of method A -First step, thereby obtaining a compound represented by the general formula (VI).<br>
In the production method, a compound represented by the general formula (V-A) or (V-B) is preferably L-threonine or D-threonine (R1 = methyl). Further, compounds represented by the general formulas (VII-A), (VII-B), (II-A), (II-B), (I-A), (I-B), (III-A), (III-B), (IV-A), (IV-B), and (VI) are also preferably compounds derived from L-threonine or D-threonine.<br>
As R2, benzyl is preferable. As R3 and Y, methyl is preferable.<br>
