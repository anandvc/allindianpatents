				<td>Process for the enzymatic preparation of<br>
enantiomerically enriched -amino acids<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the<br>
preparation of enantiomerically enriched p-amino acids. The<br>
invention relates also to advantageous esters of P-amino<br>
acids and to the use thereof in a process for the enzymatic<br>
preparation of enantiomerically enriched p-amino acids.<br>
Optically active P-aminocarboxylic acids occur in natural<br>
substances such as alkaloids and antibiotics, and the<br>
isolation thereof is becoming increasingly of interest, not<br>
least because of their increasing importance as essential<br>
intermediates in the preparation of medicaments (see, inter<br>
alia: E. Juaristi, H. Lopez-Ruiz, Curr. Med. Chem. 1999, 6,<br>
983-1004) . Both the free form of optically active -amino-<br>
carboxylic acids and derivatives thereof exhibit<br>
interesting pharmacological effects and can also be used in<br>
the synthesis of modified peptides.<br>
As preparation methods for p-aminocarboxylic acids there<br>
have hitherto become established conventional racemate<br>
cleavage via diastereoisomeric salts (proposed route in: H.<br>
Boesch et al., Org. Proc. Res. Developm. 2001, 5, 23-27)<br>
and, especially, the diastereoselective addition of lithium<br>
phenylethylamide (A. F. Abdel-Magid, J. H. Cohen, C. A.<br>
Maryanoff, Curr. Med. Chem. 1999, 6, 955-970). The latter<br>
method has been intensively researched and is preferably<br>
employed, despite numerous disadvantages that occur<br>
therewith. On the one hand, stoichiometric amounts of a<br>
chiral reagent are required, which represents a major<br>
disadvantage compared with catalytic asymmetric methods.<br>
Furthermore, expensive and, additionally, dangerous<br>
auxiliary substances, such as, for example, n-butyllithium,<br>
are required to activate the stoichiometric reagent by<br>
deprotonation. In addition, for satisfactory stereo-<br>
selectivity it is important to carry out the reaction at<br><br>
low temperatures of about -70°C, which means high demands<br>
on the reactor material, additional costs and high energy-<br>
consumption .<br>
Although the preparation of optically active -amino-<br>
carboxylic acids by biocatalytic means plays only a<br>
secondary role at present, it is desirable especially on<br>
account of the economic and ecological advantages of<br>
biocatalytic reactions. It is not necessary to use<br>
stoichiometric amounts of a chiral reagent, and there are<br>
used instead small, catalytic amounts of enzymes, which are<br>
natural and environmentally friendly catalysts. In addition<br>
to their catalytic properties and their high activity, such<br>
biocatalysts, which are used efficiently in an aqueous<br>
medium, have the advantage, in contrast to a large number<br>
of synthetic metal-containing catalysts, that it is<br>
possible to dispense with the use of metal-containing,<br>
especially heavy-metal-containing and hence toxic<br>
substances.<br>
In the prior art, the enantioselective N-acylation of -<br>
aminocarboxylic acids, for example, has already been<br>
reported many times.<br>
For example, in Tetrahedron: Asymmetry, Vol. 7, No. 6,<br>
p. 1707-1716, 1996, L.T. Kanerva et al. describe the<br>
enantioselective N-acylation of ethyl esters of various<br>
alicyclic -aminocarboxylic acids with 2, 2 , 2-trif luoroethyl<br>
ester in organic solvents and Lipase SP 52 6 from Candida<br>
antarctica or Lipase PS from Pseudomonas cepacia as<br>
biocatalyst.<br>
V.M. Sanchez et al. studied the biocatalytic racemate<br>
cleavage of (±)-ethyl-3-aminobutyrate (Tetrahedron:<br>
Asymmetry, Vol. 8, No. 1, p. 37-40, 1997) with lipase from<br>
Candida antarctica via the preparation of the N-acetylated<br>
-aminocarboxylic acid ester.<br><br>
EP-A-8 890 649 discloses a process for the preparation of<br>
optically active amino acid esters from racemic amino acid<br>
esters by enantioselective acylation with a carboxylic acid<br>
ester in the presence of a hydrolase selected from the<br>
group amidase, protease, esterase and lipase, and<br>
subsequent isolation of the unconverted enantiomer of the<br>
amino acid ester.<br>
WO-A-98/50575 relates to a process for obtaining a chiral<br>
-aminocarboxylic acid or its corresponding esters by<br>
bringing a racemic p-aminocarboxylic acid, an acyl donor<br>
and penicillin  acylase into contact under conditions in<br>
order to acylate an enantiomer of the racemic -amino-<br>
carboxylic acid stereoselectively, wherein the other<br>
enantiomer is substantially unconverted, and a chiral -<br>
aminocarboxylic acid is thus obtained.<br>
The reverse reaction sequence has also been studied (V. A.<br>
Soloshonok, V. K. Svedas, V. P. Kukhar, A. G. Kirilenko,<br>
A. V. Rybakova, V. A. Solodenko, N. A. Fokina, O. V. Kogut,<br>
I. Y. Galaev, E. V. Kozlova, I. P. Shishkina, S. V.<br>
Galushko, Synlett 1993, 339-341; V. Soloshonok, A. G.<br>
Kirilenko, N. A. Fokina, I. P. Shishkina, S. V. Galushko,<br>
V. P. Kukhar, V. K. Svedas, E. V. Kozlova, Tetrahedron:<br>
Asymmetry 1994, 5, 1119-1126; V. Soloshonok, N. A. Fokina,<br>
A. V. Rybakova, I. P. Shishkina, S. V. Galushko, A. E.<br>
Sochorinsky, V. P. Kukhar, M. V. Savchenko, V. K. Svedas,<br>
Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 1995,, 6, 1601-1610; G. Cardillo,<br>
A. Tolomelli, C. Tomasini, Eur. J. Org. Chem. 1999,<br>
155-161). A disadvantage of that process is that the<br>
product mixture is difficult to work up following the<br>
enantioselective hydrolysis. After separating off the free<br>
-aminocarboxylic acid there is obtained a mixture of<br>
phenylacetic acid and N-phenylacetyl--aminocarboxylic acid<br>
which is difficult to separate.<br>
In order to obtain enantiomerically enriched carboxylic<br>
acids, it has long been known to react them with lipases.<br><br>
In US5518903, that principle has been transferred to N-<br>
protected -amino acid esters, but with varying degrees of<br>
success. While only the corresponding benzyl ester of<br>
racemic N-butoxycarbonyl--aminobutyric acid could be<br>
cleaved in a highly enantioselective manner by means of a<br>
lipase, the remaining methyl esters and n-butyl esters used<br>
yielded ee values only in the region of 70%. It is to be<br>
noted that a transition from a corresponding methyl ester<br>
to an n-butyl ester is evidently accompanied by a fall in<br>
the ee value of the acid prepared. For example, ester<br>
hydrolysis starting from the n-butyl ester of N-Boc-<br>
aminobutyric acid with the enzyme lipase from Asahi gives<br>
an ee value of the corresponding acid of 45%ee after 8 days<br>
in 37% yield. Using Lipase PS from Amano, a compound<br>
enriched to 61%ee is obtained in the same reaction within a<br>
period of 7 days with a yield of 41%. By comparison, the<br>
corresponding methyl ester yields 70%ee.<br>
The results recently published by Faulconbridge et al. show<br>
that the ester hydrolysis of aromatic -amino acid ethyl<br>
esters at pH 8 with Lipase PS from Amano takes place with<br>
acceptable yields and very good enantiomeric excesses<br>
(Tetrahedron Letters 2000, 41, 2679-81) . The product is<br>
obtained with an enantiomeric purity of up to 99%, but the<br>
synthesis, which was carried out solely in suspension, is<br>
associated with some disadvantages. On the one hand, it has<br>
been found that, although the crystallisation is selective<br>
under those conditions, the reaction itself, as documented<br>
in Comparison Example 1, leads to lower ee values of 85.1%<br>
ee. Overall, this means, on the one hand, a loss of yield<br>
owing to the formation of the undesired enantiomer and, on<br>
the other hand, that the ee value, in dependence on slight<br>
process variations, may easily fall below 99% ee or even<br>
below 98% ee on a commercial scale owing to changed<br>
crystallisation conditions. However, as high an ee value as<br>
possible, of &gt;98% ee, especially &gt;99% ee, is a requirement<br>
for pharmaceutical applications. Moreover, it would also be<br><br>
desirable to carry out the reaction in a homogeneous medium<br>
(no suspension!) in order to be able to ensure good enzyme<br>
separation by ultrafiltration. Optimally, a high ee value<br>
should also be obtained in that step, which cannot be<br>
achieved with the literature processes known hitherto. The<br>
object of the present invention was, therefore, to provide<br>
a further process for the enzymatic preparation of amino<br>
acids. In particular, it should be possible to use the<br>
process advantageously on a commercial scale from economic<br>
and also ecological points of view, that is to say the<br>
process should stand out especially in respect of<br>
environmental compatibility, safety in the workplace and<br>
the robustness of the process, and also the space/time<br>
yield and selectivity.<br>
This and other objects, which are not mentioned in greater<br>
detail but are apparent in an obvious manner from the prior<br>
art, are achieved by a process having the features of<br>
claim 1 according to the subject-matter. Dependent claims 2<br>
to 8 relate to preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention. Claim 9 is directed towards novel esters of -<br>
amino acids, and the advantageous use thereof in the<br>
present process is protected, in claim 10.<br>
Because a process for the preparation of enantiomerically<br>
enriched N-unprotected -amino acids by enzymatic<br>
hydrolysis of an enantiomeric mixture of N-unprotected -<br>
amino acid esters with a hydrolyase is carried out with the<br>
proviso that no corresponding methyl or ethyl ester is<br>
used, the object which has been set out is achieved in a<br>
very surprising, but no less advantageous, manner.<br>
Hitherto, only methyl or ethyl esters of the N-unprotected<br>
amino acids have been used for the reaction in question,<br>
but such esters are associated with the disadvantages<br>
already mentioned above. A better result both in terms of<br>
the space/time yield and in terms of selectivity is<br>
obviously obtained when bulkier ester groups having, for<br><br>
example, (C3-C8)-alkyl radicals are used for the enzymatic<br>
hydrolysis. That is to be regarded on the one hand as<br>
surprising in view of US 5518903 (sic) discussed above, on<br>
the other hand the trend is unexpected because, with a more<br>
rapid reaction, the probability of enantiodifferentiation<br>
generally decreases. This logical connection is<br>
illustrated, for example, if the generally lower<br>
enantioselectivities at higher reaction temperatures - at<br>
which the reaction accordingly proceeds more rapidly - are<br>
considered.<br>
In principle, the person skilled in the art is free to<br>
choose the ester group. When making his choice, he will be<br>
guided by economic and reaction-related considerations.<br>
Advantageous alcohols for forming the ester are especially<br>
those which can readily be removed from the reaction<br>
mixture. They are alcohols such as alkyl alcohols or aryl<br>
alcohols, optionally low-boiling phenol or benzyl alcohol.<br>
The -amino acid alkyl esters or -amino acid aryl esters<br>
r<br>
obtainable with those alcohols are therefore preferably<br>
used in the hydrolysis. Very particular preference is given,<br>
to the use of corresponding n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl,<br>
sec-butyl, isobutyl or tert-butyl esters of the -amino<br>
acids.<br>
The person skilled in the art is also free to choose the<br>
reaction parameters. They will be determined separately for<br>
each individual case by means of routine experiments. In<br>
any case, a suitable pH range for the enzymatic process<br>
according to the subject-matter is from 4 to 10,preferably<br>
from 6 to 9 and more preferably from 7 to 8.5. Lipase PS<br>
from Amano has proved to be particularly suitable at about<br>
pH 8.<br>
With regard to the temperature, the requirements are in<br>
principle the same as for the pH value. In this case too,<br>
an optimum temperature can be determined for each<br>
individual case, according to which enzyme works optimally<br><br>
at which temperature. For enzymes from thermophilic<br>
organisms, high temperatures up to 100°C are possible.<br>
Other enzymes work optimally only at 
optionally in an ice matrix. The temperature that is set<br>
during the reaction should preferably be in the range from<br>
15 to 40°C, more preferably from 20 to 3 0°C.<br>
The person skilled in the art is responsible for choosing<br>
the enzyme to be used. Many suitable enzymes can be chosen<br>
from Enzyme Catalysis in Organic Synthesis, Ed. : K. Drauz,<br>
H. Waldmann, VCH, 1995, p. 165 and the literature cited<br>
therein. A lipase is preferably employed for the ester<br>
hydrolysis, more preferably Lipase PS from Amano from<br>
Pseudomonas cepacia is used.<br>
The polypeptide in question can be used in free form as a<br>
homogeneously purified compound, or in the form of an<br>
enzyme prepared by recombinant methods. The polypeptide may<br>
also be used as part of an intact host organism or in<br>
conjunction with the cell mass of the host organism broken<br>
down and highly purified as desired.<br>
It is also possible to use the enzymes in immobilised form<br>
(Sharma B. P.; Bailey L. F. and Messing R. A. (1982),<br>
Immobilisierte Biomaterialien - Techniken und Anwendungen,<br>
Angew. Chem. 94, 836-852). Immobilisation is preferably<br>
effected by lyophilisation (Paradkar, V. M.; Dordick, J. S.<br>
(1994), Aqueous-Like Activity of -Chymotrypsin Dissolved<br>
in Nearly Anhydrous Organic Solvents, J. Am. Chem. Soc.<br>
116, 5009-5010; Mori, T.; Okahata, Y. (1997), A variety of<br>
lipi-coated glycoside hydrolases as effective glycosyl<br>
transfer catalysts in homogeneous organic solvents,<br>
Tetrahedron Lett. 38, 1971-1974; Otamiri, M.; Adlercreutz,<br>
P.; Matthiasson, B. (1992), Complex formation between<br>
chymotrypsin and ethyl cellulose as a means to solubilize<br>
the enzyme in active form in toluene, Biocatalysis 6,<br>
291-305) . Very particular preference is given to<br>
lyophilisation in the presence of surface-active<br>
substances, such as Aerosol OT or polyvinylpyrrolidone or<br><br>
polyethylene glycol (PEG) or Brij 52 (diethylene glycol<br>
mono-cetyl ether) (Kamiya, N.; Okazaki, S.-Y.; Goto, M.<br>
(1997), Surfactant-horseradish peroxidase complex<br>
catalytically active in anhydrous benzene, Biotechnol.<br>
Tech. 11, 375-378).<br>
Most preferred is immobilisation on Eupergit®, especially<br>
Eupergit C® and Eupergit 250L® (R6hm) (as overview see: E.<br>
Katchalski-Katzir, D. M. Kraemer, J. Mol. Catal. B: Enzym.<br>
2000, 10, 157). Also preferred is immobilisation on Ni-NTA<br>
in combination with the polypeptide modified by attachment<br>
of a His tag (hexa-histidine) (Petty, K.J. (1996), Metal-<br>
chelate affinity chromatography in: Ausubel, F.M. et al.<br>
eds. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 2, New<br>
York: John Wiley and Sons).<br>
Use in the form of CLECs is also possible (St. Clair, N.;<br>
Wang, Y.-F.; Margolin, A. L. (2000), Cofactor-bound cross-<br>
linked enzyme crystals (CLEC) of alcohol dehydrogenase,<br>
Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 39, 380-383).<br>
By means of these measures it may be possible to generate<br>
from polypeptides that become unstable owing to organic<br>
solvents, polypeptides that are able to work in mixtures of<br>
aqueous and organic solvents or in wholly organic media.<br>
The reaction according to the subject-matter can be carried<br>
out in any reaction vessel provided therefor. Such reaction<br>
vessels are, in detail, normal batch reactors, loop<br>
reactors or an enzyme-membrane reactor (Bommarius, A. S.;<br>
Drauz, K.; Groeger, U.; Wandrey, C; Membrane Bioreactors<br>
for the Production of Enantiomerically Pure a-Amino Acids,<br>
in: Chirality in Industry (eds.: Collins, A. N.; Sheldrake,<br>
G. N.; Crosby, J.) 1992, John Wiley &amp; Sons, p. 371-397).<br>
The esters to be used in the reaction according to the<br>
invention sometimes exhibit poor solubility in an aqueous<br>
reaction medium. In such cases it may be advantageous,<br>
depending on the solvent tolerance of the enzymes used, to<br>
add water-soluble organic solvents to the reaction mixture<br><br>
in order to obtain a homogeneous reaction phase. Suitable<br>
as such water-soluble organic solvents are, inter alia:<br>
acetone, DMF, ethanol, methanol.<br>
However, the reaction is also possible at higher substrate<br>
concentrations with formation of a suspension.<br>
In the case of the use of enzymes which are optionally-<br>
adsorbed on water-insoluble carrier materials or<br>
accompanying substances or stabilisers, it has proved<br>
advantageous to separate off the insoluble carrier or<br>
accompanying substance or the stabiliser before the enzyme<br>
is used in the reaction, so that there is no contamination<br>
of the product that is to be precipitated by the insoluble<br>
carrier material of the enzyme used, provided separation of<br>
the enzyme and the carrier is possible in a simple manner.<br>
For example, Lipase PS from Amano, which is advantageously<br>
to be used, is adsorbed on silica carriers. Before the<br>
reactants are added to the reaction medium, filtration of<br>
the aqueous enzyme solution should therefore be carried out<br>
in order to remove the silicas from the reaction system.<br>
This procedure does not adversely affect the activity or<br>
process stability of the enzyme.<br>
The invention also provides -amino acid n-propyl esters<br>
having the following structure (I)<br><br>
wherein<br>
R represents (C1-C8) -alkyl, (C2-C8)-alkenyl, (C2-C8) -alkynyl,<br>
(C3-C8)-cycloalkyl, (C6-C18)-aryl, (C7-C19) -aralkyl, (C3-C18) -<br>
heteroaryl, (C4-C19) -heteroaralkyl, ( (C1-C8)-alkyl) 1-3-<br>
(C3-C8)-cycloalkyl, ( (C1-C8)-alkyl) 1-3-(C6-C18)-aryl, ( (C1-C8)-<br>
alkyl) 1-3- (C3-C18) -heteroaryl,<br><br>
R' represents H, (C1-C8)-alkyl, (C2-C8) -alkenyl, (C2-C8)-<br>
alkynyl, (C3-C8) -cycloalkyl, (C6-C18) -aryl, (C7-C19)-aralkyl,<br>
(C3-C18)-heteroaryl, (C4-C19)-heteroaralkyl, ((C1-C8)-<br>
alky)1-3-(C3-C8)-cycloalkyl, ( (C1-C8) -alkyl) 1-3- (C6-C18) -aryl,<br>
( (C1-C8) -alkyl) 1-3- (C3-C18) -heteroaryl.<br>
Very particularly advantageous compounds are those in which<br>
R represents an aromatic radical, especially phenyl,<br>
thienyl, furyl, pyridyl, and the derivatives thereof mono-<br>
or poly-substituted on the aromatic ring, especially with<br>
(C1-C8)-alkyl or (C1-C8)-alkoxy as substituents and in which<br>
R' represents a H.<br>
3-Amino-3-phenylpropionic acid n-propyl ester may be<br>
mentioned as an example of a representative of this type of<br>
compound that is of particular interest.<br>
The invention relates also to the use of the above-<br>
mentioned compounds in a process according to the<br>
invention.<br>
Within the scope of the invention, "N-unprotected" is<br>
understood to mean that the -nitrogen atom of the acid is<br>
not blocked by a N-protecting group that is stable under<br>
the reaction conditions. Such protecting groups are to be<br>
regarded as being especially the usual protecting groups<br>
such as Z, Boc, Fmoc, Eoc, Moc, acetyl, etc..<br>
(C1-C8)-Alkyl is to be regarded as being methyl, ethyl,<br>
n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl,<br>
tert-butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl or octyl, including all<br>
isomers due to different positions of the double bond. They<br>
may be mono- or poly-substituted by (C1-C8) -alkoxy, (C1-C8)-<br>
haloalkyl, OH, halogen, NH2, NO2, SH, S-(C1-C8)-alkyl.<br>
(C3-C8)-Alkyl is to be regarded accordingly.<br>
(C2-C8)-Alkenyl is to be understood as being a (C1-C8)-alkyl<br>

Experimental examples:<br>
Example 1 (= comparison example):<br>
9.2 mmol of the racemic compound rac-3-amino-3-phenyl-<br>
propionic acid ethyl ester (1.79 g) are taken up in 50 ml<br>
of water, and the solution is adjusted to a pH value of<br>
pH 8.2 by means of automatic pH metering by addition of 1 M<br>
sodium hydroxide solution (obtained from Merck). In order<br>
to dissolve the ester without residue, 3 ml of acetone are<br>
also added for dissolution. When a reaction temperature of<br>
20°C is reached, 200 mg of Amano Lipase PS (Pseudomonas<br>
cepacia; obtained from Amano Enzymes, Inc.) are added in<br>
order to start the reaction. After a reaction time of 3 and<br>
6 hours, the rate of conversion and, after 6 hours, the<br>
enantioselectivity of the resulting (S)-3-amino-3-phenyl-<br>
propionic acid are determined. A conversion of 18.5% after<br>
3 hours and 37.8% after 6 hours and an enantioselectivity<br>
of 85.1% ee (after 6 hours) are determined. The conversion<br>
and enantioselectivity were determined by HPLC.<br>
Example 2:<br>
9.2 mmol of the racemic compound rac-3-amino-3-phenyl-<br>
propionic acid n-propyl ester (1.91 g) are taken up in<br>
50 ml of water, and the solution is adjusted to a pH value<br>
of pH 8.2 by means of automatic pH metering by addition of<br>
1 M sodium hydroxide solution (obtained from Merck). In<br>
order to dissolve the ester without residue, 3 ml of<br>
acetone are also added for dissolution. When a reaction<br>
temperature of 20°C is reached, 2 00 mg of Amano Lipase PS<br>
(Pseudomonas cepacia; obtained from Amano Enzymes, Inc.)<br>
are added in order to start the reaction. After a reaction<br>
time of one hour, the rate of conversion and, after 3<br>
hours, the enantioselectivity of the resulting (S)-3-amino-<br>
3-phenylpropionic acid are determined. A conversion of<br><br>
48.7 % after one hour and an enantioselectivity of 96.4% ee<br>
(after 3 hours) are determined. The conversion and<br>
enantioselectivity were determined by HPLC.<br>
Example 3:<br>
8.63 mmol of the racemic compound rac-3-amino-3-phenyl-<br>
propionic acid n-butyl ester (1.91 g) are taken up in 50 ml<br>
of water, and the solution is adjusted to a pH value of<br>
pH 8.2 by means of automatic pH metering by addition of 1 M<br>
sodium hydroxide solution (obtained from Merck). In order<br>
to dissolve the ester without residue, 3 ml of acetone are<br>
also added for dissolution. When a reaction temperature of<br>
20°C is reached, 200 mg of Amano Lipase PS (Pseudomonas<br>
cepacia; obtained from Amano Enzymes, Inc.) are added in<br>
order to start the reaction. After a reaction time of<br>
3 hours, both the rate of conversion and the enantio-<br>
selectivity of the resulting (S)-3-amino-3-phenylpropionic<br>
acid are determined. A conversion of 45.2 % and an<br>
enantioselectivity of 96.8% ee are determined. The<br>
conversion and enantioselectivity were determined by HPLC.<br>
Example 4:<br>
81 ml of water are placed in a vessel, and 1.45 g of Amano<br>
Lipase PS (Pseudomonas cepacia; obtained through Amano<br>
Enzymes, Inc.) are added thereto. The undissolved solid is<br>
then filtered off. 81 ml of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE)<br>
as organic solvent component are added to the aqueous<br>
enzyme solution obtained as filtrate. The resulting two-<br>
phase system is adjusted to pH 8.2 by means of automatic pH<br>
metering by addition of 1 M sodium hydroxide solution<br>
(obtained through Merck). When a temperature of 20°C is<br>
reached, 188.2 mmol of the racemic compound rac-3-amino-3-<br>
phenylpropionic acid n-propyl ester (39.0 g) are added, and<br><br>
the reaction is started. The reaction time is 15 hours,<br>
during which a white precipitate consisting of the desired<br>
product (S)-3-amino-3-phenylpropionic acid forms. After a<br>
reaction time of 15 hours, 160 ml of acetone are added to<br>
complete the precipitation, stirring is then carried out<br>
for about 45 minutes, and the solid is filtered off. The<br>
solid is washed several times with a small amount of<br>
acetone and is then dried in vacuo. 12.91 g of the desired<br>
(S)-3-amino-3-phenylpropionic acid are obtained,<br>
corresponding to a yield of 41.6%. The enantioselectivity<br>
for the product is 99.6% ee. The enantioselectivity was<br>
determined by HPLC. The chemical purity was determined as<br>
98.8% (determined by titration). The structure of the<br>
product was additionally confirmed by NMR spectroscopy.<br><br>
