Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a recording medium and methods and apparatuses of<br>
recording and reproducing from the recording media.<br>
Background Art<br>
An optical disk has been widely used as an optical recording medium to record large amounts<br>
of data. Recently, a blu-ray disc (BD) has been introduced as a high density digital video<br>
disc (HD-DVD) for recording high definition video data and superior sound quality audio<br>
data for many hours.<br>
The BD has been spotlighted as a next generation of HD-DVD and as a next generation<br>
optical recording solution for storing more data than a conventional DVD. Standardizing<br>
technical specifications of the BD has been in progress.<br>
Accordingly, an optical recording apparatus for the BD has been developed based on the<br>
technical specifications of the BD. However, there are many difficulties in developing the<br>
optical recording apparatus for the BD since the technical specifications of the BD are not<br><br>
completely standardized.<br>
For effectively reproducing data recorded in the BD and/or for a user's convenience, various<br>
auxiliary data (AUX data) such as text subtitle information may be provided along with the<br>
main AV data. Also, the information should be managed effectively for reproducing the<br>
main AV data and sub- or auxiliary data.<br>
However, unified standards for the auxiliary data such as a text subtitle have not been<br>
completely provided. Therefore, there are many obstacles to develop the optical recording<br>
apparatus for the BD.<br>
Prior publication, viz., "Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Subtitling Systems, final draft ETSI EN<br>
300 743, i.e. XP 014001876 published by IEEE, 20020601 LIS, Sophia Antipolis CEDEX, France-<br>
ISSN 0000-0001, Vol. BC, Nr: V1.2.1 does not suggest "text box positioning information for<br>
positioning a text box in the region". D1 merely discloses "region_horizontal_address" and<br>
"region_vertical_address" (7.2.1). The region of Dl is different from "a text box in the region" as<br>
claimed. Thus, DVB does not teach "a text box in the region" and "text box positioning information".<br>
Moreover, DVB also fails to suggest "the region style identifier identifying one of the sets of style<br>
information in the style segment to apply to the text subtitle data". DVB discloses "region_id" within<br>
the region composition segment (7.2.2). The region_id identifies only a region for which information is<br>
contained in the region composition segment. In other words, the region_id identifies a region related<br>
with the corresponding region composition segment. However, "the region style identifier" is in the<br>
present segment, and identifies one of style information in another segment (i.e., style segment). Thus,<br>
the region style identifier is different from the regionid of DVB.<br><br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to example embodiments of the present invention,<br>
which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference<br>
numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.<br>
In the present invention, a main data is title information recorded in an optical disk and<br>
includes video and audio data which are provided to a user from a disk author. Generally, the<br>
video and audio data is recorded based on the MPBG2 format and is called as a main AV<br>
stream or main data.<br>
Auxiliary data represents data related to the main data that is provided to a user for<br>
conveniently reproducing the main data. The auxiliary data includes subtitle information,<br>
interactive graphic stream, presentation graphic stream, sound information and additional<br>
audio data having a browserble slide show. According to characteristics of the auxiliary data,<br>
the auxiliary data are recorded based on a MPEG2 format by multiplexing with the main AV<br>
stream or the auxiliary data are recorded as stream files independent from the main AV<br>
stream based on the MPEG2 format or any other suitable formats.<br><br>
The subtitle as the auxiliary data is generally a closed caption displayed at a predetermined<br>
region of a display with video images generated by reproducing a main AV data. When a<br>
user wants to reproduce a main AV data with a subtitle in a desired language, the language of<br>
the subtitle is displayed at a region of the display with the video image by selecting the<br>
language of the subtitle among subtitles in various languages provided by the optical disk.<br>
Accordingly, the subtitle may be provided in various formats. Specially, a subtitle recorded<br>
with text data is a text subtitle.<br>
Hereinafter, a recording format of the main data and the auxiliary data including the text<br>
subtitle data recorded in the optical disk and a file structure for managing the main data and<br>
the auxiliary data will be explained in detail by referring to FIGs. 1 and 2.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a file structure for managing various data on a disc in accordance with an<br>
example embodiment of the present invention. As shown, at least one BD directory BDMV<br>
exists beneath one root directory. In the BD directory BDMV, an index file index.bdmv and<br>
an object file MovieObjectbdmv are included as general file (upper file) information to<br>
secure interactivity with a user. Moreover, a playlist directory PLAYLIST, clipinfo directory<br>
CLIPINF, stream directory STREAM, and auxiliary data directory AUXDATA are included<br>
in the BD directory BMD V.<br>
Files for video and audio streams, which are called 'main AV stream', recorded in a disc<br>
according to specific formats and auxiliary stream such as text subtitle (hereinafter called text<br>
subtitle stream) independently exist in the stream directory STREAM. Because the text<br><br>
subtitle streams files and AV stream files are recorded in the MPEG2 format (e.g., MPEG2<br>
transport packets), '*.m2ts' is used the extension name of each stream file (e.g., 01000.m2ts,<br>
02000.m2ts, and 10001.m2ts). Alternatively, in case of the text subtitle stream file, '*.txtst'<br>
may be used as the file extension name since the text subtitle stream has auxiliary data<br>
features different from that of the main AV stream, for example.<br>
In the BD specifications, the AV stream may be called a clip stream file. Relating to the<br>
present invention, the text subtitle data will exist in the form of a separate file from the AV<br>
stream file. For example in FIG. 1, the text subtitle data exists as the text subtitle stream file<br>
10001.m2ts or 10001.txtst.<br>
The clipinfo (or clip information) directory CLIPINF includes clip information or clipinfo<br>
files *.clpi, each having a one-to-one correspondence with a stream file. A clipinfo file *.clpi<br>
has attribute information and timing information of the corresponding stream file and serves<br>
as a management file. More specifically, the information in the clipinfo file includes mapping<br>
information that enables mapping of a Presentation Time Stamp (PTS) to a Source Packet<br>
Number (SPN) of a source packet in the corresponding stream file. This map is referred to as<br>
an Entry Point Map or "EP_map".<br>
A stream file and the corresponding clipinfo file may be called a "clip", collectively.<br>
Accordingly, the file "01000.clpi" in the clipinfo directory CLIPINF has attribute information<br>
and timing information on the file "01000.m2ts" in the stream directory STREAM, and the<br>
files "01000.clpi" and "01000.m2ts" form a clip.<br><br>
The playlist directory PLAYLET includes playlist files *.mpls, each having at least one<br>
playitem Playltem designating a playing interval of a particular clip. The playitem Playltera<br>
includes timing information on a play start time In-Time and play end time Out-Time of a<br>
particular clip for playback, and identifies the clip by providing the clip information file name<br>
in a Clip_Information_File_name field. Using the PTS information in the In-Time and Out-<br>
time information, the EP map of the named clipinfo file allows a particular stream address or<br>
position (e.g., SPN) of the corresponding stream file to be searched for and obtained such that<br>
reproduction of the playitem results in reproduction of the clip.<br>
The playlist file *.mpls serves as a basic management file for playing a <br>
providing at least one playitem Playltem. Moreover, the playlist file <br>
a sub-playitem SubPlayltem for managing reproduction of, for example, supplemental <br>
which may be reproduced synchronized or non-synchronized (e.g., a browsable slide show)<br>
with the playitem Playltem. For instance, in case of including SubPlayltem for <br>
text subtitle, the corresponding SubPlayltem is synchronized with the <br>
the data. Yet, in case of including SubPlayltem for playing back audio data for a browsable<br>
slide show, the corresponding SubPlayltem is non-synchronized with Playltem.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, auxiliary data including text subtitles is managed<br>
by SubPlayltems for example, which will be explained in detail below.<br>
The auxiliary data directory AUXDATA is an area for separately recording auxiliary data<br>
files for the playback. For instance, in order to support more user-friendly playback, a sound<br><br>
file Sound.bmdv for providing a click sound, a font file *.font or *.otf employed with text<br>
subtitle playback, and the like are recorded therein.<br>
Accordingly, the text subtitle stream 10001.m2ts, which is a kind of auxiliary data, may be<br>
recording in the auxiliary data directory AUXDATA<br>
Moreover, in the above-explained BD directory BDMV, the index file index.bdmv and the<br>
object file MovieObject.bdmv exist as general files to secure interactivity with a user. The<br>
index file index.bdmv has an index table providing menu information and title information<br>
the user can select. The MovieObject.bdmv provides navigation commands for, for example,<br>
executing a playlist, and may be called from a selection made in the index table,<br>
FIG. 2 shows a format of the file structure and related information recorded in the optical<br>
disk. The optical disk includes a file system information area, a database area and a stream<br>
area. System information for managing files is recorded in the file system information area.<br>
In the database area, the playlist file (*.mpls) and the clip information files (*.clpi) for<br>
reproducing the recorded stream files (*.m2ts), the index file (index.bdmv), and the object<br>
file (MovieObjectbdmv) are recorded. Also, the main data and the auxiliary data are<br>
recorded in the stream area. As mentioned above, the main data includes audio, video and<br>
graphic data and the auxiliary data includes the text subtitle. Also, the auxiliary data is<br>
recorded as an independent file separate from the main data in the stream area. That is, the<br>
auxiliary data is recorded in the stream area without being multiplexed with the main data.<br>
Accordingly, the user decides a method for reproducing the main data and the auxiliary data<br><br>
based on information stored in the database area and in the stream area.<br>
Hereinafter, the file structure of a text subtitle stream file will be explained in detail.<br>
Additionally, a method for defining management information for reproducing the text subtitle,<br>
a method for constructing the file structure of the text subtitle stream file including the<br>
defined management information, and a method and an apparatus for reproducing the stream<br>
file will be explained in detail.<br>
FIG. 3 shows a display simultaneously displaying a text subtitle stream and the main AV<br>
stream in single video frame. That is, it shows that the text subtitle displayed with the single<br>
video frame generated by reproducing the main AV stream and timely synchronizing, in time,<br>
the text subtitle with the generated video frame.<br>
FIG. 4 is a diagram showing a file structure with file information for explaining a method for<br>
managing reproduction of a text subtitle in accordance with an example embodiment of the<br>
present invention. The text subtitle is managed by a subplayitem in a playlist and one<br>
subplay item manages reproduction of a plurality of text subtitle clips.<br>
As shown, the playlist file includes at least one or more playitems managing reproduction of<br>
the main AV clip. In case that there is one or more text subtitles related to the main AV data,<br>
the text subtitle(s) is managed as a subplay item. For example, FIG. 4 shows an English text<br>
subtitle clip 1 and a Korean subtitle clip 2 in a playlist file, and shows that subtitle clipl and<br>
subtitle clip 2 are synchronized, in time, with the main AV data. Namely, a subtitle clip is<br>
displayed with the main AV data at a target presentation time.<br><br>
Accordingly, management information about the target presentation time, a position and a<br>
size of the subtitle are provided for reproducing the text subtitle. Hereinafter, the<br>
management information for reproducing the text subtitle will be explained in detail.<br>
FIGs. 5A to 5C show a reproduced main AV stream with related subtitle displayed on a<br>
display for explaining management information recorded in a text subtitle stream. FIG. 5A<br>
shows dialog information, FIG, 5B shows region information and FIG. 5C shows style<br>
information.<br>
FIG. 5A shows the dialog information as the management information for managing<br>
reproduction of the text subtitle. A dialog information is management information for<br>
managing at least one or more text data at a presentation time.<br>
That is, the presentation time is a time for reproducing corresponding subtitle and it is<br>
expressed as PTS. By defining text subtitles displayed at a PTS as the dialog, the subtitles<br>
are conveniently managed for reproduction.<br>
For example, if the text subtitle is displayed as two lines at PTS(k) and PTS(k+1), the text<br>
subtitle is defined as identical dialog. In one embodiment, the text subtitle data in a single<br>
dialog is less than 100 character codes.<br>
FIG. SB shows region information among the management information. ' The region is<br>
information about constructing the dialog at a presentation time. Also, the region represents a<br>
region in a single video frame where global style information is identically applied. In one<br>
embodiment, a single dialog has at most two regions, That is, in this embodiment, the dialog<br><br>
may be constructed with a single region or with two regions.<br>
The reason for defining at most two regions in the single dialog is to adjust the workload of<br>
decoding when the text subtitle is reproduced. However, the number of regions may be<br>
defined as a maximum n number (n &gt;= 2) in other embodiments.<br>
FIG. 5C shows the style information of the management information. The style information<br>
is information about assigning a method for displaying the text subtitle and includes style<br>
information such as a position of the subtitle, a size and a background color. Also, a text<br>
alignment or a text flow may be provided as the style information.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the style information is divided into global style<br>
information and local style information for displaying the text subtitle in various ways.<br>
The global style information is style information identically applied to the regions and it<br>
includes a position of each region and a size of each region. This information may be called<br>
a region_styles. FIG. 5C shows the two different region style information (region_styles) are<br>
applied to two regions (regions #1 and #2). The region_styles of "positionl, sizel,<br>
color=blue" is applied to the region 1 (region #1). Also, the region_styles of "position2,<br>
size2, color=red" is applied to the region #2.<br>
The local style information is style information applied according to each text data line in a<br>
region or according to each text data character. This information may be called<br>
"inline_styles", That is, inline_styles may be style information defined for a text data when<br>
the region_styles is modified.<br><br>
For example, in FIG. 5C, "inline style information (inline_styles)" is applied to the region #1<br>
and different inline_styles is applied to "mountain" among the text data.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates a structure of a text subtitle stream file. For example, FIG. 6 shows the<br>
structure of the text subtitle stream file "10001.m2ts" of FIG. 1.<br>
In this embodiment, the text subtitle stream is constructed as a MPEG2 transport stream. The<br>
transport stream includes a plurality of transport packets and an identical packet identifier<br>
(PID) is assigned to the transport packets (TP) such as "PID=x18xx". Accordingly, the<br>
optical reproducing method or apparatus effectively extracts the text subtitle stream from an<br>
input stream by extracting only transport packets assigned with "PID=0X18xx".<br>
Also, a single packet elementary stream (PES) includes a plurality of transport packets TPs.<br>
In this embodiment, a single PES is formed per each dialog and thus, the dialog is effectively<br>
reproduced.<br>
Also, the first packet elementary stream (PES) in the text subtitle stream includes a dialog<br>
style unit DSU (alternatively referred to as a dialog style segment DSS), which includes a set<br>
of regions styles. And, the second and succeeding packet elementary streams each include a<br>
dialog presentation unit DFU (alternatively referred to as a dialog presentation segment DPS),<br>
which contains real dialog information.<br>
Accordingly, the dialog information defined in FIGs. 5A to 5C includes the DPU, and style<br>
information of dialog information includes inline style information (inline styles) and linking<br>
information (region_style_id) linking to one of various regions styles defined in the DSU.<br><br>
In one embodiment, the dialog style unit includes .a maximum, number of region styles sets.<br>
For example, the dialog style unit includes maximum 60 region styles sets and they are<br>
distinguished by unique region style identification (region_style_id) assigned to each region<br>
styles set.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates a dialog style unit (DSU) and a dialog presentation unit (DPU) included in a<br>
text subtitle stream in accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention. The<br>
syntax of the text subtitle stream will be explained later with respect to FIG. 8.<br>
In this embodiment, the dialog style unit (DSU) includes a maximum of 60 region styles sets<br>
and the regions styles sets are distinguished by the region style identification<br>
(region_style_id). The region style set includes various region styles and a user changeable<br>
style set, and the region style sets are recorded according to the region style identification.<br>
The syntaxes for region style information and the user changeable style set will be explained<br>
in detail below with respect to FIG. 10A.<br>
The dialog presentation unit (DPU) includes text data and PTS set, which is a set of<br>
presentation times of the text data. The DPU also includes style information applied to each<br>
region. Therefore, the DSU includes region_style_id for linking region style information to a<br>
corresponding region.<br>
As shown in FIG. 7, DPU#1 includes dialog presentation information of single region. A<br>
region style applied to text data #1 is region style set #k in the DPU since the DPU#1<br>
includes the Region_style_id=k for linking the DPU #1 To the corresponding region style set.<br><br>
The DPU #2 include two regions. The first region of text data #1 is assigned with a region<br>
style set #k (Region_style_id=k). Also, a region style #n is applied to the text data #2 of the<br>
second region since the region style linking information of the regjon2 of the DPU #2 is<br>
Region_style_id=n. Similarly, region style set #n and region style set #m are applied to<br>
DPU#3 and DPU#4, respectively.<br>
The style information linked by the region_style_id is identically applied to the text data in<br>
corresponding region, which is the global style information. In case that a text string in the<br>
text data is modified according to special style information, local style information is applied<br>
to the corresponding text string.<br>
Hereinafter, the syntaxes of the DSU and the DPU will be explained.<br>
FIG. 8 shows the syntax of a text subtitle stream (Text_Subtitle_stream()) in accordance with<br>
an example embodiment. As shown in FIG. 8, the text subtitle stream<br>
(Text_Subtitle_stream()) includes a single DSU(dialog_style_unit()) defining a style<br>
information set and a plurality of DPUs (dialog _presentation_ unit()) containing dialog<br>
information. That is, a function Text_Subtitle_stream() includes a function<br>
dialog_style_unit() and a function dialog presentation_unit(). The text subtitle stream is<br>
recorded by the function Text_Subtitle_stream() and the recorded text subtitle stream is<br>
constructed with a single DSU defined by the function dialogjstylejunitO and a plurality of<br>
the DPUs defined by the function dialog_presentation_unit().<br>
FIG. 9 shows the syntax of a dialog style unit (DSU). As mentioned above, the DSU is<br><br>
defined by the function dialog_style_unit() and FIG. 9 shows a detailed structure of the<br>
function dialog_style_unit(). As shown in FIG. 9, the dialog_style_unit() includes a function<br>
dialog_styleset(). The function dialog_styleset() defines a style information set corresponding<br>
to the dialog. Accordingly, the DSU includes style information set having various style<br>
information for the corresponding dialog.<br>
Hereinafter, various embodiments of the present invention for defining the style information<br>
set (dialog_styleset()) will be explained. The embodiments are divided according to a<br>
method for defining a standard position of text data and a size of the dialog. FIGs. 10A to<br>
12C show functions and diagrams for explaining a first embodiment, FIGs. 13A to 13C<br>
illustrate functions and diagrams for explaining a second embodiment and FIGs. 14A to 14G<br>
depict functions and diagrams for explaining a third embodiment.<br>
FIG. 10A to FIG. 12C shows functions and diagrams for defining a style information set of a<br>
dialog by a function dialog_styleset() in accordance with a first embodiment of be present<br>
invention. The first embodiment for defining the style information set is <br>
defining text box information assigning a size and a reference position of the text in a<br>
region.<br>
FIG. 10A shows a detailed structure of the dialog_styleset() syntax defined in the function<br>
dialog_style_unit() of FIG. 9 in accordance with the first embodiment of the present<br>
invention. In the function dialog_styleset(), a flag player_style_flag, a<br>
number_of_region_styles, a number_of_user_styles, a function user_changeable_styleset()<br><br>
and a function palette() are provided in addition to a function a region_style() for defining<br>
region style information of a dialog. The flag player_style_flag indicates whether<br>
modification of style information by a user is allowed and the function<br>
user_chageable_styleset() provides a modification range of the style information. The<br>
function palette() provides color information.<br>
The region style information is the global style information defined according to each region<br>
as mentioned above. A unique identification (region_style_id) is assigned to each of region<br>
style information. Therefore, the region style information of the dialog is provided based on<br>
a style information set corresponding to the assigned identification region_style_id.<br>
Accordingly, by recording the identification region_styie_id applied to the dialog in the DPU,<br>
the dialog is reproduced by applying the style information set defined based on the identical<br>
region_style_id in the dialog_styleset() when the dialog is produced.<br>
Hereinafter, the style information (Style Info) included in the style information set provided<br>
according to the region_style_id will be explained.<br>
At first, as information for defining a position and a size of corresponding region in a image<br>
frame, region_horizontal_position, region_vertical_position, region_width and region_height<br>
are provided. Also, region_bg_color_entry_id is provided for defining a background color of<br>
the corresponding region.<br>
Secondly, text box information is provided for representing a size of a text box in the<br>
corresponding region. The text box represents a region where the text data is displayed in the<br><br>
corresponding region.<br>
The size of the text box is set forth by text_box_width and the_box_height. An origin of the<br>
corresponding text box in a region is provided by text_ box_horizontal_position and<br>
text_box_vertical_position.<br>
Furthermore, text_flow is defined for defining a direction for displaying text and<br>
text_alignment is defined for defining a direction for aligning text such as right, left and<br>
. middle. In case of text_flow, each region in the corresponding dialog is defined to have<br>
identical text_flow when were are plural of regions in the dialog for preventing confusion of<br>
the user.<br>
By referring to FIGs 11A to 12C, provision of the text box information according to the<br>
text_flow and the text_alignment will be explained in detail below.<br>
A line_space is defined for controlling the space between lines in a corresponding region as<br>
style information included in the style information set. Also, a font_id, a font_style, a<br>
font_size and a font_color_entry_id are defined as font information for controlling text data<br>
in the corresponding region.<br>
The player_style_flag in the dialog_styleset() is information representing whether style<br>
information of a reproducing apparatus is applicable. For example, if the player_style_flag is<br>
set as lb (player_style_ilag=1b), it allows use of the style information of the reproducing<br>
apparatus for reproducing the text subtitle besides using style information defined in the<br>
dialog_styleset(). If the player_style_flag is set as 0b (Player_style_flag = 0b), the text<br><br>
subtitle is reproduced by only using the style information defined by the dialog_styleset().<br>
FIG. 10B shows the function "user_changeable _styleset()" defined in the function<br>
"dialog_styleset()"in FIG. 10A.<br>
By referring to FIG. 10B, the function user_cbangeable_styleset() defines types and a<br>
modification range of style information which can be modified by a user. Accordingly, the<br>
function "user_changeable_styleset()" is used for conveniently modifying the style<br>
information of the text subtitle data by the user.<br>
However, in this embodiment, the style information modifiable by the user is limited to a<br>
size of a font and a position of a region. Therefore, region_horizontal_position_direction,<br>
region_horizontal_position_delta,	region_veratical_position_direction,	region_<br>
vertical_position_delta, font_size_inc_dec and font_size_delta are defined in the function<br>
user_changeable_styleset(). Since a position of a text box and a space between lines are<br>
changed according to increase/decrease of a font size, variables for defining the line space<br>
and the text box position are defined in the function user_changeable_styleset().<br>
As mentioned above, the function user_changeable_styleset() is defined according to the<br>
region_style_id and a plurality of user modification style information (user_style_id) are<br>
defined in the function user_changeable_styleset(). For example, if the function<br>
user_changeable_styleset() is defined according to the regions_style_id=k, a maximum of 25<br>
user modification style information are defined in the defined function<br>
user_changeable_styleset() in this example embodiment.<br><br>
The region_ horizontal_osition_direction and the region_vertical_position _direction are<br>
provided for defining a direction of moving a region_horizontal_position and a<br>
region_vertical_position, which can be modified according to the user_style_id. Also, the<br>
region_horizontal_position_delta and region_vertical_position_ delta are provided for<br>
defining a one time modification for moving a region in each direction in a modification<br>
amount of a pixel unit.<br>
For example, if the region_horizontal_position_ direction is defined as 0, the corresponding<br>
region is moved to right. If the region_horizontal_position_direction is defined as 1, the<br>
corresponding region is moved to left. Also, if the region_vertical_position_direction is<br>
defined as 0, the corresponding region is moved down.	If the<br>
region_vertical_position_direction is defined as 1, the corresponding region is moved up.<br>
Also, a font_size_inc_dec is provided for defining a direction of increasing/decreasing of the<br>
font size, which is changeable according to the user_style_id; and a font_size_delta is<br>
provided for assigning a one time modification amount of the font_size in a unit of a pixel.<br>
For example, if the font_size_inc_dec is defined as 0, it means increase the font_size and if<br>
the font_size_inc_dec is defined as 1, it means decrease the fontjsize.<br>
Furthermore, a text_box_horizontal_position and a text_box_vertical_position are provided<br>
for defining a reference position of the text box changed according to the increase/decrease of<br>
the font_size. The text_box_horizontal_position and the text_box_vertical_position may be<br>
defined by an identical method providing the region_horizontal_position and the<br><br>
region_vertical_position. For example, the text_box_horizontal_ position and the<br>
text_box_vertical_position are recorded for assigning the changing direction and a<br>
text_box_horizontal_position_delta and a text_box_vertical_position_delta are recorded for<br>
assigning one time modification amount in a unit of a pixel.<br>
Also, a text_box_width and a text_box_height, which are changed according to<br>
increase/decrease of the font_size, may be provided identically to the above mentioned case<br>
of the font_size, For example, a text_box_width_inc_dec and a text_box_height_inc_dec are<br>
recorded for assigning an increase/decrease direction, and a text_box_width_delta and a<br>
text_box_height_delta are recorded for assigning a one time modification amount in a unit of<br>
a pixel.<br>
Moreover, increase/decrease of a text line space (line_space), which is changed according to<br>
increase/decrease of the font_size, may be defined identically to the method defining<br>
increase/decrease of the font_size. That is, a line_space_ inc__dec and a lint_space_delta are<br>
recorded.<br>
FIGs. 11A and 11B show examples of displaying a text box according a<br>
text_box_horizontal_position, a text_box_vertical_position and a text_flow defined according<br>
to the first embodiment of the present invention shown in FIG. 10A.<br>
That is, FIG. 11A shows mat the text_box_horizontal_position, the<br>
text_box_vertical_position and the text_flow are defined to display the text data with respect<br>
to the origin of the region (e.g., offset from the origin of the region) and without respect to<br><br>
the text_flow. In this case, an origin of the text data becomes the left-top (also referred to as<br>
the upper left corner) of the text box without respect to the text alignment or text_flow.<br>
FIG. 11B shows the display of text data in a textbox based on the<br>
text_box_horizontal_position, the text_box__vertical_position and the text_flow when the<br>
text_flow is top to bottom.<br>
As with the previous embodiment of FIG. 11 A, the textbox is defined with respect to the<br>
origin of the region. In this case, an origin of the text data becomes the left-top of the text<br>
box without respect to the text alignment.<br>
FIGs. 12A to 12C show another example of displaying a text box according a<br>
text_box_horizontal_position, a text_box_ vertical_position and a text_fiow defined<br>
according to the first embodiment of the present invention shown in FIG. 10A.<br>
That is, FIG. 12A shows that the text_box_ horizontal_position, the<br>
text_box_vertical_position and the text_flow are defined to display the text data at left-top<br>
when the text_fiow is left to right. FIG. 12B shows that the text_box_ horizontal_position,<br>
the text_box_veitical_position and the text_flow are defined to display the text data at right-<br>
top when the text_fiow is right to left. FIG. 12C shows that the text_box_<br>
horizontal_position, the text_box_vertical_position and the text_flow are defined to display<br>
the text data at right-top when the text_fiow is top to bottom.<br>
As shown in FIGs. 12A to 12C, the origin of the text data is changed to the left-top to the<br>
right-top according to the text_flow without respect to the text alignment<br><br>
FIG. 13A shows a function dialog_styleset() defined in the function dialog_style_unit() in<br>
accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention. The second embodiment of<br>
the dialog_s1yle_unit() records text padding information instead of the text box information.<br>
That is, for defining a size of the text data in the region, the text padding information is<br>
recorded as the region style information. The text padding information includes a<br>
padding_top, a padding_bottom, a paddingjeft and a padding_right. By the text padding<br>
information, an entire size of the text data in the region may be confirmed.<br>
Information except the text padding information are identical to the first embodiment.<br>
Therefore, detailed explanation is omitted.<br>
HO. 13B shows a position of the text data in a region having text padding information. A<br>
position of the text data in the region is confirmed according to the padding_top, the<br>
padding_bottom, the paddingjeft and the padding_right, which are defined in the<br>
dialog_styleset() of the second embodiment.<br>
FIG. 14A shows a function dialog_styleset() defined in the function dialog_style_unit() in<br>
accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention. The third embodiment of the<br>
dialog_styleset() records a text_horizontal_position and a text_yertical_position instead of<br>
text box information and the text padding information, and the text_horizontal_position and<br>
the text_vertical_position are changed according to the text_alignment.<br>
That is, the text_horizontal_position and the text_vertical_position are recorded for<br>
representing a reference position of the text data in the region. The reference position is<br><br>
defined to be modified according to the text_alignment such as left, center and right.<br>
Information, except the text_horizontal_position and the text_vertical_position are identical to<br>
the first embodiment Therefore, detailed explanations are omitted.<br>
FIGs. 14B to 14D shows positions of the text data if the text flow is left to right or right to<br>
left, and the text_alignment is defined as left (FIG. 14B) a center (FIG. 14C) or right (FIG.<br>
14D).<br>
That is, if the text_alignment is defined as the left as shown in FIG. 14B, the<br>
text_horizontal_position and the text_vertical_position are defined as assigning a left position<br>
where a first line of the text data is started. If the text_alignment is defined as the center as<br>
shown in FIG. 14C, the text_horizontal_position and the text_vertical_position are defined to<br>
assigning a center position where a first line of the text data is started. If the text_alignment<br>
is defined as the right as shown in FIG. 14C, the text_horizontal_position and the<br>
text_vertical_position are defined as assigning a right position where a first line of the text<br>
data is ended.<br>
FIGs. 14E to 14G shows positions of the text data if the text flow is top to bottom, and the<br>
tcxt_alignment is defined as top(left) (FIG. 14E) a center (FIG. 14F) and a bottom(right) (FIG.<br>
14G).<br>
If the text_alignment is defined as top as shown in FIG. 14E, the text__horizontal_position and<br>
the text_vertical_position are defined to assign a top position where a first line of the text data<br>
is started. If the text_alignment is defined as the center as shown in FIG. 14F, the<br><br>
text_horizontal_position and the text_vertical_position are defined to assign a center position<br>
where a first line of the text data is started. If the text_atignment is defined as the bottom as<br>
shown in FIG. 14G, the text_horizontal_position and the text_vertical_position are defined as<br>
assign a bottom position where a first line of the text data is ended.<br>
As mentioned above, the text data is displayed with the main AV stream the display by<br>
defining the reference position where the text data box or the text data is recorded according<br>
to one of the first, the second and the third embodiments.<br>
Hereinafter, a method for reproducing the above mentioned text subtitle stream file and<br>
displaying the reproduced text subtitle stream file will be explained by referring to FIGs. 15<br>
to 18.<br>
FIG. 15 is a diagram illustrating information included in the dialog presentation unit (DPU)<br>
and the dialog style information unit (DSU). As mentioned above, the DSU includes a set of<br>
region style information applied to each region in each dialog and the DPU includes dialog<br>
text information and presentation information.<br>
The dialog text information includes a region style identifier defining style information<br>
applied to each region, a text string and inline style information applied to the text string.<br>
The region style identifier is information for linking a corresponding region to region style<br>
information in the dialog style information unit (DSU).<br>
The presentation information in the DPU includes a presentation time stamp (PTS) start time<br>
(PTS_start) and a presentation time stamp end time (PTS_end) for displaying each dialog, a<br><br>
palette update information (palette_update_flag) for changing colors used during display of<br>
the dialog and modified palette information (Palette for update) when there is color<br>
modification.<br>
That is, the text subtitle stream is constructed with the dialog style information in the DSU<br>
and the dialog presentation information in the DPU. And, the information included in the<br>
DSU and the DPU are classified into three types of information according to functions of the<br>
information. In other words, the information is classified into dialog text information<br>
including a text string; composition information including times for display, positions of the<br>
dialog and modification of color, and rendering information for converting text information<br>
to graphic information.<br>
As mentioned above, information in the DSU is used as the composition information and as<br>
the rendering information. As shown in FIG. 15, information of "Region horizontal position",<br>
"region vertical position" is used as the composition information since the "region horizontal<br>
position" and the "region vertical position" represents position of a region in a displayed<br>
image. Also, the information "region width &amp; height", "Font &amp; background colors", "Text<br>
flow &amp; alignment", and "Font name, style &amp; size" are used as the rendering information since<br>
the information are used for expressing texts according to each region of each dialog. Also,<br>
the information "text position" such as text box information, text padding information and<br>
text horizontal/vertical reference position information are included in the rendering<br>
information.<br><br>
Hereinafter, a method and an apparatus for reproducing a text subtitle including the<br>
reproducing management information will be explained.<br>
FIG. 16 is a diagram illustrating an optical disk reproducing apparatus including a decoding<br>
unit 40 for reproducing the text subtitle in accordance with an example embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 16, the optical disk reproducing apparatus includes a micro-computer 3, a<br>
system decoder 4, a PID filter 5, an audio decoding unit 10, a video decoding unit 20, a<br>
graphic decoding unit 30, a subtitle decoding unit 40, a selecting unit 6 and a mixing unit 50.<br>
The system decoder 4 decodes signals reproduced from an optical disc into a AV stream (e.g.,<br>
MPEG stream) under the control of the micro-coputer 3. While not shown for the of<br>
clarity, the micro-computer 3 also controls the other elements of the apparatus based on input<br>
received from a user (e.g., via control buttons on the apparatus or a remote control) and<br>
management information, such as described above, reproduced from the optical disk. The<br>
PID filter 5 receives the AV stream and from the system decoder 4 extracts the separate<br>
streams that are present such as a video stream, an audio stream, a graphic stream and a text<br>
subtitle stream based on a packet identifier (PID) such as in the transport packets of an<br>
MPEG stream. The video decoding unit 20 receives the extracted video stream from the PID<br>
filter 5 and decodes the extracted video stream for reproducing the extracted video stream.<br>
The audio decoding unit 10 receives the extracted audio stream from the PID filter 5 and<br>
decodes the extracted audio stream for reproducing the extracted audio stream. The graphic<br><br>
decoding unit 30 receives the extracted graphic stream from the PID filter 5 and decodes the<br>
extracted graphic stream for reproducing the extracted graphic scream. Also, the text subtitle<br>
decoding unit 40 receives the extracted text subtitle stream from the PID filter 5 and decodes<br>
the extracted text subtitle stream for reproducing the extracted text subtitle stream.<br>
The optical disk reproducing apparatus may also or instead receive the text subtitle from an<br>
external source. Therefore, the optical disk reproducing apparatus of this embodiment may<br>
further include a selecting unit 6 for selecting an input source for the text subtitle decoding<br>
unit 40.<br>
If the text subtitle is recorded with the main data based on a MPEG format, the input source<br>
is the PID filter 5. Accordingly, the selecting unit 6 selects the PID filter 5 as the input<br>
source of the text subtitle stream and the selecting unit 6 transfers the extracted text subtitle<br>
stream from the PID filter 5 to the text subtitle decoding unit 40, which is shown as A in FIG.<br>
16. If the optical disk reproducing apparatus receives the text subtitle from an external source,<br>
the selecting unit 6 selects the external source as the input source of the text subtitle stream<br>
and the selecting unit 6 transfers the text subtitle stream from the external source to the text<br>
subtitle decoding unit 40, which is shown as B in FIG. 16.<br>
The video decoding unit 20, the audio decoding unit 10 and the graphic decoding unit 30<br>
each include a transport buffers 11, 21, 31, respectively, for buffering the video, the audio<br>
and the graphic streams. The video decoding unit 20 also includes a video decoder 22 and a<br>
video plane 23 for reading the extracted video stream stored in the transport buffer 21,<br><br>
decoding the extracted video stream and generating a video plane based on the decoded video<br>
data, which is single video image frame for display on a display. The graphic decoding unit<br>
30 also includes a graphic decoder 32 and a graphic plane 33 for decoding the extracted<br>
graphic stream stored in the transport buffer 31 and generating a graphic plane based on the<br>
decoded graphic data, which is single graphic image frame for display with the generated<br>
video plane. The graphic decoding unit 30 further includes a color look up table (CLUT) 34.<br>
The CLUT 34 includes vales for controlling a color and a transparency of the generated<br>
graphic plane for overlapping the graphic plane with the video plane.<br>
The text subtitle decoding unit 40 includes a preloading buffer 41, a TXT-ST decoder 42, a<br>
graphic plane (GP) 43 and a CLUT 44. The text subtitle decoding unit 40 receives the text<br>
subtitle data from the selecting unit 6 and the received text subtitle data is preloaded in the<br>
preloading buffer 41. Generally, a size of single test subtitle data including reproducing<br>
management information is about 0.5 Mbyte. Therefore, a capacity of the preloading buffer<br>
41 should be more than 0.5 Mbyte. For providing seamless reproducing, the capacity of the<br>
preloading buffer 41 should be much more than 0.5 Mbyte. For example, the size of the<br>
preloading buffer 41 may be standardized by considering the size of the text subtitle data.<br>
The text subtitle data is preloaded in the preloading buffer 41 because of following a reason.<br>
The text subtitle data may be recorded in a separate file since a size of entire text subtitle is<br>
comparatively small. By providing a separate file of the text subtitle, it can be easily read<br>
and effectively used for reproducing the text subtitle. Also, controlling the buffer is more<br><br>
convenient by preloading the entire subtitle data in the preloading buffer 41.<br>
The text subtitle (TXT-ST) decoder 42 reads the text subtitle data stored in the preloading<br>
buffer 41 and decodes the text subtitle data. The graphics plane 43 generates a subtitle<br>
graphic plane, which is a single subtitle image frame for display with the graphic plane and<br>
the video plane, by using the decoded text subtitle data. A color and a transparency of the<br>
subtitle graphic plane are controlled according to values in the CLUT 44 for overlapping the<br>
subtitle graphic plane with the graphic plane and the video plane.<br>
The mixing unit 50 of the optical disk reproducing apparatus includes two adders 52 and 53<br>
for mixing signals output from the video decoding unit 20, the graphic decoding unit 30 and<br>
the text subtitle decoding unit 40 and for generating video image frames with corresponding<br>
graphic planes and subtitles. That is, the mixing unit 50 receives the video plane generated<br>
by the video decoding unit 20, the graphic plane generated by the graphic decoding unit 30<br>
and the subtitle plane generated by the text subtitle decoding unit 40 and generates the single<br>
video image frame with corresponding subtitle by overlapping the video plane, the graphic<br>
plane and the subtitle graphic plane. Basically, the video plane becomes a background of the<br>
single video image frame. The graphic plane and the subtitle graphic plane are overlapped<br>
on the video plane. The order of overlapping is determined according to characteristics of the<br>
graphic plane and the subtitle graphic plane. For example, if the graphic plane is a<br>
presentation graphic, the graphic plane is overlapped on the video plane by the adder 52 in<br>
the mixing unit 50 first. The subtitle graphic plane generated by the text subtitle decoding<br><br>
unit 40 is overlapped on the output of the adder 52 by the adder S3 of the mixing unit 50. By<br>
contrast, if the graphic plane from the graphic decoding unit 30 is an interactive graphic, the<br>
subtitle graphic plane is overlapped on the video plane by the adder 52 in the mixing unit 50<br>
at first, and then the graphic plane is on the output of the adder 52 by the adder 53 of the<br>
mixing unit 50.<br>
Hereinafter, a method for reproducing a text subtitle by using the text subtitle decoding unit<br>
40 based on the text subtitle decoder 42 will be explained in detail.<br>
FIG. 17 is a diagram illustrating the text subtitle decoding unit 40 in accordance with an<br>
example embodiment of the present invention. Like reference numbers of the FIGs. 16 and<br>
17 represent identical functional blocks.<br>
Hereinafter, reproducing a title according to an embodiment of the present invention will be<br>
explained in detail by referring FIGs, 1 to 16 and FIG. 17.<br>
When an optical disk is loaded, the optical disk reproducing apparatus reads and stores file<br>
information for reproducing and managing reproduction of information. When a user<br>
requests to reproduce a title recorded in the optical disk, the optical disk reproducing<br>
apparatus reproduces the playlist related to the title. For example, if the playlist shown in<br>
FIG. 4 is reproduced, the optical disk reproducing apparatus reproduces the main AV data<br>
managed by the playitem by using the video and the audio decoding units 10 and 20. Also, a<br>
text subtitle stream managed by the subplayitem is stored in the preloading buffer 41 and a<br>
font file is extracted from the optical disk according to the font information assigned by the<br><br>
text subtitle stream. The extracted font file is stored in a font preloading buffer 410. For<br>
example, if the user selects Korean subtitle among the text subtitle streams managed by the<br>
subplayitem, 'Text subtitle Clip 2" is stored in the preloading buffer 41. Simultaneously, the<br>
font file aaaaa.font is extracted according to the font information assigned in the clip<br>
information of the "Text Subtitle Clip 2" and me font file aaaaa.font is stored in the font<br>
preloading buffer 410. After extracting and storing the corresponding text subtitle stream,<br>
the text subtitle decoding unit 40 decodes the text subtitle stream for generating the subtitle<br>
graphic plane and transfers the generated subtitle graphic plane to the mixing unit 50 for<br>
displaying the subtitle with the video image frame generated by processing the main video<br>
data managed by the playitem.<br>
The decoding of the text subtitle stream is classified into three steps. In the first step, the text<br>
subtitle stream is separated according to a purpose. That is, the composition information,<br>
rendering information and the dialog text information are separated from the text subtitle<br>
stream. This act of separating data is commonly called parsing.<br>
In the second step, the text data included in the dialog text information is rendered as bitmap<br>
data by using the rendering information. This is called rendering.<br>
In the third step, the rendered text data is added in the graphic plane based on the composition<br>
information. That is, the bitmap data is added to the graphic plane for reproducing the text<br>
subtitle. This is called composition.<br>
To perform the parsing step, the text subtitle decoder 42 includes a text subtitle (TXT_ST)<br><br>
processor 421 that stores the separated composition information and the rendering<br>
information in a dialog composition buffer (DCB) 425, and stores separated dialog text<br>
information in a dialog buffer (DB) 422.<br>
To perform the rendering step, the text subtitle decoder 42 includes a text renderer 423 and a<br>
dialog presentation controller (DP) 426. As discussed above, in mis step, the text data among<br>
the separated dialog text information is rendered to bitmap data. The text renderer 423<br>
receives the font information applied to the text data from the font preload buffer 410 and the<br>
rendering information applied to the text data from the DP controller 426. Then, the text<br>
renderer 423 renders the text data to bitmap data by using the inline style information applied<br>
to each text string of the text data. After rendering, the bitmap data is stored in a ap<br>
object buffer (BOB) 424.<br>
The "object" stored in the BOB 426 is text data of each region in the dialog that has been<br>
converted to bitmap.<br>
Also, the rendering step may be performed by at least two methods. As a first method, the<br>
text data may be rendered after confirming the origin where the text data is to be displayed<br>
according one of the first, the second and the third embodiments for determining a position of<br>
the text data in the region, that are shown in FIG. 10A to 140. As a second method, the text<br>
data is rendered at first and then the rendered text data is arranged with respect to the origin<br>
of the region according to one of the first, the second and the third embodiments shown in<br>
FIGs. 10A to 14G.<br><br>
For the composition step, the text subtitle decoder 42 includes the DP controller 426 arranges<br>
the bitmap object stored in the BOB 424 in the graphic plane 43 according to the composition<br>
information. The palette information among the composition information is inputted to the<br>
CLUT 44 and used for controlling modification of the color and transparency. Then, the<br>
generated subtitle graphic plane is transferred to the mixing unit 50 in FIG. 16 for mixing the<br>
subtitle graphic plane with the video plane to generate the video image frames with the<br>
subtitle.<br>
As mentioned above, a user may change the style information in the rendering step and the<br>
composition step. In this case, the DP controller 426 receives user input and performs the<br>
rendering and the composition based on the user input. But, it may be preferable to limit<br>
style information to be changed by the user since if the user changes all style information, the<br>
text subtitle may be reproduced incorrectly. That is, the style information to be changed by<br>
the user may be limited to the region position and the font size.<br>
FIG. 18 is a view showing the decoding the text subtitle by the parsing step, the rendering<br>
step and the composition step in accordance with an example embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
That is, the rendering step is performed by using the rendering information and the dialog text<br>
information separated in the parsing step and the composition step is performed for arranging<br>
the bitmap object generated by the rendering step using the composition information<br>
separated in the parsing steps.<br><br>
As mentioned above, the text subtitle stream file is recorded in the optical disk as<br>
standardized information according to the method for constructing the text subtitle stream file<br>
in the high density optical disk of the present invention. Also, the text subtitle recorded in the<br>
optical disk is effectively reproduced according to the method and the apparatus for<br>
reproducing the text subtitle of the present invention.<br>
