The sulfonamide compound represented by the formula (3) ;<br><br>
wherein R1 to R4 are the same meanings as defined above (hereinafter, simply referred to as the sulfonamide compound (3)), which is useful as an intermediate of sulfonylurea herbicides, can be produced by reacting the sulfonyl chloride compound (2) thus obtained with ammonia.<br>
The process for producing the sulfonamide compound (3) will be illustrated below.<br>
The organic layer containing the sulfonyl chloride<br><br>
compound (2) obtained in the step (C) may be used as it is, and the sulfonyl chloride compound (2) may be isolated from the organic layer to be used. The sulfonamide compound (3) can be produced in a good yield even though the organic layer is used as it is. The sulfonamide compound (3) can also be produced in a good yield by using the sulfonyl chloride compound (2) isolated without purifying by a conventional means such as column chromatography.<br>
As ammonia, an aqueous ammonia water may be used and ammonia gas may be used. Ammonia gas is preferably used. When the aqueous ammonia water is used, the concentration thereof is not particularly limited and cone, aqueous ammonia water is preferably used.<br>
The amount of ammonia to be used is usually 1 mole or more relative to 1 mole of the sulfonyl chloride compound (2), and there is no specific upper limit. When the aqueous ammonia water is used as ammonia, it is preferably 10 moles or less relative to 1 mole of the sulfonyl chloride compound (2).<br>
The reaction of the sulfonyl chloride compound (2) and ammonia is usually conducted in an inert solvent on the reaction. Examples of the inert solvent on the reaction include water; an ether solvent such as diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran; an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent such as toluene, xylene, mesitylene, chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene; an aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent such as pentane, hexane, heptane and<br><br>
cyclhexane; a nitrile solvent such as acetonitrile and propionitrile; and an alcohol solvent such as methanol and ethanol. The inert solvents may be used alone and in a form of mixture-<br>
The reaction temperature is usually -60 to 100°C. The reaction time is usually 0.5 to 24 hours.<br>
The reaction may be conducted under ordinary pressure condition and under pressurized condition.<br>
The progress of the reaction can be confirmed by a conventional analytical means such as gas chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography.<br>
After completion of the reaction, for example, the sulfonamide compound (3) can be isolated as the solid by, if necessary, adding water to the reaction mixture, conducting neutralization, and filtrating. The sulfonamide compound (3) isolated may be further purified, for example, by a conventional purification means such as washing and recrystallization.<br>
