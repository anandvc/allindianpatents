APPARATUS FOR AND METHOD OF BENDING GLASS SHEETS<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for and a method of bending glass sheets, and more particularly to the bending of glass sheets in which there is an initial gravity bending step and a subsequent press bending step. The apparatus and method are particularly useful for bending automotive glass sheets for subsequent laminating, for example for the manufacture of automotive windshields.<br>
Glass for the windows of vehicles is normally curved, the curvature being imparted to planar glass by a bending process. In one such bending process planar glass sheets are placed upon female ring moulds and heated to the glass softening point. Each sheet bends ("sags") under its own weight until the periphery of the glass sheet is in contact with the ring mould. Such a bending technique is known as "sag" or gravity bending, and it has been developed over the years so as to bend glass sheets which meet the demands of vehicle manufacturers.<br>
For example, as more deeply bent glass was required, the ring mould was modified by attaching the ends of the mould to the central portion by hinges, the hinged mould ends or wing portions progressively closing as the glass softened and the bend proceeded. This avoided the tendency for the glass sheet to slide relative to the mould during the bend, thereby preventing scratching. Such a mould is commonly termed an articulated mould.<br>
The gravity bending process has been found particularly suitable for the production of glass chat is to be subsequently laminated by combining two sheets of glass with a sheet of interlayer material. The gravity bending process is capable of producing glass to a highroptical quality, and ' it is also possible to bend two sheets of glass simultaneously thereby producing a matched pair of glasses which give an excellent fit on laminating.<br><br>
I<br>
In recent years, developments in vehicle design have required glass of complex curvature, i.e. glass that is bent in two directions generally at right angles to each other. It is not possible to impart more than a very limited degree of complex curvature to a sheet of glass by gravity bending alone.<br>
Furthermore, increased use of automated assembly by vehicle manufacturers demands that tighter dimensional tolerances be met by the glats. The shape of the periphery of the bent pane must be accurate, not only in terms of its two dimensional projection, but also in three dimensions, i.e. the angle of the glass adjacent the periphery must be correct. If this "angle of entry", as it is known to those skilled in the art, is not correct, the bent pane will not fit and seal satisfactorily in the receiving flange of the vehicle bodywork.<br>
Moreover, the optical properties	of the window depend<br>
on the shape of the central region of	the glass which must<br>
therefore  by  accurately  controlled	in  order  that  the<br>
required optical standards may be met.<br>
These requirements, in conjunction with the trend towards deeper, and more complex bends," can no longer be met by glass bent by the gravity bending technique alone. It is now regarded as necessary to complete the bending of such shapes by a subsequent press bending step. This step may only involve a limited part of the area of the bent pane, for instance the areas that, after installation in a vehicle body, will be adjacent the windscreen pillars of said body. In many current vehicle designs, such areas of the pane are required to be more deeply bent, and in this specification, any area of a pane which is required to be more deeply bent<br>
by mean of a subsequent press bending step will be referred  	<br>
to as a deep bend portion.<br><br>
In the press bending step, an upper mould or die is ' lowered onto the upper surface of the glass sheets so that the glass sheets are further bent by the action of the upper mould pressing the sheets against a lower mould. When the press bending step is carried out after initial gravity bending, the lower mould may comprise the gravity bending mould.<br>
Press bending is also employed in the art to bend planar glass sheets without initial gravity bending. However, this can lead to disadvantages in that because the bent profile is achieved by an applied pressing force by squeezing individual sheets between two moulds, the optical and physical properties of the glass sheets can be reduced as compared to gravity bending. Also, stresses may be induced in the glass sheets which can cause breakage or require an additional annealing step to remove them. Accordingly, the apparatus and methods employed in press bending alone i.e. not following a gravity bending step, can be different from those employed in subsequent press bending following initial gravity bending.<br>
EP-A-0338216 discloses an example of such a subsequent press bending step in which a pair of auxiliary upper moulds press the deep end portions of a .pane against the hinged ends of an articulated mould on which the initial gravity bending has taken place. The hinged ends are securely locked in position in the press bending step. The locking of the hinged ends of the articulated mould is provided by a clamping means which comprises a plurality of rotatable operating rods, each rod carrying at its upper end a clamping pawl which is rotated between a clamping position and an unclamping position. In the clamping portion, stopper arms on the articulated ends of the mould are clamped between the clamping pawls and a stopper wail. The clamping means is a relatively complicated arrangement which requires an independent actuator system.  The clamping means<br>
is required to extend through the bottom of the furnace so<br>
r~    -<br><br>
as to be able to engage one after the other the articulated moulds being successively conveyed through the furnace. Each mould is moved on a truck and the clamping means must pass through the bottom wall of the truck so as to engage the mould thereabove. This arrangement, as well as being complicated, suffers from the disadvantage that drafts of air can pass through holes in the bottom of the truck which can lead to unpredictable temperature profiles in the vicinity of the glass on the mould. Accordingly, the disclosed apparatus cannot be used with certain truck configurations. For example in -certain types of glass bending furnaces, in order to ensure a uniform and reproducible ambient temperature in the vicinity of glass sheets on the mould as they are passed through the furnace, the mould is mounted in an open-topped carriage which has a solid base and solid side walls. This can prevent drafts of air from modifying the temperature profile in the vicinity of the mould.<br>
US-A-5045101 discloses that the hinged ends of an articulated mould are provided with a taper ring or a mould extension at portions thereof at which the deep-bending operation is conducted. This presents a relatively large area of contact between the mould and the glass sheet which affects the heat flow from the glass sheet, and can cause excessively high edge stresses to be generated in the glass during the bending operation, leading to potential glass breakage.<br>
US-A-5071461 recognises that it is desirable for the contact area of the surface of the gravity bending mould to be minimized in order to reduce loss of heat capacity. However, this desire to minimise the contact area must be balanced with the requirement for the gravity bending mould to be sufficiently strong so that when the mould is employed in a subsequent press bending step in which an upper mould is pressed against the gravity bent glass sheets on the mould, the gravity bending mould does not distort under the applied pressure, leading to possible glass breakage or an incorrect shape. In addition, with such a minimised contact area, care must be taken that' the thin edges of the gravity<br><br>
"bending mould do not inadvertently mark the underside of the glass sheets during the press bending operation.<br>
A typical apparatus for bending glass sheets comprises a furnace located along a conveyor loop around which carriages, each carrying a respective gravity bending mould, are conveyed. A typical furnace has 20 or more moulds. It is desirable that the structure of each mould be relatively simple in order to minimize the cost and complexity of the apparatus.<br>
A typical gravity bending mould has an annular rim which contacts the glass with with a minimum surface area so as to avoid excessively high edge stesses being inadvertently formed in the glass sheet. Typically, the rim has a thickness of around 3 to 4 mm. However, if such a known gravity bending mould were subjected to a subsequent press bending step in the manner described in the prior art, there is a danger that the mould, as result of it only having a thin annular rim, could be deformed during the press bending step, causing breakage or other damage to the glass sheets, or mark the underside of the glass sheet.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a glass sheet bending apparatus and method which enables substantially conventional gravity be'nding moulds to be employed in a subsequent press bending step. It is a further object of the present invention to enable such moulds to be employed without the requirement for complicated clamping apparatus as required by the prior art.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an apparatus for bending a glass sheet in a gravity bending step and in a subsequent press bending step, the apparatus including a gravity bending mould comprising a fixed mould "portion and at least one articulated wing portion adjacent—r to the fixed mould portion, a base on which the fixed mould • portion is mounted and at least one hinged locking arm mounted between the or each respective wing portion and the<br><br>
base, the at least one locking arm being movable by a camming action from an unlocked position in which the wing portion is capable of moving vertically relative to the base to a locked position in which the wing portion is fixed in position relative to the base.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides a method of manufacturing a bent glass sheet using the apparatus as hereindescribed above said method comprising the step placing at least one glass sheet on a gravity bending mould comprising a fixed mould portion and at least one articulated wing portion adjacent to the fixed mould portion, the mould being mounted on a base on a movable carriage; conveying the mould carrying the at least one glass sheet through a furnace in which the glass is heated to the glass softening point and bends by gravity until the periphery of the glass sheet is in contact with and conforms to the shape of the upper surface of the gravity bending mould, the or each wing portion being provided with a locking arm which, during the gravity bending step, progressively moves as a result of articulation of the mould from an unlocked position to locked position at which the wing portion is fixed in a predetermined position corresponding to the desired shape of the glass sheet; press bending the glass sheet with an upper pressing die while the glass sheet is supported by the gravity bending mould, the locking arm acting to lock respective articulated wing portion in the said predetermined position; cooling the bent glass sheet and removing the bent glass sheet from the mould.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention will now be described by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: -<br>

Fig. 6 shows the apparatus of Fig. 5 during a press bending operation; and<br>
Fig. 7 is an enlarged side view of one of the spacer devices illustrated in Fig. 6.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, there is shown a section through a tunnel furnace 2 for bending glass sheets,. typically a pair of glass sheets 4 which, after the bending operation, are intended to be laminated together in order to manufacture, for example, an automobile windshield. Such a tunnel furnace 2 is well known in the art and consists of an elongate track 6 carrying a succession of wheeled open-topped carriages 8 thereon. Each carriage 8 has a gravity bending ring mould 10 therein, the mould 10 being mounted on a base 12 which is fixed to a solid bottom wall 14 of the carriage 8. The carriage 8 also has an annular, preferably rectangular, side wall 9. The carriages 8 are mounted in succession for cyclical movement around a loop including the furnace 2. The loop includes a glass loading zone, a heating zone in which the heated glass sheets are gravity bent on the gravity bending mould 10, a cooling zone, and a glass unloading zone. The furnace 2 may be provided with other zones, for example an annealing zone, for annealing the glass so as to reduce stresses generated during the bending step, between the heating zone and the cooling zone. It will be understood by the skilled person that although the present invention is exemplified by a box furnace, the present invention can alternatively be employed in any other type of lehr.<br><br>
The present invention is particularly concerned with the manufacture of glass sheets having deep bend portions which cannot readily be achieved by the use of gravity bending alone. In accordance with the invention, a press bending zone is additionally provided in the loop immediately downstream of the gravity bending zone. In the press bending zone, the gravity bent glass sheets are further press bent to a final desired shape by an upper reciprocable mould while the glass sheets are supported on the gravity bending mould.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates glass sheets 4 on the mould 10 in a carriage 8 prior to the gravity bending operation. The carriage 8 is arranged to move along the furnace , 2 in a direction at a right angle to the plane of the drawing. The mould 10 comprises a central fixed mould portion 16 which is mounted to the mould base 12 by a plurality of supports 18. On opposed sides of the central portion 10 of the mould 8 are hingedly mounted respective articulated wing portions^ 20. Although the invention is described with reference to a gravity bending mould having two opposed" wine; portions, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the invention could also utilise a gravity bending mould having only one articulated wing portion. The wing portions 20 are arranged to move by rotation between -a lower position, as shown in Figure 1, wherein the mould 10 is configured to support one or more flat glass sheets 4 on the mould 10, and a higher position at which the wing portions 20 define, together with the central portion 16, a continuous curved annular rim defining a surface to be attained by the glass sheet or sheets 4 when finally bent. The glass sheets 4 are heated as they pass through the heating zone of the furnace 2 so that the glass sheets 4 are progressively softened and sag under the effect of gravity so as to conform to the desired shape as defined by—the mou-ld 10. Above the central portion 16 of the mould, the glass sheets 4 sag until they rest against the upper mould surface thereby conforming to<br><br>
the desired shape. Above the wing portions 20,. the effect of the softening of the glass permits the wing portions 20 to be articulated upwardly under the action of an applied force provided by a pair of counterweights so that each wing portion 20 rotates about a respective pivot axis 22 at the juncture between the central portion 16 and the respective wing portion 20 so that the glass sheets 4 are pushed upwardly and are progressively bent until the bottom surface of the glass sheets 4 rests against the upper surface of the wing portions 20. As will be described hereinafter, when deep bend portions are present in the glass sheets, those portions tend to require to be mechanically pressed against the lower mould by an upper die or mould so that the desired shape defined by the lower mould is reliably and repeatably achieved. It will be apparent that the present invention may employ so-called "weightless" moulds which do not have counterweights but rather are specially configured so that the mould articulates under the action of the weight of the glass as it softens.<br>
A typical mould 10 is illustrated in greater detail in Figure 4. The mould 10 is mounted above the base 12 by the supports 18 which are fixed to the underside of the central portion 16 of the mould 10; The base is sufficiently rigid so as to minimise deflection during the subsequent press bending step. The wing portions 20 are connected to the central portion 16 on opposed sides thereof by respective pivot axes 22. Each wing- portion 20 has mounted thereto on opposed sides thereof a pair of counterweights 24, each counterweight 24 being mounted on a respective arm 26 which is fixed to a respective end 28 of a respective pivot axes 22. The upper surface of the rim 30 of the mould 10 formed by the central portion 16 and the wing portions 20 contacts the underside of the glass sheets 4 and defines a final desired shape for the glass sheets 4. The surface area of the mould 10 contacting the glass sheets 4 is preferably minimized so as to reduce the area availabTe for heat transfer between the glass sheets 4 and the metal mould 10 which can lead to undesirable stresses being present in the finally bent glass sheets 4 and/or visible defects being<br><br>
present in the edges of the glass sheets 4. Such stresses can cause breakage of the glass sheets 4. Typically, it is desired to keep tensile area stresses in the glass sheets to less than 7 MPa. Typically, the annular rim 30 of the mould 10 defined by the upper surfaces of the central portion 10 and the wing portions 20 has a thickness of from about 3 to 4 mm so as to minimise the area of contact between the glass and the mould 10. However, when, in accordance with the present invention, the gravity bending mould 10 is intended to be employed as the lower mould in a subsequent press bending operation, it is required for the lower mould to be sufficiently rigid and strong so that it does not uncontrollably deflect or distort under the action of the applied pressure from the upper press bending mould. It is also required that the thin rim does not mark the underside of the glass during the press bending operation.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the glass sheet bending apparatus is especially adapted so as to permit a conventional sag, bending mould having a relatively thin annular rim to be employed in a subsequent press bending operation whilst ensuring high quality control of the finally bent glass sheet products. The use of such a thin annular rim provides low stresses in the glass as described hereinabove. Modifications have been made to the mould and to remaining parts of the apparatus so as to ensure that the mould reliably ensures that the required final shape is achieved, the mould can withstand the press bending operation and the glass sheets are not inadvertently marked or otherwise deteriorated in quality as a result of the additional press bending operation.<br>
Referring back to Figure 1, the wing portions 20 are<br>
each  provided  with  at  least  one  locking  device 	for	<br>
vertically locking the position of the wing portion during the press bending operation. Optionally, each wing portion has two locking devices although the illustrated embodiment is only provided with one locking device for each wing<br><br>
portion. The locking device comprises a hinged locking arm 32 which is hingedly mounted to the respective wing portion 20 and depends downwardly therefrom so as to be able to slide over the top surface of a plate 34, mounted on the base 12, which provides an upper cam surface.<br>
The locking arm 32/plate 34 assembly is shown in greater detail in Figures 2 and 3. The locking arm 32 comprises a pair of elongate spaced plates 36 which are hingedly mounted at their upper ends to an extension member 38 fixed to the respective wing portion 20, the extension member 38 passing between the plates 36 and the pivotal mounting therebetween comprising a bolt assembly 40. The locking arm 32 depends downwardly from the wing portion 20 and the free bottom end 42 thereof is provided with a cylindrical spacer 44 which is fixed between the plates 36 by a further bolt assembly 46. The cylindrical spacer 44 is clamped between the elongate plates 36 so as to be prevented from rotational movement relative thereto. A further spacer 48 and bolt assembly 50 are provided substantially at the centre of the locking arm 32.<br>
The locking arm 32 is free to pivot relative to the wing portion 20 about the extension member 38 and the lower surface 52 thereof rests on the upper -surface of the plate 34 which comprises an elongate cam surface 54 over which the free bottom end 42 of the locking arm 32 can slide. The cam surface 54 comprises a substantially horizontal portion 56 and an adjacent inclined ramp portion 58. The ramp portion 58 is preferably inclined at an angle of around 20° to the horizontal and if desired the substantially horizontal portion 56 can be slightly inclined to the horizontal by a few degrees in the same sense as the ramp portion 58. The plate 34 is adjustably mounted in an upright configuration to the base 12 via a mounting plate 60 to which the plate 34 . is removably secured by bolt assemblies 62. The plate 34 can readily be adjusted in height and tilt.<br><br>
In Figure 1, the wing portion 20 is shown in its lowered configuration and in this configuration the locking arm 32 is inclined to the horizontal in an unlocked position and the free end 42 thereof rests on the ramp portion 58 of the cam surface 54 of the plate 34. Such a configuration is illustrated in phantom in Figure 2. During the gravity-bending step, the wing portion 20 rotates upwardly under the action of the counterweights 24 which progressively causes the glass sheet to be increasingly bent as it softens on heating. The wing portion 20 moves from the phantom position illustrated in Figure 2 to the position shown by the solid lines in Figure 2. It will be seen that as the wing portion 20 rises during the gravity bending step, the free end 42 of the locking arm 32 slides upwardly along the ramp portion 58 until it reaches the substantially horizontal portion 56 which defines a locking zone 64 for the locking arm 32. The locking arm 32 moves in a plane perpendicular to the pivot axis 22. As is shown in Figure 4, the plate 34 defining- the cam surface 54 is at right angles to the respective pivot axis 22 so that as the wing portion 20 is rotated upwardly about the respective pivot axis 22, the free end 42 of the locking arm 32, and in particular the lower surface 52 of the spacer 44, slides steadily up the ramp portion 58 until the locking arm 32 is substantially vertical, with the free end 42 thereof being positioned in contact with the locking zone 64. As shown in Figure 2, in order to ensure that the locking arm 32 does not inadvertently move laterally off the cam surface 54, a wire 66 connected at opposed ends 68 thereof to respective opposed ends 70 of the plate 34 and which passes between the spaced plates member 36 of the locking arm 32 may be provided.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, the locking arm 32 in its locking position is substantially vertical. Preferably, the height and inclination of the plate 34 is adjusted so that in the locking position the locking arm 3'2 is not quite vertical<br><br>
but is a few degrees slightly inclined tc tne vertical, the inclination being in the same sense as that for the unlocked position. In the locking position the lower surface 52 of the non-rotatable spacer 44 frictionally engages the cam surface 54 in the locking zone 64. Since the locking zone 64 is substantially horizontal and the locking arm 32 is substantially vertical, during the subsequent press bending operation, which is described in detail hereinafter, in which a downward pressing force is applied to the wing portion 20 in its upwardly rotated position, a corresponding force is transmitted down through the locking arm 32 and thence to the base 12 through the plate 34 and the mounting plate 60 to which the plate 34 is mounted. Such a downward pressing force on the wing portion 20 is transmitted with minimal downward deflection or distortion of the wing portion 20. The locking arm 32 acts as a rigid and locked support strut for the wing portion 20 as a result of the frictional engagement between the locking arm 32 and the locking zone 64 of the cam surface 54. This enables an articulated mould 10 having a relatively thin annular rim 30 to be employed in a subsequent press bending operation.<br>
It will be appreciated that an operator is required to set up the locking arm 32/plate 34 assembly when the apparatus is cold. However, the apparatus is required to operate satisfactorily and reliably at elevated temperatures in the furnace, for example at around 600 to 650 C. The initial, setting up must take account of expansion of the various parts of the apparatus on heating as well as slight distortion of the mechanical parts as a result of thermal cycling and also mechanical wear over time. It is obviously preferred that the apparatus be easy to be set up by an operator. Accordingly, the locking arm 32/plate 34 assembly is preferably configured so that the locking arm 32 is not<br>
quite vert-ical	in the press bending step.  This ensures that<br>
even if distortion and wear were to occur, . the locking arm 32 could not rotate past the vertical position and slide off<br><br>
the end 70 of the plate 34. This additionally permits, over a large number of heating cycles, a range of potential locking positions to be defined along the locking zone 56 corresponding to a range of slightly varying heights (relative to the base 12) of the the wing portion 20 to which the locking arm 32 is attached. This can readily compensate for any distortion and wear which may occur as a result of successive thermal cycles. The final angular position and thus the height of the wing portion 20 is defined by stop members on the arms 26 carrying the counterweights 24 which define a final position for the mould corresponding to the final desired shape.of the glass sheets. However, it is possible for the height of the wing portion 20 slightly to vary with respect to the base 12 as a result of thermal cycling and the provision of a locking range ensures that the locking arm operates to act as a support strut for the wing portion 20 of the mould 10 during the press bending operation despite such thermal cycling having caused ' a slight change in the final angular position of the locking arm 32. This obviates the need for regular checking and "adjustments to the locking devices. Preferably, the locking zone 56 is inclined slightly upwardly so as to permit smooth sliding movement by a camming action of the free end 42 of the locking arm 32 along the cam surface 54. The lock-ing arm 32/plate 34 assembly is easy to set up manually merely by adjusting the height and orientation of the plate 34 relative to the base 12, and thus relative to the locking arm 32 on the respective wing portion 20.<br>
The final configuration of the mould 10 after the gravity bending operation and prior to the press bending operation is illustrated in Figure 5.<br>
Although the embodiment illustrated in Figure 1 to 4 shows only one locking arm mounted on each wing portion 20, if desired two or more locking arms may be .provided on each<br><br>
wing. After the press bending operation which is described hereinafter, and after the press bent glass sheets have been removed from the mould at the unloading zone, the wing portion 20 can be reset to its initial lower configuration by an operator manually pushing the locking arm 32 inwardly so as to disposed in the configuration illustrated in phantom in Figure 2. If desired, this operation could be performed automatically, for example by a robot.<br>
Referring to Figure 5, there is shown the press bending apparatus, designated generally as 72, at the press bending zone in the tunnel furnace 2, the press bending apparatus 72 being illustrated prior to the press bending operation. At the press bending zone, the carriage 8 containing the mould 10 carrying the gravity bent glass sheets 4, with the wing portions 20 being disposed in their upwardly rotated orientation and with the locking arms 32 being in a substantially vertical orientation and bearing downwardly against the upper surface of the respective plates 34 as described hereinabove, is conveyed to a pre-set position at which the glass sheets 4 are positioned so as co be disposed beneath the press bending apparatus 72. The press bending operation is employed when it is desired to complete the bending of the glass sheets 4 to the required shape so that the resultant finally bent glass sheets 4 have a shape defined by the gravity bending mould 10.<br>
The press bending apparatus 72 comprises an upper mould or die 74 having a lower mould surface 76 which constitutes a male mould surface substantially corresponding to the female mould surface defined by the gravity bending mould 10. The glass sheets 4 are intended to be press bent between the upper mould 74 and the gravity bending mould 10 so as to attain the required shape. The upper mould 74 preferably comprises a ceramic body. As shown in Figure 5, the upper mould 74 may comprise a unitary mould. However, in  alternative  configurations  the  upper  mould  74  may<br><br>
comprise a pair of spaced mould parts which are arranged to be pressed against only those portions of the glass sheets 4 which are required to be deeply bent i.e. in the vicinity of the wing portions 20.<br>
The upper mould 74 is supported by a sub-frame 78. The<br>
sub-frame 78 depends downwardly from a support frame 80 by a<br>
plurality of chains 82. Preferably, there are four chains<br>
82, each located at a respective corner of the upper mould<br>
74. Metal cables may be employed instead of chains. The<br>
support frame 80 has connected to the upper surface 84<br>
thereof a cable (or chain) 86 which extends upwardly from<br>
the centre of the support frame 80 through the roof 87 of<br>
the tunnel furnace 2, over a first pulley 88 so as to be<br>
substantially horizontal, over a second pulley 90 so as to<br>
depend vertically downwardly with the end of the cable 86<br>
being connected to a first counterbalance 92 which is in<br>
turn connected to a die moving mechanism 94. The<br>
counterbalance 92 and the die moving mechanism 94 are<br>
located laterally adjacent the tunnel furnace 2 on one<br>
common longitudinal side thereof. The die moving mechanism<br>
94 preferably comprises a hydraulic or pneumatic<br>
piston/cylinder assembly which is connected at the bottom<br>
end thereof to the floor 96. "In Figure 5, the upper mould<br>
74 is illustrated in its raised . configuration with the<br>
piston/cylinder assembly 94 being in a retracted<br>
configuration. In the raised configuration of the upper<br>
mould 74, the carriage 8 can be moved from an upstream part<br>
of the tunnel furnace 2 into position beneath the upper<br>
mould 74 prior to the subsequent press bending operation.<br>
The counterbalance 92 is provided with a desired weight so<br>
as to minimize the work required to be expended by the<br>
piston/cylinder assembly 94 in raising and lowering the<br>
upper mould 74 but with the proviso that in the event of<br>
failure of the piston/cylinder—asembly 94, the weight of<br>
the first counterbalance 92 is sufficiently high so that the<br>
entire apparatus fails safely so as to pull the upper mould<br>
assembly 74 upwardly away from the carriages 8 passing<br>
thereunder.	<br><br>
A second counterbalance assembly is also provided for permitting the upper mould 74 to rest on the glass sheets 4 during the press bending step with a predetermined net weight. A rigid metal rod 98 extends upwardly away from the centre of the upper surface 100 of the sub-frame 78 for the upper mould 74. A second cable 102 is connected to the upper part of the rod 98 and extends successively through holes (not shown) in the support frame 80 and the furnace roof 88, and thence over a pair of pulleys 104,106 so as to be connected to at the other end thereof to a second counterbalance 108 which is free to move vertically. If desired, for both the first and second counterbalances 92,108 vertical rails or supports (not shown) may be provided so as to prevent inadvertent lateral movement of the counterbalances 92,108. The second counterbalance 108 has a specific weight which is selected so as to provide a specific predetermined net weight to the combined assembly of the upper mould 74 and the sub-frame 78 to which the mould 74 is mounted. The net weight of the upper die assembly is typically from 50 to 100 kg depending on the particular mould configuration and the size and desired shape of the bent glass sheets. The cable 102 between the second counterbalance 108 and the upper mould 74 is always in tension. The metal rod 98 is provided between the cable 102 and the sub-frame 78 so as to- reduce inadvertent stretching or deformation of the cable 102 in the vicinity of the upper mould 74 where the ambient temperature in the pressing zone is high. The cable 86 between the mounting frame 80 and the first counterbalance 92 is also always in tension. As described hereinbelow, during the press bending step the chains 82 are permitted to go slack so that during the press bending operation it is only the selected net weight of the upper mould 74 and its associated sub-frame 78 which is applied to the upper surface of the glass sheets 4.<br>
On opposed sides of the upper mould 74 and adjacent thereto are provided a plurality of spacer devices 109.  The<br><br>
spacer devices 109 each include an upper stop member 110, comprising a vertical body 112 having fixed thereto at the bottom end thereof a substantially horizontal plate 114. The upper stop members 110 are firmly mounted on the sub-frame 78. A corresponding plurality of lower stop members 116 of the spacer devices are mounted on the base 12. Each lower stop member 116 comprises an upwardly extending body 118 having mounted at its upper end a vertically adjustable spacer member 120. As is shown in greater detail with reference to Figure 7, each spacer member 120 comprises a bolt portion 122 having a domed head portion 124 which is substantially hemispherical and the upper surface of which is arranged, during the press bending operation, to bear against the lower surface 126 of the plate portion 114 of the respective upper stop member 110. The bolt portion 122 is threaded into the upwardly extending body 118 so as to be readily adjustable in height and a threaded nut 128 is provided so as to permit fixing of the domed head portion 124 at the required height. Preferably, the plate portion 114 and the domed head portion 124 are composed of steel. The upper and lower stop members 110,116 are provided in registry in pairs. Preferably, three pairs of stop members 110,116 are provided. With such a configuration,' as is shown in Figure 4, two pairs of stop members are provided on one long edge 117 of the mould 10 in spaced relation and a third pair of stop members 110,116 is provided centrally along the opposite long edge 119 of the mould 10.<br>
The spacer devices 109 are provided so as to ensure that the upper amd lower moulds 74,10 are separated over substantially their entire area by a gap corresponding to the thickness of the glass sheets 4 in their final shaped form. This ensures that any over-pressing of the glass sheets- 4, which oa*i result in marking of the glass sheets-? by the annular rim 30, is substantially avoided. As is described in detail hereinafter, three spacer devices 109<br><br>
are preferably provided so that it  is ensured that the        l<br>
vertical position of the upper mould 74 relative to the<br>
lower  gravity  bending  mould  10  is  determined  without<br>
inadvertent relative rocking of the moulds 74,10 occurring.<br>
This  increases  the possibility of correct spacing being<br>
reliably achieved.  As with the arrangement of the locking<br>
arms 32, it is necessary for the spacer devices 109 to be<br>
set up by an operator when the apparatus is cold but the<br>
spacer devices 109 must ensure proper spacing of the upper<br>
mould 74 and the lower mould 10 at elevated temperatures<br>
during  the  press  bending  operation,  which  can  entail<br>
inadvertent expansion or other deformation occurring as a<br>
result of thermal cycling.  The provision of three pairs of<br>
stop members 110, 116 ensures that the gap between the upper<br>
and  lower mould  74,10 can reliably be set without any<br>
rocking of the upper mould 74 relative to the lower mould 10<br>
in the final press bend configuration of the moulds 10,74.<br>
It will be appreciated that in a typical tunnel furnace 2 a plurality of carriages 8 is provided, each containing a respective gravity bending mould 10. A typical furnace 2 includes at least twenty carriage 8/gravity bending mould 10 assemblies. However, only one press bending upper mould 74 is provided. It is necessary in operation for' each lower gravity bending mould 10 and its associated carriage 8 to be properly set up with respect to the single upper press bending mould 74. Accordingly, the spacer devices 109 for defining the correct adjustable gap between the moulds 10,74 are provided in conjunction with each respective gravity bending mould 10 so that each gravity bending mould 10 can be individually set up to operate correctly with the single upper mould 74. Each spacer device 109 is individually adjusted prior to initial operation of the furnace so that during the press bending operation, when the upper mould 74<br>
Is lowered onto the glass sheets 4 carried on—the	gravity<br>
bending mould 10, the upper and lower moulds 74,10 are correctly spaced from each other a distance corresponding to<br><br><br>
The press bending operation will now be described with reference to Figure 6. When the lower mould 10 carrying the glass sheets 4 thereon is presented beneath the upper mould , 74, the piston/cylinder assembly 94 is actuated so as to lower the support frame 80 supporting the upper mould 74 until the upper mould 74 is in contact with the underlying glass sheets 4 on the gravity bending mould 10. The stroke of the piston/cylinder assembly 94 is greater than that required just to cause contact of the upper mould 74 with the glass sheets 4. The support frame 80 thus overtravels so as to continue to be lowered after contact of the upper mould 74 with the glass sheets 4 so that the support frame 80 has been lowered so as to be nearer to the sub-frame 78 than in the initial configuration illustrated in Figure 5. This over-lowering of the support frame 80 causes the chains 82 to go slack. In this configuration, the upper mould 74 and its associated sub-frame 78 bear downwardly on the glass sheets 4 with the desired net weight which has been selected by appropriate selection of a particular weight for the second counterbalance 108. The upper mould 74 thus presses the upper surface of the glass sheets 4 with a predetermined net weight.<br>
Moreover, since the upper mould 74 is not supported from above during the press bending ' operation at least towards the end of the press bending operation, the weight of the upper mould 74 is uniformly distributed across the<br>
entire abutting surfaces, typically over an area of around<br>
2<br>
lm , of the upper mould 74 and the underlying glass sheets<br>
4. This ensures even weight distribution over the glass sheets 4 during the press bending operation. The press bending operation typically lasts for 20 seconds. Towards the end of the press bending operation in which the glass sheets have been pressed into intimate contact around their entire periphery with the lower gravity bending mould 10 by the upper mould 74, for each of the spacer devices 109, the domed head 124 bears against the plate member 114 so as to define across substantially the entire area of the press<br><br><br>
bending mould a preset gap between the upper and lower moulds 74,10 corresponding to the thickness of the press-bent glass sheets.- The provision of the stop members ensures that over-pressing of the glass sheets 4 during the press bending operation does not occur. This minimizes edge marking of the lower surface of the glass sheets 4 by the annular rim 30 of the gravity bending mould 10 which is a particular problem when employing a gravity bending mould having thin rims having a thickness on the order of around 3 to 4 mm.<br>
The spacer devices 109 are specially configured to accommodate variations in the lateral positions of the upper mould 74 and the lower mould 10 because the domed head 124 can engage the plate member 114 over a selected range of lateral positions encompassed by the area of the plate member 114. This permits accurate spacing of the moulds to be achieved despite possible variations in the positions of the plurality of gravity bending moulds 10 around the bending loop. This arrangement does not restrict the lateral freedom of the" positioning of the upper die 74 during press bending.<br>
The upper* mould 74 is supported by the support frame 70 by means of the chains 82 whereby the upper mould 74 is unconstrained against both rotational and translational lateral movement, during the press bending operation. Moreover, the support frame 80 is suspended from the cable 86 which in turn does not constrain the upper mould 74 against lateral movement during the press bending operation. In addition, the supporting of the upper mould 74 by on the one hand a plurality of chains 82 to a support frame 80 and on the other hand by a cable 86 between the support frame 80 and the pulley 88 permits unconstrained vertical movement-,—^for example tilting, of parts the^upper<br>
mnnlrl    7/1   Hurinn    t-ho   nra<s honrh nrr nneration.></s>
 <br>
The upper mould 74 is required accurately to be positioned with respect to each of the plurality of the gravity bending moulds 10 in the entire loop including the tunnel furnace. In practice, the translational position, both horizontal and vertical, and the rotational position both horizontal and tilting, of each gravity bending mould 10 will vary from one carriage to another not only following the initial set up of the furnace but also, in particular, after operation of the furnace. This is due to thermal expansion, deformation as a result of thermal cycling, and wear of the apparatus, for example wear of the carriage wheels on the rails.<br>
Since the upper mould 74 is permitted to nestle into the gravity bent shape of the glass sheets 4 during the press bending operation without any constraint on its lateral or tilting movement, the upper mould 74 can readily find its correct position for accurate press bending with respect to the underlying glass sheets 4 irrespective of the variation in position relative to the upper mould 74 of those glass sheets 4 from one gravity bending mould 10 to another. This provision.of freedom of movement of the upper mould 74 during the press bending operation ensures that accurate press bending is achieved irrespective of any variations in positions between the ' plurality of lower gravity bending moulds. The suspension of the upper mould 74 by flexible members such as chains 82 permits this unconstrained movement.<br>
In addition, the upper mould 74 is supported by the chains 82 whereby the upper mould 74 can be rolled to a minor extent slightly into contact with the underlying glass sheets 4. This provides that the required shape of the underlying glass sheets 4 can be achieved by a progressive pushing action as a result of the upper die progressively coming into contact with the underlying glass sheets 4. Preferably, the upper mould 74 is rolled onto the upper<br><br>
glass surface so that the deep bend portions  are first shaped by the upper mould 74.<br>
The provision of the stop members in which the lower stop member includes a hemispherical dome and the upper stop member consists of a flat plate against which the dome bears ensures reliable relative vertical positioning of the upper mould and the lower mould so as to minimize inadvertent marking of the glass sheets by the gravity bending mould 10. However this is achieved without removing or reducing the ability of the upper mould 74 to move laterally both translationally and rotationally and to tilt vertically relative to the lower mould 10 and the glass sheets 4 in an unconstrained manner during the press bending operation.<br>
Prior to the press bending operation, the underlying glass sheets 4 may be heated by a roof heater so as to provides a differential temperature profile over the surface of the glass sheets 4 so as to assist the glass sheets 4 attaining the required shape during the press bending operation. Such a differential roof heating technique is described in co-pending European patent application No. 94309435.9.<br>
The present invention can enable glass sheets to be manufactured with bend portions having' radii as little as 150 mm. This may be compared to a minimum radius of 450 mm when gravity bending is employed using differential heating of the glass sheets and a minimum radius of 1000 mm when employing gravity bending without differential heating.<br>
The present invention enables glass sheets with deep bend portions to be manufactured having edge stresses which compare to those achievable using conventional sag bending techniques. The present invention typically enables bent glass sheets to be manufactured having edge tensile stresses of less than 7 MPa. This enables glass sheets to be bent without requiring a subsequent anneal to remove stresses, '* following the press bending step.<br><br><br>
