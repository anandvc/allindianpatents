				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a composition useful for making in-situ Silicon Carbide in the form of particulate, whiskers and fibres in carbon matrix composite and a process for making in-situ Silicon Carbide in the form of particulate, whiskers and fibres in carbon matrix composite. The process of the present invention particularly relates to the use of wide variety of natural fibres such as jute, sunhemp, sisal or any other natural fibres having cellulosic or hemicellulosic constituents at its backbone as raw materials for providing useful carbon for the formation of silicon carbide in the form of particulate, whiskers and fibres in the matrix of carbon. The main usage of the silicon carbide in the form of particulate, whiskers and fibres in carbon matrix composites is in the field of engineering materials in any shape as may be deemed fit.<br>
The present day method of making Silicon Carbide particulate, whiskers and fibres reinforced composite in carbon matrix composites essentially consists of seeding graphite substrate with metal droplets such as Fe, Co, Cr and Mn as catalyst for the whisker formation. Methane and silicon monoxide supply C and Si respectively - the references for which may be made to "Synthesis and Characterisation of VLS - Derived SiC whiskers" of P.D. Shalek in Conf. Whisker and fibre Toughened Ceramics, Oak Ridge T N (1988) and to "Review of VLS SiC Whisker Growth Technology" by W.E.Holler and J.J.Kim in Ceram. Engg. Sci. Proc, vol. 12, pp 979-991<br>
(1991) or making fibre by melt extrusion and suspension spinning of compositions of ultrafine SiC powders and organic additives such as polyvinyl butyral respectively followed by sintering or making fibre by melt spinning polymers which can be rapidly cured in the solid state and polymerised to ceramic fibres with compositions which are stoichiometric silicon carbide or which are carbon-rich or silicon-rich silicon carbide -the reference for which may be made to "Silicon Carbide: from Acheson's Invention to New Industrial Products" by W. D. G. Boecker in cfi/Ber. DKG 74 (5), 1997. The fibres and whiskers produced by the above processes are mixed mechanically with the matrix materials and are fabricated into different sizes and shapes followed by heat treatment at different temperatures for consolidations - the references for which may be made to "Pressureless Sintering of Al203/SiC Materials: Effect of the Reducing Atmosphere" by G. Urretavizcaya, J.M.Porto Lopez &amp; A.L. Cavalieri, J. Eu. Ceram. Soc, 17_ 1555-63(1997). In a process inorganic polymers that are ceramic precursors are spun into fibres by melt-spinning or solvent-assisted dry spinning, stabilising the fibres to prevent remelting followed by thermally decomposing into fibres - the references for which may be made to German P.2,618150; French P.2,308,590; Japanese P.51 130325, 51 139929, 51 147623 (1976). In slurry spinning a dispersion of crystalline ceramic particulate in a carrier fluid is formed into a fibre, converted to fibre by thermal conversion by several heating stages that may include passing the fibre through a flame. The process generate particulate<br>
of not more than 1 µm to control shrinkage - the references for which may be made to E.I. du Pont de Nemovrs and Co. B.P. 1,264,973(1972); USP 3,808,015(1974); USP 4,753,904 (1988); Mitsui Mining Co. Ltd. Japanese P 217182 (1986)p; European P. 0,260,868-A2 (1988), USP 4,812,271(1989). The overall process has several drawbacks that may be listed below:<br>
1.	Number of steps involved in the overall process is higher.<br>
2.	Handling of whiskers and short fibres require special arrangements.<br>
3.	It is difficult to disperse whiskers and short fibres uniformly in the matrix.<br>
4.	Silicon Carbide whiskers particularly of aspect ratio less than 10 cause	health hazard.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a composition useful<br>
for making in-situ silicon carbide in the form of particulate, whiskers and<br>
fibres in carbon matrix composites.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for making<br>
in-situ silicon carbide in the form of particulate, whiskers and fibres in<br>
carbon matrix composites which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to utilise natural fibres of<br>
plant source.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to reduce the total number of<br>
unit processes in the overall operation.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to form whiskers and fibres in- situ during processing to eliminate totally the possibility of health hazard.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a composition useful for making<br>
in-situ silicon carbide in the form of particulate, whiskers and fibres in<br>
Silicon Carbide-carbon matrix composites which comprises:<br><br>

resorcinol, di-isocyanate prepolymer.<br>
In   yet another embodiment of the present invention the organic solvent<br>
used may be such as methanol, toluene, benzene.<br>
There is no chemical reaction in the mixture as such and the composition of the present invention is not a mere admixture but a synergistic mixture having properties which are different and distinct from the mere aggregation of the properties of the individual ingredients.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for making in-situ silicon carbide in the form of particulate, whiskers and carbon matrix composites which comprises dissolving 42-52% of phenolic resin in an organic solvent such as herein described, to obtain a phenolic resin solution, adding 6.2-8.6 wt% of curing agent such as herein described to obtain a resin mix , to the obtained mix impregnating by conventional manner 1.6-6.4 wt% of natural fibre dried at 60° -70 ° C for a period in the range of 1-5 h , to the obtained mix by conventional manner to obtain a dough in the form of composite ,drying the said composite at a temperature in the range of 70 ° - 90 °C for a period in the range of 1 -2 h , drying and heat treating the dried composite at a temperature ranging 150° -200° C for a period of 1-2-5 h , impregnating the resultant composite with 33 - 50.2 wt % of tetraethyl orthosilicate in vacuum , subjecting the impregnated composite to further heat treatment in absence of air at a rate of 2° -5° C per minute upto a temperature in the range of 200° - 400 °C followed by at a rate 10° - 15° C per minute upto temperature range of 1400° - 1850° C , maintaining the final temperature for a period in the range of 0.5 -2 h to get the desired silicon carbide.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the natural fibres may be<br>
introduced in the body in  desired alignments such  as  unidirectional,<br>
multidirectional, woven, randomly  oriented structure.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the matrix materials may<br>
be of different particle dimension from nano to micron size.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention drying of the natural<br>
fibre may be effected at a temperature in the range of 60° to 70°C for a<br>
period in the range of 1 to 5 hrs.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention impregnation with<br>
tetraethylorthosilicate may be carried out in vacuum and repeating if<br>
required.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the heat treatment in<br>
the absence of air may be done in an inert atmosphere or in vacuum.<br>
The details of the present invention are given below:<br>
a)	42 - 52 wt % of phenolic resin is dissolved in organic solvent.<br>
b)	6.2 -8.6 wt % of curing agent  is   mixed with the solution prepared in<br>
step (a).<br>
c)	Natural fibre is dried at 60° - 70°C for 1 to 5 hrs.<br>
d)	1.6 - 6.4 wt % of dried natural fibre is impregnated with mixture prepared in step (b) to obtain a composite plate/sheet.<br>
e)	The composite plate/sheet obtained in step (d) is dried at 70° to 90°C for 1 -2 hrs.<br>
f)	The dried composite plate/sheet is heat treated at 150°-200°C for 1 -2.5hrs.<br>
g)	The dried composite plate/sheet is impregnated with 33 -50.2 wt % of tetraethyl orthosilicate in vacuum.<br>
h) The impregnated plate/sheet is initially heat treated in argon at the rate of 2° - 5°C/min. upto 200°-400°C followed by further heating at the rate of 10° - 15°C per min. upto 1400°-1850°C maintaining the final temperature for 0.5-2 hrs. The process of the present invention can be used to produce in-situ silicon carbide in the form of particulate, whiskers and fibres in carbon matrix composite of various shapes and sizes required for application as engineering components. Natural fibres of plant origin contain all the ingredients of forming silicon carbide if sufficient amount of silicon is provided. Organo silicon compound such as tetraethyl orthosilicate gives active silica on pyrolysis. This active silica in turn reacts with carbon-formed from cellulosic materials like fibres of plant origin. Silicon carbide thus formed are in molecular dimension and with proper catalyst and seeding crystals, unidirectional grain growth occurs to form long fibres of small diameters or whiskers of different aspect ratios. Isolated silicon carbide grains may grow in the three dimensions resulting into particulate formation. If these complex set of network structure is allowed to grow in carbon matrix - the resulting microstructure consists of randomly orientated  fibres  and  whiskers  in  a  homogeneous  matrix  leading  to enhanced fracture toughness imparting some machinability in otherwise non-machinable material.<br>
