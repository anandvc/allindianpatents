DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The peptides can be readily synthesized by standard synthetic methods from L-amino acids, but may also be synthesized by genetic engineering methods using nucleic acids that have sequences encoding the individual peptides.<br>
I.         Biological Activity<br>
In order to investigate the possible biological activity of peptides, the immunological effect of the peptides on animal model was examined, with procedures compliant to the "Principles of Pre-clinical Research of New Drugs" issued by Ministry of Health of People's Republic of China [1].<br>
The T lymphocyte transformation test, NK cell cytotoxicity activity test, and the T lymphocyte IL-2 and IFN-y secretion test were used to detect any possible effect of peptides on specific cellular immune function. The carbon particle clearance test was used to detect any possible effect of peptides on nonspecific cellular immune function. The Sheep Red B100d Cell (SRBC) hemolysis test was used to detect any possible effect of peptides on humoral immune function. The immunity organ weight test was used to detect any possible effect of peptides at the organ level.<br>
In this study, the saline group was used as negative control, while the IL-2 and IFN-y groups were used as positive controls, since IL-2 and IFN-y are well-studied immunostimulants [10]. Four arbitrary concentrations of sample peptides were used in this study, to cover a 1000 fold dosage range. Due to the intrinsic complexity of in vivo immunological response, and the lack of prior knowledge on the dosage versus response function, therefore any statistically significant difference over the negative control in any of the dosage groups has been scored as positive biological activity.<br>

added, and 100µl/well plain RPMI-1640 was used for the controls. The cells were incubated for 66 hrs at 37°C, 5% CO2. The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 150g for 10 minutes. The supernatant was collected and stored at -20°C for cytokines IL-2 and IFN determination.<br>
50µl/well MTT of Img/ml in RPMI-1640 was added to the cell pellet and the cells re-suspended by shaking for 2 minutes. The incubation was continued for 4 hours. The supernatant was discarded after centrifugation at 150g for 10 minutes. 120µl 40mM HCI-2-propanol was added to the cell pellet and shaken for 3 minutes, to obtain OD570nm of each well referenced at 630nm. An ELISA reader was used<br>
Calculation:<br>
Each mouse formed three assay wells and three control wells. The Stimulation Index (SI) of each mouse was obtained by first deriving the average OD of the three parallel wells, then dividing the value of the assay wells by the control wells.<br>
1.3      The effect of peptides on NK cell activity[3,4]<br>
Mice spleen cells were prepared to 4xl06/ml as described in section 1.1 above. Target cells YAC-1 were brought to log phase and adjusted to 1x105/ml. Using a 96 wells cell culture plate, 100µl mouse spleen cells and 100µl culture medium were added to the control well containing only the spleen cells; 100µl target cells and 100µl culture medium were added to the control well containing only target cells; 100µl mouse spleen cells and 100µl target cells were added to the NK activity assay well. Three parallel sets of the above were prepared per mouse.<br>
Samples were centrifuged at 150g for 10 minutes to collect the cells. The supernatant was discarded and 50µl/well MTT of Img/ml was added. The reaction mixture was then shaken for 2 minutes, and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 4 hours. The supernatant was discarded after centrifugation at 150g for 10 minutes. 120µl 40mM HCl-2-propanol was added and shaken for 3 minutes. An ELISA reader was used to obtain OD570nm of each well referenced at 630nm.<br>
Calculation:<br>
Each mouse has 9 wells: three spleen cells only control, three target cells only control, and three assay wells with both spleen and target cells. The NK cell activity index of each mouse was obtained by first deriving the average OD of the three parallel wells of each combination, then applying this average OD to the following formula:<br>
NK cell activity index = [l-(average OD of spleen and target cell well -average OD of spleen cell only well) +(average OD of target cell only well)] x 100%<br>
1.4    The effect of peptides on the activity T lymphocyte in secreting IL-2[5]<br>
HT-2 cells at log phase were collected by centrifugation at 150g for 10 minutes, and washed three times with cold Hank's solution by re-suspension and centrifugation. The collected HT-2 cells were re-suspended in RPMI-1640 and<br>
incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 30 minutes. The cells were further washed twice with RPMI-1640 by re-suspension and centrifugation, and re-suspended to final concentration of 2xl05/ml with RPMI-1640.<br>
The supernatant obtained in section 1.2 were diluted to the following percentage with RPMI-1640: 100%, 50%, 25%, 12.5%, 6.25%, and 3.125%.<br>
rIL-2 was diluted to the following concentration with RPMI-1640: 500IU/ml, 250IU/ml, 125IU/ml, 62.5IU/ml, 31.25IU/ml, and 15.5IU/ml.<br>
A 96 well cell culture plate was set up with three parallel wells per combination:<br>
Negative control: 100µl RPMI-1640 + 100µl HT-2 cell suspension rIL-2 standard: 100µl rIL-2 solution + 100µl HT-2 cell suspension Assay well: 100µl diluted supernatant + 100µl HT-2 cell suspension<br>
The plate was incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 68 hours, then centrifuged at 150g for 15 minutes and the supernatant removed. 100µl 0.5mg/ml MTT in RPMI-1640 without phenolsulfonphthalein was added into each well. After shaking for 3-4 minutes to re-suspend the cells, continue to incubate for another 4 hours. Samples were then centrifuged at 150g for 15 minutes and the supernatant was removed. To each well, 120µl 40mM HCl-2-propanol was added, mixed for 3-4 minutes and OD analyzed at 570nm, referenced at 630nm with an ELISA plate reader.<br>
Calculation:<br>
The average OD of the three parallel wells of each dilution was taken and plotted against concentration on a semi-log paper, concentration on the X-axis. The concentration at 50% OD saturation was obtained for both the testing supernatant and rIL-2.<br>
Sample IL-2 activity = (sample dilution at 50% maximum action + rIL-2 standard dilution at 50%; maximum action) x activity of rIL-2 standard at 50% maximum action (IU/ml)<br>

The supernatant from the section 1.2 was diluted with RPMI-1640 culture medium to the following percentages: 100%, 50%, 25%, 12.5%, 6.25%, and 3.125%.<br>
The recombinant interferon (rIFN) standard was diluted with RPMI-1640 to the following concentrations: 500IU/ml, 250IU/ml, 125IU/ml, 62.5IU/ml, 31.25IU/ml, and 15.5IU/ml.<br>
Target cells L929 at log phase were adjusted to 2xl05/ml with RPMI-1640, with treatment same as the HT-2 cell described in section 1.4. Stock VSV was also adjusted to 100 TCID50 with RPMI-1640.<br>
The following on a 96 well culture plate was set up, three parallel wells per combination:<br>
Negative control well: 150µl RPMI-1640 + 100µl L929 Positive control well: 100µl RPMI-1640 + 100µl L929 + 50µl VSV rIFN activity well:100µlrIFN standard + 100µl L929 + 50µl VSV assay well: 100µl diluted supernatant -+ 100µl L929 + 50µl VSV<br>
Samples were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 24 hours. The positive control wells were observed periodically under inverted microscope to confirm cell lysis, then collected, washed, and OD of all wells was read same as described in section 1.4.<br>
Calculation:<br>
Concentrations at 50% maximum action were obtained same way as section 1.4. Calculate IFN activity of sample as following:<br>
Sample IFN activity = (sample dilution at 50% maximum action * rIFN standard dilution at 50% maximum action) x standard rIFN activity at that 50% maximum action (IU/ml)<br>
2.        The effect of peptides on antibody formation01<br>
Sheep red blood cells (SRBC) were prepared by collecting blood from cervical vein and put into a sterile flask with glass beads. The flask was shaken for 3 minutes and the blood then mixed with Alsever solution (glucose 2.05g, NaCl 0.4g, Na lemonade 0.8g, adjust to 100ml with distilled water) and stored at 4°C. Immediately before use, samples were centrifuged at 130g, 5 minutes to collect the SRBC. The cells were washed two times by re-suspension and centrifugation in normal saline. Then the cell pellet was collected by centrifugation at 180g for 10 minutes and re-suspended in saline to make the final working SRBC suspension, 2% (v/v).<br>
Complement was prepared by adding 10 volumes of fresh Cavy serum into one volume centrifuge packed SRBC, and then gently shaking for 30 minutes at 4°C. The SRBC was removed by centrifugation at 200g for 10 minutes. 10 volumes of normal saline were added to obtain the working complement solution.<br>
The BALB/c mice were randomly divided into the peptide group, IFN group, IL-2 group, and saline group, 10 mice per group. The test substances were administered as described in section 1.1, plus intraperitoneal injection 0.2ml SRBC per mouse on day 12. On the day after the last test substance administration (day 16), blood was collected from the eye canthus and left at room temperature for one hour for serum exudation. After centrifugation at 200g for 10 minutes, the serum was diluted by 500 times with normal saline.<br>
To 1ml diluted mouse serum of each mouse, 0.5ml SRBC suspension was added. Ice cold. Then 1ml working complement solution was added and incubated at 37°C water bath for 10 minutes. Reactions were terminated by ice cold. Samples were then centrifuged at 200g for 10 minutes to obtain the supernatant.<br>
To 1ml of this supernatant, 3ml Drabkin solution was added and left at room temperature for 10 minutes. OD540nm was obtained.<br>
Calculation:<br>
Reference OD540nm was obtained by mixing 0.25ml SRBC suspension with Drabkin solution to 4ml and placed at room temperature for 10 minutes before taken.<br>
Sample serum index = (OD540nm of test sample -s- reference OD540nm) x 500<br>

II.        THE IN VIVO ANTIVIRAL EFFECT OF PEPTIDES<br>
In order to find out whether these peptides have possible therapeutic effect on viral infections, we used the animal model duck hepatitis B infection in this study to test out the in vivo effects of the above peptides on diseased animals.<br>
Chongqing duck hepatitis B model was set up and treated with peptides by intraperitoneal injection (50u,g/kg/day, once per day) for 4 weeks. The serum level of DHBV DNA was analyzed by serum dot-blot hybridization. Lamivudine and normal saline treatment was used as positive and negative control respectively. The peptide CMS001 was found to be able to reduce the serum level of DHBV DNA at the 4th week of the treatment, having statistically significant difference from the saline control group (p
Materials and methods<br>
1.         Peptides were custom synthesized by American Peptide Company, Inc., USA, from L-amino acids.<br>
2.         Animal model m<br>
One-day old Chongqing ducks were inoculated with O.lml stock serum positive of Duck Hepatitis B Virus (DHBV) DNA (5 X 107 copy/ml) by intraperitoneal injection. One week later, blood samples were collected from the external jugular vein and infection was confirmed by dot-blot hybridization with DHBV DNA probe labeled with digoxin [2]. The ducks were breed to 2 weeks old for entrance into the study.<br>
3.	Grouping and treatment<br>
DHBV infected ducks were randomized into the following groups:<br>
a)	Negative control group (n=9):   Normal saline was given 1ml per duck<br>
by intraperitoneal injection, once per day.<br>
b)	Lamivudine group (n=8):         As positive control group. Lamivudine [4]<br>
was given 50mg/kg/day by oral administration, once per day.<br>
c)	Peptide group (n=9):	50µg/kg/day peptide (adjusted to final<br>
volume of 0.5 to 1ml with normal saline) was given once per day by intraperitoneal injection.<br>
Treatment lasted for 4 weeks and observation continued for another one week after termination of treatment. 1 ml blood samples were drawn from the external jugular vein of the ducks on days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 when treatment started. Sera of the blood samples were isolated immediately [3] and stored at -20°C until analysis.<br>
4.	Serum DHBV DNA level determinations<br>
DHBV DNA probe was fluorescent labeled according to the labeling kit protocol from the kit manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Co.). 40µl duck sera were dot-blotted (1 duplicated dot per sample) onto nitro-cellulose membrane and hybridized with fluorescent-labeled DHBV DNA probe for quantitation [2]. After completion of hybridation, the blots were developed in CDP-Star fluorimetry reagent RPN3690 and scanned with Vuego Scan (Brisa-620st) scanner. ImageMaster TotalLab vl.11.Ink software was used for quantitative analysis of the blots. Statistical analysis was carried out according to the pair t-test with SPSS software.<br>

Discussion<br>
Duck hepatitis animal model [1] is an established experimental model for human hepatitis B pathogenesis studies and for the screening of hepatitis B therapeutic agents. In this study, CMS001 was found to be able to decrease the serum titre of DHBV DNA after 4 weeks of treatment, indicating that the peptide CMS001 at suitable dosage level and with suitable application scheme, can be useful on its own or in combination with other substances as an agent for human hepatitis B management.<br>
In the present study, administration by intraperitoneal injection was tested, but this does not exclude the possible effectiveness of the peptide if administered via other alternative routes. The peptides may also be administered via intravenous injection, intramuscular injection, subcutaneous injection, and subcutaneous implantation, with or without delivery facilitating device such as liposome, sustain release protection etc. The peptide may also be administered in any form of oral administration like tablet, capsule, suspension, solution etc, in the usual form without modification or in slow release form, or with or without gastro-enteric protection. The peptide may further be applied in any form of topic application like ointment, cream, gel etc with or without transdermal facilitating device, or as inhalant of powder, dissolved, or as liposome protected form. The peptide may also be interpreted into its genetic sequence and cloned into an expression system, on its own or in combination with other peptide sequences, to generate a resulting peptide molecule to make use of the activity of the peptide as described in this report, with or without purification of the resulting peptide.<br>

III.       EFFECT OF PEPTIDES ON NEPHRITIS<br>
In order to find out whether these peptides have possible therapeutic effect on nephritis, we used the animal model rat Masugi nephritis in this study to test out the in vivo effects of the above peptides on diseased animals [3,4].<br>
The objective of this study is to investigate the in vivo therapeutic effect of peptides on chronic glomerulonephritis. Masugi nephritis rat model was constructed by injecting rabbit anti-rat-renal-cortex IgG into heathy Sprague Dawley rats, and then treated immediately with intraperitoneal injection of peptides at 50u.g/kg/day, once per day for 3 weeks. Hydrocortisone was used as positive control. It was found that proteinurea, serum creatinine level, and splenic index of the rats treated with CMS014, CMS018, CMS030, and CMS036 were lowered compared with that of the control group, with statistical significance (p
Materials<br>
Sprague Dawley (SD) rats, male, weighing 120±20g, were from Center of Experimental Animal, Guangzhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and also from First Military Medical University. Chinchilla rabbits weighing 3kg were from Center of Experimental Animal, Guangzhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine.<br>
Peptides, of L-amino acids origin, were custom synthesized by American Peptide Company, Inc, USA, and were diluted to lOug/ml in sterile normal saline. Hydrocortisone was from Yangzhou Pharmaceutical Factory, China.<br>
Serum   creatinine   level   determination   kit  from  Shanghai   Rongsheng Biological Technique Company, PR China.<br>
Methods<br>
1. Preparation of rabbit anti-rat-renal-cortex anti-serum [1]: 20 healthy SD rats were anesthetized with intravenous injection of 3% sodium pentobarbital, 40mg/kg. The aorta abdominalis was exposed and the kidneys were perfused with<br>
normal saline until clean of blood. The renal cortex was isolated, homogenized in 5 volumes of 0.01M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.1, and filtered through a 140-gauge stainless steel mesh. The filtrate was collected and mixed with either GIBCO-RRE complete or incomplete Freunds adjuvant in 1:1 and emulsified to obtain the working immunization solution.<br>
10 healthy rabbits were immunized with the immunization solutions, first time with complete Freunds adjuvant and subsequently with the incomplete one. The antigen was injected hypodermally through 6 random points, 0.1 ml per point, once per 10 days. From 6th week onwards, blood was collected from the auricular vein and the antibody titer was determined by the double diffusion method [2]. On the 8th week after starting of immunization, the rabbits were anesthetized with intravenous injection of 3% sodium pentobarbital, 20mg/kg, and blood was collected from the carotid artery. The anti-serum was then exuded and isolated.<br>
Whole blood was collected from 15 healthy SD rats. The red blood cell was isolated and washed clean thrice with normal saline. The clean red blood cell was mixed with 250 ml rabbit anti-serum and incubated at 4°C overnight. After incubation, the blood cell was removed by centrifugation and the supernatent was further inactivated at 56°C for 30 minutes. After centrifugation to remove any precipitate, crude IgG was isolated and partially purified from the supernatenl by precipitation with (NH4)2SO4 thrice (50%, 33%, and then 33%)[5]. The crude IgG was redissolvcd in 125ml double distilled water and dialysed clean of ammonium sulphate. The anti-rat-renal-cortex antibody titer was determined by the double diffusion method '2'.<br>
2. Induction of rat glomerulonephritis |51: 0.25ml priming solution (containing about 4mg non-specific rabbit IgG with complete Freunds adjuvant) was injected intraperiloneally into healthy SD rats to prime the rats five days before induction. With the exception of the normal healthy control group that received normal saline, all groups were subsequently induced by intraperitoneal injection of 1ml rabbit anti-rat-renal-cortex IgG prepared as described in section Method 1.<br>
3. Grouping and administration: male SD rats were randomized into groups of normal healthy control (normal), nephritis placebo treatment control (placebo), nephritis peptide treatment, and the nephritis hydrocortisone treatment control (hydrocortisone), 12 per group. Treatment started on the day of induction. Peptides 50µg/kg/day, hydrocortisone 3.3mg/kg/day, and normal saline was used as placebo, all administered intraperitoneally once per day and lasted for 3 weeks.<br>
4.         Parameters monitored [4]:<br>
(a)       urine protein level:   each rat was kept individually in one cage. Adequate drinking water was supplied.   Urine was collected once<br>
per week, 24 hours per time.    Protein content of the urine was determined by the Coomassie blue method.<br>
(b) serum creatinine level: blood was collected after three weeks of treatment and serum creatinine level determination. The creatinine kit was provided by Shanghai Rongsheng Biological Technique Company.<br>
(c)       Spleen weight index:   spleen weight index was determined by the following formula:<br>
Spleen weight index = mean spleen weight •*• mean body weight<br>
(d)      Pathological microscopic examination of kidney: 6 heaviest kidneys were chosen from each group for pathological examination.<br>

The spleens of all induced rats were enlarged compared with normal rats, showing that the induction of nephritis was related to immune response. It was found that the peptides CMS014, CMS018, CMS030, and CMS036 at 50µg/kg/day once per day were able to decrease the spleen index, with statistically significant difference from the group of nephritis rats receiving placebo treatment, p
4.        The effects of peptides on the renal pathological microscopic examination<br>
Comparing with normal rats, the nephritis rats receiving placebo treatment (placebo group) showed signs of fibrous tissue formation in the glomerular capsule, hyperplasia of the glomerular epithelium, formation of crescents, dilation and congestion of glomerular capillaries, edema of the proximal tubule epithelium, and cast formation in the distal tubule and collecting duct. These pathological changes confirmed the successful induction of nephritis. It was observed that in the group CMS014, there was only one rat showed signs of fibrous tissue formation in the glomerular capsule and hyperplasia of the glomerular epithelium. Other parameters of the same rat, and other rats of the same group have essentially the same renal histology as normal rats. In the groups CMS018, CMS030, and CMS036, all pathological parameters of all rats were normal.<br>
Conclusion<br>
It is concluded that the peptides CMS014, CMS018, CMS030, and CMS036 at 50jo,g/kg/day, once per day, administered intraperitoneally can have therapeutic effect on experimental Masugi nephritis rat model. Proteinurea, creatinine excretion, and renal histology of the treated rats were corrected by these peptides, with statistically significant difference from the control group receiving placebo treatment. These peptides may act through immunological mechanisms as indicated by their influence on the spleen weight index, but does not exclude the possibility of their actions via other mechanisms.<br>
Discussion<br>
The peptides CMS014, CMS018, CMS030, and CMS036 may be useful as a part, ov on its own, in nephritis management in human. For example, the peptides may be used to correct proteinurea or to restore the excretary functions of nephritis patients. The peptides may also be used to prevent futher kidney function impairment in nephritis patients. The peptides may be used on its own, in combinations of two or more peptides, or in combination with other Pharmaceuticals or food supplements as a total course for nephritis management.<br>

V.        THE EFFECT ON THE BODY WEIGHT<br>
Healthy rats were feeded with high nutrition diet for 5 weeks, with or without simultaneous peptide treatment (intramuscular 300u.g/kg/day). Rats on an ordinary diet with saline injection were used as negative control. After 5 weeks of treatment, injection was stopped and the same diet was maintained for another three weeks. Body weight data was collected at once per week interval. Behaviour of the rats was also observed. Rats receiving peptide CMS015 were found to have statistically significant lower body weight increase compared with control during the course of peptide treatment. This trend of decreased body weight gradually reduced after ceasing the CMS015 treatment. It is concluded that CMS015 at suitable dosage level can reversibly control obesity development induced by over-feeding.<br>
Materials<br>
Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, weighing 145 ± 10g, were supplied by the Center of Experimental Animal of Guangzhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, PR China (certificate No.: 2000A019). Peptides were custom synthesized (of L-amino acids origin) by American Peptide Company, Inc., USA, and were diluted to 10µg/ml in normal saline. The high and normal nutrition diets were prepared in compliance with the guideline for pre-clinical research of anti-obesity drug, issued by SD \ (State Drug Administration), PR China "].<br>
Methods<br>
Healthy rats were randomized into the experiment, positive control, and negative control groups. 10 rats per group, half male and half female. The experiment group of rats was feeded with high nutrition diet for 5 weeks with simultaneous intramuscular injection of 300µg/kg/day peptide, once per day. Positive control group received the same high nutrition diet but placebo saline injection, while negative control group, used to proof successful establishment of obesity model, received normal nutrition diet and placebo saline injection. After 5 weeks treatment, injection was stopped and the same diet was maintained for<br>
another 3 weeks. The rats were weighed at once per week interval. Behaviour of the rats was also observed.<br>
Statistics<br>
The data were presented as mean ± standard deviation. Paired t test or single-factor ANOVA was used for inter and intra group comparison. Statistical significance cut-off was at P

Discussion<br>
It is concluded that CMS015 at suitable dosage level can limit the development of obesity induced by over-feeding. The peptide may put into human use for control of obesity. The peptides may be used on its own, in combinations of two or more peptides, or in combination with other Pharmaceuticals or food supplements as a total course for obesity management.<br>
In the present study, administration by intramuscular injection was tested, but this does not exclude the possible effectiveness of the peptide if administered via other alternative routes. The peptides may be administered via intravenous injection, intramuscular injection, intraperitoneal injection, subcutaneous injection, and subcutaneous implantation, with or without delivery facilitating device such as liposome, sustain release protection etc. The peptide may also be administered in any form of oral administration like tablet, capsule, suspension, solution etc, in the usual form without modification or in slow release form, or with or without gastro-enteric protection. The peptide may further be applied in any form of topic application like ointment, cream, gel etc with or without transdermal facilitating device, or as inhalant of powder, dissolved, or as liposome protected form. The peptide may also be interpreted into its genetic sequence and cloned into an expression system, on its own or in combination with other peptide sequences, to generate a resulting peptide molecule to make use of the activity of the peptide as described in this report, with or without purification of the resulting peptide.<br>

It is understood that it may be possible to add additional amino acids to the amino or carboxyl termini of the above disclosed peptides as another method of practising the present invention. For example, one or two amino acids may be added to the disclosed peptide without affecting its biological function. It may also be possible to add three or four amino acids and still maintain the function of the peptides. These are all referred to as variants of the same peptide. Alternatively, one or two amino acids may be deleted from the peptide without affecting its biological activity. It may further be possible for three or four amino acids to be deleted without affecting the biological function of the peptides. These are referred to as fragments of the instant peptide. Furthermore, derivatives of the peptide such as conservative replacement of one amino acid for another within the same functional class may be used to practise another aspect of the present invention. For example, peptides having non-polar or hydrophobic side chains may be possible to substitute one side group for another without reducing biological activity. As a further example, linker/spacer may be inserted into the peptide to form variants, but the variants still retaining its active moiety as the<br>
original peptide used in this study These are also considered variants of the peptides. A peptide analogue as used herein, includes peptides that have amino acid molecules which mimic the structure of the natural amino acid e.g. an analog with a different backbone structure, or D-amino acid substitution. As a further example, although the amino acids used for synthesizing the peptides are in their L optical isomeric form, peptides with one or more of the amino acids in the sequence substituted with the D-form may have similar biological activities. The term "functional derivative" as used in the claims is meant to include fragments, variants, analogues or chemical derivatives of the peptide.<br>
As used herein, the term "hybrid peptide" is used to refer to peptides that contain additional peptides inserted into the original biologically active peptides having SEQ. ID no. 1-30 or their functional derivatives, but still retain substantially similar activity. The additional peptides include leader peptides that contain, for example, an amino acid sequence that is recognized by one or more prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell as a signal for secretion of the hybrid protein into the exterior or the cell. The secretion may be a direct secretion, or indirectly through secretory vesicles.<br>
"Substantially pure peptide" refers to peptides that are at least 10%w/w in purity, more preferably 20%, even more preferably 40% and much more preferably 60% and far more preferably larger than 90% pure. In the most preferred embodiment, the purity is larger than 99%. The substantially pure peptide can be used to prepare pharmaceutical and nutritional formulations that may be complex mixtures as described below.<br>
The use of the above-identified peptides in pharmaceutical formulations may be employed as possible treatment for immunological disorders or disease having secondary effect on immunity e.g. cancer or infections or any of the conditions mentioned above. The formulations may contain one of identified peptides mixed with other active or inactive constituents, including other peptides. E.g. two to several (e.g. 3-5) of the listed peptides may be added to the same formulation with or without other ingredients. Alternatively, one of the listed peptides may be used to prepare the formulation together with peptides not listed here. They can be administered in the form of intravenous, intramuscular, intracutaneous, subcutaneous or intradermal. The mode of administration may also be intra-arterial injection that leads directly to the organ of problem.. Other modes of administration are transdermal, inhalation as powder or spray, and other forms of delivery known by one in the art. The formulation may also be orally taken, and may contain earners that can be used to prevent_gastric digestion of the peptide after oral intake or any other carriers known in the art (for transdermal such as liposome).<br>
The pharmaceutical formulation may include any of the known pharmaceutical carriers. Examples of suitable carriers include any of the standard pharmaceutically accepted carrier known to those skilled in the art. These include but are not limited to, physiological saline solution, water, emulsions including oil and water mixtures or triglyceride emulsions, and other types of agents, fillers, coated tablets and capsules. The appropriate carrier may be selected based on the mode of administration of the pharmaceutical composition.<br>
The peptides may be administered via intravenous injection, intramuscular injection, intraperitoneal injection, subcutaneous injection, and subcutaneous implantation. The peptide may also be administered in any form of oral administration like tablet, capsule, suspension, solution etc, in the usual form without modification or in slow release form, or with or without gastro-enteric protection. The peptide may further be applied in any form of topic application like ointment, cream, gel etc with or without transdermal facilitating device. The peptide may also be interpreted into its genetic sequence and cloned into an expression system, on its own or in combination with other peptide sequences, to generate a resulting peptide molecule to make use of the activity of the peptide as described in this report.<br>
The dose of each peptide may be Ing - lOg per kg body weight. A preferred dose is lOng - lOmg per kg, and more preferably l|ig - Img per kg for an injection mode of administration. However, the effective dose can be as low as Ing per kg body weight, since one or more of the peptides may operate through receptors that will induce a cascade of normal physiological response. Alternatively, one or more of the peptides can just be an initiator for a whole cascade of reaction. For an oral intake, the amount may be 1ng - 10g per day per kg body weight, more preferably O.1µg - 1g per day per kg body weight and even more preferably 1µg - lOmg per day.<br>
VI.      Gene Therapy and Method of Treatment<br>
Gene therapy based on the discovered peptide sequences is performed by designing a nucleic acid sequence that code for one of these peptides. The nucleic acid may be synthesized chemically and operably ligated to a promoter, and cloned into an expression vector. The expression vector is then administered into the human body as the form of gene therapy for expression in the human cell. The term "genetic vectors" as used herein includes these expression vectors. Vectors that can be used for gene therapy includes adeno-associated virus (Mizuno, M. et al. (1998). Jpn J Cancer Res 89, 76-80), LNSX vectors (Miller, A.D. et al. (1993) Methods Enzymol 217, 581-599) and lentivirus (Goldman, M.J. et al. (1997) Hum Gene Ther 8, 2261-2268).<br>
Other vehicles for peptide delivery include expression vectors encoding the desired peptide that can be transferred into an organism which can replicate in the host organism to which it is desired to administer the peptide without significant detrimental effects on the health of the host organism. For example, the expression vectors may be transferred into an organism which is not pathogenic to the host organism to which it is desired to administer the peptide. In some embodiments the expression vector produces the desired peptide in a bacterial or fungal organism which does not have significant detrimental effects on the health of the host organism to which the peptide is to be administered. For example, the expression vector encoding the desired peptide may be an expression vector which produces the desired peptide in an organism such as lactic acid bacteria, E. coli, or yeast. In one embodiment, the expression vector produces the desired peptide in a microbe normally found in the mammalian gut or a.microbe tolerated by the mammalian digestive tract. Some of the microbial species in which the desired peptide can be expressed include, but are not limited to, Lactobacillus species, such as L. acidophilus, L. amylovonts, L. casei, L. crispatus, L. gallinarum, L.<br>
gasseri, L. johnsonii, L. paracasei, L. plantarum, L. reuteri, L. rhamnosus or others; Bifidobacterium species, such as B. adolescentis, B. animalus, B. bifidum, B. breve, B. infantis, B. lactis, B. longum or others; Enterococcus faecalis or Ent. facium; Sporolactobacillus inulinus; Bacillus subtilis or Bacillus cereus; Escherichia coli; Propionibacterium freudenreichii; or Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Saccharomyces boulardii<br>
Nucleic acid sequences that encode the peptides of the present invention, chemically synthesized or produced by other means, including but not limited to the reverse transcription of mRNA to produce cDNA molecules, are incorporated into expression vectors for gene transfer into the desired organisms by methods of genetic engineering familiar to those of skill in the art. The expression vectors may be DNA vectors or RNA vectors. For example, the expression vectors may be based on plasmid or viral genetic elements. The expression vectors may be vectors which replicate extra-chromosomally or vectors which integrate into the chromosome.<br>
The expression vectors comprise a promoter operably linked to a nucleic acid encoding a peptide of the present invention. The promoter may be a regulatable promoter, such as an inducible promoter, or a constitutive promoter. In some embodiments, the promoter may be selected to provide a desired level of peptide expression. In addition, if desired, the expression vectors may comprise other sequences to promote the production, presentation and/or secretion of peptides. In some embodiments a nucleic acid encoding a peptide of the present invention is operably linked to a nucleic acid sequence which directs the secretion of the peptide. For example, the nucleic acid encoding the peptide of the present invention may be operably linked to a nucleic acid encoding a signal peptide.<br>
In some embodiments, the expression vectors which are engineered to encode the peptides of the present invention may be expression vectors which are adapted for expressing the peptide of the present invention in a bacterial species that makes up the normal gut flora of mammals, such as Lactobacillus species and Bacillus subtilis Examples of such expression vectors can be found in US Patents No. 6,100,388, to Casas, and No. 5,728,571, to Bellini, respectively. These documents are hereby expressly incoiporated by reference in their entireties. It will be appreciated that any expression vector which facilitates the expression of a peptide of the present invention in an organism which is not detrimental to the health of the host organism to which the peptide is to be administered may be used.<br>
In some embodiments, the expression vectors which are engineered to encode the peptides of the present invention may be expression vectors which are adapted for expressing the peptide of the present invention in a yeast species that is well tolerated by the mammaliam gut , such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae; or, preferably, Saccharomyces boulardii, which can colonize the human gut and is used to treat certain forms of diarrhea. Yeast expression vectors can be used that constitutively express heterologous proteins and peptides, are highly stable, thus are well transmitted to progeny cells during mitosis and meiosis and may comprise coding sequence for a signal peptide or peptides that direct high levels of recombinant protein secretion. An example of such a yeast vector is given in US Patent No. 6,391,585, to Jang et a/., which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
The expression vectors encoding the peptides of the present invention may be introduced into the organism in which it is intended to express the peptides through techniques known in the art. These techniques include traditional methods of transforming bacteria, yeast, or other microbes, through the use of chemically competent bacterial cells,electroporation or lithium acetate transformation (for yeast), for example, as well as recent advances in the transformation of bacterial species recalcitrant to these procedures. In some embodiments, the expression vectors are introduced into lactic acid bacteria known to be recalcitrant to transformation using the method disclosed by Leer et al. (WO 95/35389), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The introduced sequences may be incorporated into microbial chromosomal DNA or may remain as extrachromosomal DNA elements.<br>
This genetically engineered microbe containing the expression vector can then be inoculated into the alimentary canal, vagina, trachea etc. to achieve sustained immuno-therapy. In some embodiments, the organisms expressing the peptides of the present invention are ingested in an inactive form or, preferably, in live form. In the gut these microorganisms produce said peptides, release them into the lumen by secretion or by lysis of the microorganism or otherwise present the peptides to the host, whereby the peptides produce their intended effect upon the host organism. In other embodiments, peptides are presented to the host at the mucous membrane of the nasal passages, vagina or the small intestine.<br>
Another method of the treatment is the use of liposomes as a means for delivering the specific nucleic acid to the cells in the human body. The nucleic acid (such as an expression vector containing a nucleic sequence that encodes peptides of sequence ID No.l to ID No.30) is delivered in an environment that encourages cellular uptake and chromosomal incorporation as described in Gao, X. and Huang, L. (1995) Gene Ther 2, 710-722 and US 6,207,456. Alternatively, the peptide itself can be encapsulated in the liposome and delivered directly, using a method described in US6,245,427. All the scientific publications and patents indicated above are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The nucleic acid sequences useful for the above-mentioned gene therapy and method of treatment include sequences that code for these peptides and functional derivatives thereof. Any one of the numerous nucleic acid sequences may be used to code for these peptides and their derivatives based on the degenerate codon system.<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
Delivery of peptides through genetically engineered Lactobadllus bacterial<br>
species<br>
The following is provided as one exemplary method to deliver peptides of this invention to a host as described above. A DNA sequence that encodes one of the peptides listed in table A above is synthesized by chemical means and this DNA sequence is inserted into an expression vector using standard techniques of genetic engineering familiar to those skilled in the art. The expression vector selected contains a constitutive promoter functional in Lactobacilli, a multiple cloning site for the introduction of DNA sequences in a specific 5' to 3' orientation as well as a selectable marker gene that confers resistance to an antibiotic (to aid in cloning procedures) and may comprise other sequences to assist in the production and/or secretion of the peptides, such as signal peptide sequences. An example of such a vector is provided by US Patent No. 5,592,908, to Pavla, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.. Briefly, this patent discusses several known promoters that function in Lactobadllus species, as well as a method for discovering novel promoters in said bacteria, any of which may be operably linked to a nucleic acid encoding a peptide of the present invention to express the peptide in Lactobacilli. A nucleic acid encoding a signal peptide, such as peptides comprising of 16 to 35 mostly hydrophobic amino acids that are active in Lactobadllus lactis described in US Patent No. 5,529,908, cited above, is interposed between the promoter and the nucleic acid encoding the peptide of the present invention such that the the nucleic acid encoding the signal peptide is in frame with the nucleic acid encoding the peptide of the present invention.<br>
In addition to the coding sequence of the peptide, the DNA sequence synthesized may comprise sequences to aid in the ligation and cloning of said DNA into the expression vector. For example, restriction enzyme recognition sites that correspond to ones found in the multiple cloning site of the vector can be incoiporated into the synthesized DNA at the 5' and 3' ends of the sequence, so<br>
that the sequence can be cloned in proper orientation within the vector. Both the vector and the synthesized DNA are digested with the particular restriction enzymes, then purified. Ligation reactions with the vector and the synthesized DNA are followed by transformation into a suitable strain of E. Coli. The transformed bacteria are plated on media containing the antibiotic to which the vector confers resistance. A colony of transformed bacteria is selected for growth cultures and plasmid preparation procedures; the presence of the synthesized DNA in the correct orientation is confirmed.<br>
This expression vector is then transformed into a bacterial host cell of a Lactobacillus species, such as L. acidophilus. Transformed cells are selected for by virtue of the selectable marker found within the vector sequence and the secretion of the peptide may be verified by performing a western blot, performing gel electrophoresis of peptides present in the growth medium or other standard techniques. A transformed colony of bacteria is chosen and used to prepare large-scale cultures of the genetically engineered bacteria. A culture of the genetically engineered bacteria expressing the desired peptide is grown up and at least a portion thereof is administered to the alimentary canal, vagina, trachea or other area of the host organism in which the bacteria are able to replicate. If desired, the bacterial cultures can be treated in a variety of ways to produce a supplement for enteric consumption by the host. These treatments include lyophilization or other methods of preserving the bacteria, in addition to combining the bacteria with carrier agents, such as solutions, solvents, dispersion media, delay agents, emulsions and the like. The use of these agents to prepare supplements is well known in the art. For example, the bacteria can be used to make cultured milk products or other foodstuffs for human consumption, such that the organism expressing the peptide colonizes the gut of the host organism. A number of different methods for incorporating specific strains of lactic acid bacteria into foodstuffs such as yogurt, kimchee, cheese and butter are disclosed in US Patent No. 6,036,952, to Oh, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Upon consuming the bacteria through one of any number of routes, the engineered organisms can colonize the gut and allow the presentation and/or absorption of the peptides of this invention via the mucosal layer of the gut.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Delivery of peptides throurh a genetically engineered form of Bacillus<br>
subtilis<br>
The following is provided as another exemplary method to deliver peptides of this invention to a host as described above. A DNA sequence that encodes one of the peptides listed in table A above is synthesized by chemical means and this DNA sequence is inserted into an expression vector via techniques of genetic engineering, all techniques being known in the art. The expression vector selected comprises a shuttle vector, such as pTZ18R (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ), capable of being propagated in both E. Coli and B. Subtilis and containing an antibiotic resistance gene for selecting colonies of transformed bacteria. This vector can contain a constitutive promoter active in B. subtilis, such as a promoter derived from the Sac B gene of B. subtilis as well as a nucleotide<br>
sequence encoding a signal or leader peptide active in B. subtilis that directs efficient export of expressed heterologous proteins from the bacterial cell. An example of such a vector is disclosed in US Patent No. 6,268,169, to Fahnestock, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Briefly, as detailed above, the DNA encoding a peptide of this invention will be synthesized with restriction enzymes sites and/or other sequences to facilitate; cloning of the DNA through techniques familiar to those with skill in the art. After transformation into E. Coll, plating, selection and propagation of the plasmid to create a plasmid stock, the plasmid is then be transformed into B. subtilis and transformants are selected by virtue of resistance to an antibiotic in the plating media.<br>
Peptide production in and secretion from the genetically engineered B. subtilis is verified using techniques well known to those with skill in the art, such as radiolabeling of peptides for autoradiographic detection after SDS-PAGE anaylsis or Western blotting.<br>
A culture of genetically engineered bacteria is grown up and at least a portion thereof is administered to the alimentary canal, vagina, trachea or other area of the host organism in which the bacteria are able to replicate.<br>

A DNA sequence that encodes one of the peplides listed in table A above is synthesized by chemical means and this DNA sequence is inserted into an expression vector via techniques of genetic engineering, all techniques being known in the art. The expression vector selected comprises a stably maintained yeast protein expression vector, comprising a constitutive yeast promoter such as pADHl, sites for replication of the vector in both yeast and E. Coli, a gene or genes that confer prototrophy to an auxolrophic yeast mutant for selection purposes, a multiple cloning site (MCS) and, if desired, sequences that code for a signal peptide. Vectors such as this are commercially available and well known in the art or can be readily constructed using standard techniques After insertion of the synthesized DNA into the yeast vector, transformation into E. Coli, plating of transformed E. Coli onto selective media, selection of a transformed bacterial colony and preparation of plasmid DNA from a growth culture of bacteria from said colony, the vector is transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae via well-known techniques such as lithium acetate transformation or electroporation. The strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae selected for transformation is a mutant auxotrophic strain that will require a gene on the plasmid in order to grow on minimal media plates. Transformed yeast colonies are isolated by plating the yeast on growth media lacking the gene provided on the vector. Only those yeast that have received the vector and its selective gene and are expressing that gene product will be able to grow into colonies on the minimal media. Verification of peptide secretion can be obtained by performing a Western blot, performing gel electrophoresis of peptides present in the growth medium or other standard techniques.<br>
A transformed colony of yeast is chosen and used to prepare large scale cultures. A culture of the genetically engineered yeast expressing the desired peptide is grown up and at least a portion thereof is administered to the alimentary canal, vagina, trachea or other area of the host organism in which the bacteria are able to replicate. If desired, the yeast cultures can be treated in a variety of ways to produce a supplement for enteric consumption by the host. These treatments include lyophilization or other methods of preserving yeast, in addition to combining the bacteria with carrier agents, such as solutions, solvents, dispersion media, delay agents, emulsions and the like. The use of these agents to prepare supplements is well known in the art. In another embodiment, the transformed yeast are used in the creation of food products, such as fermented milk products like yogurt and kefir, by techniques known to those skilled in the art. As with live lactic acid bacterial cultures in these foodstuffs, the transformed yeast colonize the gut at least transiently and serve to present peptides to the host via the gut lumen.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
