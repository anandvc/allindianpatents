PHOSPHORAMIDATE ALKYLATOR PRODRUGS<br>
CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims benefit of U.S. provisional patent application No.<br>
60/695,755 filed 29 Jun 2005, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of Invention<br>
[0002] The present invention provides compositions and methods for treating cancer and<br>
other hyperproliferative disease conditions with phosphoramidate alkylator prodrugs. The<br>
present invention generally relates to the fields of chemistry, biology, molecular biology,<br>
pharmacology, and medicine.<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
[0003] Alkylating agents ("alkylators" or "mustards") used in cancer chemotherapy<br>
encompass a diverse group of chemicals that have the ability to alkylate biologically vital<br>
macromolecules such as DNA under physiological conditions (see Hardman et al, The<br>
Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 2001,1389-1399, McGraw-Hill, New York, USA).<br>
DNA alkylation is postulated to be an important mechanism in the antitumor activity of<br>
alkylators. The chemotherapeutic alkylators act as strong electrophiles, for example, through<br>
the formation of neighboring-heteroatom-stabilized onium intermediates such as an aziridine<br>
or an aziridinium cation.<br>
[0004] Phosphoramidate based alkylators used in cancer therapy, such as<br>
Cyclophosphamide and Ifosfamide, are an important subclass of chemotherapeutic alkylators.<br>
Cyclophosphamide and Ifosfamide are each activated in the liver and the active alkylator<br>
released alkylates nucleopbilic moieties such as the DNA within the tumor cells to act as a<br>
chemotherapeutic agent. If the active alkylators are released away from the tumor, DNA and<br>
other nucleophilic moieties such as the phosphate, amino, sulfhydryl, hydroxyl, carboxyl and<br>
imidazo groups of biomolecules of healthy non-cancerous cells, can get alkylated. Such<br>
alkylation of healthy cells canand result in unwanted toxic events in patients (see Hardman et<br>
al., supra).<br><br><br>
[0005] There remains a need for new phosphoramidate based alkylators that can be used to<br>
treat cancer or other hyperproliferative disease conditions, preferably compounds less toxic to<br>
normal cells. The present invention meets these needs and provides novel phosphoramidate<br>
alkylator prodrugs as well as methods of therapy employing them, as summarized in the<br>
following section.<br>

modulated depending on for example the electron withdrawing nature and the steric bulk of<br>
the Rsui moiety and can provide phosphoramidate alkylators and prodrugs thereof which are<br>
more toxic to tumors in general and hypoxic zones of tumor in particular over healthy cells.<br>

[0055] Certain compounds of the present invention possess asymmetric carbon atoms<br>
(optical centers) or double bonds; the racemates, diastereomers, geometric isomers,<br>
regioisomers and individual isomers (e.g., separate enantiomers) are all intended to be<br>
encompassed within the scope of the present invention. The compounds of the present<br>
invention may also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of the<br>
atoms that constitute such compounds. For example, the compounds may be radiolabeled<br>
with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (H), iodine-125 ( I) or carbon-14<br>

compounds which are prepared with relatively nontoxic acids or bases, depending on the<br>
particular substituents found on the compounds described herein. When compounds of the<br>
present invention contain relatively acidic functionalities, base addition salts can be obtained<br>
by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired<br>
base, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of salts derived from<br><br>
pharmaceutically-acceptable inorganic bases include aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper,<br>

invention contain relatively basic functionalities, acid addition salts can be obtained by<br>
contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired acid,<br>
either neat or in a suitable inert solvent Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid<br>
addition salts include those derived from inorganic acids like hydrochloric, hydrobromic,<br>

glucuronic or galactunoric acids and the like (see, e.g., Berge, S.M., et al, "Pharmaceutical<br>
Salts", Journal of Pharmaceutical Science, 1977,66,1-19). Certain specific compounds of<br>
the present invention contain both basic and acidic functionalities that allow the compounds<br>
to be converted into either base or acid addition salts.<br>
[0057] The neutral forms of ike compounds may be regenerated by contacting the salt with<br>
a base or acid and isolating the parent compound in the conventional manner. The parent<br>
form of the compound differs from the various salt forms in certain physical properties, such<br>
as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts are equivalent to the parent form of the<br>
compound for the purposes of the present invention.<br>
[0058] Certain compounds of the present invention can exist in unsolvated forms as well as<br>
solvated forms, including hydrated forms. In general, the solvated forms are equivalent to<br>
unsolvated forms and are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present<br>
invention. Certain compounds of the present invention may exist in multiple crystalline or<br><br>
amorphous forms. In general, all physical forms are equivalent for the uses contemplated by<br>
the present invention and are intended to be within the scope of the present invention.<br>

Thus, the glucose analog can differ from glucose or a derivative such as DG and glucosamine<br>
in that it is an epimer thereof. In addition, the glucose analog can be a fluorinated derivative<br>
of any of the foregoing compounds. Moreover, the oxygen in the ring of any of the foregoing<br>
compounds can be substituted with an isostere selected from the group consisting of S,<br>
sulfone, and the like. For example, glucose analog can be 5-tbio-D-gIucose or a derivative<br>
thereof.<br>

thio group is the point of attachment to another group or moiety.<br>
[0061] The terms CO, C(O), C(=O), -CO- are used interchangeably herein. The terms CO2<br>
and COO are used interchangeably herein.. The terms; SO2, S(0)2 are used interchangeably<br>
herein. The terms SO and S(=O) are used interchangeably herein. The terms PO and P(=O)<br>
are used interchangeably herein.<br>
[0062] As used herein, a "bioisostere" of a chemical moiety Such SS mOleCUlC, pup, W<br>
atom means another chemical moiety having similar size and spatial disposition of electron<br>
pair or pairs. BioisOSteres and bioisosterism are well-known tools for predicting the<br>
biological activity of compounds, based upon the premise that compounds with similar size,<br>
shape, and electron density can have similar biological activity. Known bioisosteric<br>
replacements include, for example, the interchangeability of-F, -OH, -NH2, -CI, and -CH3;<br>
the mterchangeability of-Br and -1-C3H7; the interchangeability of-I and -*-C4H?; the<br>
interchangeability of-0-, -S-, -NH-, -CH2, and -Se-; the interchangeability of-N=, -CH=, and<br>
-P= (in cyclic or noncyclic moieties); the interchangeability of phenyl and pyridyl groups; the<br><br>
interchangeability of -C=C- and -S- (for example, benzene and thiophene); the<br>
interchangeability of an aromatic nitrogen (^^(R^-Ra,.) for an unsaturated carbon (Rar-<br>
C(=Rar)-Rar); and the interchangeability of-CO-, -SO-, and -SO2-. These examples are not<br>
limiting on the range of bioisosteric equivalents and one of skill in the art will be able to<br>
identify other bioisosteric replacements known in the art. See, for example, Patani et ah,<br>
1996, Chem. Rev. 96:3147-16; and Burger, 1991, A. Prog. Drug Res. 37:287-371.<br>
[0063] A reasonable quantitative prediction of the binding ability or the function of a<br>
known molecule can be made based on the spatial arrangement of a small number of atoms or<br>
functional groups in the molecule. As used herein, such an arrangement is called a<br>
"pharmacophore", and once the pharmacophore or pharmacophores in a molecule have been<br>
identified, this information can be used to identify other molecules containing the same or<br>
similar pharmacophores. Such methods are well known to persons of ordinary skill in the art<br>
of medicinal chemistry, and as the structural information described in this application<br>
identifies the pharmacophore of phosphoramidate alkylator prodrugs and phosphoramidate<br>
alkylators. An example of programs available to perform pharmacophore -related searches is<br>
the program 3D Pharmacophore search from the Chemical Computing Group (see<br>
http://www.chemcomp.com/fdept/prodinfo.htm).<br>
[0064] "Optional" or "optionally" means that the subsequently described event or<br>
circumstance can, but need not, occur, and that the description includes instances where the<br>
event or circumstance occurs and instances in which it does not. For example, "heterocyclo<br>
group optionally mono- or di- substituted with an alkyl group" means that the alkyl can, but<br>
need not be, present, and the description includes situations where the heterocyclo group is<br>
mono- or disubstituted with an alkyl group and situations where the heterocyclo group is not<br>
substituted with an alkyl group.<br>
|0065] A combination of substituents or variables is permissible only if such a combination<br>
results in a stable or chemically feasible compound. A stable compound or chemically<br>
feasible compound is one in which the chemical structure is not substantially altered when<br>
kept at a temperature of 4 °C or less, in the absence of moisture or other chemically reactive<br>
conditions, for at least a week.<br>
[0066] As used herein, a "prodrug" means a compound that, after administration, is<br>
metabolized or otherwise converted to an active or more active form with respect to at least<br>
one biological property, relative to itself. To produce a prodrug, a pharmaceutically active<br><br>
compound (or a suitable precursor thereof) is modified chemically such that the modified<br>
form is less active or inactive, but the chemical modification is effectively reversible under<br>
certain biological conditions such that a pharmaceutically active form of the compound is<br>
generated by metabolic or other biological processes. A prodrug can have, relative to the<br>
drug, altered metabolic stability or transport characteristics, fewer side effects or lower<br>
toxicity, or improved flavor, for example {see the reference Nogrady, 1985, Medicinal<br>
Chemistry A Biochemical Approach, Oxford University Press, New York, pages 388-392).<br>
Prodrugs can also be prepared using compounds that are not drugs but which upon activation<br>
under certain biological conditions generate a pharmaceutically active compound. As used<br>
herein a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug is a prodrug that upon activation releases the<br>
active phosphoramidate alkylator.<br>
[0067] As used herein, a "cytotoxic agent" is an agent or compound that produces a toxic<br>
effect on cells. As used herein, a "cytostatic agent" is an agent that inhibits or suppresses<br>
cellular growth and multiplication.<br>
[0068] As used herein "hypoxic cells" are cells residing in a hypoxic environment in vivo<br>
such as, for example, in a hypoxic tumor zone, or in vitro. As used herein "normoxic cells"<br>
are cells residing in a normoxic environment in vivo or in vitro. As used herein "hypoxic<br>
cytotoxicity" of a compound or agent is its cytotoxicity on hypoxic cells. As used herein<br>
"normoxic cytotoxicity" of a compound or agent is its cytotoxicity on normoxic cells.<br>
[00691 As used herein, a "bioreductive group" refers to a group that accepts electrons in an<br>
oxidation-reduction reaction. The bioreductive group is a group (1) that can be reduced, i.e.,<br>
a group that can accept electrons, hydrogen, and/or or an hydride ion; (2) that can be reduced<br>
111 VIVO (HluVOI ill YlfTv'i P) mat can ^e reduced in vivo and/or in vitro under hypoxia; (4) that<br>
can be reduced m VW 9* VI W&amp;0 ty Dittos*, thiols, or by photochemical or<br>
eleCtrOChemiCal means; Or (5) that Can be eliminated and/or cleaved by abiological process,<br>
such as by enzymatic hydrolysis, metabolism etc.<br>
[0070] F°r example, and as described in more detail below, one bioreductive group is a<br>
nitroimidazole that may be substituted with a variety of groups. Other examples of<br>
bioreductive groups include, but are not limited to, groups based on electron deficient<br>
nitrobenzenes, electron deficient nitrobenzoic acid amides, nitroazoles, nitroimidazoles,<br>
mtrothiophenes, nitrOthiaZOleS, nitTOOXazoleS, nitrofurans, and nitropyrroles, where each of<br>
these classes of moieties may be optionally substituted, such that the redox potential for the<br><br>
bioreductive group lies within a range where the group can undergo reduction in the hypoxic<br>
conditions of a tumor, by DT-diaphorase, and/or by a thiol. One of skill in the art will<br>
understand, in view of the disclosure herein, how to substitute these and other bioreductive<br>
groups to provide a a bioreductive group having a redox potential that lies within said range.<br>
[0071] Generally, one of skill in the art can "tune" the redox potential of a bioreductive<br>
group by modifying that group to contain electron withdrawing groups, electron donating<br>
groups, or some combination of such groups. For example, nitrothiophene, nitrofbran, and<br>
nitrothiazole groups may be substituted with one or more electron donating groups, including<br>
but not limited to methyl, methoxy, or amine groups, to achieve the desired redox potential.<br>
In another example, the nitropyrrole moiety can be substituted with an electron withdrawing<br>
group, including but not limited to cyano, carboxamide, -CF3, and sulfonamide groups, to<br>
achieve the desired redox potential. For this purpose, strong electron withdrawing groups<br>
such as cyano, sulfone, sulfonamide, carboxamide, or-CF3, and milder electron withdrawing<br>
groups such as -CKb-halogen where halogen is -F, -CI, or -Br, can be used.<br>
[0072] As used herein, an "anti-neoplastic agent", "anti-tumor agent", or "anti-cancer<br>
agent", refers to any agent used in the treatment of cancer. Such agents can be used alone or<br>
in combination with other compounds and can alleviate, reduce, ameliorate, prevent, or place<br>
or maintain in a state of remission of clinical symptoms or diagnostic markers associated with<br>
neoplasm, tumor or cancer. Anti-neoplastic agents include, but are not limited to, anti-<br>
angiogenic agents, alkylating agents or alkylators, antimetabolite, certain natural products,<br>
platinum coordination complexes, anthracenediones, substituted ureas, methylhydrazine<br>
derivatives, adrenocortical suppressants, certain hormones and antagonists, anti-cancer<br>
polysaccharides, chemoprotectants, and certain herb or other plant extracts.<br>
[0073] As used herein, "cancer" refers to one of a pup of more than 100 diseases caused<br>
by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells that can take the form of solid<br>
tumors, lymphomas, and non-solid cancers such as leukemia.<br>
[0074] As used herein, "malignant cancer" refers to cancer cells or cancers that have the<br>
capacity of metastasis, with loss of both growth and positional control.<br>
[0075] As used herein, "neoplasm" (neoplasia) or "tumor" refers to abnormal new cell or<br>
tissue growth, which can be benign or malignant.<br><br>
[0076] As used herein, "treating" a condition or patient refers to taking steps to obtain<br>
beneficial or desired results, including clinical results. For purposes of this invention,<br>
beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, alleviation or amelioration<br>
of one or more symptoms of cancer or other hyperproliferative disease conditions,<br>
diminishment of extent of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration,<br>
palliation or stabilization of the disease state, and other beneficial results described below.<br>
[0077] As used herein, "reduction" of a symptom or symptoms (and grammatical<br>
equivalents of this phrase) means decreasing of the severity or frequency of the symptom(s),<br>
or elimination of the symptom(s).<br>
[0078] As used herein, "administering" or "administration of a drug to a subject (and<br>
grammatical equivalents of this phrase) includes both direct administration, including self-<br>
administration, and indirect administration, including the act of prescribing a drug. For<br>
example, as used herein, a physician who instructs a patient to self-administer a drug.and/or<br>
provides a patient with a prescription for a drug is administering the drug to the patient.<br>
[0079] As used herein, a "therapeutically effective amount" of a drug is an amount of a<br>
drug that, when administered to a subject with cancer, will have the intended therapeutic<br>
effect, e.g., alleviation, amelioration, palliation or elimination of one or more manifestations<br>
of cancer in the subject. The full therapeutic effect does not necessarily occur by<br>
administration of one dose, and can occur only after administration of a series of doses.<br>
Thus, a therapeutically effective amount can be administered in one or more administrations.<br>
[0080] As used herein, a "prophylactically effective amount" of a drug is an amount of a<br>
drug that, when administered to a subject, will have the intended prophylactic effect, e.g.,<br>
preventing or delaying the onset (or reoccurrence) of disease or symptoms, or reducing the<br>
likelihood of the onset (or reoccurrence) of disease or symptoms. Tke full prophylactic effect<br>
does not necessarily occur by administration of one dose, and can occur only after<br>
administration of a series of doses. Thus, a prophylactically effective amount can be<br>
adrninistered in one or more administrations.<br>
[0081] AS USed herein, a "Second line" therapy refers to therapy that is given for the<br>
treatment of a cancer which has failed to respond to a first chemotherapy regimen or "first<br>
line" chemotherapy. "Third line" therapy refers to therapy that is given for the treatment of a<br>
cancer when both initial treatment, first-line therapy, and subsequent treatment, second-line<br>
therapy, don't work, or stop working is called.<br><br>
[0082] As used herein "LogP" means a measure of lipophilicity of a substance determined<br>
based on the partitioning of the substance betwen octanol and water.<br>
IIa. Compounds<br>
[0083] Most drug-mediated cancer therapies, including phosphoramidate alkylator-based<br>
therapies, rely on poisons, called cytotoxic agents, selective for dividing cells targeting, for<br>
example, their replicating DNA, microtutbule, and various growth factors and growth factor<br>
receptors. These drugs are effective, because cancer cells generally divide more frequently<br>
than normal cells. However, such drugs almost inevitably do not kill all of the cancer cells in<br>
the patient One reason is that cancer cells can mutate and develop drug resistance. Another<br>
is that not all cancer cells divide more frequently than normal cells and slowly-dividing<br>
cancer cells can be as, or even more, insensitive to such cytotoxic agents as normal cells.<br>
[0084] Some cancer cells reside in a poorly vascularized solid tumor, are unable to generate<br>
the energy required for cell division and divide slowly. As a tumor grows, it requires a blood<br>
supply and, consequently, growth of new vasculature. The new vasculature that supports<br>
tumor growth is often disordered; leaving significant regions of the tumor under-vascularized<br>
and even the vascularized regions subject to intermittent blockage. These under-vascularized<br>
and blocked regions of the tumor become hypoxic - they have a lower oxygen concentration<br>
or a lower oxygen partial pressure than the corresponding normal tissue, and the cells in them<br>
exhibit slower rates of division. Thus, the median oxygen concentration of only ten percent<br>
of solid tumors falls in the normal range of 40 to 60 mm Hg, and fifty percent of solid tumors<br>
exhibit median oxygen concentrations of less than 10 mm Hg.<br>
[(11)891 Tn6 hVDOXlC STOilS Of &amp;e ^mor rePresent a signifi03111 source of metastases and<br>
cancer cells resistant to therapy (see for example, De Jaeger et aL, Br J Cancer. 2001,<br>
84(9):1280-5 and Rofstad et aL, Br J Cancer. 1999,80(11):1697-707). Not surprisingly,<br>
then, low tumor oxygen levels are associated with a poor response to therapy, increased<br>
metastases and poor Survival. The mechanisms of activation and action of<br>
Cyclophosphamide and Ifosfamide can exemplify how these agents can not specifically target<br>
the difficult to kill hypoxic zone of a tumor.<br>
[0086J Both Cyclophosphamide and Ifosfamide are prodrugs and can be oxidatively<br>
activated in the liver via intermediates to yield active phosphoramidate alkylators, Alkylators<br><br>
1 (cylophosphamide mustard) and 2 (ifosfamide mustard), respectively (see below). The<br>
charge neutral Hemiacetals 1 and 2, can have a half life of many minutes and can permeate in<br>
and out of the cell. In contrast, the anionic Alkylators 1 and 2 are much less cell membrane<br>
permeable and once formed extracellularly inefficiently kills the cell by alkylating cellular<br>
DNA.<br>
[0087] When the phosphoramidate alkylators reach the tumor, they generally kill cells in<br>
the fast growing, well vascularized, normoxic, outer zone of the tumor. However, these<br>
phosphoramidate alkylators are not as effective in permeating into the less vascularized,<br>
slower growing, progressively hypoxic inner tumor zones and in killing tumor cells therein.<br>
Before any of these active alkylators reach the tumor, they can react with healthy cells and<br>
result in toxicity and/or cell death.<br><br>

reduced derivatives of a variety of chemical groups (see the reference Workman et al, 1993,<br>
Cancer andMetOSt. ifev. 12; 73-82), and prodrugs of cytotoxins can be developed to exploit<br>
such bioreductive environments (PCT Application Nos. US 04/009667 and US 05/08161;<br>
PCT/US2005/041959 and PCT/US2005/042095, all Matteucci et al). Such a hypoxia<br>
reducable (or hypoxia activated) prodrug can be constructed by employing a bioreductive<br>
group (Z3) together with an alkylator. The bioreductive group is employed as part of a<br>
Trigger moiety covalently bonded or attached to the phosphoramidate alkylator.<br><br>
[0089] The compounds of the invention can generally be described as phosphoramidate<br>
alkylator prodrugs. In general, the phosphoramidate alkylator prodrugs of the invention have<br>
the following structure<br>
Alk-Trigger<br>
wherein Alk is a phosphoramidate alkylator and Trigger T has a structure L-Z3, wherein the<br>
linker L is bonded to a bioreductive group Z3. La one embodiment, the Trigger T is a hypoxia<br>
activated trigger.<br>

155-85, isolated compounds of which are disclosed therein, and are not the subject of the<br>
present invention. In some embodiments, the phosphoramidate alkylator prodrugs of the<br>
present invention have one or more of the following characteristics: (i) a higher hypoxic<br>
toxicity or lower value of IC50 or IC90, in hypoxic tissue, (ii) lower normoxic cytoxicity, and<br>
(iii) less toxic side effect profile or some combination of these attributes. In some<br>
embodiments, the phosphoramidate alkylator prodrugs of the present invention differ from<br>
known phosphoramidate alkylator derivatives by: (i) the nature of the phosphoramidate<br>
alkylator released, (ii) the nature of the linker (L) and/or the bioreductive group Z3, (iii) the<br>
presence of more than one bioreductive group moiety, or some combination of these<br>
attributes (iv) increased hypoxia selective cytoxicity measured by larger HCR values (v)<br>
increased aqueous solubility (vi) increased stability to liver microsomal degradation and/or<br>
(vii) providing effective phospnoramide alkylator pfodfllgS that 9T6 acMral and aVOld<br>

[0091] To understand why the prodrug compounds of the present invention represent a<br>
significant advance over known anti-cancer phosphoramidate alkylator derivatives, an<br>
understanding of tumor biology particularly under hypoxia and pharmacokinetics, and<br>
pharmacodynamics of prodrugs provided herein in particular is helpful.<br>
[00921 For effective tumor therapy, a hypoxia activated prodrug should be much less toxic<br>
t0 healthy normoxic cells compared to hypoxic tumor cells. In some embodiments, the<br>
hypoxia activated prodrugs of the invention are less active and less toxic to normoxic cells<br><br>
than hypoxic cells. When such a prodrug of the invention encounters the hypoxic, reducing<br>
environment within solid tumor tissue, reduction of the bioreductive group causes<br>
dissociation of the the phosphoramidate alkylator or the active cytotoxin. The<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator is released within the tumor zone and can more easily penetrate<br>
the hypoxic region of the solid tumor. These phosphoramidate alkylators can kill cells in the<br>
difficult to reach hypoxic region of the solid tumor while minimizing death of non-cancerous<br>
healthy cells and toxic side effects to the patient. Thus the present invention provides<br>
hypoxia activated prodrugs that are much less toxic to healthy, normoxic cells compared to<br>
hypoxic, tumor cells.<br>
[0093] In certain embodiments, the phosphoramidate alkylator prodrugs of the present<br>
invention employ nitro containing aromatic or indole quinone moieties as bioreductive<br>
groups in the Trigger T. In the hypoxic tumor, the nitro group is reduced to an<br>
hydroxylarnino or an amino group and flow of an electron pair from the amino or<br>
hydroxylamino group through the conjugated % electron system of the Trigger T releases the<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator. In another embodiment, in a hypoxic tumor, an indole quinone is<br>
reduced to an indole hydroquinone and flow of an electron pair from the hydroquinone<br>
through the Trigger T releases the phosphoramidate alkylator. The released phosphoramidate<br>
alkylator kills cells in and/or near the hypoxic tumor.<br>
[0094] A number of enzymes can be responsible for the reduction of the bioreductive group<br>
Z3 in the Trigger. For example, cytochrome P450 reductase enzymes can reduce the nitro or<br>
a quinone moiety in a bioreductive group in a first step respectively to a N02('-) or a<br>
serniquinone radical anion. The hypoxic tumor zone can have a higher concentration of the<br>
reductase enzyme compared to normoxic tissue. Under normoxia, as in well vascularized<br>
Mi assiirx ii in pro ftp * T) OI to "***"" "**mion<br>
formed can react with oxygen to revert back to the bioreductive group and not ultimately<br>
generate or release the phosphoramidate alkylator. The aryl or heteroaryl moiety covalently<br>
bonded to the NO2C-) or the serniquinone radical anion modulates the oxygen sensitivity of<br>
the radical anion.<br>
[0095] The oxygen sensitivity of the bioreductive group varies depending partly on the<br>
reduction potential of the bioreductive group. Thus, for example, one bioreductive group can<br>
get reduced in a hypoxic tumor zone having 1 % oxygen, another in a zone having 0.1%<br>
oxygen, and yet another in a zone having 0.01 % oxygen.<br><br>
[0096] A bioreductive group loses some or all of its hypoxic specificity when it is so easily<br>
reduced that the cytochrome P450 reductase enzyme or other reducing agents ("reducing<br>
agents") in healthy normoxic tissue can reduce it in the presence of oxygen. If a NO2C-) or a<br>
semiquinone radical anion in a bioreductive group does not react or reacts slowly with<br>
oxygen, the radical anion itself can release the phosphoramidate alkylator, or can be further<br>
reduced and release (he phosphoramidate alkylator, causing toxicity to healthy normoxic cells<br>
and tissue. The novel phosphoramidate alkylator prodrugs of the present invention are more<br>
toxic to the hypoxic cancer cells and tissue compared to the healthy normoxic cells and<br>
tissue.<br>
[0097] The ease or difficulty of reducing the bioreductive group Z3 can be measured by the<br>
reduction potential of the bioreductive group and is influenced by the linker (L), and the<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator (Alk-H). For example, attachment of the bioreductive group to an<br>
electron withdrawing linker or an electron withdrawing phosphoramidate alkylator can make<br>
the bioreductive group easier to reduce compared to when it is covalently bonded to an<br>
electron rich linker or'an electron rich phosphoramidate alkylator.<br>
[0098] The Trigger T can be oxidized, hydrolyzed, or thiolyzed and can release the<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator in a hypoxia non-senselective manner. Telcyta™, a<br>
phosphoramidate alkyltor prodrug that is in the clinic, can release an active toxin in absence<br>
of hypoxia by the action of glutathione transferase (see, e.g., phophorarnidate alkylator If in<br>
the "Methods of Treatment" section). The chemical nature of the linker and/or the<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator can influence the oxidative, hydrolytic, or thiolytic stability of the<br>
prodrug with respect to phosphoramidate alkylator release. In one embodiment of the present<br>
invention a hypoxia activated phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug, does not release the<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator in a hypoxia non-specific, oxidation, hydrolysis, or thiolysis.<br>
[0099] According to the present invention, a properly employed Trigger in a<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug can be used to "tune" the pharmacokinetic property of the<br>
prodrug without altering its cytotoxic properties. For example, a high volume of distribution<br>
of an anticancer agent ensures that the prodrug is absorbed in the tissue quickly. According<br>
to the present invention, in one embodiment, the volume of distribution of a phosphoramidate<br>
alkylator prodrug can be modulated by employing a Trigger T containing an amino group<br>
capable of forming an anunamum cation under physiological conditions, in one<br>
embodiment, a Trigger T containing a quaternary ammonium group can yield a prodrug<br><br>
compound of the invention having a high volume of distribution while avoiding possible<br>
endosomal trapping. In another emdodiment, a Trigger T comprising a carboxyl functionality<br>
will exist as the anionic carboxylate anion form. CC^Oin the extracellular space outside of<br>
normal healthy tissue and not pass easily through the normal cell membrane. The lower pH<br>
in tumor extracellular space can convert the CO20 to the uncharged "CO2H" form allowing<br>
the prodrug to pass through tumor cell membrane.<br>
[0100] A phosphoramidate alkylator containing a hydroxyl, amino, mercapto, and/or a<br>
carboxyl group can be transformed into a prodrug by covalently attaching a Trigger T to one<br>
or more of these functional groups. During the transformation from a phosphoramidate<br>
alkylator to a prodrug, a hydroxyl group in the phosphoramidate alkylator can be<br>
transformed, for example, to an ether or an acetal; an amino to an allcylarnino, a carbamate, or<br>
an amide; a carboxyl group to an ester; and a mercapto group to a thioether or a tbioacyl, as<br>
described in greater detail in the Method of Synthesis and the Experimental sections below.<br>
These transformations can yield a prodrug which is less polar or more lipophilic than the<br>
corresponding phosphoramidate alkylator. Non polar phosphoramidale alkylator prodrugs<br>
may not be readily soluble in aqueous pharmaceutical carriers or diluents. Solubility<br>
enhancer groups like CO2H, amino, alkylamino, dialylamino, and hydroxyl can be employed<br>
in the Trigger T to modulate the solubility of the prodrug and overcome any problems<br>
encountered in preparing aqueous formulations of the phosphoramidate alkylator prodrugs.<br>
[0101] Phosphoramidate alkylators of the present invention can have one or more N-(2-<br>
haloalkyl) or N-(2-haloethyl) and/or one or more aziridine moiety covalently bonded<br>
to a P=0 moiety as shown below. Upon release of the anionic phosphoramidate alkylator<br>
moiety an aziridine or aziridium species forms which can alkylate DNA (See EXAMPLE<br>
wSnm*% Deplngpnfc«W*«BWta|ffltUKOfll!l(lIli<br>
substituents, the aziridinium formation kinetics can vary. For example, as shown in the<br>
reaction sequence below, the rate of alkylation can increase when tne W2% moiety is<br>
changed from NH2 to ^see Engle et al, J. Med. Chan., 1987,25:1347-57).<br>
Substituents on the nitrogen atoms can alter the geometry of the phosphoramidate alkylator,<br>
the delOCalizatiOIl Of the lOIie electron pair on this nitrogen atom in the P=0 moiety, the<br>
availability of the nitrogen lone electron pairs for aziridinium or subsequent aziridine<br>
formation, and the aqueOUS SOluMity Of the phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug and the<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator.<br><br><br>
[0102] The present invention arises in part out of the discovery that phosphoramidate<br>
aikylator prodrugs employing 2-rdtroiinidazole-bioreductive group show unexpectedly high<br>
hypoxic cytotoxicity, low normoxic toxicity and high HCR and improved solubility. For<br>
example, Compounds 24 and 25 were respectively, 400 to 1000 fold more toxic in hypoxic<br>
cells than in normoxic cells in an anti-proliferation cytotoxicity assay with a IC5o of 0.05 uM<br>
in cells under hypoxia. (See EXAMPLE section). Phosphoramidate aikylator prodrugs<br>

HCR values of known phosphoramidate aikylator derivatives having 2-nitrotliiophene-5-yl,<br>

[0238] Known phosphoramidate alkylator prodrugs such as ifosfamide and<br>
cyclophosphamide metabolize to produce cytotoxic by products such as acrolein and<br>
chloroacetaldehyde which cause undesirable patient side-effects such as hemorrhagic cystitis,<br>
coma or death. In one embodiment, the present invention provides a phosphoramidate<br>
alkylator prodrug which upon metabolism produces less toxic by products per treatment as<br>
compared to those produced by the metabolism of ifosfamide and/or cyclophosphamide. In<br>
one embodiment, the phosplioromidate alkylator prodrugs of the present invention do not<br>
produce acrolein by in vivo metabolism. Examples of toxic by products resulting from<br>
metabolism of the prodrugs of the invention include chloro, bromo, alkylsulfonyloxy,<br>
heteroalkylsulfonyloxy, arylsulfonyloxy, orheteroarylsulfonyloxy-acetaldehyde, (for<br>
metabolic production of chloroacetaldehyde from ifosfamide see the reference Hardman et<br>
al, supra, page 1396). In another embodiment, the present invention provides a<br>

[0239] The phosphoramidate alkylator derivative formed upon the reduction of Z3 can be<br>
different from the phosphoramidate alkylator being protected and the phosphoramidate<br>
alkylator prodrug and is termed a modified phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug. For example,<br>
a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug can yield a modified phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug<br>
Alk-Triggermod upon reduction of the bioreductive group (Z3). When reduction of the<br>
bioreductive group forms a modified phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug, the linker (L)<br>
bonded to the phosphoramidate alkylator can undergo degradation to yield either the<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator or some other modified phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug.<br>
[02401 hi one embodiment, the present invention provides a compound which demonstrates<br>
a bystander effect upon activation in hypoxic tissue by incorporating a linker (L) as described<br>
above. In one embodiment, the bystander effect allows a modified phosphoramidate<br>
alkylator of the present invention to diffuse or penetrate into tumor zones which are not<br>
hypoxic enough to activate the prodrug compounds of the invention but reside nearby the<br>
hypoxic tumor zone which can activate these prodrugs.<br>
•<br>
[0241] Upon reduction of the bioreductive group (Z3) within the Trigger T is modified to<br>

[0244] In one embodiment, the present invention provides a Trigger T which upon<br>
bioreduction is modified to TriggerMod or TM and the phosphoramidate alleviator is separated<br>
from TM in less than 0.1 second. In another embodiment, the phosphoramidate alkylator is<br>
separated from TM in between 0.01 to 0.10 second. In another embodiment, the<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator is separated from TM in between 0.1 to 1.0 second. In another<br>
embodiment, the active phosphoramidate is separated from TM in between 1.0 to 10.0<br>
seconds. In another embodiment, the phosphoramidate alkylator is separated from TM in<br>
between 10.0 to 100.0 seconds.<br>
[0245] In a related embodiment, upon activation or reduction, a phosphoramidate alkylator<br>
prodrug yields a prodrug with a modified Trigger T (TM) which subsequently releases the<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator 20 to 500 um from the site of activation or reduction; or 20 to 100<br>
um from the site of activation or reduction. Bystander effect of a phosphoramidate alkylator<br>
prodrug of the present invention can be measured using cellular spheroids and multilayer<br>
cellular assay (for example of such assays see Kyle et al, Cancer Res. 2004,64(17):6304-9<br>
and West et al, Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol., 1987, 20(2): 109-14); and as described in<br>
greater detail in Examples 35 and 37. Tumor cells can be grown in culture as multicellular<br>
spheroids to create an in vitro model of the tumor microenvironment in solid tumors<br>
containing a hypoxic region and a quiescent cell population responding to the environmental<br>
stresses of limited nutrients and increased waste production. These spheroids have the unique<br>
property of developing gradients of oxygen and nutrients as the aggregate of cells continue to<br>
divide and grow outward. After the viable rim reaches approximately 150 um in size, a<br>
hypoxic region develops, that drives the cells in this region into a quiescent state and<br>
eventually to cell death. A necrotic core develops as a result of the dying cells. The spheroid<br>
can be divided into 4 distinct compartments for modeling the effectiveness of a hypoxic<br>
activated prodrug: 1) the outer aerobic and actively dividing region; 2) a region of<br>
intermediate hypoxia; 3) a region of hypoxia where cells are not cycling; 4) and a necrotic<br>
core containing dead cells and cellular debris. The response of a drug will depend on a<br><br>
number of factors; the ability of compound to penetrate into the deepest regions of the<br>
spheroid. The activation of hypoxic activated prodrug (HAP) by nitroreductases; the<br>
reactivity of the activated drug in the cell in which it was activated; and the ability of the<br>
activated drug to leave the site from where it was activated and kill nearby cells (bystander<br>
effect). The assessment of the effectiveness of a compound can therefore be evaluated on a<br>
number of different levels. The effect of the compound alone can be compared to cells in<br>
monolayer culture versus intact spheroids. The HAP can used as a monotherapy. The<br>
hypoxic fraction of the spheroid can be modulated by varying the concentration of O2 of the<br>
equilibrating gas and therefore change the ratio of the aerobic and hypoxic compartments.<br>
HAP's can be combined with other chemotherapeutic agents that either target only the outer<br>
aerobic cells or are able to target the entire spheroid. The expected cell kill can be predicted<br>
by knowing the hypoxic fraction and the expected cell kill of each of the monotherapies.<br>
[0246] In one embodiment, the present invention provides a phosphoramidate alkylator<br>
prodrug which upon activation such as bioreduction releases the phosphoramidate alkylator<br>
with ahalf life of less than 0.1 second; between 0.01 Jo 0.10 second, between 0.1 to 1.0<br>
second, between 1.0 to 10.0 seconds, and between 10.0 to 100.0 seconds.<br>
[0247] Anti cancers drugs can bind to tissue surrounding the vasculature and/or have high<br>
molecular weights that impede diffusion and not reach in therapeutically effective<br>
concentrations hypoxic tumor zones that can be up to 150 - 200 uM away from the<br>
vasculature. In one embodiment, the present invention provides phosphoramidate alkylator<br>
prodrugs that can reach hypoxic cancer cells away from the vasculature. Some methods for<br>
determining the bystander effect are described in greater detail in Examples 35 and 37. The<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator used in a hypoxia activated prodrug plays an important role to<br>
efficiently kill tumor cells. For example, for a hypoxia activated phosphorarnidate alkylator<br>
prodrug, the cytoxicity of the phosphoramidate alkylator and its rate of cellular alkylation,<br>
and the cell membrane permeability of the prodrug and the phosphoramidate alkylator impact<br>
the hypoxic selectivity and hypoxic cytotoxicity of the phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug.<br>
[02481 In one embodiment, the present invention provides phosphoramidate alkylator<br>
prodrugs that are safer than the corresponding phosphoramidate alkylators formed in vivo (at<br>
least ten and up to one million-fold safer.. In one embodiment, the increased safety results<br>
from a modification at the site of attachment of the Trigger T (activation of the<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug releases the alkylator/cytotoxic agent). In either event,<br>
the phosphoramidate alkylator prodrugs are converted into the corresponding alkylator in<br><br>
hypoxic tissues by virtue of the activation or reduction of the bioreductive group (Z3),<br>
resulting in its removal and the concomitant or subsequent release or generation of the<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator.<br>
[0249] In one embodiment, the Trigger T is covaleotly bonded to the phosphoramidate<br>
alkylator, in a manner that masks or reduces the cytotoxic activity of the phosphoramidate<br>
alkylator. This masking effect can vary and can depend on the cytotoxic activity of the<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator. Typically, the phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug will show at<br>
least about 10 fold less cytotoxic activity than the corresponding phosphoramidate alkylator,<br>
and can show up to about a million fold or less cytotoxic activity. In one version, the<br>
cytotoxic activity of the phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug is about 100 fold to about 10,000<br>
fold less than the cytotoxic activity of the corresponding phosphoramidate alkylator. As one<br>
example, for a phosphoramidate alkylator with an IC50, IC90, or LC50 of 1 nM, the IC50, IC90,<br>
or LC50 of the corresponding phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug can be 1 uM or greater.<br>
[0250] In one version, compounds provided herein include as phosphoramidate alkylator<br>
prodrug, any phosphoramidate alkylator that can be linked to a Trigger T in a manner that<br>
yields a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug that is at least about 10-fold to about 1,000,000-<br>
fold, and typically about 100 to about 10,000-fold, less active as a cytotoxic agent than the<br>
corresponding phosphoramidate alkylator or modified phosphoramidate alkylator that is<br>
released from the compounds under hypoxic conditions.<br>
[0251] To determine if a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug is selectively active under<br>
anoxic or hypoxic conditions, cells are exposed to the drug either with air (normoxic) or<br>
without oxygen (anoxia) or with very little oxygen (hypoxia). One of skill in the art will<br>
recognize that cytotoxicity of a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug as measured in an anti-<br>
piouferation assay is expressed by the IC50; and Hie cytotoxicity of a phosphoramidate<br>
alkylator prodrug as measured in a clonogenic survival experiment is expressed as IC10 or<br>
LCio, IC90 or LC90, or IC99 or LC99. The ratio of cytotoxicity as measured for example by<br>
IC50, IC90, LC50, LCoo, or LC99 determined in normoxia and hypoxia is called hypoxia<br>
cytotoxicity ratio (HCR) and can be a measure of the hypoxia selective cytotoxicity of the<br>
prodrugs of the present invention. The larger the HCR of the phosphoramidate alkylator<br>
prodrug the higher is its hypoxic cell selective toxicity and greater the hypoxic tumor killing<br>
ability of the prodrug relative to healthy normoxic cells. The HCR determined based on IC99<br>
or LC99 is larger than; that determined based on IC90 or LC90.<br><br>
[0252] In a related embodiment, the phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug of the present<br>
invention has a hypoxic cytotoxicity of 0.1 nM to 50 uM and a HCR of 10 to 100,000. In a<br>
related embodiment, the phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug of the present invention has a<br>
hypoxic cytotoxicity of 0.1 nM to 50 uM and a HCR of 25 to 100,000 (see EXAMPLE<br>
section). In another related embodiment, the phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug of the<br>
present invention has a hypoxic cytotoxicity of 0.1 nM to 5 uM and a HCR of 50 to 10,000<br>
such as, for example, the compounds as described in Examples 29,30 and 31.<br>
[0253] In one embodiment, the present invention provides a phosphoramidate alkylator<br>
prodrug having hypoxic toxicity which is 5 to 1,000,000 folds more man the corresponding<br>
normoxic toxicity. In another embodiment, me present invention provides a<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug having hypoxic toxicity which is 10 to 10,000 folds more<br>
than the corresponding normoxic toxicity. In another embodiment, the present invention<br>
provides a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug having hypoxic toxicity which is 25 to 5,000<br>
folds more than the corresponding normoxic toxicity.<br>
[0254] Tumors have a gradient of oxygen concentration that can vary from 10%, in tissues<br>
adjacent to the vasculature, to 0.5% in tissues about 150 uM away, and lower in tissues<br>
further away from the vasculature and near the necrotic core. In one embodiment, the present<br>
invention provides phosphoramidate alkylator prodrugs that can generate phosphoramidate<br>
alkylators, 5-1,000,00; 10-10,00; and 25-5,000 folds more toxic than the corresponding<br>
prodrug, under a variety of oxygen concentrations. In one embodiment, the present invention<br>
provides phosphoramidate alkylator prodrugs generate phosphoramidate alkylators, 5-<br>
1,000,00; 10-10,00; and 25-5,000 folds more toxic than the corresponding prodrug, under<br>
about 0.5-0.6% oxygen concentrations.<br>
[025S] The logP of a phopsphramidate alkylator prodrug of the present invention can<br>
measure the lipophilicity or the hydrophilicity of the prodrug. In one embodiment, the<br>
present invention provides a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug having a logP less than 0.<br>
Such phosphoramidate alkylator prodrugs can be hydrophilic, such as a prodrug having<br>
formula XV wherein each Ru is H and can be easily formulated as an aqueous formulation<br>
for i.v. or i.p. injection. Another example of such prodrugs are compounds 24,25 and 36.<br>
[0256] In one embodiment, the present invention provides a phosphoramidate alkylator<br>
prodrug having a logP greater than 0. In one embodiment, the present invention provides a<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug having a logP between 0 and 4 such as those exemplified<br><br>
by formulas XIV; XX and XV wherein each Rn is methyl or, cyclopropyl, and administered<br>
in a patient can pass the cell membrane to penetrate inside cancer cells. Another example a<br>
prodrug having a logP between 0 and is 5,6,7, or 16. (for measured logP of phopsphramidate<br>
alkylator prodrugs of the present invention see EXAMPLES section).<br>
lib. Method of synthesis<br>

Hla. Methods of Treatment<br>
[0291] In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating cancer in a<br>
patient in need of therapy thereof by administering to the patient a phosphoramidate alkylator<br>
prodrug of the present invention or one that is Known, Known phosphoramidate aikyiators<br>
are provided by the references Borch et al, supra. In one embodiment, the phosphoramidate<br>
alkylator prodrug employed in treating cancer according to the methods provided by the<br>
present invention has the formula selected from (I) - (XXVII). In one embodiment, the<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug employed in treating cancer according to the methods<br>
provided by the present invention is selected from the compounds exemplified in the<br>
EXAMPLE section.<br>
[0292] Cancer therapy with alkylating agents can lead to development of cancers that are<br>
resistant to these alkylating agents. Alkylating agents can kill cancer cells in the more rapidly<br><br>
dividing or higher oxygen containing cancer region as compared to the cancer cells in the<br>
slower growing hypoxic cancer region. The latter cells survive the treatment by alkylators<br>
and can produce cells resistant to such alkylators. Increased activity of guanine-O6-<br>
Alkyltransferase, glutathione, glutathione transferases, the nucleotide excision repair<br>
pathway, and/or the mismatch repair proteins, and decreased permeation of actively<br>
transported drugs such as mechlorethamine and melphalan, are postulated to be responsible<br>
for cancer resistance to alkylators (for example, see, Hardman et al, pages 1393 and 1433,<br>
supra).<br>
[0293] The prodrugs of the present invention are effective in treating cancers resistant to<br>
other therapies. Slowly dividing cancer cells in the hypoxic cancer zone act as a source of<br>
resistant cancer cells and strains and are killed by the prodrugs of the present invention. In<br>
one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating a cancer resistant to<br>
treatment by one or more alkylators by administering the compounds of the present invention<br>
alone or in combination with another anticancer agent. In one embodiment, a<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug of the invention is administered in combination with a<br>
drug having substantially no nephrotoxicity. In one embodiment the phosphoramidate<br>
alkylators prodrug is administered with carboplatin.<br>
[0294] In one embodiment, the present invention provides phosphoramidate alkylators<br>
prodrugs which are not cross-resistant with known alkylators. In another embodiment,<br>
present invention provides phosphoramidate alkylators prodrugs which are not cross-resistant<br>
with the alkylators cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, glufosfamide, mechlorethamine,<br>
melphalan, chlorambucil, dacarbazine, temozolomide, carmustine, streptozocin, bendamustin,<br>
busulfan, thiotepa, cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin.<br>
[0295] In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating cancer by<br>
administering as a first line therapy the compounds of the present invention alone or in<br>
combination with other anti-cancer agents. In another embodiment, the present invention<br>
provides a method of treating a metastatic cancer by administering as a first line therapy the<br>
compounds of the present invention alone or in combination with other anti-cancer agents. In<br>
one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating cancer by administering<br>
as a second line therapy the compounds of the present invention alone or in combination with<br>
other anti-cancer agents. In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of<br>
treating cancer by administering as a third line therapy the compounds of the present<br><br>
invention alone or in combination with other anti-cancer agents. In one embodiment, the<br>
present invention provides a method of treating cancer by administering after a prior<br>
treatment with surgery and/or radiation therapy the compounds of the present invention alone<br>
or in combination with other anti-cancer agents. In one embodiment, the present invention<br>
provides a method of treating cancer, the cancer having relapsed after prior chemotherapy,<br>
sugery, radiation or any combination of them, by administering the compounds of the present<br>
invention alone or in combination with other anti-cancer agents.<br>
[0296] In methods for treating cancer provided by the present invention, an effective<br>
amount of phosphoramidate alkylator prodrugs is administered to the subject. Generally, the<br>
subject can be any human or non-human mammal. The preferred subject is a human subject.<br>
Other particular subjects include but are not limited to non-human primates, dogs, cats, farm<br>
animals and horses, hi one version, the phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug is administered<br>
alone. In one version the phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug is administered in combination<br>
with one or more additional anti-cancer agents. In one version the phosphoramidate alkylator<br>
prodrug is administered in conjunction with a therapeutic cancer treatment, including but not •<br>
limited to surgery and radiation. The phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug will typically be<br>
administered in a pharmaceutical composition. Various pharmaceutical compositions that<br>
can be used are described in the Formulations section infra.<br>
[0297] The phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug and their pharmaceutical compositions can<br>
be used to treat any type of cancer in a subject, particularly in a human subject. Cancers that<br>
can be treated include but are not limited to leukemia, breast cancer, skin cancer, bone<br>
cancer, liver cancer, brain cancer, cancer of the larynx, gallbladder, pancreas, rectum,<br>
parathyroid, thyroid, adrenal, neural tissue, head and neck, stomach, bronchi, kidneys, basal<br>
COll CarCillOina, squamous cell carcinoma of both ulcerating and papillary type, metastatic<br>
skin carcinoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, veticulum cell sarcoma, myeloma, giant cell<br>
tumor, small-C6ll lung tumor, gallstones, islet cell tumor, primary brain tumor, acute and<br>
chronic lymphocytic and granulocytic tumors, hairy-C6ll tumor, adenoma, hyperplasia,<br>
medullary carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, mucosal neuronals, intestinal ganglioneuromas,<br>

hypercalcemia, renal cell tumor, polycythermia vera, adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma<br>
multiforma, leukemias, lymphomas, malignant melanomas, and epidermoid carcinomas.<br>
[0298] The phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug can particularly be used in the treatment of<br>
cancers containing significant areas of hypoxic tissue. Such cancers include but are not<br>
limited to lung cancer, especially non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer,<br>
head and neck cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, and prostate cancer. Examples of<br>
types of cancers that can be treated with the phosphoramidate alkylator prodrugs of the<br>
invention are provided in the following references, each of which is incorporated in its<br>
entirety herin by reference Tidmarsh et ah, PCT Pat. Appl. No. PCT/US2005/047314 filed on<br>
22 December 2005, and PCT Pat. Appl. entitled "Glufosfamide combination therapy",<br>
Attorney Docket No. 021305-005900PC; and US Pat App. No. 60/760,599 and 60/719,787<br>
and PCT Pat. Pub. No. WO 2005/076888. Several of these cancers are discussed for<br>
illustrative purposes below. Those of skill in the art will appreciate that cancer chemotherapy<br>
often involves the simultaneous or successive administration of a variety of anti-cancer<br>
agents, and as discussed further below, a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug can bemsed in<br>
combination therapies as provided by the methods described herein. Thus, in the description<br>
of illustrative cancers containing hypoxic regions amenable to treatment with a<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug, examples of combination therapies are also described.<br>
[0299] Lung cancer affects more than 100,000 males and 50,000 females in the United<br>
States, most of who die within 1 year of diagnosis, making it the leading cause of cancer<br>
death. Current protocols for the treatment of lung cancer involve the integration of<br>
chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy or surgery. A phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug<br>
can be used as a single agent or in combination with existing combination therapies. A<br>
variety of combination chemotherapy regimens have been reported for small cell lung cancer,<br>
including the combinations consisting of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and vincristine<br>
(CAV); etoposide and cisplatin (VP-16); and cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and VP-16<br>
(CAVP-16). Modest survival benefits from combination chemotherapy (etoposide plus<br>
cisplatin) treatment have been reported for non-small cell lung cancer.<br>
[0300] Likewise, several different cytotoxic drugs have produced at least temporary<br>
regression of ovarian cancer. The most active drugs in the treatment of ovarian cancer have<br>
been alkylating agents, including cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, melphalan, chlorambucil,<br>
tbiotepa, cisplatin, and carboplatin. Current combination therapies for ovarian cancer include<br><br>
cisplatin or carboplatin in combination with cyclophosphamide at 3- to 4-week intervals for<br>
six to eight cycles. The compounds and methods described herein provide prodrug forms and<br>
methods for treating ovarian cancer in which a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug as<br>
described herein is used as a single agent or in existing such combination therapy, either to<br>
replace an agent or in addition to the agent(s) currently used.<br>
[0301] Cancer of the prostate is the most common malignancy in men in the United States<br>
and is the second most common cause of cancer death in men above age 55, and this cancer<br>
has been reported to consist primarily of hypoxic tissue. Several chemotherapy protocols<br>
have been reported for use in late stage disease following relapse after hormonal treatment.<br>
Agents for the treatment of prostate cancer include the alkylators estramustine phosphate,<br>
prednimustine, and cisplatin. Combination chemotherapy is also used to treat prostate<br>
cancer, including treatment with estramustine phosphate plus prednimustine and cisplatin,<br>
and 5-fluorouracil, melphalan, and hydroxyurea. The present invention provides methods for<br>
treating prostate cancer in which a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug of the present<br>
*<br>
invention is used in such combinations, either to replace an agent or in addition to the<br>
agent(s) currently used.<br>
[0302] Cancer of the large bowel is the second most common cause of cancer death in the<br>
United States and is likewise a cancer characterized by hypoxic regions. While<br>
chemotherapy in patients with advanced colorectal cancer has proven to be of only marginal<br>
benefit, 5-fluorouracil is the most effective treatment for this disease. 5-Fluorouracil is useful<br>
alone or in combination with other drugs, but is associated with only a 15 to 20 percent<br>
likelihood of reducing measurable tumor masses by 50 percent or more. Using 5-FU in<br>
combination with the compounds and methods described herein, and the methods for treating<br>
colon cancer using a prodrug can offer significant topftlfa tofit and pvMM M<br>
meeting the unmet need for better treatment methods for this disease.<br>
[0303] In one version of the treatment methods, a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug can<br>
be used in various known approaches to cancer therapy including but not limited to "anti-<br>
body-directed enzyme prodrug therapy" (ADEPT), "virus-directed enzyme prodrug therapy<br>
(VDEPT), "gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy" (GDEPT), and "bacteria-directed enzyme<br>
prodrug therapy" (BDEPT). The general uses of a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug are not<br>
limited to the foregoing treatment methods.<br><br>
[0304] n another aspect, the present invention provides a method of treatment of non-<br>
cancer hyperproliferative diseases characterized by cellular hyperproliferation (e.g., an<br>
abnormally increased rate or amount of cellular proliferation). In one embodiment, the<br>
hyperproliferative disease treated according to the present method is selected from the group<br>
consisting of allergic angiitis and granulomatosis (Churg-Strauss disease), asbestosis, asthma,<br>
atrophic gastritis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, bullous pemphigoid, coeliac disease, chronic<br>
bronchitis and chronic obstructive airway disease, chronic sinusitis, Crohn's disease,<br>
demyelinating neuropathies, dermatomyositis, eczema including atopic dermatitis, eustachean<br>
tube diseases, giant cell arteritis, graft rejection, hypersensitivity pneumonitis,<br>
hypersensitivity vasculitis (Henoch-Schonlein purpura), irritant dermatitis, inflammatory<br>
hemolytic anemia, inflammatory neutropenia, inflammatory bowel disease, Kawasaki's<br>
disease, multiple sclerosis, myocarditis, myositis, nasal polyps, nasolacrimal duct diseases,<br>
neoplastic vasculitis, pancreatitis, pemphigus vulgaris, primary glomerulonephritis, psoriasis,<br>
periodontal disease, polycystic kidney disease, polyarteritis nodosa, polyangitis overlap<br>
syndrome, primary sclerosing cholangitis, rheumatoid arthritis, serum sickness, surgical<br>
adhesions, stenosis or restenosis, scleritis, scleroderma, strictures of bile ducts, strictures (of<br>
duodenum, small bowel, and colon), silicosis and other forms of pneumoconiosis, type I<br>
diabetes, ulcerative colitis, ulcerative proctitis, vasculitis associated with connective tissue<br>
disorders, vasculitis associated with congenital deficiencies of the complement system,<br>
vasculitis of the central nervous system, and Wegener's granulomatosis.<br>
[0305] In some embodiments of the invention, a compound of the present invention is<br>
administered to treat a hyperproliferative disease selected from the group consisting of<br>
psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, restenosis, and benign prostatic hyperplasia.<br>
In one embodiment, the hyperpriliferative disease treated is psoriasis, a disease characterized<br>
by the cellular hyperproliferation of keratinocytes which builds up on the skin to form<br>
elevated, scaly lesions. In another embodiment, the hyperproliferative disease treated is<br>
multiple sclerosis, a disease characterized by progressive demyelination in the brain. In<br>
another embodiment, the hyperproliferative diseases treated is rheumatoid arthritis, a<br>
multisystem chronic, relapsing, inflammatory disease that can lead to destruction and<br>
ankylosis of joints affected. In another embodiment, the compounds of the present invention<br>
are administered to prevent a hyperproliferative disease resulting from cellular proliferation<br>
on a prosthesis implanted in a subject by coating the prosthesis with a composition containing<br>
a compound of the present invention. In another embodiment, the hyperproliferative disease<br><br>
treated is benign prostatic hyperplasia, a disease in which prostate epithelial cells grow<br>
abnormally and thereby block urine flow.<br>
Hlb. Formulations, modes of administration, dosages<br>
[0306] A phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug will typically be formulated as<br>
pharmaceutical formulations for administration to a subject. Described in this section are<br>
modes of administration, formulations, and dosages that can be used when treating cancers<br>
using a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug described herein.<br>
[0307] Administration of a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug for the treatment of cancer<br>
can be effected by any method that enables delivery of the prodrugs to the site of action, the<br>
hypoxic region of a tumor. Many cancer drugs are administered by intravenous injection, and<br>
a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug can be formulated for such administration, including not<br>
only ready-for-injection formulations but also lyophilized or concentrated formulations that<br>
*<br>
must be rehydrated or diluted, respectively, prior to injection. In addition to these<br>
formulations, a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug can be formulated for administration by<br>
oral routes, intraduodenal routes, parenteral injection (including intravenous, subcutaneous,<br>
intramuscular, intravascular or infusion), topical, and rectal routes. Those of skill in the art<br>
will recognize that a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug may be activated by bacteria in the<br>
gut. If such activation is not desired, then the practitioner can employ a route of<br>
administration or a formulation that results in absorption of a phosphoramidate alkylator<br>
prodrug prior to its entry into the large intestine or colon. The actual route of administration<br>
and corresponding formulation of the phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug will depend on the<br>
type of cancer being treated, the phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug selected for<br>
administration, the severity of the cancer, and the age, weight, and condition of the patient,<br>
among other factors.<br>
[0308] The amount of a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug administered, and thus the<br>
amount of the phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug contained in the dose administered and the<br>
product comprising that dose, will be dependent on the subject being treated, the severity of<br>
the cancer, localization of the cancer, the rate of administration, the disposition of the prodrug<br>
(e.g., molecular weight, solubility and hypoxic and normoxic cytotoxicity), the cytotoxic<br>
agent released by a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug, and the discretion of the prescribing<br>
physician.<br><br>
[0309] In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of cancer treatment in<br>
a patient wherein an effective dosage is typically in the range of about 0.001 to about O.lg per<br>
kg body weight, or about 0.1 to about 35 mg/kg/day in single or divided doses. For a 70 kg<br>
human, this would amount to about 0.05 to about 7 g/day, about 0.2 to about 2.5 g/day. In<br>
some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range can be more than<br>
adequate, while in other cases still larger doses can be employed without causing any harmful<br>
side effect; larger doses can also be divided into several small doses for administration<br>
throughout the day by infusion for an hour or continuously using a peripherally inserted<br>
central catheters (PICC line) and portable intravenous bag and pump.<br>
[0310] In one embodiment, the effective dose of a compound of the present invention for<br>
treatement of cancer and other hyperproliferative diseases is in the range of about 0.1 to about<br>
35 mg/kg/day, about 0.5 to about 20 mg/kg/day, about 0.5 to about 15 mg/kg/day; about 0.5<br>
to about 10 mg/kg/day; about 0.5 to about 8 mg/kg/day; and about 1 to about 5 mg/kg/day in<br>
single or divided doses. In one embodiment, the effective dose of a compound of the present<br>
invention for treatement of cancer and other hyperproliferative diseases is in the range of<br>
about 2 to about 8 mg/kg/day; about 2 to about 4 mg/kg/day; and about 2 mg/kg/day in single<br>
or divided doses. In one embodiment, the effective dose of a compound of the present<br>
invention for treatement of cancer and other hyperproliferative diseases is in the range of<br>
about 0.25 to about 2.5 mg/kg/day; about 0.25 to about 1 mg/kg/day; and about 0.25 to about<br>
0.5 mg/kg/day in single or divided doses. In one embodiment, the dose is administered i.v.<br>
daily, either as a monotherapy (compound of the present invention alone) or in conjunction<br>
(combination) with standard of care therapies. In one embodiment, the effective dose for<br>
treatement of cancer and other hyperproliferative diseases is in the range as described earlier<br>
administered once a week.<br>
[0311] In one embodiment, a larger dose is administered intermittently (less frequently); a<br>
dose in the range of about 3 to about 20 mg/kg; about 6 to about 10 mg/kg; or 8 mg/kg is<br>
administered on once every three days for two weeks. In another embodiment, a dose in the<br>
range of about 5 to about 30 mg/kg; about 10 to about 15 mg/kg; or 12.5 mg/kg of the<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug is administered once a week for four weeks. In one<br>
embodiment, a dose in the range of about 0.5 to about 8 mg/kg/day is administered for 5 days<br>
over two weekly cycles.<br>
[0312] In another embodiment, for treatment of human patients, the maximum daily dose<br>
of a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug is not greater than 500 mg/kg patient weight and,<br><br>
accordingly, a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug is administered in a daily dose in the range<br>
of about 1 mg of a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug/kg of patient weight to about 500 mg<br>
of a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug/kg of patient weight. In one embodiment, a<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug is administered in a daily dose in the range of about 5<br>
mg/kg to about 500 mg/kg of the body weight of the patient to be treated. In another<br>
embodiment, the therapeutically effective dose is a daily dose of a phosphoramidate alkylator<br>
prodrug is about 10 mg/kg to about 250 mg/kg of the body weight of the patient to be treated.<br>
In another embodiment, the therapeutically effective dose of a phosphoramidate alkylator<br>
prodrug is about 25 mg/kg to about 150 mg/kg of the body weight of the patient to be treated.<br>
In another embodiment, the therapeutically effective dose of a phosphoramidate alkylator<br>
prodrug is about 25 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg of body weight of the patient to be treated. In<br>
another embodiment, the therapeutically effective dose of a phosphoramidate alkylator<br>
prodrug is about 1.25 mg/kg to about 12.5 mg/kg of body weight of the patient to be treated.<br>
[0313] Guidance concerning administration can also be provided by and from studies in<br>
humans and other mammalian animals. A therapeutically effective dose determined for an<br>
animal can be converted to the corresponding human equivalent dose (HED) as described in<br>
the table below:<br><br>
b For example, cynomolgus, rhesus, or stumptail.<br><br>
[0314] To achieve therapeutic effectiveness, the therapeutically effective daily dose of a<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug is usually administered multiple times to the patient. In<br>
one embodiment, a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug is administered daily for a period of<br>
time. Typically, daily administration for at least 3 consecutive days will be employed. In<br>
related embodiments, administration is for at least 5 consecutive days, at least 7 consecutive<br>
days, or at least 10 consecutive days. Depending on the dose, formulation, and route of<br>
adiainistration selected by the practitioner and the convenience of the patient, the entire daily<br>
dose can be administered once daily, or the daily dose can be administered in multiple<br>
smaller doses through the course of a day (including by infusion with a pump or intravenous<br>
administration). For example, the dose can be divided into two smaller doses and<br>
administered twice daily, or divided into three smaller doses and administered thrice daily. It<br>
will be apparent to one of skill in the art of cancer treatment that, as used herein, "daily"<br>
administration is not limited to one administration per day but can include multiple<br>
administrations.<br>
[0315J Adniinistration schedules other than consecutive daily administration can also be<br>
used. Administration once every other day (qod) is particularly convenient, and<br>
administration once every third day, or once a week can be appropiate in some instances, but<br>
in any event, a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug is repeatedly administered over a period of<br>
time. For example, whether administration is daily (including, as noted, a divided daily<br>
dose), every other day, or less frequently, in one embodiment a phosphoramidate alkylator<br>
prodrug is administered at least 2 days per week for at least two, three, four, five or at least<br>
six consecutive weeks, or, alternatively, for at least two, three, four, five or at least six weeks<br>
within a six-month period, or, alternatively, for at least two, three, four, five or at least six<br>
weeks within a twelve-month period. In one embodiment, a phosphoramidate alkylator<br>
prodrug is administered at least 3 days per week for at least two, three, four, five or at least<br>
six consecutive weeks, or, alternatively, for at least two, three, four, five or at least six weeks<br>
within a six-month period, or, alternatively, for at least two, three, four, five or at least six<br>
weeks within a twelve-month period. In one embodiment a phosphoramidate alkylator<br>
prodrug is administered at least 10 days per month,- optionally at least 20 days per month, for<br>
at least one month or at least two, three, four, five or at least six consecutive months, or,<br>
alternatively, at least one, two, three, four, five or at least six months in a 6-month period.<br>
[0316] In one embodiment, the administration of the therapeutically effective dose is<br>
continued for multiple days, typically for at least three consecutive days, and often for at least<br><br>
five to ten consecutive days, or for a week, or for several weeks or more. Thus, a patient can<br>
be administered a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug in accordance with the present methods<br>
for several days, a week, a month, two months, three months, six months, or a year or longer.<br>
[0317] Consistent with administration regimens of other anticancer agents, a<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug can be administered in multiple "rounds" of<br>
administration. For example, in some embodiments, a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug<br>
can be administered once daily for at least three to ten, or at least five to ten consecutive days,<br>
and such three to ten or five to ten day treatments can be repeated once, twice, or three or<br>
more times, sometimes with a no-treatment (with a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug)<br>
period ranging from one to several weeks between each multiple-day treatment Similarly, in<br>
some embodiments, a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug is adrninistered every other day for<br>
two to ten administrations, more often three to ten administrations, or five to ten<br>
administrations, and such two, three or five to ten administrations qod can be repeated once,<br>
twice, or three or more times with a no-treatment (with a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug)<br>
period ranging from one to several weeks between each* multiple-day treatment. Other<br>
multiple-round schedules for administration will be apparent to the skilled practicioner<br>
quided by this disclosure.<br>
[0318] In one aspect, "administering a therapeutically effective dose or regimen of a<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug" refers to (i) administering a phosphoramidate alkylator<br>
prodrug in the ranges stated (e.g., 1 mg to 1 g of a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug per kg<br>
of patient weight, typically 25 to 150 mg of a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug per kg of<br>
patient weight) for a specified minimum number of days within a specified time period,<br>
wherein the administration of a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug has a therapeutic effect on<br>
the cancer in the patient. Illustrative therapeutically effective dose regimens for a<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug include those described herein, such as administration of<br>
a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug for 3 consecutive days, 5 consecutive days, 7<br>
consecutive days, 10 consecutive days, at least 3 days per week, at least 3 days per week for<br>
one month, at least 10 days per month, and at least 20 days per month.<br>
[0319] In optimizing a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug treatment regimen according to<br>
the present invention, the dose and frequency of a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug<br>
administration can be selected to achieve a maximal sustained area under the plasma<br>
concentration curve (AUC) over the course of treatment. The theoretically optimal dosing<br><br>
regimen will result in a maximal exposure of the tumor cells to a phosphoramidate alkylator<br>
prodrug, as measured by AUC, while minimizing the maximal plasma concentration (Cmax)<br>
for any single administration. A higher Cmax will contribute to toxicity while the AUC will<br>
determine efficacy. As is understood in the art for other cancer therapeutic drugs, treatment<br>
with a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug can be suspended temporarily if toxicity is<br>
observed, or for the convenience of the patient, without departing from the scope of the<br>
invention, and then resumed.<br>
[0320] In one embodiment, the pharmacokinetics of the phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug<br>
of the present invention employed for the treatment of cancer can determine the dose, the<br>
method of administration, and the kind of cancer that is treated with the phosphoramidate<br>
alkylator prodrug. In one embodiment, the phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug of the present<br>
invention can have a in vivo half life of between 1 to 300 minutes. In one embodiment, the<br>
compounds of the present invention can have a in vivo half life of between 3 to 10 minutes.<br>
In one embodiment, the compounds of the present invention can have a in vivo half life of<br>
between 10 to 30 minutes. A short half life of the phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug can<br>
require an infusion time in treatment that is longer than that required for a phosphoramidate<br>
alkylator prodrug having a longer half life. A short half life of the phosphoramidate alkylator<br>
prodrug can increase the maximum tolerated dose (MID) for that prodrug.<br>
[0321] In another embodiment, the present invention provides phosphoramidate alkylator<br>
prodrugs that remain up to 20% unchanged when incubated with mouse liver microsomal<br>
(update with human example and data if available) protein for 30 minutes. In another<br>
embodiment, the present invention provides phosphoramidate alkylator prodrugs that remain<br>
20-80% unchanged when incubated with mouse liver microsomal protein for 30 minutes. In<br>
another embodiment, the present invention provides phosphoramidate alkylator prodrugs that<br>
remain greater than 80% unchanged when incubated with mouse liver microsomal protein for<br>
30 minutes. In another embodiment, examples of phosphoramidate alkylator prodrugs of the<br>
present invention which when incubated with mouse liver microsomal protein for 30 minutes<br>
remain greater than 80% unchanged include 1,25, and 36. The higher the MLM stability of a<br>
prodrug of the invention, its therapeutically effective dose and undesirable patient side effects<br>
will be lower.<br>
[0322] In a related embodiment, the bioreductive group of the phosphoramidate alkylator<br>
prodrugs of the present invention upon reduction/activation in a hypoxic tumor zone form a<br><br>
phosphoramidate alkylator- TM conjugate. The phosphoramidate alkylator- TM conjugate can<br>
diffuse and reach other parts of the tumor or other tumors in the case of a metastatic disease.<br>
Various pharmacokinetic parameters such as volume of distribution under steady state (Vss),<br>
clearance (CL), area under curve (AUC), mouse liver microsomal stability (MLM stability),<br>
plasma stability, and Cmax of phosphoramidate alkylator prodrugs of the present invention<br>
were measured and listed in the EXAMPLES section (see also Hardman et al., supra).<br>
[0323] In re-treatment regimens, the dose can be adjusted to reflect patient tolerance of the<br>
prior treatment. In any event, as toxicity is observed during repeat administration, dosing can<br>
be temporarily stopped as severe symptoms are observed. The period of temporary halting of<br>
administration (drug holiday) can be ended at the time when the first organ of toxicity no<br>
longer contains significant concentrations of a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug or a<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator released therefrom (which can be measured or determined<br>
indirectly by cessation of symptoms). Therefore, an intermittent dosing period can be<br>
defined not only by specific days but individualized by drug holidays that are based on<br>
symptoms and normal organ clearance of a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug or a<br>
phosphoramidate alkylators released therefrom.<br>
[0324] A formulation of a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug can, for example, be in a<br>
form suitable for oral administration as a tablet, capsule, pill powder, sustained release<br>
formulation, solution, and suspension; for parenteral injection as a sterile solution, suspension<br>
or emulsion; for topical administration as an ointment or cream; and for rectal administration<br>
as a suppository. A formulation of a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug can be in unit<br>
dosage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages and will typically include a<br>
conventional pharmaceutical carrier or excipient.<br>
[0325] Suitable pnarmaceutlcal carriers include inert diluents or fillers, water and various<br>
organic solvents. The pharmaceutical compositions can, if desired, contain additional<br>
ingredients such as flavorings, binders, excipients, and the like. Thus for oral administration,<br>
tablets containing various excipients, such as citric acid can be employed together with<br>
various disintegrants, such as starch, alginic acid, and certain complex silicates, and with<br>
binding agents such as sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as<br>
magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate, and talc can be used to prepare the tablet forms of<br>
formulations of a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug described herein. Solid compositions of<br>
a similar type can be employed in soft and hard filled gelatin capsules. Preferred materials,<br><br>
therefore, include lactose or milk sugar and high molecular weight polyethylene glycols.<br>
When aqueous suspensions or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the prodrug therein<br>
can be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matters or dyes and, if<br>
desired, emulsifying agents or suspending agents, together with diluents such as water,<br>
ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin, or combinations thereof.<br>
[0326] Exemplary parenteral administration forms include solutions or suspensions of a<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug in sterile aqueous solutions, for example, aqueous<br>
polyethylene glycols, propylene glycol or dextrose solutions. Such dosage forms can be<br>
suitably buffered, if desired.<br>
[03271 Methods of preparing various pharmaceutical compositions with a specific amount<br>
of active drug are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art in view of this<br>
disclosure. For examples, see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing<br>
Company, Philadelphia, Pa., 17th Edition (1984).<br>
[0328] The methods of cancer treatment employing a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug of<br>
the present invention are effective in killing the most difficult to kill cancer cells growing in<br>
the hypoxic region of a tumor. Once released in the hypoxic region a phosphoramidate<br>
prodrug can diffuse from the hypoxic cells and kill the cancer cells in adjacent regions<br>
containing increasing populations of rapidly dividing cells. The hypoxic region acts as a<br>
drug-factory to produce within a tumor an alkylator for killing adjacent normoxic cancer cells<br>
leading to a higher concentration of the phosphoramidate alkylator within the tumor, relative<br>
to normal tissues. The use of the prodrug to generate the phosphoramidate alkylator within<br>
the tumor can reduce toxic side-effects arising due to normal cell toxicity. After cancer cell<br>
in the normoxic region of the tumor are destroyed, a hypoxic region can become normoxic<br>
and start to divide. At this point, such cells can be killed by the phosphoramidate alkylators<br>
generated from a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug of this invention or those known, or by<br>
other anticancer agents or cytoxins administered in combination with the phosphoramidate<br>
alkylator prodrug, as described in the following section.<br>
IHc. Combination therapies<br>
[0329] In accordance with the methods of the invention, a phosphoramidate alkylator<br>
prodrug can be co-administered in combination with other anti-cancer agents ("anticancer<br><br>
agent"). Without intending to be bound by any particular mechanism or effect, such co-<br>
administration can in some cases provide one or more of several advantages over known<br>
cancer therapies, such as, for example co-administration of a phosphoramidate alkylator<br>
prodrug and the anticancer agent has a synergistic effect on induction of cancer cell death.<br>
Co-administration provides a better therapeutic result than administration of the anticancer<br>
agent alone, e.g., greater alleviation or amelioration of one or more symptoms of the cancer,<br>
dinxinishment of extent of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration,<br>
palliation or stabilization of the disease state, partial or complete remission, prolonged<br>
survival or other beneficial therapeutic results.<br>
[0330] The co-administration of a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug increases the<br>
sensitivity of cancer cells to the anticancer agent, allowing lower doses of the anticancer<br>
agent to be adrninstered to the patient or allowing an anticancer agent to be used for treatment<br>
of cells otherwise resistent to the anticancer agent or otherwise refractory to treatment While<br>
the known anti-cancer agents in general targets the rapidly dividing cells in the normoxic<br>
region, the phosphoramidate alkylator prodrugs of the invention target the hypoxic cells in<br>
the regions of tumors that are not efficiently killed by the anticancer agent alone.<br>
[0331] As used herein, a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug is "co-administered" with<br>
another anticancer agent (also referred to herein as, "Agent") when a phosphoramidate<br>
alkylator prodrug and Agent are administered as part of the same course of therapy. In one<br>
embodiment, a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug is first administered prior to<br>
administration of the Agent, (i.e., the initiation of the other cancer therapy), and treatment<br>
with a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug is continued throughout the course of<br>
administration of the Agent (i.e., the course of the other therapy). In another embodiment, a<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug is administered after the initiation or completion of the<br>
other cancer therapy. In other embodiments, a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug is first<br>
administered contemporaneously with the initiation of the other cancer therapy. See for<br>
example combination therapies as described in EXAMPLE section.<br>
[0332] In one embodiment, a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug is first administered prior<br>
to administration of the Agent, and treatment with a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug is<br>
continued after the cessation of administration of the Agent. In one embodiment, a<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug is first administered prior to administration of the Agent,<br>
and treatment with a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug is continued during part of the<br><br>
period of administration of the Agent. For certain drugs, such as certain topoisomerase<br>
inhibitors, a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug administration can be initiated and<br>
completed prior to the administration of the second drug.<br>
(0333] In the presence of oxygen, the radical anion formed upon the reduction of Z3 reacts<br>
with oxygen to yield superoxide and Z3. Superoxide is a cytotoxin and the production of<br>
superoxide in normoxic tissues can lead to unwanted side effects. In one embodiment, the<br>
present invention provides a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug administered in combination<br>
with a chemoprotective agent or a chemoprotectant Chemoprotective agents protect healthy<br>
tissue from the toxic effects of anticancer drugs. In one embodiment, the chemoprotective<br>
agent is a thiol or a disulfide. In one embodiment, the chemoprotectant can reduce<br>
superoxide, m another embodiment, the the chemoprotectant can react with the "Michael-<br>
receptor" generated from a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug and prevent "Michael-<br>
receptor" from reacting with proteins and nucleic acid (see below).<br>
« <br>
[0334] Anticancer drug therapy today typically involves multiple rounds, or "cycles," of<br>
administration of the anti-cancer agent(s). In the context of administering a phosphoramidate<br>
alkylator prodrug, each cycle of administration (as well as a complete set of cycles) can be<br>
viewed as administration of a second drug. A phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug can be<br>
administered in any or all of the multiple cycles of treatment with the other Agent; in general,<br>
a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug is administered on a daily basis for at least two or more<br>
days during each cycle. In one aspect of the invention, a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug<br>
is co-administered with the Agent according to a schedule repeated at each round.<br>
[0335] In one version of the method of treating cancer using the a phosphoramidate<br>
alkylator prodrug, a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug is administered in combination with<br>
an effective amount of one or more chemotherapeutic agents, an effective amount of<br>
radiotherapy, an appropriate surgery procedure, or any combination of such additional<br>
therapies.<br><br>
[0336] When a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug is used in combination with one or more<br>
of the additional therapies, a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug and additional therapy can<br>
be administered at the same time or can be administered separately. For example, if a<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug is administered with an additional chemotherapeutic<br>
agent, the two agents can be administered simultaneously or can be administered sequentially<br>
with some time between administrations. One of skill in the art will understand methods of<br>
administering the agents simultaneously and sequentially and possible time periods between<br>
administration. See for example combination therapies as described in the EXAMPLE<br>
section.<br>
[0337] The Agents can be administered as the same or different formulations and can be<br>
administered via the same or different routes.<br>

used include platinum derivatives, including but not limited to cis platinum, carboplatin, and<br>
oxoplatin.<br>
[0339] In one version, a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug described herein can be used in<br>
combination with an antiangeogenisis inhibitor including but not limited to Avastin and<br>
similar therapeutics. In one version of the combination treatment methods, a subject is<br>
treated with an antiangeogenisis inhibitor and subsequently treated with a phosphoramidate<br>
alkylator prodrug. In one version of the combination treatment methods, a subject is treated<br>
with an antiangeogenisis inhibitor and subsequently treated with a phosphoramidate alkylator<br>
prodrug with another chemotherapeutic agent, including but not limited to Cisplatin, and<br>
carboplatin. In one version of these combination methods of treatment using an<br>
antiangeogenisis inhibitor, the method is used to treat breast cancer.<br>
[0340J In another embodiment, a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug is administered with<br>
an anti-cancer agent that acts, either directly or indirectly, to inhibit the epidermal growth<br>
factor or EGFR receptor. EGFR inhibitors suitable for coadministration with a<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug of the invention include gefitinib and erlotonib.<br>
[0341] In another version, a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug is administered with an<br>
anti-cancer agent that acts, either directly or indirectly, to inhibit hypoxia-inducible factor 1<br>
alpha (HIF1 a) or to inhibit a protein or enzyme, such as a glucose transporter or VEGF,<br>
whose expression or activity is increased upon increased HIFla levels. HIFla inhibitors<br>
suitable for use in this version of the methods and compositions described herein include PI 3<br>
kinase inhibitors; LY294002; rapamycin; histone deacetylase inhibitors such as [(E)-<br>
(lS,4S)10S,21R)-7-[(Z)-ethylidene]-4,21-diisopropyl-2-oxa-12,13-dithia-5,8,20,23-<br>
tetraazabicyclo-[8,7,6]-tricos-16-ene-3,6s9,19,22-pentanone (FR901228, depsipeptide); heat<br>
shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitors such as geldanamycin, 17-aIlylarnino-geldanamycin (17-<br>
AAG), and other geldanamycin analogs, and radicicol and radicicol derivatives such as<br>
KF58333; genistein; indanone; staurosporin; protein kinase-1 (MEK-1) inhibitors such as<br>
PD98059 (2*-ammo-3'-methoxyflavone); PX-12 (1-methylpropyl 2-imidazolyl disulfide);<br>
pleurotin PX-478; quinoxaline 1,4-dioxides; sodium butyrate (NaB); sodium nitropurruside<br>
(SNP) and other NO donors; microtubule inhibitors such as novobiocin, panzem (2-<br>
methoxyestradiol or 2-ME2), vincristines, taxanes, epothilones, discodermolide, and<br><br>
derivatives of any of the foregoing; coumarins; barbituric and thiobarbituric acid analogs;<br>
camptothecins; and YC-1, a compound described in Biochem. Pharmacol., 15 Apr 2001,<br>
67(8):947-954, incorporated herein by reference, and its derivatives.<br>
[0342] In another version, a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug is administered with an<br>
anti-angiogenic agent, including but not limited to anti-angiogenic agents selected from the<br>
group consisting of angiostatin, an agent that inhibits or otherwise antagonizes the action of<br>
VEGF, batimastat, captopril, cartilage derived inhibitor, genistein, endostatin, interleukin,<br>
lavendustin A, medroxypregesterone acetate, recombinant human platelet factor 4, Taxol,<br>
tecogalan, thalidomide, thrombospondin, TNP-470, and Avastin. Other useful angiogenesis<br>
inhibitors for purposes of the combination therapies provided by the present methods and<br>
compositions described herein include Cox-2 inhibitors like celecoxib (Celebrex), diclofenac<br>
(Voltaren), etodolac (Lodine), fenoprofen (Nalfon), indomethacin (Indocin), ketoprofen<br>
(Orudis, Oruvail), ketoralac (Toradol), oxaprozin (Daypro), nabumetone (Relafen), sulindac<br>
(Clinoril), tolmetin (Tolectin), rofecoxib (Vioxx), ibuprofen (Advil), naproxen (Aleve,<br>
Naprosyn), aspirin, and acetaminophen (Tylenol).<br>
[0343] In addition, because pyruvic acid plays an important role in angiogenesis, pyruvate<br>
mimics and glycolytic inhibitors like halopyruvates, including bromopyruvate, can be used in<br>
combination with an anti-angiogemc compound and a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug to<br>
treat cancer. In another version, a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug is administered with an<br>
anti-angiogenic agent and another anti-cancer agent, including but not limited to a cytotoxic<br>
agent selected from the group consisting of alkylators, Cisplatin, Carboplatin, and inhibitors<br>
of microtubule assembly, to treat cancer.<br>
[0344] In addition to the combination of a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug with the<br>
Agents described above, the present methods and compositions described herein provides a<br>
variety of synergistic combinations of a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug and other anti-<br>
cancer drugs. Those of skill in the art can readily determine the anti-cancer drugs that act<br>
"synergistically" with a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug as described herein. For<br>
example, the reference Vendetti, "Relevance of Transplantable Animal-Tumor Systems to the<br>
Selection of New Agents for Clinical Trial," Pharmacological Basis of Cancer<br>
Chemotherapy, Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, 1975, and Simpson Herren et al., 1985,<br>
"Evaluation of In Vivo Tumor Models for Predicting Clinical Activity for Anticancer Drugs,"<br><br>
Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 26: 330, each of which is incorporated herein by reference,<br>
describe methods to aid in the determination of whether two drugs act synergjstically.<br>
[0345] While synergy is not required for therapeutic benefit in accordance with the<br>
methods of described herein, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of<br>
cancer treatment, wherein there is synergy between a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug and<br>
another anticancer agent. Two drugs can be said to possess therapeutic synergy if a<br>
combination dose regimen of the two drugs produces a significantly better tumor cell kill than<br>
the sum of the single Agents at optimal or maximum tolerated doses. The "degree of<br>
synergy" can be defined as net log of tumor cell kill by the optimum combination regimen<br>
minus net log of tumor cell kill by the optimal dose of the most active single Agent.<br>
Differences in cell kill of greater than ten-fold (one log) are considered conclusively<br>
indicative of therapeutic synergy.<br>
[0346] When a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug is used with another anti-cancer agent, a<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug will, at least in some embodiments, be administered prior<br>
to the initiation of therapy with the other drug or drugs and administration will typically be<br>
continued throughout the course of treatment with the other drug or drugs. In some<br>
embodiments, the drug co-administered with a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug will be<br>
delivered at a lower dose, and optionally for longer periods, than would be the case in the<br>
absence of a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug administration. Such "low dose" therapies<br>
can involve, for example, administering an anti-cancer drug, including but not limited to<br>
paclitaxel, docetaxel, doxorubicin, cisplatin, or carboplatin, at a lower than approved dose<br>
and for a longer period of time together with a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug<br>
administered in accordance with the methods described herein.<br>
[0347] These methods can be used to improve patient outcomes over currently practiced<br>
therapies by more effectively killing cancer cells or stopping growth of cancer cell as well as<br>
diminishing unwanted side effects of the other therapy. When employed in combination with<br>
a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug, the additional anti-cancer agent(s) is dosed using either<br>
the standard dosages employed for those Agents (i.e., when used without a phosphoramidate<br>
alkylator prodrug) or are less than those standard dosages.<br>
{0348] The administration of a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug in accordance with the<br>
methods described herein can therefore allow the physician to treat cancer with existing (or<br>
later approved) drugs at lower doses (than currently used), thus ameliorating some or all of<br><br>
the toxic side effects of such drugs. The exact dosage for a given patient varies from patient<br>
to patient, depending on a number of factors including the drug combination employed, the<br>
particular disease being treated, and the condition and prior history of the patient, but can be<br>
determined using only the skill of the ordinarily skilled artisan in view of the teachings<br>
herein.<br>
[0349] Specific dose regimens for known and approved chemotherapeutic agents or<br>
antineoplastic agents (i.e., the recommended effective dose) are known to physicians and are<br>
given, for example, in the product descriptions found in the Physician's Desk Reference 2003,<br>
(Physicians' Desk Reference, 57th Ed) Medical Economics Company, Inc., Oradell, NJ<br>
and/or are available from the Federal Drug Administration. Illustrative dosage regimens for<br>
certain anti-cancer drugs are also provided below.<br>
[0350] Cancer drugs can be classified generally as alkylators, anthracyclines, antibiotics,<br>
aromatase inhibitors, bisphosphonates, cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, estrogen receptor<br>
modulators, folate antagonists, inorganic aresenates, microtubule inhibitors, modifiers,<br>
nitrosoureas, nucleoside analogs, osteoclast inhibitors, platinum containing compounds,<br>
retinoids, topoisomerase 1 inhibitors, topoisomerase 2 inhibitors, and tyrosine kinase<br>
inhibitors. In accordance with the methods described herein, a phosphorarnidate alkylator<br>
prodrug can be co-administered with any anti-cancer drug from any of these classes or can be<br>
administered prior to or after treatment with any such drug or combination of such drugs. In<br>
addition, a phosphorarnidate alkylator prodrug can be administered in combination with a<br>
biologic therapy (e.g., treatment with interferons, interleukins, colony stimulating factors and<br>
monoclonal antibodies). Biologies used for treatment of cancer are known in the art and<br>
include, for example, trastuzumab (Herceptin), tosirumomab and 131I Tositumomab (Bexxar),<br>
rituximab (Rituxan).<br>
[0351] Alkylators useful in the practice of the methods described herein include but are not<br>
limited to busulfan (Myleran, Busulfex), chlorambucil (Leukeran), ifosfamide (with or<br>
without MESNA), cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan, Neosar), ghrfosfarnide, melphalan, L-PAM<br>
(Alkeran), dacarbazine (DTIC-Dome), and temozolamide (Temodar). In accordance with the<br>
methods described herein a phosphorarnidate alkylator prodrug is co-administered with an<br>
alkylator to treat cancer. In one version, the cancer is chronic myelogenous leukemia,<br>
multiple myeloma, or anaplastic astrocytoma.<br><br>
[0352] In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating cancer<br>
treatable by administering an alkylator by administering the phosphoramidate alkylator<br>
prodrugs of the present invention or those alone or in combination with at least another<br>
alkylator or a prodrug thereof. Alkylators, such as, for example, cyclophosphamide,<br>
ifosfamide, glufosfamide, mechlorethamine, melphalan, chlorambucil, dacarbazine,<br>
temozolomide, carmustine, streptozocin, bendamustin, busulfan, thiotepa, cisplatin,<br>
carboplatin, and oxaliplatin, and types of cancers treated using any one of such alkylators<br>
alone or in combination with other anti cancer or chemoprotective agents are described for<br>
example in the reference Hardman et ah, (supra).<br>
[0353] In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating cancer by<br>
coadministeTing a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug with at least the alkylator<br>
Cyclophosphamide, in the treatment of Stages III and IV malignant lymphomas, multiple<br>
myeloma, leukemia, mycosis fungoides, neuroblastoma, ovarian adenocarcinoma,<br>
retinoblastoma, and carcinoma of the breast. Cyclophosphamide is administered for<br>
induction therapy in doses of 1500-1800 mg/m2 that are administered intravenously in<br>
divided doses over a period of three to five days; for maintenance therapy, 350-550 mg/m2<br>
are administered every 7-10 days, or 110-185 mg/m2 are administered intravenously twice<br>
weekly. In accordance with the methods described herein, a phosphoramidate alkylator<br>
prodrug is co-administered with cyclosphosphamide administered at such doses or at lower<br>
doses and/or for a longer duration than normal for administration of Cyclosphosphamide<br>
alone.<br>
[0354] In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating cancer by<br>
administering a phosphoramidate alkylator produg of the invention together with a cancer<br>
tre&amp;toeut regimen using at least the alkylator Mechlorethamine. For example,<br>
Mechlorethamine is used in the combination chemotherapy regimen MOPP<br>
(mecMorethamine, Oncovin (vincristine), procarbazine, and prednisone) in patients with<br>
Hodgkin's disease and administered by intravenous bolus actministration is doses 6mg/m on<br>
days 1 and 8 of the 28 day cycles of each course of treatment.<br>
[0355] In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating cancer by<br>
administering a phosphoramidate alkylator produg of the invention with a cancer treatment<br>
regimen using at least the alkylator Ifosfamide. Ifosfamide is used to treat pediatric and adult<br>
sarcomas, carcinomas of cervix and lung, and in combination with other drugs for germ cell<br><br>
testicular cancer. Ifosfamide is used as part of the ICE (Ifosfamide, Carboplatin, and<br>
Etoposide) ans RICE (Rituxan and ICE) regimens for treating lymphomas (see Hardman et<br>
ah, supra).<br>
[0356] In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating cancer by<br>
administering a phosphoramidate alkylator produg of the invention with a cancer treatment<br>
regimen using at least the alkylator Glufosfamide. Glufosfamide is in the clinic for the<br>
treatment of pancreatic cancer or Gemzar resistant pancreatic cancer. Glufosfamide can be<br>
used for treating breast cancer, Morbus Hodgkin, gastrointestinal tract cancer, or as part of<br>
the GCE (Glufosfamide, Carboplatin, and Etoposide) or RGCE (Rituxan and GCE) regimen,<br>
for treating lymphomas. (Tidmarsh et al., PCT Pat. Appl. No. PCT/US2005/047314 filed on<br>

[0357] In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating cancer by<br>
administering a phosphoramidate alkylator produg of the invention with a cancer treatment<br>
regimen using at least an alkylator selected from the group consisting of ethylenimines and<br>
methylmelamines. In another embodiment the ethyleriimine is Triethylenemelamine or<br>
Thiotepa.<br>
[0358] Thiotepa can be used to treat adenocarcinomas of the breast, ovary, and bladder,<br>
malignant lymphomas, bronchiogenic carcinomas, and Wilms' tumor. Thiotepa was used at<br>
high doses in combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide in patients with refractory<br>
malignancies treated with autologous bone transplantation and to treat a variety of cancers<br>
including bladder, ovarian, breast, lung, brain, and lymphomas (see, International Agency for<br>

Synthesis<br>
[0358] Methods to synthesize the phosphoramidate alkylator prodrugs of the present<br>
invention are provided in section lib. Starting materials used in the synthesis of the<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator prodrugs of the present invention were bought, when available,<br>
from commercial manufacturers, such as, for example, the Sigma-Aldrich Co. 1-N-Methyl-<br>
2-mtroimidazole-5-methanol was purchased from Syngene, India. Non-commercially<br>
available starting materials can be synthesized in via standard literature procedures. Such<br>
procedures can be identified via literature search tools such as SciFinder available from the<br>
American Chemical Society or Beilstein, available from MDL Software.<br>
[0359] Reactions with moisture sensitive compounds, such as, for example, POCl3 and<br>
PCI3, and their mono and dichloro derivatives were performed employing anhydrous solvents<br>
and under nitrogen or argon. Separation of a product from the reaction mixture was<br>
performed employing a work-up where necessary, followed by vacuum distillation,<br>
crystallization, column chromatography, or preparative thick layer chromatography. A<br>
suitable eluent for the column chromatography of a compound can be determined by reading<br>
this disclosure and/or by determining the Rf of the compound by thin layer chromatography<br>
and choosing a solvent which allows separation of the desired compound from undesired<br>
compounds. The choice of a particular eluent can depend, among other factors, on the polar<br>
nature of the compound, existence of other closely eluting compounds, type of stationary<br>
phase such as silica gel or alumina used, and the amount of pressure used to elute the solvent<br>
through the stationary phase. In practice, different compositions of solvents can be used to<br>
separate the same compound.<br>
[0360] Separated compounds were analyzed for their purity by Standard analytical<br>
techniques, such as, TLC, NMR spectroscopy, and LC-MS, and stored in a freezer or a<br>
fridge, avoiding moisture, light, or air. Stock solutions of phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug<br>
compounds were prepared in DMSO and stored in a freezer.<br>
Example 1<br>
Synthesis of Compound 23<br><br><br>
[0361] To a solution of 5-nitrofurfuryl alcohol (200 mg, 1.4 mmol) in THF (10 ml) at -<br>
78°C POCI3 was added in one portion followed by a dropwise addition of triethylamine<br>
(TEA, 0.22 ml, 1.54 mmol). Temperature was increased to -30°C in one hour and then 2-<br>
cUoroemylarnine hydrochloride was added followed by TEA (1 ml, 7 mmol). After the<br>
temperature was raised to room temperature (rt), the reaction was continued for one more<br>
hour, the reaction mixture was quenched with water and the organic layer was separated. The<br>
aqueous layer was extracted with DCM and the combined organic solution was dried and<br>
concentrated. Compound 23 was separated by flash column chromatography and analyzed<br>
by LC/MS and NMR spectroscopy to be pure.<br><br>
[0362] A suspension of ^Memyl-2-chloroeihylammonium chloride (10 gm) in POCI3 (40<br>
ml) was refluxed (135°C) over night. After removing excess POCI3 under vacuum product 5i<br>
was distilled out under vacuum as light yellow oil and analyzed by H and P NMR<br>
spectroscopy to be pure.<br><br>
[0363] To solution of 5i (1 gm, 4.75 mmol) and AT-Methyl-2-chloroethylammonium<br>
chloride (0.62 gm, 4.75 mmol) in THF at -78°C diisopropylethylamine (DIEA, 1.65 ml, 9.5<br>
mmol) was slowly added and the reaction mixture was warmed to rt. After stirring at rt for<br>
one hour, the reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate and washed with brine. The<br>
organic layer was dried over MgSC&gt;4 and concentrated to yield a residue which was separated<br>
by flash chromatography yielding compound 5ii as oil.<br>
[0364] To a solution of //-methyl 2-nitroimidazole-5-methanol (0.5 g, 3.2 mmol) in<br>
dimethoxyethane (DME) lithium bis(trimemyMyl)amide (3.2 mmol, 3.2 ml, 1 M in THF)<br>
was added at -78°C. After 5 min, 5ii (2.9 mmol, 770 mg) was added and the reaction mixture<br>
was warmed up to -20°C, diluted with ethyl acetate and washed with brine. The organic layer<br>
was dried over MgSC&gt;4 and concentrated. Purification by flash chromatography with 6-12%<br>
methanol in DCM yielded 5.<br>

wise at rt and the reaction mixture was heated up to 120°C (bath temperature). K2CO3 (27.6<br>
g, 200 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture, followed by dropwise addition of 1,3-<br>
dibromopropane (10 g, 50 mmol). After heating for two more hours, the reaction was cooled<br>
to rt, poured into water (250 mL), and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was<br>
dried with Na2SC&gt;4 and concentrated to yield compound_35a as yellow oil which was<br>
employed in the next reaction.<br>
[0367] A solution of compound_35a (5 g) in aqueous HBr (48%, 50 ml) was distilled to<br>
remove the aqueous portion (about 20 ml), and the reaction mixture was refluxed for 40 h.<br>
Additional aqueous portion (5 ml) was removed by distillation and the reaction mixture was<br>
refluxed (4 h). The reaction mixture was cooled to rt, diluted with water (20 mL), and<br>
filtered through a celite pad. The filtrate was concentrated to dryness to yield a residue which<br>
was coevaporated with ethanol thrice, and following addition of a large volume of acetone a<br>
White Solid product 35b was filtered and washed with acetone twice and employed in the<br>
phosphorylation provided below.<br><br>
[0368] A suspension of compound_35b (1 g) in POCl3 (14 mL) was heated at 130°C for<br>
about 14 h and excess POCI3 removed under vacuum at 130°C (bath temperature). The<br>
residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel employing 10-80%<br>
ETOAc/hexane to yield product 35c which was convereted to compound 35 of the present<br>
invention employing the same procedure as provided in Example 2 employing for column<br>
chromatographic separation silica gel andlO-80% acetone/toluene as the eluent.<br>

methyl-2-nitroimidazole-5-carboxylic acid ethyl ester ("nitro ester") as a light brown solid<br>
(27 g, yield 62%).<br>
[0406] This method described in Example 24 and employing aqueous acetic acid is an<br>
improvement of the method using about 7% sulfuric acid (v/v) for the diazonium ion<br>
formation from the amino ester. Using aqueous sulfuric acid, the reaction volume becomes<br>
large causing difficulty in stirring the reaction mixture effectively. For example, a reaction<br>
involving 150 g of the amino ester required a reaction mixture volume of about 12 L. The<br>
sticky nitro ester formed as product in aqueous sulfuric acid and disrupted the stirring of the<br>
reaction mixture.<br><br>
[0407] A suspension of the nitro ester (39.2 g, 196.9 mmol) in IN NaOH (600 mL) and<br>
water (200 mL) was stirred at rt for about 20 h to give a clear light brown solution. The pH<br>
of the reaction mixture was adjusted to about 1 by addition of cone. HC1 and the reaction<br>
mixture extracted with EA (5 x 150 mL). The combined ethyl acetate layers were dried over<br>
MgSO4 and concentrated to yield l-N-methyl-2-nitroimidazole-5-carboxylis acid ("nitro<br>
acid") as a light brown solid (32.2 g, 95%).<br><br><br>
[0408] A mixture of the nitro acid (30.82 g, 180.23 mmol) and triethylamine (140 mL, 285<br>
mmol) in anhydrous THF (360 mL) was stirred while the reaction mixture was cooled in a<br>
dry ice-acetonitrile bath (temperature 
mmol) was added drop wise to this cooled reaction mixture during a period of 10 min and<br>
stirred for 1 h followed by the addition of sodium borohydride (36 g, 947 mmol) and<br>
dropwise addition of water during a period of 1 h while maintaining a temperature around or<br>
less than 0°C. The reaction mixture was warmed up to 0°C. The solid was filtered off and<br>
washed with THF. The combined THF portions were evaporated to yield l-N-methyl-2-<br>
nitroimidazole-5-methanol as an orange solid (25 g) which was recrystallized from ethyl<br>
acetate.<br>
Example 27<br>
Synthesis of Compound 119<br>
[0409] To a suspension of l-N-methyl-2-nitroimidazole-5-methanol (50 mg, 0.32 mmol) in<br>
DME, LiN(TMS)2 was added at -78°C with vigorous stirring. After 10 min, compound 119i<br>
(67 mg, 0.32 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was warmed to if. After 1 h, the<br>
reaction mixture was concentrated and the residue was separated by chromatography on silica<br>
gel (0 -100% acetone\toluene) to yield Compound 119.<br><br>
Examples 28A-28V<br><br>
[0410] Compounds 134 to 155 were synthesized by employing the corresponding<br>
substituted phosphormarmdate and hydroxy substituted Trigger (Trigger-OH), according to<br>
the procedures described in Examples 1-27 above.<br><br>
Example 29B<br>
Antiproliferation Assay<br>
[0412] To determine the effect of phosphoramidate alkylator prodrugs on cell proliferation,<br>
the antiproliferative activity of these compounds was tested in a multi-well Alamar Blue-<br>
based assay. Cell growth in the presence and absence of the test compound was compared, as<br>
measured by a fluorescence plate reader at excitation 550nm and emission 590nm (see<br>
Biosource International Inc., Tech Application Notes, Use of Alamar Blue in the<br>
measurement of Cell Viability and Toxicity, Determining IC50). The following cell lines were<br>
tested with 20,000 cells/well/500uL medium: NC1-H460 cells (ATCC HTB-177, RPMI<br>
medium (Gibco Products, Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA)), HT29 cells (ATCC HTB-<br>
38, RPMI medium (Gibco)), MES-SA cells (ATCC CRL-1976, McCoy's 5a medium<br>
(ATCC)), MES-SA/Dx5 cells ((ATCC CRL-1977), McCoy's 5a medium (ATCC)), ACHN<br>
cells (ATCC CRL-1611, Minimum essential medium, Eagle (ATCC)), PC3 cells (ATCC<br>
CRL-1435, Ham's F12K medium (ATCC)). The cells were seeded in glass inserts placed in<br>
each well of a 24-well plate in the density and medium as specified above one day prior to<br>
compound testing. After 24 hours, these plates were divided into two groups - anoxia group<br>
and air group. A test compound was added to each well (200uL volume) in the treatment<br>
groups at concentrations varying from 100,30,10,3,1,0.3,0.1,0.03, to 0.01 uM. All test<br><br>
compounds were serially diluted in complete medium with final DMSO concentrations less<br>
than or equal to 1% in each well. The cells in the anoxia treatment group were incubated for<br>
2 hours in a Bactron II anaerobic chamber. The cells in the air treatment group were<br>
incubated for 2 hours in standard tissue-culture incubators. Following the 2 hour treatment<br>
with a test compound, the test compound was removed from each well, cells were washed<br>
with 500uL medium, and incubated for 3 days in 500uL fresh medium. After 3 days, cells<br>
were stained with 10% Alamar Blue for 2 hours after which the capacity of cells to proliferate<br>
was measured (as mentioned above), and the 50% growth inhibitory concentration (GIso (also<br>
referred to IC5o herein)) of test compounds was calculated and tabulated in Table X below.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 30<br>
Antiproliferation Assay - Oxygen Dependence<br>
[0413] To determine the oxygen dependence of phosphoramidate alkylator prodrugs, the<br>
antiproliferative activity of these compounds was tested in a multi-well Alamar Blue-based<br>
assay as previously described (see Example 29). NC1-H460 cells (ATCC HTB-177, RPMI<br>
medium (Gibco)) or HT29 (ATCC HTB-38, RPMI medium (Gibco)) were seeded at 20,000<br>
cells/well/500uL medium in glass inserts in 24-well plates one day prior to testing. The cells<br>
were incubated for 2 hours in a Bactron II anaerobic chamber flushed with gasses of the<br>
desired oxygen concentrations varying from anoxia, 0.1%, 0.3%, 0.6%, 1%, 10% oxygen,<br>
and air. The calculated IC50 values (uM) are tabulated in Table Yl (H460 cells) or Table Y2<br>
(HT29 cells) below.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 31<br>
Clonogenic Assay - Oxygen Dependence<br>
[0414] To determine the oxygen dependence of phosphoramidate alkylator prodrugs, a<br>
clonogenic survival assay was performed. Cells were plated in 60 mm glass dishes (5x105<br>
cells per dish in 5mL of medium) 2 days prior to compound testing. The following cell lines<br>
were tested: NC1-H460 cells (ATCC HTB-177, RPMI medium (Gibco)), HT29 cells (ATCC<br>
HTB-38, RPMI medium (Gibco)), PC3 cells (ATCC CRL-1435, Ham's F12K medium<br>
(ATCC)). A solution of the test compound was made in complete medium immediately<br>
before the test and added directly to cells (2mL volume). Anoxia or hypoxia (less than<br>
200ppm O2) was achieved by exposing the glass dishes in a Bactron II anaerobic chamber or<br>
in aluminum vessels (see Example 33) for 2 hours. For the anaerobic chamber, desired levels<br>
of oxygenation between 200ppm and air were achieved by flushing the anaerobic chamber<br>
with pre-calibrated gasses prior to experimentation. For the aluminum vessels, anoxia or<br><br>
hypoxia was achieved by exposing the glass dishes in pre-warmed, air tight aluminum jigs to<br>
a series of five rapid evacuations and flushings with 95% nitrogen plus 5% carbon dioxide in<br>
a 37°C water bath on a shaking platform (controls are flushed as well). After the fifth<br>
evacuation and flushing, the platform (with water bath and jigs) was shaken for 5 minutes,<br>
after which one more evacuation and flushing were performed, and the jigs were transferred<br>
to a shaker in a 37 degree C incubator for the remainder of the 1 to 2 hour drug exposure.<br>
Levels of oxygenation between 200 ppm and air were achieved by varying the degree and<br>
number of evacuations. The oxygen concentrations in the medium and gas phases were<br>
checked using an oxygen electrode (Annua, Phoenixville, PA) in a specially modified<br>
aluminum jig that allowed for monitoring of both gas and liquid phases. Following the<br>
exposure to drug, the glass dishes were removed from the chamber or aluminum vessels and<br>
the drug was washed off the cells by rinsing with medium. The cells were then trypsinized<br>
and plated for clonogenic survival in plastic Petri dishes. Ten to 14 days later, the dishes<br>
were stained with crystal violet (0.25% in 95% ethanol), and colonies containing-more than<br>
50 cells were counted (see Example 33). The P0% growth inhibitory concentration (IC90,<br>
90% killing, 10% survival) of test compounds was calculated and tabulated in Table Y3<br>
below.<br><br><br>
[0415] To determine the electrochemical properties and reduction potentials of<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator prodrugs, cyclic voltammograms of these compounds were<br>
generated by Bioanalytical Systems, Inc. All experiments were conducted with glassy carbon<br>
(3.0mm diameter) working electrodes, Ag/AgCl reference electrodes, and platinum wire<br>
auxiliary electrodes. Compounds were dissolved in lmL methanol to make final drug<br>
concentrations between 0.5 and 1.5mM after the addition of 9mL Phosphate Buffered Saline<br>
(PBS). The solution was added to an electrochemical cell vial and sparged with Argon for 5<br>
minutes to remove most of the oxygen. Cyclic voltammetry was performed at 100 mV/sec<br>
and at 10,000 mV/sec scan rates at a glassy carbon working electrode. One test run was<br>
performed at a CGME mercury electrode (CGME in SMDE mode, 150um bore capillary,<br>
size 8 drop), but little difference was observed between mercury and glassy carbon<br>
voltammograms, so the mercury electrode was not used further. The single electron or<br>
multiple electron reduction potentials of compounds were generated at each scan rate and are<br>
tabulated in the table below.<br><br><br>
Clonogenic Survival Assay<br>
[0416] The phosphoramidate alkylator prodrugs of the invention were tested in the assay as<br>
follows. Exponentially growing human H460 cells (obtained from the ATCC) were seeded<br>
into 60mm notched glass plates at a density of between 2.5 and 5 xlO5 cells per plate and<br>
grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum for 2 days prior to<br>
initiating drug treatment. On the day of the test, drug stocks of known concentrations were<br>
prepared in complete medium, and 2 ml of the desired stock added to each plate. To achieve<br>
complete equilibration between the surrounding gas phase and the liquid phase, the lid of the<br>
glass plate was removed and the plate shaken for 5 minutes on an orbital shaker. The plates<br>
were recovered and stored inside a glove-box. The glove-box was evacuated and gassed with<br>
either a certified anoxic gas mixture (95% nitrogen and 5% carbon dioxide) or with an<br>
aerobic (normoxic) gas mixture (95% air and 5% carbon dioxide). Cells were then incubated<br>
with the drug for 2 hours at 37°C.<br>
[0417J At the end of prodrug treatment, plates were removed from each vessel, and the<br>
prodrug was promptly removed from the cells. Plates were washed with phosphate buffered<br>
saline and a solution of trypsin-EDTA and then trypsinized for 5 minutes at 37°C. Detached<br>
cells were neutralized with medium plus serum and collected by centrifugation for 5 min at<br>
lOOxg. Cells were resuspended at approximately lxlO6 cells/ml and diluted 10 fold to yield<br>
stock concentrations for plating. The concentration of each stock was determined by<br>
counting with a Coulter Z2 particle counter. Known numbers of cells were plated, and the<br>
plates were placed in an incubator for between 7 and 10 days. Colonies were fixed and<br>
stained with a solution of 95% ethanol and 0.25% crystal violet. Colonies of greater than 50<br>
cells were counted, and the surviving fraction was determined.<br>
[0418] lOmdeeDtaritWiic<br>
assays were performed in the same way as<br>
described above and in Example 31.<br>
[0419] Cytotoxicity of compounds (Tables 1A and IB) were determined in hypoxia and in<br>
normoxia by clonogenic assay employing H460 and HT29 cell lines as provided in Examples<br>
31 and 33 and expressed as IC90 in uM, and by anti-proliferation assay performed by<br>
modifying a multi-well assay described by Hay et ah, I Med. Client., 2003,46:169-82<br>
employing H460, HT29, HCT116, and DX-5 cell lines and expressed as IC50 in uM (see<br>
Example 29). The ratio of IC50 or IC90 determined in normoxia and hypoxia is called hypoxia<br><br>
cytotoxicity ration (HCR) and can be a measure of the hypoxia selective cytotoxicity of the<br>
prodrugs of the present invention.<br><br><br><br><br>
Effect of Compound 25 on Cell Cycle Distribution<br>
[0420] Cells (H60, PC3 and HT29) were seeded at a density of 1.0 x 106 cells/3ml medium<br>
per 60mm dish. After 24 h attachment, cells were exposed to Compound 25 at the indicated<br>
concentrations for 2 h under either normoxia (air) or anoxia (nitrogen). Cells were washed<br>
twice, and incubated for additional 22 h in fresh medium. Cells were trypsinized,<br>
centrifuged, and fixed in 75% ethanol at least for 24 h at -20°C. Cell cycle distribution was<br>
determined using Guava Cell Cycle reagent (Guava, Hayward, CA) by flow cytometry<br>
(Guava, Hayward, CA). The data demonstrate that Compound 25 induces cell cycle arrest in<br>
oxygen- and concentration-dependent manner in multiple human cancer cell lines.<br><br><br><br>
Example 35<br>
Spheroid Model<br>
[0421] Two human cancer cell lines were used in these spheroid studies to determine the<br>
efficacy of the hypoxic activated phophoramidate alkylator prodrugs. HT29 colorectal<br>
adenocarcinoma (colon carcinoma) cells were seeded directly into a 125 ml spinner flask at<br>
10,000 cells/ mL and grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics.<br>
As these cells divided, they adhered to each other and formed spheroids. H460 lung<br>
carcinoma cells were seeded into a flask coated with a non-adherent surface to form small<br>
balls of cells that can be seeded into a spinner flask. To initiate H460 cell seeds, 150 cm2<br>
tissue culture flasks were coated with 1% agarose and then 10,000 cells per flask were added<br>
and allowed to grow in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics for 3 to 5<br>
days before seeding into spinner cultures. For both cell lines, growth medium was changed<br>
every day after the spheroids became visible to the eye.<br>
[0422] In order to determine the morphology and the location of hypoxic regions within an<br>
intact spheroid, whole spheroids were prepared for histology. For frozen sections, intact<br>
spheroids were washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and embedded in OCT and<br>
rapidly frozen in a dry ice/2-methylbutane solution before being stored at -80°C. For paraffin<br>
embedded sections, intact spheroids were fixed in a freshly prepared solution of 4%<br>
paraformaldehyde in PBS and subsequently embedded and sectioned.<br>
[0423] To assess the ability of a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug to penetrate to the<br>
inner hypoxic cancer cells, become activated, release the phosphoramidate alkylator, and kill<br>
those inner cancer cells, the clonogenic survival of spheroids exposed to drug for 2 h was<br>
measured.<br><br>
[0424] Spheroids were placed in a new growth medium and incubated for at least 1 h<br>
before beginning experiments. Spheroids between 500 and 600 urn were isolated by filtering<br>
the spheroid culture through a series of sterile mesh filters of defined size. Between 10 and<br>
20 spheroids were placed on a siliconized notched 60 mm Pyrex dish in 3 mL of medium<br>
with the desired concentration of the test compound. The dishes were placed in sealed<br>
aluminum vessels and exposed to a series of evacuations and gassings with certified gases<br>
containing 5% CO2 and a defined amount of 02 (0% O2, 3% O2,10% 02 or air). Spheroids<br>
were incubated in a shaking water bath to ensure both the equilibrium of the dissolved O2 in<br>
solution and the integrity of the spheroids in solution for 2 h. The test compound was<br>
removed and the spheroids were washed before being completely digested with trypsin.<br>
Since the necrotic core contains cellular debris a treatment with DNase I was required to<br>
yield a uniform single cell-suspension. Cells were resuspended at 106/mL and plated for<br>
clonogenic survival.<br>
[0425] Initial dose response experiments were performed in monolayer cells under nitrogen,<br>
0.6% O2, or air to establish the appropriate dose range and the oxygen dependence of<br>
phosphoramidate alkylator release from a phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug. Clonogenic<br>
survival was the end point and the data are summarized by the IC90 or C90 values (the<br>
inhibitory concentration required to kill 90% of the cells and yield 10% survival).<br>
Daunorubicin and cisplatin, each of which penetrates into speroids to a different extent, were<br>
employed to kill the outer aerobic cancer cells of the spheroid. Daunorubicin was used to<br>
penetrate the outer layers of a multicellular spheroid due to its high affinity toward cells and<br>
cisplatin was used at doses appropriate kill only the outer aerobic cancer cells. As a control<br>
for a bioreductive drug that killed cells under hypoxia in monolayer cultures, but not in<br>
multicellular cell culture due to its high reactivity and poor penetration, Tirapazamine was<br>
used both in monolayer based experments and in spheroids as tabulated below for H460 cells<br>
exposed for 2 h.<br><br><br>
[0426] A series of phosphoramidate alkylator prodrugs were tested in spheroids to<br>
determine their ability to penetrate into the inner lying hypoxic cancer cells, become<br>
activated, and kill the hypoxic cells. The results are tabulated below.<br><br>
[0427] Similar results for the efficacy of Compound 25 were demonstrated in the HT29<br>
spheroids as tabulated below:<br><br>
[0428] The phosphoramidate alkylator prodrug was combined simultaneously with<br>
cisplatin or daunorubicin and the spreroids exposed for 2 h to the combination, followed by<br>
measurement of clonogenic survival. The results are tabulated below:<br><br>
[0429] Phosphoramidate alkylator prodrugs demonstrate the ability to penetrate into the inner<br>
lying cells in the spheroid and kill hypoxic cancer cells alone and in combination with<br>
another agent that targets aerobic cancer cells.<br>
Example 36<br>
Antiproliferation Assay - DNA Mutant Repair Cells<br><br>
[0430] Chinese hamster ovary cells mutant to specific DNA repair pathways were obtained<br>
from ATCC. The following cell lines were tested with 2,500 or 3,000 cells/well/500uL<br>
Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and<br>
antibiotics: AA8 cells (ATCC CRL-1859), EM9 cells (ATCC CRL-1861), UV41 cells<br>
(ATCC CRH860), UV135 cells (ATCC CRW867), ERS1SF cells. All cell lines were<br>
initially screened with an anti-proliferation assay and those demonstrating sensitivity were<br>
retested with the clonogenic assay (as previously described) to confirm the proliferation<br>
results. Cells were exposed to selected doses of phosphoramidate alkylator prodrugs of the<br>
present invention for 2 h under hypoxic or aerobic conditions, the test compound was<br>
removed, and the cells assayed. The following table lists the cell lines, the pathway mutated,<br>
and the specific gene defect:<br><br>
[0431] The following table lists the effect of exposure of various cell lines to Compounds 25<br>
and 36 under anoxic or aerobic conditions and assayed by proliferation as measured by IC50.<br><br>
[0432] The following table lists the IC90 values for clonogenic survival for selected cells<br>
exposed to Comopund 25 under anoxic or aerobic conditions.<br><br>
[0433] Only cell lines defective in homologous recombination were sensitive to Compound<br>
25 under hypoxia. Since UV41 participates in both the nucleotide excision repair pathway as<br>
well as with the homologous recombination repair pathway, Compound 25 possibly also<br><br>
produced a significant amount of monoadducts. However, UV135 which is also involved in<br>
nucleotide excision repair was not sensitive to Compound 25. The predominant lesions<br>
produced by Compound 25 were DNA interstrand crosslinks. These results were confirmed<br>
in UV41 and irslSF cells with the clonogenic assay. The exposure under aerobic conditions<br>
produced the same spectrum of sensitivities as seen under hypoxia, indicating that the aerobic<br>
toxicity was also caused by DNA interstrand crosslink formation. Compound 36 exhibited a<br>
similar pattern of sensitivity in the mutant cell lines, indicating that Compound 36 also<br>
produced DNA interstrand crosslinks.<br>
Example 37<br>
Multilayered Cell Culture Assay<br>
[0434] This example demonstrates the effect of Compound 25 on tissue penetration using<br>
multilayered cell culture (MCC) and to assess any bystander effect. MCCs were incubated<br>
with oxygenated media (20% O2 &amp; 5% O2) or hypoxic media (approximately 0% O2) and the<br>
test compound was exposed from one side (exposed,surface, normoxic side) while the other<br>
side was temporarily closed off (far side, hypoxic side). When MCCs are incubated in<br>
media at 20% O2 or 5% O2 a gradient in oxygen develops from the surface exposed to the<br>
media towards the far surface of the culture. The furthest 50 um of tissue becomes depleted<br>
of oxygen. The extent of O2 depletion is greater with 5% than the 20% Oz gassed media;<br>
incubation with 5% O2 reflects the in vivo situation most closely. Incubating MCCs with<br>
media at 0% O? models perfusion limited hypoxia, where tumor blood vessels become<br>
completely depleted of oxygen and test compound must penetrate extensive distances to<br>
reach all cells. This situation therefore poses a greater barrier to drug penetration, if binding<br>
of activated drug acts to limit its penetration.<br>
[0435] MCC based experiments were carried out with media gassed with 0, 5 or 20% 02<br>
for 45 minutes prior to and during incubation with the test compound. HCT116 cells were<br>
grown to a thickness of 150pm on a solid support and one side of the culture was clamped off<br>
to develop diffusion limited hypoxia. Cultures were exposed to test compound for 1 hr under<br>
0% O2,5% O2 or 20% O2 and efficacy assessed by measuring the inhibition of BrdU<br>
incorporation. The cultures were incubated for a second hour in fresh media at 20% 02 and<br>
removed from the apparatus and returned to a normal growth chamber, where media flows<br>
over both sides of the MCC. Cultures were incubated for 24 hours prior to BrdUrd labeling<br>
and subsequent cryosectioning. BrdUrd labeling on the exposed and far sides of the MCC<br><br>
were analyzed using immunohistochemical staining, microscope imaging and computer<br>
image analysis to assess the effect of Compound 25 on cell proliferation.<br>
[0436] When cultures were exposed to graded doses of Compound 25 under 20% O2, 5 fold<br>
less compound was required on the far (hypoxic) side compared to the exposed (normoxic)<br>
side to produce comparable results, demonstrating penetration and hypoxic activation of<br>
Compound 25. When MCC's were exposed to test compound under a more physiologically<br>
relevant condition of 5% O2, Compound 25 was 10 fold more effective at inhibiting BrdU<br>
incorporation on the hypoxic side as compared to the normoxic side. Normoxic sides of<br>
cultures at 5% &amp; 20% O2 were equally affected by exposure to Compound 25.<br>
[0437] Compound 25 is more effective on the hypoxic side of cultures under 5% O2 than<br>
with 0% O2. Comparison of normoxic versus hypoxic sides of cultures under 5% O2<br>
demonstrated that Compound 25 penetrates effectively through relatively well oxygenated<br>
tissue. Compound 25 is capable of killing hypoxic cells located about 150um from functional<br>
blood vessels. Approximately 3-fold reduction in exposure to Compound 25 to the hypoxic<br>
side was observed under 0% O2 relative to the exposure under 5% O9 conditions. Bystander<br>
effect was observed only at the highest concentration.<br>
[0438] The following table lists the effect of e exposed to graded doses of Compound 25 as<br>
measured by IC50 (concentration to inhibit BrdU incorporation by 50%).<br><br>
Example 38<br>
Metabolism of Compound 25<br>
By Human and Mouse Microsomal Protein<br>
[0439] An in vifro assessment of metabolic stability of a phosphoramidate alkylator<br>
prodrug (Compound 25) was performed using human (HLM), rat (RLM) and mouse (MLM)<br>
liver microsomal proteins containing cytochrome P450 enzymes. A solution of Compound<br>
25 (500uL, 5uM) was prepared by diluting a DMSO stock solution 100 fold in a<br>
watermethanol bridge solution, adding microsomal protein (1 mg/mL) in PBS/MgCl2, and<br>
enzymatic reactions initiated by adding an NADPH solution. 50 ul of the reaction mixture<br>
was withdrawn at 0,10,20, and 30 minutes after addition of the NADPH solution, the<br><br>
proteins were precipitated with acetonitrile and the clear supernatant was analyzed for the<br>
amount of Compound 25 by reversed phase LC-MS/MS. Nifedipine and testosterone were<br>
used as positive controls. The first study compared RLM to MLM (Table 1) and the second<br>
study compared HLM to RLM (Tables 2A and 2B)<br><br><br><br>

Iv Vivo Pharmacokinetics of Phosphoramidate Alkylator Prodrugs<br>
[0440] Various plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of phosphoramidate alkylator prodrugs<br>
were determined in CD-I mice except where noted as listed below in Table 3.<br><br><br><br>
Example 41<br>
Cytochrome P450 Inhibition of the Metabolism of Compound 25<br>
[0442] Eight reaction wells with 100 /J.L of a solution containing 50 mM potassium<br>
phosphate, pH 7.4,2.6 mM NADP+, 6.6 mM glucose-6-phosphate, 0.8 U/mL of glucose-6-<br>
phosphate dehydrogenase, andl :3 serial dilutions of the test compound (such as Compound<br>
25) were prepared along with eight wells of 1:3 serial dilutions of a suitable positive control<br>
inhibitor (such as furafylline for CYP1A2, sulfaphenazole for CYP2C9,' N-benzymirvanol for<br>
CYPC219, quinidine for CYP2D6 and ketoconazole for CYP3A4). The concentrations of<br>
test compound ranges from 0.0229 fiM to 200 fiM. The reactions were initiated by adding<br>
100 (iL of a pre-warmed enzyme/substrate solution. A zero time-point control reaction was<br>
prepared by adding 50 mL of 10% formic acid (400 mL of acetonitrile for 2C19) in water to<br>
100 mL of cofactor solution to inactivate the enzymes, then adding 100 mL of<br>
enzyme/substrate solution. A control reaction with no inhibitor was also prepared. After a<br>
suitable incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 50 mL of 10%<br>
formic acid in water (400 mL of acetonitrile for 2C19). The reactions were prepared and<br>
analyzed for the metabolite forms of the probe substrate (phenacetin for CYP1A2, diclofenac<br>
for CYP2C9, (S)-mephenytoin for CYPC219, dextromethorphan for CYP2D6 and<br>
midazolam, testosterone and nifedipine for CYP3A4) using HPLC/MS/MS. Each assay was<br>
performed in duplicate. A summary of the IC50 values are listed below.<br><br><br><br>

Determination of the Potential Metabolites of Compound 25<br>
Formed in Mouse, Rat, Dog and Human Hepatocytes<br>
[0443] Compound 25 is incubated with mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human cryopreserved<br>
hepatocytes at a concentration of 10 uM. The reactions are stopped at 0 (pre-incubation), 30,<br>
60 and 120 minutes by quenching with acetonitrile prior to centrirugation and analysis by<br>
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in conjunction with tandem mass<br>
spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Potential metabolites are identified by performing full scans<br>
from 100 to 520 amu. The product ion spectra of the potential metabolites are subsequently<br>
collected and compared to the product ion spectrum of the parent compound to determine<br>
whether each potential metabolite is related to Compound 25. The disappearance of the<br>
parent compound (Compound 25) and the appearance of potential metabolites over time are<br>
monitored by comparing the peak heights at each time point acquired.<br>

Determination of the In Vivo Pharmacokinetics of Compound 25 and its Metabolite (s) in<br>
Rat, Dog and Monkey<br>
[0444] Pharmacokinetic parameters of Compound 25 and its metabolite(s) in Sprague<br>
Dawley rats are determined following single intravenous administration of 5,20, 50 and 100<br>
mg/kg Compound 25. The pharmacokinetics of Compound 25 and its metabolite(s) will also<br>
be determined in beagle dogs and cynomologus monkeys following single intravenous<br>
administration of 20 mg/kg Compound 25. Concentrations of Compound 25 and its<br>
metabolite(s) in plasma are determined by a LC/MS/MS method and mean pharmacokinetic<br>
parameters are computed.<br>
Example 44<br>
Mass Balance Study in Rats<br><br>
[0445] Normal and bile-cannulated Sprague-Dawley rats are administered 14C-Compound<br>
25 as a single intravenous dose. Blood plasma, urine, feces and are collected at specified<br>
times and concentrations of total radioactivity are determined by liquid scintillation counting<br>
(LSC).<br>
Example 45<br>
Quantitative Whole Body Autoradiography<br>
[0446] Sprague-Dawley rats are administered a single intravenous dose of 14C-Compound<br>
25. At specified times, one rat per time point is euthanized. Blood is centrifuged to obtain<br>
plasma, and the blood and plasma are analyzed for concentration of radioactivity. Frozen rat<br>
carcasses are embedded in 2% CMC, frozen into a block and sectioned at 40 um in a Leica<br>
CM 3600 cryomicrotome. Collected sections are freeze-dried, mounted and exposed on<br>
phosphorimaging plates along with 14C autoradiographic standards for subsequent calibration<br>
of the image analysis software. Exposed screens are scanned using a Molecular Dynamics<br>
Storm 820 or 860. The concentration of radidactivity in select tissues including adipose<br>
(brown and white), adrenal gland, blood, brain (cerebrum, cerebellum, medulla) bone, bone<br>
marrow, cecum and contents, epididymis, esophagus, eyeball (Uveal tract, aqueous humor,<br>
lens), Harderian gland, heart, kidney (cortex, medulla, papilla and entire section), large<br>
intestine and contents, liver, lung, lymph node submaxillary), pancreas, pituitary gland,<br>
prostate gland, salivary gland, seminal vesicles, skeletal muscle, skin, stomach (and<br>
contents), small intestine (and contents), spleen, spinal cord, trachea, thyroid and urinary<br>
bladder (and contents) are measured by image analysis. Autoradioluminographs and digital<br>
images are produced for each animal.<br>
Example 46<br>
Plasma Protein Binding of Compound 25<br>
[0447] The protein binding in mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human plasma of Compound 25<br>
is determined using ultrafiltration. Ultrafiltration is performed by aliquoting plasma spiked at<br>
three concentrations with Compound 25 into a Centrifree® device in triplicate. All plasma<br>
samples are then equilibrated to 37°C. The Centrifree® apparatus is centrifuged at 37°C for<br>
30 minutes at 2500 x g. A 75 uL aliquot of the ultrafilitrate is spiked with the I.S. (deuterated<br>
Compound 25) and analysed using LC/MS/MS. The ultrafiltrates are analyzed and quantified<br>
using human ultrafiltrate standards for the calibration curve.<br><br>
Example 47<br>
[0448] Example 47 demonstrates the usefulness of a compound of this invention in treating<br>
cancer employing a HT-29 human colon carcinoma xenograft mouse model.<br>
[0449] Female CB17/SCE) mice (purchased from Charles River, Cambridge, MA), 7-8<br>
weeks of age, were allowed to acclimatize for at least three days, and handled under<br>
pathogen-free conditions. Human colon carcinoma cell line HT-29 was obtained from the<br>
American Type Culture Collection. The cell lines were cultured in RPMI1640 media<br>
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were maintained in a 37°C incubator with<br>
5% CO2. The HT-29 cells were harvested from culture and inoculated at 3 x 106 cells/ animal<br>
in the peritoneal subcutaneous space. When the tumors grew to an average volume of 100<br>
mm3 (day 8), each group of 10 mice was administered for three weeks, vehicle alone (saline<br>
and PEG (lOmL/kg each), Group 1), Compound 36 alone (dissolved in 30% cyclodextrin in<br>
PBS) at a daily dose of 20,60, or 200 mg/kg (Groups 2,3 and 4, respectively), and<br>
Compound 36 at a daily dose of 20,60, and 200 mg/kg given 2-3 hours after a dose of 10<br>
mg/kg of 5FU (in saline) (Group 5,6 and 7, respectively) and compared to a group receiving<br>
only 5FU at 10 mg/kg (Group 8) as tabulated below.<br>
[0450] The body weight of each mouse was recorded twice per week. Growth of each<br>
xenograft was monitored by externally measuring tumors in two dimensions using a digital<br>
caliper twice per week. Tumor volume (V) was determined by the following equation: V =<br>
(L x W2) /2, where L is the length and W is the width of a xenograft. Tumor volumes were<br>
measured twice weekly.<br>
[0451] Administration of Compound 36 at 20,60, and 200 mg/kg/day each reduced tumor<br>
growth compared to administration of vehicle alone. Administration of a combination of<br>
Compound 36 and 5FU resulted in greater and dose related inhibition of tumor growth<br>
compared to vehicle. In addition combinations of 60 and 200 mg/kg of Compound 36<br>
reduced tumor growth to a greater degree than 5FU alone.<br><br><br><br>
[0452] Associated with these anti-tumor effects, there was some degree of weight loss and<br>
occasional mortality, particularly in the group treated with the high dose of Compound 36 but<br>
in other groups as well. Overall, Compound 36 showed varying rates of tumor growth<br>
inhibition.<br>
Example 48<br>
[0453] Example 48 demonstrates the usefulness of a compound of this invention in treating<br>
cancer employing a NCI H460, human colon carcinoma xenograft mouse model.<br>
{0454] Female CB17/SCID mice (purchased from Charles River, Cambridge, MA), 7-8<br>
weeks of age, were allowed to acclimatize for at least three days, and handled under<br>
pathogen-free conditions. Human colon carcinoma cell line NCI H460 was obtained from the<br>
American Type Culture Collection. The cell lines were cultured and harvested according to<br>
the procedure described in Example 47 and inoculated at 1 x 106 cells/ animal in the<br>
peritoneal subcutaneous space. When the tumors grew to an average volume of 100 mm3<br>
(day 8), each group of mice was administered for three weeks, as tabulated in the table below:<br>
Compound 25 (2.5 mg/ml in 10% PEG; administration route - i.p.) and Taxol (1 mg/ml in<br>
5% EtOH, 5% Cremophor and 90% saline; administration - i. v. 2 h after administration of<br>
Compound 25). The body weight and tumor volumes were measured as described in<br>
Example 47 above.<br><br><br><br>
qld/qd = every day; q2d = every second day; q7d = every seventh day.<br>
[0455] Results are presented in Table X2 based on tumor volume measurement on day 29<br>
when vehicle treated mice had reached a volume of 946 mm3. Groups of 5 mice receiving<br>
saline or no treatment were added in order to indicate any vehicle effects but are not used for<br>
comparisons in this analysis.<br><br>
[0456] The results demonstrate that all three regimens for dosing Compound 25 provided<br>
similar degrees of tumor growth inhibition and that combination therapy, particularly with<br>
every day dosing provided additional benefit Each combination therapy was associated with<br>
some degree of weight loss but not large enough to cause any mortality. Overall the results<br>
indicate that Compound 25 is efficacious in this model of lung cancer and provides additional<br>
benefit to that provided by the standard chemotherapeutic agent, taxol.<br>
[0457] Using the mouse to HED conversion, Compound 25 can be administered at a<br>
therapeutically effective dose of about 2 to about 8 mg/kg/day, for the treatment of cancer,<br>
particularly lung cancer, alone or in combination with Taxol™, wherein the daily dose can be<br>
administered with a decreasing frequency of dosing for higher doses compared to lower<br>
doses.<br>
Example 49<br>
[0458] Example 49 describes the usefulness of a compound of this invention in treating<br>
cancer as demonstrated employing a H460, non-small lung carcinoma xenograft mouse<br>
model. Female CB17/SCID mice (purchased from Charles River, Cambridge, MA), 7-8<br>
weeks of age, were allowed to acclimatize for at least three days, and handled under<br><br>
pathogen-free conditions. Human non-small lung carcinoma cell line NCI H460 was<br>
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The cell lines were cultured and<br>
harvested as described in Example 47 above, and inoculated at 3 x 106 cells/ animal in the<br>
peritoneal subcutaneous space. When the tumors grew to an average volume of 100 mm3<br>
(day 8), each group of mice (ten per group) was administered for three weeks, as tabulated in<br>
the table below: Compound 25 (2.5mg/ml in 10% PEG; administration route - i.p.);<br>
Compound 24 (0.3,0.lmg/ml in 10%PEG, administration route - i.p.) and Taxol (1 mg/ml in<br>
5% EtOH, 5% Cremophor and 90% saline; administration - i.v. 2 h after administration of the<br>
test compound).<br><br>
[0459] The body weight and tumor volume was determined as described in Example 47<br>
above. Results for tumor growth inhibition measured on day 27 are as tabulated below.<br>
Comparisons were made on day 27 because that was the last day of measurements for the<br>
vehicle group and those animals were sacrificed.<br><br>
[0460] These results demonstrate that daily doses of 3 mg/kg of Compound 24 and 25<br>
mg/kg of Compound 25 inhibited tumor growth and that Compound 25 had a slightly greater<br>
benefit both as monotherapy and in combination with taxol. These effects were accompanied<br>
by mild weight reductions, particularly in the Compound 25 + taxol group.<br><br>
[0461] Using the mouse to HED conversion, Compound 25 can be administered at a<br>
therapeutically effective dose of 2 mg/kg/day, for the treatment of cancer, particularly lung<br>
cancer, alone or in combination with Taxol™, and Compound 24 can be administered at a<br>
therapeutically effective dose of 0.25 mg/kg/day, for the treatment of cancer, particularly<br>
lung cancer, alone or in combination with Taxol™.<br>
Example 50<br>
[0462] Example 50 describes the usefulness of a compound of this invention in treating<br>
cancer as demonstrated employing a HT-29, human colon carcinoma xenograft mouse model.<br>
Female CB17/SCID mice (purchased from Charles River, Cambridge, MA), 7-8 weeks of<br>
age, were allowed to acclimatize for at least three days, and handled under pathogen-free<br>
conditions. Human colon carcinoma cell line HT29 was obtained from the American Type<br>
Culture Collection. The cell lines were cultured and harvested as described in Example 47<br>
above, and inoculated at 3 x 106 cells/ animal in the peritoneal subcutaneous space. When the<br>
tumors grew to an average volume of 100 mm3 (day 8), each group of mice (ten per group)<br>
was administered for three weeks, as tabulated in the table below: Compound 24 (in<br>
10%PEG), administration route - i.p., administrated 2 h before 5-FU or cisplatin (CDDP; in<br>
saline) on the days the combination therapy was scheduled; 5FU alone (in saline), or CDDP<br>
alone.<br><br><br>
[0463] In control groups, tumors were implanted in two locations as part of separate study<br>
of effect of location on control group tumor growth. These results had no impact on the<br>
interpretation of the study and all treatments were compared to the vehicle group with tumors<br>
on the same are of the body. The body weight and tumor volume were measured as described<br>
in Example 47. Tumor growth inhibition measured on day 25 when vehicle tumors had<br>
reached the maximal size and animals in that group were sacrificed is tabulated below<br><br>
[0464J The results demonstrate that Compound 24 as monotherapy resulted in tumor<br>
growth inhibition of slightly more than 40% whereas combining Compound 24 administered<br>
in combination with CDDP or 5FU provided about 50-70% growth inhibition. According to<br>
this Example, the most therapeutically effective combination was that of Compound 24 and<br>
5FU. The effects on tumor growth were associated with minor decreases in weights of the<br>
mice during treatment; however the mice recovered the lost weight after the end of treatment.<br>
{0465] Using the mouse to HED conversion, Compound 24 can be administered at a<br>
therapeutically effective dose of about 0.25 to about 0.50 mg/kg/day, for the treatment of<br>
cancer, particularly colon cancer, alone or in combination with 5FU or CDDP.<br>
Example 51<br>
[0466] Example 51 describes the usefulness of a compound of this invention in treating<br>
cancer as demonstrated employing a H460, non-small lung carcinoma xenograft mouse<br>
model. Female CB17/SCID mice (purchased from Charles River, Cambridge, MA), 7-8<br>
weeks of age, were allowed to acclimatize for at least three days, and handled under<br>
pathogen-free conditions. Human non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line NCI H460 was<br>
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The cell lines were cultured and<br>
harvested as described in Example 47 above, and inoculated at 3 x 10 cells/ animal in the<br><br>
peritoneal subcutaneous space. When the tumors grew to an average volume of 100 nun',<br>
treatment was initiated in which groups of 10 mice received vehicle (Group 1), CDDP at 3 or<br>
6 mg/kg (Groups 2 and 3, respectively, IVone time), Compound 25 at 50 mg/kg in saline 5<br>
times per week for two weeks (Group 4), Compound 25 at 100 mg/kg every three days for 5<br>
times (Group 5) or the combination of each dose of Compound 25 with either 3 or 6 mg/kg of<br>
CDDP (Groups 6 and 7, respectively). Results for groups receiving 50 mg/kg of Compound<br>
25 are illustrated in the Figure 1. Figure 2 shows similar results for 100 mg/kg of Compound<br>
25.<br>
[0467] These results performed with a saline formulated version of Compound 25<br>
demonstrate significant dose related decrease in tumor volume and increase in tumor growth<br>
delay with a daily dose of 50 mg/kg, and 100 mg/kg with less frequent dosing compared to<br>
that employed for the 50 mg/kg daily dose. These data also demonstrate that both dosing<br>
regimens add to the effects of CDDP in this model.<br>
[0468] Using the mouse to HED conversion, Compound 25 can be administered at a<br>
therapeutically effective doses of about 4 to about 8 mg/kg/day, for the treatment of cancer,<br>
particularly lung cancer, alone or in combination with 5FU or CDDP, wherein the daily dose<br>
can be administered with a decreasing frequency of dosing for higher doses compared to<br>
lower doses.<br>
Example 52<br>
[0469] Example 52 describes the usefulness of a compound of this invention in treating<br>
cancer as demonstrated employing a HT-29, human colon carcinoma xenograft mouse model.<br>
Female CB17/SCID mice (purchased from Charles River, Cambridge, MA), 7-8 weeks of<br>
age, were allowed to acclimatize for at least three days, and handled under pathogen-free<br>
conditions. Human colon carcinoma cell line HT29 was obtained from the American Type<br>
Culture Collection. The cell lines were cultured and harvested as described in Example 47<br>
and inoculated at 3 x 106 cells/ animal in the peritoneal subcutaneous space. When the<br>
tumors grew to an average volume of 100 mm (day 8), each group of mice (ten per group)<br>
was administered for three weeks, as tabulated in the table below: Compound 25 in saline,<br>
administration route - i.p., administrated 2 h before CDDP on the days the combination<br>
therapy is scheduled and CDDP (in saline, IV).<br>
Treatment protocol<br><br><br>
[0470] The body weight and tumor volume was determined as described in Example 47.<br>
Data are based on tumor volumes at day 25 when tumors in the vehicle group had reached<br>
sufficient size to require that the mice be sacrificed. The results of inhibition of tumor<br>
growth are tabulated below.<br><br>
[04711 Tb-e results demonstrate that monotherapy administering Compound 25, formulated<br>
in saline, at 50mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day with a variety of dose regimens results in<br>
inhibition of tumor growth in this model of colon cancer, and that treatment combination of<br>
Compound 25 and CDDP enhanced the effectiveness of Compound 25 for treatment of colon<br>
cancer in this model. These effects were accompanied by modest body weight loss, more so<br>
in the combination groups; the mice recovered the lost body weights after the treatment<br>
ended.<br><br>
[0472] Using the mouse to HED conversion, Compound 25 can be administered at a<br>
therapeutically effective doses of about 4 to about 8 mg/kg/day, for the treatment of cancer,<br>
particularly non-small cell lung cancer, alone or in combination with CDDP, wherein the<br>
daily dose can be administered with a decreasing frequency of dosing for higher doses<br>
compared to lower doses.<br>
Example 53<br>
[0473J Example 53 describes the usefulness of a compound of this invention in treating<br>
cancer as demonstrated employing a H460, non-small lung carcinoma xenograft mouse<br>
model. Female CB17/SCID mice (purchased from Charles River, Cambridge, MA), 7-8<br>
weeks of age, were allowed to acclimatize for at least three days, and handled under<br>
pathogen-free conditions. Human colon carcinoma cell line NCI H460 was obtained from the<br>
American Type Culture Collection. The cell lines were cultured and harvested as described<br>
in Example 47 and inoculated at 3 x 106 cells/ animal in the peritoneal subcutaneous space.<br>
When the tumors grew to an average volume of 100 mm , treatment was initiated in which<br>
groups of 10 mice received vehicle (Group 1), CDDP at 6 mg/kg (IV one time, Group 2),<br>
Compound 25 at 150 mg/kg in saline, once a week for two weeks (i.p., Group 3), or the<br>
combination of the two agents (Group 4).<br>
[0474] The results shown in Figure 3 demonstrate that 150 mg/kg per week of Compound<br>
25 provided greater reduction in tumor growth than CDDP alone and that the combination of<br>
the two agents resulted in added benefit. These results also indicate that during the two week<br>
period of dosing mean tumor volume did not change indicating complete inhibition of tumor<br>
growth. These data indicate that Compound 25 administered at 150 mg/kg/day as<br>
monotherapy, once a week, is the most effective all the dosing regimens described in the<br>
preceding examples (Examples 47-52). Little change in body weight was observed<br>
suggesting reduced toxicity with this dosing regimen.<br>
[0475] Using the mouse to HED conversion, Compound 25 can be administered at a<br>
therapeutically effective dose of about 12 mg/kg/day, for the treatment of cancer, optionally<br>
administered at a frequency of once every week, particularly non-small cell lung cancer,<br>
alone or in combination with CDDP.<br>
Example 54<br><br>
[0476] Example 54 describes efficacy of Compound 25 via an ip bolus injection or ip<br>
infusion alone or in combination with Cisplatin in H460 xenografts mouse model. Female<br>
Nu-Foxnlnu homozygous nu/nu mice (purchased from Charles River, Cambridge, MA), 6<br>
weeks of age, were allowed to acclimatize for at least three days, and handled under<br>
pathogen-free conditions. Human colon carcinoma cell line HT29 was obtained from the<br>
American Type Culture Collection. The cell lines were cultured and harvested as described<br>
in Example 47 and inoculated at 3 x 106 cells/ animal in the peritoneal subcutaneous space.<br>
When the tumors grew to an average volume of 100 mm3 (day 8), each group of mice (ten per<br>
group) was administered for three weeks, as tabulated in the table below: compound<br>
Compound 25 (formulated as a 15 mg/ml saline solution, administration route - i.p.,<br>
adrninistrated 2 h before CDDP on the days the combination therapy is scheduled and CDDP<br>
in saline, IV.<br><br>
[0477] The body weight and tumor volume was determined as described in Example 47.<br>
The results are indicated in Figure 4. The data indicate that, while continuous application of<br>
Compound 25 alone or in combination with CDDP is efficacious, intermittent, such as once a<br>
week dosing can provide greater therapeutic benefit in the treatment of certain cancers such<br>
as non-small cell lung cancer.<br>
Example 55<br>
Compound 25 And Gemcitabine Combination Therapy<br>
[0478] A combination of Compound 25 and gemcitabine was administered to nude mice<br>
that were carrying tumors derived from type MiPaca2 human pancreatic cancer cells.<br>
MiaPaca-2 tumor is a highly invasive, rapidly growing tumor that results in death within 20-<br><br>
30 days in untreated animals. The tumor cells had been transfected with the gene for red<br>
fluorescent protein. Mice were administered doses of vehicle control, gemcitabine,<br>
Compound 25, Compound 24, or gemcitabine/ Compound 25 combinations or gemcitabine/<br>
Compound 24 were administered i.p., as tabulated below (8 mice/group). Compounds 24 and<br>
25 were formulated in saline and provided by Threshold Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as a dry<br>
powder. Gemcitabine was obtained commercially and prepared freshly according to<br>
manufacturer's instructions.<br><br>
[0479] Tumors were imaged once weekly until the end of the study at which time open<br>
body images were obtained to confirm effects. In Group 1, the tumors grew rapidly (Figure<br>
5) and resulted in 100% lethality by day 30 (Figure 6).<br>
[0480] Groups 3 and 4 resulted in minor effects on tumor volume and had little effect on<br>
survival. Group 2 significantly reduced tumor volume and prolonged survival. Group 6<br>
provided modest reduction in tumor size but no additional effects on survival. In contrast,<br>
Group 5 demonstrated significantly reduced tumor growth and significantly prolonged<br>
survival compared to Group 2. Five out of 8 tumors in Group 5 regressed rapidly after<br>
treatment and within a short period failed to emit fluorescence (Figure 7).<br>
[0481] Four of these tumors remained at zero fluorescence until the end of the experiment<br>
and the tumors were considered to be cured. No tumors in Group 2 were considered to be<br>
cured. These results demonstrate that combination treatment with Compound 25 and<br>
gemcitabine is of greater benefit in this model of cancer compared to monotherapy with the<br>
stand of care, gemcitabine. These results demonstrate that tumor reduction in animals<br>
administered with a combination of Compound 25 at 30 mg/mg/day and gemcitabine is<br>
significantly greater than that in animals treated with gemcitabine as a single agent.<br><br>
[0482] Using the mouse to HED conversion, Compound 25 can be administered at a<br>
therapeutically effective doses of about 2.5 mg/kg/day, for the treatment of cancer,<br>
particularly pancreatic cancer, in combination with gemcitabine.<br>
Example 56<br>
[0483] It is recognized that efficacious molecules for treatment of human diseases<br>
including cancer maybe toxic at doses near or sometime much greater than doses necessary to<br>
achieve beneficial effects. To determine appropriate dose and route of administering such a<br>
compound, it is necessary to understand its toxicity. Routinely, initial approaches to<br>
determining the toxic dose involve the use of rodents such as mice to provide preliminary<br>
data that might support the design of similar studies in larger animals and humans. Test<br>
compounds (Compounds 24,25 and 36) were tested in mice as preliminary experiments for<br>
determining doses to be used in larger animals. Compound 25_was tested at doses as high as<br>
300 mg/kg as a single dose and found to cause renal toxicities such as tubular necrosis and<br>
protein spillage into the urine. Transient reductions in white blood cells were also observed.<br>
However, little toxicity was noticed at lower doses (100 and 200 mg/kg). These doses<br>
selected represent an approximation of doses that might be used in larger animals such as rats<br>
and dogs for the purpose of confirming that such toxicities exist and for predicting if renal<br>
function should be measured in humans.<br>
