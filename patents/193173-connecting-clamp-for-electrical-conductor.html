				<td>The present invention relates to connecting clamp for an electrical conductor with at least one clamping connection consisting of a live rail, with a clamping spring, in the shape of a loop, made of springed flat material. The clamping spring has a bearing limb lying against the live rail, and also a clamping limb, bent away from the rear part of the clamping spring, extending at right angles to the live rail and a backward curved spring connecting together the rear part and the bearing limb. The clamping limb is provided with a clamping recess through which a head-end of the live rail extends in such a manner that the lower edge of the clamping-recess securely fixes an electrical conductor against the lower side of the live rail, said electrical conductor being introduced into the clamping-recess between the lower side of the live rail and the lower edge of the clamping recess.<br>
Connecting clamps of this type are known, as for example, from the patent specifications Nos. DE 37 27 091 Cl and DE 42 37 733 C1. Its overall height, measured in the direction at right angles to the direction of conductor-introduction, is determined primarily by the structural height of the live rail and the clamping spring mounted on the live rail.<br>
Moreover, the operating devices for opening the clamping device, depending on the particular type, require an additional mounting height. These structural heights get<br>
-2-<br><br>
added up, in case of connecting clamps with several clamping connections, whereby in certain applications, there occurs a problem of space.<br>
The object of the present invention is to suggest a type of construction for the clamping connections of the connecting clamps of the type as hereinbefore described, which reduces the structural height in a direction perpendicular to the conductor introduction to a great extent.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a connecting clamp for an electrical conductor with one or more clamping connections, consisting of a live rail, along with a clamping spring, having the shape of a loop, made of springed flat material, which has a bearing limb resting against the live rail, and a clamping limb bent away from the rear part of the clamping spring and extending at right angles to the live rail, and a backward curved spring connecting together the rear-part and the bearing limb, said clamping limb having a clamping recess through which a head-end of the live-rail extends in such a manner that the lower edge of the clamping-recess securely fixes an electrical conductor against the lower side of the live-rail, which electrical conductor is introduced into the clamping recess, between the lower side of the live rail and the lower edge of the clamping recess, characterized in that<br>
- 3 -<br><br>
the curved spring of the clamping spring is so shaped that starting from said rear part of the clamping spring, at least a part of its curved portion is positioned below a reference plane defined by the level of the extension of the bearing limb of the clamping spring ; and the live rail, in the region of the curved spring of the clamping spring, has a recess or trough shaped cavity in which the curved spring of the clamping spring is locatable.<br>
The invention proceeds from the fact that the curved spring of the clamping spring, requiring a considerable total height of a clamping connection, cannot be reduced, in principle, because the spring characteristic of the spring is essentially determined by the curved spring. But according to the present invention, the curved spring is shaped in such a manner that it, starting from the rear part of the clamping spring, at least with one part of its curved portion, is lowered up to the bottom of a bearing plane that is defined by the extension of the bearing limb of the clamping spring, where the live rail in the region of the curved spring of the clamping spring has a lowering or shaping trough or the like, in which the curved spring of the clamping spring is arranged in a manner, being lowered.<br><br>
-4-<br><br>
As explained in detail hereinafter, with the help of the accompanying drawings, in a preferred form of the construction, it is so provided for, that the curved spring of the clamping spring is lowered up to, underneath the bearing plane, with about half of its diameter.<br>
A further reduction of the total height of the clamping connection of the type as described before is achieved thereby that the clamping recess in the clamping limb of the clamping spring, which, with its upper and lower edges in connection with the head-end of the live rail, which head end extends itself through the clamping recess, defines the maximum stroke-movement of the clamping limb, is positioned in a manner that is different from that, which is usual, until now, in case of clamping connections of this type.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the clamping recess in the clamping limb of the clamping spring is positioned in such a manner that its upper edge is positioned directly under the rear part of the clamping spring. On account of this measure, the upper contour of the passage of the clamping limb in the rear part of the clamping spring, with maximum-opened clamping connection, is positioned nearer on the live -rail, whereby the mounting height of the clamping connection is further reduced.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the rear part of the clamping spring is essentially shaped flat, in such a manner, that it, in the open state of the clamping connection, remains near the live rail.<br>
-5-<br><br>
According to a further preferred embodiment, the bearing limb of the<br>
clamping spring, which lies against the live rail, is shaped in such a manner<br>
that it, in the open state of the clamping connection, lies on a space-saving<br>
manner, against the bottom side of the rear-part.	<br>
In the following description, a model example of construction according to this invention is explained in more details with the help of the accompanying drawings, wherein - Figure 1 shows side view of a connecting clamp with two clamping connections ;<br>
Figure 2 shows in perspective representation a clamping connection according to Figure 1.<br>
The connecting clamp 3 shown in the Figures has clamping connections which are structurally same. Each clamping connection consists of a clamping spring 4 having the shape of a loop, and a specially shaped live rail 5 (see Fig.2).<br>
The clamping spring has a bearing limb 6 resting against the live rail, a clamping limb 8 bent away from the rear part 7 of the clamping spring and extending at right angles to the live rail and a curved spring 9 connecting together the rear part 7 and the bearing limb 6 (See Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). The clamping limb 8 has a clamping recess with an upper transverse edge 10 and a lower clamping edge 11 (see Fig. 2) and the head end 12 of the live rail 5 extends through this clamping recess.<br>
-6-<br><br>
The insulating material housing of the connecting clamp as depicted in Fig. 1 has, for each clamping connection, a conductor introduction opening (see central axis 13) and an operating opening (see central axis 14). In case of open clamping connection (see the left hand side clamping connection in Fig. l), an electrical conductor (not shown) is introduced through the conductor introduction opening into the clamping position, which is formed between the bottom side of the head-end 12 of the live rail and the clamping edge 11 of the clamping recess of the clamping limb 8. The clamping edge 11 pulls the electrical conductor against the bottom side of the live rail.<br>
For opening the clamping connection, in the model example of construction as depicted, the blade of a screwdriver 15 is axially introduced into the operating opening (see central axis or line 14). Thereby, the blade-tip presses the insulating material guide lug 16 against the rear part 7 of the clamping spring, so that the blade of the screw driver moves without any problem into its thrust canal behind the rear part 7 of the clamping spring and thereby, the rear part of the clamping spring along with the clamping limb 8 is-moved into the open position of the clamping connection, which is depicted in the left hand side clamping connection in Fig. 1<br>
-7-<br><br>
According to the invention the curved spring 9 of the clamping spring is shaped in such a manner, that, it, starting from the rear part 7 of the clamping spring is lowered upto the bottom of a bearing plane defined by the extension of the bearing limb 6.<br>
In many cases, the bearing limb 6 lies in a plane parallel on the upper surface 17 of the live rail, so that the bearing plane coincides with the bearing surface 17 of the live rail. In the model example of construction as depicted, the bearing limb 6 is, however, shaped in such a manner that, it, in the open state of the clamping connection, lies against the bottom side of the rear part 7 of the clamping spring (compare for this, the left hand side clamping connection in Fig. 1).<br>
According to the present invention, the live rail is matched with the lowered curved spring 9 of the clamping spring in such a manner that the live rail 5 in the region of the curved spring 9 has a lowering or such as, the shaping trough 18, in which the curved spring of the clamping spring is arranged in a manner, being lowered. When viewed in the plane of the bearing surface 17 of the live rail, the lowering of the live rail is given by the freely cut end of the upper surface 17 of the live rail, so that the curved spring 9 behind this freely cut end is lowered into the shaping trough 18, which is available in the lateral wall 19 of the live rail.<br>
-8-<br><br>
From the representation in Fig. 1 it can be seen that the measured total height of the clamping connection in the plane of the drawing, perpendicular to the direction of the conductor introduction 13, is very small. Not only in the closed state, but also in the open state of the clamping connection, its total height is always less than the constructional dimensions, which, in any case, is necessary, for the conductor-introduction-canal (see central axis or line 13) and the screw driver-operating canal (see central axis or line 14) . This also holds good even when the conductor introduction canal and the screw-driver-operating canal are positioned extremely near one another, as depicted in Fig: 1.<br>
-9-<br><br>
