INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br>
FIELD OF TEE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a scrambling /' descrambling system and in particular, but not exclusively, relates to a scrambling / descrambling system for secure distribution and storage of digital content and data.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
By the way of introduction, a secure video processor (SVP) system is a content and data protection system for digital content distribution. The system's enforcement element is typically a standardized single-chip silicon hardware device named the secure video processor (SVP). The SVP generally employs a scrambling process for local protection of content.   .<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention, in preferred embodiments thereof, seeks to provide an improved scrambling / descrambling system for digital content, typically applicable for both streaming and non-streaming audio-visual (A/V) content as well as data.<br>
In general, devices which scramble and descramble digital content must perform both scrambling and descrambling of data. Preferably, in order to simplify hardware design and minimize hardware gate count, among other considerations, the inventors of the present invention believe that the following requirements should preferably be met in the system of the present invention:<br>
(a)	Although a large number of packets share the same Control Word (CW); and the packets cannot be "chained" due to a "zapping" requirement (in other words, to be able to begin descrambling at a random packet), an attacker needs to be prevented from detecting that an area of two different packets contains the same information, as data packets may carry sensitive information in patterned locations within the packet. Although the goal of the above point could be achieved by moving sensitive data to different locations in different packets, it is preferable to find a solution the above problem "without having to create new signaling mechanisms for signaling the location of the sensitive data within each packet for the application using the data. The above point is typically. more important for data security and less important for A/V security.<br>
(b)	The scrambling / descrambling Key is changed much less often than packets arrive; therefore, many packets are scrambled with the same Key.<br>
(c)	Packet scrambling and descrambling should both be performed in one pass.<br>
(d)	Certain bits of the packet must not be affected by scrambling and descrambling. That is, certain bits must stay "in the clear"; bits, bytes, or data that must stay in the clear are also termed herein "Must Stay Clear" or "MSC" bits, bytes or data. The reason for the requirement of certain bits being unaffected by scrambling and descrambling is in order to have some information about the<br><br><br>
stream available in the clear even before descrambling. For example, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in an MPEG-2 transport stream the first four bytes, of each packet stay hi the clear. The four first bytes provide information needed for demultiplexing, information as to whether the packet is scrambled, information as to whether the packet is scrambled with an even or odd Key (if the packet is scrambled) and other information as is well known in the art. In some packets, the header indicates that an initial part of die packet is an "adaptation field" which provides some other information necessary for the receiver; such information must stay in the clear as well. Optionally a sender may choose to send even part of video information hi the clear, for example to make search easier in personal video recorder (PVR) systems.<br>
(e)	128-bit AES should be used as the basic building block.<br>
However, it will be appreciated by those ordinarily skilled in the art that any other<br>
suitable scrambling standard may be used as the basic building block.<br>
(f)	Different types of transport streams, each defined by a "scheme"<br>
should be handled. The term "scheme" as used in the specification and claims is<br>
defined as a set of parameters (for example, but not limited to, packet length and<br>
the way of calculating the MSC part of each packet to be left unscrambled) for the<br>
content being transported. MPEG-2 is an example of a scheme which defines the<br>
parameters of the. transport stream.<br>
  (g)   The scrambling / descrambling -method should be as close as possible to a well-reviewed accepted method that has withstood the test of time.<br>
(h) An attacker should not be able to change a single bit of the plaintext by changing a single bit of the ciphertext, except for singular cases such as short solitary blocks. The above point is typically more important for data security and less important for A/V security.<br>
(i) The scrambling / descrambling system should have two modes. In a first mode, each packet must be descrambled prior to applying any change to the MSC section data as the data of the MSC section of the packet does contribute to the scrambling / descrambling function of the rest of the packet. The first mode is termed an MSC data dependent (MDD) mode. In the MDD mode, a change of<br><br><br>
data in the MSC section (Process ID (PID) or program clock reference (PCR) contained in the header or adaptation fields) of a scrambled packet generally adversely impacts descrambling, which although is desirable in some environments, in other environments, particularly in Headend applications, the MDD mode inhibits use of the scrambling / descrambling system. Therefore, in a second mode, changes to the data of the MSC section can be made to a scrambled packet as the data of MSC section does not contribute to the scrambling / descrambling function. In other words, in the second mode, the packet does not need to be descrambled in order to change the MSC section. The second mode is termed an MSC data independent (MDI) mode. In the MDI mode, a change of the data of the MSC section, for example, but not limited to, for remultiplexing, may be introduced without scrambling / descrambling the packet. In the MDD mode each packet must be descrambled prior to application of any change to the MSC section; and as such preferably necessitates special authorization. The MDD mode is particularly useful for commercial applications where it is sought to intentionally prevent, for example: remuxing of scrambled packets; splicing and insertion of scrambled packets; and changing certain fields like PCR in scrambled packets. In contrast, the MDI mode is preferably employed when commercially it is desired to have, for example, but not limited to, remuxing of scrambled streams so that changes to the MSC section can be performed on the scrambled packet; in other words, the packet does not have to be descrambled prior to changing the MSC section, for example, but not limited to, changing the PID or other MSC fields.<br>
(j) The scrambling / descrambling system should be simple to implement, and use repeated application of a few basic building blocks.<br>
(k) The scrambling / descrambling system should be robust even for data packets with some regular patterns and the system should limit the possibility of identifying ciphertext patterns.<br>
The above requirements led the inventors to choose AES CBC with Ciphertext Stealing (CTS) as a preferred basic building block of the scrambling / descrambling system of the present invention. However, it will be appreciated by<br><br><br>
those ordinarily skilled in the art that any other suitable scrambling can be used as a basic building block of the scrambling / descrambling system.<br>
The present invention, in preferred embodiments thereof, performs scrambling / descrambling of a packet based on an Initial Value (IV) which is a function of: at least some of the data of the MSC section of the packet; and/or a data independent characteristic (such as length) of the packet; and/or a data independent characteristic (such as length) of the MSC section or the adaptation field of the packet being processed.<br>
The system of the present invention, in preferred embodiments thereof, includes a content protection system for a digital content distribution system for scrambling and/or descrambling packets. Each of the packets typically has a must stay clear (MSC) section generally used for packet management such as routing and demultiplexing. The MSC section is always kept in the clear (in other words, the MSC section is never scrambled).<br>
The system typically includes a scrambling / descrambling device, or emulation thereof, typically adapted to scramble and/or descramble the packets typically based on an Initial Value and a Control Word. The term "Control Word (CW)" as used in the specification and claims refers to the cryptographic Key, or "Key" that controls the scrambling / descrambling of the A/V content and/or data. Additionally, the terms "scrambling" and "encrypting" as used in the specification' and claims are synonymous, in all grammatical forms thereof. Similarly, the terms "descrambling" and "decrypting" as used in the specification and claims are synonymous, in all grammatical forms thereof. In accordance with a most preferred embodiment of the present invention, the Initial Value used for scrambling / descrambling each packet hi the MDI mode is a function of a data independent characteristic of the packet being processed, and in particular the MSC section of the packet being processed, for example, but not limited to, the length of the packet and/or the length of the MSC section.<br>
In the MDD mode, the Initial Value for each packet is a function of the data of the MSC (the actual bits of the MSC) of the packet being scrambled and/or  descrambled.   Therefore,  the  MDD   mode  is  particularly useful  for<br><br><br>
applications which require limiting unauthorized manipulations of a scrambled stream. Unauthorized manipulations include, for example, remultiplexing, combining scrambled single program transport streams into a multiple program transport stream, or changing specific MSC parameters in the scrambled stream. Preferably, the Initial Value for each of tire packets is a function of a set of data of the MSC section, the set of data excluding one or more bits of the MSC section. In other words, certain bits of the MSC section are masked from being used for the Initial Value. The exclusion or masking is typically defined based upon the location of predetermined bits of the MSC or in accordance with the scheme of the transport stream, for example, but not limited to, the MPEG-2 scheme. For example, the bit(s) to be excluded are known through specification of the type of fields to be excluded, and parsing the actual data in the MSC in order to locate the desired fields.<br>
There is thus provided in accordance with a preferred embodiment of tire present invention a system for scrambling / descrambling packets of a stream of content, each of the. packets having a must stay clear (MSC) section which is always kept in the clear, the system including an input handler including a receiving module to receive the stream, a characteristic analyzer to analyze the stream in order to determine at least one data independent characteristic of each of the packets, and a scrambling / descrambling device operationally associated with the input handler, the scrambling / descrambling device including a receiving module to receive the at least one data independent characteristic for each of the packets from the input handler, and an Initial Value module to determine an Initial Value for each of the packets as a function of the at least one data independent" characteristic of one of the packets being processed, wherein the scrambling / descrambling device is adapted to at least one of scramble and descramble the packets based on the Initial Value and a Control Word.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The present invention, in preferred embodiments thereof, seeks to provide an improved scrambling / descrambling system for a digital content protection system. The term "content" is defined herein to include, but is not limited to, audio and/or video and/or data content.<br>
The requirements listed in the background section led the inventors to choose AES CBC with Ciphertext Stealing (CTS) as a preferred basic building block of the scrambling / descrambling system of the present invention. Therefore, the system of the present invention is generally described with reference to AES CBC. However, it will be appreciated by those ordinarily skilled in the art that any other suitable scrambling can be used as a basic building block of the scrambling / descrambling system.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 1 to 4. Fig. 1 is a simplified block diagram of a system 10 constructed and operative in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 2 is a simplified block diagram of a preferred implementation of an input handler 12 of the system 10 of Fig. 1. Fig. 3 is a simplified block diagram of a preferred implementation of a scrambling / descrambling device 14 of the system 10 of Fig. 1. Fig. 4 is a simplified flow chart illustrating a preferred method of operation of the system 10 of Fig. 1. The system 10 is preferably adapted to scramble/descramble packets of a stream of content T6. The system 10 typically includes the input handler 12, the scrambling/ descrambling device 14 and a secure interface 18. The secure interface 18 preferably interfaces between the input handler 12 and the scrambling/ descrambling device 14. The stream 16 is generally inputted to both the input handler 12 and the scrambling / descrambling device 14. The term "secure". as used in the specification and claims is defined as tamper resistant such that the data flowing between the input handler 12 and the scrambling/descrambling device 14 is tamper resistant against modification by a hacker.<br>
. Reference is now made to Fig. 5, which is a simplified view of an unscrambled packet 20 and a scrambled packet 22 of the stream 16 processed by the system 10 of Fig. 1. The unscrambled packet 20 typically includes an MSC<br><br><br>
section 24 and a payload 26. The unscrambled packet 20 and the scrambled packet 22 have a packet length 30. The. MSC section 24 also generally has a length 32. The MSC section 24 is always kept in the clear-. In other words, the MSC section 24 is never sent or stored scrambled so even in the scrambled packet 22, the MSC section 24 is "in the clear". The MSC section 24 typically includes an adaptation field 28, which is also always kept in the clear. The MSC section 24 typically includes a header (a number of bytes at the beginning) of tire packet 20, 22 that must stay clear. By way of example, an MPEG-2 packet has a packet length of 188 bytes and an MSC section of 4 bytes plus optional adaptation fields.<br>
Reference is again made to Figs. 1 to 4 in addition to Fig. 5. The input handler 12 is typically part of the SVP transport engine. The input handler 12 preferably includes a receiving module 34 to receive the stream 16 (block 38). The input handler 12 is also typically adapted to receive a signal 36, informing the input handler 12 of the scheme of the stream 16, so that the input handler 12 operates in accordance with tire signaled scheme (block 40), for example, but not limited to, determining a data mark 48, as will be described below in more detail.<br>
The input handler 12 also preferably includes an MSC parser 42, a characteristic analyzer 44, a scheme analyzer 45, an adaptation field manager 47, and a mask module 46.<br>
The MSC parser 42 is preferably adapted to parse the packet 20, 22 in order to identify the MSC section 24 and, if necessary, the adaptation field 28 (block 54). The packet 20, 22 .typically includes one or more bytes (depending on the transport scheme) indicating the location and size of the MSC section 24.<br>
The characteristic analyzer 44 is preferably adapted to analyze the stream 16 in order to determine one or more data independent characteristics 60 of: each of the packets 20, 22; and/or the MSC sections 24 of each of the packets 20, 22; and/or the adaptation fields 28 of each of the MSC sections 24 (block 56). The term "data independent characteristic" used in the specification and claims is defined as a factor which is independent of the data values of the packet 20, 22 (including the MSC section 24 and the adaptation field 28). The data independent characteristics 60 include any suitable data independent characteristic for example,<br><br><br>
but not limited to, the length 30 of the packet 20, 22, and/or the length 32 of the MSC section 24, and/or the length of the adaptation field 28. If the signal 36 is not used, the scheme analyzer 45 preferably determines the scheme- of the stream 16 based on the data form of the packets 20, 22 (block 55). The data form of the packets 20, 22 is preferably determined by the MSC parser 42 and the characteristic analyzer 44, described above. As described above, the data mask 48 is typically a function of the scheme of the stream 16.<br>
For scrambling, for example, but not limited to, when the system 10 is part of a broadcasting Headend or content sourcing device, the adaptation field manager 47 preferably creates an artificial adaptation field in at least some of the packets 20 (if an adaptation field did not exist) or artificially enlarges the existing adaptation field 28 of at least some of the packets (block 57) such that the length of the adaptation field of the packets 20, and therefore the length 32 of the MSC section 24, is selectable. The reason for artificially creating/enlarging the adaptation field 28 is to introduce entropy into the Initial Values of the packets 20, as will be explained below in more detail with reference to the scrambling/descrambling device 14.<br>
The mask module 46 is preferably adapted to create, for each of the packets 20, 22, the data mask 48, which typically includes all data of the MSC section 24 except for one or more bits of data of the MSC section 24 (block 58).. Masking is described in more detail below with reference to the scrambling. / descrambling device 14 while operating in the MDD mode. As described above, the data mask 48 is typically a function of the scheme of the stream 16.<br>
The scrambling / descrambling device 14 is generally operationally associated with the input handler 12 via the secure interface 18. The input handler 12, the scrambling / descrambling device 14 and the secure interface 18 are preferably adapted to be tamper resistant against modification of the MSC section 24 on the scrambling side that leaves the whole packet 20 left in the clear. For example, a hacker may try to amend the length 32 of the MSC section 24 so that the length 32- of tire MSC section 24 is the length 30 of the packet 20, thereby<br><br><br>
leaving the whole packet 20 in the clear even after scrambling, as the MSC section 24 is now the whole packet.<br>
The scrambling / descrambling device 14 preferably performs the scrambling / descrambling function of the system 10. The scrambling / descrambling device 14 generally has sub modules including a receiving module 50, an Initial Value module 52 and a mode multiplexer 78.<br>
The receiving module 50 is preferably adapted to receive the data independent characteristics 60, the data mask 48, the MSC section 24, and the packet length 30, for each of the packets 20, 22, from the input handler 12 (block 66). The packet length 30, in bytes, generally needs to be known by the scrambling / descrambling device 14 for initialization of the scrambling / descrambling process. It should be noted that certain schemes, for example, but not limited to, the MPEG-2 scheme, the packet length 30 is constant for all of the packets 20, 22. However, it will be appreciated by those ordinarily skilled in the art that other schemes may have non-constant packet lengths, for example, but not limited to, Internet Protocol packets.<br>
Another input to the scrambling / descrambling device 14 typically includes a plurality of Control Words 62. Each of the Control Words 62 is typically shared by a group of the packets 20, 22.<br>
A mode of operation 64 of the system 10 is also an. input to the scrambling / descrambling device 14 for use by the mode multiplexer 78. The mode of operation 64 is generally used to change a mode control flag (not shown) which instructs the mode multiplexer 78 of the scrambling / descrambling device 14 to operate in the MDI mode or the MDD mode. The mode control flag is preferably activated in a secure manner provided by the overall Content Protection System so that, for example, if the system is currently operating in the MDD mode then hackers are prevented from changing the operation of the system 10 to the MDI mode. By way of a first example, the mode control flag is activated in a secure manner by specifying the required mode in a cryptographically protected content-specific control datagram and delivering the datagram to the scrambling/descrambling device 14. By way of a second example, the mode<br><br><br>
control flag is activated in a secure manner by an SVP control block securely passing the required mode along with the control word to the scrambling/descrambling device 14.<br>
In additional to Figs. 1 to 5, reference is now also made to Fig. 6, which is a simplified view of an Initial Value 70 for use in the system of Fig. 1.<br>
An additional, optional, input to the scrambling / descrambling device 14 is an MSC override 68 input. If die MSC override 68 input is equal to one, the scrambling / descrambling device 14 typically disregards the MSC section 24 received from the input handler 12 and forces the length 32 of the MSC section 24 to zero, both for use in calculating the Initial Value 70 and in the actual portion of the packet 20 being scrambled so that the whole packet 20 is scrambled. The MSC override feature is preferably not used with the MPEG-2 scheme.<br>
Li the MDI mode, the Initial Value module 52 is preferably adapted to determine the Initial Value 70 for each of the packets 20, 22 as a function of the data independent characteristics 60 of: the packet 20, 22 being processed; and/or the MSC section 24 of the packet 20, 22 being processed; and/or the adaptation field 28 of the MSC section 24 of the packet 20, 22 being processed (block 74). In scrambling, when the initial value 70 is determined as a function of the length of the adaptation field 28 and/or the length 32 of the MSC section 24, entropy is introduced into the initial value 70 by artificially changing the length of the adaptation field 28 of at least some of the packets 20 by the adaptation field manager 47, as described above. The scrambling / descrambling device 14 is preferably adapted to scramble/descramble the. packets 20, 22 of the stream 16 based on the Initial Values 70 and the Control Words 62 of the packets 20, 22 thereby producing an output stream 72 (block 76).<br>
It should be noted that when entropy is introduced into the initial values 70 by artificially manipulating the adaptation fields of the packets 20, the application which extracts the payload 26 from the packets 20 automatically extracts the payload 26 (excluding the MSC section 24) from the packet 22 as defined by the transport scheme (for example, but not limited to, MPEG-2). In other words, the application which extracts the payload does not need to be<br><br><br>
amended in order to handle initial value entropy created by the system of the present invention.<br>
In the MDD mode, the Initial Value module 52 is preferably adapted to determine the Initial Value 70 for each of the packets 20, 22 as a function of the data mask 48 of the packet 20,22 being processed, such that the Initial Value 70 is not a function of the one or more bits of data of the MSC section 24 excluded by the data mask 48 of the packet 20, 22 being processed (block 74). In other words, masking is a way to eliminate portions of the MSC section 24 from being used in forming the Initial Value 70. However, it should be noted that the whole MSC section 24, even including the portions masked out by the data mask 48, is preferably included in the output stream 72.<br>
Therefore, masking typically allows designating bits in the MSC section 24 that may be modified without requiring re-scrambling while in the MDD mode.<br>
The bit(s) excluded by the data mask 48 are preferably location dependent, such that the masking is typically performed based upon the location of predetermined bit(s) of the MSC section 24 or in accordance with the scheme of the transport stream, e.g. MPEG-2 scheme. By way of a non-limiting example, the bit(s) to be excluded are determined by specifying the type of fields to be excluded, and parsing the actual data in the MSC section 24 in order to locate the desired field type.<br>
In the MPEG-2 scheme, the first bit of the second byte of the MSC section 24 is typically a transport error indicator, which may change during transport of the packet 20, 22 depending on the transport status. Therefore, it is preferable to mask the first bit of the second byte from being used in the "Initial Value 70 when using the MPEG-2 scheme.<br>
As described above, the data mask 48 is typically a function of the scheme of the stream 16. Additionally, the initial values 70 used in scrambling/descrambling the packets 20, 22 are typically a function of the data mask 48 in the MDD mode. Therefore, in the MDD mode, the initial values 70 and<br><br><br>
also  the  scrambling/descrambling  of the packets  20,  22  by  scrambling  / descrambling device 14 is typically a function of the scheme of the stream 16.<br>
In accordance with a first alternative preferred embodiment of the present invention, in the MDD mode, the Initial Value module 52 is adapted to determine the Initial Value 70 for each of the packets 20, 22 as a function of the data independent characteristics. 60 as well as the data content of the MSC section 24, wherein none of the data content of the MSC section 24 is explicitly excluded from being used in the Initial Value 70.<br>
In accordance with a second alternative preferred embodiment of the present invention, in the MDD mode, the Initial Value module 52 is adapted to determine the Initial Value 70 for each of the packets 20, 22 as a function of the data independent characteristics 60 and the data mask 48 of the packet 20, 22 being processed.<br>
The system 10 is typically implemented by a silicon vendor as part of an SVP chip content-processing component, with Control Words being supplied by an SVP Kernel.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 6, which is a simplified view of a preferred example of the Initial Value 70 for use in the system 10 of Fig. 1. The Initial Value 70 is based on the packet length 30 (in the most significant 64 bits of the Initial Value 70) and the length 32 of the MSC section 24 (in the least significant 64 bits of the Initial Value 70). For MPEG-2, both the packet length 30 • and the length 32 of the MSC section 24 are typically one byte each. Therefore, for MPEG-2 typically only two bytes of the Initial Value 70 are non-zero. In Fig. 6, MSB denotes "most significant bits" and LSB denotes "least significant bits".<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 7 to 12. Fig. 7 is a flow chart of a preferred pure CBC scrambling process for use with the system 10 of Fig. 1. Fig. 8 is a flow chart of a preferred CBC with ciphertext stealing scrambling process for use with the system 10 of Fig. 1. Fig. 9 is a flow chart of a preferred short solitary block scrambling process for use with the system 10 of Fig. 1. Fig. 10 is a flow chart of a preferred pure CBC descrambling process for use with the system 10 of<br><br><br>
Fig. 1. Fig. 11 is a flow chart of a preferred CBC with ciphertext stealing descrambling process for use with the system 10 of Fig. 1. Fig. 12 is a flow chart of a preferred short solitary block descrambling process for use with the system 10 of Fig. 1.<br>
The following values and notations are used with reference to Figs. 7 to 12:<br>
"MSC" is the data content of the MSC section;<br>
"MSClength" is the length of the MSC section;<br>
"Mask" is the data mask;<br>
"E" is a standard AES cipher encryption of a 16-byte block using a given 16-byte key CW;<br>
"D" is a standard AES cipher decryption of a 16-byte block using a given 16-byte key CW;<br>
"XOR" is the bitwise XOR operator;<br>
"P" is plaintext;<br>
"C" is ciphertext;<br>
Array indices start from 0 to m for MSC and Mask, and to n for P and C;<br>
"F(MSC, Packet Length)" is a 16 byte Initial Value (TV), see Figure 6.<br>
In- tire MDD mode, the CBC-MAC (MAC being the Message Authentication Code) of the MSC section 24 is preferably used as the Initial Value 70 for the first CBC scrambling / descrambling stage, instead of the classic "fixed IV".<br>
In the MDI mode, the Initial Value 70 for the first CBC scrambling / descrambling stage is preferably a function of the data independent characteristics 60 of the packet 20, 22 and/or the MSC section 24 and/or the adaptation field 28 of the packet 20, 22 being processed.<br><br><br>
For consistency, the scrambling function E used in the MDD mode and the MDI mode is preferably the same. Similarly, the descrambling function D used in the MDD mode and the MDI mode is preferably the same.<br>
An output 80 of the mode multiplexer 78, for the packet 20, 22 being processed, is the Initial Value 70 for the same packet 20, 22 to be scrambled / descrambled.<br>
It will be understood mat the system 10 according to the present invention may be a. suitably programmed processor. Likewise, the invention contemplates software being readable by a processor for executing the method of tire invention. The invention further contemplates a machine-readable memory tangibly embodying a program of instructions executable by the machine for executing the method of the invention.<br>
It will be appreciated mat various features of the invention which are, for clarity, described in the contexts of separate embodiments may also be provided in combination in a single embodiment. Conversely, various features of the invention which are, for brevity, described in the context of a single embodiment may also be provided separately or in any suitable sub-combination.<br>
