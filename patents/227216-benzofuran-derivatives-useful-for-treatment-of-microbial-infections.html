Novel Benzofuran Derivatives<br>
The present invention relates to novel 2,4-diamino-5-(substituted) pyrimidines, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them, to processes for preparing them and their compositions, to intermediates for making them and to their use in the treatment of microbial infections.<br>
Certain 2,4-diamino-5-benzylpyrimidines have been demonstrated to be potent inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), which catalyses the reduction of dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid (THFA). This property has been shown to result frequently in useful pharmaceutical properties particularly in the treatment of bacterial infections. Thus, U.K. Patent Specification No. 875,562 discloses inter alia 2,4-diamino-5-benzylpyrimidines wherein the benzyl moiety is substituted by three C^ alkoxy groups.<br>
Trimethoprim, 2,4-diamino-5-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl)pyrimidine, is specifically disclosed in U.K. Patent No. 875, 562 and is the most active antibacterial agent amongst the 2,4-diamino-5-benzylpyrimidines known to date. Due to their mode of action, these benzylpyrimidines potentiate the antibacterial activity of the sulphonamides, and Trimethoprim has been used extensively over the last decade in human therapy in combination with various sulphonamides, and in particular with sulphamethoxazole, for the treatment of bacterial infections.<br>
European Patent Applications Nos. 81109631.2 and 83104240.3 disclose inter alia also such type of compounds and their use.<br>
In WO 02/10157 similar compounds are described. However, the compounds disclosed hereinafter exhibit a much more potent activity against DHFR including mutated enzyme, a superior bioavailability, and a superior antibacterial activity.<br>
It has now been found that a group of novel benzofuran derivatives are more potent than, e. g.,Trimethoprim, and are active against Gram positive pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis or Streptococcus pneumoniae) and Gram negative pathogens (Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella Cattharalis or Proteus vulgaris). Furthermore, and as mentioned above, the compounds of formula I show a much<br><br>
more   potent   activity   against   DHFR   including   mutated   enzyme,   a   superior bioavailability, and a superior antibacterial activity.<br>
Therefore, the present invention relates to novel compounds of the general formula I<br>
wherein<br>
R1 represents the groups <br>
whereby in these groups R5 is hydrogen, lower alkyl with 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or the group <br>
R8 represents lower alkyloxy, lower alkylamino, or lower alkyl with 1 to 4 carbon<br>

R9 represents lower alkyl with 1 to 4 carbon atoms;<br>
R8 and R9 together form a 5- or 6- membered heterocyclic ring containing one to two<br>
hetero atoms which can be the same or different and are oxygen or nitrogen.<br><br>
R6 represent hydrogen, halogen, nitro, or lower alkyloxy;<br>
R7 represents hydrogen;<br>
R2 and R3 independently represent hydrogen, lower alkyl with 1 to 3 carbon atoms, or together a lower alkylene group with 1 to 3 carbon atoms bridging the oxygen atoms and forming a five, six or seven membered ring;<br>
R4 represents hydrogen;<br>
and pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts thereof.<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds of the general formula r<br>
wherein<br>

R9 represents lower alkyl with 1 to 4 carbon atoms;<br>
R8 and R9 together form a 5- or 6- memberecl heterocyclic ring containing one to two<br>
hetero atoms which can be the same or different and are oxygen or nitrogen.<br>
R6 represent hydrogen, halogen, nitro, or lower alkyloxy;<br>
R7 represents hydrogen;<br>
R2 and R3 independently represent hydrogen, lower alkyl with 1 to 3 carbon atoms, or together a lower alkylene group with 1 to 3 carbon atoms bridging the oxygen atoms and forming a five, six or seven membered ring;<br>
R4 represents hydrogen;<br>
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>

Examples of lower alkyl and groups are methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec- butyl, tert.-butyl.

The expression heterocyclic ring represents saturated and unsaturated, but not aromatic, five- or six-membered rings containing one to two hetero atoms which may be the same or different and are nitrogen or oxygen atoms. Examples are piperidinyl, morpholinyl, piperazinyl, pyrrolidinyl, dihydroimidazolyl, dihydropyrazoyl, pyrazolidinyl or dihydroxazolinyl.<br>

General procedure C: Coupling of the indols with compound V (Scheme 1)<br>
To a suspension of VI (6.0 eq) in tetrahydrofurane freshly distilled, a 4.2M-solution of ethyl magnesium bromide in diethyl ether (6.0 eq) was added at 0°C under an argon flux.
