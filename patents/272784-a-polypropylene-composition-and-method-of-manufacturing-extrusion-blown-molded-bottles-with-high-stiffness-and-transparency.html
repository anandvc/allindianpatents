				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present inventions relates to a new polypropylene composition, its use and<br>
manufacture as well as to new articles comprising said polypropylene composition.<br>
It is well known in the polymer field that different applications require specifically<br>
tailored polymers to achieve the individual demanding properties. For instance a<br>
polymer used for injection molding must necessarily have other properties as a<br>
polymer used for blow molding.<br>
The extrusion blow molding process for instance is a very special process that allows<br>
in a flexible and cheap way the preparation of different kind of bottles with respect to<br>
size and shape. Main drawback in this process is that the solidification step is very<br>
special compared to normal injection molding.<br>
In the extrusion blow molding process a polymer melt is first extruded through a<br>
tubular die into air forming a polymer tube, subsequently blowing up said polymer<br>
tube (typically called "parison" in this technical field) until the outside of the tube<br>
reaches the boundaries of the mold. To cover the wall of the mold fully with the<br>
blown up polymer tube is rather difficult compared to injection molding because the<br>
air between polymer tube and mold has to be removed totally which is a demanding<br>
process step. Further the inside of the polymer tube is not in contact with the mold<br>
and therefore there is only little possibility to influence the inner surface structure of<br>
the tube. As a consequence thereof extrusion blown molded articles, like bottles,<br>
normally show less transparency compared to any injection molded articles or<br>
injection stretched blown molded articles (ISBM). For instance, the surface property<br>
inside and/or outside of extrusion blown bottles is typically non-uniform (flow lines,<br>
melt fracture) leading to lower overall transparency compared to injection molded<br>
bottles. A certain improvement of the transparency can be achieved by visbreaking<br>
the polymer material but this concept has quite some limitation and can only be<br>
applied for relatively small bottles since a certain level of melt strength is essential<br>
for proper processing. Accordingly bigger bottles (volume of 11 or more) are not<br>
producible with visbroken polypropylene in an extrusion blow molding process.<br>
Beside transparency also stiffness is very important for the performance of a bottle.<br>
Higher stiffness would allow reducing the wall thickness of a bottle and is also<br>
important for the filling process (no deterioration of the bottle). Moreover a better<br>
stiffness leads also to improved stackability. The stiffness of bottles is reflected by<br>
the so called top load (top load is the maximum force applied to a bottle before it<br>
starts to collapse).<br>
Further it is well known that the extruded parison tends to swell inter alia in wall<br>
thickness. Even though the swell effect is to some extent desired it should not<br>
diverge too much from known reference grades, in particular from the specific<br>
reference grade "RB307MO" of Borealis.<br>
Thus the object of the present invention is to provide a polypropylene composition<br>
which enables the preparation of bottles, in particular big sized bottles, i.e. bottles<br>
with more than 1 liter filling volume, by an extrusion blow molding process, wherein<br>
the bottles are featured by good haze, gloss and stiffness. Further it is desired that<br>
during the preparation of the bottles a weight swell occurs, which differs only little<br>
from known grades (i.e. "RB307MO" of Borealis) used in extrusion blow molding<br>
processes.<br>
The finding of the present invention is that a polypropylene must be combined with a<br>
branched polypropylene, like a Y/H-shaped polypropylene, i.e. a high melt strength<br>
polypropylene, and a further polypropylene with high melt flow rate.<br>
Accordingly the present invention is directed to a polypropylene composition<br>
comprising a random propylene copolymer (R-PP), a high melt strength<br>
polypropylene (HMS-PP), a polypropylene (B) being different to the random<br>
propylene copolymer (R-PP) at least in view of the melt flow rate MFR2 (230 °C)<br>
and a clarifier (C), wherein<br>
(a) the random propylene copolymer (R-PP) comprises units derived from<br>
propylene and at least another C2 to C20 a-olefin,<br>
(b) optionally the high melt strength polypropylene (HMS-PP) has a branching<br>
index g' of less than 1.0, preferably of 0.9 or less,<br>
(c) the polypropylene (B) has a MFR2 (230 °C) of at least 400 g/lOmin,<br>
(d) the clarifier (C) comprises at least one a-nucleating agent (N), and<br>
(e) the polypropylene composition has a MFR2 (230 °C) of at least 2.0 g/lOmin.<br>
Thus in a specific embodiment the polypropylene composition according to this<br>
invention comprises a random propylene copolymer (R-PP), a high melt strength<br>
polypropylene (HMS-PP), a polypropylene (B), and a clarifier (C), wherein<br>
(a) the random propylene copolymer (R-PP) comprises units derived from<br>
propylene and at least another C2 to C20 a-olefin, and additionally<br>
(i) has a higher branching index g' than the high melt strength<br>
polypropylene (HMS-PP), preferably is unbranched, more preferably<br>
has a branching index g' of 1.0,<br>
and/or<br>
(ii) has a gel content below 0.15 wt.-%,<br>
<br>
(b) the high melt strength polypropylene (HMS-PP) has a branching structure,<br>
preferably has a branching index g' of less than 1.0, more preferably of 0.9 or<br>
less,<br>
(c) the polypropylene (B) has a MFR2 (230 °C) of at least 400 g/10min,<br>
(d) the clarifier (C) comprises at least one a-nucleating agent (N), and<br>
(e) the polypropylene composition has a MFR.2 (230 °C) of at least 2.0 g/lOmin,<br>
wherein further<br>
(f) the polypropylene (B) is (chemically) different to the random propylene<br>
copolymer (R-PP), preferably the polypropylene (B) is different to the<br>
random propylene copolymer (R-PP) at least in view of the melt flow rate<br>
MFR2 (230 °C), still more preferably the polypropylene (B) has a higher melt<br>
flow rate MFR2 (230 °C) than the random propylene copolymer (R-PP) and<br>
(g) optionally the polypropylene (B) is (chemically) different to high melt<br>
strength polypropylene (HMS-PP), preferably the polypropylene (B) is<br>
(chemically) different to high melt strength polypropylene (HMS-PP) at least<br>
in view of the melt flow rate MFR2 (230 °C), still more preferably the<br>
polypropylene (B) has a higher melt flow rate MFR2 (230 °C) than the high<br>
melt strength polypropylene (HMS-PP).<br>
Preferably the polypropylene compositions as defined above comprise as polymer<br>
components only the random propylene copolymer (R-PP), the polypropylene (B)<br>
and the high melt strength polypropylene (HMS-PP) as defined above and in further<br>
detail below.<br>
It has been surprisingly found out that such a polypropylene composition has<br>
superior properties compared to known polypropylene compositions, in particular to<br>
those used for extrusion blown molding processes. The polypropylene composition<br>
of the present invention enables in particular to produce extrusion blown bottles with<br>
low haze, exceptional good gloss and stiffness in terms of high top load. Further it<br>
has been observed that the weight swell does not differ from commercial products<br>
(see table 1).<br>
In the following the present invention is described in more detail.<br>
One essential requirement of the inventive polypropylene composition is its<br>
increased melt flow rate. The melt flow rate mainly depends on the average<br>
molecular weight. This is due to the fact that long molecules render the material a<br>
lower flow tendency than short molecules. An increase in molecular weight means a<br>
decrease in the MFR-value. The melt flow rate (MFR) is measured in g/10 min of the<br>
polymer discharged through a defined die under specified temperature and pressure<br>
conditions and the measure of viscosity of the polymer which, in turn, for each type<br>
of polymer is mainly influenced by its molecular weight but also by its degree of<br>
branching. The melt flow rate measured under a load of 2.16 kg at 230 °C<br>
(ISO 1133) is denoted as MFR2 (230 °C). Accordingly, it is preferred that the<br>
inventive polypropylene composition has an MFR2 (230 °C) of at least 2.0 g/10min,<br>
more preferably of at least 2.2 g/lOmin. Accordingly it is in particular appreciated<br>
that the inventive polypropylene composition has a MFR2 (230 °C) in the range of<br>
2.0 to 4.5 g/10 min, more preferably of 2.1 to 3.8 g/10 min, still more preferably of<br>
2.2 to 3.5 g/10 min.<br>
Further, as stated above the new polypropylene composition must comprise a high<br>
melt strength polypropylene (HMS-PP). Such polymer types improve the melt<br>
strength of the polypropylene composition. Accordingly it is preferred that the<br>
polypropylene composition is further characterized by a strain hardening behavior<br>
with a haul-off force Fmax of at least 7.0 cN and a draw down velocity vmax of at least<br>
<br>
180 mm/s, more preferably by a strain hardening behavior with a haul-off force Fmax<br>
of at least 7.5 cN and a draw down velocity vmax of at least 185 mm/s.<br>
Further the polypropylene composition can be additionally defined by the gel<br>
content. The gel content is a good indicator for the chemical modification of the<br>
polypropylene composition or its components. Accordingly the present invention is<br>
featured by relatively moderate gel content, i.e. of not more than 1.00 wt.-%, even<br>
more preferred of not more than 0.80 wt.-%, still more preferred of not more than<br>
0.50 wt.-% determined as the relative amount of polymer insoluble in boiling xylene<br>
(xylene hot insoluble fraction, XHI). On the other hand the polypropylene<br>
composition must comprise a certain amount of high melt strength polypropylene<br>
(HMS-PP). Accordingly the amount of gel content in the polypropylene composition<br>
is preferably more than 0.15 wt.-%, more preferably of at least 0.27 wt.-%. Thus a<br>
preferred range for the gel content of the polypropylene composition is 0.05 to<br>
0.90 wt.-%, like 0.15 to 0.90 wt.-%, more preferred 0.26 to 0.8 wt.-%.<br>
Further it is appreciated that the polypropylene composition is free of any<br>
elastomeric polymer component, like an ethylene propylene rubber. In other words<br>
the polypropylene composition shall be not a heterophasic polypropylene<br>
composition, i.e. a system consisting of a polypropylene matrix in which an<br>
elastomeric phase is dispersed. Such systems are featured by a rather high xylene<br>
cold soluble content. Accordingly, the present polypropylene composition differs<br>
from such a heterophasic system by a rather low xylene cold soluble (XCS) content.<br>
Therefore the polypropylene composition has preferably a xylene cold soluble<br>
fraction (XCS) of not more than 15.0 wt-%, more preferably of not more than 14.0<br>
wt.-%, yet more preferably of not more than 12.0 wt.-%, like not more than 11.5 wt.-<br>
%.<br>
<br>
Further the polypropylene composition can be specified by the amount of<br>
comonomer units other than propylene within the polypropylene composition.<br>
Accordingly it is appreciated that the amount of units derived from d to C20 <x-></x->
olefins other than propylene is not more than 7.0 wt.-%, preferably not more than 6.0<br>
wt.-%, like not more than 5.5 wt.-%, in the polypropylene composition.<br>
In the following the present polypropylene composition is further defined by the<br>
polymer components within the composition.<br>
The random propylene copolymer (R-PP) comprises units derived from propylene<br>
and at least another C2 to C20 a-olefin, preferably at least another C2 to C10 a-olefin.<br>
Accordingly the random propylene copolymer (R-PP) comprises units derived from<br>
propylene and at least another a-olefin selected from the group consisting of ethylene<br>
C4 a-olefin, C5 a-olefin, C6 a-olefin, C7 a-olefin, C8 a-olefin, C9 a-olefin and C10 a-<br>
olefin. More preferably the random propylene copolymer (R-PP) comprises units<br>
derived from propylene and at least another a-olefin selected from the group<br>
consisting of ethylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, l-hexene, 1-heptene, 1-octene, 1-nonene<br>
and 1-decene, wherein ethylene, 1-butene and l-hexene are preferred. It is in<br>
particular preferred that the random propylene copolymer (R-PP) consists of units<br>
derived from propylene and ethylene. The amount of units derived from C2 to C20 ot-<br>
olefins other than propylene in the random propylene copolymer (R-PP) is in the<br>
range of 1.0 to 7.0 wt.-%, more preferably 1.5 to 6.0 wt.-%, still more preferably 2.0<br>
to 5.5 wt.-%.<br>
Preferably the random propylene copolymer (R-PP) is isotactic. Accordingly it is<br>
appreciated that the random propylene copolymer (R-PP) has a rather high pentad<br>
concentration, i.e. higher than 90 %, more preferably higher than 92 %, still more<br>
<br>
preferably higher than 93 % and yet more preferably higher than 95 %, like higher<br>
than 99 %.<br>
One requirement in the present invention is that units derived from C2 to C20 a-<br>
olefins other than propylene within the propylene copolymer (R-PP) are randomly<br>
distributed. The Randomness indicates the amount of isolated comonomer units, i.e.<br>
those which have no other comonomer units in the neighbour, compared to the total<br>
amount of comonomers in the polymer chain. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
randomness of the random propylene copolymer (R-PP) is at least 30 %, more<br>
preferably at least 50 %, even more preferably at least 60 %, and still more<br>
preferably at least 65 %.<br>
Further it is appreciated that the xylene soluble content of the random propylene<br>
copolymer (R-PP) is a rather low. Accordingly the random propylene copolymer (R-<br>
PP) has preferably a xylene cold soluble fraction (XCS) measured according to ISO<br>
6427 (23 °C) of not more than 14.0 wt-%, more preferably of not more than 13.0 wt.-<br>
%, yet more preferably of not more than 12.0 wt.-%, like not more thanl 1.5 wt.-%.<br>
Thus a preferred range is 1.0 to 14.0 wt.-%, more preferred 1.0 to 13.0 wt.-%, still<br>
more preferred 1.2 to 11.0 wt.-%.<br>
The random propylene copolymer (R-PP) can be unimodal or multimodal, like<br>
bimodal in view of the molecular weight distribution and/or the comonomer content<br>
distribution.<br>
When the random propylene copolymer (R-PP) is unimodal with respect to the<br>
molecular weight distribution and/or comonomer content, it may be prepared in a<br>
single stage process e.g. as slurry or gas phase process in a slurry or gas phase<br>
reactor. Preferably, the unimodal the random propylene copolymer (R-PP) is<br>
polymerized as a slurry polymerization. Alternatively, the unimodal the random<br>
propylene copolymer (R-PP) may be produced in a multistage process using at each<br>
stage process conditions which result in similar polymer properties.<br>
The expression "multimodal" or "bimodal" used herein refers to the modality of the<br>
polymer, i.e.<br>
¦ the form of its molecular weight distribution curve, which is the graph of the<br>
molecular weight fraction as a function of its molecular weight,<br>
or more preferably<br>
¦ the form of its comonomer content distribution curve, which is the graph of<br>
the comonomer content as a function of the molecular weight of the polymer<br>
fractions.<br>
As will be explained below, the polymer components of the the random propylene<br>
copolymer (R-PP) can be produced in a sequential step process, using reactors in<br>
serial configuration and operating at different reaction conditions. As a consequence,<br>
each fraction prepared in a specific reactor will have its own molecular weight<br>
distribution and/or comonomer content distribution.<br>
When the distribution curves (molecular weight or comonomer content) from these<br>
fractions are superimposed to obtain the molecular weight distribution curve or the<br>
comonomer content distribution curve of the final polymer, these curves may show<br>
two or more maxima or at least be distinctly broadened when compared with curves<br>
for the individual fractions. Such a polymer, produced in two or more serial steps, is<br>
called bimodal or multimodal, depending on the number of steps.<br>
Accordingly the random propylene copolymer (R-PP) may be multimodal, like<br>
bimodal, in view of the comonomer content and/or molecular weight. It is in<br>
particular appreciated that the the random propylene copolymer (R-PP) is<br>
multimodal, like bimodal, in view of the comonomer content.<br>
Further in case the random propylene copolymer (R-PP) is of multimodal, like<br>
bimodal, character, in particular multimodal, like bimodal, in view of the comonomer<br>
content, it is appreciated that the individual fractions are present in amounts<br>
influencing the properties of the material. Accordingly it is appreciated that each of<br>
these fractions is at least present in the amount of 10 wt.-% based on the random<br>
propylene copolymer (R-PP). Accordingly in case of a bimodal system, in particular<br>
in view of the comonomer content, the split of the two fractions is roughly 50 : 50.<br>
Thus in one embodiment the random propylene copolymer (R-PP) comprises two<br>
fractions which differ in their comonomer content, like ethylene content (preferably<br>
as the only comonomer in the random propylene copolymer (R-PP)), wherein the<br>
first fraction is present from 40 to 60 wt.-% and the second fraction from 60 to 40<br>
wt.-%. In such a case the random propylene copolymer (R-PP) comprises at least two<br>
fractions, more preferably consists of two fractions, that have a comonomer content,<br>
like ethylene content, which differ of at least 2.0 wt.-%, more preferably differ of at<br>
least 2.5 wt.-%. On the other hand the difference in the comonomer content in the<br>
two fractions should be not too high, i.e. not higher than 6.0 wt.-%, preferably not<br>
higher than 5.0 wt%, to avoid any separation tendencies. Thus it is appreciated that<br>
the random propylene copolymer (R-PP) comprises at least two fractions, more<br>
preferably consists of two fractions, that have comonomer contents which differ of<br>
2.0 to 6.0 wt.-%, more preferably of 2.5 to 5.0 wt.-%. Accordingly in one<br>
embodiment the random propylene copolymer (R-PP) consists of a first fraction<br>
being a propylene homopolymer and a second fraction being a propylene copolymer<br>
having a comonomer content, preferably ethylene content, of at least 2.0 wt.-%, more<br>
preferably of at least 3.0 wt.-%, like at least 3.5 wt.-%.<br>
As comes already appereant from the wording used in the instant invention the<br>
random propylene copolymers (R-PP) is not only chemically different to the<br>
propylene (B) but different to the high melt strenght polypropylene (HMS-PP). One<br>
essential difference is that the random propylene copolymers (R-PP) (compared to<br>
the high melt strenght polypropylene (HMS-PP)) is unbranched. In other words the<br>
random propylene copolymers (R-PP) has preferably a branching index g' of 1.0. A<br>
further distingushing feature between the high melt strenght polypropylene (HMS-<br>
PP) and the the random propylene copolymers (R-PP) is preferably the gel content<br>
expressed in the amount of the xylene hot insoluble fraction (XHI). Accordingly the<br>
random propylene copolymers (R-PP) has a gel content below 0.15 wt.-%, more<br>
preferably has no detectable gel content.<br>
In particular suitable random propylene copolymers (R-PP) are those as for instance<br>
described in EP 1 580 207 Al and WO 2003/002639 Al.<br>
As stated above, the inventive polypropylene composition must at least comprise - as<br>
polymer components - a random propylene copolymer (R-PP), a polypropylene (B)<br>
and a high melt strength polypropylene (HMS-PP). The three components must be<br>
chosen in such a way that in particular the required MFR2 (230 °C) of at least 2.0<br>
g/10min for the final polypropylene composition is met. In principle visbreaking is<br>
an option to increase the melt flow rate of the polypropylene composition. However<br>
even though it has been discovered that visbreaking of a polypropylene composition<br>
may improve the haze and gloss of the extrusion blown molded articles, it has been<br>
now surprisingly found out that the increase of the melt flow rate by the<br>
incorporation of a viscous polypropylene, i.e. polypropylene (B), leads to much<br>
better properties. Without be bonded to the theory, it is believed that the addition of a<br>
polypropylene with rather high melt flow rate to a mixture of non-visbroken random<br>
<br>
propylene copolymer (R-PP) and a high melt strength polypropylene (HMS-PP)<br>
leads to much better haze and gloss properties compared to a visbroken<br>
polypropylene of random propylene copolymer (R-PP) and optionally high melt<br>
strength polypropylene (HMS-PP), since the viscous polypropylene may improve the<br>
surface of the extrusion blown molded articles and therewith the overall transparency<br>
of said article. Accordingly it is preferred that neither the polypropylene composition<br>
as whole nor the random propylene copolymer (R-PP) has been visbroken.<br>
Accordingly, it is appreciated that the random propylene copolymer (R-PP) has a<br>
MFR2 (230 °C) of at least 0.5 g/10min, more preferably in the range of 0.5 to 2.8<br>
g/10min, yet more preferably of 1.0 to 2.5 g/10min, like 1.3 to 2.0 g/10min.<br>
The preparation of the random propylene copolymer (R-PP) will be defined in more<br>
detail below.<br>
As a further essential requirement of the present invention a high melt strength<br>
polypropylene (HMS-PP) must be used. Such polymer types are characterized by a<br>
certain degree of branching. Possible high melt strength polypropylenes (HMS-PP)<br>
are so called Y/H-polypropylenes and for instance described in EP 0 787 750, i.e.<br>
single branched polypropylene types (Y polypropylenes having a backbone with a<br>
single long side-chain and an architecture resembles a "Y") and polypropylene types<br>
in which polymer chains are coupled with a bridging group (an architecture<br>
resembles a "H")- Such polypropylenes are characterized by rather high melt<br>
strength. A parameter of the degree of branching is the branching index g'. The<br>
branching index g' correlates with the amount of branches of a polymer. The<br>
branching index g' is defined as g' = [IV]br/[IV]lin in which g' is the branching index,<br>
[IV]br is the intrinsic viscosity of the branched polypropylene and [IV]lin is the<br>
intrinsic viscosity of the linear polypropylene having the same weight average<br>
<br>
molecular weight (within a range of ±10 %) as the branched polypropylene. Thereby,<br>
a low g'-value is an indicator for a high branched polymer. In other words, if the g'-<br>
value decreases, the branching of the polypropylene increases. Reference is made in<br>
this context to B.H. Zimm and W.H. Stockmeyer, J. Chem. Phys. 17,1301 (1949).<br>
This document is herewith included by reference. Thus it is preferred that the<br>
branching index g' of the high melt strength polypropylene (HMS-PP) shall be less<br>
than 1.0, more preferably equal or less than 0.9, like less than 0.8. In another<br>
preferred embodiment the branching index g' of the high melt strength polypropylene<br>
(HMS-PP) shall be preferably less than 0.7.<br>
The high degree of branching of the high melt strength polypropylene (HMS-PP)<br>
contributes also to its melt strength. Accordingly it is preferred that the high melt<br>
strength polypropylene (HMS-PP) is further characterized by a strain hardening<br>
behavior with a haul-off force Fmax of at least 10.0 cN and a draw down velocity vmax<br>
of at least 200 mm/s, more preferably by a strain hardening behavior with a haul-off<br>
force Fmax of at least 20.0 cN and a draw down velocity vmax of at least 250 mm/s, yet<br>
more preferably by a strain hardening behavior with a haul-off force FmaX of at least<br>
25.0 cN and a draw down velocity vmax of at least 250 mm/s.<br>
Such a high melt strength polypropylene (HMS-PP) is preferably obtained by<br>
modifying, i.e. chemically modifying, a polypropylene. Such a modification is<br>
necessary to achieve the branching structure and/or the strain hardening phenomena<br>
of the high melt strength polypropylene (HMS-PP). Such a modification has also<br>
influence on the gel content of the high melt strength polypropylene (HMS-PP).<br>
Accordingly it is justified to define the high melt strength polypropylene (HMS-PP)<br>
further and/or alternatively by its gel content. Thus it is appreciated that the high melt<br>
strength polypropylene (HMS-PP) is featured by a relatively moderate gel content,<br>
i.e. of not more than 1.00 wt.-%, even more preferred of not more than 0.80 wt.-%,<br>
still more prefeixed of not more than 0.50 wt.-% determined as the relative amount of<br>
polymer insoluble in boiling xylene (xylene hot insoluble fraction, XHI). On the<br>
other hand the high melt strength polypropylene (HMS-PP) may show a certain<br>
degree of branching and thus a certain amount of gel content, i.e. of at least 0.15 wt.-<br>
%, more preferably of at least 0.27 wt.-%. Thus a preferred range for the gel content<br>
of the high melt strength polypropylene (HMS-PP) is 0.05 to 0.90 wt.-%, more<br>
preferred 0.26 to 0.8 wt.-%.<br>
Additionally it is preferred that in the melt strength polypropylene (HMS-PP) has an<br>
MFR2 (230 °C) in a range of 1.0 to 10.0 g/10 min, more preferably of 4.0 to 8.5 g/10<br>
min, still more preferably of 6.0 to 8.0 g/10 min.<br>
Preferably, the high melt strength polypropylene (HMS-PP) has a density of at least<br>
850 kg/m3, more preferably of at least 875 kg/m3 and most preferably of at least 900<br>
kg/m3.<br>
Further, preferably, the high melt strength polypropylene (HMS-PP) has a density of<br>
not more than 950 kg/m3, more preferably of not more than 925 kg/m3 and most<br>
preferably of not more than 910 kg/m3.<br>
Preferably, the high melt strength polypropylene (HMS-PP) has a melting point of at<br>
least 140°C, more preferably of at least 150°C and most preferably of at least 160°C.<br>
As stated above, the melt strength polypropylene (HMS-PP) is preferably a modified<br>
polypropylene. Accordingly the melt strength polypropylene (HMS-PP) can be<br>
further defined by the way obtained. Thus the melt strength polypropylene (HMS-<br>
PP) is preferably the result of treating an unmodified polypropylene (A) with<br>
thermally decomposing radical-forming agents and/or with ionizing radiation.<br>
<br>
However in such a case a high risk exists that the polypropylene (A) is degraded,<br>
which is detrimental. Thus it is preferred that the modification is accomplished by<br>
the use of bifunctionally unsaturated monomer(s) and/or multifunctionally<br>
unsaturated low molecular weight polymer(s) as chemically bound bridging unit(s).<br>
A suitable method to obtain the melt strength polypropylene (HMS-PP) is for<br>
instance disclosed in EP 0 787 750, EP 0 879 830 Al and EP 0 890 612 A2. All<br>
documents are herewith included by reference. Thereby, the amount of peroxide is<br>
preferably in the range of 0.05 to 3.00 wt.-% based on the unmodified polypropylene<br>
(A).<br>
Accordingly in one preferred embodiment the high melt strength polypropylene<br>
(HMS-PP) comprises units derived from<br>
(i) propylene and<br>
(ii) bifunctionally unsaturated monomer(s) and/or multifunctionally unsaturated<br>
low molecular weight polymer(s).<br>
"Bifunctionally unsaturated or multifunctionally unsaturated" as used above means<br>
preferably the presence of two or more non-aromatic double bonds, as in e.g.<br>
divinylbenzene or cyclopentadiene or polybutadiene. Only such bi- or<br>
multifunctionally unsaturated compounds are used which can be polymerized<br>
preferably with the aid of free radicals. The unsaturated sites in the bi- or<br>
multifunctionally unsaturated compounds are in their chemically bound state not<br>
actually "unsaturated", because the double bonds are each used for a covalent bond to<br>
the polymer chains of the polypropylene (A).<br>
Reaction of the bifunctionally unsaturated monomer(s) and/or multifunctionally<br>
unsaturated low molecular weight polymer(s), preferably having a number average<br>
molecular weight (Mn) 
unsaturated monomers with the propylene polymer composition may be performed in<br>
the presence of a thermally free radical forming agent, e. g. decomposing free<br>
radical-forming agent, like a thermally decomposable peroxide and/or ionizing<br>
radiation or microwave radiation.<br>
The bifunctionally unsaturated monomers may be<br>
- divinyl compounds, such as divinylaniline, m-divinylbenzene, p-<br>
divinylbenzene, divinylpentane and divinylpropane;<br>
allyl compounds, such as allyl acrylate, allyl methacrylate, allyl<br>
methyl maleate and allyl vinyl ether;<br>
dienes, such as 1,3-butadiene, chloroprene, cyclohexadiene,<br>
cyclopentadiene, 2,3-dimethylbutadiene, heptadiene, hexadiene,<br>
isoprene and 1,4-pentadiene;<br>
aromatic and/or aliphatic bis (maleimide) bis (citraconimide) and<br>
mixtures of these unsaturated monomers.<br>
Especially preferred bifunctionally unsaturated monomers are 1,3-butadiene,<br>
isoprene, dimethyl butadiene and divinylbenzene.<br>
The multifunctionally unsaturated low molecular weight polymer, preferably having<br>
a number average molecular weight (Mn) 
one or more unsaturated monomers.<br>
Examples of such low molecular weight polymers are<br>
- poly butadienes, especially where the different microstractures in the<br>
polymer chain, i.e. 1,4-cis, 1,4-trans and l,2-(vinyl) are predominantly<br>
in the 1,2-(vinyl) configuration<br>
<br>
Alkyl peroxides: allyl t-butyl peroxide, 2,2-bis(t-butylperoxybutane), l,l-bis(t-<br>
butylperoxy)-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane, n-butyl-4,4-bis(t-butylperoxy) valerate,<br>
diisopropylaminomethyl-t-amyl peroxide, dimethylaminomethyl-t-amyl peroxide,<br>
diethylaminomethyl-t-butyl peroxide, dimethylaminomethyl-t-butyl peroxide, 1,1-di-<br>

Or mixtures of these above listed free radical-forming agents.<br>
The unmodified polypropylene (A) to prepare such a high melt strength<br>
polypropylene (HMS-PP) has preferably a MFR2 (230 °C) in a range of 0.05 to<br>
<br>
45.00 g/10 min. More preferably the MFR2 (230 °C) is in a range of 0.05 to<br>
35.00 g/10 min in case the unmodified polypropylene (A) is a homopolymer. On the<br>
other hand the MFR2 (230 °C) is in a range of 0.05 to 45.00 g/10 min in case the<br>
unmodified polypropylene (A) is a copolymer.<br>
Preferably the unmodified polypropylene (A) is a homopolymer. The expression<br>
homopolymer used in the instant invention relates to a polypropylene that consists<br>
substantially, i.e. of at least 97 wt.-%, preferably of at least 98 wt.-%, more<br>
preferably of at least 99 wt.-%, still more preferably of at least 99.8 wt.-% of<br>
propylene units. In a preferred embodiment only propylene units in the propylene<br>
homopolymer are detectable. The comonomer content can be determined with FT<br>
infrared spectroscopy, as described below in the examples.<br>
Preferably the high melt strength polypropylene (HMS-PP) is produced from the<br>
unmodified polypropylene (A) as defined above under process conditions as defined<br>
in detail below.<br>
As a further polymer component a viscous polypropylene is required. As stated<br>
above this polypropylene (B) must be chemically different to the random propylene<br>
copolymer (R-PP). Of course the propylene (B) is also prefeably chemically different<br>
to the high melt strenght polypropylene (HMS-PP).<br>
One essential difference between the polypropylene (B) and the high melt strenght<br>
polypropylene (HMS-PP) is that the the polypropylene (B) is an unbranched<br>
polypropylene whereas the high melt strenght polypropylene (HMS-PP) shows a<br>
branching structure. In other words the polypropylene (B) has preferably a branching<br>
index g' of 1.0. A further distingushing feature between the high melt strenght<br>
polypropylene (HMS-PP) and the polypropylene (B) is preferably the gel content<br>
expressed in the amount of the xylene hot insoluble fraction (XHI). Accordingly the<br>
polypropylene (B) has a gel content below 0.15 wt.-%, more preferably has no<br>
detectable gel content. A further difference between the polypropylene (B) and the<br>
high melt strenght polypropylene (HMS-PP) is preferably that they differ in the melt<br>
flow rate MFR2 (230 °C), i.e. the polypropylene (B) has a higher MFR2 (230 °C)<br>
than the high melt strenght polypropylene (HMS-PP).<br>
The difference between the polypropylene (B) and the random propylene copolymer<br>
(R-PP) is preferably that they differ in the melt flow rate MFR2 (230 °C), i.e. the<br>
polypropylene (B) has a higher MFR2 (230 °C) than the random propylene<br>
copolymer (R-PP). Accordingly it is appreciated that the polypropylene (B) has a<br>
MFR2 (230 °C) of at least 400 g/10min, more preferably at least 430 g/10min, like at<br>
least 450 g/10min, yet more preferably at least 800 g/10min, like about 1,200<br>
g/10min. On the other hand the hand the polypropylene (B) should be not to viscous<br>
not to deteriorate the stiffness of the final product. Accordingly it is appreciated that<br>
the polypropylene (B) has a MFR2 (230 °C) in the range of 400 to 3,000 g/10min,<br>
more preferably in the range of 420 to 2,000 g/10min, like 440 to 1,500 g/10min.<br>
Further the molecular weight distribution (MWD) is desirable rather low.<br>
Accordingly it is preferred that the Mw/Mn (MWD) of the polypropylene (B) is<br>
below 4.5, like from 0.5 to 4.5, more preferably below 4.0, like from 0.5 to 4.0.<br>
Additionally it is appreciated that the polypropylene (B) has xylene cold soluble<br>
fraction (XCS) of not more than 5.0 wt-%, like 0.5 to 4.5 wt.-%, more preferably of<br>
not more than 3.5 wt.-%, like 0.5 to 3.0 wt.-%.<br>
The polypropylene (B) as defined throughout the present invention can be obtained<br>
by visbreaking as defined in detail below or by polymerization of propylene for<br>
instance in the presence of a metallocene catalyst. One suitable polypropylene<br>
obtained by metallocene polymerization technology is the commercial product<br>
MF650W of Basell. However it is appreciated in the present application that the<br>
polypropylene is in particular obtained by visbreaking.<br>
Accordingly, to achieve the desired MFR range, the polypropylene (B) is typically<br>
prepared by polymerizing propylene and optional comonomers to a relatively high<br>
molecular weight, which is then treated with peroxide to reduce its molecular weight<br>
to a desked average ("visbroken"). Accordingly the polypropylene (B) is preferably a<br>
visbroken polypropylene.<br>
More preferably the initial polypropylene used for the preparation of the<br>
polypropylene (B) is chosen in such a manner that the visbreaking ratio (final MFR2<br>
(230 °C) / initial MFR2 (230 °C)) is 3.5 to 40.0, more preferably 4.0 to 30.0, wherein<br>
"initial MFR2 (230 °C)" is the MFR2 (230 °C) of the polypropylene before<br>
visbreaking and<br>
"final MFR2 (230 °C)" is the MFR2 (230 °C) of the polypropylene (B).<br>
The preparation of the polypropylene (B) will be defined in more detail below.<br>
Further, the polypropylene (B) can be a propylene copolymer, like a random<br>
propylene copolymer (B') or a propylene homopolymer (B"), the latter being<br>
preferred. In case polypropylene (B) is a random propylene copolymer (B'), the<br>
copolymer (B') comprises preferably units derived from propylene and at least<br>
another C2 to C20 a-olefin, preferably at least another C2 to C10 a-olefin. Accordingly<br>
such a random propylene copolymer (B') comprises units derived from propylene<br>
and at least another a-olefin selected from the group consisting of ethylene, 1-butene,<br>
1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene, 1-octene, 1-nonene and 1-decene, wherein ethylene,<br>
<br>
1-butene and 1-hexene are preferred. It is in particular preferred that such a random<br>
propylene copolymer (B') consists of units derived from propylene and ethylene. The<br>
amount of units derived from C2 to C20 a-olefins other than propylene in the random<br>
propylene copolymer (B') is in the range of 1.0 to 7.0 wt.-%, more preferably 1.5 to<br>
6.0 wt.-%, still more preferably 2.0 to 5.5 wt.-%.<br>
Preferably the polypropylene (B) is isotactic. Accordingly it is appreciated that the<br>
polypropylene (B) has a rather high pentad concentration, i.e. higher than 90 %, more<br>
preferably higher than 92 %, still more preferably higher than 93 % and yet more<br>
preferably higher than 95 %, like higher than 99 %.<br>
Another essential requirement of the present invention is that polypropylene<br>
composition comprises a clarifier (C) comprising at least one a-nucleating agent (N).<br>
Thus as ß-nucleating agents negatively influences a-nucleating effect (of the a-<br>
nucleating agent) it is preferred that the clarifier (C) and/or the polypropylene<br>
composition is (essentially) free of ß-nucleating agents. Thus even more preferably<br>
the clarifier (C) consists of at least one a-nucleating agent (N). Accordingly the<br>
clarifier (C) may comprise, preferably consists of, one, two or three a-nucleating<br>
agent(s) (N). However it is appreciated that the clarifier (C) is a-nucleating agent<br>
(N).<br>
In principle any a-nucleating agent (N) can be used.<br>
Examples of suitable a-nucleating agents are selected from the group consisting of<br>
(i) salts of monocarboxylic acids and polycarboxylic acids, e.g. sodium benzoate or<br>
aluminum tert-butylbenzoate, and<br>
(ii) dibenzylidenesorbitol (e.g. 1,3 : 2,4 dibenzylidenesorbitol) and C1-C8-alkyl-<br>
substituted dibenzylidenesorbitol derivatives, such as methyldibenzylidenesorbitol,<br>
ethyldibenzylidenesorbitol or dimemyldibenzylidenesorbitol (e.g. 1,3 : 2,4<br>
di(methylbenzylidene) sorbitol), nonitol, 1,2,3,-trideoxy-4,6:5,7-bis-O-[(4-<br>
propylphenyl)methylene] -nonitol, and<br>
(iii) salts of diesters of phosphoric acid, e.g. sodium 2,2'-methylenebis (4,6,-di-tert-<br>
butylphenyl) phosphate or aluminium-hydroxy-bis[2,2'-methylene-bis(4,6-di-t-<br>
butylphenyl)phosphate], and<br>
(iv) vinylcycloalkane polymer and vinylalkane polymer.<br>
Such additives are generally commercially available and are described, for example, in<br>
Gachter/Muller, Plastics Additives Handbook, 4th Edition, Hansa Publishers, Munich, 1993.<br>
The nucleating agent content of the polypropylene composition is preferably up to 5 wt.-%.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the polypropylene composition of the present invention contain<br>
from 0.01 to 5.0 wt.-%, preferably from 0.02 to 0.50 wt.-%, of a a-nucleating, in particular<br>
dibenzylidenesorbitol (e.g. 1,3 : 2,4 dibenzylidene sorbitol) or a dibenzylidenesorbitol<br>
derivative, preferably dimethyldibenzylidenesorbitol (e.g. 1,3 : 2,4 di(methylbenzylidene)<br>
sorbitol) and/or nonitol, 1,2,3,-trideoxy-4,6:5,7-bis-O-[(4-propylphenyl)methylene]-nonitol,<br>
The most preferred a-nucleating is nonitol,1,2,3,-trideoxy-4,6:5,7-bis-O-[(4-<br>
propylphenyl)methylene]-nonitol. Accordingly in a especially preferred embodiment<br>
the clarifier (C) comprises, even more preferred consists of, nonitol,1,2,3,-trideoxy-<br>
4,6:5,7-bis-O-[(4-propylphenyl)mefhylene]-nonitol.<br>
In case the a-nucleating agents are polymeric a-nucleating agents selected from the<br>
group consisting of vinylcycloalkane polymers and vinylalkane polymers, these<br>
polymeric nucleating agents are either accomplished by a special reactor technique,<br>
where the catalyst is prepolymerised with monomers like e.g. vinylcyclohexane<br>
(VCH), or by blending the polypropylene composition with the vinylcycloalkane<br>
polymer or vinylalkane polymer. These methods are described in greater detail in e.g.<br>
EP 0 316 187 A2 and WO 99/24479<br>
<br>
copolymers of butadiene and styrene having 1,2- (vinyl) in the<br>
polymer chain.<br>
A preferred low molecular weight polymer is polybutadiene, in particular a<br>
polybutadiene having more than 50.0 wt.-% of the butadiene in the l,2-(vinyl)<br>
configuration.<br>
The high melt strength polypropylene (HMS-PP) may contain more than one<br>
bifunctionally unsaturated monomer and/or multifunctionally unsaturated low<br>
molecular weight polymer. Even more preferred the amount of bifunctionally<br>
unsaturated monomer(s) and multifunctionally unsaturated low molecular weight<br>
polymer(s) together in the high melt strength polypropylene (HMS-PP) is 0.01 to<br>
10.0 wt.-% based on said high melt strength polypropylene (HMS-PP).<br>
As stated above it is preferred that the bifunctionally unsaturated monomer(s) and/or<br>
multifunctionally unsaturated low molecular weight polymer(s) are used in the<br>
presence of a thermally decomposing free radical-forming agent.<br>
Peroxides are preferred thermally decomposing free radical-forming agents. More<br>
preferably the thermally decomposing free radical-forming agents are selected from<br>
the group consisting of acyl peroxide, alkyl peroxide, hydroperoxide, perester and<br>
peroxycarbonate.<br>
The following listed peroxides are in particular preferred:<br>
Acyl peroxides: benzoyl peroxide, 4-chlorobenzoyl peroxide, 3-<br>
methoxybenzoyl peroxide and/or methyl benzoyl peroxide.<br>
To obtain especially good results the required components as defined above may be<br>
present in specific amounts within the new polypropylene composition. Thus it is<br>
preferred that the polypropylene composition according to the instant invention<br>
comprises<br>
(a) 50.0 to 92.0 wt.-%, more preferably 60.0 to 90.0 wt.-%, yet more preferably<br>
65.0 to 90.0 wt.-%, of the random propylene copolymer (R-PP),<br>
(b) 5.0 to 26.0 wt.-%, more preferably 6.0 to 18.0 wt.-%, yet more preferably 6.5<br>
to 16.0 wt.-%, of the high melt strength polypropylene (HMS-PP),<br>
(c) 1.0 to 15.0 wt.-%, more preferably 1.5 to 17.0 wt.-%„ yet more preferably 2.0<br>
to 10.0 wt.-%, of the polypropylene (B), and<br>
(d) 0.01 to 5.0 wt.-%, more preferably 0.02 to 1.0 wt.-%, yet more preferably<br>
0.03 to 0.7 wt.-%, of the clarifier (C),<br>
based on the total polypropylene composition.<br>
The polypropylene composition of the present invention may comprise further<br>
components. However it is preferred that the polypropylene composition comprises<br>
as polymer components only the random propylene copolymer (R-PP), the<br>
polypropylene (B) and the high melt strength polypropylene (HMS-PP) as defined<br>
above. Accordingly the amounts of the random propylene copolymer (R-PP), the<br>
polypropylene (B), the high melt strength polypropylene (HMS-PP) and the clarifier<br>
(C) may not result in 100 wt.-% based on the total polypropylene composition. Thus<br>
the remaining part up 100.0 wt.-% may be accomplished by further additives known<br>
in the art. However this remaining part shall be not more than 10.0 wt.-% within the<br>
total composition. For instance the inventive polypropylene composition may<br>
comprise additionally small amounts of stabilizers, acid scavengers, lubricants and<br>
mold release agents, fillers, nucleating agents, antistatics, plasticizers, dyes, pigments<br>
or flame retardants. In general, these are incorporated during granulation of the<br>
pulverulent product obtained in the polymerization.<br>
<br>
The present invention is also directed to the use of the above defined polypropylene<br>
composition. Accordingly the polypropylene composition as defined in the instant<br>
invention is used for the preparation of extrusion blown molded products. More<br>
particularly the present invention is directed to the use of the polypropylene<br>
composition of the instant invention to improve the haze and/or gloss of extrusion<br>
blown molded articles, like extrusion blown molded bottles, i.e. extrusion blown<br>
molded bottles with a filling volume of 1 liter or more, made out of said<br>
polypropylene composition compared to conventional extrusion blown molded<br>
bottles, in particular compared to extrusion blown molded bottles made out of the<br>
commercial product "RB307MO" of Borealis. Moreover the use of the<br>
polypropylene composition of the instant invention shall preferably and additionally<br>
improve the top load of extrusion blown molded articles, like extrusion blown<br>
molded bottles, i.e. extrusion blown molded bottles with a filling volume of 1 liter or<br>
more, made out of said polypropylene composition compared to conventional<br>
extrusion blown molded bottles. Accordingly the present invention is in particular<br>
directed to the use of polypropylene composition of the instant invention to<br>
accomplish at least one requirement, preferably all requirements, selected from the<br>
group consisting of a haze of below 14 %, more preferably below 11 %, a gloss<br>
(inside and/or outside of the bottle) of at least 16 %, more preferably at least 19 %,<br>
and top load of at least 280 N, more preferably at least 300 N, for extrusion blown<br>
molded articles, like extrusion blown molded bottles, i.e. extrusion blown molded<br>
bottles with a filling volume of 1 liter or more.<br>
Further the present invention is directed to extrusion blown molded articles<br>
comprising, preferably comprising at least 90 wt.-%, more preferably consisting of, a<br>
polypropylene composition according to this invention. More particularly the present<br>
invention is directed to bottles, especially to bottles with a filling volume of 1 liter or<br>
more, produced by an extrusion blown process comprising, preferably comprising at<br>
least 90 wt.-%, more preferably consisting of, a polypropylene composition<br>
according to this invention.<br>
In the following the preparation of the inventive polypropylene composition is<br>
described in more detail.<br>
The individual components used for the inventive polypropylene composition are<br>
known by the person skilled in the art and thus can be readily produced by the<br>
information provided herein.<br>
For instance the random propylene copolymer (R-PP) as defined in the instant<br>
invention may be prepared by polymerizing, in a slurry reactor, for example a loop<br>
reactor, propylene optionally together with at least another C2 to C20 a-olefin<br>
(comonomers), in the presence of a polymerization catalyst to produce a part of the<br>
random propylene copolymer (R-PP). This part is then transferred to a subsequent<br>
gas phase reactor, wherein in the gas phase reactor propylene is reacted in the<br>
presence of suitably selected other C2 to C20 a-olefin(s) (comonomers) in order to<br>
produce a further part in the presence of the reaction product of the first step. This<br>
reaction sequence provides a reactor blend of parts (i) and (ii) constituting a random<br>
propylene copolymer (R-PP). It is of course possible by the present invention that the<br>
first reaction is carried out in a gas phase reactor while the second polymerization<br>
reaction is carried out in a slurry reactor, for example a loop reactor. It is furthermore<br>
also possible to reverse the order of producing parts (i) and (ii), which has been<br>
described above in the order of first producing part (i) and then producing part (ii).<br>
The above-discussed process, comprising at least two polymerization steps, is<br>
advantageous in view of the fact that it provides easily controllable reaction steps<br>
enabling the preparation of a desired reactor blend. The polymerization steps may be<br>
<br>
adjusted, for example by appropriately selecting monomer feed, comonomer feed,<br>
hydrogen feed, temperature and pressure in order to suitably adjust the properties of<br>
the polymerization products obtained. It is in particular possible to obtain a<br>
multimodality, preferably the bimodality, of the random propylene copolymer (R-<br>
PP), with respect to the comonomer, like ethylene, distribution as well as with<br>
respect to the molecular weights and MFR2 (230 °C) values during said multistage<br>
polymerization procedures.<br>
Such a process can be carried out using any suitable catalyst for the preparation of<br>
the random propylene copolymer (R-PP). Preferably, the process as discussed above<br>
is carried out using a Ziegler-Natta catalyst, in particular a high yield Ziegler-Natta<br>
catalyst (so-called fourth and fifth generation type to differentiate from low yield, so<br>
called second generation Ziegler-Natta catalysts). A suitable Ziegler-Natta catalyst to<br>
be employed in accordance with the present invention comprises a catalyst<br>
component, a co-catalyst component and at least one electron donor (internal and/or<br>
external electron donor, preferably at least one external donor). Preferably, the<br>
catalyst component is a Ti-Mg-based catalyst component and typically the co-<br>
catalyst is an Al-alkyl based compound. Suitable catalysts are in particular disclosed<br>
in US 5,234,879, WO 92/19653, WO 92/19658 and WO 99/33843.<br>
Preferred external donors are the known silane-based donors, such as dicyclopentyl<br>
dimethoxy silane or cyclohexyl methyldimethoxy silane.<br>
One embodiment of a process as discussed above is a loop-gas phase process, such as<br>
developed by Borealis, known as Borstar® technology, described for example in<br>
EP 0 887 379 Al and WO 92/12182.<br>
With respect to the above-mentioned preferred slurry-gas phase process, the<br>
following general information can be provided with respect to the process conditions.<br>
Temperature of from 40 to 110 °C, preferably between 60 and 100 °C, in particular<br>
between 80 and 90 °C, with a pressure in the range of from 20 to 80 bar, preferably<br>
30 to 60 bar, with the option of adding hydrogen in order to control the molecular<br>
weight. The reaction product of the slurry polymerization, which preferably is carried<br>
out in a loop reactor, is then transferred to the subsequent gas phase reactor, wherein<br>
the temperature preferably is within the range of from 50 to 130 °C, more preferably<br>
80 to 100 °C, at a pressure in the range of from 5 to 50 bar, preferably 15 to 35 bar,<br>
again with the option of adding hydrogen in order to control the molecular weight.<br>
The residence time can vary in the reactor zones identified above. In embodiments,<br>
the residence time in the slurry reaction, for example the loop reactor, is in the range<br>
of from 0.5 to 5 hours, for example 0.5 to 2 hours, while the residence time in the gas<br>
phase reactor generally will be from 1 to 8 hours.<br>
The properties of the random propylene copolymer (R-PP) produced with the above-<br>
outlined process may be adjusted and controlled with the process conditions as<br>
known to the skilled person, for example by one or more of the following process<br>
parameters: temperature, hydrogen feed, comonomer feed, propylene feed, catalyst,<br>
type and amount of external donor, split between two or more components of a<br>
multimodal polymer.<br>
The high melt strength polypropylene (HMS-PP) is preferably obtained by a process<br>
as described in EP 0 879 830 Al and EP 0 890 612 A2. Both documents are herewith<br>
included by reference. Accordingly the high melt strength polypropylene (HMS-PP)<br>
is produced by<br>
<br>
(a) mixing<br>
(i) a unmodified propylene homopolymer and/or copolymer (A) as defined<br>
above, preferably a unmodified propylene homopolymer with a weight<br>
average molecular weight (Mw) of 500,000 to 1,500,000 g/mol,<br>
(ii) from 0.05 to 3 wt.-% based on the components of (i) and (ii), of a peroxide<br>
selected from the group consisting of acyl peroxide, alkyl peroxide,<br>
hydroperoxide, perester and peroxycarbonate, and<br>
(iii) optionally diluted with inert solvents,<br>
(b) heating to 30 to 100 °C, preferably to 60 to 90 °C,<br>
(c) sorption of volatile bifunctional monomers, preferably ethylenically unsaturated,<br>
multifunctional monomers, like C4 to C10 dienes and/or C7 to C10 divinyl<br>
compounds, by the unmodified propylene homopolymer and/or copolymer (A),<br>
preferably unmodified propylene homopolymer (A), from the gas phase at a<br>
temperature of from 20 to 120 °C, preferably of from 60 to 100 °C, where the<br>
amount of the absorbed bifunctionally unsaturated monomers is from 0.01 to<br>
10.00 wt.-%, preferably from 0.05 to 2.00wt.-%, based on the propylene<br>
homopolymer (A),<br>
(d) heating and melting the polypropylene composition in an atmosphere comprising<br>
inert gas and/or the volatile bifunctional monomers, from sorption temperature<br>
to 210 °C, whereupon the free-radical generators are decomposed and then<br>
(e) heating the melt up to 280 °C in order to remove unreacted monomers and<br>
decomposition products, and<br>
(f) agglomerating the melt.<br>
The process for producing the high melt strength polypropylene (HMS-PP)<br>
preferably is a continuous method, performed in continuous reactors, mixers,<br>
kneaders and extruders. Batchwise production of the high melt strength<br>
polypropylene (HMS-PP), however is feasible as well.<br>
Practical sorption times x of the volatile bifunctional monomers range from 10 to<br>
1000 s, where sorption times x of 60 to 600 are preferred.<br>
The visbreaking may be carried out in any known manner, but typically the present<br>
invention envisages chemical visbreaking using a peroxide visbreaking agent.<br>
Suitable amounts of peroxide to be employed in accordance with the present<br>
invention are in principle known to the skilled person and can easily be calculated on<br>
the basis of the amount of polypropylene composition and/or random propylene<br>
copolymer (R-PP) to be subjected to visbreaking, the MFR2 (230 °C) value of the<br>
polypropylene composition and/or random propylene copolymer (R-PP) to be<br>
subjected to visbreaking and the desired target MFR2 (230 °C) of the product to be<br>
obtained. Accordingly, typical amounts of peroxide visbreaking agent are from 0.005<br>
to 1.0 wt.-%, more preferably from 0.01 to 0.5 wt.-%, based on the amount of<br>
propylene polymer employed.<br>
Typically, visbreaking in accordance with the present invention is carried out in an<br>
extruder, so that under the suitable conditions, an increase of melt flow rate is<br>
obtained. During visbreaking, higher molar mass chains of the starting product are<br>
broken statistically more frequently than lower molar mass molecules, resulting in an<br>
overall decrease of the average molecular weight and an increase in melt flow rate.<br>
As mentioned above, the polypropylene (B) is preferably obtained by visbreaking in<br>
a manner well known to those skilled in the art. Preferably it is performed as follows:<br>
a propylene polymer in particulate form, e.g. "as polymerized" flake or pelletized,<br>
has sprayed thereon or blended therewith, a prodegradant or free radical generating<br>
source, e.g. a peroxide in liquid or powder form or absorbed on and/or in a carrier,<br>
e.g. polypropylene/peroxide concentrate. Typical visbreaking agents are 2,5-<br>
dimethyl-2,5-bis(tert.butyl-peroxy)hexane (DHBP) (for instance sold under the<br>
tradenames Luperox 101 and Trigonox 101), 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-bis(tert.butyl-<br>
peroxy)hexyne-3 (DYBP) (for instance sold under the tradenames Luperox 130 and<br>
Trigonox 145), dicumyl-peroxide (DCUP) (for instance sold under the tradenames<br>
Luperox DC and Perkadox BC), di-tert.butyl-peroxide (DTBP) (for instance sold<br>
under the tradenames Trigonox B and Luperox Di), tert.butyl-cumyl-peroxide<br>
(BCUP) (for instance sold under the tradenames Trigonox T and Luperox 801) and<br>
bis (tert.butylperoxy-isopropyl)benzene (DIPP) (for instance sold under the<br>
tradenames Perkadox 14S and Lupperox DC). Suitable amounts of peroxide to be<br>
employed in accordance with the present invention are in principle known to the<br>
skilled person and can easily be calculated on the basis of the amount of<br>
polypropylene to be subjected to visbreaking, the MFR2 (230 °C) value of the<br>
polypropylene to be subjected to visbreaking and the desired target MFR2 (230 °C)<br>
of the polypropylene (B) to be obtained. Accordingly, typical amounts of peroxide<br>
visbreaking agent are from 0.005 to 0.5 wt.-%, more preferably from 0.01 to 0.2 wt.-<br>
%, based on the amount of propylene polymer employed. The propylene polymer<br>
and peroxide or propylene polymer/peroxide concentrate is introduced into a means<br>
for thermally plasticizing or melt blending and conveying the mixture, e.g., an<br>
extruder at elevated temperature. Residence time and temperature are controlled in<br>
relation to the particular peroxide selected (i.e., based on the half-life of the peroxide<br>
at the process temperature of the extruder) so as to effect the desired degree of<br>
polymer chain degradation.<br>
Further, the polymer composition in accordance with the present invention may be<br>
prepared by compounding the components within suitable melt mixing devices for<br>
preparing polymeric compounds, including in particular extruders single screw<br>
extruders as well as twin screw extruders. Other suitable melt mixing devices include<br>
planet extruders and single screw co-kneaders. Especially preferred are twin screw<br>
<br>
extruders including high intensity mixing and kneading sections. Suitable melt<br>
temperatures for preparing the compositions are in the range from 170 to 300 °C,<br>
preferably in the range from 200 to 260 °C and at a throughput of 10 to 500 kg/h and<br>
a screw speed of 50 to 200 rpm.<br>
For the preparation of extrusion molded articles an extrusion blown process as<br>
known in the art is applied. For instance, for the production of 1 liter round bottles<br>
like used for testing in the inventive work a "Fischer Miiller" Blow Molding Machine<br>
may be used. The main processing parameters for the production are as follows:<br>
- Temperature profile: 180 to 190 °C applied in extruder, adapter and head<br>
- Melt temperature measured: 180 to 190°C<br>
- Speed of extruder (revolution per minute; rpm): 11 to 14 rpm<br>
- Die gap: the die gap was adjusted to get a bottle with a weight of 40 g with Borealis<br>
grade RB307MO<br>
- Cycle time: 12 to 16 seconds<br>
The present invention will now be described in further detail by the examples<br>
provided below.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
1. Definitions/Measuring Methods<br>
The following definitions of terms and determination methods apply for the above<br>
general description of the invention as well as to the below examples unless<br>
otherwise defined.<br>
NMR-spectroscopy measurements:<br>
<br>
The C-NMR spectra of polypropylenes were recorded on Bruker 400MHz<br>
spectrometer at 130 °C from samples dissolved in l,2,4-trichlorobenzene/benzene-d6<br>
(90/10 w/w). For the pentad analysis the assignment is done according to the<br>
methods described in literature: (T. Hayashi, Y. Inoue, R. Chiijo, and T. Asakura,<br>
Polymer 29 138-43 (1988).and Chujo R, et al,Polymer 35 339 (1994).<br>
The NMR-measurement was used for determining the mmmm pentad concentration<br>
in a manner well known in the art.<br>
Randomness<br>
In the FTIR measurements, films of 250 -mm thickness were compression moulded<br>
at 225 °C and investigated on a Perkin-Elmer System 2000 FTIR instrument. The<br>
ethylene peak area (760-700 cm"1) was used as a measure of total ethylene content.<br>
The absorption band for the structure -P-E-P- (one ethylene unit between propylene<br>
units), occurs at 733 cm-1 This band characterizes the random ethylene content. For<br>
longer ethylene sequences (more than two units), an absorption band occurs at 720<br>
cm" . Generally, a shoulder corresponding to longer ethylene runs is observed for the<br>
random copolymers. The calibration for total ethylene content based on the area and<br>
random ethylene (PEP) content based on peak height at 733 cm-1 was made by 13C-<br>
NMR. (Thermochimica Acta, 66 (1990) 53-68 ).<br>
Randomness = random ethylene (-P-E-P-) content / the total ethylene content x<br>
100%.<br>
Number average molecular weight (Mn), weight average molecular weight (Mw)<br>
and molecular weight distribution (MWD) are determined by size exclusion<br>
chromatography (SEC) using Waters Alliance GPCV 2000 instrument with online<br>
viscometer. The oven temperature is 140 °C. Trichlorobenzene is used as a solvent<br>
(ISO 16014).<br>
MFR2 (230 °C) is measured according to ISO 1133 (230 °C, 2.16 kg load).<br>
Ethylene content is measured with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)<br>
calibrated with 13C-NMR. When measuring the ethylene content in polypropylene, a<br>
thin film of the sample (thickness about 250 mm) was prepared by hot-pressing. The<br>
area of absorption peaks 720 and 733 cm"1 was measured with Perkin Elmer FTIR<br>
1600 spectrometer. The method was calibrated by ethylene content data measured by<br>
13C-NMR.<br>
Content of any one of the C4 to C20 a-olefins is determined with 13C-NMR;<br>
literature: "IR-Spektroskopie fur Anwender"; WILEY-VCH, 1997 and "Validierung<br>
in der Analytik", WILEY-VCH, 1997.<br>
The xylene cold solubles (XCS, wt.-%): Content of xylene cold solubles (XCS) is<br>
determined at 23 °C according ISO 6427.<br>
The gel content is assumed to be identical to the xylene hot insoluble (XHI) fraction,<br>
which is determined by extracting 1 g of finely cut polymer sample with 350 ml<br>
xylene in a Soxhlet extractor for 48 hours at the boiling temperature. The remaining<br>
solid amount is dried at 90°C and weighed for determining the insolubles amount.<br>
Strain hardening behaviour (melt strength):<br>
The strain hardening behaviour is determined by the method as described in the<br>
article "Rheotens-Mastercurves and Drawability of Polymer Melts", M. H. Wagner,<br>
Polymer Engineering and Sience, MID-APRIL 1SW, Vol. 36, NO. 7, pages 925 to<br>
935. The content of the document is included by reference.<br>
For detailed explanation of the measuring method it is also referred to the figures 1<br>
and 2.<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of the experimental procedure which is<br>
used to determine strain hardening.<br>
The strain hardening behaviour of polymers is analysed by Rheotens apparatus (1)<br>
(product of Gottfert, Siemensstr.2, 74711 Buchen, Germany) in which a melt strand<br>
(2) is elongated by drawing down with a defined acceleration. The haul-off force F in<br>
dependence of draw-down velocity v is recorded.<br>
The test procedure is performed in a standard climatized room with controlled room<br>
temperature of 23 °C and 30 bar. The Rheotens apparatus (1) is combined with an<br>
extruder/melt pump (3) for continuous feeding of the melt strand (2). The extrusion<br>
temperature is 200 °C; a capillary die with a diameter of 2 mm and a length of 6 mm<br>
is used. The strength length between the capillary die and the Rheotens wheels is 80<br>
mm. At the beginning of the experiment, the take-up speed of the Rheotens wheels<br>
was adjusted to the velocity of the extruded polymer strand (tensile force zero): Then<br>
the experiment was started by slowly increasing the take-up speed of the Rheotens<br>
wheels until the polymer filament breaks. The acceleration of the wheels was small<br>
enough so that the tensile force was measured under quasi-steady conditions.The<br>
acceleration of the melt strand (2) drawn down is 120 mm/sec2.<br>
The Rheotens was operated in combination with the PC program EXTENS. This is a<br>
real-time data-acquisition program, which displays and stores the measured data of<br>
tensile force and drawdown speed.<br>
The schematic diagram in figure 1 shows in an exemplary fashion the measured<br>
increase in haul-off force F (i.e. "melt strength") versus the increase in draw-down<br>
velocity v (i.e. "drawability").<br>
Haze measurement on bottles<br>
Instrument: Haze-gard plus from BYK-Gardner<br>
Testing: according to ASTM D1003 (as for injection molded plates)<br>
The bottles:<br>
It is measured on the wall of the bottles. The top and bottom of the bottles is cut off.<br>
This round wall is then split in two, horizontally. Then the haze measurement and the<br>
wall thickness are done in six places around this wall, close to the middle. Then the<br>
haze value is reported as average of this six parallels.<br>
Gloss measurement on bottles<br>
Instrument: Sceen TRI-MICROGLOSS 20-60-80 from BYK-Gardner<br>
Testing: ASTM D 2457 (as for injection molded plates)<br>
The bottles:<br>
<br>
It is measured on the wall of the bottles. The top and bottom of the bottles is cut off.<br>
This round wall is then split in two, horizontally. Then this wall is cut into six equal<br>
samples of app. 90x90 mm, just to fit into a special light trap made for testing on<br>
injection molded parts. Then the gloss at 60° is measured on these six samples, and<br>
the average value is reported as gloss at 60°<br>
Top load<br>
Aim of this measurement is to determine the stiffness of 1 liter round bottles.<br>
Determined by this method is the deformation force at 1 mm, 2 mm and 3 mm<br>
deformation of the round bottle. Additionally the maximum force Fmax and the<br>
deformation in mm at Fmax are determined.<br>
The bottles have a height of 203 mm. The bottles are produced according to the<br>
description given below.<br>
Before testing, the bottles are conditioned for 7 days at a temperature of 23 °C and at<br>
relative humidity of 50 % (+/- 5 %). The burr of the bottle orifice is removed.<br>
Top load is tested at universal testing machine of the class 1 according to DIN<br>
51221. Bottles to be tested are put between two parallel buffed plates of hardened<br>
steel, one plate is fixed and the other plate is moving. Force is recorded and results<br>
are given as Fmax (N) and Deformation at Maximum Force (mm).<br>
Eight bottles are tested with speed of 10 mm/min by using 2.5 kN load cell. The test<br>
results of the eight tested bottles give the average value.<br>
Weight Swell<br>
The weight swell is a measurement that shows the fit in process ability of a<br>
polypropylene sample material compared to a defined reference grade.<br>
The weight swell is defined as the ratio of the weight of a sample bottle, produced at<br>
defined reference conditions, to the weight of a standard bottle produced at reference<br>
conditions.<br>
The formula is the following:<br>
Weight swell (%) = weight of sample bottle (g) / weight of standard bottle (g) x<br>
100<br>
Reference conditions are defined as the appropriate set of temperature (°C),<br>
throughput of feeding extruder (rpm) and width of the die gap (mm) needed for the<br>
production of standard bottles showing exactly a weight of 40 +/- 1 g by using a<br>
defined standard polypropylene grade used for extrusion blow molding. The standard<br>
bottles described in this invention are produced from Borealis random polypropylene<br>
grade RB307MO (ethylene content about 4 wt.-%, MFR2 (230 °C) about 1.5<br>
g/10min) under reference condition, meaning condition necessary to get to bottles<br>
with 40 g (+/- 1g).<br>
2. Preparation of the Examples<br>
The components were blended according to Table 1. For stabilization of the materials<br>
a conventional additive package has been used like 0.2 wt/% Irganox B225<br>
(antioxidant masterbatch supplied by Ciba Specialty Chemicals, Switzerland) and<br>
0,05 wt% Ca-Stearate (CAS-No. 1592-23-0). Blending took place in a twin screw<br>
extruder (PRISM TSE24 L/D ratio 40) with two high intensity mixing segments at<br>
temperatures between 190 and 240°C at a through put of 10 kg/h and a screw speed<br>
of 50 rpm. The material was extruded to two circular dies of 3 mm diameter into a<br>
water bath for strand solidification and then pelletized and dried.<br>
For the production of 1 liter round bottles like used for testing in the inventive work<br>
a "Fischer Miiller" Blow Molding Machine was used. The main processing<br>
parameters for the production are as follows:<br>
- Temperature profile: 180 to 190 °C applied in extruder, adapter and head<br>
- Melt temperature measured: 180 to 190°C<br>
- Speed of extruder (revolution per minute; rpm): 11 to 14 rpm<br>
- Die gap: the die gap was adjusted to get a bottle with a weight of 40 g with Borealis<br>
grade RB307MO<br>
- Cycle time: 12 to 16 seconds<br>
