"DISC BRAKE COMPRISING A BRAKE MECHANISM"<br>
HALDEX BRAKE PRODUCTS AB,  of Box 501,  SE-261   24 Landskrona, Sweden,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
Description<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention concerns a disc brake comprising a brake mechanism. The brake mechanism is received in a brake caliper. The caliper is furnished with an opening for receiving a bearing bracket of the brake mechanism.<br>
The brake mechanism according to the present invention is primarily intended for a heavy road vehicle but may quite as well be used for a lighter road vehicle or a rail vehicle.<br>
As the brake pads of the disc brake wear the position of the thrust plate or plates are normally altered to compensate for the wear. Without the adjustment of the position there would eventually be an impracticable stroke length of the brake. The position is altered by means of an adjuster mechanism, which takes up possible slack during each brake stroke. Normally there are two thrust units and the slack should be taken up in the same extent by both thrust units. Thus, the movement controlled by the adjuster mechanism has to be synchronized to give the same adjustment of both thrust units and thus avoid uneven wear of the brake pads.'<br>
Prior Art<br>
it is previously known to have an adjuster mechanism to take up slack of the brake. It is also known to synchronize the<br><br>
controlled movement of the adjuster mechanism between two thrust units.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The brake mechanism of the present invention comprises a drive means including an adjuster mechanism, as is known in the art. Furthermore, the drive means includes two thrust units. The synchronization of the thrust units is given as an additional effect of the drive means. The brake mechanism also includes a bearing bracket. The bearing bracket is to be received from the inside in an opening of the brake caliper. The adjuster mechanism is received in the bearing bracket. The brake caliper is reaching over the brake disc and has a cavity for receiving the brake mechanism.<br>
One object of the present invention is to have a high quality concerning the function of synchronizing the adjustment movements between the two thrust units of the brake mechanism.<br>
A further object is to have a brake mechanism, which is practical concerning maintenance and replacements.<br>
Still a further object is to have an as compact and accurate brake mechanism as possible.<br>
The above objects are achieved by a brake mechanism comprising a synchronization mechanism which is arranged between the cover closing the cavity in the brake caliper for receiving the brake mechanism and a cross bar in such a way so as to move with the cross bar during actuation.<br>
                                                                  3 <br>
Further, the brake mechanism is comprising a bearing bracket received from the inside in an opening of the caliper. The brake mechanism comprises an adjuster mechanism and adjustment and reset shafts. She adjuster mechanism is actuated by a lever pin on the lever of the brake mechanism actuated by a pneumatic cylinder or the like. The adjuster mechanism is received in the bearing bracket at assembly.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention a set of gear wheels are arranged between the cover and the cross bar, which synchronize the movement between two thrust units which are arranged in the in the cross bar. By using straight-toothed gear wheels there will be no oblique forces at the transfer of torque, whereby resetting of the mechanism will be made easier. Furthermore, the torque limiter of the adjuster mechanism may be smaller.<br>
Preferably, one gear wheel is integrated with the thrust units, respectively, whereby at least one intermediate gear wheel cooperating with said gear wheels is rotatably mounted to the cross bar.<br>
In a second embodiment of the invention, chain wheels arranged on the thrust units and a chain meshing with said chain wheels are located between the cover and the cross bar.<br>
According to the invention, by placing the parts giving the synchronization under the cross bar, a more compact mechanism is provided.<br>
                        4<br><br>
The driving will take place on sleeves requiring one thrust plate. The plate may be used to make sure that the pressure balance is optimal on pads having a suitable design.<br>
The brake mechanism of the present invention is preferably pneumatically actuated, but it may also be hydraulically or electrically actuated.<br>
Further objects and advantages of the invention will be obvious for a person skilled: in the art from reading the description below.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
Embodiments of the invention will be more closely described below as a way of example and by reference to the enclosed Pigs., in which<br>
Fig. 1  is an example of a caliper to be used with all the<br>
           shown embodiments of the brake mechanism according<br>
            to the invention. <br>
Fig. 2  is a perspective view of a first embodiment of a<br>
              brake mechanism according to the invention,<br>
 Fig. 3  is a cross section of the caliper and of the brake<br>
mechanism of Fig. 2,  and <br>
Fig. 4   is a perspective view of a second embodiment<br>
of a brake mechanism according to the invention.<br>
Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
In Fig. 1 an example of a caliper 16 is shown. The caliper 16 has an opening 17 in the side wall furthest from the brake disc and<br>
                                                                       5  <br>
it has a cavity for receiving the brake mechanism of any of the embodiments described here.<br>
The brake mechanism according to the embodiment of Figs. 2 and 3 comprises a lever 31 mounted in a bearing bracket 30, to be received in an opening 17 of the Caliper 16. The lever 31 acts on a cross bar 34. The lever 31 is supported by roller bearings 20/21 placed in the bearing bracket 30 and the cross bar 34, respectively. In some embodiments the roller bearing of the bearing bracket 30 is replaced by a plain bearing.<br>
The cross bar 34 has two openings receiving an adjustment shaft 40 and a reset shaft 41, respectively. Thus, the adjustment and reset shafts 40, 41 are rotatably mounted in the cross bar 34.<br>
The brake pad will go into contact with the brake disc during activation of the brake. As is known a further brake pad is arranged on the opposite side of the brake disc. The further brake pad is in a known way brought into contact with the brake disc in that the open caliper 16 is moved at the activation of the brake.<br>
Furthermore, the brake mechanism comprises a cover 7 fixed to the open caliper 16 at assembly. A return spring 11 is positioned between the cover 7 and the cross bar 34 in order to bring the brake mechanism back to its rest position.<br>
To protect the brake mechanism from road dirt bellows 15 are placed between the thrust plate 38 and the cover 7. In the shown embodiment the bellows 15 are placed in a heat protection ring.<br>
                          6<br><br>
The bearing bracket 30 is received in an opening 17 of the caliper 16. The opening 17 is placed in the wall of the caliper 16 furthest from the brake disc, thus, the caliper is of an open design. The bearing bracket 30 has a shoulder 18 abutting the inside of the caliper 16 and thus, the bearing bracket 30 is placed in the opening 17 of the caliper 16 from the inside. The reaction of the clamp force of the brake is transmitted by means of the bearing bracket 30 to the open caliper 16. The force of reaction is transmitted via the shoulder 18 of the bearing bracket 30. As the force of reaction is transmitted by means of the shoulder 16 of the bearing bracket 30 the force is transmitted in a area surrounding the opening 17 of the caliper 16. The bearing bracket 30 is a loaded part of the brake mechanism and, thus, the bearing bracket 30 and its shoulder 18 should have enough strength to transmit the force of reaction. A person skilled in the art realises that the shoulder may be placed in the caliper 16 instead of the bearing bracket 30, in which case the force of reaction will be transmitted via the edge area of the bearing bracket 30 to the shoulder of the caliper 16.<br>
The bearing bracket of all the embodiments described in this application co-operates with the caliper in the same way as stated above.<br>
A sealing is placed between the bearing bracket 30 and the open caliper 16. The sealing between the bearing bracket 30 and the open caliper 16 is received in a groove of the bearing bracket 30. The groove and thus the sealing may be placed in any position axially or radially in the bearing bracket 30. The inside of the open caliper 16 may be machined via said opening 17 of the caliper 16.<br><br>
                                                                    7 <br>
In the first embodiment of the brake mechanism according to Figs. 2 and 3 the lever 31 forms one unit with the bearing bracket 30. The lever is attached to the bearing bracket 30 by means of clips 13. The lever 31 acts on the cross bar 34 by means of an intermediate part in the form of a stud 28. In this embodiment a number of gear wheels 24 and 44 are placed in the area between the cross bar 34 and the cover 7. The intermediate gear wheel 24 is rotatably mounted on a pin 45 which protrudes form the side of the cross bar 34 which faces the brake disc. At the same time, the pin 45 is functioning as the abutment for the return spring 11 arranged between the cross bar 34 and the cover 7.<br>
In this embodiment thrust units are formed connected with a single, common thrust plate 38, which thrust plate 38 acts on a brake pad. The thrust units comprise thrust screws 39 which are received by the adjustment and reset shafts 40, 41 in threaded engagement, respectively. The thrust screws 39 have an opening at the bottom, which receives a stud 50 on the thrust plate 38. The studs 50 of the thrust plate 38 and the openings of the thrust screws 39 are formed to lock the thrust screws 39, thus hinder them from rotating.<br>
One of the thrust units is further furnished with the adjuster mechanism 23 and the adjustment shaft 40. The adjuster mechanism 23 is placed on top of the thrust screw 39 and received in the bearing bracket 30. The other thrust unit is furnished with the reset shaft 41. The shafts 40, 41 are drivingly connected by means of the set of gear wheels 24 and 44. One gear wheel 44 is integrated with the adjustment shaft 40 and the reset shaft 41, respectively. Both gear wheels 44 are meshing with the intermediate gear wheel 24 which is rotatably mounted on the pin 45 of the cross bar 34.<br><br>
                     8<br>
The shafts 40, 41 and the screws 39 of the thrust units may rotate relative each other, which is of importance for adjustment of slack in the disc brake. The shafts 40, 41 have the form of sleeves placed on the outside of the thrust screws 39.  The adjuster mechanism 23 co-operates with the lever 31 by means of a lever pin 43. This will turn the adjustment, shafts 40 in the openings of the cross bar 34 and by virtue of the threaded engagement between the adjustment and reset shafts 40 and 41 and the thrust screws 39 the latter are moved forward in order to compensate for wear of the brake pad. The adjuster mechanism 23 is part of the drive means of the brake mechanism. Thus, the synchronizing is an additional function of the drive means.<br>
In a second embodiment according to the Fig. 4 the set of gear wheels are replaced by chain wheels 33 and a chain 32 cooperating with said chain wheels 33 which are integrated with the adjustment shafts 40 and reset shafts 41. The chain wheels 33 and the chain 32 are placed in the area between the cross bar 34 and the cover 7. In all other aspects the embodiment of Fig. 4 corresponds with the embodiment of Figs. 2 and 3.<br>
In the embodiments of Figs. 2 to 4 the cross bar 34 is supported by four protruding parts 36 of the cross bar 34 and the return spring 11 in the cover 7. The protruding parts 36 of the cross bar 34 abut the inside of the open caliper 16. The part of the caliper 16 in contact with the protruding parts of the cross bar 34 is machined to give a smooth surface. The machining is done via the opening 17 of the open caliper 16. The return spring 11 is guided in an opening in 9the pin 45 of the cross bar 34 and acts between the cross bar 34 and the cover 7. The return spring 11 is received in a holder of the cover 7. The cross bar 34 is<br><br><br><br>
  free to move in the thrust direction along the machined part and in one direction perpendicular to the thrust direction. The latter direction is the tangential direction of the brake discs. In an<br>
alternative embodiment the cross bar 34 is guide on guide sleeves (not shown) placed around the screws that are used to fix the cover 7 to the open caliper 16.<br>
The cover 7 is fixed to the open caliper 16 by means of screws. The cover 7 has openings to receive the thrust units. There is a clearance between the cover 7 and the thrust units allowing the thrust units to move in any direction in relation to the cover 7.<br>
The following apply to the embodiments of Pig. 2 to 4. When the brake is activated the lever 31 will press the cross bar 34 and thus the thrust plate 38, via the thrust screws 39, and the brake pads in direction towards the brake disc (not shown). When the brake pads hits the brake disc, the pads will move in the tangential direction of the brake disc a short distance before the brake pads hit a support (not shown). The movement in the tangential direction of the brake disc is normally not more than a few millimetres. The lever 31, the cross bar 34 and the thrust units of the brake mechanism will follow the brake pads in their movement. During this movement the lever 31 will slide in the bearing. The cross bar 34 will move in the tangential direction of the brake disc guided by the protruding parts 36 of the cross bar 34 or the guide sleeves. The cover 7 is fixed to the caliper 16 and will not move. The movement between the cross bar 34 and the cover 7 is taken up by the return spring 11. When the brake is released the return spring 11 will bring the cross bar 34 back to its centred position. The lever 31 and the thrust units will move with the cross bar 34 into the centred position. Thus, the<br><br>
return spring 11 resets the brake mechanism both in the thrust direction and sideways.<br>
The adjuster mechanism 23 is of a known construction and is the same for all the embodiments of Pigs. 2 to 4. When the brake is applied the lever pin 43 of the respective lever 31 will act on the adjuster mechanism 23. When the A-distance has been traversed the housing of the adjuster mechanism 23 is forced to rotate anti-clockwise. The A-distance determines the clearance between the brake pads and the brake disc when the brake is not activated.<br>
During an application stroke the A-distance will first be traversed. At the continued application stroke the lever pin 43 will rotate the housing of the adjuster mechanism 23. This rotation will be transferred to the adjustment shaft 40.<br>
In the embodiments of Figs. 2 to 4 the adjustment shaft 40 will rotate in relation to the thrust screws 39. the adjustment shaft 40 and the reset shaft 41 will be rotated concurrent by means of the set of gear wheels 24 and 44. By the rotation of the shafts 40, 41 the position of the thrust plate 38 in relation to the brake disc will be altered.<br>
The rotation of the adjustment shaft 40  and reset shaft 41, respectively, will decrease the slack, if the slack between the brake pads and the brake disc is excessive of a set control distance. The slack will be decreased until a counter-force and thus a torque is built up when the brake pads engage the brake disc. The force transmission during adjustment occurs by means of a one-way spring drivingly acting between a driving ring and an adjuster hub of the known adjuster mechanism 23. When the brake<br>
-11-   <br>
pads are in engagement with the brake disc, the torque is such that the slip will occur between the housing and the adjustment spring inside the adjuster mechanism 23 at further rotation of the housing.<br>
During the release stroke no torque is transmitted by the one-way spring, which slips in the direction of rotation. If the slack between the brake pads and the brake disc was excessive and this slack has been taken up by rotation of the shafts 40 and 41 in relation to the cross bar 34, this new relative position will be maintained during the release stroke.<br>
The reset shaft 41 is furnished with a suitable head to receive a tool used to reset the thrust units when the brake pads are to be replaced. This movement will be transferred to the adjustment shaft 40 by means of the set of gear wheels 24, 44 or the chain 32. The shaft 41 is rotated in the normal way until the distance between the thrust plate 38 and the brake disc is sufficient to receive the new brake pads. Then the shaft 41 is rotated in such a way that the distance between the thrust plate 38 and the brake disc corresponds to the desired running clearance. The reset shaft 41 is received in a sealed opening of the bearing bracket 30.<br>
A person skilled in the art realises that the different embodiments of the bearing bracket, the lever and the intermediate part may be combined in many different ways.<br>
