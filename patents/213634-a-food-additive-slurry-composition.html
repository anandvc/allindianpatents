A FOOD ADDITIVE SLURRY COMPOSITION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a food additive slurry composition and powder composition which are effectively utilized for enriching magnesium by adding to foods such as yogurt, cow milk, juice, milk powder and the like, are highly concentrated and have the excellent dispersion stability in a solution, and food compositions containing these compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Recently, an attention has been paid to the action of magnesium in a living body.   Magnesium has the actions of relaxing and dilating muscle and blood vessel, and is an indispensable mineral to a human being.   When magnesium is deficient, it is considered that a human being easily suffers from hypertension, angina pectoris and hyperlipemia.    In addition, magnesium is greatly involved in calcium metabolism and, when magnesium is deficient, various symptoms accompanied with calcium metabolism abnormality are manifested.    Further, it is said that magnesium is associated with many enzyme reactions, and maintains homeostasis in a living body.    However, recently, since a diet life has been europeanized and Japanese people have begun to take cereals having a high polishing degree, and magnesium is considerably reduced at a stage of purifying and processing<br>
1<br><br>
a food, there is a tendency that magnesium is deficient in a diet life of modern people, and an attention is paid to magnesium-enriched products.<br>
For example, in refreshing beverage, for the purpose of enriching a magnesium component, water-soluble magnesium such as magnesium chloride, magnesium sulfate and the like, water-insoluble or hardly soluble magnesium in an inorganic form such as magnesium oxide and the like are added and used.    However, water-soluble magnesium in an organic or inorganic form has a defect that it is considerably bitter, an addition amount thereof is limited because of a flavor problem which is a great factor in foods, and use in a large amount is impossible.    In addition, when a water-insoluble or hardly soluble magnesium ingredient in an inorganic form such as magnesium oxide and the like is used, a specific gravity is as high as 2.1 or higher and, when dispersed in a refreshing beverage, the ingredient is precipitated in a short time.    Therefore, this is not preferable from a viewpoint of eating feeling and beauty appearance as a food and, consequently, an addition amount is limited like water-soluble magnesium ingredient, thus, such the magnesium has a defect that it can not be used in a large amount. As a method which compensates for this defect and can add a large amount of magnesium for food uses, JP-A No. 2000-83622 proposes a method for improving the dispersibility of calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate by mixing at least one dispersing agent selected from sorbitan fatty acid ester, glycerol fatty acid ester, propylene glycol fatty acid ester, sucrose fatty acid ester, soybean phospholipid and condensed phosphate with calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate.     In Example thereof, there is described a process for preparing a 20 wt% mixed slurry in which calcium<br>
2<br><br>
carbonate and magnesium carbonate are mixed at a ratio of 2 : 1.    However, although a mixed slurry obtained by this process has the improved dispersibility as compared with the previous magnesium ingredient, its average particle diameter is around about 0.5  m, thus, it can not be said that the slurry has the sufficiently dispersed state.    In addition, since an amount of particles in a crude particle region of 1  m or larger is 17.4% by weight, cow's milk to which a mixed slurry obtained by this process is added has a deteriorated yield of magnesium carbonate in a centrifugal classifying machine such as a clarifier and the like in its manufacturing step, and is easily precipitated in foods such as cow's milk and the like.    Thus, it can not be said that the physical property thereof is sufficient for retaining the long term dispersibility.    Further, it can not be said that a mixed slurry having the solid matter concentration of around 20% by weight has the sufficient economical property.<br>
Recently, with progress of a container and a storage method which can store liquid foods such as cow's milk, yogurt, juice and the like for a long term, in more cases, the foods are stored in shops, vending machines, and large refrigerators in home for a long term.    A water-insoluble or hardly soluble magnesium particle in an inorganic form which is added to the same kind foods for the purpose of enriching magnesium is precipitated on a bottom of a food container during long term storage of liquid foods when the dispersed state in the foods is not extremely excellent.    And, when ones drink liquid foods such as cow's milk and juice, the precipitate gives unpleasant feeling and dirty feeling to drinkers.<br>
Therefore, in liquid foods to which an inorganic particle such as<br>
3<br><br>
water-insoluble or hardly soluble; magnesium in an inorganic form prepared by the conventional technique is added for the purpose of enriching magnesium and which are currently sold, since a dispersion stable term of the inorganic particle in foods is short, it is necessary that an amount of the inorganic particle to be added is limited to an extremely small amount, and it is necessary that such the liquid foods are limited to liquid foods which general consumers must use for eating within 1 to 2 days from purchasing, thus being inconvenient.<br>
In view of the such circumstances, the present invention solved the above problems and provides a food additive slurry composition and powder composition which have the very high concentration leading to excellent distribution economical property,, and have the suitable high dispersibility as an additive to foods such as cow's milk and the like, and food compositions containing these.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Magnesium hydroxide used in the present invention is prepared, for example, by reacting a lime milk with a solution obtained by decarbonizing sea water, to obtain colloidal magnesium hydroxide, and washing and<br>
5<br><br>
dehydrating the resulting aqueous suspension of magnesium hydroxide repeatedly, followed by drying and grinding.<br>
As magnesium silicate used in the present invention, any of natural magnesium silicate such as magnesium orthosilicate, hydrated magnesium silicate and the like, and magnesium trisilicate may be used and, preferably, chemically synthesized magnesium trisilicate is used.<br>
As a process for preparing magnesium trisilicate, there can be exemplified a process of adding magnesium chloride to a sodium silicate solution, stirring the materials to prepare an aqueous suspension of magnesium trisilicate, and washing and dehydrating the resulting aqueous suspension of magnesium trisilicate repeatedly, followed by drying and grinding.<br>
Magnesium oxide used in the present invention is prepared by a method of firing magnesium carbonate at a high temperature, or by a method of adding calcium hydroxide to sea water or an aqueous magnesium chloride solution to produce magnesium hydroxide, which is sufficiently washed with water, dehydrated, dried, and fired at 500°C or higher.<br>
Magnesium phosphate used in the present invention is prepared, for example, by adding sodium hydrogen carbonate to an aqueous solution of magnesium sulfate and disodium hydrogen phosphate to react them in the weak alkaline state, to prepare an aqueous suspension of magnesium phosphate, and washing and dehydrating the resulting aqueous suspension of magnesium phosphate repeatedly, followed by drying and grinding.<br>
Magnesium hydrogen phosphate used in the present invention is prepared, for example, by reacting magnesium oxide with a phosphoric acid<br>
6<br><br>
solution to prepare an aqueous suspension of magnesium hydrogen phosphate, which is dehydrated, dried and ground.<br>
Magnesium carbonate used in the present invention is prepared, for example, by adding an alkali carbonate solution to a soluble aqueous magnesium solution to mix them while heating at 60 to 80°C, to obtain a precipitate, filtering the precipitate, and repeating the procedure of adding warm water and filtering several times, followed by drying and wet grinding. In order to obtain a finer dispersion, it is preferable to use light magnesium carbonate.<br>
As dolomite used in the present invention, natural dolomite and synthetic dolomite having magnesium at 10% by weight or larger can be used. When natural dolomite is used, dolomite is ground using an H mill, a vertical mill, a ball mill or a roll mill, and then used.    Synthetic dolomite is obtained, for example, by a hydrothermal reaction of magnesium chloride, calcium chloride and calcium carbonate.<br>
In addition, a specific surface area of the aforementioned magnesium ingredient used in the present invention as a raw material by a nitrogen absorption method (BET method) is preferably in a range of 1 to 50 m2/g. When a specific surface area is smaller than 1 m2/g, there arises a problem of the long term stability in liquid foods such as cow's milk and the like.    On the other hand, when a specific surface area exceeds 50m2/g, since a cohesive force of a magnesium ingredient or a magnesium group becomes extremely strong, its dispersion becomes difficult.<br>
Examples of the magnesium ingredient used in the present invention include magnesium hydroxide, magnesium silicate, magnesium oxide,<br>
7<br><br>
magnesium phosphate and magnesium hydrogen phosphate.    These are used alone or in combination of two or more.    In order to prepare a food additive slurry composition having the better dispersibility, it is preferable to use magnesium silicate, magnesium oxide or magnesium phosphate.<br>
Examples of the magnesium group used in the present invention include magnesium carbonate, dolomite, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium silicate, magnesium oxide, magnesium phosphate, magnesium hydrogen phosphate and the like.    These are used alone or in combination of two or more.    From a viewpoint that a food additive slurry composition dispersable easily is easily prepared, it is preferable to use magnesium carbonate or dolomite.<br>
As the emulsion stabilizer used in the present invention, at least one selected from the following (P) group is used when a magnesium ingredient is used.    In order to prepare a food additive slurry composition having the better dispersibility, preferably at least one selected from the following (Q) group is used.    Further preferably, at least one selected from the following (R) group is used.    In addition, when a magnesium group is used, at least one selected from the following (S) group is preferable.<br>
(P) group : polyglycerol fatty acid ester, gum arabic, processed starch, sucrose fatty acid ester having an HLB of   8 or higher, carboxymethyl cellulose    (CMC), methyl cellulose (MC), propylene glycol alginate (PGA), water-soluble soybean polysaccharide, condensed phosphate, gum ghatti, phospholipid and arabino galactan,<br>
(Q) groups polyglycerol fatty acid ester, gum arabic, processed starch, PGA, water-soluble soybean polysaccharide, condensed phosphate, gum<br>
8<br><br>
ghatti, phospholipid and arabino galactan,<br>
(R) group: gum arabic, processed starch, PGA, water-soluble soybean polysaccharide, gum ghatti and arbino galactan,<br>
(S) group: gum arabic, PGA, water-soluble soybean polysaccharide and gum ghatti.<br>
Sucrose fatty acid ester used in the present invention is a sucrose fatty acid ester which complies with food additive specification and has an HLB of 8 or higher.    Inter alia, a sucrose fatty acid ester having an HLB of 15 or higher is preferable.    In a fatty acid composition in a sucrose fatty acid ester, a sucrose fatty acid ester having a ratio of fatty acid of a carbon number of 18 in the fatty acid being 50% by weight or larger is preferable, more preferably 60% by weight or larger, further preferably 65% by weight or larger.    When a ratio of fatty acid of a carbon number of 18 in the fatty acid composition in sucrose fatty acid ester is smaller than 50% by weight, there is a tendency that the stability of a magnesium ingredient or a magnesium group in foods such as cow's milk and the like becomes deficient, besides, bitterness is exhibited in flavor, thus being not preferable.<br>
In addition, a content of an alkali metal salt of fatty acid in a food additive slurry composition is preferably 0.1 to 2.0% by weight, more preferably 0.3 to 1.5% by weight, further preferably 0.5 to 1.5% by weight relative to a sucrose fatty acid ester.    When the content is smaller than 0.1% by weight, there is a tendency that the solubility of a sucrose fatty acid ester in cold water is suppressed and, as a result, since the stability of a magnesium ingredient or a magnesium group in foods such as cow's milk and the like becomes deficient, thus being not preferable.    When the content exceeds 2.0%<br>
9<br><br>
by weight, use as a food additive is not preferable.<br>
Examples of the polyglycerol fatty acid ester used in the present invention include various fatty acid esters such as triglycerol, pentaglycerol, hexaglycerol, decaglycerol and the like, and a self-emulsifying type monoglycerol fatty acid ester and the like.    Polyglycerol fatty acid ester having an HLB of 8 to 18 is preferable.    More preferably, fatty acid esters such as triglycerol and pentaglycerol are used.<br>
As the CMC used in the present invention, any CMCs may be used as far as they comply with food additive specification.   A substitution degree of a carboxymethyl group is preferably 0.3 to 2.0, more preferably 0.3 to 1.5, further preferably 0.6 to 1.0.    When the substitution degree is smaller than 0.3, there is a tendency that the acid resistance, the alkali resistance, the salt resistance and the like are deficient, as a result, the stability of a magnesium ingredient or a magnesium group in foods such as cow's milk and the like is deficient, thus being not preferable.    When the substitution degree exceeds 2.0, since a viscosity of an aqueous solution thereof becomes high, when used in foods such as cow's milk, drink type yogurt and the like, a viscosity of products is increased, thus being not preferable from a viewpoint of eating feeling.<br>
Examples of the PGA used in the present invention include PGAs which comply with food additive specification and have an esterification degree of not smaller than 75% and smaller than 100%, preferably an esterification degree of not smaller than 85% and smaller than 100%, more preferably an esterification degree of not smaller than 90% and smaller than 100%.    When an esterification degree is smaller than 75%, there is a<br>
10<br><br>
tendency that the dispersibility is inferior, thus being not preferable.    When an esterification degree is 100%, gelling easily occurs, thus being not preferable.<br>
As the water-soluble soybean polysaccharide used in the present invention, any water-soluble soybean polysaccharides may be used as far as they are water-soluble polysaccharides obtained by extracting and purifying from soybean and comply with food additive specification.    Water-soluble soybean polysaccharides which are composed of galactose, arabinose,galacturonic acid, xylose, flucose, glucose, rhamnose, and a sugar of polysaccharides, and have an average molecular weight of a few hundreds thousands are preferable.<br>
As the gum arabic used in the present invention, any gums arabic are used as far as they comply with food additive specification, thus being not limited.    Gum arabic having a content of proteins contained in gum arabic components being 1% or larger is preferable.<br>
As the arabino galactan used in the present invention, any arabino galactans may be used as far as they comply with food additive specification, and arabino galactan having a molecular weight often thousands or larger is preferable.<br>
Examples of the phospholipid used in the present invention include vegetable (soybean, rapeseed, corn, cotton seed) lecithin, high purity lecithin, fractionated lecithin, enzyme treated lecithin, enzyme-decomposed lecithin and the like which comply with food additive specification.    Lecithin having an HLB of 8 or higher is preferable.    However, lecithin has a slight problem in flavor, and animal (such as yolk) lecithin, high purity lecithin and the like<br>
11<br><br>
are preferable from a viewpoint of flavor.<br>
A kind of the processed starch used in the present invention is not particularly limited, but in order to retain the very excellent stability in drinks which can be stored for a long term, starches obtained by at least one kind of reactions such as oxidation, acid treatment, enzyme treatment, esterification, etherification, cross-linking and the like, that is, starches obtained by one or two or more reactions such as acid-treated starch, oxidized starch, enzyme-denatured dextrin, esterified starch, etherified starch and cross-linked starch are preferable.    In particular, octenyl succinic acid ester starch is preferable.    Octenyl succinic acid starch is usually obtained by making a starch suspension slightly alkaline, and adding an octenyl succinic acid suspension dropwise.   Alternatively, starches which were subjected to the aforementioned other treatments and/or a mixture thereof can be used. Examples of the aforementioned processed starch include PURITY GUM 1773, PURITY GUM 2000, N-CREAMER 46 and CAPSULE (all trade names manufactured by National Starch), Emulstar 30A (trade name manufactured by Matsutani Kagaku Kogyo K.K.) and the like.<br>
In addition, a kind of a raw material of the starch used in the present invention is not particularly limited, but from a viewpoint of the stability of a viscous solution and a viscosity, waxy corn starch is preferable.<br>
Then, a food additive slurry composition of the aforementioned magnesium ingredient or magnesium group, and an emulsion stabilizer and water is prepared.<br>
This process is roughly classified into the following three kinds of (i), (ii) and (iii), but any of them may be used, or a combination thereof may be<br>
12<br><br>
used.<br>
(i) An aqueous suspension of a food additive composed of a magnesium ingredient or a magnesium group and water is subjected to grinding and/or dispersing treatment by a chemical dispersing method, or a physical method using a" grinding machine and/or a dispersing machine, followed by treatment by addition of an emulsion stabilizer.<br>
(ii) An aqueous suspension of a food additive composed of a magnesium ingredient or a magnesium group, an emulsion stabilizer and water is subjected to grinding and/or dispersing treatment by a chemical dispersing method, or a physical method using a grinding machine and/or a dispersing machine.<br>
(iii) An aqueous suspension of a food additive composed of a magnesium ingredient or a magnesium group and water is subjected to grinding and/or dispersing treatment by a chemical dispersing method, or a physical method using a grinding machine and/or a dispersing machine, an emulsion stabilizer is added, and the resulting mixture is subjected to grinding and/or dispersing treatment by a physical method using a grinding machine and/or a dispersing machine.<br>
In the aforementioned (i), (ii) and (iii), the indispensable condition for preparing a food additive slurry composition of a magnesium ingredient or a magnesium group, an emulsion stabilizer and water is that an emulsion stabilizer is contained in an amount of 2 to 55 parts by weight relative to 100 parts by weight of a magnesium ingredient or a magnesium group in the food additive slurry composition and, when eating feeling such as passing throat and the like in liquid foods such as yogurt, cow's milk and the like is taken<br>
13<br><br>
into consideration, an emulsion stabilizer is contained preferably in an amount of 3 to 45 parts by weight, more preferably in an amount of 4 to 30 parts by weight.<br>
In the case of an amount of an emulsion stabilizer being smaller than 2 parts by weight, even if a weight average diameter in a particle size distribution of a magnesium ingredient or a magnesium group in a food additive slurry composition is adjusted to very fine, when the food additive slurry composition is used by adding to foods such as cow's milk, juice, drink type yogurt and the like, the stability with time of a magnesium ingredient or a magnesium group in foods is deteriorated and, in a worse case, a magnesium ingredient or a magnesium group is aggregated and settled on a bottom of a food container within 24 hours.    On the other hand, when an amount of an emulsion stabilizer exceeds 55 parts by weight, when the food additive slurry composition is used by adding to foods such as cow's milk, juice, drink type yogurt and the like, not only a viscosity of products is increased and eating feeling is not preferable, but also as a viscosity of foods is increased, manufacturing at the high concentration becomes difficult in handling, and manufacturing must be performed at the decreased solid matter concentration, thus being not preferable in an economical respect.<br>
A magnesium ion content M (mg/1) in the food additive slurry composition used in the present invention complies with preferably the following (a) requirement, more preferably the following (b) requirement, further preferably the following (c) requirement.    When a magnesium ion content M (mg/1) is smaller than 5, since the surface stability of a magnesium ingredient or a magnesium group becomes deteriorated, and a magnesium<br>
14<br><br>
ingredient or a magnesium group becomes easy to re-aggregate, there is a<br>
tendency that stable products are difficult to be obtained when used in cow's<br>
milk or the like.    On the other hand, when M exceeds 1000, there is a<br>
tendency that a flavor such as bitterness is remarkably deteriorated when<br>
used in cow's milk or the like, thus being not preferable.<br>
(a)5<m></m>
(b)7<m></m>
(c)l0
M: a magnesium content (mg/1) of a solution obtained by adjusting a food<br>
additive slurry after grinding and/or dispersing to 10% by weight, performing<br>
centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes, and filtering the resulting<br>
supernatant with a 0.8  m filter<br>
In addition, a magnesium ion content in the present invention was measured and calculated by the following details: <br>
Kind of a measuring machine: atomic absorption spectrophotometer AA- 6700 F manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation.  .<br>
Preparation of a sample: A sample is obtained by adjusting a food additive slurry after grinding and/or dispersing to 10% by weight, performing centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes, and filtering the resulting supernatant with a 0.8  m filter.<br>
Solvent: distilled water<br>
A weight average diameter K( m) in a particle size distribution of a magnesium ingredient or a magnesium group in a food additive slurry composition should comply with preferably the following (a) requirement and, in food uses requiring the fairly long term storage dispersion stability,<br>
15<br><br>
preferably (p) requirement, further preferably ( ) requirement, ( ) 0.1  
When a weight average diameter in a particle size distribution of a magnesium ingredient or a magnesium group in a food additive slurry composition is larger than 1.0  m, since a particle is easily settled, these food additive slurry compositions can not be used in uses of foods which can be stored for a long term.   As a method of adjusting a weight average diameter in a particle size distribution of a magnesium ingredient or a magnesium group in a food additive slurry composition to 1.0  m or smaller, the aforementioned method may be used.    Regarding a grinding and/or dispersing method by a physical method, a wet grinding machine such as a dino mill, a sand mill, a cobor mill and the like, an emulsifying and dispersing apparatus such as a nanomizer, a microfluidizer, homogenizer and the like, and a roll mill such as an ultrasonic dispersing machine and the like can be preferably used.<br>
A weight average diameter in a particle size distribution of a magnesium ingredient or a magnesium group in the food additive slurry composition in the present invention is measured and calculated by the following details :<br>
Kind of a measuring machine : SA-CP4L manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation<br>
Preparation of a sample: A food additive slurry composition is added dropwise to the following solvent at 20°C to obtain a sample for measuring a<br>
16<br><br>
particle size distribution.<br>
Solvent: Ion-exchanged water<br>
Preliminary dispersion: Ultrasonic dispersion for 100 seconds using an SK disperser (manufactured by Seishinkigyo)<br>
Measuring temperature: 20.0°C ±2.5°C<br>
The food additive powder composition of the present invention is prepared by drying and powdering the thus prepared food additive slurry composition of at least one selected from the group consisting of a magnesium ingredient or a magnesium group, an emulsion stabilizer and water. Regarding drying of a food additive slurry composition, a dryer is not particularly limited, but from a viewpoint of prevention of denaturation of various surface treating agents, it is preferable to perform drying in an extremely short time.    From this viewpoint, as a dryer, it is desirable to use a droplet spraying - type dryer such as a spray dryer, a slurry dryer and the like using a ceramic medium in the heat flowing state, and the like.<br>
The food additive slurry composition or powder composition prepared by the aforementioned process has the extremely excellent re-dispersibility in water, and is easily dispersed in water without using a special dispersing machine, a stirrer or the like.<br>
Therefore, in order to prepare a food, for example, a magnesium - enriched cow's milk using the food additive slurry composition and/or powder composition of the present invention, it is enough that the food additive slurry composition and/or powder composition of the present invention is added directly to cow's milk to vigorously stir them, to disperse the food additive slurry composition and/or powder composition in cow's milk, and it is also<br>
17<br><br>
enough that an aqueous dispersion of a magnesium ingredient or a magnesium group obtained, in advance, by dispersing the food additive slurry-composition and/or powder composition in water is added to cow's milk.    In addition, in a reduced milk, the food additive slurry composition or powder composition of the present invention is added to a butter or a butter oil which has been melted at a temperature of around 60°C, the materials are stirred at a high speed to disperse them and, then, reduced defatted milk or defatted milk may be added to homogenize them.<br>
In the magnesium enriched cow's milk prepared by these methods, an amount of magnesium to be removed with a clarifier is considerably reduced as compared with the case where a magnesium ingredient prepared by the conventional method is added.    That is, magnesium is extremely stably retained in cow's milk, yogurt, juices to which the food additive slurry composition and/or powder composition of the present invention is added.    In addition, since the food additive slurry composition and/or powder composition of the present invention has the better magnesium dispersibility, a stirring time may be short upon addition to cow's milk or the like. Therefore, aggregation of magnesium which is seen when stirred in a butter for a long time does not occur.    Besides the aforementioned uses, the food additive slurry composition and/or powder composition of the present invention can be used for the purpose of enriching magnesium in liquid foods such as cream, coffee, tea, oolong tea, bean milk, sports drink, near water and the like, alcohol drinks such as wine, sake and the like, foods such as cheese, gum, bread, confectionery, noodles and the like, and tablets and the like.<br>
The food additive slurry composition or powder composition of the<br>
18<br><br>
present invention may be used jointly with a dispersion of a water-hardly soluble calcium salt such as calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate and the like, water-soluble calcium salt such as calcium lactate, calcium chloride and the like and/or water-soluble magnesium salt such as magnesium chloride, magnesium sulfate and the like.<br>
