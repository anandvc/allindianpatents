				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR METERING CATALYST<br>
IN A FLUID CATALYTIC CRACKING CATALYST<br>
INJECTION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] Embodiments of the invention generally relate to a method and<br>
apparatus for metering catalyst in a fluid catalytic cracking catalyst injection<br>
system and the like.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
[0002] Figure 1 is a simplified schematic of one embodiment of a<br>
conventional fluid catalytic cracking system 130. The fluid catalytic cracking<br>
system 130 includes a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit 110 coupled to a<br>
catalyst injection system 100, an oil feed stock source 104, an exhaust system<br>
114 and a distillation system 116. One or more catalysts from the catalyst<br>
injection system 100 and oil from the oil feed stock source 104 are delivered to<br>
the FCC unit 110. The oil and catalysts are combined to produce an oil vapor<br>
that is collected and separated into various petrochemical products in the<br>
distillation system 116. The exhaust system 114 is coupled to the FCC unit 110<br>
and is adapted to control and/or monitor the exhausted byproducts of the fluid<br>
cracking process.<br>
[0003] The catalyst injection system 100 may include a main catalyst injector<br>
102 and one or more additive injectors 106. The main catalyst injector 102 and<br>
the additive injector 106 are coupled to the FCC unit 110 by a process line 122.<br>
A fluid source, such as a blower or air compressor 108, is coupled to the process<br>
line 122 and provides pressurized fluid, such as air, that is utilized to carry the<br>
various powdered catalysts from the injectors 102, 106 through the process line<br>
122 where they are combined with oil from the oil feed stock source 104 and<br>
delivered into the FCC unit 110.<br>
[0004] Figure 2 is one embodiment of a conventional additive injector 106.<br>
The additive injector 106 includes a pressure vessel 220 and a low pressure<br>
storage vessel 240. The pressure vessel 220 is coupled to one or more load<br>
cells 210 for weighing the catalyst that will be introduced into the FCC unit 110<br>
through the process line 122. In operation, the catalyst is dispensed into the<br>
pressure vessel 220 at atmospheric pressure from the low pressure storage<br>
vessel 240. The pressure vessel 220 is subsequently welghed to deterirnine the<br>
amount of catalyst loaded therein. The pressure vessel 220 is then pressurized<br>
by a pressure control device 228 coupled to the vessel 220 to a level that<br>
facilitates movement of the pressurized catalyst into process line 122 and then<br>
into the FCC unit 110. If the pressure vessel 220 is supported by any of the<br>
structural components surrounding it, other than the load cells 210 (such as<br>
pipes, electrical conduits, and the like), those components will prevent the load<br>
cells 210 from accurately measuring the weight of catalyst added to the pressure<br>
vessel 220, and ultimately into the FCC unit 100. Therefore, in order to obtain a<br>
reasonably accurate measure of the catalyst, the pressure vessel 220 must not<br>
be supported by other components of the system.<br>
[0005] To isolate the pressure vessel 220 from the components coupled<br>
thereto, flexible connectors, such as bellows 230, are used to couple the<br>
pressure vessel 220 to the low pressure vessel 240, the process line 122, and<br>
other surrounding components. The bellows 230 allow the pressure vessel 220<br>
to "float" on the load cells 210 so a more accurate reading may be obtained.<br>
However, use of flexible bellows 230 does not reliably insure accurate weight<br>
measurement of the pressure vessel 220. For example, the weight of the<br>
pressure vessel 220 is still slightly supported by the flexible bellows 230 - a<br>
problem compounded by the fact that a plurality of bellows 230 must be utilized<br>
to isolate the pressure vessel 220 from the various components coupled thereto.<br>
Therefore, the determination of the weight of the catalyst added to the pressure<br>
vessel 220 is still not accurate. Moreover, due to the operating pressures and<br>
potentially explosive atmosphere, bellows meeting operational standards are<br>
quite expensive and wear quickly, resulting in the drift of weight readings,<br>
catalyst dust leaks and associated environmental issues, as well as<br>
necessitating costly process downtime and bellows replacement.<br>
[0006] Figure 3 is another embodiment of an additive injector 300. The<br>
injector 300 includes a high pressure storage vessel 340 coupled by a metering<br>
valve 330 to the process line 122. The metering valve 330 may be actuated to<br>
allow a predefined amount of catalyst to be introduced into the process line 122<br>
and combine with the oil from the oil feed stock source 104 before entering the<br>
FCC unit 110. The high pressure storage vessel 340 contains a bulk supply of<br>
catalyst, for example, from about 1 to about 20 tons of catalyst, and is<br>
maintained at a pressure between about 50 to about 60 pounds per square inch<br>
(psi) by a pressure control device 320. As such, the pressure vessel 340 Is<br>
subject to regulatory construction standards which cause the vessel to be<br>
relatively expensive as compared to a comparably sized, low pressure storage<br>
vessel. The high pressure vessel 340 is coupled to a plurality of load cells 310<br>
which enable the weight of the high pressure storage vessel 340 to be<br>
determined. The weight of the catalyst injected is determined by comparing the<br>
weight of the high pressure storage vessel 340 before and after catalyst<br>
injection.<br>
[0007] Metering catalyst in the manner described with reference to Figure 3<br>
eliminates the need for bellows used to isolate the pressure vessel. However,<br>
large high pressure storage vessels are very expensive. Therefore, there is a<br>
need for a method and apparatus for metering catalyst in a fluid catalytic<br>
cracking catalyst injection system that minimizes the cost of ownership.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0008] A method and apparatus for metering catalyst in a fluid catalytic<br>
cracking catalyst injection system are provided. In one embodiment, apparatus<br>
for metering catalyst in a fluid catalytic cracking catalyst injection system<br>
includes a low pressure storage vessel coupled to a pressure vessel that defines<br>
a high pressure side of the apparatus where the determination of the amount of<br>
catalyst transferred is made on the low pressure side of the apparatus.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0019] Figure 4 depicts one embodiment of a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)<br>
system 400 comprising an injection system 402 and oil feed stock source 450<br>
coupled to an FCC unit 424. The FCC unit 424 is adapted to promote catalytic<br>
cracking of petroleum feed stock provided from the source 450 and may be<br>
configured in a conventional manner. The injection system 402 is coupled to the<br>
FCC unit 424 and is configured to inject one or more catalysts into the FCC unit<br>
424 to control processing attributes such as the ratio of products recovered in a<br>
distiller of the FCC unit 424 and/or to control the emissions from the FCC unit<br>
424. The injection system 402 includes a control module 404 to control the rates<br>
and/or amounts of catalyst provided to the FCC unit 424 by the injection system<br>
402.<br>
[0020] The control module 404 has a central processing unit (CPU) 460,<br>
memory 462, and support circuits 464. The CPU 460 may be one of any form of<br>
computer processor that can be used in an industrial setting for controlling<br>
various chambers and subprocessors. The memory 462 is coupled to the CPU<br>
460. The memory 462, or computer-readable medium, may be one or more of<br>
readily available memory such as random access memory (RAM), read only<br>
memory (ROM), floppy disk, hard disk, or any other form of digital storage, local<br>
or remote. The support circuits 464 are coupled to the CPU 460 for supporting<br>
the processor in a conventional manner. These circuits include cache, power<br>
supplies, clock circuits, input/output circuitry, subsystems, and the like. In one<br>
embodiment, the control module 404 is a programmable logic controller (PLC),<br>
such as those available from GE Fanuc. However, from the disclosure herein,<br>
those skilled in the art will realize that other control modules such as<br>
microcontrollers, microprocessors, programmable gate arrays, and application<br>
specific integrated circuits (ASICs) may be used to perform the controlling<br>
functions of the control module 404. One control module 404 that may be<br>
adapted to benefit from the invention is described in the previously incorporated<br>
United States Patent Applications, Serial Nos. 10/304,670 and 10/320,064.<br>
[0021] In one embodiment, the injection system 402 includes a storage<br>
vessel 440 coupled to a metering device 408. The metering device 408 is<br>
coupled to the control module 404 so that an amount of catalyst delivered to the<br>
FCC unit 424 may be monitored and/or metered. The storage vessel 440 is a<br>
container adapted to store catalyst therein at substantially atmospheric<br>
pressures and has an operational pressure of between about zero to about 30<br>
pounds per square inch. The storage vessel 440 has a fill port 442 and a<br>
discharge port 434. The discharge port 434 is typically positioned at or near a<br>
bottom of the storage vessel 440.<br>
[0022] The metering device 408 is coupled to the discharge port 434 to<br>
control the amount of catalyst transferred from the storage vessel 440 to the<br>
pressure vessel 420 through a catalyst delivery line 414. The metering device<br>
408 may be a shut-off valve, rotary valve, mass flow controller, pressure vessel,<br>
flow sensor, positive displacement pump, or other device suitable for regulating<br>
the amount of catalyst dispensed from the storage vessel 440 into the pressure<br>
vessel 420 for injection into the FCC unit 424. The metering device 408 may<br>
determine the amount of catalyst supplied by weight, volume, time of dispense,<br>
or by other means. Depending on the catalyst requiremelits of the FCC system<br>
400, the metering device 408 may be configured to provide from about 5 to<br>
about 4000 pounds per day of additive-type catalysts (process control catalyst)<br>
or may be configured to provide from about 1 to about 20 tons per day of main<br>
catalyst. The metering device 408 typically delivers catalysts over the course of<br>
a planned production cycle, typically 24 hours, in multiple shots of predetermined<br>
amounts spaced over the production cycle. However, catalysts may also be<br>
added in an "as needed" basis. In the embodiment depicted in Figure 4, the<br>
metering device 408 is a control valve 432 that regulates the amount of catalyst<br>
delivered from the storage vessel 440 to the FCC unit 424 by a timed actuation.<br>
Control valves suitable for use as a metering device are available from InterCat<br>
Equipment Inc., located in Sea Girt, New Jersey.<br>
[0023] The injection system 402 may also include one or more sensors for<br>
providing a metric suitable for determining the amount of catalyst passing<br>
through the metering device 408 during each transfer of catalyst to the pressure<br>
vessel 420. The sensors may be configured to detect the level (i.e., volume) of<br>
catalyst in the storage vessel 440, the weight of catalyst in the storage vessel<br>
440, the rate of catalyst movement through the storage vessel 440, discharge<br>
port 434, metering device 408, and/or catalyst delivery line 414, or the like.<br>
[0024] In the embodiment depicted in Figure 4, the sensor is a plurality of<br>
load cells 410 adapted to provide a metric indicative of the weight of catalyst in<br>
the storage vessel 440. The load cells 410 are respectively coupled to a plurality<br>
of legs 438 that support the storage vessel 440 above a mounting surface 430.<br>
Each of the legs 438 has one of the plurality of load cells 410 coupled thereto.<br>
From sequential data samples obtained from the load cells 410, the control<br>
module 404 may resolve the net amount of transferred catalyst after each<br>
actuation of the metering device 408 (e.g., the control valve 432). Additionally,<br>
the cumulative amount of catalyst dispensed over the course of the production<br>
cycle may be monitored so that variations in the amount of catalyst dispensed in<br>
each individual cycle may be compensated for by adjusting the delivery<br>
attributes of the metering device 408, for example, by changing the open time of<br>
the control valve 432 to allow more (or less) catalyst to pass therethrough and<br>
into the pressure vessel 420 for ultimate injection into the FCC unit 424.<br>
[0025] Alternatively, the sensor may be a level sensor (not shown) coupled to<br>
the storage vessel 440 and adapted to detect a metric indicative of the level of<br>
catalyst within the storage vessel 440. The level sensor may be an optical<br>
transducer, a capacitance device, a sonic transducer or other device suitable for<br>
providing information from which the level or volume of catalyst disposed in the<br>
storage vessel 440 may be resolved. By utilizing sensed differences in the<br>
levels of catalyst disposed within the storage vessel 440 between dispenses, the<br>
amount of catalyst injected may be resolved for a known storage vessel<br>
geometry.<br>
[0026] Alternatively, the sensor may be a flow sensor (not shown) adapted to<br>
detect the flow of catalyst through one of the components of the catalyst injection<br>
system 402. The flow sensor maybe a contact or non-contact device and may<br>
be mounted to the storage vessel 440 or the catalyst delivery line 414 coupling<br>
the storage vessel 440 to the pressure vessel 420. For example, the flow sensor<br>
may be a sonic flow meter or capacitance device adapted to detect the rate of<br>
entrained particles (i.e., catalyst) moving through the catalyst delivery line 414.<br>
[0027] Although the injection system 402 described above is shown<br>
configured to provide catalyst from a single low pressure storage vessel 440, the<br>
invention contemplates utilizing one or more injection systems coupled to the<br>
FCC unit 424 to introduce multiple catalysts from a plurality of storage vessels.<br>
Each of these injection systems may be controlled by either common or<br>
independent control modules.<br>
[0028] The pressure vessel 420 is rigidly coupled to the mounting surface<br>
430, as load cells are not needed to determine the weight of the pressure vessel<br>
420. The term "rigidly" is to include mounting devices, such as vibration<br>
dampers and the like, but to exclude mounting devices that "float" the pressure<br>
vessel to facilitate weight measurement thereof. The pressure vessel 420 has<br>
an operational pressure of about 0 to about 100 pounds per square inch, and is<br>
coupled to a fluid source 406 by a first conduit 418. The first conduit 418<br>
includes a shut-off valve 416 that selectively isolates the fluid source 406 from<br>
the pressure vessel 420. A second conduit 422 couples the pressure vessel 420<br>
to the FCC unit 424 and includes a second shut-off valve 426 that selectively<br>
isolates the pressure vessel 420 substantially from the FCC unit 424. The shut-<br>
off valves 416 and 426 are generally closed to allow the pressure vessel 420 to<br>
be filled with catalyst from the storage vessel 440 at substantially atmospheric<br>
pressure.<br>
[0029] Once the catalyst is dispensed into the pressure vessel 420, the<br>
control valve 432 is closed and the interior of the pressure vessel 420 is<br>
pressurized by a pressure control system 428 to a level that facilitates injection<br>
of the catalyst from the pressure vessel 420 into the FCC unit 424, typically at<br>
least about 20 pounds per square inch. After the loaded pressure vessel 420 is<br>
pressurized by the pressure control system 428, the shut-off valves 416 and 426<br>
are opened, allowing air or other fluid provided by the fluid source 406 to enter<br>
the pressure vessel 420 through the first conduit 418 and carry the catalyst out<br>
of the pressure vessel 420 through the second conduit 422 to the FCC unit 424.<br>
In one embodiment, the fluid source 406 provides air at about 60 to about 100<br>
psi (about 4.2 to about 7.0 kg/cm2).<br>
[0030] In operation, the injection system 402 periodically dispenses and<br>
injects a known quantity of catalyst into the FCC unit 424. Catalyst is filled into<br>
the low pressure storage vessel 440 through the fill port 442 located in an upper<br>
portion of the storage vessel 440. The weight of the storage vessel, including<br>
any catalyst residing therein, is obtained by interpreting data obtained from the<br>
load cells 410.<br>
[0031] In one embodiment, a predefined quantity of catalyst in the storage<br>
vessel 440 is transferred into the pressure vessel 420 by selectively opening the<br>
control valve 432 for a defined amount of time. After the catalyst has been<br>
transferred, the weight of the storage vessel 440 is obtained once again, and the<br>
exact quantity of catalyst added determined by subtracting the current weight<br>
from the previous measurement. Once the catalyst is transferred to the pressure<br>
vessel 420, the pressure inside the pressure vessel 420 is elevated by the<br>
pressure control system 428 to, typically, at least about 20 psi. After operating<br>
pressure is reached, valves 416 and 426 are opened. This allows fluid supplied<br>
by the fluid source 406, typically air at approximately 60 psi, to flow through the<br>
pressure vessel 420 and carry the catalyst to the FCC unit 424.<br>
[0032] This metering system is advantageous over the prior art in numerous<br>
respects. For example, bulk storage of the catalyst at high pressure is not<br>
required, thereby allowing the storage vessel 440 to be fabricated less<br>
expensively as compared to pressurized bulk storage containers of some<br>
conventional systems. Furthermore, as the determination of the amount of<br>
catalyst being dispensed is made at the low pressure side of the system 402<br>
(e.g., in the low pressure storage vessel or conduit between the storage vessel<br>
and pressure vessel), the pressure vessel 420 does not need to be isolated by<br>
bellows in order to obtain catalyst weight information, allowing for more accurate<br>
weight readings as well as a more robust and less costly system.<br>
[0033] Figure 5 depicts another embodiment of a fluid catalytic cracking<br>
(FCC) system 500 comprising an injection system 502 and oil feed stock source<br>
450 coupled to an FCC unit 424. The injection system 502 is adapted to provide<br>
multiple catalysts to the FCC unit 424. The injection system 502 includes a<br>
control module 404 for controlling the rates and/or amounts of catalyst provided<br>
to the FCC unit 424 by the injection system 502, a fluid handler 406 for injecting<br>
the catalyst into the FCC unit 424, and a pressure vessel 420 coupled to a<br>
plurality of storage vessels, illustratively shown in one embodiment as a first low<br>
pressure storage vessel 440 and a second low pressure storage vessel 510. It<br>
is contemplated that any number of low pressure storage vessels may be<br>
coupled to a single pressure vessel 420 for injection catalyst at a higher<br>
pressure.<br>
[0034] The storage vessels 440, 510 may be configured to deliver the same<br>
or different catalysts to the FCC unit 424 and operate substantially similar to<br>
storage vessel 440, described above. The storage vessels 440, 510 are coupled<br>
to a manifold 530 which directs the plurality of catalysts to a common catalyst<br>
delivery line 414 for delivery into the pressure vessel 420. Alternately, each<br>
storage vessel 440, 510 can be independently coupled to the pressure vessel<br>
420. Each storage vessel 440, 510 is coupled to an independent metering<br>
device 432, 520 which controls the amount of catalyst delivered from each<br>
storage vessel 440, 510 to the pressure vessel 420 for injection into the FCC<br>
unit 424. In one embodiment, the metering device 520 is configured similar to<br>
the metering device 432 described above. In this configuration, the system 502<br>
is capable of sequentially providing catalyst from a predefined one of the storage<br>
vessels 440, 510, or alternatively, blending measured amounts from each<br>
storage vessel 440, 510 in the pressure vessel 420 for injecting into the FCC unit<br>
424 in a single shot.<br>
[0035] Figure 6 depicts a flow diagram of one embodiment of a method 600<br>
for metering catalyst in a FCC catalyst injection system. The method 600 is<br>
generally stored in the memory of the control module 404, typically as a software<br>
routine. The software routine may also be stored and/or executed by a second<br>
CPU (not shown) that is remotely located from the hardware being controlled by<br>
the control module 404. Although the method 600 is discussed as being<br>
implemented as a software routine, some of the method steps that are disclosed<br>
therein may be performed in hardware as well as by the software controller, or<br>
manually. As such, the invention may be implemented in software as executed<br>
upon a computer system, in hardware as an application specific integrated<br>
circuit, or other type of hardware implementation, manually, or a combination of<br>
software, hardware, and/or manual steps.<br>
[0036] The method 600 begins at step 602 where the catalyst is metered from<br>
a low pressure storage vessel 440 to a pressure vessel 420. In this step, the<br>
metering and determination of catalyst transferred to the pressure vessel 420 is<br>
performed outside the pressure vessel 420 by the metering device 408. For<br>
example, in the embodiment depicted in Figure 4, step 602 is performed by the<br>
combination of the metering device 408 and the load cells 410 supporting the<br>
storage vessel 440 being utilized to determine the amount of catalyst transferred<br>
to the pressure vessel 420. The catalyst is dispensed from the storage vessel<br>
440 into the pressure vessel 420 by temporarily opening the control valve 432.<br>
The weight of the storage vessel 440 is measured both before and after<br>
dispensing the catalyst by interpreting the output of the load cells 410 coupled to<br>
the legs 438 which support the storage vessel 440. The amount of catalyst<br>
transferred to the pressure vessel 420 is the difference between the weight of<br>
the storage vessel 440 before and after dispensing the catalyst. Alternatively, as<br>
discussed above, the catalyst metering device 408 may be a shut-off valve,<br>
rotary valve, mass flow controller, pressure vessel, flow sensor, positive<br>
displacement pump, or other device suitable for regulating the amount of catalyst<br>
dispensed from the storage vessel 440 for delivery to the FCC unit 424.<br>
[0037] At step 604, the pressure vessel 420 containing the catalyst is<br>
pressurized by the pressure control system 428 to between about 10 to about<br>
100 pounds per square inch. At step 606, the pressurized catalyst is injected<br>
into the FCC unit 424. In this step, valves 416, 427 open which allow the<br><br>
catalyst to be carried to the FCC unit 424 in a stream of fluid provided by the<br>
fluid source 406. In the embodiment depicted in Figure 4, the pressure vessel<br>
420 is pressurized to at least about 10 psi by the pressure control system 428.<br>
Once the pressure has been reached, valves 416 and 426 are opened, allowing<br>
the fluid in the first and second conduits 418, 422 to carry the catalyst into the<br>
FCC unit 424.<br>
[0038] Figure 7 depicts a flow diagram of one embodiment of a method 700<br>
for metering catalyst in a FCC catalyst injection system. The method 700 begins<br>
at step 702 where a first catalyst is dispensed from a first low pressure storage<br>
vessel 440 to a pressure vessel 420 using a metering device 432, wherein the<br>
metering device determines the quantity of the first catalyst dispensed with,<br>
respect to the first storage vessel. At step 704, the pressure vessel 420<br>
containing the first catalyst is pressurized. Then, at step 706, the pressurized<br>
catalyst is injected into a FCC unit 424.<br>
[0039] The method continues at step 708, where a second catalyst is<br>
metered from a second low pressure storage vessel 510 to the pressure vessel<br>
420 using a metering device 520, wherein the metering device determines the<br>
quantity of the second catalyst dispensed with respect to the second storage<br>
vessel. At step 710, the pressure vessel 420 containing the second catalyst is<br>
pressurized and finally, at step 712, the pressurized second catalyst is injected<br>
into the FCC unit 424. The method 700 contemplates the use of additional low<br>
pressure vessel which load the pressure vessel 420 in a predefined order, or as<br>
needed.<br>
[0040] Figure 8 depicts a flow diagram of one embodiment of a method 800<br>
for metering catalyst in a FCC catalyst injection system. In this method,<br>
beginning at step 802, a first catalyst is metered from a first low pressure storage<br>
vessel 440 to a pressure vessel 420 using a metering device 432, wherein the<br>
metering device determines the quantity of the first catalyst dispensed with<br>
respect to the first storage vessel. At step 804, a second catalyst is metered<br>
from a second low pressure storage vessel 510 to the pressure vessel 420 using<br>
a metering device 520, wherein the metering device determines the quantity of<br>
the second catalyst dispensed with respect to the second storage vessel. At<br>
step 806, the pressure vessel 420 containing the first and second catalysts is<br>
pressurized and at step 808, the pressurized catalysts are injected into the FCC<br>
unit 424 as a single shot of catalyst.' The method 800 contemplates the use of<br>
additional low pressure vessels which may provide mixtures of different catalyst<br>
as needed or per a predefined process sequence.<br>
[0041] The methods described in Figures 7 and 8 allow for multiple catalysts<br>
to be injected into the FCC unit as needed. For example, one catalyst may<br>
control emissions from the cracking process and another catalyst may control<br>
the resultant product mix produced by the FCC unit. This allowed greater<br>
process flexibility with reduced capital expenditures.<br>
[0042] Thus, an injection system has been provided that facilitates more<br>
accurate metering of catalyst and reduces problems associated with bellows<br>
used in some injection systems of the prior art. Moreover, the inventive system<br>
is compatible with existing low pressure storage vessels and does not require<br>
expensive bellows to isolate the pressure vessel. Therefore the inventive<br>
system is substantially less expensive than the injection systems of the prior art.<br>
[0043] Although the teachings of the present invention have been shown and<br>
described in detail herein, those skilled in the art can readily devise other varied<br>
embodiments that still incorporate the teachings and do not depart from the<br>
scope and spirit of the invention.<br>
