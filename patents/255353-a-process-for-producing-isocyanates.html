				<td>A PROCESS FOR PRODUCING ISOCYANATES<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing isocyanate.<br>
Background Art<br>
Isocyanates are widely used as production raw materials of such<br>
products as polyurethane foam, paints and adhesives. The main industrial<br>
production process of isocyanates involves reacting amines with phosgene<br>
(phosgene method), and nearly the entire amount of isocyanates produced<br>
throughout the world are produced according to the phosgene method.<br>
However, the phosgene method has numerous problems.<br>
Firstly, this method requires the use of a large amount of phosgene as<br>
raw material. Phosgene is extremely toxic and requires special handling<br>
precautions to prevent exposure of handlers thereof, and also requires special<br>
apparatuses to detoxify waste.<br>
Secondly, since highly corrosive hydrogen chloride is produced in large<br>
amounts as a by-product of the phosgene method, in addition to requiring a<br>
process for detoxifying the hydrogen chloride, in many cases hydrolytic<br>
chlorine is contained in the isocyanates produced, which may have a<br>
detrimental effect on the weather resistance and heat resistance of<br>
polyurethane products in the case of using isocyanates produced using the<br>
phosgene method.<br>
On the basis of this background, a process for producing isocyanates<br><br>
has been sought that does not use phosgene. One example of a method for<br>
producing isocyanate compounds without using phosgene that has been<br>
proposed involves thermal decomposition, of carbamic acid esters.<br>
Isocyanates and hydroxy compounds have long been known to be obtained by<br>
thermal decomposition of carbamic acid esters (see, for example, Berchte der<br>
Deutechen Chemischen Geselischaft, Vol. 3, p. 653, 1870). The basic<br>
reaction is illustrated by the following formula:<br>
R(NHCOOR')a ----------&gt; R(NCO)a + a R'OH	(1)<br>
(wherein R represents an organic residue having a valence of a, R' represents<br>
a monovalent organic residue, and a represents an integer of 1 or more).<br>
The thermal decomposition reaction represented by the<br>
above-mentioned formula is reversible, and in contrast to the equilibrium<br>
thereof being towards the carbamic acid ester on the left side at low<br>
temperatures, the isocyanate and hydroxy compound side becomes<br>
predominant at high temperatures. Thus, it is necessary to carry out the<br>
carbamic acid ester thermal decomposition reaction at high temperatures. In<br>
addition, in the case of alkyl carbamates in particular, since the reaction rate is<br>
faster for the reverse reaction of thermal decomposition, namely the reaction<br>
by which alkyl carbamate is formed from isocyanate and alcohol, the carbamic<br>
acid ester ends up being formed before the isocyanate and alcohol formed by<br>
thermal decomposition are separated, thereby frequently leading to an<br>
apparent difficulty in the progression of the thermal decomposition reaction.<br>
On the other hand, thermal decomposition of alkyl carbamates is<br>
susceptible to the simultaneous occurrence of various irreversible side<br>
reactions such as thermal denaturation reactions undesirable for alkyl<br><br>
carbamates or condensation of isocyanates formed by the thermal<br>
decomposition. Examples of these side reactions include a reaction in which<br>
urea bonds are formed as represented by the following formula (2), a reaction<br>
in which carbodiimides are formed as represented by the following formula (3),<br>
and a reaction in which isocyanurates are formed as represented by the<br>
following formula (4) (see, Berchte der Deutechen Chemischen Gesellschaft,<br>
Vol. 3, p. 653, 1870 and Journal of American Chemical Society, Vol. 81, p.<br>
2138, 1959):<br><br>
In addition to these side reactions leading to a decrease in yield and<br>
selectivity of the target isocyanate, in the production of polyisocyanates in<br>
particular, these reactions may make long-term operation difficult as a result of,<br>
for example, causing the precipitation of polymeric solids that clog the reaction<br>
vessel.<br>
Various methods have been proposed to solve such problems. For<br>
example, a method for producing polyisocyanate has been proposed in which<br>
an alkyl polycarbamate, in which ester groups are composed of alkoxy groups<br>
corresponding to a primary alcohol, is subjected to a transesterification<br>
reaction with a secondary alcohol to produce an alkyl polycarbamate in which<br>
the ester groups are composed of alkoxy groups corresponding to the<br>
secondary alcohol, followed by thermal decomposition of the alkyl<br><br>
polycarbamate (see, for example, International Publication No. WO 95/23484).<br>
It is described in this method that the thermal decomposition temperature of<br>
the alkyl polycarbamate can be set to a lower temperature by going through an<br>
alkyl polycarbamate in which the ester groups are composed of alkoxy groups<br>
corresponding to the secondary alcohol, thereby resulting in the effect of being<br>
able to inhibit precipitation of polymeric solid. However, the reverse reaction<br>
rate between the polyisocyanate formed by the thermal decomposition reaction<br>
of the alkyl polycarbamate and the secondary alcohol is still fast, thereby<br>
leaving the problem of inhibiting the formation of alkyl polycarbamate by the<br>
reverse reaction unsolved.<br>
An alternative method has been disclosed whereby, in the production of<br>
aromatic isocyanates, for example, an aromatic alkyl polycarbamate and an<br>
aromatic hydroxy compound are subjected to a transesterification reaction to<br>
produce an aromatic aryl polycarbamate followed by thermal decomposition of<br>
the aromatic aryl polycarbamate to product an aromatic isocyanate (see, for<br>
example, US Patent No. 3,992,430). This method describes the effect of<br>
being able to set the thermal decomposition temperature to a lower<br>
temperature by going through an aromatic aryl polycarbamate. However, in<br>
the case of this aromatic aryl polycarbamate as well, under temperatures like<br>
those at which the transesterification reaction or thermal decomposition<br>
reaction is carried out, there are many cases in which side reactions like those<br>
described above still occur, there leaving the problem of improving isocyanate<br>
yield unsolved. Moreover, thermal decomposition of N-substituted aromatic<br>
urethanes in the gaseous phase or liquid phase is known to frequently result in<br>
the occurrence of various undesirable side reactions (see, for example, US<br><br>

Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
As has been described above, there are currently hardly any methods for<br>
industrially producing polyisocyanates at favorable yield without using<br>
extremely toxic phosgene.<br>

A known method can be used to produce the carbamic acid esters. For<br>
example, carbamic esters may be produced by reacting amine compounds<br>
with carbon monoxide, oxygen and aliphatic alcohols or aromatic hydroxy<br>
compounds, or reacting amine compounds with urea and aliphatic alcohols or<br>
aromatic hydroxy compounds. In the present embodiment, the carbamic acid<br>
esters are preferably produced by reacting carbonic acid esters and amine<br>
compounds.<br>
The following provides an explanation of the production of alkyl<br><br>
carbamates by reacting dialkyl carbonates and amine compounds.<br>
Dialkyl carbonates represented by the following formula (21) can be used<br>
for the dialkyl carbonates:<br><br>
(wherein R17 represents a linear or branched alkyl group having 1 to 8 carbon<br>
atoms).<br>
Examples of R17 include alkyl groups in a form of aliphatic hydrocarbon<br>
groups in which the number of carbon atoms constituting the group is a<br>
number selected from an integer of 1 to 8, such as a methyl group, an ethyl<br>
group, a propyl group (isomers), a butyl group (isomers), a pentyl group<br>
(isomers), a hexyl group (isomers), a heptyl group (isomers), an octyl group<br>
(isomers) or the like. Examples of such dialkyl carbonates include dimethyl<br>
carbonate, diethyl carbonate, dipropyl carbonate (isomers), dibutyl carbonate<br>
(isomers), dipentyl carbonate (isomers), dihexyl carbonate (isomers), diheptyl<br>
carbonate (isomers) and dioctyl carbonate (isomers). Among these, a dialkyl<br>
carbonate in which the number of carbon atoms constituting the alkyl groups is<br>
a number selected from an integer of 4 to 6 is used particularly preferably.<br>
Amine compounds represented by the following formula (22) are<br>
preferably used for the amine compounds:<br><br>
(wherein R7 represents a group selected from the group consisting of an<br>
aliphatic group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms and an aromatic group having 6 to<br>
20 carbon atoms, the group containing an atom selected from a carbon atom<br>
and an oxygen atom, and having a valence of n, and<br><br>
n represents an integer of 1 to 10).<br>
In formula (22) above, a polyamine compound is used in which n is<br>
preferably 1 to 3 and more preferably n is 2.<br>
Examples of such polyamine compounds include aliphatic diamines such<br>
as hexamethylene diamine, 4,4'-methylenebis(cyclohexylamine) (isomers),<br>
cydohexane diamine (isomers), 3-aminomethyl-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexyl<br>
amine (isomers) or the like; and aromatic diamines such as phenylene diamine<br>
(isomers), toluene diamine (isomers), 4,4'-methylene dianiline (isomers) or the<br>
like. Among these, aliphatic diamines such as hexamethylene diamine,<br>
4,4'-methylenebis(cyclohexylamine) (isomers), cydohexane diamine (isomers),<br>
3-aminomethyl-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexyl amine (isomers) or the like are used<br>
preferably, while hexamethylene diamine, 4,4'-methylenebis(cyclohexylamine)<br>
and 3-aminomethyl-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexyl amine are used more preferably.<br>
Reaction conditions vary according to the reacted compounds, and<br>
although the dialkyl carbonate is preferably in excess based on the amino<br>
groups of the amine compound to accelerate the reaction rate and complete<br>
the reaction quickly at a stoichiometric ratio of the dialkyl carbonate to amino<br>
groups of the amine compound within a range of from 2 to 1000 times, the<br>
range is preferably from 2 to 100 times and more preferably from 2.5 to 30<br>
times in consideration of the size of the reaction vessel. The reaction<br>
temperature is generally within the range of from normal temperature (20°C) to<br>
300°C, and although higher temperatures are preferable in order to accelerate<br>
the reaction rate, since undesirable reactions may conversely occur at high<br>
temperatures, the reaction temperature is preferably within the range of from<br>
50 to 150°C. A known cooling apparatus or heating apparatus may be<br><br>
installed in the reaction vessel to maintain a constant reaction temperature. In<br>
addition, although varying according to the types of compounds used and<br>
reaction temperature, the reaction pressure may be decreased pressure,<br>
normal pressure or increased pressure, and the reaction is generally carried<br>
out at a pressure within the range of from 20 to 1 x 106 Pa. There are no<br>
particular limitations on the reaction time (residence time in the case of a<br>
continuous method), and is generally from 0.001 to 50 hours, preferably from<br>
0.01 to 10 hours and more preferably from 0.1 to 5 hours. In addition, the<br>
reaction can also be completed by confirming that a desired amount of alkyl<br>
carbamate has been formed by, for example, liquid chromatography after<br>
sampling the reaction liquid. In the present embodiment, a catalyst can be<br>
used as necessary, and examples of catalysts that can be used include organic<br>
metal compounds and inorganic metal compounds of tin, lead, copper or<br>
titanium, and basic catalysts such as alkylates of alkaline metals or alkaline<br>
earth metals in the form of methylates, ethylates and butyrates (isomers) of<br>
lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, or barium. Although the use of a<br>
reaction solvent is not necessarily required in the present embodiment, a<br>
suitable inert solvent is preferably used as a reaction solvent for the purpose of<br>
facilitating the reaction procedure, examples of which include alkanes such as<br>
hexane (isomers), heptane (isomers), octane (isomers), nonane (isomers),<br>
decane (isomers) or the like; aromatic hydrocarbons and alkyl-substituted<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene (isomers), ethyl<br>
benzene, diisopropyl benzene (isomers), dibutyl benzene (isomers),<br>
naphthalene or the like; aromatic compounds substituted with a halogen or<br>
nitro group such as chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene (isomers), bromobenzene.<br><br>
dibromobenzene (isomers), chloronaphthalene, bromonaphthalene,<br>
nitrobenzene, nitronaphthalene or the like; polycyclic hydrocarbon compounds<br>
such as diphenyl, substituted diphenyl, diphenyl methane, terphenyl,<br>
anthracene, dibenzyl toluene or the like; aliphatic hydrocarbons such as<br>
cyclohexane, cyclopentane, cyclooctane, ethylcyclohexane or the like; ketones<br>
such as methyl ethyl ketone, acetophenone or the like; esters such as dibutyl<br>
phthalate, dihexyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate, benzylbutyl phthalate or the like;<br>
ethers and thioethers such as diphenyl ether, diphenyl sulfide or the like; and<br>
sulfoxides such as dimethylsulfoxide, diphenylsulfoxide or the like. These<br>
solvents can be used alone or two or more types can be used as a mixture.<br>
In addition, the dialkyl carbonate used in excess based on amino groups of the<br>
amine compound is also preferably used as a solvent in the reaction.<br>
A known tank reactor, column reactor or distillation column can be used<br>
for the reaction vessel, and although known materials may be used for the<br>
reaction vessel and lines provided they do not have a detrimental effect on the<br>
starting substances or reactants, SUS304, SUS316 or SUS316L and the like<br>
can be used preferably since they are inexpensive.<br><transesterification reaction><br>
In the isocyanate production process of the present embodiment,<br>
carbamic acid esters and aromatic hydroxy compounds are first reacted to<br>
obtain aryl carbamates having a group derived from the aromatic hydroxy<br>
compounds. This reaction involves an exchange between an aliphatic alkoxy<br>
group or aralkyloxy group constituting the ester group of the carbamic acid<br>
ester and an aryloxy group derived from the aromatic hydroxy compounds<br><br>
resulting in the formation of the corresponding aryl carbamate and a hydroxy<br>
compound derived from the carbamic acid ester (and is referred to as a<br>
transesterification reaction in the present description).<br>
Although varying according to the reacted compounds, the reaction<br>
conditions of this transesterification reaction are such that the aromatic<br>
hydroxy compound is used within the range of from 2 to 1000 times the ester<br>
group of the carbamic acid ester when expressed as the stoichiometric ratio.<br>
As a result of conducting extensive studies, the inventors of the present<br>
invention surprisingly found that by using the aromatic hydroxy compounds<br>
having a substituent at at least one ortho position with respect to the hydroxyl<br>
group in this transesterification reaction as described above, side reactions as<br>
previously-described attributable to the carbamic acid ester and / or product in<br>
the form of the aryl carbamate can be inhibited in the transesterification<br>
reaction. In the transesterification reaction, although the aromatic hydroxy<br>
compound is preferably used in excess based on the ester group of the<br>
carbamic acid ester in order to inhibit side reactions attributable to the<br>
carbamic acid ester and / or product in the form of the aryl carbamate as well<br>
as allow the reaction to be completed quickly, the aromatic hydroxy compound<br>
is preferably used within the range of from 2 to 100 times and preferably within<br>
the range of from 5 to 50 times in consideration of the size of the reaction<br>
vessel. The reaction temperature is generally within the range of from 100 to<br>
300°C, and although high temperatures are preferable in order to increase the<br>
reaction rate, since there conversely may be greater susceptibility to the<br>
occurrence of side reactions at high temperatures, the reaction temperature is<br>
preferably within the range of from 150 to 250°C. A known cooling apparatus<br><br>
or heating apparatus may be installed in the reaction vessel to maintain a<br>
constant reaction temperature. In addition, although varying according to the<br>
types of compounds used and reaction temperature, the reaction pressure may<br>
be decreased pressure, normal pressure or increased pressure, and the<br>
reaction is generally carried out at a pressure within the range of from 20 to 1 x<br>
106 Pa. There are no particular limitations on the reaction time (residence<br>
time in the case of a continuous method) and is generally from 0.001 to 100<br>
hours, preferably from 0.01 to 50 hours and more preferably from 0.1 to 30<br>
hours. In addition, the reaction can also be completed by confirming that a<br>
desired amount of aryl carbamate has been formed by, for example, liquid<br>
chromatography after sampling the reaction liquid. In the present<br>
embodiment, the catalyst is used at from 0.01 to 30% by weight and preferably<br>
at from 0.5 to 20% by weight based on the weight of the carbamic acid ester.<br>
For example, organic metal catalysts such as dibutyl tin dilaurate, ferrous<br>
octoate or stannous octoate, or amines such as 1,4-diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane,<br>
triethylenediamine or triethylamine are suitable for use, while organic metal<br>
catalysts such as dibutyl tin dilaurate, ferrous octoate or stannous octoate are<br>
particularly preferable. These compounds may be used alone or two or more<br>
types may be used as a mixture. Although the use of a reaction solvent is not<br>
necessarily required in the present embodiment, a suitable inert solvent is<br>
preferably used as a reaction solvent for the purpose of facilitating the reaction<br>
procedure, examples of which include alkanes such as hexane (isomers),<br>
heptane (isomers), octane (isomers), nonane (isomers), decane (isomers)or<br>
the like; aromatic hydrocarbons and alkyl-substituted aromatic hydrocarbons<br>
such as benzene, toluene, xylene (isomers), ethylbenzene, diisopropyl-<br><br>
benzene (isomers), dibutylbenzene (isomers), naphthalene or the like;<br>
aromatic compounds substituted with a halogen or nitro group such as<br>
chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene (isomers), bromobenzene, dibromobenzene<br>
(isomers), chloronaphthalene,	bromonaphthalene, nitrobenzene,<br>
nitronaphthalene or the like; polycyclic hydrocarbon compounds such as<br>
diphenyl, substituted diphenyl, diphenyl methane, terphenyl, anthracene,<br>
dibenzyltoluene (isomers) or the like; aliphatic hydrocarbons such as<br>
cyclohexane, cyclopentane, cyclooctane, ethylcydohexane or the like; ketones<br>
such as methyl ethyl ketone, acetophenone or the like; esters such as dibutyl<br>
phthalate, dihexyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate, benzylbutyl phthalate or the like;<br>
ethers and thioethers such as diphenyl ether, diphenyl sulfide or the like; and<br>
sulfoxides such as dimethylsulfoxide, diphenylsulfoxide or the like; and,<br>
silicone oil. These solvents can be used alone or two or more types can be<br>
used as a mixture.<br>
As has been described above, although the transesterification reaction in<br>
the present embodiment involves the exchange between the aliphatic alkoxy<br>
group constituting the ester group of the carbamic acid ester and the aryloxy<br>
group derived from the aromatic hydroxy compound resulting in the formation<br>
of the corresponding aryl carbamates and the alcohols, the transesterification<br>
reaction is an equilibrium reaction. Thus, in order to efficiently produce the<br>
aryl carbamates by this transesterification reaction, it is preferable to remove<br>
the products from the reaction system. Since the compounds having the<br>
lowest standard boiling point in the reaction system are the alcohols formed by<br>
the transesterification reaction, the alcohols are preferably removed from the<br>
reaction system by a method such as distillative separation.<br><br>
In addition, the transesterification reaction is preferably carried out with a<br>
continuous method to allow the transesterification reaction to proceed<br>
efficiently. Namely, a method is preferably used in which the carbamic acid<br>
esters and the aromatic hydroxy compounds are supplied continuously to the<br>
reaction vessel to carry out the transesterification reaction, the alcohols formed<br>
are removed from the reaction vessel in the form of the gaseous components,<br>
and reaction liquids containing the formed aryl carbamates and the aromatic<br>
hydroxy compounds are continuously removed from the bottom of the reaction<br>
vessel. In the case of carrying out the transesterification reaction according to<br>
this method, in addition to promoting the transesterification reaction, there is<br>
also the surprisingly effect of being able to improve the final yield of<br>
isocyanates by inhibiting side reactions as previously described.<br>
Although known materials may be used for the reaction vessel and lines<br>
used to carry out the transesterification reaction provided they do not have a<br>
detrimental effect on the starting substances or reactants, SUS304, SUS316 or<br>
SUS316L and the like can be used preferably since they are inexpensive.<br>
There are no particular limitations on the type of reaction vessel, and a known<br>
tank reactor or column reactor can be used. A reaction vessel is preferably<br>
used that is provided with lines for extracting a low boiling point reaction<br>
mixture containing alcohol formed in the transesterification reaction from the<br>
reaction vessel in the form of the gaseous components, and for removing<br>
mixed liquids containing the produced aryl carbamates and aromatic hydroxy<br>
compounds from the lower portion of the reaction vessel in the form of a liquid.<br>
Various known methods are used for such a reaction vessel, examples of<br>
which include types using reaction vessels containing a stirring tank, a<br><br>
multistage stirring tank, a distillation column, a multistage distillation column, a<br>
multitubular reactor, a continuous multistage distillation column, a packed<br>
column, a thin film evaporator, a reactor provided with a support inside, a<br>
forced circulation reactor, a falling film evaporator, a falling drop evaporator, a<br>
trickle flow reactor, a bubble column, and types using combinations thereof.<br>
Methods using the thin film evaporator or columnar reactor are preferable from<br>
the viewpoint of efficiently shifting the equilibrium to the products side, while a<br>
structure having a large gas-liquid contact area is preferable for being able to<br>
rapidly transfer the alcohol formed to the gaseous phase.<br>
The multistage distillation column refers to a distillation column having<br>
multiple stages in which the number of theoretical plates of distillation is 2 or<br>
more, and any multistage distillation column may be used provided it allows<br>
continuous distillation. Any multistage distillation column can be used for the<br>
multistage distillation column provided it is ordinarily used as a multistage<br>
distillation column, examples of which include tray column types using a<br>
bubble tray, a porous plate tray, a valve tray, a counter-current tray or the like,<br>
and packed column types packed with various types of packing materials such<br>
as a raschig ring, a lessing ring, a pole ring, a Berl saddle, an Interlock saddle,<br>
a Dixon packing, a McMahon packing, Helipack, a Sulzer packing, Mellapak or<br>
the like. Any packed column can be used provided the column is packed with<br>
known packing materials as described above. Moreover, a combination<br>
tray-packed column type is also used preferably that combines a tray portion<br>
with the portion packed with the packing materials. The reaction vessel is<br>
preferably provided with a line for supplying a mixture containing the carbamic<br>
acid esters and the aromatic hydroxy compounds, a line for removing the<br><br>
gaseous phase components containing alcohols formed by the<br>
transestehfication reaction, and a line for extracting mixed liquids containing<br>
the carbamic acid esters and aromatic hydroxy compounds, and the line for<br>
removing the gaseous phase components containing the alcohols is preferably<br>
at a location that allows the gaseous phase components in the reaction vessel<br>
to be removed, and the line for extracting the mixed liquids containing the aryl<br>
carbamates and the aromatic hydroxy compounds is particularly preferably<br>
located there below.<br>
A line for supplying inert gas and / or liquid inert solvent from the lower<br>
portion of the reaction vessel may be separately attached, and in the case the<br>
mixed liquids containing the formed aryl carbamates and the aromatic hydroxy<br>
compounds contain unreacted carbamic acid esters, a line may be attached for<br>
recirculating all or a portion of the mixed liquids to the reaction vessel. Note<br>
that in the case of using the above-mentioned inert solvent, the inert solvent<br>
may be in the form of a gas and / or a liquid.<br>
The gaseous components containing alcohols extracted from the reaction<br>
vessel may be purified using a known method such as a distillation column,<br>
and the azeotropic and / or accompanying aromatic hydroxy compound and<br>
the like may be recycled. Equipment for warming, cooling or heating may be<br>
added to each line in consideration of clogging and the like.<br><aryl carbamates><br>

The aryl carbamates produced in the transesterification reaction may be<br>
subjected to the subsequent thermal decomposition reaction while still as a<br>
mixed liquid containing aryl carbamates and aromatic hydroxy compounds<br>
which are removed from the reactor, or the aryl carbamates may be subjected<br>
to the thermal decomposition reaction after purifying from the mixed liquid. A<br>
known method can be used to purify the aryl carbamate from the reaction<br><br>
liquid, examples of which include removal of the aromatic hydroxy compounds<br>
by distillation, washing with solvents and purification of the aryl carbamates by<br>
crystallization.<br>
Since the aryl carbamates of the present embodiment are carbamic acid<br>
esters composed of aromatic hydroxy compounds and isocyanates, the<br>
thermal decomposition temperature is low as is generally known. In addition,<br>
the aryl carbamates of the present embodiment are surprisingly extremely<br>
resistant to the occurrence of side reactions (such as a reaction resulting in the<br>
formation of a urea bond as previously described) at high temperatures (such<br>
as 180°C) at which thermal decomposition is carried out. Although the<br>
mechanism by which side reactions are inhibited is unclear, as was previously<br>
described, it is presumed that a substituent at the ortho position relative to the<br>
hydroxyl group sterically protects a urethane bond, thereby hindering the<br>
reaction between a different carbamic acid ester and the urethane bond.<br>
Moreover, although the aromatic hydroxy compounds formed by the<br>
thermal decomposition reaction of the aryl carbamates of the present<br>
embodiment are aromatic hydroxy compounds having a substituent at the<br>
ortho position relative to a hydroxyl group, since the reaction rate between the<br>
aromatic hydroxy compounds and isocyanates are surprisingly late, namely the<br>
reverse reaction rate in the thermal decomposition reaction is slow, when<br>
carrying out the thermal decomposition reaction on the aryl carbamates, there<br>
is the advantage of being able to easily separate the aromatic hydroxy<br>
compounds and the isocyanates.<br><thermal decomposition reaction of aryl carbamates><br><br>
The following provides an explanation of the aryl carbamate<br>
decomposition reaction of the present embodiment.<br>
The decomposition reaction of the present embodiment is a thermal<br>
decomposition reaction by which corresponding isocyanates and aromatic<br>
hydroxy compounds are formed from the aryl carbamates.<br>
The reaction temperature is generally within the range of from 100 to<br>
300°C, and although a high temperature is preferable for increasing the<br>
reaction rate, since side reactions as described above may be conversely<br>
caused by the aryl carbamates and / or the reaction products in the form of the<br>
isocyanates, the reaction temperature is preferably within the range of from<br>
150 to 250°C. A known cooling apparatus or heating apparatus may be<br>
installed in the reaction vessel to maintain a constant reaction temperature. In<br>
addition, although varying according to the types of compounds used and<br>
reaction temperature, the reaction pressure may be decreased pressure,<br>
normal pressure or increased pressure, and the reaction is normally carried out<br>
at a pressure within the range of from 20 to 1 x 106 Pa. There are no<br>
particular limitations on the reaction time (residence time in the case of a<br>
continuous method) and is generally from 0.001 to 100 hours, preferably from<br>
0.01 to 50 hours and more preferably from 0.1 to 30 hours. A catalyst can be<br>
used in the present embodiment, and the catalyst is used at from 0.01 to 30%<br>
by weight and preferably at from 0.5 to 20% by weight based on the weight of<br>
the aryl carbamates. For example, organic metal catalysts such as dibutyl tin<br>
dilaurate, ferrous octoate, stannous octoate or the like, or amines such as<br>
1,4-diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane, triethylenediamine, triethylamine or the like are<br>
suitable for use as catalysts, while organic metal catalysts such as dibutyl tin<br><br>
dilaurate, ferrous octoate, stannous octoate or the like are particularly<br>
preferable. These compounds may be used alone or two or more types may<br>
be used as a mixture. In the case of using the catalysts in the<br>
above-mentioned transesterification reaction, the catalysts contained in the<br>
mixed liquid following the transesterification reaction may be used as a catalyst<br>
in the thermal decomposition reaction or catalysts may be freshly added to the<br>
aryl carbamates when the thermal decomposition reaction is carried out.<br>
Although the use of a reaction solvent is not necessarily required in the present<br>
embodiment, a suitable inert solvent can be used as a reaction solvent for the<br>
purpose of facilitating the reaction procedure, examples of which include<br>
alkanes such as hexane (isomers), heptane (isomers), octane (isomers),<br>
nonane (isomers), decane (isomers) or the like; aromatic hydrocarbons and<br>
alkyl-substituted aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene<br>
(isomers), ethyl benzene, diisopropyl benzene (isomers), dibutyl benzene<br>
(isomers), naphthalene or the like; aromatic compounds substituted with a<br>
halogen or nitro group such as chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene (isomers),<br>
bromobenzene,	dibromobenzene	(isomers),	chloronaphthalene,<br>
bromonaphthalene, nitrobenzene, nitronaphthalene or the like; polycyclic<br>
hydrocarbon compounds such as diphenyl, substituted diphenyl, diphenyl<br>
methane, terphenyl, anthracene, dibenzyl toluene (isomers) or the like;<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cydohexane, cyclopentane, cyclooctane,<br>
ethylcyclohexane or the like; ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone,<br>
acetophenone or the like; esters such as dibutyl phthalate, dihexyl phthalate,<br>
dioctyl phthalate, benzylbutyl phthalate or the like; ethers and thioethers such<br>
as diphenyl ether, diphenyl sulfide or the like; and sulfoxides such as<br><br>
dimethylsulfoxide, diphenylsulfoxide or the like; and, silicone oil. These<br>
solvents can be used alone or two or more types can be used as a mixture.<br>
As was previously described, although the thermal decomposition<br>
reaction of the present embodiment is a reaction by which the corresponding<br>
isocyanates and the aromatic hydroxy compounds are formed from the aryl<br>
carbamates, the thermal decomposition reaction is an equilibrium reaction.<br>
Thus, in order to efficiently obtain isocyanates in this thermal decomposition<br>
reaction, it is preferable to remove at least one of the products of this thermal<br>
decomposition reaction in the form of the isocyanates and the aromatic<br>
hydroxy compounds from the thermal decomposition reaction system in the<br>
form of a gaseous component by a method such as distillation. Whether the<br>
isocyanates or aromatic hydroxy compounds are removed as the gaseous<br>
components can be arbitrarily determined according to the compounds used,<br>
and for example, the respective standard boiling points of the isocyanates and<br>
the aromatic hydroxy compounds are compared followed by removing the<br>
compounds having the lower standard boiling point in the form of the gaseous<br>
components.<br>
The aryl carbamates are also susceptible to the occurrence of side<br>
reactions as described above in the case of being held at a high temperature<br>
for a long period of time, although to a much lower degree than carbamic acid<br>
esters. In addition, the above-mentioned side reactions may also be induced<br>
by the isocyanates formed by the thermal decomposition reaction. Thus, the<br>
time during which the aryl carbamates and the isocyanates are held at a high<br>
temperature is preferably as short as possible, and the thermal decomposition<br>
reaction is preferably carried out by the continuous method. The continuous<br><br>
method refers to a method in which the aryl carbamates are continuously<br>
supplied to a reaction vessel where it is subjected to a thermal decomposition<br>
reaction, and at least either the formed isocyanates or aromatic hydroxy<br>
compounds are removed from the reaction vessel in the form of a gaseous<br>
component.<br>
Although known materials may be used for the reaction vessel and lines<br>
used to carry out the thermal decomposition reaction provided they do not<br>
have a detrimental effect on the aryl carbamate or the products in the form of<br>
the aromatic hydroxy compounds and isocyanates, SUS304, SUS316 or<br>
SUS316L and the like can be used preferably since they are inexpensive.<br>
There are no particular limitations on the type of reaction vessel, and a known<br>
tank reactor or column reactor can be used. A reaction vessel is preferably<br>
used that is provided with lines for extracting a low boiling point mixture<br>
containing at least either the isocyanates or aromatic hydroxy compounds<br>
formed in the thermal decomposition reaction from the reaction vessel in the<br>
form of the gaseous components, and for removing mixed liquids containing<br>
unreacted aryl carbamates and the compounds not extracted in the form of the<br>
gaseous components from the lower portion of the reaction vessel. Various<br>
known methods are used for such reaction vessels, examples of which include<br>
types using reaction vessels containing a stirring tank, a multistage stirring tank,<br>
a distillation column, a multistage distillation column, a multitubular reactor, a<br>
continuous multistage distillation column, a packed column, a thin film<br>
evaporator, a reactor provided with a support inside, a forced circulation<br>
reactor, a falling film evaporator, a falling drop evaporator, a trickle flow reactor<br>
or a bubble column, and types using combinations thereof. Methods using<br><br>
the thin film evaporator or columnar reactor are preferable from the viewpoint<br>
of rapidly removing low boiling point components from the reaction system,<br>
while a structure having a large gas-liquid contact area is preferable for rapidly<br>
transferring the low boiling point components formed to the gaseous phase.<br>
The reaction vessel is preferably provided with a line for supplying the<br>
aryl carbamates, a line for removing a gaseous component containing at least<br>
either the isocyanates or aromatic hydroxy compounds formed by the thermal<br>
decomposition reaction, and a line for removing a mixed liquid containing the<br>
compounds not removed as a gaseous component and unreacted aryl<br>
carbamates, the line for removing the gaseous components containing at least<br>
either the isocyanates or aromatic hydroxy compounds is preferably located at<br>
a location that allows the gaseous components in the reaction vessel to be<br>
removed, and the line for extracting the mixed liquids containing the<br>
compounds not removed as the gaseous components and the unreacted aryl<br>
carbamates is particularly preferably located there below.<br>
In addition, a line for supplying inert gas and / or liquid inert solvent from<br>
the lower portion of the reaction vessel may be separately attached, and a line<br>
may also be attached for recirculating all or a portion of the mixed liquid<br>
containing the unreacted aryl carbamates and the compounds not removed as<br>
the gaseous components to the reaction vessel. Equipment for warming,<br>
cooling or heating may be added to each line in consideration of clogging and<br>
the like. Furthermore, in the case of using the above-mentioned inert solvent,<br>
the inert solvent may be in the form of a gas and / or a liquid.<br>
The isocyanate obtained by the above-mentioned production process can<br>
be preferably used as a production raw material of polyurethane foam, paints,<br><br>
adhesives and the like. Since this process enables isocyanates to be<br>
efficiently produced without using extremely toxic phosgene, the present<br>
invention is industrially extremely significant.<br>

[Reference Example 1] Production of Bis(3-methylbutyl) Carbonate<br>
Step (1-1): Production of Dialkyl Tin Catalyst<br>
625 g (2.7 mol) of di-n-butyl tin oxide (Sankyo Organic Chemicals Co.,<br>
Ltd., Japan) and 2020 g (22.7 mol) of 3-methyl-1-butanol (Kuraray Co., Ltd.,<br>
Japan) were placed in a 5000 mL volumetric pear-shaped flask. The flask<br>
was connected to an evaporator (R-144, Shibata Co., Ltd., Japan) to which<br>
was connected an oil bath (OBH-24, Masuda Corp., Japan) equipped with a<br>
temperature controller, a vacuum pump (G-50A, Ulvac Inc., Japan) and a<br>
vacuum controller (VC-10S, Okano Seisakusho Co., Ltd., Japan). The purge<br>
valve outlet of this evaporator was connected to a line containing nitrogen gas<br>
flowing at a normal pressure. After closing the purge valve of the evaporator<br>
to reduce pressure inside the system, the purge valve was opened gradually to<br>
allow nitrogen to flow into the system and return to normal pressure. The oil<br>
bath temperature was set to about 145°C, the flask was immersed in the oil<br>
bath and rotation of the evaporator was started. After heating for about 40<br>
minutes in the presence of atmospheric pressure nitrogen with the purge valve<br>
of the evaporator left open, distillation of 3-methyl-1-butanol containing water<br>
began. After maintaining in this state for 7 hours, the purge valve was closed,<br><br>
pressure inside the system was gradually reduced, and excess<br>
3-methyl-1-butanol was distilled with the pressure inside the system at 74 to 35<br>
kPa. After the fraction no longer appeared, the flask was taken out of the oil<br>
bath. After allowing the flask to cool to the vicinity of room temperature<br>
(25°C), the flask was taken out of the oil bath, the purge valve was opened<br>
gradually and the pressure inside the system was returned to atmospheric<br>
pressure. 1173 g of reaction liquid were obtained in the flask. Based on the<br>
results of 119Sn-, 1H- and 13C-NMR analyses, 1,1,3,3-tetra-n-butyl-<br>
1,3-bis(3-methylbutyloxy) distannoxane was confirmed to have been obtained<br>
at a yield of 99% based on di-n-butyl tin oxide. The same procedure was then<br>
repeated 12 times to obtain a total of 10335 g of<br>
1,1,3,3-tetra-n-butyl-1,3-bis(3-methylbutyloxy) distannoxane.<br>
Step (1-2): Production of Bis(3-methylbutyl) Carbonate<br>
Bis(3-methylbutyl) carbonate was produced in a continuous production<br>
apparatus	like	that	shown	in	FIG.	1.<br>
1,1,3,3-tetrabutyl-1,3-bis(3-methylbutyloxy) distannoxane produced in the<br>
manner described above was supplied at the rate of 4388 g / hr from a transfer<br>
line 4 into a column-type reaction vessel 102 packed with Metal Gauze CY<br>
Packing (Sulzer Chemtech Ltd., Switzerland) and having an inner diameter of<br>
151 mm and effective length of 5040 mm, and 3-methyl-1-butanol purified with<br>
a distillation column 101 was supplied at the rate of 14953 g / hr from a<br>
transfer line 2. The liquid temperature inside reaction vessel 102 was<br>
controlled to 160°C by a heater and a reboiler 112, and the pressure was<br>
adjusted to about 120 kPa-G with a pressure control valve. The residence<br>
time in the reaction vessel was about 17 minutes. 3-Methyl-1-butanol<br><br>
containing water at the rate of 15037 g / hr from tine top of tine reaction vessel<br>
via a transfer line 6, and 3-methyl-1-butanol at the rate of 825 g / hr via feed<br>
line 1, were pumped to distillation column 101 packed with Metal Gauze CY<br>
Packing and provided with a reboiler 111 and a condenser 121 to carry out<br>
distillative purification. In the top of distillation column 101, a fraction<br>
containing a high concentration of water was condensed by condenser 121<br>
and recovered from a recovery line 3. Purified 3-methyl-1-butanol was<br>
pumped to column-type reaction vessel 102 via transfer line 2 located in the<br>
bottom of distillation column 101. An alkyl tin alkoxide catalyst composition<br>
containing	di-n-butyl-bis(3-methylbutyloxy)	tin	and<br>
1,1,3,3-tetra-n-butyl-1,3-bis(3-methylbutyloxy) distannoxane was obtained from<br>
the bottom of column-type reaction vessel 102, and supplied to a thin film<br>
evaporator 103 (Kobeico Eco-Solutions Co., Ltd., Japan) via a transfer line 5.<br>
The 3-methyl-1-butanol was distilled off in thin film evaporator 103 and<br>
returned to column-type reaction vessel 102 via a condenser 123, a transfer<br>
line 8 and transfer line 4. The alkyl tin alkoxide catalyst composition was<br>
pumped from the bottom of thin film evaporator 103 via a transfer line 7 and<br>
supplied to an autoclave 104 while adjusting the flow rate of<br>
di-n-butyl-bis(3-methylbutyloxy)	tin	and	1,1,3,3-tetra-n-<br>
butyl-1,3-bis(3-methylbutyloxy) distannoxane to about 5130 g / hr. Carbon<br>
dioxide was supplied to the autoclave by a transfer line 9 at the rate of 973 g /<br>
hr, and the pressure inside the autoclave was maintained at 4 MPa-G. The<br>
temperature inside the autoclave was set to 120°C, the residence time was<br>
adjusted to about 4 hours, and a reaction between the carbon dioxide and the<br>
alkyl tin alkoxide catalyst composition was carried out to obtain a reaction liquid<br><br>
containing bis(3-methylbutyl) carbonate. This reaction liquid was transferred<br>
to a decarbonization tank 105 via a transfer line 10 and a control valve to<br>
remove residual carbon dioxide, and the carbon dioxide was recovered from a<br>
transfer line 11. Subsequently, the reaction liquid was transferred to a thin<br>
film evaporator (Kobelco Eco-Solutions Co., Ltd., Japan) 106 set to about<br>
142°C and about 0.5 kPa via a transfer line 12 and supplied while adjusting the<br>
flow rate of 1,1,3,3-tetra-n-butyl-1,3-bis(3-methylbutyloxy) distannoxane to<br>
about 4388 g / hr to obtain a fraction containing bis(3-methylbutyl) carbonate.<br>
On the other hand, the evaporation residue was circulated to column-type<br>
reaction vessel 102 via transfer line 13 and transfer line 4 while adjusting the<br>
flow rate of 1,1,3,3-tetra-n-butyl-1,3-bis(3-methylbutyloxy) distannoxane to<br>
about 4388 g / hr. The fraction containing bis(3-methylbutyl) carbonate was<br>
supplied to a distillation column 107 packed with Metal Gauze CY packing and<br>
equipped with a reboiler 117 and a condenser 127 via a condenser 126 and a<br>
transfer line 14 at the rate of 959 g / hr followed by distillative purification to<br>
obtain 99 wt% bis(3-methylbutyl) carbonate from a recovery line 16 at the rate<br>
of 944 g / hr When the alkyl tin alkoxide catalyst composition of a transfer<br>
line 13 was analyzed by 119Sn-, 1H- and 13C-NMR analysis, it was found to<br>
contain 1,1,3,3-tetra-n-butyl-1,3-bis(3-methylbutyloxy) distannoxane but not<br>
contain di-n-butyl-bis(3-methylbutyloxy) tin. After carrying out the<br>
above-mentioned continuous operation for about 240 hours, alkyl tin alkoxide<br>
catalyst composition was extracted from an extraction line 16 at the rate of 18<br>
g / hr, while 1,1,3,3-tetra-n-butyl-1,3-bis(3-methylbutyloxy) distannoxane<br>
produced according to the above process was supplied from a feed line 17 at<br>
the rate of 18 g / hr.<br><br>
[Reference Example 2] Production of Dibutyl Carbonate<br>
Step (11-1): Production of Dialkyl Tin Catalyst<br>
692 g (2.78 mol) of di-n-butyl tin oxide and 2000 g (27 mol) of 1-butanol<br>
(Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Japan) were placed in a 3000 mL<br>
volumetric pear-shaped flask. The flask containing the white, slurry-like<br>
mixture was attached to an evaporator to which was connected an oil bath<br>
equipped with a temperature controller, a vacuum pump and a vacuum<br>
controller. The purge valve outlet of this evaporator was connected to a line<br>
containing nitrogen gas flowing at normal pressure. After closing the purge<br>
valve of the evaporator to reduce pressure inside the system, the purge valve<br>
was opened gradually to allow nitrogen to flow into the system and return to<br>
normal pressure. The oil bath temperature was set to about 126°C, the flask<br>
was immersed in the oil bath and rotation of the evaporator was started. After<br>
rotating and heating for about 30 minutes at normal pressure with the purge<br>
valve of the evaporator left open, the mixture boiled and distillation of the low<br>
boiling point component began. After maintaining in this state for 8 hours, the<br>
purge valve was closed, pressure inside the system was gradually reduced,<br>
and residual low boiling point component was distilled off with the pressure<br>
inside the system at 76 to 54 kPa. After the low boiling point component no<br>
longer appeared, the flask was taken out of the oil bath. The reaction liquid<br>
was in the form of a clear liquid. The flask was subsequently taken out of the<br>
oil bath, the purge valve was opened gradually and the pressure inside the<br>
system was returned to normal pressure. 952 g of reaction liquid were<br>
obtained in the flask. Based on the results of 119Sn-, 1H- and 13C-NMR<br>
analyses, a product in the form of 1,1,3,3-tetra-n-butyl-1,3-di(n-butyloxy)<br><br>
distannoxane was obtained at a yield of 99% based on di-n-butyl tin oxide.<br>
The same procedure was then repeated 12 times to obtain a total of 11480 g of<br>
1,1,3,3-tetra-n-butyl-1,3-di(butyloxy) distannoxane.<br>
Step (11-2): Production of Dibutyl Carbonate<br>
Carbonic acid ester was produced in a continuous production apparatus<br>
like that shown in FIG. 1. 1,1,3,3-Tetra-n-butyl-1,3-di(n-butyloxy)<br>
distannoxane produced in step (11-1) was supplied at the rate of 4201 g / hr<br>
from transfer line 4 into a column-type reaction vessel packed with Mellapak<br>
750Y packing (Sulzer Chemtech Ltd., Switzerland) and having an inner<br>
diameter of 151 mm and effective length of 5040 mm, and 1-butanol purified<br>
with distillation column 101 was supplied to column-type reaction vessel 102 at<br>
the rate of 24717 g / hr from feed line 2. The liquid temperature inside the<br>
reaction vessel was controlled to 160°C by a heater and reboiler 112, and the<br>
pressure was adjusted to about 250 kPa-G with a pressure control valve. The<br>
residence time in the reaction vessel was about 10 minutes. 1-Butanol<br>
containing water at the rate of 24715 g / hr from the top of the reaction vessel<br>
via transfer line 6, and 1-butanol at the rate of 824 g / hr via feed line 1, were<br>
pumped to distillation column 101 packed with Metal Gauze CY packing<br>
(Sulzer Chemtech Ltd., Switzerland) and provided with reboiler 111 and<br>
condenser 121 to carry out distillative purification. In the top of distillation<br>
column 101, a fraction containing a high concentration of water was condensed<br>
by condenser 121 and recovered from transfer line 3. Purified 1-butanol was<br>
pumped via transfer line 2 located in the bottom of distillation column 101. An<br>
alkyl tin alkoxide catalyst composition containing di-n-butyl tin di-n-butoxide<br>
and 1,1,3,3-tetra-n-butyl-1,3-di(n-butyloxy) distannoxane was obtained from<br><br>
the bottom of column-type reaction vessel 102, and supplied to thin film<br>
evaporator 103 (Kobelco Eco-Solutions Co., Ltd., Japan) via a transfer line 5.<br>
The 1-butanol was distilled off in thin film evaporator 103 and returned to<br>
column-type reaction vessel 102 via condenser 123, transfer line 8 and<br>
transfer line 4. The alkyl tin alkoxide catalyst composition was pumped from<br>
the bottom of thin film evaporator 103 via transfer line 7 and supplied to<br>
autoclave 104 while adjusting the flow rate of the active components in the<br>
form of dibutyl tin dibutoxide and 1,1,3,3-tetra-n-butyl-1,3-di(n-butyloxy)<br>
distannoxane to about 4812 g / hr Carbon dioxide was supplied to the<br>
autoclave by feed line 9 at the rate of 973 g / hr, and the pressure inside the<br>
autoclave was maintained at 4 MPa-G. The temperature inside the autoclave<br>
was set to 120°C, the residence time was adjusted to about 4 hours, and a<br>
reaction between the carbon dioxide and the alkyl tin alkoxide catalyst<br>
composition was carried out to obtain a reaction liquid containing dibutyl<br>
carbonate. This reaction liquid was transferred to decarbonization tank 105<br>
via transfer line 10 and a control valve to remove residual carbon dioxide, and<br>
the carbon dioxide was recovered from transfer line 11. Subsequently, the<br>
reaction liquid was pumped to thin film evaporator 106 (Kobeico Eco-Solutions<br>
Co., Ltd., Japan) set to about 140°C and about 1.4 kPa via transfer line 12 and<br>
supplied while adjusting the flow rate of the<br>
1,1,3,3-tetra-n-butyl-1,3-di(n-butyloxy) distannoxane to about 4201 g / hr to<br>
obtain a fraction containing dibutyl carbonate. On the other hand, the<br>
evaporation residue was circulated to column-type reaction vessel 102 via<br>
transfer line 13 and transfer line 4 while adjusting the flow rate of<br>
1,1,3,3-tetra-n-butyl-1,3-di(n-butyloxy) distannoxane to about 4201 g / hr. The<br><br>
fraction containing dibutyl carbonate was supplied to distillation column 107<br>
packed with Metal Gauze CY packing (Sulzer Chemtech Ltd., Switzerland) and<br>
equipped with reboiler 117 and condenser 127 via condenser 126 and a<br>
transfer line 14 at the rate of 830 g / hr followed by distillative purification to<br>
obtain 99 wt% bis(3-methylbutyl) carbonate from recovery line 16 at the rate of<br>
814 g / hr. When the alkyl tin alkoxide catalyst composition of transfer line 13<br>
was analyzed by 119Sn-, 1H- and 13C-NMR analysis, it was found to contain<br>
1,1,3,3-tetra-n-butyl-1,3-di(n-butyloxy) distannoxane but not contain di-n-butyl<br>
tin di-n-butoxide. After carrying out the above-mentioned continuous<br>
operation for about 600 hours, alkyl tin alkoxide catalyst composition was<br>
extracted from extraction line 16 at the rate of 16 g / hr, while<br>
1,1,3,3-tetra-n-butyl-1,3-di(n-butyloxy) distannoxane produced in step (11-1)<br>
was supplied from feed line 17 at the rate of 16 g / hr.<br>
[Example 1]<br>
Step (1-1): Production of N,N'-hexanediyl-bis-carbamic Acid<br>
Di(3-methylbutyl) Ester<br>
1818 g (9.0 mol) of bis(3-methylbutyl) carbonate and 208.8 g (1.8 mol) of<br>
hexamethylene diamine (Aldrich Corp., USA) were placed in a 5 L volumetric<br>
fourth-mouth flask, a stirrer was placed in the flask, and a Dimroth condenser<br>
and three-way valve were attached to the flask. After replacing the inside of<br>
the system with nitrogen, the four-mouth flask was immersed in an oil bath<br>
(OBH-24, Masuda Corp., Japan) heated to 80°C followed by the addition of 3.5<br>
g of sodium methoxide (28% methanol solution, Wako Pure Chemical<br>
Industries, Ltd., Japan) to start the reaction. Samples of the reaction liquid<br><br>
were suitably collected and subjected to NMR analysis, and the reaction was<br>
terminated at the point hexamethylene diamine was no longer detected. As a<br>
result of analyzing the resulting solution by liquid chromatography, the solution<br>
was found to contain 29.9% by weight of N,N'-hexanediyl-bis-carbamic acid<br>
di(3-methylbutyl) ester.<br>
Step (1-2): Distillation of Low Boiling Point Component<br>
The solution obtained in step (1-1) was placed in a 5 L volumetric flask<br>
equipped with a three-way valve, condenser, distillate collector and<br>
thermometer, and the inside of the flask was replaced with nitrogen in a<br>
vacuum. The flask was immersed in an oil bath heated to about 130°C.<br>
Distillation was carried out while gradually reducing the pressure in the flask to<br>
a final pressure of 0.02 kPa. 1410 g of distillate were obtained. As a result<br>

Decomposition of N,N'-hexanediyl-bis-carbamic Acid Di(3-octyloxy) Ester<br><br>
A thermal decomposition reaction was carried out in a reaction apparatus<br>
like that shown in FIG. 4.<br>
Thin film distillation apparatus 402 (Kobelco Eco-Solutions Co., Ltd.,<br>
Japan) having a heat-conducting surface area of 0.2 m2 was heated to 200°C<br>
and the pressure inside the thin film distillation apparatus was made to be<br>
about 1.3 kPa. The solution obtained in step (D-3) was fed to feed tank 401<br>
and supplied to the thin film distillation apparatus via line 41 at the rate of<br>
about 680 g / hr. A liquid component was extracted from line 43 provided in<br>
the bottom of the thin film distillation apparatus 402, and returned to feed tank<br>
401 via line 44. A gaseous component containing hexamethylene<br>
diisocyanate and 3-octanol was extracted from line 42 provided in the upper<br>
portion of thin film distillation apparatus 402. The gaseous component was<br>
fed to distillation column 403 where the hexamethylene diisocyanate and<br>
3-octanol were separated, the 3-octanol was extracted from line 45 connected<br>
to the top of distillation column 403, hexamethylene diisocyanate was<br>
extracted from line 47 provided in an intermediate stage of distillation column<br>
403, a high boiling point substance was extracted from line 46 provided in the<br>
bottom of distillation column 403, and a portion was returned to feed tank 401<br>
via line 44. When the reaction was carried out for 11 hours, 149 g of a<br>
solution containing 99% by weight of hexamethylene diisocyanate were<br>
recovered from line 47. The yield based on hexamethylene diamine was 45%.<br>
In addition, a black solid was adhered to the sidewalls of the thin film distillation<br>
apparatus 402 following completion of step (D-4).<br>
