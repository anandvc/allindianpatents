CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application is a continuation-in-part of United States Patent Application No.<br>
10/848,437, filed on May 18, 2004, which claims priority from United States Provisional<br>
Application Serial No. 60/556,063 filed on April 28, 2004.<br>
FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY<br>
This invention relates to improvements to earth-boring bits and methods of<br>
producing earth-boring bits. More specifically, the invention relates to earth-boring bit<br>
bodies, roller cones, insert roller cones, cones and teeth for roller cone earth-boring bits<br>
and methods of forming earth-boring bit bodies, roller cones, insert roller cones, cones<br>
and teeth for roller cone earth-boring bits.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE TECHNOLOGY<br>
Earth-boring bits may have fixed or rotatable cutting elements. Earth-boring bits<br>
with fixed cutting elements typically include a bit body machined from steel or<br>
fabricated by infiltrating a bed of hard particles, such as cast carbide (WC + W2C),<br>
tungsten carbide (WC), and/or sintered cemented carbide with a binder such as, for<br>
example, a copper-base alloy. Several cutting inserts are fixed to the bit body in<br>
predetermined positions to optimize cutting. The bit body may be secured to a steel<br>
shank that typically includes a threaded pin connection by which the bit is secured to a<br>
drive shaft of a downhole motor or a drill collar at the distal end of a drill string.<br>
Steel bodied bits are typically machined from round stock to a desired shape,<br>
with topographical and internal features. Hard-facing techniques may be used to apply<br>
wear-resistant materials to the face of the bit body and other critical areas of the surface<br>
of the bit body.<br>
In the conventional method for manufacturing a bit body from hard particles and<br>
a binder, a mold is milled or machined to define the exterior surface features of the bit<br><br>
body. Additional hand milling or clay work may also be required to create or refine<br>
topographical features of the bit body.<br>
Once the mold is complete, a preformed bit blank of steel may be disposed<br>
within the mold cavity to internally reinforce the bit body and provide a pin attachment<br>
matrix upon fabrication. Other sand, graphite, transition or refractory metal based<br>
inserts, such as those defining internal fluid courses, pockets for cutting elements, ridges,<br>
lands, nozzle displacements, junk slots, or other internal or topographical features of the<br>
bit body, may also be inserted into the cavity of the mold. Any inserts used must be<br>
placed at precise locations to ensure proper positioning of cutting elements, nozzles,<br>
junk slots, etc. in the final bit.<br>
The desired hard particles may then be placed within the mold and packed to the<br>
desired density. The hard particles are then infiltrated with a molten binder, which<br>
freezes to form a solid bit body including a discontinuous phase of hard particles within<br>
a continuous phase of binder.<br>
The bit body may then be assembled with other earth-boring bit components.<br>
For example, a threaded shank may be welded or otherwise secured to the bit body, and<br>
cutting elements or inserts (typically cemented tungsten carbide, or diamond or a<br>
synthetic polycrystalline diamond compact ("PDC")) are secured within the cutting<br>
insert pockets, such as by brazing, adhesive bonding, or mechanical affixation.<br>
Alternatively, the cutting inserts may be bonded to the face of the bit body during<br>
furnacing and infiltration if thermally stable PDC's ("TSF') are employed.<br>
Rotatable earth-boring bits for oil and gas exploration conventionally comprise<br>
cemented carbide cutting inserts attached to cones that form part of a roller-cone<br>
assembled bit or comprise milled teeth formed in the cutter by machining. The milled<br>
teeth are typically hardfaced with tungsten carbide in an alloy steel matrix. The bit body<br>
of the roller cone bit is usually made of alloy steel.<br>
Earth-boring bits typically are secured to the terminal end of a drill string, which<br>
is rotated from the surface or by mud motors located just above the bit on the drill string.<br>
Drilling fluid or mud is pumped down the hollow drill string and out nozzles formed in<br>
the bit body. The drilling fluid or mud cools and lubricates the bit as it rotates and also<br>
carries material cut by the bit to the surface.<br><br>
The bit body and other elements of earth-boring bits are subjected to many forms<br>
of wear as they operate in the harsh down hole environment. Among the most common<br>
form of wear is abrasive wear caused by contact with abrasive rock formations. In<br>
addition, the drilling mud, laden with rock cuttings, causes erosive wear on the bit.<br>
The service life of an earth-boring bit is a function not only of the wear<br>
properties of the PDCs or cemented carbide inserts, but also of the wear properties of the<br>
bit body (in the case of fixed cutter bits) or cones (in the case of roller cone bits). One<br>
way to increase earth-boring bit service life is to employ bit bodies or cones made of<br>
materials with improved combinations of strength, toughness, and abrasion/erosion<br>
resistance.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need for improved bit bodies for earth-boring bits having<br>
increased wear resistance, strength and toughness.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a composition for forming a bit body for an<br>
earth-boring bit. The bit body comprises hard particles, wherein the hard particles<br>
comprise at least one of carbides, nitrides, borides, silicides and oxides and solid<br>
solutions thereof and a binder binding together the hard particles. The hard particles<br>
may comprise at least one transition metal carbide selected from carbides of titanium,<br>
chromium, vanadium, zirconium, hafnium, tantalum, molybdenum, niobium, and<br>
tungsten or solid solutions thereof. The hard particles may be present as individual or<br>
mixed carbides and/or as sintered cemented carbides. Embodiments of the binder may<br>
comprise at least one metal selected from cobalt, nickel, iron and alloys thereof. In a<br>
further embodiment, the binder may further comprise at least one melting point reducing<br>
constituent selected from a transition metal carbide up to 60 weight percent, one or more<br>
transition elements up to 50 weight percent, carbon up to 5 weight percent, boron up to<br>
10 weight percent, silicon up to 20 weight percent, chromium up to 20 weight percent,<br>
and manganese up to 25 weight percent, wherein the weight percentages are based on the<br>
total weight of the binder. In one embodiment, the binder comprises 40 to 50 weight<br>
percent of tungsten carbide and 40 to 60 weight percent of at least one or iron, cobalt,<br><br>
and nickel. For the purpose of this invention, transition elements are defined as those<br>
belonging to groups IVB, VB, and VIB of the periodic table.<br>
Another embodiment of the composition for forming a matrix body comprises<br>
hard particles and a binder, wherein the binder has a melting point in the range of<br>
1050oC to 1350°C. The binder may be an alloy comprising at least one of iron, cobalt,<br>
and nickel and may further comprise at least one of a transition metal carbide, a<br>
transition element, carbon, boron, silicon, chromium, manganese, silver, aluminum,<br>
copper, tin, and zinc. More preferably, the binder may be an alloy comprising at least<br>
one of iron, cobalt, and nickel and at least one of a tungsten carbide, tungsten, carbon,<br>
boron, silicon, chromium, and manganese.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention is a composition for forming a matrix<br>
body, the composition comprising hard particles of a transition metal carbide and a<br>
binder comprising at least one of nickel, iron, and cobalt and having a melting point less<br>
than 1350°C. The binder may further comprise at least one of a transition metal carbide,<br>
tungsten carbide, tungsten, carbon, boron, silicon, chromium, manganese, silver,<br>
aluminum, copper, tin, and zinc.<br>
In the manufacture of bit bodies, hard particles and, optionally, inserts may be<br>
placed within a bit body mold. The inserts may be incorporated into the articles of the<br>
present invention by any method. For example, the inserts may be added to the mold<br>
before filling the mold with the powdered metal or hard particles and any inserts present<br>
may be infiltrated with a molten binder, which freezes to form a solid matrix body<br>
including a discontinuous phase of hard particles within a continuous phase of binder.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention also include methods of forming articles, such as,<br>
but not limited to, bit bodies for earth-boring bits, roller cones, and teeth for rolling cone<br>
drill bits. An embodiment of the method of forming an article may comprise infiltrating<br>
a mass of hard particles comprising at least one transition metal carbide with a binder<br>
comprising at least one of nickel, iron, and cobalt and having a melting point less than<br>
1350oC. Another embodiment includes a method comprising infiltrating a mass of hard<br>
particles comprising at least one transition metal carbide with a binder having a melting<br>
point in the range of 1050°C to 1350°C. The binder may comprise at least one of iron,<br>
nickel, and cobalt, wherein the total concentration of iron, nickel, and cobalt is from 40<br>
to 99 weight percent by weight of the binder. The binder may further comprise at least<br><br>
one of a selected transition metal carbide, tungsten carbide, tungsten, carbon, boron,<br>
silicon, chromium, manganese, silver, aluminum, copper, tin, and zinc in a concentration<br>
effective to reduce the melting point of the iron, nickel, and/or cobalt. The binder may<br>
be a eutectic or near eutectic mixture. The lowered melting point of the binder facilitates<br>
proper infiltration of the mass of hard particles.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention is a method of producing an earth-boring<br>
bit, comprising casting the earth-boring bit from a molten mixture of at least one of iron,<br>
nickel, and cobalt and a carbide of a transition metal. The mixture may be a eutectic or<br>
near eutectic mixture. In these embodiments, the earth-boring bit may be cast direcdy<br>
without infiltrating a mass of hard particles.<br>

DESCRIPTION ON THE INVENTION<br>
Embodiments of the present invention relate to a composition for the formation<br>
of bit bodies for earth-boring bits, roller cones, insert roller cones, cones and teeth for<br>
roller cone drill bits and methods of making a bit body for such articles. Additionally,<br>
the method may be used to make other articles. Certain embodiments of a bit body of<br>
the present invention comprise at least one discontinuous hard phase and a continuous<br>
binder phase binding together the hard phase. Embodiments of the compositions and<br>
methods of the present invention provide increased service life for the bit body, roller<br>
cones, insert roller cones, teeth, and cones produced from the composition and method<br>
and thereby improve the service life of the earth-boring bit or other tool. The body<br>
material of the bit body, roller cone, insert roller cone, cone provides the overall<br>
properties to each region of the article.<br>
A typical bit body 10 of a fixed cutter earth-boring bit is shown in Figure 1.<br>
Generally, a bit body 10 comprises attachment means 11 on a shank 12 and blank region<br><br>
12A incorporated in the bit body 10. The shank 12, blank region 12A, and pin may each<br>
independendy be made of an alloy of steels or at least one discontinuous hard phase and<br>
a continuous binder phase, and me attachment means 11, shank 12, and blank region<br>
12A may be attached to the bit body by any method such as, but not limited to, brazed,<br>
threaded connections, pins, keyways, shrink fits, adhesives, diffusion bonding,<br>
interference fits, or any other mechanical or chemical connection. However, in<br>
embodiments of the present invention, the shank 12 including me attachment means may<br>
be made from an alloy steel or the same or different composition of hard particles in a<br>
binder as other portions of the bit body. As such, the bit body 10 may be constructed<br>
having various regions, and each region may comprise a different concentration,<br>
composition, and crystal size of hard particles or binder, for example. This allows<br>
tailoring the properties in specific regions of the article as desired for a particular<br>
application. As such, the article may be designed so the properties or composition of the <br>
regions may change abruptly or more gradually between different regions of the article.<br>
The example bit body 10 of Figure 1 comprises three regions. For example, the top<br>
region 13 may comprise a discontinuous hard phase of tungsten and/or tungsten carbide,<br>
the mid section 14 may comprise a discontinuous hard phase of coarse cast tungsten<br>
carbide (W2C, WC), tungsten carbide, and/or sintered cemented carbide particles, and<br>
the bottom region 15, if present, may comprise a discontinuous hard phase of fine cast<br>
carbide, tungsten carbide, and/or sintered cemented carbide particles. The bit body 10<br>
also includes pockets 16 along the bottom of the bit body 10 and into which cutting<br>
inserts may be disposed. The pockets may be incorporated directiy in the bit body by the <br>
mold, by machining the green or brown billet, as inserts, for example, incorporated<br>
during bit body fabrication, or as inserts attached after the bit body is completed by<br>
brazing or other attachment method, as described above, for example. The bit body 10<br>
may also include internal fluid courses, ridges, lands, nozzles, junk slots, and any other<br>
conventional topographical features of an earth-boring bit body. Optionally, these<br>
topographical features may be defined by preformed inserts, such as inserts 17 that are<br>
located at suitable positions on the bit body mold. Embodiments of the present invention<br>
include bit bodies comprising cemented carbide inserts. In a conventional bit body, the<br>
hard phase particles are bound in a matrix of copper-base alloy, such as, brasses or<br>
bronzes. Embodiments of the bit body of the present invention may comprise or be<br><br>
fabricated with new binders to import improved wear resistance, strength and toughness<br>
to the bit body.<br>
The manufacturing process for hard particles in a binder typically involves<br>
consolidating metallurgical powder (typically a particulate ceramic and binder metal) to<br>
form a green billet. Powder consolidation processes using conventional techniques may<br>
be used, such as mechanical or hydraulic pressing in rigid dies, and wet-bag or dry-bag<br>
isostatic pressing. The green billet may then be presintered or fully sintered to further<br>
consolidate and densify the powder. Presintering results in only a partial consolidation<br>
and densification of the part. A green billet may be presintered at a lower temperature<br>
than the temperature to be reached in the final sintering operation to produce a<br>
presintered billet ("brown billet"). A brown billet has relatively low hardness and<br>
strength as compared to the final fully sintered article, but significantly higher than the<br>
green billet. During manufacturing the article may be machined as a green billet, brown<br>
billet, or as a fully sintered article. Typically, the machinability of a green or brown<br>
billet is substantially easier than the machinability of the fully sintered article.<br>
Machining a green billet or a brown billet may be advantageous if the fully sintered part<br>
is difficult to machine or would require grinding to meet the required dimensional final<br>
tolerances rather than machining. Other means to improve machinability of the part may<br>
also be employed such as addition of machining agents to close the porosity of the billet,<br>
a typical machining agent is a polymer. Finally, sintering at liquid phase temperature in<br>
conventional vacuum furnaces or at high pressures in a SinterHip furnace may be carried<br>
out. The billet may be over pressure sintered at a pressure of 300-2000 psi and at a<br>
temperature of 1350-1500°C. Pre-sintering and sintering of the billet causes removal of<br>
lubricants, oxide reduction, densification, and microstructure development. As stated<br>
above, subsequent to sintering, the bit body, roller cone, insert roller cone or cone may<br>
be further appropriately machined or grinded to form the final configuration.<br>
The present invention also includes a method of producing a bit body, roller<br>
cone, insert roller cone or cone with regions of different properties of compositions. An<br>
embodiment of the method includes placing a first metallurgical powder into a first<br>
region of a void within a mold and second metallurgical powder in a second region of<br>
the void of the mold. In some embodiments, the mold may be segregated into the two or<br>
more regions by, for example, placing a physical partition, such as paper or a polymeric<br><br>
material, in the void of the mold to separate the regions. The metallurgical powders may<br>
be chosen to provide, after consolidation and sintering, cemented carbide materials<br>
having the desired properties as described above. In another embodiment, a portion of at<br>
least the first metallurgical powder and the second metallurgical powder are placed in<br>
contact, without partitions, within the mold. A wax or other binder may be used with the<br>
metallurgical powders to help form the regions without use of physical partitions.<br>
An article with a gradient change in properties or composition may also be<br>
formed by, for example, placing a first metallurgical powder in a first region of a mold.<br>
A second portion of the mold may then be filled with a metallurgical powder comprising<br>
a blend of the first metallurgical powder and a second metallurgical powder. The blend<br>
would result in an article having at least one property between the same property in an<br>
article formed by the first and second metallurgical powder independently. This process<br>
may be repeated until the desired composition gradient or compositional structure is<br>
complete in the mold and, typically would end with filling a region of the mold with the<br>
second metallurgical powder. Embodiments of this process may also be performed with<br>
or without physical partitions. Additional regions may be filled with different materials,<br>
such as a third metallurgical powder or even a previously copper alloy infiltrated article.<br>
The mold may then be isostatically compressed to consolidate the metallurgical powders<br>
to form a billet. The billet is subsequently sintered to further densify the billet and to<br>
form an autogenous bond between the regions.<br>
Any binder may be used, as previously described, such as nickel, cobalt, iron and<br>
alloys of nickel, cobalt, and iron. Additionally, in certain embodiments, the binder used<br>
to fabricate the bit body may have a melting point between 1050°C and 1350oC. As<br>
used herein, the melting point or the melting temperature is the solidus of the particular<br>
composition. In other embodiments, the binder comprises an alloy of at least one of<br>
cobalt, iron, and nickel, wherein the alloy has a melting point of less than 1350°C. In<br>
other embodiments of the composition of the present invention, the composition<br>
comprises at least one of cobalt, nickel, and iron and a melting point reducing<br>
constituent. Pure cobalt, nickel, and iron are characterized by high melting points<br>
(approximately 1500°C), and hence the infiltration of beds of hard particles by pure<br>
molten cobalt, iron, or nickel is difficult to accomplish in a practical manner without<br>
formation of excessive porosity or undesirable phases. However, an alloy of at least one<br><br>
of cobalt, iron, nickel may be used if it includes a sufficient amount of at least one<br>
melting point reducing constituent. The melting point reducing constituent may be at<br>
least one of a transition metal carbide, a transition element, tungsten, carbon, boron,<br>
silicon, chromium, manganese, silver, aluminum, copper, tin, zinc, as well as other<br>
elements that alone or in combination can be added in amounts that reduce the melting<br>
point of the binder sufficiendy so that the binder may be used effectively to form a bit<br>
body by the selected method. A binder may effectively be used to form a bit body if the<br>
binder's properties, for example, melting point, molten viscosity, and infiltration<br>
distance, are such that the bit body may be cast without an excessive amount of porosity.<br>
Preferably, the melting point reducing constituent is at least one of a transition metal<br>
carbide, a transition metal, tungsten, carbon, boron, silicon, chromium and manganese.<br>
It may be preferable to combine two or more of the above melting point reducing<br>
constituents to obtain a binder effective for infiltrating a mass of hard particles. For<br>
example, tungsten and carbon may be added together to produce a greater melting point<br>
reduction than produced by the addition of tungsten alone and, in such a case, the <br>
tungsten and carbon may be added in the form of tungsten carbide. Other melting point<br>
reducing constituents may be added in a similar manner.<br>
The one or more melting point reducing constituents may be added alone or in<br>
combination with odier binder constituents in any amount that produces a binder<br>
composition effective for producing a bit body. In addition, the one or more melting<br>
point reducing constituents may be added such that the binder is a eutectic or near<br>
eutectic composition. Providing a binder with eutectic or near-eutectic concentration of<br>
ingredients ensures mat the binder will have a lower melting point, which may facilitate<br>
casting and infiltrating the bed of hard particles. In certain embodiments, it is preferable<br>
for the one or more melting point reducing constituents to be present in the binder in the <br>
following weight percentage based on the total binder weight: tungsten may be present<br>
up to 55%, carbon may be present up to 4%, boron may be present up to 10%, silicon<br>
may be present up to 20%, chromium may be present up to 20%, and manganese may be<br>
present up to 25%. In certain odier embodiments, it may be preferable for the one or<br>
more melting point reducing constituents to be present in the binder in one or more of the <br>
following weight percentage based on the total binder weight: tungsten may be<br>
present from 30 to 55%, carbon may be present from 1.5 to 4%, boron may be present<br><br>
from 1 to 10%, silicon may be present from 2 to 20%, chromium may be present from 2<br>
to 20%, and manganese may be present from 10 to 25%. In certain other embodiments<br>
of the composition of the present invention the melting point reducing constituent may<br>
be tungsten carbide present from 30 to 60 weight %. Under certain casting conditions<br>
and binder concentrations, all or a portion of the tungsten carbide will precipitate from<br>
the binder upon freezing and will form a hard phase. This precipitated hard phase may<br>
be in addition to any hard phase present as hard particles in the mold. However, if no<br>
hard particles are disposed in the mold or in a section of the mold all the hard phase<br>
particles in the bit body or in the section of the bit body may be formed as tungsten<br>
carbide precipitated during casting.<br>
Embodiments of the articles of the present invention may include 50% or greater<br>
volumes of hard particles or hard phase, in certain embodiments it may be preferable for<br>
the hard particles or hard phase to comprise between 50 and 80 volume % of the article,<br>
more preferably, for such embodiments the hard phase may comprise between 60 and 80<br>
volume % of the article. As such, in certain embodiments, the binder phase may<br>
comprise less than 50 volume % of the article, or preferably between 20 and 50 volume<br>
% of the article. In certain embodiments, the binder may comprise between 20 and 40<br>
volume % of the article.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention also comprise bit bodies for earth-boring<br>
bits and other articles comprising transition metal carbides wherein the bit body<br>
comprises a volume fraction of tungsten carbide greater than 75 volume %. It is now<br>
possible to prepare bit bodies having such a volume fraction of, for example, tungsten<br>
carbide due to the method of the present invention, embodiments of which are described<br>
below. An embodiment of the method comprises infiltrating a bed of tungsten carbide<br>
hard particles with a binder that is a eutectic or near eutectic composition of at least one<br>
of cobalt, iron, and nickel and tungsten carbide. It is believed that bit bodies comprising<br>
concentrations of discontinuous phase tungsten carbide of up to 95% by volume may be<br>
produced by methods of the present invention if a bed of tungsten is infiltrated with a<br>
molten eutectic or near eutectic composition of tungsten carbide and at least one of<br>
cobalt, iron, and nickel. In contrast, conventional infiltration methods for producing bit<br>
bodies may only be used to produce bit bodies having a maximum of about 72% by<br>
volume tungsten carbide. The inventors have determined that the volume concentration<br><br>
of tungsten carbide in the cast bit body and other articles can be 75% up to 95% if using<br>
as infiltrated a eutectic or near eutectic composition of tungsten carbide and at least one<br>
of cobalt, iron, and nickel. Presently, there are limitations in the volume percentage of<br>
hard phase that may be formed in a bit body due to limitations in the packing density of<br>
a mold with hard particles and the difficulties in infiltrating a densely packed mass of<br>
hard particles. However, precipitating carbide from an infiltrant binder comprising a<br>
eutectic or near eutectic composition avoids these difficulties. Upon freezing of the<br>
binder in the bit body mold, the additional hard phase is formed by precipitation from<br>
the molten infiltrant during cooling. Therefore, a greater concentration of hard phase is<br>
formed in the bit body than could be achieved if the molten binder lack dissolved<br>
tungsten carbide. Use of molten binder/infiltrant compositions at or near the eutectic<br>
allows higher volume percentages of. hard phase in bit bodies and other articles than<br>
previously available.<br>
The volume percent of tungsten carbide in the bit body may be additionally<br>
increased by incorporating cemented carbide inserts into the bit body. The cemented<br>
carbide inserts may be used for forming internal fluid courses, pockets for cutting<br>
elements, ridges, lands, nozzle displacements, junk slots, or other topographical features<br>
of the bit body, or merely to provide structural support, stiffness, toughness, strength, or<br>
wear resistance at selected locations with the body or holder. Conventional cemented<br>
carbide inserts may comprise from 70 to 99 volume % of tungsten carbide if prepared by<br>
conventional cemented carbide techniques. Any known cemented carbide may be used<br>
as inserts in the bit body, such as, but not limited to, composites of carbides of at least<br>
one of titanium, zirconium, hafnium, vanadium, niobium, tantalum, chromium,<br>
molybdenum and tungsten in a binder of at least one of cobalt, iron, and nickel.<br>
Additional alloying agents may be present in the cemented carbides as are known in the<br>
art.<br>
Embodiments of the composition for forming a bit body also comprise at least<br>
one hard particle type. As stated above, the bit body also may comprise various regions<br>
comprising different types and/or concentrations of hard particles. For example, bit<br>
body 10 of Figure 1 may comprise a bottom section 15 of a harder wear resistant<br>
discontinuous hard phase material with a fine particle size and a mid section 14 of a<br>
tougher discontinuous hard phase material with a relatively coarse particle size. The<br><br>
hard phase or hard particles of any section may comprise at least one carbide, nitride,<br>
boride, oxide, cast carbide, cemented carbide, mixtures thereof, and solid solutions<br>
thereof. In certain embodiments, the hard phase may comprise at least one cemented<br>
carbide comprising at least one of titanium, zirconium, hafnium, vanadium, niobium,<br>
tantalum, chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten. The cemented carbides may have any<br>
suitable particle size or shape, such as, but not limited to, irregular, spherical, oblate and<br>
prolate shapes.<br>
Cemented carbide grades with tungsten carbide in a cobalt binder have a<br>
commercially attractive combination of strength, fracture toughness and wear resistance.<br>
"Strength" is the stress at which a material ruptures or fails. "Toughness" is the ability<br>
of a material to absorb energy and deform plastically before fracturing. Toughness is<br>
proportional to the area under the stress-strain curve from the origin to the breaking<br>
point. See MCGRAW-HILL DICTIONARY OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL TERMS (5th ed.<br>
1994). "Wear resistance" is the ability of a material to withstand damage to its surface.<br>
Wear generally involves progressive loss of material, due to a relative motion between a<br>
material and a contacting surface or substance. See METALS HANDBOOK DESK EDITION<br>
(2d ed. 1998). "Fracture Toughness" is the critical stress at a crack tip necessary to<br>
propagate that crack and is usually characterized by the "critical stress intensity factor<br>
(Klc).<br>
The strength, toughness and wear resistance of a cemented carbide are related to<br>
the average grain size of the dispersed hard phase and me volume (or weight) fraction of <br>
the binder phase present in the conventional cemented carbide. Generally, an increase in <br>
the average grain size of tungsten carbide and/or an increase in the volume fraction of<br>
me cobalt binder will result in an increase in fracture toughness. However, this increase<br>
in toughness is generally accompanied by a decrease in wear resistance. The cemented<br>
carbide metallurgist is thus challenged to develop cemented carbides with bom high<br>
wear resistance and high fracture toughness while attempting to design grades for<br>
demanding applications.<br>
The bit body 140 of Figure 14 may comprise sections comprising different<br>
concentrations or compositions of components to provide various properties to specific<br>
locations within the body, such as wear resistance, toughness, or corrosion resistance.<br>
For example, the insert pocket regions 141 in the area around the drill bit cutting inserts<br><br><br>
142, the gage pad 143, or nozzle outlet region 144, a roller cone blade region, or the<br>
exterior of the crown 145 may comprise a more wear resistant material. In addition,<br>
embodiments of the bit body of the present invention may have regions of high<br>
toughness, such as in the internal region of a blade 146, an internal region of a roller<br>
cone, at least an internal region of the shank or pin, or a region adjacent to the shank.<br>
The properties of different regions of the bit body, roller cone, insert roller cone, or cone<br>
may also be tailored to provide a region that is more easily machined or corrosion<br>
resistant, for example.<br>
Embodiments of the bit body, roller cone, insert roller cone, or cone may<br>
comprise unique properties that may not be achieved in conventional bit bodies, roller<br>
cones, insert roller cones, and cones. Samples of compositions suitable for the present<br>
invention were produced for testing. The nominal compositions of the test samples are<br>
shown in Table 1.<br><br>
As can be seen from Table 2, embodiments of the present invention comprise<br>
body materials having transverse rupture strength greater than 300 ksi. Conventional bit<br>
bodies comprising body materials of steel or hard particles infiltrated with brass or<br>
bronze do not have transverse rupture strengths as high as the embodiments of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Figures 15a, 15b and 15c are graphs of fully reversed Rotating Beam Fatigue<br>
Data for test samples of composition suitable for embodiments of the present invention<br>
listed in Table 1. As can be seen, test samples have a fully reversed bending stress of<br>
greater than 100 ksi at (10)7 cycles.<br>
Several properties of the body materials of the regions of earth boring tools<br>
contribute to the service life of tool. These properties of the body materials include, but<br>
may not be limited to, strength, stiffness, wear or abrasion resistance, and fatigue<br>
resistance. A bit body, roller one, insert roller cone, or cone may comprise more than<br><br>
one region each comprising different body materials. Strength is typically measured as a<br>
transverse rapture strength or ultimate tensile strength. Stiffness may be measured as a<br>
Young's modulus. The properties of embodiments of the present invention and prior art<br>
copper based matrices are listed in Table 2. As can be seen, the embodiments of the<br>
present invention have TRS values greater man 250 psi, in certain embodiments the TRS<br>
may be greater than 300 ksi or even greater than 400 ksi. The Young's modulus of<br>
embodiments of the present invention exceed 55 xlO6 psi, and, preferably, for certain<br>
applications requiring greater stiffness, embodiments may have a Young's modulus of<br>
greater than 75 x 106 psi or even greater than 90 x 106 psi. In addition to the favorable<br>
TRS and Young's modulus values, embodiments of the present invention additionally<br>
comprise an increased hardness. Embodiments of the present invention may be tailored<br>
to have a hardness of greater than 65 HRA or by reducing the concentration of binder,<br>
for example, the hardness of specific embodiments may be increased to greater than 75<br>
HRA or even greater than 85 HRA in certain embodiments.<br>
The abrasion resistance, as measured according to ASTM B611, of embodiments<br>
of the body materials of the present invention may be greater than 1.0, or greater than<br>
1.4. In certain applications or regions of the earth boring tool, embodiments fo the body<br>
materials of the present invention may have an abrasion resistance of from 2 to 14.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention comprise body materials that also include<br>
combinations of properties that are applicable for the bit bodies, roller cones, insert roller<br>
cones, and cones. For example, embodiments of the present invention may comprise a<br>
body material having a transverse rupture strength greater than 200 ksi together, or<br>
greater than 250 ksi, with a Young's modulus greater than 40 x 106 psi. Other<br>
embodiments of the present invention may comprise a body material having a fatigue<br>
resistance greater than 30 ksi in combination with a Young's modulus greater than 30 x<br>
106 psi. Such combinations of properties provide drilling articles that in certain<br>
applications will have a greater service life than conventional drilling articles.<br><br><br><br>
Additionally, certain embodiments of the composition of the present invention<br>
may comprise from 30 to 95 volume % of hard phase and from 5 to 70 volume % of<br>
binder phase. Isolated regions of the bit body may be within a broader range of hard<br>
phase concentrations, from for example, 30 to 99 volume % hard phase. This may be<br>
accomplished, for example, by disposing hard particles in various packing densities in<br>
certain locations within the mold or by a placing cemented carbide inserts in the mold<br>
prior to casting the bit body or other article. Additionally, the bit body may be formed<br>
by casting more than one binder into the mold.<br>
A difficulty with fabricating a bit body or holder comprising a binder including at<br>
least one of cobalt, iron, and nickel by an infiltration method stems from the relatively<br>
high melting points of cobalt, iron, and nickel. The melting point of each of these metals<br>
at atmospheric pressure is approximately 1500°C. In addition, since cobalt, iron, and<br>
nickel have high solubilities in the liquid state for tungsten carbide, it is difficult to<br>
prevent premature freezing of, for example, a molten cobalt-tungsten or nickel-tungsten<br>
carbide alloy while attempting to infiltrate a bed of tungsten carbide particles when<br>
casting an earth-boring bit body. This phenomenon may lead to the formation of<br>
pin-holes in the casting even with the use of high temperatures, such as greater than<br>
1400°C, during the infiltration process.<br>
Embodiments of the method of the present invention may overcome the<br>
difficulties associated with cobalt, iron and nickel infiltrated cast composites by use of a<br>
prealloyed cobalt-tungsten carbide eutectic or near eutectic composition (30 to 60%<br>
tungsten carbide and 40 to 70% cobalt, by weight). For example, a cobalt alloy having a<br>
concentration of approximately 43 weight % of tungsten carbide has a melting point of<br><br>
approximately 1300oC. See Figure 2. The lower melting point of the eutectic or<br>
near-eutectic alloy relative to cobalt, iron, and nickel, along with the negligible freezing<br>
range of the eutectic or near eutectic composition, can greatly facilitate the fabrication of<br>
cobalt-tungsten carbide based diamond bit bodies, as well as cemented carbide cones and<br>
roller cone bits. Eutectic or near-eutectic mixtures of cobalt-tungsten carbide, nickel-<br>
tungsten carbide, cobalt-nickel-tungsten carbide and iron-tungsten carbide alloys, for<br>
example, can be expected to exhibit far higher strength and toughness levels compared<br>
with brass- and bronze-based composites at equivalent abrasion/erosion resistance<br>
levels. These alloys can also be expected to be machineable using conventional cutting<br>
tools.<br>
Certain embodiments of the method of the invention comprise infiltrating a mass<br>
of hard particles with a binder that is a eutectic or near eutectic composition comprising<br>
at least one of cobalt, iron, and nickel and tungsten carbide, and wherein the binder has a<br>
melting point less than 1350°C. As used herein, a near eutectic concentration means that<br>
the concentrations of the major constituents of the composition are within 10 weight %<br>
of the eutectic concentrations of the constituents. The eutectic concentration of tungsten<br>
carbide in cobalt is approximately 43 weight percent. Eutectic compositions are known<br>
or easily approximated by one skilled in the art. Casting the eutectic or near eutectic<br>
composition may be performed with or without hard particles in the mold. However, it<br>
may be preferable that upon solidification the composition forms a precipitated hard<br>
tungsten carbide phase and a binder phase. The binder may further comprise alloying<br>
agents, such as at least one of boron, silicon, chromium, manganese, silver, aluminum,<br>
copper, tin, and zinc.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention may comprise as one aspect the<br>
fabrication of bodies and cones from eutectic or near-eutectic compositions employing<br>
several different methods. Examples of these methods include:<br>
1. Infiltrating a bed or mass of hard particles comprising a mixture of<br>
transition metal carbide particles and at least one of cobalt, iron, and nickel (i.e., a<br>
cemented carbide) with a molten infiltrant that is a eutectic or near eutectic composition<br>
of a carbide and at least one of cobalt, iron, and nickel.<br><br>
2.	Infiltrating a bed or mass of transition metal carbide particles with a<br>
molten infiltrant that is a eutectic or near eutectic composition of a carbide and at least<br>
one of cobalt, iron, and nickel.<br>
3.	Casting a molten eutectic or near eutectic composition of a carbide, such<br>
as tungsten carbide, and at least one of cobalt, iron, and nickel to net-shape or a<br>
near-net-shape in the form of a bit body, roller cone, or cone.<br>
4.	Mixing powdered binder and hard particles together, placing the mixture<br>
in a mold, heating the powders to a temperature greater than the melting point of the<br>
binder, and cooling to cast the materials into the form of an earth-boring bit body, a<br>
roller cone, or a cone. This so-called "casting in place" method may allow the use of<br>
binders with relatively less capacity for infiltrating a mass of hard particles since the<br>
binder is mixed with the hard particles prior to melting and, therefore, shorter infiltration<br>
distances are required to form the article.<br>
In certain methods of the present invention, infiltrating the hard particles may<br>
include loading a funnel with a binder, melting the binder, and introducing the binder<br>
into the mold with the hard particles and, optionally, the inserts. The binder as discussed<br>
above may be a eutectic or near eutectic composition or may comprise at least one of<br>
cobalt, iron, and nickel and at least one melting point reducing constituent.<br>
Another method of the present invention comprises preparing a mold and casting<br>
a eutectic or near eutectic mixture of at least one of cobalt, iron, and nickel and a hard<br>
phase component. As the eutectic mixture cools the hard phase may precipitate from the <br>
 mixture to form the hard phase. This metiiod may be useful for the formation of roller<br>
cones and teeth in tri-cone drill bits.<br>
Anodier embodiment of the present invention involves casting in place,<br>
mentioned above. An example of this embodiment comprises preparing a mold, adding<br>
a mixture of hard particles and binder to the mold, and heating the mold above the <br>
melting temperature of the binder. This metiiod results in the casting in place of the bit<br>
body, roller cone, and teeth for tri-cone drill bits. This method may be preferable when <br>
the expected infiltration distance of the binder is not sufficient for sufficiendy infiltrating <br>
the hard particles conventionally.<br>
The hard particles or hard phase may comprise one or more of carbides, oxides,<br>
borides, and nitrides, and the binder phase may be composed of the one or more of the<br><br>
Group VIE metals, namely, Co, Ni, and/or Fe. The morphology of the hard phase can be<br>
in the form of irregular, equiaxed, or spherical particles, fibers, whiskers, platelets,<br>
prisms, or any other useful form. In certain embodiments, the cobalt, iron, and nickel<br>
alloys useful in this invention can contain additives, such as boron, chromium, silicon,<br>
aluminum, copper, manganese, or ruthenium, in total amounts up to 20 weight % of the<br>
ductile continuous phase.<br>
The enclosed Figures 2 to 8 are graphs of the results of Differential Thermal<br>
Analysis (DTA) on embodiments of the binders of the present invention. Figure 2 is a<br>
graph of the results of a two cycle DTA, from 900°C to 1400°C at a rate of temperature<br>
increase of 10°C/minute in an argon atmosphere, of a sample comprising about 45%<br>
tungsten carbide and about 55% cobalt (all percentages are in weight percent unless<br>
noted otherwise). The graph shows the melting point of the alloy to be approximately<br>
1339°C.<br>
Figure 3 is a graph of the results of a two cycle DTA, from 900°C to 1300°C at a<br>
rate of temperature increase of 10°C/minute in an argon atmosphere, of a sample<br>
comprising about 45% tungsten carbide, about 53% cobalt, and about 2% boron. The<br>
graph shows the melting point of the alloy to be approximately 1151°C. As compared to<br>
the DTA of the alloy of Figure 2, the replacement of about 2% of cobalt with boron<br>
reduced the melting point of the alloy in Figure 3 almost 200°C.<br>
Figure 4 is a graph of the results of a two cycle DTA, from 900°C to 1400°C at a<br>
rate of temperature increase of 10°C/minute in an argon atmosphere, of a sample<br>
comprising about 45% tungsten carbide, about 53% nickel, and about 2% boron. The<br>
graph shows the melting point of the alloy to be approximately 1089°C. As compared to<br>
the DTA of the alloy of Figure 3, the replacement of cobalt with nickel reduced the <br>
melting point of the alloy in Figure 4 almost 60°C.<br>
Figure 5 is a graph of the results of a two cycle DTA, from 900°C to 1200°C at a<br>
rate of temperature increase of 10°C/minute in an argon atmosphere, of a sample<br>
comprising about 96.3% nickel and about 3.7% boron. The graph shows the melting<br>
point of the alloy to be approximately 1100°C.<br>
Figure 6 is a graph of the results of a two cycle DTA, from 900°C to 1300°C at a<br>
rate of temperature increase of 10°C/minute in an argon atmosphere, of a sample<br><br>
comprising about 88.4% nickel and about 11.6% silicon. The graph shows the melting<br>
point of the alloy to be approximately 1150°C.<br>
Figure 7 is a graph of the results of a two cycle DTA, from 900°C to 1200°C at a<br>
rate of temperature increase of 10oC/minute in an argon atmosphere, of a sample<br>
comprising about 96% cobalt and about 4% boron. The graph shows the melting point<br>
of the alloy to be approximately 1100°C.<br>
Figure 8 is a graph of the results of a two cycle DTA, from 900°C to 1300°C at a<br>
rate of temperature increase of 10cC/minute in an argon atmosphere, of a sample<br>
comprising about 87.5% cobalt and about 12.5% silicon. The graph shows the melting<br>
point of the alloy to be approximately 1200°C.<br>
Figures 9 to 11 show photomicrographs of materials formed by embodiments of<br>
the methods of the present invention. Figure 9 is a scanning electron microscope (SEM)<br>
photomicrograph of a material produced by casting a binder consisting essentially of a<br>
eutectic mixture of cobalt and boron, wherein the boron is present at about 4 weight<br>
percent of the binder. The lighter colored phase 92 is C03B and the darker phase 91 is<br>
essentially cobalt. The cobalt and boron mixture was melted by heating to<br>
approximately 1200°C then allowed to cool in air to room temperature and solidify.<br>
Figures 10 - 12 are SEM photomicrographs of different pieces and different<br>
aspects of the microstructure made from the same material. The material was formed by<br>
infiltrating hard particles with a binder. The hard particles were an cast carbide<br>
aggregate (W2C, WC) comprising approximately 60 - 65 volume percent of the material.<br>
The aggregate was infiltrated by a binder comprising approximately 96 weight percent<br>
cobalt and 4 weight percent boron. The infiltration temperature was approximately<br>
1285°C.<br>
Figure 13 is a photomicrograph of a material produced by infiltrating a mass of<br>
cast carbide particles 130 and a cemented carbide insert 131 with a binder consisting<br>
essentially of cobalt and boron. To produce the material shown in Figure 13, a cemented<br>
carbide insert 131 of approximately 3/4" diameter by 1.5" height was placed in the mold<br>
prior to infiltrating the mass of hard cast carbide particles 130 with a binder comprising<br>
cobalt and boron. As may be seen in Figure 13, the infiltrated binder and the binder of<br>
the cemented carbide blended to form one continuous matrix 132 binding both the cast<br>
carbides and the carbides of the cemented carbide.<br><br>
In addition, hard facing may be added to embodiments of the present invention.<br>
Hard facing may be added on bit bodies, roller cones, insert roller cones, and cones<br>
wherever increased wear resistance is desired. For example, roller cone 160, as shown<br>
in Figure 16, may comprise a hard facing on the plurality of teeth 161, the spear point<br>
162. The bit body for the roller cone may also comprise hard facing, such as in a region<br>
surrounding any nozzles. Referring to Figure 14, the bit body may comprise hard facing<br>
in the regions of nozzles 144, gage pad 143, and insert pockets 141, for example. A<br>
typical hard facing material comprises tungsten carbide in an alloy steel matrix.<br>
It is to be understood that the present description illustrates those aspects of the<br>
invention relevant to a clear understanding of the invention. Certain aspects of the<br>
invention that would be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art and that, therefore,<br>
would not facilitate a better understanding of the invention have not been presented in<br>
order to simplify the present description. Although embodiments of the present<br>
invention have been described, one of ordinary skill in the art will, upon considering the<br>
foregoing description, recognize that many modifications and variations of the invention<br>
may be employed. All such variations and modifications of the invention are intended to<br>
be covered by the foregoing description and the following claims.<br><br><br>
