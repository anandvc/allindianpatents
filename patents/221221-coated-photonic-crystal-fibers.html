COATED PHOTONIC CRYSTAL FIBERS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to coated photonic crystal fibers.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Recently the optical fiber art has seen the development of so-called photonic crystal fibers. These fibers rely on Bragg reflections to propagate light signals and are less sensitive to microbending than conventional optical fibers. Such photonic fibers have been the subject of several recent US Patents. See, for instance, US Patents 6,243,522 B1; 6,301,420 B1; and 6,334,017 B1. Little or no attention has been paid, however, to providing coatings that suitably protect the photonic crystal fibers' strength and integrity while preserving or even improving advantages that photonic crystal fibers provide, such as the resistance to microbending.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides coated photonic crystal fibers.<br>
In one embodiment the present invention provides a coated photonic crystal fiber comprising: (i)        a photonic crystal fiber; and (ii)       at least one coating obtained by curing a resin composition.<br>
Another example of an embodiment provided by the present invention is a coated photonic crystal fiber comprising: (i)        a photonic crystal fiber; and (ii)       at least one coating having a refractive index below 1.45.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to coated photonic crystal fibers. Photonic crystal fibers are disclosed in, for instance, U.S. Patent 6,243,522 B1, U.S. Patent 6,301,420 B1, and U.S. Patent 6,334,017 B1, which three patents are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference. Commercial suppliers of photonic crystal fibers include Omniguide (US), Crystal Fibre (Denmark), and BlazePhotonics (UK).<br><br>
According to the present invention, the photonic crystal fibers have at least one coating. Preferred coatings - being in contact with the crystal fiber - include those that are obtained by curing a resin domposition and/or that have a refractive index below 1.45, such as below 1.43, below 1.40, below 1.37, or below 1.35.<br>
As noted, the present at least one coating may be obtained by curing a coating resin composition, preferably by exposing a curable resin composition to heat or radiation. Preferably, the resin composition is curable by at least radiation, for instance by electron beam radiatioii or ultraviolet radiation.<br>
Preferably, the photonic crystal fiber will have at least one coating having one or more, more preferably three or more, most preferably all five, of the following properties:<br>
(a)	an elongation to break of at least 25% (e.g. &gt;50%, &gt;75%, or &gt;100%);<br>
(b)	a secant modulus below 100 MPa (e.g. 
(c)	an adhesion to glass at 50% RH of at least 0.2 N (e.g. &gt;0.30N, &gt;0.40N, or &gt;0.50N);<br>
(d)	an adhesion to glass at 95% RH of at least 0.02 N (e.g. &gt;0.05N, &gt;0.15N, or &gt;0.35N); and<br>
(e)	a water sensitivity of less than 10 wt% (e.g. 
In one embodiment, it is preferred that the optical fiber is surrounded by at least two coatings obtained by curing a resin composition, for instance by a soft primary coating layer of a flexible resin (low modulus and low Tg) which is coated directly onto the cladding, and a secondary coating layer of a rigid resin (higher modulus and higher Tg) which is provided over the primary coating layer. For identification purposes, it may be beneficial to further provide an ink coating over the secondary coating, or to add a colorant to the secondary coating itself prior to curing.<br>
Preferred primary coatings include those having one or more of the following properties: (i)        an elongation to break of at least 75%, for instance at least 100% or at least<br>
150%, and generally below 400%; (ii)       a glass transition temperature (Tg) of at most 10°C, for instance less than 0°C,<br>
Less than -10°C, less than -20°C, or less than -40°C, and generally above -<br>

MPa, or less than 1.5 MPa, and generally above 0.1 MPa.<br><br>
Preferred secondary coatings include those having one or more of the following properties: (i)        an elongation to break of at most 60%, for instance at most 40% , and generally<br>
above 3%; (ii)       a glass transition temperature (Tg) of at least 30 °C, for instance at least 40 °C, at least 50 °C) at least 70 °C, or at least 90 °C, and generally below 200°C; and (iii)      a secant modulus of at least 100 MPa, for instance at least 300 MPa, at least 500 MPa, or at least 750 M^a, and generally below 2000 MPa.<br>
The coated photonic crystal fiber preferably has an attenuation increase of less than 0.3 dB/km at 1550nm, for instance less than 0.25, less than 0.2, less than 0.15, less than 0.10, less than 0.05, or less than 0.01 dB/km at 1550nm.<br>
In one embodiment, the resin composition comprises an oligomer and, optionally, one or more diluents and photoinitiators. Preferred oligomers include oligomers comprising at least one ethylenically unsaturated group, for instance oligomers comprising one or more (meth)acrylate groups.<br>

If the excited state photoinitiator interacts with a second molecule (a coinitiator) to generate radicals in a bimolecular reaction, the initiating system is termed a Type II photoinitiator. In general, the two main reaction pathways for Type II photoinitiators are hydrogen abstraction by the excited initiator or photoinduced electron transfer, followed by fragmentation. Examples of suitable free-radical photoinitiators are disclosed in WO 00/18696 which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. In one embodiment, the coating compositions comprise at least one photoinitiator having a phosphorous, sulfur or nitrogen atom. In another embodiment, the coating compositions comprise at least a combination of a photoinitiator containing a phosphorous atom and a photoinitiator containing a sulfur atom. In another embodiment, the compositions comprise at least one oligomeric or polymeric photoinitiators.<br>
The present compositions generally comprise less than 10wt%, relative to the total weight of the composition, of photoinitiator, for instance less than 8wt%, less than 6wt%, or less than 4wt%.<br>
In addition to the above-described components, various additives such as antioxidants, UV absorbers, light stabilizers, silane coupling agents (e.g. mercaptofunctional silane coupling agents in an amount of 0.25-10 wt%, e.g. 0.5-5wt% or about 1wt%), coating surface improvers, heat polymerization inhibitors, epoxy-<br><br>
functional components, leveling agents, surfactants, colorants, preservatives, plasticizers, lubricants, solvents, fillers, aging preventives, and wettability improvers can be used in the liquid curable resin composition of the present invention, as required. If the composition comprises epoxy-functional components, it is often preferred to further include one or more cationic photoinitiators {e.g. one or more onium salts).<br>
The compositions for coating the photonic crystal fibers preferably have a viscosity below 15,000 cps at 25°C, for instance below 10,000 cps, below 8,000 cps, or below 6,000 cps. The viscosity will generally be at least 500 cps at 25°C, for instance at least 1,000cps, at least 2,000 cps, or at least 3,000 cps.<br>
The coated and photonic fibers may be used in a ribbon comprising a plurality of said fibers, generally in a parallel arrangement. The plurality of fibers is further coated with one or more matrix materials in order to obtain a ribbon. The present invention therefore further relates to a ribbon comprising a plurality of coated photonic crystal fibers, generally in a parallel arrangement.<br>

TEST METHODS<br>
Tensile Strength, Elongation, and Modulus Test Method<br>
The tensile properties (tensile strength, percent elongation at break, and modulus) of cured samples were determined using an Instron model 4201 universal testing instrument. Samples were prepared for testing by curing a 75-pm film of the material using a Fusion UV processor. Samples were cured at 1.0 J/cm in a nitrogen atmosphere. Test specimens having a width of 0.5 inches and a length of 5 inches were cut from the film. The exact thickness of each specimen was measured with a micrometer.<br><br>
For soft coatings (e.g., those with a modulus of less than about 10 MPa), the coating was drawn down and cured on a glass plate and the individual specimens cut from the glass plate with a scalpel. A 2-lb load cell was used in the Instron and modulus was calculated at 2.5% elongation with a least squares fit of the -stress-strain plot. Cured films were conditioned at 23 ± 1°C and 50 ± 5% relative humidity for a minimum of one hour prior to testing.<br>
For harder coatings, the coating was drawn down on a Mylar film and specimens were cut with a Thwing Albert 0.5-inch precision sample cutter. A 20-lb load cell was used in the Instron and modulus was calculated at 2.5% elongation from the secant at that point. Cured films were conditioned at 23 ± 1°C and 50 ± 5% relative humidity for sixteen hours prior to testing.<br>
For testing specimens, the gage length was 2-inches and the crosshead speed was 1.00 inches/minute. All testing was done at a temperature of 23 ± 1 °C and a relative humidity of 50 ± 5%. All measurements were determined from the average of at least 6 test specimens.<br>
DMA Test Method<br>
Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) was carried out on the test samples, using an RSA-II instrument manufactured by Rheometric Scientific Inc. A free film specimen (typically about 36 mm long, 12 mm wide, and 0.075 mm thick) was mounted in the grips of the instrument, and the temperature initially brought to 80°C and held there for about five minutes. During the latter soak period at 80°C, the sample was stretched by about 2.5% of its original length. Also during this time, information about the sample identity, its dimensions, and the specific test method was entered into the software (RSI Orchestrator) residing on the attached personal computer.<br>
All tests were performed at a frequency of 1.0 radians, with the dynamic temperature step method having 2°C steps, a soak time of 5 to 10 seconds, an initial strain of about 0.001 (ALA), and with autotension and autostrain options activated. The autotension was set to ensure that the sample remained under a tensile force throughout the run, and autostrain was set to allow the strain to be increased as the sample passed through the glass transition and became softer. After the 5 minute soak time, the temperature in the sample oven was reduced in 20°C steps until the starting temperature, typically -80°C or -60°C, was reached. The final temperature of the runfwas entered into the software before starting the run, such that the data for a<br><br>
sample would extend from the glassy region through the transition region and well into the rubbery region.<br>
The run was started and allowed to proceed to completion. After completion of the run, a graph of E\ E", and tan delta, all versus temperature, appeared on the computer screen. The data points on each curve were smoothed, using a program in the software. On this plot, three points representing the glass transition were identified: 1) The temperature at which E' = 1000 MPa; 2) The temperature at which E' = 100 MPsi; 3) The temperature of the peak in the tan delta curve. If the tan delta curve contained more than one peak, the temperature of each peak was measured. One additional value obtained from the graph was the minimum value for E' in the rubbery region. This value was reported as the equilibrium modulus, E0.<br>
Measurement of Dry and Wet Adhesion<br>
Determination of dry and wet adhesion was performed using an Instron model 4201 universal testing instrument. A 75-pm film was drawn down on a polished TLC glass plate and cured using a Fusion UV processor. Samples were cured at 1.0 J/cm2 in a nitrogen atmosphere.<br>
The samples were conditioned at a temperature of 23+1 °C and a relative humidity of 50±5% for a period of 7 days. After conditioning, eight specimens were cut 6 inches long and 1 inch wide with a scalpel in the direction of the draw down. A thin layer of talc was applied to four of the specimens. The first inch of each sample was peeled back from the glass. The glass was secured to a horizontal support on the Instron with the affixed end of the specimen adjacent to a pulley attached to the support and positioned directly underneath the crosshead. A wire was attached to the peeled-back end of the sample, run along the specimen and then run through the pulley in a direction perpendicular to the specimen. The free end of the wire was clamped in the upper jaw of the Instron, which was then activated. The test was continued until the average force value, in grams force/inch, became relatively constant. The crosshead speed was 10 in/min. Dry adhesion was the average of the four specimens.<br>
The remaining four specimens were then conditioned at 23±1 °C and a relative humidity of 95±5% for 24 hours. A thin layer of a polyethylene/water slurry<br><br>
was applied to the surface of the specimens. Testing was then performed as in the previous paragraph. Wet adhesion was the average of the four specimens.<br>
Water Sensitivity<br>
A layer of the composition was cured to provide a UV cured coating test strip (1.5 inch x 1.5 inch x 6 mils). The test strip was weighed and placed in a vial containing deionized water, which was subsequently stored for 3 weeks at 23°C. At periodic intervals, e.g. 30 minutes,'1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 6 hours, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 7 days, 14 days, and 21 days, the test strip was removed from the vial and gently patted dry with a paper towel and reweighed. The percent water absorption was reported as 100(weight after immersion- weight before immersion)/(weight before immersion). The peak water absorption was the highest water absorption value reached during the 3-week immersion period. At the end of the 3-week period, the test strip was dried in a 60-C oven for 1 hour, cooled in a desiccator for 15 minutes, and reweighed. The percent water extractables was reported as 100(weight before immersion - weight after drying)/(weight before immersion). The water sensitivity was reported as (peak water absorption] + |water extractables|. Three test strips were tested to improve the accuracy of the test.<br>
Refractive Index<br>
The refractive index of the cured compositions was determined with the Becke Line method, which entails matching the refractive index of finely cut strips of the cured composition with immersion liquids of known refraction properties. The test was performed under a microscope at 23°C and with light having a wavelength of 589nm.<br>
Viscosity<br>
The viscosity was measured using a Physica MC10 Viscometer. The test samples were examined and if an excessive amount of bubbles was present, steps were taken to remove most of the bubbles. Not all bubbles need to be removed at this stage, because the act of sample loading introduces some bubbles.<br>
The instrument was set up for the conventional Z3 system, which was used. The samples were loaded into a disposable aluminum cup by using the syringe to measure out 17 cc. The sample in the cup was examined and if it contains an excessive amount of bubbles, they were removed by a direct means such as<br><br>
centrifugation, or enough time was allowed to elapse to let the bubbles escape from the bulk of the liquid. Bubbles at the top surface of the liquid are acceptable.<br>
The bob was gently lowered into the liquid in the measuring cup, and the cup and bob were installed in the instrument. The sample temperature was allowed to equilibrate with the temperature of the circulating liquid by waiting five minutes. Then, the rotational speed was set to a desired value which will produce the desired shear rate. The desired value of the shear rate is easily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art from an expected viscosity range of the sample. The shear rate is typically 50-100 sec'1.<br>
The instrument panel read out a viscosity value, and if the viscosity value varied only slightly (less than 2% relative variation) for 15 seconds, the measurement was complete. If not, it is possible that the temperature had not yet reached an equilibrium value, or that the material was changing due to shearing. If the latter case, further testing at different shear rates will be needed to define the sample's viscous properties. The results reported are the average viscosity values of three test samples.<br>
Microbending resistance<br>
The microbending resistance of the coated photonic crystal fiber is measured by determining the attenuation of the coated photonic crystal fiber before and after winding the fiber around a drum (diameter 600mm) covered with sandpaper (40m Alox grade by 3M™). The winding force is kept constant at 4N. The attenuation increase (difference between attenuation before and after winding) is determined at 1550nm.<br>
Having described specific embodiments of the present invention, it will be understood that many modifications thereof will readily be apparent to those skilled in the art, and it is intended therefore that this invention is limited only by the spirit and scope of the following claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
