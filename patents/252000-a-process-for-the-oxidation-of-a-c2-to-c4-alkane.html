				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the oxidation of a C2 to C4 alkane.<br>
The present invention relates to the separation of alkenes from gas mixtures comprising said alkenes, alkanes and oxygen and, in particular, to the separation of ethylene from a mixture of ethylene, ethane and oxygen by absorption in a metallic salt solution.<br>
The present invention also relates to the use of the separation process in (a) hydrocarbon oxidation processes such as the oxidation of a C2 to C4 alkane to produce the corresponding alkene and carboxylic acid and (b) in integrated processes in which the alkene and carboxylic acid produced from a hydrocarbon oxidation process are further used as reactants.<br>
Ethylene and acetic acid may be produced by the catalytic oxidation of ethane. In a typical oxidation process to produce ethylene and acetic acid, ethane, oxygen and optionally ethylene and/or water are introduced into a reactor. The reactants are contacted with an oxidation catalyst such as a molybdenum/niobium/vanadium containing catalyst and react to produce an outlet stream compnsing ethylene ( either as product or unreacted feed), acetic acid, unreacted ethane and unreacted oxygen. The outlet stream is removed from the reactor, condensed and separated into a gaseous stream and a liquid stream. The gaseous stream comprising ethane, ethylene and oxygen may be further purified to obtain ethylene therefrom. The liquid stream comprising acetic acid and water may be further purified.<br>
It is known that the separation of ethylene from hydrocarbons such as ethane may be earned out by distillative processes such as cryogenic distillation and adsorption techniques such as pressure swing adsorption and reactive adsorption. In addition, where the alkane/alkene gas mixture comprises oxygen, such as the gas mixture produced by the oxydehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene as described, for example, in EP-A-0 262 264, the oxygen is traditionally removed prior to separation of the alkene from the alkane. If the oxygen is not removed prior to the separation of the hydrocarbons, the separation process can concentrate the oxygen such that the oxygen-containing stream becomes flammable or explosive.<br>
EP-A-0 943 595 describes a process for separating an alkene such as ethylene from a gas mixture comprising the alkene and an alkane such as ethane by a pressure swing absorption process comprising the steps of passing the gas mixture through a type A zeolite having exchangeable sodium and potassium ions and regenerating the zeolite to produce an alkene-enriched gas. Such a pressure swing adsorption system is mechanically complex and a single adsorption cycle gives only a small enhancement of ethylene concentration. No mention is made of the separation of alkenes from gas mixtures comprising alkenes, alkanes and oxygen.<br>
WO 00/37399 describes a process for the auto-thermal cracking of paraffinic hydrocarbons with oxygen in which process the product stream comprises ethylene, propene, butene and carbon monoxide. Ethylene and propene are separated from the product stream by contacting the product stream with a solution of a metallic salt capable of selectively absorbing the ethylene and propene and recovering the ethylene and/or propene from the metallic salt. Prior to treatment with the metallic salt solution, the product stream is treated to remove components such as oxygen and carbon dioxide.<br>
The products of the catalytic oxidation of ethane, ethylene and acetic acid, may be reacted in downstream processes to produce alkyl carboxylates such as ethyl acetate or alkenyl carboxylates such as vinyl acetate.<br>
In view of the above there remains the need for an alternative and/or improved process for separating alkenes from a gas mixture comprising said alkenes, alkanes and oxygen.<br>
We have now found that alkene may be separated from a gas mixture comprising said alkene, alkane and oxygen without the need for prior removal of the oxygen.<br>
In addition, we have found that the separation of alkene from a gas mixture comprising said alkene, alkane and oxygen may be carried out in fewer processing<br>
stages than is required by the prior art.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for separating an alkene from a gas mixture comprising said alkene, an alkane and at least 0.1 mol% oxygen which process comprises the steps:<br>
(a)	contacting said gas mixture with a solution of a metallic salt capable of selectively<br>
chemically absorbing the alkene to produce a chemically absorbed alkene-rich liquid<br>
stream;<br>
(b)	recovering the alkene from the metallic salt solution.<br>
Advantageously, the process of the present invention, avoids the need for costly and energy intensive distillation separation apparatus.<br>
Furthermore, the process of the present invention eliminates or at least mitigates the need for expensive refrigeration equipment.<br>
More advantageously, the process of the present invention allows the safe separation of alkene from alkane in the presence of oxygen.<br>
The process of the present invention is particularly useful for the separation of the alkene from the alkanes where the alkene and alkane being separated contain the same number of carbon atoms.<br>
The process of the present invention is especially useful for separating ethylene from gas mixtures containing ethylene, ethane and oxygen.<br>
In the process of the present invention, the alkane is preferably a C2 to C4 alkane or mixtures thereof such as ethane, propane, butane and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferably, the alkene is a C2 to C4 alkene or mixtures thereof such as ethylene, the propenes, the butenes and mixtures thereof.<br>
The concentration of oxygen present in the gas mixture is at least 0.1 mol%, such as at least 0.2 mol%. Suitably, the concentration of oxygen in the gas mixture is in the range of 0.1 mol% up to a concentration where the gas mixture is below the flammable range. The oxygen concentration in the mixture must be such that the alkane-rich product stream is also non-flammable. It will be known to those skilled in the art that the limit of the flammable range is partly dependent on the pressure and temperature of the mixture. The gas mixtures of the process of the present invention should not enter the flammable range at any stage in the process. The gas separation process may be advantageously operated such that a gas mixture is as close as possible<br>
to the flammable range whilst remaining non-flammable.<br>
Suitably, the concentration of oxygen in the gas mixture is 0.1 to 10 mol%, such as 0.2 to 8 mol%, for example, 0.2 to 6 mol%.<br>
The separation process of present invention is especially applicable to product streams of chemical processes. Thus, the process of the present invention is particularly useful for separating alkenes from a gas mixture of alkenes, alkanes and oxygen produced in the oxidation of a C2 to C4 alkane.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the oxidation of a C2 to C4 alkane to produce the corresponding alkene and carboxylic acid which process comprises the steps<br>
a)      - contacting in an oxidation reaction zone, said alkane, molecular oxygen-containing gas, optionally the corresponding alkene and optionally water, in the . presence of at least one catalyst active for the oxidation of the alkane to the corresponding alkene and carboxylic acid, to produce a first product stream comprising alkene, carboxylic acid, alkane, oxygen and water;<br>
(b)	separating in a first separation means at least a portion of the first product stream into a gaseous stream comprising alkene, alkane and oxygen and a liquid stream comprising carboxylic acid;<br>
(c)	contacting said gaseous stream with a solution of a metallic salt capable of selectively chemically absorbing the alkene to produce a chemically absorbed alkene-rich liquid stream;<br>
(d)	recovering an alkene-rich stream from the metallic salt solution.<br>
The process of the present invention is also particularly useful when the alkene and/or carboxylic acid products of the oxidation process are used at least in part in integrated downstream processes, for example (a) for the production of ester by reacting the carboxylic acid with the alkene or an alcohol or (b) for the production of alkenyl carboxylate by the reaction of an oxygen-containing gas with the carboxylic acid and alkene. Alkene and/or carboxylic acid may be recovered from the product of the oxidation reaction zone and/or additional alkene and/or carboxylic acid may be used in the downstream process.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an integrated process for the production of an alkyl carboxylate which process comprises the steps :<br>
(a)	contacting in an oxidation reaction zone, an alkane, molecular oxygen-containing gas, optionally the corresponding alkene and optionally water, in the presence of at least one catalyst active for the oxidation of the alkane to the corresponding alkene and carboxyhc acid, to produce a first non-flammable product stream comprising alkene, carboxyhc acid, alkane, oxygen and water;<br>
(b)	separating in a first separation means at least a portion of the first product stream into a gaseous stream comprising alkene, alkane and oxygen and a liquid stream comprising carboxyhc acid;<br>
(c)	contacting at least a portion of said gaseous stream with a solution of a metallic salt<br>
capable of selectively chemically absorbing the alkene to produce a chemically<br>
absorbed alkene-rich liquid stream;<br>
(d)	recovering an alkene-rich stream from the metallic salt solution and;<br>
(e)	contacting in a second reaction zone at least a portion of said alkene-rich stream from step (d), and a carboxylic acid, in the presence of at least one catalyst active for the production of alkyl carboxylate to produce said alkyl carboxylate,<br>
Also, in another embodiment, the present invention provides an integrated process for the production of an alkenyl carboxylate which process comprises the steps:<br>
(a)	contacting in an oxidation reaction zone, an alkane, molecular oxygen-containing gas, optionally the corresponding alkene and optionally water, in the presence of at least one catalyst active for the oxidation of the alkane to the corresponding alkene and carboxylic acid, to produce a first non-flammable product stream comprising alkene, carboxylic acid, alkane, oxygen and water;<br>
(b)	separating in a first separation means at least a portion of the first product stream into a gaseous stream comprising alkene, alkane and oxygen and a liquid stream comprising carboxylic acid;<br>
(c)	contacting at least a portion of said gaseous stream with a solution of a metallic salt capable of selectively chemically absorbing the alkene to produce a chemically absorbed alkene-rich liquid stream;<br>
(d)	recovering an alkene-rich stream from the metallic salt solution and;<br>
(e)	contacting in a second reaction zone at least a portion of said alkene-rich stream obtained in step (d), a carboxylic acid and a molecular oxygen-containing gas, in the presence of at least one catalyst active for the production of alkenyl carboxylate to<br>
produce said alkenyl carboxylate.<br>
The separation process of the present invention will now be described in relation to the oxidation of a C2 to C4 alkane to produce a product stream comprising the corresponding aikene, alkane and oxygen and integrated processes thereof.<br>
In the oxidation reaction, the C2 to C4 alkane is preferably ethane, the corresponding alkene being ethylene and the corresponding carboxylic acid being acetic acid. These products may be reacted in downstream processes to produce ethyl acetate or, with a molecular oxygen-containing gas to produce vinyl acetate.<br>
Typically, the oxidation reaction is performed heterogeneously with solid catalysts and the reactants in the fluid phase. In this case, the concentrations of optional aikene and optional water may be controlled as partial pressures in the oxidation reaction zone.<br>
Catalysts active for the oxidation of alkane to aikene and carboxylic acid may comprise any suitable catalysts known in the art, for example, for the oxidation of ethane to ethylene and acetic acid as described in US 4596787, EP-A-0407091, DE 19620542, WO 99/20592, DE 19630832, WO 98/47850, WO 99/51339, EP-A-0 1043064, WO 9913980, US 53006S2 and US 5300684, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>

Solid catalysts active for the oxidation of the C2 to C4 alkane may be supported or unsupported. Examples of suitable supports include silica, diatomaceous earth, montmorillonite, alumina, silica alumina, zirconia, titania, silicon carbide, activated carbon and mixtures thereof.<br>
Solid catalysts active for the oxidation of the C2 to C4 alkane may be used in the form of a fixed or fluidised bed.<br>
The oxidation catalyst would be expected to oxidise at least part of any alkene fed to the oxidation reaction zone, for example to the corresponding carboxylic acid.<br>
The molecular oxygen-containing gas used in the oxidation reaction zone, may be air or a gas richer or poorer in molecular oxygen than air. A suitable gas may be, for example, oxygen diluted with a suitable diluent, for example nitrogen, argon or carbon<br>
dioxide. Preferably, the molecular oxygen-containing gas is oxygen. The molecular-oxygen containing gas may be fed to the oxidation reaction zone as a single feed stream comprising the alkane feed. Such an alkane/molecular-oxygen gas stream may be obtained from the separation of the alkene from alkene/alkane/molecular oxygen gas mixture.<br>
Preferably, at least some of the molecular oxygen-containing gas is fed to the oxidation reaction zone independently from the alkane and optional alkene feeds, and any recycle streams.<br>
Suitably, the concentration of the molecular-oxygen containing gas (as fresh feed and/or recycle) is such that the concentration of oxygen is from greater than 0 and up to and including 20 mol% of the total feed, including recycles, to the oxidation reaction zone, preferably 2-15 mol%.<br>
The alkane and alkene fed into the oxidation reaction zone may be substantially pure or may be admixed, for example, with one or more of nitrogen, argon, methane, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and low levels of other C2 to C4 alkenes/alkanes.<br>
Suitably, the concentration of alkene (as fresh feed and/or recycle component) is from 0 and up to and including 50 mol % of the total feed, including recycles, to the oxidation reaction zone, preferably from 1 to 20 mol %, more preferably from 1 to 15 mol %.<br>
Suitably, the concentration of water (as fresh feed and/or recycle component) is from 0 to 50 mol % inclusive of the total feed, including recycles, to the oxidation reaction zone, preferably from 0 to 25 mol %.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the alkene, such as ethylene, and water are co-fed into the oxidation reaction zone.<br>
Suitably, the alkene, for example, ethylene, and water may be used in a ratio of 1 : 0.1-250 by weight, such as 1 : 0.1-100 or 1 : 0.1- 50 but preferably in a ratio 1 : 0.1-10 by weight.<br>
When solid catalysts are used in the oxidation reaction zone, the alkane, corresponding alkene, molecular-oxygen containing gas, optional water and any recycle gases are preferably passed through the oxidation reaction zone with a residence time corresponding to a combined gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 500-10,000hr-1; the<br>
GHSV being defined as volume (calculated at STP) of gas passing through the reactor divided by the bulk volume of settled catalyst.<br>
The oxidation reaction may suitably be earned out at a temperature in the range from 100 to 400°C, typically in the range 140 to 350°C.<br>
The oxidation reaction may suitably be carried out at atmospheric or superatmospheric pressure, for example, in the range from 5 to 27 barg.<br>
Typically, alkane conversions in the range 1 to 99% may be achieved in the oxidation reaction of the present invention.<br>
Typically, oxygen conversions in the range 30 to 99.99% may be achieved in the oxidation reaction of the present invention.<br>
The concentration of oxygen in the product stream will depend to some extent on the degree of alkane conversion and the degree of selectivity to products. A high alkane conversion will result in a low concentration of oxygen present in the product stream. A high selectivity to product alkene will result in a high concentration of oxygen in the product stream.<br>
The maximum (safe) concentration of oxygen in the product stream is determined by the flammable range of the oxygen to alkane ratio after separation of the alkene therefrom.<br>
Thus, although the concentration of oxygen present in the product stream from the oxidation reaction zone may be less than 0.1 mol% it is typically at least 0.1 mol%, such as at least 0.2 mol%. Suitably, provided the product stream is non-flammable, the concentration of oxygen in the product stream is in the range of 0.1 mol% up to and including 10 mol%, such as 0.2 to 8 mol%, for example, 0.2 to 6 mol%.<br>
In the oxidation reaction, the catalyst suitably has a productivity in the range 10 to 10000 grams of carboxylic acid, such as acetic acid, per hour per kilogram of catalyst.<br>
In the oxidation reaction, the catalyst suitably has a productivity in the range 5 to 5000 grams of alkene, such as ethylene, per hour per kilogram of catalyst.<br>
Carbon monoxide can have an adverse effect on some catalysts used in the production of vinyl acetate. Thus, depending on the nature of the catalyst employed, it is desirable that the first product stream should have a low concentration of carbon monoxide by-product.<br>
Thus, it is also preferred to use a catalyst in the oxidation reaction zone that gives negligible carbon monoxide by-product. An additional catalyst component in the oxidation reaction zone may be used to oxidise carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide. The additional catalyst component may be present in the oxidation catalyst or catalysts or in a secondary reaction zone or may be present as a separate catalyst in the oxidation reaction zone.<br>
When ethane is used as a reactant for the oxidation reaction, the product stream comprises acetic acid, ethylene, unreacted ethane, oxygen and water and may also contain inert gas components such as argon and nitrogen and the by-products, acetaldehyde, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Acetaldehyde and carbon monoxide may be converted by the molecular oxygen-containing gas to produce acetic acid and carbon dioxide respectively, either in downstream processes or, after recycling, in the oxidation reaction zone.<br>
Ethylene is present in the product stream of the oxidation reaction as unconverted reactant ethylene from the feed and/or as oxidation product of the ethane reactant.<br>
The product stream from the oxidation reaction zone is separated in a first separation means into a gaseous stream comprising the alkene, unreacted alkane and oxygen and a liquid stream comprising the carboxylic acid. Any suitable separation means known in the art may be employed such as a membrane separation unit, condensing unit or a distillation unit. Preferably, the separation means employed is a condenser.<br>
Where the product stream from the oxidation reaction comprises acetic acid, ethylene, ethane, oxygen and water, the product stream may be, and is preferably, separated by condensation into an overhead gaseous stream comprising ethylene, ethane and oxygen and a base liquid stream comprising acetic acid and water. In general, the gaseous stream will also comprise carbon oxides such as carbon dioxide.<br>
Optionally, carboxylic acid and/or alkene may be recovered from the product stream of the oxidation reaction.<br>
The gaseous stream from the first separation means is contacted with a solution of a metal salt capable of selectively chemically absorbing the alkene to produce a chemically absorbed alkene-rich liquid stream.<br>
