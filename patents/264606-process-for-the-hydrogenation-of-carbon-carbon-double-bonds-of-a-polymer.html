				<td>ORGANIC SOLVENT-FREE HYDROGENATION OF DIENE-BASED POLYMERS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the hydrogenation of carbon-carbon double bonds in polymers.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has been known that carbon-carbon double bonds in polymers may be successfully hydrogenated by treating the polymer in an organic solution form with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst. Such processes can be selective toward the double bonds which are hydrogenated so that, for example, the double bonds in aromatic or naphthenic groups are not hydrogenated and double or triple bonds between carbon and other atoms such as nitrogen or oxygen are not affected. This field of art contains many examples of catalysts suitable for such hydrogenations, including catalysts based on cobalt, nickel, rhodium, osmium and ruthenium. The suitability of the catalyst depends on the extent of hydrogenation required, the rate of the hydrogenation reaction and the presence or absence of other groups, such as carboxyl and nitrile groups, in the polymers.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,410,657 teaches a method for the selective hydrogenation of the unsaturated double bonds in conjugated diene units of a homopolymer or copolymer in the presence of a homogeneous organotitanium-based catalyst. It demonstrates a high degree of hydrogenation and hydrogenation reproducibility using a catalyst mixture consisting of a substituted or unsubstituted monocyclopentadienyl titanium compound and lithium hydride derived from a reaction of both alkyl lithium and hydrogen in solution.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,020,439 demonstrates a method for hydrogenating living polymers that include mainly conjugated double bond monomers and aromatic vinyl monomers. The polymer made by at least one conjugated diene compound is contacted with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst. The catalyst is formed from a cyclopentadienyl titanium compound. A cocatalyst is provided in the form of alkoxylithium compound. This catalyst system selectively hydrogenates the unsaturated double bonds in the conjugated diene units of the living polymer in solution.<br>
U.S. Patent No.5,705,571 provides a process for selective hydrogenation of a conjugated diene polymer. The process includes bringing the conjugated diene polymer in an inert organic solvent into contact with hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst combination including a substituted or unsubstituted bis(cyclopentadienyl) Group VIII transition metal compound and an organic lithium compound. It claims that the hydrogenation can be carried out in the presence of a small amount of the hydrogenation catalyst combination under mild conditions, and both the hydrogenation conversion and selectivity to conjugated diene units are high.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,057,581 teaches a selective hydrogenation method of the carbon-carbon double bonds of conjugated diene copolymers in homogeneous solution in an organic solvent in the presence of certain divalent ruthenium carbonyl complex catalysts containing phosphine ligands having bulky alkyl substituents.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,454,644 teaches the hydrogenation in solution of unsaturated organic compounds having from 2 to 20 carbon atoms which organic compounds contain at least one moiety selected from keto, formyl, nitrile, nonaromatic carbon double bonds and carbon-carbon triple bonds, by using as the catalyst a metal complex of ruthenium or osmium bonded to two electro negative species selected from hydrogen and halogen and complexed with at least two organic stabilizing ligands such as carbonyl or tertiary phosphine.<br>
Guo and Rempel in Journal of Molecular Catalysis (v 63, n 3, Dec 15, 1990, p 279-298; v 72, n 2, Mar 1, 1992, p 193-208) describe the hydrogenation of poly cis-1,4-polybutadiene and styrene-butadiene copolymer in the presence of RhCI(PPh3)s in solution under mild reaction conditions. Quantitative hydrogenation of carbon-carbon unsaturation can be achieved without any large scale changes in polymer chain length properties.<br>
Mao, and Rempel in Journal of Molecular Catalysis, A: Chemical, (v 135, n 2, Oct 14, 1998, p 121-132) teaches hydrogenation of nitrile-butadiene copolymers catalyzed in monochlorobenzene by a series of cationic rhodium complexes [Rh(diene)(L2)]+ (diene = norbornadiene (NBD) and 1,5-cyclooctadiene (COD); L2 = (PPh3)2, Ph2P(CH2)nPPh2 (n = 2, 3 and 4); Cy2P(CH2)2PCy2).<br>
Charmondusit et al, in Journal of Applied Polymer Science (v 89, n 1, Jul 5, 2003, p 142-152) describes quantitative homogeneous hydrogenation of cis-1,4-<br>
poly-(isoprene) (GRIP) in the presence of OsHCI(CO)(O2)(PCy3)2 as catalyst over the temperature range of 115-140°C in solution.<br>
Parent, McManus, and Rempel in Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research, (v 37, n 11, Nov, 1998, p 4253-4261) describes the selective hydrogenation of olefin within acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymers by homogeneous catalyst precursor, OsHCI(CO)(L)(PCy3)2 (1, L = vacant; 2, L = O2) in solution. Reversible coordination of nitrile to complex 1 not only reduces the hydrogenation rate but creates an unprecedented sensitivity of the process to pressure. Unique to this system is an apparent second-order dependence of the hydrogenation rate on [H2], which diminishes toward zero order as pressures exceed 60 bar.<br>
Parent, McManus, and Rempel, in Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research (v 35, n 12, Dec, 1996, p 4417-4423) describes homogeneous catalyst precursors of the forms RhCI(PPh3)3 and RhH(PPh3)4 for the selective hydrogenation of acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymers in solution. The kinetic results suggest the behavior observed under severe conditions is consistent with that reported for pressures and temperatures near ambient. Dilute solution viscosity data are used to demonstrate the uniform selectivity of both RhCI(PPh3)3 and RhH(PPh3)4 catalyzed hydrogenations.<br>
Pan and Rempel in Macromolecular Rapid Communications (v 25, April, 2004, p 843-847) describe an efficient hydrogenation of butadiene-styrene copolymers in solution using a ruthenium complex.<br>
Gilliom in Macromolecules (v 22, n 2, Feb, 1989, p 662-665; v25, no. 22, Oct., 1992, p6066-6068) discloses bulk hydrogenation of polymers using entrapped catalyst (Rh(PPh3)3CI or [lr(COD)(PMePh2)2]PF6) introduced via organic solution followed by solvent removal. High conversion (90 percent) was obtained at moderate temperatures and pressures, however the reaction rate was very slow.<br>
In summary, the research in this area, namely, the hydrogenation of diene-based polymers, has been very successful if the polymers were dissolved in an organic solvent. However, there is no research on hydrogenation of diene-based polymers without using organic solvents, except Gilliom's research, in which the reaction rate was very slow but it was still necessary to use an organic solvent to introduce the catalyst into the polymer. The present invention is directed to a process<br>
wherein selective bulk hydrogenation of diene-based polymers is performed without the need or use of any organic solvent at any stage, and a high degree of hydrogenation is achieved and the rate of hydrogenation is high.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The process of the present invention includes polymers which contain carbon-carbon double bonds. Polymers having carbon-carbon double bonds useful in the present invention include conjugated diene, homo-polymers or polymers of a conjugated diene and at least one other copolymerizable monomer.<br>

According to the present invention, the conjugated diene forms from about 15 to about 100% by weight of the carbon-carbon double bond containing polymer. If other copolymerizable monomers are used and selected from styrene and alphamethyl styrene, the styrene and/or a methyl styrene monomer preferably forms from about 15 to about 60% by weight of the polymer. If the other copolymerizable monomers are used and selected from acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile, the acrylonitrile and/or methacrylonitrile monomer preferably forms from about 15 to about 50% by weight of the polymer, with the conjugated diolefin forming from about 50 to about 85% by weight of the polymer.<br>

The hydrogenation of the polymer can be undertaken in bulk form, and the use of organic solvent which is conventional in hydrogenation operations is completely eliminated. The polymers to be hydrogenated according to the present invention can be in the form of particles or thin films. There is no restricting requirement for the particle size or the thickness of the films. However, the smaller the particle size or the thinner the film is, the quicker the hydrogenation; and<br>

The hydrogenation process of the present invention can be undertaken in a suitable reactor equipped with temperature regulator and agitator. According to the present invention, the double bond containing polymer can be made into particles which can be realized by any possible way, such as using normal cutting tools (scissors or knifes, etc.) or some special particle making processes (emulsion polymerization, or suspension polymerization, etc.).<br>
According to the present invention the polymer particles can be mixed with the catalyst according to the designated ratio and fed into the reactors and degassed as required. The reactor can be pressurized with hydrogen. The hydrogenation temperature for the process of the present invention can be from about 35 °C to about 250 °C, preferably from about 80 °C to about 160 °C.<br>
During the course of the hydrogenation reaction, hydrogen may be added to the reactor. The reaction time can be from about one quarter of an hour to about twenty four hours, preferably from about one half of an hour to about eight hours. The extent to which the carbon-carbon double bonds in the polymer are hydrogenated, i.e., the degree of hydrogenation, is from about 80 to about 99.5 percent, preferably from about 90 to about 99.5 percent.
