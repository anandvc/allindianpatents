				<td>Description<br>
PHTHALOCYANINE COMPOUND, PROCESS FOR PREPARING THE SAME,<br>
AND OPTICAL RECORDING MEDIUM CONTAINING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a novel<br>
phthalocyanine compound which is useful in the<br>
optoelectronics-related fields such as for optical disk<br>
recording materials, information recording, display<br>
sensors and optical cards; a process for preparing the<br>
same; and an optical recording medium such as an optical<br>
disk which is formed so that it contains the<br>
phthalocyanine compound in its recording layer.<br>
Background Art<br>
With the rapid progress of the information-oriented<br>
society in recent years, optical information recording<br>
media, which enable by far higher density recording than<br>
magnetic recording media, are popularly utilized and<br>
actively studied. As the optical information recording<br>
media, known are a read-only type, in which information<br>
has been recorded beforehand and with which users can<br>
only read information; a write-once type, with which<br>
users can record and read information; and a re-writable<br>
type, with which users can record/read/erase information.<br>
Of these recording media, the write-once type media are<br>
being widely used as media which store bulk data<br>
compactly, because they are generally low-cost and excel<br>
in storage stability.<br>
Of the write-once optical information recording<br>
media, a single-plate type of CD-R (CD-recordable), which<br>
is made up of a recording layer of organic dyes, a<br>
reflecting layer of metal provided on the recording layer<br>
and a protective layer provided on the reflective layer,<br>
and a plate-bonding type of DVD-R (DVD-recordable) are<br>
commonly and widely used.<br>
The CD-R or DVD-R records information in the form of<br>
signals which are generated with changes in the organic<br>
dyes in its recording layer caused by irradiating the<br>
recording layer with laser beams from its substrate side.<br>
Moreover, various types of writers using a high-output<br>
semiconductor laser, as recording devices, and of<br>
software for information recording are commercially<br>
available. In recent years, a great number of CD-R<br>
recording devices which record at high speeds, 32 to 52 X<br>
to the conventional recording speed, have been sold. And<br>
DVD-R recording devices which record at speeds of 4 X or<br>
more have also been on the market. In high-speed<br>
recording, recording is performed in a shorter time than<br>
ordinary writing, but on the other hand, it requires high<br>
power laser irradiation; consequently, the margin<br>
required for the record reading characteristics narrows<br>
down. And problems have been indicated particularly of<br>
deterioration of jitter characteristics, which has not<br>
been tangible at ordinary recording speed, and increase<br>
in loading on a laser.<br>
To overcome these problems, attempts have been made<br>
to form sharp and better-shaped pits in a shorter time<br>
even in high speed recording, from the viewpoints of the<br>
pyrolitic behavior and exothermic behavior of dyes in the<br>
recording layer, by causing pyrolitic behavior of dyes in<br>
the recording layer at a time by laser irradiation and<br>
increasing the speed of weight loss in pyrolysis or by<br>
making the peak of exothermic reaction sharp, as<br>
disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 09-058123,<br>
10-188341 and 11-025504. However, the contents disclosed<br>
in the above documents are to improve the pyrolitic<br>
behavior of dye by using a special metal azo dye or<br>
cyanine dye or adding a quencher to a dye, and they do<br>
not provide sufficient improving effects.<br>
In the meantime, attempts have been made to<br>
introduce a metallocene derivative and/or a ferrocene<br>
derivative into a dye composition in the recording layer<br>
by adding and/or binding the same to the dye composition,<br>
as disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-open<br>
Nos. 7-098887, 8-118800 and 11-70732, WO 97/23354 and WO<br>
00/09522.<br>
It is mentioned in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 7-<br>
098887, 8-118800 and 11-70732 that organometallic<br>
compounds such as metallocene derivatives and/or<br>
ferrocene derivatives are highly effective in improving<br>
the pyrolitic characteristics of dyes and the recording<br>
characteristics of the recording layer. Further,<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 11-70732 discloses in<br>
column 0012 that the effect of adding the above described<br>
organometallic compounds, such as metallocene derivatives<br>
and/or ferrocene derivatives, is clearly different from<br>
that of adding the chelate compounds of transition metals<br>
used as singlet-oxygen quenchers, which are added for<br>
stabilizing the recording layer and improving the light-<br>
fastness of the same.<br>
WO 97/23354 and WO 00/09522 disclose that the<br>
trouble of dye recovery/recycle can be improved by<br>
chemically linking a metallocene derivative and/or a<br>
ferrocene derivative to the side chain of the dye in the<br>
recording layer or to the axial substituent of the<br>
central metal.<br>
The inventors of the present invention have also<br>
confirmed that to make high-speed recording<br>
characteristics better, the best measure is to allow<br>
organometallic compounds, such as metallocene derivatives<br>
and/or ferrocene derivatives, to act on the dye in the<br>
recording layer to improve the pyrolitic behavior of the<br>
dye.<br>
However, it is impossible to fully accomplish higher<br>
sensitivity and better jitter characteristics, which are<br>
required for high-speed recording these days, by mixing<br>
and adding, or just linking organometallic compounds,<br>
such as metallocene derivatives and/or ferrocene<br>
derivatives, to the dye in the recording layer, and such<br>
recording media are not always sufficiently compatible<br>
with read-only CD.<br>
In the meantime, the linking process of metallocene<br>
compounds requires many steps, which gives rise to a<br>
problem of increasing manufacturing cost.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Accordingly, the object of the present invention is<br>
to overcome the above-described problems and provide a<br>
dyestuff for optical information recording media which<br>
enhances the compatibility with CD player even when<br>
recording is performed at high speeds.<br>
After directing tremendous research efforts toward<br>
overcoming the above described problem, the present<br>
inventors have found that not only sufficient recording<br>
sensitivity but effect of decreasing jitter value at<br>
high-speed recording can be obtained by bonding<br>
organometallic compounds, such as metallocene derivatives<br>
and/or ferrocene derivatives, to phthalocyanine-compounds<br>
via a linking group shown below. The inventors have also<br>

directly reacting the compound having an N-CHO group with<br>
the halogenating agent or by mixing the compound and the<br>
agent in a solvent, or the Vilsmeier complex may be<br>
formed in the solvent solution of the above<br>
phthalocyanine compound (III) by introducing them<br>
separately into the system.<br>
Concrete examples of compounds having an N-CHO group<br>
include N,N-dimethylformamide, N-methylformanilide and<br>
N,N-diisopropylformamide, and preferred are N,N-<br>

ratio of the amounts of the compound having N-CHO and the<br>
halogenating agent used to the above phthalocyanine<br>
compound are 1 to 100 and 1 to 30, and preferably 1 to 50<br>
and 1 to 15, respectively.<br>
In the reaction of the phthalocyanine compound with<br>
the Vilsmeier complex, a compound having N-CHO may be<br>
used as a solvent.<br>
In the preparation of a Vilsmeier complex and the<br>
synthesis of an immonium salt, the reaction temperature<br>
is -50 to 80°C and preferably -10 to 50°C.<br>
When the Vilsmeier complex is prepared beforehand,<br>
the reaction time for the preparation is 5 minutes to 10<br>
hours and preferably 30 minutes to 3 hours, and in the<br>
subsequent immonium salt synthesis, the reaction time is<br>
preferably 1 to 96 hours and more preferably 3 to 36<br>
hours. When the Vilsmeier complex is prepared in situ,<br>
the reaction time is also preferably 1 to 96 hours and<br>
more preferably 3 to 36 hours.<br>
Concrete examples of basic compounds having the<br>
general formula (IV) which are added after the synthesis<br>
of immonium salt include: ammonia, alkylamines and<br>
arylamines, and preferred are ammonia; alkylamines such<br>
as methylamine, ethylamine and butylamine; and arylamines<br>
such as aniline and 2-methylaniline, and more preferred<br>
is ammonia.<br>
Preferably the basic compound is added excessively<br>
to such an extent that the immonium salt, as the reaction<br>
product of the Vilsmeier complex and the phthalocyanine<br>
compound, excess Vilsmeier complex and the halogenating<br>
agent disappear, and the amount, on a mole base, is<br>
preferably 1 to 100 fold the amount of the halogenating<br>
agent used and more preferably 2 to 30 fold.<br>
The basic compound may be added at a time, but<br>
preferable it is added gradually while cooling the<br>
mixture, because its addition involves neutralization<br>
reaction as an exothermic reaction. When the basic<br>
compound is a liquid, preferably it is added dropwise,<br>
whereas when the basic compound is a gas, preferably it<br>
is added using an introduction tube while bubbling the<br>
mixture.<br>
The reaction temperature is -50 to 80°C and<br>
preferably -10 to 50°C.<br>
The reaction time is 30 minutes to 30 hours and<br>
preferably 1 to 6 hours, though it depends on the time<br>
the addition of the basic compound takes.<br>
Preferably the compound having the general formula<br>
(V) which includes a metal compound residue is added to<br>
such an extent that an imine compound synthesized by the<br>
addition of the above basic compound fully reacts, and<br>
the amount, on a mole base, is preferably 1 to 30 fold<br>
the amount of the phthalocyanine compound and more<br>
preferably 1 to 10 fold. The compound may be added at a<br>
time or in divided portions.<br>

temperature of the solvent and preferably 20°C to the<br>
reflux temperature of the solvent.<br>
The reaction time is preferably 30 minutes to 72<br>
hours and more preferably 2 to 24 hours.<br>
Before the addition of the compound having the<br>
general formula (V), an inorganic salt by-produced when<br>
adding the basic compound (IV) may be filtered out.<br>
Then after-treatment, such as distilling off the<br>
solvent or/and discharging the reaction liquid in a poor<br>
solvent to the phthalocyanine compound to filter out the<br>
precipitate, is done after the reaction to obtain the<br>
phthalocyanine compound/mixture of the present invention.<br>
If the resultant phthalocyanine compound/mixture is<br>
purified by recrystallization or by column<br>
chromatography, a phthalocyanine compound of high purity<br>
can be obtained.<br>
The phthalocyanine compound of high purity thus<br>
obtained can be used in combination with other<br>
phthalocyanine compounds/mixtures and the phthalocyanine<br>
compounds/mixtures with the phthalocyanine compound of<br>
high purity added thereto can be used in the form of a<br>
mixture thereof.<br>
Concrete examples of preferred phthalocyanine<br>
compounds/mixtures, which have the general formula (I),<br>
of the present invention will be shown in Table-1 to<br>
Table-4 below; however, it is to be understood that these<br>
examples are not intended to limit the present invention.<br>
Table-1 Phthalocyanine Compounds (A)<br>
[Optical Information Recording Media]<br>
The optical information recording media of the<br>
present invention is made up of: a transparent substrate<br>
in which a pre-groove (a guide groove) is formed as<br>
needed; a recording layer provided on the substrate for<br>
absorbing laser beams to form pits therein; a reflecting<br>
layer provided on the recording layer for increasing the<br>
reflectance of the recording layer; and a protective<br>
layer provided on the reflecting layer for protecting the<br>
recording layer and the reflective layer. The protective<br>
layer may be used as an adhesion layer to provide an<br>
optical information recording media having a 2-layer<br>
bonding structure.<br>
For the above substrate, any materials can be used<br>
as long as they substantially transmit semiconductor<br>
laser beams and are being used in ordinary optical<br>
recording media. For example, macromolecular materials<br>
such as polycarbonate resin, acrylic resin, polystyrene<br>
resin, vinyl chloride resin, epoxy resin, polyester resin<br>
and amorphous polyolefin resin, or inorganic materials<br>
such as glass can be used. Depending on the situation,<br>
polycarbonate resin etc. is formed into a substrate with<br>
a pre-groove formed therein by injection molding or 2P<br>
method. The substrate may take the form of a plate,<br>
film, disk or card. The substrate may have a guide<br>
groove for showing the position of recording, a pit for<br>
showing the position of recording or a pit for partly<br>
read only information on its substrate.<br>
The recording layer of the present invention<br>
contains the phthalocyanine compounds/mixtures of the<br>
present invention whose ?max is around 650 nm to 900 nm.<br>
Generally, organic dyes are characterized by large<br>
change in refractive index n and extinction coefficient k<br>
with wavelength ?. If the refractive index n at a laser<br>
wavelength is smaller than 1.8, reflectance and signal<br>
modulation ratio required for signal reading cannot be<br>
obtained, and when k is more than 0.40, reflectance is<br>
lowered, whereby satisfactory read signals cannot be<br>
obtained, and moreover, signals are susceptible to change<br>
due to the read light; thus, dyes having such refractive<br>
index n and extinction coefficient k are not suitable for<br>
practical applications. Media with high reflectance and<br>
sensitivity can be produced by, taking into consideration<br>
the above described characteristics of dyes, selecting<br>
organic dyes which have preferable optical constants at<br>
intended laser light wavelengths and forming a recording<br>
layer using the same.<br>
The phthalocyanine compounds/mixtures of the present<br>
invention, which are used in the present invention, are<br>
very useful compounds that meet the above described<br>
optical constants required for a recording layer to have<br>
at the above described laser wavelengths (n is 1.8 or<br>
more and k is in the range of 0.04 to 0.40, preferably n<br>
is 2.0 or more and k is in the range of 0.04 to 0.20),<br>
since they each have a high optical absorption<br>
coefficient and their absorption wavelength region can be<br>
arbitrarily selected by selecting their central metal or<br>
substituents.<br>
The content of the phthalocyanine compounds/mixtures<br>
of the present invention in the recording layer is 30% or<br>
more and preferably 60% or more. That the content is<br>
substantially 100% is also preferable.<br>
The recording layer of the optical information<br>
recording media of the present invention can be formed by<br>
the method such as spin coat, evaporation or sputtering;<br>
however, from the viewpoints of easiness of film forming<br>
and of controlling the pigment layer thickness at the<br>
groove portion and land portion, the spin coat method is<br>
preferable.<br>
When adopting a coating method such as spin coat<br>
method, a coating fluid is used in which the<br>
phthalocyanine compound/mixture of the present invention<br>
is dissolved or dispersed so that its content in the<br>
fluid is 1 to 40% by weight and preferably 3 to 30% by<br>
weight. In this case, a solvent is used which will not<br>
damage the substrate of the medium. Such solvents<br>
include: non-polar solvents, for example, aliphatic or<br>
alicyclic hydrocarbons such as hexane, heptane, octane,<br>
decane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, ethylcyclohexane,<br>
dimethylcyclohexane, isopropylcyclohexane, cycloheptane<br>
and cyclooctane; and ethereal solvents such as diethyl<br>
ether, dibutyl ether, diisobutyl ether, diisopropyl ether<br>
and dipentyl ether; and alcoholic polar solvents such as<br>
methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, 3-<br>
hydroxy-3-methyl-2-butanone, diacetone alcohol, fluorine<br>
alcohol, allyl alcohol and methyl cellosolve. These<br>
solvents may be used alone, or two or more kinds in<br>
combination.<br>
When adding a second solvent, solvents such as<br>
benzene, toluene, xylene, styrene, ethyl benzene, butyl<br>
benzene, cumene, trimethyl benzene, triethyl benzene,<br>
tetralin, p-cymene, methyl isobutyl ketone and diisobutyl<br>
ketone are preferably used, because they have a<br>
satisfactory leveling function to the substrate groove.<br>
The mixing ratio of the second solvent to the coating<br>
fluid is preferably in the range of 0.1 to 20% by volume.<br>
The mixing ratios in this range are optimal ones which<br>
provide a sufficient compatibility for pigments and mixed<br>
solvents, do not damage the substrate, and provide an<br>
excellent shape of the pigment film to the substrate<br>
groove.<br>
When a solvent that does not damage the substrate<br>
cannot be selected, a method such as sputtering, chemical<br>
evaporation or vacuum evaporation can be effectively<br>
used.<br>
Preferably, the film thickness of the recording<br>
layer is, not limited to, 30 nm to 300 nm. If the film<br>
thickness is less than 30 nm, distortion is caused in the<br>
recording signals, and besides, the signal amplitude<br>
decreases. If the film thickness is more than 300 nm,<br>
the sensitivity is lowered, the high-speed recording<br>
characteristics deteriorate, and the read signal<br>
characteristics also deteriorate.<br>
When coating is carried out using the above<br>
described mixed solvents in the present invention, it is<br>
preferable to use a substrate whose groove is 150 nm or<br>
more deep and 650 nm or more wide.<br>
A drying step may be provided after the formation of<br>
the recording layer, depending on the situation. In<br>
terms of the productivity of media and the stability of<br>
the recording signal characteristics of media, the drying<br>
temperature is preferably 20°C or more and 100°C or less.<br>
The drying method can be selected from among air-drying,<br>
hot-air drying and drying by far infrared irradiation and<br>
the drying time is usually about 10 seconds to 2 hours.<br>
The drying may be carried out at atmospheric pressure or<br>
under reduced pressure.<br>
A reflecting layer is provided on the recording<br>
layer of the optical information recording media in<br>
accordance with the present invention. The reflecting<br>
layer may be a film which has, for example, heat<br>
insulating and light enhancing functions in addition to<br>
the reflecting function, in such a case, the reflecting<br>
layer may have a multi-layer structure made up of two or<br>
more layers. Concrete examples of such reflecting layers<br>
are those of aluminum, gold, silver, copper, platinum,<br>
nickel and the alloys in which each said metals are at<br>
least one component. The thickness of the reflecting<br>
layer is usually 20 to 200 nm. An inorganic film of, for<br>
example, aluminum oxide, silicon oxide, silicon nitride,<br>
aluminum nitride, boron nitride, magnesium fluoride or<br>
silicon carbide may be provided as a second layer which<br>
performs heat insulating and light enhancing functions.<br>
Methods of forming a reflecting layer include, for<br>
example, sputtering, ion plating, chemical evaporation<br>
and vacuum evaporation.<br>
A protective layer is provided on the reflecting<br>
layer of the optical information recording medium in<br>
accordance with the present invention. The protective<br>
layer is not limited to any specific one as long as it<br>
can protect the recording layer and the reflecting layer.<br>
Macromolecular materials such as polycarbonate, acryl,<br>
polystyrene, vinyl chloride, epoxy and polyester or<br>
inorganic materials such as SiO2, Al2O3 and AlN can be<br>
used for the protective layer. Of the above materials,<br>
ultraviolet curing acrylic resins are preferable because<br>
the use of them makes it easy to form a protective layer.<br>
Concrete examples of ultraviolet cured acrylic resins<br>
include urethane acrylate, epoxy acrylate and polyester<br>
acrylate. These may be alone or in combination. The<br>
protective layer may be a multi-layer of two or more<br>
layers laminated. Methods of forming a protective layer<br>
include, for example, coating methods such as spin coat<br>
and cast, sputtering and chemical evaporation, similar to<br>
those for the recording layer. Of these methods, spin<br>
coat method is preferable.<br>
The thickness of the protective layer is usually in<br>
the range of 0.1 µm to 100 µm; however, in the present<br>
invention the thickness is preferably 3 µm to 30 µm.<br>
A label etc. can be printed on the protective layer.<br>
Further, means may be used of bonding a protective sheet<br>
or a substrate to the surface of the reflecting layer or<br>
bonding two optical recording media to each other with<br>
their inside facing each other. And a thin film of<br>
ultraviolet curing resin or inorganic material may be<br>
formed on the mirror surface of the substrate to protect<br>
the surface or prevent dust etc. from sticking on the<br>
same.<br>
The optical information recording medium of the<br>
present invention records and reads signals generated<br>
when it is exposed to laser beams. In such record and<br>
read, semiconductor laser whose oscillation wavelength is<br>
in the range of 770 to 830 nm is used for CD-R. When<br>
taking into consideration the compatibility with CD<br>
players, it is usual to read with a semiconductor laser<br>
whose oscillation wavelength is in the range of 770 to<br>
830 nm. However, the phthalocyanine dyes of the present<br>
invention have their absorption at 300 to 450 nm as well,<br>
and thus recording at high speeds and in a short time is<br>
possible outside the range of 770 to 830 nm, even with a<br>
blue semiconductor laser whose oscillation wavelength is<br>
in the range of 400 to 600 nm<br>
Since the object of the present invention is to<br>
improve the sensitivity of optical information recording<br>
medium and reduce the jitter value of the same at high-<br>
speed recording, it is important to measure the<br>
sensitivity and the jitter value.<br>
Thus, the inventors focused their attention on the<br>
recording laser power (sensitivity) and the jitter value<br>
around BETA =0% (BETA is an index of recording laser<br>
power, defined in Orange Book Standard) and evaluated the<br>
same.<br>
In the following the present invention will be<br>
described in detail giving several examples; however, it<br>
is to be understood that these examples are not intended<br>
to limit the present invention.<br>

(IWATANI INDUSTRIAL GASES CORP.). This coating fluid was<br>
spin coated on an injection-molded polycarbonate<br>
substrate (outside diameter: 120 mm, thickness: 1.2 mm)<br>
with a spiral groove (pitch: 1.6 µm, groove width: 0.7µm,<br>
groove depth 180 nm) to form a recording layer so that<br>
Abs (absorbance of the recording layer) = 0.50. Then,<br>

in the pigments. After that, Ag was sputtered on the<br>
recording layer with sputtering apparatus (CDI-900)<br>
manufactured by Balzers so that the thickness of Ag film<br>
was about 70 nm to form a reflecting layer. An<br>
ultraviolet curing resin "SD-1700" (Dainippon Ink and<br>
Chemicals, Inc.) was then spin coated on the reflecting<br>
layer and the coating was exposed to ultra violet rays<br>
for curing to form a protective layer 6 µm. thick.<br>

brominated-monoformylphthalocyanine compound. Then the<br>
compound was esterified using ferrocene carbonyl chloride<br>
to synthesize a phthalocyanine pigment having the<br>
following structural formula (Comp-1) which is described<br>
in WO 00/09522.<br>
