SPECIFICATION<br>
PROCESS FOR PREPARING OPTICALLY ACTIVE (S OR R)-α-AMINO<br>
ACID AND OPTICALLY ACTIVE (R OR S)-α-AMINO ACID ESTER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a process for<br>
simultaneously preparing an optically active (S or R)-α-<br>
amino acid and its antipode ester, an optically active (R<br>
or S) -α-amino acid ester, from an α-amino acid ester<br>
(racemic mixture). These optically active α-amino acid and<br>
an ester thereof are useful compounds as a starting materi-<br>
al or a synthetic intermediate of a natural substance<br>
having physiological activity or a medicine (for example,<br>
see Non-Patent Literature 1, and Patent Literatures 1 to<br>
5) .<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
Heretofore, as a process for preparing an optically<br>
active α-amino acid and an ester thereof by an enantio-<br>
selective hydrolysis reaction using a lipase, there has<br>
been disclosed a method in which, for example, only one of<br>
enantiomers of various kinds of amino acid esters is<br>
selectively hydrolyzed in water in the presence of a<br>
porcine pancreatic lipase, a lipase originated from<br>
Burkholderia cepacia (Pseudomonas cepacia), or a lipase<br>
originated from Rhizopus to obtain an optically active (S)-<br>
amino acid and an optically active (R)-amino acid ester<br>
(for example, see Non-Patent Literature 2).<br>
[0003]<br>
However, according to this method, a large amount of<br>
an enzyme has been used, and there are problems that an E<br>
value which is an index of selectivity between enantiomers<br>
is generally low. When an optically active carboxylic acid<br><br>
2<br>
which is a product is water-soluble, it is difficult to<br>
recover 10 0% of the product from the aqueous solution after<br>
completion of the reaction, and yet, in the presence of a<br>
large amount of water, lowering in optical purity occurs<br>
due to self-hydrolysis reaction of the substrate. Inci-<br>
dentally, the E value has widely been utilized as an index<br>
of selectivity of kinetic optical resolution (for example,<br>
see Non-Patent Literature 3.).<br>
[0004]<br>
Also, as a conventional process for preparing an<br>
optically activeα-amino acid and an ester thereof by an<br>
enantio-selective hydrolysis reaction using a protease,<br>
there is disclosed, for example, a method in which one of<br>
the enantiomers of tyrosine ethyl ester is selectively<br>
hydrolyzed in acetonitrile in the presence of α-chymo-<br>
trypsin, subtilisin Carlsberg and subtilisin BPN' to obtain<br>
an optically active (S)-tyrosine and an optically active<br>
(R)-tyrosine ethyl ester (for example, see Non-Patent<br>
Literature 4). Here, various reactions were carried out by<br>
changing a content of water in acetonitrile, and the most<br>
preferable results can be obtained in an amount of 5 to 10%<br>
based on acetonitrile which is a solvent.<br>
[0005]<br>
However, no hydrolysis is carried out therein with a<br>
system in which a water content is extremely little as 10<br>
equivalent or less based on an amount of the substrate. In<br>
the system used in this case, it is difficult to completely<br>
inhibit self-hydrolysis of the amino acid ester, and a<br>
substrate concentration based on the solvent is low so that<br>
it is not an industrially preferred method.<br>
[0006]<br>
Also, as a conventional process for preparing an<br>
optically activeα-amino acid and an ester thereof by an<br>
enantio-selective hydrolysis reaction using a protease,<br>
there is disclosed, for example, a method in which one of<br>
the enantiomers of tyrosine ethyl ester is selectively<br><br>
3<br>
hydrolyzed in an acetonitrile-water mixed solvent in the<br>
presence ofα-chymotrypsin, subtilisin Carlsberg and<br>
subtilisin BPN' to obtain an optically active (S)-tyrosine<br>
and an optically active (R)-tyrosine ethyl ester (for<br>
example, see Non-Patent Literature 4). Here, various<br>
reactions were carried out by changing a water content in<br>
acetonitrile, and the most preferred results can be<br>
obtained in an amount of 5 to 10% (v/v) of water based on<br>
acetonitrile which is a solvent.<br>
[0007]<br>
However, in the above-mentioned reaction systems, no<br>
hydrolysis is carried out with a system in which a water<br>
content is extremely little as 10 equivalent or less based<br>
on an amount of the substrate, nor referred to at all. In<br>
the system used in this case, an amount of water used as a<br>
substrate is still large, it is difficult to completely<br>
inhibit self-hydrolysis of the amino acid ester, and a<br>
substrate concentration based on the solvent is low so that<br>
it is not an industrially preferred method.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br><br>
4<br>
[0008]<br>
An object of the present invention is to solve the<br>
above-mentioned problems, and to provide a process for<br>
preparing an optically active (S or R)-α-amino acid and its<br>
antipode ester, an optically active (R or S)-α-amino acid<br>
ester, simultaneously from anα-amino acid ester (racemic<br>
mixture) according to hydrolysis using an enzyme with a<br>
simple and easy method, and a high E value.<br>
MEANS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS<br>
[0009]<br>
Heretofore, a preparation of an optically activeα-<br>
amino acid by enantio-selective hydrolysis of anα-amino<br>
acid ester (racemic mixture) is generally carried out by a<br>
method in which, a large amount of water and a racemic p-<br>
amino acid ester are reacted in a solvent mainly comprising<br>
water in the presence of a hydrolase. This is because, in<br>
hydrolysis of a racemicα-amino acid ester which is a<br>
substrate, it has been considered that a larger amount of<br>
water proceeds the reaction. The present inventors have<br>
earnestly studied to solve the problems as previously<br>
mentioned, and as a result, they have found out a novel<br>
reaction system, which can substantially and completely<br>
inhibit self-hydrolysis of a substrate (p-amino acid ester)<br>
which is easily hydrolyzed by water, which causes lowering<br>
in an optical purity, and can completely recover the<br>
optically activeα-amino acid which is generally considered<br>
to be difficult to obtain solely due to its water-solu-<br>
bility, which is improved in yield, selectivity, operat-<br>
ability, etc. as compared with the conventional techniques,<br>
and which is more advantageous as an industrial preparation<br>
method, which can be accomplished by reacting water and anα-amino acid ester (racemic mixture) in an organic solvent<br>
in the presence of a lipase or a protease.<br>
[0010]<br>
The present invention relates to a process for<br><br>

aralkyl group, a heteroarylalkyl group, an aryl<br>
group or a heteroaryl group, each of which may have<br>
a substituent(s), and * represents an asymmetric<br>
carbon atom,<br>
and an optically active (R or S)-α-amino acid ester repre-<br>
sented by the formula (III):<br>

represents an alkyl group which may have a substi-<br>
tuent (s), and * represents an asymmetric carbon<br>
atom, provided that it has an opposite absolute con-<br>
figuration to that of the compound of the formula<br>
(ID,<br>
which comprises selectively reacting water with one of<br>
enantiomers of anα-amino acid ester which is a racemic<br>
mixture and represented by the formula (I):<br><br>
wherein R and R1 have the same meanings as defined<br>
above,<br><br>
6<br>
in the presence of a lipase or a protease in an organic<br>
solvent.<br>
[0011]<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for<br>
preparing an acid salt of an optically active (R or S) -ex-<br>
am i no acid ester, which comprises separating each of the<br>
optically active (S or R) -ot-amino acid represented by the<br>
above-mentioned formula (II):<br><br>
wherein R has the same meaning as defined above, and *<br>
represents an asymmetric carbon atom,<br>
and the optically active (R or S)-α-amino acid ester repre-<br>
sented by the above-mentioned formula (III):<br><br>
wherein R and R1 have the same meanings as defined<br>
above, and * represents an asymmetric carbon atom,<br>
provided that it has an opposite absolute<br>
configuration to that of the compound of the formula<br>
(ID,<br>
formed by the above-mentioned reaction from a mixture<br>
thereof, and reacting the resulting optically active (R or<br>
S)-α-amino acid ester with an acid.<br>

invention is preferably a lipase derived from microorg-<br>
anisms which can be isolatable from an yeast or bacteria,<br>
more preferably a lipase originated from Burkholderia<br>
cepacia (Pseudomonas cepacia) (for example, AMANO PS<br>
(available from AMANO ENZYME CO.), etc.) can be used.<br>
Also, a protease to be used in the reaction of the present<br>
invention may be used, for example, a protease originated<br>
from pancreas of a vertebrate, Aspergillus Olyzae,<br>
Aspergillus Melleus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus<br>
stearothermophilus, etc.<br>
Incidentally, the lipase or protease may be used a<br>
commercially available product as such in a natural form or<br>
as an immobilized enzyme, and it may be used alone or in<br>
admixture of two or more kinds. Also, it may be used by<br>
previously removing an enzyme-immobilizing agent contained<br>
in the commercially available product.<br>
[0045]<br>
The above-mentioned lipase or protease may be used<br>
after subjecting a commercially available product in a<br>
natural form or an immobilized enzyme to chemical treatment<br>
or physical treatment.<br>
[0046]<br><br>
25<br>
As the above-mentioned chemical treatment or<br>
physical treatment method, there may be specifically men-<br>
tioned, for example, a method in which a lipase or protease<br>
is dissolved in a buffer (an organic solvent may exist<br>
therein depending on necessity), and freeze-dried as such<br>
or after stirring, etc. Incidentally, freeze-drying means<br>
a method in which an aqueous solution or a substance con-<br>
taining a water component is rapidly frozen at a tempera-<br>
ture of a freezing point or lower, and water is removed<br>
according to sublimation by reducing a pressure to a water<br>
vapor pressure of the frozen product or lower to dry the<br>
substance (for example, see Non-Patent Literature 3).<br>
Incidentally, according to the treatment, catalyst activity<br>
(reactivity or selectivity, etc.) can be improved.<br>
[0047]<br>
The above-mentioned buffer may be mentioned, for<br>
example, an aqueous solution of an inorganic acid salt such<br>
as an aqueous sodium phosphate solution, an aqueous potas-<br>
sium phosphate solution, etc.; an aqueous solution of an<br>
organic acid salt such as an aqueous sodium acetate<br>
solution, an aqueous ammonium acetate solution, an aqueous<br>
sodium citrate solution, etc., preferably an aqueous sodium<br>
phosphate solution, an aqueous potassium phosphate solution<br>
or an aqueous ammonium acetate solution is used. Incident-<br>
ally, these buffers may be used singly or in admixture of<br>
two or more kinds.<br>
[0048]<br>
A concentration of the above-mentioned buffer is<br>
preferably 0.01 to 2 mol/L, more preferably 0.05 to 0.5<br>
mol/L, and a pH of the buffer is preferably 4 to 9, more<br>
preferably 7 to 8.5.<br>
[0049]<br>
An amount of the buffer to be used at the time of<br>
freeze-drying is not particularly limited so long as it is<br>
a concentration that the lipase or protease is completely<br>
dissolved, and it is preferably 10 ml to 1000 ml, more<br><br>
26<br>
preferably 10 ml to 100 ml based on 1 g of the lipase or<br>
protease.<br>
[0050]<br>
An amount of the above-mentioned lipase or protease<br>
to be used is preferably 0.1 to 1000 mg, more preferably 1<br>
to 200 mg based on 1 g of Compound (I).<br>
[0051]<br>
The reaction of the present invention can be carried<br>
out in the presence of a lipase or a protease in an organic<br>
solvent. During the reaction of the present invention, the<br>
lipase or protease pertains to the reaction by presenting<br>
substantially in a suspended state in the reaction mixture,<br>
and it may be dissolved therein without any problem.<br>
Incidentally, the terms "in an organic solvent" in the<br>
present invention mean the state in which a reaction<br>
solvent to be used in hydrolysis is an organic solvent, and<br>
a liquid portion dissolved in the organic solvent, except<br>
for a lipase or protease (which may sometimes include an<br>
immobilizing agent) and a product precipitated as crystals,<br>
etc., does not cause phase separation from the reaction<br>
system (that is, a state in which water (it may contain an<br>
inorganic salt or organic salt mentioned hereinbelow), a<br>
substrate and an organic solvent comprises a single phase).<br>
[0052]<br>
As water to be used in the reaction of the present<br>
invention, purified water such as deionized water, distil-<br>
led water, etc. is generally used, and the water may con-<br>
tain an inorganic salt such as sodium phosphate, potassium<br>
phosphate, etc., or an organic salt such as sodium acetate,<br>

mol/L based on the amount of water. Incidentally, the<br>

27<br>
[0053]<br>
An amount of the above-mentioned water is an amount<br>
equal to or less than the solubility (an amount capable of<br>
dissolving) of water in an organic solvent to be used (if<br>
the amount exceeds the solubility, phase separation of the<br>
liquid portion occurs), and an upper limit thereof may<br>
somewhat vary depending on the kind of Compound (I), and<br>
preferably 0.5 to 10 mol, more preferably 0.5 to 5.0 mol,<br>
further preferably 1.0 to 3.0 mol, particularly preferably<br>
1.5 to 2.5 mol based on 1 mol of Compound (I). Incidental-<br>
ly, whereas it may vary deepening on the kind of Compound<br>
(I), when an amount of the water to be used exceeds 10 mol<br>
based on 1 mol of Compound (I), undesirable states occurs,<br>
for example, self-hydrolysis of Compound (I) which lowers<br>
an optical purity, elongation of the reaction time due to<br>
suspended state in which a slight amount of water does not<br>
dissolve in an organic solvent (a state in which phase<br>
separation occurs at the liquid portion), etc., so that the<br>
amount of the water to be used is preferably adjusted to an<br>
amount of the solubility of water in an organic solvent or<br>
less, preferably 10 mol or less.<br>
[0054]<br>
As the above-mentioned organic solvent, there may be<br>
mentioned, for example, an aliphatic hydrocarbon such as n-<br>
pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, cyclopentane,<br>
cyclohexane and cyclopentane, etc.; an aromatic hydrocarbon<br>
such as benzene, toluene and xylene, etc.; an ether such as<br>
diethyl ether, t-butyl methyl ether, diisopropyl ether,<br>

etc.; a ketone such as acetone and methyl ethyl ketone,<br>
etc., preferably n-hexane, n-heptane, cyclopentane, cyclo-<br>
hexane, toluene, diisopropyl ether, t-butyl methyl ether,<br>
cyclopentyl methyl ether and tetrahydrofuran, more prefer-<br>
ably n-hexane, cyclohexane, toluene, diisopropyl ether, t-<br>
butyl methyl ether and cyclopentyl methyl ether, particu-<br>
larly preferably cyclohexane, toluene and/or t-butyl methyl<br><br>
28<br>
ether is/are used. Incidentally, these organic solvents<br>
may be used singly or in admixture of two or more kinds.<br>
[0055]<br>
An amount of the above-mentioned organic solvent to<br>
be used is preferably 2 to 200 mL, more preferably 5 to 80<br>
mL based on 1 g of Compound (I) . A ratio of the above-<br>
mentioned water and the organic solvent is not particularly<br>
limited, and an amount of water to be used may be an amount<br>
of the solubility of water in an organic solvent or less<br>
(that is, an amount which saturates in an organic solvent<br>
or less).<br>
[0056]<br>
The reaction of the present invention is desirably<br>
carried out in the presence of a surfactant. As the sur-<br>
factant to be used, there may be mentioned, for example, a<br>
nonionic surfactant such as polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl-<br>
pyrrolidone, polyethylene lauryl ether, polyethylene cetyl<br>
ether, polyoxyethylene octylphenyl ether, etc.; an ampho-<br>
teric surfactant such as 3-[(3-chloroamidopropyl)-dimethyl-<br>
ammonio]-2-hydroxy-l-propanesulfonate, 3-[(3-chloroamido-<br>
propyl) -dimethylammonio] -1-propanesulfonate, etc.; an<br>
anionic surfactant such as sodium dioctylsulfosuccinate,<br>
sodium dodecylsulfonate, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-<br>
dodecyl sulfate, etc.; a cationic surfactant such as cetyl<br>
trimethyl ammonium bromide or cetyl dimethylethyl ammonium<br>
bromide, etc., preferably a nonionic surfactant, more<br>
preferably polyethylene glycol, polyethylene cetyl ether,<br>
polyoxyethylene octylphenyl ether, particularly preferably<br>
polyoxyethylene octylphenyl ether is used. Incidentally,<br>
these surfactants may be used singly or in admixture of two<br>
or more kinds.<br>
[0057]<br>
An amount of the above-mentioned surfactant to be<br>
used is preferably 10 to 1000 mg, more preferably 50 to 200<br>
mg based on 1 g of Compound (I).<br>
[0058]<br><br>
29<br>
The reaction of the present invention can be carried<br>
out by the method, for example, in which Compound (I), a<br>
lipase or a protease, water (if necessary, it may contain<br>
an inorganic salt or an organic salt) and an organic sol-<br>
vent are mixed and reacted with stirring, etc. A reaction<br>
temperature at that time is preferably 0 to 8 0°C, more<br>
preferably 10 to 50°C, particularly preferably 30 to 45°C,<br>
and a reaction pressure is not particularly limited.<br>
Incidentally, during the reaction, lipase or protease is<br>
substantially in a suspended state, and depending on a kind<br>
of Compound (I), Compound (I) is precipitated as a white<br>
solid in some cases with the progress of the reaction, but<br>
these suspension or precipitation does not cause any effect<br>
on the reaction.<br>
[0059]<br>
With regard to Compound (II) and Compound (III)<br>
obtained by the reaction of the present invention, when<br>
Compound (II) is precipitated after completion of the<br>
reaction, then, Compound (II) can be obtained, for example,<br>
by adding a suitable organic solvent (for example, aceto-<br>
nitrile, acetone, etc.) to the reaction mixture and<br>
filtered, and Compound (III) can be obtained by concentrat-<br>
ing the organic layer. Also, when Compound (II) is not<br>
precipitated after completion of the reaction, Compound<br>
(II) can be obtained, for example, by adjusting a pH of the<br>
mixture, extracting Compound (II) with water, further<br>
adjusting a pH of the extract again and extracting with an<br>
organic solvent, and concentrating the obtained organic<br>
layer. Compound (III) can be obtained by concentrating the<br>
organic layer which has been separated at the time of<br>
extracting Compound (II) with water. Incidentally, the<br>
obtained Compound (II) and Compound (III) may be further<br>
purified by the conventionally known method such as<br>
crystallization, recrystallization, distillation, column<br>
chromatography, etc.<br>

temperature at that time is preferably -20 to 80°C, more<br>
preferably -10 to 50°C, particularly preferably -5 to 40°C,<br>
and a reaction pressure is not particularly limited.<br>
