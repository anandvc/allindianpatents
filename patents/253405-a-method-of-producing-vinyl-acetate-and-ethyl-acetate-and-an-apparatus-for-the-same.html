				<td>CO-PRODUCTION OF VINYL ACETATE AND ETHYL ACETATE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention is directed to a co-production process and apparatus for<br><br>
concurrently producing vinyl acetate and ethyl acetate. The process reduces overall capital costs<br>
and allows for higher azeotrope column throughputs. Vinyl acetate in an ethyl acetate-enriched<br>
sidestream from a vinyl acetate azeotrope column is hydrogenated to ethyl acetate.	<br>
Background<br>
The production of vinyl acetate is well known. The preferred method is by way of<br>
reacting of acetic acid (I) and ethylene (II) in the presence of oxygen to produce the vinyl acetic<br>
monomer (III):<br><br>
Water and by-products are also produced, notably ethyl acetate. United States Patent No.<br>
6,42O,595, entitled "Process Control for Vinyl Acetate Manufacturing" of Hallinan et al,<br>
provides an overview of the commercially preferred vapor-phase oxidation process wherein the<br>
crude product is fed to an azeotrope column and separated into a product stream and a waste<br>
ethyl acetate stream. Further details of this process appear in other patents, such as United<br>
States Patent No. 6,41O,817 to Colling and United States Patent No. 6,696,596 to Herzog et al.<br>
Alternatively, a liquid phase or mixed phase process can be used as is seen in United<br>
States Patent No. 6,62O,965 to Adams et al.<br>
United States Patent No. 5,225,388, entitled "Method for Making a Catalyst" of Wunder<br>
et al., relates to a process for the preparation of vinyl acetate from ethylene, acetic acid and<br>
oxygen or oxygen-containing gases on a catalyst which contains palladium and/or its<br>
compounds and, if desired, gold and/or gold compounds and alkali metal compounds as<br>
activators and, if desired, additionally cadmium compounds on a support which is composed of<br>
SiO2 or a SiO2 -Al2O3 mixture having a surface area of 50-250 m2 /g, a pore volume of 0.4-1.2<br>
ml/g and a particle size of 4 to 9 mm, which comprises compressing the support particles with<br><br>
the aid of an Li, Mg, Al, Zn or Mn salt of a C2 -C20 carboxylic acid or a mixture of such, salts as<br>
binder.<br>
United States Patent No. 4,897,161, entitled "Separation of Vinyl Acetate from Ethyl<br>
Acetate by Extractive Distillation" of Berg et al, describes a process whereby vinyl acetate can<br>
be readily separated from ethyl acetate by means of extractive distillation using certain glycols<br>
or glycol ethers. Typical effective agents are 2-methyl -2,4-pentanediol, 1,3-butanediol,<br>
ethylene glycol methyl ether and diethylene glycol ethyl ether.<br>
United States Patent No. 4,818,347, entitled "Process for the Isolation of Vinyl Acetate"<br>
of Roscher et al, relates to a process for the isolation of vinyl acetate from a gas mixture<br>
containing vinyl acetate, ethyl acetate, water and carbon dioxide formed in the reaction of<br>
ethylene with acetic acid and oxygen in the gas phase over catalysts containing palladium or<br>
palladium compounds. The gas mixture leaving the reaction zone is passed into a distillation<br>
column and the gas mixture leaving the top thereof is cooled. The gas, which is not condensed<br>
during the cooling, is washed with acetic acid in a washing column, an acetic acid solution<br>
containing vinyl acetate being obtained. The bottom product from the distillation column is<br>
passed to a second distillation column and a side stream containing ethyl acetate is removed<br>
from an enrichment zone above the bottom thereof, all or some of the bottom product from the<br>
second distillation column, which product chiefly consists of acetic acid, being used for the<br>
wash in the washing column. The top vapor of the second distillation column is cooled. A<br>
portion of the organic phase of the condensate thereby formed is passed, together with the acetic<br>
acid solution obtained as the bottom product in the washing column, into a third distillation<br>
column, which may have an intermediate tray. The bottom product of the third distillation<br>
column is passed into a fourth distillation column. Pure vinyl acetate is removed at the top of the<br>
fourth distillation column.<br>
Another process for the isolation of vinyl acetate by distillation is described in United<br>
States Patent No. 5,066,365 entitled "Process for the Isolation of Vinyl Acetate by Distillation"<br>
of Roscher et al. This process for the isolation of vinyl acetate involves not combining the<br>
bottom product of the recycled gas washings with the water-saturated vinyl acetate but rather<br>
introducing it to further multiple distillation columns from the gas mixture formed in the<br>
reaction of ethylene with acetic acid and oxygen over catalysts containing palladium or<br>
palladium compounds in the gas phase.<br><br>
A more exotic process is seen in United States Patent No. 5,821,384, entitled "Process<br>
for Generating Vinyl Carboxylate Esters" of Zoeller et ah, which describes a process for<br>
producing a vinyl carboxylate ester from a carbonyl compound and a carboxylic acid anhydride.<br>
The process comprises feeding a carboxylic acid anhydride to the middle portion of a reactive<br>
distillation column (RDC) while feeding a carbonyl compound to the lower section of the RDC<br>
and removing a product comprising the vinyl carboxylate ester. A carboxylic acid co-product<br>
corresponding to the anhydride reactant may be removed from the upper section of the RDC<br>
with the vinyl carboxylate ester, or from the upper section of the RDC as a separate side draw.<br>
Unreacted carbonyl may be removed from the RDC from the top along with the vinyl<br>
carboxylate ester or separately removed and recycled to the bottom portion of the RDC.<br>
Unreacted anhydride and an alkylidene dicarboxylate may be removed from the base of the RDC<br>
and recycled to the middle portion of the RDC. The product vinyl carboxylate may be further<br>
purified in one or two additional distillation vessels.<br>
Ethyl acetate may be prepared by a variety of processes, including by way of direct<br>
addition of acetic acid with ethylene, or by way of oxidative acetoxylation of ethylene followed<br>
by hydrogenation of vinyl acetate or by way of esterification of acetic acid with ethanol. The<br>
process of preparing ethyl acetate by direct addition is relatively expensive because of the<br>
equipment required for the process. These processes are represented as follows:<br>
Direct (Michael) Addition:<br><br>
Oxidative Acetoxylation/Hydrogenation:<br><br><br>
Esterification:<br><br>
Other processes include those which use acetaldehyde or ethanol as starting materials.<br>
The synthesis of lower aliphatic esters using heterpolyacids with an aldehyde-free<br>
product stream is described in United States Patent No. 6,187,949 entitled "Synthesis of Lower<br>
Aliphatic Esters Using Heterpolyacids with an Aldehyde-Free Product Stream" of Froom et al.<br>
This invention describes a process for the production of lower aliphatic esters by bringing<br>
together in an addition reaction a lower olefin and a saturated, lower aliphatic, mono-carboxylic<br>
acid in the vapor phase into contact with a heterpolyacid catalyst. The reactant olefin and acids<br>
and any recycled feeds are rendered substantially free of aldehyde impurities prior to being<br>
brought into contact with the heterpolyacid catalyst. Acetaldehyde is a catalyst poison and<br>
removal of these from the feeds prolongs life and activity of the heteropolyacid catalyst.<br>
United States Patent No. 6,727, 380 entitled "Oxidation Process for the Production of<br>
Alkenes and Carboxylic Acids" of Ellis et al, United States Patent No. 6,548,697 entitled<br>
"Oxidation Process for the Production of Alkenes and Carboxylic Acids" of Ellis et al, and<br>
United States Patent No. 6,476,261 entitled "Oxidation Process for the Production of Alkenes<br>
and Carboxylic Acids" of Ellis et al, describe a process for the oxidation of a C2 to C4 alkane to<br>
produce the corresponding alkene and carboxylic acid and further to integrated processes in<br>
which a portion of the produced alkene and carboxylic acid are used as reactants, in a second<br>
reaction zone, for the production of alkyl carboxylates.<br>
United States Patent No. 5,936,117, entitled "Carbonylation of Olefins" of Zoeller et al,<br>
describes a process for the preparation of aliphatic carbonyl compounds selected from aliphatic<br>
carboxylic acids, alkyl esters of aliphatic carboxylic acids and anhydrides of aliphatic carboxylic<br>
acids by the carbonylation of olefins in the presence of a catalyst system comprising (1) a<br>
primary component selected from at least one Group 6 metal, i.e., chromium, molybdenum,<br>
and/or tungsten and (2) a secondary component selected from at least one of certain halides and<br>
tertiary and quaternary compounds of a Group 15 element, i.e., nitrogen, phosphorus and/or<br>
arsenic. The process can be carried out at moderate carbonylation conditions without the<br><br>
necessity of using an expensive noble metal catalyst, volatile, toxic materials such as nickel<br>
tetracarbonyl, formic acid or a formate ester. United States Patent No. 4,405,808 entitled<br>
"Process for Preparing Acetic Acid Esters" of Nakajima et al. describes a process for preparing<br>
acetic acid esters by reacting acetic acid with an aliphatic lower olefin in vapor phase in the<br>
presence of steam and a catalyst selected from aromatic disulfonic acids and their esters. The<br>
high activity of the catalyst can be maintained and the product is obtained in a high space time<br>
yield by the presence of steam in the reaction. The effect of maintaining the high activity can be<br>
further increased by using silica treated with a strong acid as a carrier.<br>
United States Patent No. 4,365,084, entitled "Preparation of Alkyl Carboxylates" of<br>
Young, describes a method for the preparation of alkyl carboxylate compounds, and especially a-<br>
methylalkyl carboxylate compounds, by reaction of an olefin and a carboxylic acid compound in<br>
the presence of a particular type of zeolite catalyst. The zeolites are characterized by a silica to<br>
alumina mole ratio of at least 12 and a constraint index of 1 to 12.<br>
In connection with the production of either vinyl acetate or ethyl acetate a large portion<br>
of the capital and operating expense is due to purification requirements as is appreciated from<br>
the above references, as well as those discussed below.<br>
WO 03/011809 to BP Chemicals, February 2,2003, describes a process for separating<br>
secondary butanol impurity from ethyl acetate by feeding the impure ethyl acetate to a<br>
distillation column operating at a pressure of less than 1 bar absolute. This provides (1) a stream<br>
comprising ethyl acetate as a major component and (2) a residue or a second stream comprising<br>
at least some secondary butanol from ethyl acetate. The process can be applied to purifying<br>
ethyl acetate derived from (a) catalytic reaction of ethylene with acetic acid followed by (b) a<br>
hydrogenation step. The 2-butanone impurity produced in step (a) is difficult to separate from<br>
ethyl acetate, and step (b) converts it to secondary butanol, which can be separated by reduced<br>
pressure fractionation.<br>
A process for removing at least one compound selected from acetic acid, acetate esters<br>
and aldehydes from a gaseous fraction additionally containing carbon dioxide is described in<br>
United States Patent No. 6,663,692 entitled "Process for Purifying Carbon Dioxide-Containing<br>
Gas Streams" of de Poitiers et al. The process includes the steps of scrubbing in a scrubber at<br>
least part of the gaseous fraction with water and acetic acid to remove the acetic acid, acetate<br>
esters and/or aldehydes and removing carbon dioxide from the scrubbed product by absorption<br>
in aqueous potassium carbonate. The process may be used to remove acetate esters such as<br><br>
vinyl acetate and ethyl acetate and aldehydes such as acetaldehyde. The process may be<br>
employed in the manufacture of vinyl acetate by the reaction of ethylene, acetic acid and an<br>
oxygen-containing gas in the presence of a catalyst, or in the catalytic oxidation of (a) ethane<br>
and/or (b) ethylene to produce respectively (a) acetic acid and/or ethylene and (b) acetic acid.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides numerous advantages over the prior art. For one, overall<br>
throughput is increased for given capital investment. For another, purification costs are reduced<br>
by withdrawing a vinyl acetate stream enriched in ethyl acetate and converting the vinyl acetate<br>
to ethyl acetate rather than removing the ethyl acetate. Still another advantage of the invention<br>
is that the purge rate (raw material which is eventually discarded) is reduced with respect to<br>
conventional processing.<br>
A method of co-producing vinyl acetate and ethyl acetate in accordance with the<br>
invention includes: (a) reacting ethylene, acetic acid and oxygen to form vinyl acetate and at<br>
least a minor amount of ethyl acetate; (b) providing a crude product stream containing the vinyl<br>
acetate and ethyl acetate of step (a) and acetic acid to a distillation tower; (c) separating the<br>
crude product stream into: (i) a vinyl acetate product stream enriched in vinyl acetate with<br>
respect to the crude product stream; (ii) an acid recycle stream enriched in acetic acid with<br>
respect to the crude product stream; (iii) a mixed sidestream containing vinyl acetate and ethyl<br>
acetate, the mixed sidestream being enriched in ethyl acetate with respect to the vinyl acetate<br>
product stream; and (d) hydrogenating vinyl acetate in the mixed sidestream to provide an ethyl<br>
acetate product stream. Preferably, vinyl acetate in the mixed sidestream is catalytically<br>
hydrogenated using a Raney Nickel catalyst or a palladium/carbon catalyst. Hydrogenation may<br>
be carried out in a CSTR or in a fixed bed reactor, such as a trickle-bed reactor. The process<br>
typically further includes the step of distilling the ethyl acetate product stream, preferably using<br>
a single distillation tower.<br>
Generally, the vinyl acetate product stream of step (c) is substantially an azeotropic<br>
mixture of water and vinyl acetate and it preferably contains less than about 0.025 weight<br>
percent ethyl acetate based on the weight of ethyl acetate and vinyl acetate. The ratio of mass<br>
flow rates of vinyl acetate in the product stream to the flow rate in the mixed sidestream is<br>
typically from about 10:1 to about 2:1 and may be from about 6:1 to about 3:1 in many cases.<br>
The step of reacting ethylene, acetic acid and oxygen may be carried out in the liquid phase; but<br><br>
is perhaps more typically carried out in the vapor phase with a palladium catalyst or with a<br>
palladium/gold catalyst.<br>
An apparatus for co-producing vinyl acetate and ethyl acetate in accordance with the<br>
invention includes: (a) a reactor for reacting ethylene, acetic acid and oxygen to form vinyl<br>
acetate and at least a minor amount of ethyl acetate; (b) means for providing a crude product<br>
stream containing the vinyl acetate and ethyl acetate of step (a) and acetic acid to a distillation<br>
tower; (c) a distillation tower adapted for separating the crude product stream into: (i) a vinyl<br>
acetate product stream enriched in vinyl acetate with respect to the crude product stream; (ii) an<br>
acid recycle stream enriched in acetic acid with respect to the crude product stream; (iii) a mixed<br>
sidestream containing vinyl acetate and ethyl acetate, the mixed sidestream being enriched in<br>
ethyl acetate with respect to the vinyl acetate product stream; and (d) means for hydrogenating<br>
vinyl acetate in the mixed sidestream to provide an ethyl acetate product stream. The means for<br>
hydrogenating the mixed sidestream includes a CSTR reactor provided with a catalyst selected<br>
from Raney Nickel catalysts and palladium/carbon hydrogenation catalysts.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
The invention is described in detail below with reference to the drawings for purposes of<br>
exemplification and illustration only. Modifications within the spirit and scope of the present<br>
invention, set forth in the appended claims, will be readily apparent to those of skill in the art.<br>
Unless more specifically defined, terminology as used herein is given its ordinary<br>
meaning. Percent, for example, refers to weight percent. Throughout the specification and<br>
claims, the following abbreviations are sometimes used:<br><br>
"AcH" - Acetaldehyde;<br>
"CSTR" - Continuous stirred tank reactor;<br>
"DMK"- Dimethyl ketone;<br>
"EtAc" - Ethyl acetate;<br>
"HOAc"-Acetifc acid;<br>
"I-PrAc" - Isopropyl acetate;<br>
"I-PrOH - Isopropyl alcohol;<br>
"pBQ" - Para-benzoquinone;<br>
"Pd/C" - Palladium on carbon catalyst;<br>
"RaNi" or "Raney Ni" - Raney nickel catalyst;<br>
"STY" - Space/time yield; and<br>
"VAM"-Vinyl acetate.<br>
Vinyl acetate monomer is used in both a monomer form and a polymerized form. In the<br>
monomer form, vinyl acetate monomer has wide applicability in manufacture of synthetic<br>
adhesives, acrylic fiber, polymers and so forth. Alternatively, emulsions of vinyl acetate in<br>
polymer form include emulsions containing polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol and ethyl vinyl<br>
acetate. These emulsions in turn are used in various industries like wood, paper, rubber and so<br>
on. Typical specifications of vinyl acetate monomer are as follows:<br><br><br>
Ethyl acetate is generally used for adhesives, paint, offset inks, polymerization media,<br>
synthetic resins, and the like. Typical specifications of ethyl acetate are as follows:<br><br>
Ethyl acetate is a side-product impurity common to vinyl acetate manufacturing that<br>
requires removal in a purification system. Vapor phase, palladium catalyzed vinyl acetate<br>
systems typically produce ethyl acetate at a 1000 or more ppm level, which must be reduced to 
250 ppm in the vinyl acetate product. This reduction is conventionally achieved by distillation<br>
to concentrate the ethyl acetate in a waste stream. This waste stream (which is typically<br>
discarded) is currently minimized at high operating and capital cost to reduce waste of raw<br>
materials.<br>
In accordance with the present invention throughput is improved because there is<br>
diverted a larger mass flow of vinyl acetate with ethyl acetate in a sidestream which is provided<br>
to a hydrogenation reactor to convert vinyl acetate in the stream to ethyl acetate. Synergy<br>
derived advantages in efficiency, product yield, energy consumption and capital costs result.<br>
The co-production process reduces azeotropic tower rectification requirements and energy<br>
usage. One benefit of the inventive process is that it enables regional EtAc production directly<br>
tied to ethylene raw material pricing without spending capital for building a dedicated ethylene<br><br>
acetoxylation based EtAc production unit that is approximately 1.8-2.0 times higher in cost than<br>
an EtOH esterification unit with the same production capacity.<br>
As previously explained, the production of a vinyl acetate monomer is well known. The<br>
method comprises the combining of acetic acid (I) and ethylene (II) in the presence of oxygen to<br>
produce the vinyl acetic monomer (III):<br><br>
In accordance with the invention, hydrogenation of vinyl acetate monomer in a<br>
sidestream of vinyl acetate/ethyl acetate yields relatively pure ethyl acetate (IV):<br><br>
Various hydrogenation methods may be used, for example a single stage continuous<br>
stirred tank reactor (CSTR) or a trickle bed type reactor. With regard to catalysts, numerous<br>
options are available including Raney Ni and Pd/C type catalysts. Both catalysts are effective.<br>
The use of the nickel catalyst in high acid steams that could potentially come from azeotropic<br>
tower side stream locations near the base of the tower is not recommended. The Pd/C<br>
hydrogenation is substantially equivalent to Raney Ni. However, the nickel catalyst is generally<br>
a lower cost catalyst system that is available for hydrogenation of purer vinyl acetate monomer<br>
(i.e. one with lower HOAc content).<br>
Alternatively, hydrogenation of vinyl acetate may be performed with cyclometallated<br>
transition metal catalysts is described in United States Patent No. 4,645,849 entitled<br>
"Hydrogenation of Unsaturated Hydrocarbons with Cyclometallated Transition Metal Catalysts"<br>
of Lewis.. This method for hydrogenating unsaturated hydrocarbons comprises reacting an<br>
unsaturated hydrocarbon with hydrogen in a solution of cyclometallated complex catalyst at a<br>
temperature above about 20°C, the unsaturated hydrocarbon comprises less than about 50 mole<br>
percent of the reaction mixture and is selected from aliphatic and cyclic olefins and alkynes of<br><br>
from 2 to 10 carbon atoms, aromatic hydrocarbons of from 8 to 18 carbon atoms having olefinic<br>
or alkyne functionality within hydrocarbon radicals of from 2 to 4 carbon atoms and siloxanes of<br>
from 1 to 10 --(Si—O)— units having olefinic or alkyne functionality within hydrocarbon radicals<br>
of from 2 to 4 carbon atoms, subject to the proviso that the unsaturated hydrocarbons contain no<br>
acidic functional groups, and the cyclometallated complex catalysts having a 4-6 membered ring<br>
with a chemically combined unit of the formula:<br><br>
wherein M is a transition metal, L is a ligand selected from the group consisting of phosphorus,<br>
nitrogen, arsenic, oxygen and sulfur and C is a covalently bonded carbon atom of a hydrocarbon<br>
species having at least 6 carbon atoms.<br>
The ring structure is typically of the formulas:<br><br>
where Z is nitrogen or carbon.<br>
Preferably, the hydrogenation is effective to convert all or nearly all of the vinyl acetate<br>
so that the hydrogenated stream can be purified with a single distillation step.<br>
The following description and examples illustrate preferred methods and apparatus of the<br>
invention. These examples are illustrative only and do not limit the scope of the invention. All<br>
percentages are by weight, unless otherwise indicated.<br>
There is shown schematically in Figure 1, a typical apparatus 10 for manufacturing vinyl<br>
acetate by way of a vapor phase process. A catalytic reactor 20 reacts acetic acid, ethylene and<br>
oxygen to produce vinyl acetate, which exits the reactor to a product stream 22. Stream 22 is<br><br>
cooled in an effluent cooler 24 which feeds a vinyl acetate absorber column 26. Crude product<br>
stream 28 from the bottom of the absorber feeds an azeotrope tower 30. Ancillary streams are<br>
omitted for purposes of brevity, but may be configured as seen in the United States Patent No.<br>
6,42O,595 noted above.<br>
Crude stream 28 consists mainly of vinyl acetate, acetic acid and water, but also contains<br>
significant amounts of ethyl acetate.<br>
Tower 30 separates vinyl acetate, water and other light components from acetic acid.<br>
Vinyl acetate along with water approaching the vinyl acetate-water azeotrope is taken overhead<br>
as vinyl acetate product stream 32. The tower bottoms stream 34 is generally from 70% to 90%<br>
acetic acid, which is returned to the system.<br>
A sidedraw stream 38 is located at an elevation higher than the fed and is fed forward for<br>
hydrogenation. Stream 38 contains VAM, H2O, ethyl acetate and acetic acid, as further<br>
discussed below.<br>
Sidestream 38 is fed forward to a reactor 40 (Figure 2) which may be a CSTR reactor or<br>
a fixed bed reactor, together with a hydrogen stream 42. Reactor 42 optionally includes stirring<br>
means if hydrogenation is carried out in solution. Hydrogenation of the VAM fed by way of<br>
stream 38 is carried out in reactor 40 and the product, crude ethyl acetate, is fed forward at 44 to<br>
a distillation tower 46 which may be a divided or split tower as shown. Finished ethyl acetate is<br>
withdrawn at 48, while acetic acid is recycled via line 50. Overhead from tower 46 is decanted<br>
at 52, providing reflux to the column while minor components are purged or vented.<br>
The present invention compares very favorably with conventional processing in terms of<br>
raw material useage, capital, and energy costs. Consider the following. Oxidative acetoxylation<br>
VAM production units typically produce ~0.0016 tons EtAc per ton of VAM as a reaction by-<br>
product. This by-product is an impurity that must be separated from VAM for generation of<br>
sales grade product (
azeo-column, is then typically purged via a liquid sidestream draw-off below the feed tray; note<br>
the '595 Hallinan patent referenced above. The purge sidestream generally contains VAM,<br>
HO Ac, H2O, EtAc, and AcH in various ratios depending upon the number of trays in the azeo-<br>
column. The sidestream, for example, may contain ~17.5% VAM, -9% H2O, ~61% HOAc,<br>
~0.6% AcH and the EtAc is concentrated up to ~15.5%. The VAM unit eventually must dispose<br>
of the EtAc impurity resulting in an efficiency loss plus the energy and equipment costs<br>
necessary to concentrate the EtAc. If the 0.16 wt% EtAc formed in the reaction step must be<br><br>
attenuated to a specification level of at least 0.025 wt%, then this 0.135 wt% delta EtAc if<br>
concentrated to, for example, 15.5 wt% still results in a waste stream that is roughly 0.135/0.155<br>
= 0.87% (w/w) of the VAM production rate. Removal of all the EtAc would require a purge rate<br>
of-1.34%.<br>
With the present invention, production is integrated such that combined VAM and EtAc<br>
manufacturing units may use, for example, one-fourth of the VAM capacity could eliminate the<br>
current practice of using an azeotrope tower sidestream waste stream to control EtAc as an<br>
impurity in Specification VAM. A concerted VAM / EtAc co-production unit would not only<br>
eliminate this EtAc "bulge" waste stream, but it would also reduce the need for VAM catalysts<br>
and reactor operating conditions that were designed to minimize EtAc formation.<br>
Referring to Figures 1 and 2 above, a high volume liquid sidestream (i.e., -25% of the<br>
VAM unit production rate) taken at a tray slightly above the azeo tower feed tray would<br>
continue to concentrate HOAc in a high volume residue recycle stream and a low acid, low EtAc<br>
content overhead VAM stream (feed to VAM purification). The proposed liquid sidestream<br>
should contain primarily VAM, but also be contains H2O, a small amount of HOAc, and a<br>
sufficient quantity of EtAc to provide a sufficient purge of this VAM impurity to maintain<br>
specification VAM production. The liquid sidestream may have a composition as follows:<br>
-94.3 wt% VAM, -5.28 wt% H2O, 0.14 wt% HOAc, and -0.05 wt% EtAc. Hydrogenation of<br>
this stream produces a crude EtAc product (&gt;94% assay) containing HOAc, water, and a low<br>
concentration of light-ends (some from the crude VAM and some produced by the<br>
hydrogenation step).<br>
The invention is further appreciated by reference to the following examples, wherein<br>
materials, procedures and results are summarized in Table 3 and further described below.<br>
Examples: Hydrogenation of VAM to EtAc<br>
General Procedure: A 300 ml autoclave with stirrer was configured as a batch<br>
hydrogenation reactor for testing both Raney Nickel and Pd/C hydrogenation catalysts with<br>
either para-benzoquinone inhibited VAM or a synthetic sidestream VAM mixture. Hydrogen<br>
uptake was measured by pressure changes in a -2500 ml H2 reservoir used to feed the reactor H2<br>
through a pressure control valve used to maintain a constant reaction pressure set-point.<br>
Temperature control was generally accomplished by the flow of chilled water through an<br>
internal autoclave-cooling coil after initiation of the reaction by starting the stirrer. Reaction<br><br>
samples were collected from the reactor via a sintered stainless steel filtering element placed in<br>
the autoclave. Reaction charges, conditions, experimental data, and reactor sample analyses<br>
were included in Table3 (attached). Reaction times (minutes) listed in Table 3 refer to the H2<br>
uptake time. A preliminary run was made without addition of H2 to determine the compatibility<br>
of RaNi with HOAc containing reaction charges. The RaNi used in the experiments was Grace<br>
Raney 4310 w/Mo stored under water. RaNi (6.4 g, as dry weight) was rinsed three times with<br>
isopropanol and again with HOAc in a 125 ml flask, and then was transferred to the autoclave<br>
with additional HOAc. VAM inhibited with pBQ (500 ppm) was added to the autoclave, then<br>
the autoclave was pressurized with N2 to ~115 psig, and heated to ~72°C, with stirring (~1500<br>
rpm) for ~2 hours. The product sample was green in color and was analyzed to contain 3522<br>
ppm Ni, 0.18wt% H2O, 77.22 wt% VAM, 0.39 wt% EtAc, 21.67 wt% HOAc. The preliminary<br>
experiment was repeated using the isopropanol rinse, but with no HOAc rinsing or addition of<br>
HOAc to the reactor. The product from this test was clear with no color and was analyzed to<br>
contain 0.2 wt% H2O, 24.22 wt% isopropanol, and 74.75 wt% VAM. No compatibility<br>
problems were observed with isopropanol, but the presence of HOAc when using RaNi resulted<br>
in unacceptable nickel solubility losses.<br>
Raney Ni Catalyzed Hydrogenation (Examples 1-6)<br>
Six batch autoclave RaNi catalyzed VAM hydrogenation runs were conducted. The first<br>
experiment (Run-173) was made using the reactor charge from Run-169 (above) at a pressure of<br>
110 psig, stirrer rate = ~1500 rpm, target temperature = 50°C. The peak temperature from the<br>
exothermic reaction was 85°C.<br>
Example 2 was a repeat of the previous experiment with a fresh charge of RaNi (washed<br>
only with I-PrOH) conducted at a pressure of 105 +/- 2 psig, target temperature = 50°C (peak =<br>
61°C), and a -1500 rpm stirrer rate.<br>
Example 3 was also a repeat using another fresh charge of catalyst. The peak<br>
temperature was 54°C and the pressure was controlled in a range of 100 to 105 psig at a stirrer<br>
rate of ~1500 rpm.<br>
The reactor pressure was increased to ~204 psig for Example 4. The reaction<br>
temperature target was 5O, but briefly peaked at 89°C about three minutes after the stirrer<br>
(-1500 rpm) was started. The RaNi charge solvent exchange for Example 4 was attempted with<br>
just VAM to rinse off water from the catalyst, but the water reacted with the VAM resulting in<br><br>
solids sticking to the 125 ml flask used for the rinsing steps, the solution developed a green<br>
color, and gas evolution was noted. A new catalyst charge was rinsed using the I-PrOH<br>
procedure. Also, a new VAM feed solution was prepared using VAM from a 55 gallon drum<br>
with ~52 ppm para benzoquinone.<br>
Example 5 used a fresh charge of RaNi that was first rinsed with isopropanol followed<br>
by VAM rinses to remove most of the I-PrOH. The reaction temperature was maintained at<br>
~1500 rpm. The double solvent exchange method resulted in a low water "neat" VAM<br>
hydrogenation run.<br>
Example 6 was a repeat of the Example 5 using the Ra/Ni double solvent exchange<br>
method, a reaction temperature of ~50°C and a reaction pressure of—101 psig. However, the<br>
stirrer rate was decreased by half to ~750 rpm. The exotherm was noticeably less pronounced at<br>
the lower stirrer rate and the H2 uptake rate was essentially cut in half.<br>
Palladium on Carbon Catalyzed Hydrogenation (Examples 7-9")<br>
Three experiments were conducted using PMC 5% Pd on a carbon support. The Pd/C<br>
contained 58.13 wt% H2O. The catalyst charges were adjusted for water content and were<br>
reported in Table I on a "dry" basis.<br>
Example7 utilized HOAc, H2O, EtAc, VAM, pBQ and the Pd/C catalyst to approximate<br>
hydrogenation of a VAM azeo tower sidestream. The run was made at a pressure of 107 +/- 3<br>
psig at a temperature of about 50°C during the first 30 minutes. The hydrogen feed vessel<br>
showed no drop in pressure after about 4 minutes reaction time even with a ~10°C increase in<br>
the reaction temperature for the last 35 minutes of reaction time. The stirring rate was ~1000<br>
throughout the run.<br>
Example 8 was a repeat of the previous Pd/C catalyzed experiment, Example 7,<br>
including an increase in reaction temperature from the initial target = 50°C to 60°C during the<br>
last 30 minutes. The stirrer rate was ~1000 rpm during the run and the pressure was maintained<br>
at 103 +/- 3 psig. No H2 uptake was observed after the initial 6 minutes of reaction time.<br>
For example 9, the reaction vessel was charged with only Pd/C catalyst and VAM<br>
inhibited with 50 ppm pBQ. Operation was at 106 +/-3 psig pressure, initial target temperature<br>
~50°C during the first 30 minutes and 60°C during the last 30 minutes at a stirrer rate -1000<br><br>
rpm. The exotherm for this neat VAM run resulted in a maximum temperature of 59°C during<br>
the first ten minutes. Hydrogen uptake stopped after ~16 minutes reaction time.<br>
Representative results appear in Figure 3.<br>
As will be appreciated from Table 3 and Figure 3, the selectivity of VAM hydrogenation<br>
to EtAc was good for all of the experimental runs. Also, the autoclave stirrer rate made a<br>
noticeable difference in H2 uptake. No H2 uptake was observed unless the stirrer was started.<br>
The stirrer start time was used as the reaction time = zero for all of the heterogeneous catalyzed<br>
autoclave experiments. Although a direct comparison of initial H2 uptake rates between RaNi<br>
and Pd/C catalyzed runs was not made, Figure 3 shows plots for three of the VAM<br>
hydrogenation runs at three different autoclave stirrer rates. The RaNi catalyzed runs were made<br>
at roughly a 3% (w/w) catalyst concentration. The 5%Pd/C experiments were made at a lower<br>
catalyst concentration, i.e., 
catalyst level to 
comparable between the Ni and Pd catalysts as were the reaction rates, e.g., ~0.065 +/-0.004<br>
gmole/minute for the VAM hydrogenation runs conducted without HOAc. The STY calculated<br>
from the H2 uptake rates for all of the runs (both catalysts) was -30 +/-2 gmole/Liter/hour<br>
(excluding the low stirrer rate and high pressure runs in the average). The VAM hydrogenation<br>
molar conversions were high (&gt;95%) for most of the experimental runs (excluding the first RaNi<br>
and Pd/C runs). The VAM concentrations varied from 0.02 -1.12wt% in reactor product<br>
samples (excluding the initial experimental run)<br>
Impurities such as HOAc and AcH are consistent with VAM hydrolysis and EtOH can<br>
be formed by the hydrogenation of the AcH. Ethylene and HOAc can be generated from VAM.<br>
Ethylene can be a source of butylenes and hydrogenation of ethylene to ethane and butene to<br>
butane would be the expected subsequent products.<br>
The liquid phase, heterogeneous catalyzed hydrogenation of VAM and mixtures<br>
containing VAM was thus demonstrated with high conversions (&gt;95%) at good space-time yield<br>
(STY) reaction rates using mild hydrogenation conditions (i.e., 100 - 200 psig, 
Both Raney nickel (RaNi) and palladium on carbon (Pd/C) heterogeneous catalysts were<br>
tested with Specification Grade VAM, and the experimental results were fairly equivalent.<br>
Vinyl acetate hydrogenation in solutions containing acetic acid concentrations of 60 +/-5 wt%<br>
were also tested using Pd/C catalyst with good results. However, the RaNi catalyst system was<br>
found to be applicable to only catalyzing hydrogenation reactions of VAM with low HOAc<br><br>
content due to the high solubility of nickel in HOAc, which resulted in excessive RaNi catalyst<br>
losses.<br>
By-product impurities, such as, ethane, butane, and butane were produced in higher<br>
quantities using the RaNi catalyst. Ethane formation was assumed to be via hydrogenation of<br>
ethylene and was also formed in the low-acetic acid Pd/C catalyst experiment. Acetone<br>
formation during RaNi runs was attributed to dehydrogenation of isopropanol used to rinse<br>
water from the RaNi reaction charge.<br>
Initial H2 uptake rates used for RaNi experiments were -43 gmoles/L/hr at 100 psig<br>
(system pressure), ~50°C, and ~1500 rpm stirrer rates. Doubling the reactor operating pressure<br>
to 200 psig showed an increased H2 uptake rate that was at least three times the uptake rate<br>
observed for batch reactions conducted at 100 psig. Autoclave stirrer rates were varied from<br>
-750 to 1500 rpm and were also found to have a directly relationship with the H2 uptake rate.<br>
Raney nickel would be the preferred catalyst system for a "stand-alone" EtAc production unit<br>
that would be fed high assay (essentially Specification Grade) VAM.<br>
Synergistic co-production of VAM and EtAc of the invention is perhaps most applicable<br>
to construction of new production units to take advantage of the economy-of-scale capital<br>
savings associated with building a larger VAM unit necessary to supply VAM sales and to<br>
supply EtAc feedstock. Other advantages of VAM/EtAc co-production are: 1) the elimination<br>
of the current azeotrope tower waste stream (~1% of VAM production) required for EtAc<br>
impurity control and, 2) the need to used catalysts and VAM reactor conditions that are designed<br>
to minimize EtAc production.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
