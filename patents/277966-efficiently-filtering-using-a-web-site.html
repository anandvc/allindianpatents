BACKGROUND<br>
[0001 [    As computer technology has advanced to enable people to store more types and larger quantities of data on computer systems, there has been a growing need to enable people to find particular pieces of data that they had previously stored. For example, people frequently need to find old e-mails in their e-mail systems. Typically, people will perform a sort on values, such as the sender's name or something that would be in the e-mail's subject line. Examples of data that people store and want to find include documents, e-mails, and calendars, among other things.<br>
[00021     Collaboration types of software have also become available that enable people to organize many types of data, for example, as a part of accomplishing some type of project. For example, collaboration software can be used to list the people working on a project as well as organizing documents, e-mails, a calendar of tasks completed and tasks that need to be completed for the project.<br>
[00031     At various times, the people working on the project as well as their managers may want to find pertinent data. In order to find a desired document, for example, people typically perform a sort operation or a filter operation on documents that are associated with a project in the collaboration software.<br>
[0004]     However, as will become more evident, conventional sort and filter operations tend to be slow which discourages people from using them. For example, typically it takes approximately 30 seconds for a large amount of data to be filtered or sorted.<br>
 <br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0021|     Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments of the present technology for efficiently filtering using a web site, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While the technology for efficiently filtering using a web site will be described in conjunction with various embodiments, it will be understood that they are not intended to limit the present technology for efficiently filtering using a web site to these embodiments. On the contrary, the presented technology for efficiently filtering using a web site is intended to cover alternatives, modifications and equivalents, which may be included within the spirit and scope the various embodiments as defined by the<br>
 <br>
appended claims. Furthermore, in the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present technology for efficiently filtering using a web site. However, the present technology for efficiently filtering using a web site may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well known methods, procedures, components, and circuits have not been described in detail as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the present embodiments.<br>
[0022]     Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussions. it is appreciated that throughout the present detailed description, discussions utilizing terms such as "filtering", "providing", "receiving", "sorting", "determining", "displaying", "storing", "obtaining", "dividing", or the like, refer to the actions and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device. The computer system or similar electronic computing device manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (electronic) quantities within the computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission, or display devices. The present technology for efficiently filtering using a web site is also well suited to the use of other computer systems such as, for example, optical and mechanical computers. Additionally, it should be understood that in embodiments of the present technology for efficiently filtering using a web site, one or more of the steps can be performed manually.<br>
OVERVIEW OF EFFICIENTLY FILTERING USING A WEB SITE [0023]    With conventional filtering systems, when a user is interested in sorting or filtering data, the user can interact with their client to cause a web page with the data to be displayed on their client. The client will request the data from a web server and the web server will return the data to the client. The data can be displayed on the web page in the form of columns and rows where the columns describe the types of data that are in the fields for each row. A row shall also be referred to as an item. According to one embodiment, the data includes all of the values associated with the rows and the columns.<br>
|0024]     Each value associated with the data can be displayed in a field. For example, a value for a particular row under a particular column is displayed in a field. When the user requests that a filtering operation be performed, the client requests all of the data from the web server again. The web server performs the filtering operation on all of the data, which involves recalculating all of the values that would be displayed for all of the fields on the<br>
 <br>
web page. The client will re-update the entire web page as a part of displaying the results from filtering the data.<br>
|0025]     However, according to one embodiment of the present technology, an efficient method of filtering using a web site is provided. For example, as already stated, a column can represent a type of data. A user can request that distinct filtering values for a type of data be displayed. The distinct filtering values are displayed, according to one embodiment, without re-updating the entire web page. Since, for example, the distinct filtering values are for a subset of the data, the web server, according to one embodiment, does not have to recalculate all of the values for all of the fields for a web page as a conventional web server has to do. Since, for example, the distinct filtering values can be displayed without re-updating the entire web page, the client, according to one embodiment is more efficient than a conventional client. These are just two examples of ways various embodiments provide for efficiently filtering.<br>
A SYSTEM FOR EFFICIENTLY FILTERING USING A WEB SITE [0026]     Figure 1 depicts a block diagram of a system for efficiently filtering using a web site, according to one embodiment of the present technology. The system 100 includes a filtering values requestor 110 and a filtering values displayer 120. The filtering values requestor 110 can request distinct filtering values, for example, for a type of data. The filtering values displayer 120 can displaythedistinct filtering values, for example, with out re-updating the entire web page, as will become more evident.<br>
|0027]     Figure 2 depicts a block diagram of a networked system in which a system 100 for efficiently filtering using a web site operates, according to one embodiment of the<br>
present technology. For example, the networked system 200 includes a client 210, a web server 230, and storage 250. The client 210 and the web server 230, according to one embodiment, can communicate over a network.<br>
[0028]     The client 210 includes a system 100 for efficiently filtering using a web page 213 and a browser 212. The browser 212 includes the web page 213 and an invisible browser window 214. The web page 213 can be downloaded from a web site and displayed on the client 210 by the browser 212. Many different kinds of browsers, such as Internet Explorer™, Firefox™, and Netscape''" can be used. The memory 250 includes data 252. The data 252, according to one embodiment, includes distinct filtering values 262.<br>
 <br>
|0029]     As already stated, according to one embodiment of the present technology, an efficient method of filtering using a web site is provided. For example, assume that a user is only interested in filtering on a type of data from the data 252 stored on memory 250. Assume for the purposes of illustration, that the web page 213 displays rows that represent people, such as Jackie, Cheryl, and John. Further, assume that the web page 213 also displays that Jackie is a 40 year old inventor that lives in Washington, Cheryl is a 4 i old patent agent that lives in California and John is a 42 year old patent attorney that lives in Nevada. In this case, data 252 would include all of the values Jackie, Cheryl. John, 40, 41. 42, California, Washington and Nevada, according to one embodiment.<br>
[0030|     The column headers of web page 213 describe the types of the data 252, according to one embodimem. Examples of column headers are "Role," "Age," and "State." Values from the data 252 can be displayed in fields under each of the columns. Continuing the example, the fields under the "Role" column would be "inventor," "patent agent," and "patent attorney." In this case, the distinct filtering values 262 for the "Role" column are "inventor," "patent agent," and "patent attorney." The header of the column may have text that says "Role." If the user is interested in filtering on a particular type of role, for example, the user can interact with the header of the column to cause distinct filtering values 262 for that column to be displayed.<br>
[0031]     For example, the client 210 can request that the web server 230 return all of the distinct filtering values 262 for the "Role." The web server 230 returns the distinct filtering values 262 associated with "Role," The client 210 can use an invisible browser window 214 to store the distinct filtering values 262, e.g., "inventor," "patent agent," and "patent attorney." The distinct filtering values 262 can be displayed on the client 210 without re-updating the entire web page 213, according to one embodiment. For example, the distinct filtering values 262 that are in the invisible browser window 214 can be put into a drop down menu and displayedon the client 210.<br>
[0032]     Assume for the sake of illustration that the user is interested in finding the subset of the data 252 that pertains to inventors. In this case, the user can click on the distinct filtering value "inventor" displayed by the drop down menu. The client 210 can request that the web server 230 filter the data 252 based on the value "inventor." The web server 230 can return the rows for which the role is "inventor." Then the client 2IO's browser 212 can display the row for Jackie since in this illustration Jackie is the only inventor.<br>
 <br>
[0033]     According to one embodiment, distinct filtering values 262 are received without requiring retrieval of filtering values that are unrelated to the selected type of data. Continuing the example, the selected type of data is "Role" and the filtering values that are unrelated to the selected type of data include the states, such as California, Nevada, and Washington, and the ages, such as 40, 41, and 42.<br>
WEB PAGE [0034]     Figure 3 depicts a web page that can be used for efficiently filtering using a web site, according to one embodiment of the present technology. As depicted in Figure 3, the web page 300 is associated with collaboration software, such as Windows Share Point Services'""", and therefore enables filtering data 252 associated with the collaboration software, according to one embodiment. The web page 300, according to the embodiment depicted in Figure 3, depicts all of the shared documents 310 associated with a project. In the embodiment depicted on Figure 3 all of the shared documents 310 are examples of data 252.<br>
[0035]    The browser 212 ofthe client 210 can be used fordisplaying the web page 300. According to one embodiment, the web page 300 is an example of a web page 213. By clicking on or moving the mouse over a column header 320 a visual representation that can be used to request distinct filtering values 262 is displayed, according to one embodiment. For the sake of illustration, assume that the user ofthe client 210 desires to filter on people who have modified data 252 associated with the collaboration software.<br>
[0036]     According to one embodiment, the web pages depicted in figures 3-10 are examples of web pages 213.<br>
VISUAL REPRESENTATION OF A REQUEST FOR DISTINCT FILTERING VALUES<br>
[0037]     Figure 4 depicts a block diagram ofthe "modified by" column header 410 with a visual representation of a request for distinct filtering values 420, according to one embodiment of the present technology.<br>
[0038]     A user may want to perform a filtering operation. Therefore, the user may want to see distinct filtering values 262 for a particular type of data they are interested in. As depicted in figure 4, the column header would enable filtering for documents modified by a<br>
 <br>
particular person. In this case, according to one embodiment member as depicted in figure 4 describes a type of data that a user would be interested in.<br>
[0039]     Therefore, according to one embodiment, a request for distinct filtering values is visually represented to the user as "a visual representation of a request for distinct filtering values 420." Note, that according to one embodiment, the "modified by" header 320 does not depict a visual representation for requesting distinct filtering values 420. According to one embodiment, the visual representation 420 is displayed on a web page 300 by either clicking on the column header 320 or by moving the mouse over the column header 320.<br>
|0040]     According to one embodiment, distinct filtering values 262 are displayed as a result of the visual representation 420 being clicked on. For example, when the visual representation 420 is clicked on, the filtering values requestor 110 can request the distinct filtering values 262 and the web server 230 can return the distinct filtering values 262. The filtering values displayer 120 can display the distinct filtering values 262, for example as described herein.<br>
[0041]    According to another embodiment, the filtering values requestor 110 can request distinct filtering values 262 prior to a column header 320 being clicked on. For example, distinct filtering values 262 can be requested and displayed on a client 210 as the result of moving the mouse over a column header 320.<br>
INVISIBLE BROWSER WINDOW [0042]     As already stated, an invisible browser window 214 can be used as a part of displaying distinct filtering values 262. For example, after a user clicks on a visual representation 420, the filtering values requestor 110 can receive the distinct filtering values 262 from a web server 230. The filtering values displayer 120 can store the distinct filtering values 262 in an invisible browser window 214, According to one embodiment, the invisible browser window 214 is an iFrame. An invisible browser window 214 may also be referred to as a "browser frame."<br>
[0043]    The filtering values displayer 120 can take the distinct filtering values 262 out of the invisible browser window 214 and then display the distinct filtering values 262 without requiring the entire web page 213 to be redisplayed. For example, the distinct filtering values 262 can be taken out of the invisible browser window 214 and displayed in a drop<br>
 <br>
down menu. Using an invisible browser window 214 enables, among other things, a user's experience to be for the most part uninterrupted, according to one embodiment.<br>
DROP DOWN MENU [0044]     The present technology displays a drop down menu that depicts distinct filtering values 262, according to one embodiment. Figure 5 depicts a drop down menu 500 of displayed filtering choices 510, according to one embodiment of the present technology. According to one embodiment, a drop down menu 500 is a portion of a web page 213. According to one embodiment, sort orders 520 and distinct filtering values 262 are examples of filtering choices 510. The sort orders 520 can be used for sorting the results from performing a filtering operation.<br>
[0045]     A value 530 can be selected from the distinct filtering values 262 in order to perform a filtering operation using this selected value 530. As depicted in figure 5. the selected value 530 is Mark Smith. The value 530 can be selected from the distinct filtering values 262 which results in filtering data 252 using Mark Smith.<br>
[0046] Figure 6 depicts a web page 600 that displays results from performing a filtering operation using the selected value Mark Smith, according to one embodiment. The results depicted in figure 6 are examples of dates that documents were modified by Mark Smith.<br>
[0047]     As already stated, conventional filtering systems re-update a web page 213 each time a filtering operation is perfornied due to limitations of HTML and JavaScript. However, according to one embodiment, using a drop down menu allows efficient filtering by eliminating the need to re-update the entire web page 213.<br>
DISTINCT FILTERING VALUES AND FILTERING CHOICES [0048]     Figure 7 depicts a web page 700 with a drop down menu 500 displaying filtering choices 510, according to another embodiment. According to one embodiment, the number of values that result from a filtering operation being performed can be rather large. For example for the purposes of illustration assume that the data 252 (figure 2) includes the cities that a company's customers are located in. Further assume that there are a million customer cities. Therefore, according to one embodiment, the distinct filtering values 262 enable that a subset of the million cities be provided to the client 210 (figure 2), For example, 25 of the million cities may be provided to the client 210. Customers' cities is an example of a type of data, accordine to one embodiment.<br>
 <br>
10049]     Inanotherexample, a specified percentage, such as 15%or 20%, ofthe 100,000 cities may be provided to the client 210. For example, as depicted in figure 7 two ofthe distinct filtering values are 15% filtering value 710 and 20% filtering value 720. If the 15% filtering value 710 is selected, then 15% of the million cities can be stored in the invisible browser window 214 which can then be displayed in a drop down menu. If the 20% filtering value 720 is selected, then 20% of the million cities can be stored in the invisible browser window 214 which can then be displayed in the drop down menu.<br>
[0050]     According to one embodiment, the distinct filtering values 262 represent groups of data 252. Continuing the example of a million chies, the distinct filtering values 262 may represent cities that start with letters A-D, the cities that start with letters E-G, and so on. For example, the distinct filtering values 262 displayed on a drop down menu on the client 210 may have the text "Cities starting with letters A-D," "Cities starting with letters E-G," and so on. If "cifies starting with letters E-G" is selected, then the data 252 is filtered for the cifies starting with letters E-G, according to one embodiment. The cities starting with letters E-G can be returned to and displayed on the client 210.<br>
[0051]     According to one embodiment, a portion ofthe data 252 is divided into groups that the distinct filtering values 262 represent. For example, cities may be a portion ofthe data 252 which are divided into groups as described herein.<br>
[0052]    According to one embodiment, the groups are displayed in cascading menus. For example, the group of cities that start with letters A-D may be displayed in one cascading menu and the group of cifies that start with letters E-G may be displayed in another cascading menu and so on.<br>
[0053]     According to one embodiment, the groups of data 252 that the distinct filtering values 262 represent may be determined dynamically. For example, at one point of time there may be only a few cities and then at a later point of time there maybe a large number of cities. When there are a small number of cities there may only be two groups such as the cities starting with letters A-M and the cities starting with letters N-Z. When there are a large number of cities there may be a larger number of groups such as the example previously given.<br>
 <br>
(0Q54|     Figure 8 depicts a web page 800 with a distinct filtering value 810 that has been selected, according to one embodiment, For example as depicted in figure 8, the 20% filtering value 810 is checked because a user selected the 20% filtering value 810.<br>
[0055]    According to one embodiment, a user can type a few letters to jump lo a distinct filtering value 262 that starts with those first few letters. For example assume that the distinct filtering values 262 are displayed on a client 210 and the user is interested in finding the city "Milwaukee." The user can type in the letter "M" and the cities that start with "M" will be displayed. In another example, the user can type in "Mil" and the cities that start with "Mil" will be displayed.<br>
|0056|     According to one embodiment, the speed at which the letters are typed in affects which distinct filtering values 262 are displayed. For example, if the user wants to type in "Mil" but types in each of the letters slowly, the distinct filtering values 262 that start with "M" may be displayed then the distinct filtering values 262 that start with "Mi" may be displayed finally the distinct filtering values 262 that start with "Mil" may be displayed.<br>
[0057]     In the event that the client 210cannot display the distinct filtering values 262 in a relatively short time, figure 9 depicts a web page 900 with a message 910 indicating that distinct filtering values 262 are in the process of being displayed on the client 210, according to one embodiment. For example, the message 910 may be displayed when a threshold of time has elapsed. According to one embodiment, an example of a threshold of time is 5 seconds. According to another embodiment, an example of a threshold of time is 3/10 of a second.<br>
[0058]     Figure 10 depicts a web page 1000 with a drop down menu 500, according to yet another embodiment. The number of distinct filtering values 262 may be too large to efficiently filter 15% or 20% of the data 252. For example, if the number of cities is a million, 15% or 20% of a million may be too large to efficiently provide to a client 210. In this case, the distinct filtering values 262 can include a show filter choices 1010 that enable the user to select, for example, 1% or 2% instead of 15% or 20%.<br>
[0059]     The distinct filtering values 262 enable a subset of the data 252 to be presented on a client 210, according to one embodiment. For example, a user can select the 20% distinct filtering value 720 resulting in 20% of a type of data 252. More specifically,<br>
 <br>
assume a type of data is the names of people working on a project. Clicking on the 20% 720 in this case would result in 20% of the names being returned to the client 210.<br>
10060]     According to one embodiment, the distinct filtering values 262 only include distinct values associated with a type of data. For example, assume that the type of data is "modified by," however one of the people associated with a project hasn't modified any documents. In this case, the distinct filtering values 262 would not include the name of that person, for example.<br>
[00611     Sort orders and percentages are two examples of filtering choices. Referring to figures 7-10, examples of visual representations of sort orders are "smallest on top," •'largest on top," "ascending," "descending," and visual representations (760 and 780) with the letters "A," "Z," and the arrows. The visual representations (760 and 780) with the letters "A," "Z" and the arrows provide user friendly indications of types of sorts that can be performed for example in conjunction with filtering. For example, visual representation 760 with the A on top of the Z indicates that the results from a sort would start with the letter A and end with the letter Z. Alternatively, visual representation 780 with the lener Z on top of A indicates that the results from a sort would start with the letter Z and end with the letter A.<br>
(0062]     According to one embodiment, the present technology detects types of values that can be filtered or sorted. The displayed distinct filtering values, according to one embodiment, are user friendly text descriptions that correspond to the types of the values. For example, the terms "ascending" and "descending" mean different things depending on the types of values. Table 1 depicts distinct filtering values 262 that correspond to the conventional terms "ascending" and "descending," according to various embodiments.<br>
[0063]    Table 1: distinct filtering values that correspond to the conventional terms "ascending" and "descending," according to one embodiment.<br>
<br>
Type of Value	Ascending	Descending<br>
Text	A on top	Z on top<br>
Date	Oldest on top	Newest on top<br>
Numerical	Smallest on top	Largest on top<br>
Attachments	Blanks on top	Attachments on top<br>
 <br>
10064]     The first column of Table 1 designates the type of the values that can be associated with data 252. The second column of Table I designates distinct filtering values that corresponding to the conventional term "Ascending" according to one embodiment. The third column of Table 1 designates distinct filtering values that correspond to the conventional term "Descending," according to another embodiment. For example, if values associated with data 252 are text then the distinct filtering values presented to a user are "A on top" and "Z on top," according to one embodiment, and so on.<br>
SORTING AND FILTERING [0065]    As can be seen, according to one embodiment, methods and systems are provided for sorting and filtering in a user friendly intuitive manner. For example, referring to figure 7, a split button 740 is depicted on web page 700, according to one embodiment. A split button 740, according to one embodiment, provides for sorting and for filtering. As depicted in figure 7, split button 740 includes the text"% complete" and visual representation of a request for distinct filtering values 750. For example, if a user clicks on the text"% complete", then sorting is performed. If the user clicks on the visual representation 750, then distinct filtering values 262 can be displayed. The visual representation 750 is an example of a visual representation of a request for distinct filtering values 420, according to one embodiment.<br>
[0066]     According to various embodiments, distinct filtering values 262 can be sorted. For example, distinct filtering values 262 displayed on figure 5 are sorted alphabetically. Various embodiments of the present technology can be used for sorting distinct filtering values 262 but also for sorting and filtering data 252. For example, the distinct filtering values 262 depicted in figure 5 are an example of distinct filtering values that have been sorted. For an example of using various embodiments to filter and sort data 252, assume that a distinct filtering value "cities starting with letters E-G" is selected. The web server 230 can filter the data 252 based on the distinct filtering value "cities that start with E-G" and then the filtered cities can be sorted. Although these examples of embodiments described filtering being performed before sorting, sorting can be performed before filtering.<br>
 <br>
EXAMPLE COMPUTER SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT [0067]     With reference now to figure 11, portions of the technology for efficiently filtering using a web site are composed of computer-readable and computer-executable instructions that reside, for example, in computer-usable media of a computer system. That is, figure 11 illustrates one example of a type of computer that can be used to implement embodiments, which are discussed herein, of the present technology for efficiently filtering using a web site. Figure 11 illustrates an exemplary computer system 1100 used in accordance with embodiments of the present technology for efficiently filtering using a web site. It is appreciated that system 1100 of figure II is exemplary only and that the present technology for efficiently filtering using a web site can operate on or within a number of different computer systems including general purpose networked computer systems, embedded computer systems, routers, switches, server devices, client devices, various intermediate devices/nodes, stand alone computer systems, and the like. As shown in figure 11, computer system 1100 of figure 11 is well adapted to having peripheral computer readable media 1102 such as, for example, a floppy disk, a compact disc, and the like coupled thereto.<br>
[0068]     System llOOoffigure II includes an address/data bus 1104 for communicating information, and a processor 1106A coupled to bus 1104 for processing information and instructions. As depicted in figure 11, system 1100 is also well suited to a multi-processor environment in which a plurality of processors 1106A, 1106B, and 1106C are present. Conversely, system 1100 is also well suited to having a single processor such as, for example, processor 1106A. Processors 1106A, 1I06B, and 1106C may be any of various types of microprocessors. System 1100 also includes data storage features such as a computer usable volatile memory 1108, e.g. random access memory (RAM), coupled to bus \ 104 for storing \nformatioi\ and instructions for processors 1106A, 1106B, and 1106C. System 1100 also includes computer usable non-volatile memory 1110, e.g. read only memory (ROM), coupled to bus 1104 for storing static information and instructions for processors 1106A, H06B, and 1106C. Also present in system HOO is a data storage unit 1112 (e.g., a magnetic or optical disk and disk drive) coupled to bus 1104 for storing information and instructions. System 1100 also includes an optional alphanumeric input device 1114 including alphanumeric and function keys coupled to bus 1104 for communicating information and command selections to processor 1106A or processors 1106A, 11068, and 1106C. System 1100 also includes an optional cursor control device 1116 coupled to bus 1104 for communicating user input information and command selections to processor 1106A or processors 1I06A, 1106B, and 1I06C. System 1100 of<br>
 <br>
the present embodiment also includes an optional display device 1118 coupled to bus 1104 for displaying information.<br>
[ 0069]     Referring still to figure il, optional display device 1118 of figure 11 may be a liquid crystal device, cathode ray tube, plasma display device or other display device suitable for creating graphic images and alphanumeric characters recognizable to a user. Optional cursor control device 1116 allows the computer user to dynamically signal the movement of a visible symbol (cursor) on a display screen of display device 1118, Many implementations of cursor control device 1116 are known in the art including a trackball, mouse, touch pad, joystick or special keys on alpha-numeric input device 1114 capable of signaling movement of a given direction or manner of displacement. Alternatively, it will be appreciated that a cursor can be directed and/or activated via input from alpha-numeric input device 1114 using special keys and key sequence commands. System 1100 is also well suited to having a cursor directed by other means such as, for example, voice commands. System 1100 also includes an 1/0 device 1120 for coupling system HOG with external entities. For example, in one embodiment, I/O device 1120 is a modem for enabling wired or wireless communications between system 1100 and an external network such as, but not limited to, the Internet.<br>
[0070]     Referring still to figure 11, various other components are depicted for system 1100. Specifically, when present, an operating system 1122, applications 1124, modules 1126, and data 1128 are shown as typically residing in one or some combination of computer usable volatile memory 1108, e.g. random access memory (RAM), and data storage unit 1112. In one embodiment, the present technology for efficiently filtering using a web site, for example, is stored as an application 1124 or module 1126 in memory locations within RAM 1108 and memory areas within data storage unit 1112.<br>
EXEMPLARY METHOD OF EFFICIENTLY FILTERING USING A WEB SITE [0071]     Figure 12 depicts a flowchart for a method of efficiently filtering using a web site, according to one embodiment of the present technology. Although specific steps are disclosed in flowchart 1200, such steps are exemplary. That is, various embodiments of the present technology are well suited to performing various other steps or variations of the steps recited in flowchart 1200. It is appreciated that the steps in flowchart 1200 may be performed in an order different than presented, and that not all of the steps in flowchart 1200 may be performed.<br>
 <br>
(00721     The computer-readable and computer-executable instructions reside, for example, in data storage features such as computer usable volatile memory 1108, computer usable non-volatile memory 1110, and/or data storage unit 1112 of figure 11. The computer-readable and computer-executable instructions are used to control or operate in conjunction with, for example, processor 1106A and/or processors 1106A. [106B, and 1106C of figure 111. Although specific steps are disclosed in flowchart 12, such steps are exemplary. That is, embodiments are well suited to performing various other steps or variations of the steps recited in flowchart 12. It is appreciated that the steps in flowchart 12 may be performed in an order different than presented, and that not all of the steps in flowchart 12 may be performed.<br>
[0073)     In step 1210, the method begins.<br>
[0074]     In step 1220, distinct filtering values based on a type of data selected from a web page are received. For example, assume for the purposes of illustration that data 252 is associated with collaboration software and includes documents, e-mails, calendars, and a list of people that work on a project. A web page 213 displays the data 252 on a client 210. Web page 300 {figure 3) is an example of a web page 213 for displaying data 252 associated with collaboration software.<br>
(0075J     A user interacts with the client 210 which causes the client 210 to request that a web server 230 provide distinct filtering values 262 from memory 250 to the client 210. For example, the user may be interested in obtaining all of the documents that have been modified by Mark Smith. The user can cause the client 210 to request distinct filtering values 262 by moving a mouse over a column header 320 (figure 3) displayed on their client 210. Alternatively, the user cause the client 210 to request distinct tlhering values 262 by clicking on the column header 320 resulting in a visual representation of a request for distinct filtering values 420 being displayed and then clicking on the visual representation 420 to cause the distinct filtering values 262 to be retrieved.<br>
|0076]     The filtering values requestor 110 can request that the web server 230 transmh the distinct filtering values 262 to the client 210. For the purposes of illustration, assume that the distinct filtering values 262 are the names of people who have modified documents associated with data 252.<br>
 <br>
[0077]     In this illustration, "modified by" is an example of a type of data. In this illustration, distinct filtering values associated with calendars and e-mails are examples of distinct filtering values that are unrelated to the selected type of data. For example, a column of a web page 213 may be for the subject line of e-mails and the distinct filtering values that would result from clicking on that column may be all of the subject lines of e-mails for a project. The subject lines for the e-mails do not need to be retrieved in order to retrieve the names of people who have modified documents.<br>
[0078]     In step 1230, the distinct filtering values are displayed without requiring the web page to be entirely updated. For example,the client 210 can receive the distinct filtering values 262. The filtering values displayer 120 can store the received filtering values 262 in an invisible browser window 214. The distinct filtering values 262 can be taken out of the invisible browser window 214 and put into a drop down menu 500 as depicted in figure 5. By using a drop down menu 500, the endre web page 213 will not have to be redrawn. The use of a drop down menu 500 is one example of a way of not requiring the entire web page 213 to be redrawn.<br>
[0079]     In step 1240, the method stops.<br>
[0080] Assume for the sake of illustration, that the user clicks on the distinct filtering value 530 for Mark Smith depicted on figure 5. The client 210 will request that the web server 230 filter the data 252 for the rows associated with documents that were last modified by Mark Smith, according to one embodiment. The web server 230 can return the rows associated with documents that were last modified by Mark Smith to the client 210. The client can display the results of the filtering operation as depicted in figure 6.<br>
CONCLUSION [0081]     Although many of the embodiments described herein referred to distinct filtering values 262, various embodiments of the present technology can be used with filtering choices 510. For example, referring to figure 7 the filtering choices include the sort orders "smallest on top" and "largest on top."    A web server 230 can determine the filtering choices depicted in figure 7 for example by determining the different types of the values in the data 252. For example, referring to Table I if one type of the values in data 252 is numerical then filtering choices can include "smallest on top" and "largest on top.'<br>
 <br>
[0082]     Further the web server 230 can determine whether the results from a potential filtering operation would be large. The filtering choices also include percentages, such as 15% and 20%, according to one embodiment. In this case, the web server 230 can determine that the distinct filtering values 262 could include 15% and 20%. according to one embodiment.<br>
