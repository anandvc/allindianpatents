3.PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
PROVISIONAL<br>
The following specification describes the invention.<br>
COMPLETE<br>
The following specification particularly describe the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
Title of invention: "The treatment of effluent from resin manufacturing plant"<br>
Field of invention: Present invention relates to the industrial liquid waste treatment. More particularly it relates to the treatment of liquid waste coming out from Resin Manufacturing Plant.<br>
Prior art:     Resins are manufactured for various purposes including purification of water. During the manufacturing process of â– resin large amount of water is used. Naturally these units let out large quantity of liquid waste. The water coming out of such units is of typical character. Being loaded with high amount of COD, BOD &amp; TDS, it cannot be disposed of as it is without treatment. Also because of the typical character of this water it cannot be used for any purpose because of high amount of dissolved impurities. It is this character of this effluent which poses lot of difficulties for the industry in storage and disposal.<br>
The toxic dissolved solids &amp; other organics, contribute to the high level of COD.BOD &amp; TDS making it extremely difficult for the effluent to be disposed of as it is, being beyond local/national pollution control board norms. This typical characteristic of this effluent was the main reason for putting these units among high polluting industries in India.<br>
Drawbacks of Prior art: The traditional methods of treatment procedures such as Equalisation, coagulating agents, clarification, filtration, bio reactor aeration and filtration for land disposal and treated sludge for drying beds, the end water is not within the Pollution Control Board norms.<br>
Recently, reverse osmosis method is being used by some industries. This system is an filtration and not a treatment. Generally one gets 50% super ant and 50% reject with double the concentration. Reject water poses lot of difficulties for storage as well as disposal.<br>
Sun drying for reject water requires huge land for storage. Also it has a serious problem of percolation which results in contamination of fresh water source. As regards the incinerationjt's main problem is disposal of ash. Also energy requirement is very high in this case.<br><br>
Object of present invention<br>
Object of present invention is to provide a full proof zero discharge system for resin manufacturing plant liquid waste.<br>
Furthermore object of present invention is to provide a system which is economical can be used as per requirement.<br>

Fig. 1 shows Flow Process Block Diagram of present invention system.<br>
Description of present invention<br>
The foregoing objects of the invention are accomplished and the problems and shortcomings associated with prior art techniques and approaches are overcome by the present invention as described below in the preferred embodiment. This invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawings, throughout which like reference letters indicate corresponding parts in the various figures.<br>
According to present invention, "The treatment of effluent from resin manufacturing plant" process starts with the equalisation of various streams in equalisation tank.( 1 ) The equalised liquid/mixture so prepared is now ready for continuous chemical treatment. Chemical flow is maintained in chemical dosing tank (2 ).For easy &amp; quick mixing of chemicals these are kept in slurry form. The formulations added at this stage include mixtures of oxidising agents and flocculating agents. The oxidising agents include mixtures of permanganate salts and peroxide compounds. Flocculating agents include mixtures of sulphates of 3rd analytical group of cations. Waste water treated with said formulations is retained in the reaction vessel ( 3 ) for a period of one hour to six hours for a complete reaction. After treatment sludge &amp; liquid is separated. Sludge is discharged from the bottom of reaction vessel ( 3 ) &amp; taken to the drying yard. Super ant liquid is collected in buffer tank (4) and then passed through sand filter (5) and carbon filter (6). Other set of chemicals are added to the outlet of carbon filter. This set of chemicals include mixtures of flocculating agents comprising of sulphates of 3rd analytical group of cations and neutralising agents comprising of salts of alkaline earth metals (Group 2 of periodic table - s block). This mixture is then directed to the reaction vessel for complete reaction for one hour to six hours. After treatment precipitated sludge is<br><br>
discharged through the bottom of the reaction vessel &amp; super ant liquid is taken into the buffer tank. This collected liquid is passed through the sand filter &amp; carbon filter. Outlet of carbon filter is the water which is ready for passing through Reverse Osmosis Mechanism (7) mainly for reduction of TDS.<br>
The sequence of addition of above mentioned mixtures of formulations is the essence of this technology.<br>
During treatment, for easy &amp; quick mixing of chemicals, formulations are kept ready in the slurry form with the help of agitator mixer. Proper mixing at each dosing station is ensured with the help of dosing pumps.<br>
At the end the separated sludge is dried further in the drying yard &amp; the same is to be disposed by sending it to the dumping ground.<br>
Treated/separated water will be the water suitable to be used as Industrial Process Water &amp; or can be disposed of on land/sea being within the board norms. Depending upon the end use of the treated water, further filtration can be done with the help of available technologies like E.D., DM plant etc.<br>
Typical characteristics of Effluent from resin manufacturing plant<br>
Following are the average results achieved on a pilot scale.<br><br>
SR. NO.	DESCRIPTION	BEFORE TREAMENT	RESULTS AFTER TREATMENT<br>
1	pH	8 TO 10	7 TO 8<br>
2	COD	7000 TO 9000	LESS THAN 250<br>
3	BOD	LESS THAN 3000	LESS THAN 25<br>
4	TDS	20,000 TO 30,000	LESS THAN 2000<br><br>
5	COLOUR	YELLOW	COLOURLESS<br>
6	ODOUR	TYPICAL	ODOURLESS<br>
As regards the water after passing through present invention process the Industrial Process Water which can be used for any industrial requirements. Further filtration of this water can be done with the help of ultra Filtration, ED plant, DM plant etc.<br>
The foregoing objects of the invention are accomplished and the problems and shortcomings associated with prior art techniques and approaches are overcome by the present invention described in the present embodiment.<br>
Detailed descriptions of the preferred embodiment are provided herein; however, it is to be understood that the present invention may be embodied in various forms. Therefore, specific details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but rather as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to employ the present invention in virtually any appropriately detailed system, structure or matter.<br>
The embodiments of the invention as described above and the methods disclosed herein will suggest further modification and alterations to those skilled in the art. Such further modifications and alterations may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
Advantages of present invention: (A) General:<br>
1.	This is a permanent solution to the chronic pollution problem of the Industry.<br>
2.	This is the total package for zero discharge in the real sense.<br>
3.	Water conservation due to recycling of treated liquid waste.<br>
4.	Elimination of problems due to percolation.<br>
5.	System is not the filtration but the treatment of liquid waste.<br>
(B). SALIENT FEATURES OVER OTHER KNOWN TECNOLOGIES:<br>
1.  By installing this technology, industry need not to be closed for pollution problems as the system is on line is operated on day to day basis.<br><br>
2.	Huge power cost for running aeration (secondary) plant is eliminated.<br>
3.	No need of high-tech machinery.<br>
4.	This system is designed on indigenously available machinery.<br>
5.	Low capital cost when compared with other technologies.<br>
