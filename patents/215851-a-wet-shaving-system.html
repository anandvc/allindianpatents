				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a wet shaving system.<br>
in shaving systems of the wet shave type, factors such as the frictional drag of the razor across tha skin, the force needed to sever hairs, and irritation of preexisting skin damage can create a degree of shaving discomfort.  Discomfort and other problems accompanying wet shaving systems can be alleviated by the application of shaving aids to the skin. Shaving aids may be applied prior to, during, or after shaving.<br>
A number of problems accompany the use of pre- and post-applied shaving aids. Prs-applied shaving aids can evaporate or can be carried away from the site of application by repeated strokes of the razor.  Post-applied shaving aids are not present: on the skin during shaving and thus their application may be too late to prevent an unwanted effect.  Moreover, the application of both pre-applied and post-applied shaving aids add additional steps to the shaving process.<br>
It is known to incorporate a shaving aid into a razor by mounting a composite including the shaving aid to the razor. For example, Rogers et al., U.S. Pat. Mo. 5,113,585 describes a composite including a water-insoluble matrix material, a water-aoluble shaving aid, and a low molecular weight release enhancing agent. When exposed to water during shaving, the water-soluble shaving aid leaches from the composition onto the skin. The release enhancing agent also dissolves in the water and Improves the release of the water-soluble shaving aid from the composite.<br>
The invention features a wet shaving system.. The system includes a blade member including one or more blades, and an external skin-engaging portion in proximity to the ' blade member.  The shaving system may be, for example, a<br><br>
Disposable shaving cartridge adapted for coupling to or uncoupling from a razor handle, or a shaving head which is integral with a razor handle so that the complete razor is discarded as a unit when the blade or blades become dulled. The blade edge cooperates with the skin engaging portion to define shaving geometry.<br>
Significantly, the skin-engaging portion includes a polymeric shaving aid composite including two adjacent exposed length wise-extending portions, each containing a shaving aid. The shaving aid included in each portion may be the same or different. The composite can be, for example, an extruded composite.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a wet shaving system comprising a. blade member and a skin-engaging portion in proximity to said blade member, said skin-engaging portion comprising, prior to first use of he wet shaving system, a solid polymeric shaving aid composite including a first exposed lengthwise extending portion containing a first shaving aid, and an adjacent, second exposed lengthwise extending portion containing a second shaving aid, wherein said first exposed lengthwise-extending portion has a different composition than said second exposed lengthwise-extending portion, and wherein the first and second lengthwise-extending portions together provide a skin-engaging surface.<br>
A shaving aid composite having adjacent, lengthwise-extending portions provides a number of potential design advantages. For example, one portion may contain a larger quantity of water-insoluble resin than the second portion, while the second portion contains a larger quantity of shaving aid than the first portion. The first portion, then, may provide support to the second portion, which in turn may release a significant quantity of shaving aid during shaving without breading down or causing the shaving geometry to change significantly.<br>
Furthermore, the arrangement provides a way to incorporate incompatible shaving aids into the same shaving system. One shaving aid, for examples, may chemically react with another, if they are mixed together. Likewise, a shaving aid, if included in too large a quantity in a composite that also includes another shaving aid, may unfavorably impact the wear characteristics of the composite or, for example, when the other shaving aid is a lubricous water-soluble polymer, to reduce the lubricity provided by the composite. Similarly, one shaving aid may require elevated processing temperatures during an extrusion procedure that would cause a second shaving aid to<br><br>
decompose.      By   including  these  shaving aids   in  different portions   of   the   composite,   the  composite   can   be   coextruded with  different   processing  temperatures   for  each portion.<br>
Moreover,    the   two portions  can provide  a  desirable surface geometry   for  the composite.     For example,   the portions, may be  rounded,   which may provide an enhanced  skin-engaging surface  on  the composite.     Alternatively,   the exposed surface of  one portion may be raised slightly relative  to  the    other   portion,  which may enhance  the  wear characteristics  of  the    one    portion.<br>
The  invention also features  a shaving system that includes  two adjacent exposed lengthwise extending portions, one of which contains  a colorant.     The second portion has   a different   color  than  the first portion;   it  may,   for example, contain no  colorant  or a colorant different  from the colorant  used in   the   first portion.     The colorant  in  the first  portion is   released   (e.g.,  by leaching or by wear) during shaving.     When first used, .the composite preferably has  a  striped appearance caused by the contrast between the two positions.     One or both of the portions may also contain a  shaving  aid.<br>
Other features  and advantages of the  invention will be apparent   from  the description of  the preferred embodiment thereof,   and  from  the  claims.<br>

The replaceable shaving cartridge 10 shown in Fig. 1 is of the type .shown in U.S.S.N. 08/630,437, filed April lo, 1996, which is (assigned to the same assignee as the present application and is hereby incorporated by reference.  It includes housing 16, which carries three blades 18, guard 20, and striped solid, polymeric shaving aid composite 22, which is in the form of an elongated insert member. The shaving aid composite is locked in an opening in the rear of the cartridge and includes a shaving aid that, during shaving is released by the composite to improve shave attributes.  While shown at; the rear portion of this particular shaving cartridge, the shaving aid composite may be located at any skin-engaging portion of the shaving unit and may be fabricated in any size or shape deemed appropriate. For example, the composite can be incorporated into the shaving units described in U.S. Patent No. 4,586,225, which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Referring to Figs. 2 and 3, shaving aid composite 14<br>
includes lengthwise-extending portions 44, 46, and 48 (each in the shape of a rounded lobe), each including a lengthwise-extending exposed surface. Composite 14 also includes connecting portion 49, which connects portions 44 and 48 and also optionally serves to lock the. composite into a mating receiving portion of the cartridge. Portions 44 and 48 and connecting portion 49 have the same compositions and, together, surround all but the exposed face of portion 46.  They can provide support for portion 46.  Portions 44, 46, and 48 each may be, for example, between 1.20 inches and 1.35 inches (more preferably between 1.25 inches and 1,275 inches) in length, and between 0.07 inch and 0.11 inch (more preferably between 0.085 inch and 0,095 inch) in width.<br><br>
Portions 44, 46, and 48 each contains a water' insoluble polymer, optionally in different amounts, and a. shaving aid.  They may contain Che same shaving aid, or different shaving aids.  in one embodiment portions 44 and 48 are identical, and contain the same shaving aid, while portion 46 contains a different shaving and, optionally in combination with the same shaving aid contained in portions 44 and 43.<br>
Each portion also may contain other conventional shaving and composite ingredients, such as low molecular weight water-so liable release enhancing agents such as polyethylene glycol (e.g., 1-10% by weight), water-swellable release enhancing agents such as cross-linked polyacrylics .(e.g., 2-7% by weight), colorants, antioxidahts and preservatives. Water-soluble release enhancing agents are described in U.S. Patent No, 5,113,585, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Water-swellable release-enhancing agents are described in U.S.S.N. 08/121,153, filed September 13, 19!?3, which is assigned to the same assignee as the parent application and is hereby incorporated by reference.  Portions that contain a colorant can be designed to release the colorant, and change color, during shaving, preferably in response to wear of the portion.  A portion may contain, for example, between about: 0.1% and about 5.0% (preferably between about 0.5% and 3%) colorant by weight.<br>
Suitable water-insoluble polymers which can be used include polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, butadiene-styrene copolymer (e.g. medium and high impact polystyrene), polyacetal, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer and blends such as polypropylene/polystyrene blend.<br>
Preferably, each portion includes about 5% to 50%, more preferably about 15 to 40%, and most preferably about 20 to 35% by weight of the water-insoluble polymer. The<br><br><br>
more preferred water-insoluble polymer is polystyrene, preferably a general purpose polystyrene such as BASF 2824 or a high impact, polystyrene (i.e. polystyrene-butadiene), such as Mobil 4324.  The portion should contain a sufficient quantity of water-insoluble polymer to provide adequate mechanical strength, both during production and use.<br>
A shaving aid is a substance that enhances shaving performance  It may, for example, improve shaving comfort (e.g., by lubricating the skin, improve shaving efficiency, condition the beard, or condition the skin.  Examples of shaving aids include lubricous water-soluble polymer such as polyethylene oxide, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyacrylamide, hydroxypropyl cellulose, polyvinyl imidazoline, and polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate; beard hair softeners,- oils such as silicone oil and mineral oil;  substances that enhance the healing or stop the bleeding of the skin; essential, oils such as menthol, eugenol, eucalyptol, safrol, and methyl salicylate,- rinsing aids; non-volatile cooling agents; inclusion complexes of skin-soothing agents with cyclodextrin; fragrances; vitamin E (including common forms of vitamin E such as vitamin E" acetate) ; vitamin A and B-carotene; panthenol and aloe? antipruritic/counterirritant materials; antitnicrobial/keratolytic materials; anti-inflammatory agents; and astringents.<br>
Enough shaving aid should be included to provide the desired benefit.  A portion may contain, for example, about 20% to about 80%, more preferably about 40% to about 75%, by weight of a lubricous water soluble polymer. A portion also may include, for example, about 0.01% to about 5.0%, more preferably about 0,05 to about 1,0%, vitamin E (or common forms of vitamin E) by weight.<br>
The preferred lubricous water-soluble polymer is polyethylene oxide. The more preferred -polyethylene oxides generally are known as POLYOX /available from Union Carbide<br><br>
Corporation) or ALKOX (available from Meisei Chemical Works, Kyoto, Japan).  These polyethylene oxides will preferably have molecular weights of about 100,000 to 6 million, most preferably about 300,000 to 5 million  The most preferred polyethylene oxide comprises a blend of about 40 to 80% of polyethylene oxide having an average molecular weight of about 5 million (e.g. POLYOX COAGULANT) and about 60 to 20% of polyethylene oxide having an average molecular weight of about 300,000 (e.g. POLYOX WSR-N-750). The polyethylene oxide blend may also advantageously contain up to about 10% by weight of a. low molecular weight (i.e., MW
The shaving aid composite may be fabricated by any appropriate method, including injection molding and extrusion, the latter being preferred,<br>
A preferred shaving aid composite is provided below. Portions 44 and 48 (and connecting portion 49) are the same in each example.  One shaving aid composite includes a central blue portion (46), the other a central green portion (46). The colorant in the central portion is released during shaving, generally by the gradual wearing away of that portion during use, thereby indicating through color change that the shaving aid originally contained in the central portion is no longer being delivered.<br>
Because of the rounded lobe geometry, of portions 44, 46, and 48, including the significant recesses at the junctions of portions 44 and 46 and portions 46 and 48, the shaving aid composite may have more surface area available to contact the skin than, for example, a shaving aid. composite having a flat skin-engaging surface. This may provide increased lubrication for the skin and may reduce the time it takes for portion 46 to wear away. The raised<br><br>
elevation of the exposed surface of portion 46 relative to the exposed surface of portions 44 and 48 also may enhance the rate of wear of portion. 46.<br>
In the chare,   the components used in the shaving aid composites are provided in the first column on the left. The quantities of each component in portions 44  and 48 and connecting portion 49 are provided in the second column. The third and fourth columns provide ranges for the quantities of  components that are used in the shaving aid composite including a central blue portion  (46) .    The fifth and.sixth columns provide ranges for the quantities of components  that  are used in the shaving aid composite including a central green portion  (46) .(Table Removed)<br><br>

The shaving aid composites can be prepared by conventional coextrusion or molding methods known to those skilled in the art. For example, the components of the composite may be supplied by two separate melting/pumpinq (plastics extruders), each consisting of a heated barrel, a pumping screw, a motor drive for that screw and a control system for the entire system. The materials of the<br><br>
composite are fed in powder form into their respective extruders (e.g., single screw type manufactured by Davis; Standard) .  The extruders can operate at the same or different speeds, and the same or different temperatures. The barrel temperature for each extruder can be ramped in three zones from 325°F to 375°F; a fourth heater at the die/barrel connection can also be set to 375°F, and a fifth heater at the die can , range from 375 oF to 400°F. Via rugged weldments the molten streams of the component8 are brought together to form the composite. Portion 46 can be precisely located on a portion (combination 44, 48, and 49} through accurately machined pathways in the die head. Because they have different compositions, the two molten materials are brought together at the last possible moment before exiting the die.  Both materials exit the: die head in a size and shape approximating that of the final product. The final dimensions are achieved using a series of forming rollers as the extrudate is cooled.  The composite is typicality extruded at a rate of 50 feet per minute.<br>
The combined molten materials are drawn from the die head into the &amp; zing /cooling device at a constant speed such that its cross section is always constant. Under a bath of cool dry air the molten material is cooled until no longer pliable.  Once cooled, the composite can be cut to the appropriate length and attached to a razor cartridge.<br>
Other examples of shaving aid composites may include the same composition for portions 44, 48, and connecting portion 49, and a central portion (46) that contains about 90% of the composition used for portions 44 and 46, plus the following;<br>
Example A -- l% blue pigment and 10%. Aloe.<br>
Example B -- 1% blue pigment and 10% Menthol.<br>
Example C -- 10% Frescolat (a menthol analcg) .<br>
Example D -- 10% Mineral Oil/vit. E.<br><br>
Example E -- 10% Silicone fluid 1401.<br>
Example P .-- 5% Vit. E and 5% Panthenol.<br>
Example G -- 10% Triclosan DP300 (an antinicrobial),<br>
In other examples, portions 44 and 48 have the composition described above.  The central portion contained Che following percentages of the composition used in portions 44 and 48 (% Comp.), plus additional ingredients, as follows:<br>
Example H -- 95% Comp. and 5% Tricloean DP300.<br>
Example I -- 9.3% Comp, and 6% Menthol and 1% .Silicons copolymer.<br>
Example J -- 94% Comp. and 6% Menthol.<br>
Example K -- 65% Comp. and 10% polyethylene oxide (60:40 Polyox blend previously used in portion 44) and S% Salsorb.<br>
In another example, central portion 46 may be composed of 80% Polyox (60:40 Polyox blend previously used in portion 44) and 20% nylon 12.<br>
In another example, central portion 46 may contain the following ingredients:<br>
Example L - 80% Polyox (60:40 Polyox blend previously used in portion 44) and 14% polystyrene and 3% PEG 100 and 3% PVA.<br>
Example M -- 70% amorphous nylon (Zytel 330) and 30% Polyox (60/40).<br>
Example N -- 77.75% Polyox (60:40 Polyox blend previously used, in portion 44) and 10% PEG 100 and 0.25% Irganox and 2% green pigment and 10% Vit. E.<br>
