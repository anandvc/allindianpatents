				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> <br><br>
The present invention relates to a polymer blend containing at least 85% by weight of ethylene/a-olefin copolymers (A) prepared by metallocene catalysis and from 1 to 15% by weight of essentially linear ethylene/a-olefm copolymers (B) prepared using another catalyst, the percentages in each case being based on the total weight of the polymer blend.<br>
The present invention furthermore relates to the use of these polymer blends for the production of films and to films which contain these polymer blends.<br>
Ethylene/a-olefin copolymers which are prepared by metallocene catalysis have some advantageous properties compared with copolymers prepared by means of conventional catalyst systems. Thus, the metallocene copolymers are often superior in their mechanical properties, such as toughness, compared with copolymers of similar composition prepared by a different method. The excellent mechanical properties make metallocene copolymers appear particularly suitable for the production of films. Especially for the production of films, high requirements are also set with regard to the optical properties of the polymers used. In the case of pure metallocene copolymers, as well as in conventionally prepared LLDPE, a slight haze and insufficient gloss are often evident.<br>
In order to improve the optical properties of LLDPE copolymers, these copolymers are mixed with other polymers. US-A-4 587 303 describes a polymer blend comprising LLDPE and LDPE or ethylene copolymers obtained by high-pressure free radical polymerization processes. These high-pressure polymers are distinguished by long-chain branches, giving rise to, inter alia, their low density. WO 95/27005 describes a polymer blend of LLDPE, which was prepared by metallocene catalysis, and low density polyethylene. It is true that the stated polymer blends have improved optical properties compared with pure metallocene copolymers. However, this improvement is accompanied by a dramatic deterioration in the mechanical properties.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide polymer blends which are based on ethylene/a-olefin copolymers prepared by metallocene catalysis and which, on the one hand, have   better   optical   properties   than   pure   metallocene   copolymers   and,   on  the<br><br>
other hand, exhibit good mechanical properties.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the polymer blends stated at the outset, their use for the production of films, and films which contain these polymer blends.<br>
Suitable copolymers (A) are in principle all ethylene/a-olefin copolymers prepared by metallocene catalysis.<br>
The polymerization can be carried out, for example, in the gas phase, in suspension, in solution or in the high-pressure process, the catalyst system used in the suspension or gas-phase process preferably being one which contains<br>
a)	an inorganic or organic carrier,<br>

c)	a compound forming metallocenium ions.<br>
Preferably used carrier materials a) are finely divided carriers which preferably have a particle diameter of from 1 to 300 µm,   in particular from 30 to 70 µm.   Suitable inorganic carriers are, for example, magnesium chloride or silica gels, preferably those of the formula Si02 • a AI2O3, where a is from 0 to 2, preferably from 0 to 0.5; these are therefore aluminosilicates or silica. Such products are commercially available, for example Silica Gel 332 from Grace. Suitable organic carriers are, for example, finely divided polyolefins, for example finely divided polypropylene.<br>

The preparation of these oligomeric aluminoxane compounds is usually carried out by reacting a solution of a trialkylaluminum with water and is described, inter alia, in EP-A 284 708 and US-A 4,794,096.<br>
As a rule, the oligomeric aluminoxane compounds obtained are in the form of mixtures of both linear and cyclic chain molecules of different lengths, so that m is to be regarded as an average value.

Furthermore, aryloxyaluminoxanes, as described in US-A 5,391,793, aminoaluminoxanes, as described in US-A 5,371,260, aminoaluminoxane hydrochlorides, as described in EP-A 633 264, silyloxyaluminoxanes, as described in EP-A 621 279, or mixtures thereof may be used as compounds forming metallocenium ions.<br>
The copolymers A) which can preferably be prepared by means of the stated catalyst systems preferably contain from 97 to 75% by weight of ethylene units and from 3 to 25% by weight of C3-C20-0-Olefin units, based in each case on the total weight of the component A). Particularly preferably, these copolymers contain from 97 to 85% by weight of ethylene units and from 3 to 15% by weight of C3-C20-a-olefin units.<br>
Suitable C3-C20"Ci"Olef ins which serve as comonomers of these copolymers are all linear or branched a-isomers of propene,   butene, pentene, hexene, heptene, octene, nonene, decene, undecene, dodecene, tridecene, tetradecene, pentadecene, hexadecene, heptadecene, octadecene, nonadecene and eicosene. Preferred Cs-Cao'Cfolefin comonomers are those selected from the<br><br>
group consisting of butene, pentene, hexene, 4-methylpentene and octene, particularly preferably butene, pentene and hexene.<br>
Particularly preferred copolymers (A) are ethylene/butene copolymers having a butene content of 4 - 8% by weight and ethylene/hexene copolymers having a hexene content of 4 - 8% by weight, based in each case on the total weight of thee copolymers.<br>
Other preferred copolymers (A) are those which have a molecular weight distribution M„/Mn 
Furthermore, copolymers (A) having a density of 0.91 - 0.925 and an HLMI (High Load Meltflow Index) of 10 - 40 g/10 min are particularly advantageous for use in films.<br>
Suitable copolymers (B) are all essentially linear ethylene/a-olefin copolymers as prepared using other catalysts, ie. non-metallocene catalysts.<br>
Particular examples are medium density ethylene copolymers (MDPE) having a density of from 0.930 to 0.940, in particular those MDPE copolymers prepared by means of chromium catalysts. Such chromium catalysts, also referred to as Phillips catalysts, are generally known (cf. for example M.P. McDaniel, Adv. Cat il, (1985) 47 - 98 and US-A- 5 363 915). These copolymers may contain the abovementioned C3-C2o-a-olefins as comonomers, here too hexene and butene being preferred, in particular hexene.<br>
The MDPE copolymers preferably have an HLMI of 2 - 100, particularly preferably 10 - 30 g/10 min.<br>
Other examples of copolymers (B) are LLDPE copolymers having a density of from 0.915 to 0.929, in particular those prepared using a Ziegler catalyst. Conventional catalysts of this type are described, for example, in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Vol. A 21, 4th edition 1992, page 502 et seq. Catalysts as described in, for example, US-A-4857613 and DE-A-19 529 240 should be mentioned in particular here.<br>
The LLDPE copolymers obtainable by means of Ziegler catalysis can be prepared by all conventional polymerization processes, solution processes and gas-phase processes being particularly preferred, in particular gas-phase fluidized-bed processes. These copolymers in turn may contain the abovementioned a-olefins.<br><br>
preferably butene, hexene or octene, as comonomers.<br>
In addition to the copolymers (A) and (B), the novel polymer blends may contain further additives, such as light stabilizers and stabilizers against the effects of weathering, processing assistants and, if desired, dyes. The type and amount of these additives are familiar to a person skilled in the art.<br>
The novel polymer blends contain the copolymer component (B) in a concentration of 1 - 15, preferably 2-10, % by weight, based on the total weight of the polymer blend.<br>
The copolymer components (A) and (B) can be mixed by any known mixing method. Usually, the polymer components in the form of coarse powder, if desired together with further additives, are mixed in a twin-screw extruder (ZSK) in the desired ratios and processed to give granules. These granules can then be processed to films, for example in blown film units.<br>
The novel polymer blends are very suitable for the production of films, in particular for the packaging sector and especially for the packaging of foods. The films obtained are distinguished by transparency, gloss and good mechanical properties, in particular by high tensile strength. They have little tendency to block and are therefore convenient to process. The Examples which follow illustrate the invention.<br>
