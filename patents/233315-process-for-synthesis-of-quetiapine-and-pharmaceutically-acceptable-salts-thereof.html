SALTS THEREOF<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
The present application claims the benefît of the February 22, 2003 filing date of United States Provisional Patent Application 60/448,934.<br>
FPELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The prcsent invention relates to synthesis of quetiapine and pharmaceuticaHy acceptable salts thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The structure of quetiapine, 2-(2-(4-dibenzo[&amp;t/][l,4Jthiazepm-ll-yl-l-piperazinyl)ethoxy)ethano], is shown below (I).<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Quetiapine is a psychoactive organic compound that is an antagonist for multiple neurotransmitter receptors in the brain. Merck Index, 13th Ed., 8130 (2001). Quetiapine is an anu'psychotic agent useful for treating, among other things, schizophreriia. Quetiapine can be made, for example, as taught in United States Patent 4,879,288, iiicorporated in its entirety herein by reference.<br>
As taught ui the '288 patent, quetiapine can be made m reaction of 11-piperazinyl dibenzo[Z),/]-[l,4]tliiazepiiiehydrochloride and 2-(2-chloroethoxy)ethanol in a<br>
solvent. Reaction times are long (e.g. 24 hours). Also, starting materials such as the 11-piperazinyl dibenzofA/j-fl^Jthiazepine are undesired in the product and can be difficult to remove from the product.<br>
There is a need for an improved process for making quetiapine from 11-piperazinyl diben2o[Z&gt;jQ-[l,4]thiazepine allowing shorter reaction tirnes and affording a quetiapine product that contains a lower level of impurities (such as the unreacted starting material).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one aspect, the present method relates to a process for making quetiapine comprising the step of reacting 11-piperazinyl dibeiizo[&amp;t/]-[l,4]thiazepine hydrochloride and 2-(2-chloroethoxy)ethanol in a solvent, especially n-butanol, toluene, or dimethyl formamide, in the presence of a base, especially an inorganic base, most especially sodium carbonate, a phase transfer catalyst, especially tetrabutylammonium bromide, and, optionally, an alkali metal halide, especially sodium iodide.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention relates to quetiapine made by the foregoing process.<br>
In yet another aspect, the present invention relates to a process for making quetiapine heminimarate including the steps of: reacting 11-piperazinyl dibenzo[6,/]-[l,4]thiazepine hydrochloride and 2-(2-chIoroethoxy)ethanol in a solvent, especially «-butanol, toluene, or dimethyl formamide, in the preseuce of a base, especially an inorganic base, most especially sodium carbonate, a phase transfer catalyst, especially tetrabutyammonium biomide, and, optionally, an alkali metal halide, especially sodium iodide, whereby a fîrst slurry is obtained; separating the solid from the fîrst slurry, whereby a liquid filtrate is obtained; combining the liquid filtrate with fumărie acid, whereby a second slurry is obtained; and isolating quetiapine hemifumarate from the second slurry. In this aspect, the present invention also relates to recrystallizion of the quetiapine heminimarate so obtained from a solvent, that is a lower alkanol, especially ethanol, or amixture of water and a dipolar aprotic solvent, especially dimethyl formamide.<br>
In still a further aspect, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition, and dosage forms thereof, including at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient and quetiapine hemijfumarate made by the foregoing described<br>
process in any of its embodiments.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a process of making quetiapine - 11-[4-[2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)ethyl]-l-piperazin.yl]dibenzo[6,_/]-[l,4]tbiazepine - in shorter time and with lower amounts of dif5cult-to-remove residual 11-piperazinyl dibenzo[6,/|-[l,4]thiazepine than hîtherto reaHzable with the methods of the prior art. The process of the present invention is readily adapted to encompass the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of quetiapine, especially quetiapine hemifumarate.<br>
As used herein, slurry refers to undissolved particles in a liquid.<br>
The process of the present invention includes the step of reacting, in a suitable vessel, preferably with agitation (e.g. stirring), 11-piperazinyl dibenzo[&amp;/)]-[l,4]thiazepiue with 2-(2-chloroethoxy)ethanol in a solvent in the presence of a base, a phase transfer catalyst, and, optionally, an alkali metal halide. The reacting is preferably at a temperature greater than about 100°C, especially at reflux. The skilled artisan understands that reference to 11-piperazinyl dibenzo[&amp;3-[l,4]thiazepine hydrochloride refers to the well-know dihydrochloride referred as such to in the prior art.<br>
Phase transfer catalysts are an important aspect of the present invention and are well known to one skilled in the art of organic synthesis. Phase transfer catalysts are of particular utility when at least fîrst and second compounds to be reacted with each other have such dififerent solubility characteristics that there is no practicai common solvent for them and, accordingly, combining a solvent for one of them with a solvent for the other of them results in a two-phase system. The phase transfer catalysts useful in the practice of the present invention are of the same type and used in the same manner and amounts as the phase transfer catalysts well known in the art. Examples of phase transfer catalysts useful in the practice opf the present invention include tetrabutylammonium bromide, triethylbenzylammoniurn chloride, and tricetylmethylammonium chloride (Aliquot® 336). Tetrabutylammonium bromide is a preferred phase transfer catalyst in the practice of the method of the present invention.<br>
The solvents useful in the practice of the present invention include the lower alkanols, aromatic hydrocarbons, and the so-called dipolar aprotic solvents. Preferably, the solvent has a boiling point at normal atmospheric pressure of about 100° C or higher.<br>
Lower alkanols are linear or branched aliphatic alcohols of general formula CnH2n+iOH, where n is l to about 6. Normal butanol (n = 4) is aparticularlypreferred lower alkanol for use in the practice of the present invention in certain of its embodiments.<br>
Aromatic hydrocarbons useful as solvents in this and other embodiments of the present invention are normally liquids at room temperature (about 20° to about 27°C) and have the general formula CnHn&gt; but can be substituted with one or more linear or branched C i - Q alkyl groups; or other groups that do not interfere with the reaction. Toluene (n = 6, methyl substituent) and xylene are particularly preferred aromatic hydrocarbons for use in the practice of the present invention.<br>
The so-called dipolar aprotic solvent are well known as such in the art. Such solvents have a permanent dipole, but no readily removeable hydrogen atoms. Examples of well-known dipolar aprotic solvents include dimethyl formamide (DMF), dimethyl acetamide (DMAC), dimethy sulfoxide (DMSO), N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) and the like. Dimethyl formamide is a preferred dipolar aprotic solvent for use in the practice of the present invention in its several embodiments.<br>
The solvent used can also be a mixture of one or more of the same or different classes (types) of solvent described above.<br>
The base used in the practice of the present invention can be an inorganic base. Inorganic bases are inorganic compounds that are capable of reacting with and neutralizing an acid, especially a Brenstead acid. Examples of inorganic bases include alkali metal and alkalme earth metal oxides, hydroxides, bicarbonates, and carbonates. Alkali metal carbonates, especially sodium carbonate, are preferred inorganic bases for use in the practice of the present invention.<br>
When an opţional alkali metal halide is used, sodium iodide is the preferred alkali metal halide.<br>
11-Piperazinyl dibenzo[b,fj-[l,4]tliia2:epmehydrochloride , 2-(2-chloroethoxy)ethanol, solvent, base, alkali metal halide, and phase transfer catalyst are<br>
combined, in any order, in a suitable reaction vessel that is preferably equipped with an agitator.<br>
The relative molar amounts of the materials combined are not criticai. Typicaily, the mo Iar amount of chloroethoxy ethanol will be l to 2 times the molar amount of the thiazepine hydrochloride; the molar amount of base will be 4 to 8 times the molar amount of the thiazepine hydrochloride; and the amount of alkali metal iodide will be a fraction of the molar amount of thiazepine hydrochloride. The phase transfer catalyst is used in an amount of about 0.1% to about 0.7% on a weight basis.   Typically, the reaction mixture will initially be about 0.5M to 1.5M in the thiazepine hydrochloride, but higher or lower concentrations can be used whilst realizing the benefits of the present invention.<br>
The contents of the reaction vessel are preferably protected from excessive atmospheric water by providing a pad of dry inert gas over the reaction mixture, or by isolating the interior of the reaction vessel from the environment through a desiccant (e.g. molecular sieves, CaCla, or the like). The contents of the reaction vessel are heated to a reaction temperature of from about 80°C to about 100°C or higher, preferably to the reflux temperature. The reaction mixture is held at .the reaction temperature for a reaction time of about 12 to about 24 hours. Typically, a reaction time of about 17 hours is sufficient.  At the end of the reaction time, the reaction is a soh'd/liquid slurry.<br>
The two-phase (s/l) reaction mixture is cooled and the solid phase separated by a suitable means whereby a liquid filtrate containing the product (quetiapine base) is obtamed. The separation can be by any means known in the art, for example filtration (gravity or suction) or centrifugation - decanting, to mention just two.<br>
The product quetiapine base can be isolated from the filtrate by any means known in the art, for example distillation / evaporation of the solvent, preferably at reduced pressure (
Pharmacutically acceptable acid addition salts are salts obtainable from quetiapine base by qutemarization of at least one amine functionality in the product; can be readily processed to the desired dosage form; and are nontoxic at the dosages used. The isolated quetiapine can be converted to apharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt by dissolving it in a salinization solvent and combining the solution so obtained with the desired acid, for example fumărie acid. Typically, the acid addition salt will precipitate from the solvent upon cooling (if not before) and can be isolated by any means known in<br>
the art, for example fîltration (gravity or suction) or centrifugation - decanting, to mention just two. Salinization solvents useful in the practice of the present invention include water, alcohols (e.g. methanol, butanol), esters (e.g. ethyl or butyl acetate), ketones (e.g. acetone), DMF, DMSO, or mixtures of solvents like DMSO/chlorofonn, DMF/water, or NMP/acetonitrile.<br>
hi another and preferred embodiment, the quetiapine product is converted to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt, preferably the hemifumarate, without being isolated from the fîrst filtrate, hi this erabodiment, fîrst liquid filtrate is obtained as above and combined with the desired axnount of acid, e.g. fumărie acid. The resulting combination is optionally heated to about 100° C and thereafter cooled, whereby a second slurry, containing solid acid addition salt, is obtained. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt is isolated from the second slurry by any means known in the art, for example filtration (gravity or suction) or centrifugation - decanting, to mention just two. Jf desired, the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt can be recrystallized using, for example, any of the salinization solvents mentioned above. hi particular, the crude quetiapine hemifumarate can be advantageously recrystallized from a solvent that is a lower alkanol, preferabiy ethanol, or a mixture of water and a dipolar aprotic solvent, preferably dimethyl formamide.<br>
Quetiapine or, preferably, an acid addition salt thereof, most preferably quetapine hemiftimarate, obtained by the process of the present invention can be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions, preferably in a dosage form suitable for oral or parenteral adrninistration by methods known hi the art.<br>

Exampiell<br>
A. Preparatioa of crude QTP hemifumarate<br>
A 100 liter reactor equipped with mechanical stirrer, condenser, and thermometer, was charged with n-BuOH (40.5 L), 11-piperazinyl âibenzo[bj][l,4] thiazepinehydrochloride (15 kg), Na2CO3 (7.5 kg), TBAB (l .5kg) and 2-(2-chloroeihoxy)ethanol (5.25 L). The mixture was heated to 115°C during whic time a portion of the n-BuOH and water distilled out. The distillation was continued until all of the theoretical amount of water was distilled out and the vapor temperature dropped. The reaction mixture was stirred at a rate of 120 rpm. The temperature was maintained for 26.5 hours until completion of the reaction. The reaction mixture was cooled to 25°C during 3 hours. The mixture was filtered on a filter press. The f Urate was filtered into another 160 liter reactor (5ji and l p, fîlters), equipped with mechanical stirrer, condenser, and thermometer. To the filtrate, 2.24 kg of fumărie acid was added, The resulting mixture was heated to 100°C over 2 hours and then cooled to 5°C over 2 hours. The mixture was maintained at this temperature, with stining, for an additional one hour. The resulting slurry was separated on a centrifuge and washed with n-BuOH (SOL) and ethanol absolute (SOL) to obtain 16.7 kg of wet, crude quetiapine fumarate.<br>
B. Recrystallization of crude QTP bemifamarate from ethanol.<br>
A 100 liter reactor equipped with mechanical stirrer, condenser, and thermometer, was charged with the wet material obtained as above (5.9 kg) and with ethanol absolute (80 L). The mixture was then heated to reflux (80°C) and stirred at a rate of 120 rpm. The heating was continued for 2 hours. A clear solution was obtained. The clear solution was filtered through a-5,3,0,2-micron fîler. The filtrate was then transferred to a preheated 160 liter reactor equipped with mechanical stirrer, condenser, and thermometer.<br>
The clear solution was reheated to reflux (80°C) and stirred at a rjate of 120 rpm. The heating was continued for l hour until a clear solution was obtained. The clear solution was cooled to 10°C duririg 12 hours and maintained at this tetnperature for another 5 hours. The resulting slurry was separated on a centrifuge and washed with ethanol absolute (10L) to obtam 4.3 kg of wet quetiapirie fumarate cryst.<br>
A portion of the wet material was pecked into a stirred drier and dried at 65°C, 60mmHg at a rate of 12 rpm for 5 hours.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
