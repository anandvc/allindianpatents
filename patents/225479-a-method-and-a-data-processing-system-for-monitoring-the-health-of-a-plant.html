				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a methods and data processing systems for monitoring<br>
the health of a system. The methods and data processing systems of the<br>
invention are particularly, although not necessarily exclusively, suitable for<br>
monitoring the health of power plant, including for example gas turbine, spark<br>
ignition and compression ignition internal combustion engines.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The health of the system can be considered a measure of the condition of a<br>
system against expected norms. A health system is one whose condition closely<br>
matches expectations, whereas an unhealthy system is one whose condition<br>
differs from what would be expected, indicating for example deterioration of, or<br>
a possible problem with the system. The ability to monitor the health of a system<br>
can therefore allow such deterioration and/or problems to be detected and, if<br>
necessary, addressed at an early stage.<br>
For example, US-5684718 describes a non-real time system for monitoring the<br>
operation of an electric generator in which vibration and load data are combined<br>
to produce a single which is then compared with stored data representative of<br>
maximum acceptance combinations of the two parameters. Essentially the<br>
system is an automated Nook up table' which issues warnings when vibrations<br>
have exceed acceptable limits.<br>
In order to determine the condition, and consequently health, of a system, it is<br>
normal to monitor and analyse a series of measurable indicators which<br>
themselves reflect performance parameters such as turbine and compressor<br>
operating temperature and pressures and spool speeds. To obtain a fuller overall<br>
picture of the engine's condition, these performance parameters can be<br>
supplemented with further condition indicators including, for example, vibration<br>
measurements and measurements of the particulate material entrained in the<br>
circulating oil.<br>
Particularly with complex mechanical systems such as gas turbines, the number<br>
of indicators that must be monitoring to obtain a useful overall picture of the<br>
system's condition can be high. This in turn means that the task of analysing the<br>
complete series of indicators to determine the health of the engine is a complex<br>
one, typically requiring a skilled expert to analyse the data off-line.<br>
Taking again the example of a gas turbine, it is known for example to collect<br>
performance and vibration data from the engine over time to be analysed off-line<br>
by one or more experts. Typically the performance data will be compared with<br>
simulated data for the same engine and, based on this comparison, an expert<br>
will from a view as to the health of the engine. Additionally, a small amount of<br>
vibration data will be reviewed. Giving a superficial view of gross changes in<br>
engine behaviour. If a problem is detected, the vibration data may then be<br>
analysed in more detail, often by another expert, to look for any abnormal<br>
indications which might be symptomatic of underlying mechanical problems<br>
which could lead to a loss of health and operability.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is a general aim of the present invention to provide methods and data<br>
processing systems that facilitate the acquisition and analysis of condition<br>
indicators in a manner such that the overall health of a system can be more<br>
readily assessed.<br>
Accordingly, in general terms a first aspect of the invention provides a method<br>
for monitoring the health of a system, comprising:<br>
constructing a condition signature from a plurality of measured condition<br>
indicators acquired from the system;<br>
comparing the condition signature with a normal signature, corresponding to the<br>
signature for a healthy system; and<br>
registering an event if the condition signature differs from the normal signature<br>
by more than a predetermined threshold.<br>
The term 'signature', as used herein, pertain to the values of a plurality of<br>
condition indicators merged or fused into a unit or quality such as a set, vector<br>
or scalar. In the example of a vector signature, the indicators may correspond to<br>
respective elements of the vector. In the example of a scalar signature, the<br>
magnitude of the scalar may be determined by a mathematical function which<br>
acts upon the indicator values.<br>
By merging or fusing the condition indicators into a single signature in this<br>
manner, and providing a normal signature with which the fused data can be<br>
compared, the task of assessing the health of a system is greatly simplified. In<br>
particular, since the detection of an event amounts to an indication of a potential<br>
problem or an unhealthy system (i.e. a system condition that differs from what<br>
would normally be expected), the monitoring of the health can be largely<br>
automated, removing, or at least minimizing, the requirement for expert input<br>
during the monitoring process. This in turn means that it becomes feasible to<br>
continuously monitor the health of a system, and to provide useful information<br>
about the health of the system in real time during operation.<br>
Preferably the condition indicators that are combined to form the system<br>
condition signature include operational parameters, which in the case of a<br>
mechanical system may be speeds, pressure (e.g. gas pressures, oil pressures)<br>
and temperature for example. Other useful parameters may include what might<br>
be conventionally thought of as control or status parameters. For convenience,<br>
such parameters will be referred to using the single label of 'performance<br>
parameters' in the following text.<br>
Additionally, to obtain a fuller picture of a mechanical system's heath, it is<br>
particularly preferred that the signature includes one or more condition indicators<br>
related to the vibration of the system.<br>
Put, more generally, the condition indicators from which the system condition<br>
signature is constructed may be derived from two or more disparate sources of<br>
data. This illustrates a particular strength of this approach in that a great variety<br>
of different forms of condition indicator data can be encompassed in the system<br>
condition signature, providing a more comprehensive measure of the system's<br>
health than has previously been possible without multiple analyses.<br>
Preferably at least three condition indicators are used to contrast the condition<br>
signature. More preferably at least 10 and even more preferably at least 20<br>
condition indicators are used to contrast the condition signature.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the system comprises a gas turbine engine.<br>
The normal signature for the system can be derived from a predefined model of<br>
the system that is being monitored. This model can itself be developed off-line<br>
and then fixed for the duration of the operation of the health monitoring method.<br>
More preferably, however, the model is designed to be refined as the method<br>
proceeds in order that it might be better tuned to a specific system.<br>
Whichever approach is adopted, it is particularly preferred that the model is a<br>
'learnt model' developed using a data-driven, or at least partially data-driven<br>
approach. That is to say the learnt model learns from training data comprising<br>
series of the condition indicators which have been labeled as normal (i.e.<br>
healthy) or abnormal (i.e. unhealthy) as the case may be. In fact, it is often the<br>
case that normal data is far more readily available than abnormal data and<br>
therefore the training data may only include examples of normal data. This still<br>
results in an effective model, because subsequent events can then be identified<br>
as departures from the learnt model of normality.<br>
The normal signature for the healthy system may be predicted from a model<br>
defining one or more inter-dependencies between the condition indicators. This<br>
enables the model to specify a continuous boundary in N-dimensional space<br>
(where each dimension relates to one of N condition indicators) corresponding to<br>
the limits of healthy system operation. This is in contrast to Nook up table'<br>
approaches for setting the limits of healthy system operation which we do not<br>
capture the (often complex) inter-relationships and correlations between<br>
condition indicators.<br>
So, for example, it is often the case that the onset of a problem or failure in a<br>
particular system manifests itself in small changes to a number of condition<br>
indicators which individually, however, remain in their respective allowable<br>
ranges. The 'look up table' approach, which is only able to sense gross shifts in<br>
individual parameters, would fail recognize that a problem or failure had<br>
occurred. In contrast, when the condition signature for the healthy system is<br>
predicted from a model defining one or more-inter-dependencies between the<br>
condition indicators the several small changes in the condition indicators may<br>
have the cumulative effect of driving the condition signature outside normal<br>
boundary in N-dimensional space.<br>
Preferably, the predetermined threshold corresponds to a statistically significant<br>
departure or variance from normally as defined by the normal signature. Thus, in<br>
the example of a normal signature provided by a learnt model, further<br>
development of the model (e.g. due to the input of more training data) will result<br>
in a corresponding variation in the predetermined threshold.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention providers a method for monitoring the health<br>
of a system, which comprises performing at each of a plurality of times the steps<br>
of:<br>
constructing a condition signature from a plurality of condition indicators<br>
including (a) a plurality of vibration measurement acquired from the system or<br>
(b) one or more vibration measurements and one or more performance<br>
parameter measurements acquired from the system;<br>
predicting a normal signature from a model defining one or more inter-<br>
dependencies between said condition indicators, the normal signature<br>
corresponding to the condition signature for a healthy system;<br>
comparing the condition signature with the normal signature; and<br>
registering an event if the condition signature differs from the normal signature<br>
by more than a predetermined threshold.<br>
The model may comprise a matrix (e.g. a covariance matrix) with one or more<br>
non-zero off-diagonal terms to define the inter-dependencies. The step of<br>
comparing the condition signature with the normal signature may then involve<br>
calculating a value for the normalized innovations squared (NIS) which is defined<br>
below in the 'Description of the Embodiments'.<br>
Alternatively, the model may comprise a neural network. If there are N condition<br>
indicators, one embodiment is a neural network which is trained to predict the<br>
value of the Nth from the other N-1 indicators. The step of comparing the<br>
condition signature with the normal signature may then involve calculating a<br>
prediction error which is e.g. the square of the difference between the predicted<br>
value for N and the actual value. There may be N of these predictive networks<br>
operating in parallel for each of the condition indicators. In this case the total<br>
prediction error can be the sum of the prediction errors of each of the networks.<br>
In another embodiment, a neural network is trained to predict a subset of Nl<br>
condition indicators (such as vibration values, e.g. at a number of key<br>
frequencies) from another subset of N2 condition indicators (such as the<br>
performance parameters), where Nl + N2 = N<br>
Preferably the times define successive intervals of at most 1 sec duration (i.e. a 1<br>
Hz repetition frequency). More preferably the times define successive intervals of<br>
at most 0.2 sec duration (a 5 Hz repetition frequency), even more preferably at<br>
most 0.1 sec (a 10 Hz repetition frequency). By acquiring and processing the<br>
condition indicator data at such rates, it is possible for the method to monitor the<br>
health of the system in real time. Therefore, if an abnormal event is registered at<br>
any time, immediate and appropriate action can be taken by the system<br>
operator. This can be particularly advantageous for the operation of safety<br>
critical plant such as aero gas turbine engines.<br>
The data acquisition rate can, however, be significantly faster than the<br>
processing rate. For example the data acquisition rate may be in the range 20 Hz<br>
to 80 kHz. Only a subset of the acquired data may then be processed.<br>
Thus in another embodiment, the invention provides a method for monitoring<br>
the health of a system, which comprises performing at each of a plurality of<br>
times defining successive intervals of at most 1 sec duration the steps of:<br>
constructing a condition signature from a plurality of condition indicators<br>
including (a) a plurality of vibration measurements acquired from the system or<br>
(b) one or more vibration measurements and one or more performance<br>
parameter measurements acquired from the system;<br>
predicting a normal signature corresponding to the condition signature for a<br>
healthy system;<br>
comparing the condition signature with the normal signature; and<br>
registering an event if the condition signature differs from the normal signature<br>
by more than a predetermined threshold.<br>
where the condition signature is comprised of data from disparate sources, for<br>
instance performance and vibration data, a problem occurs in that the data may<br>
well not be synchronized in time. If this asynchronous data is combined to form<br>
the signature, a distorted picture of the system's health may well result. For<br>
similar reasons, training data used to develop a model of normal system<br>
behaviour should also be synchronized if distortions in the model are to be<br>
avoided.<br>
Thus preferably, the condition indicators are synchronously acquired from the<br>
system to a synchronization imprecision of at most 1 sec. More preferably the<br>
synchronization imprecision is at most 0.1, 0.075, 0.0625 or 0.02 sec. By<br>
'synchronisation imprecision' we mean the maximum difference between the<br>
acquisition times of each pair of condition indicators forming a particular<br>
condition signature. Desirably, the measurements are acquired from the system<br>
at a synchronization imprecision which is less than the duration of the successive<br>
time intervals, e.g. if the time intervals are of 0.2 sec duration, the<br>
synchronization imprecision may be at most 0.075 sec.<br>
The invention also provide a data processing system for monitoring the health of<br>
a system suitable for performing the method outlined above. In general terms<br>
the data processing system comprises:<br>
data acquisition means for acquiring a plurality of measured condition indicators<br>
from the system;<br>
processor means for constructing a system condition signature from said plurality<br>
of measured condition indicators;<br>
comparator means for comparing the system condition signature with a<br>
predefined normal signature, corresponding to the signature for a healthy<br>
system; and<br>
means for registering an event if the comparator indicators signature differs from<br>
the normal signature by more than a predetermined threshold.<br>
The data processing system may further comprises a display means for<br>
displaying (a) one or more of the condition indicators, (b) the result of the<br>
comparison of the system condition signature with the normal signature and/or<br>
(c) an alert signal when the comparator indicates that the predetermined<br>
threshold has been transgressed (i.e. an event has been registered).<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides a data processing system for<br>
monitoring the health of a system, comprising:<br>
data acquisition means for acquiring a plurality of condition indicators from the<br>
system at each of a plurality of times, the condition indicators including (a) a<br>
plurality of vibration measurements or (b) one or more vibration measurement<br>
and one or more performance parameters;<br>
processor means for constructing a condition signature from said condition<br>
indicators and for predicting a normal signature corresponding to the condition<br>
signature for a healthy system, the normal signature being predicted by a model<br>
which defines one or more inter-dependencies between said condition indicators;<br>
comparator means for comparing the condition signature with the normal<br>
signature; and<br>
registration means for registering an event if the comparator indicates that the<br>
condition signature differs from the normal signature by more than a<br>
predetermined threshold.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention provides a data processing system for<br>
monitoring the health of a system, comprising:<br>
data acquisition means for acquiring a plurality of condition indicators from the<br>
system at each of a plurality of times defining successive intervals of at most 1<br>
sec duration, the condition indicators including (a) a plaurality of vibration<br>
measurements or (b) one or more vibration measurement and one or more<br>
performance parameter measurements;<br>
processor means for condition signature from said condition indicators and for<br>
predicting a normal signature corresponding to the condition signature for a<br>
healthy system;<br>
comparator means for comparing the condition signature with the normal<br>
signature; and<br>
registration means for registering an event if the comparator indicates that the<br>
condition signature differs from the normal signature by more than a<br>
predetermined threshold.<br>
A further aspect of the invention addressed the problem of the synchronous<br>
acquisition of the condition indicators. The invention proposes to associate time<br>
stamps (based on a common clock) with the acquired data and to synchronise<br>
the data on the basis of these time stamps.<br>
Accordingly, in this aspect, the invention provides a method of sychronising two<br>
or more data streams, each data stream comprising a series of sequentially<br>
acquired data elements (and relating e.g. to a respective condition indicator of<br>
the previous aspect), the method comprising:<br>
Associating a time stamp with each data element of each stream, the time stamp<br>
identifying the time of acquisition of the data element on the basis of a clock<br>
common to all data streams;<br>
selecting a first data element from a first stream and inspecting its time stamp;<br>
conducting a search of the data elements of the or each other stream to identify<br>
the data element in the or each other element having an associated time stamp<br>
closest to that of the selected element of the first stream; and<br>
marking said identified data element of the or each other stream and said<br>
selected element of eth first stream as being synchronized with one another.<br>
Because, the relative acquisition times of the data elements are generally more<br>
significant than their absolute acquisition times, the common clock may be<br>
operate within an absolute or relative framework. In an absolute framework one<br>
clock provides the time stamp for each data element of each data stream. In a<br>
relative framework each data stream has its own clock, and one of the clock is<br>
selected as the reference clock against which the acquisition times of the other<br>
data streams are measured.<br>
It may be convenient to use a mixture of absolute and relative frameworks. For<br>
example, if the data streams relates to performance parameter and vibration<br>
measurements, the performance parameters may be time stamped from one<br>
clock and the vibration measurements from another clock.<br>
The process can be repeated until the data elements in the first stream have<br>
been exhausted, in any subsequent processing of the data that is reliant on using<br>
synchronized data streams, only those data elements marked as being<br>
synchronized with one another are used.<br>
In the case where the acquisition rates of the data streams differ from one<br>
another, it is preferred that the first stream, with which the other streams are<br>
synchronized, is chosen to be the stream having the lowest acquisition rate.<br>
The invention further provides a data processing system for synchronizing two or<br>
more data streams, each data stream comprising a series of sequentially<br>
acquired data elements, comprising:<br>
means for associating a time stamp with each data element of each stream, the<br>
time stamp identifying the time of acquisition of the data element on the basis of<br>
a clock common to all data streams;<br>
means for selecting a first data element from a first stream and inspecting its<br>
time stamp;<br>
means for conduction search of the data elements of the or each other stream to<br>
identify the data element in the or each other element having an associated<br>
tome stamp closest to that of the selected element of the first stream; and<br>
means for making said identified data element of the or each other stream and<br>
said selected element of the first stream as being synchronized with one another.<br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF<br>
THE INVENTION<br>
The embodiment described below is an example of a data processing system<br>
employing both aspects of the invention discussed above. More specifically, it is<br>
a system for synchronous acquisition, analysis and display of performance<br>
parameters and vibration data from a power plant (e.g. a gas turbine), for<br>
monitoring the health of the plant.<br>
In accordance with a preferred from of the second aspect, the performance and<br>
vibration data streams are synchronized in real time and, in accordance with a<br>
preferred aspect of the first aspect of the invention, these data are combined or<br>
fused to construct a signature for the system that can be compared to a<br>
signature derived from a model representing a healthy power plant, in order to<br>
provide anomaly/event detection and hence fault diagnosis.<br>
The following discussion focuses on a application of the system to monitoring the<br>
health of a gas turbine aero-engine, but it will be appreciated that the methods<br>
can be adapted to other power plant, including for example ground-based and<br>
marine gas turbine, and spark ignition and compression ignition internal<br>
combustion engines, as well as other mechanical, thermodynamic, fluid, electrical<br>
or electronic system. The system acquires performance parameters from the gas<br>
turbine digitally via an Ethernet link at a rate between 20 and 40Hz. Typical<br>
performance parameters are measurements of pressure, temperature, thrust,<br>
altitude or March number. Vibration data is acquired from analogue vibration<br>
transducers which are sampled at user-selectable sampling rates (from 625Hz to<br>
80KHz) via an analogue-to-digital converter. The amplitude spectrum of the<br>
vibration data is generated using the Fast Fourier Transform every 0.2 sec.<br>
The performance and vibration data streams are asynchronous and stored in<br>
separate files together with the corresponding timestamps. During review, as<br>
data is loaded into memory, synchronization is performed between the<br>
performance and spectrum data on a line by line basis.<br>
Markers 10,12 (see Fig. 1) are kept which record the last synchronized line in the<br>
vibration and performance data ring buffers 14,16. When new data is available in<br>
memory, the time stamp for the next vibration spectrum line is examined. The<br>
synchronization algorithm starts from the last previously synchronized location in<br>
the performance data and searches forwards or backwards based on the<br>
timestamps of the performance data (accurate to 0.05 sec) until the closest<br>
matching timestamp in the performance data ring buffer 16 is identified. This<br>
location in the performance data is recorded as being synchronized with the line<br>
in the vibration ring buffer 14. The algorithm then proceeds to the next line in<br>
the vibration ring buffer 14 (0.2 sec later) and so on until there is no more data<br>
available to synchronise.<br>
Clearly, therefore, if the performance parameters are acquired at 20 Hz (i.e. at<br>
0.05 sec intervals) the synchronization precision is 0.075 sec (i.e. half the<br>
acquisition interval added to the accuracy of the timestamps) and if the<br>
performance parameters are acquired at 40 Hz (i.e. at 0.025 sec intervals) the<br>
synchronization precision is 0.0625 sec.<br>
Considering the synchronization algorithm in a little more detail, it can be seen<br>
from Fig. i that the algorithm maintains a synchronization table 18 that gives the<br>
index of the performance data entry that matches each vibration data line. The<br>
algorithm uses variables to mark the latest synchronized data in each buffer. The<br>
operation of the algorithm can be summarized by the following 'pseudo code':<br>
1. Initialise the latest synchronized markers to the start of the vibration and<br>
performance data.<br>
2. Loop while there is more data in both ring buffers.<br>
(a) Starting from the latest synchronized data item in each ring buffer,<br>
examine the time stamp, t, on the next entry in the vibration ring buffer.<br>
(b) search forward in the performance ring buffer until a time stamp<br>
greater than t is found. Select between this entry in the performance ring<br>
buffer and the previous entry for one which is closest to t and record the<br>
match in the synchronization table.<br>
Once synchronized, the analysis of this performance and vibration data relies on<br>
constructing models of normal jet engine behaviour and then detecting an event<br>
or an abnormality with respect to these models.<br>
Traditional aircraft engine monitoring systems are based on two distinct<br>
processes: the use of vibration signatures to indicate engine state, and a<br>
separate procedure, gas-path analysis, which is employed for determination of<br>
state from performance parameters. In the approach described now, however,<br>
performance-retaled parameters such as pressure and temperature can be fused<br>
with vibration data (such as tracked order vectors - the elements of which<br>
correspond to the signal amplitude in a narrow range centered on the main<br>
vibration frequencies for each shaft of the turbine). The aim is to take advantage<br>
of disparate sources of data to from a more comprehensive picture of engine<br>
state during normal operation. This in turn should allow a wider range of<br>
deviations to be identified.<br>
Furthermore, it is proposed to employ learnt data-driven models a normal<br>
engine. Thus, although models of the engine system are used, these are not<br>
fixed. Instead, they evolve with acquired training data. This offers the important<br>
advantage of robustness.<br>
The methods of data analysis described below may be termed 'novelty<br>
detection'. An advantage of the methods is that the role of the expert need only<br>
be retained in classifying training data as abnormal (i.e. novel) or normal. The<br>
use of Kalman filtering systems in novelty detection has been described in e.g.<br>
M. Gelb, Applied Optimal Estimation. MIT Press 1974.<br>
Two alternative data analysis methods are described below. They are<br>
distinguished by the amount of prior knowledge required to set up the system. In<br>
both cases, the role of the expert need only be retained in classifying training<br>
data as novel or normal.<br>
The first method relies on a prior leant model of normality. For example, normal<br>
vibration tracked order shaped are learnt using a simple clustering model for the<br>
normal data. The novelty of e.g. the vibration signature for an engine under test<br>
is assessed by comparing the closeness of its tracked order signature with the<br>
prototypical patterns in the clustering model of normality. This can be done, for<br>
example, by computing the shortest normalized Euclidean distance between the<br>
vector encoding the tracked order shaped to any of the (prototypical patterns)<br>
cluster centers in the model of normality (see Nairac at al, 'A System for the<br>
Analysis of Jet Engine Vibration Data', Integrated Computer-aided Engineering,<br>
6(l):53-65, 1999). If this distance is beyond a previously set threshold, the<br>
vibration signature as represented by that tracked order is deemed to be outside<br>
the bounds of normality. In addition to the vibration tracked orders, the model of<br>
normality for the vibration spectra includes the following: sidebands, multiple<br>
harmonics, fractional harmonics and broadband power.<br>
The model is illustrated by an example in which a neural network having the<br>
architecture shown in Fig. 2 was developed as the learnt model.<br>
The neural network had an input layer 30 with four nodes consisting of four<br>
condition indicator measured relating to one shaft of a multi-shaft test engine.<br>
The condition indicators were the vibration amplitude, the phase and the shaft<br>
speed all at a specified time, and the shaft speed a time increment after the<br>
specified time.<br>
The output layer 32 of the network had two nodes for predicting respectively the<br>
change in vibration amplitude and change in phase after the time increment.<br>
The network had one hidden layer 34, each node of which contained a Gaussian<br>
radial basis function.<br>
The training phase for network used training data obtained from the test engine<br>
over a range of normal operating conditions. The centers and the spreads of the<br>
Gaussians were fixed using the cluster analysis described above and the weights<br>
of the connections between the nodes were then iterativeiy adjusted until the<br>
model converged.<br>
Figure 3 shows a graph of the prediction error (that is the sum of the prediction<br>
errors of the change in vibration amplitude and change in phase) for the model<br>
on a set of test data which also corresponded to the period of normal operating<br>
conditions for the engine. This graph provides a baseline of prediction error<br>
variation against which novel events can be judged.<br>

signature consisting of four condition indicator measured relating to one shaft of<br>

Fig. 3 shows a graph of the prediction error (i.e. the sum of the prediction errors<br>
of the change in vibration amplitude and change in phase) for the model on a set<br>
of test data which also corresponded to the period of normal operating<br>
conditions for the engine. This graph provides a baseline of prediction error<br>
variation against which novel events can be judged.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a graph of the prediction error for a further engine operating<br>
period. In this case, however, the engine experienced a bird strike. The largest<br>
peak in the graph corresponds to the moment of bird impact. Clearly the model<br>
was able to recognize this event. However, the changes prediction error signal<br>
(compared to the baseline of Fig. 3) after the event showed that the model was<br>
also able to detect post-impact abnormal engine behaviour. This provides<br>
confidence that the model can not only detect major events such as bird strikes,<br>
but also more subtle deviations from normality.<br>
The second method employs a process model which has a state vector<br>
associated with it (see below). The observation vector (i.e. the condition<br>
signature) has elements corresponding to measured values of performance<br>
parameters and vibration information so that two types of data are fused within<br>
the model. The fusion of the data is performed in real-time with a new output<br>
being generated by the system several times a second.<br>
An important aspect of the use of this model in the system is the use of learning.<br>
In a first, off-line, phase of learning, a generic model of the engine is learnt. The<br>
learning is data-driven using an algorithm such as Expectation-Maximisation in<br>
order to maximize the likelihood of the learnt model given the training data.<br>
Once such a generic model has been learnt off-line for a particular type of<br>
engine, learning can then be applied on-line in order to tune the model to an<br>
individual engine immediately after its pass-off test and after each maintenance<br>
procedure. Engine deterioration can also be learnt on-line. The learnt model can<br>
be turned to different flight conditions, such as cruising or landing, in order to<br>
detect novelty with even more sensitivity and specificity.<br>
The data-driven learnt model may be integrated with existing performance<br>
models which rely on the laws of thermodynamics and computational fluid<br>
dynamics (knowledge-based models). Such models can therefore be described as<br>
hybrid models because they are based on the integration of learnt and<br>
knowledge-based models.<br>
Looking in more detail at the learnt modeling approach, it is based on the<br>
application of Expectation Maximisation (EM) to parameter estimation in linear<br>
dynamical systems (see Ghahramani and Hinton, parameter Estimation for Linear<br>
Dynamical Systems, technical Report CRG-TR-96-2, University of Tornoto, 1996)<br>
and to non-linear systems (see Rowels and Ghahramani, 'A Unifying Review of<br>
Linear Gaussian Models', Neural Computation, 11, 305-345, 1999; and<br>
Ghahramani and Roweis, 'Learning in Nonlinear Dynamical System Using an EM<br>
Algorithm' in Kearns et al. (editors), advances in Neural Information Processing<br>
System, Volume 11, MIT Press, 1999).<br>
The EM learning algorithm is applied to a Kalman filter model. In the linear case,<br>
this is a system with a measurement process of the form<br><br>
Where y(i) is a set of observations of hidden state x(i), C is a covariance matrix,<br>
and measurement noise v(i) is zero-mean and normally distributed with<br>
covariance matrix R. y(i) and x(i) can be the same dimension. Non-zero off-<br>
diagonal terms in C allow the model to account for inter-dependencies between<br>
the performance parameter and vibration measurements of the condition and<br>
normal signatures. The state equation is<br><br>
with w(i) zero-mean and normally distributed with covariance matrix Q.<br>
At the beginning of the training phase A and C are initialized to small random<br>
values (e.g. with elements of the matrices ~ 10-5), and R and Q are initialized<br>
e.g. to I. Then during the training phase, for each condition signature y(i) in the<br>
training set, the method of rowels and Ghahramani applied to equation (2) to<br>
derive the most likely values for the elements of x(i), and the elements of C, R<br>
and v(i) are iteratively adjusted so that Cx(i) +v(i) converges to the respective<br>
condition signature (R and Q can be constrained throughout to be diagonal<br>
matrices). Convergence can be determined by the log-likelihood of the set of<br>
observations given the model.<br>
Instead of initializing the elements of A to small random values, it is also possible<br>
to adopt initial values that embody existing performance models of engine<br>
behaviour. After the training phase, the model would then be a hybrid of a<br>
knowledge-based and a data-driven model. By fusing these two methods of<br>
data-analysis, the accuracy of prior expert knowledge can be combined with the<br>
robustness of data-driven approaches.<br>
When the training phase has ended and the model is receiving real-time data<br>
consisting of a sequence of condition signature, the Kalman filter is again used to<br>
derive the most likely values for the elements of x(i) for each condition signature<br>
y(i). However, the elements of C and v(i) are now fixed, so Cx(i) +v(i) provides<br>
the normal signature for comparison with the condition signature.,<br>
For example, comparison of the normal signature with the condition signature<br>
can be on the basis of the normalized innovations squared (NIS). The<br>
innovations sequence v is the difference between the condition signature and the<br>
normal signature, so<br><br>
The innovations should be zero-mean and white.<br>
The NIS combines the individual innovations sequences.<br><br>
The individual sequence are weighted by the term S(k)1, the inverse of the<br>
innovation covariance given by<br><br>
where P(kl k-1) is the prediction covariance.<br>
The model is first illustrated by a simple example (which does not use vibration<br>
measurements) where observations are made of the speeds of the three shafts<br>
of a test engine during cruise. The observed data y is simply the state x<br>
corrupted by noise, so<br><br>
The observations are used during the learning process, to generate a dynamical<br>
system model in which A, C, Q and R are learned from the data. At the beginning<br>
of the training phase A and C were initialized to small random values and R and<br>
Q were initialized to I.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates the learning (log likehood) plot for the system. Fig. 6 shows the<br>
evolution of estimates of shaft 1 speeds during the learning process using the EM<br>
algorithm. In the example shown, the learning stage lasts for the first 25<br>
iterations. From iteration 25 onwards, the system's dynamical properties are<br>
determined by the learned matrices (which are then kept fixed).<br>
Once trained, the systems can be used to detect events or abnormalities, that is<br>
to say divergences from the learnt model of normality. The events of particular<br>
interest are those that are unexpected, possibly indicating a problem with the<br>
engine for example. However, particularly where the models have been learned<br>
only for 'steady state' parts of the flight envelope (e.g. acceleration, cruise and<br>
deceleration), transients during operation of the engine will also be flagged up as<br>
events, although they are expected. For example, where a bleed valve is opened<br>
or closed, the operating condition of the engine will exhibit significant differences<br>
from a learnt model of steady state normality which does not include this event.<br>
Thus when using such a steady state model, measures can be employed to avoid<br>
these transient events. For instance, since the opening of a bleed valve is an<br>
event that occurs at a defined point in time, the data collected from the engine<br>
at the time and slightly either side of it (e.g. for 2 seconds before and after) can<br>
be eliminated from the data analysed by the health monitoring system.<br>
The approach is next illustrated with a more elaborate example which uses both<br>
performance parameters and vibration data. In this example the model was<br>
applied to data acquired from a test bed-mounted, multi-shaft, aero gas turbine<br>
engine which was undergoing a cyclic acceleration-deceleration test when it<br>
experienced an intermediate pressure turbine lock-plate event. Such tests are<br>
used to investigate engine behaviour under extreme conditions. The data was<br>
acquired synchronously as described above.<br>
A lock-plate event occurred in the engine on test day 152-00. The training data<br>
was 152-00 data for a period before the event, and the test data was 152-00<br>
data for the period including the event. In this example a 14 dimensional model<br>
(i.e. y(i) and x(i) each had 14 elements) was used in which the condition<br>
indicator inputs were:<br>
- The tracked orders of the low pressure (tol), intermediate pressure (toi)<br>
and high pressure (toh) shafts,<br>
- The shaft speeds of the low pressure (NIV), intermediate pressure (N2V)<br>
and high pressure (N3V) shafts,<br>
- The ambient (POV), total inlet (P20V), high pressure compressor delivery<br>
(P30V) and exhaust (PEXV) pressures,<br>
- The total inlet (T20V) and high pressure compressor delivery (T30V)<br>
temperatures,<br>
- The turbine gas temperature trimmed (TGTTRM)<br>
- The demanded fuel flow (WFDEM)<br>
At the beginning of the training phase A and C were initialized to small random<br>
values and R and Q were initialized to I.<br>
Fig. 7 shows the measured low pressure shaft speed (NIV) for part of the period<br>
of the test data, and Fig. 8 shows the value for the NIS calculated by the trained<br>
model over the same period.<br>
The first two sharp troughs in the NIV trace were caused by planned consecutive<br>
cyclic decelerations. Associated with each of these troughs are two NIS peaks.<br>
These peaks indicated that the engine was not behaving normally during the<br>
cyclic testing. In fact subsequent examination revealed that a lock plate had<br>
released earlier during the test and as a result abnormal blade rubbing was<br>
occurring during each of the deceleration cycles.<br>
During the third planned deceleration cycle in the period covered by Figs. 7 and<br>
8 (i.e. at approximately data point 12850) the engine sustained blade damage<br>
which resulted in the sharp NIS peak and drop off in NIV.<br>
However, the earlier (all be it smaller) NIS peaks demonstrate that the<br>
monitoring system was able detect the effect of the lock plate release in real<br>
time and before substantial blade damage was sustained. If such a release had<br>
occurred in an in-service aero engine, it would therefore have been possible to<br>
generate an immediate warning so that timely action (such as engine inspection<br>
or maintenance) could have been performed. In contrast, sudden variations in<br>
NIV can occur normally, so Nlv alone is not a reliable indicator of abnormal<br>
behaviour.<br>
A further example also uses both performance parameter and vibration data.<br>
Again the model was applied to synchronously data acquired from a test bed-<br>
mounted, multi-shaft, aero gas turbine engine. However, in this case an oil seal<br>
leak developed in the engine.<br>
The fault occurred in the engine around data point 50410. The training data was<br>
from a period before the fault, and the test data was for a period including the<br>
fault. In this example a 13 dimensional model was used in which the condition<br>
indicator inputs were tol, toi, toh, N1V, N2V, N3V, P20V, P30V, PEXV, T20V,<br>
TGTTRM, AND WFDEM.<br>
Fig. 9 shows the values for the 13 condition indicators and the NIS (in the<br>
bottom graph) over the period including the event. The sharp NIS peak at data<br>
point 50410 again demonstrates that the monitoring system was able to detect<br>
the moment of the event. Although some of the other condition indicators also<br>
had peaks at this time, by themselves they cannot be reliably associated with<br>
abnormal (novel) behaviour.<br>
Subsequent examination showed that the event was an oil seal which allowed<br>
engine oil to enter the combustor. Because of this leak the engine control system<br>
reduced the amount of fuel entering the combustor (hence the drop in WEDEM)<br>
to maintain the engine thrust (given by PEXV / P20) at a constant level.<br>
After the event, with oil continuing to leak into the combustor, the engine was<br>
operating outside the scope of normal behaviour. This was successfully picked up<br>
by the NIS trace which after data point 50410 did not return to its pre-event<br>
level.<br>
Next we consider how a health monitoring system, incorporating the model<br>
described above, could be installed for in-flight analysis of aero gas turbines.<br>
An on-the engine system, shown schematically in Fig. 10, could generate of the<br>
order of 1 Gb of vibration and performance data (consisting mainly of pressures,<br>
temperatures and shaft speeds) per flight. The vibration data is usually analysed<br>
in the frequency domain. The vibration and performance data, as there are being<br>
generated by data acquisition means 20, are temporarily stored in ring buffer 22.<br>
The data is synchronized and subjected to novelty detection in processor and<br>
comparator means 24 which receives a synchronisation signal from data<br>
acquisition means 20 and the data from ring buffer 22. Those sections of the<br>
data corresponding to novel events are then tagged and recorded with no loss of<br>
information (i.e. highbandwidth data is recorded) in registration means 26 which<br>
has semi-permanent on-line and/or hard disk storage. When the flight is<br>
completed the stored data may be downloaded and subjected to more intensive<br>
ground-based analysis.<br>
The system may also include a display which is driven to allow information to be<br>
displayed either during acquisition or for review once an acquisition cycle has<br>
been completed, it preferably includes the following features:<br>
Ability to display the result of the comparison of the condition signature<br>
with the normal signature, e.g. in the form of the NIS or the prediction<br>
error. An unhealthy event nay be highlighted e.g. with an alert signal.<br>
Ability is display a combination of any two of vibration spectra, tracked<br>
orders, broadband power, performance parameters synchronized in time.<br>
Ability to extract and plot vibration spectra against engine speed.<br>
Ability to interrogate and print any of vibration spectra, tracked orders,<br>
broadband power and performance parameters.<br>
Automatic detection and display of features from vibration spectra<br>
(sidebands, harmonics, etc.)<br>
