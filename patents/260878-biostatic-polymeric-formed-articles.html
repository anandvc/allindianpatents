				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a method and composition for making a film or<br>
formed article which has a biostatic or biocidal surface. Articles which are cast,<br>
extruded, moulded or otherwise formed according to the invention have a surface<br>
which resists microbial colony growth thereupon for a long period.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way<br>
be considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of<br>
common general knowledge in the field.<br>
It is well known that infection may be transmitted from one person to another<br>
by direct contact, by inhalation of air home infectious particles, or by contact with<br>
infectious fluids. Infection is also commonly transmitted indirectly for example by<br>
contact with a surface that has itself become infected by contact with an infected<br>
person, or with infected airborne particles, or fluids.<br>
For example hospital taps are a notorious for their potential to transmit<br>
infection and this has been to some extent alleviated by the use of elbow lever taps.<br>
But inside hospitals microbial agents such as bacteria, spores, viruses and fungi can<br>
also be indirectly transmitted by staff handling instruments, instrument sterilizing<br>
baths, door handles, and by touching many other surfaces. Both inside and outside of<br>
hospitals infections are spread via contact with toilet cubicle surfaces, toilet flushing<br>
2<br><br>
buttons/levers, toilet doorhandles, telephone handsets, lift buttons, furniture and<br>
building surfaces, documents, and utensils to name but a few of countless examples.<br>
Surfaces of all of these typically harbour significant and rapidly growing colonies of<br>
microbes, moulds and the like. The invention also extends to include surfaces on<br>
which slimes and the like may harbour microbes such as tubings, surfaces in water<br>
treatment plants and the like and tubing.<br>
The risk of infection from such lite surfaces is reduced by regular cleaning<br>
with disinfectant solutions. However it is not practical to wipe such surfaces<br>
sufficiently often to provide effective disinfection.<br>
Mo disinfectants for application to surfaces have been sufficiently durable to<br>
maintain a biostatic or biocidal surface for long periods in use. Attempts to<br>
incorporate disinfectants into solid articles for slow release have either not proven<br>
sufficiently durable, or have not been sufficiently effective or have been too toxic or<br>
expensive and none has been commercially successful<br>
It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate at least one<br>
of the disadvantages of the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative.<br>
According to one aspect the invention provides a composition comprising a<br>
polyvinyl alcohol in combination with a biocide which is a plasticizer, or in<br>
combination with a biocide and a compatible plasticiser, and wherein the biocide<br>
forms a complex with the polyvinyl alcohol, said combination having been heated to<br>
above its melting point, said composition having a surface which remains biostatic or<br>
biocidal for at least 7 days.<br>
3<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment the biocide is the plasticizer and no additional<br>
plasticisers are required. However, if desired additional plasticisers may be added.<br>
Alternatively a biocide may be selected in combination with a compatible plasticiser<br>
and in that case the biocide need not itself be a plasticiser provided that it forms a<br>
complex with the polyvinyl alcohol.<br>
In highly preferred embodiments the biocide is a quaternary ammonium<br>
compound which acts as the sole plasticiser and the surface remains biostatic or<br>
biocidal for very much longer periods than 7 days. Preferred embodiments are free of<br>
microbes after manufacture, and prevent microbial colony growth on the surface after<br>
a period of months, even when the surface has been subjected to running water<br>
continuously in the interim.<br>
It is believed that a complex formed by hydrogen bonding between the<br>
biocide and the polyvinyl alcohol prevents or inhibits leaching of biocide from the<br>
surface of the article.<br>
Other embodiments of the invention provide a film or formed article<br>
manufactured from a polyvinyl alcohol incorporating a plasticizer, and a biocide<br>
which forms a complex with the polyvinyl alcohol. In a preferred such embodiment<br>
the biocide is a quaternary ammonium compound; and the plasticizer is a phenoxy<br>
ethanol, a suitable high boiling alcohol, ether, ester or the like. In preferred<br>
embodiments the surface remains biostatic or biocidal for very much longer periods<br>
than 7 days and it is believed will do so for the life of the article.<br>
The present invention also provides composition in the form of a melt which<br>
comprise a polyvinyl alcohol in combination with a biocide which is a plasticizer, or<br>
in combination with a biocide and a compatible plasticiser, and wherein the biocide<br>
4<br><br>
forms a complex with the polyvinyl alcohol. The melt may be hot and/or flowable, or<br>
cooled and/or solidified.<br>
According to a second aspect the invention provides a method for forming an<br>
article having a biostatic or biocidal surface, comprising the steps of combining a<br>
polyvinyl alcohol with a biocide which is a plasticiser, or with a biocide and a<br>
plasticiser, and wherein the biocide forms a complex with the polyvinyl alcohol, and<br>
heating the combination to above its melting point<br>
Desirably any acid evolved during heating is removed by incorporation of an<br>
acid scavenger or is removed as volatiles for example by reduced pressure. Suitable<br>
acid scavengers are exemplified by metal hydroxides, for example magnesium<br>
hydroxide, or suitable amines An article may be formed from the resulting<br>
composition e.g. by extrusion of the melt<br>
For preference the biocide is a quaternary ammonium biocidal compound<br>
which itself acts as a plasticizer. A combination of plasticizers may be used and the<br>
combination may include those which are biocides or those which are not For<br>
example, some quaternary compounds which are good biocides and which form<br>
complexes with polyvinyl alcohol are not good plasticisers and may be used as the<br>
biocide in combination with other more effective compatible plasticisers<br>
Preferably the materials are first blended and then the blend is extruded in an<br>
extrusion machine having at least one, and preferably a plurality of ports along the<br>
extrusion outlet channel from which volatiles may be removed under low pressure<br>
during the extrusion process. Desirably the blend is heated during extrusion to a<br>
temperature in the range of from 90°C to 220 °C, and more preferably from 140°C to<br>
210°C, and more preferably still at 190°C to 200 °C. The extrudate may be pelletized<br>
and used as a raw material for a casting, moulding (including injection and blow<br>
5<br><br>
moulding) or other forming processes. In less preferred embodiments, it is envisaged<br>
that a suitable blend melt may be formed in a reactor under vacuum and then cast or<br>
extruded.<br>
For preference the composition comprises from 20 %- 75 % of polyvinyl<br>
alcohol and from 0.5%-25% of a quaternary ammonium biocide. However if the<br>
polyvinyl alcohol is combined with other polymers or copolymers, or fillers, the<br>
composition as a whole may contain down to 0.5%wt of polyvinyl alcohol. In<br>
preferred embodiments, the polyvinyl alcohol has a degree of polymerization such<br>
that its viscosity is from 25-30 cp in a 1% aqueous solution at 20 °C and has a degree<br>
of hydrolysis such that in excess of 97.5% of the acetate groups have been hydrolysed<br>
to hydroxyl groups. However for moulding more rigid articles, a polyvinyl alcohol<br>
having a significantly higher degree of polymerisation (and consequently viscosity in<br>
solution) is preferred<br>
Polyvinyl alcohol normally begins to decompose at around 140°C which is<br>
below its melting point Consequently prior attempts to extrude or mould polyvinyl<br>
alcohol by itself have merely resulted in the composition decomposing under the<br>
influence of heat and pressure. This has been overcome by the addition of polyalcohol<br>
plasticizers such as glycerine and pentaerythritol together with addition of metal<br>
hydroxides to the blend being extruded. The resulting polymers are expensive and<br>
with the exception of some low alcohol polyvinyl alcohol polymers which are readily<br>
soluble in water, they have no particular properties which have been considered useful<br>
commercially, None of the prior art polymers were biostatic or biocidal. In the<br>
present invention low pressure can be used to remove volatiles from the components<br>
6<br><br>
during healing and this assists in avoiding decomposition and /or one or more acid<br>
scavengers may be added to avoid decomposition during heating.<br>
The present inventors have found that under certain conditions polyvinyl<br>
alcohol can be formed into shapes and that when a quaternary ammonium compound<br>
is included, it forms a complex with the polyvinyl alcohol. Evidence ibr complex<br>
formation resides in a significant shift in the infra red spectrum of a the OH group<br>
peak from 3296cm-1 in pure polyvinyl alcohol to 3346cm-1 in mixtures with the<br>
quaternary ammonium biocide indicative of very significant levels of hydrogen<br>
bonding. The quaternary ammonium compound serves as a plasticizer but is also<br>
effective at the surface of the article to confer longstanding biostatic or biocidal<br>
properties.<br>
The surface of the article is free of microbes when formed (ie. is disinfected)<br>
and the formed article remains biostatic or biocidal for long periods. By biostatic is<br>
meant that microbial colonies (if any) on the surface do not grow or multiply. By<br>
biocidal is meant that bacteria (but not necessarily mycobacteria) and fungi on the<br>
surface are killed. By "long periods" in this context is meant a period of at least<br>
weeks, preferably months, and more preferably years. If the subsequently becomes<br>
contaminated it may be disinfected (eg by treatment with a disinfectant) and will<br>
thereafter again resist microbial colony growth for a long period<br>
Furthermore, the articles of the present invention present a fresh biostatic or<br>
biocidally active surface if the article is cut scarred, scratched or otherwise disrupted.<br>
This is in contrast to coated articles, which, when the integrity of the coating is<br>
disrupted, can in some cases harbour bacteria. Unless the context clearly requires<br>
otherwise, throughout the description and the claims, the words 'comprise',<br>
'comprising', and the like are to be construed in an inclusive sense as opposed to an<br>
7<br><br>
exclusive of exhaustive sense; that is to say, in the sense of "including, but not limited<br>
to".<br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention the quaternary ammonium<br>
compound is n alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride and is present in the range<br>
of from 0.5% to 75% w/w of the dried composition and more preferably 0.5% to 25%.<br>
The present inventors have discovered that a combination of a polyvinyl<br>
alcohol with a quaternary ammonium biocide results, after melting under conditions<br>
which avoid decomposition, in a composition which is biostatic, that is to say on<br>
which micro organisms do not grow.<br>
The extruded composition may be dissolved in a solvent and used to form a<br>
film with which to coat a surface, or may be used to cast a film, but preferably is<br>
extruded to form a sheet, tube, extruded moulding of Indefinite length, or may be<br>
pelletized and the pellets may be recycled or used to mould or otherwise form an<br>
article by known techniques, the article having a surface which is biostatic and<br>
remains so for long periods.<br>
The combination may optionally include adhesion promoters, vehicles,<br>
pigments and the like, and may include acid scavengers such as metal hydroxides or<br>
amines.<br>
The term "polyvinyl alcohol" as herein used includes all resins made by the<br>
hydrolysis (saponification) of polyvinyl esters, for example polyvinyl acetate. The<br>
properties of the resins vary according to the degree of polymerization of the parent<br>
polyvinyl ester and the extent of the hydrolysis (saponification degree). In the case of<br>
a polyvinyl alcohol prepared from polyvinyl acetate the structure of polyvinyl alcohol<br>
may be represented by<br>
8<br><br>
-CH2CEOH (CH2CHOH)m-<br>
where "1+m" is the degree of polymerization. On partial hydrolysis proportional<br>
amounts of residual CH2COO- groups are distributed along the chain in place of OH<br>
and the amount of such acetate groups expressed as a percentage is the acetate<br>
content. Thus in polyvinyl alcohol of 70% acetate content, 30% of the acetate groups<br>
of the original polyvinyl acetate were hydrolysed to hydroxyl groups, and 70% remain<br>
as acetate groups. This may be referred to as 70% acetate content or as a 30% alcohol.<br>
In commercial grades "low acetate" or "high alcohol" grades covers up to about 15%<br>
acetate (i.e. from 100% down to about 85% alcohol), "medium acetate" covers from<br>
about 15% to about 45% acetate and "high acetate" or "low alcohol" grades over 45%<br>
acetate (below about 55% alcohol).<br>
The term "polyvinyl alcohol" as used herein includes all suitable grades,<br>
degrees of saponification and degrees of polymerization.<br>
Polyvinyl alcohols may also be made by hydrolysing polyvinyl esters other<br>
than acetates, and the same principles apply to the polyvinyl alcohols so formed<br>
which may also be used in the invention. Preferred embodiments of the invention<br>
utilize polyvinyl alcohol having an average degree of hydrolysis of greater than 96<br>
mole % hydrolysis, since such compositions are more resistant to removal by cold or<br>
warm water.<br>
Quaternary Ammonium compounds for use in the invention<br>
The invention has been exemplified by reference to n-alkyl dimethyl benzyl<br>
ammonium chloride (also known as benzalkonium chloride) as the highly preferred<br>
quaternary biocide. Alkyl benzyl quaternary biocidal compounds are preferred;<br>

The quaternary ammonium compound is incorporated for broad spectrum<br>
(gram positive and gram negative) antibacterial properties.<br>
Although the quaternary ammonium compound may comprise from 0.5%to 75% w/w<br>
of the dried film composition, it is preferred to employ more than 2% w/w of the dried<br>
film composition.<br>
Examples of the invention<br>
Example 1<br>
A composition consisting of 70 parts of polyvinyl alcohol having a degree of<br>
saponification of about 98.5% hydroxyl and a viscosity of 4.6-6.0 cps in a 1%<br>
solution at 20°C was blended with 30 parts n-Alkyl (40%C12,50%C14, 10%<br>
C16)dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride in a polymer compounded. The blend was<br>
extruded in a D.S.M. brand laboratory scale mini extruder having a port on the<br>
extrusion barrel which was subjected to pressure reduction by a modestly sized<br>
vacuum pump. Commercial versions of this extruder have up to 10 ports on the<br>
extrusion barrel The extrusion rate was 20gm/ min and the temperature was in the<br>
range 190°C to 200 °C The extrudate was men used to feed an injection moulding<br>
apparatus which was used to produce disk shaped samples about 3cm in diameter and<br>
0,4 cm thick for testing.<br>
Example 2<br>
A composition consisting of 95 parts of polyvinyl alcohol having a degree of<br>
saponification of about 98.5% hydroxyl and a viscosity of 4.6-6.0 cps in a 1%<br>
solution at 20°C was blended with 5 parts n-Alkyl (40%C12,50%C14,10% C16)<br>
12<br><br>
Plasticizer selected from phenoxyethanol ;l-hexanol;l-heptanol; 2-heptanol; 3-<br>
heptanol; 1-octanol; 2- octanol; 1-nonanol; octyleneglycol; 2-ethyl-1,3- hexanediol.<br>
Moulded disks formed from composition according to examples 1-5 were<br>
tested for biostatic properties. The disks were inoculated with Pseudomonas Originosa<br>
ATCC 15442 (6.1 log concentration) in accordance with test method AOAC 955.17<br>
and met the criteria for fungistatic efficacy.<br>
Other disks were subjected to a stream of running water for 24hours 7 days<br>
and 30 days and tested at the end of those periods. In each case the disks met the<br>
criteria of test method AOAC 955.17 for fungistatic efficacy. These tests are ongoing<br>
and the inventors are confident that the surfaces will maintain the bacteriostatic<br>
properties for the life of the article.<br>
Biocidal properties of moulded disks made from a composition according to<br>
the examples were tested according to ASIM B2180 - 01 immediately after drying<br>
(t=0); after 7 days; and after 30 days with the following results:<br><br>
Time (t)	Result<br><br>
0	Total kill<br>
7 days	Total kill<br>
30 days	Total kill<br>
While it is preferred to use a biocide which acts as both biocide and<br>
plasticizer, a combination of such biocide with other plasticizers may be used, or<br>
selected plasticisers may be employed with a biocide which is not itself a plasticizer<br>
but which forms a bond with the polyvinyl alcohol or plasticizer or both such as to<br>
inhibit leaching of the biocide from the article. Suitable plasticisers for use in the<br>
invention include phenoxyethanol; 1-hexanol;1-heptanol; 2-heptanol; 3-heptanol; 1-<br>
13<br><br>
octanol; 2- octanol; 1-nonanol; octyleneglycol; 2-ethyl-1,3- hexanediol; other high<br>
boiling point alcohols and polyols; and compatible ethers such as nonyl phenol<br>
condensed with two or three moles of ethylene oxide or esters of dibutyl phthalate or<br>
dioctyl phthaiate such as used as PVC plasticizers.<br>
It will be understood that compositions according to the invention may be<br>
combined with other suitable polymers or copolymers either by combining pellets of<br>
compositions according to the invention with the other polymers or by combining<br>
them prior to melting the Polyvinyl alcohol.<br>
Compositions according to the invention may be coated as hot melts on and<br>
are effective on a wide range of surfaces including without limitation paper, textiles,<br>
plastics, metals, glass, and ceramics. The compositions may be extruded as sheets,<br>
rods, tubes or mouldings of indefinite length. Extruded compositions may be<br>
pelletised and recycled or the pellets may be used as raw material for moulding and<br>
forming processes to make articles of more complex shape. Compositions according<br>
to the invention may be incorporated into articles, (for example paper cups or food<br>
containers), or articles may be formed directly from the compositions when suitably<br>
formulated.<br>
Those skilled in the art will be able to select combinations of polyvinyl<br>
alcohols and quaternary ammonium compounds for use in the invention based on the<br>
teaching hereof and to select appropriate ratios according to intended end product use.<br>
The invention extends to include the combination, solutions of the combination in<br>
appropriate solvents, and films or articles formed from the combination with or<br>
without solvents.<br>
