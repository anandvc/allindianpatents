Process of Producing Bleach Boosters<br>
This invention relates to a process of producing compounds, which are useful as bleach boosters, as well as to the compounds, which are obtainable using said process, and to ttieir use.<br>
Oxygen bleaching agents, for example hydrogen peroxide, are typically used to Tacili-tate the removal of stains and soils from clothing and various surfaces. Unfortunately such agents are extremely temperature rate dependent. As a result, when such agents are employed in colder solutions, the bleaching action of such solutions is marltediy decreased.<br>
In an effort to resolve the aforementioned performance problem, the Industry developed a class of materials known as "bleach activators" or "bleach boosters", with both terms iDeIng used identical. However, as such materials rapidly lose their effectiveness at solution temperatures of less than 40 "C, new organic catalysts such as 3,4-dihydro-2-[2-{suifooxy)decy[]isoquinolimium, inner salt were developed. The term "organic catalyst" is used as another term for "bleach activator" or "bleach booster" throughout this deso-iption. In general, while such current art catalysts are effective in lower temperature water conditions, they can inactivate certain enzymes. As most laundry and cleaning compositions are formulated with enzymes, formulating cleaning products with such catalysts can be problematic.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need tor an organic catalyst that can provide the combined benefits of formulation flexibility, low water temperature bleaching performance and enzyme compalibitity.<br>
The process of producing l-(4,4-dimethyl-3,4-dihydroisochinoiine)decane-2-sulfate, which is known to be a bieach booster, is described in WO 01/16273: 1,2-decanediol is dissolved In carbon tetrachloride. Thionyl chloride is added dropwise at room temperature and the reaction mixture is heated to 60 "C. After some h time the reaction mixture is cooled using an ice bath. Water and acetonitrile are added as well as ruthenium chloride hydrate and sodium periodate. After stirring for an hour at room temperature, the reaction mixture is extracted with diethylether (4 times); the organic layers are subsequently washed with water (5 times), saturated sodium bicarbonate (3 times), brine (2 times), filtered through celite/silica gel, and dried over magnesium sulphate. After that the resulting liquid is concentrated to yietd a clear oil, which oil is 1,2-decanediol cyclic sulphate. In the next reaction step 4,4-dimethyl-3,4-dihydroisoquincline and acetonitrile are combined with the 1,2-decanediQl cyclic sulphate, which is added in one portion. After another addition of acetonitrile the reaction mixture is stin-ed for some h. Then the precipitate is collected, washed with acetone and allowed to dry to give 1-{4,4-dimethyl-3,4-dihydraisochinoline)decane-2-sulfate.<br><br>
While this process can be used in laboraiory scale there exists a strong need to have a process that is usable in industrial scale, i.e. a process, which avoids the use of expensive educts such as thionyi chloride. Therefore it is one goal of the present invention to find a process, which avoids the use of thionyi chloride. It is another goal of the present invention to find new compounds, which are accessible using this process and which compounds can be used as bleach boosters, preferably those bleach boosters having the combined benefits as are outlined above.<br>
Surprisingly it has been found that these needs are met by the compounds according to claims 1 to 6 and the process according to claims 7 to 22.<br>
As used herein, the term "cleaning composition" includes, unless othenwise indicated, granular or powder-form all-purpose or "heavy-duty" washing agents, especially laundry detergents; liquid, gel or paste-form all-purpose washing agents, especially the so-called heavy-duty liquid types; liquid fine-fabric detergents; hand dishwashing agents or light duty dishwashing agents, especially those of the high-foaming type; machine dishwashing agents, including the various tablet, granular, liquid and rinse-aid types for household and institutional use; liquid cleaning and disinfecting agents, including anti-bacteriat hand-wash types, laundry bars, mouthwashes, denture cleaners, car or carpet shampoos, bathroom cleaners; hair shampoos and hair-rinses; shower gels and foam baths and metal cleaners; as well as cleaning auxiliaries such as bleach additives and "stain-stick" or pre-treat types.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "is independently selected from the group consisting of	"<br>
means that moieties or elements that are selected from the referenced Markush group can be the same, can be different or any mixture of elements.<br>
The test methods disciosed in the Test Methods Section of the present application must be used to determine the respective values of the parameters of Applicants' inventions.<br>

The present invention does not only deal with compounds, but also with processes of producing such compounds. Therefore a<br>
process comprising the following steps:<br><br><br>
Based on this general process there exist preferred embodiments, one of which is a process, wherein in step a) an alkylchloride, -bromide, -iodide or -tosylate or a substituted arylchloride, -bromide, -iodide or -tosylate is used in amount of 2 to 4 equivalents based on benzytcyanide. A process wherein in step a) an alkylchloride or substituted benzylchloride is used in an amount of 2 to 2.5 equivalents based on benzylcyanide is more preferred.<br>
A. process as described above, wherein the reaction of step a) takes place in the presence of 2 to 4 equivalents (based on benzylcyanide) of a base is another preferred<br><br>
embodiment of the present invention, whereby it is preferred when the base is KOtBu or KOH/tBuOH and it is also preferred wiien solvent, alkylating agent and benzylcya-nide are first mixed and the reaction Is initiated by addition of the base. By doing this the formation of side products can be reduced.<br>
Possible solvents for the reaction in step a) are toluene, tetrahydrofurane (THF), di-msthylsulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylformamlde (DMF) and others, with toluene being preferred. The reaction of step a) can be performed at atmospheric pressure as well as under positive pressure or under a light vacuum. The use of a neutral gas is possible. The temperature lies in the range of from - 40 °C to 200 °C, with a range from 0 to 120 °C being preferred,<br>
A process as described above, wherein step b) is performed using hydrogen In the presence of a catalyst is preferred. When using a borane-THF-complex numerous side products are obtained. When using a catalyst such as Raney-nickel the appearance of such side products can be avoided or at least be reduced and the purity of the product is Increased.<br>
Possible solvents for the reaction in step b) again are toluene, tetrahydrofurane (THF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylformamide (DMF) and others, with toluene being preferred. The reaction of step b) can be performed at about atmospheric pressure as well as under positive pressure, with positive pressure being preferred. The temperature lies in the range of from-40 °C to 200 "C, with a range from 0 to 120 °C being preferred.<br>
A process as described above, wherein step c) is performed using formic acid and/or fonnic acid ester forms another preferred embodiment of the present invention, with the use of formic acid ester being preferred. It is particularly preferred to use formic acid methyl ester, since it has a boiling point of 34 "C, which makes the removal of a surplus easier compared to formic acid having a boiling point of 100 "C The reaction of step c) can advantageously be performed at a temperature of about room temperature. In any case it should be perfomied below the boiling temperature of the components. By increasing the pressure, which normally Is atmospheric pressure, also the temperature can be Increased, which leads to a reduction of the time needed for the completion of the reaction.<br><br><br>
A process as described above, wherein step d) is performed using phosphorous pen-toxide and an acid is another preferred object of the present invention, whereby it is preferred when the acid is selected from the group consisting of poly phosphorous acid, trifluoro methane acid, formic acid and methane sulfonic acid. Compared to standard Bischler-Napieralski reaction conditions the amount of phosphor-containing compounds as well as the reaction time could be reduced. This makes the reaction less expensive and has a positive effect with respect to the overall environmental rating of the process. Instead of poly phosphorous acid (PPA) methane sulfonic acid (MSA) can be used. This is not possible when using MSA alone. At temperatures of about 160 °C, which is above the decomposition temperature of MSA, which is about 140 °C, good results can be obtained.<br>
It is further preferred when in the process as described above the reaction mixture of step d) is neutralized using KOH, because this leads to salts that have a higher solubility.<br><br>
to perform a Piciet-Spengier reaction from (4) to (13), followed by cleavage of the amide to give (14) and subsequent oxidation using sodium hypochlorite. A great advantage of this alternative is to be seen in the fact that the reaction can be performed as a one pot reaction. An additional advantage is the fact, that this is a phosphate free route to obtain the desired products, which means lower cost for waste disposal and an environmentally friendly process.<br>
As a source of formaldehyde trioxane is advantageous, since it has a melting point of 62 °C, and therefore can be applied easily as a liquid, (t is obvious that a heated feed pipe can advantageously been used. As the acid all kinds of strong acids, such as trifluoro acetic acid, formic acid or methane sulfonic acid can be used.<br><br>
A process as described above, wherein in step d) after neutralization the amine is oxidized to give an imine using sodium liypochlorite is preferred and It is even more preferred wlien in this step tine alkylating agent is used in an amount of 1 to 1.2 equivalents based on the product from step d):<br><br>
!t is particularly prefen-ed, when a process as described above is performed in which process in at least one of steps a) to e) a solvent Is used, whereby preferably the same solvent is used in more than one step.<br>
A process as described above, wherein the solvent is toluene is particularly preferred and a process wherein the solvent in steps a) to d) is toluene and in step e) is acetone or acetonitrile is most preferred. Acetone has the additional advantage of having a low boiling point - which facilitates the removal of the solvent,<br>
Suitable organic catalysts can be produced using a variety of reaction vessels and processes including batch, semi-batch and continuous processes.<br>
The oxaziridinium ring containing version of the aforementioned catalyst may be produced by contacting an Iminium containing version of said catalyst with an oxygen transfer agent such as a peroxycarboxylic acid or a peroxymonosulfuric acid. Such species can be fomed in situ and used without purification.<br>
