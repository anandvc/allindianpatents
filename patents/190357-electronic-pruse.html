				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Electronic-Purse is irelated with currency. Digital currency. E-money. Currency in figures. Figures to give ;ud figures to take, inspite of paper currency, iÂ«the main objective of this invention. Presently, paper currency and coins are in existence. It is very expensive to print notes, and to mould coins. These things also occupy space and weight and need immense security. These are to be counted for every transaction, which consume time. Fake notes and base coins is one more draw-back. Electronic-Purse (E.P.) eliminates ail these draw-backs, thus saving time and money.<br>
This Electronic-Purse is divided into three parts. Part-A, Part-B and Part-C. Electronic-Purse comprising main computer (Part-A) having two display screens neon-red (nr) and lower liquid crystal display (Id), two channels (ch-I) and (ch-II), to enhance it's capacity, two inlets (il-1) and (il-2) provided for receiving figures, one outlet lead (ol) provided for giving figures, housed in a plastic body having 24 push-buttons.<br>
Part-A (shown in the figure )is a computer which produces figures as well as deliver figures. The figure producer computer is ore and only one piece in the hands of the govt. It will take place of security press and mint. It will deliver e-money through Electronic-Purses (Part-B and Part-C) with the help of outlet lead 'ol'. It is housed in a plastic body. It is powered by electricity and a powerful special designed cnip-x works inside. There are 24 push type buttons (like cell-phone buttons) in front of it (as shown in the fig. Part-A). There are two in-lets 'il-l'and 'il-2'for receiving figures with the help of out-let lead 'oF. There are two channels ch-1 &amp; ch-II in it, and a channel selector 'cs'.<br>
Out-let lead 'ol' is the main tool which transfer figures from one E.P. to another E.P. It is equipped with two displays. Upper one is Neon-Red 'nr' display. The lower one is LCD 'Id' display .<br>
Part-B is a small E.P. resembling a calculator. It is very simple to operate. It is designed for children, women, aged persons and illiterate people. Il is also equipped with two displays 'nr' and 'Id'. It is operated by a chip-xx. It has dual power of battery and solar cells. It has 16 push buttons. Two channels, two in-lets, and one out-let lead, are the main features of this Simple- Model E.P. This model E.P. will be delivered by the govt. between the citizens and it will be able to transfer figures only, it is not able to produce figures.<br>
Part-C is also a pocket-size E.P. There are two channels in it, channel ch-I will be operated with the help of code no. for greater safety. Channel ch-II will have operations like a Simple-Model E.P. operations. This model is named Lock-Model E.P. It is equipped with 20 push buttons (as shown in fig. Part-C). It has two displays, two inlets, powered by battery cells and solar-cells, main tool out-let lead 'ol' and a powerful chip-xxx inside. This model is also issued by the govt. between public, for transferring figures. This E.P. if not able to produce figures. Only Part-A computer can produce figures, which is in the hands of Govt.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF TOOLS:<br>
BASIC LOGIC: All the transactions will be done in figures, instead of paper currency,<br>
v\ith the help of Electronic-Purses. Figures lo give and figures to take is the main objective of this ii venlion.<br>
LEAD:	The Lead 'ol' is the main weapon, which transfers figures from one E.P. to another E.P.<br>
E.P. :	E.P. means Electronic-Purse,<br>
IM :	Means Indian Money (Rupees) or International Money.<br>
CHANNELS:    There are two channels ch-I and ch-II in each E.P. to enhance it's capacity.<br>
Channels means chambers, or you can say pockets.<br>
B:     B stands for balance.<br>
DISPLAY:        There are two displays in all models. Neon-red 'nr' is upper display and LCD<br>
display 'Id' is lower one.<br>
F:	F. means freeze. Neon red display 'nr' is also activated. The same figures of lower<br>
display 'Id' are also visible on 'nr' display now. Each and every button is freezed on pressing F,<br>
except button A, for acceptance.<br>
CHANNEL SELECTOR: There is a channel selector 'cs', to select ch-I or ch-II<br>
PL:         Previous in figures / taken (+ figures). You can watch several number of received<br>
figures by pressing this button again and again.<br>
PO:        Previous out figures / given (- figures). You can watch several number of given figures<br>
by pressing this button again and again.<br>
A:	This button is meant to accept figures. When the button 'A' is pressed by the receiver<br>
E.P., only then the figures will be transferred in the receiver's E.P.<br>
C :        This button is meant for corrections.<br>
M+ :     To store the code number in the memory.<br>
FNC:    Feed New Code. You can change your code no with the help of this button.<br>
NUMERIC BUTTONS: There are 1 1 numeric /digit buttons. 1,2,3,4,5,6, 7,8,9,0 and (.).         (.)<br>
denotes decimal point.<br>
1-C,2-C and 3-C :These buttons are used to enter code nos. to produce figures.<br>
OK:    This button stores the secret code numbers entered by I-C, 2-C and 3-C.These buttons are<br>
placed in Part-A computer only.<br>
INLETS :There are two inlets 'il-P and 'il-2' on one side, to receive figures through the out-let<br>
lead 'ol'.<br><br>
HOW TO PRODUCE FIGURES:       ( Part-A )<br>
All the process is visible on lower LCD display Md' only.<br>
1 .   First of all check your balance. Press 'B'. There is no balance in it. We are going to produce figures for the first time on this computer. This is one and only one computer, which will remain in the hands of the Govt. It can produce figures as well as deliver figures. 2. Pull out the lead 'ol' from it's own inlet 'il-F.The computer becomes in ONN position, select channel ch-1, with the help of channel selector 'cs'.   3. First of all. 1st. Person (say Treasure Minister) presses button FNC and then any code no., using dot inbetween also, for greater security. Then press        , (M+).The screen is washed away, and the code no. is stored in the memory. 4. Now the second stage process starts. Now the 2nd. Person (say governor RB) writes any secret code no. in diary-1 . Now he presses 1-C button and then the same code no. which is written in the diary- 1, and then OK button. The code no. is feeded in the computer and the figures are washed away. Now place this secret diary- 1 in the safe of some bank. Now the 3rd.person (say Prime Minister) writes any secret code no. in diary-2 and then he presses 2-C button and then presses the same code no. on the computer, which is written in the diary-2. Then OK button is pressed. The figures are washed away from the lower display 'Id' and the second code no. is stored in the computer, and the second secret diary-2 is also placed in the safe of some other bank. Now the 4th person (say Finance Minister) writes any secret no. in diaryo.Then he presses 3-C button and then presses the<br>
same code no. on the computer, which is written in the diary-3. Then OK button is pressed. And the third secret code diary-3 is placed in some other bank. The code diaries are placed in different banks for greater safety. In future, figures could be produced with the help of these code diaries only.   5. Now the 5th person (say President) produces the needed number of figures/I.M./Rupees, by pressing the button IM, and digit 9 several times, say 9,99,99,99,99,99,99,999-sixteen times, and then button 'F'. The upper neon-red display 'nr' is activated now and all other buttons are freezed except button A . Now you can read clearly the same figures on both the displays. Now put the out-let lead 'oP in any inlet 'il-For 'il-2'in it's own computer. Button A is pressed to accept figures. An indication beep is given by the computer, and the process is completed .Figures are produced. Now only the Ist, person (Treasure-Minister) can transfer these figures, to another E.P,, using the secret code no. and process written in the next sheet. Only the 1st. person can change it's code no. any time, by using the process FNC, written on further pages,under columns 1-T, 2-T,3-T,4-T,5-T and 6-T. Now for the second time, figures can be produced by entering the code nos. in the Part-A computer, which are written in the secret diaries. Now these figures will be distributed among all the banks, in the whole country through Electronic-Purses Part-B and Part-C (as shown in the figure ).    6. Further these figures will reach in the hands of public via banks, through E.P.'s.<br>
WORKING OF A SIMPLE- MODEL E.P. (Part-B)      Fig-2<br>
Part-B is a small E.P. resembling a calculator. It has 16 push buttons. It has dual power of battery and solar cells. Two displays 'nr' and 'Id'. It works with the help of a chip-xx inside. Two channels, two inlets, one outlet lead , and ail other features as-shown in the figure Part-B.<br>
Check your balance, by pressing the button B. The figures will be visible on lower LCD 'Id' display. Suppose balance is 93.55 in channel ch-I and 40.50 in ch-II. Pull out the out-let lead 'of from it's own in-let .Select channel ch-I .Suppose you have to pay 32.40. Press IM, press Three Two Dot Four Zero and then press F. Neon-red 'nr' display is activated now. All buttons are freezed, except button A. Now you can watch 32.40 on both the displays. Now put the out-let 'ol' lead in the receiver's in-let. The receiver will press the button A on his own E.P. to accept the amount. An indication beep is given by the receiver E.P. The process is complete. Figures are transferred from one E.P. to another E.P. Put the outlet lead in the inlet of your own E.P. Now you can check your balance, by pressing B. You will find 61.15 in ch-I and 40.50 in ch-II. Amount 32.40 is paid. This E.P. is not able to produce figures, it can transfer figures only, from one E.P. to another E.P.<br>
WORKING OF A LOCK-MODEL E.P. (Part-C)      Fig-3<br>
Part-C is a pocket size E.P. It has 20 push-buttons to operate. It has two channels{ch-l)and ch-II. Channel ch-I will be-operated with the help of code no. The owner will be able to change it's own code no. by using FNC button . Channel ch-II will have operations like the simple- model E.P. operations (above written),It has two inlets, two displays and a outlet lead. Chip-xxx inside. Dual power of battery and solar cells. And all other features as shown in the drawing (Part-C).<br>
This E.P. is not able to produce figures, it can transfer figures only, from one E.P. to another E.P.<br>
1 -T. You can check your balance at any time, in any channel, by pressing the button B -        Say 1940.95 in ch-I and 9000 in ch-II. Suppose you have to pay 1430.57 for a piece of blanket, to the shop-keeper. 2-T. Pull out the lead'ol'from the inlet il-1 . E.P. will come in ONN position. 3-T. Press your code no. say 2116,6789 .Press IM button. Code no. is<br>
washed away. Press One Four Three Zero Dot Five Seven. You can read 1430.57 on 'Id' display only.(4-T)Press button F. Upper display neon-red 'nr' is activated now. You can read 1430.57 on both the displays clearly. All other buttons are also freezed, except button A .  (5-T) Now put the out-let lead 'ol' in the inlet of shop-keeper's E.P. The shopkeeper will press button A on it's own E.P., to accept the amount. Receiver E.P. will give an indication beep. The shop-keeper can watch the received figures 1430.57 on it's own E.P. on neon-red 'nr' display for a few seconds, then these figures will be washed away. If the shop-keeper wishes to watch the amount once again, he can watch them by pressing the button PI on his own E.P. If you wish to check the given amount, press PO.  PI and PO buttons will work only, when the out-let lead is pulled out from it's inlet. And the figures are visible on lower 'Id' display only. (6-T)Now you will find 510.38 balance in ch-1 ,while the balance in ch-II is the same 9000 .The process is complete, put your lead 'ol' in the inlet of your own E.P.<br>
Process  FNC:     Means Feed New Code<br>
First of all check your balance in Lock-Model E.P. in ch-L, say 200.30 and 345.45 in<br>
ch-II. Select channel ch-I, with the help of channel selector 'sc'. 2. Pull out the lead 'ol' from<br>
it's inlet. Now E.P. has come into ONN position . 3 . Press your code no., say 10167.12. Code<br>
no. is visible on the 'Id' screen.    4.  Press IM button. Code no. is washed away. Press digits<br>
Two Zero Zero Dot Three Zero. Press button F. Upper neon red 'nr' display is also activated and<br>
all other buttons are freezed, except button A. You can read clearly the same amount, on both<br>
displays. 5. Put the out-let lead 'ol' in it's own inlet 'il-2'.Press button A for acceptance. An<br>
indication beep is given .Channel ch-I is clear now. Total figures are transferred in ch-II.. Now<br>
you can check the balance in ch-II, it will be 545.75 .       6. Press FNC button, screen is clear.<br>
Old code no. is erased. Now feed a new code no. in it. Press button M+ now. New code no. is<br>
stored in the memory .   7. Now you can transfer any amount from ch-II, to ch-I with simple<br>
procedure (as written above), because channel ch-II is without lock system.   8. The above<br>
written process is also applicable in figure producer computer Part-A .	<br>
CAUTION: No amount / figure can exceed the Balance-B. If any figure exceeding balance, is pressed, then the E.P. will give a warning beep, and no action will take place. To start again, put the out-let lead in it's own inlet, and then proceed.<br>
When the out-let lead 'oi' is held in any in-let, the E.P. will remain in stand by position, buttons A and B will remain activated only, and all other buttons are inactivated.<br>
After pressing the button F, all buttons are freezed, except the button A . Always keep the out-let lead 'ol' in it's own in-let 'il-P or 'il-2'.<br>
Inlet 'il-1' will receive figures for channel 'ch-I' and 'il-2'will receive figures for channel 'ch-II'.<br>
When the outlet lead 'ol' is put into any E.P.'s inlet 'il-1' or 'il-2', all the buttons of that E.P. are also inactivated, except buttons B and A,<br>
If any inlet is engaged by outlet lead 'ol', even then the second inlet is able to receive figures.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
