THE PATENTS ACT 1970<br>
[39 OF 1970]<br>
&amp;<br>
THE PATENTS RULES, 2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"A lid structure for a vehicle<br>
HONDA   GIKEN   KOGYO   KABUSHIKI   KAISHA,   a   corporation   of   Japan,    1-1 Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br>
This invention relates to a vehicle wherein an oil supplying lid is provided on a step floor.<br>
[0002]<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
Some vehicles such as a scooter, include a lid on a step floor on which the driver places its feet. As one of vehicles of the type mentioned, for example, the official gazette of Japanese Patent Laid-Open NO. 150768 "Structure of Elements around Lid for Maintenance for Scooter-Type Vehicle (hereinafter referred to as "prior art) is known.<br>
[0003]<br>
The prior art described above includes, as shown in Figs. 1, 3 and 6 of the official gazette mentioned above, a maintenance led 1 (as the reference numeral, that used<br><br>
in the official gazette is used. This similarly applies in the following description.) with which a recess 26 provided under a step floor 11 of a scooter 1. The lid 13 is screwed to the step floor 11.<br>
The recess 26 has, as shown in Fig. 6, a through-hole 22 perforated therein and has an electric equipment accommodation portion 24 formed therein adjacent to the through-hole 22. A plug wrench 21 is inserted into the through-hole 22 in order to check a spark plug for an engine.<br>
[0004]<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
According to the prior art described above, both of the through-hole 22 and the electric part accommodation portion 24 are closed up with the single maintenance lid 13.  In other words, the single lid 13 plays a role of a lid for the through-hole 22 and also a role of a lid for the electric equipment accommodation portion 24. Accordingly, since the lid 13 increases in size and also in weight, the burden in operation increases. Besides, each time the lid 13 is opened, both the through-hole 22 and the electric equipment accommodation portion 24 open, which is cumbersome.  Furthermore, since both of the through-hole 22 and the electric equipment accommodation<br><br>
portion 24 are covered up with the single lid 13 on the step floor 11 of a limited space, the degree of freedom in designing is restricted.<br>
[0005]<br>
In the prior art having such a configuration as described above, if the electric equipment accommodation portion 24 is replaced with, for example, an oil supplying port of a fuel tank, then each time the lid 13 is opened to supply oil, also the through-hole 22 is opened. Although the checking frequency of the spark plug for an engine is very low when compared with the oil supplying frequency, it is misleading and cumbersome to open the through-hole 22 each time oil is supplied.<br>
[0006]<br>
Furthermore, since the oil supplying frequency is comparatively high, it is cumbersome to remove the screwed lid 13 each time oil is supplied.  Therefore, usually a locking apparatus which unlocks by a key operation is provided for the lid 13 in place of the screw fastening structure. A locking apparatus of such a comparatively large size that it is popped up by a key operation is popularly used as the locking apparatus. Accordingly, when   the  lid  13   is  opened  or closed,   an increased operating force by the locking apparatus is<br><br>
required. Besides, since the locking apparatus projects downwardly from the lid 13, the space below the lid 13 decreases as much. As a result, the arrangement of the fuel tank is restricted and it becomes difficult to assure a tank capacity.<br>
[0007]<br>
Therefore, the object of the present invention resides in provision of a lid structure for a vehicle which facilitates an oil supplying operation and checking of the vehicle to maintain operation efficiency while the degree of freedom in designing is high.<br>
[0008]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
In order to attain the object described above, according to claim 1, a lid structure for a vehicle which includes an oil supplying lid on a step floor is characterized in that the vehicle includes a checking lid, which can be opened and closed when the oil supplying lid is open, provided on the step floor in a neighboring relationship with the oil supplying lid.<br>
[0009]<br>
Since the two lids of the oil supplying lid and the checking lid are provided in a neighboring relationship to each other on the step floor, upon supplying of oil,<br><br>
only the oil supplying lid may be opened. Since the oil supplying lid is opened only upon supplying of oil, it can be formed with a smell size and a light weight to the utmost, and therefore, an oil supplying operation is facilitated.  Besides, since the oil supplying lid and the checking lid are provided separately, the degree of freedom in designing is augmented.<br>
Further, since, only when the oil supplying lid is opened, the checking lid can be opened and closed to restrict opening and closing of the checking lid so that, only when necessary for a checking operation, the checking lid is opened and closed, the checking lid need not be opened each time an oil supplying operation is to be preformed. Accordingly, supplying of oil does not suffer from misleading or cumbersome and the operation efficiency is high. [0010]<br>
According to claim 2, a lid structure for a vehicle which includes an oil supplying lid on a step floor is characterized in that the vehicle includes a fuel tank, whose oil supplying cap can be opposed to an open portion when the oil supplying lid is open, provided below the step floor and a locking apparatus is provided for the oil supplying cap such that, after the oil supplying lid<br><br>
engaged with the step floor is open and then the locking apparatus of the oil supplying cap is unlocked, the oil supplying cap can be turned and removed from the fuel tank.<br>
Since the oil supplying cap includes the locking apparatus which is compact and inexpensive, the oil supplying lid is light in weight and the operation efficiency is high, and besides, a space below the oil supplying lid can be assured.  As a result, the restriction to the arrangement of the fuel tank is moderated and the tank capacity can be assured readily. Besides, the fuel tank or the oil supplying lid need not project upwardly from the step floor in order to assure the tank capacity. [0011]<br>
Claim 3 is characterized in that the oil supplying cap has a key insertion hole provided at a substantially central position thereof and has a cap turning knob portion provided at a diametrically outer position with respect to the key insertion hole thereof.<br>
Even in a state wherein a key is inserted in the key insertion hole, the knob portion can be held to turn the oil supplying cap. Accordingly, when compared with an alternative arrangement wherein an outer peripheral face<br><br>
of the cap is held and turned, the operability in oil supplying operation can be further raised.<br>
[0012]<br>

If the oil supplying lid 90 engaged with the step floor 33 is opened and the oil supplying cap 100 is exposed from the open portion 81 when the oil supplying lid 90 is opened, then the key 114 can be inserted into the key insertion hole 112 of the oil supplying cap 100. [0033]<br>
Fig. 14 is a perspective view (part 2) of essential part of elements around the step floor, oil supplying lid and oil supplying cap according to the present invention and shows a state wherein the oil supplying cap 100 is<br><br>
removed from the oil supplying port 42a of the fuel tank 42.<br>
The oil supplying port 42a includes two engaging recesses 42b, 42b.  If the oil supplying cap 100 is turned and the engaging projections 115, 115 of the oil supplying cap 100 are disengaged from the engaging recesses 42b, 42b, then the oil supplying cap 100 can be removed from the fuel tank 42. [0034]<br>
Fig. 15 is a perspective view of essential part of elements around the step floor and the checking liquid according to the present invention and shows a state wherein the checking lid 130 is removed.<br>
The checking lid 130 is opened when the engine ignition plug 318 is to be checked. [0035]<br>
Fig. 16 is a plan view of the step floor according to the present invention and shows that the oil supplying lid 90 is provided at a rear portion at the center in the widthwise direction of the step floor 33 and the checking lid 130 which leftwardly neighbors the oil supplying lid 90 is provided on the step floor 33. [0036]<br>
Fig. 17 is a perspective view of the checking lid<br><br>
according to the present invention.<br>
The checking lid 130 has a horizontal flat lid portion 131 and a rear wall portion 135 extending upwardly from a rear end of the lid portion 131.<br>
The lid portion 131 serves also as part of the step floor 33 (refer to Fig. 16) and has an engaging portion 132 extending to the neighboring oil supplying lid 90 side, a finger hooking portion 133 of a reversed L-shape extending upwardly from an end portion of the engaging portion 132, and two arresting pawl portions 134, 134 extending downwardly from an edge of the lid portion 131, all formed integrally with each other.  The finger hooking portion 133 is hooked and pulled up by a finger of a hand when the lid portion 131 is to be removed.<br>
The rear wall portion 135 has two arresting pawl portions 136, 136 extending downwardly from a rear end thereof and formed integrally therewith. [0037]<br>
Fig. 18 is a sectional view taken along line 18-18 of Fig. 16 and shows a state wherein a checking hole 83 of the step floor 33 is closed up with the checking lid 130.<br>
The checking lid 130 in the closed state is engaged with the step floor 33 with the arresting pawl portions<br><br>
134, 134 thereof hooked with an edge portion 84 of the checking hole 83 and has the engaging portion 132 thereof placed on an upper face of the step floor 33.<br>
When the oil supplying lid 90 is closed, an edge portion 93 of the oil supplying lid 90 is placed into a state wherein it is fitted on the engaging portion 132. Accordingly, the checking lid 130 can be opened or closed when the oil supplying lid 90 is opened. [0038]<br>
A procedure of supplementing fuel into the fuel tank 42 is described with reference to Figs. 12 to 14.<br>
First, if a knob 92 is pulled in the direction of an arrow mark (1) to disengage the hooked portion 91 (refer to Fig. 9) and to open the oil supplying lid 90 in the direction of an arrow mark (2) in Fig. 12, then the oil supplying lid 90 engaged with the step floor 33 is opened. As a result, the oil supplying cap 100 is exposed from the open portion 81 when the oil supplying lid 90 is opened as seen in Fig. 13. [0039]<br>
Then, the key 114 is inserted into the key insertion hole 112 of the oil supplying cap 100 in Fig.<br>
13 and then turned clockwise (arrow mark (3)) to place the locking apparatus 111 into an unlocking state, and then<br><br>
the knob portions 113, 113 are held to turn the oil supplying cap 100 counterclockwise (arrow mark (4))   to open the oil supplying cap 100.<br>
As described above, the oil supplying cap 100 has the key insertion hole 112 at a substantially central position thereof and includes the cap turning knob portions 113, 113 at diametrically outer positions of the key insertion hole 112.  Even in a state wherein the key 114 is inserted in the key insertion hole 112, the cap turning knob portions 113, 113 can be held to turn the oil supplying cap 100. Accordingly, when compared with an alternative arrangement wherein an outer peripheral face of the oil supplying cap 100 is held and turned, the operability in oil supplying operation can be further raised.<br>
Further, since the locking apparatus 111 is of a simple type wherein the key 114 is inserted into the key insertion hole 112 to cancel the engagement of the key pawl, it is comparatively small in size and low in weight. Accordingly, a space below the oil supplying lid 90 can be assured. As a result, the restriction to the arrangement of the fuel tank 42 is moderated, and a tank capacity can be assured readily. [0040]<br><br>
Furthermore, since the locking apparatus 111 is proved on the oil supplying cap 100, a locking apparatus need not be provided for the oil supplying lid 90. Therefore, since the oil supplying lid 90 is reduced in weight, opening and closing operations of the oil supplying lid 90 are further facilitated.  Accordingly, the oil supplying operation can be facilitated and the operation efficiency can be raised.  In particular, since the oil supplying cap 100 includes the locking apparatus 111 which is compact and inexpensive, the oil supplying lid 90 is light in weight and the operation efficiency is high.<br>
Further, since the oil supplying lid 90 does not include a locking apparatus, the space below the oil supplying lid 90 can be assured as much. As a result, the restriction to the arrangement of the fuel tank 42 is moderated and the tank capacity can be assured readily. Besides, the fuel tank 42 or the oil supplying lid 90 need not project upwardly from the step floor 33 in order to assure the tank capacity. [0041]<br>
After the oil supplying lid 90 engaged with the step floor 33 is opened and the locking apparatus 111 of the oil supplying cap 100 is brought into an unlocking<br><br>
state in this manner, the oil supplying cap 100 can be turned and removed from the fuel tank 42 and fuel can be supplemented into the fuel tank 42. [0042]<br>
After the supplementation of fuel is completed, the engaging projections 115 of the oil supplying cap 100 are registered with the engaging recesses 42b of the oil supplying port 42a in Fig. 14 (arrow mark (5)) and the oil supplying cap 100 is turned clockwise.<br>
Then, the key 114 is turned counterclockwise<br>
(direction opposite to the arrow mark (3)) in Fig. 13 to place the locking apparatus 111 into a locking state. Then, after the key 114 is pulled off, the oil supplying lid 90 is closed. [0043]<br>
Now, a procedure of checking the ignition plug is described with reference to Figs. 12 and 15.<br>
First, the knob 92 is pulled in the direction of the arrow mark (1) in Fig. 12 to disengage the hooked portion 91 (refer to Fig. 9) and open the oil supplying lid 90 in the direction of the arrow mark (2)  thereby to open the oil supplying lid 90 engaged with the step floor 33.<br>
Then, the arresting pawl portions 134, 134 and 136,<br><br>
136 engaged with the step floor 33 are disengaged to open the checking lid 130 in Fig. 15. Then, maintenance or checking operation for the plug cap 317 and/or the engine ignition plug 318 is performed. [0044]<br>
After the maintenance or checking operation is completed, the arresting pawl portions 134, 134 and 136, 136 are engaged with the step floor 33 in Fig. 15 to close the checking lid 130.  Thereafter, the oil supplying lid 90 is closed as shown in Fig. 12.<br>
In this manner, only when the oil supplying lid 90 is opened, the checking lid 130 can be opened and closed. Opening and closing of the checking lid 130 are restricted, and only when necessary, the checking lid 130 can be opened and closed. [0045]<br>
As apparent from the foregoing description, since the two lids of the oil supplying lid 90 and the checking lid 130 are provided in a neighboring relationship to each other on the step floor 33, upon supplying of oil, only the oil supplying lid 90 may be opened.  Since the oil supplying lid 90 is opened only upon supplying of oil, it can be formed with a small size and a light weight to the utmost, and therefore, an oil supplying operation is<br><br>
facilitated.  Besides, since the oil supplying lid 90 and the checking lid 130 are provided separately, the degree of freedom in designing is augmented.<br>
[0046]<br>
Furthermore, since, only when the oil supplying lid 90 is opened, the checking lid 130 can be opened and closed to restrict opening and closing of the checking lid 130 so that, only when necessary for a checking operation, the checking lid 130 is opened and closed, the checking lid 130 need not be opened each time an oil supplying operation is to be preformed. Accordingly, supplying of oil does not suffer from misleading or cumbersome and the operation efficiency is high.<br>
[0047]<br>
Fig. 19 is a perspective view of elements around a main switch attaching portion according to the present invention and shows a configuration within which the main switch 41 is attached to the head pipe 11a by means of a screw from the right side of the vehicle body.

The leg shield cover 160 is engaged with the leg shield 32 by placing it to a location around the opening 32a of the leg shield 32 and hooking the leg shield cover 160 to the edge of the opening 32a with arresting pawl portions 162, ..., and an attaching boss 164 is attached to the leg shield 32 by means of a screw 163 as shown in Fig. 21(c) . [0054]<br><br>
Fig. 22 is a left side elevational view of a front half portion of the motorcycle according to the present invention and shows that a front brake cable 171 and a speedometer cable 175 are passed through spaces in the front and rear side handle covers 56F and 56R, a space between the front cover 31 and the leg shield 32 and a space within the front fender 59.<br>
The front brake cable 171 is a wire cable for interconnecting a front brake 176 of the front wheel 13 side and the right side brake lever 52R (refer to Fig.20). The speedometer cable 175 is a wire cable for interconnecting a speed sensor 177 of the front wheel 13 side and the meter panel 53 of the handle bar side. [0055]<br>
The front feeder 59 has a cable guide 190 provided on an inner face thereof such that the front brake cable 171 and the speedometer cable 175 are guided by the cable guide 190.  In the following, an attaching structure for the cable guide 190 is described. [0056]<br>
Figs. 23(a) and (b) are schematic views of the cable guide attaching structure according to the present invention, and Fig. 23 (a/ shows a side elevational cross section of the cable guide attaching structure and Fig.<br><br>
23(b) shows a section in plan of the cable guide attaching structure.<br>
The front fender 59 indicated by a phantom line has a guide attaching portion 181 formed integrally at a portion in the proximity of a lower end thereof.  The guide attaching portion 181 has a guide insertion port 184 of a tapered configuration as viewed in side elevation, a transverse guideway 185 connecting to a tapering portion of the guide insertion port 184 and extending rearwardly, and a longitudinal guideway 186 extending vertically perpendicularly intermediately of the longitudinal direction of the transverse guideway 185, all formed on a vertical wall portion 183 extending longitudinally substantially along a fender side wall 182. The width of the transverse guideway 185 and the width of the longitudinal guideway 186 are substantially equal to each other. Accordingly, projections 187, ... are formed at the four corners at which the transverse guideway 185 and the longitudinal guideway 186 cross each other. [0057]<br>
An attaching portion 192 of the cable guide 190 which is elongated and constructed as shown in Fig. 23(a) has a width dimension substantially equal to the width of the transverse guideway 185 or the longitudinal guideway<br><br>
186.  The attaching portion 192 can be fitted into the longitudinal guideway 186 to attach the cable guide 190 to the guide attaching portion 181. [0058]<br>
Fig. 24 is a sectional view taken along line 24-24 of Fig. 23 and shows that the cable guide 190 is provided on the inner face of the front fender 59 and the cables 171 and 175 are guided by threading the front brake cable 171 and the speedometer cable 175 into an annual guide portion 193 of the cable guide 190.<br>
Since the cable guide 190 is provided on the inner face of the front fender 59, the cable guide 190 cannot be visually observed from the outside of the front fender 59. Accordingly, the appearance is good.<br>
It is to be noted that reference numeral 188 denotes a coupling portion for integrally coupling the vertical wall portion 183 to the fender side wall 182. [0059]<br>
Figs. 25(a) and (b) are schematic views of the cable guide according to the present invention, and Fig. 25(a) shows a structure in plan of the cable guide 190 and Fig. 25(b) shows a structure in side elevation of the cable guide 190.<br>

Figs. 26(a) to (c) are views illustrating an attaching procedure of the cable guide according to the present invention.<br>
In order to attach the cable guide 190, the front brake cable 171 and the speedometer cable 175 are threaded into the guide portion 193 in advance in Fig. 26(a). Then, the attaching portion 192 is inserted in a horizontal direction into the guide insertion port 184.<br>
Then in Fig. 26(b), the cable guide 190 is turned by 90" so that the attaching portion 192 is directed in a vertical direction. As a result, the attaching portion 192 can be set to the longitudinal guideway 186 as seen in Fig. 26(c).  The thus set cable guide 190 is restricted<br><br>
from rotation by the projections 187, ....  In this manner, the cable guide 190 can be attached to the front fender 59 easily. [0061]<br>
Since the cable guide 190 does not turn, it can hold the front brake cable 171 and the speedometer cable 175.  Particularly, the cables 171 and 175 above the cable guide 190 can be held so as not to vibrate as seen in Fig.22, and as a result, the movable range of the cables 171 and 175 can be restricted to a small range. [0062]<br>

front edge portion 203 at the front end of the shield upper cover 202 between the inner face of the edge portion 31a and the pawl portion 31b. [0063]<br>
Figs. 28(a) to (c) are views showing an attaching structure of the shield upper cover according to the present invention, and Fig. 28(a) is a view of a configuration wherein a front half portion of the opening 201 between the front cover 31 and the leg shield 32 is closed up with the shield upper cover 202, Fig. 28(b) a perspective view of the shield upper cover 202, and Fig. 28(c) a sectional view taken along line c-c of Fig. 28(b).<br>
In Fig. 28(b), the shield upper cover 202 has the front edge portion 2 03 formed at the front end thereof, has upwardly and downwardly offset arresting lugs 204, 204 formed on the opposite left and right sides of the rear end thereof and has arresting pawl portions 205, 205 (only the left one is shown) formed at the left and right side ends thereof.  The arresting lugs 204, 204 are adapted to be hooked on the edge of the opening 201 on the leg shield 32 side shown in Fig. 28(c). [0064]<br>
As shown in Figs. 28(a) and (c), the shield upper cover 202 can be attached simply to the leg shield 32 by<br><br>
placing the shield upper cover 202 on the leg shield 32 and then hooking the arresting pawl portions 205 on an edge of an arresting hole 32b of the leg shield 32.<br>
As shown in Fig. 28(a), since a front portion of the opening 201 is closed up with the shield upper cover 202, only a rear portion of the opening 201 through which a pipe of the handle bar 14 should pass is open. [0065]<br>
In this manner, since cables such as the front brake cable 171 and the speedometer cable 175 shown in Fig. 22 can be threaded into the large opening 201 which is in a state not closed up with the shield upper cover 202, a cable assembling operability can be assured. After the cable assembling operation is completed, since the front half portion of the opening 201 is closed up with the shield upper cover 202, the appearance of the motorcycle 10 can be augmented. [0066]<br>
It is to be noted that, in the embodiment of the present invention described above, the vehicle 10 is not limited to a scooter type motorcycle, but may be, for example, a scooter type motor-tricycle or a scooter type four-wheel car. [0067]<br><br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
The present invention exhibits the following effects because it has the configuration described above.<br>
According to claim 1, since two lids of an oil supplying lid and a checking lid are provided in a neighboring relationship to each other on a step floor, upon supplying of oil, only the oil supplying lid may be opened.  Since the oil supplying lid is opened only upon supplying of oil, it can be formed with a small size and a light weight to the utmost, and therefore, an oil supplying operation is facilitated.  Besides, since the oil supplying lid and the checking lid are provided separately, the degree of freedom in designing is augmented.<br>
Further, since, only when the oil supplying lid is opened, the checking lid can be opened and closed to restrict opening and closing of the checking lid so that, only when necessary for a checking operation, the checking lid is opened and closed, the checking lid need not be opened each time an oil supplying operation is to be preformed. Accordingly, supplying of oil does not suffer from misleading or cumbersome and the operation efficiency is high.<br>
In this manner, a lid structure for a vehicle which<br><br>
facilitates an oil supplying operation and checking of the vehicle to maintain operation efficiency while the degree of freedom in designing is high can be provided. [0068]<br>
Claim 2 is characterized in that the fuel tank, whose oil supplying cap can be opposed to an open portion when an oil supplying lid provided on a step floor is open, is provided below the step floor and a locking apparatus is provided for the oil supplying cap such that, after the oil supplying lid engaged with the step floor is open and then the locking apparatus of the oil supplying cap is unlocked, the oil supplying cap can be turned and removed from the fuel tank.<br>
Since the oil supplying cap includes the locking apparatus which is compact and inexpensive, the oil supplying lid is light in weight and the operation efficiency is high, and besides, a space below the oil supplying lid can be assured. As a result, the restriction to the arrangement of the fuel tank is moderated and the tank capacity can be assured readily. Besides, the fuel tank or the oil supplying lid need not project upwardly from the step floor in order to assure the tank capacity.<br>
In this manner, a lid structure for a vehicle which<br><br>
facilitates an oil supplying operation and checking of the vehicle to maintain operation efficiency while the degree of freedom in designing is high can be provided. [0069]<br>
According to claim 3, the oil supplying cap has a key insertion hole provided at a substantially central position thereof and has a cap turning knob portion provided at a diametrically outer position with respect to the key insertion hole thereof.  Therefore, even in a state wherein a key is inserted in the key insertion hole, the knob portion can be held to turn the oil supplying cap.
