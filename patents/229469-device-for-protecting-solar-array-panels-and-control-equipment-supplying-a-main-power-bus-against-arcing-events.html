				<td>DEVICE FOR PROTECTING SOLAR ARRAY PANELS AND CONTROL<br>
EQUIPMENT SUPPLYING A MAIN POWER BUS AGAINST ARCING EVENTS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to solar power sources, their regulators and<br>
in particular to a circuit to protect against arcing on solar panels or within the<br>
solar array drive mechanism (SADM) of a spacecraft.<br>
2.	Description of the Prior Art<br>
Solar array panels of a geostationary telecommunication satellite are<br>
maintained in a sunlight configuration by a solar array drive mechanism which<br>
rotates the array wings once every 24 hours. In order to transfer the power<br>
generated by the solar cells to the satellite on-board electrical system, a slip ring<br>
and pick-off brush assembly is incorporated within the solar array drive<br>
mechanism. Such a slip ring comprises concentrical conductor rings separated<br>
by insulating barriers.<br>
A classical power system of a spacecraft comprises a power regulator for<br>
regulating the voltage of the main power bus of the spacecraft. This regulator<br>
includes several power dump stages which are used to shunt the excess of solar<br>
array current in order to generate a regulated voltage. A power dump stage is<br>
disclosed in the US patent 4 186 336. A functionally equivalent circuit using a<br>
more recent technology is shown in Fig. 1. This stage is either in a "Dump ON"<br>
or in a "Dump OFF" state controlled by a "DoD" (Dump on Drive) signal. The<br>
power dump stage 3 comprises a MOSFET transistor M10 connected between<br>
the solar array line and the ground, which shunts the solar array voltage when it<br>
is set in its ON state (corresponding to the Dump On state of the stage) by the<br>
DoD signal. This stage further comprises two serial blocking diodes D1, D2<br>
inserted in the line linking the solar array and the main power bus, so as to<br>
prevent current to flow back from the power bus to the power dump stage or the<br>
solar array.<br>
Over recent years, satellite power bus voltages have increased and several<br>
cases of power losses have been observed in satellite on-board electrical<br>
systems, resulting in a significant degradation of the spacecraft performances.<br>
These power losses have been attributed to damage caused by sustained voltage<br>
arcing occurring either on a solar array panel or even within the solar array<br>
drive mechanism causing the power loss of a full solar array wing. The<br><br>
initiating mechanism of this voltage arcing is usually attributed to some form of<br>
contamination. If metallic particles bridge across two electrical conductors<br>
(solar cells, slip rings) having a significant potential difference, the initial<br>
current flow will likely evaporate the metallic particle. Since classical<br>
spacecraft shunt regulators usually comprise two serial blocking diodes (Dl,<br>
D2) between the solar array and the main power bus, if an arcing event occurs<br>
that demands more current than the solar cells can provide, the solar array<br>
section voltage will collapse.<br>
After the fusing of the particle, the arc may extinguish, but if sufficient<br>
plasma still exists and localized damage has occurred, a sustained arcing event<br>
can be initiated. If the latter situation proves to be the case, the extreme heat<br>
generated by the arcing event will rapidly degrade any local insulation barrier<br>
and quickly results in a permanent short circuit condition, resulting in a<br>
permanent power loss for the spacecraft.<br>
The initial arcing potential can be low but as the material of the contact<br>
points are eroded away, the arc potential will typically increase.<br>
Although such an arcing event is known to be a rare occurrence, it is<br>
essential to prevent such arcing events in order to maintain the performance and<br>
required life span of satellites.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to minimize the risk of a significant<br>
power loss resulting from failure propagation following an uncontrolled arcing<br>
event on the solar array or within the solar array drive mechanism.<br>
This object is achieved by a device for protecting solar array panels and control<br>
equipment supplying a main power bus against arcing events, said control equipment<br>

According to the invention, this device comprises:<br>
a voltage drop detection circuit for detecting a voltage drop in the solar<br>
array voltage provided by said solar array panels, said voltage drop detection<br>

an arc-quenching circuit for generating an output signal which is applied as said<br>
control signal to the power dump stage so as to shunt said solar array voltage when a<br>
voltage drop is detected by said voltage drop detection circuit.<br><br>
According to an aspect of the invention, said arc-quenching circuit is designed<br>
for shaping said output signal so as to provide a short initial delay without any action<br>
subsequent to a voltage drop detection provided by said voltage drop detection signal,<br>
and after said initial delay an arc-quenching pulse which triggers said power dump<br>
stage so as to shunt said solar array voltage.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, said arc-quenching circuit<br>
further comprises a first monostable controlling said initial delay and a second<br>
monostable controlling the width of said arc-quenching pulse.<br>

about 19 ms and said arc-quenching pulse has a width set to about 1.7 s.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, said arc-quenching circuit is<br>
designed for starting a new quenching cycle including said initial delay followed by<br>
said arc-quenching pulse as long as the voltage drop detection circuit detects a voltage<br>
drop in said solar array voltage.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, said voltage drop<br>
detection circuit comprises means for comparing said solar array voltage to a<br>
main bus voltage.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, said arc-quenching circuit<br>
further comprises means for combining said control signal and said output<br>
signal before being applied to the power dump stage.<br>
The invention will be more clearly understood and other features and<br>
advantages of the invention will emerge from a reading of the following<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The major characteristics of the invention will now be detailed. Fig. 2<br>
depicts a protection device Associated to a voltage regulator 5 including the<br>
power dump stage 3 as the one shown in Fig. 1. According to the present<br>
invention the protection device comprises a voltage drop detection circuit 1 for<br>
detecting a voltage drop caused by an arcing event occurring in the solar array<br>
voltage, and an arc-quenching circuit 2 which uses a detection signal provided<br>
by the voltage drop detection circuit to generate a pulse which can activate the<br>
power dump circuit 3 into the "ON" state for a certain amount of time.<br>
The voltage drop detection circuit 1 is shown in detail in Fig. 3. This<br>
circuit comprises a transistor T1 of the type pnp having a base terminal<br>
connected to the solar array voltage Vs through a resistor Rl and to the bus<br>
voltage VB through a resistor R2, an emitter terminal connected to the bus<br>
voltage and a collector terminal providing a voltage drop detection signal VD. In<br>
normal operation, the base voltage of the transistor T1 is reversed biased so that<br>
the transistor is non-conducting. Thus, the collector (VD) of the transistor T1 is<br>
pulled down to 0 V. When an arc occurs, the solar array voltage drops, resulting<br>
in a potential difference between the solar array voltage and the bus voltage<br>
which is regulated. If this potential difference is greater than the natural base-<br>
emitter junction voltage of the transistor Tl (typically 0.7 V), the transistor Tl<br>
conducts and lets a current pass through it. As a result, the voltage drop is<br>
detected and the collector current passing through the transistor may be used to<br>
operate the power dump stage 3.<br>
For example, R1 = 470 Ω, R2 - 4,7 KΩ and T1 is a 2N2907A pnp<br>
transistor. Assuming a 50 V power bus voltage VB, with the exception of the<br>
voltage drop detection signal, every point in the circuit is around 50 V in<br>
normal operation and the base voltage of the transistor is reversed biased by<br>
1.4 V and its collector (VD) is thus at 0 V. When an arc occurs, the solar array<br>
voltage Vs can drop to approximately 35 V. Thus the potential difference<br>
between the solar array voltage and the bus voltage is approximately of 15 V.<br>
The transistor junction being ignored, the voltage drop VR2 over resistor R2 is:<br><br>
Under these conditions, transistor Tl conducts and the voltage drop<br>
detection signal VD at the collector of transistor Tl rises to approximately 11 V.<br>
It should be noted that alternative methods of detecting arcing events may<br>
be used. For instance, the loss of current from the solar array section could be<br><br>
the monitored parameter.<br>
The voltage drop detection signal VD is applied to the arc-quenching<br>
circuit 2 shown in detai] in Fig. A. This circuit is preferably designed to allow a<br>
short time without any action subsequent to a voltage drop detection, so as to<br>
give a chance for a possible short circuit material to evaporate. Then if the short<br>
circuit persists, this circuit is designed to quench any resultant arcing by short<br>
circuiting the applied voltage (solar array voltage Vs) for a much longer period,<br>
using the power dump stage 1.<br>
For this purpose, the arc-quenching circuit 3 comprises a dual monostable<br>
multivibrator which receives the voltage drop detection signal VD as a trigger<br>
signal to first trigger an initial short delay and then to generate a long duration<br>
pulse which sets the power dump stage 1 into the ON state for a certain amount<br>
of time.<br>
In Fig. 4, the arc-quenching circuit 3 includes two monostables 11, 12,<br>
each having two terminals RC and C for connecting the monostable to a parallel<br>
RC circuit comprising a capacitor C3, C4 connected between the terminals R<br>
and RC and a resistor R3, R4 connecting the RC terminal to the supply voltage<br>
produced by a resistor R5 and a zener diode Z1 mounted in parallel with a<br>
capacitor C1 and connected to the ground. Resistor R5 is chosen so as to<br>
provide a suitable current from the bus voltage to stimulate zener diode Z1, for<br>
example a 15 V device which is used to supply the monostables through a VDD<br>
terminal.<br>
Each monostable I1, 12 further comprises a positive +T and a negative -T<br>
trigger terminal for triggering the monostable. The negative trigger terminal of<br>
the first monostable I1 is connected to the supply voltage provided by zener<br>
diode Zl, whereas the positive trigger terminal of the second monostable 12 is<br>
connected to the ground. A signal applied to the negative trigger terminal -T<br>
will trigger the monostable only if it goes from high to low and reversely for a<br>
signal applied to the positive terminal +T.<br>
Each monostable II, 12 further comprises a direct output Q and an<br>
inverting output Q, the direct output Q of both the monostables being not used<br>
(not connected). The inverting output of the first monostable II is connected<br>
through a NAND gate G3 to the negative trigger terminal -T of the second<br>
monostable 12 and the inverting output of the latter is connected to the positive<br>
trigger terminal +T of the first monostable.<br>
Each monostable I1, 12 further comprises a ground terminal connected to<br>
ground and a Reset input tenrrinal, the Reset input terminal of the two<br>
monostables I1, 12 being connected to the other input of NAND gate G3 and<br><br>
receiving a signal from a NAND gate Gl through another NAND gate G2<br>
mounted as an inverter (both its inputs are connected to the output of gate Gl).<br>
One input of NAND gate Gl receives through a resistor R6 the voltage drop<br>
detection signal VD, the junction point between resistor R6 and gate G1 being<br>
connected to the ground through a resistor R7. The other input of gate Gl<br>
receives the DoD signal through a resistor R8 connected in parallel with a<br>
resistor R9 mounted in series with a diode D3 and is also connected to the<br>
ground through a capacitor C2. The DoD signal is also applied as an input to a<br>
NAND gate G4 whose other input is connected to the inverting output Q of the<br>
first monostable I1. The output of gate G4 is an output Vo of the quenching<br>
circuit and is used to drive the power dump stage 3 and in particular the<br>
MOSFET M10 of this stage.<br>
In a normal state, both the DoD signal and the output Q of the first<br>
monostable I1 are "high". Thus the output of gate G4 is "low".<br>
When the voltage drop detection circuit 1 detects a voltage drop in the<br>
solar array voltage, a voltage of about 11 V is applied to NAND gate Gl. Since<br>
by definition, the DoD signal applied to the other input of gate Gl is also in<br>
high state (no dumping), the gate G1 output then goes from "high" to "low".<br>
The output signal of gate G1 is inverted by gate G2 which generates a signal<br>
going from "low" to "high", this signal removing the imposed DC reset applied<br>
on both monostables I1, I2 and being applied to gate G3. The other input of this<br>
gate comes from the inverting output Q of the first monostable 11 which is<br>
normally "high". With both inputs "high", the output of gate G3 goes from<br>
"high" to "low". The inverting output Q of the first monostable I1 is also<br>
applied to the NAND gate G4 providing the signal Vo controlling the status of<br>
the power dump stage 3. Thus in this initial phase, the output of gate G4<br>
remains "low".<br>
Since the output signal of the gate G3 goes from "high" to "low" a<br>
negative going pulse is applied to the negative trigger terminal -T of the second<br>
monostable 12 triggering a negative going pulse on its the inverting output Q.<br>
Then monostable 12 stays in this state ("low") for a short period of time<br>
depending on the selected values of resistor R4 and capacitor C4, before<br>
triggering to the high state. When finally the inverting output Q of the second<br>
monostable I2 goes from "low" to "high" at the end of this short period of time,<br>
a positive going pulse is applied to the positive trigger terminal +T of the first<br>
monostable I1 which triggers a negative pulse on its inverting output Q . Then<br>
the first monostable I1 remains in the "low" state for a much longer period of<br>
time depending again of the selected values of resistor R3 and capacitor C3.<br><br>
Since the inverting output Q of the first monostable I1 is directly connected to<br>
gate G4, the signal Vo applied to the power dump stage 3 (output of gate G4)<br>
goes from "low" to high". Thus the stage 3 turns to its ON state (MOSFET M10<br>
conducting), removing the voltage source (solar array voltage) from the initial<br>
arcing event. When finally at the end of the longer period of time the state of<br>
the inverting output Q of the first monostable I1 goes from "low" to "high", the<br>
output of gate G4 goes from "high" to "low" turning the power dump stage 3 to<br>
its OFF state (no dumping).<br>
It should be noted that thanks to gates G1 and G4, the arc-quenching<br>
circuit 3 operates in parallel to the normal DoD regulation signal, gate Gl<br>
preventing the circuit from triggering under nominal dump control conditions.<br>
The monostables I1 and I2 can be implemented by a single dual<br>
monostable CMOS integrated circuit such as the CD4098. Equally, the four<br>
NAND gates G1-G4 can be implemented by a single integrated circuit such as<br>
the CD4093.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates the operation of the above-described protection device. In<br>
this figure, the upper trace 11 displays as a function of time the solar array<br>
voltage Vs which falls to 0 V as a direct shortcut is created on arcing contact<br>
points. When these points are subsequently opened due to evaporation of short<br>
circuit material, trace 11 then presents a rising edge depicting the initiation of<br>
an arc. The middle trace 12 displays as a function of time the output voltage VD<br>
of the voltage drop detection circuit 1. As soon as the solar array voltage drop<br>
has been detected, the voltage drop detection signal presents a rising edge<br>
activating the arc-quenching circuit 2. The lower trace 13 shows as a function of<br>
time the output signal Vo of the arc-quenching circuit applied to the power<br>
dump stage 3. The initial delay from voltage drop detection during which the<br>
arc-quenching circuit does not react should be long enough to successfully clear<br>
any shortcut conductive material, but not too large since the longer the arc goes<br>
on, the greater will be the damage on the arcing site. This initial delay is<br>
followed by an arc-quenching pulse which extinguishes the arc as shown by<br>
upper trace 11, by clamping the solar array voltage to near 0 V (the power dump<br>
stage 3 is set to its ON state). This arc-quenching pulse has to last some time in<br>
order to allow the plasma to disperse and the arcing site to cool down so as to<br>
prevent the arc from re-establishing. At the end of the arc-quenching pulse the<br>
quenching-circuit 2 sets the power dump stage 3 to its OFF state. Thus the solar<br>
voltage is re-established and the output voltage of the voltage drop detection<br>
circuit 1 returns to 0 V.<br>
In the example of Fig. 5, the initial delay from the voltage drop detection<br><br>
to the arc-quenching pulse generation is set to 150 ms whereas the arc-<br>
quenching pulse width is limited to 90 ms, these values being obtained with<br>
R3 = R4 = 1 MΩ, C3 = 0.22 µF and C4 - 0.47 µF.<br>
Figs. 6 and 7 show the initial delay and arc-quenching pulse delay<br>
produced by the arc-quenching circuit 2. In these Figures the upper traces 14,<br>
16 and lower traces 15, 17 show as a function of time respectively the output<br>
voltage VD of the voltage drop detection circuit 1, and the output voltage VG of<br>
the arc-quenching circuit 2, the time scale being set to 200 ms in Fig. 6 and 1 s<br>
in Fig. 7. In the example of Figs. 6 and 7, the initial delay from the voltage drop<br>
detection to the arc-quenching pulse generation is set to 170 ms whereas the<br>
arc-quenching pulse width is set to 1.7 s, these values being obtained with<br>
R3 = R4 = 1 MΩ, C3 = 4.7 µF and C4 = 0.47 µF.<br>
Fig. 7 shows that if the solar array voltage Vs stays "low" after the first<br>
arc-quenching pulse, as detected by the voltage drop detection circuit 1, a new<br>
quenching cycle starts with an initial delay followed by an arc-quenching pulse.<br>
This quenching cycle is repeated as long as the voltage drop detection circuit 1<br>
detects a voltage drop between the solar array voltage Vs and the bus voltage<br>
VB.<br>
Figs. 8 and 9 show the initial delay and arc-quenching pulse delay<br>
produced by the arc-quenching circuit 2. In these Figures the upper traces 18,<br>
21	show as a function of time the solar array voltage Vs. The middle traces 19,<br>
22	show as a function of time the output signal VD of the voltage drop detection<br>
circuit 1. The lower traces 20, 22 show as a function of time the output voltage<br>
V0 of the arc-quenching circuit 2, the time scale being set to 20 ms in Fig. 8 and<br>
1 s in Fig. 9. In the example of Figs. 8 and 9, the initial delay from the voltage<br>
drop detection to the arc-quenching pulse generation is set to 19 ms whereas the<br>
arc-quenching pulse width is set to 2.6 s, these values being obtained with<br>
R3 = R4 = 1MΩ, C3 = 6.8 µF and C4 = 0.1 µF. Again Fig. 9 shows that a new<br>
quenching cycle is started as long as the solar array voltage Vs (as detected by<br>
the voltage drop detection circuit 1) remains low after an arc-quenching pulse.<br>
The preferred values for the initial delay and the arc-quenching pulse<br>
width are respectively 19 ms and 1.7 s which are obtained with<br>
R3 = R4 = 1 MΩ, C3 = 4.7 µF and C4 = 0.1 µF.<br><br>
