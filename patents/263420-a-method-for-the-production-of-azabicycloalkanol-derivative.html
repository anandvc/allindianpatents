DESCRIPTION<br>
TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROCESS FOR PRODUCTION OF AZABICYCLOALKANOL DERIVATIVE<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a novel method for<br>
producing an azabicycloalkanol derivative, particularly a novel<br>
method	for	producing	a<br>
cis-3-substituted-3-azabicyclo[3.2.l]octan-8-ol  derivative<br>
which is a useful intermediate for agricultural chemicals or<br>
pharmaceutical products . Further, in the present specification,<br>
a	configuration	of<br>
cis-3-substituted-3-azabicyclo[3.2.l]octan-8-ol	is<br>
represented by a configuration of formula  (1),  and a<br>
configuration	of<br>
trans-3-substituted-3-azabicyclot3.2.1]octan-8-ol       is represented by a configuration of formula (2). [0002]<br><br><br>
Background Art<br>
[0003]<br>
As a method for producing a cis-3-substitiited-3-azabicyclo[3. 2 .1 ]octan-8-ol derivative, for example, a method wherein 3-methyl-3-azabicyclo[3 .2 . l]octan-8-one is reduced with metal sodium, and heated for 230 hours in the presence of benzophenone (see Non-Patent Document 1) is known.<br>
Further, the following method is known in which 3-inethyl-3-azabiCYclol3.2 . l]octan-8-oneisreducednormally to obtain a trans , and transformed into trif late, and then, inversed with acid (see Hon-Patent Document 2).<br>
Meanwhile, a racemization reaction of optically active alcohol using a ruthenium complex as a catalyst is known (see Non-Patent Documents 3 and 4). [0004]<br>
Non-Patent Reference 1: J. Org. Chera., 1963, 28, 2407 Non-Patent Reference 2: J. Med. Chem., 2003, 46, 1456 Non-Patent Reference 3: J. Organomet., Chem., 2002, 652, 105 Non-Patent Reference 4: Tetrahedron Lett., 2003, 44, 7521<br>
Disclosure of the Invention Object to be Solved by the Present Invention [0005]<br>
However, the method described in Non-Patent Reference 1 has problems that reaction time is long, and further, the yield of the desired cis is low. In the method of Non-Patent Reference 2, there are problems as an industrial method for producing because the reaction has to undergo many stages and anhydrous trifluoromethanesulfonate used as well as reagent is expensive. On the other hand, an example in which a reaction of a<br><br>
hydrogen-tansfer type using a transition metal complex applied to racemization is known . However , in the case of racemization , since inversion progresses only up to 50% at a maximum, it has been considered that a preferential inversion from an isomer to another isomer is not possible. [0006]<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing an azabicycloalkanol derivative which is industrially useful, with a high yield and versatility. In particular, it is to provide a method for producing a cis-3-substituted-3-azabicyclo[3.2.l]octan-8-ol derivative as an azabicycloalkanol derivative.<br>
Means to Solve the Object [0007]<br>
The present inventors had made a keen study to solve the above mentioned objects and found out that an isomer can be preferentially isomerized from an isomer to another isomer by reacting an alcohol derivative, which is a reactive substrate, as a hydrogen source, even though the reaction is a hydrogen-transfer type using a transition metal complex. [OOOB]<br>
More specifically, the first aspect of the present invention relates to a method for producing a thermodynamic ally more stable one of diastereomers among azabicyclo-Cg-io-alkanol derivatives, wherein a diastereomer of an azabicyclo-Cfi-io-alkanol derivative containing a methyne which is an asymmetric carbon with a hydroxyl group, is isomerized in the presence of a transition metal complex, thereby producing an excess amount of the thermodynamically more stable one of diastereomers.<br><br>
[0009]<br>
The second aspect of the present invention relates to a<br>
method	for	producing	a<br>
cis-3-substituted-3-azabicYclo[3.2.l]octan-8-ol derivative, wherein a trans form in a mixture of trans- and cis-3-subsituted-3-azabicyclo[3.2.l]octan-8-ol derivatives or a trans-3-substituted-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan'8-ol derivative is isomerized to a cis form in the presence of a transition metal complex, thereby producing an excess amount of the cis form. lOOlO]<br>
The third aspect of the present invention relates to a<br>
method	for	producing	a<br>
cis-3-substituted-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-8-ol derivative, wherein a 3-substituted-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-8-one derivative undergoes areduction reaction of ahydrogen-transf er type in the presence of a transition metal complex, and an organic compound with hydrogen-donating property or an Inorganic compound with hydrogen-donating property to obtain a mijcture of trans- andcis-3-substituted-3-azablcyclo[3 . 2 . l]octan'8-ol derivatives or a trans-3-substituted-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]-B-ol derivative, and then, the organic compound with hydrogen-donating property or the inorganic compound with hydrogen-donating property is removed therefrom, and the trans is isomerized to a cis form in the presence of the transition metal complex which was used for the reduction reaction of hydrogen-transfer type, and thereby producing an excess amount of the cis form.<br>

Best Mode of Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0012]<br>
An azabicycloalkanol derivative used as a reactive substrate in a method for producing the present invention is a diastereomer of an azabicyclo-Ce-io-alkanol derivative having a methyne which is an asymmetric carbon with a hydroxyl group. The diastereomer is consisted of a mixture of a diastereomer containing excessively isomers of the desired diastereomer, or of only isomers of the desired diastereomer. [0013]<br>
The azabicycloalkanol derivative used for the method for producing the present invention may have a substituent, which does not interfere an isomerization reaction using a transition metal complex, at any position on the skeleton of azabicycloalkanol. [0014]<br>
As a substituent, the following hydrocarbon groups can be exemplified:<br>

Among the above examples, a preferred example is an alcoholic solvent, and 2 -propanol is more preferred. The usage amount of the hydrogen-donating compound to be a hydrogen source is determined by the solubility of a reaction substrate and economic efficiency, and specifically, the amount is not particularly limited, as long as it is equal to or more than the equimolar amount respect to the reaction substrate, and further a large excess amount may be used.

And the transition metal complex used herein may be used for the isomerization reaction in the next step only by removing the hydrogen-donating compound from the system which interferes the isomerization reaction. A method for removing the hydrogen-donating compound is not particularly limited, and commonly known methods such as distillation, liquid separation, and filtration can be used. [0017]<br>
The trans-3-substituted-3-azabicyclo[3.2.l]octan-8-ol derivative may have a substituent, which does not interfere the isomerization reaction using a transition metal complex, at any position on the skeleton of 3-substituted-3-azablcyclo[3.2.1]octan-8-ol. A substituent for nitrogen at 3-position is not particularly limited, as long<br><br>
