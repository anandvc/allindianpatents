Example 1<br>
Preparation of N-Phosphonomethyf-L-Valine<br>
N-Phosphonomethyl-L-Valine (see compound designated C1 in table below) is believed to be a new composition of matter, and was prepared according to Scheme 2 below.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Scheme 1a. Synthesis of N-Phosphonomethyl-L-Vaiine<br>
Other amino acids may be used in a similar way to valine in the above scheme.<br>
The specific details of reaction in the synthesis of D(+) N-Phosphonomethyl-L-Valine were as follows (see also general reaction scheme which is provided above).<br>
(a)    Valine plus hexafluoroacetone<br>
Hexafiuoroacetone (10g) was bubbled into a suspension of (L)-Valine (4.0g, 34.1 mmol) in DMSO (30mL) in a 2-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a dry-ice condensor. Slight warming was necessary to prevent the<br><br>
DMSO from freezing. After a clear solution was obtained, excess hexafluoroacetone (2g) was bubbled into the reaction mixture, and stirring continued for 3-4h at =45'C (oil-bath temp). The excess hexafluoroacetone was distilled off into a water trap. The reaction mixture was poured into water (100mL) and extracted with CH2CI2 (2 x 50mL). The combined organic extracts were washed with water (2 x 50mL) and dried over anhydrous Na2S04. The mixture was distilled at atmospheric pressure to remove the CH2CI2. Yield : 8.02g (89%) - clear colourless liquid.<br>
(b)	Bromination<br>
A mixture of valine trifluoromethyl oxazolidinone (8.0g, 30mmol), paraformaldehyde (1.81g) and phosphorus tribromide (6mL) was heated at 60 °C (oil-bath temp) for 2h.<br>
The reaction mixture was distilled under vacuum (= O.lmmHg)<br>
Fraction 1, 25-30 °C - PBr3<br>
Fraction 2, 40-50 °C - clear colorless liquid, 9.6g (89%)<br>
(c)	Phosphonate Ester Moiety<br>
Trimethylphosphite (1.19mL, 10mmol, 1.2equiv) was added dropwise to a solution of valine-methylbromide (3.0g, 8.3mmol, lequiv) and CH2CI2 (5mL) at room temp. Stirring was continued for 1h. The reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo, white solid, 3g (92%).<br>
(d)	Hydrolysis of Phosphonate Ester<br>
A soln of the valine-methylphosphonate (2.0g, 5mmol) and concentrated HCI  (6mL) was  heated - at reflux for 5h.  The  reaction  mixture  was* concentrated in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in ethanol. Propylene oxide (2mL) was then added. A white solid precipitated. Ether (25mL) was then added, and stirring continued for 15min. The solid product was isolated<br><br>
by suction filtration, washed with ether and dried in vacuo. Yield 1.02g (93%) - white solid (semi-solid at room temp).<br>
(e)	The L(-) isomer of N-phosphonomethylvaline may be prepared in the same manner as described above by using the D(+) enantiomer of valine.<br>
(f)	Optical Activity of N-phosphonomethylvaline<br>
Relative optical rotation has been measured for the proposed L- and D-isomers of N-phosphonomethylvaline as well as their racemic mixture.<br>
The optical rotation study was carried out on a ca. 0.25 M solutions of the above samples in the solvent comprised of distilled water (98% v/v), KH2PO4 (1.68 g/L), methanol (2.0 % v/v) and 88 % H3PO4 (0.2%). The following results were obtained.<br>
1.	The sample which was prepared from L-Valine (starting material)<br>
showed relative optical rotation ([α]D) to be +7.7°.<br>
This was calculated according to the following relationship([α]D) = (100 x<br>
a(/(1 x C)<br>
where        a is the measured angle f) (0.8°)<br>
C is concentration of the sample (g/100ml)(5.2 g/100 ml) 1 is length of observation tube (dm) (2 dm)<br>
2.	The sample which was prepared from D-Valine (starting material)<br>
showed relative optical rotation ([α]D) to be -12.5°.<br>
where        a is the measured angle () (-1.2°)<br>
C is concentration of the sample (g/100ml)(4.8 g/100 ml) 1 is length of observation tube (dm) (2 dm)<br>
3.	The sample which was prepared from DL-Valine (racemic) (starting<br>
material) showed relative optical rotation ([α]D) to be 0° (as expected).<br>
Examples 2 to 17<br>
The compounds of examples 2 to 17 were prepared by a method in accordance with Example 1 and in accordance with information provided for the compounds<br><br>
in Table 1.    The reagents were modified in accordance with the general procedure of scheme 1. Compounds 1 to 17 were subjected to bioassay in accordance with the following procedure and the results are shown in Table 2.<br>
Helicoverpa colony maintenance<br>
H. armigera were obtained from the CSIRO Entomology, Indooroopilly, QLD, Australia. H. armigera and H. punctigera were housed in independent constant temperature rooms (25-27SC) with a 16/8 hour light/dark cycle. Larvae were reared in individual cups containing 1.5cm cubes of media. Media comprised 234g Haricot beans, 14g agar, 35g Tprtula yeast, 50g wheatgerm, 3.5g ascorbic acid, 1.1g sorbic acid and 2.2g p-hydroxybenzoic methylester made up to 1L with dH20, and was supplemented with 200mg penicillin, 200mg streptomycin and 16mg prochloraz. For every third generation of larvae raised, 50mg chloramphenicol was added to 1L of media. Care was taken during the rearing process to limit to potential for the development of contamination. To maintain viability, new larvae obtained from the field were added to the colony every third to fourth generation.<br>
Media bioassay<br>
This assay was performed to investigate the efficacy of compounds in inhibiting larval growth. Media was prepared in an identical manner .to that described above, and 5ml was added to wells containing 500ul of test compound. Each compound was tested at 1.25,2.5, 5 and 10mM final concentration. The inhibitor was mixed evenly through the media, then the mixture was allowed to set. The media containing inhibitor was then divided between five plastic ups and two neonatal larvae were placed on the media in each cup. Larvae were left undisturbed for five days at 25-27SC in a room with a 16/8 hour light/dark cycle. Controls, containing the solvent dimethyl sulfonoxide (DMSO) which was used for dissolving the inhibitor, were included in each assay. After 5 days all cups were transferred to -20sC and left overnight before removal and weighing of the larvae. Larval weights were compared between treated and control groups. The results were expressed as a % inhibition, I, calculated as follows: I = 100(1 -A), where A<br><br>
is given by [(weight of control larvae) minus (weight of treated larvae)] divided by (weight of control larvae).<br>

N-Phosphonomethyl-L-valine may also be prepared from (L)-valine by Mannich reaction according to the method of Scheme 3 shown below. This method is particularly suitable for larger scale preparations.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
Scheme 3 Example 19, Control of Helicoverpa spp. larvae in a commercial cotton crop.<br>
A field trial was conducted in a commercial cotton-growing region of Western Australia, as outlined below.<br>
Location:	Kununurra, Western Australia.<br>
Dominant pest species:   Helicoverpa armigera: 186 (81 %) of 230 third<br>
instar were H. armigera<br>
Crop:	Cotton cv Delta Pine Emerald (broad leaf type).<br>
Planting Details:	7 to 8 plants per m of row, 2 rows 90 cm apart on<br>
beds at 1.8 m centres.<br><br><br>
Plant Details:	About 1 metre tall at application. High foliage<br>
density;<br>
Crop Stage:	Mid flowering.<br>
Phytotoxicity at 7 days after application (DAA):   None.<br>
The trial was laid out as a randomized complete block experiment; with four blocks each containing one plot of each insecticidal treatment and one plot of the untreated control. Each block was comprised of consecutive plots 10 m long within the same strip of cotton. Buffer zones of several metres were left untreated between plots.<br>
Treatments were:<br>
C1 @ 2.0kg/ha<br>
EDTA (previously been shown to have the ability to influence larval survival) @2.0 kg/ha and<br>
C1 plus EDTA (1.0 kg/ha each).<br>
No rain fell during the period of the trial, however dews formed before sunrise each day. Leaves were also coated with dust and ash from local bush fires. At 3 days after application (3DAA) total numbers of live viable Helicoverpaspji^ larvae (TLVA) were counted on 10 terminals per plot.<br>
Results were as follows.<br>
Table 19.1. Influence of C1 and EDTA on the population of Helicoverpa spp.<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br><br>
Although EDTA alone had no apparent influence on larval survival in this experiment (possibly because of washing by the dew or leaf contamination), C1 reduced the larval numbers by over 25% and the combined treatment of C1/EDTA at the same payload/ha reduced larval numbers by over 40%.<br>
The trial showed that C1 plus EDTA was effective against Helicoverpa spp. infesting cotton and that mixing C1and EDTA was more effective than using the components alone.   ,<br>
Example 20: Insecticidal activity of racemic N-phosphonomethyl valine (C1) compared with its D an L isomers.<br>
The development of helicoverpa larvae on geranium plants was assessed in a glasshouse. Commercially grown geranium seedlings were potted (one plant/pot) two weeks prior to use. Seedlings used for experimental purposes were about 150mm tall, with 4-7 leaves. On the day of treatment, plants were ranked by size and the ranking divided by the treatment number. Within these groupings plants were randomly allocated to a treatment grouping to provide 7 pots (plants) per treatment. Each group was isolated and sprayed with insecticidal treatments or water using a hand operated misting sprayer. Plants were then allowed to dry for approximately 1-2 hours before being plaqed in inse'ct-proof cages in the glasshouse (one treatment/cage). Neonatal larvae of H. armigera were grown as outlined previously and 20 first instar larvae applied by evenly distributing them across all the leaves of each plant (generally 5 or 6 leaves) using a fine paint brush.<br>
Assessments the total number of live, viable and active (TLVA) larvae, together with a subjective assessment of the percentage damage to leaves of each plant on days 3, 5 and 7 after application.<br><br>
Two trials were conducted; one with just the isomeric variants of N-phosphonomethyl valine (C1) applied to the test plants and the second using two additives that had previously been found to improve the insecticidal activity of C1. These additives were EDTA (disodium, Sigma) and endosulfan (Endosulfan 350EC, Nufarm Ltd, 350g/L endosulfan). In this trial EDTA was used at the same molar concentration as the racemic or isomeric C1. An appropriate sub-lethal concentration of endosulfan (suitable for use in glasshouse evaluations) was determined in previous dose-response evaluations. The suitable dose rate was 1/25001 of the rate recommended for use in the field (label rate, 2100mL/Ha).<br>
Isomeric versions of C1 were produced by the method outlined in Example 18, commencing with valine of known optical rotation properties.<br>
The treatments are shown in Table 20.1.<br>

(Table Removed)<br><br><br><br><br>
At-0.5, 3, 5 and 7DAA, numbers of Helicoverpa armigera larvae per leaf and per plant were counted, as well as a subjective (visual) assessment made of the percent leaf damage per plant.<br>
Influence of the treatments on development of the population of Helicoverpa spp. and leaf damage produced by the larvae to 7 days after application (DAA) in the two trials are illustrated in Table 20.<br>

phosphonomethyl valine (C1) in glasshouse assessments.<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br><br><br>
Insecticidal activity appeared to reside primarily with C1 manufactured using the L isomer of valine. This version of the compound remained compatible with EDTA and endosulfan.<br><br>
Example 21: Compatibility of C1/EDTA with other insecticides.<br>
(a) Endosulfan. Field trial on cotton.<br>
Trial 2 in Example 20 indicated compatibility of endosulfan with a C1/EDTA mixture in the glasshouse. This was confirmed in a field trial on cotton conducted under the same conditions as those outlined for Example 19. This trial was however conducted later in the growing season with plants in the late flowering stage. Plants in this trial had clean leaves and neither rain nor dews were recorded over the trial period. Results are illustrated in Table 21.1.<br>

Results confirmed compatibility of the C1/EDTA mix with endosulfan. Similar larval kill was obtained with C1/EDTA (1 Kg/Ha each) supplemented with endosulfan at 1/10th label rate as was obtained with endosulfan at full label rate.<br>
Example 21cont: Compatibility of C1/EDTA with other insecticides.<br>
(b) Spinosad. Field trial on cotton<br>
A field trial was conducted in a commercial cotton-growing region of southern QLD (Dalby, Darling Downs). Pre-flowering cotton plants (7 to 8 plants/metre of row, two rows 90cm apart on beds at 1.8m centres. The trial was laid out as a complete block experiment; with four blocks each containing one plot of each insecticide treatment and one plot of the untreated control. Each block was six<br><br>
rows wide by 15m long, with the central 4m by 10 m sprayed. The treatments are tabulated below:<br>
Products and dose rates used in the evaluation of the compatibility of spinosad with the C1/EDTA mixture were:<br>
1.   C1 (1 Kg/Ha) plus EDTA (disodium (1 Kg/Ha).<br>
Spinosad (Tracer, Dow Elanco, at label rate for treatment of 2.<br>
helicoverpa in cotton; 150 mL/Ha)<br>
3.   Spinosad, 15 mL/Ha (1/10th label rate)<br>
C1 (1 Kg/Ha) plus EDTA (disodium (1 Kg/Ha) plus Tracer 4.<br>
(Spinosad) 15 mL/ha.<br>
5.    Untreated Control<br>
At -0.5, 3 and 8DAA, Helicoverpa spp. larvae, damaged squares and bolls were evaluated on a per metre of row basis. Rain (5mm) fell during day 7 after treatment. Influence of the treatments on development of the population of Helicoverpa spp. over the trial period is illustrated in Table 21.2<br>
Table 21.2. Population of Helicoverpa spp. over the trial period.<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br><br>
As in the previous examples, the reductions in larval numbers obtained when the individual components of mixed treatments were applied to cotton were too large to facilitate the demonstration of synergy. As demonstrated in the previous examples with endosulfan however, additive benefits were obtained by combining<br><br>
the C1/EDTA mixture with a spinosad. As with endosulfan, reductions in insect number were similar when the commercial insecticide was used at full label rate as when it was used at 1/10th the recommended rate with the C1/EDTA mix.<br>
Example 21cont: Compatibility of C1/EDTA with other Insecticides.<br>
(c) Chlorpvrifos. Field trial on peas.<br>
A field trial was conducted as a single large plot trial in commercial pidgeon pea crop located in northern NSW (Dubbo). (7 to 8plants/metre of row, six rows, 20m long). Each sampling site consisted of one metre of row, well separated from surrounding treatments. Each treatment was randomly replicated four times across the plot. Insect populations were assessed by the 'beat sheet' method, as visual assessment of larvae in standing crops of this type is difficult. The beat sheet method of larval assessment consists of placing a white sheet under the section of crop to be assessed and the crop is vigorously shaken to dislodge larvae onto the sheet. The treatments are tabulated below:<br>
1.	C1 (1 Kg/Ha) plus EDTA (disodium (1 Kg/Ha).<br>
2.	Chlorpyrifos (Pirate 300g/L EC, Nufarm, at label rate for treatment of helicoverpa in cotton; 4.0L/ha)<br>
3.	Chlorpyrifos 0.4Uha (1 /10th label rate)<br>
4.	C1 (1 Kg/Ha) plus EDTA (disodium (1 Kg/Ha) plus Pirate 0.4L/ha.<br>
5.	Untreated Control<br>
Pre-treatment and at 2 and 5DAA, the number and Helicoverpa spp. larvae were evaluated on a per metre of row basis.<br>
RESULTS<br>
Influence of the treatments on development of the population of Helicoverpa spp. over the trial period is illustrated in Table 21.3.<br><br>
Table 21.3. Insecticidal activity of chlorpyrifos combinations.<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br><br>
The sum of the reductions in total larvae/metre of row obtained when the C1/EDTA component and the 1/10th rate' chlorpyrifos treatment were used alone was less than the larval reduction noted when the two treatments were used together. This indicates synergistic insect control by the combined treatment. The results of this trial were consistent with previous trials in the glasshouse, which indicated that medium and large larvae were little affected by exposure to the C1/EDTA mixture alone. The results of this trial demonstrate that medium and large larvae are well controlled by a C1/EDTA when combined with a low rate chlorpyrifos.<br>
Example 21cont: Compatibility of C1/EDTA with other insecticides.<br>
(d) Abamectin. Glasshouse trial. Helicoverpa armigera on geranium seedlings<br>
The potential of abamectin as a co-insecticide with a mixture of C1 plus EDTA was assessed by exposing Helicoverpa armigera larvae to the mixture and its component parts in a glasshouse experiment. Geranium seedlings were prepared and treated as outlined in Example 20, except that the plants were sprayed with products outlined below.<br>
1. Abamectin 18g/L EC (Nufarm, trial formulation) applied at 17250th the recommended rate for field use (6mL/L). A previous dose titration had indicated that this dilution was likely to give a sub-lethal response.<br><br>
2.	C1 (25mM) plus abamectih (1/250th of 6mL/L).<br>
3.	C1 (25mM) plus EDTA (disodium, 25mM) plus abamectin (1/250th of 6mL/L).<br>
4.	Untreated Control<br>
Assessments the total number of live, viable and active (TLVA) larvae, together with a subjective assessment of the percentage damage to leaves of each plant were made on days 3, 5 and 7 after application.<br>
The number of Helicoverpa armigera larvae per leaf, as well as a subjective (visual) assessment of the percent leaf damage per plant was made on day 7 after application (7DAA).<br>
RESULTS<br>
Influence of the treatments on survival of H. armigera. is illustrated in Table 21.4.<br>
Table 21.4. Insecticidal activity of abamectin combinations.<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br><br>
The death rate of helicoverpa due to abamectin alone was higher than anticipated in this trial, however addition of C1 or C1 plus EDTA reduced leaf damage by the insects.<br>

(e) Carbaryl. Glasshouse trial. Helicoverpa armigera on geranium seedlings.<br><br>
The potential of carbaryl as a co-insecticide with a mixture of C1 plus EDTA was assessed by exposing Helicoverpa armigera larvae to the mixture and its component parts in a glasshouse experiment. Geranium seedlings were prepared and treated as outlined in part d (above), except that the plants were sprayed with products outlined below.<br>
1.	Carbaryl (Arthur Yates Pty Ltd, 100g/L EC) applied at 1/100th the recommended rate for field use (10mL/L). A previous dose titration had indicated that this dilution was likely to give a sub-lethal response.<br>
2.	C1 (25mM) plus EDTA (disodium, 25mM).<br>
3.	CI (25mM) plus EDTA (25mM) plus carbamate (0.1 mL/L).<br>
4.	Untreated Control.<br>
Assessments the total number of live, viable and active (TLVA) larvae, together with a subjective assessment of the percentage damage to leaves of each plant was made on day 7 after application (7DAA).<br>
