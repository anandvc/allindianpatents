				<td>Finely distributed stabilising composition for polymers containing halogen<br>
The present invention relates to a stabiliser composition for halogen-containing polymers, comprising a salt of a halogen-containing oxy acid and an inorganic or organic acid or an inorganic base. The present invention relates also to a process for the preparation of such stabiliser compositions and to halogen-containing polymers comprising such stabiliser compositions.<br>
It is known that halogen-containing plastics have a tendency to undergo undesirable decomposition and breakdown reactions under thermal stress during processing or during long-term use. The breakdown of halogenated polymers, especially in the case of PVC, results in the formation of hydrochloric acid, which is eliminated from the polymer strand, resulting in a discoloured, unsaturated plastics having colour-imparting polyene sequences.<br>
Especially in the case of moulded articles that are exposed to light, fluctuating temperatures or other external influences, as the period of use increases changes occur to the colour and material properties which may eventually lead to the moulded article's becoming unusable<br>
Various stabiliser systems have been proposed for stabilising halogen-containing polymers in respect of long-term damage caused by the action of light or heat. For example, systems are described in the prior art that comprise perchlorate salts for stabilising halogen-containing polymers. A problem that arises when perchlorate salts are used, however, is that those sensitive oxidising agents have to be handled very cautiously. For that reason, the user will have certain reservations about the use of perchlorate salts in stabiliser compositions. Various solutions have therefore been proposed by means of which such perchlorate-containing stabiliser compositions can be improved in respect of their handleability.<br>
For example, EP-B 0 457 471 describes a stabiliser composition comprising perchlorate, calcium silicate and calcium carbonate. For the preparation of the described stabiliser compositions, an aqueous solution of sodium perchlorate is mixed with calcium silicate or with a mixture of calcium silicate and calcium carbonate. A problem that arises with the described stabiliser compositions is that they still contain relatively large crystallites of sodium perchlorate. Such crystallites can still constitute a hazard during handling. Furthermore, such stabiliser compositions cannot be distributed sufficiently homogeneously in a<br><br>
halogen-containing polymer. In addition, the presence of calcium silicate limits the stabiliser action in comparison with other calcium compounds. Moreover, calcium silicate exhibits a high Mohs hardness, so that processing apparatus can become permanently damaged.<br>
DE 689 12 616 T2 discloses pulverulent flame retardants having a content of antimony pent-oxide for halogen-containing vinyl resins. The specification describes compositions for flame retardants that comprise sodium perchlorate and also hydroxides or salts of an alkali metal. According to embodiments 2 and 4, the described compositions are dried and can then be ground in a pin disc mill.<br>
DE 696 04 880 T2 relates to a stabiliser for halogen-containing resins and processes for the preparation thereof, a halogen-containing resin composition and a complex hydroxide salt. The stabiliser for the halogen-containing resins may comprise, for example, a complex hydroxide salt of a perchloric acid and inorganic metal hydroxides.<br>
There was therefore a need for stabiliser compositions comprising a salt of a halogen-containing oxy acid, where the stabiliser compositions comprise the salt of the halogen-containing oxy acid as finely divided as possible.<br>
The problem underlying the present invention is therefore to provide such stabiliser compositions and processes for their preparation.<br>
The problems underlying the invention are solved by a stabiliser composition and a process for its preparation as described in the following text.<br>
The present invention therefore relates to a stabiliser composition, at least comprising a salt of a halogen-containing oxy acid of the general formula M(C1O4)k, wherein M is Li, Na, K, Mg, Ca, Sr, Zn, Al, La, Ce or an ammonium cation of the general formula NR4+, the radicals R are each independently of the others H or a linear or branched alkyl radical having from 1 to about 10 carbon atoms and k, according to the valency of M, is the number 1, 2 or 3, and an inorganic or organic acid or an inorganic base, where the composition, based on the total content of salt of a halogen-containing oxy acid, contains less than 10 % crystallites of the salt having a crystallite size greater than 3 Âµm.<br>
A "stabiliser composition" is to be understood in the context of the present invention as being a composition that can be used for the stabilisation of halogen-containing polymers. For achieving that stabilisation effect, a stabiliser composition according to the invention is<br><br>
generally mixed with a halogen-containing polymer to be stabilised and then processed. It is equally possible, however, for a stabiliser composition according to the invention to be mixed with the halogen-containing polymer to be stabilised during processing.<br>
A stabiliser composition according to the invention has at least two constituents. As a first constituent, a stabiliser composition according to the invention comprises at least one salt of a halogen-containing oxy acid of the general formula M(C1O4)k, wherein M is Li, Na, K, Mg, Ca, Sr, Zn, Al, La, Ce or an ammonium cation of the general formula NR/, wherein the radicals R are each independently of the others H or a linear or branched alkyl radical having from 1 to about 10 carbon atoms. The index k, according to the valency of M, is the number 1, 2 or 3.<br>
A stabiliser composition according to the invention may, for example, comprise only one salt of a halogen-containing oxy acid. In the context of the present invention it is equally possible, however, for a stabiliser composition according to the invention to comprise a mixture of two or more salts of halogen-containing oxy acids. Within the scope of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a stabiliser composition according to the invention comprises sodium perchlorate.<br>
The content of salts of a halogen-containing oxy acid or of a mixture of two or more halogen-containing oxy acids in the stabiliser composition according to the invention is from approximately 0.01 to approximately 50 % by weight, especially from approximately 0.05 to approximately 20 % by weight. Examples of contents of salts of a halogen-containing oxy acid or of a mixture of two or more such salts are from approximately 0.1 to approximately 5 % by weight or from approximately 0.2 to approximately 1.5 % by weight.<br>
The salts of the halogen-containing oxy acids are present in a stabiliser composition according to the invention in especially finely divided form. Within the scope of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, less than 10 % by weight of the salts of the halogen-containing oxy acid or the mixture of two or more such salts have crystallites of a size greater than 3 |im. It follows that at least approximately 90 % by weight of the salts have crystallites of a size smaller than 3 Âµm.<br>
Within the scope of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a stabiliser composition according to the invention comprises a salt of a halogen-containing oxy acid or of a mixture of two or more halogen-containing oxy acids, wherein less than approximately 10% by<br><br>
weight of the salt or the salt mixture is in the form of crystallites of a size greater than 1 p,m, preferably of a size greater than 500 nm. Within the scope of a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, a stabiliser composition according to the invention is substantially free of crystallites of salts of halogen-containing oxy acids having a crystallite size greater than approximately 250 nm. Within the scope of especially preferred embodiments of the present invention, a stabiliser composition according to the invention comprises crystallites of salts of halogen-containing oxy acids having a crystallite size greater than approximately 100 nm or greater than approximately 50 nm or greater than approximately 20 nm or greater than approximately 10 or approximately 5 nm.<br>
The crystallite sizes of salts of halogen-containing oxy acids, as mentioned in the context of the present text, can be determined in principle by any methods of determining particle sizes. Suitable in principle are, for example, screening methods, sedimentation methods or methods based on the diffraction or refraction of electromagnetic waves, especially of light. Also suitable are electron-microscopic methods, such as scanning electron microscopy or transmission electron microscopy.<br>
Within the scope of a further preferred, embodiment of the present invention, a stabiliser composition according to the invention is free of crystallites, such as are detectable by X-ray diffractometric methods. A stabiliser composition according to the invention therefore preferably comprises crystallites having sizes beyond the detection limit of such methods. The size of such crystallites is preferably below approximately 10 nanometres, preferably below approximately 5 nanometres.<br>
In addition to a salt of a halogen-containing oxy acid or a mixture of two or more such salts, a stabiliser composition according to the invention comprises an inorganic or organic acid or an inorganic base. The inorganic or organic acids or the inorganic bases are solid compounds capable of forming preferably solid acid or base anhydrides. There are suitable, for example, organic acids capable of anhydride formation, for example maleic acid, phthalic acid and succinic acid.<br>
Also suitable, for example, are inorganic acids that are capable of anhydride formation, for example boric acid.     Especially suitable as constituent of the stabiliser composition according to the invention, however, are inorganic bases capable of forming anhydrides. Suitable inorganic bases are the<br><br>
hydroxides of elements of main groups I and II of the Periodic Table and the hydroxides of elements of sub-group I of the Periodic Table. Magnesium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, barium hydroxide and strontium hydroxide are especially suitable.<br>
A stabiliser composition according to the invention may in the context of the present invention comprise, for example, only one organic or inorganic acid or one inorganic base. In the context of the present invention, however, it is also possible for a stabiliser composition according to the invention to comprise a mixture of two or more organic acids or two or more inorganic acids or a mixture of two or more inorganic bases or a mixture of one or more organic acids or one or more inorganic acids.<br>
Within the scope of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a stabiliser composition according to the invention comprises as inorganic base calcium hydroxide or magnesium hydroxide, especially calcium hydroxide.<br>
In addition to the mentioned acids or bases or the mixtures of acids and bases and the salts of halogen-containing oxy acids, a stabiliser composition according to the invention can also comprise further additives.<br>
Suitable additives include, for example, amino alcohols. Suitable amino alcohols in the context of the present invention are in principle any compounds having at least one OH group and a primary, secondary or tertiary amino group or a combination of two or more of the mentioned amino groups. In the context of the present invention, in principle both solid and liquid amino alcohols are suitable as a constituent of the stabiliser compositions according to the invention. In the context of the present invention, however, the content of liquid amino alcohols is, for example, so chosen that the entire stabiliser composition is substantially in solid form.<br>
Within the scope of a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, a stabiliser composition according to the invention contains a maximum of approximately 5 % by weight of liquid amino alcohol or a mixture of two or more liquid amino alcohols, but preferably the content is lower, for example 1 % by weight or less. Within the scope of an especially preferred embodiment of the present invention, a stabiliser composition according to the invention contains no liquid amino alcohols.<br><br>
Amino alcohols suitable for use in the context of the present invention have, within the scope of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a melting point higher than approximately 30Â°C, especially higher than approximately 50Â°C. Suitable amino alcohols are, for example, mono- or poly-hydroxy compounds which are based on linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated aliphatic mono- or poly-amines.<br>

For the preparation of the stabiliser composition according to the invention, an aqueous solution of a salt of a halogen-containing oxy acid or a mixture of two or more such salts is reacted with an inorganic or organic acid anhydride or with an inorganic base anhydride.<br>
The present invention therefore relates also to a process for the preparation of a stabiliser composition for halogen-containing polymers wherein an aqueous solution of a halogen-containing oxy acid, or a mixture of two or more halogen-containing oxy acids, is reacted with an inorganic or organic acid anhydride or an inorganic base anhydride, or with a mixture of two or more thereof, to form a reaction product.<br>
For this purpose, within the scope of a first embodiment of the present invention an inorganic or organic acid anhydride or an inorganic base anhydride or a mixture of two or more inorganic or organic acid anhydrides or a mixture of two or more inorganic base anhydrides is prepared in powder form. The process according to the invention may, however, equally be carried out with a mixture of one or more inorganic acid anhydrides and one or more inorganic base anhydrides.<br>
The powders used in the context of the process according to the invention preferably have an average particle size of less than approximately 100 Âµm, especially less than approximately 60 Âµm and more especially less than approximately 40 Âµm.<br>
For carrying out the process according to the invention, one of the above-mentioned anhydride compounds or one of the above-mentioned mixtures is reacted with an aqueous solution of a salt of a halogen-containing oxy acid or a mixture of two or more such salts. The reaction is carried out in the context of the process according to the invention in such a manner that the anhydride reacts with the water supplied by the aqueous solution of the halogen-containing salt of the oxy acid or the mixture of two or more of those acids, to form the respective acid or base.<br>
The conditions prevailing during the reaction can be chosen substantially as desired, provided that reaction of the anhydride in question is effected by the water of the aqueous solution. For<br><br>
example, temperatures of from approximately 0 to approximately 100Â°C, especially temperatures of from approximately 20 to approximately 80Â°C, may be used for the reaction. Within the scope of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the components participating in the reaction are so chosen that the reaction can be carried out substantially at room temperature.<br>
It is provided for according to the invention, however, that the temperature rises during the reaction, for example as a result of an exothermic nature of the reaction itself<br>
The reaction of the pulverulent component with the aqueous solution can be effected in principle in any desired way, provided that sufficient intermixing of powder and aqueous solution is ensured. For example, customary mixing apparatus, such as broom-type mixers or ploughshare mixers, are suitable for carrying out the process according to the invention. Especially suitable, however, are processes that result in an especially fine distribution of the components that react with one another, for example fluidised bed methods, spray tower methods or jet stream methods.<br>
The process according to the invention can also be carried out, for example, as a combination of mixing and grinding processes. In that case, for example during the grinding of an anhydride or a mixture of two or more anhydrides, as described above, an aqueous solution of a salt of a halogen-containing oxy acid or a mixture of two or more such salts can be supplied in the context of the grinding operation.<br>
When a stabiliser composition according to the invention is to comprise one or more additives in addition to the two main components, those additives can be added to the stabiliser composition before, during or after the reaction of the aqueous solution with the anhydride or anhydrides. Addition of additives before or during the reaction should take place only if the additives are inert towards the compounds participating in the reaction. Otherwise, namely when the additives are not inert, they are added (where the stabiliser composition according to the invention is to comprise such additives) only after the reaction.<br>
Within the scope of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, for carrying out the process according to the invention the anhydride components and the aqueous solution are used in a molar ratio of anhydride : water such as 1:1 or greater than 1:1, for example from 1.1 : 1 to about 1.5 : 1.<br><br>
The stabiliser compositions according to the invention are suitable for the stabilisation of halogen-containing polymers.<br>
Examples of such halogen-containing polymers are polymers of vinyl chloride, vinyl resins containing vinyl chloride units in the polymer backbone, copolymers of vinyl chloride and vinyl esters of aliphatic acids, especially vinyl acetate, copolymers of vinyl chloride with esters of acrylic and methacrylic acid or acrylonitrile or mixtures of two or more thereof, copolymers of vinyl chloride with diene compounds or unsaturated dicarboxylic acids or anhydrides thereof, for example copolymers of vinyl chloride with diethyl maleate, diethyl fumarate or maleic anhydride, post-chlorinated polymers and copolymers of vinyl chloride, copolymers of vinyl chloride and vinylidene chloride with unsaturated aldehydes, ketones and other compounds such as acrolein, crotonaldehyde, vinyl methyl ketone, vinyl methyl ether, vinyl isobutyl ether and the like, polymers and copolymers of vinylidene chloride with vinyl chloride and other polymerisable compounds such as those already mentioned above, polymers of vinyl chloroacetate and dichlorodivinyl ether, chlorinated polymers of vinyl acetate, chlorinated polymeric esters of acrylic acid and a-substituted acrylic acids, chlorinated polystyrenes, for example polydichlorostyrene, chlorinated polymers of ethylene, polymers and post-chlorinated polymers of chlorobutadiene and copolymers thereof with vinyl chloride and also mixtures of two or more of the mentioned polymers or polymer mixtures that contain one or more of the above-mentioned polymers. Within the scope of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the stabiliser compositions according to the invention are used for the production of moulded articles of PVC-U, such as window profiles, industrial profiles, tubes and plates.<br>
Also suitable for stabilisation with the stabiliser compositions according to the invention are the graft polymers of PVC with EVA, ABS or MBS. Preferred substrates for such graft copolymers are also the afore-mentioned homo- and co-polymers, especially mixtures of vinyl chloride homopolymers with other thermoplastic or elastomeric polymers, especially blends with ABS, MBS, NBR, SAN, EVA, CPE; MBAS, PAA (polyalkyl acrylate), PAMA (polyalkyl methacrylate), EPDM, polyamides or polylactones.<br>
Likewise suitable for stabilisation with the stabiliser compositions according to the invention are mixtures of halogenated and non-halogenated polymers, for example mixtures of the above-mentioned non-halogenated polymers with PVC, especially mixtures of polyurethanes and PVC.<br><br>
Furthermore, it is also possible for recyclates of chlorine-containing polymers to be stabilised with the stabiliser compositions according to the invention, in principle any recyclates of the above-mentioned halogenated polymers being suitable for this purpose. PVC recyclate, for example, is suitable in the context of the present invention.<br>
The present invention therefore relates also to a polymer composition at least comprising a halogenated polymer and a stabiliser composition according to the invention.<br>
Within the scope of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a polymer composition according to the invention comprises the stabiliser composition according to the invention in an amount of from 0.1 to 20 phr, especially from approximately 0.5 to approximately 15 phr or from approximately 1 to approximately 12 phr. The unit phr represents "per hundred resin" and thus relates to parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of polymer.<br>
A polymer composition according to the invention preferably comprises as halogenated polymer at least a proportion of PVC, the PVC content being especially at least approximately 20 % by weight, preferably at least approximately 50 % by weight, for example at least approximately 80 % by weight or at least approximately 90 % by weight.<br>
The present invention relates also to a method of stabilising halogen-containing polymers in which a halogen-containing polymer or a mixture of two or more halogen-containing polymers or a mixture of one or more halogen-containing polymers and one or more halogen-free polymers is mixed with a stabiliser composition according to the invention,<br>
The mixing together of polymer or polymers and the stabiliser composition according to the invention can in principle be effected at any time before or during the processing of the polymer. For example, the stabiliser composition can be mixed into the polymer, which is in powder or granule form, prior to processing. It is equally possible, however, to add the stabiliser composition to the polymer or polymers in the softened or molten state, for example during processing in an extruder, in the form of an emulsion or dispersion, in the form of a pasty mixture, in the form of a dry mixture or in the form of a solution or melt.<br>
A polymer composition according to the invention can be brought into a desired form in known manner. Suitable methods are, for example, calendering, extrusion, injection-moulding, sintering, extrusion blowing or the plastisol process. A polymer composition according to the invention can also be used, for example, in the production of foamed materials. In<br><br>
principle, the polymer compositions according to the invention are suitable for the production of hard or soft PVC, especially for the production of PVC-U.<br>
A polymer composition according to the invention can be processed to form moulded articles. The present invention therefore relates also to moulded articles, at least comprising a stabiliser composition according to the invention or a polymer composition according to the invention.<br>
The term "moulded article" in the context of the present invention in principle includes any three-dimensional structures that can be produced from a polymer composition according to the invention. In the context of the present invention the term "moulded article" includes, for example, wire sheathings, automobile components, for example automobile components such as are used in the interior of the automobile, in the engine space or on the outer surfaces, cable insulators, decorative films, agricultural films, hoses, shaped sealing elements, office films, hollow bodies (bottles), packaging films, (deeÎ²-draw films), blown films, tubes, foamed materials, heavy duty profiles (window frames), light wall profiles, structural profiles, sidings, fittings, plates, foamed panels, co-extrudates having a recycled core, or housings for electrical apparatus or machinery, for example computers or household appliances.<br>
Further examples of moulded articles that can be produced from a polymer composition according to the invention are synthetic leather, floor coverings, textile coatings, wallcoverings, coil coatings and underseals for motor vehicles.<br>
The invention is explained in greater detail below by Examples.<br>
Examples<br>
1.	7.14 g of an aqueous solution of 70 % by weight sodium perchlorate in water were mixed with 45 g of calcium hydroxide (particle size D50 6.5 Âµm) and the mixture was then dried (combination 3). An electron-microscopic investigation of the dried mixture showed crystallites having a size of up to 10Âµm. By recording an X-ray diffractogram (Cu/K a-radiation) of the mixture, a reflex at 2 theta = 25.14'o demonstrated the presence of crystalline sodium perchlorate.<br>
2.	7.14 g of an aqueous solution of 70 % by weight sodium perchlorate in water were reacted with a mixture of 6.66 g of calcium oxide (particle size D50: 14.5 Âµm) and 36.2 g of calcium hydroxide (particle size D50: 6.5 Âµm) (combination 1). An electron-<br><br>
microscopic investigation of the mixture demonstrated no definite crystallites of sodium perchlorate. The recording of an X-ray diffractogram showed no reflex at 2 theta = 25.14Â°, so demonstrating the absence of crystalline sodium perchlorate having a crystallite size greater than 5 nm.<br>
For testing the effectiveness of the stabiliser compositions according to the invention, a formulation according to the invention and two comparison formulations (formulations 2 and 3) were prepared and their effectiveness tested. A mixture of sodium perchlorate and calcium hydroxide, obtained by mixing the two constituents together in the dry state, was used as combination 2. The particle size of the constituents calcium hydroxide and sodium perchlorate contained in combination 2 was respectively approximately 6.4Âµm and approximately 15 Âµm.<br>
The following formulations were used:<br><br><br>
PVC and each of the above-mentioned formulations were used to produce rolled sheets at 190Â°C (rolling time 3 minutes). The resulting PVC sheets were tested in a Congo red test according to DIN VDE 0472 Part 614 and their heat stability was tested in a Mathis oven at 200Â°C with advance every 5 minutes, followed by visual assessment of quality. The following results were obtained:<br><br>
1 = best score 6 - worst score<br><br><br><br><br><br>
