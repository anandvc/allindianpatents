WO 2004/079880		PCT/US2004/006J16<br>
A VARIABLE SPEED DRIVE WITH A SYNCHRONOUS ELECTRIC MOTOR<br>
5    TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] Our invention generally relates to variable speed drives and, more<br>
specifically, the invention is related to the field of variable speed drives with synchronous electric motors.<br>
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
10 [0002] A problem in connection with ordinary variable speed drives is that they either require high-resolution position measurement devices, or must utilize stepped current waveforms that increase motor heating and acoustical noise. These stepped current waveforms, referred to as trapezoidal waveforms or "6-step" waveforms when applied to a three-phase<br>
15 motor, can also produce significant torque ripple. The use of high-resolution position measurement devices requires that the position measurement device be properly aligned relative to the stator and rotor poles. Frequently this alignment is a manual operation, further increasing costs.<br>
20 [0003] Algorithms for performing sensorless control of electric motors abound, but generally fall into two categories, based on how they determine the rotor position at start-up. The first type applies a large current to the motor so as to force the rotor to a known position, irregardless of its current position.    This requires that the application be tolerant of backwards<br>
25    motion at start-up, and that the load on the motor at start-up is minimal.<br><br>
WO 2004/079880	PCT/US2004/006316<br>
The second type relies on special features incorporated into the rotor so as to allow the rotor position to be determined by applying and measuring signals to the stator windings. This type of algorithm is not suited for the majority of electric motors on the market, as they lack the requisite rotor<br>
5   features.<br>
[0004] It is well known to use phase-locked loops to produce an electrical signal whose frequency is a multiple of an input signal. In a variable-speed drive, this high-frequency signal can be used to estimate the rotor position given a low-resolution position input.   For example, a multiply by 360<br>
10 phase-lock loop can produce one degree resolution from a one pulse-per-revolution rotor position sensor. This approach has a critical limitation, however, in that it cannot be used at arbitrarily low speeds. In many applications, it is required to operate the motor at stall, and/or to reverse the motor direction.   In such a case, the phase locked-loop cannot remain<br>
15 synchronized, as the rotor may come to a halt or reverse direction between sensor input transitions.<br>
[0005] Thus, there is a need for a variable speed drive, one which allows for greater accuracy and control over variable speed motors when operating at speeds less than those optimal for accurate phase locked loop operation.<br>
20    SUMMARY<br>
[0006] This invention relates to a variable speed drive having a synchronous AC electric motor. In the disclosed embodiment, a variable speed drive operates in three modes: a first predetermined mode, in which a function    (e.g., trapezoidal current waveform) controls operation at low<br><br>
WO 2004/079880	PCT/US20O4/00G316<br>
motor speeds; a transitional mode, in which a transition function is applied to anticipate transitions of the first function, thus causing a smoothing of transitions at higher speeds; and a second predetermined (e.g., sinusoidal or smoothly-varying current) waveform at high speeds. This allows for the 5 reduction in required rotor position sensor resolution as compared to conventional synchronous variable speed drives, resulting in cost savings in the sensor device and associated wiring. Additionally, it is quieter and more efficient operation at high speed as compared to conventional trapezoidal-current/DC-brushless motor drives.<br>

20    DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0019] The   present   invention  comprises   a   polyphase   electric   motor<br>
equipped with plural binary output position sensors, configured such that<br>
each sensor asserts its output over a fixed angular range. Common sensors<br>
used for this purpose are Hall-effect devices exposed to the rotor's magnetic<br><br>
WO 2004/079880	PCT7US2004/006316<br>
field and optical encoders. The ranges over which the sensors assert their outputs are by design or are determined during a motor calibration procedure. When multiple sensors are used, their ranges partially overlap, and the rotor position can be known to be within a reduced angular range <br>
5  based on the state of the sensors. For three phase synchronous motors it is common to use three sensors, arranged so that one of the three sensors changes state every 60°. With such an arrangement the rotor can always be known to be within a 60° range. This is illustrated in FIG. 1. [0020] A second aspect of the preferred embodiment of the invention is a<br>
10 	polyphase inverter. This inverter includes control means to produce periodic phase currents as a function of motor position and command inputs. FIG. 2 shows one such three-phase implementation of such an inverter, although those skilled in the art will appreciate a variety of different circuit or algorithmic approaches may be used, depending on the<br>
15 application. The switches S1-S6 are controlled based on the commands of a processor (not shown) that are fed to the inverter controller. Alternatively, the controller shown could be a unified controller/processor, receiving sensor and timing inputs and outputting switch control signals. The processor/controller   can   be   a   hardware/circuitry   implementation   for<br>
20 carrying out the functionality described herein, or an appropriately configured processor performing operations on instructions or programs, or some combination of the two, depending on the design choices selected. Depending on the switch position, a desired waveform will be produced at<br><br>
WO 2004/079880		PCT/US20Q4/W6316<br>
outputs A-C (three-phase, in the illustrated case), and applied to the drive<br>
unit.<br>
[0021] The  third  aspect  of the  preferred  embodiment  is  a  position<br>
estimator used to interpolate the rotor position between transitions of the<br>
5 position sensors. In one embodiment, the position estimator is a phase-locked loop. The outputs of the phase locked loop are a measured speed ©m. and an angular value 6PLL, with a resolution that is significantly smaller than the resolution of the position sensors. A typical phase-locked loop is illustrated in FIG. 3, where fin is a signal generated from the transitions of<br>
10 the position sensors, and font, is the output of the phase-locked loop. In an alternative embodiment, the phase-lock loop is implemented purely in the software of the polyphase inverter control means. In another embodiment, the time between a plurality of sensor transition events is used to calculate the rotor speed, and this speed is used by the estimator to estimate the<br>
15    rotor position.<br>
[0022] A fourth aspect of the preferred embodiment is logic to calculate the angle 0ctri that will be fed to the inverter control. During initialisation, Qdvi is set to the midpoint of the angular range determined by the position sensors. After initialization, the control angle logic operates in one of three<br>
20 	modes, as determined by the measured motor speed. The three modes are referred to as the trapezoidal mode, transition mode, and continuous mode. The three modes are defined by two threshold speeds, w1 and w2. The control angle logic is in trapezoidal mode when abs(wpli) <w1 in continuous mode when abs>w2 and in transition mode otherwise.<br><br>
WO 2004/079880	PCT/US2004/006316<br>
[0023] In the discussion that follows, all speeds are assumed to be in the positive direction for clarity, but this is not a limitation of the invention. [0024] In the preferred embodiment, the threshold speeds are selected such that when the motor speed is greater than w1, the system inertia is<br>
5    sufficient to guarantee that the motor will not come to a stop before the next sensor transition has been reached.    The second threshold, 002, is selected such to be the speed at which the position estimation means provides sufficient accuracy to be used by the inverter control means.<br>
 [0025] When in trapezoidal mode, qctrl remains constant until a transition<br>
10 is detected on one of the position sensors. After the sensor transition, 6ctri is raised or lowered at a fixed rate, wctrl, much greater than wmin, to the midpoint value of the new angular-range determined by the position sensors. This is shown in FIG. 4. As a result, the maximum error between qctrl and the actual rotor position is never greater than half the width of the<br>
15    current sensor interval.  FIG. 5 shows this logic in flowchart form.  When the inverter is three-phase and the control, means is designed to produce sinusoidal   currents   as   a   function   of (wctrl  trapezoidal   currents  with controlled rise and fall times are produced, as shown in FIG. 6.<br>
 [0026] When in transition mode, the position output of the phase-locked<br>
20 loop, 0PLL, is used to anticipate the sensor transition by A*F(©PU.), where F is a non-decreasing function equal to zero below wi and 0.5 above w2, and A is the width of the current sensor interval. As illustrated in FIG. 9, the control angle logic holds qetrl constant until qpll &gt; (qmax - *F(w)), where 8max is the angular position of the next sensor transition. When this condition is<br><br>
WO 2004/079880	PCT/US2004/006316<br>
met, 6ctri is raised at a fixed rate wctrl greater than wPLL to (Wax. qctrl is then held constant until the next sensor transition is detected, at which point qctri is again raised at w ctri speed to the midpoint of the new sensor interval. When the motor is at constant speed or accelerating, these two transitions 5 will occur without any delay between them. In one embodiment of the invention, wctri is set to w2. In another embodiment, wctri is adjusted based on wPU. in such a way that it equals w2 when wPLL equals w2, but can take on different values at lower speeds. In either embodiment, the transition mode results in wctri equaling w2 when wPU, equals w2.   Furthermore, function F<br>
10 ensures that the transitions begin in the middle of the sensor interval when ©PLL equals w2. In combination, the transition mode operates without any delays between transitions when wPU, equals w2, preparing the system for continuous mode. FIG. 7 illustrates the operation of transition mode. In this illustration, the transitions at 60 and 120° are shown as occurring<br>
15	early, the transition at 180*' is perfectly timed, and the transitions at 240 and 300° are late.   FIG. 7 describes the transition-mode logic in flowchart form.     FIG. 8 shows the effect of transition mode on a three-phase sinusoidal current inverter. <br>
[0027] In an alternative embodiment of transition mode, when wPLL &gt; ((Wu: -<br>
20 Ñ*F(w)), qctri is raised at a fixed rate wctri, much greater than w1, to the midpoint of the next sensor interval. This eliminates the plateaus at 9max , and produces symmetrical current waveforms.<br>
[0028] When a sensor transition occurs in continuous mode, wctri is set to (qPLL +), E is a small positive value when qpll. 
 <br>
WO 2004/07988(1	PCT/US2004/006316<br>
0 10<br>
value when qPLL &gt;qsensor, where qsenaor is the angle of the sensor transition, qctri is then used to continuously update qctri. When qPLL is approximately equal to qctri, a flag is set to indicate that the continuous mode is synchronized and 9ctri is continuously set to qpll. This flag remains set until<br>
5 wpll. is less than w2. In this fashion, the transition to controlling the polyphase inverter directly from the position estimation means occurs without an abrupt shift in control angle. FIG. 10 describes this logic in flowchart form. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the logic for the three control modes is implemented in the software of the polyphase<br>
10    inverter control means.<br>
[0029] Referring to PIG. 11, an exemplary embodiment of an electric vehicle 1110 according to the invention includes a plurality of wheels 1111, 1112, 1113, and 1114 and a vehicle chassis 1115. The wheels 1113 and 1114 are coupled to electric motors 1120 through gear boxes (not shown). The<br>
15 wheels 1113 and 1114 may be mounted by any appropriate suspension means for the vehicle being designed, including independent suspensions or by axle, and may be front, rear, or all wheel drive systems. In one exemplary embodiment the vehicle is a taxi, but it may include recreational vehicles or larger ones like buses, and may also apply to hybrid vehicles<br>
20 (which include alternate forms of propulsion). The electric motor 1120 is powered by a battery 1140 and controlled by motor controllers 1130. According to this exemplary embodiment, the electric motor 1120 is an AC synchronous motor, including permanent magnets such as rare earth<br><br>
WO 2004/079880	PCT/US2004/006316<br><br>
magnets for creating or inducing a magnetic field on the rotating portion (rotor, not shown) of the motor. Sensors are also located on the rotor, [0030] Thus, the present invention provides an improved variable speed drive for an AC synchronous motor, such as that of an electric vehicles. The<br>
5 plural modes of operation allows for the reduction in required rotor position sensor resolution as compared to conventional synchronous variable speed drives, resulting in cost savings in the sensor device and associated wiring. It is also quieter and more efficient operation at high speed as compared to conventional trapezoidal-current/DC-brushless motor drives.<br>
10 [0031] Of course, those skilled in the art will appreciate how a variety of alternatives are possible for the individual elements, and their arrangement, described above, while still falling within the scope of the invention. Thus, while it is important to note that the present invention has been described in the contest of a particular three phase electric motor<br>
15 and inverter, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the components and processes of the present invention are capable of being implemented with different inverters, sensors, plural motors (e.g., for each wheel), etc., including replacement with equivalently functioning hardware chips and/or software for key components.<br>
20 [0032] In conclusion, the above description has been presented for purposes of illustration and description of an embodiment of the invention, but is not intended to be exhaustive or limited to the form disclosed. This embodiment was chosen and described in order to explain the principles of the invention, show its practical application, and to enable those of ordinary<br><br>

Abstract<br>
This invention relates to a variable speed drive with synchronous AC motor. In the disclosed embodiment, a variable speed drive operates in three modes: a first predetermined mode, in which a function (e.g., trapezoidal current waveform) controls operation at low motor speeds; a transitional mode, in which a transition function is applied to anticipate transitions of the first function, thus causing a smoothing of transitions at higher speeds; and a second predetermined (e.g., sinusoidal or smoothly-varying current) waveform at high speeds. This allows for the reduction in required rotor position sensor resolution as compared to conventional synchronous variable speed drives, resulting in cost savings in the sensor device and associated wiring. Additionally, it is quieter and more efficient operation at high speed as compared to conventional trapezoidal-current/DC-brushless motor drives.<br></w1></td>
