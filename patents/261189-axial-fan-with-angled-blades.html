AXIAL FAN Description<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an axial fan with blades angled in the fan plane of rotation.<br>
The fan according to the present invention may be used in various applications, for example, to move air through a heat exchanger, or radiator, of a cooling system for the engine of a motor vehicle or the like; or to move air through the heat exchanger of the heating system and/or through the evaporator of the air conditioning system of the interior of a motor vehicle. Moreover, the fan according to the present invention may be used to move air in fixed air conditioning or heating systems for houses.<br>
Background Art<br>
Fans of this type must satisfy various requirements, including: low noise level, high efficiency, compactness, capacity to achieve good pressure and flow rate values.<br>
In particular, achieving good general performance while keeping noise levels down requires careful design of the blades and the profiles of which they consist.<br>
A fan of this type is known from United States patent US-6 241 474, which describes a low noise fan with blades whose angle or pitch decreases gradually from the hub to the tip over a predetermined extension of the radius, then their angle increases again towards the tip. The blades are connected to one another by an external ring.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
One aim of the present invention is to provide a fan which has good general performance with a low noise level.<br><br>
WO 2006/006043	PCT/IB2005/001898<br>

According to one aspect of the present invention, an axial fan as specified in claim 1 is presented.<br>
The dependent claims refer to preferred and advantageous embodiments of the invention.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
The invention is described in more detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings, which illustrate a preferred, non-limiting embodiment, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a front view of the fan in accordance with the present invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic front view of a blade of the fan illustrated in the previous figure;<br>
Figure 3 is a cross-section of several profiles at various fan diameters; and<br>
Figure 4 is a cross-section of a profile and the respective geometric characteristics.<br>
Detailed description of the Preferred Embodiments of the Invention<br>
With reference to the accompanying drawings, the fan 1 rotates about an axis 2 and comprises a central hub 3 to which a plurality of blades 4 are connected, the blades being curved in the fan 1 plane of rotation XY.<br>
The blades 4 have a root 5, a tip 6 and are delimited by a convex leading edge 7 and a concave trailing edge 8.<br>
For the best results in terms of efficiency, flow rate and air pressure, the fan 1 rotates with a direction of rotation V, illustrated in Figures 1 and 4, so that the tip 6 of each blade 4 encounters the air flow after the root 5.<br>
Maintaining the direction of rotation V, the fan 1 can be produced as a blowing fan or as a suction fan, by suitably modifying and adapting the profiles of the blades. The following description refers to a blowing fan by way of example.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates an example of the geometric characteristics of a blade 4: the leading edge 7 is delimited by two circular arc segments 9, 10, and the trailing edge 8 is delimited by one circular arc segment 11. In the leading edge 7, a<br><br>
WO 2006/006043	PCT/1B2005/001898<br>
3<br>
radius labelled Rl is the point of change from one circular arc segment to the other circular arc segment.<br>
According to the example in Figure 2, the general dimensions of the projection of a blade 4 in the plane XY are summarised in table 1:<br>
Table 1 - dimensions of a blade 4.<br>
	Radius of internal segment (mm)	Radius of change (mm)	Radius of external segment (mm)<br>
Leading edge (Ref. 7)	133.57 (Ref. 9)	97.75 (Ref. Rl)	83.23 (Ref. 10)<br>
Radius (mm)<br>
Trailing edge (Ref. 8)	S7.25 (Ref. 11)<br>
The general geometric characteristics of the blade 4 are defined relative to a hub with 110 mm diameter, that is to say, the blade 4 has a minimum radius Rmin = 55 mm at the root 5, and a 3 02 mm external diameter, giving it a maximum radius Rmax = 151 mm at the tip 6, meaning that the blade 4 has a 96 mm radial extension.<br>
As illustrated in the accompanying drawings, the outside of the fan may be fitted with a connecting ring 12 which may be several millimetres thick, meaning that the fan 1 in the example embodiment provided has an overall diameter of approximately 310 mm.<br>
As is known, one of the functions of the connecting ring is to stiffen the outer part of the blades 4 so as to promote maintenance of the angles of angles of incidence and to improve the aerodynamic performance of the outer profiles of the blades, reducing the formation of vortices at the tip 6 of the blades 4.<br>
However, it should be noticed that good results were also achieved using a fan made according to the present invention without the connecting ring.<br>
Considering that the blade 4 has a minimum radius Rmin = 55 mm and a maximum radius Rmax = 151 mm, the leading edge 7 has a radius Rl, where the change in the circular arc occurs, corresponding to around 44% of the radial extension of the leading edge 7, an extension which, as already indicated, is 96 mm.<br>
The part 9 of the leading edge 7 closest to the root 5 consists of a circular arc with a radius equal to around 88% of the<br><br>
WO 2006/006043	PCT/IB2005/001898<br>
4<br>
radius Rmax, and the part 10 of the leading edge 7 closest to the<br>
tip 6 consists of a circular arc segment with a radius equal to<br>
around 55% of the radius Rmax of the blade 4.<br>
As regards the trailing edge 8, the circular arc segment 11<br>
has a radius equal to around 44.5% of the radius Rmax of the blade<br>
4.<br>
The dimensions in percentages are summarised in table 2: Table 2 - blade 4 dimensions in percentage form.<br>
	Internal segment radius (% ofRmax)	Change radius (% of blade extension = Rmax-Rmin)	External segmentradius (% of Rmax)<br>
Leading edge (Ref. 7)	88 (Ref. 9)	44 (Ref. Rl)	55 (Ref. 10)<br>
Radius (% of Rmax)<br>
Trailing edge (Ref. 8)	44.5 (Ref. 11)<br>
Satisfactory results in terms of flow rate, pressure and noise were achieved even with values around these percentage dimensions. In particular, variations of 10% more or less on the above-mentioned dimensions are possible.<br>
The percentage ranges relative to the dimensions are summarised in table 3:<br>
Table 3 - Blade 4 edges percentage ranges.<br>
	Internal segment radius {% of Rmax)	Change radius {% of blade extension = % of Rmax-Rmin)	External segment radius {% of Rmax)<br>
Leading edge (Ref. 7)	79 - 97 (Ref. 9)	40 - 48.5 (Ref. Rl)	49.5 - 60.5 (Ref. 10)<br>
Radius (.% Rmax)<br>
Trailing edge (Ref. 8)	40 - 49 (Ref. 11)<br>
For the leading edge 7, in the circular arc segment change zone, there may be a suitable fillet so that the edge 7 is continuous and free of cusps.<br>
As regards the width or angular extension of the blades, again with reference to Figure 2, the projection of the blade 4 in the plane XY has an amplitude, at the root 5, represented by an angle Bl of around 60 degrees and an amplitude, at the tip 6, represented<br><br>
WO 2006/006043	PCT/IB2005/001898<br>
5<br>
by an angle B2 of around 2 6 degrees.<br>
Again, satisfactory results were achieved in terms of flow rate, pressure and noise with values of angles Bl, B2 around these values. In particular, variations of 10% more or less than the angles indicated are possible. The angle Bl may vary from 54 to 66 degrees, whilst the angle B2 may vary from 23 to 29 degrees.<br>
In general, it must also be considered that, due to the plastic material used to make fans, variations in all of the dimensions and angles of 5% more or less must all be considered within the values indicated. Considering the respective bisecting lines and following the fan 1 direction of rotation V, the tip 6 is further back than the root 5 by an angle B3 of around 26 degrees.<br>
Other angles characteristic of the blade 4 are angles B4, B5, B6, B7 (Figure 2) formed by the respective tangents to the two edges 7, 8 and by the respective lines passing through points M, N, S, T: the angles B4 and B5 are respectively 28 and 54 degrees and the angles B6, B7 are respectively 28 and 45 degrees.<br>
There may be between three and seven blades 4 and, according to a preferred embodiment, there are five blades 4 and they are separated by equal angles.<br>
Each blade 4 consists of a set of aerodynamic profiles which gradually join up starting from the root 5 towards the tip 6.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates seven profiles 13 - 19, relative to respective sections at various intervals along the radial extension of a blade 4.<br>
The profiles 13 - 19 are also formed by the geometric characteristics of which an example is provided in Figure 4 for one of the profiles.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 4, each profile 13 - 19 is formed by a continuous centre line Ll without points of inflection or cusps and by a chord L2.<br>
Each profile 13 - 19 is also formed by two angles BLE, BTE of incidence with the leading edge and with the trailing edge, said angles formed by the respective tangents to the centre line Ll at the point of intersection with the leading edge and with the trailing edge and a respective straight line perpendicular to the plane XY passing through the corresponding points of intersection.<br><br>
WO 2006/006043	PCT/IB2005/001898<br>
6<br>
With reference to the seven profiles 13 - 19, table 4 below indicates the angles of the leading edge BLE and of the trailing edge BTE, the length of the centre line LI and the chord L2 of the profiles of a blade 4.<br>
Table 4 - Radial position, angles of leading and trailing edges, length of centre line and chord of the profiles of a blade 4.<br>

19	100	151	85.28	54.85	72.18	71.14<br>
It should be noticed that the thickness of each profile 13 -19, according to a typical trend of wing-shaped profiles, initially increases, reaching a maximum value S-MAX at around 40% of the length of the centre line Ll, then it gradually decreases as far as the trailing edge 8.<br>
In percentages, the thickness S-MAX is around 1.6% of the radius Rmax; the thickness of the profiles is distributed symmetrically relative to the centre line Ll.<br>
The positions of the profiles 13 - 19 relative to the radial extension of a blade 4 and the relative values for the thickness, trend according to their position with respect to the centre line Ll are summarised in table 5.<br>

The profiles 13 - 19 are preferably delimited with a semicircular fillet, on the leading edge 7 side, and with a truncation created using a segment of a straight line on the trailing edge 8 side.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, good general performance was achieved in terms of the noise, flow rate and pressure supplied by the fan disclosed even with thicker profiles. According to said alternative embodiment, the positions of the profiles 13 - 19 relative to the radial extension of a blade and the relative thickness trend values according to their position with respect to the centre line Ll are summarised in table 7.<br>
It should also be noticed that, in this embodiment, the thickness S-MAX is reached at 30% of the length of the centre line Ll.<br>

As may be seen, in both embodiments, the profiles 13 - 19 have the same thickness in the corresponding positions (0% of LI, 20% of LI, ..., 80% of LI, etc.) along the extension of the centre line Ll.<br>
The first embodiment with the thinner profiles has advantages in terms of lightness, cost and ease of moulding.<br>
The second embodiment with the thicker profiles has advantages in terms of aerodynamic efficiency, since the thicker profiles have better performance to prevent stalling.<br>
