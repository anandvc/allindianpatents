3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention is concerned witb fragranced starch based solid cosmetic compositions,, especially foamed solids such as pellets, releasixig skin benefit ingredients upon contact of the solids with water.<br>
The Related Art<br>
Many commercial cosmetic products contain water as the single largest formulation componeat. Other than its carrier function, water delivers hut little cosmetic benefit. Removal of water results in concentrated products needing less packaging, less shelf space and incurs lower transportation costs. Any water necessary for the formulation may later be added by the eventual consumer during application of the product. Essentially waterless systems are therefore ecologically more friendly.<br>
Beyond ecological considerations, there has been a trend towards the marketing of unit dose products. For instance, U.S. Patent 5,063,057 (Spellman et al.) and U.S. Patent 5,270,054 (Bertolini et al.) have disclosed gelatin capsules filled with anhydrous<br><br>
liquid skin treatments. These are released by puncture or through twisting off a neck segment of the capsule.<br>
Biodegradable hydrophilic polyurethane foams have been reported in U.S. Patent 4,132,839 (Marans et al.). These foams are said to have utility as handy expandable sponges for personal use. Reportedly they may be prepared with detergents, lotions, perfumes and biostats.<br>
In U.S. Patent 4,673,085 (Fuisz) a sugar in fiber form is described containing a cosmetic active agent releasable when the fibers are dissolved in water.<br>
A body of literature has developed surrounding biodegradable starches. Many are based upon destructurized starches that can be foamed or molded into various shapes. Included in this literature are U.S. Patent 4,900,361 (Sachetto et al.), U.S. Patent 5,382,611 (Stepto et al.), U.S. Patent 5,480,923 {Schmid et al.), U.S. Patent 5,852,114 (Locmis et al.), U.S. Patent 6,001,385 (Van Be Wijdeven) and U.S. Patent 6,277,899 Bl (Bastiolli et al.). of particular interest for cosmetics are U.S. Patent 5,763,500, U.S. Patent 5,925,380 and U.S. Patent 6,007,830 all assigned to L'Greal, These patents disclose expanded starch-rich thermoplastic hollow particles useful as make-up or hygiene compositions activated through re-hydration.<br><br>
A problem with the known art is delivery of a fragrance with the cosmetic formulated starch-derived solids,<br>
A solid cosmetic cormposition, preferably a foamed solid cosmetic<br>
composition is provided including:<br>
(i)  a water dissolvable solid, preferably foamed, carrier<br>
comprising a destructurized starch; (ii)  a fragrance deposited onto the destructurized starch; and (iii) at least one cosmetic agent incorporated into the solid<br>
carrier in an amount sufficient to provide a cosmetic<br>
benefit.<br>
DETAILBD DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Now it has been found that a fragrance is expressed with greater intensity when added to a destructurized starch rather than one incorporated into an unmodified type of starch.<br>
The solid material is preferably formed into tablets, pellets, sheets, beads or shaped articles (e.g. a sculpted fish}. When immersed in water, the solid and preferably foamed starch rapidly dissolves releasing the cosmetic agent which can then deposit or treat human skin and/or hair.<br>
The term "destructurized starch* means that a starch is substantially released from the cells and granules in which it is<br><br>
turally found. More particularly, "destructurized starch" is a<br>
lecular dispersion of starch and water.  When formulated this<br>
iterial is molecularly homogeneous (with both amylose and<br>
mylopectin dispersed uniformly throughout the material), is<br>
morphous, has no ordered molecular structure, has relatively<br>
high molecular-weight amylopectin, is not highly brittle or<br>
friable and has superior mechanical properties.<br>
"Destructurized starch" is generated under certain conditions of temperature, pressure, shear, limited water and sufficient time. For instance, natural starch can be treated at elevated temperature in a closed vessel, thereby at elevated pressure, to form a melt. A typical process is conveniently carried out in an injection molding machine or extruder. The starch is fed through a hopper onto a rotating, reciprocating screw. The feed material moves along the screw towards the tip. During this process, temperature of the starch material is increased by means of external heaters around a barrel of the extruder and by the shearing action of the screw. The particulate feed becomes gradually molten starting in the feed zone and continuing in the compression zone. Molten feed is then conveyed through the metering zone, where homogenlzation of the melt occurs, to the end of the screw. Molten material at the tip can then be further treated by injection molding or extrusion or any other known technique to treat thermoplastic melts.<br><br>
Starting natural starch material useful in the present invention preferably has a high amylose content (particularly is one of at least 45% by weight of amylose). It is well known that natural starch is composed of two fractions, the molecular arrangement of one being linear and the other being branched. The linear fraction of starch is known as amylose and the branched fraction amylopectin. Starches from different sources, e.g., potato, corn, tapioca and rice, etc., are characterized by different relative proportions of the amylose and amylopectin components. Some plant species have been genetically developed which are characterized by a. large preponderance of one fraction over the other. For instance, certain varieties of corn which normally contain amylose have been developed which yield starch composed of over 45% amylose. These hybrid varieties have been referred to as high amylose or amylomaize.<br>
Suitable high amylose starches useful herein are any starches with an amylose content of at least 45%, preferably at least 65% by weight. While high amylose corn starch has been especially suitable, other starches which are useful include those derived from any plant species which produces or can be made to produce a high amylose content starch, e.g., corn, peas, barley and rice. Additionally, high amylose starch can be obtained by separation or isolation such as the fractionation of a native starch material or by blending isolated amylose with a native starch.<br><br>
In preparing the shaped products of this invention, an extrusion process, either alone or in combination with other forming operations, may he used depending on the desired type of final product. The expanded starch product leaving the extruder is typically in a rope or cylindrical form. By varying the size and configuration of the die opening of the extruder, different forms such as sheets of varying thickness and widths, irregular profiles and other shapes may be obtained. When expanded products of different shapes and design are desired, other forming operations subsequent to the extrusion operation may be utilized. One such readily adaptable technique involves thermoforming. In this operation, a material is heated to a temperature at which it is pliable or shapable and then forced against a mold by applying vacuum, air or mechanical pressure. After the expanded starch product of this invention leaves the extruder, it is still quite hot and malleable and therefore well suited for the thermoforming step.<br>
Other methods of forming the solid cosmetic products, particularly the foamed solids, may be used in addition to the extrusiorn/thermoforming operations discussed above. Such methods include injection molding, blow molding, extrusion-blow molding and stamping, as well as combinations of these and other methods.<br>
A particularly advantageous form of the foamed solid cosmetic products of this invention is that of a honeycomb. By the term honeycomb is meant a round or polygonal shaped object from which<br><br>
smaller pieces may be broken off, the smaller pieces being defined by fracture or fracturable sections of the honeycomb. Mhen a user requires the product, the user may break off a section from the honeycomb and throw this into their bath.<br>
Solid carriers and particularly foamed solid carriers of this invention advantageously are but not limited to being expanded, biodegradable starch material having a uniform, closed cell structure with low density and good resilience and compressibility properties. The uniform, closed cell structure with its characteristic tiny bubble formation, not only results in a Styrofoam-like appearance and density, but gives it resilience and compressibility. A closed cell structure is defined as one having largely nonconnecting cells, as opposed to open cells which are largely interconnecting or defined as two or more cells interconnected by broken, punctured or missing cell walls. The tiny bubble formation generally results in a small cell size of typically about 100 to 600 microns. This is accomplished by extrusion of a high amylose starch at a total moisture or water content of 211 or less by weight and at a temperature of from about 150° to 250°C.<br>
Amount of destructurized starch within the solid carrier may range from about 10 to 100%, preferably from 50 to 100%, and optimally about 100%. Modified starch may also be used in forming the foamed solid carrier. The amount of total foamed solid carrier may range from about 10% to about 99%, preferably<br><br>
from about 70 to about 95% by weight of the composition. By "modified" is meant that the starch can be derivatized through a typical chemical reaction such as esterification, etherification, oxidation, acid hydrolysis, cross-linking and enzyme conversion. Typically, modified starches include esters, such as acetates and the half-esters of dicarboxylic acids, particularly the alkenylsuccinate acids; ethers, such as the hydrcayethyl- and hydroxyprcpyl-starches and starches reacted with hydrophobic cationic epoxides? starches oxidized with hypochlorite; starches reacted with cross-linking agents such as phosphorous oxychloride, epichlorohydrin, and phosphate derivatives prepared by reaction with sodium or potassium orthopbosphate or tripolyphoBphate and combinations thereof. These and other conventional modifications of starch are described in publications such as "Starch: Chemistry and Technology", Second Edition, edited by Roy L. Whistler et al.. Chapter X: Starch Derivatives: Production and Uses by M.W. Rutenberg et al., Academic Press, Inc., 1984.<br>
One especially advantageous modification of the starches that may be used in this invention is the etherification with alkylene oxides, particularly those containing 2 to 6, preferably 2 to 4, carbon atoms. Ethylene oxide, propylene oxide and butylene oxide are exemplary compounds useful in etherifying the starting starch materials, with propylene oxide being especially preferred. Varying amounts of such compounds may be used depending on the desired properties and economics. Generally, up to 15% or more<br><br>
and preferably, up to about 10% by weight, based on the weight of starch will be used.<br>

These are available, for example, as SF 1075 methylphenyl fluid (sold by General Electric Company) and 556 Cosmetic Grade Fluid (sold by Dow Corning Corporation). Useful polyether siloxane copolymers include, for example, a polyoxyalkylene ether copolymer having a viscosity of about 1200 to 1500 eentistokes at 25°C. Such a fluid is available as SF-1066 organosilicone surfactant (sold by General Electric Company). Cetyl dimethicone copolyol and cetyl dimethicone are especially preferred because these materials also function as emulaifiers and emollients.<br>
In certain types of compositions according to the present invention, the amount of silicone may need to be highly regulated. Besides their emollient properties, silicones can have a significant effect upon foaming properties. For instance, when the compositions of the present invention are intended to be hydratable into a shaving cream, a controlled amount of silicone may be necessary as an anti-foam to quench any foaming by surfactants in the shaving cream which undesirably may tend to foam during the manufacturing process. On the other hand, too much silicone may prevent eventual foaming when a product such as a shaving cream or shampoo (when hydrated)  is ready for<br><br>
utilization by a consumer. Amounts of the silicone for anti-foam purposes may range from about 0.00001 to about 1%, preferably from about 0.0001 to about 0.01, optimally from about 0.05 to about 0.1% by weight of the composition.<br>
Suitable fatty alcohols and acids include those compounds having from 10 to 24 carbon atoms. Especially preferred are such compounds as cetyl, myristyl, palmitic and stearyl alcohols and acids.<br>
Exemplary hydrocarbons which may serve as emollients are those having hydrocarbon chains anywhere from 12 to 30 carbon atoms. Specific examples include mineral oil, petroleum jelly, squalene and isoparaffins.<br>
Amounts of the emollients may range from about 0.1 to about 99%, preferably from about 25 to about 90%, optimally from about 35 to about 75% by weight of the composition.<br>
Humectants of the polyhydric alcohol-type may also be included in the compositions of this invention. The humectant aids in increasing the effectiveness of the emollient, reduces scaling, stimulates removal of built-up scale and improves skin feel. Typical polyhydric alcohols include glycerol, diglycerol, polyalkylene glycols and more preferably alkylene polyols and their derivatives, including propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polyethylene glycol and derivatives<br><br>
thereof, sorbitol, hydroxypropyl sorbitol, hexylene glycol, 1,2-butylene glycol, 1,2,6-hexanetriol, ethoxylated glycerol, propoxylated glycerol and mixtures thereof. For best results the humectant is preferably glycerol. The amount of humectant may range anywhere from 0.5 to 30%, preferably between 1 and 15% by weight of the composition.<br>
Illustrative conditioners of the present invention are the quaternary ammonium salts. Typical of such materials are guar hydrcxypropyltritnonium chloride and guaternized cellulose such as Polymer JR7.<br>
Cosmetic agents of this invention may include sunscreens. These are materials commonly employed to block ultraviolet light. Suitable sunscreens are the derivatives of PABA, cinnamate and salicylate. For example, octyl methoxycinnamate and 2-hydrcxy-4-methoxy benzophenone (also known as Qxybenzone) can be used. Octyl methoxycinnamate and 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy benzophenone are commercially available under the trademarks, Parsol MCX and Benzophenone-3, respectively. Also useful is AVOBBNZENE sold as Parsol 1789. The exact amount of sunscreen employed can vary depending upon the degree of protection desired from the sun's UV radiation.<br>
Anti-aging actives are best exemplified by the 2-hydroxyalkanoic acids, prostaglandins, retinoic acids, retinol and fatty esters thereof, ceramides and their derivatives.  These agents may be<br><br>
present anywhere from about 0.00001 to about 15%, preferably from about 0.0001 to about 5$ optimally between about 0.01 and about 1% by weight of the total composition. Most preferred of the actives mentioned above are 2-hydroxyoctanoic acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, retinol and pigskin or bovine-brain lipid ceramides as well as salts of these actives.<br>
Vitamins may also be included as anti-aging actives. Especially preferred is vitamin A palmitate (retinyl palmitate), Vitamin C tetraisopalmitate (ascorbyl tetraisopalmitate) and vitamin E linoleate (tocopheryl linoleate). Other esters or alcohols of vitamins A and E may also be utilized.<br>

EXAMPLE 15<br>
A series of re-hydratable lotions containing a variety of skin benefit agents ace reported below, These are formulated with destructurized starch into foamed cosmetic compositions.<br><br><br>
A reactor is charged with the components listed under Phase A. The combination is melted at 85°c with strong mixing. Phase B is added to the reactor while maintaining a strong agitation. After stirring for 10 minutes, the combined phases axe allowed to cool under moderate agitation. After the solution is cooled and solidified, the material is powderized within a blender, Hammermill or other suitable pulverization mechanism.<br><br>
The foamed solids incorporating the re-hydratable lotions identified above are prepared according to the following process. An amount of the re-hydratable lotion sample is fed Into a heated extruder along with zea mays (destructurized) starch at a temperature from 80 to 210°C. Relative weight ratio of lotion sample to starch is 10:90. In a first stage of this process the components are conveyed and mixed in an extruder for periods of time of the order of 2 to 50 seconds. During mixing, the blend is subjected to shearing stresses. Thereafter, a degassing phase occurs under vacuum to obtain a melt temperature from 130 to 180°C with a water qontent less than 5% to thereby avoid creation of bubbles at the outlet of the extruder. The melt is then extruded directly into stranded, spaghetti-like form. The strands are then fed between a set of rollers to form a sheet-like material. Fragrance oil at 0.10% by weight of the sheet is sprayed onto the sheet. Subsequent thereto, the sheet is cut into 10 x 20 cm towelettea. Each is packaged within a sealed foil pouch. When ready to use, a consumer removes the foil, places the towelette under water and thereby re-hydrates the lotion trapped within the starch carrier.<br>
EXAMPLE 16<br>
A   further   series   of   skin   lotions,   in   this   instance   without emulsifiers, are presented as formulations F through K.<br><br><br>
The re-hydratable lotions after preparation are headed at 60°C under agitation. The mixtures are then each added to an extruder with zea mays (destructurized) starch at a 10% loading of lotion based on total solid composition. Sheets of foamed starch impregnated re-hydratable lotions are obtained from the extruder. The sheets are then sprayed with a fragrance oil achieving a loading of 0.1% by weight of the total foamed sheet.<br>
EXAMPLE 17<br>
A set of re-hydratable self-heating lotions are formulated below intended for incorporation into foamed solid cosmetic compositions of the present invention.<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 19 A hair color concentrate composition is herein illustrated. Addition of water releases the colorant when ready for use and application onto the hair, the composition is prepared by first extruding a sheet of destructurized starch and from this forming pellets with average spherical diameter of about 2 man. A hair color concentrate cosmetic agent with fragrance is sprayed onto the destructurized starch to form the final cosmetic hair color composition. Components of the cosmetic agent/fragrance liquid sprayed composition are reported in the Table below.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 31<br>
This Example evaluates the benefits of utilizing a destructurized starch as a carrier for fragrance.<br>
A pellatized destructurized cornstarch was utilized for the present experiment. These pellets were purchased from Uline Shipping Supplies Corporation, model no. S-1564.<br>
The pellets were then placed in a GE 450 watt, 12 speed blender 2 cups at a time. The pellets were then blended on a "high" setting for 10 seconds resulting in particles between less than 0.1 mm and about 8 mm in diameter. The chopped starch was then poured into a 400 ml beaker up to the 200 ml mark and 0.5 grams of fragrance was sprayed onto the starch, using a spray bottle. The starch and fragrance were then mixed together using a spatula for about 20 seconds. The fragranced and mixed starch was then poured into a 4 oz. (120 ml) jar until it was % full and was then capped. The rest of the fragrances starch was discarded.<br><br>
Thereafter a 400 ml beaker was filled with 200 ml of unmodified cornstarch, Pure-Dent B700, lot #s0203106 from Grain Processing. In the same way, 0.5 grams of fragrance was sprayed onto the starch and it was mixed in the beaker with a spatula for 20 seconds. The starch was then poured into a 4 oz. (120 ml) jar until it was ℅ full. The jar was then capped. " The rest of the fragranced starch was then discarded.<br>
The next morning, the caps were removed, the jars were left to sit for one minute with the cap off, and panel testing started. A panelist was given both jars, one filled with chopped, fragranced destructurized starch and the other filled with fragranced unmodified starch and asked, *Which one smells like it expresses fragrance more strongly?" Panelists were allowed to smell each sample as long as they wished. Panelists were also allowed to switch back and forth and smell each sample as often as they wished.<br>
All five of the panelists identified the destructurized starch sample as a clear winner for expressing fragrance over a prolonged period of time.<br><br>
