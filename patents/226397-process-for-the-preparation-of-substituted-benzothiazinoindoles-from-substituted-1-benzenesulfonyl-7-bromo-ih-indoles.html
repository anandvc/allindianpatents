PROCESS FOR PREPARING SUBSTITUTED BENZOTHIAZINOINDOLES Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a process for the preparation of substituted benzothiazinoindoles from a substituted 7-bromoindole derivative, formula (II), which is cyclized to obtain compound of formula (I) using suitable catalyst and solvents.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, the invention comprises treating the compound of formula (II), with a suitable palladium (0) or (II) catalyst complex in presence of a suitable base dissolved / suspended in a solvent at suitable temperature range under inert atmosphere / degassed conditions. Background of the Invention<br>
The Heck-reaction was first reported by Moritani, Fujiwara and Heck (see references) in the late 1960's. There are several reports on use of intramolecular Heck reaction for the preparation of polycyclic ring systems. Some of these were novel scaffolds were further explored for their potential use in medicine. Our objective was to synthesize compounds having the general structure (I), which are useful as medicaments. The initial strategy was as described in      Scheme      (II)      below      and      involved      cyclization      of     substituted      l-(2'-<br><br><br>
The synthetic approach depicted in Scheme (II) above, had several drawbacks;<br>
1.	Only a few compounds with the desired tetracyclic ring system could be obtained.<br>
2.	The reactant to product conversion rate was low. This issue becomes critical when the final product is being synthesized and the reaction involves catalyst like palladium. This phenomenon was observed particularly when the substitutents on the ring had varying electronic or steric effects.<br>
3.	Sometimes the product obtained needed additional efforts to purify.<br>
4.	The average yield of all the individual reactions was generally on the lower end.<br>
5.	It required large number of various substituted 2-Bromoarylsulfonylchlorides to prepare the compound library. Further, when such multiple substituted aryl sulfonyl chlorides were used, sometimes the reaction did not proceed due to the steric and / or electronic effects of the various substitutions. It should be noted that monosubstituted / disubstituted aryl sulphonyl chlorides are not general utility chemicals and are expensive and synthetically challenging.<br>
6.	The special case arises when R3is hydrogen; a mixture of two isomeric compounds is<br><br>
and often the major product is the un-desired tetracyclic ring system, cyclized through C2 of Indole (Formula III), which in-turn can be expected due to the favourable steric and thermodynamic factors (Refer WO2004/000849A2, WO2004/055026A1). Further the isolation, purification and even the identification of the two isomeric compounds was a daunting task. Further with the change in substitution pattern in the reactant, the ratio of two isomers obtained would change.<br>
As a result of this, the number of compounds obtained were limited to the availability of particular substituted-2'-Bromoarylsulfonylchlorides. Hence, in order to increase the diversity of substitutions in this ring system we began to explore the new chemistry for the synthesis of ring system defined by compound of formula (I). In those efforts we found that<br><br>
Scheme (I) detailed below, stands to have a better potential in solving the problem of increasing the diversity, purity,, yields and economy of synthesis. The key highlight is the use of substituted 7-bromoindoles, which participates in the Heck reaction. The application helps to eliminate numerous limitations stated above and adds in to the diversity of targeted tetracyclic ring system.<br>
The result may be due to the distribution of electrons, ease of formation of complex with palladium catalyst, easier conversion into product due to favourable stereochemistry and other general principles of shifting the equilibrium of the reaction more towards the products thus improving the yields. The reaction favours only one product and the purity of product obtained is good. The starting material, 7-bromoindole once obtained, can be further derivatized suitably. These can be later treated with generally available mono-/di-substituted arylsulfonylchlorides. Thus, the library size and diversity increased significantly fulfilling our main objective.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention:<br>
The present invention provides a process for the preparation of substituted benzothiazinoindoles of general formula (I), which comprises of cyclizing the starting material i.e. compound of general formula (II) (i.e. substituted l-benzenesulfonyl-7-bromo-lH-indole) suitable catalyst and solvents.<br><br><br>
Formula (II)	Formula (I)<br>
Scheme -1 (Inventive step)<br>
Preferably the suitable catalyst includes a palladium (0) or (II) catalyst complex in presence of appropriate base dissolved/suspended in suitable solvent at suitable temperature range under inert atmosphere/ degassed conditions.<br>
The preferred substitutions for Rl5 R2, R3and R4for the compounds of formula (I) and (II) are defined as follows: Ri, R2 and R4 each independently could be hydrogen, chloro, fluoro, amino, nitro, cyano, CHO, (CrC3)alkyl, perhalo(Ci-C3)alkyl, (Ci-C3)alkoxy, aryl, aralkyl, aralkoxy, (C5-C7)heterocyclyl, (C5-C7)heterocyclylalkyl, (C5-C7)heterocyclyloxy, acyl, acetyl, alkylamino, aminoalkyl, amide, hydroxyalkyl, carboxylic acid and its derivatives. R3 independently could be hydrogen, (Ci-C3)alkyl, aryl and carboxylic acid and its derivatives.<br>
Suitable catalyst can be any one of those known in the literature which are useful in carrying out ring annulation. Preferred catalyst would include such catalyst which contains Palladium metal in a suitable valency state. More preferable catalyst would be palladium in either (0) or (II) valency state in the form of catalyst complex which may have a ligaml'base. It is known that the intramolecular cyclization is carried out by the Pd (0). Thus, the suitable catalyst system preferably can include a Pd compound coupled with a carrier and a base (in some cases), which may give an activated Pd (0) in-situ which is stable enough for the reaction to proceed in forward direction. Some examples of such Pd complexes described in literature, are listed below:<br>
1.	Pd (II) compounds along with ligand such as phosphines, phosphites, heterocyclic carbene ligands, Li as reported in reference [6]. Pd (II) compounds such as Pd(OAc)2, PdCl2, Pd(0)(PPh3)4, PdCl2(PPh3)2, Pd2(dba)3_CHCl3, (ri3-allyl-PdCl)2 or Pd on carbon without phosphine ligand. Pd(OAc)2 and Pd(Cl)2are used as precursors of Pd(0) catalysts with or without addition of reducing agents such as phosphine ligands. For example, tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium, Bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) dichloride and (Bis-tri-o-tolylphosphine) palladium. The reference [6] is incorporated herein.<br>
2.	Colloidal Pd particles protected with tetraalkylammonium salts,<br>
3.	polymer supported active Pd catalyst and<br>
4.	Pd on carbon without phosphine.<br>
Both types of Pd compounds namely Pd(0) complexes and Pd (II) salts can be used. It is well established in the literature that catalytic activities of Pd(0) generated in-situ from these Pd compounds are not always the same, and it is advisable to test all of them in order to achieve efficient catalytic reactions.<br><br>
The ratios of Pd catalyst to ligands are important. It is known that the presence of an excess of ligand leads to decrease in the concentration of active catalyst species thereby inhibiting the catalytic process. Some Pd-catalyzed reactions proceed without phosphine ligands, and a phosphine free catalyst is an ideal one, because phosphines are expensive, difficult to recover and coordinated phosphines as such do not directly participate in the catalytic reaction. Pd being an expensive metal, optimization of its use via recycling is essential.<br>
A suitable base selected should atleast be able to activate the Pd catalyst complex and may serve some secondary role. Such suitable bases includes CH3COOK, TEA and the like. Preferably these bases should be used in 1 - 5 mole equivalents based on the compound of formula (II), reaction solvent and reaction temperature.<br>
Suitable solvents for the reaction should preferably be inert to reaction conditions, non-toxic and have a high-boiling point. Some examples of suitable solvents are polar aprotic solvents exemplified by dimethyl formamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylacetamide (DMA) and the like. Generally the solvent having boiling point above 80 °C are preferred; examples include dimethylacetamide, dimethylformamide and the like. The amount of suitable used is about 5-20 volume/volume.<br>
The inert atmosphere may be maintained by using inert gases such as N2, Ar or He. Further if needed reaction mixture may be degassed.<br>
The reaction temperature may range from 0 °C to 200 °C based on the choice of solvent and preferably at a temperature of 80 °C 140 °C.<br><br>
