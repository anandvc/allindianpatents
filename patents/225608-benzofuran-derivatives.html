The present invention relates to novel benzofuran derivatives potently binding to Ae 5-HT,A rec^tor, pharmaceutical compositions containing tiiese compounds and tiie use thereof for the treatment of certain psychiatric and neurological disorders. Many of flie compounds of the invention are also potent serotonin reuptake inhibitors and are considered to be particnilarly useful for the treatment of depression.<br>
Bacbground Art<br>
Clinical studies of known S-HT,A partial agonists such as e.g. buspirone, ips^inme and gepirone have shown that S-HT,^ partial agonists are useful in the treatment of anxiety disoiders such as generalised anxiety disorder, panic disor^r, and obsessive compulsive disorder (Glitz, D. A., Pohl, R., Drugs 1991,41,1 l).^Preclimcal studies indicate that full agonists also are useful in the treatment of the above mcntifmed anxiety related disorders (ScAappet, Human PsychophantL, 1991, (5, S53),<br>
There is also evidence, both clinical and preclinical, in support of a beneficial e£fect of 5-HT,A partial agonists in the treatment of depression as well as inqiulse control disorders and alcohol abuse (van Hest, Psychopharm., 1992, 707,474; Schipper et al. Human Psychopharm., 1991, (5, S53; Cervo et al, Eur. J. Pharm,, 1988,158, 53; Oitz. D. A., Pohl» R., Drugs 1991,41, U; Grof et al., InL Oin. Psychopharmacol 1993, 8,167-172; Ansseau et al.. Human Psychopharmacol 1993. S, 279-283).<br>
S-HT,A ^onists and partial ^onists inhibit isolation-induced aggression in male mice indicating, that these compounds are useful in the treatment of aggression (Sancfate et al, Psychopharmacology, 1993,110, 53-59).<br>
Furthermore, S-Err,^ agonists have berai reported to show activity in animal models predictive for antipsychotic effects (Wadenberg and Ahlouus, J. Neural. Transm., 1991, S3,43; Ahlenius, P/iflrraaco/. &amp;ToxicoL, 1989, 54,3; Lowe etaL, J. Mat Chem., 1991, 34, 1S60; New et al., J. Med. Chem., 1989, 32, 1 ] 47; and Martin et al., J. Med. Chem.,<br><br>
19S9,32,1052) and may therefore be useful in the treatment of psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. Recent studies also indicate that 5-HTIA receptors are in^Kntant in the serotonergic modulation of haioperidol-induced catalepsy (Ificks, Life Science 1990,47, 1609) suggesting that S-HTi^ agonists are useful in the treatment of the side rfFects induced by conventional antipsychotic agents such as e.g. haloperidol.<br>
5-HT,A agonists have shown neuroprotective properties in rodent models of focal and global cerebral ischaemia and may, therefore, be useful in the treatment of ischaemic disease states (Prehn, Eur. J. Pharm. 1991,203,213).<br>
Phannacologicai studies have been presented which indicate that 5-HT,A antagonists are useful in the treatmait of senile dementia (Bowen et al.. Trends Neur. Sci. 1992,15, 84).<br>
An overview of 5-HT,A antagonists and proposed potential ther^Kutic targets for these antagonists based i^on preclinical and clinical data are presented by Schechter et al.. Serotonin, 1997, Vol.2, Issue 7. It is stated that 5-HTIA antagonists may be useful in the treatment of schizophrenia, dementia associated vntii Alzheimer's disease, and in combination with SSRI antidq)ressants also to be useful in the treatment of (tepression.<br>
Both in animal models and in cUnical trials it has been shown that 5-HT,A agonists exert antihypertensive effects via a central mechanism (Saxena and Villalon, Trends Pharm. Set. 1990,1 J, 95; Gillis et al,J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 1989,248, 851). 5-HT,^ ligands may, therefore, be beaeficial in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders.<br>
5-HT reuptake inhibitors are well known antidepressant drugs and useful for Ibe treatment of panic disorders and social phobia.<br>
The effect of combined administration of a compound that inhibits serotonin rei^take and a 5-HT, A receptor antagonist has been evaluated in several studies (Innis, K-B. et al.^ Eur. J. Pharmacol, 1987,143. p 195-204 and Gartside, S.E., Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995,115. p 1064-1070, Biier, P. et al. Trends Pharmacol Sci. 1994,15, 220). In tiiese stiKiies it was found that 5&gt;HT,A receptor antagonists would abolish the initial brake on 5-HT<br><br>
I<br>
neurotransmission induced by the serotonin reuptake inhibitors and thus produce an immediate boost of 5-HT transmission and a more rapid onset of therapeutic action.<br>
Several patent applications have been filed which cover the use of a combination of a 5-HT,A antagonist and a serotonin reuptake inhibitor for the treatment of depression (see EP-A2-687 472 and EP-A2-714 663).<br>
Accordingly, agents acting on the 5-HT,A receptor, both agonists and ant^onists, are believed to be of potential use in the therapy of psychiatric and neurological disorders and thus being highly desired. Furthermore, antagonists at the same time having potent serotonin reuptake inhibition activity may be useful for the treatment of depression.<br>
Sommary of the Invention<br>
It has now been found that compounds of a certain class of benzofiiran derivatives bind to the 5-HT,A receptor with high affinities. Furthermore, it has been found that many of these compoimds have potent serotonin reuptake inhibition activity.<br><br><br>

Exemplary of inorganic acid addition salts according to the invention are those with hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, and nitric acids. The acid addition salts of the invention are preferably pharmaceutically acceptable salts fonned with non-toxic acids.<br><br>
Furthermore, the compounds of ttiis invention may exist in unsolvated as well as in solvatMi forms with pbarmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol and the like. In general, the solvated forms are considered equivalent to the unsolvated forms for the purposes of ttiis invention.<br>
Some of the compounds of the present invention contain chiral centres and such compounds exist in the form of isomers (e.g. enantiomKs). The invention includes all such isomCTS and any mixtures thereof including racemic mixtures.<br>
Racemic forms can be resolved into the optical antipodes by known methods, for example, by separation of diastereomeric salts thereof with an optically active acid, and liberating the optically active amine compound by treatment with a base. Another metiiod for resolving racemates into the optical antipodes is based i^on chromatogr^hy on an optically active matrix. Racemic compotmds of the present invention can thus be resolved into their optical antipodes, e.g., by fractional ciystallisatirai of d- or 1- (tartrates, mandelates, or camphotsulphonate) salts for example. The compounds of the present invention may also be resolved by the formation of diastereomeric derivatives.<br>
Additional methods for the resolution of optical isomers, known to tbi^e skilled in the art, may be used. Such methods include tiwse discussed by J. Jaques, A. Collet, and S. Wilen in "Enantiomors, Racemates, and Resolutions", John Wiley and Sons, New Yodc (1981).<br>

Melting points were detennined on a BQcfai SMP-20 ^^aratus and are uncoiTected. Mass spectra were obtained on a Quattro MS-MS system &amp;om VG Biotedi, Fisons Instruments. The MS-MS system was coimected to an HP 1050 moAiIar HPLC syston. A volume of 20-50 ^1 of the sample (10 ttg/ral) dissolved in a mixture of 1% ac^c acid in acetonitrilAvatCT 1:1 was introduced via the autosampler at a flow of 30 ^1/min into the Electrospray Source. Spectra were obtained at two standard set&amp; of opoating conditions. Analytical LC-MS data were obtained on a PE Sciex API 150EX instrument equipped with lonSpray source and Shimadzu LC-8A/SLC-10A LC system. The LC conditions (50 X 4.6<br><br>
mm YMC ODS-A with 5 fim particle size) were linear gradient elution with water/acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid (90:10:0.05) to water/acetonitrile/trifiuoroacetic acid (10:90:0.03) in 7 min at 2 mL/min. Purity was determined by integration of the UV trace (254 nm). The retention times R, are expressed in minutes.<br>
One set to obtain molecular weight information (MH+) (21 eV) and the other set to induce fiagmentation patterns (70 eV). The backgroimd was subtracted.
