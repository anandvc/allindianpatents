A METHOD OF TRANSMITTING BROADCAST MESSAGE IN A MOBILE<br>
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method of transmitting a broadcast message,<br>
and more particularly, to a method of transmitting a broadcast message in a mobile<br>
communication system.<br>
Background Art<br>
A broadcast message uses a data burst message to transmit data to all or<br>
specific groups of mobile stations. At the same time, the mobile stations are in a<br>
specified mode when receiving the broadcast message.<br>
If the broadcast message is transmitted via a Forward Common Control<br>
Channel (F-CCCH) and a Secondary Broadcast Control Channel (S-BCCH), control<br>
information of the broadcast message to be transmitted in sent via the F-CCCH. For<br>
example, the control information includes information related to whether the broadcast<br>
message has been transmitted, and Enhanced Broadcast Page information which<br>
indicates the location of the broadcast message transmitted on the S-BCCH.<br>
According to the conventional method, the aforementioned broadcast message<br>
is transmitted via the S-BCCH. More specifically, the broadcast message is not<br>
transmitted via a Primary Broadcast Control Channel (P-BCCH), which is used to<br><br>
WO 2006/093379	2	PCT/KR2006/000503<br>
transmit an overhead message only, nor via the F-CCCH. However, the Enhanced<br>
Broadcast Page information can be transmitted using a Multi-slot Enhance Broadcast<br>
Paging scheme or a Periodic Enhanced Broadcast Paging scheme.<br>
Figure 1 is an example showing the Multi-slot Enhanced Broadcast Paging<br>
scheme. In detail, the Multi-slot Enhanced Broadcast Paging scheme is a scheme<br>
which transmits the Enhanced Broadcast Page information during F-CCCH slots so<br>
that all the mobile stations can receive the broadcast signal. Here, all the mobile<br>
stations are in the slotted mode to receive the broadcast signal. As illustrated in Figure<br>
1, if a Maximum Paging Cycle period of the F-CCCH is 16 slots, the Enhanced<br>
Broadcast Page information can be continuously transmitted in the 16 slots.<br>
Furthermore, the Enhanced Broadcast Page information can be received by all the<br>
mobile stations receiving different slots on the F-CCCH.<br>
Figure 2 is an example illustrating a Periodic Enhanced Broadcast Paging<br>
scheme where a BCASTJNDEX is 1. In Figure 2, information on whether the<br>
Periodic Enhanced Broadcast Paging scheme is being used can be determined by the<br>
BCAST_INDEX of a MC-RR Parameters Message. For example, the value of the<br>
BCASTJNDEX represent by '000' indicates that the Periodic Enhanced Broadcast<br>
Paging scheme is not used. On the other hand, if the value of the BCASTJNDEX is<br>
not '000,' then the Periodic Enhanced Broadcast Paging scheme having (B+7)<br>
broadcast paging cycle period is being used. Here, the value of 'B' can be determined<br>
according to Equation 1.<br><br>
WO 2006/093379	3	PCT/KR2006/000503<br>
[Equation 1]<br>
B = 21+1x l6 1≤ i ≤ 7<br>
In Equation 1, i represents a value of the BCAST_INDEX transmitted via the<br>
MC-RR parameter message.<br>
In Figure 2, the value of the BCAST_INDEX is '1' and when applied to<br>
Equation 1, the value of B is 64 and the broadcast paging cycle is 71. The Enhanced<br>
Broadcast Page information is transmitted via a first F-CCCH slot of the broadcast<br>
paging cycle, and the Enhanced Broadcast Page information includes BCCHJNDEX<br>
and TIME_OFFSET. Consequently, transmission locations of the SBCCH and the<br>
broadcast message can be identified by the Enhanced Broadcast Page information.<br>
A plurality of BCCH is classified into Broadcast Control Channel Number<br>
(BCN). In detail, the BCN value of the P-BCCH is 1, and the BCN value of the S-<br>
BCCH can be any number between 2-8. The broadcast message is transmitted via the<br>
S-BCCH after 40x(l+TIME_OFFSET)ms with respect to the transmission point of the<br>
Enhanced Broadcast Page information. Here, the BCN value of the S-BCCH is<br>
BCCH_INDEX+1.<br>
As described above, in order to transmit a broadcast message, Enhanced<br>
Broadcast Page information, which provides information on whether the broadcast<br>
message is to be transmitted and the transmission location of the broadcast message,<br>
has to be first transmitted via the F-CCCH. Thereafter, the actual broadcast message is<br><br>
WO 2006/093379	4	PCT/KR2006/000503<br>
transmitted via the S-BCCH. However, the problem with this transmission scheme is<br>
that the actual broadcast message cannot be transmitted via the F-CCCH.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a method of transmitting<br>
broadcast message in a mobile communication system that substantially obviates one<br>
or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method of transmitting a<br>
broadcast message using a Forward Common Control Channel (F-CCCH) in a wireless<br>
communication system where a plurality of broadcast messages are transmitted via a<br>
first slot of a broadcast paging cycle.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of transmitting a<br>
broadcast message using a Forward Common Control Channel (F-CCCH) in a wireless<br>
communication system where a single broadcast message is transmitted via at least one<br>
slot of a broadcast paging cycle.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a method of transmitting<br>
a broadcast message using a Forward Common Control Channel (F-CCCH) in a<br>
wireless communication system where at least one broadcast message included in each<br>
slot of the maximum paging cycle is transmitted.<br>
Additional advantages, objects, and features of the invention will be set forth in<br>
part in the description which follows and in part will become apparent to those having<br><br>
WO 2006/093379	5	PCT/KR2006/000503<br>
ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned from<br>
practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention may be<br>
realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description<br>
and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.<br>
To achieve these objects and other advantages and in accordance with the<br>
purpose of the invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, a method of<br>
transmitting a broadcast message using a Forward Common Control Channel (F-<br>
CCCH) in a wireless communication system includes a base station which determines<br>
whether a periodic enhanced broadcast page is enabled or disabled, and then transmits<br>
at least one broadcast message via a first slot of a broadcast paging cycle of the F-<br>
CCCH if determined that the periodic enhanced broadcast page is enabled.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, a base station determines whether a<br>
periodic enhanced broadcast paging is enabled or disabled, and then transmits a single<br>
broadcast message via at least one slot of a broadcast paging cycle of the F-CCCH if<br>
determined that the periodic enhanced broadcast paging is enabled.<br>
Yet, in another aspect of the present invention, a base station first determines<br>
whether a periodic enhanced broadcast paging is enabled or disabled. Thereafter, the<br>
base station transmits at least one broadcast paging message via at least one slot of a<br>
broadcast paging cycle of the F-CCCH if determined that the periodic enhanced<br>
broadcast paging is enabled, and also transmits at least one broadcast messagein a<br>
subsequent broadcast slot according to an order of the broadcast paging message.<br><br>
WO 2006/093379	6	PCT/KR2006/000503<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, a base station transmits a maximum<br>
slot cycle index for providing the broadcast message to a mobile station and receives<br>
the maximum slot cycle index and determining a maximum paging cycle. Thereafter,<br>
the base station transmits at least one broadcast message included in each slot of the<br>
maximum paging cycle of the F-CCCH, and then receives the at least one broadcast<br>
message in a specified slot of the maximum paging cycle.<br>
It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the<br>
following detailed description of the present invention are exemplary and explanatory<br>
and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings<br>
to refer to the same or like parts.<br>
A mobile station (MS) has a right to know whether the S-BCCH, which is used<br>
for transmitting a broadcast message, is supported. The MS can determine whether the<br>
S-BCCH is supported or not based on the value of the NUM_BCCH__BCAST included<br>
in the MC-RR parameter message. For example, if the NUM_BCCH_BCAST value is<br>
'000,' the MS can determine that the S-BCCH is not supported, while if the<br>
NUM_BCCH_BCAST value is not '000,' then not only can the MS can determine that<br>
the S-BCCH is supported, but the number of the S-BCCH supported can also be<br>
determined since the S-BCCH supported number equals the value of the<br>
NUM_BCCH_BCAST.<br><br>
WO 2006/093379	8	PCT/KR2006/000503<br>
The present invention can be applied to cases where the NUM_BCCH_BCAST<br>
value is '000' and as a result, does not support the S-BCCH for transmitting a<br>
broadcast message. In situations where the S-BCCH is unsupported, two transmission<br>
schemes can be used, namely, a Multi-slot Broadcast Message transmission scheme,<br>
and a Periodic Enhanced Broadcast Paging transmission scheme.<br>
Figure 3 is an example illustrating the Multi-slot Broadcast Message<br>
transmission scheme when a maximum paging cycle is 16 slots. As illustrated in<br>
Figure 3, the Multi-slot Enhanced Broadcast Paging scheme is a scheme which<br>
transmits the Enhanced Broadcast Page information in the slots on the F-CCCH so that<br>
all the mobile stations can receive the broadcast signal. Here, all the mobile stations are<br>
in the slotted mode to receive the broadcast signal. Furthermore, the Multi-slot<br>
Enhanced Broadcast Paging scheme can be applied to cases where the broadcast<br>
message is transmitted via a single slot on the F-CCCH.<br>
If a base station (BS) continuously transmits the broadcast message in 16 slots<br>
on the F-CCCH, each MS can successfully receive the broadcast message even if each<br>
MS in a cell receives the broadcast message via different slots on the F-CCCH.<br>
Figure 4 is an example illustrating a Periodic Enhance Broadcast Paging<br>
transmission scheme according to a first embodiment of the present invention. In<br>
Figure 4, a value of the BCAST_INDEX, transmitted via a MC-RR parameter message,<br>
is '1,' and three (3) broadcast messages are transmitted through a single slot. If<br>
plurality of broadcast messages is transmitted via a single slot, the broadcast message<br><br>
WO 2006/093379	9	PCT/KR2006/000503<br>
can be transmitted during the first slot of the Broadcast Page Cycle. In addition, in the<br>
present embodiment, it is unnecessary to transmit Enhanced Broadcast Page<br>
information or put differently, information pertaining to the slot used to transmit the<br>
broadcast message on the F-CCCH.<br>
Figure 5 is an example illustrating a Periodic Enhanced Broadcast Paging<br>
transmission scheme according to a second embodiment of the present invention. In<br>
Figure 5, a value of the BCAST_INDEX, transmitted via a MC-RR parameter message,<br>
is '1' and the length of a broadcast message occupies three (3) slots. As illustrated in<br>
Figure 5, if there is only one broadcast message to be transmitted and the broadcast<br>
message has to be transmitted using three slots, the broadcast message can be<br>
transmitted using three consecutive slots, starting with a first slot. In this embodiment,<br>
as is the case with the first embodiment, it is unnecessary to transmit Enhanced<br>
Broadcast Page information.<br>
Figure 6 is an example illustrating a Periodic Enhanced Broadcast Paging<br>
transmission scheme according to a third embodiment of the present invention. In<br>
Figure 6, a value of the BCAST_INDEX, transmitted via a MC-RR parameter message,<br>
is '1,' and there are three broadcast messages to be transmitted. In the present<br>
embodiment, there is at least one broadcast message to be transmitted, and the length<br>
of each broadcast message exceeds permitted length for each slot. As illustrated in<br>
Figure 6, in the first slot of the Broadcast Page Cycle, Enhanced Broadcast page<br>
information which provides whether the broadcast message is transmitted as well as<br><br>
WO 2006/093379	10	PCT/KR2006/000503<br>
the location of the broadcast message on the F-CCCH is transmitted. Furthermore, the<br>
broadcast message corresponding to each Enhanced Broadcast Page should be<br>
transmitted after 'n' number of slots. That is, a first broadcast message corresponding<br>
to a first Enhanced Broadcast Page is transmitted after 'n' slots, a second broadcast<br>
message corresponding to a second Enhanced Broadcast Page is transmitted after '2n'<br>
slots, a third broadcast message corresponding to a third Enhanced Broadcast Page is<br>
transmitted after '3n' slots, and k-th broadcast message corresponding to k-th<br>
Enhanced Broadcast Page is transmitted after 'k x n' slots.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates an example where n = 7. In Figure 6, since there are three<br>
broadcast messages to be transmitted and n = 7, the first broadcast message<br>
corresponding to the first Enhanced Broadcast Page is transmitted after 7 slots, the<br>
second broadcast message corresponding to the first Enhanced Broadcast Page is<br>
transmitted after 14 slots, the third broadcast message corresponding to the third<br>
Enhanced Broadcast Page is transmitted after 21 slots, and so forth.<br>
The Enhanced Broadcast Page information can be transmitted via a General<br>
Page Message (GPM) or an Universal Page Message (UPM). The following Table 1 is<br>
an example of a GPM format according to the present invention.<br>

As shown in Tables 1 and 2, when the value of NUM_BCCH_BCAST is not<br>
'000,' the S-BCCH exists to transmit the broadcast message, and therefore,<br>
information associated with received via the S-BCCH is transmitted. On the contrary,<br>
if the value of NUM_BCCH_BCAST is '000,' there is no S-BCCH by which to<br>
transmit the broadcast message. As such, the broadcast message is transmitted via the<br>
B-CCCH, and it is unnecessary to transmit information pertaining to the broadcast<br>
information.<br>

A field corresponding to 'PDU Format for an enhanced broadcast page' in<br>
Table 3 can include different information depending on whether the S-BCCH is '<br>
supported. In other words, different information can be included depending on whether<br>
the value of NUM_BCCH_BCAST is '000' or not For example, if the value of<br>
NUM_BCCH_BCAST is not '000,' the BS sets the value of the field corresponding to<br>
'PDU Format for an enhanced broadcast page' to a valid value depending on the<br>
transmission format of the broadcast message. At the same time, the MS uses the valid<br>
value transmitted from the BS to receive the broadcast message.<br>
Alternatively, if the value of NUM_BCCH_BCAST is '000,' the BS can set the<br>
value of the field corresponding to 'PDU Format for an enhanced broadcast page' as an<br>
unused value or an insignificant default value. In such a case, the MS determines that<br>
the value of the field is an invalid value and therefore does not use the value to receive<br>
the broadcast message.<br><br>
WO 2006/093379	15	PCT/KR2006/000503<br>
For example, if NUM_BCCH_BCAST value is '000,' the BS can set the value<br>
of the BCCH_INDEX as currently unused value. At the same time, the BS can set the<br>
value o TIME_OFFSET to be an insignificant value such as '0000000000.' In addition,<br>
the value of ihe REPEAT_TIME_OFFSET and the value of ADD_BCAST_SDU<br>
_LENGTH can be excluded by setting the value of<br>
EXT_BCAST_SDU_LENGTH_IND to '00.'<br>

the value of NUM_BCCH_BCAST is '000' or not. For example, if the value of<br>
NUM_BCCH_BCAST is not '000/ the BS sets the value of the field corresponding to<br>
'PDU Format for an enhanced broadcast page' to a valid value depending on the<br>
transmission format of the broadcast message. At the same time, the MS uses the valid<br>
value transmitted from the BS to receive the broadcast message.<br>
Alternatively, if the value of NUM_BCCH_BCAST is '000,' the BS can set the<br>
value of the field corresponding to 'PDU Format for an enhanced broadcast page' as an<br>
unused value or an insignificant default value. In such a case, the MS determines that<br>
the value of the field is an invalid value and therefore does not use the value to receive<br>
the broadcast message.<br>
For example, if NUM_BCCH_BCAST value is '000,' the BS can set the value<br>
of the BCCH_INDEX as currently unused value. At the same time, the BS can set the<br>
value o TIME_OFFSET to be an insignificant value such as '0000000000.' In addition,<br>
the value of the REPEAT_TIME_OFFSET and the value of ADD_BCAST_SDU<br><br>
WO 2006/093379	17	PCT/KR2006/000503<br>
_LENGTH can be excluded by setting the value of<br>
EXT_BCAST_SDU_LENGTHJND to '00.'<br>
With respect to the enhanced broadcast page scheme, if the same broadcast<br>
message or the same enhanced broadcast page information is to be re-transmitted, the<br>
initially transmitted broadcast message or the enhanced broadcast page information<br>
should be re-transmitted after a specified time period from the initially transmitted time.<br>
For example, the re-transmission should take place within (4 x (B+7)) slots of the<br>
initial transmission.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and<br>
variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or<br>
scope of the inventions. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers the<br>
modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of<br>
the appended claims and their equivalents.<br><br>
