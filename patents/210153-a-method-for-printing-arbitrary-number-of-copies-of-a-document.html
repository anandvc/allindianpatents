FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates in general to printing technology and in particular relates to a method which enables the user to select preferences in a print job at page level, including number of copies to be printed, through friendly user interface. More particularly, this invention relates to a method of printing arbitrary number of copies of arbitrarily selected individual pages of a document in a single print-job request.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
In US Patent 6,687,019 titled "a device and method of printing data in multiple copies" has been described. In the said patent, a fixed number of print copies as desired are set and the data is converted to a predetermined format suitable for printing. The converted data is stored in a storage unit when the copy mode is the collated copy mode or directly printed when the copy mode is the uncollated copy mode.<br>
In another US Patent 6,707,574 titled "a method of providing print job attributes for later access before printing the job" includes collecting and storing print job attributes of the print job in a manner that makes them accessible for viewing. The attributes may later be viewed in response to a user query of a stored print job. From the attributes, a user can determine when and whether the stored print job should be printed. The collected attributes may also be used to determine the order of printing jobs stored in a print queue.<br>
The print job data is converted to a format suitable for printing and stored in a data storage unit. All the attributes for the print job is also stored in the storage. This is done so that the document need not be sent repeatedly for printing if a document needs to be printed more than once.<br>
The solution provided for customization of preferences in the print job is not<br><br>
generic, in the sense that the preferences in the print job cannot be selected through single user friendly interface.<br>
The existing art would require additional hardware support for the implementation.<br>
The existing methods/ solutions cannot be easily integrated with the existing setup.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Before describing the various aspects and details of the present invention it will be useful to describe the context in which the invention is used. Consequently, a preliminary discussion that refers to Figures is hereby provided.<br>
First let us see how the invention in the prior art works. Figure 1, shows a block diagram of a pnnting device to print the data in multiple copies according to the Prior art a data register unit (200) sets an environment to print the data made in the computer. That is, the data register unit stores information pertaining to various print parameters set by a user for printing a document. Such print parameters including, but not limited to, a collated or uncollated copy mode and number of copies to be printed. A data storage unit (300) stores the print data generated in the computer, and the data is converted at a data conversion unit (500) to be suitable for printing. A data print unit (400) prints the data stored in the data storage unit (300) according to the environment determined at the data register unit (200). The data conversion unit (500) converts the data made in the computer to a data suitable for printing at the data print unit (400). After the data made in the computer is converted to a suitable form for printing at the data<br><br>
'conversion unit (500), a data control unit (100) generates a control signal to store the data made in the computer at the data storage unit (300) and also generates a control signal to print the data at the data output unit (400) which is stored in the data storage unit (300).<br>
The Prior art invention now will be described hereinafter with reference to FIG. 2 and 3, in which the printing device for printing the data in multiple copies and the method of using the device to print the data in multiple copies will be described in more detail.<br>
First of all, it is determined whether the data at the data print unit (400), which is made in computer, should be printed (S100). That is, as shown in FIG. 3, the decision is made by checking the data register unit (200) of the computer, to determine whether a print control program to perform a print command has been executed. Then, it is determined whether the mode to print the created data has been set to a collated copy mode (S210). As shown in FIG. 3, it is possible to check the collated copy mode setting by reviewing whether collated copy (210) has been selected. When the collated copy mode is set, a number of print copies (230), shown in FIG. 2, is set according to the quantity desired to print the created data (S220). After setting the number of copies, it is determined whether the command to print the data has been executed (S310). It is possible to execute the print command by activating a print command button (220) shown in FIG. 2. When the print command button (220) is activated a print command is input to the printer and the data conversion unit (500) converts the data from the computer to a printable data suitable for printing at the data print unit (400) (S320). The printable form of data for printing is the print image made of the PCL (Printer Control Language) in order to convert to the data printable at the data print unit (400). The converted data is stored in the data storage unit (300) (S330). That is, a data storage device of the computer called a hard disk drive is used as the storage device.<br><br>
The reason for storing the converted data in the hard disk is described herein below.<br>
Conventionally when printing the data in the collated copy mode, the number of print images of each page of a document created was identical to the number of print copies desired. That is, if multiple copies are set to three, for example, then in order to print the data of one page, three separate print images were created to print the data. The prior art invention, however, stores the print image on the hard disk when printing multiple copies of data, then the print image stored on the hard disk is referenced for the purpose of printing multiple copies without the need to create additional print images again. After the storage, the stored data is output and printed at the data print unit (400) in the collated copy mode (S400). After printing, it is then determined whether the selected number of copies have been printed (S500). If the selected number of copies has not been printed, the process returns to step S400 to print the next copy. If the selected number of copies have been printed the print operation ends.<br>
On the other hand, when it is determined in step S210 that the collated copy mode is not set, then, in step S601, it is determined whether or not the uncollated copy mode is set. If not, the print process ends. When the uncollated copy is set the number of print copies is set to the number of copies desired (S620). Then, in step S630, the printer determines whether a print command is received. Once the print command is received, the printer receives the data from the computer and, in step S640, converts the data to a print image in a format (PCL) suitable for printing at the data print unit (400). The print image is then printed in the uncollated copy mode (S650) according to the number of copies set in step S620.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates the screen shot of the present invention where the user can choose the page range and number of copies. Also he can choose whether the printing should be collated.<br><br>
figure 5 illustrates the screen shot of the present invention where the user can choose the page range and number of copies. Additionally a screen area is displayed where the pages are individually displayed whereby the user is given a user friendly interface to select the pages. This figure depicts one of the solutions for the invention. User can set the number of copies for each page in the document by selecting each page in the document and setting the option.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates the screen shot of the present invention where the user can choose the page range and number of copies. Additionally the number of copies of each of the pages can be entered in braces. This figure depicts one of the solutions for the invention. User can set the number of copies for any arbitrary page or range of pages by entering the page number and the copies of the same.<br>
Figure 7 gives a flow chart of the present implementation. First the printing command is enabled The page to be printed is selected in the user interface. Using the user interface printing preferences like layout or number of copies can be changed. Then check is done for confirming the changes done. If the changes are successfully done print job is send to the printer device. If not again the pages are selected and the cycle is repeated.<br>
In the current setup, users cannot customize printing of a number of different pages in a single print job. Users must enter their requirements for each page separately before printing. This task is repetitive and time consuming.<br>
The current invention provides an easy to use user interface using which the user can easily set preferences for each page before sending the document to printer in a single print job.<br>
The method claimed in the invention speaks of a generic method for printing arbitrary pages in a document that can be incorporated in software and hence can be easily incorporated in any existing setup with the addition of software modules.<br><br>
Since no additional hardware is required to support this invention, the solution is cost effective.<br>
&gt;	The existing solution is shown in Figure 3.<br>
The pages to be printed by the user in the specified ranges can be printed immediately or subsequently depending on the selection of 'uncollated' mode or the 'collated mode'.<br>
&gt;	The new solution #1 is given in Figure 5.<br>
When user wants to print a document the user interface as shown in figure 5 will be displayed. User will be given an option to select the page in the document and set the number of copies for each page, by default the number of copies will always be one. In case, for a page, the page number is mentioned in the page range column and the number of copies is not mentioned in "copies" column then the default value of one will be taken. For other pages the number of copies mentioned in brackets will be taken into account, as the default value is not applicable in these cases. When the user wants to print, the print job will be created based on the user preferences and spooled before being sent to the printing device.<br>
The page(s) that are not required to be printed in the current print job are set as gray shade. All the remaining pages will be printed in the current print job as selected by the user.<br>
&gt;	The new solution #2 is given in Figure 6.<br>
In this method user will be able to specify the number of copies for each page or a range of pages before creating the print job which will be spooled before being sent to the printing device.<br><br>
The user selects pages to be printed in the specified ranges including the number of copies required in the individual range. It can be noted that the solution enables the user to specify all the above said preferences for the print job<br>
Including arbitrary number of selected copies of arbitrary number of selected pages through single user friendly interface.<br>
As per the method proposed in the invention, in order to set the preferences for printing the required number of copies of the selected page(s) in the current print job, the user selects options provided in the user friendly interface as explained below;<br>
1.	Solution 1: This solution enables the user to select not only the pages and the copies to be printed but also the page(s) that will not be printed in the current print job. Refer to Figure 5.<br>
2.	Solution 2: This solution enables the user to specify the pages to be printed in ranges as well as the number of copies required in braces as shown in Figure 6.<br>
It is to be noted that the user is able to specify his preferences at page level and obtain print job of arbitrary number of selected copies of arbitrary number of selected pages.<br>
