The present inventors have conducted intensive studies in an attempt to solve the above-mentioned problems, and found that a ring opening of a mesoepoxide compound, using chiral or achiral amine and a mixed catalyst of a proton donor and a Lewis acid under mild temperature conditions leads to stereoselective production of an optically active amino alcohol compound, an enantiomer thereof and a salt thereof at high yields. In addition, they have found<br><br>
that the use of a chiral proton donor enables production of an amino alcohol at sufficient asymmetric yields by ring opening of an epoxy compound using achiral amine.   They have also found that an important intermediate compound [5] and an enantiomer thereof to be mentioned later can be produced stereoselectively and highly efficiently in large amounts as crystalline salts having high purity by isomerizing the 7-membered moiety of said amino alcohol to a 5-membered structure and then removing the substituent(s) R4 and/or R5 on the nitrogen atom, which resulted in the completion of the present invention.<br>
