LAP SUPPORTING DEVICE<br>
Technical field<br>
The invention relates to a textile carding machine and more particularly to a lap supporting device to support the lap that is fed to the textile carding machine as input material. Background Art<br>
In textile preparatory process, the use of carding machine for opening and pre parallelizing of the fibre is known. Carding is the most important and delicate process in which the fibres are distributed to form an even web, which in turn will form a sliver for subsequent processing in the down stream spinning process.<br>
The Carding machines are provided with feeding device comprising a feed roller and a feed plate cooperating therewith. The fibre material is fed to the feeding arrangement of the carding machine in the form of flocks or laps The fibre batt supplied to the carding machine is firmly held between the feed roller and the feed plate and due to the rotation of the feed roller the fibre batt is slowly advanced into the licker-in zone. The Carding machines are provided with a licker-in roller. The fibre batt is opened by the clothing of the licker in roller and the opened fibres are carried by the licker- in roller and delivered to the card cylinder, clothed with wire points for subsequent opening and so on. For the removal of waste and dirt from the opened batt, stationary-carding elements, also known as combing segment associated with mote knife and discharge opening is present in the carding machine.<br>
The licker in roller present immediately next to the feed roller rotates significantly faster than the feed roller and the fibres opened by the licker-in passes through the stationary carding element, mote knife and the discharge opening present in the licker-in under casing zone. The opened fibres carried by the licker-in roller is further opened by the stationary carding elements gently. The loose fibres carried by the licker- in roller is stripped by the mote knife and dropped in to the discharge opening, which may be collected in a chamber provided and removed by suitable suction means. The card cylinder subsequently carries the fibre material. The fibres carried by the cylinder in cooperation with revolving flats is fully opened and parallelized and the fibres are subsequently doffed by the doffer and detaching device comprising redirecting roller and crush rollers and present to the calendar rollers in<br><br>
sliver form, through a web doffing device, which is normally present in high production cards. The sliver delivered by the calendar rollers is transferred to the revolving sliver cans  through the coiler calendar rollers and can coiler.<br>
The carding machines in which the fibre material is supplied in the form of lap for subsequent processing comprises lap feeding arrangement provided with a lap roller also known as sand roller rotatably mounted on bearings and arranged on the frame member of the carding machine. Drive means are provided for the driving of the feed roller. The lap, which is being fed to the carding machine being kept on a lap stand, which is provided with means for supporting the lap over the lap roller. The drive provided to the lap roller provides rotational movement to the lap roller and the rotation of the lap rollers enables the unwinding of the lap by the frictional force. The free end of the lap is being fed, to the nip between the feed roller and the feed plate. The feed roller which is also mounted on antifriction bearings and rotatably mounted on the frame member of the carding machine and driven by the carding machine drive system. The feed roller and the lap roller being driven at a pre determined rotational speed there and the lap is continuously fed to the nip between the feed roller and the feed plate.<br>
It is observed in practice while processing certain raw materials, for example some synthetic material the outer most layers, which were loosely wound by the lap-producing machine. Because of this, the lap gets sagged behind the lap roller particularly during the unwinding of the outer most layers of the lap. Due to this sagging, the lap slips over the lap roller. This results in the unsynchronised rotation of the lap and the feed roller resulting in the breakage of the lap in the zone between the lap roller and the feed roller. The frequent stoppage of the machine due to the above reason affects the efficiency of the machine. Also the sagged layer of the lap gets folded and goes in to feed roller, which results in the variation in the mass of feed material, which affects the quality of the sliver produced by the carding machine. Objects of the invention:<br>
The primary object of the present invention is to provide a lap supporting device of a textile carding machine to prevent the sagging of the lap delivered by the lap roller of the carding machine.<br><br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a lap supporting device of a textile carding machine to prevent the sagging of the lap especially during the period of processing of full laps.<br>

The   invention  will   now  be  described  in  detail  with   reference  to  the accompanying diagrams Figures 1-3.<br>
The main lap roller 1 is constructed to the working width of the carding machine and mounted on an intermediate shaft la. The said main lap roller 1 is mounted on antifriction bearings and rotatably supported on the frame member 15. Frame member 15 is arranged on both sides of the machine and fitted to left and right main frames 2 of the<br><br>
carding machine. The main lap roller 1 is normally a sand roller and having a general diameter of about 162 mm.<br>
The feed plate 10 constructed to the working width of the carding machine and fitted to the left and right mainframes 2 of the carding machine in a known way.<br>
The feed roller 9 is constructed to the working width of the carding machine and rotatably supported on bearing housings and fitted to the feed plate 10 so as to form a nip between the feed roller 9 and the feed plate 10 to facilitate the transfer of the lap 8 to the licker in zone of the carding machine. A lap stand comprising lap supports 6 fitted to frame member 15 arranged on both sides of the machine and further fitted to the left hand side and right hand side main frames 2 of the carding machine. The said lap supports 6 further provided with passage opening 6a to allow the lap rod 7 and to retain the lap wound over the said lap rod 7 over the main lap roller 1.<br>
The lap guide roller 4 of the lap supporting device according to the present invention is constructed to the working width of the carding machine. The said lap guide roller 4 is disposed on a shaft 4a and is mounted on anti- friction bearings housed in the bearing housing 13. Bearing housing 13 is fitted on the bearing support 14. The bearing support 14 is further mounted on the frame member 15 arranged on the side of the carding machine, where the drive arrangement to the lap roller is situated. Lap guide roller 4 is normally fabricated of sheet metal and provided with anti-rust prevention surface coating. Alternatively, the lap guide roller, which is made from tubular metallic material with suitable end flanges can also be suitably used in the present invention. The diameter of the lap guide roller 4 is about 100 mm. It is to be noted here that the diameter is of the guide roller 4 is adopted depending upon the factors like the location of the lap guide roller with reference to the main lap roller as well as the diameter of the main lap roller. Lap guide roller 4 is disposed to support the lap 8 and arranged upstream of the main lap roller 1 at a pre-determined location.<br>
An intermediate drive arrangement is employed for the transmission of power from the feed motor of the feed roller drive system to the said main lap roller 1 in a known manner.<br>
Main lap roller 1 that is driven by the feed roller drive system provides required rotational movement to the lap 8 in synchronization with the rotational movement of<br><br>
the said feed roller 9 to facilitate proper transfer of the lap layer to the nip between the feed roller 9 and the feed plate 10,<br>
The drive arrangement of the lap guide roller 4 according to the invention is described which is as follows.<br>
Driver pulley 3 is mounted on intermediate shaft, which is driven by the feed roller drive system. The said intermediate shaft is drivingly connected to the shaft la of the main lap roller 1 by suitable transmission elements for example by gear wheels. A driven pulley 5 is mounted on one side of shaft 4a of the lap guide roller 4. The sense of rotation of the said main lap roller 1 and the said lap guide roller 4 are to be the same and directed towards the feed roller to facilitate the transfer of the lap layer. To facilitate the above requirement, the driver pulley 3 is drivingly connected to the said driven pulley 5 by cross belt 11 drive means. It is within the scope of this invention to adopt a suitable driving means from a gear drive, a drive by crossed flat belt or a drive by timing belt. Further, a lap guide sheet 12 is provided in the region between the main lap roller 1 and the feed roller 9 in a known way.<br>
Since the lap 8 is supported additionally by the said driven lap guide roller 4, sagging of the web is prevented. As a result the functioning of the carding machine is not interrupted, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the machine and producing sliver with improved quality.<br>
It is to be understood that only during the processing of newly loaded laps i.e. the full laps, few outer layers of the lap 8 is supported additionally by the said driven lap guide roller 4 to avoid the sagging of the web. Soon after the few outer layers of the lap 8 are fed to the feed roller zone of carding machine the diameter of the lap getting reduced and the lap being no more supported by the lap guide roller 4 and only being supported by main lap roller 1 for the unwinding and feeding of the lap to the feed roller zone of carding machine.<br>
Whenever, the main lap roller 1 rotates, the lap 8 wound on the said lap rod 7 and rotatably supported on the said main lap roller 1 is unwound and fed to the feed roller 9. During the period of processing of full lap, the lap 8 is supported by means of the said lap guide roller 4 additionally, over and above being supported by the main lap roller 1. The sense of rotation of the said main lap roller 1 and said lap guide roller 4 is<br><br>
same. During the unwinding of the initial layers, the lap 8 is supported additionally by the lap guide roller 4 and there by the sagging of the lap is eliminated. Advantages of the invention<br>
