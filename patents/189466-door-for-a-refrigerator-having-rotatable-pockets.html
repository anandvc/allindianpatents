				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a refrigerator, and more particularly to a door for a refrigerator having rotatable pockets.<br>
2.	Description of the Prior Art<br>
FIG. 1 is a perspective view showing a door for conventional refrigerator having pockets. As illustrated in FIG. 1, in general, pockets 14 are provided on the inner side of the door for the refrigerator. The pocket 14 contains a bottle, a can or other stuff. Each of the pockets 14 is made up with a base plate 14c, a guide wall 14a and a connection pit 14b. The base plate 14c has four sides. The base plate 14c supports the bottom of the stuff. Accordingly, contained stuff does not drop out of the pockets 14. The guide wall 14a has a first side-wall 14d and a second side-wall 14e. The first side-wall 14d confronts the second side-wall 14e. The first and second side-walls 14d and 14e are installed detachably on the respective inner surface of the first and second side-walls 11a and 11b of the door. The connection pit 14b is respectively formed on the first and second side-walls 14d and 14e. Respective connection protrusion 12 is formed on the first and second side-walls 11a and 11b of the door. When the pocket 14 is inserted between the first ind second side-walls 11a and 11b, the connection pit 14b of t..e pocket 14 is inserted between the first and second si-ie-walls lla and lib<br><br>
in order that the connection pit 14b of the pocket 14 may be engaged with the connection protrusion 12 of the first and second side-walls 11a and 11b.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 1, in case of engaging the connection pit with the connection protrusion 12, the pocket 14 is inserted downwards between the first and second side-wall 11a and 11b. In case of releasing the connection pit 14b<br><br>
and the connection protrusion 12, the pocket 14 is upwardly lifted.<br>
Meanwhile, a pocket shelf 13 is installed on the inner surface of the door 10. The pocket shelf 13 supports the base plate 14c of the pocket 14. Accordingly, the pocket 14 connected with the connection protrusion 12 is supported by the pocket shelf 13. Respective pocket 14 is installed with a predetermined distance from each other.<br>
In installing the above-mentioned conventional pocket, specifically when putting/taking the stuff into/out of the pocket, the upper part of the stuff gets caught in the lower part of the installed pocket. And this kind of obstacle also gives the damages to the guide rail.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present	invention is directed to a door<br>
for a refrigerator having the	rotatable pockets that<br>
substantially obviates one or	more of the problems due to<br>

An object of the present	invention is to provide a door<br>
for a refrigerator having the	rotatable pockets, which<br>
3<br><br>
includes: a pair of hinge bar installation parts formed in the upper and lower side inside a first side face of the door with a predetermined distance; a hinge bar installed between the pair of hinge bar installation parts and flushed with the first side-wall in its length direction; a plurality of pocket shelves each protruded out of the inner surface of the door and has one hole to which the hinge bar can be inserted; a plurality of pockets each placed between the pair of hinge bar installation parts, has a hinge bar insertion hole to which each hinge bar is inserted and moves in rotary way, supports respective base plate by the plurality of pocket shelves, and has a respective fixing groove; and a plurality of protrusion parts formed on the door's second side-wall which confronts the first side-wall and fixes each pocket by being connected to each fixing groove of the plurality of pockets.<br>
Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.<br>
It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
4<br><br>
The accompanying drawings, which are included to provide a further understanding of the invention and are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate embodiments of the invention and together with the description serve to explain the principles of the drawings:<br>
In the drawings:<br>
FIG. 1 is a perspective view showing a door for conventional a refrigerator having pockets;<br>
FIG. 2 is a perspective view showing a door for a refrigerator having the rotatable pockets of the invention; and<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates the connection state of the pocket of FIG. 2 with the side face of the door.<br>
 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
As illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 3, a hinge bar 26 is installed on one side-wall 21a of a door. A hinge bar insertion hole 241a is formed on one side of a pocket 241. The hinge bar insertion hole 241a is inserted into the hinge bar. Accordingly, the pocket 241 is rotatable centering on the hinge bar. A pair of hinge bar installation parts 22 are respectively installed on the upper and lower parts of the side-wall 21a of the door, protruding inwardly with a predetermined distance.(The lower hinge bar installation part is not shown, and same as the upper hinge bar installation<br>
5<br><br>
part.) The respective insertion hole of the hinge bar installation part confronts with each other. One end of the hinge bar 26 is inserted into the insertion hole of the upper hinge bar insertion part 22. The other end of the hinge bar 26 is inserted into the insertion hole of the lower hinge bar insertion part 22. The hinge bar 26 is flushed with the side-wall 21a in its length direction.<br>
Each pocket has a first side face 241c, second side face 241d, third side face 241e, a base place 241f, and a plurality of guide bars 25. The first, second and third side faces 241c, 241d and 241e are formed to upwardly protrude from the base plate 241f. The first side face 241c confronts the third side face 241c. The second side face 241d connects the one side of the first side face 241c with that of the third side face 241e. The second side face 241d confronts the plurality of guide bars 25. The hinge bar insertion hole 241a is formed in the first side face 241c. A fixing pit 24b i6 formed in the third side face 241a.<br>
Each pocket is respectively placed between the pair of hinge bar installation parts.<br>
The fixing groove 24b of the pocket 241 is formed in the length direction in the third side face. The plurality of guide bars 25 installed in the bar make contacts with the inner surface of the door. Each guide bar 25 connects the first and third side faces 241c and 24le. Two or more guide bars are respectively installed on the upper and lower part of the other side of the first and third side faces 241c and 241. The plurality of guide bars 25 prevent the ctored stuffs from<br>
6<br><br>
dropping out of the pocket 241. The fixing groove 24b is detachably connected to the one side of the side-wall 21b. The side-wall 21b confronts the side-wall 21a. That is, a protrusion part 21c is formed on one side of the side-wall 21b. The protrusion part 21c is inserted into the fixing groove 24b so that the pocket 241 is joined with the side-wall 21b. The pocket 241 is made of an elastic material.<br>
Additionally, two pocket shelves 23 are formed on the inner surface of the door 20. Each pocket shelf 23 is placed between the pair of hinge bar installation parts 22. Each pocket shelf 23 has one hole to which the hinge bar 26 is inserted. The pocket shelf 23 protrudes out of the inner surface of the door 20. The pocket shelf 23 supports the base plate of the pocket 241 from the bottom of the pocket 241. An operation of the rotatable pocket according to the embodiment of the invention will be described below.<br>
If one end of the pocket 241 is pulled forward (arrow mark A of FIG. 2), the fixing groove 24b of the pocket 241 releases the connection with the protrusion part 21c. Therefore, the pocket 241 becomes forward-rotatable, centering on the hinge bar 26.<br>
When the pocket is properly rotated forwards, stuffs such as a can or bottle can be put in the pocket 241. If the stuff pushes the pocket 241 backwards (arrow mark B in FIG. 2), the pocket 241 rotates backwards centering on the hinge bar 26 so that the fixing groove 24b is connected with the protrusion part 21c. In addition, when taking out the can or bottle contained in the pocket 241, it is the 6ame as described<br>
7<br><br>
above.<br>
As described above, when putting in and taking out the stuffs 6uch as a can and a bottle by the rotating the pocket, we can prevent the adjacent pocket installed upper and lower side from being damaged due to the can or bottle in the invention. Moreover, we can quite easily put in and take out the stuff.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the door for a refrigerator having rotatable pockets of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.<br><br>
