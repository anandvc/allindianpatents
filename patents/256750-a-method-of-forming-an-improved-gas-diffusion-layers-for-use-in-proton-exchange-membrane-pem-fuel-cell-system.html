GAS DIFFUSION LAYER FOR FUEL CELL<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates generally to fuel cell<br>
systems, and more particularly to a new and improved gas diffusion layers for<br>
use in Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell systems.<br>
2.	Discussion of the Related Art<br>
[0002]	Fuel cells have been used as a power source in many<br>
applications. For example, fuel cells have been proposed for use in electrical<br>
vehicular power plants to replace internal combustion engines. In PEM-type<br>
fuel cells, hydrogen is supplied to the anode of the fuel cell and oxygen is<br>
supplied as the oxidant to the cathode. PEM fuel cells include a membrane<br>
electrode assembly (MEA) comprising a thin, proton transmissive, non-<br>
electrically conductive solid polymer electrolyte membrane having the anode<br>
catalyst on one of its faces and the cathode catalyst on the opposite face.<br>
The MEA is sandwiched between a pair of electrically conductive elements,<br>
sometimes referred to as the gas diffusion media components, that: (1) serve<br>
as current collectors for the anode and cathode; (2) contain appropriate<br>
openings therein for distributing the fuel cell's gaseous reactants over the<br>
surfaces of the respective anode and cathode catalysts; (3) remove product<br>
water vapor or liquid water from electrode to flow field channels; (4) are<br>
thermally conductive for heat rejection; and (5) have mechanical strength.<br>
The term fuel cell is typically used to refer to either a single cell or a plurality<br>
of cells (e.g., a stack) depending on the context. A plurality of individual cells<br>
are commonly bundled together to form a fuel cell stack and are commonly<br>
arranged in series. Each cell within the stack comprises the MEA described<br>
earlier, and each such MEA provides its increment of voltage.<br>
[0003]	In PEM fuel cells, hydrogen (H2) is the anode reactant<br>
(i.e., fuel) and oxygen is the cathode reactant (i.e., oxidant). The oxygen can<br><br>
be either a pure form (O2), or air (a mixture of O2 and N2). The solid polymer<br>
electrolytes are typically made from ion exchange resins such as<br>
perfluoronated sulfonic acid. The anode/cathode typically comprises finely<br>
divided catalytic particles, which are often supported on carbon particles, and<br>
mixed with a proton conductive resin. The catalytic particles are typically<br>
costly precious metal particles. These membrane electrode assemblies are<br>
relatively expensive to manufacture and require certain conditions, including<br>
proper water management and humidification, and control of catalyst fouling<br>
constituents such as carbon monoxide (CO), for effective operation.<br>
[0004]	Examples of technology related to PEM and other related<br>
types of fuel cell systems can be found with reference to commonly-assigned<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 3,985,578 to Witherspoon et al.; 5,272,017 to Swathirajan et<br>
al.; 5,624,769 to Li et al.; 5,776,624 to Neutzler; 6,277,513 to Swathirajan et<br>

et al.; 6,824,909 to Mathias et al.; U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos.<br>
2005/0026012 to O'Hara; 2005/0026018 to O'Hara et al.; and 2005/0026523<br>
to O'Hara et al., the entire specifications of all of which are expressly<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0005]	The gas diffusion media component of a PEM fuel cell is<br>
typically comprised of a non-woven carbon fiber paper, e.g., those available<br>
from Toray Industries, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan), or a woven carbon cloth, e.g.,<br>
those available from Zoltek Corporation (St. Louis, Missouri) under the<br>
PANEX trade name. Upon arrival at the PEM fuel cell manufacturer, the as-is<br>
product is typically post treated in order to render the material hydrophobic.<br>
Additionally, it has become more common practice to apply a microlayer ink<br>
(sometimes referred to as a microporous layer (MPL)) to the gas diffusion<br>
layer (GDL) for more effective water management properties.<br>
[0006]	The gas diffusion media component of the fuel cell has<br>
many functions to fulfill in order to operate successfully in a PEM fuel cell. For<br>
example, the primary tasks of the gas diffusion media component include: (1)<br><br>
acting a diffuser for reactant gases traveling to the electrode; (2) transporting<br>
product water to the flow field; and (3) conducting electron and transferring<br>
heat generated at MEA to the coolant.<br>
[0007]	Along with the above requirements, automotive<br>
application requirements typically demand more of the gas diffusion media<br>
component, of which the following are included: (1) protect the MEA from<br>
damage from the bipolar plates during compression; (2) freeze compatibility;<br>
and (3) durability for thousands of hours under compression.<br>
[0008]	As previously noted, conventional GDLs are typically<br>
composed of non-woven carbon fiber paper or carbon cloth with an MPL<br>
coating thereon. The MPL is a carbon black/fluorinated polymer matrix that is<br>
coating by ink onto the gas diffusion media substrate. It is believed that the<br>
microporous layer is responsible for most of the water management of the<br>
substrate/layer package. In addition, the MPL behaves as a buffer to reduce<br>
some of the high stress spots on MEA during stack compression because it is<br>
composed of fine carbon and PTFE particles. Even though good performance<br>
has been achieved with GDLs in this configuration, there are still several<br>
unresolved issues.<br>
[0009]	First, because of the nature of non-woven carbon fiber<br>
paper and carbon cloth (fiber overlay and resin binder hard spots), there are<br>
generally high stress spots imposed on the MEA during stack compression,<br>
even with MPL coating as a buffer, which is believed to be one of the causes<br>
of MEA failures.<br>
[0010]	Second, the high porosity nature of carbon fiber paper or<br>
cloth may trap water after the stack shuts down, which is typically hard to be<br>
removed through a quick purge. This can cause freeze related damage.<br>
[0011]	Third, de-lamination is another serious issue for the MPL<br>
coating carbon fiber paper or cloth. The fluorinated polymer in the MPL<br>
serves as a binder as well as a hydrophobic agent. Intrinsically, the adhesion<br>
of this layer is less than desired due to the nature of the material.<br>
Rubbing/washing off of this layer during the build or operation phases of the<br><br>
running cell jeopardizes durability. Furthermore, good adhesion is required<br>
for consistently high current operation and freeze capability of the cell.<br>
[0012]	CARBEL®, a gas diffusion media product, readily<br>
commercially available from W. L. Gore &amp; Associates, Inc. (Newark,<br>
Delaware), can be considered as a "stand-alone" MPL-like material, which is<br>
essentially a carbon powder filled expanded PTFE film. CARBEL® cannot<br>
typically be used alone because it lacks the stiffness required to support the<br>
MEA, especially over the gas flow channel regions. However, the fuel cell<br>
performance using simply laminated CARBEL®, carbon fiber paper or cloth is<br>
not as good as the MPL coated carbon fiber paper or cloth. In other words,<br>
CARBEL® does not fulfill the required water management needs, especially<br>
under very wet conditions.<br>
[0013]	Accordingly, there exists a need for new and improved<br>
gas diffusion layers for gas diffusion media components of PEM fuel cell<br>
systems, especially those that include an independent or stand-alone MPL<br>
which can handle the water management requirements, generate<br>
substantially uniform compression over the MEA, and still maintain acceptable<br>
carbon fiber paper like mechanical properties.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0026]	The following description of the preferred is merely<br>
exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application, or uses.<br>
[0027]	The present invention provides a GDL with a relatively<br>
thin (e.g., about 150um total) package. In accordance with one aspect of the<br>
present invention, a relatively low areal weight carbon (or other suitable<br><br>
material such as but not limited to electroconductive fibrillated materials,<br>
screens, and/or the like) fiber mat (e.g., equal to or less than about 20 g/m2),<br>
which has a substantially open structure, was chosen as the substrate. By<br>
"open structure," as that phrase is used herein, it is meant a plurality of<br>
interstices, openings, voids, apertures, holes, and/or the like formed in the<br>
mat. It should also be appreciated that the areal weight of the fiber mat can<br>
be greater than 20 g/m2, depending on the material employed.<br>
[0028]	By way of a non-limiting example, fibrillated pulp<br>
materials, such as but not limited to fibrillated acrylic pulp fibers, are then<br>
dispersed in a liquid (e.g., water) and made to bloom, as shown in Fig. 1. The<br>
bloomed fibrillated acrylic pulp fibers are then added into a microporous layer<br>
ink. "Acrylic pulp," as that phrase is used herein, is meant to include a bundle<br>
of substantially fine acrylic fibers (e.g., a couple hundred nanometers in<br>
diameter). When added into water, these pulps will "bloom," as previously<br>
noted.<br>
[0029]	In accordance with another aspect of the present<br>
invention, the bloomed fibrillated acrylic pulp fibers can first be disposed on<br>
the carbon fiber mat, i.e., prior to combining them with the microporous layer<br>
ink. The microporous layer ink can then be disposed on the bloomed<br>
fibrillated acrylic pulp fibers and carbon fiber mat, wherein the microporous<br>
layer ink adheres to the bloomed fibrillated acrylic pulp fibers and carbon fiber<br>
mat. The bloomed fibrillated acrylic pulp fibers aids in holding the<br>
microporous layer ink in place.<br>
[0030]	When the MPL ink (e.g., a carbon black (or graphite<br>
particle, flake, nanofibers and/or the like) and fluoropolymer (e.g., PTFE, HFP,<br>
PVDF and/or the like) with the acrylic pulp was coated on the carbon fiber<br>
mat, the ink penetrated through the open substrate, but was locked into place<br>
by the acrylic pulp fibers. The intimate mixture of the pulp in the ink allows for<br>
additional support of the ink by the pulp, effectively adding a more substrate-<br>
like feature to the overall GDL. This allows for a buildup of MPL ink on top of<br>
the substrate for added thickness when the pulp sits on top of the mat. The<br>
entire structure has an intimate interface due to the openness of the mat and<br><br>
the penetration of the MPL in both the pulp and mat. The acrylic pulps<br>
supposedly decompose at temperatures above 220°C. However, with<br>
properly selected post-curing temperatures, these acrylic fibers can be fused<br>
and still maintain the integrity of the GDL layer.<br>
[0031]	Because a relatively low areal weight carbon fiber mat<br>
was selected, and the intimate mixture of MPL/pulp inter-disposed therein and<br>
on top of the mat, the high stress spots imposed on the MEA during stack<br>
compression are not present. Thus, the overall structure is more<br>
homogenous and composite compared to conventional GDL/MPL structures<br>
known in the art. An illustrative example of preparing a GDL in accordance<br>
with the general teachings of the present invention is presented in the<br>
Example, below:<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
Fibrillated acrylic pulps CFF 111-3 (Sterling Fibers, Inc., Pace,<br>
Florida) are dispersed in de-ionized water, isopropyl alcohol,<br>
and a small quantity of the surfactant Triton X 100 by a rotor<br>
stator at a rate of 9k rpm for 5 min. An appropriate amount of<br>
acetylene black carbon is added and sheared for an additional<br>
10 minutes at 11 krpm. Upon dispersion, Du Pont T-30 (or<br>
appropriate fluoropolymer) and a pH adjustor (ammonium<br>
carbonate) is added. The resulting ink is shaken by hand and<br>
knife coated onto a low areal weight carbon fiber mat<br>
(Hollingsworth and Vose Corp, Hawkinsville, Georgia), an<br>
example being product Number 8000019, having a basis weight<br>
of about 11.9 g/m2 and a veil thickness of about 4.4 mil. The<br>
GDL was then heat treated as a curing process for the acrylic<br>
pulp. The treatment included a 1 hour soak at 184°C, followed<br>
by a 260°C soak for 1 hour. The GDL was then soaked at<br>
380°C for 30 minutes.<br>
[0032]	Referring to Fig. 2, the resulting GDL formed in<br>
accordance with the Example is shown schematically generally at 10. As Fig.<br>
2 illustrates, the acrylic fibers 12 (e.g., bloomed fibrillated acrylic pulp) fasten<br>
to the substrate 14 (e.g., a low areal weight fiber carbon mat), thus anchoring<br>
the MPL 16 to the substrate 14. In this view, the acrylic fibers 12 (and any ink<br>
attached thereto) are operable to penetrate into the interstices 18 of the<br><br>
substrate 14, thus providing at least a part of the anchoring function.<br>
Additionally, the acrylic fibers 12' (and any ink attached thereto) are operable<br>
to be built up on top of the substrate 14, thus increasing the overall potential<br>
thickness of the MPL 16, consisting here of a combination 20 of the acrylic<br>
fibers and ink.<br>
[0033]	To determine the functionality of the GDL produced in<br>
accordance with the general teachings of the present invention, the potential<br>
versus current density characteristics of a small scale (e.g., 50cm2) fuel cell<br>
was performed under two different sets of test conditions, as shown in Figs. 3<br>
and 4.<br>
[0034]	The first experiment was carried out to evaluate gas<br>
diffusion media performance under relatively wet conditions, and the<br>
polarization curves are shown in Fig. 3. The cell was operated under the<br>
following conditions: 60°C, 170 KPA gauge, 100% H2 feed to anode at 2.0<br>
stoichiometry, air feed to the cathode with 2.0 oxygen stoichiometry, and 60°C<br>
dew point of feed streams. A second experiment, as shown in Fig. 4, was<br>
conducted under relatively mild conditions. Specifically, the cell was operated<br>
under the following conditions: 80°C, 50 KPA gauge, 100% H2 feed to anode<br>
at 2.0 stoichiometry, air feed to the cathode with 2.0 oxygen stoichiometry,<br>
and 70°C dew point of feed streams.<br>
[0035]	A conventional GDL, namely Toray TGPH 060 coated<br>
with a traditional MPL, was used to compare the performance of the GDL<br>
prepared in accordance with the general teachings of the present invention.<br>
As Figs. 3 and 4 clearly show, the potential versus current density<br>
characteristics of the fuel cell samples having the GDLs produced in<br>
accordance with the general teachings of the present invention were quite<br>
satisfactory. As such, comparable fuel cell performance to state of art GDLs<br>
has been achieved by using GDL's prepared in accordance with the general<br>
teachings of the present invention.<br>
[0036]	The present invention provides many benefits over<br>
conventional GDL's including but not limited to: (1) a reduction in the number<br>
of high stress spots on the MEA during stack compression; (2) a reduction in<br><br>
the de-lamination of MPL from substrates; (3) the MPL and the carbon fiber<br>
mat are more strongly integrated together and provide consistent performance<br>
over time; (4) better freeze tolerance; and (5) a "stand alone" MPL is provided<br>
with reasonable mechanical properties.<br>
[0037]	The description of the invention is merely exemplary in<br>
nature and, thus, variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention<br>
are intended to be within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not<br>
to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
A METHOD OF FORMING AN IMPROVED GAS DIFFUSION LAYERS FOR<br>
USE IN PROTON EXCHANGE MEMBRANE (PEM) FUEL CELL SYSTEM<br>
A gas diffusion layer for a fuel cell is described. The gas diffusion layer includes a<br>
carbon fiber mat having a substantially open structure. Bloomed fibrillated acrylic<br>
pulp is added into a microporous layer ink. Alternatively, the bloomed fibrillated<br>
acrylic pulp can first be disposed on the carbon fiber mat, with the microporous layer<br>
ink added thereafter. When the microporous layer ink/bloomed fibrillated acrylic pulp<br>
mixture is coated on the carbon fiber mat, the ink penetrates through the open<br>
substrate, and is locked into place by the bloomed acrylic pulp fibers. This allows for<br>
a buildup of microporous layer ink on top of the substrate for added thickness when<br>
the bloomed fibrillated acrylic pulp sits on top of the mat.</td>
