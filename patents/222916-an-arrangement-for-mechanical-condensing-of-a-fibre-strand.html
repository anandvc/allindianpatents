				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an arrangement for<br>
mechanical condensing of a fibre strand, comprising a condensing<br>
element arranged upstream of a nipping line of a delivery roller<br>
pair, which condensing element comprises a groove-like condensing<br>
slit which tapers laterally in transport direction, on the base of<br>
said condensing slit the fibre strand is guided in a sliding<br>
manner.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
An arrangement of this type is prior art in the Swiss<br>
published Patent 277 003. The known condensing element has a<br>
plane base and is arranged between two roller pairs without<br>
touching either of them. This arrangement is designed to improve<br>
the two-ply or spinning process. The improvement lies apparently<br>
in the fact that the fibre strand is laterally bundled when<br>
travelling through the condensing slit, so that at the nipping<br>
line of the delivery roller pair, a relatively narrow fibre<br>
strand having a reduced spinning triangle exits, thus resulting<br>
in a better quality thread. The disadvantage of the known<br><br>
arrangement is that the bundled fibre strand can spread out again<br>
somewhat before it reaches the nipping line of the delivery<br>
roller pair, so that the desired result is only partly achieved.<br>
GB 577094 discloses a fibre controlling means for textile<br>
drafting apparatus which comprises a guide 16 of substantially U-<br>
section having its flanking sides progressively spaced closer to-<br>
gether from the point of entry of the fibres, the internal walls<br>
19 and base surface 20 being convex so to guide the leading tips<br>
of the selvedge fibres positively into the main body of the sliver,<br>
the guide being chamfered at 21* 22 so that it may be positioned<br>
as near as possible to the drafting rollers 6, 12. The guides 16,<br>
which may be of porcelain, glass, synthetic resin or a metal<br>
pressing, may be mounted in pairs on a traverse bar 15 being<br>
carried by relatively adjustable members 17, 18.<br>
US 2,203,423 discloses a device for treating textile slivers<br>
or ravings comprising a body member having a narrow floor portion<br>
with upwardly extending side walls, the ends of said body being<br>
open, said floor portion being upwardly arched so as to extend<br><br>
bridging the space between one set of draft rolls and another set<br>
of draft rolls in the normal operating position of the device in a<br>
drawing mechanism, said side walls converging from the rear toward<br>
the front ends of the device for condensing the sliver in passing<br>
therebetween, the opposed inner side faces of said side walls<br>
being of convexedly curved form in cross section for lifting up<br>
and forcing over the body portion of the sliver the fibers lying<br>
close to and at the marginal portions of the sliver as the<br>
latter advances through the device* the curvature of said inner<br>
faces of the side walls extending in a continuous curve upwardly<br>
from their meeting line with the floor portion of distance of a at<br>
least the average thickness of a sliver when the same is acted<br>
upon by said walls in passing through the device.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
I is an object of the present invention to guide the fibre<br>
strand, bundled in the condensing slit, to the nipping line in<br>
its condensed form without the fibre spreading out again.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided an arrangement<br>
for mechanical condensing of a fibre strand comprising a<br>
condensing zone which is arranged downstream of a drafting unit<br>
being bordered by a nipping line and a condensing element<br>
disposed upstream of the nipping line formed of a delivery roller<br>
pair, the condensing element having a groove-like condensing slit<br>
which tapers laterally in transport direction A, on the base of<br>
said condensing slit the fibre strand is guided in a sliding<br>
manner. The condensing slit has base which is convexly shaped in<br>
transport direction (A) and in that the base is continued at the<br>
end of the condensing slit by a similarly convexly shaped fibre<br>
guiding surface of the condensing element.<br>
In the case of purely mechanical fibre condensing, the fibre<br>
strand to be condensed is drawn through a tapering and<br>
continuously curved condensing slit, whereby the fibre strand is<br>
increasingly condensed. As the fibre strand glides over a surface<br><br>
which is convex in design and which forms the base of the<br>
condensing slit, a certain drafting force acts on the fibres due<br>
to the curve of the base, which drafting force leads to a normal<br>
force which presses the fibres to the base of the slit. This<br>
normal force has, as a consequence, a fractional force, which<br>
prevents the condensed fibre strand from spreading out again<br>
during transport.<br><br>
The base of the slit is preferably V-shaped in cross section. This results in a<br>
particularly intensive condensing.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the base of the slit is continued at the end<br>
of the condensing slit by a fibre guiding surface, also convex in shape, of the<br>
condensing element. As a result, when the fibres of the fibre strand exit out of the<br>
condensing slit, they continue to be on a curved surface. Due to the occuring<br>
drafting forces, the fibres are pressed onto this curved surface, whereby in<br>
connection with the hereby occuring friction, a spreading out of the fibre strand in<br>
transverse direction is avoided, even when it leaves the condensing slit. It is hereby<br>
advantageous when, before it reaches the nipping line, the fibre strand is guided<br>
longitudinally along a part of the periphery of a delivery roller of the delivery roller<br>
pair. In the case of this delivery roller, an upper roller or a base roller can be involved<br>
here. Thus the fibres remain under a certain tension downstream of the fibre guiding<br>
surface, in that they continue to lie on a curved surface, which prevents the loss of<br>
the condensing effect. It is advantageous when the curved condensing element is<br>
hereby pressed against one of the delivery rollers.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, a similarly convex-shaped intake<br>
guiding surface of the condensing element can precede the base of the slit at the<br>
start of the condensing slit, which intake guiding surface is pressed against a nipping<br>
roller of a nipping roller pair arranged upstream of the condensing element. This is<br>
not absolutely necessary for condensing, but results in the advantage that the<br>
condensing element can be better aligned along this nipping roller. The pressure of<br>
the fibre guiding surface and/or the intake guiding surface can occur by means of a<br>
preferably adjustable loading spring at the relevant delivery roller or nipping roller.<br>
The condensing element can be so designed that the condensing slit can be formed<br>
by lateral ribs or the like. The condensing slit can, however, also be molded into a<br>
condensing element made preferably of ceramic.<br>
It is advantageously provided that the length of the slit base, including a possibly<br>
present fibre guiding surface and an intake guiding surface, corresponds to the<br>
average fibre lengths of the fibre strand.<br><br>
The condensing element can be arranged at different places relative to a drafting<br>
unit. In one embodiment it is provided that the condensing element is arranged<br>
downstream of the drafting zone of a drafting unit. Alternatively it can be provided<br>
that the condensing element is arranged in the last drafting zone of a drafting unit.<br>
An advantageously designed embodiment is then possible when the condensing<br>
element, together with further condensing elements, is arranged on a guide rail which<br>
extends along a number of spinning positions. It can also be provided that the<br>
condensing element is mounted on a top weighting arm of a drafting unit.<br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
An arrangement 1 according to Figures 1 to 4 for<br>
mechanically condensing a fibre strand 3 comprises a condensing<br>
zone 2, which is arranged downstream of a drafting unit 4.<br>
In a known drafting unit 4 of this kind, the sliver or roving 5 is<br>
drafted to the desired degree in transport direction A. Of the<br>
drafting unit 4 only the front roller pair 6, 7 as well as an<br>
apron pair 8, 9 arranged upstream thereof 5 are shown. The front<br>
roller pair 6, 7 comprises a driven base roller 6 and a top<br>
roller 7. The drafting zone of the drafting unit 4 ends at the<br>
front nipping line 10 of the front pair 6, 7.<br>
If a drafted fibre strand 3 is imparted a spinning twist<br>
directly downstream of the front nipping line 10» a relatively<br>
wide spinning triangle would occur at the front nipping line 10,<br>
which would come about because the drafted fibre strand 3 leaves<br>
the front nipping line 10 having a relatively large width and is<br><br>
twisted to a thread having a relatively small diameter. The<br>
spinning triangle then comprises lateral fibres, which contribute<br>
little or nothing to the tensile strength of the spun thread so<br>
that they are not properly bound into the twisted thread. For<br>
this reason the so-called condensing zone 2 is arranged downstream<br>
of the drafting unit 4, which condensing zone 2 is in turn bordered<br>
by a nipping line 13. This nipping line 13 is formed by a<br>
delivery roller pair 11, 12, which comprises a driven delivery<br>
roller 11 and a top roller 12. Downstream of the nipping line 13<br>
the twisted thread 14 is formed, in that it is fed in delivery<br>
direction B to a twist device (not shown), for example a ring<br>
spindle. With regard to the spinning twist, the nipping line 13<br>
acts as a twist block, so that the condensing zone 2 remains<br>
twist-free. The thread 14 spun in this way is then more even,<br>
tear-resistant and less hairy due to the reduced spinning<br>
triangle at the nipping line 13.<br>
The arrangement 1 functions in a purely mechanical way<br>
comprises a condensing element 15 made preferably of ceramic,<br>
and which is arranged between the front nipping line 10 and the<br>
nipping line 13, said condensing element 15 having a groove-like<br>
condensing slit 16 laterally tapering in transport direction A.<br>
The condensing zone 2 is thus located downstream of the drafting<br>
zone of the drafting unit 4.<br><br>
According to the present invention the condensing slit 16 has in transport direction A<br>
a convexly designed slit base 17, over which the fibre strand 3 to be condensed is<br>
guided in a sliding manner. The slit base 17 has a preferably V-shaped design in<br>
cross section. The fibre strand 3 is drawn in transport direction A through the<br>
tapering, continuously curved condensing slit 16, whereby said fibre strand 3 is<br>
subject to a certain tension, which pushes the fibre strand 3 into the slit base 17. Due<br>
to these forces, the fibres of the fibre strand 3 always move in the slit base 17 of the<br>
V-shaped condensing slit 16 and are continuously condensed along the tapering<br>
condensing slit 16.<br>
It lies in the nature of the condensing slit 16 that it cannot approximate the nipping<br>
line 13. In order, however, that the fibre strand 3 does not laterally spread out again<br>
upstream of the nipping point 13 after it has left the condensing slit 16, it is provided<br>
that the slit base 17 is continued at the end of the condensing slit 16 by an similarly<br>
convex-shaped fibre guiding surface 18 of the condensing element 15. When the<br>
fibre strand 3 exits the condensing slit 16, the fibres continue to be subject to a<br>
tension on a curved surface. Due to the occuring drafting forces, they are pressed<br>
onto this surface, whereby, together with the friction occuring in transverse direction,<br>
the fibres of the already condensed fibre strand 3 are prevented from moving apart<br>
again. Directly downstream of the fibre guiding surface 18, the fibre strand 3 is<br>
guided along a part of the periphery 19 of the top roller 12 of the delivery roller pair<br>
11, 12 before it reaches the nipping line 13. As the periphery 19 is also a curved<br>
surface, the condensed fibre strand remains in its condensed state until it reaches<br>
the nipping point 13, whereafter it is then twisted to a thread 14. It is hereby<br>
advantageous when the fibre guiding surface 18 of the condensing element 15 is<br>
pressed in a springy way to the top roller 12 of the delivery roller pair 11, 12. A<br>
nipping line 20 thus arises between the fibre guiding surface 18 and the periphery 19<br>
of the top roller 12.<br>
Accordingly, an intake guiding surface 21 of the condensing element 15, also<br>
convexly shaped, can precede the slit base 17 at the start of the condensing slit 16,<br>
which intake guiding surface 21 is in turn pressed in a springy way to the top roller 7<br>
of the front roller pair 6, 7 of the drafting unit 4. A further nipping line 22 is formed<br>
between the intake guiding surface 21 and the top roller 7.<br><br>
The loading spring 23 schematically shown in Figure 1 is preferably adjustable. It is<br>
so designed that the condensing element 15 aligns itself in relation to the two top<br>
rollers 7 and 12.<br>
The condensing slit 16 of the condensing element 15 is formed in the present case<br>
by lateral ribs 24 and 25. The length of the slit base 17 including the fibre guiding<br>
surface 18 and the intake guiding surface 21 is measured in such a way that it<br>
corresponds to the average fibre length of the fibre strand 3.<br>
The condensing element 15 can be arranged, together with further condensing<br>
elements (not shown), on a guide rail 26, which extends along a number of spinning<br>
positions.<br>
The embodiment of the present invention according to Figure 5 corresponds to a<br>
great extent to that in the Figures 1 to 4, the one difference being that in Figure 5 a<br>
condensing element 515 is provided, which is pressed not to the top rollers 7 and 12,<br>
but rather to the respectively driven base rollers 6 and 11. Thus nipping lines 520<br>
and 522 are formed, whereby the fibre guiding surface 518 is pressed to the base<br>
roller 11 and the intake guiding surface 521 is pressed to the base roller 6. The fibre<br>
strand 3 is here also drawn over the convexly shaped slit base 517 of the condensing<br>
slit 516 while subject to tension.<br>
The distribution of forces are demonstrated with the aid of Figure 6, which forces<br>
prevent the condensing process of the already condensed fibre strand 3 being<br>
reversed.<br>
The delivery roller pair 11, 12 can be seen together with the final nipping line 13, as<br>
well as a preceding fibre guiding surface 518, which is pressed to the base roller 11<br>
of the delivery roller pair 11, 12 at the nipping line 520.<br>
As a result of the curve of the delivery roller 11, drafting forces Z1 and Z2 act on the<br>
fibre strand 3, from which normal forces N result, which press the fibre strand 3 to<br>
the periphery 519 of the driven base roller 11. A friction arises therefrom in<br>
transverse direction, which prevents the already condensed fibre strand 3 from<br>
moving laterally apart, that is transversely to the transport direction A. Thus the<br>
condensing effect remains present when the fibre strand 3 leaves the condensing slit<br>
516 and has not yet reached the nipping line 13.<br><br>
According to the variation in Figures 7 and 8, a condensing element 715 is provided<br>
which is located in the last drafting zone 727 of a drafting unit 704. It is hereby<br>
preferably arranged on a top weighting arm 728 of the drafting unit 704.<br>
A base apron table 729, arranged upstream, can be seen, which guides the base<br>
apron 8 and on which the condensing element 715 is indirectly supported by a<br>
supporting device 730. The condensing element 715 is supported on a nipping line<br>
720 on the periphery 719 of the driven base roller 6 of the front roller pair 6, 7 of the<br>
drafting unit 704. The condensing slit 716 of the condensing element 715 is again<br>
convexly shaped and graduates into a fibre guiding surface 718, which is disposed at<br>
the nipping line 720 on the base roller 6.<br>
The embodiment of the present invention shown in Figure 9 corresponds to a great<br>
extent to the embodiment shown in Figure 7, the one difference being that there is a<br>
small gap between the fibre guiding surface 718 and the periphery 719 of the driven<br>
base roller 6. As long as this gap is very narrow, the condensed fibre strand 3<br>
cannot expand again before it reaches the periphery 719.<br>
According to a further embodiment shown in Figure 10, a special drafting unit 1004 is<br>
provided in whose last drafting zone 1027 the condensing element 1015 is arranged.<br>
It is again supported on the driven base roller 6 of the front roller pair 6, 7 of the<br>
drafting unit 1004. Otherwise there is no significant difference to the embodiment as<br>
shown in Figure 7.<br>
According to Figure 10, a drafting unit 1004 is provided which does not comprise a<br>
base apron, but rather only an upper apron 1009 arranged upstream of the front<br>
roller pair 6, 7. This upper apron 1009 loops an apron pressure roller 1032, to which<br>
the sliver or roving 5 is fed in transport direction A. The upper apron 1009 acts<br>
together with a base roller 1031 having a relatively large diameter, on the periphery<br>
of said base roller 1031 the upper apron 1009 is guided until shortly before reaching<br>
the condensing element 1015. As soon as the fibre strand 3 to be condensed, still<br>
inside the drafting zone 1027, reaches the slit base 1017 of the condensing element<br>
1015, said fibre strand 3 is drafted over a curved surface, which is formed<br>
downstream of the slit base 1017 by a fibre guiding surface 1018 of the condensing<br>
element 1015 and thereafter by the periphery 719 of the base roller 6.<br><br>
It is should be noted that the condensing element 1015 is pressed to the base roller 6<br>
via a holding device 1034.<br><br>

condensing slit (16) is formed by lateral nibs (24, 25).<br>
8. An arrangement as claimed in claims 1 to 7, wherein<br>
the length of the slit base (17; 915) comprising that of a<br>
fibre guiding surface (18; 518) and an intake guiding surface<br>
(21; 521), corresponds to the average fibre length of the fibre<br>
strand (3).<br>
9. An arrangement as claimed in claims 1 to 8. wherein the<br>
condensing element (15; 515) is arranged downstream of the<br>
drafting area of a drafting unit (4).<br>
10. An arrangement as claimed in claims 1 to 8, wherein<br>
the condensing element is arranged in the last drafting<br>
zone (727) of a drafting unit.<br>
11. An arrangement as claimed in claims 1 to 10, wherein<br>
the condensing element (15), together with further condensing<br>
elements, are arranged on a guide rail (26) which extends along a<br>
number of spinning positions.<br><br>
12. An arrangement as claimed in claims 1 to 11, wherein<br>
the condensing element is mounted on a top weighting arm of a<br>
drafting unit.<br>
The invention relates to an arrangement (1) for mechanical condensing of a fibre<br>
strand (3) comprising a condensing zone (2) which is arranged downstream of a<br>
drafting unit (4) being bordered by a nipping line (13); and a condensing<br>
element (15) disposed upstream of the nipping line (13) formed of a delivery<br>
roller pair (11, 12), the condensing element (15) having a groove-like<br>
condensing slit (16) which tapers laterally in transport direction A, on the base<br>
(17) of said condensing slit (16) the fibre strand (3) is guided in a sliding<br>
manner, characterized in that the condensing slit (16; 516; 716; 1016) has a<br>
base (17; 517; 717; 1017) which is convexly shaped in transport direction (A)<br>
and in that the base (17; 517; 717; 1017) is continued at the end of the<br>
condensing slit (16; 516; 716; 1016) by a similarly convexly shaped fibre guiding<br>
surface (18; 518; 718; 1018) of the condensing element (15; 515; 715; 1015).</td>
