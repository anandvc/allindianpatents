"STATIN DERIVATIVES"<br>
The present invention relates to new statin derivatives. More particularly, the present invention relates to statin nitroderivatives, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use as cholesterol-reduC1ng drugs, as drugs having immunosuppressive properties, antioxidant, antithrombotic and anti¬inflammatory activity, effects on endothelial function, and for treating and/or preventing acute coronary syndromes, stroke, neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease as well as autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis.<br>
With statins a class of compounds is intended, comprising as main components lovastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, mevastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, rosuvastatin and cerivastatin (rivastatin). They possess a side group that is structurally similar to HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A). Fluvastatin, atorvastatin, rosuvastatin and cerivastatin are entirely synthetic compounds containing a heptanoic aC1d side chain, the remainders being fungal metabolites.<br>
It is known that the various statins are inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme which catalyses an early, rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis, reduce triglyceride levels and are also indicated for raising HDL-C levels (P.O. Bonetti et al., European Heart Journal (2003) 24, 225-248).<br>
However, it is also known that statins exhibit adverse effects,  such  as  for  example  hepatopathy,  possible<br><br>
carC1nogenic potential, muscular side-effects and, above all, myopathy.<br>
It was now object of the present invention to provide new derivatives of statins able not only to eliminate or at least reduce the side effects assoC1ated with these compounds, but also having an improved pharmacological activity. It has been so surprisingly found that statin nitroderivatives have a significantly improved overall profile as compared to native statins both in term of wider pharmacological activity and enhanced tolerability. In particular, it has been recognized that the statin nitroderivatives of the present invention exhibit a strong anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic and antiplatelet activity and can be furthermore employed for reduC1ng cholesterol and triglycerides levels, for raising HDL-C levels and for treating or preventing acute coronary syndromes, stroke, peripheral vascular diseases such as peripheral ischemia and all disorders assoC1ated with endothelial dysfunctions such as vascular complications in diabetic patients and atherosclerosis. They should also be employed for treating neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease as well as multiple sclerosis.<br>

As mentioned above, object of the present invention are also pharmaceutical compositions containing at least a compound of the present invention of formula (1) together with non toxic adiuvants and/or carriers usually employed in the pharmaceutical field.<br>
The daily dose of active ingredient that should be administered can be a single dose or it can be an effective amount divided into several smaller doses that are to be administered throughout the day. Usually, total daily dose may be in amounts preferably from 50 to 500 mg. The dosage regimen and administration frequency for treating the mentioned diseases with the compound of the invention and/or with the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention will be selected in accordance with a variety of factors, including for example age, body weight, sex and medical condition of the patient as well as severity of the disease, route of administration, pharmacological considerations and eventual concomitant therapy with other drugs. In some instances, dosage levels below or above the aforesaid range and/or more frequent may be adequate, and this logically will be within the judgment of the physiC1an and will depend on the disease state.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered orally, parenterally, rectally or topically, by inhalation or  aerosol,   in  formulations  eventually  containing<br><br>
conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles as desired. Topical administration may also involve the use of transdermal administration such as transdermal patches or iontophoresis devices. The term "parenteral" as used herein, includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal injection or infusion techniques.<br>
Injectable preparations, for example sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents are water. Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono or diglycerides, in addition fatty aC1ds such as oleic aC1d find use in the preparation of injectables.<br>
Suppositories for rectal administration of the drug can be prepared by mixing the active ingredient with a suitable non-irritating exC1pient, such as cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.<br>
Solid dosage forms for oral administration may include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, granules and gels. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as in normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g. lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may<br><br>
also comprise buffering agents.  Tablets and pills can additionally be prepared with enteric coatings.<br>
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration may include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs containing inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water. Such compositions may also comprise adjuvants, such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, and sweetening, flavouring and the like.<br>
As previously reported, the new statin nitroderivatives beyond lowering lipid, possess enhanced anti-inflammatory, antiplatelet and antithrombotic effects as compared to native statins. Moreover, they can be effective also in the other pathologies such as acute coronary syndromes, stroke, peripheral vascular diseases such as peripheral ischemia, all disorders assoC1ated with endothelial dysfunctions such as vascular complications in diabetic patients and atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis.<br>
Study on vascular tone<br>
The ability of statin nitroderivatives to induce vasorelaxation in comparison to native statins, was tested in vitro in isolated rabbit thoraC1c aorta preparations (Wanstall J.C. et al., Br. J. Pharmacol., 134:463-472, 2001) . Male New Zealand rabbits were anaesthetized with thiopental-Na (50 mg/kg, iv), sacrificed by exsanguinations and then the thorax was opened and the aorta dissected. Single ring preparations (4 mm in length) of thoraC1c aorta were set up in physiological salt solution (PSS) at 37oC in small organ chambers (5 ml) . The composition of PSS was (mM) : NaCl 130, NaHC03l4.9, KH2PO4I.2, MgS04l.2, HEPES 10,<br><br>
CaClz , ascorbic aC1d 170 and glucose 1.1 (95% O2 /5% CO2 ; pH 7.4). Each ring was mounted under 2 g passive tension in 5 ml organ bath. Isometric tension was recorded with a Grass transducer (Grass FT03) attached to a BIOPAC MP150 System. Preparations were allowed to equilibrate for 1 h, then contracted submaximally with noradrenaline (NA, 1 μM) and, when the contraction was stable, acetylcholine (ACh, 10 ]iM) was added. A relaxant response to ACh indicated the presence of a functional endothelium. When a stable precontraction was reached, a cumulative concentration-response curve to either of the vasorelaxant agents was obtained in the presence of a functional endothelium. Time intervals between different concentrations were based on the time needed to reach a full response. Moreover, the effect of the soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor ODQ (1-H-(1,2,4)-oxadiazol(4,3-a)quinoxalin-1-one) on the dilator responses eliC1ted by the compounds was examined preincubating the aortic rings with ODQ (10 μM) for 20 min. Responses to vasorelaxing agents were measured from the plateau of NA contraction. The IC50 (concentration giving 50% reversal of NA contraction) was interpolated from the plots of relaxant-response vs log molar concentration of tested compound.<br>
During the experimental period, the plateau obtained with NA was stable without significant spontaneous loss of contraction in the aortic rings. Under these experimental conditions, native statins did not produce relaxation up to 30 μM, the curve being not different from that built up in presence of vehicle alone.<br>
As shown in the following Table 1, the nitroderivatives of the invention were able to induce relaxation in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, in experiments<br><br>
performed in presence of ODQ (10 μM} ,    the vasorelaxant responses to all the tested drugs were inhibited.<br><br>
IC50  is  the  concentration which  inhibits  50%  of  the response.<br>
Effects of nitrostatin derivatives on inflammatory pathways in vitro<br>
The experiments were performed using RAW264.7 monocyte macrophage cell line. Cells were stimulated in the presence of LPS (1 pg/ml) for 8 h (pravastatin and derivative) or 16 h (fluvastatin, atorvastatin and derivatives). At the end of the incubation, the cells were harvested in lysis buffer and the protein content was measured. Western Blot of induC1ble iNOS and C0X2 proteins (representatives of an ongoing inflammatory process) was performed. The obtained results reported in Table 2 are expressed as % reduction of optical density of each treatment vs. LPS-treated samples. Negative results indicate an increase vs. LPS alone.<br><br><br>
Nitroderivatives of fluvastatin, pravastatin and atorvastatin exert, in RAW264.7 cell line, a significant inhibitory action on the expression of proteins, such as C0X2 and iNOS, that are recognised to be relevant in the inflammatory process. Conversely, these effects are not detectable or weak for the parent compounds.<br>
Study of the activity of pravastatin nitroderivative on peripheral vascular disease<br>
Angiogenesis is a primary response to local tissue hypoxia and is likely involved in the restoration of blood flow in ischemic diseases such as acute coronary syndromes and occlusive peripheral vascular disease. The ability of pravastatin nitroderivative (compound of EX.1) to inhibit the angiogenic process was evaluated using an in vivo model of murine hindlimb ischemia as previously described (Emanueli et al., C1rculation 103,125-132, 2001) . Briefly,  2 month-old CDl male mice (Charles<br><br>
River, Italy) mice were randomly allocated into 3 groups (n=20 each) feed rat chow containing: 1) pravastatin (40 mg/kg), 2) pravastatin nitroderivative (48 mg/kg), 3) vehicle (regular chow), After 3 days, mice were anaesthetized and left hindlimb ischemia was induced by electro-coagulation of the upper part of femoral artery. Treatment was continued for the following 2 weeks after surgery. Systolic blood pressure was measured by tail cuff technique at 7 and 14 days. The clinical outcome at 14 days was determined by counting the number of necrotic or lost nails in the ischemic foot as well as the number of auto-amputation events. At 14 days from ischemia induction, hindlimbs of anaesthetized mice were perfusion-fixed, both adductors were coded and histologically processed. Capillary and arteriolar densities (ncap/nim^ and nart/mm^) were determined.<br><br>
As shown in Table 3, differently from the parent compound, the compound of the invention was able to potentiate the native reparative capillarization response to ischemia. The results of the present study indicate that the nitroderivative promotes a significant reparative neovascularization and ameliorates clinical outcome in mice with experimentally-induced hindlimb ischemia.<br><br>
Effect of pravastatin nitroderivative on leukocytes adhesion in ApoE knockout mice<br>
The interaction between leukocytes and the vascular endothelium is a cruC1al inflammatory step in the atherogenic process. The ability of pravastatin nitroderivative (compound of EX.1) to inhibit leukocyte adhesion was investigated ex vivo in atherosclerotic (ApoE knockout) mice.<br>
Three groups of ApoE knockout   mice were dosed with<br>
pravastatin  (40mg/kg  po) ,  pravastatin  nitroderivative<br>
(equimolar dose) or vehicle daily for 5 days and euthanised<br>
by CO2 euthanised by CO2 asphyxiation Ih after the last<br>
dose.<br>
Leukocytes were isolated from spleen, centrifuged, RBCs lysed with water. Arterial segments prepared - aortic &amp; thoraC1c regions opened longitudinally and pinned out luminal side up. Radiolabelled<br>
leukocytes (51 Cr-leukocytes) are incubated with thrombin-stimulated (lOUmL-1 for 10 min.) segments for 30 min. Segments are washed with medium and adhesion measured by gamma counter.<br><br><br>
As shown in Table 4, differently from the parent compound,<br>
the compound of the invention was able to reduce the<br>
thrombin-induced  adhesive  interaction  between  isolated<br>
leukocytes and the blood vessel wall in both strains of<br>
mice.<br>
These data demonstrate that the nitroderivative exerts<br>
anti-atherogenic/anti-inflammatory effects.<br>
Study   of   antithrombotic   activity   of   pravastatin nitroderivative in vivo<br>
The ability of pravastatin nitroderivative to inhibit thrombus formation was evaluated in male Charles Rivers CD-I mice ( 20-25 g) given pravastatin (10 or 20 mg/kg ip), compound of EX.1 (equimolar doses) or vehicle. 1-3 hrs later the animals were injected into a tail vein with U46619 (0.2 mg/kg), a stable TxA2 analog. As previously described (Momi et al., Eur. J, Pharmacol. 397:177-185, 2000), this dose of the agonist caused 80 to 90% mortality within 3 min. in the control group. In each experimental session at least six animals per treatment group were tested; control groups were run at the beginning and at the end of every experimental session. Protection against agonist-induced thromboembolism was expressed as (1-Tdrug/Tsaline) X 100, Were Tdrug is the mortality rate in drug-treated mice, and Tgaiine is the number of non surviving control animals which received thrombin only. The results were expressed as percentage of protection from U4 6619-induced pulmonary thromboembolism as compared to the control group.<br><br><br>
As shown in Table 5, differently from the parent compound, the compound of the invention was able to inhibit thrombosis induced by U46619.<br>
Study of antiplatelet activity of pravastatin nitroderivative in  vitro<br>
Platelets are prominent components of the thrombi. The ability of pravastatin nitroderivative (compound of EX.1) to inhibit platelet aggregation was evaluated in vitro in human platelets. Platelet aggregation was measured in 0.25 ml platelet reached plasma (PRP) or gel filtered platelets (GFP) samples as previously described (Vezza R, et al., Blood 73: 2006-2013, 1993).<br>
Compounds were incubated at 37°C for 2 min before adding U46619, an aggregating agent, TxA2 analog. Aggregation was followed for 5 min and the maximal amplitude (cm) was measured. DMSO (0.05% ) was used as vehicle. Compounds were tested at concentrations ranging from 50 to 200μM.<br><br><br>
As shown in Table 6, differently from the parent compound, the nitroderivative of the invention was able to inhibit platelet aggregation induced by U46619.<br>
Effect of pravastatin nitroderivative on inhibition of Tissue Factor es^ression in vitro<br>
Tissue factor (TF) is a major regulator of homeostasis and thrombosis. The ability of pravastatin nitroderivative<br>
(compound of EX.1) to inhibit TF expression was evaluated in isolated human blood mononuclear cell (MNC) preparations. MNC were obtained from fresh blood by density gradient (Ficoll-Hypaque) centrifugation and resuspended in serum-free RPMI medium at the concentration of 2-3xl06/ml. Pravastatin nitroderivative (3-50 |IM) or pravastatin (50 μM) was added to cell suspensions prior to exposure to LPS<br>
(1 μg/ml) . After incubation for 3 h at 37oC, TF expression in MNC was assessed by 1) functional assay (Semeraro et al., 1983. Immunology; 50: 529-35 ) on intact cells; 2) immunological assay (1mubind, Instrumentation Laboratory, Milan) on Triton X-100 cell extracts; 3) RT-PCR (Rossiello et al. Thromb Haemost 2000; 84:453-59).<br><br><br>
As shown in Table 7, differently from the parent compound, the compound of the invention markedly inhibited LPS-induced TF expression (activity and antigen). The  results  of the present  study  indicate  that  the nitroderivative exerts antithrombotic activity.<br>
The following examples are to further illustrate the invention without limiting it.<br>
