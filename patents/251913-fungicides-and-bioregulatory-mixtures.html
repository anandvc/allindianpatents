				<td>Description<br>
The present invention relates to fungicidal and bioregulatory mixtures comprising<br>
(1)    epoxiconazole of the formula I<br><br>
or salts or adducts thereof<br>
and<br>
trinexapac-ethyl of the formula II<br><br>
in a synergistically effective amount.<br>
Moreover, the invention relates to a method for controlling harmful fungi using mixtures<br>
of the compound I with the compound II and to the use of the compound I and the<br>
compound !! for preparing such mixtures and to compositions comprising these<br>
mixtures.<br>
Moreover, the invention relates to a method for regulating the growth of plants using<br>
mixtures of the compound I with the compound II and to the use of the compound I and<br>
the compound II for preparing such mixtures and to compositions comprising these<br>
mixtures.<br>
Epoxiconazole of the formula I and its use as a crop protection agent are described in<br>
EP-B 0 196 038.<br><br>
In addition to fungicidal properties, azoles frequently also have growth-regulating<br>
properties.<br>
Trinexapac-ethyl of the formula II and its plant growth-regulating action are described in<br>
EP-A 0 126 713.<br>
Trinexapac-ethyl also has resistance-inducing properties against plant diseases in a<br>
number of plant species.<br>
It is an object of the present invention, with a view to reducing the application rates and<br>
broadening the activity spectrum of the known compounds, to provide mixtures which,<br>
at a reduced total amount of active compounds applied, have improved activity against<br>
harmful fungi, in particular for specific indications.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the mixtures defined at the outset.<br>
Moreover, we have found that simultaneous, that is joint or separate, application of the<br>
compound I and an active compound II or successive application of the compound I<br>
and an active compound II allows for better control of harmful fungi than is possible<br>
with the individual compounds (synergistic mixtures). The compound I can be used as<br>
synergist for a large number of different active compounds. By simultaneous joint or<br>
separate application of the compound I with an active compound II, the fungicidal<br>
activity is increased in a superadditive manner.<br><br>
is known from EP-B 0 196 038.<br>
Trinexapac-ethyl of the formula II<br><br><br><br>
is described in EP-A 0 126 713.<br>
Owing to the basic character of its nitrogen atoms, the compound I is capable of<br>
forming salts or adducts with inorganic or organic acids or with metal ions.<br>
Examples of inorganic acids are hydrohalic acids, such as hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen<br>
chloride, hydrogen bromide and hydrogen iodide, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and<br>
nitric acid.<br>
Suitable organic acids are, for example, formic acid, carbonic acid, and alkanoic acids,<br>
such as acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, trichloroacetic acid and propionic acid, and also<br>
glycolic acid, thiocyanic acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid,<br>
cinnamic acid, oxalic acid, alkylsulfonic acids (sulfonic acids having straight-chain or<br>
branched alkyl radicals of 1 to 20 carbon atoms), arylsulfonic acids or aryldisulfonic<br>
acids (aromatic radicals, such as phenyl and naphthyl, which carry one or two sulfonic<br>
acid groups), alkylphosphonic acids (phosphonic acids having straight-chain or<br>
branched alkyl radicals of 1 to 20 carbon atoms), arylphosphonic acids or<br>
aryldiphosphonic acids (aromatic radicals, such as phenyl and naphthyl, which carry<br>
one or two phosphoric acid radicals), where the alkyl or aryl radicals may carry further<br>
substituents, for example p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, p-aminosalicylic acid, 2-<br>
phenoxybenzoic acid, 2-acetoxybenzoic acid, etc.<br>
Suitable metal ions are in particular the ions of the elements of the second main group,<br>
in particular calcium and magnesium, of the third and fourth main group, in particular<br>
aluminum, tin and lead and also of transition groups one to eight, in particular<br>
chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, and others. Particular<br>
preference is given to the metal ions of the elements of transition groups of the fourth<br>
period. The metals can be present in the various valencies that they can assume.<br>
The mixtures of the compound I and an active compound II, or the simultaneous, that is<br>
joint or separate, use of the compound I and an active compound II, have excellent<br>
activity against a broad spectrum of phytopathogenic fungi, in particular from the<br>
classes of the Ascomycetes, Deuteromycetes, Peronosporomycetes (syn. Oomycetes)<br>

The mixtures of the compound I and an active compound II are particularly suitable for<br>
controlling harmful fungi from the class of the Peronosporomycetes (syn. Oomycetes),<br>
such as Peronospora species, Phytophthora species, Plasmopara viticola and Pseudo-<br>
peronospora species, in particular the corresponding species mentioned above.<br>
The mixtures of the compounds I and II are furthermore suitable for controlling harmful<br>
fungi in the protection of materials (for example wood, paper, paint dispersions, fibers<br><br>
or fabrics) and in the protection of stored products. In the protection of wood, particular<br>
attention is paid to the following harmful fungi: Ascomycetes, such as Ophiostoma spp.,<br>
Ceratocystis spp., Aureobasidium pullulans, Sclerophoma spp., Chaetomium spp.,<br>
Humicola spp., Petriella spp., Trichurus spp.; Basidiomycetes, such as Coniophora<br>
spp., Coriolus spp., Gloeophyllum spp., Lentinus spp., Pleurotus spp., Poria spp.,<br>
Serpula spp. and Tyromyces spp., Deuteromycetes, such as Aspergillus spp.,<br>
Cladosporium spp., Penicillium spp., Trichoderma spp., Altemaria spp., Paecilomyces<br>
spp. and Zygomycetes, such as Mucor spp., additionally in the protection of materials<br>
the following yeasts: Candida spp. and Saccharomyces cerevisae.<br>
The compound I is applied by treating the fungi or the plants, seed, materials or the soil<br>
to be protected against fungal attack with a fungicidally effective amount of the active<br>
compounds. Application can be both before and after the infection of the materials,<br>
plants or seeds by the fungi.<br>
The compound I and active compound II can be applied simultaneously, that is jointly<br>
or separately, or in succession, the sequence, in the case of separate application,<br>
generally not having any effect on the result of the control measures.<br>
The mixtures of the compound I with the active compound II, or the simultaneous, that<br>
is joint orseparate, use of a compound I and the active compound II, also have an<br>
excellent bioregulatory effect on various cultivated plants, such as bananas, cotton,<br>
vegetable species (for example cucumbers, beans, tomatoes and cucurbits), barley,<br>
grass, oats, coffee, potatoes, corn, fruit species, rice, rye, soybeans, grapevines,<br>
wheat, ornamental plants, sugar cane and also on a large number of seeds.<br>
The present invention also provides the use of the mixtures according to the invention<br>
as a bioregulator in a number of different possible applications, for example in the<br>
cultivation of plants, e.g. in agriculture and in horticulture.<br>
Bioregulatory active compounds are capable, for example, of modulating plant growth<br>
(growth regulators).<br>
An example of a bioregulatory application is influencing the elongation of the aerial part<br>
of the plant (growth-regulatory). This extends to virtually all of the developmental<br>
stages of a plant.<br>
Thus, for example, it is possible greatly to inhibit the vegetative growth of the shoot of<br>
plants, which manifests itself in particular in reduced elongation. Accordingly, the<br>
growth of the treated plants is stunted; also, the leaves are darker in color.<br>
Advantageous for practice conditions is a reduced intensity of the growth of grasses on<br>
verges, hedges, canal embankments and on lawned areas such as parks, sports<br><br>
grounds and orchards, ornamental lawns and airports, so that grass cutting, which is<br>
laborious and expensive, can be reduced. Also, more compact growth is desirable in a<br>
number of ornamental species.<br>
Increasing the standing ability of crops which are prone to lodging, such as cereals,<br>
corn, oilseed rape and sunflowers, is also of economic interest. The resultant<br>
shortened and strengthened stem axis reduces or eliminates the danger of "lodging"<br>
(breaking) of plants under adverse weather conditions before harvesting. Another<br>
important aspect is the growth-regulatory application for inhibiting elongation and for<br>
modifying the course of maturation over time in cotton. This makes possible completely<br>
automated harvesting of this crop plant. !n fruit trees and other trees, pruning costs can<br>
be saved by means of growth regulation. At the same time, the ratio which is achieved<br>
between vegetative growth and fruit development is more advantageous. Moreover,<br>
biennial bearing of fruit trees may be avoided by means of growth regulation. Also, the<br>
growth-regulatory application may increase or inhibit lateral branching of the plants.<br>
This is of interest if, for example in tobacco plants, the development of side shoots<br>
(lateral shoots) is to be inhibited in order to favor foliar growth.<br>
Also, frost hardness may be increased substantially by means of growth regulation, for<br>
example in the case of winter oilseed rape. Here, the vegetative development of the<br>
young oilseed rape plants after sowing and before the onset of winter frost is slowed<br>
down despite favorable growth conditions. Elongation and the development of too lush<br>
a foliar or plant biomass (which is therefore particularly sensitive to frost) are inhibited.<br>
Thus, the risk of frost damage to plants which tend toward premature breakdown of<br>
floral inhibition and tend to switch over to the generative phase is also reduced. In other<br>
crops too, for example in winter cereals, it is advantageous for the stands to be well<br>
into the tillering phase in autumn owing to growth-regulatory treatment, but to enter the<br>
cold season without unduly lush growth. This prevents increased sensitivity to subzero<br>
temperatures and - owing to the relatively low quantity of foliar biomass or plant<br>
biomass - attack by a variety of diseases (for example fungal disease). Moreover,<br>
inhibiting the vegetative growth makes possible denser planting of the soil in a number<br>
of crop plants so that higher yields based on the acreage can be achieved.<br>
Moreover, higher yields both in terms of plant parts and in terms of plant constituents<br>
can be achieved by means of growth regulation. Thus, it is possible for example to<br>
induce the growth of larger amounts of buds, flowers, leaves, fruits, seed kernels, roots<br>
and tubers, to increase the sugar content in sugar beet, sugar cane and citrus fruits, to<br>
increase the protein content in cereals or soybeans or to stimulate increased latex flux<br>
in rubber trees. In this context, the active compounds may bring about increased yields<br>
by intervening in the plant metabolism or by promoting or inhibiting the vegetative<br>
and/or the generative growth. Finally, plant growth regulation may also bring about<br><br>
shortened or extended developmental stages or else an acceleration or delay in<br>
maturity of the harvested plant parts pre- or post-harvest.<br>
Of economical interest is, for example, the facilitation of harvesting which is made<br>
possible by the concentration, over time, of the dehiscence or reduced adhesion to the<br>
tree in the case of citrus fruits, olives or in other varieties and cultivars of pome fruit,<br>
stone fruit and shelled fruit. The same mechanism, that is to say the promotion of the<br>
development of abscission tissue between, on the one hand, the fruit or leaf portion<br>
and, on the other hand, the shoot portion of the plants, is also essential for a thoroughly<br>
controlled defoliation of useful plants such as, for example, cotton.<br>
Moreover, growth regulation may bring about a reduction in the water consumption of<br>
plants. This is particulary important in the case of cropped areas which require artificial<br>
irrigation, which requires great financial input, for example in arid or semi-arid zones.<br>
Owing to the plant-regulatory application, the irrigation intensity may be reduced and<br>
farm economics improved. The effect of growth regulators may bring about better<br>
exploitation of the available water since, for example, the degree of stomatal opening is<br>
reduced, a thicker epidermis and cuticula are formed, root penetration into the soil is<br>
improved, the transpiring leaf surface area is reduced, or the microplant climate in the<br>
crop stand is advantageously affected by more compact growth.<br>
The use according to the invention is particularly important for ornamentals, especially<br>
for fruit trees, and in particular for oilseed rape.<br>
In a number of different possible applications in the cultivation of plants both in<br>
agriculature and in horticulture, the use of the mixture according to the invention as a<br>
bioregulator has advantages compared to the individual active compounds. In the<br>
context of the combined application according to the invention, it is possible in<br>
particular to reduce the application rates, required for bioregulation, of the individual<br>
active compounds. In addition, advantageous and especially selected added auxiliaries<br>
frequently provide better biological properties than the sum of the activities of the<br>
individual components in the tank mix method.<br>
A particular subject matter of the present invention is the use of the mixture according<br>
to the invention as a bioregulator for improving root growth. The purpose of this use is<br>
predominantly the development of an increased number of root branches, longer roots<br>
and/or an increased root surface area. This improves the water and nutrient uptake<br>
capacity of the plants. This is advantageous in particular in the case of light, for<br>
example sandy, soils and/or when there is a lack of precipitation. In autumn, a larger<br>
storage root is formed in particular in winter oilseed rape to allow for more intense new<br>
growth in spring. In spring, the improved root system provides better anchorage of the<br>
shoot in the ground so that the plants' standing ability is markedly improved. In other<br><br>
plants, the storage root constitutes all or the major part of the plant organ to be<br>
harvested (for example other Brassicaceae such as radish, but also sugar beet, carrots<br>
or chicory).<br>
Improved root growth is particularly advantageous when this is accompanied by a<br>
reduction of the vegetative growth, that is to say in particular with inhibited shoot<br>
elongation (shortening) and/or reduced foliar biomass or plant biomass. Accordingly,<br>
the present use is advantageously directed at a reduction of the quotient of shoot<br>
biomass to root biomass.<br>
This use, which is directed at the root development, takes place in particular in cereal<br>
production, for example for wheat, barley, oats and rye, also corn and rice, and very<br>
particularly in the case of plants which develop storage roots, such as Brassicacea, for<br>
example radish, predominantly oilseed rape and in particular winter oilseed rape, and<br>
sugar beet, carrots or chicory. Oilseed rape production must be mentioned in particular<br>
in this context; this is where an improved root growth is particularly effective. In<br>
practice, this application, which is directed at the development of roots, may gain<br>
particular importance under specific conditions, for example in the case of relatively dry<br>
soils and/or during the phase in which the plant develops the root system. With a<br>
simultaneous reduction of the shoot elongation, the improved root growth is particularly<br>
advantageous.<br>
The compound I and the active compound II can be applied simultaneously, that is<br>
jointly or separately, or in succession, the sequence, in the case of separate<br>
application, generally not having any effect on the fungicidal and bioregulatory action.<br>
When preparing the mixtures, it is preferred to employ the pure active compounds I and<br>
II, to which further active compounds against harmful fungi or against other pests, such<br>
as insects, arachnids or nematodes, or else herbicidal or further growth-regulating<br>
active compounds or fertilizers can be added.<br>
Usually, mixtures of the compound I and the active compound II are employed.<br>
However, in certain cases mixtures of the compound I with two or, if appropriate, more<br>
active components may be advantageous.<br>
The compound I and the active compound II are usually employed in a weight ratio of<br>
from 100:1 to 1:100, preferably from 20:1 to 1:20, in particular from 10:1 to 1:10.<br>
The further active components are, if desired, added in a ratio of from 20:1 to 1:20 to<br>
the compound I.<br><br>
Depending on the type of compound and the desired effect, the application rates of the<br>
mixtures according to the invention are, especially in the case of areas under<br>
agricultural cultivation, from 5 g/ha, 1750 g/ha, preferably from 10 to 1250 g/ha, in<br>
particular from 20 to 800 g/ha.<br>
Correspondingly, the application rates for the compound I are generally from 1 to<br>
1000 g/ha, preferably from 10 to 750 g/ha, in particular from 20 to 500 g/ha.<br>
Correspondingly, the application rates for the active compound II are generally from 1<br>
to 750 g/ha, preferably from 1 to 500 g/ha, in particular from 1 to 300 g/ha.<br>
In the treatment of seed, application rates of mixture are generally from 1 to<br>
1000 g/100 kg of seed, preferably from 1 to 750 g/100 kg, in particular from 5 to<br>
500g/100kg.<br>
The method for controlling harmful fungi and also for regulating the growth of plants is<br>
carried out by the separate or joint application of the compound I and the active<br>
compound II or a mixture of the compound I and the active compound ll by spraying or<br>
dusting the seeds, the plants or the soil before or after sowing of the plants or before or<br>
after the emergence of the plants.<br>
The mixtures according to the invention, or the compound I and the active compound II<br>
can be converted into the customary formulations, for example solutions, emulsions,<br>
suspensions, dusts, powders, pastes and granules. The use form depends on the<br>
particular intended purpose; in each case, it should ensure a fine and even distribution<br>
of the compound according to the invention.<br>
The formulations are prepared in a known manner, for example by extending the active<br>
compound with solvents and/or carriers, if desired using emulsifiers and dispersants.<br>

In general, the formulations comprise from 0.01 to 95% by weight, preferably from 0.1<br>
to 90% by weight, of the active compounds. The active compounds are employed in a<br>
purity of from 90% to 100%, preferably 95% to 100% (according to NMR spectrum).<br>
The following are examples of formulations:   1. Products for dilution with water<br>
A)     Water-soluble concentrates (SL)<br>
10 parts by weight of a compound according to the invention are dissolved in 90 parts<br>
by weight of water or of a water-soluble solvent. As an alternative, wetting agents or<br><br>
other auxiliaries are added. The active compound dissolves upon dilution with water.<br>
This gives a formulation having an active compound content of 10% by weight.<br>
B)	Dispersible concentrates (DC)<br>
20 parts by weight of a compound according to the invention are dissolved in 70 parts<br>
by weight of cyclohexanone with addition of 10 parts by weight of a dispersant, for<br>

25 parts by weight of a compound according to the invention are dissolved in 35 parts<br>
by weight of xylene with addition of calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate and castor oil<br>
ethoxylate (in each case 5 parts by weight). This mixture is introduced into 30 parts by<br>
weight of water by means of an emulsifying machine (e.g. Ultraturrax) and made into a<br>
homogeneous emulsion. Dilution with water gives ah emulsion. The formulation has an<br>
active compound content of 25% by weight.<br>
E)	Suspensions (SC, OD)<br>
In an agitated ball mill, 20 parts by weight of a compound according to the invention are<br>
comminuted with addition of 10 parts by weight of dispersants and wetting agents and<br>
70 parts by weight of water or an organic solvent to give a fine active compound<br>

addition of 50 parts by weight of dispersants and wetting agents and prepared as<br>
water-dispersible or water-soluble granules by means of technical appliances (for<br>
example extrusion, spray tower, fluidized bed). Dilution with water gives a stable<br>
dispersion or solution of the active compound. The formulation has an active<br>
compound content of 50% by weight.<br>

mixed intimately with 95 parts by weight of finely divided kaolin. This gives a dustable<br>
product having an active compound content of 5% by weight.<br>
J)      Granules (GR, FG, GG, MG)<br>
0.5 part by weight of a compound according to the invention is ground finely and<br>
associated with 99.5 parts by weight of carriers. Current methods are extrusion, spray-<br>
drying or the fluidized bed. This gives granules to be applied undiluted having an active<br>
compound content of 0.5% by weight.<br>
K)     ULV solutions (UL)<br>
10 parts by weight of a compound according to the invention are dissolved in 90 parts<br>
by weight of an organic solvent, for example xylene. This gives a product to be applied<br>
undiluted having an active compound content of 10% by weight.<br>
The active compounds can be used as such, in the form of their formulations or the use<br>
forms prepared therefrom, for example in the form of directly sprayable solutions,<br>
powders, suspensions or dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes, dustable<br>
products, materials for spreading, or granules, by means of spraying, atomizing,<br>
dusting, spreading or pouring. The use forms depend entirely on the intended<br>
purposes; they are intended to ensure in each case the finest possible distribution of<br>
the active compounds according to the invention.<br>
Aqueous use forms can be prepared from emulsion concentrates, pastes or wettable<br>
powders (sprayable powders, oil dispersions) by adding water. To prepare emulsions,<br>
pastes or oil dispersions, the substances, as such or dissolved in an oil or solvent, can<br>
be homogenized in water by means of a wetting agent, tackifier, dispersant or<br>
emulsifier. However, it is also possible to prepare concentrates composed of active<br>
substance, wetting agent, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier and, if appropriate, solvent<br>
or oil, and such concentrates are suitable for dilution with water.<br>
The active compound concentrations in the ready-to-use preparations can be varied<br>
within relatively wide ranges. In general, they are from 0.0001 to 10%, preferably from<br>
0.01 to 1%.<br><br>
The active compounds may also be used successfully in the ultra-low-volume process<br>
(ULV), it being possible thereby to apply formulations comprising over 95% by weight<br>
of active compound, or even to apply the active compound without additives.<br>
Oils of various types, wetting agents, adjuvants may be added to the active<br>
compounds, even, if appropriate, not until immediately prior to use (tank mix). These<br>
agents are typically admixed with the compositions according to the invention in a<br>
weight ratio of from 1:100 to 100:1, preferably from 1:10 to 10:1.<br>
The compounds I and II, or the mixtures or the corresponding formulations are applied<br>
by treating the harmful fungi, the plants, seeds, soils, areas, materials or spaces to be<br>
kept free from them with a fungicidally effective amount of the mixture or, in the case of<br>
separate application, with the compounds I and II. Application can be carried out before<br>
or after infection by the harmful fungi.<br>
The fungicidal effect of the individual compounds and the mixtures according to the<br>
invention was demonstrated by the following tests:<br>
The active compounds were prepared separately or jointly as a stock solution with<br>
25 mg of active compound which was made up to 10 ml using a mixture of acetone<br>
and/or DMSO and the emulsifier Uniperol® EL (wetting agent having emulsifying and<br>
dispersing action based on ethoxylated alkylphenols) in a volume ratio of<br>
solvent/emulsifier of 99 to 1. The mixture was then made up to 100 ml with water. This<br>
stock solution was diluted with the solvent/emulsifier/water mixture described to the<br>
concentration of active compounds stated below.<br>
The visually determined percentages of infected leaf areas or the measured elongation<br>
were converted into efficacies in % of the untreated control:<br>
The efficacy (E) is calculated as follows using Abbot's formula:<br>
E = (1-?/ß)-100<br>
a      corresponds to the fungicidal infection of the treated plants in % and<br>
(3      corresponds to the fungicidal infection of the untreated (control) plants in %<br>
An efficacy of 0 means that the degree of infection of the treated plants or the<br>
measured elongation corresponds to that of the untreated control plants; an efficacy of<br>
100 means that the treated plants were not infected or that the treated plants showed<br>
no elongation.<br><br>
The expected efficacies of mixtures of active compounds were determined using<br>
Colby's formula (Colby, S.R. "Calculating synergistic and antagonistic responses of<br>
herbicide combinations", Weeds, 15, pp. 20-22,1967) and compared with the observed<br>
efficacies.<br>
Colby's formula:<br>
E = x + y-x.y/100<br>
E      expected efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control, when using the<br>
mixture of the active compounds A and B at the concentrations a and b<br>
x       efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control, when using the active<br>
compound A at the concentration a<br>
y       efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control, when using the active<br>
compound B at the concentration b<br>
Use Example 1 - Curative activity against brown rust of wheat caused by Puccinia<br>
recondita (Puccrt K1)<br>
Leaves of potted wheat seedlings of the cultivar "Kanzler" were inoculated with a spore<br>
suspension of brown rust (Puccinia recondita). The pots were then placed in a chamber<br>
with high atmospheric humidity (90 to 95%) at 20 to 22°C for 24 hours. During this time,<br>
the spores germinated and the germ tubes penetrated into the leaf tissue. The next<br>
day, the infected plants were sprayed to run off point with the active compound solution<br>
described above at the active compound concentration stated below. After the spray<br>
coating had dried on, the test plants were cultivated in a greenhouse at temperatures<br>
between 20 and 22°C and 65 to 70% relative atmospheric humidity for 7 days. The<br>
extent of the rust fungus development on the leaves was then determined.<br>
The visually determined values for the percentage of infected leaf area were initially<br>
converted into a mean value and then converted into efficacies in % of the untreated<br>
control. An efficacy of 0 means the same degree of infection as in the untreated<br>
control, an efficacy of 100 means 0% infection. The expected efficacies for active<br>
compound combinations were determined using Colby's formula (Colby, S. R.<br>
"Calculating synergistic and antagonistic responses of herbicide Combinations",<br>
Weeds, 15, pp. 20-22,1967) and compared to the observed efficacies.<br>
The active compound epoxiconazole was used as a commercial formulation.<br><br><br>
Use Example 2 - Activity against mildew of wheat caused by Erysiphe [syn. Blumeria]<br>
graminis forma specialis. tritici (Erysgt P1)<br>
Leaves of potted wheat seedlings were sprayed to run off point with an aqueous suspension<br>
having the active compound concentrations stated below. The suspension or emulsion had<br>
been prepared as described above. 24 hours after the spray coating had dried on, the plants<br>
were dusted with spores of mildew of wheat (Erysiphe [syn. Blumeria] graminis forma<br>
specialis. tritici). The test plants were then placed in a greenhouse at temperatures between<br>
20 and 24°C and at 60 to 90% relative atmospheric humidity. After 7 days, the extent of the<br>
mildew development was determined visually in % infection of the entire leaf area<br>
The visually determined values for the percentage of infected leaf area were initially<br>
converted into a mean value and then converted into efficacies in % of the untreated control.<br>
An efficacy of 0 means the same degree of infection as in the untreated control, an efficacy<br>
of 100 means 0% infection. The expected efficacies for active compound combinations were<br>
determined using Colby's formula (Colby, S. R. "Calculating synergistic and antagonistic<br>
responses of herbicide Combinations", Weeds, 15, pp. 20-22,1967) and compared to the<br>
observed efficacies.<br><br><br>
