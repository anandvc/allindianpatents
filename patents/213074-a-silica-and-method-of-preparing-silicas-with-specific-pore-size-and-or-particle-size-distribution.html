METHOD OF PREPARING SILICAS, SILICAS WITH SPECIFIC<br>
PORE-SIZE AND/OR PARTICLE-SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS, AND THE<br>
USES THEREOF, IN PARTICULAR FOR REINFORCING POLYMERS<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for preparing silica, to silicas having a particular particle size distribution and/or a particular pore distribution, especially in the form of powder, of approximately spherical beads or of granules, and to their applications, such as the reinforcement of polymers.<br>
It is known to employ white reinforcing fillers in polymers, particularly in elastomers, such as for example precipitated silica.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide, in particular, an alternative filler for polymer compositions, having a typical characteristics, also providing them with a highly satisfactory compromise of properties, in particular as regards their mechanical and dynamic properties, without impairing their rheological properties.<br>
The invention firstly provides a novel process for preparing silica, of the type comprising the reaction of a silicate with an  acidifying agent whereby a silica suspension is obtained, followed by the separation and the drying of this suspension,<br><br>
characterized in that the reaction of the silicate with the acidifying agent is carried out according to the following successive steps:<br>
(i) an aqueous stock having a pH of between 2 and 5 is formed;<br>
(ii) silicate and acidifying agent are added simultaneously to the said stock in such a way that the pH of the reaction mixture is maintained between 2 and<br>
5;<br>
(iii) the addition of the acidifying agent is stopped, while continuing to add silicate into the reaction mixture until a pH value of the reaction mixture of between 7 and 10 is obtained;<br>
(iv) silicate and acidifying agent are added simultaneously to the reaction mixture in such a way that the pH of the reaction mixture is maintained between 7 and 10; and<br>
(v) the addition of the silicate is stopped, while continuing to add the acidifying agent into the reaction mixture until a pH value of the reaction mixture of less than 6 is obtained-<br>
Thus, it has been found that the succession of particular steps, in particular the presence of a first simultaneous addition of acidifying agent and silicate in an acid medium at pH between 2 and 5 and of a second simultaneous addition of acidifying agent and silicate in a basic medium of pH between 7 and 10, constitute<br><br>
important conditions for giving the products obtained their particular characteristics and properties.<br>
The acidifying agent and the silicate are chosen in a manner well known per se.<br>
As acidifying agent, a strong mineral acid, such as sulphuric acid, nitric acid or hydrochloric acid, or an organic acid, such as acetic acid, formic acid or carbonic acid, will in general be used*<br>
The acidifying agent may be dilute or concentrated; its normality may be between 0*4 and 36N, for example between 0.6 and 1.5N.<br>
In particular, in the case in which the acidifying agent is sulphuric acid, its concentration may be between 40 and 180 g/1, for example between 60 and 130 g/1.<br>
However, as silicate, it is possible to use any standard form of silicates such as metasilicates, disilicates and, advantageously, an alkali metal silicate, especially sodium or potassium silicate.<br>
The silicate may have a concentration (expressed as Si02 content) of between 40 and 330 g/1, for example between 60 and 300 g/1, in particular between 60 and 260 g/1.<br>
In general, sulphuric acid will generally be employed as the acidifying agent, and sodium silicate as silicate.<br><br>
If sodium silicate is used, this is generally present with an Si02/Na20 weight ratio of between 2.5 and 4, for example between 3.2 and 3.8.<br>
With regard more particularly to the preparation process of the invention, the reaction between the silicate and the acidifying agent takes place in a very specific manner according to the following steps.<br>
Firstly, an aqueous stock having a pH of between 2 and 5 is formed.<br>
Preferably, the stock formed has a pH of between 2.5 and 5, especially between 3 and 4.5; this pH is, for example, between 3.5 and 4.5.<br>
This initial stock may be obtained by addition of acidifying agent to water so as to obtain a pH value of the stock between 2 and 5, preferably between 2*5 and 5, especially between 3 and 4,5, and for example between 3.5 and 4.5.<br>
It may also be obtained by addition of acidifying agent to a water + silicate mixture so as to obtain this pH value.<br>
It may also be prepared by addition of acidifying agent to a stock containing preformed silica particles at a pH of less than 7, so as to obtain a pH value between 2 and 5, preferably between 2.5 and 5, especially between 3 and 4.5 and for example between 3.5 and 4.5.<br><br>
The stock formed in step (i) may optionally include an electrolyte. However, it is preferable for no electrolyte to be added during the preparation process, in particular in step (i).<br>
The term "electrolyte" is understood here in its normally accepted meaning, that is to say it means any ionic or molecular substance which, when it is in solution, decomposes or dissociates to form ions or charged particles. As electrolyte, mention may be made of a salt of the group of alkali-metal and alkaline-earth metal salts, especially the salt of the metal of the initial silicate and of the acidifying agent, for example sodium chloride in the case of the reaction of a sodium silicate with hydrochloric acid or, preferably, sodium sulphate in the case of the reaction of a sodium silicate with sulphuric acid.<br>
The second step (step (ii)) consists of a simultaneous addition of acidifying agent and of silicate in such a way (in particular with such flow rates) that the pH of the reaction mixture is maintained between 2 and 5, preferably between .2.5 and 5, especially between 3 and 4,5, for example between 3 , 5 and 4.5.<br>
This simultaneous addition is advantageously carried out in such a way that the pH value of the reaction mixture is always equal (to within ± 0-2) to that reached at the end of the initial step (i).<br><br>
Next, in a step (iii), the addition of the acidifying agent is stopped, while continuing to add silicate into the reaction mixture so as to obtain a pH value of the reaction mixture of between 7 and 10, preferably between 7.5 and 9.5.<br>
It may then be advantageous for the reaction mixture, just after this step (iii) and therefore just after the addition of silicate has been stopped, to undergo a maturing step, especially at the pH obtained after step (iii), and in general with stirring; this maturing step may, for example, last 2 to 45 minutes, in particular from 5 to 25 minutes, and preferably includes neither addition of acidifying agent nor addition of silicate.<br>
After step (iii) and the optional maturing step, acidifying agent and silicate are again simultaneously added in such a manner (in particular with such flow rates) that the pH of the reaction mixture is maintained between 7 and 10, preferably between 7.5 and 9 - 5.<br>
This second simultaneous addition (step (iv)) is advantageously carried out in such a way that the pH value of the reaction mixture is always equal (to within ± 0.2) to that achieved after the preceding step.<br>
It should be noted that it is possible, between step (ii) and step (iv), for example between, on the<br><br>
one hand, the optional maturing step following step (iii) and, on the other hand, step (iv), to add acidifying agent to the reaction mixture, the pH of the reaction mixture after this addition of acidifying agent being, however, between 7 and 9.5, preferably between 7.5 and 9,5.<br>
Finally, in a step (v), the addition of the silicate is stopped, while continuing to add acidifying agent into the reaction mixture so as to obtain a pH value of the reaction mixture of less than 6, preferably between 3 and 5.5, in particular between 3 and 5, for example between 3 and 4,5.<br>
It may then be advantageous, after this step (v) and therefore just after stopping the addition of acidifying agent, for the reaction mixture to undergo a maturing step, especially at the pH obtained after step (v), and in general with stirring; this maturing step may last, for example, from 2 to 45 minutes, in particular from 5 to 20 minutes, and preferably includes no addition of acidifying agent nor addition of silicate.<br>
The reaction vessel in which the entire reaction between the silicate and the acidifying agent takes place is usually fitted with suitable stirring equipment and with suitable heating equipment.<br><br>
The entire reaction between the silicate and the acidifying agent is generally carried out between 70 and 95°C, in particular between 75 and 90°C.<br>
According to a variant of the invention, the entire reaction between the silicate and the acidifying agent is carried out at a constant temperature, usually between 70 and 95°C, in particular between 75 and 90°C<br>
According to another variant of the invention, the temperature at the end of the reaction is higher than the temperature at the start of the reaction: thus, the temperature at the start of the reaction is preferably maintained (for example during steps (i) to (iii)) at between 70 and 85°C, ..and then the temperature is increased, preferably up to a value between 85 and 95 °C, at which value it is maintained (for example during steps (iv) and (v)) until the end of the reaction.<br>
After the steps that have just been described, a silica slurry is obtained, which is then separated (by liquid-solid separation).<br>
The separation used in the preparation process according to the invention usually comprises filtration followed, if necessary, by washing. The filtration is carried out using any suitable method, for example by means of a filter press, a band filter or a vacuum filter.<br><br>
The silica suspension thus recovered (the filter cake) is then dried.<br>
This drying may be carried out using any means known per se.<br>
Preferably, the drying is spray drying. For this purpose, any suitable type of spray dryer may be used, especially a turbine, nozzle, liquid-pressure or two-fluid type spray dryer. In general, when the filtration is carried out by means of a filter press, a nozzle spray dryer is used, and when the filtration is carried out by means of a vacuum filter, a turbine spray dryer is used.<br>
It should be noted that the filter cake is not always under conditions allowing spray drying, especially because of its high viscosity. In a manner known per se, the cake is then subjected to a disintegration operation. This operation may be carried out mechanically, by passing the cake through a colloidal-type mill or a ball mill. The disintegration is generally carried out in the presence of an aluminium compound, in particular sodium aluminate, and optionally in the presence of an acidifying agent, as described above (in the latter case, the aluminium compound and the acidifying agent are generally added simultaneously). The disintegration operation makes it possible in particular to lower the viscosity of the suspension to be subsequently dried.<br><br>
When the drying is carried out by means of a nozzle spray dryer, the silica that can then be obtained is usually in the form of approximately spherical beads.<br>
After the drying, a milling step may then be carried out on the recovered product- The silica that can then be obtained is generally in the form of a powder.<br>
When the drying is carried out by means of a turbine spray dryer, the silica that can then be obtained may be in the form of a powder.<br>
Finally, the product, dried (especially by a turbine spray dryer) or milled as indicated above, may optionally be subjected to an agglomeration step which consists, for example, of direct compression, wet granulation (that is to say with the use of a binder such as water, a silica suspension, etc.)/ extrusion or, preferably, dry compacting. When the latter technique is used, it may prove opportune, before carrying out the compacting operation, for the pulverulent products to undergo de-aeration (an operation also called predensification or degassing) so as to remove the air included in the products and to ensure that they are more uniformly compacted.<br>
The silica that can then be obtained by this agglomeration step is generally in the form of granules -<br><br>
The silica powders, like the silica beads, obtained by the process according to the invention thus offer the advantage inter alia  of obtaining granules in a simple, effective and economic manner, especially by conventional forming operations, such as for example granulation or compacting, without these operations causing any degradation liable to mask, or even destroy, the good intrinsic properties that these powders or these beads have, as may be the case in the prior art when processing conventional powders.<br>
The preparation process according to the invention makes it possible in particular to obtain silicas more of the precipitative-silica type which, on the one hand, are highly structured and non-friable and, on the other hand, generally have a high dispersibility in polymers, give the latter a very satisfactory compromise of properties, in particular as regards their dynamic and mechanical properties (especially a good reinforcing effect and very good abrasion resistance), without impairing their rheological properties- The silicas obtained preferably have a particular particle size distribution and/or pore distribution.<br>
The silicas that can be obtained by the process of the invention constitute one of the aspects of the present invention.<br><br>
Further objects of the invention consist of novel silicas, more of the precipitated-silica type, which are highly structured and possess a specific particle size distribution and/or a particular pore distribution; furthermore, they generally have good dispersibility in polymers, give the latter a very satisfactory compromise of properties, in particular as regards their dynamic properties (especially a reduction in the strain energy dissipation (low Payne effect), low hysteresis losses at high temperature (especially a reduction in tanS at 60°C) without impairing their rheological properties (and therefore without impairing their processability/formability (for example, a lower green viscosity for the same specific surface area)) and possess good mechanical properties, in particular a good reinforcing effect, especially in terms of moduli, and very good abrasion resistance, hence improved wear resistance in the case of finished articles based on the said polymers.<br>
In the description that follows, the BET specific surface area is determined using the Brunauer-Emmet-Teller method described in "The Journal of the American Chemical Society", Vol. 60, page 309, February 1938 and corresponding to the International Standard ISO 5794/1 (Appendix D).<br><br>
The CTAB specific surface area is the external surface area determined according to the NF T 45007 (November 1987) (5.12) standard.<br>
The DOP oil uptake is determined according to the NF T 30-022 (March 1953) standard using dioctyl phthalate.<br>
The pH is measured according to the ISO 787/9 standard (the pH of a 5% suspension in water).<br>
The XDC particle size analysis method, using centrifugal sedimentation, by which, on the one' hand, the size distribution widths of silica objects and, on the other hand, the XDC mode illustrating its size of objects were measured, is described below.<br>

Results<br>
In the apparatus register, record the values of the 16 wt%, 50 wt% (or median) and 84 wt% let-through diameters and the value of the mode (the derivative of the cumulative particle size curve gives a frequency curve the abscissa of the maximum of which (abscissa of the main population) is called the mode).<br>
The size distribution width Ld of objects, measured by XDC particle size analysis, after ultrasonic disintegration (in water), corresponds to the (d84 ~ dl6)/d50 ratio in which dn is the size for which n% of particles (by weight) have a size smaller than that size (the distribution width Ld is therefore calculated from the cumulative particle size curve taken in its entirety).<br>
The size distribution width L'd of objects smaller than 500 nm, measured by XDC particle size analysis, after ultrasonic disintegration (in water), corresponds to the (d84 - dl6)/d50 ratio in which dn is the size for which n% of particles (by weight), with respect to the particles smaller in size than 500 nm, have a size smaller than that size (the distribution<br><br>
width L'd is therefore calculated from the cumulative particle size curve truncated above 500 nm). In addition, using this centrifugal sedimentation XDC particle size analysis method, it is possible to measure a weight-average size of the particles (that is to say of the secondary particles or aggregates), denoted dw, after dispersion, by ultrasonic disintegration, of the silica in water- The method differs from that described above by the fact that the suspension formed (silica + deionized water) is disintegrated, on the one hand, for 8 minutes and, on the other hand, using a 1500 watt 1.9 cm VIBRACELL ultrasonic probe (sold by Bioblock) (the probe being used at 60% of maximum power). After analysis (sedimentation for 120 minutes), the weight distribution of particle sizes is calculated by the software of the particle size analyser. The weight-average geometrical mean of the particle sizes (Xg according to the nomenclature of the software), denoted dw, is calculated by the software from the following equation:<br><br>
of the objects in the class of size di.<br>
The pore volumes given are measured by mercury porosimetry; each specimen is prepared as follows: each specimen is predried for 2 hours in an oven at 200°C and then placed in a test container within 5 minutes<br><br>
following its removal from the oven and vacuum-degassed, for example using a rotary vane pump; the pore diameters (AUTOPORE III 9420 Micromeritics porosimeter) are calculated by the Washburn equation with a contact angle 9 of 140° and a surface tension y of 484 dynes/cm (or N/m).<br>
Vtd5 - dso) represents the pore volume formed by the pores of diameters between d5 and d50 and V(d5 - dioo) represents the pore volume formed by the pores of diameters between d5 and dlOO, dn here being the pore diameter for which n% of the total surface area of all the pores is formed by the pores of diameter greater than that diameter (the total surface area of the pores (So) may be determined from the mercury intrusion curve).<br>
The pore distribution width ldp is obtained by the pore distribution curve, as indicated in Figure 1, i.e. the pore volume (in ml/g) as a function of the pore diameter (in nm) : the coordinates of the point S corresponding to the principal population, namely the values of the diameter Xs (in nm) and the pore volume Ys (in ml/g), are recorded; a straight line of the equation Y = Ys/2 is plotted; this straight line cuts the pore distribution curve at two points A and B on either side of Xs, the abscissae (in nm) of points A and B being XA and XB, respectively; the pore distribution width pdw is equal to the ratio (XA - XB)/XS.<br><br>
In some cases, the dispersibility (and disintegratability) of the silicas according to the invention may be quantified by means of specific disintegration tests.<br>
One of the disintegration tests is carried out according to the following protocol:<br>
The cohesion of the agglomerates is assessed by a particle size measurement (using laser diffraction) carried out on a suspension of silica ultrasonically disintegrated beforehand; in this way, the disintegratability of the silica (the break-up of objects from 0.1 to a few tens of microns) is measured. The ultrasonic disintegration is carried out using a Bioblock Vibracell sonifier (600 W) fitted with a 19 mm diameter probe. The particle size measurement is carried out by laser diffraction on a SYMPATEC particle size analyser.<br>
Weighed in a pillbox (height: 6 cm and diameter: 4 cm) are 2 grams of silica to which 50 grams of deionized water are added: an aqueous suspension containing 4% silica, which is homogenized for 2 minutes by magnetic stirring, is thus produced. Next, the ultrasonic disintegration is carried out as follows: with the probe immersed over a length of 4 cm, the output power is adjusted so as to obtain a deflection of the needle of the power dial indicating 20%. The disintegration is carried out for 420 seconds.<br><br>
Next, the particle size measurement is taken after a known volume (expressed in ml) of the homogenized suspension has been introduced into the container of the particle size analyser.<br>
The value of the median diameter 05Os (or Sympatec median diameter) that is obtained is smaller the higher the disintegratability of the silica. It is also possible to determine the (10 x volume of suspension (in ml) introduced)/(optical density of the suspension detected by the particle size analyser) ratio may also be determined (this optical density is around 20). This ratio is indicative of the content of particles of a size of less than 0,1 µm, which particles are not detected by the particle size analyser. This ratio is called the ultrasonic Sympatec disintegration factor (FDS) .<br>
Another disintegration test is carried out according to the following protocol:<br>
The cohesion of the agglomerates is assessed by a particle size measurement (using laser diffraction) carried out on a suspension of silica ultrasonically disintegrated beforehand; in this way, the disintegrability of the silica (break-up of objects from 0,1 to a few tens of microns) is measured. The ultrasonic disintegration is carried out using a Bioblock VIBRACELL sonifier (600 W), used at 80% of maximum power, fitted with a 19 mm diameter probe. The<br><br>
particle size measurement is carried out by laser diffraction on a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 particle size analyser.<br>
1 gram of silica is weighed in a pillbox (height: 6 cm and diameter: 4 cm) and deionized water is added to bring the weight to 50 grams: an aqueous suspension containing 2% silica, which is homogenized for 2 minutes by magnetic stirring, is thus produced. Ultrasonic disintegration is then carried out for 420 seconds. Next, the particle size measurement is taken after all of the homogenized suspension has been introduced into the container of the particle size analyser.<br>
The value of the median diameter Ø50M (or Malvern median diameter) that is obtained is smaller the higher the disintegratability of the silica. It is also possible to determine the (10 x blue laser obscuration value)/(red laser obscuration value) ratio. This ratio is indicative of the content of particles smaller in size than 0.1 µm. This ratio is called the Malvern ultrasonic disintegration factor (FDM).<br>
A disintegration rate, denoted a, may be measured by means of another ultrasonic disintegration test, at 100% power of a 600 watt probe, operating in pulsed mode (i.e.: on for 1 second/off for 1 second) so as to prevent the ultrasonic probe from heating up excessively during the measurement. This known test,<br><br>
forming the subject matter for example of Application WO 99/28376 (see also Applications WO 99/28380, WO 00/73372 and WO 00/73373), allows the variation in the volume-average size of the particle agglomerates to be continuously measured during Bonification, according to the indications given below. The set-up used consists of a laser particle size analyser (of the MASTERSIZER S type sold by Malvern Instruments: He-Ne laser source emitting in the red at a wavelength of 632.8 nm) and of its preparation station (Malvern Small Sample Unit MSX1), between which a continuous flux stream treatment cell (Bioblock M72410) fitted with an ultrasonic probe (600 watt VIBRACELL-type 12,7 mm sonifier sold by Bioblock) was inserted- A small quantity (150 mg) of silica to be analysed is introduced with 160 ml of water into the preparation station, the rate of circulation being set at its maximum. At least three consecutive measurements are carried out in order to determine, using the known Fraunhofer calculation method (Malvern 3$$D calculation matrix), the initial volume-average diameter of the agglomerates, denoted dv[0]. Sonification (pulsed mode: on for 1 s/off for 1 s) is then applied at 100% power (i.e. 100% of the maximum position of the tip amplitude) and the variation in the volume-average diameter dv[t] as a function of time t is monitored for about 8 minutes, a measurement being taken<br><br>
approximately every 10 seconds. After an induction period (about 3-4 minutes), it is observed that the inverse of the volume-average diameter l/dv[t] varies linearly, or substantially linearly, with time t (disintegration steady state). The rate of disintegration a is calculated by linear regression from the curve of variation of l/dv[t] as a function of time t in the disintegration steady state region (in general, between 4 and 8 minutes approximately); it is expressed in fxm~1.min~1.<br>
The aforementioned Application WO 99/28376 describes in detail a measurement device that can be used for carrying out this ultrasonic disintegration test. This device consists of a closed circuit in which a stream of particle agglomerates in suspension in a liquid can circulate. This device essentially comprises a specimen preparation station, a laser particle size analyser and a treatment cell. Setting to atmospheric pressure, within the specimen preparation station and the actual treatment cell, makes it possible for the air bubbles that form during sonification (i.e. the action of the ultrasonic probe) to be continuously removed. The specimen preparation station (Malvern Small Sample Unit MSXlj is designed to receive the silica specimen to be tested (in suspension in the liquid) and to make it circulate around the circuit at the preset speed (potentiometer - maximum speed about<br><br>
3 1/min) in the form of a stream of liquid suspension. This preparation station simply consists of a receiving container which contains the suspension to be analysed and through which the said suspension flows. It is equipped with a variable-speed stirring motor so as to prevent any sedimentation of the particle agglomerates of the suspension, a centrifuge mini-pump is designed to circulate the suspension in the circuit; the inlet of the preparation station is connected to the open air via an opening intended to receive the charge specimen to be tested and/or the liquid used for the suspension. Connected to the preparation station is a laser particle size analyser (MASTERSIZER S) whose function is to continuously measure, at regular time intervals, the volume-average size dv of the agglomerates, as the stream passes, by a measurement cell to which the recording means and the automatic calculation means of the particle size analyser are coupled. It will be briefly recalled here that laser particle size analysers make use, in a known manner, of the principle of light diffraction by solid objects in suspension in a medium whose refractive index is different from that of the solid. According to the Fraunhofer theory, there is a relationship between the size of the object and the angle of diffraction of the light (the smaller the object the larger the angle of diffraction). In practice, all that is required is to measure the<br><br>
quantity of diffracted light for various angles of diffraction in order to be able to determine the size distribution (by volume) of the specimen, dv corresponding to the volume-average size of this distribution dv ~ 2(nidi4) /2(nidi3) where m is the number of objects of the class of size or diameter di) . Finally, a treatment cell fitted with an ultrasonic probe is inserted between the preparation station and the laser particle size analyser, the said cell being able to operate in continuous or pulsed mode and intended to continuously break up the particle agglomerates as the stream passes. This stream is thermostatically controlled by means of a cooling circuit placed, within the cell, in a jacket surrounding the probe, the temperature being controlled, for example, by a temperature probe immersed in the liquid within the preparation station.<br>
The Sears number is determined using the method described by G. w. Sears in the article in Analytical Chemistry, Vol. 28, No, 12, December 1956 entitled "Determination  of specific surface area  of colloidal silica by titration with  sodium hydroxide".<br>
The Sears number is the volume of 0.1M sodium hydroxide solution needed to raise the pH of a 10 g/1 silica suspension in a 200 g/1 sodium chloride medium from 4 to 9.<br><br>
To do this, 400 grams of sodium chloride are used to prepare a 200 g/1 sodium chloride solution acidified to pH 3 with a 1M hydrochloric acid solution* The weighings are performed by means of a Mettler precision balance- 150 ml of this sodium chloride solution are delicately added to a 250 ml beaker into which a mass M (in g) of the specimen to be analysed, corresponding to 1.5 grams of dry silica, has been introduced beforehand. Ultrasound is applied for 8 minutes to the dispersion obtained (Branson 1500 W ultrasonic probe; 60% amplitude, 13 mm diameter), the beaker being in an ice-filled crystallizer. The solution obtained is then homogenized by magnetic stirring, using a bar magnet having dimensions of 25 mm x 5 mm. A check is made that the pH of the suspension is less than 4, if necessary by adjusting it using a 1M hydrochloric acid solution. Next, a 0.1M sodium hydroxide solution is added at a rate of 2 ml/min by means of a Metrohm titrator pH meter (672 Titroprocessor, 655 Dosimat) precalibrated using pH 7 and pH 4 buffer solutions. (The titrator pH meter was programmed as follows: 1) Call up the "Get pH" program and 2) Introduce the following parameters: pause (wait time before the start of titration): 3 s; reactant flow rate: 2 ml/min; anticipation (adaptation of the titration rate to the slope of the pH curve): 30; stop pH: 9,40; critical EP (sensitivity of detection of the<br><br>
equivalence point): 3; report (parameters for printing the titration report): 2, 3 and 5 (i.e. creation of a detailed report, list of measurement points and titration curve)). The exact volumes V1 and V2 of sodium hydroxide solution added in order to obtain a pH of 4 and a pH of 9, respectively, are determined by interpolation- The Sears number for 1.5 grams of dry silica is equal to ((V2 - V1) x 150) / (SC x M), where:<br>
V1: volume of 0.1M sodium hydroxide solution at pH1 = 4;<br>
V2: volume of 0.1M sodium hydroxide solution at PH2 = 9;<br>
M: mass of the specimen (in g);<br>
SC: solids content (in %). The pore distribution width may possibly be also illustrated by the parameter W/FI determined by mercury porosimetry. The measurement is carried out using PASCAL 140 and PASCAL 440 porosimeters sold by ThermoFinnigan, operating in the following manner: a quantity of specimen between 50 and 500 mg (in the present case 140 mg) is introduced into a measurement cell. This measurement cell is installed in the measurement unit of the PASCAL 140 apparatus. The specimen is then vacuum-degassed for the time needed to achieve a pressure of 0-01 kPa (typically around 10 minutes). The measurement cell is then filled with mercury. The first part of the mercury intrusion curve<br><br>
Vp = f(P), where Vp is the mercury intrusion volume and P is the applied pressure, for pressures of less than 400 kPa, is determined using the PASCAL 140 porosimeter. The measurement cell is then installed in the measurement unit of the PASCAL 440 porosimeter, the second part of the mercury intrusion curve Vp = f(P) for pressures between 100 kPa and 400 MPa being determined using the PASCAL 440 porosimeter. The porosimeters are used in PASCAL mode so as to permanently adjust the rate of mercury intrusion according to the variations in the intrusion volume. The rate parameter in PASCAL mode is set to 5. The pore radii Rp are calculated from the pressure values P using the Washburn equation, assuming that the pores are cylindrical, choosing a contact angle 9 of 140° and a surface tension y °f 480 dynes/cm (or N/m) * The pore volumes Vp are relative to the mass of silica introduced and are expressed in cm3/g. The signal Vp = f(Rp) is smoothed by combining a logarithmic filter ("smooth dumping factor" filter parameter F = 0,96) and a moving-average filter ("number of points to average" filter parameter f = 20). The pore size distribution is obtained by calculating the derivative dVp/dRp of the smooth intrusion curve. The fineness index FI is the pore radius value (expressed in crngstroms) corresponding to the maximum of the pore<br><br>
size distribution dVp/dRp. The mid-height width of the pore size distribution dVp/dRp is denoted by w.<br>
The number of silanols per nm2 of surface area is determined by grafting methanol onto the surface of the silica. Firstly, 1 gram of raw silica is put into suspension in 10 ml of methanol, in a 110 ml autoclave (Top Industrie, reference 09990009). A bar magnet is introduced and the autoclave, hermetically sealed and thermally insulated, is heated to 200°C (40 bar) on a magnetic stirrer, heating for 4 hours. The autoclave is then cooled in a cold water bath. The grafted silica is recovered by settling and the residual methanol is evaporated in a stream of nitrogen. Finally, the grafted silica is vacuum dried for 12 hours at 130°C, The carbon content is determined by an elemental analyser (NCS 2500 analyser from CE Instruments) on the raw silica and on the grafted silica. This quantitative determination is carried out on the grafted silica within the three days following the end of drying -this is because the humidity of the air or heat may cause hydrolysis of the methanol grafting. The number of silanols per nm2 is then calculated using the following formula:<br><br>
where %Cg: per cent mass of carbon present on the grafted silica;<br><br>
%Cr: per cent mass of carbon present on the raw silica;<br>

The silicas according to the invention are preferably prepared by the preparation process according to the invention and described above.<br>
The silicas according to the invention or those prepared by the process according to the invention find particularly useful application in the reinforcement of natural or synthetic polymers.<br>
The polymer compositions in which they are used, especially as reinforcing filler, are in general based on one or more polymers or copolymers, in particular one or more elastomers, especially thermoplastic elastomers, preferably having at least one glass transition temperature between -150 and +300°C, for example between -150 and +20°C.<br>
As possible polymers, mention may be made of diene polymers, in particular diene elastomers.<br>
For example, it is possible to use polymers or copolymers derived from aliphatic or aromatic monomers comprising at least one unsaturated group (such as especially ethylene, propylene, butadiene, isoprene and styrene), polybutyl acrylate, or blends thereof; mention may also be made of silicone elastomers, functionalized elastomers {for example those functionalized by functional groups capable of reacting with the surface of the silica) and halogenated polymers, Polyamides may be mentioned.<br><br>
The polymer (or copolymer) may be a bulk polymer (or copolymer), a polymer (or copolymer) latex or a solution of a polymer (or copolymer) in water or in any other suitable dispersing liquid.<br>
As diene elastomers, mention may be made, for example, of polybutadienes (BR), polyisoprenes (IR), butadiene copolymers, isoprene copolymers, or blends thereof, and in particular styrene-butadiene copolymers (SBR, especially emulsion styrene-butadiene copolymers ESBR or solution styrene-butadiene copolymers SSBR), isoprene-butadiene copolymers (BIR), isoprene-styrene copolymers (SIR), styrene-butadiene-isoprene copolymers (SBIR) and ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymers (EPDM).<br>
Mention may also be made of natural rubber (NR).<br>
The polymer compositions may be sulphur-vulcanized (vulcanisates are then obtained) or crosslinked, especially by peroxides.<br>
In general, the polymer compositions furthermore include at least one coupling (silica/polymer) agent and/or at least one covering agent; they may also include inter alia  an antioxidant.<br>
It is possible in particular to use, as coupling agents, what are called "symmetrical" or "asymmetrical" polysulphide-based silanes, these being given as non-limiting examples; mention may more particularly be made of bis((C1-C4)alkoxyl-<br><br>
(C1-C4)alkylsilyl(C1-C4)alkyl polysulphides (especially disulphides, trisulphides or tetrasulphides) such as, for example, bis(3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl) polysulphides or bis(3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl) polysulphides. Mention may also be made of monoethoxydimethylsilylpropyl tetrasulphide.<br>
The coupling agent may be pregrafted onto the polymer.<br>
It may also be employed in the free state (that is to say not pregrafted) or grafted onto the surface of the silica. The same applies to the optional covering agent,<br>
The use of a silica according to the invention or a silica prepared by the process according to the invention may allow the quantity of coupling agent to be employed in reinforced polymer compositions to be substantially reduced, for example by around 20%, while maintaining a substantially identical compromise of properties.<br>
The coupling agent may optionally be combined with a suitable "coupling activator", that is to say a compound which, when mixed with this coupling agent, increases the effectiveness of the latter*<br>
The proportion by weight of silica in the polymer composition may vary over quite a wide range. Usually it represents from 20 to 80%, for example 30 to 70%, of the quantity of polymer(s).<br><br>
The silica according to the invention may advantageously constitute all of the inorganic reinforcing filler, and even all of the reinforcing filler, of the polymer composition.<br>
However, at least one other reinforcing filler, such as in particular a commercial highly dispersible silica such as, for example, Z1165MP or Z1115MP, a treated precipitated silica (for example one "doped" using a cation such as aluminium), or another inorganic reinforcing filler such as, for example, alumina, or even an organic reinforcing filler, especially carbon black (optionally covered with an inorganic layer, for example with silica), may optionally be combined with this silica according to the invention. The silica according to the invention therefore preferably constitutes at least 50%, or even at least 80%, by weight of all of the reinforcing filler.<br>
Mention may be made, as non-limiting examples, of finished articles based on the polymer compositions described above (especially those based on the abovementioned vulcanisates), shoe soles (preferably in the presence of a coupling (silica/polymer) agent), floor coverings, gas barriers, fire-retarding materials and also engineering components such as cable car wheels, seals for domestic electrical appliances, seals for liquid or gas pipes, seals for brake systems, sheaths or ducts, cables and drive belts.<br><br>
In the case of shoe soles, it is possible to use, advantageously in the presence of a coupling (silica/polymer) agent, polymer compositions based, for example, on natural rubber (NR), polyisoprene (IR), polybutadiene (BR), styrene-butadiene copolymer (SBR) and butadiene-acryonitrile copolymer (NBR)•<br>
For the engineering components, it is possible to use, for example in the presence of a coupling (silica/polymer) agent, polymer compositions based, for example, on natural rubber (NR), polyisoprene (IR), polybutadiene (BR), styrene-butadiene copolymer (SBR), polychloroprene, butadiene-acrylonitrile copolymer (NBR), hydrogenated or carboxylated nitrile rubber, isobutylene-isoprene copolymer (IIR), halogenated (especially brominated or chlorinated) butyl rubber, ethylene-propylene copolymer (EPM), ethylene-propylene™ diene terpolymer (EPDM), chlorinated polyethylene, chlorosulphonated polyethylene, epichlorohydrin rubber, silicones, fluorocarbon rubber and polyacrylates.<br>
The silicas according to the invention or those prepared by the process according to the invention may also be employed as a catalyst support, as an absorbent for active materials (in particular a support for liquids, for example those used in food, such as vitamins (vitamin E), choline chloride), as a viscosity-modifying, texturing or anti-clumping agent,<br><br>
as an element for battery separators, or as an additive for dentrifices or for paper.<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention without, however, limiting the scope thereof.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
10 litres of purified water were introduced into a 25 litre stainless steel reactor. The solution was heated to 80°C. The entire reaction was carried out at this temperature. 80 g/1 of sulphuric acid were introduced, with stirring (350 rpm, propeller stirrer), until the pH reached a value of 4.<br>
Simultaneously introduced into the reactor over 35 minutes were a sodium silicate solution (having an Si02/Na20 weight ratio of 3.52) having a concentration of 230 g/1 at a rate of 76 g/min and sulphuric acid, having a concentration of 80 g/1, at a rate set so as to maintain the pH of the reaction mixture at a value of 4. After the 30th minute of addition, the stirring rate was increased to 450 rpm.<br>
At the end of 35 minutes of simultaneous addition, the introduction of acid was stopped when the pH reached a value of 9. The flow of silicate was then also stopped. The mixture was then matured for 15 minutes at pH 9- At the end of maturing, the stirring rate was reduced to 350 rpm.<br><br>
Next, the pH was taken to pH 8 by introducing sulphuric acid. A new simultaneous addition was carried out for 40 minutes with a sodium silicate flow rate of 76 g/min (the same sodium silicate as in the case of the first simultaneous addition) and a flow rate of sulphuric acid, with a concentration of 80 g/1, regulated so as to maintain the pH of the reaction mixture at a value of 8.<br>
After this simultaneous addition, the reaction<br>
mixture is taken to a pH of 4 by sulphuric acid having<br>
a concentration of 80 g/1. The mixture is matured for<br>
10 minutes at pH 4. 250 ml of flocculant FA 10<br>
(polyoxyethylene having a molar mass of 5 x 106 g) at 1%0 were introduced after the 3rd minute of the<br>
maturing.<br>
The slurry was filtered and washed under vacuum (16.7% solids content). After dilution (13% solids content), the cake obtained was mechanically broken up. The resulting slurry was spray dried by means of a turbine spray dryer.<br>
The characteristics of the silica Pl obtained were then the following:<br>
CTAB specific surface area: 221 m2/g;<br>
BET specific surface area: 240 m /g;<br>
V(d5 - d50)/V(d5 - dlOO) •  0-74;<br>
Width Ld (XDC) : 1.62;<br>
Pore distribution width ldp: 1.42;<br><br><br>
9.575 kg of purified water and 522 g of sodium silicate (Si02/Na20 weight ratio of 3.55) with a concentration of 235 g/1 were introduced into a 25 litre stainless steel reactor. The solution was heated to 80°C.

Next, the pH was taken to pH 8 by introducing sulphuric acid over 2 minutes. A new simultaneous addition was carried out for 60 minutes with a sodium silicate flow rate of 76 g/min (the same sodium silicate as in the case of the first simultaneous addition) and a flow rate of sulphuric acid, with a concentration of 80 g/1, regulated so as to maintain the pH of the reaction mixture at a value of 8*<br>
After this simultaneous addition, the reaction mixture is taken to a pH of 4 over 5 minutes by sulphuric acid having a concentration of 80 g/1. The mixture is matured for 10 minutes at pH 4.<br>

EXAMPLE 4<br>
12 litres of a sodium silicate solution (Si02/Na20 weight ratio of 3.5) with a concentration of 10 g/1 were introduced into a 25 litre stainless steel reactor. The solution was heated to 80°C, The entire reaction was carried out at this temperature. Sulphuric acid, with a concentration of 80 g/1, was introduced, with stirring (300 rpm, propeller stirrer), until the pH reached a value of 8.9.<br>
Simultaneously introduced into the reactor over 15 minutes were a sodium silicate solution (having an Si02/Na20 weight ratio of 3.5) having a concentration of 230 g/1 at a rate of 76 g/min and sulphuric acid, having a concentration of 80 g/1/ at a rate set so as to maintain the pH of the reaction mixture at a value of 8.9. Thus, a sol of scarcely aggregated particles was obtained. The sol was withdrawn and rapidly cooled using a copper coil through which cold water circulates. The reactor was rapidly cleaned.<br><br>
4 litres of purified water were introduced into the 25 litre reactor. Sulphuric acid, having a concentration of 80 g/1, was introduced until the pH reached a value of 4. A simultaneous addition of the cold sol with a flow rate of 195 g/min and sulphuric acid, having a concentration of 80 g/1, with a flow rate allowing the pH to be set to 4, was carried out over 40 minutes. A maturing step lasting 10 minutes was carried out.<br>
After 40 minutes of simultaneous sol/sulphuric acid addition, there was a simultaneous addition, over 20 minutes, of sodium silicate with a flow rate of 76 g/min (the same sodium silicate as in the case of the first simultaneous addition) and sulphuric acid with a flow rate of 80 g/1 set so as to maintain the pH of the reaction mixture at a value of 4.

After this simultaneous addition, the reaction mixture is taken to a pH of 4 over 5 minutes by sulphuric acid having a concentration of 80 g/1. The mixture is matured for 10 minutes at pH 4.<br>
The slurry was filtered and washed under vacuum (15% cake solids content). After dilution, the cake obtained was mechanically broken up. The resulting slurry was spray dried by means of a turbine spray<br><br>
10 litres of a sodium silicate solution (Si02/Na20 weight ratio of 3-48) with a concentration of 5 g/1 were introduced into a 25 litre stainless steel<br><br>

After 3 0 minutes of simultaneous addition, the introduction of acid was stopped when the pH reached a value of 9. The flow of silicate was then also stopped. A maturing step was carried out for 15 minutes at pH 9, while progressively increasing the temperature (over 15 minutes) from 80 to 90°C, at which value the rest of the reaction was carried out.<br>
Next, the pH was brought to pH 8 by introducing sulphuric acid having a concentration of 80 g/1. There was then a new simultaneous addition, carried out over 50 minutes, of sodium silicate at a rate of 76 g/min (the same sodium silicate as in the first simultaneous addition) and of sulphuric acid, with a concentration of 80 g/1, at a rate set so as to maintain the pH of the reaction mixture at a value of 8.<br><br>
After this simultaneous addition, the reaction mixture is taken to a pH of 4 by sulphuric acid having a concentration of 80 g/1. The mixture is matured for 10 minutes at pH 4,<br>
The slurry was filtered and washed under vacuum (19.6% cake solids content). After dilution (10% solids content), the cake obtained was mechanically broken up. The resulting slurry was spray dried by means of a turbine spray dryer.<br>

Three polymer compositions were prepared:<br>
-	one containing highly dispersible precipitated silica Z1165MP, sold by Rhodia, having a density of 2*1 g/cm3, and a coupling agent (reference composition Rl);<br>
-	the other two each containing silica prepared in Example 4 and a coupling agent (compositions CI and C2) .<br>

(3 ) N-( 1, 3-dimethylbutyl)N' -phenyl-p-phenylenediamine; (4) N-cyclohexyl-2-benzothiazyl sulphenamide (CBS).<br>
Composition C1 contained a quantity of coupling agent identical to that of reference composition Rl. Composition C2 contained an optimized quantity of<br><br>
coupling agent with regard to the specific surface area of the silica used (Example 4).<br>
The compositions were prepared by thermomechanically working the elastomers in an internal mixer (of the Brabender type) having a volume of 7 5 cm3, in two steps, with a mean blade speed of 50 revolutions/minute until a temperature of 120°C was obtained, these steps being followed by a finishing step carried out on an external mixer.<br>
The vulcanization temperature was chosen to be 170°C. The vulcanization conditions for the compositions were tailored to the vulcanization rates of the corresponding compounds.<br>
The properties of the compositions are given below, the measurements having been carried out (on the vulcanized compositions) according to the following standards and/or methods:<br>
Vulcanization properties (rheological properties)<br>
(Green properties - Rheometry at 17 0°C, t = 30 minutes)<br>
NF T 43015 standard.<br>
A Monsanto 100 S rheometer was used especially for the measurement of the minimum torque (Cmin) and the maximum torque (Cmax) .<br><br>
Ts2 corresponded to the time over which it was possible to monitor the mixture; the polymer mixture cured after Ts2 (start of vulcanization).<br>
T90 corresponded to the time it took for the mixture to undergo 90% vulcanization.<br>
Mechanical properties (of the compositions vulcanized at 170°C)<br>
Tensile properties (moduli): NF T 46002 standard<br>
The x% moduli corresponded to the stress measured at a tensile strain of x%.<br><br><br>
It may be seen that compositions CI and C2 containing a silica according to the invention exhibit a useful compromise of properties compared with that of reference composition Rl.<br>
Despite the unoptimized vulcanization conditions, composition CI led to a more pronounced reinforcement in terms of moduli than reference composition Rl.<br>
The adjustment in coupling agent content made in the case of composition C2 results in a vulcanization rate comparable to that of reference composition Rl; in addition, composition C2 has moduli (in particular, 100% and 200% moduli) very much higher than those obtained with reference composition Rl.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
10 litres of a sodium silicate solution (Si02/Na20 weight ratio of 3,53) with a concentration of 5 g/1 were introduced into a 25 litre stainless steel reactor. The solution was heated to 80°C, Sulphuric acid, with a concentration of 80 g/1, was introduced, with stirring (300 rpm, propeller stirrer), until the pH reached a value of 4.2.<br>

After 35 minutes of simultaneous addition, the introduction of acid was stopped when the pH reached a value of 9. The flow of silicate was then also stopped. A maturing step was carried out for 15 minutes at pH 9, while progressively increasing the temperature (over 15 minutes) from 80 to 90°C, at which value the rest of the reaction was carried out.<br>
Next, the pH was brought to pH 8 by introducing sulphuric acid having a concentration of 80 g/1- There was then a new simultaneous addition, carried out over 50 minutes, of sodium silicate at a rate of 50 g/min (the same sodium silicate as in the first simultaneous addition) and of sulphuric acid, with a concentration of 80 g/1, at a rate set so as to maintain the pH of the reaction mixture at a value of 8.<br>
After this simultaneous addition, the reaction mixture is taken to a pH of 4 by sulphuric acid having a concentration of 80 g/1- The mixture is matured for 10 minutes at pH 4.<br>
The slurry was filtered and washed under vacuum (16,8% cake solids content). After dilution (10% solids content), the cake obtained was mechanically broken up.<br><br>
The resulting slurry was spray dried by means of a turbine spray dryer.<br>

Introduced into a 2000 litre reactor were 700 litres of industrial water. This solution was heated to 78°C by direct steam injection heating. Sulphuric acid, with a concentration of 80 g/1, was introduced, with stirring (95 rpm), until the pH reached a value of 4.<br>
Simultaneously introduced into the reactor over 35 minutes were a sodium silicate solution (having an Si02/Na20 weight ratio of 3.52) having a concentration of 230 g/1 at a rate of 190 1/hour and sulphuric acid, having a concentration of 80 g/1, at a rate set so as to maintain the pH of the reaction mixture at a value of 4.<br>
After 35 minutes of simultaneous addition, the introduction of acid was stopped when the pH reached a value of 8.

After this simultaneous addition, the reaction mixture is taken to a pH of 5.2 by sulphuric acid<br><br>
having a concentration of 80 g/1. The mixture is matured for 5 minutes at pH 5.2.<br>

characteristics of which were mentioned in Example 6),<br>

Example 8 and a coupling agent (composition C3).<br><br><br>

(6)	PEG 4000 type (sold by Huls);<br>
(7)	N-tert-butylbenzothiazyl sulphenamide;<br>
(8)	Tetrabenzylthiuram disulphide.<br>
The compositions werek prepared by thermomechanically working the elastomers in an internal mixer (Banbury type) having a volume of 1200 cm3. The initial temperature and the speed of the rotors were set so as to achieve drop temperatures of the compounds of about 120°C. This step was followed by a finishing step carried out on an external mixer at temperatures below 110°C. This phase allowed the vulcanization system to be introduced.<br>
The vulcanization temperature was chosen to be 160°C. The vulcanization conditions for the compositions were tailored to the vulcanization rates of the corresponding mixtures.<br>
The properties of the compositions are given below, the measurements having been carried out according to the following standards and/or methods:<br><br>
Vulcanization properties (rheological properties)<br>
(Green properties - Rheometry at 160°C, t - 30 minutes)<br>
NF T 43015 standard.<br>
A Monsanto 100 S rheometer was used especially for the measurement of the minimum torque (Cmin) and the maximum torque (Cmax).<br>
Ts2 corresponded to the time over which it was possible to monitor the mixture; the polymer mixture cured after Ts2 (start of vulcanization).<br>
T90 corresponded to the time it took for the mixture to undergo 90% vulcanization.<br>
Mechanical properties (of the compositions vulcanized at 160°C)<br>
Tensile properties (moduli, tensile strength and elongation at break): NF T 46002 standard<br>
The x% moduli corresponded to the stress measured at a tensile strain of x%.<br>
- Tear strength: NF T 46007 (method B) standard*<br><br>
-	Shore A hardness: ASTM D2240 standard; the<br>
value in question is measured 15 seconds after<br>
application of the force,<br>
-	Abrasion resistance: DIN 53516 standard; the<br>
measured value is the abrasion loss: the lower the<br>
loss, the better the abrasion resistance.<br><br><br>
It may be seen that composition C3 containing a silica according to the invention exhibits a particularly beneficial compromise of properties compared with that of reference composition R2.<br>
While still having a vulcanization rate comparable to that of reference composition R2 and moduli similar to those of reference composition R2, composition C3 possesses a tensile strength, an elongation at break, a tear strength and a Shore hardness that are superior to those of reference composition R2. Above all, composition C3 has an abrasion resistance very much higher than reference composition R2: the abrasion loss is thus reduced by almost 2 0%.<br>
EXAMPLE 13<br>
Three polymer compositions were prepared:<br>
-	one containing highly dispersible precipitated silica Z1165MP, sold by Rhodia (the characteristics of which were mentioned in Example 6), and a coupling agent (reference composition R3);<br>
-	the other two containing silica prepared in Example 8 and a coupling agent (composition C4), or silica prepared in Example 9 and a coupling agent (composition C5).<br><br><br>
(1)	Solution-synthesized styrene-butadiene copolymer<br>
(BUNA VSL 5025-1 type), oil-extended (37.5% by<br>
weight);<br>
(2)	Polybutadiene (BUNA CB24 type sold by Bayer);<br>
(3)	Filler/polymer coupling agent: bis(3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl tetrasulphide (sold by Degussa under the name Si69);<br><br>
(4)	N-l , 3-dimethylbutyl-N~phenyl-para~phenylenediamine (SANTOFLEX 6-PPD sold by Flexsys);<br>
(5)	Diphenylguanidine (VULKACIT D sold by Bayer);<br>
(6)	N-cyclohexyl-2-benzothiazyl sulphenamide (SANTOCURE sold by Flexsys).<br>
Each of the three compositions was prepared in three successive phases* The first two phases, carried out in an internal mixer, allowed thermomechanical working at high temperature until a maximum temperature of about 150°C was obtained* They were followed by a third mechanical working phase carried out on cylinders at temperatures below 110°C. The latter phase allowed the vulcanization system to be introduced.<br>
The mixer employed for the first two phases was an internal mixer of the Brabender type, with a capacity of 7 0 cm3. The initial temperature and the speed of the rotors were set each time so as to achieve drop temperatures of the compound close to 150°C.<br>
The first step made it possible to incorporate the elastomers (at to), the silica (divided introduction, 2/3 then 1/3) with the coupling agent (at t0 + 2 min), then with the DPG (at t0 + 4 min) and finally the stearic acid (at to + 6 min). After discharge from the mixer (compound drop at t0 + 7 min), followed by compound cooling (temperature below 100°C) and reintroduction (at t'0) into the internal mixer (the<br><br>
temperature then progressively rising), a second step in this mixer made it possible, by a thermomechanical treatment, to improve the dispersion of the silica and of its coupling agent in the elastomeric matrix.   During this step, the zinc oxide and the antioxidant were incorporated (at t'0 + 1 min) .<br>
After discharge from the mixer (compound drop at t'o + 4 min) followed by cooling of the compound (temperature below 100°C), the third phase made it possible to introduce the vulcanization system (sulphur and CBS). It was carried out on a cylinder mixer preheated to 50°C. The duration of this phase was between 5 and 2 0 minutes.<br>
After homogenization and finish passes, each final compound was calendered in the form of sheets 2™ 3 mm in thickness.<br>
The vulcanization temperature was chosen to be 160°C. The vulcanization conditions for the compositions were tailored to the vulcanization rates of the corresponding compounds.<br>
The properties of the compositions are given below, the measurements having been carried out according to the standards and/or methods indicated in Example 10.<br>
The dynamic properties (of the compositions vulcanized at 160°C), such as the tan5 at 60°C, were determined on a METRAVIB VA3000 viscoelasticimeter,<br><br>
according to the ASTM D5992 standard, with a 4% prestrain and a frequency of 10 Hz (sinusoidal wave).<br><br><br>
It may be seen that compositions C4 and C5 each containing a silica according to the invention exhibit a particularly beneficial compromise of properties compared with that of reference composition R3-<br>
While still having a vulcanization rate comparable to that of reference composition R3, compositions C4 and C5 possess moduli and a Shore hardness higher than those of reference composition R3. Above all, compositions C4 and C5 exhibit a much higher abrasion resistance than reference composition R3: the abrasion loss is thus reduced by about 2 0%. Finally, compositions C4 and C5 possess a lower tanS at 60°C than reference composition R3, it also proving to be particularly beneficial in the case of the properties of finished articles based on these compositions C4 or C5.<br><br><br><br>
