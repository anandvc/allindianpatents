				<td>SUBSTRATE WITH A SELF-CLEANING COATING<br>
The invention relates to various types of material that may be found in<br>
buildings, vehicles, urban furniture or in domestic electrical appliances, namely<br>
in particular:<br>
transparent substrates, made of glass or polymer, intended to serve as<br>
glazing, for example as a display screen;<br>
ceramic or glass-ceramic substrates that can be used for example in<br>
domestic electrical appliances;<br>
architectural materials, such as roof tiles, floor tiles, stone, cementitious<br>
compositions and metal surfaces; and<br>
fibrous mineral materials, such as glass insulation wool or textile glass<br>
yarns, that can be used as filtration material, for making false ceilings, quartz or<br>
silica fibers, etc.<br>
Recent studies have been carried out for the purpose of trying to improve<br>
the comfort of these materials when in use, especially to make them easier to<br>
clean.<br>
In particular, functional coatings having photocatalytic properties<br>
have been developed. These are especially coatings comprising TiO2 at least<br>
partially crystallized especially in the anatase form, which have for example<br>
been described in patents WO 97/10185, WO 97/10186, WO 99/44954 and<br>
WO 01 /66271. This type of semiconducting material, based on an optionally<br>
doped metal oxide (there are also other oxides that can be photocatalytic, such<br>
as ZnO, etc), is capable, through the effect of radiation of suitable wavelength,<br>
of initiating radical reactions that cause organic compounds to oxidize: this type<br>
of coating, when sufficiently exposed to ad hoc radiation (generally ultraviolet,<br>
and possibly visible range), is therefore very effective for degrading organic<br>
soiling. Furthermore, it has been discovered that, especially when the coatings<br>
are based on titanium oxide, they also exhibit a certain hydrophilicity when<br>
exposed for a sufficiently long time to said radiation. This coating is therefore<br>
very effective in that it can degrade organic soiling and, through its<br>
hydrophilicity, remove mineral soiling. However, its activity is dependent on its<br>
exposure (for a long enough time) to radiation (of sufficient intensity) of ad hoc<br>
wavelength. The behavior of this type of coating therefore depends strongly on<br><br>
the environmental conditions in the case of outdoor exposure, especially the<br>
sunshine and rain conditions. Likewise, in the absence of suitable illumination,<br>
its activity at night tends to be less than its activity during the day.<br>
The object of the invention is therefore to further improve the<br>
functionality imparted by this type of "self-cleaning" or "fouling delay"<br>
coatings. The invention is aimed in particular at obtaining coatings that can be<br>
of enhanced efficiency and can be more "multipurpose" with regard to various<br>
aspects: firstly with regard to radiation exposure conditions, secondly with<br>
regard to mechanical stresses (abrasion resistance, etc.) and finally with regard<br>
to the combination of other functionalities. The object of the invention is more<br>
particularly to obtain coatings that can, even under mediocre irradiation<br>
conditions, and even at night, or indoors, in particular under the action of<br>
residual ultraviolet radiation from conventional light fittings or of ultraviolet<br>
radiation passing through glazing, exhibit a certain antisoiling activity. Products<br>
associated with a UV lamp are also the subject of the invention, in particular<br>
self-cleaning filters.<br>
The subject of the invention is firstly a substrate that may essentially be<br>
transparent, especially one based on glass or one or more polymers, or may be<br>
made of a ceramic or glass-ceramic, or may even be an architectural material<br>
(of the type comprising a wall render, a concrete slab or block, architectural<br>
concrete, roof tile, material of cementitious composition, terracotta, slate,<br>
stone, or which may even be a fibrous substrate, based on glass of the mineral<br>
insulation wool type, or glass reinforcement yarn, or a product comprising quartz<br>
or silica). This substrate is distinguished by the fact that it is provided on at<br>
least part of its surface with a coating whose mesoporous structure exhibits<br>
photocatalytic properties and comprises at least partially crystallized titanium<br>
oxide, especially in anatase and/or rutile form. The term "mesoporous" refers<br>
to pores having diameters of between 2 and 50 nm. The mesoporous structure,<br>
obtained in the manner that will be described below, is especially based on at<br>
least one compound of at least one of the elements Si, W, Sb, Ti, Zr, Ta, V, B,<br>
Pb, Mg, AL, Mn, Co, Ni, Sn, Zn, In, Fe and Mo, where appropriate covalently<br>
bonded to elements such as O, S, N, C or the like. The at least partially<br>
crystallized titanium oxide is, for example, incorporated into the mesoporous<br>
structure in the form of perfectly discernable particles. The overall mesoporous<br><br>
structure incorporating the titanium oxide is essentially robust, capable of<br>
cohesion and exhibiting excellent mechanical strength and abrasion resistance.<br>
The mesoporous structure can be exclusively composed of titanium or of a<br>
titanium compound, such as the oxide, especially crystallized in the anatase or<br>
rutile form. It turns out that the titanium oxide thus incorporated exerts its<br>
photocatalytic activity to an exceptionally high degree. Thus, residual ultraviolet<br>
radiation, after having passed through single or double glazing, or residual<br>
ultraviolet radiation coming from an interior electrical illumination, is sufficient<br>
in respect of the substrate of the invention for it to degrade an organic residue<br>
and for this then to be carried away in a relatively uniform liquid film that<br>
possibly forms on the substrate made hydrophilic by the radiation. The coating<br>
of the invention combines the functionality of photocatalytic degradation of<br>
organic residues with the functionality of removing the organic and inorganic<br>
residues (hydrophilicity/oleophilicity) through the effect of any liquid, such as<br>
condensation liquid. The high performance levels afforded by the invention are<br>
perhaps attributable, at least in part, to the interconnection of the pore<br>
network, allowing the contamination good accessibility to the titanium oxide<br>
particles, and likewise good diffusion of the photogenerated species on the<br>
surface of these particles into the coating.<br>
Moreover, the abrasion resistance and the durability of the photocatalytic<br>
activity to such a high degree are excellent (see the examples below). The<br>
invention therefore also makes it possible to preserve the porosity after<br>
abrasion, whereas one might instead have expected that abrasion would<br>
consequently densify the surface layer and therefore finally end in a loss of<br>
antisoiling properties.<br>
In addition, the mesoporous nature of the substrate makes it possible to<br>
envision impregnation thereof, subsequent to the formation of the mesoporous<br>
structure, with functional agents such as deodorants, antibacterial agents or any<br>
other such agents.<br>
Advantageously, the substrate according to the invention is essentially<br>
transparent, flat or curved, of the glazing type, as it is in this type of application<br>
that the accumulation of soil preventing visibility is the most irksome and that<br>
washing operations are the most necessary in order to guarantee their<br>
transparency. This may be glazing with a macroscopic relief, for example<br><br>
pyramidal features with depths of the order of a few millimeters - i.e. impressed<br>
glass - , or exhibiting much smaller surface irregularities such as resulting from<br>
chemical etching using hydrofluoric acid - i.e. frosted or opacified glass.<br>
Preferably, the coating of the invention is formed with the interposition<br>
of a sublayer based on an at least partially oxidized silicon derivative chosen<br>
from silicon dioxide, substoichiometric silicon oxides, or silicon oxycarbide,<br>
oxynitride or oxycarbonitride. The sublayer proves to be useful when the<br>
underlying surface is made of glass, since the migration of alkali metal (sodium)<br>
ions from the glass into the coating of the invention may, under certain<br>
conditions, impair the photocatalytic properties thereof; in fact the sublayer<br>
forms an alkali metal barrier. The sublayer may be of the type described in the<br>
aforementioned patent WO 01/32578. Advantageously, it has a refractive index<br>
of between 1.45 and 1.80, especially between 1.50 and 1.75, for example<br>
between Land 1.. Such a relatively low index, on a transparent substrate of the<br>
glass type, makes it possible to prevent a reflecting effect that may be deemed<br>
unattractive.<br>
This sublayer therefore advantageously comprises Si, O, and possibly<br>
carbon and nitrogen. However, it may also include materials in a minor<br>
proportion compared with silicon, for example metals such as Al, Zn or Zr. The<br>
sublayer may be deposited by sol-gel or by pyrolysis, especially by CVD (chemical<br>
vapor deposition). The latter technique can be used to obtain SiOxCy or S1O2<br>
coatings quite easily, especially by deposition directly on the ribbon of float<br>
glass in the case of glass substrates. However, it is also possible to deposit such<br>
a coating by a vacuum technique, for example sputtering using an Si (optionally<br>
doped) target or a silicon suboxide target (for example in an oxidizing and/or<br>
nitriding reactive atmosphere).<br>
This sublayer preferably has a thickness of at least 5 nm, especially a<br>
thickness betweeniO and200 nm, for example between80 and120 nm.<br>
According to other advantageous features of the substrate of the<br>
invention :<br>
-	the coating with a mesoporous structure is deposited by a sol-gel method;<br>
-	its thickness is between 30 and 800 nm; and<br>
-	the titanium oxide incorporated into the mesoporous structure is<br>
optionally doped, as explained in patent applications WO 97/10185 and WO<br><br>
97/10186 incorporated here by way of reference, and comprises nanoparticles<br>
with diameters between 0.5 and 100 nm, in particular between 1 and 80 nm,<br>
themselves formed from a cluster of elementary grains or crystallites with<br>
diameters between 0.5 and 10 nm. The term "diameter" is taken here in the<br>
broad sense - it is more of a determination of the size of the nanoparticle or<br>
crystallite. The shape of the latter may approach that of a sphere, or else it may<br>
have an elongate shape in the form of a rice grain, or a completely random<br>
shape.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process for manufacturing<br>
a substrate as described above, said process comprising, in succession:<br>
-	the preparation of a liquid composition comprising at least one precursor<br>
of the material constituting the mesoporous structure of the coating and at least<br>
one organic structuring agent;<br>
-	the precipitation of the precursor around the organic structuring agent<br>
and the growth of molecules derived from the precursor;<br>
-	the addition into the liquid composition of nanoparticles or crystallites -<br>
according to the above definition - of optionally doped titanium oxide with<br>
diameters between 0.5 and 100 nm;<br>
-	the application of the composition to the surface to be coated; and<br>
-	the removal of the organic structuring agent,<br>
the elementary titanium oxide grains or crystallites being incorporated into the<br>
mesoporous structure while essentially preserving their integrity therein, it<br>
being possible for several of them to be aggregated therein into clusters. During<br>
manufacture of such a substrate, it is not excluded for the titanium oxide grains<br>
or crystallites to aggregate with one another and/or grow, especially the<br>
smallest among them, depending on the operating conditions (content, pH,<br>
temperature, etc.).<br>
For manufacturing the substrate of the invention, the preparation of the<br>
liquid composition advantageously comprises:<br>
-	preparation of an oxide (especially silica) precursor sol;<br>
-	maturing of the sol; and then<br>
-	mixing with the structuring agent.<br>
Maturing of the sol allows a preliminary condensation of the oxide<br>
precursor, which favors structurization of the oxide coating condensed on the<br><br>
support surface in large domains. Advantageous maturing conditions comprise<br>
holding the sol at a temperature between 40 and 60°C for a time between 30<br>
minutes and 24 hours, the maturing time being shorter the higher the<br>
temperature.<br>
In this case, the oxide precursor is advantageously a hydrolyzable<br>
compound, such as a halide or alkoxide, and the structuring agent is<br>
advantageously chosen from cationic surfactants, preferably of the quaternary<br>
ammonium type, such as cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide, or nonionic<br>
surfactants, including dibloc or tribloc copolymers based for example on<br>
ethylene oxide or propylene oxide.<br>
The subject of the invention is also the application of the substrates<br>
according to the invention, especially those that are essentially transparent, to<br>
the manufacture of "self-cleaning" glazing that can provide, simultaneously,<br>
antisoiling, antifogging and anticondensation behavior. This may be glazing for<br>
buildings, of the double glazing type, vehicle windows of the windshield, rear<br>
window, sunroof and side window type. It may also be windows for trains,<br>
aircraft and ships. It may also be utilitarian glazing, such as aquarium glass, shop<br>
window glass and greenhouse glass, or else glazing used in interior furnishings, in<br>
urban furniture or mirrors. It may also be glazing used as display screens of the<br>
television, computer or telephone screen type. This type of coating may also be<br>
applied to electrically controllable glazing, such as wire-type or layer-type<br>
heated windows, electrochromic glazing, glazing incorporating a liquid-crystal<br>
film, electroluminescent glazing or photovoltaic glazing.<br>
In the application of the substrate of the invention as glazing (based on<br>
glass or transparent plastic), one or more thin layers other than the<br>
aforementioned sublayer based on an at least partially oxidized silicon<br>
derivative, may be interposed between the support surface and the coating with<br>
a mesoporous structure. These may especially be layers with an antistatic<br>
function, a thermal function (heating, by providing it with current leads, low-<br>
emissivity function, solar-protection function, etc.) or optical function (by<br>
reducing the light reflection and/or making the color of the substrate in<br>
reflection more neutral, etc.), of an antireflection multilayer stack, etc. As<br>
regards such functional layers applied in a known manner to the glazing,<br>
optionally in the form of stacks, patent applications WO 97/10186 (already<br><br>
mentioned) and WO 02/02472 are incorporated here by way of reference.<br>
The substrate according to the invention, apart from its application as<br>
glazing, may be made of any architectural material that can be used to<br>
manufacture partitions, wall claddings, roofing and flooring, for inside or outside<br>
(metal, wood, stone, cement, concrete, terracotta, ceramic, wall render, etc.).<br>
The substrate, if instead based on mineral insulation wool, or textile<br>
based on glass reinforcement fibers, may serve as filtration material or else may<br>
be used for false ceilings, which are not easy to clean.<br>
The subject of the invention is also the application of a woven substrate,<br>
a nonwoven substrate (needle-punched mat, felt, wool, etc.), knitted substrate,<br>
braided substrate, or block of sintered fibers (known as "rigid silica") based on<br>
fused silica fibers with diameters between 1 and 20 urn, on washed glass fibers<br>
(more than 90% silica) or alumina and mullite fibers according to claim 1, to the<br>
manufacture of anti-odor filters, filters for decontamination of industrial<br>
effluents, antibacterial filters, filters for indoor decontamination and<br>
purification of domestic air, for purification of the passenger compartments of<br>
transport vehicles (automobiles, trains, aircraft, ships, etc.), filters for purifying<br>
cigarette smoke, filters for purifying domestic electrical appliances<br>
(refrigerators, etc.).<br>
The invention will now be described with the aid of nonlimiting examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Deposited on glass, still in the form of a ribbon of float glass, was a<br>
sublayer based on silicon oxycarbide, denoted for convenience by SiOC (without<br>
prejudging the actual oxygen and carbon contents in the coating), the glass<br>
being a clear silica-soda-lime glass 4 mm in thickness such as that sold by Saint-<br>
Gobain Glass France under the name Planilux. This sublayer was deposited by<br>
CVD using Si precursors, in particular using an SiH4/ethylene mixture diluted in<br>
nitrogen, by means of a nozzle placed above and transversely to the ribbon of<br>
float glass on a flat glass production line, within the float chamber, when the<br>
glass was still at a temperature of about 550 to 600°C. The coating obtained had<br>
a thickness of about 50 nm and a refractive index of about 1.55. Cut from the<br>
float glass provided with its SiOC alkali-metal barrier sublayer thus obtained<br>
were specimens 10 cm x 10 cm in size; these specimens were washed, rinsed,<br>
dried and subjected to a UV/ozone treatment for 45 minutes.<br><br>
A coating with a mesoporous structure was formed on the sublayer.<br>
The liquid treatment composition was obtained firstly by mixing 22.3 ml<br>
of tetraethoxysilane, 22.1 ml of absolute ethanol and 9 ml of HCl in<br>
demineralized water (1.25 pH) until the solution became clear, and then by<br>
placing the flask in a water bath at 60°C for 1 hour.<br>
Secondly, added to the sol obtained above was a solution of<br>
cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) on the one hand, and a solution of a<br>
polyoxyethylene/polyoxypropylene block copolymer sold by BASF under the<br>
registered trademark Pluronic PE6800 (8000 molecular weight) on the other, in<br>
proportions such that the CTAB/Si molar ratio was 0.1 and the PE6800/Si ratio<br>
was 0.01. This was obtained by mixing:<br>
-	0.686 g of CTAB, 20 ml of ethanol and 10 ml of sol; and<br>
-	3.78 g of PE6800, 50 ml of ethanol and 25 ml of sol.<br>
The TiO2 nanoparticles, crystallized as anatase and approximately 50 nm<br>
in size, were added in various proportions to one or other of the two liquid<br>
compositions thus obtained, just before deposition on the specimen. The<br>
deposition was carried out by spin coating, with a starting amount of 3 ml per<br>
specimen. (Other equivalent deposition techniques are dip coating, spraying,<br>
laminar coating, roll coating, flow coating, etc.).<br>
The specimens were then subjected to the following annealing treatment:<br>
-30min 100°C, 2 h hold;<br>
-	15min 150°C, 2 h hold;<br>
-15min175°C, 2 h hold;<br>
-10 min 200°C, no hold;<br>
-	3 h 20 min 300° C, 1 h hold; and<br>
-	2 h 30 min for 50°C, 1 h hold.<br>
The pores of the coating thus formed had a size of 2-3 nm when the<br>
cationic surfactant CTAB was employed as structuring agent, this size being<br>
4-5 nm when the copolymer PE6800 was employed as structuring agent.<br>
By SIMS analysis of the coating with a mesoporous structure, it was<br>
certified that the Ti/Si atomic ratio was exactly identical to that of the initial<br>
liquid composition. SIMS analysis also confirmed that the nanoparticles were<br>
distributed uniformly in the three dimensions of the coating.<br>
The table below gives the various characteristics of the coating at their<br><br>
formation and after 500 cycles of the Opel abrasion test - in the latter case the<br>
values indicated are in brackets. The Opel test (Building Standard EN 1096-2 of<br>
January 2001) consists in applying, to part of the coated surface 9.4 cm in length<br>
(this part being called the track), a felt 14 mm in diameter, 10 mm in thickness<br>
and 0.52 g/cm2 in density, under a load of 400 g/cm2, the felt then being<br>
subjected to a translational movement (fifty to-and-fro movements over the<br>
entire length of the track per minute) combined with a rotation of 6<br>
revolutions/minute (1 cycle = 1 to-and-fro movement).<br>
The thickness e (in nm) of the coatings was measured from the SIMS<br>
profiles and from the SEM micrographs.<br>
The amount of TiO2 (in ug/cm2) was measured by X-ray fluorescence.<br>
The photocatalytic activity was measured in the following manner:<br>
1.	the test was carried out on about 15 cm2 of coating;<br>
2.	the specimen was weighed and the thickness of the substrate, the light<br>
transmission TL and the haze Hd (both in %) were measured;<br>
3.	a palmitic acid solution ( 8 grams of acid per 1 I of chloroform) were<br>
deposited by spraying, with a glass/spray distance of 20 cm, onto the vertical<br>
substrate, in 3 to 4 successive passes;<br>
4.	the specimen was weighed after deposition of the palmitic acid in order<br>
to determine the thickness (in nanometers) of palmitic acid deposited;<br><br>
5.	the light transmission TL and the haze Hd were measured after<br>
deposition;<br>
6.	the variation in haze as a function of the UVA irradiation time of<br>
approximately 50 W/m2 intensity was measured;<br>
7.	the time at which the haze has decreased by 50% was determined<br>
graphically: this time is called t1/2 disappearance; and<br>
8.	the photocatalytic activity of the coating was evaluated as the rate of<br>
disappearance of the palmitic acid v (in nm/h) which is defined in the following<br>
manner:<br>
v(nm/h) = palmitic acid thickness (nm)/(2 x t 1/2disappearance(h)).<br>
Also given in the table below is the value of the photocatalytic activity<br>
divided by the amount of TiO2 in the coating. Finally, the optical properties,<br>
namely the light reflection RL and the haze Hd (in %), are indicated.<br>
The test numbers are defined as follows:<br><br>
-	1 and 2: CTAB as structuring agent, with Ti/Si = 0.1 and 0.25,<br>
respectively;<br>
-	3 to 7: PE6800 as structuring agent, with Ti/Si = 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2<br>
respectively.<br><br>
The thicknesses of the layers varied from 200 to 500 nm depending on the<br>
amount of TiO2 nanoparticles incorporated. After 500 Opel cycles, only the<br>
thickest (450 and 500 nm) coatings underwent a compaction to more than half of<br>
their initial thickness. The photoactivity of these coatings was however tested.<br>
The coatings exhibit photoactivities ranging from 43 nm/h in the case of<br>
the coatings structured with the cationic surfactant and the lowest TiO2<br>
concentration (2.2 ug/cm2) to 684 nm/h in the case of the coatings structured<br>
with the copolymer and with the highest TiO2 concentration (66 ug/2). The<br>
v/TiO2 ratio is always at least equal to 9.<br>
Partial or complete retention of the functionality after 500 Opel cycles is<br>
observed, the optical properties also not being impaired except in the case of<br><br>
the thickest layers with the highest TiO2 concentration (Ti/Si = 1 and 2) - in the<br>
case of the other layers, the RL and Hd values remain less than 11.4 and 1.2%<br>
respectively.<br>
Tests 3 to 7 were repeated (as tests 3' to 7') with low power (1.5 W/m2)<br>
UVA irradiation from a conventional illumination lamp; the v (nm/h) and v/TiO2<br>
values recorded are, for the N tests:<br>
-	3': 0and0;<br>
-	4': 0 and 0;<br>
-5': 13 and 0.75;<br>
-6': 19 and 0.57; and<br>
-7': 28 and 0.42.<br>
The substrate with the coating of the invention is therefore also<br>
photoactive under low power UVA irradiation in respect of palmatic acid<br>
degradation.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Disks 47 mm in diameter, 8 mm in thickness and 1000 g/m2 in density of<br>
needle-punched silica fiber felts, sold by Saint-Gobain Quartz under the name<br>
"Needle-punched Quartzel mat" (fiber diameters between 7 and 16 μn) were<br>
moreover impregnated by immersion in the composition of the above test No. 6,<br>
followed by the heat treatment described above. The increase in mass of the<br>
disks thus obtained was 10%.<br>
The ability of these disks to decompose a 350 ppm by volume<br>
concentration of methanol in gaseous nitrogen, by filtration with a flow rate of<br>
62.5 ml/mm, under UV illumination (190-350 nm) was tested.<br>
At an illumination power of 48 mW/cm2, the efficiency, that is to say the<br>
proportion of methanol decomposed, was 100%. At a power of 25.6 mW/cm2, it<br>
was about 96%, and even about 58% under illumination with as low a power as<br>
8.22 mW/cm2.<br>
Thus, the invention makes available a substrate capable of providing the<br>
optical transparency quality required in glazing applications and a lasting self-<br>
cleaning functionality under external atmosphere weather and erosion<br>
conditions. The remarkably high degree of photocatalytic functionality also<br>
makes it possible to envision use at night or indoors by profiting from low-<br>
intensity radiation such as that produced by conventional lighting or the passage<br><br>
of solar radiation through glazing, and also effluent or atmospheric<br>
decontamination applications, filtration, etc.<br><br>
