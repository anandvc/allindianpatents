METHOD OF PREPARING GAMMA/T-CELL<br>
ACTIVATING COMPOUNG<br>
BIOAGENCY AG of SCHNACKENBURGALLEE 116a, 22525 HAMBURG, GERMANY, GERMAN Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br>
GRANTED<br>
1-3-2005<br><br>
Organophosphorus compounds for the activation of ganunn/delta T-cells<br>
Numerous diseases in humans and animals arc caused by the abnormal functioning<br>
of the immune system. Consequently, there is a high demand for substances that<br>
are able to regulate the immune system.	;<br>
It is known how to employ the classical acetate/mevalonate pathway in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids (Beycia ED, Porter JW, Annu Rev Biochem. 1976;45:113-42), and an alternative method of biosynthesis is known that is independent of mevalonate, namely the 2-methyl-D-erythritol pathway (MEP, synonymous with DOXP) (Rohmer M. Nat Prod Rep. 1999 Oct;16(5):565-74). Both pathways lead to isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), the common precursor of all higher isoprenoids. While the acctatc/mcvalonatc pathway has been known for a long time and has been thoroughly explained, not all biosynthetic reaction steps that occur along the MEP are as yet known.<br>
It is known that human gamma/delta T-cclls are activated by one or several intermediates along the MEP. This means that a selective proliferation and cytokine secretion of the gamma/delta l'-ccll population is brought about during the incubation of peripheral blood lymphocytes with extracts from organisms that possess the MEP (Jomaa H, Feurlc J, Luhs K, Kunzmann V, Tony MP, Herder ich M, Wilhelm M, FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol, 1999 Sep;25(4):371-8). The exact chemical composition of this/these activating substance(s) is still unknown. The published data indicate that 3-formyl-l-bulyl pyrophosphate is formed as a hypothetical intermediate of the MEP and that it plays a role in the activation of gamma/delta T-cells (Belmant C, Espinosa E, Poupot R, Peyrat MA, Guiraud M, Poquet Y, Bonneville M, Fournie J J, J Biol., Chem. 1999 Nov 5;274(45):32079-84).<br>
The object of this invention is to provide substances which are able to stimulate gamma/delta T-cells and thereby have a regulatory effect on the immune system.<br>
This object is achieved by medicines which contain one or more of the substances defined in Claim 1 as well as in the subordinate claims.<br><br><br>

Tablets, dragecs, capsules, pills and granules may contain the active ingredients in addition to the usual excipients such as (a) fillers and diluents, e.g. starches, lactose, cane sugar, glucose, mannitol and silicic acid, (b) binders, e.g. carboxymethyl cellulose, alginates, gelatine and polyvinylpyrrolidone, (c) humectants, e.g. glycerine, (d) disintegrating agents, e.g. agar-agar, calcium carbonate and sodium carbonate,  (e) solution retarders, e.g.  paraffin, and (f)<br><br><br>
absorption accelerators, e.g. quaternary ammonium compounds, (g) wetting agents, e.g. cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, (h) adsorbents, e.g. kaolin and bentonite, and (i) lubricants, e.g. talcum, calcium and magnesium stearate and solid polyethylene glycols, or mixtures of the substances listed under (a) to (i). Moreover, the compounds according to the invention can also be incorporated into other carrier materials such as plastics (plastic chains for local therapy), collagen or bone cement.<br>
The tablets, dragecs, capsules, pills and granules may be provided with the usual coatings and envelopes optionally containing opaquing agents, and can be prepared in such a way that the active ingredients are released, optionally with a delay, only in the intestinal tract or, preferably, in a particular part of the intestinal tract, it being possible to use e.g. polymer substances and waxes as embedding compounds.<br>
The active ingredients can also be in microencapsulated form, optionally with one or more of the aforesaid excipients.<br>
In addition to the active ingredients, suppositories may contain the usual water-soluble or water-insoluble excipients, e.g. polyethylene glycols, fats, e.g. cacao fat, and higher esters (e.g. a C14alcohol with a C16 fatty acid), or mixtures of these substances.<br>
In addition to the active ingredient(s), ointments, pastes, creams and gels can contain the usual excipients, e.g. animal and vegetable fats, waxes, paraffins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycols, silicones, bentonites, silicic acids, talcum and zinc oxide, or mixtures of these substances.<br>
In addition to the active ingredient(s), powders and sprays may contain the usual excipients, e.g. lactose, talcum, silicic acid, aluminium hydroxide, calcium silicate and polyamide powder, or mixtures of these substances. Additionally, sprays may also contain the usual propellant, e.g. chlorofluorocarbons.<br>
In addition to the active ingredients, solutions and emulsions may contain the usual excipients such as solvents, solubilizers and emulsifying agents, e.g. water, ethyl<br><br><br>
alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformainide, oils, particularly cottonseed oil, peanut oil, maize oil, olive oil, castor oil and sesame oil, glycerine, glycerol formal, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitol, or mixtures of these substances.<br>
There are very marked differences in the amounts of the individual derivatives that are necessary in order to achieve the desired effect. Generally speaking, both in human as well as in veterinary medicine, it has proved to be advantageous if the active ingredient(s) of fomiula (I) are administered in total amounts of approximately 0.01 to about 2000 ug every 24 hours, if necessary in the form of several single doses, in order to achieve the desired results. A single dose preferably contains the active ingrcdient(s) in amounts of approximately 0.01 to about 2000 ug. However, it may be necessary to deviate from the abovementioned dosages, depending on the type and body weight of the person to be treated, the nature and severity of the disease, the type of preparation and the administration of the medicine, as well as the period or interval over which the preparation is administered.<br>
Consequently, it may be sufficient in a number of cases to manage with less than the abovementioned quantity of active ingredient, while in other cases the afore¬mentioned quantity of active ingredient will have to be exceeded. 'The optimum dosage required and the type of administration of the active ingredients can be determined by those skilled in the art on the basis of their specialist knowledge.<br>
In the treatment of animals, the compounds to be used according to this invention can be given in the usual concentrations and preparations together with the food or food preparations or with the drinking water.<br>
Example 1<br>
Purification of gamma/delta T-ccIl activating compounds<br>
Various gamma/delta T-cell activating compounds were isolated from Coryne-bacterium ammoniagenes. 28 kg of the cell mass were digested with a Dynax mill<br><br><br>
in 50 mM ammonium formate buffer (pH 8.0). After preabsorption on : hydrophobic polystyrene matrix, the digested material was loaded onto an anioi exchanger and elutcd with a stepped gradient (100, 300, 500 mM ammoniun formate, pH 8.0). The 300 mM eluatc was passed through a C-18 matrix and thei through a 3 kDa hollow fibre filter for ultrafiltration. The filtrate was diluted will water to 30 mM ammonium formate and loaded once more onto an anioi exchanger. Elution then took place with a linear gradient of 30 to 500 mtv ammonium formate. Individual fractions were tested for their ability to activate gamma/delta T-cells. Then some of the active compounds were precipitated a barium salts by the admixture of 100 mM BaCh and 80% EtOH. The precipitate were dissolved in 20 mM ammonium formate buffer (pH 8.0) am rechromatographed on an anion exchanger.<br>
In this way it is possible to isolate compounds 1 to 6.<br>
Example 2<br>
Activation of gamma/delta T-cells by enriched MEP intermediates<br><br>
Lymphocytes were obtained from the peripheral blood of healthy donors by Ficol density gradient centrifugation. For each test, 2 x 105 of tne cells so obtained wen seeded in a volume of 0.2 ml of RPMI-1640 medium (Life Technologies) that wa: nriched with 25 mM HEPES, 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.025 mg/ml of gentamicin, 10( U/ml of human interleukin-2 (IL-2) (all from Life Technologies) and 10% humai AB serum (Bavarian Red Cross). The test fractions were added in variou: dilutions, and isopentcnyl diphosphate (IPP) from Sigma was used in a Una concentration of 10 uM as a positive control. Incubation was effected in th

<br><br>
Example 3<br>
The synthesis was effected in the manner described in diagram 1:<br><br>
Diagram 1: Synthesis plan<br>
1.	Preparation of compounds la to Ic<br>
Compounds la and lb were prepared in an analogous manner to that described in K. Sato, S. Inoue, Y. Takagi, S. Morii, Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn., 1976, 49(11), 3351 -3351.<br>
The preparation of compound Ic is analogous to that described in H. Kunio, 11. Kazushige, Chem. Pharm. Bull., 1994, 42, 4, 786-791.<br>
2.	Syntheses of compounds Ila to11e<br>
^<br><br>
Compound Ila was prepared according to current methods which are known to those skilled in the art, such as have been described in e.g. B. Woodside, Z. Huang,  C. Poulter, Org. Synth. 1988, 66, 211-219, starting from compound lb.<br>
Compound lib was prepared starting from compound la. la was first converted to the corresponding tosylate and then reacted e.g. with tris(tetra-n-butylammonium) hydrogenomethylenediphosphate. The synthesis was carried out in a manner analogous to that described in WO00/59916 and the publications cited therein.<br>
Compound 11Cin turn was prepared from compound lc. The syntheses were carried out in the manner described in R.C. McClard and T.S. Fujita, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1987,109,5544-5545.<br>
Compound 11Ccould be obtained in a low yield and was immediately hydrolysed in order to obtain compound IIIc.<br>
3. Syntheses of compounds IIIa TOIIIc<br>
In order to prepare compounds IIIa to IIIc, 500 mg of the corresponding precursors IIa and IIb were each dissolved in 5 ml of methanol and treated with 10 mol% of hydrogenation catalyst. Then hydrogen was introduced at room temperature and the uptake of hydrogen was measured. After the appropriate amount of hydrogen had been taken up, the mixture was filtered and the solvent was stripped off. The required products IIa and IIIb were obtained with a good degree of purity. Further purification can be achieved by chromatographic methods. Compound lite was obtained from compound 11C. 200 mg of compound 11e were dissolved in absolute methylene chloride (3 ml) in a heated, argon-flushed flask and 10 eq. of trimethylbromosilane were added at 0°C. After stirring for one hour at 0°C, stirring was continued for a further 12 h at room temperature. Finally, an aqueous work-up yielded the required product lllc, which was purified by ion exchange chromatography.<br>
In order to test the activation of gamma/delta T-cells, either the isomcrically pure compounds or E/Z mixtures of the compounds were used.<br><br><br>
Example 4	<br>
Purification of gamma/delta T-cell activating compounds<br>
Various gamma/delta T-ccll activating compounds were isolated from Coryne-bacterium ammoniagenes. 28 kg of the cell mass were digested with a Dynax mill in 50 mM ammonium formate buffer (pH 8.0). After preabsorption on a hydrophobic polystyrene matrix, the digested material was loaded onto an anion exchanger and eluted with a stepped gradient (100, 300, 500 mM ammonium formate, pH 8.0). The 300 mM eluate was passed through a C-18 matrix and then through a 3 kDa hollow fibre filter for ultrafiltration. The filtrate was diluted with water to 30 mM ammonium formate and loaded once more onto an anion exchanger. Elution then took place with a linear gradient of 30 to 500 mM ammonium fomiate. Individual fractions were tested for their ability to activate gamma/delta T-cells. Then some of the active compounds were precipitated as barium salts by the admixture of 100 mM BaCb and 80% EtOH. The precipitates were dissolved in 20 mM ammonium formate buffer (pH 8.0) and rechromatographed on an anion exchanger. In this way it was possible to isolate<br>
compounds 1 to 6, 13 and 14.<br>

Example 5<br>
Activation of gamma/delta T-cclls by enriched MEP intermediates<br>
Lymphocytes were obtained from the peripheral blood of healthy donors by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. For each test, 2 x 105 of the cells so obtained were seeded in a volume of 0.2 ml of RPMI-1640 medium (Life Technologies) that was enriched with 25 mM HEPES, 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.025 mg/ml of gentamicin, 100 U/ml of human interleukin-2 (IL~2) (all from Life Technologies) and 10% human AB serum (Bavarian Red Cross). The test fractions were added in various dilutions, and isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) from Sigma was used in a final concentration of 10 uM as a positive control. Incubation was effected in the incubator with 5% CO2 at 37°C. Alter 72 hours the cells were harvested and analysed in a flow cytometer. In so doing, the expression of the CD25 activation marker on the surface of V gamma 9f T-cells was measured with the aid of the monoclonal antibodies CD25-PE (B 1.49.9), V gamma 9-FITC (lmrnu360) and CD3-PC5 (UCHT1) supplied by Beckman-Coulter.<br><br><br>
