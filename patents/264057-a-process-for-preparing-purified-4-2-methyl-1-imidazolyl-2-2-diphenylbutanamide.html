an inner temperature of below 15°C, the crystals were collected from the solution by filtration. These crystals were washed with a mixture of 30mL of 2-propanol and 60mL of purified water, then with each 250mL of purified water five times (fifth washed solution: pH 8.80).<br>
The crystals were dried for 16 hours at 40°C in blower to obtain 55. 2g (86.4%) of crude crystals. Into a mixed solution of 200mL of 95% 2-propanol, 27. 6g out of these were dissolved completely by heating, which was then stirred for 1 hour at room temperature to crystallize out of the solution, followed by cooling with ice water. After stirring the solution for 1 hour at an inner temperature of below 15°C, the<br><br>
