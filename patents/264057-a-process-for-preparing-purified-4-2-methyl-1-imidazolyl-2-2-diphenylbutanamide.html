1.	Salt of 4-(2-methyl-l-imidazolyl)-2,2-diphenylbutanamide, or<br>
hydrate of that salt.<br>
2.	Hydrochloride or phosphate of 4-(2-methyl-l-imidazolyl)-2,2-<br>
diphenylbutananu.de, or hydrate of that acid salt.<br><br>
3.	Acid salt or hydrate of that acid salt of Claim 2, characterized<br>
in that it is a preparative intermediate of 4- (2-methyl- 1-imidazolyl)<br>
-2,2-diphenylbutanainide.<br>
4.	Acid salt or hydrate of that acid salt of Claim 2, characterized<br>
in that it is a preparative intermediate for preparing purified<br>
product of 4-(2-methyl- 1-imidazolyl)-2,2-diphenylbutanamide, and<br>
it allows easy separation and purification.<br>
5.	A process for preparing separated and purified product of acid<br>
salÂ£ or hydrate of that acid salt of Claim 2, wherein inorganic acid<br>
or organic acid is reacted with crude crystals of 4-(2-methyl-<br>
1-imidazolyl) -2,2-diphenylbutanamide to separate and purify the acid<br>
salt or hydrate of that acid salt.<br>
6.	A process for preparing purified 4-(2-methyl-l-imidazolyl)<br>
-2,2-diphenylbutanamide by neutralizing the separated and purified<br>
product of acid salt or hydrate of that acid salt of Claim 5 with<br>
alkali.<br>
7.	A process for preparing purified product of 4-(2-methyl-l-<br>
imidazolyl)-2,2-diphenylbutanamide, wherein the acid salt of<br>
4-(2-methyl-1-imidazolyl)-2,2-diphenylbutanamide, or hydrate of<br>
that acid salt separated in Claim 5 is recrystallized from alcohol<br>
and ethyl acetate, followed by neutralization, by using hydroxide<br>
of alkali metal, and the crystals obtained are recrystallized from alcohol or water-containing alcohol.<br>
8.	The acid salt or hydrate of that acid salt of Claim2 or 3, that allows to provide 4-(2-methyl-l-imidazolyl)-2,2-diphenylbutanamide with high quality in good yield only by simple recrystallization.<br>
Salt   of   4-(2-methyl-l-imidazolyl)-2,2-diphenylbutanamide,<br>
hydrate substantially as herein described with reference to<br>
foregoing description, examples and the accompanying tables.<br>
9.     Salt of 4-(2-methyl-I- imidazolyl)-2,2- diphenylbutanamide, or hydrate substantially as herein described with reference to the foregoing description, examples and the accompanying tables.<br>
10.	Hydrochloride  or phosphate of 4-(2-methyl-1-imidazolyl)-2,2- diphenylbutanamide, or hydrate substantially as herein descril<br>
with reference to the foregoing description, examples and the accompanying tables.<br>
11.	Acid   salt  or   hydrate   substantially  as   herein   described   with<br>
reference   to   the   foregoing  description,   examples   and the accompanying tables.<br>
12.	A process for preparing separated and purified product of acid salt or hydrate substantially as herein described with reference to the   foregoing   description,   examples   and   the   accompanying tables.<br>
13.	A process for preparing purified 4-(2-methyl-1-imidazolyl)-2,2- diphenylbutanamide   substantially   as    herein    described   with<br>
reference   to   the   foregoing   description,   examples   and the accompanying tables.<br></example></td>
