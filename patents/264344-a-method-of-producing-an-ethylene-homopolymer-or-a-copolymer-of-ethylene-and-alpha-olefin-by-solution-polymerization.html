Background Art<br>
Conventionally, Ziegler-Natta catalyst system which comprises a main catalyst component of titanium or vanadium compounds and a cocataly st component of alkyl aluminum compounds has been used to produce an ethylene homopolymer or copolymers of ethylene and a-olefins. However, the Ziegler-Natta catalyst system is disadvantageous in that, even though it is highly active in the polymerization of ethylene, the molecular weight distribution of a resultant polymer is wide, and particularly, a compositional distribution is non-uniform in the copolymer of ethylene and a-olefin due to heterogeneous catalyst active sites.<br>
Recently, the metallocene catalyst system which comprises a metallocene compound of a 4 group transition metal in the periodic table, such as titanium, zirconium, or hafnium, and methylaluminoxane as a cocatalyst has been developed. Since the metallocene catalyst system is a homogeneous catalyst having one kind of<br><br><br>
312632, md Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication Nos. Sho.63-092621, Hei.02-84405, and Hei.03-2347 disclose metallocene compounds, such as Cp TiQ , Cp ZrCl, Cp ZiMeQ, Cp ZrMe , or (ethylene-bis tetrahydroindenyl)ZrCl, activated<br>
ii	£i	*i	i,	ii	2<br>
with methylalmninoxane as a cocatalyst to polymerize elhylene at high catelytic activity, thereby making it possible to produce polyethylene having a molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) of 1.5 - 2.0. However, it is difficult to produce a polymer having a high molecular weight using the above catalyst system. Particularly, if it is applied to a solution polymerization process which is conducted at high temperatures of 140°C or higher, polymerization activity is rapidly reduced and a-hydrogen elimination reaction is dominant, thus it is unsuitable for producing a high molecular weight polymer having a weight average molecular weight (Mw) of 100,000 or more.<br>
Meanwhile, a constrained geometry non-metallocene catalyst (a so-called single-site catalyst) in which a transition metal is connected to a ligand system in a ring shape has been suggested as a catalyst which has high catalytic activity and is capable of producing a polymer having a high molecular weight in polymerization of only ethylene or in copolymerization of ethylene and a-olefin under a solution polymerization condition. EP Pat. Nos. 0416815 and 0420436 suggest a catalytic system in which a transition metal is connected to cyclopentadiene ligand and an amide group in a ring shape, and EP Pat. No. 0842939 discloses a catalyst in which a phenol-based ligand as an electron donor compound is connected with a cyclopentadiene ligand in a ring shape. However, since the cyclization of the ligands along with the transition metal compound is achieved at very low yield during synthesis of the constrained geometry catalyst, it is difficult to commercialize them.<br>
Meanwhile, an example of non-metallocene catalysts which is not a constrained geometry catalyst and is capable of being used under a high temperature solution condition are disclosed in US Pat. No. 6,329,478 and Korean Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2001-0074722. The patents disclose a single-site catalyst using one or more phosphinimine compounds as a ligand, having high ethylene conversion during copolymerization of ethylene and a-olefins under the high temperature solution polymerization condition at 140°C or higher. However, a limited range of phosphine compounds may be used to produce the phosphinimine ligand, and, since these compounds are harmful to the environment and to humans, it might have some difficulties in using them to produce general-purpose olefin polymers. US Pat. No. 5,079,205 discloses a catalyst having a bis-phenoxide ligand, but it has too low catalytic acitivity to be commercially used.<br><br><br>
phenol ligand are limited to only simple alkyl substituents such as isopropyl group. On the other hand, /. Organomet Chenu 1999,591,148 (Rothwell, P. et al) discloses an arylphenoxy liganxi, but does not suggest the effects of aryl substituent at the ortho-position.<br>

Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a single-site catalyst and a high temperature solution polymerization method using the same. The single-site catalyst includes environmentally-friendly raw materials, synthesis of the catalyst is very economical and thermal stability of the catalyst is excellent.
