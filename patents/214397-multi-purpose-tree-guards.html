				<td>This invention relates to a multi purpose tree guard.<br>
In the known art the small. 1 trees are saved from cattle's by providing fencing made of bricks or by placing a drum having the holes therein. Further a metallic structure having side walls made of wiremesh which also used -for guarding the small trees from cattle's.<br>
There are disadvantages associated with the tree guards known in the art* One of main disadvantage is that these tree guards, do not have means to provide drip feeding of the water near the roots of the tree.<br>
Another disadvantage is that the size of the tree guards is fixed during the manufacturing of the tree guard and the size cannot be changed as par the requirements of the user.<br>
Another disadvantage is that transportation of the tree guards is difficult.<br>
Therefore the main object of this invention is to provide a navel construction of the tree guard which obviates the disarivctntagea associated in the known art.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a novel tree guard having means for drip •feeding a-f the water near the roots of the tree and wastage of the water is avoided.<br>
Yet another object o-f this invention is to propose a tree guard whose size can be adjusted as per the requirements cvf the user.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a navel tree guard in the form of a panels to make it easily transportable.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a tree guard comprising a panel/frame made of hollow horizontal and vertical members secxired with each other, openings being provided in the top horizontal member -for providing water in the said structure, pickets<br>
being provided with the bottom horizontal member for fixing said panel into the ground, a hollow drive down pipe being provided with the bottom end of said panel such that to provide water near the roots of the tree, connectors being provided removably at the ends of horizontal members for connecting said panel with the the other panels so as to form a tree guard.<br>
In accordance with this invention the tree guard has a panel or frame made of any suitable<br>
material such as metal or plastic depending on the use of the tree guard. The panel is made of horizontal member and vertical member secured with each other such that to provide and a structure and adapted to be filled with water. Inlet openings are provided in the top horizontal members for filling the water into the panel. Pickets are provided with the bottom horizontal member so as to fix the panel in the? ground. A hallow drive down pipe having drip feeding means, provided therein is provided in the bottom horizontal member of the panel for supplying water near the roots of the tree to be guarded. Outlets openings are provided in the bottom member of the panel for providing water supplying to the flexible pipe of the drip feeding means. Connectors are provided at the ends of the horizontal member for connecting the panel with the other panel so as to form a complete tree- guard. Top frame made of agrimesh or other loose woven sacking is provided at the top of the side panels where protecting the tree from the hail, heavy rain and scorbing sun above. The diagonal tiles are provided in the adjacent perpendicular panels hear the corners to enhance the structural stability of the tree guard.<br>
A  tree  guard  according  to  a  preferred embodiment  is herein described and illustrated  in  the accompanying drawings wherein-Fig.1 shows the plan view of the tree guard. Fig.2 shown the side panels,<br>
Fig.3 shows the connectors of different embodiment, Fig.4 shows the drive down drip feed pipe, Fig.5 shows the plan view of the panel/frame according to another embodiment; and<br>
Fig.6 shows the blocks used for making  the  panel  as shown in Fig.5,<br>
Referring to the drawings particularly Fig.1 the tree guard has a aide panels P made of horizontal and vertical side members i and 2. The panels P is made of metal or plastic depending on the use of the tree guard. Inlet openings 3 arc? provided in the top horizontal member i for filling the water into the panels P. Removable caps 4 are provided at the ends of the horizontal members for protecting the threads 9 provided on the ends for connecting the panel/frame P with other panel/frame P by means of connectors 8 as shown in Fig.3. Outlet openings 5 are provided in the bottom horizontal member i for connecting the hollow drive down pipe 7 provided with th  e drip feeding means therewith. Pickets 6 are provided in the bottom<br>
horizontal member I for facilitating the fixing of the panel/tree guard i the ground. Digonal tiles 10 are provided between two side panels for enhancing the structural stability to the tree guard. A top panel/frame made of agrimesh or other loose woven sacking is provided at the top of the tree guard to protect the tree from chain, heavy rain and scorning sun.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig.2 the side panel P is made of hollow horizontal and vertical members 1 and 2 secured with each other such that to form a panel and adapted to be filled with water into it. The size of the horizontal and vertical members depends on the users requirements and the requirement of water to be filled in the panel.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig.4 the drive down drip feed pipe 7 is made of a hollow pipe having a solid thick cap 11 provided at the upper end thereof. A solid wedge/protected end is provided at the bottom of drip feed pipe 7 for facilitating the fixing of the drive down pipe deeper and deeper into the ground and said blocks with each other.<br>
Thus, it is seen that the tree guard provided by the present invention serves as a multi purpose for protecting the trees from the catties as well as provides water supply near the roots of the tree by drip feeding means and thus the wastage of water used watering the plants is avoided . The side panels are connected with other side panels by means of connector and thus the size of the tree guard can be increased as per the requirements of the user.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
