				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention, in general, relates to the field of mobile applications. Particularly, the present invention relates to a method for selective anchoring for VCC AS. More particularly, the present invention relates to selective anchoring of calls originating from a circuit switch domain at VCC AS (Voice Call Continuity Application Server) based on Location Information.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
Voice Call Continuity, a home IMS application, provides capabilities to transfer voice calls between CS domain and IMS and vice versa. VCC also provides various functions such as voice call origination, termination and Domain Transfer.<br>
The VCC application is implemented in the user's home network. Voice calls from and to a VCC UE (User's Equipment) are anchored at the VCC application in the home IMS to provide voice continuity for the user during transition. VCC voice calls either in the CS domain or IMS are anchored at the VCC application in the home IMS using standard CS domain techniques available for rerouting calls at call establishment. A 3pcc (Third party call control) function is employed at the VCC application to facilitate inter domain mobility through the use of Domain Transfers between the CS domain and the IMS. Domain Transfers may be enabled in one direction (i.e. from the CS domain to the IMS or from the IMS to CS domain), or in both directions as per network configuration requirements. The VCC application has the capability to perform domain transfers for a VCC UE's voice session multiple times in both directions.<br>
Voice calls originated by VCC subscribers in the CS domain may or may not be anchored in the IMS to facilitate domain transfer of the call to the IMS, subject to operator policy. IMS services are accessed using Wi-Fi (WLAN, WiMAX, etc..).<br>
A major concern of the technicians in this field is that the anchoring decision is subject to operator policy and hence holds a substantial bearing on the procedures. It is also a worrying factor that the network resources will be under utilized if domain transfer is not performed during the duration of call after firming up the decision to anchor. It is also worth mentioning here that anchoring of calls will increase the call set-up time. Further if the decision is not to anchor, domain transfer cannot take place.<br>
US Patent entitled "Voice Call Continuity Application Server Between IP- CAN AND CS NETWORKS" (Patent Publication No.US20070014281) describes a system and method for continuous voice calls when a user switches between packet data and circuit switched access networks. It describes an interworking system that supports voice call continuity for a user that moves between IP-CAN and CS networks (e.g., PSTN or GSM). A voice call continuity application server (VCC-AS) serves as an anchor point for a voice call (i.e., it is the node from which a handover is initiated) and controls and handles voice calls to and from the user equipment (UE) regardless of the access network.<br>
Even though the prior art has its own merits, it does not employ location information to determine selective anchoring of Circuit Switched originating calls, and thus possess some limitations also.<br>
In the light of above, the present invention proposes a method for selective anchoring of calls originating from a Circuit Switched (CS) domain at VCC Application Server (VCC AS), based on location information of the user equipment (UE).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore primary object of the invention to provide a method for selective anchoring of CS originated calls at VCC AS, using location information of the UE in determining whether the calls to be anchored or not.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide an operator voice call continuity for managing the database at the VCC AS.<br>
It is yet another object of the invention to extract location information of the UE from the Initial Detention Point message (IDP) from the mobile switching centre.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to base the decision on anchoring subjective to the anchoring policy.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to let users make outgoing calls from areas where there is no Wi-Fi coverage.<br>
It is another object of the invention to reduce the call set up time to a moderate level.<br>
It is yet another object of the invention to reduce the load on VCC AS Accordingly the present invention provides a method for selective anchoring of calls originating from a Circuit Switched (CS) domain at Voice Call Continuity Application Server (VCC AS), based on location information of the User Equipment (UE) to decide on whether to anchor the call or not in conformity with the anchoring policy attributed to the location information matched up with in a database in the VCC AS, the method comprising<br>
•	Extracting the location information of the User Equipment (UE) from Initial Detection Point (IDP) message availed by VCC AS from the Mobile Switching Centre (MSC); and<br>
•	Finding out the corresponding anchoring policy pertaining to the location of the UE from the said database in VCC AS and deciding on whether or not to anchor the call.<br>
These and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the call flow for CS originated call when Anchoring is performed.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the call flow for CS originated call when Anchoring is not performed.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The disclosed embodiments herein are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. Therefore the details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting but merely as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make or use the invention.<br>
According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, it proposes a method for selective anchoring of calls originating from a CS domain for VCC AS based on location information. Another aspect of the preferred embodiment, VCC AS has a predetermined database containing local information versus anchoring policy. Further aspect of the preferred embodiment of the invention Location information of the user Equipment is also in the form of an Initial Detection Point message. When the server receives the message from the mobile switching centre for selective anchoring of the call, using the location information of the UE, VCC AS extracts and checks it with the corresponding anchoring policy in the database. Depending on the result based on the anchoring policy server decides whether to anchor the call or not.<br>
Fig 1 depicts the call flow for CS originated call when Anchoring is performed. As shown<br>
1.	The VCC user originates a voice call in the CS domain using a VCC UE to party-B.<br>
2.	Origination triggers at the VMSC are detected; VMSC sends an Initial DP message towards the gsmSCF.<br>
3.	The gsmSCF invokes the VCC Application's CAMEL Svc.<br>
When VCC AS gets the IDP message from VMSC, it extracts the Location information (ex: cell identifier), and checks for the corresponding Anchoring policy in the data-base. Based on the result of the Anchoring policy, if VCC AS is supposed to anchor the call, VCC AS sends Connect message to VMSC.<br>
4.	The CAP Connect message contains the Original Called party ID and Destination Routing Address. Destination Routing Address contains the IMRN to route the call to the CSAF.<br>
5.	The VMSC routes the call towards the user's home IMS network using the IMRN via an MGCF in the home network.<br>
6.	The MGCF initiates an INVITE towards the l-CSCF in the home IMS of the originating VCC user. The calling party number and/or original called number are included in the INVITE if they are received from the PSTN call setup signalling (e.g., ISUP).<br>
7.	The l-CSCF routes the INVITE based on one of the following standard procedures.<br>
7a. The l-CSCF forwards the INVITE to the CSAF via the S-CSCF that is assigned to the IMRN.<br>
7b. The l-CSCF forwards the INVITE directly to the CSAF.<br>
8.	If When the INVITE arrives at the VCC Application, it is processed by the CSAF of the VCC Application which may use the IMRN to retrieve the original called party number and the calling party number from the CAMEL Service. The CSAF uses the original called number and the calling party number to setup the outgoing call leg to party-B<br>
9.	The DTF of the VCC Application anchors the originating session for enablement of domain transfers for the session as part of this procedure based on operator policy.<br>
Note: Steps 8 and 9 may comprise of a sequence of messages for communication to/from different VCC Functional Elements.<br>
10.	The DTF sends the INVITE back to the S-CSCF for completion of the call toward the remote end.<br>
Standard originating call setup procedures are followed to continue the call setup at the S-CSCF for the VCC user.<br>
Fig 2 depicts the call flow for CS originated call when Anchoring is not performed. As shown<br>
1.	The VCC user originates a voice call in the CS domain using a VCC UE to party-B.<br>
2.	Origination triggers at the VMSC are detected; VMSC sends an Initial DP message towards the gsmSCF.<br>
3.	The gsmSCF invokes the VCC Application's CAMEL Svc.<br>
When VCC AS gets the I DP message from VMSC, it extracts the Location information (ex: cell identifier), and checks for the corresponding Anchoring policy in the data-base. Based on the result of the Anchoring policy, if VCC<br>
AS is not supposed to anchor the call, VCC AS sends Continue message to VMSC.<br>
4. VMSC now continues to establish a normal CS call.<br>
VCC AS determines the Anchoring decision based on the Location information present in the IDP message (step 2) of the call flow. VCC AS has a Data-base of Location information versus an Anchoring policy. An example of Location information is the serving cell-identifier of the UE.<br>
When VCC AS gets the IDP message from MSC, it extracts the Location information (ex: cell identifier), and checks for the Anchoring policy. Based on the result of the Anchoring policy, VCC AS sends Connect or Release to the VMSC as described in Step 4 of the Drawings.<br>
In abstract the present invention is characterized by the usage of location information of the UE in determining if the call is to be anchored or not.<br>
Advantages of the Invention<br>
•	A mechanism for the Network to take Anchoring decision based on UE's Location information.<br>
•	Reduce load on the VCC AS System.<br>
•	Minimize call set up time by avoiding anchoring at VCCAS.<br>
•	Take advantage of usage of Location information by VCC AS while executing Supplementary Services<br>
•	Idea is most effective when VCC user makes CS outgoing calls from areas where there is no Wi-Fi coverage. Example: Rural areas, Hilly areas.<br>
The description of the preferred embodiments is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to make or use the present invention. The various modifications to these embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the generic principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments without the use of the inventive faculty. Thus the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown herein but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and novel features disclosed herein.<br>
