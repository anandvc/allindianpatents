PLATINUM DERIVATIVE PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention pertains to the field of pharmaceutical compositions for-the treatment of neoplastic diseases and, particularly, it relates to pharmaceutical formulations comprising a platinum derivative.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention is directed to novel stable formulations of oxaliplatin, wherein lactic acid and/or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof serves as a novel means for preparing a dosage unit with an improved stability. -A method for manufacturing such formulations ready for administration and their use in antitumor therapy are also within the scope of the invention.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Oxaliplatin, also known as L-OHP,  is a third generation platinum complex.<br>
The term "oxaliplatin" as used herein, includes cis-oxalato (trans-1-1, 2-diaminocyclohexane) platinum(ll), its optic enatiomer cis-oxalato(trans-d-1,2-diaminocyclohexane) platinum(II) and any racemic mixture thereof. The term "oxaliplatin" also includes cis-oxalato(trans-1-1,2-diaminocyclohexane) platinum(II) having high optical purity, namely an optical purity equal to or higher than 99.5%, for example a cis-oxalato(trans-1-1,2-diaminocyclohexane) platjinum(II) , wherein the melting point is between 1988C and 292°C, obtained following the<br>
procedure described in Tanaka US patent No. 5,338,874 and, especially, a cis-oxalato (trans-1-1,2-cyclohexanediamine)platinum(II), which possesses optical purity of 99.94% or more and a melting point between 198.3°C and 199.7°C, obtained following the procedure disclosed in Tanaka US patent 5,420,319.<br>
Oxaliplatin has entered clinical development and achieved approval for marketing. During its development, oxaliplatin has aroused lively interest due, firstly, to its in vitro and in vivo antitumoral activity, especially in cisplatin-resistant  models  and cell  lines expressing resistance genes, and, secondly, to its good clinical tolerance, the absence of renal or auditory toxicity being combined with a low hematotoxicity. Combined with other antitumoral agent cytotoxic  agents   (5-FU,   raltitrexed,   irinotecan  or cisplatin),  oxaliplatin produces  an additive and often synergistic' cytotoxic effect.  The oxaliplatin-5FU + FA combination is now well established in the treatment of metastatic  colorectal cancer.  Regarding  its particular cytotoxic characteristics and its activity in mismatch repair deficient cells (which are resistant to cisplatin and carboplatin),  oxaliplatin has shown potential in a large variety of solid tumor types, notably in association with, other cytotoxic agents, thus opening the path to a wider range of indications.<br>

Debiopharm,   International  patent  application  No.  WO 01/15691, discloses stable solutions of oxaliplatin, ready for parenteral administration, containing 1,2-propane diol, glycerol, maltitol, sucrose, and/or inositol. BioNumerik,   US   6,066,666,   discloses   pharmaceutical formulations comprising a platinum analogue compound, e.g. oxaliplatin  and  a  protective  agent  having  either  a sulfhydryl moiety or being reducible disulfide. Bristol-Myers Squibb, International patent application WO 01/66102 discloses oral dosage forms for administration of the combination of tegafur + uracil (UFT), folinic acid, and oxaliplatin and methods of using the same. Sanofi-Synthelabo, US patent No. 6,306,902,  discloses a stable  oxaliplatin  solution  formulation  comprising  a therapeutically  effective  amount  of  oxaliplatin,  an effective stabilizing amount of a buffering agent and a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier wherein the buffering agent is oxalic acid or an alkali metal salt thereof. Bissery M.  C.,  US patent  application No.2001/0041712, discloses compositions and methods for treating tumors comprising administering CPT-ll with oxaliplatin. At present, oxaliplatin is solely marketed in the form of lyophilized preparations, which need to be reconstituted before administration. The currently marketed formulation is a lyophilized powder (50, 100 mg) to be reconstituted just before administration to a patient with water for injection or a 5% glucose solution and finally diluted with a 5% glucose solution (0.2 mg/ml final concentration). The lyophilized oxaliplatin can present some disadvantages, which do not render particularly attractive the use of this product in such a pharmaceutical form.<br>
Both the manufacturing and the reconstitution of such preparations expose the involved personnel (workers, pharmacists, medical personnel, nurses) to risks of contamination, which are particularly serious due to the toxicity of the antitumor substances. To administer a lyophilized preparation, double handling of the drug is required, the lyophilized cake having to be first reconstituted and then administered and, moreover, in some cases, the complete dissolution of the powder may require shaking.<br>
The risks connected with the manufacturing and the reconstitution of a lyophilized preparation would be highly reduced if a ready-to-use (RTU) solution of oxaliplatin, whose preparation and administration does not require sither lyophilization or reconstitution, were available. En order to meet the need for solution formulations of Dxaliplatin in a RTU form, able to overcome the above-iescribed disadvantages, some formulations have been<br>
already proposed, e.g., the Debiopharm and Sanofi-Synthelabo RTU formulations disclosed in the US patents No. 5,716,988 and 6,305,902, respectively. Both these formulations are reported to be stable RTU formulations containing oxalipatin.<br>
A desirable objective is therefore that the stability is further enhanced, and also that dosage forms can be suitably kept for a prolonged period.<br>
The present invention meets these objectives by providing oxaliplatin formulations in a RTU form, with superior stability properties versus the above-identified known RTU preparations. It has now surprisingly been found that the introduction of lactic acid and/or a pharmaceutical ly acceptable salt thereof as a stabilizing agent in an aqueous solution of oxaliplatin, serves as a novel method of making a formulation with an improved stability versus both the " RTU aqueous formulation disclosed in the Debiopharm US patents No. '5,716,988 and the aqueous solution stabilized with oxalic acid or an alkali metal salt thereof, disclosed in the Sanofi-Synthelabo US patent No. 6,306,902.<br>
