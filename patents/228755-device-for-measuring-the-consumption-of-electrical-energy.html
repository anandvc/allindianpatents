				<td>Description<br>
Device for Measuring the Consumption of Electrical Energy<br>
This invention pertains to a device for measuring the consumption of electrical energy.<br>
Measuring devices or energy meters for electrical energy, which in colloquial language is<br>
referred to as current meter or kilowatt-hour-meter (KWh-meter), serve the purpose of<br>
determining the electrical energy fed into an electrical supply network or the electrical energy<br>
drawn from an electrical supply network. For this, the electrical instantaneous power drawn<br>
by a consumer from the electrical supply network is integrated over the time. The<br>
instantaneous electrical power is thereby obtained from the product of the current and the<br>
voltage. Such types of electrical energy meters serve the purpose of electrical power supply<br>
companies, EVU, as the calculation basis for billing their clients, the consumers.<br>
In the document DE 198 42 241 Al, an electrical meter is given. This comprises of an<br>
integrated input module with analogous/digital-converter and a multiplier agent. Besides,<br>
there are also inputs for feeding voltage and current. It is further foreseen that during<br>
manufacture of the meter, compensation/equalisation information can be stored.<br>
In order to reduce the cost of drawing electrical energy, there are attempts on the part of the<br>
consumer to manipulate electrical energy meters in such a way, that an electrical energy<br>
lower than what is actually drawn is indicated. To safeguard against such undesired,<br>
manipulating interventions, the EVU puts seals on the energy meters. These however only<br>
have a limited protection effect.<br>
Particularly in case of modern, digitally working electrical energy meters produced on<br>
semiconductor base, a manipulation of the energy reading can be attempted by re-<br>
programming the concerned electronic components.<br>
It is the task of this invention to present a device for measuring the consumption of electrical<br>
energy, which on the one hand is integrated on a chip, and on the other hand, the protection<br>
against undesirable manipulation with the intention of reducing the measured energy quantity<br>
against the actually drawn quantity, is improved.<br><br>
This task is fulfilled as per the invention by'means of a device for the consumption of an<br>
electrical energy, which has the following:<br>
-	A first input for feeding a voltage signal;<br>
-	a second input for feeding a current signal;<br>
a multiplier which is coupled with the first and second inputs and which gives an<br>
intermediate signal at its output as a function of the voltage signal and current signal;<br>
-	a calibration block which is coupled with the output of the multiplier and with a non-<br>
volatile memory and multiplies the intermediate signal of the multiplier with a calibration<br>
factor;<br>
-	an integrator which is coupled with the calibration block and prepares a calibration energy<br>
measuring value at its output; and<br>
-	the non-volatile memory which comprises of several irreversible programmable memory<br>
cells for storing the calibration factor, in such a way that a re-programming of any random<br>
memory cell results in an increase of the calibration factor.<br>
The measuring device is also referred to below as meter circuit.<br>
According to the presented principle, electrical voltage and electrical current is fed at the first<br>
and second input, preferably as time-continuous and value-continuous analogous signals of<br>
the meter circuit. With the help of the multiplier, the instantaneous drawn electrical power is<br>
determined by multiplication of voltage and current. In the subsequently connected<br>
calibration block, the determined electrical power is multiplied by a calibration factor and<br>
finally, from the thus obtained calibrated instantaneous power value an energy measuring<br>
value is formed by means of integration over time or by accumulation of a final number of<br>
measured values of power.<br>
Calibration of an electrical energy meter is advantageous, as on account of production-related<br>
parameter fluctuations which could lead to value tolerances of components. Furthermore, on<br>
account of ageing-related drift effect and other reasons for standard variations, measuring<br>
errors could occur which would be undesirable.<br>
According to the above-mentioned principle, the non-volatile memory which is foreseen for<br>
storing the calibration factor, is designedin such a way that the subsequent re-programming<br>
of a random memory cell which is not covered by the non-volatile memory, could effect an<br><br>
increase in the calibration factor. The individual programmable memory cells are thereby<br>
programmable in an irreversible manner. Such types of irreversible programmable memory<br>
cells are known in the form of so-called fuses, as well as in the form of programmable diodes,<br>
which one can convert into a short circuit by overloading in the high-resistance direction, i.e.<br>
so-called Zener-zapping.<br>
Apart from the already mentioned components, obviously also other programmable cells can<br>
be used.<br>
Depending on the type of programmable memory cells used, the calibration factor to be<br>
derived in the non-volatile memory is coded according to the present principle in such a way,<br>
that in case of subsequent re-programming of the memory cells,"irrespective' of which <br>
selection of programmable memory cells are re-programmed, one constantly gets the effect of<br>
an increase in the calibration factor.<br>
Thus it is ensured that in case of unwanted tampering of the meter circuit with the intention of<br>
manipulating it in such a way that the meter indication is lower than the actually drawn<br>
electrical energy, one always has an increase of the measured quantity energy with respect to<br>
the actually supplied energy quantity.<br>
An increase in the calibration factor by subsequent re-programming of the memory cells<br>
accordingly leads to the situation, that the electrical meter shows more kilowatt hours than<br>
actually drawn, in any case not lesser.<br>
A calibration factor can, for example, be programmed during or immediately after production,<br>
or within the framework of an official calibration of the meter circuit.<br>
According to a preferred design of the present invention, the non-volatile memory comprises<br>
of the programming input for programming the memory cells. The programming of the<br>
memory cells can be done with a parallel or serial programming input of a programmable<br>
fixed value memory. As is usual in the case of such types of memory, addressing the<br>
individual memory cells can take place with the help of line-coders and split-end coders. The<br>
programmable memory cells are thereby arranged in a matrix form, e.g. in a quadratic matrix.<br><br>
According to a further preferred design form of the present invention, the programmable<br>
memory cells each comprise of a diode which on loading with an energy impulse goes over<br>
irreversibly into a low-resistance condition.<br>
Such types of programmable fixed value memories which one can transform by overloading<br>
in high-resistance direction from an electrical high-resistance condition into an electrical short<br>
circuit, are also known as anti-fuses. By using such programmable memory cells, according<br>
to the present principle, initially all programmable memory cells should ideally be in high-<br>
resistance condition. According to this principal, the lowest adjustable calibration factor is<br>
coded, in that all programmable memory cells are in high-resistance conducting condition,<br>
and the highest adjustable calibration factor is coded, in that all programme memory cells are<br>
in a low-resistance conducting condition. By means of reprogramming in an irreversible<br>
sequence from high-resistance to low-resistance conducting condition, the calibration factor<br>
can subsequently only be increased, however cannot be reduced. According to the present<br>
principle it is therefore insignificant whether only one, a certain selection or all the<br>
programmable memory cells get re-programmed.<br>
In an alternative, similarly preferred design form of the present invention, the programmable<br>
memory cells each comprise of a fuse, which on applying an energy impulse goes over<br>
irreversibly from a low-resistance to a high-resistance conducting condition. These fuses are<br>
generally designed with the help of thin metal bridges. On being subjected to energy impulse,<br>
e.g. a current impulse or voltage impulse, they go over irreversibly from a very low-resistance<br>
conducting condition to a practically unlimited high-resistance conducting condition.<br>
Regarding coding of the calibration factor, the following is subsequently true: the lowest<br>
adjustable calibration factor is coded, in that all fuses are in low-resistance conducting<br>
condition and the highest adjustable calibration factor is coded, in that all fuses or<br>
programmable memory cells are in a high-resistance conducting condition. According to the<br>
present invention, while coding the calibration factor one should subsequently take into<br>
account, that by irreversible transporting of a random memory cell or random selection of<br>
memory cells from low-resistance to the high-resistance conducting condition, constantly an<br>
increase in the calibration factor is effected.<br><br>
According to a further preferred design form of the present invention, a pulse generator is<br>
connected at the output of the integrator, which prepares a coded output signal proportional to<br>
the calibrated energy measured value provided at the output of the integrator.<br>
Accordingly, the coded output signal of the pulse generator is a measure for the electrical<br>
energy measured by the meter circuit, e.g. since a re-setting of the energy measured value in<br>
the integrator.<br>
According to a further preferred design form of the present invention, an analogous/digital<br>
converter is foreseen for each of the first and second inputs with the multiplier.<br>
The analogous/digital converter coupled with the first input of the meter circuit converts an<br>
analogous fed voltage signal into a digital voltage signal, which is available preferably time-<br>
discreet and value-discreet or at least value-discreet.<br>
Accordingly, the analogous/digital (A/D) converter coupled with the second input of the<br>
meter circuit converts the current signal which can be fed from the input side and which is<br>
available with the analogous signal into a digital signal which is present at least as value-<br>
discreet and preferably time-discreet and value-discreet. Apart from a quantification error<br>
which is unavoidable, the digital current and voltage signals which can be derived from the<br>
A/D converters on the output side are proportional to the analogous current and voltage<br>
signals fed to the input side. The A/D converters enable a quick, trouble-free and reliable<br>
working digital signal processing of the current and voltage signals, particularly their<br>
multiplication to an instantaneous power value, as well as with multiplication and calibration<br>
factor and finally the accumulation of the determined, calibrated power values in the<br>
integrator.<br>
According to a further preferred design form of the present invention, for coupling of the A/D<br>
converters and the multiplier a digital filter is provided, which is connected on the input side<br>
to the output of the respective analogous/digital converter and on the output side with one of<br>
the inputs of the multiplier.<br><br>
The advantage of the digital filters is that they allow a suppression of higher harmonics of the<br>
signals occurring during quantification in the A/D converters, which could lead to falsification<br>
in the measured result in the subsequently connected multipliers.<br>
According to a further preferred design form of the present invention, the non-volatile<br>
memory is designed for storing the calibration factor in binary coded manner.<br>
As the memory cells of programmable fixed value memories in relationship to their<br>
conducting conditions can generally assume only two logical conditions, either high-<br>
resistance or low-resistance, the binary coding is particularly suitable for coding the<br>
calibration factor by means of fixed value memories.<br>
According to a further preferred design form of the present invention, the meter circuit is<br>
designed as integrated and electronic circuit.<br>
According to a further preferred extension of the meter circuit, the non- volatile memory is<br>
designed in such a way that the calibration value which can be derived on the non-volatile<br>
memory can only assume positive values.<br>
The calibration value is stored in the non-volatile memory without any sign. The calibration<br>
values can thereby assume values from a range, e.g. between 0.5 and 2, which would then be<br>
multiplied by the measured instantaneous power values.<br>
Further details and advantageous extensions of the invention are part of the sub claims.<br>
The invention is explained below on the basis of a design example and the drawings. The<br>
following are shown:<br>
Fig. 1  A simplified block circuit diagram of a first, model design form of the meter circuit as<br>
per the invention on the basis of selected circuit blocks; and<br>
Fig. 2  the model coding of the calibration factor in the non-volatile memory in a meter circuit<br>
as shown in fig. 1 on the basis of selected calibration values.<br><br>
Fig. 1 shows a block circuit diagram of a meter circuit for electrical energy mounted as<br>
integrated circuit on a chip 1. This has a first input 2 for feeding a voltage signal u, a second<br>
input 3 for feeding a current signal i as well as an output 4 from which a calibrated measured<br>
value can be derived, which is a measure for an electrical energy quantity dependent on a<br>
current signal i and voltage signal u and integrated over a definite time.<br>
In details, the meter circuit comprises of two analogous/digital converters 5, 6 with an input<br>
each for feeding an analogous signal, which is connected to the first or second input 2, 3 of<br>
the meter circuit. On the output side of the analogous/digital converters 5, 6 respectively a<br>
digital filter 7, 8 is connected. The outputs of the digital filters 7, 8 are connected to an input<br>
of the digitally operating multiplier 9. The multiplier 9 prepares at its output an intermediate<br>
signal formed by multiplication of the current signal and voltage signal i, u, which is a<br>
measure for instantaneous electrical power, however not calibrated. The output of the mixer 9<br>
is connected to a calibrating block 10. The calibrating block 10 has a further multiplier 11<br>
with two inputs, out of which a first input is connected to the output of the multiplier 9 and a<br>
second input is connected to a non-volatile memory 12. The non-volatile memory 12<br>
comprises of several irreversible programmable memory cells 13. Furthermore, the non-<br>
volatile memory 12 comprises of a programming input 14 for programming the irreversible<br>
programmable memory cells 13. The output of the additional multiplier 11 in the calibrating<br>
block 10, on which a calibrated signal is readied, which represents instantaneous electrical<br>
power P, is connected to the input of an integrator 15 which integrates the instantaneous<br>
electrical power P over time and provides an energy meter value W at its output. The output<br>
of the integrator 15 is connected to the input of a pulse generator 16 which provides the actual<br>
energy measured value at its output 4.<br>
With the help of the electrical energy meter integrated on a chip, as shown in fig. 1, the actual<br>
electric power is constantly determined, which is obtained by the product of voltage signal u<br>
and current signal i. The voltage u is thereby generally the rated voltage of an electrical<br>
supply network, e.g. 230 volts AC. The actual electrical power derived from the voltage<br>
signal and current signal is provided at the output of the multiplier 9. With the calibrating<br>
block 10 the electrical power which is provided at the output of the multiplier 9 is multiplied<br>
with a calibration factor. This calibration factor helps to correct standard fluctuations<br>
internally on the chip bearing the meter circuit 1, as well as also externally, e.g. caused by line<br>
impedance. The calibration factor is determined after completion of the meter circuit during<br><br>
calibration of the electrical energy meter. Now the calibration factor is constantly multiplied<br>
by the actual electrical power in such a way, that at the output of the calibrating block 10 one<br>
obtains an electrical instantaneous power P corrected by the calibration factor. This corrected<br>
electrical instantaneous power P is continuously accumulated in the integrator 15. With the<br>
help of the calibration factor, subsequently especially production-related standard fluctuations<br>
from the component values of the integrated meter circuit 1 are compensated. In this way, the<br>
result of the energy meter reading, namely the accumulated energy measured value available<br>
at the output of the integrator 15 is significantly improved with respect to precision. The<br>
calibration factor is thereby stored in the non-volatile memory 12 in such a way that a<br>
subsequent changing of bits, i.e. a re-programming of individual programmable memory cells,<br>
irrespective of the selection of the re-programmed memory cells, always leads to an increase<br>
in the calibration factor and hence also to an increase in the electrical instantaneous power, so<br>
that any manipulation of the energy meter would not be of any advantage to a manipulator.<br>
The non-volatile memory 12 comprises of several irreversible programmable memory cells<br>
arranged in a matrix. Each of the programmable memory cells can assume one of two<br>
possible conditions, zero or one. It is a property of a non-volatile memory that the<br>
programmed conditions of the programmable memory cells can be retained even when a<br>
supply voltage of the meter circuit is switched off. The programmable memory cells are<br>
irreversible programmable, i.e. their memory condition which generally is present in the form<br>
of an electrical conducting condition, can only be programmed in one direction, for example<br>
from high-resistance to low-resistance or from low-resistance to high-resistance. Such types<br>
of non-volatile and irreversible programmable memory cells, depending on the design, are<br>
known as fuses or anti-fuses. The programmable memory cells 13 are realised in the present<br>
design example as diodes, which by overloading in high-resistance direction can be converted<br>
into a short circuit. Alternatively, one can however also use other programmable memory<br>
cells, e.g. floating-gate-mosfets, which is similarly suitable as PROM, Programmable Read<br>
Only Memory. In case of programmable floating-gate-mosfets of such types, the insulated<br>
floating gate is charged during programming, so that the threshold voltage of the mosfet shifts<br>
continuously.<br>
Fig. 2 shows on the basis of a design example the coding of the calibration factor in the non-<br>
volatile memory 12 which in this case comprises of 16 programmable memory cells. The<br>
starting condition of the programmable memory cells is a logical zero, which in the case of<br><br>
the application of diodes foreseen here represents a high-resistance conducting condition. In<br>
the table as shown in fig. 2, in the first column the calibration factor decimal is shown, in the<br>
second column the hexadecimal, in the third column the binary coded value, respectively for<br>
four example values, namely for the calibration factor 0.5; 1.0-1 LSB; 1.0 and 2.0-1 LSB.<br>
LSB denotes thereby the least value bit, the so-called Least Significant Bit. The available<br>
table accordingly shows a calibration factor which can be adjusted in a range from 0.5 to 2.0.<br>
This calibration factor, as already explained on the basis of the description of fig. 1, is<br>
continuously multiplied with the actual determined instantaneous power value. Of course, in<br>
practical realisations, several further calibration factors can be coded. Fig. 2 merely shows a<br>
selection of calibration factors on the basis of the table.<br>
The binary coding without any sign bit allows a simple multiplication. In the present<br>
example, in which the greatest adjustable calibration factor is 2.0 - 1 LSB, the decimal point<br>
of the binary coding is foreseen between both the maximum value bits. For example, the<br>
binary coded number 1100 could denote a decimal number 1.5 and a binary coded number<br>
1010 could denote a decimal number 1.25 etc.<br>
In the binary representation as shown in fig. 2, a logical zero corresponds to the starting<br>
condition of the irreversible programmable memory cell, whereas a logical one gives that<br>
condition which the memory cell has after carrying out an irreversible condition change, i.e.<br>
after a re-programming. One can identify that in the binary coding according to the table<br>
shown in fig. 2, a random re-programming of one or several memory cells, i.e. in the present<br>
case, condition transition from a zero to a one, always leads to an increase of the calibration<br>
factor.<br>
The principle in question is supposed to be made further clear on the basis of an additional<br>
coding example with four-bit-binary representation. One can assume that the original<br>
condition of the non-volatile memory for storing the calibration factor is 0000. As again<br>
between both the left bits, i.e. between both the maximum value bits, the comma-position is<br>
supposed to represent a decimal number, the bit sequence 1000 represents the decimal number<br>
1.0, so that the 1 has to be programmed. If any other random bit is changed, say within the<br>
framework of a manipulation attempt, e.g. the second bit, then the new binary represented<br>
calibration factor isl0l0 which denotes the decimal factor 1.25. One can identify that the<br>
calibration factor has increased.<br><br>
Alternative to the already presented, binary coding of the calibration factor, one could assume<br>
that the original condition of the non-volatile memory is represented by the binary, four-bit-<br>
word 1111 and a programming of the calibration factor is supposed to take place by changing<br>
the logical condition from one to zero. Accordingly, the logical one, on application of a diode<br>
as programmable element, would represent its high-resistance conducting condition. If in this<br>
case, for a calibration of an energy meter a decimal value of 1.375 is supposed to be set as<br>
calibration factor, then a bit sequence 1011 should be programmed. However, here one could<br>
for example make the second bit from the right to zero and thereby retain the number 1001,<br>
which could correspond to the decimal number 1.125. This calibration factor would however<br>
be lower, so that a manipulation attempt as desired by the manipulator would lead to a<br>
reduction of the indicated energy quantity. Thus a manipulation would work to the advantage<br>
of the manipulator.<br>
In case of an alternative use of a non-volatile memory which has irreversible programmable<br>
memory cell, in which however the initial condition of the programmable memory cells are<br>
indicated by logical ones, then on applying the present principle, this should be considered as<br>
inverted binary number, according to which the binary depicted calibration factor 0111 would<br>
represent the decimal number 1.0. If in this case any one bit is reprogrammed to zero, then<br>
accordingly the calibration factor will get similarly increased. Within the scope of the present<br>
invention, as an analogy to the already presented single phase meter, the meter circuit can be<br>
designed instead of the shown single-phase A.C. meter circuit also as three-phase meter<br>
circuit.<br>
Furthermore, the described principle can conversely also be extended for a measuring device<br>
for the feeding of electrical energy into a supply network, e.g. by the operator of a wind<br>
energy plant or a solar energy plant, in which case an intervention for manipulation would<br>
refer not to the reduction but to the increase of the calibration factor.<br><br>

4.	Device as per claim 1 or 2,<br>
in  which<br>
the programmable memory cells (12) each comprise of a fuse, which on being loaded<br>
with an energy impulse moves over irreversibly from a low-resistance into a high-<br>
resistance conducting condition.<br><br>
Device as per one of the claims 1 to 4,<br>
in  which<br>
at the output of the integrator (15) a pulse generator (16) is connected, which provides<br>
a coded output signal proportional to the calibrated energy measured valued (W).<br>
Device as per one of the claims 1 to 5,<br>
in  which<br>
for the coupling of the first and second input (2, 3) with the multiplier (9), an<br>
analogous/digital converter (5, 6) each is provided.<br>
Device as per claim 6,<br>
in  which<br>
for coupling the analogous/digital converter (5, 6) with the multiplier (9) a digital filter<br>
(7, 8) each is provided, which is connected on the input side with an output of the<br>
analogous/digital converter (5, 6) and on the output side respectively with an input of a<br>
multiplier (9).<br>
Device as per one of the claim 1 to 7,<br>
in  which<br>
the non-volatile memory (12) is designed to store the calibration factor in binary coded<br>
form.<br>
Device as per the one of the claim 1 to 8,<br>
in  which<br>
the device is designed as integrated circuit.<br>
Device as per one of the claim 1 to 9,<br>
in  which<br>
the non-volatile memory (12) is designed in such a way that the calibration factor<br>
derivable from the non-volatile memory (12) can assume only positive values.<br><br>
A device for measuring the consumption of electrical energy is presented, which starting from<br>
voltage signals and current signals (u, i) which can be fed to the inputs (2, 3) of the circuit,<br>
determines an actual power signal which with the help of a calibrating block (10) is multiplied<br>
by a calibration factor. This calibration factor is stored in a non-volatile, programmable fixed<br>
value memory (12) which comprises of several irreversible programmable memory cells (13).<br>
These are designed in such a way that irreversible re-programming of any random memory<br>
cell (12) would effect an increase in the calibration factor. Thus any eventual manipulation of<br>
the energy meter by re-programming the calibration factor, e.g. after an official calibration,<br>
would always lead to an increase of the measured value which would not be desired by the<br>
manipulator.</td>
