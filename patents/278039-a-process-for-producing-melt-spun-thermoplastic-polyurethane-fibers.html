				<td>MELT SPUN TPU FIBERS AND PROCESS<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION [0001]       this patent application claims priority from U S Provisional Application Serial No 60/461,473 filed on April 9, 2003<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002]       The present invention relates to thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) compositions for making melt spun elastic fibers, such as spandex   The invention also relates to process to produce melt spun TPU fibers where the run time is greatly increased before experiencing fiber breakage<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003]       The vast majority of TPU fibers are made by a dry spinning process involving dissolving the TPU m solvent  The melt spinning process to produce TPU fibers has several inherent advantages including less cost, less capital cost, and less environmental concerns as a result of not using volatile solvents<br>
[0004]       TPU compositions for making melt spun fibers contain a TPU polymer made from a hydroxyl terminated intermediate which is typically a polyether or polyester end capped with a hydroxyl group, a polyisocyanate, such as a dnsocyanate, and a hydroxyl terminated chain extender  The hydroxyl temiinated intermediate forms the soft segment of the TPU polymer while the polyisocyanate and the chain extender forms the hard segment of the TPU polymer  The combination of soft and hard segments give the TPU polymer elastic properties. The TPU polymer is also frequently lightly cross linked by using a pre-polymer end capped with a polyisocyanate   The cross linking material is added to the melted TPU polymer during spinning<br>
[0005]       Polyester and polyether based TPU have both been used m melt spinning TPU fibers   Polyether based TPU fibers can be made to have higher heat resistance and have better hydrolytic stability than TPU fibers made from polyester based TPU [0006]       Polyether TPU fibers have better properties if the polyether hydroxyl terminated intermediate used to make the TPU is higher m molecular weight<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, polyether TPU's using a higher molecular weight hydroxyl terminated intermediate tend to have a shorter run time before experiencing pressure build up in the spinneret, thus leading to fiber breakage   When fibers break in a spinning operation, the production line must be shut down and the spinneret cleaned   this is a costly down time and production is lost<br>
[0007] It would be desirable to be able to use TPU polymers which are made from a polyether intermediate having higher molecular weight while retaining the long run time of TPU made with a low molecular weight polyether intermediate<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0008]       Figure 1 is a graph showing spin pack pressure vs time during melt spinning fibers from a TPU polymer with crosslmkmg agent added  The same TPU polymer is used and one run is crosshnked with a polyether crosslmkmg agent (comparative) and the other run is crosshnked with a polyester crosslmkmg agent (this invention)   The y axis of the graph shows pressure buildup m Kg force per square cm , while the x axis of the graph shows melt spin running time in hours<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0009]       It is an object of the present invention to be able to use a thermoplastic (TPU) made from a higher molecular weight polyether hydroxyl terminated intermediate for melt spinning TPU fibers while achieving long run times before experiencing fiber breakage<br>
[0010]       The TPU polymer comprises the reaction of (a) at least one hydroxyl terminated polyether intermediate having a number average molecular weight of at least 1200 Daltons, preferably from 1500 to 4000 Daltons, and more preferably 1800 to 2500 Daltons, (b) at least one polyisocyanate, preferably a dusocyanate; and (c) at least one hydroxyl terminated chain extender<br>
[0011]       The TPU polymer is lightly crosshnked by adding at least one crosslmkmg agent made from (a) a hydroxyl terminated polyol selected from the group consisting of polyester, polycaprolactone, and polycarbonate and (b) a polyisocyanate  Preferably, the polyol is a polyester polyol and the polyisocyanate is a dusocyanate  The crosslmkmg<br>
<br>
agent has an isocyanate functionality greater than 1 0 and preferably from about 1.5 to<br>
2 5 and more preferably an isocyanate functionality of about 1 8 to 2 2.<br>
[0012]       Melt spun TPU fibers are made by melting the TPU polymer in an extruder<br>
and adding the crosslmking agent to the melted TPU  The TPU polymer melt with<br>
crosslmkmg agent is fed to a spinneret. The melt exits the spinneret in the form of fibers<br>
The fibers are cooled and wound onto bobbins<br>
[0013]       The process using a polyether TPU together with a non-polyether crosshnker<br>
exhibits much less pressure buildup m the spinneret thus allowing the melt spun fibers to<br>
be made in a continuous process for extended periods of time without fiber breakage<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0014]       in the prior art method of adding a crosslmking agent to a TPU polymer to make melt spun TPU fibers, it is customary to use an isocyanate terminated polyether pre-polymer if the TPU polymer is a polyether TPU  Likewise, if a polyester TPU polymer is used, it is customary to use an isocyanate terminated polyester pre-polymer for the crosslmking agent<br>
[0015]       Applicants have unexpectedly found that when using a polyether TPU, a non-polyether crosslmkmg agent gives superior processing features for melt spinning fibers It has been found that the segmented polyether TPU polymer when combined with a non-polyether crosslmking agent allows the polyether TPU to be melt spun for extended periods of time without excessive pressure building up in the spin pack of the spinneret Excessive pressure results m fiber breakage, thus requinng the melt spinning operation to be halted until the spin pack can be cleaned<br>
[0016]       To produce the melt-spun fibers according to this invention, it is required to have a polyether TPU and a non-polyether crosslmking agent [0017]       The polyether TPU used can be made by reacting a polyether hydroxyl terminated intermediate with a polyisocyanate and a chain extender [0018]       Hydroxyl terminated polyether intermediates are polyether polyols derived from a diol or polyol having a total of from 2 to 15 carbon atoms, preferably an alkyl diol or glycol which is reacted with an ether comprising an alkylene oxide having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms, typically ethylene oxide or propylene oxide or mixtures thereof For<br>
<br>
example, hydroxyl functional polyether can be produced by first reacting propylene glycol with propylene oxide followed by subsequent reaction with ethylene oxide Primary hydroxyl groups resulting from ethylene oxide are more reactive than secondary hydroxyl groups and thus are preferred. Useful commercial polyether polyols include poly(ethylene glycol) comprising ethylene oxide reacted with ethylene glycol, poly(propylene glycol) comprising propylene oxide reacted with propylene glycol, poly(tetramethyl glycol) comprising water reacted with tetrahydrofuran (PTMG) Polytetramethylene ether glycol (PTMEG) is the preferred polyether intermediate Polyether polyols further include polyamide adducts of an alkylene oxide and can include, for example, ethylenediamme adduct comprising the reaction product of ethylenediamme and propylene oxide, diethylenetnamine adduct comprising the reaction product of diethylenetnamine with propylene oxide, and similar polyamide type polyether polyols   Copolyethers can also be utilized in the current invention   Typical copolyethers include the reaction product of THF and ethylene oxide or THF and propylene oxide   These are available from BASF as Poly THF B, a block copolymer, and poly THF R, a random copolymer  The various polyether intermediates generally have a number average molecular weight (Mn), as determined by assay of the terminal functional groups which is an average molecular weight greater than 1200, such as from about 1200 to about 10,000, desirably from about 1500 to about 5,000, and preferably from about 1800 to about 2500 Daltons<br>
[0019]       The second necessary ingredient to make the TPU polymer of this invention is a polyisocyanate<br>
[0020]       The polyisocyanates of the present invention generally have the formula R(NCO)n where n is generally from 2 to 4 with 2 being highly preferred inasmuch as the composition is a thermoplastic  Thus, polyisocyanates having a functionality of 3 or 4 are utilized in very small amounts, for example less than 5% and desirably less than 2% by weight based upon the total weight of all polyisocyanates, inasmuch as they cause crosshnkmg  R can be aromatic, cycloahphatic, and aliphatic, or combinations thereof generally having a total of from 2 to about 20 carbon atoms   Examples of suitable aromatic dnsocyanates include diphenyl methane-4, 4'-dnsocyanate (MDI), H12 MDI, m-xylylene dnsocyanate (XDI), m-tetramethyl xylylene dnsocyanate (TMXDI), phenylene-<br>
<br>
1,4-dnsocyanate (PPDI), 1,5-naphthalene dusocyanate (NDI), and diphenylmethane-3, 3'-dimethoxy-4, 4'-dnsocyanate (TODI)   Examples of suitable aliphatic dusocyanates include isophorone dusocyanate (IPDI), 1,4-cyclohexyl dusocyanate (CHDI), hexamethylene dusocyanate (HDI), l,6-diisocyanato-2,2,4,4-tetramethyl hexane (TMDI), 1,10-decane dusocyanate, and trans-dicyclohexylmethane dusocyanate (HMDI)   A highly preferred dusocyanate is MDI containing less than about 3% by weight of ortho-para (2,4) isomer<br>
[0021]       The third necessary ingredient to make the TPU polymer of this invention is the chain extender   Suitable chain extenders are lower aliphatic or short chain glycols having from about 2 to about 10 carbon atoms and include for instance ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, 1,3-butanediol, and 1,5-pentanediol  Aromatic glycols can also be used as the chain extender  Benzene glycol and xylenene glycols are suitable chain extenders for use m making the TPU of this invention. Xylenene glycol is a mixture of 1,4-di(hydroxymethyl) benzene and 1,2-di(hydroxymethyl) benzene   Benzene glycol is the preferred aromatic chain extender and specifically includes hydroquinone, 1 e , bis(beta-hydroxyethyl) ether also known as 1,4-di(2-hydroxyethoxy) benzene, resorcmol, l e , bis(beta-hydroxyethyl) ether also known as l,3-di(2-hydroxyethyl) benzene, catechol, l e , bis(beta-hydroxyethyl) ether also known as 1,2-di(2-hydroxyethoxy) benzene, and combinations thereof A blend of two or more glycol chain extenders may be used   The most preferred chain extender is 1,4-butanediol.<br>
[0022]       The above three necessary ingredients (polyether intermediate, polyisocyanate, and chain extender) are preferably reacted in the presence of a catalyst [0023]       Generally, any conventional catalyst can be utilized to react the dusocyanate with the polyether intermediate or the chain extender and the same is well known to the art and to the literature   Examples of suitable catalysts include the various alkyl ethers or alkyl thiol ethers of bismuth or tin wherein the alkyl portion has from 1 to about 20 carbon atoms with specific examples including bismuth octoate, bismuth laurate, and the like  Preferred catalysts include the various tin catalysts such as stannous octoate, dibutyltin dioctoate, dibutyltm dilaurate, and the like  The amount of such catalyst is<br>
<br>
generally small such as from about 20 to about 200 parts per million based upon the total weight of the polyurethane forming monomers<br>
[0024]       The polyether TPU polymers of this invention can be made by any of the conventional polymerization methods well known in the art and literature [0025]       Thermoplastic polyurethanes of the present invention are preferably made via a "one shot" process wherein all the components are added together simultaneously or substantially simultaneously to a heated extruder and reacted to form the polyurethane. The equivalent ratio of the dnsocyanate to the total equivalents of the hydroxyl terminated polyether intermediate and the diol chain extender is generally from about 0 95 to about 1.10, desirably from about 0 98 to about 1 05, and preferably from about 0 99 to about 1.03   The equivalent ratio of the hydroxyl terminated polyether to the hydroxyl terminated chain extender is generally from 0 5 to about 1 5 and preferably from about 0 70 to about 1   Reaction temperatures utilizing urethane catalyst are generally from about 175°C to about 245°C and preferably from about 180°C to about 220°C   The molecular weight (Mw) of the thermoplastic polyurethane is generally from about 150,000 to about 800,000 and desirably from about 200,000 to about 400,000 and preferably about 250,000 to about 350,000 as measured by GPC relative to polystyrene standards.<br>
[0026]       The thermoplastic polyurethanes can also be prepared utilizing a pre-polymer process   in the pre-polymer route, the hydroxyl terminated polyether intermediate is reacted with generally an equivalent excess of one or more polyisocyanates to form a pre-polymer solution having free or unreacted polyisocyanate therein  Reaction is generally earned out at temperatures of from about 80°C to about 220°C and preferably from about 150°C to about 200°C in the presence of a suitable urethane catalyst Subsequently, a selective type of chain extender as noted above is added in an equivalent amount generally equal to the isocyanate end groups as well as to any free or unreacted dnsocyanate compounds   The overall equivalent ratio of the total dnsocyanate to the total equivalent of the hydroxyl terminated polyether and the chain extender is thus from about 0 95 to about 1 10, desirably from about 0 98 to about 1 05 and preferably from about 0 99 to about 1 03   The equivalent ratio of the hydroxyl terminated polyether to the chain extender is generally from about 0 5 to about 1 5 and desirably from about 0 7<br>
to about 1   The chain extension reaction temperature is generally from about 180°C to about 250°C with from about 200°C to about 240°C being preferred   Typically, the pre-polymer route can be earned out m any conventional device with an extruder being preferred   Thus, the polyether intermediate is reacted with an equivalent excess of a dusocyanate m a first portion of the extruder to form a pre-polymer solution and subsequently the chain extender is added at a downstream portion and reacted with the pre-polymer solution  Any conventional extruder can be utilized, with extruders equipped with barrier screws having a length to diameter ratio of at least 20 and preferably at least 25.<br>

column is used to separate the by-product glycol from the reaction mixture   The byproduct glycol is taken off the top of the column and the unreacted alkylene carbonate and glycol reactant are returned to the reaction vessel as reflux   A current of inert gas or an inert solvent can be used to facilitate removal of by-product glycol as it is formed When amount of by-product glycol obtained indicates that degree of polymerization of the hydroxyl terminated polycarbonate is in the range of 2 to 10, the pressure is gradually reduced to 0 1 to 10 mm Hg and the unreacted glycol and alkylene carbonate are removed. this marks the beginning of the second stage of reaction during which the low molecular weight hydroxyl terminated polycarbonate is condensed by distilling off glycol as it is formed at 100°C to 300°C, preferably 150°C to 250°C and at a pressure of 0 1 to 10 mm Hg until the desired molecular weight of the hydroxyl terminated polycarbonate is attained   Molecular weight (Mn) of the hydroxyl terminated polycarbonates can vary from about 500 to about 10,000 but m a preferred embodiment, it will be in the range of 500 to 2500<br>
[0038]       The crosslmkmg agents have a number average molecular weight (Mn) of from about 1,000 to about 10,000, preferably from about 1,500 to about 4,000 and more preferably from about 1,800 to about 2,800<br>
[0039]       The weight percent of crosslinking agent used with the TPU polymer is from about 5 0% to about 20%, preferably about 8 0% to about 17%, and more preferably from about 10% to about 17%  The percentage of crosslinking agent used is weight percent based upon the total weight of TPU polymer and crosslinking agent. [0040]       The melt spinning process to make TPU fibers involves feeding a preformed TPU polymer, usually which is melted m the extruder and the crosslmkmg agent is added continuously downstream near the point where the TPU melt exits the extruder or after the TPU melt exits the extruder  The crosslmkmg agent can be added to the extruder before the melt exits the extruder or after the melt exits the extruder  If added after the melt exits the extruder, the crosslinking agent needs to be mixed with the TPU melt using static or dynamic mixers to assure proper mixing of the crosslinking agent into the TPU polymer melt  After exiting the extruder, the melted TPU polymer with crosslinking agent flows into a manifold   The manifold divides the melt stream into different streams, where each stream is fed to a plurality of spinnerets   Usually, there is<br>
<br>
a melt pump for each different stream flowing from the manifold, with each melt pump feeding several spinnerets. The spinneret will have a small hole through which the melt is forced and exits the spinneret m the form of a fiber  The size of the hole in the spinneret will depend on the desired size (denier) of the fiber  The fiber is drawn or stretched as it leaves the spinneret and is cooled before winding onto bobbins   The fibers are stretched by winding the bobbins at a higher speed than that of fiber exiting the spinneret  For the melt spun TPU fibers, the bobbins are usually wound at a rate of 4 to 6 times the speed of the fiber exiting the spinneret, but can be wound slower or faster depending on the particular equipment. Typical bobbin winding speeds can vary from 100 to 3000 meters per minute, but more typical speeds are 300 to 1200 meters per minute for TPU melt spun fibers  Finish oils, such as silicone oils, are usually added to the surface of the fibers after cooling and just prior to being wound into bobbins [0041]       An important aspect of making melt spun TPU fibers is the time one can run the process continuously without stopping  The necessity to stop the process is usually a result of fiber breaking  Fiber breaking occurs when the pressure at the spinneret increases to an unacceptable level  When the pressure reaches about 140 to 200 Kg force per square cm , fiber breakage will usually occur  Pressure buildup can occur for several reasons such as improper mixing leading to formation of products due to self reaction of the crosslmkmg agent causing partial blockage of the small exit hole m the spinneret for the fiber  The present invention allows for much longer run times before exceeding harmful pressure resulting m fiber breakage<br>
[0042]       Melt spun TPU fibers can be made in a variety of denier  Denier is a term m the art designating the fiber size  Denier is the weight in grams of 9000 meters of fiber length  Typical melt spun TPU fibers are made m a denier size of 240 or less, more typical from 20 to 240 denier size, with 20 denier being a popular size [0043]       The elastic TPU fibers are used to combine by knitting or weaving with other fibers such as natural and synthetic fibers to make various articles of clothing   The TPU fibers can be dyed various colors<br>
[0044]       The invention will be better understood by reference to the following examples<br>
 <br>
EXAMPLES [0045]       Example 1 shows the making of a polyether TPU polymer using PTMEG as the hydroxyl terminated polyether polyol, MDI as the polyisocyanate, and 1,4-butanediol as the chain extender  The one shot process described above was used to make the TPU of Example 1   The TPU polymer from Example 1 was used in Examples 2-6 for the melt spinning trials   Example 2 is a comparative example using a polyether crosshnking agent while Examples 3-6 uses a polyester crosshnking agent according to this invention<br>
EXAMPLE 1 [0046]       Polyether polyol PTMEG of molecular weight 2000 Daltons is charged into a heated (90°C) and agitated tank blended with based on 100 parts by weight of the final polymer weight, with 0 3 parts by weight antioxidant and 0 3 parts by weight UV stabilizer  A second preheated tank was charged with the chain extender, 1,4-butanediol, and kept at 50°C  A third preheated agitated tank contained 4,4'-methylenebisphenyhsocyanate (MDI)   The ingredients of the three tanks were metered accurately into the throat of a 40mm co-rotating twin-screw extruder reactor made by Werner &amp; Pfleiderer Corp , Ramsay, NJ   The extruder had 11 barrel sections which were heated between 190°C to 205°C   The end of the extruder was coupled to an underwater pelletizer after a six hole die equipped with screen packs   The following formulation was run continuously by metering 25 07 parts by weight of MDI, 5 82 parts by weight of 1 ,-4-butanediol and 68 5 parts by weight of polyol (PTMEG)   Extruder throughput was adjusted to 150 lbs/hr while from a separate small tank 50 ppm (based on polymer) of stannous octoate catalyst was injected into the polyol stream  The polyether TPU product was underwater pelletized and collected m a heated silo at 105°C to dry the product for three hours    The polyether TPU product produced in this way was used in Examples 2-6 to make melt spun TPU fibers   The TPU polymer had a Mw of 300,000 Daltons<br>
<br>
EXAMPLE2 (Comparative) [0047]       The TPU polymer of Example 1 was pre-dned in a vacuum batch dryer at 80°C for 12 hours   After drying the TPU polymer was melted in a 1 25 inch single screw extruder with an L/D ratio of 24   The back pressure at the extruder outlet was kept constant with a loop control. The extruder had four heating zones that were maintained between 180°C and 219°C   On exiting the extruder, the TPU polymer melt was mixed with 13 1 % by weight of a polyether pre-polymer crosslinkmg agent (Hyperlast 5196) having a number average molecular weight of 1500   The crosslinkmg agent was pumped at a constant flow rate from a holding tank   The crosslinkmg agent was mixed with the TPU polymer melt m a dynamic mixer and then pumped through a manifold to 32 spinnerets   Each spinneret had an orifice size of 0 5 mm   The polymer stream exiting the spinneret was cooled by air and the fiber formed was wound into a bobbin at a winding speed of 480 meters per mmute. The fiber on the bobbins were heat aged at 80°C for 24 hours before testing.<br>
[0048]       The fiber produced was 20 denier in size   The pressure at the spinneret was measured during the run  Figure 1 shows a graph of the pressure buildup during the run The data shows that the spin pack pressure force at the start of the run was about 30 Kg/cm . After 21 hours of continuously running the pressure had increased to about 45 Kg/cm and thereafter proceeded to rise rapidly reaching 100 Kg/cm after 31 hours After 50 hours, the spin pack pressure reached 180 Kg/cm2 and several of the fibers started to break   The run was stopped after 50 hours because of fiber breakage<br>
EXAMPLE 3 [0049]       this Example is presented to show that the polyester crosslinkmg agent gives much less spin pack pressure buildup than the polyether crosslinkmg agent used in Example 2<br>
[0050]       The TPU polymer, the melt spinning equipment and conditions were as described above in Example 2   The only difference was the crosshnking agent used   in this Example, 14 0 weight percent of a polyester crosslinkmg agent was used   The polyester crosslinkmg agent used was Diprane® 5128 from Hyperlast Company which has a number average molecular weight of 2500<br>
<br>
[0051]       The fiber produced was 20 denier and at the same speed as in Example 1 (480 meters per minute)<br>
[0052]       The spin pack pressure force was measured during the run   Figure 1 shows a graph of the pressure buildup during the run  The data show the spin pack pressure force at the start of the run was about 15 Kg/cm    After about 8 hours, the spin pack pressure increased to 20 Kg/cm    The run was continued for a total of 110 hours and the spin pack pressure remained at 20 Kg/cm    There was no fiber breakage and the run was stopped after 110 hours because the starting material was all consumed [0053]       in comparing Examples 2 and 3, it can be seen that the difference in melt spmabihty is quite surprising when using a polyester crosshnking agent versus a polyether crosshnking agent with the same base TPU polymer  The polyether crosshnking agent (Example 2) could only be run continuously for about 50 hours before getting fiber breakage, whereas the polyester crosshnking agent ran for 110 hours with no fiber breakage and a pressure buildup of only 20 Kg/cm    It is believed that since the polyester crosshnking agent (Example 3) did not buildup any increased pressure for the last 100 hours, it could likely have run for a much longer time, if there had been sufficient material available to continue the run<br>
[0054]       The 20 denier TPU melt spun fibers produced by Example 3 were tested for their elastic properties  Fiber tensile properties were measured using Table Top Model 5564 Instron equipped with tension/compression load cell (ION maximum static load capacity) and pneumatic yarn grips to prevent fiber slippage and "at grip" breaks [0055]       The test procedure employed was that developed by DuPont for elastic yarns used m garments requiring either good recovery from stretch or good holding power this test subjects fibers to a series of 5 cycles   in each cycle, the fiber is alternately stretched to 300% elongation, and relaxed using a constant extension rate (between the original gage length and 300% elongation)   The % set is measured after completion of the 5   cycle   Then, the fiber specimen is taken through a 6   cycle and stretched to breaking   The instrument records the load at each extension, the highest load before breaking, and the breaking load m units of grams force per denier as well as the breaking elongation and elongation at the maximum load<br>
[0056]       The test conditions were at 23°C ± 2°C; 50% ± 5% humidity  Fiber length of the test specimens were 50 0 mm and the linear density was 20 60 denier  Four specimens were tested. The results are shown in Table I<br>
TABLE I<br>
<br>
(Table removed)<br>
<br>
All of the above data are a mean value for 4 specimens tested<br>
[0057]       From the above data, it can be seen that the melt spun fibers have excellent elastic properties<br>
EXAMPLE 4 [0058]       this Example is presented to show that a polyester crosshnker of neopentyl glycol adipate, which has a branched glycol component (neopentyl glycol), gives long melt spinning run times with no fiber breakage<br>
[0059]       The TPU polymer of Example 1 was used and melt spun fibers (20 denier) were made on a melt spinning fiber pilot line smaller than that used m Examples 2 and 3 The polyester crosslinkmg agent used was Diprane 5253 (Hyperlast Company) which is a neopentyl glycol adipate intermediate reacted with MDI to form a pre-polymer having<br>
 <br>
a number average molecular weight (Mn) of 2500   During the melt spinning, 14 0 weight percent of the polyester crosshnking agent was added to the TPU polymer [0060]       Melt spinning was conducted for 100 hours with no fiber breakage  The run was terminated due to lack of further material<br>
EXAMPLE 5 [0061]       this Example is presented to show that a polyester crosshnker using a 50/50 mole percent of a combination of a branched glycol (neopentyl glycol) with a straight chain glycol (1,4-butadiene diol) reacted with adipic acid, gives long melt spinning run time with no fiber breakage<br>
[0062]       The TPU polymer of Example 1 was used and melt spun fibers (20 denier) were made on the same melt spinning fiber pilot line as in Example 4   The polyester crosshnking agent used was adipic acid reacted with a 50/50 mole percent of neopentyl glycol and 1,4-butanediol and reacted with MDI to form a pre-polymer having a number average molecular weight (Mn) of 2500   During the melt spinning, 14 0 weight percent of the polyester crosshnking agent was added to the TPU polymer [0063]       Melt spinning was conducted for 100 hours with no fiber breakage   The run was terminated due to lack of further material<br>
EXAMPLE 6 [0064]       this Example is presented to show that a polyester crosshnker using a 50/50 mole percent of a combination of a branched glycol (neopentyl glycol) with a straight chain glycol (1,6-hexanediol) reacted with adipic acid, gives long melt spinning run time with no further breakage.<br>
[0065]       The TPU polymer of Example 1 was used and melt spun fibers (20 denier) were made on the same melt spinning fiber pilot line as m Examples 4 and 5 -The polyester crosshnking agent used was adipic acid reacted with a 50/50 mole percent of neopentyl glycol and 1,6-hexanediol and reacted with MDI to form a pre-polymer having a number average molecular weight (Mn) of 2500   During the melt spinning, 14 0 weight percent of the polyester crosshnking agent was added to the TPU polymer<br>
<br>
[0066]       Melt spinning was conducted for 100 hours with no fiber breakage   The run was terminated due to lack of further material<br>
