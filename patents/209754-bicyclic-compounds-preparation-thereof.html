Bicyclic compounds, preparation thereof and use in pharmaceutical compositions Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to novel bi-cyclic compounds useful in pharmaceutical compositions as tachykinins antagonists, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them • Background of the invention<br>
The receptor NK2 of tachykinins is widely expressed in the peripheral nervous system of Mammalia. One of the several effects caused by the selective stimulation of the receptor NK2 is the contraction of the smooth muscles. Therefore, antagonists of the receptor NK2 can be considered agents able to control the hypercontraction of the smooth muscles in any patological condition in which the release of the tachykinins contributes to the rise of the corrispondent disorder. In particular, the bronchospastic component of asthma, cough, pulmonary irritations and local spasms of the urinary bladder and of the ureter during cystitis, infections and renal colics can be considered conditions in which the administration of receptor NK2 antagonists can be effective (A.L. Magnan et al. Neuvopeptides, 1993. 24, 199)- Compounds which act as antagonists of the tachykinins, and in particular of the neurokinin A, are well-known in Literature. Among them, the cyclic compounds (B. J. Williams et al. J. Med. Chem. , 1993. 36, 2) are of particular interest. Lipophily has been defined as an essential requirement in order to have an intensive antagonist activity to the receptor NK2 of the tachykinins of a series of cyclic pseudopeptides (L. Quartara et al. J. Med. Chem. , 1994. 27) and<br><br>
-   2   -<br>
particularly   in   case   of   bicyclic      hexapeptides.    WO/93/21227).<br>
Surprisingly  it  has  been now  found  that products   structurally  similar<br>
to   those     described   above,   but   in   which,   however,   at   least   one<br>
hydrophilic   group   is   present,   not   only   keep   their   high   affinity   in<br>
vitro,   but   also   show  an   increase   in   the  pharmacological   activity   in<br>
vivo  if  compared   to  the  corrispondent  compounds  which do  not  contain<br>
any hydrophilic group.<br>
This   is   even   more   surprising   if   it   is   taken   into   account   that<br>
monocyclic  peptides  having antagonist properties  which  are  similar  to<br>
those    of    the    tachykinins    do    not    show    any    increase    in    the<br>
pharmacological   activity  when  hydrophilic   groups   are   introduced  onto<br>
the structure of the cycle [Int.  J.  Peptide Protein Res.   (1984),  44:2,<br>
105-111].<br>

Compounds of formula (I) object of the present invention can be synthetized by the various techniques known in Literature, see e.g. M. Bodansky, "Peptide Chemistry", Springer-Verlag, 1988. For example by means of in solution synthesis of the linear peptidic chain through subsequent coupling of suitably activated N-protected amino acids to an amino acid or to a C-protected peptidic chain, with isolation of the intermediates, subsequent selective de-protection of the C- and N-terminal chains, cyclization in polar organic solvents in diluted solution, hence selective de-protection of the side chains and at last cyclization of the same in polar organic solvents in diluted solution. The hydrophilic residue can be introduced both as protected amino acid derivative during the peptidic chain synthesis and by means of conjugation to the already formed peptide, as widely disclosed in Literature. Similarly a synthesis in solid phase of the peptidic chain from the C-terminal end to the N-terminal one on a insoluble polymeric support, the cyclization in solid phase between the previously de-protected side chains, the subsequent detachment from the polymeric support by means of hydrolysys in anhydrous hydrofluoric acid containing the suitable scavengers or in trifluoracetic acid containing the suitable scavengers or in aqueous bases and the cyclization of the raonocyclic peptide in polar organic solvents in diluted solution, can be used for the preparation. The hydrophilic residue being introduced according to the above disclosed indications. According to a particular preparation method, the desired product can be obtained in solid phase using the 2-chlorotrytil resin (Barlos et al.. Int. J.Peptide Protein Res., 37. 513-520, 1991) substituted with a protected amino acid having the Fmoc group at the N-terminal end;<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
preferably the amino acid directly bond to the resin is the one having the R1 or R3 side chain. After the other amino acids being introduced in the sequence, the peptide is detached from the resin with diluted acetic acid and a first cyclization is performed between the free C-terminal and N-terminal end by means of the conventional classic synthesis methods. Subsequently, the amino acid side chains are de-protected in position 5 and 6, for example with trifluoracetic acid, and way is given to the second cyclization.<br>
Other synthetic ways are anyway possible and largely described in Literature as above mentioned.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) as above indicated have revealed to be powerful antagonists of the receptor NK2 of the tachykinins, and hence may be administered in doses which are not higher than those required for the known products.<br>
They can be therefore indicated for the treatment of arthritis, asthma, inflammations, tumoral growth, gastro-intestinal hypermotility, Huntington's desease, neurites, neuralgia, hemicrania, hypertension, urinary incontinence, urticaria, symptoms from carcinoid desease, flu and colds.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) object of the present invention are suitable for the parenteral, oral, inhalatory and sublingual administration for therapeutical purposes to the superior animals and to the humans, achieving pharmacological effects according to the above described features. For parenteral administrations {endovenous, intramuscular and intradermic) sterile solutions or<br>

BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY<br>
The capability of the compounds of the present invention to interact<br><br>
-   19   -<br>
as agonists or antagonists with the neurokynin A (NKA) receptor has been valued in a in vitro test using the pulmonary artery of a rabbit (RPA) (Rovero et al., Neuropeptides, 1989, 13, 263-270) and their activity was determined as pKB (antilogarythm of the dissociation constant), as described in Jenkinson et al., TiPS, 12, 53-56, 1991- For example, compound 2 has shown a pKB = 8.67. The capability of the products of the present invention to interact as agonists or antagonists with NKA receptor has been valued in vivo as capability,    after   intravenous   administration,to   inhibit   the   agonist<br><br>
[betaAla8 ] NKA (4-10)-induced contractions of the urinary bladder in<br>
the anaesthetized mouse, as described in Maggi et al., J. Pharmacol.<br>
Exp. Ther., 1991, 257. 1172. Compound 1, e.g., causes, at dose of 10<br>
nmol/Kg i.v., an inhibitory effect of 50-70 %, as it has been valued<br>
