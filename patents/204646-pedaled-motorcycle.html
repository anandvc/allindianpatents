COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"PEDALED MOTORCYCLE"<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the<br>
invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-	<br><br>
The present invention relates to a pedaled motorcycle.<br>
[Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a pedaled motorcycle, and particularly to a pedaled motorcycle which comprises a pedal shaft capable of transmitting a ...<br><br>
tread force inputted from pedals provided at both ends thereof to a rear wheel, and an engine having a crankshaft rotated in an axis parallel to the pedal shaft and capable of transmitting rotational power to the rear wheel, and in which the crankshaft having at least a pair of crank weights is supported on an engine case of the engine, and the pedal shaft is rotatably supported on the engine case. [0002]<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
Hitherto, such a pedaled motorcycle as above has been known, for example, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 8-108875, in which a crankshaft and a pedal shaft are supported in common on an engine case possessed by the engine, thereby contriving reductions in the size and weight of the motorcycle. [0003]<br>
[Problems to Be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In the conventional pedaled motorcycle as above-mentioned, generally, the engine main body is mounted on the vehicle body frame through a rubber mount to ensure that the vibration of the engine is hardly transmitted to the vehicle body frame, and the intermediate presence of the elastic member between the engine case supporting the<br><br>
pedal shaft and the vehicle body frame makes it difficult to secure the feeling of rigidity when the rider treads on the pedals. [0004]<br>
The present invention has been made in consideration of the above situations, and it is an object of the invention to provide a pedaled motorcycle such that a reduction in vibration of the vehicle body frame due to the vibration of the engine can be contrived, and the engine can be constituted in a compact form while securing the feeling of rigidity at the time of treading on the pedals. [0005]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In order to attain the above object, the invention as set forth in claim 1 is characterized in that, in a pedaled motorcycle which comprises a pedal shaft capable of transmitting a tread force inputted from pedals provided at both ends thereof to a rear wheel, and an engine having a crankshaft rotated around an axis parallel to the pedal shaft and capable of transmitting rotational power to the rear wheel, and in which the crankshaft having at least a pair of crank weights is supported on an engine case of the engine, and the pedal<br><br>
shaft is rotatably supported on the engine case, an engine main body including the engine case is rigidly attached to a vehicle body frame, and a balancer having a balance weight disposed between the crank weights so as to be partly overlapped with the crank weights as viewed in a direction parallel to the axis of the crankshaft is contained in the engine case so as to be capable of rotating around an axis parallel to the crankshaft in conjunction with the rotation of the crankshaft. [0006]<br>
According to such a constitution, the vibration of the engine is suppressed by the balancer, so that the vibration of the vehicle body frame due to the vibration of the engine can be reduced even though the engine main body is rigidly attached to the vehicle body frame.  In addition, since the engine main body is rigidly attached to the vehicle body frame, it is possible to secure the feeling of rigidity at the time of treading on the pedals at both ends of the pedal shaft supported on the engine case possessed by the engine main body, and since there is no need for a vibration-isolating structure, the structure for supporting the engine main body onto the vehicle body frame can be made compact. Besides, since the balance weight of the balancer is disposed between a<br><br>
pair of crank weights while being partly overlapped with the crank weights as viewed in a direction parallel to the axis of the crankshaft, the width of the engine case in the direction along the axis of the crankshaft can be set small in spite of the presence of the balancer, and the engine can be prevented from being enlarged in size. [0007]<br>
In addition to the constitution of the invention set forth in claim 1, the invention as set forth in claim 2 is characterized in that a pair of the balancers having a rotational axis on the extension of one diameter line of the crankshaft are disposed on both sides of the crankshaft as viewed in the direction of the axis of a cylinder bore possessed by the engine main body. According to this constitution, a pair of the balancers capable of suppressing the rotational moment around the crankshaft can be disposed in a compact form between the pair of crank weights. [0008]<br>
In addition to the constitution of the invention as set forth in claim 1 or 2, the invention as set forth in claim 3 is characterized in that the pedal shaft is supported on the engine case through bearings, and the crankshaft and the balancer are supported on a holder<br><br>
fitted to the engine case respectively through bearings. According to this constitution, the crankshaft and the balancer are supported by the holder separate from the engine case, whereby concentration of balancer mass can be contrived, and the rigidity of the holder can be easily enhanced, so that the vibration-isolating effect of the balancer is enhanced, and the transmission of vibration to the engine case can be more restrained. As a result, the transmission of vibration to the vehicle body frame and the pedal shaft can be reduced more, and a reduction in the weight of the engine case can be contrived by securing rigidity by the holder. [0009]<br>
In addition to the constitution of the invention as set forth in claim 2, the invention as set forth in claim 4 is characterized in that the crankshaft and the pedal shaft are disposed side by side at such positions that the axis of the cylinder bore skewly intersects a straight line connecting the axes of the shafts. According to this constitution, even though the pair of balancers are disposed on both sides of the crankshaft as viewed in the direction of the axis of the cylinder bore, the crankshaft and the pedal shaft can be disposed as close as possible to each other, and a reduction in the<br>
size of the engine case can be contrived.<br><br><br>

Therefore, the balancers 54, 54 are rotated in opposite directions around axes parallel to the crankshaft 45, in conjunction with the rotation of the crankshaft 45. [0026]<br>
A pedal shaft 58 having an axis on an extension line of the seat post 24 possessed by the vehicle body frame 21 to the lower side is disposed on the front side of the crankshaft 45 along the front-rear direction of<br><br>
the vehicle body frame 21, while having an axis parallel to the crankshaft 45, and the pedal shaft 58 is rotatably supported on the first and fourth case members 38, 41 of the engine case 35 through ball bearings 59, 60.  In addition, crank pedals 30 ... are provided respectively at both ends of the pedal shaft 58 on the outer side of the engine case 35. [0027]<br>
A generator 63 comprising a rotor 61 relatively rotatably supported by the pedal shaft 58 so as to be rotatable around the same axis as the pedal shaft 58 and a stator 62 fixedly supported by the first case member 38 of the engine case 35 so as to be covered by the rotor 61 is contained in the operating chamber 43. [0028]<br>
A driving pulley 64 is relatively unrotatably fitted to the crankshaft 45 projected into the operating chamber 43 by rotatably piercing through the second case member 39 of the engine case 35, and an endless belt 66 is wrapped around a driven pulley 65 fixed to the rotor 61 of the generator 63 and the driving pulley 64. Therefore, the rotor 61 of the generator 63 is driven to rotate according to the rotation of the crankshaft 45. [0029]<br><br><br>
Referring to Fig. 5 also, rotational power of the crankshaft 45 is transmitted to the rear wheel WR through a power transmission means 69 including a belt-type non-stage transmission 70 and a planetary gear type speed reduction gear 71, and the power transmission means 69 is disposed on the left side of a vertical plane including the axis C of the cylinder bore 37 possessed by the engine 31, as viewed in the forward direction of the motorcycle. [0030]<br>

[0033]<br>
In such a belt-type non-stage transmission 70 as above, the effective radius of the driving pulley 73 is increased under the action of the centrifugal weight 72 attendant on an increase in the revolution number of the crankshaft 45, and the effective radius of the driven pulley 74 is decreased attendantly, whereby the speed change ratio is stagelessly varied from the LOW side to the TOP side, and the driving force of the engine 31 speed-changed by the belt-type non-stage transmission 70<br><br>
is further speed-reduced by the planetary gear type speed reduction gear 71, before being transmitted to the axle 78. [0034]<br>
A back plate 80 of a drum brake 79 is fixedly supported by the other of the left-right pair of rear frames 25 ..., on the right side of the rear wheel WR as viewed in the forward direction of the motorcycle, and the other side of the axle 78 is rotatably supported on the back plate 80. [0035]<br>

between communication and shut-off between the<br><br>
exhaust port 88 and the combustion chamber 85 are openably and closably supported on the cylinder block 34 so as to front on the combustion chamber 85 on a lateral side of the cylinder bore 37, and are urged in valve-closing directions by springs. [0039]<br>
Namely, the power transmission means 69 for transmitting the rotational power of the crankshaft 45 to the rear wheel WR and the intake valve 89 and the exhaust valve 90 are disposed while being separately distributed to the left and right sides of the vertical plane including the axis C of the cylinder bore 37. [0040]<br>
The intake valve 89 and the exhaust valve 90 are driven to open and close by a valve-operating mechanism 91.  The valve-operating mechanism 91 comprises a timing driving gear 92 fixed to the crankshaft 45, a timing driven gear 94 rotatably supported by a support shaft 93 fixed to the holding plate 48 of the holder 50 and meshed with the timing driving gear 92, a cam 95 formed as one body with the timing driven gear 94, an intake-side rocker arm 96 supported on the cylinder block 34 so as to • following up to the cam 95 and connected to and<br>
"1 in conjunction with the intake valve 89, and an<br><br>
exhaust-side rocker arm 97 supported on the cylinder block 34 so as to rock following up to the cam 95 and connected to and operated in conjunction with the exhaust valve 90. [0041]<br>
The timing driving gear 92 transmits the rotational power of the crankshaft 45 to the timing driven gear 94 and the cam 95 with a speed reduction by a factor of 1/2. Namely, the cam 95 is rotated at a speed of 1/2 of the rotation speed of the crankshaft 45. [0042]<br>
The downstream end of an intake pipe 98 extended in the front-rear direction of the vehicle body frame 21 is connected to the cylinder portion 34a of the cylinder block 34 so as to be communicated with the intake port 87, and the upstream end of the intake pipe 98 is connected to the downstream end of a carburetor 99 contained in a rear portion in the main frame 23 of the vehicle body frame 21.

[0050]<br>
The cleaner element 113 is fitted to an opening portion 120 provided in the cleaner case 112 so as to be directed to the side of the fuel tank 108, and a perforated plate 121 for supporting the cleaner element<br><br>
113 from the inner side of the cleaner case 112 is fixed<br>

The upstream end of a connection pipe 122 is connected to a rear portion of the cleaner case 112, and the downstream end of the connection pipe 122 is connected to the upstream end of the carburetor 99.  Therefore, the air cleaned by the air cleaner 111 is led into the carburetor 99. [0052]<br>
Referring again to Figs. 2, 3 and 5, the upstream end of an exhaust pipe 125 for conducting an exhaust gas from the engine 31 is connected to the cylinder block 34 so as to be communicated with the exhaust port 88.  The exhaust pipe 125 is extended downwards along the rear wheel WR between the engine 31 and the rear wheel WR, and the downstream end of the exhaust pipe 125 is connected to a muffler 126 supported by the rear frame 25 of the vehicle body frame 21 and disposed on the right side of<br><br>
the rear wheel WR. [0053]<br>
In addition, the chain 83 for transmitting the rotational power of the pedal shaft 58 to the axle 78 of the rear wheel WR and the belt 75 for transmitting the rotational power of the crankshaft 45 to the axle 78 of the rear wheel WR are disposed while being separately distributed to the left and right sides of the exhaust pipe 125. [0054]<br>
Next, the action or effect of the first embodiment will be described.  The cylinder portion 34a of the engine 31 supported on the vehicle body frame 21 with the crankshaft 45 disposed on the rear side of the pedal shaft 58 is disposed with an upwardly rearward inclination between the seat post 24 of the vehicle body frame 21 and the rear wheel WR, and the exhaust pipe 125 for conducting the exhaust gas from the engine 31 is disposed to be extended downwards along the rear wheel WR between the engine 31 and the rear wheel WR and connected to the muffler 126, so that the performance of the engine 31 can be enhanced through easily securing the length of the exhaust pipe while disposing the exhaust pipe 125 at a position away from the vehicle body frame 21 and away<br><br>
from the pedal shaft 58.<br>
[0055]<br>
In addition, the belt 75 for transmitting the rotational power of the crankshaft 45 to the axle 78 of the rear wheel WR and the chain 83 for transmitting the rotational power of the pedal shaft 58 to the axle 78 of the rear wheel WR are disposed while being separately-distributed to the left and right sides of the exhaust pipe 125, and the exhaust pipe 125 is surrounded by the engine 31, the rear wheel WR, the belt 75 and the chain 83 on the front, rear, left and right sides thereof, so that a protector or the like for exclusive use for covering the exhaust pipe 125 is unnecessitated, and the number of component parts can be reduced.<br>
[0056]<br>
Besides, the crankshaft 45 having a pair of crank weights 45a, 45a is supported on the engine case 35 possessed by the engine 31, and the pedal shaft 58 is rotatably supported on the engine case 35; the engine main body 33 including the engine case 35 is rigidly-attached to the vehicle body frame 21, and a pair of balancers 54, 54 are contained in the engine case 35 so as to be capable of rotation around an axis parallel to the crankshaft 45 in conjunction with the rotation of the<br><br>
crankshaft 45.<br>
[0057]<br>
Therefore, vibration of the engine 31 is restrained by the balancers 54, 54, so that vibration of the vehicle body frame 21 due to engine vibration can be reduced even though the engine main body 33 is rigidly attached to the vehicle body frame 21.  In addition, since the engine main body 33 is rigidly attached to the vehicle body frame 21, the feeling of rigidity at the time of treading on the crank pedals 30 ... at both ends of the pedal shaft 58 supported by the engine case 35 possessed by the engine main body 33 can be secured, and there is no need for a vibration-isolating structure, so that the structure for supporting the engine main body 33 onto the vehicle body frame 21 can be made compact.<br>
[0058]<br>
Besides, the balancers 54, 54 respectively have a balance weight 54a disposed between the crank weights 45a, 45a so as to be partly overlapped with the crank weights 45a, 45a as viewed in a direction parallel to the axis of the crankshaft 45, so that in spite of the presence of the balancers 54, 54, the width of the engine case 35 in the direction along the axis of the crankshaft 45 can be set small, and an increase in the size of the engine 31<br><br>
can be prevented.<br>
[0059]<br>
In addition, the balancers 54, 54 are disposed on both sides of the crankshaft 45 as viewed in the direction along the axis C of the cylinder bore 37 possessed by the engine main body 33, so as to have a rotational axis on the extension of one diameter line of the crankshaft 45, and the pair of balancers 54, 54 capable of suppressing a rotational moment around the crankshaft 45 can be disposed in a compact form between the pair of crank weights 45a, 45a.<br>
[0060]<br>
While the pedal shaft 58 is supported on the engine case 35 through the ball bearings 59, 60, the crankshaft 45 and the balancers 54, 54 are supported on the holder 50 fitted to the engine case 35 respectively through the ball bearings 53, 53; 55, 55. Namely, the crankshaft 45 and the balancers 54, 54 are supported by the holder 50 separate from the engine case 35, whereby concentration of balancer mass is contrived, rigidity of the holder 50 is easily enhanced, the vibration-isolating effect of the balancers 54, 54 is enhanced, and transmission of vibration to the engine case 35 can be more restrained. As a result, transmission of vibration to the vehicle<br><br>
body frame 21 and the pedal shaft 58 can be more reduced, and a reduction in the weight of the engine case 35 can be contrived through securing rigidity by the holder 50. [0061]<br>
Further, the axis of the pedal shaft 58 is disposed on an imaginary extension to the lower side of the seat post 24 constituting a part of the vehicle body frame 21, the cylinder portion 34a of the engine 31 supported on the vehicle body frame 21 with the crankshaft 45 disposed on the rear side of the pedal shaft 58 is disposed along the seat post 24 on the rear side of the seat post 24, and the carburetor 99 contained in the main frame 23 is connected to an upper portion of the engine 31 through the intake pipe 98 extended in the front-rear direction of the vehicle body frame 21. [0062]<br>
Therefore, the intake system and the exhaust system of the engine 31 can be so disposed as to obviate interference with the space required for the rotation of the crank pedals 30 ... at both ends of the pedal shaft 58, the engine 31 can be constituted collectively compact through constituting a part of the intake system by the inside of the main frame 23, and the motorcycle as a whole can be made compact.<br><br>
[0063]<br>
Besides, since the engine 31 is a side valve type 4-cycle engine, the intake port 87 and the exhaust port 88 are provided at the cylinder portion 34a of the engine 31, and the intake pipe 98 and the exhaust pipe 125 can be connected to the cylinder portion 34a, so that the overall height of the engine 31 can be set small although the engine 31 is a 4-cycle engine capable of cleaning the exhaust gas, whereby the height from the ground of a lower portion of the engine 31 and a space for disposing accessories on the upper side of the engine 31 can be earned. [0064]<br>
Further, the engine 31 is supported on the vehicle body frame 21 in such a layout that the intake and exhaust valves 89, 90 and the power transmission means 69 for transmitting power from the crankshaft 45 to the rear wheel WR are separately distributed to the left and right sides of a vertical plane including the axis of the cylinder bore 37, so that the size of the engine 31 can be reduced while securing a cooling adiabatic space for the cylinder portion 34a between the crank pedals 30 ..., thereby contributing more to compacter design of the motorcycle as a whole.<br><br>
[0065]<br>
Incidentally, the main frame 23 of the vehicle body frame 21 is formed to be hollow and inclined downwardly rearwards, the fuel tank 108 and the carburetor 99 disposed on the rear side of the fuel tank 108 are contained in the main frame 23, and the carburetor 99 is connected to the engine 31 disposed on the rear side of the main frame 23 through the intake pipe 98 extending in the front-rear direction of the vehicle body frame 21. [0066]<br>
Therefore, there is no need for a space for securing an adiabatic space for the engine 31 in the vicinity of the main frame 23, a reduction in size of the main frame 23, namely, a reduction in size of the vehicle body can be achieved, so that seating on and getting off the seat 28 is facilitated, and the fuel tank 108 and the carburetor 99 can be effectively contained in the main frame 23.  Besides, since the main frame 23 is inclined downwardly rearwards, the fuel conduits 118, 119 for supplying a fuel from the fuel tank 108 to the carburetor 99 can be naturally inclined downwardly rearwards, and the supply of the fuel to the carburetor 99 can be smoothened. [0067]<br><br>
In addition, the air cleaner 111 disposed on the front side of the carburetor 99 is contained in the main frame 23, and the intake system of the engine 31 can be contained in a compact form in the main frame 23. [0068]<br>
Further, the pedal shaft 58 capable of transmitting the tread force inputted from the crank pedals 30 ... provided at both ends to the rear wheel WR is disposed on the lower side than a rear end portion of the main frame 23, so that the intake system of the engine 31 can be disposed in a compact form in the vicinity of the crank pedals 30 ... which require a comparatively large rotational space.

The engine main body 153 including the engine case 155 is rigidly attached to the vehicle body frame 141, and the pair of balancers 54, 54 are contained in the engine case 155 so as to be capable of rotation around an axis parallel to the crankshaft 45 in conjunction with the rotation of the crankshaft 45, so that vibration of the engine 151 is suppressed by the balancers 54, 54, and vibration of the vehicle body frame 141 due to the vibration of the engine can be reduced although the engine main body 153 is rigidly attached to the vehicle body frame 141.  In addition, since the engine main body 153 is rigidly attached to the vehicle body frame 141, the feeling of rigidity at the time of treading on the crank pedals 30 ... at both ends of the pedal shaft 58 supported by the engine case 155 possessed by the engine main body 153 can be secured, and a vibration-isolating structure is unnecessitated, whereby the structure for supporting the engine main body 153 onto the vehicle body frame 141 can be made compact. [0103]<br>
Besides, the balance weights 54a, 54a possessed by<br><br>
the balancers 54, 54 are disposed between the crank weights 45a, 45a so as to be partly overlapped with the crank weights 45a, 45a as viewed in the direction parallel to the axis of the crankshaft 45, so that the width of the engine case 155 in the direction along the axis of the crankshaft 45 can be set small in spite of the presence of the balancers 54, 54, and the engine 151 can be prevented from being enlarged in size. [0104]<br>
The balancers 54, 54 are disposed on both sides of the crankshaft 45 as viewed in the direction along the axis C of the cylinder bore 37 possessed by the engine main body 153, with its rotational axis on the extension of one diameter line of the crankshaft 45, so that the pair of balancers 54, 54 can be disposed in a compact form between the pair of crank weights 45a, 45a. [0105]<br>
Besides, the crankshaft 45 and the pedal shaft 58 are disposed side by side at positions where the axis C of the cylinder bore 37 skewly intersects a straight line L connecting between the axes of the shafts 45, 58; therefore, even though the pair of balancers 54, 54 are a-isposed" on both  sicfes of the  crankshaft  45  as viewed in the direction of the axis of the cylinder bore 37, it is<br><br>
possible to dispose the crankshaft 45 and the pedal shaft 58 as close as possible to each other, and a reduction in the size of the engine case 155 can be contrived.<br>
[0106]<br>
Since the crankshaft 45 and the balancers 54, 54 are supported by the holder 50 separate from the engine case 155, concentration of the balancer mass can be contrived, the rigidity of the holder 50 is easily enhanced, the vibration-isolating effect of the balancers 54, 54 is enhanced, and transmission of vibration to the engine case 155 can be more suppressed. As a result, transmission of vibration to the vehicle body frame 141 and the pedal shaft 58 can be more reduced, and a reduction in the weight of the engine case 155 can be contrived through securing the rigidity by the holder 50.<br>
[0107]<br>
The axis of the pedal shaft 58 is disposed on an imaginary extension line to the lower side of the seat post 144, and the cylinder portion 154a of the engine 151 supported on the vehicle body frame 141 with the crankshaft 45 disposed on the rear side of the pedal shaft 58 is disposed along the seat post 144 on the rear side of the seat post 144.  Therefore, the intake system and exhaust system of the engine 151 can be disposed so<br><br>
as to obviate interference with the space required for the rotation of the crank pedals 30 ... at both ends of the pedal shaft 58.<br>
[0108]<br>
While the embodiments of the present invention have been described above, the invention is not limited to or by the above embodiments, and various design modifications can be made without departure from the invention as set fourth in the claims.<br>
[0109]<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
Thus, according to the invention as set forth in claim 1, vibration of the vehicle body frame due to the vibration of the engine can be reduced, the feeling of rigidity at the time of treading on the pedals can be secured, and the structure for supporting the engine main body onto the vehicle body frame can be made compact. Besides, the width of the engine case in the direction along the axis of the crankshaft can be set small, and the engine can be prevented from being enlarged in size.<br>
[0110]<br>
According to the invention a set forth in claim 2, the pair of balancers capable of suppressing the rotational moment around the crankshaft can be disposed<br><br>
in a compact form between the pair of crank weights. [0111]<br>
According to the invention as set forth in claim 3, the vibration-isolating effect of the balancer is enhanced, whereby transmission of vibration to the engine case is more suppressed, and transmission of vibration to the vehicle body frame and the pedal shaft can be reduced more.  Besides, by securing rigidity by the holder, a reduction in the weight of the engine case can be contrived. [0112]<br>
According to the invention as set forth in claim 4, the crankshaft and the pedal shaft can be disposed as close as possible to each other, and a reduction in the size of the engine case can be contrived.<br><br>
