				<td>MULTI-SPEED AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The invention relates to a multiple speed automatic transmission<br>
having both a plurality of planetary gear sets and torque transmitting devices that are<br>
selectively engageable to achieve multiple gear ratios.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002]	A typical modern multiple speed automatic transmission includes<br>
a combination of planetary gear assemblies and selectively engaged friction clutches and<br>
to achieve a plurality of gear ratios.<br>
[0003]	Increasingly demanding economic and performance goals<br>
continue to encourage automatic transmission research and development. A result of<br>
this effort has been an increase in the number of available forward gears or speed ratios<br>
provided by the transmission.<br>
[0004]	Whereas three and four speed automatic transmissions were once<br>
commonplace, considered both suitable and to provide sufficient flexibility and<br>
performance, the industry and consumer preference is moving to six, seven and eight<br>
speed automatic transmissions.<br>
[0005]	In such transmissions, the various elements of a plurality of<br>
planetary gear assemblies are connected by permanent couplings, selectively connected<br>
by clutches and selectively grounded by brakes. Specific combinations of the clutches<br>
and brakes are engaged or activated to provide a sequence of numerically related gear<br>
ratios and thus speed and torque ratios.<br>
[0006]	Because they so closely match the power and torque curves of the<br>
engine to the vehicle speed and load, such six, seven and eight speed transmissions<br>
provide significant performance enhancements and fuel consumption reduction.<br>
[0007]	Careful study of these transmission configurations, however,<br>
reveals that improvements are both possible and desirable. For example, each of the<br><br>
torque transmitting devices, i.e., the clutches and brakes, contribute to frictional losses,<br>
referred to as spin losses, when they are not engaged. Two primary factors influence<br>
spin losses: the size or torque capacity of the clutch and the instantaneous speed<br>
difference across the clutch. A particularly disadvantageous condition arises if the<br>
device is a high torque capacity, multiple plate clutch functioning as a brake with a high<br>
speed difference across it. Since a brake typically has one half of its friction members<br>
connected to ground which are therefore always stationary, the spin losses in such a<br>
situation may be relatively significant.<br>
[0008]	The present invention is directed to reducing frictional or spin<br>
losses created by the clutches and brakes of a multiple speed automatic transmission.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0009]	A multiple speed automatic transmission is provided having an<br>
input member, an output member, a plurality of planetary gear sets, a plurality of<br>
interconnecting members and a plurality of torque transmitting devices. The input<br>
member is connected to and drives a planet gear carrier of a first planetary gear set.<br>
The output member is connected to and is driven by a planet gear carrier of the third<br>
planetary gear set. A first interconnecting member connects a sun gear of the first<br>
planetary gear set with a sun gear of the fourth planetary gear set. A second<br>
interconnecting member connects a planet gear carrier of the fourth planetary gear set<br>
with a ring gear of the second planetary gear set. A third interconnecting member<br>
connects a ring gear of the first planetary gear set with a sun gear of the second<br>
planetary gear set. A fourth interconnecting member connects a planet gear carrier of<br>
the third planetary gear set with a planet gear carrier of the second planetary gear set.<br>
[0010]	The plurality of torque transmitting devices including two brakes<br>
and three clutches are selectively engageable in various combinations of three to<br>
establish eight forward gear ratios and one reverse gear ratio between the input member<br>
and the output member. A first brake selectively connects the sun gear of the fourth<br>
planetary gear set with a stationary member. A second compound brake selectively<br><br>
connects a ring gear of the fourth planetary gear set with the stationary member. The<br>
second compound brake includes a selectable one way clutch and a light duty or coast<br>
clutch disposed in mechanical parallel. Preferably, the light duty clutch includes a<br>
single rotating disc or plate. A first clutch selectively connects the planet gear carrier<br>
of the first planetary gear set with a sun gear of the third planetary gear set. A second<br>
clutch selectively connects the sun gear of the second planetary gear set with the sun<br>
gear of the third planetary gear set. A third clutch selectively connects a ring gear of<br>
the second planetary gear set with the sun gear of the third planetary gear set.<br>
[0011]	A multiple speed automatic transmission incorporating the present<br>
invention exhibits significantly reduced frictional, i.e., spin losses.<br>
[0012]	Thus it is an object of the present invention to provide a multiple<br>
speed automatic transmission having four planetary gear sets and five selectable torque<br>
transmitting devices.<br>
[0013]	It is a further object of the present invention to provide a multiple<br>
speed automatic transmission having a compound brake including a selectable one way<br>
clutch.<br>
[0014]	It is a further object of the present invention to provide a multiple<br>
speed automatic transmission having a compound brake including a selectable one way<br>
clutch and a light duty or coast clutch in parallel.<br>
[0015]	It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a<br>
multiple speed automatic transmission exhibiting reduced spin losses.<br>
[0016]	The above features and advantages and other features and<br>
advantages of the present invention will be readily apparent from the following detailed<br>
description of the preferred embodiment for carrying out the invention when taken in<br>
connection with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0017]	Figure 1 is a schematic representation of an embodiment of an<br>
automatic transmission in accordance with the present invention;<br><br>
[0018]	Figure 2 is a truth table listing the engaged torque transmitting<br>
devices for selected torque or gear ratios achieved by the automatic transmission of<br>
Figure 1; and<br>
[0019]	Figure 3 is a lever diagram of the automatic transmission of Figure<br>
1 illustrating the power flow from the input through the planetary gear sets to the output,<br>
in accordance with the present invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0020]	Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers refer to<br>
the same component, element or feature, in Figure 1 a multiple speed automatic<br>
transmission 10 is depicted. The automatic transmission 10 includes an input member 12<br>
and an output member 14. In the present embodiment, the input member 12 and the<br>
output member 14 are shafts, and will be referred to as such. Those skilled in the art will<br>
appreciate that the input member 12 and the output member 14 may be components other<br>
than shafts such as quills. The input shaft 12 is continuously connected to an engine (not<br>
shown) or to a turbine of a torque converter (not shown). The output shaft 14 is<br>
continuously connected with the final drive unit such as a differential or transfer case<br>
(both not shown).<br>
[0021]	The automatic transmission 10 includes four planetary gear sets 16,<br>
18, 20 and 22. The planetary gear sets 16, 18, 20 and 22 are operably disposed between<br>
the input shaft 12 and the output shaft 14. In the preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the first planetary gear set 16 is a simple planetary gear set that includes a first<br>
sun gear member 24, a first ring gear member 26 and a first planet carrier member 28 that<br>
rotatably supports a first plurality of pinion gears 30 (only one of which is shown). The<br>
first plurality of pinion gears 30 are configured to intermesh with the first sun gear<br>
member 24 and the first ring gear member 26. The first sun gear member 24 is connected<br>
for common rotation with a first intermediate shaft or quill 32. The first ring gear<br>
member 26 is connected for common rotation with a second intermediate shaft or quill<br>
34. The first planet carrier member 28 is connected for common rotation with the input<br>
shaft 12.<br><br>
[0022]	In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the second<br>
planetary gear set 18 is a simple planetary gear set that includes a second sun gear<br>
member 42, a second ring gear member 44 and a second planet carrier member 46 that<br>
rotatably supports a second plurality of pinion gears 48 (only one of which is shown).<br>
The second plurality of pinion gears 48 are configured to intermesh with both the second<br>
sun gear member 42 and the second ring gear member 44. The second sun gear member<br>
42 is connected for common rotation with the second intermediate shaft or quill 34. The<br>
second ring gear member 44 is connected for common rotation with a third intermediate<br>
shaft or quill 36. The second carrier member 46 is connected for common rotation with a<br>
fourth intermediate shaft or quill 38.<br>
[0023]	In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the third<br>
planetary gear set 20 is a simple planetary gear set that includes a third sun gear member<br>
52, a third ring gear member 54 and a third planet carrier member 56 that rotatably<br>
supports a third plurality of pinion gears 58 (only one of which is shown). The third<br>
plurality of pinion gears 58 are configured to intermesh with both the third sun gear<br>
member 52 and the third ring gear member 54. The third sun gear member 52 is<br>
connected for common rotation with a fifth intermediate shaft or quill 62 and a sixth<br>
intermediate shaft or quill 64. The third ring gear member 54 is connected for common<br>
rotation with a seventh intermediate shaft or quill 66. The third carrier member 56 is<br>
connected for common rotation with the output shaft 14.<br>
[0024]	In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the fourth<br>
planetary gear set 22 is a simple planetary gear set that includes a fourth sun gear member<br>
72, a fourth ring gear member 74 and a fourth planet carrier member 76 that rotatably<br>
supports a fourth plurality of pinion gears 78 (only one of which is shown). The fourth<br>
plurality of pinion gears 78 are configured to intermesh with both the fourth sun gear<br>
member 72 and the fourth ring gear member 74. The fourth sun gear member 72 is<br>
connected for common rotation with a first outer shaft or quill 68 and the first<br>
intermediate shaft or quill 32. The fourth ring gear member 74 is connected for common<br>
rotation with a second outer shaft or quill 70. The fourth carrier member 76 is connected<br>
for common rotation with the seventh intermediate shaft or quill 66.<br><br>
[0025]	The automatic transmission 10 includes a variety of torque<br>
transmitting mechanisms or devices including a first intermediate clutch 80, a second<br>
intermediate clutch 82, a third intermediate clutch 84, a first brake 90 and a second,<br>
compound brake 92. The first intermediate clutch 80 is selectively engageable to connect<br>
the sixth intermediate shaft or quill 64 to the first planet carrier member 28 and the input<br>
shaft 12. The second intermediate clutch 82 is selectively engagable to connect the fifth<br>
intermediate shaft or quill 62 to the second sun gear member 42. The third intermediate<br>
clutch 84 is selectively engagable to connect the third intermediate shaft or quill 36 to the<br>
fifth intermediate shaft or quill 62. The first brake 90 is selectively engageable to<br>
connect the first outer shaft or quill 68 to a housing 110 of the automatic transmission 10<br>
to restrict or inhibit rotation of the first outer shaft or quill 68 and the fourth sun gear<br>
member 72 relative to the housing 100.<br>
[0026]	The second, compound brake 92 is operably disposed between the<br>
second outer shaft or quill 70 which is connected to the fourth ring gear member 74 and<br>
the housing 110 of the transmission 10 and selectively restricts or inhibits rotation of the<br>
second outer shaft or quill 70 and the fourth ring gear member 74 relative to the housing<br>
110. The second, compound brake 92 comprises a selectable one way or overrunning<br>
clutch assembly 94 having a plurality of sprags, struts or rollers 96 disposed between<br>
inner and outer members 98A and 98B. The inner member 98A is connected to the<br>
second outer shaft or quill 70 and rotates therewith. The outer member 98B is connected<br>
to the housing 110 and is therefore stationary. The selectable one way or overrunning<br>
clutch 94 reacts, i.e., carries to ground, namely, the housing 110 of the automatic<br>
transmission 10, the large torque developed within the automatic transmission 10 in<br>
reverse gear. The one way clutch assembly 94 also carries the lower torques associated<br>
with operation in first through fifth gears.<br>
[0027]	The selectable one way clutch assembly 94 also includes a first<br>
two state or two position actuator 100. In a first state or position of the first actuator 100,<br>
the one way clutch assembly 94 operates conventionally, allowing relative rotation<br>
between the inner and outer members 98A and 98B in one direction while inhibiting such<br>
rotation in the opposite direction. In the second state or position of the first actuator 100,<br>
the one way clutch assembly 94 is fully locked and relative rotation between the members<br><br>
98A and 98B in either direction is prohibited. The first actuator 100 is energized or<br>
engaged, i.e., placed in the second state or position, which locks up the one way or<br>
overrunning clutch assembly 94 in accordance with the truth table presented in Figure 2,<br>
described below. The first actuator 100 may be any suitable device such as, for example,<br>
an electrically driven motor and gear reduction assembly, a solenoid or a hydraulically or<br>
pneumatically powered piston and cylinder assembly.<br>
[0028]	It should be appreciated that the inventor is familiar with the<br>
convention of characterizing a torque controlling or transferring device disposed between<br>
two rotatable members as a clutch whereas such a device disposed between one rotatable<br>
member and one fixed or stationary member is characterized as a brake. Nonetheless, the<br>
one way or overrunning device described above is characterized as a clutch rather than a<br>
brake as the inventor is unaware of any instance in which such a device utilized as a<br>
brake is referred to or characterized as a one way or overrunning brake rather than a one<br>
way or overrunning clutch.<br>
[0029]	The second, compound brake 92 also includes an auxiliary or coast<br>
plate clutch or brake 104 disposed in mechanical parallel with the one way or<br>
overrunning clutch assembly 94. The coast plate clutch or brake 104 is a brake having a<br>
torque capacity lower than what would be required in this location and application in the<br>
automatic transmission 10 if the one way or overrunning clutch assembly 94 were not<br>
present. This limited or low torque capability is sufficient because the one way or<br>
overrunning clutch assembly 94 carries the reaction torque between the first ring gear 26<br>
and the transmission housing 110 during most operating modes. As such, the auxiliary or<br>
coast plate clutch or brake 104 may include a single clutch plate or disc 106A adjacent a<br>
single stationary plate or disc 106B, one of which includes friction material or facing.<br>
While such a single plate or disc configuration will typically provide the lowest frictional<br>
or spin losses when the auxiliary or coast plate brake 104 is disengaged and is therefore<br>
preferred, it should be appreciated that other clutch or brake configurations having<br>
multiple plates or discs are within the scope of the present invention. The auxiliary or<br>
coast plate brake 104 also includes a second two state or position actuator 108 which<br>
engages the auxiliary or coast plate brake 104 and transfers limited torque from the fourth<br>
ring gear member 74 and the second outer shaft or quill 70 to the transmission housing<br><br>
110. This operating state is utilized to react coast torque in first through fifth gears when<br>
needed.<br>
[0030]	It should be appreciated that while the second, compound brake 92<br>
has been described in a particular location within the automatic transmission 10, i.e.,<br>
operably disposed between the fourth ring gear member 74 of the fourth planetary gear<br>
set 22 and the housing 110 of the automatic transmission 10, the compound brake 92<br>
according to the present invention may replace or be substituted for other clutches or<br>
brakes in other locations in this automatic transmission 10 or other multiple speed,<br>
planetary gear set automatic transmissions in order to provide the benefit of reduced<br>
frictional or spin losses.<br>
[0031]	For example, in an alternate embodiment eight speed transmission,<br>
four simple planetary gear sets may be arranged with the input connected to the planet<br>
carrier of a second planetary gear set, the output may be connected to a planet carrier of a<br>
fourth planetary gear set and permanent couplings may be established between a ring<br>
gear of a first planetary gear set and a sun gear of a fourth planetary gear set, a sun gear<br>
of the first planetary gear set and a ring gear of the second planetary gear set, a sun gear<br>
of the second planetary gear set and a sun gear of a third planetary gear set and a planet<br>
carrier of the third planetary gear set and a ring gear of the fourth planetary gear set.<br>
Three selectively engageable clutches may be operably disposed between a planet carrier<br>
of the first planetary gear set and the planet carrier of the fourth planetary gear set, the<br>
ring gear of the first planetary gear set and the sun gear of the first planetary gear set and<br>
the ring gear of the first planetary gear set and the input shaft. A first brake may<br>
selectively ground the sun gear of the second planetary gear set and the sun gear of the<br>
third planetary gear set. A second, compound brake according to the present invention<br>
may be utilized in this transmission configuration between a ring gear of the third<br>
planetary gear set and ground to provide overrunning action in one direction of relative<br>
rotation and inhibited rotation in the opposite direction when not activated or energized,<br>
lockup in both directions when energized, for example, when selecting reverse gear. The<br>
auxiliary or coast clutch may be activated to provide engine braking in accordance with<br>
desired performance criteria.<br><br>
[0032]	The transmission 10 is capable of transmitting torque from the<br>
input shaft 12 to the output shaft 14 in at least eight forward torque, gear or speed ratios<br>
and one reverse torque, gear or speed ratio as indicated in the truth table of Figure 2.<br>
Each of the forward and reverse torque, gear or speed ratios is attained by engagement of<br>
various combinations of the torque transmitting devices, i.e. the first intermediate clutch<br>
80, the second intermediate clutch 82, the third intermediate clutch 84, the first brake 90<br>
and the second, compound brake 92. Thus, at least eight forward gear or speed ratios and<br>
at least one reverse gear or speed ratio may be attained by the automatic transmission 10.<br>
An example of the gear ratios that may be obtained using the present invention are also<br>
shown in Figure 2. Of course, other gear ratios are achievable depending on the gear<br>
diameter, gear tooth count and gear configuration selected.<br>
[0033]	A lever diagram 10A is shown in Figure 3 that is representative of<br>
the automatic transmission 10 of Figure 1, as well as the connections for the clutches 80,<br>
82, 84 and the brakes 90, 92. The nodes 24A, 26A, 28A, 42A, 44A, 46A, 52A, 54A,<br>
56A, 72A, 74A and 76A of the lever diagram 10A represent the gear members 24, 26, 28,<br>
42, 44, 46, 52, 54, 56, 72, 74 and 76 of Figure 1 such that the same numerical designation<br>
with the addition of an A suffix is used to identify the corresponding node. For example,<br>
the nodes 24A and 42A shown in Figure 3 represent the first and second sun gear<br>
members 24 and 42, respectively, shown in Figure 1. Other components of Figure 3 have<br>
the same numbering convention for the corresponding components in Figure 1.<br>
[0034]	The operation or engagement of the clutches 80, 82 and 84 and the<br>
brakes 90 and 92 to establish the various forward and reverse speed or gear ratios will<br>
now be described with continuing reference to Figures 1 and 2.<br>
[0035]	To establish the reverse gear ratio (Rev), the torque transmitting<br>
clutches and brakes are engaged or activated as set forth in the truth table of Figure 2. As<br>
shown in Figure 2, the first brake 90, the actuator 100 of the one way or overrunning<br>
clutch assembly 94 of the second compound brake 92 and the third intermediate clutch 84<br>
are engaged to achieve the reverse gear ratio (Rev). As noted previously when the<br>
second, compound brake 92 is engaged or activated, the actuator 100 is in its second state<br>
which locks the one way or overrunning clutch assembly 94 and locks or inhibits rotation<br><br>
of the second outer shaft or quill 70 and the fourth ring gear member 74 in both<br>
directions.<br>
[0036]	In neutral, none of the clutches or brakes are carrying torque. As<br>
indicated by the O in Figure 2, in this gear state, the first brake 90 and the second,<br>
compound brake 92 are engaged but not carrying torque.<br>
[0037]	A first forward gear ratio, indicated as 1st (first gear) in the truth<br>
table of Figure 2, is achieved by engaging the first brake 90, the second, compound brake<br>
92 and the first intermediate clutch 80. It should be understood that although the truth<br>
table of Figure 2 indicates that the second, compound brake 92 is engaged or activated,<br>
such activation is optional in first through fifth gears as the overrunning feature of the<br>
one way or overrunning clutch assembly 94 will provide the appropriate and necessary<br>
mechanical connection and operation.<br>
[0038]	The next forward gear ratio, indicated as 2nd (second gear) in<br>
Figure 2, is established by engagement of the first brake 90, the second intermediate<br>
clutch 82 and optional engagement of the second, compound brake 92. The shift from<br>
first gear to second gear occurs as follows: releasing the first intermediate clutch 80 and<br>
engaging the second intermediate clutch 82 while maintaining engagement of the brakes<br>
90 and 92.<br>
[0039]	The next gear ratio, indicated as 3rd (third gear) in the truth table of<br>
Figure 2, is established by optional engagement of the second, compound brake 92 and<br>
engagement of the first and second intermediate clutches 80 and 82. The shift from<br>
second gear to third gear occurs as follows: the second clutch 82 and the second,<br>
compound brake 92 remain engaged, the first brake 90 is released and the first clutch 80<br>
is engaged.<br>
[0040]	The next forward gear ratio, indicated as 4th (fourth gear) in the<br>
