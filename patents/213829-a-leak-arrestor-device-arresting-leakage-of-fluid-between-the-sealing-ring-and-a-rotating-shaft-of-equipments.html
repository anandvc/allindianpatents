				<td>The invention relates to a leak arrester to stop the leakage of fluid between the sealing ring and the shaft of equipments like pumps, blowers and dampers etc associated with the boilers.<br>
Gland leak control during operation  is essential. Generally, asbestos ropes are used for sealing. The lock ring keeps the sealing ring comprising asbestos ropes in the compressed form inside the gland collar so that there is no gap between the shaft and the sealing material.<br>
Due to continuous wear of the asbestos rope a gap is generated between the shaft and the sealing ring causing a leak. This leakage is stopped by further tightening of the lock ring. This process is repeated until it reaches a limit when  further tightening is not possible or the width of the sealing ring has reached a minimum safe limit. At this stage the equipment has to be, stopped and  replaced with fresh asbestos rope.<br>
There are disadvantages with the present system of  leak arrester to stop leakage between shaft and sealing ring.<br>
One of the main disadvantages of the present system<br>
is that it is not possible to add additional asbestos rope during operation to take care of wear beyond the range of adjustment by further tightening the lock ring.  The equipment has to be shut down to replace or introduce additional asbestos rope.<br>
Another disadvantage of the present system is that due to operational necessity stopping of the equipment may not be possible. This  heavy leakage leads to atmospheric pollution and wastage of the fluid.<br>
Therefore, the main object of the present invention is to provide a simple and effective leak arrester where additional asbestos rope can be introduced during operation of the equipment.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a safe arrangement to introduce additional asbestos rope while the  equipment is in operation and there will be no leakage during this operation.<br>
According to this present invention there is provided a leak arrester to stop leakage of fluid comprising a shaft mounted inside a gland collar and packed with a sealing ring of asbestos rope , a lock ring compresses the said sealing ring with the plurality of lock screw provided on the lock ring characterised in that a plurality of gland collar screws is provided on the gland collar and a plurality of guide pins mounted  on the gland collar and passing through the said lock ring to slide out and introduce additional asbestor rope during operation.<br>
The nature of the invention, its objective and further advantages  residing in the same will be apparent from the following description made with reference to non limiting exemplary embodiment of the invention representing in the accompanying drawing.<br>
Fig. 1 - section view of the arrangement of the leak arrester of the present invention.<br>
In accordance with the present invention,  the existing leak arrestor consists of a gland collar (3) and lock ring (7) which is adjustably fixed to the gland collar with the help  of plurality of  lock screw (8). At least 4 such screws are provided. The sealing ring (2) comprising asbestos<br>
rope (5) are packed between the shaft (1) and the gland collar (3). The sealing ring (2) is kept compressed to make it leak-proof with the help of lock ring. There is continuous wear of the asbestos ropes ( sealing ring) and at regular interval it is compressed to fill the gap between the shaft (1) and sealing ring (2) by tightening the lock screw (8). Such an operation of gland leak control by tightening the lock screw (8) to compress the sealing ring (2) has a limitation depending on the minimum safe width of the sealing ring (2).<br>
In the present invention there is provided at least 2 gland collar screw (4) on the gland  collar ( 3) and at least 2 guide<br>
pins (9). The guide pins  are mounted on the guide collar (3) and the lock ring (7) can slide on it. The gland collar screws (4) are positioned on the gland collar (3) at the minimum width of the sealing ring comprising the asbestos rope (5).<br>
When due to continuous wear and adjustment the sealing ring (2) reaches the minimum width and further tightening of lock ring (7) is not possible and the sealing ring (2) is just<br>
below the gland collar screws (4) the sealing ring (2) is held in position by tightening the gland collar screws (4). Guide<br>
pins (9) are provided to withdraw and slide out the lock ring (7) without touching the rotating shaft (1) and new asbestos rope (6) is introduced in the gap after the lock ring  (7). After introducing the new asbestos rope the lock ring (7) is tightened and gland collar screw ( 4) is withdrawn. This operative steps are carried out with the equipment in running condition. Entire operation is safe, simple and quick.<br>
In this invention new asbestos ropes are inserted during operation without stopping the equipment. During the next available  shutdown the complete set of asbestos ropes can be replaced. This arrangement will be useful in all the rotating equipments like pumps, blowers dampers etc. provided in the boiler. This saves production loss due to fluid leak and equipment shutdown. 'This new device increases operational flexibility.<br>
The invention described hereinabove is in relation to a non - limiting embodiment and as defined by the accompanyir claims.<br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM;<br>
1.	A leak arrester device arresting leakage of fluid between the sealing<br>
ring and a rotating shafts of equipments etc comprising a shaft (1) mounted inside a gland collar (3) and packed with a sealing ring (2) of asbestos rope (5), a lock ring (7) compressing the said sealing ring (2) with the plurality of lock screw (8) provided on the lock ring (7) characterized in that a plurality of gland collar screws (4) is provided on the gland collar (3) and a plurality of guide pins (9) mounted on the gland collar (3) and passing through the said lock ring (7) to slide out and introduce additional asbestos rope (6) during operation of the said equipment.<br>
2.	A leak arrester device as claimed in claim 1 wherein the sealing ring<br>
(7) comprises of plurality of asbestos rope strands (5).<br>
3.	A leak arrester device as claimed in claims 1 and 2, wherein the lock<br>
ring (7) is adjustably held to the gland collar (3) with at least four lock<br>
screws (8).<br>
4.	A leak arrester device as claimed in claims 1 to 3 wherein at least two<br>
each of guide pins (9) and gland collar screw (4) is provided.<br>
5.	A leak arrester device arresting leakage of fluid between sealing ring<br>
and  rotating  shaft  of equipment  as  hereinabove  described  and<br>
illustrated.<br><br></td>
