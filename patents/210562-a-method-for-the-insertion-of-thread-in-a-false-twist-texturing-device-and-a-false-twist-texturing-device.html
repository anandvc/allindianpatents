A Method for the Insertion and Starting of Thread and a False-twist Texturing Device<br>
Descriptipn<br>
The present invention concerns a method for the insertion and starting of thread in a false-twist texturing device, which device possesses a fluid containing heat exchanger with at least two passages for the leading through of thread and for the sealing of the heat exchanger. Moreover the present invention relates to a false-twist texturing device with a heat exchanger having at least two thread passages for the conducting of the thread therethrough and for the sealing of the heat exchanger.<br>
EP 0 624 208 B1 discloses a texturing device, in which heat exchangers are provided. The heat exchangers are installed for optional service as a heating apparatus or as a cooling apparatus. In each case fluid, hot or cold, is brought into contact with the thread. The fluid, in this operation, finds itself in a chamber through which fluid is continually flowing. The chamber is essentially constructed in tubular form and possesses small borings, through which the thread is brought into and out of the said vessel. An exchange of heat is effected by means of the contact of the thread with the fluid. If the fluid is warmer than the thread, then the thread is warmed. If the fluid is cooler than the thread, the thread is cooled. Although this known apparatus operates satisfactorily, a disadvantage lies therein, in that in the case of a thread break, or if a restart of the texturing of the thread in the tubular vessel becomes necessary, then the thread must be reintroduced into the tubular vessel. This is very expensive in time and money, since, in order to restart the process the thread must be inserted through very<br><br>
small openings in the tubular chamber. These starting operations in the case of this known apparatus is thus complicated and time consuming.<br>
Thus the purpose of the present invention is to create a process and an apparatus, wherein the insertion and the starting, that is, the restart of the texturing process, can be carried out quickly, simply and reliably.<br>
This purpose is achieved by a method in accord with the generic method, in which the thread passages (4, 5, 6) are increased in size for the introduction of the thread. By means of the increased size of the thread passages, it becomes possible in a simple manner to insert the thread into the heat exchanger. The danger of a blockage of the thread passages is assuredly avoided with this arrangement.   If in an advantageous formulation of the invention, the thread passages are separable, in an axial and/or radial direction, for the introduction of the thread, and following said introduction of thread are thereupon closed, an especially simple and problem-free entry of the thread becomes possible. Where this procedure is concerned, the narrowly confined thread passages are opened, and thus, in a very simple manner, it becomes possible to lay the thread in a thereby opened groove instead inserting it into a restricted, small opening.   The thread, so inserted, by the subsequent closure of the thread passages, is once again totally enclosed in the said passages, since the once exposed groove becomes a fully circumferentialiy enclosed passage upon being closed. The insertion of the thread, by this method, is very rapid, simple and reliable to carry out.<br>
The purpose of the invention is further achieved, in that the thread, by means of an auxiliary air flow through the thread passages, is either blown or sucked through the thread passages.<br>
By means of a corresponding arrangement of air nozzles, which empower the auxiliary air flow through the thread passages, the thread is entrained in said air flow and carried through the thread openings. In this case, obviously, an opening of the thread passages is not required and the entry and subsequent thread-start is thus activated by an especially simple, constructive apparatus. The auxiliary nozzles can be placed at each thread passage and thus act in the manner of a<br><br>
progressive nozzle arrangement, whereby the thread is carried along from nozzle to nozzle.<br>
Further, the purpose of the invention will be achieved, in that the thread is pulled through the thread passages by means of an awl. In many cases of insertion , in which the auxiliary air flow might not be sufficient, by means of an awl, which has been previously pushed through the thread passage, the thread can be captured thereon and then pulled through the thread passage. In many application cases, this can be of advantage, since in this way, a mechanical guidance is available for the thread and the insertion is clearly made easier thereby.<br>
In order to prevent, that that fluid of the heat exchanger escapes from the heat exchanger through the thread passages, in accord with the invention, a second fluid flow, in particular an air flow, restrains the first fluid from access to the thread passages. This fluid flow, specifically an air flow, in the interests of this purpose enters the heat exchanger in the area of the thread passages and accordingly generates a flow, that is, a pressure, which acts contrary to the escape tendency of the first fluid. In this way, an active sealing off of the thread passages is accomplished, so that the heat exchanger can eVen be so constructed, that the thread passages are placed in a vertical direction.<br>
In order to prevent the first fluid from running out of the heat exchanger upon the insertion of the thread, in accord with the invention, provision is made, that before the insertion of the thread, i.e. before the opening of the heat exchanger, the feed of the first fluid and/or the second fluid or air flow is interrupted and the fluid in the heat exchanger is removed. By this means, a simple insertion, or a guiding of the thread into the heat exchanger now empty of fluid, is possible. Thus, simple methods of insertion of thread now encompass both the use of an auxiliary flow of air as well as the opening of the heat exchanger.<br>
In order to allow the thread to pass through the heat exchanger in a manner as free as possible from stress and thereby to avoid a thread break, in accord with the invention, provision is made that after the inlay or insertion of the thread, the travel of the thread is carried out only at a restrained speed and then is<br><br>
increased to the operational level. In this way, the force, which the fluid exerts on the thread is gradually increased, so that, in a reliable way, a thread break is avoided.<br>
The purpose will also be achieved by a false twist texturing device with a heat exchanger with at least two thread passages for the passage of the thread and for the sealing of the heat exchanger. In this case, the heat exchanger, is separated along the direction of the thread movement and the parts which allow the simple inlay of the thread can be parted, one from the other. With an apparatus of this description, it is possible to open the heat exchanger so far, that the thread can be inserted into the heat exchanger. The thread passages are made simple of access by the opening of the heat exchanger, so that the thread, in accord with the formation of the thread passage, with simple means, can be guided into the thread passages or laid across them. Following this inlay or insertion of the thread into the thread passages, the heat exchanger can be again closed, whereupon it is ready for operation. The complicated threading through of the thread through the complete heat exchanger from the thread inlet to the thread outlet, as is necessary in the state of the technology today, is, by the invented method, now advantageously no longer required.<br>
In the case of a separable heat exchanger, as well as where a single piece heat exchanger is concerned, provision is advantageously made, that before and/or after the locations of the individual thread passages at the respective inlet and/or outlet, an injector nozzle can be placed to transport the thread through said thread passage. The injector nozzle produces such an effect, that according to the passage design, the thread is guided through the thread passages by means of either a blowing or a suction action. The injector nozzle, for this action, can be integrated into the heat exchanger or principally brought to the heat exchanger when a thread input procedure is called for. If seen as advantageous, for each thread passage an individual nozzle can be installed in front of a thread passage and another following the thread passage to achieve a reliable insertion of the thread. Often it suffices to simple place an injector nozzle<br><br>
at the first and/or the last thread passage of the heat exchanger, whereby the thread can be blown or sucked through the heat exchanger.<br>
If, within the heat exchanger, the thread inlet and the thread outlet are connected by a tube with passages radially situated along its length, then the air flow, with which the thread is brought through the thread passages, also flows through the heat exchanger. In this way the thread is mechanically led through the said heat exchanger. By means of the passages in the said tube, assurance is provided, that the fluid in the heat exchanger comes into sufficient contact with the thread.<br>
If the thread passages are made in segments, individually movable in reference to one another, so that the thread passages can open in an axial or a radial manner for the insertion of the thread, then an especially simple inlay of the thread is accomplished. Because the thread grooves of the segments are circumferentially so constituted, that the thread in one of the segments per thread passage is laid in one groove, and subsequently the thread passage, is closed to match a corresponding groove of another segment, then, in operation, an excellent placement of the thread has been accomplished as well as an effective sealing action of the thread passages relative to the active fluid of the heat exchanger. In other words, the segments are, in accomplishing this operation, separated from one another for the inlay of the thread, and after said inlay of the thread, are brought into alignment again, so that by this means the circumferential capture of the thread in the passage is carried out. Frequently it suffices, if the two coacting segments are arrayed in an axial direction, one behind the other, and probably, abutting one another on one side to maintain a satisfactory sealing action.<br>
In a particularly advantageous embodiment, the segments relate to one another in a rotatably arranged, circular part of the thread passage. With this arrangement, in a particularly simple manner, the opening of the thread passage for the inlay of the thread and the subsequent closure of the said thread passage makes possible a circumferential capture of the thread.<br><br>
In order to bring about a sealing action in the axial direction of the individual segments, advantageously, at least one of the coacting, individual segments is loaded by a spring against the corresponding segment The side surfaces of the segments engage against one another in a substantially sealing manner, so that the fluid present in the heat exchanger is essentially prevented from penetrating backward through the said thread passage. By means of this spring loaded placement of at least one of the segments, the opening and the closing of the thread passages is made easier, and besides this, the tolerances which must be maintained in the process of manufacture are less demanding, so that a simple and enduring, tight closure ability ot the thread passage can be effected.<br>
In order to prevent a loss of the fluid present in the heat exchanger, provision has been made that at least that chamberof the heat exchanger, in which the first fluid is to be found, is sealed by means of a peripheral sealant. When this is done, the opening and closing of the heat exchanger is advantageously possible for a longer period, without the loss of the heat transfer fluid, which fluid, for example, would have to be retained in separate tanks.<br>
In order to achieve an especially effective temperature exchange between the fluid and thread, provision has been made that the flow of fluid through the heat exchanger proceeds in counterflow to the progress of the thread therethrough. Experience has shown, that in such opposite movement, the thread approaches the temperature of the fluid essentially more rapidly. The length of the heat exchanger, on this basis, can be reduced, under certain temperature differences and exchange dwell time. Alternatively, the transport velocity of the thread through the heat exchanger may accordingly be increased. In general, it has been established, that it is advantageous, that the fluid flow through the heat exchanger is provided with velocity components which are relative to differing thread velocity components.<br>
If the fluid flow is in a direction essentially contrary to the pull of gravity, then a particularly simple possibility for the through-flow is produced.<br>
In order to attain a particularly effective sealing action in the area of the thread passages, and to prevent the issuance of the fluid from the heat exchanger at<br><br>
these passage points, the provision is, that at the thread inlet and/or at the thread outlet, more than one, preferably three thread passages are put into position. By this means, a kind of a labyrinthine sealing means can be installed which reliably assures that the heat exchanger is tight. In this way, it is even possible, to place the heat exchanger in a vertical position, so that the thread inlet or outlet can be located under the fluid container of the heat exchanger.<br>
In order to simplify the insertion of the thread, especially in the case of injector nozzles, provision has advantageously been made, that the thread passage be equipped with a chamfered entry to accept the thread insertion. In this way, the flow and the thread are so guided, that the thread penetrates the openings of the thread passages without difficulties and a thread blockage within the heat exchanger is avoided.<br>
After the thread runs through the thread passage at very high speeds, it is of particular advantage, if the thread passage is designed to be wear resistant. In this regard, ceramics have proven themselves especially advantageous, in that first, they show a high wear resistance in regard to the thread, and second, the thread passes through essentially in an undamaged condition.<br>
In order to prevent, that the heat exchanger is accidentally opened, especially when there is still fluid in the heat exchanger, it is advantageously provided, that the the heat exchanger can be locked, especially mechanically, electrically, hydraulically or pneumatically. Only upon a signal, that after an emptying of the heat exchanger, opening is pennissibie, would it be possible that the heat exchanger could be manually or automatically opened.<br>
Particularly advantageous is the fact that, an especially more rapid and simpler heat transfer can take place, if the fluid is water, and specifically, distilled water. Water contact is not a negative influence on the thread and permits either a protective cooling or heating of the thread to a currently desired temperature. Beyond this the water is economical to use and creates no problems, if the heat exchanger, in case of damage, loses its sealing and the fluid escapes.<br><br>
If the fluid possesses thread treatment additives and/or a specified degree of hardness, then the thread, on an optional basis, can be treated during the texturing procedure or be especially prepared for further processing.<br>
Great advantages have arisen, when a fluid, particularly water, is used which has been enriched or saturated with a scrooping agent. By this means, the thread receives great protection in subsequent treatment and a washing-out of the thread is prevented. In this way a very high quality thread is produced.<br>
If the fluid possesses a specified temperature, then the temperature change of the thread likewise can be predetermined from the dwell time of the thread in the heat exchanger. By means of a change in the temperature of the fluid, then correspondingly, changes in the temperature of the thread can be effected. In this way, a balancing can be made, when the thread enters into the heat exchanger at different temperatures or at the thread exit, the temperature of the thread is too high or too low. By a temperature change of the fluid, in these cases, the thread can be held at a uniform temperature.<br>
For the support of the labyrinthine sealing means at the thread inlet and outlet passages, provision has advantageously been made, that in the area of the said passages, another fluid, preferably air, is admitted for the sealing of the heat exchanger and/or for the drying of the thread. The air acts, in this matter, especially when at a certain pressure, perhaps lower than 5 bar, preferably 0.5 bar, against the first fluid in the heat exchanger and prevents, at its given pressure, the first fluid from migrating through the thread passages. In this way, a particularly tight sealing of the heat exchanger is attained. As a further effect the drying of the thread is carried out by this second fluid, especially when this is air or another gaseous medium. By the above mentioned means, a leakage of the first fluid of the heat exchanger to the outside of the heat exchanger, and the consequent contamination of the surroundings is reliably avoided. In particular, the effect of the drying of the thread has proven itself as being extraordinarily positive, since even the further workup of the thread can be carried out without difficulties. The disadvantage of the previously employed, fluid-using heat<br><br>
exchangers is reliable avoided, by the above means, and in accord with the invention.<br>
In a further embodiment in accord with the present invention, provision has been made, that the heat exchanger is variable in its length, in this case being telescopically constructed. By this means, the dwell time of the thread in the heat exchanger can be correspondingly variably set. This concept of the heat exchanger, realized here for the first time with a variable length, leads to particularly favorable operational characteristics, since the heat exchanger can now be very simply adapted to the current application. If the contact positions of two telescopic parts of the heat exchanger are likewise supplied with a sealing means, then also in this situation, an effective sealing is achieved of the chamber in which the first fluid is contained. Obviously, there are other sealing possibilities which can be put into use, for instance, a casing of variable length inside the heat exchanger where the first fluid is held.<br>
Further advantages of the present invention are described in the following descriptions of embodiments with the aid of the drawings. There is shown in:<br>

Fig. 6      a heat exchanger of variable length, and<br>
Fig. 7      a heat exchanger with an internal guide tube. In Fig. 1, a heat exchanger 1 is presented in sectional view. The heat exchanger 1 possesses an under-part 2 and an upper-part 3, which can be separated, one from the other. Between the under-part 2 and the upper-part 3 is placed a thread inlet passage 4 and a thread outlet passage 5. Between the under-part 2 and the upper-part 3, is a plurality of thread passages 6. Each of the thread passages 6<br><br>
comprises, two segments, respectively 7 and 8. The segment 7 is rigidly and immovably fixed in the lower part 2. The segment 8, in the upper-part 3, is designed to be movable in the axial direction of the thread passage 6. To accomplish this properly, the segment 8 is loaded by a spring 9 which finds abutment against a surface of the upper-part 3, and causing the segment 8 to press against a surface of the segment 7 in such a way, that it brings about a substantial sealing action. Segment 7 and segment 8 form together the thread passage 6, which has a diameter of normally less than a tenth of a millimeter. Between the upper-part 3 and the segment 8 is found, moreover, a seal, which contributes to the fact that the entire system predominately prevents the fluid contained in the heat exchanger 1 from migrating out of said heat exchanger 1. On the contact surface between the under-part 2 and the upper-part 3, another sealant is provided, which completely seals off the heat exchanger in its closed position and thus, again, prevents the escape of fluid from the interior of the heat exchanger 1.<br>
The fluid in the heat exchanger 1, which is provided for heat transfer with the thread, is to be found in a fluid chamber 15. The thread, which runs through this fluid chamber 15, thus comes into heat exchanging contact with the said fluid. The fluid is in constant flow through the fluid chamber 15, so that there is always a fluid available, which predominately is at the desired specified temperature and thus provides defined relationships for the heat exchange with the thread. The flow through the fluid chamber is carried out, in that at one inlet 16, the fluid is admitted into the fluid chamber 15, and correspondingly, leaves the said fluid chamber 15 through an outlet 17. This brings about a through-flow in the fluid chamber 15 in a direction from the inlet 16 to the outlet 17. The thread runs through the heat exchanger 1 in the direction of the arrow P, so that a counterflow situation exists between the thread and the flowing fluid. The counterflow brings about an especially more rapid and effective heat transfer between the thread and the flowing fluid.<br>
In order to effectively prevent the fluid, which predominately would be of a liquid nature, from an escape out of the fluid chamber 15 in the direction of the<br><br>
thread passages 6, beside three fold thread passages 6, both at the thread inlet 4 as well as it the thread outlet 5, further measures are taken. Thus, between a pair of thread passages 6 at the thread inlet 4, and again, between a pair of thread passages 6 at the thread outlet 5, an additional fluid, which is especially of a gaseous nature, is introduced between the passages 6 of each pair. For this purpose, a conduit 20 is provided in the under-part 2, through which the second fluid is introduced into the space between the two thread passages 6. This second fluid, which, for instance, will be introduced at a pressure of 0.5 bar, serves for a pressure buildup between the thread passages 6 and attennpts to penetrate through the said thread passages 6. At this point, then, a resistance is presented to the first fluid, whereby the first fluid is effectively blocked from escape from its confinement in the fluid chamber 15. in particular, the second gaseous fluid , which, in the simplest case, is air, moreover can be utilized for the thread, in that it dries the said thread. The first fluid of the heat exchanger 1, which is still adhering to the thread, is, by the said air, pneumatically wiped off, so to speak, of the thread, and the thread, upon its exit from the heat exchanger 1 is largely in the dry state. This brings about, in an advantageous way, a very good future workability of the thread. At the same time, the said effect of the air prevents dirt accumulation on the thread outside of the heat exchanger 1 as well as the loss of the first fluid brought out of the heat exchanger by leakage along with the thread.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a plan view of the underr-part 3 of the heat exchanger 1. In this view, in particular, the layout of the sealing means 11 is visible. The sealing means 11 is so placed, that the escape of the fluids at the separation plane of the upper-part 2 and the underr-part 3 is assuredly avoided. For this purpose, the sealing means 11 in the area of the thread passages 6, i.e. the segments 7, is divided into multiple parts, so that a fluid, which has found its way through a first thread passage 6, is blocked at this point from a complete escape from the heat exchanger 1.<br>
The segments 7 exhibit slots 13, in which the thread, in the open state of the heat exchanger 1, is laid in place. Upon the closing of the heat exchanger 1, that<br><br>
is, by the joining together of the lower part 2 and the upper-part 3, the upper segments 8 are brought into contact with the under segments 7 in such a manner that the thread passage 6 is created. In this way, first, an optimal guidance of the thread into the thread passage 6 is made possible, and second, a very simple possibility is realized of inserting the thread into thread passage 6 of the heat exchanger 1.<br>
The joining together of the under-part 2 and the upper-part 3 of the heat exchanger 1 is carried out in the present embodiment in accord with guides 25. These guides 25 are placed on the under-part 2 and aligningly correspond to complementary components of the upper-part 34. The guides 25 effect a linear arrangement, along which the upper-part 3 can be separated from the under-part 2, and then can be exactly reassembled.<br>
Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b demonstrate the functional action of a heat exchanger 1 as this is shown in Figs. 1 and 2. In Fig. 3a, the heat exchanger 1 is shown in its open condition. The upper-part 3 is, by means of the guide 25, distanced from     the under-part 2. In this situation, the segments 7 and 8 are freely accessible. The segment 7 possesses a slot 13 and the segment 8 a slot 14. In this case, chamfered edges are furnished, which ease the insertion of the thread in the slot 13. After the thread is laid in place, the under-part 2 and the upper-part 3 are again joined together by the guide 25. As this is done, the situation is that the segments 7 and 8 are behind one another, and by means of the overlapping of the slots 13 and 14, an opening is formed with an essentially circular shape. This formed shape now becomes a thread passage 6.<br>
By means of the sealing means 10 and 11, as well as due to the fact that the segment 8, by means of the spring shown in Fig. 1, is pressed against the segment 7, again a tight seal is formed to repress the fluid in the chamber 15 of the heat exchanger 1 from escaping therefrom. On the other side, the remaining opening, which fomis the thread passage 6, is large enough to allow the thread to be inserted without difficulty into the heat exchanger 1 and to be again brought out through the thread outlet 5.<br><br>
In order to avoid abrasive wear on the segments 7 and 8, or at least to hold such wear to a minimum, provision has been made, that the segments 7 and 8 are made of a wear resistant material. Showing itself as particularly well adapted to such resistance, ceramics have been chosen as said material.<br>
Although the segment 7 is rigidly affixed in the under-part 2, the segment 8 in the upper-part 3 is designed to be movable in an axial direction of the thread passage 6. For this purpose, the segment 8 so constructed, that in the presentation of Fig. 3a, a projection on both sides is made evident, which prevents the segment 8 from loosening upon the removal of the upper-part 3 from the under-part 2. At the same time, the projection permits the axial sliding movement of the segment 8.<br>
In Fig. 4a and 4b, is shown an altered version of the heat exchanger 1 as compared to the embodiment of the Fig. 1 to 3. In Fig. 4a, once again the open condition of the heat exchanger 1 is depicted . Under-part 2 and the upper-part 3 are hingedly connected with one another by means of a pivot pin 25', so that the upper-part 3 can be swung away from the under-part 2. The segment 7', which, fundamentally is constructed in similar manner to segment 7, possesses a longitudinal groove 23. In this groove 23, when the heat exchanger is open, the thread can be laid in. The segment 8' possesses neither groove nor slot in this embodiment, but is made with a smooth flat surface which is presented at the contact area with the segment T. When the parts 2 and 3 are again swung together, so are the segments T and 8 pressed together. In this case, the situation is different than in the previous embodiment, where the segments were placed one behind the other, but in this case, they close one upon the other and, because of the groove 23, form a thread passage in their combined condition. In this embodiment, the axial freedom of movement of the upper segment 8' can be eliminated, since no mutual pressing together of the segments T and 8'   is necessary. The sealing is made exclusively by the pressing together of the segments T and 8' in a radial direction.<br>
In the Figures 5a and 5b, is shown another embodiment of the heat exchanger 1. In this case principally a segment 7" is provided. The segment T<br><br>
is placed in the under-part 2. This exhibits a rotatable part 21. In said rotatable part 21 a slot 13 is available in which the thread can be placed when the heat exchanger 1 is open,. After the thread is laid therein, then the rotatable part 21, by means of the lever 22 is turned 180° so that the slot 13' is now turned downward. In this way, by the coaction with the segment 7", the slot 13 is changed to a narrow thread passage 6. The level 22, is secured by means of an edge of the upper-part 3, so that an unintended opening of the thread passage 6 is avoided. The construction in accord with this design permits a very advantageous and simple insertion of the thread into the heat exchanger 1, since any monitoring as to whether or not the thread is placed correctly and mobile in the thread passage 6, can be checked in the open condition of the heat exchanger 1. Under these last stated circumstances, small corrections, such as a changed inlay of the thread in the thread passage 6 is possible in a more simple manner than in the case of the previously described embodiments, wherein the thread passage 6 is fonned only after the complete closure of the heat exchanger 1.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a heat exchanger 1 in a simplified presentation. The heat exchanger 1 is, in this embodiment, telescopically changeable in its length. The heat exchanger 1 is here comprised of essentially an inner tube 40 and an outer tube 41, which are respectively slidable, one within the other. In order that the fluid is retained securely in the fluid chamber 15, seals 30 and 31 are provided, which are inserted between the inner tube 40 and the outer tube 41. These seals are so arranged that they maintain their sealing ability upon a sliding of the inner tube 40 and the outer tube 41. The telesscopic in and out sliding of the inner tube 40 and the outer tube 41 changes the length of the heat exchanger 1. First, the advantageous aspect of this ability to change the length of the heat exchanger is, that the dwell time of the thread in the heat exchanger 1 at a constant running rate is variable. By this design a variable heat transfer between the thread and the fluid in the fluid chamber 15 can now be arranged. Second, a further advantage of this embodiment is, that for the insertion of the thread through the thread passages 6 of the heat exchanger 1, the heat exchanger 1<br><br>
can be collapsed to its minimum length, whereupon the thread passages 6 are at a minimal distance, one from the other. By this means, and insertion of the thread through the thread passages 6 is essentially eased, since the guidance, for instance by auxiliary air flows, which can be directed through the thread passages 6, becomes more simple, since the distances, which must be based on the thread position, are smaller. The insertion of the thread in the heat exchanger 1 is thus enabled to be easier, quicker, and more reliable.<br>
In Fig. 7 is seen a further heat exchanger 1, presented as a sketch. Between the thread passages 6 is placed a tube 35. The tube 35 exhibits openings 36. The fluid from the fluid chamber 15 can penetrate into the tube 35 through the said openings 36, and in this way, come into heat transferring contact with the thread which is being conducted through the said tube 35. The tube 35 also serves for the simple insertion of the thread into the heat exchanger 1. The thread, in this case, is inserted into the thread passage 6 of the thread inlet 4, and by means of a suction connection 37 is pulled through the tube 35. By means of the tube 35, the thread is better conducted in the suction induced air flow, so that a secure inspiration and insertion of the thread in the heat exchanger 1 becomes possible. In order to simplify the insertion of the thread into the thread passage 6 at the thread exit 5, a chamfering 28 is provided. By means of the chamfer 28, the thread is directed unmistakably to the thread passage 6 and a thread blockage in the tube 35 is advantageously avoided. If necessary, the thread passage 6, for the insertion of the thread, can also be enlarged, and then restricted to the original diameter after the insertion of the thread. This is done, for example, by means of the described measures for the change of the thread passages.<br>
Obviously, the features of the described embodiments may be combined among themselves. Both the first fluid as well as the second fluid can be liquid, gas or vaporizing in character. The fluid can be colder or warmer than the thread, whereby the heat exchanger 1 can take on the role of either a cooler or a heater as is appropriate. Especially, if the heat exchanger is employed as an active cooler, then the fluid is generally liquid in nature. On the other hand, when<br><br>
the heat exchange equipment is used as a heating apparatus, more likely steam is employed in the heat exchanger 1.<br>
For achieving a better circulation about the thread, the fluid should be in turbulent flow. The fluid can also be in a flow directed at right angles to the run of the thread.<br>
The invention is not limited to the presented embodiments here described. Thus it is also possible, that the upper-part and the lower part of the heat exchanger can be forced in an axial direction against one another and thereby the segments would be distanced, one from the other, so that the passage for the thread is increased.<br>
It can also be provided, that the function parts of the apparatus are employed only in one component of the device, so that a constructive, simple, and economical construction is possible. Valves and controls, which for the operation of the device can be installed advantageously for their placement as a compact, modular component on the housing of the heat exchange apparatus.<br><br><br><br>
