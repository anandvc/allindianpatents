Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a heat treatment apparatus for heat treating metals, and more particularly relates to a heat treatment apparatus for heat treatment furnace into which a hydrocarbon gas and an oxidization gas are introduced in order to heat treating metals.<br>
In the conventional cementation method, a converted gas obtained from the conversion furnace is used as a carrier gas-Recently, in order to enhance the quality, and to reduce the treatment time and running cost, such a method that the conversion furnace is not used, but a hydrocarbon gas and an oxidizing gas are introduced directly into the furnace to carry out the metamorphism and the cementation in the furnace has been proposed- Further, such a cementation method that the carbon potential in the furnace atmosphere is increased and decreased repeatedly to reduce the treatment time is described in Japanese Patent Laid Open NOB-128577/1980 and 49621/1994, Japanese Patent Publication Nos.38870/1989, 51904/1994 and 21866/1987, for example â€¢<br><br>
3<br>
However, the conventional heat treatment apparatus for metals using an endothermic gas has such a defect that it is difficult to form a hermetical seal of the apparatus.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to obviate the above defect of the conventional heat treatment apparatus.'<br>
According to the invention in one of its aspects, a heat treatment apparatus comprises a valve having an outlet opening and an inlet opening through which a pusher for pushing a work to be heat treated in said heat treatment furnace is movable, said outlet opening of the valve being hermetically connected to a pusher inserting port formed on a wall of said heat treatment furnace, and a seal box hermetically connected to said inlet opening of the valve, said pusher being movable hermetically through said seal box.<br>
According to other aspects of the invention, said valve is closed when said pusher is withdrawn therefrom, and is opened when said pusher is inserted thereinto.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, the heat treatment apparatus further comprises an elevator door for opening and closing an opening of said heat treatment furnace, a guide pin projected from said elevator door, and a jam having an upper hook surface for receiving said guide pin thereon, said jam being pivotally supported so that when said elevator door is lowered, said elevator door is moved by said jam toward a seal surface of an opening of said heat treatment furnace.<br><br>
4<br>
In accordance with the invention in another of its aspects, the heat treatment apparatus further comprises ah elevator door for opening and closing an opening of said hear treatment furnace, a guide pin projected from said elevator door, and a guide groove for guiding said pin in the vertical direction, wherein a lower end portion of said groove is curved toward a seal surface of an opening of said heat treatment furnace.<br>
According to yet other aspects of the invention, a seal packing is provided on a seal surface of an opening of said heat treatment furnace, and a cooling pipe is provided near said seal packing.<br>
The foregoing and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following more particular description of a preferred embodiment of the invention, as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br><br>
Fig. l shows an improved hermetical seal for one pusher 27 of the pushers 23, 25 and 27 shown in Fig.9. In Fig.l, a ball valve 30 and a seal box 31 are arranged in this order adjacent to the outer surface of a furnace wall 28 of the room 1 or 2 corresponding to a pusher insertion port 29 formed on the furnace wall 28. The pusher 27, for example, can be moved passing through said seal box 31, ball valve 30 and pusher insertion port 29 and inserted into the cooling room 2, for example.<br>
In this embodiment of the present invention, a work to be heat treated is inserted into the room 2 by the pusher 27 in the state that the ball vale 30 is opened then the 27 is withdrawn fromthe room 2 through the ball valve 30 into the seal box 31, and then the ball valve 30 is closed. As stated above, according to the present invention, the work can be inserted into the room 2 without breaking the hermetical seal of the room 2.<br><br>
6<br>
Figs.2 to 4 show one of the doors 4, 24 and 26, for example, the intermediate door 4 in the heat treatment apparatus of the present invention. In the present invention, guide pins 32 are projected in the horizontal direction from both sides of the door 4, planar jams 35 each having an upper hook surface 33 for receiving said guide pin 32 and a lower portion pivotally supported by a frame 34 are provided, and the intermediate door 4 is moved up and down through chains 36 by an elevator device 37, so that when the intermediate door 4 is lowered in order to close the outlet of the room 2, the guide pins 32 of the intermediate door 4 are engaged with the upper portions of the hook surfaces 33 of the iams 35 and guided along the hook surfaces 33 leftwords in Fig.4. After the guide pins 32 are reached to the bottom portions of the hook surfaces 33 of the jams 35, the jams 35 are rotated in the counter-clockwise direction as shown by a double dot and dush line in Fig. 4, so that the surface of the intermediate door 4 is pressed to the seal surface of the room 2-<br>
According to the embodiment of the present invention, the intermediate door 4 does not contact with the seal surface of the room 2 in the course of lowering and lifting, and only when the intermediate door 4 is reached to the lowest position, the intermediate door 4 is in contact with the seal surface of the room 2, so that the seal surface is never damaged when the door is moved up and down.<br>
Fig.5 shows one of guide grooves 40 formed on a frame 38 for the entrance door 3 or the outlet door 5. In the present invention, guide pins 39 are projected in the horizontal direction from both sides or the door, and guided by guide grooves 40, respectively. Each of said grooves 40 is curved at the lower portion thereof towards the seal surfac of the room 1 or the room 2.<br><br>
- 7 -According to this embodiment of the present invention, the door does not contact with the seal surface of the heating room 1 or cooling room 2 in the course of lowering and lifting, and only when the door is reached to the lowest position, the door is brought into contact with the seal surface, so that the seal surface is never damaged when the door is moved up and down.<br>
Fig.6 shows seal packing 41 arranged on the seal surface of the heating room 1. In the present invention, the seal packing 41 are surrounded with an air pipe 42 into which a cooling air is introduced so as to cool the seal packing 41,<br>
Fig.7 shows a conventional batch furnace. In Fig.7, a reference numeral 1 denotes a heating room, 2 denotes a cooling room, 3 an entrance door for said heating room i, 3a an opening and closing port formed on said entrance door 3, 4 an intermediate door, 4a an outlet formed on said intermediate door 4, 5 an outlet door for said cooling room 2, 6 a cooling oil tank, 7 an excess air exhausting device, 8 a curtain flame to be ignited when the outlet door 5 is opened, 9 and 10 gas supply pipes, 11 and i2 valves provided in said gas supply pipes 9 and 10, respectively, and 19 an agitating fan.<br>
Fig.8 shows a conventional continuous furnace and parts of the furnace which are similar to the corresponding parts of the furnace shown in Fig.7 have been given corresponding reference numerals and need not be further described.<br><br>

A reference numeral 15 denotes a work receiving room,<br>
16 a door for the work receiving room 15, 17 a CO supply pipe,<br>
2 18 a valve provided in said CO supply pipe 17, and 2.0 a gas<br>
2 material supply pipe.<br>
Fig.9 shows a heat treatment furnace in said Japanese Patent Publication No.21866/1987, wherein the entrance door 3 is opened at first, and then a work is inserted into a vestibule 22 by a pusher 21.<br>
When the pusher 21 is returned, the entrance door 3 is closed and at the same time a door 24 is opened and then the work is moved into the heating room 1 by a pusher 23.<br>
Next, the door 24 is closed and after the heating treatment is completed a door 26 is opened and the work is moved by a pusher 25 into the cooling room 2- Then, the door 26 is closed and the temperature in the cooling room 2 is induced, and at the same time the intermediate door 4 is opened and the work is moved by a pusher 27 into the cooling oil tank 6. Then, the intermediate door 4 is closed to carry out the quenching. Next, the outlet door 5 is opened, and the work is dishcarged to the outside, and then the outlet door 5 is closed.<br><br>
