Carrier Type Data Security Protection Method And<br>
Reading System For Prepaid Watthour Meter<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to electric power measuring, control<br>
and charging management, and more particularly, to a distributed control<br>
management system, which implements concentrated watthour<br>
meter-reading and charging using power lines carrier as information<br>
channel, and achieves prepaid function on each user watthour meter, so<br>
as to protect the security on data information and make it avoid<br>
malicious attack from outside.<br>
Background Art<br>
With regard to measuring and charging of electric power, at present,<br>
it is common that a dedicated watthour meter-reading person<br>
periodically door-to-door reads watthour meters mounted at each user's<br>
power supply entry, then, the user pays for the consumed electric power<br>
at a charging office. This not only takes both time and efforts, but also<br>
may make mistakes due to various reasons. As the lacking of effective<br>
measures to urge the collection of electric: power charge, the users in<br>
debt for electric power charge are increasing for many power supply<br>
enterprises or house-keeping companies. The power supply enterprises<br>
or house-keeping companies are forced to even cut off the power supply<br>
in order to urge the user to pay for the electric power charge, which<br>
directly disturbs people's life and social security.<br>
To address the problem in collecting electric power charge for<br>
watthour meter, Chinese Patent ZL 01261220.0 "Single phase IC card<br><br>
watthour meter" and Chinese Patent ZL 02223241.9 "digital type<br>
prepaid watthour meter" proposed a solution on watthour meter aiming<br>
to not only solve the problem of collecting electric power charge, but<br>
also improve on security. Both the solutions of the two patents encrypt<br>
user power-purchasing information through a single chip processor in<br>
the IC card or the keyboard, and then read them through a single chip<br>
processor mounted in the watthour meter, so as to achieve the object of<br>
improving the security on user's power-purchasing information. Because<br>
there is still a data entry window to the user, such as IC card or keyboard<br>
in the two solutions, it only improves security to some extent, but fails to<br>
essentially avoid malicious attack from outside. In addition, there is no<br>
information feedback channel which enables the watthour meter-reacing<br>
and power-selling computer to check the user watthour meter-reading<br>
and the power-purchasing data from time to time. Thus, there is a big<br>
security loophole in user power-purchasing charging data information<br>
and user watthour meter-reading data information.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
An object of the prevent invention is to provide a technology for<br>
electric power watthour meter-reading and charging and control<br>
management, and a data security protection method, which not only can<br>
solve the problem of the charging for automatic remote electric power<br>
watthour meter-reading, but also can protect the data information<br>
security of the charging for power-purchasing, so as to essentially avcid<br>
the attack from outside.<br>
Another object of the prevent invention is to provide a watthour<br>
meter-reading system for the charging of electric power watthoir<br><br>
meter-reading and distribution control management.<br>
The method proposed by the present invention is that: providing a<br>
database for watthour meter-reading, controlling and charge managing in<br>
a watthour meter-reading and power-selling computer; providirg a<br>
carrier watthour meter-reading concentrator at low voltage side of a user<br>
end transformer; providing a carrier module integrated with the user<br>
watthour meter at the user entry of the power lines, and said carrier<br>
module comprising a power-purchasing data storage circuit. The process<br>
for user power-purchasing charging management and control is as<br>
follows: a. when the user purchases electric power, an operator logs into<br>
a selling management window in the watthour meter-reading and<br>
power-selling computer after authenticating password, collects money<br>
for the user and prints receipt; b. the power-purchasing data information<br>
is sent to the carrier watthour meter-reading concentrator by the<br>
watthour meter-reading and power-selling computer through the up<br>
channel, and upon receipt of the user power-purchasing data by the<br>
watthour meter-reading concentrator, the watthour meter-reading<br>
concentrator forwards the data to the user watthour meter by carrier<br>
through the power lines; c. after the user watthour meter carrier module<br>
receives this power-purchasing data information, a single chip computer<br>
within the user watthour meter carrier module makes a judgment<br>
immediately, then stores the power-purchasing data to a<br>
power-purchasing date storage circuit in a specified format, and in the<br>
meantime, sends back the acknowledgement information on receipt of<br>
the power-purchasing data to the watthour meter-reading concentrator by<br>
carrier through the power lines; the watthour meter-reading concentrator<br>
then sends the acknowledgement information back to the watthour<br><br>
meter-reading ard power-selling computer through the up channel; d.<br>
each user wattliour meter carrier module collects the increment<br>
information on user's electric power consumption in real time, and<br>
compares it with the power-purchasing data every time the consumption<br>
adds by lKWh, and calculates balance; when the balance of the<br>
power-purchasing data is reduced to below the setting value, the carrier<br>
module produces an acousto/optic alarm, and prompts the balance of the<br>
power-purchasing data; e. when the balance of the power-purchasing<br>
data is reduced to zero, the carrier module operates the relay to cut the<br>
power off; f. the above process is repeat when the user pays money to<br>
purchase power a gain, and when the user watthour meter carrier module<br>
detects that the balance of the power-purchasing data is more than zero,<br>
it operates the relay to turn the power on.<br>
When the user watthour meter carrier module receives the user<br>
power-purchasing data, the user watthour meter carrier module sends<br>
back the user power-purchasing data to the watthour meter-reading and<br>
power-selling computer for acknowledgement, in addition to performing<br>
at least one of code verification, parity verification and frame data sum<br>
verification. Since the power-purchasing data transmitted to the user<br>
watthour meter carrier module by the watthour meter-reading and<br>
power-selling computer is the total amount of the ever-purchased power,<br>
the value stored in the power-purchasing data storage circuit in the<br>
carrier module should be consistent with the value sent by the watthour<br>
meter-reading and power-selling computer. After the watthour<br>
meter-reading and power-selling computer has sent the user<br>
power-purchasing data, if no returned information is received or the<br>
returned data received is inconsistent with the transmitted value, this<br><br>
communication is deemed as failure, and then automatic re-transmission<br>
is performed. If there is still failure with repeated re-transmissions for<br>
many times, it indicates that the communication channel cannot be used<br>
temporarily, and this transmitted value is then stored temporarily in the<br>
hard disk of the computer, the operator may transmit again after one or<br>
two hours until transmission succeeds. In general, the user<br>
power-purchasing data information can be sent successfully within 24<br>
hours through the carrier communication channel in the case of the<br>
power supply line ON, which guarantees that the user power-purchasing<br>
data may not be left unsent or wrongly sent.<br>
The watthour meter-reading system for watthour meter-reading,<br>
charging and distribution control management includes: a database<br>
created for watthour meter-reading, controlling and charge managing in<br>
a watthour meter-ieading and power-selling computer; a carrier watthour<br>
meter-reading concentrator provided at low voltage side of user end<br>
transformer; a carrier module for data collecting, carrier communication<br>
and controlling output provided at respective user watthour meter; the<br>
carrier module for user watthour meter including a power-purchasing<br>
data storage circuit which is comprised of a nonvolatile RAM<br>
(EEPROM, FRAM) device, and mounted together with the user<br>
watthour meter; the watthour meter-reading and power-selling computer<br>
being coupled to an up channel by a modem, the up channel being<br>
comprised of a public telephone network; the watthour meter-reading<br>
concentrator is coupled to the up channel by a modem, the up channel<br>
being comprised of the public telephone network or the like, and on the<br>
other hand, the watthour meter-reading concentrator being ronnected to<br>
the down channel comprised of the low voltage power supply line<br><br><br>
through carrier communication modules; the user watthour meter carrier<br>
module connected at one end to the down channel comprised of the low<br>
voltage power supply line through coupling capacitors, and connected at<br>
the other end to e pulse output terminal for user watthour meter, where a<br>
control relay receives ON/OFF control signal from a single chip<br>
computer, and a power output contact is connected in serial to output<br>
terminal for the pnase line of the watthour meter.<br>
The up channel may be a mobile communication network, or a<br>
specific communication network which is composed of fiber, microwave,<br>
data transmission station, coaxial cable or twisted-pair or the like.<br>
The method and system according to the present invention have the<br>
following advantage, as compared with the prior art:<br>
1.	The prepaid watthour meter can prevent the user from being in<br>
debt for the charge, control the carrier type watthour meter's bad<br>
analysis on a household basis, and monitor the running state in real time.<br>
The two major problems of difficulties in watthour meter-reading and<br>
payment charging can be solved.<br>
2.	The information on the user power-purchasing data is transmitted<br>
by full-sealed and secure power lines carrier channel, which eliminates<br>
the open window for IC card type prepaid watthour meter and protects<br>
security of power-purchasing information, and avoids it from any<br>
malicious attacks.<br>
3.	The information on the user power-purchasing data is stored in<br>
the watthour meter, the watthour meter-reading concentrator, and the<br>
watthour meter-reading and power-selling computer simultaneously, and<br>
the user power-purchasing data can be restored 100 percent when any<br>
one of the devices is corrupted, which avoids user's disputes that occurs<br><br><br>
frequently on IC cards type prepaid watthour meter, and can collect<br>
evidences when needed.<br>
4.	When the power price and other power-consumption polices need<br>
to be adjusted, they can be regulated correspondingly by the watthour<br>
meter-reading computer according to new power price polices (such as<br>
peak to valley power price, bottommost power price) and so on. It can<br>
response quickly and securely, without causing the problems of social<br>
security.<br>
5.	When using IC card type prepaid watthour meter, the pcwer<br>
management department is unable to know the actual<br>
power-consumption amount, thus unable to work out the power charge<br>
taken back from the users for the present month. If large "line-loss" rate<br>
due to abnormal power-using (such as power-stealing, power-leaking)<br>
appears, it may lead to a long term accumulation for a huge amount of<br>
"line-loss" power charge. Since the method according to the present<br>
invention can calculates accurately "line-loss" for the present month in<br>
time, so it can find the problems in time and take measures against a<br>
huge amount of irremediable losses.<br>
6.	The method according to the present invent not only solves :he<br>
problem of difficulty in charging in term of the known "the power lines<br>
carrier watthour meter", but also stops the information security<br>
loopholes of being vulnerable to be attacked and power-stealing from the<br>
known " IC card type prepaid watthour meter". This will put the<br>
distribution, use, measurement and charging of electric power uncer<br>
computer monitor and control, allow the power supply enterprises or the<br>
house-keeping company to get rid of the heavy burden on the user's long<br>
term money-owing and a huge amount of money-owing, and this<br><br><br>
provides effective technical means for the electric power system to take<br>
back a large amount of investments. The cost for carrying out the present<br>
invention is almost equals to the "the power lines carrier watthour<br>
meter", "the IC card type prepaid watthour meter" of prior art. The<br>
performance and function double, but the price keeps unchanged. Thus,<br>
its performance/cost ratio is high, using risk is low and comprehensive<br>
benefit is good.<br>
The method and system according to the present invent economizes<br>
the manpower and resources. One person which sits at office may know<br>
the power-using and the electric power charging of each user in a entire<br>
working unit or residential area, thereby prevents the action of the<br>
power-stealing and protects the legal right of the power supply<br>
enterprises. The present invention can be widely used to work units or<br>
residential areas, It has good comprehensive benefits on the society and<br>
economy,<br><br>

Mode Detailed Description of the Embodiments<br>
The embodiments of the present invention will be described below<br>
with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, the watthour meter-reading system is<br>
constituted in follcwing manners: a. creates a database for watthour<br><br><br>
meter-reading, controlling and charge managing in a watthour<br>
meter-reading and power-selling computer 1; b. provides a carrier<br>
watthour meter-reading concentrator 3 at low voltage side of user end<br>
transformer; c. provides a carrier moduls 4 for data collecting, carrier<br>
communication and controlling output at respective user watthour metter;<br>
d. the carrier module 4 for user watthour meter includes a<br>
power-purchasing; data storage circuit which is comprised cf a<br>
nonvolatile RAM (EEPROM, FRAM) device, and is mounted together<br>
with the user watthour meter; e. the watthour meter-reading and<br>
power-selling computer 1 is coupled to a public telephone network by a<br>
modem, which public telephone network may be a mobile<br>
communication network, or coupled to a up channel comprised of a<br>
specific communication network, which specific communication<br>
network uses fiber, microwave, data transmission station, coaxial cable<br>
or twisted-pair or the like; f. the watthour meter-reading concentrator 3<br>
is coupled to the up channel 2 by a modem when the up channel 2 is<br>
comprised of the public telephone network, and on the other hand, the<br>
watthour meter-reading concentrator 3 is connected to the down channel<br>
6 comprised of the low voltage power supply line through three carrier<br>
communication modules 11; g. the user watthour meter carrier module is<br>
connected at one end to the down channel 6 comprised of the low<br>
voltage power supply line through coupling capacitors, and is connected<br>
at the other end tc a pulse output terminal for user watthour meter 5,<br>
where a control relay receives ON/OFF control signal from a single chip<br>
computer, and a power output contact is connected in serial to output<br>
terminal for the phase line of the watthour meter.<br>
The process for user power-purchasing charging management and<br><br><br>
control is as follows: a. when the user purchases electric power, an<br>
operator logs into a selling management window in the watthour<br>
meter-reading and power-selling computer 1 after authenticating<br>
password, collects money for the user and prints receipt; b. the<br>
power-purchasing data information is sent to the carrier watthour<br>
meter-reading concentrator 3 by the watthour meter-reading and<br>
power-selling coriputer 1 through the up channel 2, and upon receipt of<br>
the user power-purchasing data by the watthour meter-reading<br>
concentrator 3, the watthour meter-reading concentrator 3 forwards the<br>
data to the user watthour meter 5 by carrier through the power lines 6; c.<br>
after the user watthour meter carrier module 4 receives this<br>
power-purchasing data information, a single chip computer within the<br>
user watthour meter carrier module 4 makes a judgment immediately,<br>
then stores the power-purchasing data to a power-purchasing date<br>
storage circuit in a specified format, and in the meantime, sends back the<br>
acknowledgement information on receipt of the power-purchasing data<br>
to the watthour meter-reading concentrator 3 by carrier through the<br>
power lines 6; the watthour meter-reading concentrator 3 then sends the<br>
acknowledgement information back to the watthour meter-reading and<br>
power-selling computer 1 through the up channel 2; d. each user<br>
watthour meter carrier module 4 collects the increment information on<br>
user's electric power consumption in real time, and compares it with the<br>
power-purchasing data every time the consumption adds by 1K Wh, and<br>
calculates balance; when the balance of the power-purchasing data is<br>
reduced to below the setting value, the carrier module 4 produces an<br>
acousto/optic alarm, and prompts the balance of the power-purchasing<br>
data; e. when the balance of the power-purchasing data is reduced to<br><br><br>
zero, the carrier module 4 operates the relay to cut the power off; f. the<br>
above process is repeat when the user pays money to purchase power<br>
again, and when the user watthour meter carrier module detects that the<br>
balance of the power-purchasing data is more than zero, it operates the<br>
relay to turn the power on.<br>
After the watthour meter-reading and power-selling computer 1<br>
sends the user power-purchasing data, if the returned information is not<br>
received or the returned data received is inconsistent with the transmitted<br>
value, this communication is deemed as failure and then automatic<br>
re-transmission is performed. If there is still failure with repeated<br>
re-transmissions for many times, it indicates that the communication<br>
channel cannot be used temporarily, and this transmitted value is then<br>
stored temporarily in the hard disk of the watthour meter-reading and<br>
power-selling computer 1, the operator will transmit again after one or<br>
two hours until transmission succeeds.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a schematic structure diagram of the carrier watthour<br>
meter-reading concentrator 3 according to one embodiment of he<br>
invention. In the carrier watthour meter-reading concentrator 3, a power<br>
module 7 provides required power to the concentrator 3. Information<br>
such as settings, watthour meter-reading commands or user<br>
power-purchasing data etc. from the watthour meter-reading database in<br>
the watthour meter- reading and power-selling computer 1 is transmitted<br>
to a modem 8 by the telephone line 12, and the modem 8 then performs<br>
demodulation and transmits the demodulated above information to an<br>
operation control circuit 9 via the RS-232 interface. The operation<br>
control circuit 9 serves to transmit the user power-purchasing data or the<br>
watthour meter-reading data, which is transmitted from the watthour<br><br><br>
meter-reading database or carrier communication modules 11, to a data<br>
storage circuit 10. The data storage circuit 10 is composed of a<br>
nonvolatile RAM (EEPROM, FRAM) device, which will not lose any<br>
data information even if power-off or the like occurs. Three carrier<br>
communication modules 11 are coupled to triphase power lines A, B, C<br>
through capacitois, respectively. The carrier communication modules 11<br>
serves to transmit the watthour meter-reading control command or the<br>
user power-purchasing data to the user watthour meter carrier module 4,<br>
on the other hand, the carrier communication modules 11 also serves to<br>
receive the reading data or the watthour meter-reading data<br>
acknowledgement information transmitted from the carrier module 4,<br>
and then forwards it to the operation control circuit 9. After the operation<br>
control circuit 9 receives the watthour meter-reading control command,<br>
the operation control circuit 9 transmits the watthour meter-reading cata<br>
stored in the data storage circuit 10 to the modem 8 via the RS-232<br>
interface, or the operation control circuit 9 may transmits the user<br>

The carrier signal on the power lines L, N is entered into the signal<br>
receiving circuit 14 through the coupling circuit 13. The carrier signal is<br>
pre-processed by the signal receiving circuit 14, and the pre-processed<br>
signal is entered nto the carrier signal demodulation circuit 15. The<br>
pre-processed signal is demodulated by the carrier signal demodulat; on<br>
circuit 15, and the demodulated digital signal are sent to the single chip<br>
computer system 16 to perform the identification operational process. If<br>
it is identified that the information is power-purchasing data information<br>
transmitted from the main station, then the power-purchasing data<br>
information is stared in the data storage circuit 20, and the<br>
acknowledgement data information to be returned is transmitted to tie<br>
carrier signal modulation circuit 21. The acknowledgement data<br><br><br>
information is transmitted to the carrier signal transmission circuit 22<br>

single chip computer system 16 compares a power counting value with<br>
the user power-pu -chasing data in the data storage circuit 20 to calcu ate<br>
the balance for the user power-purchasing data. If the balance for the<br>
user power-purch ising data reaches zero, a power-off command is<br>
output to the latch buffer control circuit 19, and in the meantime a<br>
power-off state dir.play signal is output to the operation alarming state<br>
display circuit 18. If the balance for the user power-purchasing date is<br>
smaller than a setting value (for example, l0Kwh) and larger than zero,<br>

is larger than or equal to the setting value (for example, 10Kwh), the<br><br><br>
original operation status is maintained. The processing program for the<br>
above-mentioned communication operation control and the like are all<br>
