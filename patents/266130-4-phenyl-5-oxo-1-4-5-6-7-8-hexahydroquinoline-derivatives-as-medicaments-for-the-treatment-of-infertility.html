				<td>4-PHENTL-5-OXO-l,4,5,6,7,8-HEXAHyDROQUINOLINE DERIVATIVES AS MEDICAIVIENTS FOR THE TREATMENT OF INFERTILITY<br>
The present invention relates to 4-phenyl-5-oxo-l,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydroqiÂ±iolme derivatives, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the same and to the use of said derivatives for the manufacture of medicaments for the treatment of fertility disorders.<br>
GonadotropiBS serve iir5)ortant functions in a variety of bodily fimctions including metabolism, temperature regulation and the reproductive process. Gonadotropins act on specific gonadal cell types to initiate ovarian and testicular differentiation and steroidogenesis. The pituitary gonadotropin FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) for example plays a pivotal role in the stimulation of follicle development and maturation whereas LH (luteinizing hormone) induces ovulation (Sharp, R.M. Clin Endocrinol. 33:787-807, 1990; Doirington and Armstrong, Recent Prog. Horm, Res. 35:301-342,1979). Currently, FSH is applied clinically, for ovarian stimulation i.e. ovarian hyperstimulation for in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and induction of ovulation in infertile anovulatory women (Insler, V,, Int. J. Fertility 33:85-97, 1988, Navot and Rosenwaks, J. Vitro Fert. Embxyo Transfer 5:3-13, 1988), as well as for male hypogonadism and male infertility.<br>
The gonadotropin FSH is released from the anterior pituitary under the influence of gonadotropin-releasing hormone and estrogens, and from tiie placenta during pregnancy. In the female, FSH acts on the ovaries promoting development of follicles and is the major hormone regulating secretion of estrogens. In the male, FSH is responsible for the integrity of the seminiferous tubules and acts on Sertoli cells to support gametogenesis. Purified FSH is used clinically to treat infertility in femdes and for some types of feilure of spermatogenesis in males. Gonadotropins destined for therapeutic purposes can be isolated from human urine sources and are of low purity (Morse et al, Amer. J. Reproduct. finmimol. and Microbiology 17:143, 1988), Alternatively, they may be prepared as recombinant gonadotropins. Recombinant human FSH is available commercially and is being used in assisted reproduction (Olijve et al. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2:371,1996; Devroey et al. Lancet 339:1170,1992).<br><br>
The actions of the FSH honnone are mediated by a specific plasma membrane receptor that is a member of the large family of G-protein coupled receptors. These receptors consist of a single polypeptide with seven transmembrane domains and are able to interact with the Gs protein, leading to the activation of adenylate cyclase.<br>
The FSH receptor is a highly specific target in the ovarian follicle growth process and is exclusively expressed in the ovary. Blocking of the receptor or inhibiting the signalling which is normally induced after FSH-mediated receptor activation will disturb folhcle development and thus ovulation and fertility. Low molecular weight FSH antagonists could form the basis for new contraceptives, while low molecular weight FSH agonists may be used for the same clinical purposes as native FSH, ie. for the treatment of infertility and for ovarian hyperstimulation on behalf of in vitro fertilisation.<br>
Low molecular weight FSH mimetics with agonistic properties were disclosed in the Intemational AppUcation WO 2000/08015 (Applied Research Systems ARS Holding N.V.) and in WO 2002/09706 (Affymax Research Institute), Certain tetrahydroquinoline derivatives have recently been disclosed in the Intemational Application WO 2003/004028 (AKZO NOBEL N.V.) as FSH modulating substances, either having agonistic or antagonistic properties. There remains a need for low molecular weight hormone mimetics that selectively activate the FSH receptor.<br>
To that aim the present invention provides 4-phenyl-5-oxo-l,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydroquinoline derivatives of general formula I<br><br><br>

Suitable general methods for the preparation of the compoimds axe outlined below.<br><br><br>
In some cases, the R^-groups con^rising functional groups may need additional tenporary protection depending on the type of reaction to be perfonned, which will be easily recognized by a person skilled in the art (see Protective groups in Organic Synthesis, T.W. Greene and P.G,M. Wuts, John Wiley &amp; sons, Inc., New York, 1999).<br>
The 4-phenyl-5-oxo-l,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydroquinoline derivatives of formula I, wherein R\ R^ R^ R\ X, Y and Z are as previously defined, may be prepared following several strategies. Method A starts from appropriately functionalised 4-phenyl-5-oxo-1,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydroquinoline derivatives of general structure H, wherein R\ R^, R\ X, Y and Z are as previously defined and FGl is a fimctional groiip, such as nitro, azido, (optionally protected) amino, (optionally protected) hydroxyl, carboxylic acid, sulfonyl chloride and the like, which may be converted to groi5)S defined for R .<br><br>
For example, iV-acylation or 7V-sulfonylation of coinpounds of general formula Il-a yields compounds of general formula I-a, wherein R, R, R, X, Y and Z are as previously defined, R^ is H and R^ is an acyl or sulfonyl grojxp.<br>
In a typicd e3q)eriment, compounds Il-a are reacted in a solvent, such as dichloromethane, ^,^-dimethylfonnamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, ethanol, tetrahydrofiiran, 1,4-dioxane, toluene, l-methyl-pyTrolidin-2-one or pyridine with an appropriately substituted acyl halide, acid anhydride or sulfonyl halide in the presence of a base such as triethylamine, JV^iV-diisopropylethylamine (DiPEA) or pyridine, to give iV-acylated or iV-sulfonylated derivatives of formula I-a, respectively. Alternatively, JV-acylated con:5)ounds of general formula I-a may be obtained by<br><br>
reaction of derivatives Il-a with appropriately substituted carboxylic acids in the presence of a coiq)ling reagent such as diisoprqpyl carbodiimide (DIG), (3-dimethylaniinopropyl)-ethyl-carbodiiniide (EDCI), 0-(benzotriazol-1 'y[)-N,N,N\N'-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU) or 0-(7-azabenzotriazol-1 -yl)-iy;iV;i\r',JV'-tetrainetiiyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU) and a tertiary amine base (e,g, DiPEA) in a solvent such as iViiV^dimethylformamide or dichloromethane at ambient or elevated temperature.<br>
Compounds of general formula I-b, wherein R, R, R, R, X, Y and Z are as previously defined and R is a (l-4C)alkyl groiq), may be prepared by 7V-alkylation of derivatives I-a with appropriately substituted aUcyl halides of general formula R^-Hal. This reaction is typically conducted in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate, cesium carbonate, sodium hydroxide or sodium hydride in suitable solvents such as dichloromethane, JV^iV-dimethylformamide, ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide, tetrahydrofiiran or 1,4-dioxane.<br><br><br>
Alternatively, compounds of fonmda I-b may be obtained by reductive alkylation known in the art with alkyl aldehydes (e.g. acetaldehyde, (iso)butyraldehyde), acetone or butanone. Typically, con:5)ounds of general formula Il-a are treated with the appropriate carbonyl compound and a reducing agent such as sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium triacetoxyborohydride in a suitable solvent such as methanol, ethanol, dichloromethane, JV^AT-dimethylfotmamide or mixtures tiiereo^ optionally in the presence of acids such as acetic acid, to give compoimds of general formula Il-b. Compounds of general formula E-b may then be iV-acylated or N-sulfonylated to give compounds of general formula I-b by the same methods described for the preparation of compounds of general formula I-a ftom Il-a.<br>
Con^iounds of general formula Il-b may also be obtained via a 3 step sequence. First, compounds of formula Il-a may be converted to 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonamide derivatives II-c by ^-sulfonylation with 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride (DNS-Cl).<br>
The sulfonamide may be alkylated to give compounds of general formula Il-d by using art known Mitsunobu reactions with appropriately substituted primary or secondary alcohols of formula R -OH (R = alkyl), triphenylphosphine (optionally resin bound) and a dialkyl azodicarboxylate in appropriate solvents such as 1,4-dioxane, tetrahydrofiiran or dichloromethane at elevated or ambient temperature. Alternatively, the sulfonamide of general formula II-c may be alkylated using alkyl halides of formula R -Hal (Hal = CI, Br, I) and a suitable base such as K2CO3 in a solvent such as iV;iV-dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran or 1,4-dioxane. Cleavage of the N-S sulfonamide bond with a primary amine such as propylamine in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane then gives compounds of formula E-b. Alternatively, the N-S sulfonamide bond may be cleaved using mercaptoacetic acid and a tertiary amine base in a solvent such as dichloromethane. Precedence for these types of reactions can be found in literature. For example, see: Tetrahedron Lett. 38 (1997) 5831-5834, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 10 (2000) 835-838.<br><br><br>
Using the same methods described for the preparation of derivatives Il-b, compounds of general formula I-c are prepared, wherein R\ R^, R*, R^, X, Y and Z are as previously defined, by reacting compounds Il-a with (substituted) alkyl aldehydes or (cyclic) ketones (e.g. propionaldehyde, cyclohexanone, acetone or acetaldehyde) under reductive conditions or by alkylation of derivatives II-c with R^-OH or R^-Hal, followed by removal of the DNS-group. Confounds I-c may be reductively alkylated again using appropriately substituted aldehydes or ketones to introduce R^^, yielding confounds of general formula I-d, wherein R\ R^, R'^, R^, R^^, X, Y and Z are as previously defined In sonae cases, the reductive alkylation of Il-a may occur twice to yield coinpounds of general formiila I-d wherein R^ = R^*^ (e.g. when formaldehyde is used, R^ = R^*^ = methyl).<br><br>
Con5)ounds of general formula Il-a may be obtained by the reduction of the nitro group in compounds of general formula Il-e to the corresponding amino group. Typically, con:^ounds Il-e are treated with zinc dust and acetic acid in a suitable solvent such as<br><br>
THF or dioxane at ten^eratures between 0 Â°C and reflux temperature. Alternative methods include treatment with iron, SnCla, or hydrogen in the presence of a transition metal catalyst such palladium or platinum on charcoal, using methods and reagents well known to those skilled in the art. Alternatively, compounds of general formula Il-a may be obtained by cleavage of known ^-protecting groiq)S (= PG in formula Il-f) such as an allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc), fluoren-9-yl-methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) or tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group in compounds of general formula Il-f to give the corresponding derivatives Il-a Related protective group n^nipulations can be found in Protective groups in Organic Synthesis, T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, John Wiley &amp; sons, Inc., New York, 1999.<br>
Carboxylic acid derivatives of general formula Il-h, accessible by saponification of corresponding alkyl esters Il-g, may be condensed with amines of general structure R^^*^NH using a coupling reagent as desaibed before for the preparation of derivatives I-a fi-om Il-a to give conipounds of fomiula I-e, wherein R\ R^, R^, R^, R^^, X, Y and Z are as previously defined. Alternatively, compounds of general formula Il-h may be converted to tiie corresponding acid chlorides of general formula Il-i by methods known in the art: treatment of carboxylic acids of general formula Il-h with<br><br>
thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride and DMF in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane or toluene gives the corresponding acid chlorides Il-i. Subsequent<br><br>

Con5)ounds of general formula I-:^ wherein R\ R^, R^, X, Y and Z are as previously defined and R is cyano, may be obtained by dehydration of amides of general formula I-g with trifluQToacetic anhydride and a suitable base such as triethylamine or pyridine in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane, 1,4-dioxane or tetrahydrofiiran at 0 Â°C or ambient temperature. Related dehydrations of amides to give aryl nitriles can be found in literature, for example, see: Org. Prep. Proced. Int. 26 (1994) 429-438, Acta Chem. Scand. 53 (1999) 714-720, J. Org. Chem. 57 (1992) 2700-2705. Compounds of formula I-g are prepared according to the synthesis outlined for derivatives I-e.<br><br>
Compounds of general fomiula II-j wherein R\ R^, R'^, X, Y and Z are as previously defined may be 0-alkylated with (substituted) alkyl halides E-Hal (E = aUcyl, fluorinated alkyl, alkoxyalkyl, hydroxyalkyl, (substituted) phenylalkyl or (substituted) heteroarylalkyl; Hal =C1, Br, I) by treatment with a base such as potassium carbonate or cesium carbonate in suitable solvents such as JV;JV-dimethylformamide, acetone, tetrahydrofiiran, 1,4-dioxane or l-methyl-pyrrolidin-2-one to give compoimds of general formula I-h, wherein R, R , R , X, Y and Z are as previously defined and E is alkyl, fluorinated alkyl, alkoxyalkyl, hydroxyalkyl, (substituted) phenylalkyl or (substituted) heteroarylalkyl. Alternatively, Mitsunobu conditions as described for the conversion of derivatives II-c to compoimds Il-d may be used to effect this conversion.<br><br><br>
Compounds of general formula I may also be obtained by manipulation of functional groi5)S FG2 in compounds of general formula lH (method B). For example, ftmctionalization of the amino group of compounds of general fomiula Ill-a in same manner as described for the conversion of derivatives Il-a into I-a and I-b, yields con5)ounds of general formula I-k, wherein R\ R^, R^, R^^, R^^, X, Y and Z are as previously defined, A is a (substituted) phenyl or a (substituted) heteroaryl ring.<br><br>
Compounds of general fijrmula I-l, wherein R\ R^, R^, R^^, X, Y and Z are as previoxisly defined, R^^ is H and A is a (substituted) phenyl or a (substituted) heteroaryl ring, may be obtained by reductive alkylation of compounds of general formxila Ill-a using the same methods described for the preparation of compounds Il-b fi-om Il-a or by the 3 step sequence described for the preparation of derivatives Il-b fi-om Il-a via 11-c and n-d. Reductive alkylation of compounds I-l with aldehydes or ketones in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium triacetoxyborohydride may afford<br><br>
coii5)oimds of general fonnula I-m, wherein R\ R^ R^, R^"*, R^^ X, Y and Z are as previously defined and A is a (substituted) phenyl or a (substituted) heteroaryl ring.<br><br>
Compounds of general fonnula Ill-a may be prepared firom compounds of general formula Dl-b or III-c in analogy to the preparation of compounds Il-a fix)m Il-e or 11-^<br>
respectively.<br><br>
Amide derivatives I-n, wherein R\ R^ R^, R^^, R^^, X, Y and Z axe as previously defined and A is a (substituted) phenyl or (substituted) heteroaryl ring, may be prepared fix)m carboxylic acids Dl-e, by the same methods (via acid chloride or by the use of coi5)ling reagents) that were described for the preparation of compounds I-e fi*om n-h.<br><br><br>
Similarly, esters of general fonnula I-o, wherein R\ R^, R^ R^"*, X, Y and Z are as previously defined and A is a (substituted) phenyl or (substituted) heteroaiyl ring may be obtained from derivatives Ill-e and alcohols of general fonnula R^^-OH using the same methods as described for the conversion of m-e into the corresponding amides I-a<br>
Compounds of general formula ni-e may be prepared from the corresponding aUcyl esters Ill-d by base or acid mediated ester cleavage, well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Derivatives of general formula I-p, wherein R\ R^, R^, R^^, X, Y and Z are as previously defined and A is a (substituted) phenyl or a (substituted) heteroaryl ring, may be prepared by alkylation of the hydroxyl group in compounds of general formula El-g with an alkyl halide of general formula R^^-Hal, in which Hal may be Br, CI or L Typically, such a reaction is carried out in an aprotic solvent such as N^N-dimethylformamide, 1,4-dioxane or tetrahydrofuran in the presence of a base, such as sodium hydride, potassium carbonate, cesium carbonate or triethyl amine at ambient or<br><br>
jlevated teirperature. Alternatively, convCTsion of confounds of general fonnula Ill-g Bto aryl ethers of general formula I-p may be accomplished under Mitsunobu-type iBcylation conditions. In such a transformation, alkylation of the hydroxyl group in ^onpounds of formula Ill-g is effected with alcohols of general formula R^^-OH under the agency of (resin bound) triphenyl phosphine and diethyl azodicarboxylate or its ierivatives in a suitable ^protic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or dichloromethane.<br><br>
Derivatives of general formula m-g may be obtained by cleavage of the hydroxyl-protecting groiq) in compounds of general formula IQ-f Suitable protective groups, well-ki^own to those skilled in the art, are the tetrahydropyranyl (TEIP) or tert-hntyl dimethylsilyl (TBS) protective groups. Cleavage of the THP and TBS groirps is generally accon5)lished by treatment with acids, such as hydrochloric acid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid or trifluoroacetic acid in a suitable solvent, such as tetrahydrofiiran or methanol. Alternatively, the TBS group may be removed by treatment with tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofiiran. Related protective group manipulations can be found in Protective groups in Organic Synthesis, T.W. Greene and P.G,M. Wuts, John Wiley &amp; sons, Inc., New York, 1999.<br>
Compounds of general formula I may also be obtained by manipulation of both functional groirps FGl and FG2 in compounds of general formula IV (method C), along the lines described for the conversions of con5)ounds of general formula 11 and in. The two functional groups can be, but do not need to be, identical. It is clear to those skilled in the art that the order in which the functional groups FGl and FG2 are<br><br>
modified may be crucial for a successftil synthetic outcome. Clearly, in some cases the iise of (orthogonal) protective groups may be necessary.<br>
For example, dinitro compounds of general formula IV-a may be reduced to the diamino compounds IV-b using the methods described for the preparation of derivatives Il-a from Il-e. Standard iV^acylation or iV-sulfonylation affords compounds of general formula I-q, wherein R\ R^, R^, X, Y and Z are as previously defined and A is a (substituted) phenyl or a (substituted) heteroaryl ring and R^^ = R^.<br><br>
To allow independent variation of the substituents (e.g. R^ and R^^) , the functional groups in compounds of general formula IV need to be fimctionalized in an orthogonal manner. For example, compounds of general formula IV-c may be functionalized using the same methods described for the synthesis of derivatives I-a, I-b, I-c and I-d from coii5)Ounds Il-a to give compounds of general formula IV-d, wherein R , R , X, Y and Z are as previously defined, A is a (substituted) phenyl or a (substituted) heteroaryl ring and G is NR^R^ or NR^R^*^. These compounds may be converted to derivatives I-r, whereia R\ R^ X, Y and Z are as previously defined, A is a (substituted) phenyl or a (substituted) heteroaryl ring and G is NR'^R^ or NRV^ and K is NR^^R^^ or NR^ V^<br><br><br>
Yet another possibility to amve at the desired compounds of general fonnula I may be the functionalization of compounds of general formula V (method D). Compounds of general formula V-a wherein X = O may be used to prepare compounds I-s, wherein R\ R^, R^ R'*, Y and Z are as previously defined and X = O, by O-aDcylation, O-acylation or 0-sulfonylation using standard conditions, well known to those skilled in the art. The substitution pattern of the (hetero)aryl ring in R"* is as previously defined. In a typical experiment, compounds V-a are reacted in a solvent, such as dichloromethane, TVi^-dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, ethanol, tetrahydrofiiran, 1,4-dio^ane, toluene, l-methyl-pyrrolidin-2-one or pyridine with an appropriately substituted (hetero)aromatic alkyl halide of formula IX, acyl chloride of formula X, or sulfonyl chloride of formula XII in the presence of a base such as triethylamine, ^,iV^diisopropylethylamine (DiPEA), pyridine, potassium carbonate, cesium carbonate or sodium hydride, optionally in the presence of a catalytic amount of potassium iodide or tetrabutylammonium iodide, to give 0-alkylated, 0-acylated or O-sulfonylated derivatives of formula I-s, respectively.<br><br><br>
Alternatively, O-alkylated confounds of general formula I-s in which Y = CH2 may be obtained by using art known Mitsunobu reactions with alcohols of formula Xin, triphenylphosphine (optionally resin bound) and a dialkyl azodicarboxylate (e.g. diethyl azodicarboxylate) in appropriate solvents such as 1,4-dioxane, tetrahydro&amp;ran or dichloromethane at elevated or ambient temperature.<br>
Additionally, 0-acylated confounds of general formula I-s, wherein Y = C(0) may be obtained by reaction of a (hetero)aromatic carboxylic acid of formula XI in the presence of a coi5)ling reagent such as diisopropyl carbodiimide (DIG), (3-dimethylaminopropyl)-eihyl-cafbodiimide (EDCI), 0-(benzotriazol-l-yl)-JV;JV;^',JV'-tetramethyluTonium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU) or 0-(7-azabenzotriazol-l-yl)-^,7^,JV^',^'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU) and a tertiary amine base {e.g, DiPEA) in a solvent such as ^,iV^dimethylformamide or dichloromethane at ambient or elevated temperature.<br>
Likewise, compounds of general formula I-t may be prq)ared from compounds V-b by iV^aDcylation, ^-acylation or iV-sulfonylation using the same methods described for the synthesis of compounds I-s using the reagents of formula IX-Xin. Additionally, compounds of general formula I-t in which Y = CH2 may be prepared by reductive amination of (hetero)aromatic aldehydes of formula XIV with compounds V-b and a suitable reducing agent such as sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium triacetoxyborohydride. Alternatively, compounds of general formula V-b may be converted to the corresponding benzimines iq)on reaction with (hetero)aromatic aldehydes XTV by methods known to those skilled in the art, followed by reduction with a reducing agent such as sodiimi borohydride to give compounds I-t in which Y = CH2.<br><br><br>
Conq^o^^ds of general formula I-t wherein R\ R^ R^, R'^, Y and Z are as previously defined and X is NH may be iV-alkylated by the same methods as described for the preparation of derivatives I-b from I-a (if Y = C(0) or SO2) or by the same methods as described for the preparation of derivatives conrpoxmds Il-b from Il-a (if Y = CH2) to afford compounds of general formula I-u, wherein R^^ is a (MQalkyl group.<br>
Con:5)ounds of general formula I, wherein R\ R^, R^ R*, X, Y and Z are as previously defined, may also be prepared starting from cyclohexane-l,3-diones of general formula VI, enamines of general formula Vn and benzaldehydes of general formula Vni-a-b, by the well-documented three component Hantzsch-type cyclo-condensation reaction (Method E).<br><br>

The coiripounds of the present invention possess at least two chiral carbon atoms and may therefore be obtained as pure enantiomers, or as a mixture of enantiomers, or as a mixture of diastereomers. Methods for obtaining the pure enantiomers are well known in the art, e.g. crystallization of salts which are obtained from optically active acids and the racemic mixture, or chromatography using chiral columns. For separation of diastereomers, straight phase or reversed phase columns may be used.<br>
The compounds of the invention may form hydrates or solvates. It is known to those of skill in the art that charged compounds form hydrated species when lyophilized with . water, or form solvated species when concentrated in a solution with an appropriate organic solvent. The compotmds of this invention include the hydrates or solvates of the con:q)ounds listed.<br>
The 4-phenyl-5-oxo-l,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydroquinoline derivatives of the invention were found to agonists of the FSH receptor. Methods to determine receptor binding, as well as in vitro and in vivo assays to determine biological activity, of gonadotropins are well known. In general, expressed receptor is contacted with the compound to be tested and binding or stimulation or inhibition of a functional response is measured.<br>
To treasure a functional response, isolated DNA encoding the FSH receptor gene, preferably the human receptor, is expressed in sxiitable host cells. Such a cell might be the Chinese Hamster Ovary cell, but other cells are also suitable. Preferably the cells are of mammalian origin (Jia et al, MoLEndocrin., 5:759-776,1991).<br>
Methods to construct recombinant FSH expressing ceU lines are well known in the art (Sambrook et al.. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, latest edition). Expression of receptor is attained by expression of the DNA encoding the desired protein. Techniques for site directed mutagenesis, ligation of additional sequences, PCR, and construction of suitable expression systems are all, by now, well known in the art. Portions, or all, of the DNA encoding the desired protein may be constructed synthetically using standard solid phase techniques, preferably to include restriction sites for ease of ligation. Suitable control elements for transcription and translation of the included coding sequence may be provided to the DNA coding sequences. As is well known, expression systraas are<br><br>
now available which are compatible with a wide variety of hosts, including prokaryotic hosts such as bacteria and eukaryotic hosts such as yeast, plant cells, insect cells, xnatnmalian cells, avian cells and the like.<br>
Cells e^ressing the receptor are then contacted with the test compound to observe binding, or stimulation or inhibition of a functional response.<br>
Alternatively, isolated ceU membranes containing the expressed receptor may be used to measure binding of the test compoimd.<br>
For measurement of binding, radioactive or fluorescent compounds may be used As reference compound human recombinant FSH can be used.<br>
In the alternative, also competition binding assays may be performed.<br>
Another assay involves screening for FSH receptor agonist compounds by determining stimulation of receptor mediated cAMP accumulation. Thus, such a method involves expression of the receptor on the cell surface of a host cell and exposing the cell to the test compound. The amount of cAMP is then measured. The level of cAMP will be increased, by the stimulating effect of the test conipound upon binding to the receptor.<br>
In addition to direct measurement of e.g. cAMP levels in the exposed cell, cells lines can be used which in addition to transfection with receptor encoding DNA are also transfected with a second DNA encoding a rq)orter gene the expression of which responds to the level of cAMP. Such reporter genes might be cAMP inducible or might be constructed in such a way that they are connected to novel cAMP responsive elements. In general, reporter gene expression might be controlled by any response element reacting to changing levels of cAMP. Suitable rq)orter genes are e.g. LacZ, alkaline phosphatase, firefly luciferase and green fluorescence protein. The principles of such transactivation assays are well known in the art and are described e.g. in Stratowa, Ch., Himmler, A. and Czemilofsky, A.P., (1995) Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 6:574.<br>
The present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical coniposition comprising a 4-phenyl-5-oxo-l,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydroqxiinoline derivative or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof having the general formula I in admixture with pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliaries and optionally other therapeutic agents. The<br><br>
auxiliaries must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and not deleterious to the recq)ients thereof.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions include e.g. those suitable for oral, sublingual, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, nasal, local, or rectal administratibn, and the like, all in unit dosage forms for administration.<br>
For oral administration, the active ingredient may be presented as discrete units, such as tablets, capsules, powders, granulates, solutions, suspensions, and the like.<br>
For parenteral administration, the pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, e.g. injection liquids in predetermined amounts, for example in sealed vials and ampoules, and may also be stored in a freeze dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of sterile liquid carrier, e.g. water, prior to use.<br>
Mixed with such pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliaries, e.g. as described in the standard reference, Gennaro, A.R. et al,, Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (20th Edition., Lippincott Williams &amp; Willdns, 2000, see especially Part 5: Pharmaceutical Manu&amp;cturing), the active agent may be compressed into solid dosage imits, such as pills, tablets, or be processed into capsules or suppositories. By means of pharmaceutically acceptable liquids tiie active agent can be applied as a fluid conposition, e.g. as an injection preparation, in the form of a solution, suspension, emulsion, or as a spray, e.g. a nasal spray.<br>
For making solid dosage units, the use of conventional additives such as fillers, colorants, polymeric binders and the like is contemplated. In general any pharmaceutically acceptable additive which does not interfere with the function of the active conipoimds can be used. Suitable carriers with which the active agent of the invention can be admioistered as solid compositions include lactose, starch, cellulose derivatives and the like, or mixtures thereof, used in suitable amounts. For parenteral administration, aqueous suspensions, isotonic saline solutions and sterile injectable solutions may be used, containing pharmaceutically acceptable dispersing agents and/or wetting agents, such as propylene glycol or butylene glycol.<br>
The invention further includes a pharmaceutical coirtposition, as hereinbefore described, in combination with packaging material suitable for said con^osition, said<br><br>
packaging material including instructions for the use of the composition for flie use as hereinbefore described.<br>
The exact dose and regimen of administration of the active ingredient, or a pharmaceutical coic5)osition thereof, may vary with the particular compound, the route of administration, and the age and condition of the individual subject to whom tiie medicament is to be administered.<br>
In general parenteral administration requires lower dosages than other methods of administration which are more dependent upon absorption. However, a suitable dosage for humans may be 0.05-25 mg per kg body weight. The desired dose may be presented as one dose or as multiple subdoses administered at appropriate intervals throughout the day, or, in case of female recipients, as doses to be administered at appropriate daily intervals throughout the menstrual cycle. The dosage as well as the regimen of administration may differ between a female and a male recipient<br>
Thus, the compounds according to the invention can be used in therapy.<br>
A fiiriher aspect of the invention resides in the use of a 4-phenyl-5-oxo-l,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydroquinoline derivative having the general formula I for the maniifecture of a medicament to be used for the treatment of disorders responsive to FSH receptor mediated pathways, preferably for the treatment of fertility disorders. Thus, patients in need thereof can be administered with suitable amounts of the compounds according to the invention.<br>
In yet another aspect the invention resides in the use of a 4-phenyl-5-oxo-l,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydroquinoline derivative having the general formula I for the manufacture of a medicament to be used for the treatment of fertility disorders.<br>

Agonistic activitv of compounds at the human FSH receptor expressed in CHO cells<br>
Agonist activity of the compoimds at the human FSH receptor was tested in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with the human FSH receptor and cotransfected with a cAMP responsive element (CRE) / promotor directing the e5q)ression of a firefly luciferase reporter gene. Binding of the compound to the Gs-coiq)led FSH receptor will result in an increase of cAMP, which in turn will induce an increased transactivation of the luciferase reporter constract The luciferase activity was quantified using a luminescence counter. The compounds were tested in the<br><br>
concentration range of 0.1 nM to 10 \\M. This assay was used to determine the EC50 (concentration of test compound causing half-maximal (50 %) luciferase stimulation) and efiBcacy of the compounds compared to recombinant human FSH. For this, the software program XL^ (Excel version 2.0, built 30, ID Business Solutions Limited) was used.<br>
The compounds described in the preceding examples all have an EC50 of less than 5.10"^. Some of the compounds, such as those of examples 2,10, 17, 19, 20, 24, 30-32, 36,37, and 39-42 showed an EC50 of less than 10"^ M.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
