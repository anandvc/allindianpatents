				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an electrodeless lighting system using<br>
microwave and particularly, to a method for manufacturing a mesh screen of an<br>
electrodeless lighting system, capable of intercepting microwave and passing light<br>
generated in a bulb.<br>
2. Description of the Background Art<br>
An electrodeless lighting system is a device for emitting visible rays or<br>
ultraviolet rays by applying microwave to an electrodeless lamp, and therefore,<br>
has longer life span than that of incandescent lamp or fluorescent lamp which is<br>
generally used, and has higher lighting effect.<br>
Figure 1 is a longitudinal cross-sectional view showing a general<br>
electrodeless lighting system according to the conventional art.<br>
The conventional electrodeless lighting system includes a magnetron 1 for<br>
generating microwave, a waveguide 3 for guiding the microwave generated from<br>
the magnetron 1, A bulb 5 for generating light as the material enclosed is plasma<br>
polymerized by the energy of the microwave transmitted through the waveguide 3<br>
and a mesh screen 20, covered on the front side of the waveguide 3 and bulb 5,<br>
for intercepting leakage of microwave and passing the light emitted from the bulb 5.<br>
The electrodeless lighting system additionally includes a high voltage<br>
generator 7 for transforming utility AC power to high voltage, a cooling apparatus 9<br>
for cooling the magnetron 1, high voltage generator 7 and the like, a reflector 11<br>
for intensively reflecting the light generated from the bulb 5 and a bulb motor 13<br>
and bulb shaft 15, for cooling heat generated in discharging light by rotating the<br>
bulb 5.<br>
In the electrodeless lighting system, when a driving signal is inputted to<br>
the high voltage generator 7, the high voltage generator 7 transforms a utility AC<br>
power to high voltage from the outside and supplies the high voltage into the<br>
magnetron 1.<br>
The magnetron 1 generates a microwave having very high frequency<br>
oscillating by the high voltage supplied from the high voltage generator 7 and the<br>
microwave generated as above is eradiated into the mesh screen 20 through the<br>
waveguide 3, then, the material filled in the bulb 5 is discharged to generate light<br>
having a very peculiar discharge spectrum.<br>
The light generated in the bulb 5 is reflected on the reflector 11 and the<br>
light is illuminated frontward as reflected by a mirror 12 and the reflector 9.<br>
Figure 2 is a perspective view showing a mesh screen used in the above<br>
electrodeless lighting system and Figure 3 is a detail view showing "A" portion in<br>
Figure 2.<br>
With reference to Figure 1, the mesh screen 20 formed in a metal mesh is<br>
assembled at the outlet portion 3a of the waveguide 3, intercepts the microwave<br>
transmitted through the waveguide 3 so that the microwave energy is transformed<br>
to be light in the bulb 5 and at the same time intercepts leakage of the microwave<br>
to the outside so that the light generated in the bulb 5 is penetrated to the outside.<br>
With reference to Figures 2 and 3, such mesh screen includes a cylindrical<br>
part 21 where a plurality of holes 20b are formed except in a part at an opened<br>
part 20a by the etching processing and a cover part 25 formed in a convex shape,<br>
where a plurality of holes 20b are formed to be connected to the from portion of<br>
the cylindrical part 21 by the etching processing.<br>
Here, the cylindrical part 21 includes a mesh portion 22 for intercepting<br>
microwave and passing light and a non-mesh portion 23 which is not etching<br>
processed to be fixed to the outlet part of the waveguide 3.<br>
Such mesh screen 20 must be formed precisely, penetrate light emitted<br>
from the bulb 5 well and have heat resistance so that it can resist against heat<br>
generated from the bulb 5, since it intercepts leakage of the microwave forming a<br>
resonance region.<br>
Here, the method for manufacturing such mesh screen 20 in accordance<br>
with the conventional art will be described with reference to Figure 4,<br>
Base metal is formed by cutting a metal thin film with a predetermined<br>
thickness made of stainless steel or phosphor bronze in. the sauare shape or<br>
circular shape.<br>
Holes having the mesh structure are formed by etching with solutions such<br>
as FeCI2 and the like to form a mesh structure on the base metal.<br>
Here, it is desirable that the holes formed by etching on the metal thin film<br>
are formed with a size, capable of intercepting leakage of the microwave to the<br>
outside having the highest opening rate so that the light emitted from the bulb 5 in<br>
Figure 1 is radiated to the outside as much as possible.<br>
When the mesh structure is formed in the base metal, the cylindrical part<br>
21 is manufactured by welding the metal to have a cylindrical shape as in Figure 2<br>
and then a mesh screen 20 with a side opened is formed by assembling by the<br>
method such as welding and the like.<br>
Then, electric resistance of the surface is decreased as the light reflectivity<br>
of the surface of the mesh screen 20 becomes higher and the mesh screen is<br>
completed by plating as a three-step structure, performing the Ni plating process<br>
for plating Ni on the mesh screen 20 to improve heat resistance, Ag plating<br>
process for plating Ag and the Rh plating processing for plating Rh.<br>
However, the mesh screen manufactured by the method for manufacturing<br>
the mesh screen in accordance with the conventional art, causes deformation of<br>
plated layers as residuals are evaporated at high temperature, if the mesh screen<br>
is exposed to the high temperature over 1000Â°C due to heat generated from the<br>
bulb 5, since various organic materials or acid radicals are remained when the<br>
plate of the mesh screen 20 is plated.<br>
Also, separation between plated layers is occurred when the mesh screen<br>
20 at high temperature is given thermal stress.<br>
Therefore, in case the mesh screen is manufactured in the conventional<br>
manufacturing method, deformation or separation of the plated layer is occurred<br>
and discoloration or oxidation corrosion is accelerated when the mesh screen 20<br>
is contacted with external air in the air cooling structure, thus to decrease security<br>
of the mesh screen 20 and shorten the life span.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Hereinafter, the embodiments of the present invention will be described<br>
with reference to the accompanied drawings as follows.<br>
Figure 5 is a flow chart showing a method for manufacturing a mesh<br>
screen of an electrodeless lighting system in accordance with an embodiment of<br>
the present invention and Figure 6 is a flow chart showing a vacuum heat-treating<br>
method in the method for manufacturing the mesh screen in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The method for manufacturing the mesh screen of the electrodeless<br>
lighting system in accordance with the present invention, as shown in Figure 5,<br>
includes a base metal forming step.S1 for forming base metals by cutting the metal<br>
thin film with a predetermined thickness respectively in the square shape and<br>
circular shape, a mesh forming step S2 for forming holes having the mesh<br>
structure by etching to forming the mesh structure in the base metal, mesh screen<br>
forming step S3 for forming a mesh screen with an end opened, by assembling a<br>
cover part 25 in a cylindrical part 21 after manufacturing the cylindrical part 21<br>
when the mesh structure is formed, a first plating step S4 for plating Ni on the<br>
surface of the mesh screen, a vacuum heat-treating step S5 for vacuum-heat-<br>
treating the mesh screen at high temperature up to 700Â°C, a second plating step<br>
S6 for plating Ag on the surface of the mesh screen and a photocatalytic coating<br>
step S7 for coating photocatalytic substance on the mesh screen.<br>
The process of each step will be described as follows.<br>
First, the material of the metal thin film is composed of stainless steel<br>
group or phosphor bronze in the base metal forming step S1 and the base metal<br>
for forming the mesh screen is processed, being cut in the square shape for<br>
forming the cylindrical part 21 and the circular shape for forming the cover part 25.<br>
Then, the mesh forming step S2 is a step for forming the mesh structure<br>
having a plurality of holes in the base metal manufactured in the base metal<br>
forming step S1 and the mesh structure is formed by etching the base metals with<br>
FeCI2. At this time, the holes forming the mesh structure are formed uniformly at a<br>
certain interval without a clogged portion.<br>
In the mesh screen forming step S3, the square thin film where the mesh<br>
structure is formed in the step S2 is welded in a cylindrical shape. After<br>
manufacturing the cylindrical part 21, the circular cover part 25 where the mesh<br>
structure is formed is welded-assembled on an opened surface of the cylindrical<br>
part 21. Therefore, a mesh screen with just a side opened is formed.<br>
Then, in the first coating step S4, metal substance, Ni is plated on the<br>
surface of the mesh screen manufactured in the above step S3 to improve plating<br>
adhesiveness and corrosion resistance.<br>
Then, in the vacuum heat-treating step S5, since impurities and dissolved<br>
gas can exist in the plated layer plated on the surface of the mesh screen in the<br>
above step S4, residuals such as the impurities, dissolved gas and the like are<br>
removed by heat-treating the mesh screen with high temperature about 400oC to<br>
700Â°C in a vacuum furnace where there is no gas reaction, thus to increase<br>
cohesion force between the surface of the mesh screen and Ni-plated layer and<br>
restrain reaction such as oxidization or decarbonization.<br>
As shown in Figure 6, the vacuum heat-treating step includes a<br>
temperature raising process S51 for inputting the mesh screen in the plated<br>
vacuum furnace and raising the temperature of the mesh screen from the room<br>
temperature to 700Â°C for an hour, maintaining vacuum degree as 10-7E Torr, a<br>
holding process S52 for vacuum-heat-treating the mesh screen from 600Â°C to<br>
700Â°C for about an hour, a coercive cooling process S53 for coercively cooling the<br>
mesh screen for about an hour and a natural cooling process S54 for naturally<br>
cooling the mesh screen to room temperature for about two hours.<br>
Here, in the holding process S52, impurities are removed by heat-treating<br>
the mesh screen in the vacuum furnace for thirty minutes to an hour, maintaining<br>
the temperature region of 600Â°C to 700Â°C.<br>
By vacuum heat-treating the mesh screen plated by Ni, as atomic diffusion<br>
is occurred through the interface from the Ni-plated layer to the mesh screen<br>
made of stainless steel, cohesion force between the plated layer and the mesh<br>
screen is increased and the Ni:plated layer is stabilized by burning out various<br>
organic materials having high acid radical and vapor pressure, generated in the<br>
etching and plating processes. Also, as the layer is strengthened by the vacuum<br>
heat treatment, heat deformation of the mesh screen is minimized so that the<br>
shape of the mesh structure is maintained as the initial designation size accurately.<br>
Also, Ni, which is a ferromagnetic body, loses magnetism at higher<br>
temperature than 360Â°C and accordingly, since it is heated to higher temperature<br>
than 400Â°C, magnetism of the Ni-plated layer is removed.<br>
Then, in the second plating step S6, Ag is plated on the surface of the<br>
nickel plating on the mesh screen vacuum-heated in the above step S5 to increase<br>
translucency of light and electric conductivity of the surface.<br>
At this time, metal either Pt or Pt group can be used to be plated, instead<br>
of Ag.<br>
Then, in the photocatalytic coating step S7, photocatalytic function is<br>
added by coating oxidized material containing TiO2 on the surface of the mesh<br>
screen coated by Ag in the above step S6.<br>
Here, the photocatalyst is activated when the catalyst faces light. Namely,<br>
when light is irradiated to the photocatalyst, the catalyst receives light energy,<br>
electrons move in the catalyst and the moved electrons cause chemical reactions<br>
such as strong oxidization, deoxidization and the like. At this time, the strong<br>
chemical reaction of the moved electrons oxidize contaminants around the mesh<br>
screen to be harmless substance.<br>
In the above, the photocatalytic substance composed of oxidized material<br>
containing TiO2 generates a photocatalytic phenomenon by wavelength range of<br>
380 nm or the lower among optical spectrum from the bulb.<br>
On the other hand, TiO2 photocatalyst is an n-type semiconductor and<br>
when ultraviolet ray (400 nm or the lower) is irradiated, hydroxy radical (*OH) and<br>
O2 having a strong oxidizing power are generated due to formation of the electron<br>
and hole. The oxidizing power dissolves the organic material into CO2 and water,<br>
thus to remove contaminants, preserve from decay and sterilization and deodorize<br>
in the water and air.<br>
Therefore, when the light generated in the bulb of the electrodeless<br>
lighting system is irradiated on the mesh screen coated by the photocatalytic<br>
substance, photocatalytic phenomenon that the photocatalytic substance is<br>
activated is occurred, thus to clarify various harmful gases or contaminants flown<br>
around the mesh screen from the outside.<br>
Through the above manufacturing method, the operation of the mesh<br>
screen will be described as follows.<br>
The mesh screen in accordance with the present invention can achieve<br>
chemical stability by removing acid radical, organic material and impurities<br>
generated in the etching process and nickel plating process, in the vacuum heat-<br>
treating process and accordingly, the mesh screen is not easily deformed or<br>
burned out in operating the lighting system under the condition of high<br>
temperature.<br>
Also, in the vacuum heat-treating process, since only interface of the Ni-<br>
plated layer is diffused to the mesh screen, joining force of the plated layer of<br>
stainless steel and Ni which are main materials of the mesh screen and high<br>
temperature stability can be achieved.<br>
Also, the mesh screen is strengthened by the vacuum heat treatment,<br>
deformation is minimized under the condition of high temperature and accordingly,<br>
the initial performance for intercepting microwave can be maintained for a long<br>
time.<br>
On the other hand, the mesh screen of the present invention increases<br>
translucency of the light generated in the bulb and improves the conductivity, since<br>
the mesh screen is coated by Ni and then coated by Ag on the surface, and the<br>
heat generated in the mesh screen can be transmitted to the outside, thus to<br>
prevent a partial overheating phenomenon.<br>
Also, the mesh screen in accordance with the present invention can self-<br>
control various harmful gases or contaminants around the mesh screen and<br>
improve optical character passing the mesh screen, in using the lighting system<br>
since photocatalytic coating is formed on the mesh screen.<br>
. Figure 7 is a flow chart showing the method for manufacturing the mesh<br>
screen in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The method for manufacturing the mesh screen in accordance with<br>
another embodiment of the present invention includes a base metal forming step<br>
S1' for forming base metals by cutting the metal thin film with a predetermined<br>
thickness respectively in the square shape and circular shape, a mesh forming<br>
step S2' for forming holes having the mesh structure by etching to forming the<br>
mesh structure in the base metal, mesh screen forming step S3' for forming a<br>
mesh screen with an end opened, by assembling a cover part 25 in a cylindrical<br>
part 21 after manufacturing the cylindrical part 21 when the mesh structure is<br>
formed, a first plating step S4' for plating Ni on the surface of the mesh screen, a<br>
vacuum heat-treating step S5' for vacuum-heat-treating the mesh screen at high<br>
temperature up to 700Â°C, a second plating step S6' for plating Ag on the surface of<br>
the mesh screen and a photocatalytic coating step S7' for coating Rh on the mesh<br>
screen.<br>
Here, when Ag is coated on the Ag-coated surface of the mesh screen,<br>
stability of the Ag coated layer is increased.<br>
On the other hand, a photocatalytic coating step for coating photocatalytic<br>
substance on the surface of the mesh screen can be included as described in the<br>
above embodiment, after coating Rh on the surface of the mesh screen.<br>
With the method for manufacturing the mesh screen of the electrodeless<br>
lighting system in accordance with the present invention, plating characteristic of<br>
the mesh screen can be improved and maintenance strength can be strengthened.<br>
Also, by endowing the clarifying function, the present invention can lengthen the<br>
life span of the mesh screen and improve the optical character.<br>
As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without<br>
departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, it should also be<br>
