				<td>VACUUM TREATMENT APPARATUS AND VACUUM TREATMENT METHOD<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a vacuum processing apparatus<br>
that has a degassing chamber, and more particularly to a vacuum<br>
processing apparatus that process a substrate in a high vacuum<br>
atmosphere after degassing the same.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
A vacuum processing apparatus for a substrate is carried in<br>
from air atmosphere has a degassing chamber in a stage prior to<br>
a processing chamber, and the substrate is heated in the degassing<br>
chamber to release absorbed gas, and then transferred into the<br>
processing chamber to perform vacuum processing such as thin film<br>
deposition and surface treatment.<br>
In particular, if the vacuum processing apparatus is an MgO<br>
deposition apparatus for forming an MgO thin film on the surface<br>
of the substrate, the substrate is mounted on a carrier in air before<br>
placed into the carry-in chamber, so that a large amount of gas<br>
is thus absorbed in the carrier. Accordingly, in the process of<br>
moving the substrate from the carry-in chamber into the processing<br>
chamber, the substrate and the carrier are transferred into the<br>
degassing chamber, to be heated along with vacuum evacuation as<br>
long as possible, in order to reduce the amount of absorbed gas<br>
 <br>
which is released from the substrate and the carrier, until the<br>
degassing chamber reaches a high vacuum atmosphere inside, and then<br>
the substrate and the carrier are moved to the processing chamber.<br>
For that purpose, vacuum pumps having an evacuation capability<br>
as large volume as possible are connected to the carry-in chamber,<br>
the degassing chamber, a buffer chamber, or the like as well as<br>
the processing chamber so as to carry out evacuation up to a high<br>
vacuum atmosphere.<br>
However, for high vacuum evacuation of the carry-in chamber,<br>
a high vacuum evacuation pump (turbomolecular pump or cryopump)<br>
needs to be connected to the carry-in chamber through a 20-inch<br>
or greater valve, and when processing substrates at a takt time<br>
of 80 seconds, the opening-closing frequency is 27000 times or higher<br>
a month, which causes requirement of an overhaul approximately every<br>
three months, resulting in valve overhauling and breakdowns being<br>
a major cause of apparatus downtime.<br>
Also, a plurality of degassing chambers have been connected<br>
in series, and a high vacuum evacuation pump (a combination of a<br>
cold trap and a turbomolecular pump, or a cryopump) has been connected<br>
to each of the degassing chambers (a back pump is further connected<br>
to the high vacuum evacuation pump).<br>
The vacuum evacuation systems are increasing in size due to<br>
such reasons as the increasing sizes of the substrates to handle<br>
and a demand for contamination reduction, in particular.<br>
As a result, MgO deposition apparatuses become high in price<br>
 <br>
and running cost, and require a wide installation space and facilities,<br>
and solutions thereof have been desired.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a vacuum processing apparatus<br>
that can perform processing in a high vacuum atmosphere at low cost<br>
without requiring a large-sized vacuum pump.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM<br>
The principle of operation of the present invention will be<br>
described.<br>
In a high vacuum atmosphere, the pressure P (Pa) , the amount<br>
Q of released gas (Pa-m3/sec) , and the effective evacuation speed<br>
S (m3/sec) have the relationship P = Q / S. Assuming that the amount<br>
Q of released gas is the amount of the absorbed gas released from<br>
a carrier and the substrate, the value of the amount Q of released<br>
gas may be regarded as a function of time alone, if the carrier<br>
and the substrate are heated to a constant temperature for degassing<br>
 <br>
in the vacuum atmosphere. In other words, the amount Q of released<br>
gas during thermal degassing is independent of the pressure of the<br>
ambient vacuum atmosphere during the thermal degassing.<br>
That means, while the processing chamber intended for<br>
processing needs to be connected to an vacuum evacuation device<br>
that can produce a high vacuum atmosphere, the degassing chamber<br>
for thermal degassing may be connected to an vacuum evacuation device<br>
that has an ultimate pressure lower than that of the vacuum evacuation<br>
device connected to the processing chamber, so that the thermal<br>
degassing can be performed at a pressure higher than heretofore.<br>
The present invent ion has been created in view of the foregoing<br>
findings, an embodiment of the present invention is directed to<br>

The present embodiment may also be directed to the vacuum<br>
processing apparatus wherein an MgO deposition source is arranged<br>
in the processing chamber; and MgO vapor of the MgO evaporation<br>

The present embodiment may also be directed to the vacuum<br>
processing apparatus which includes a plurality of the degassing<br>
chambers, the degassing chambers being connected in series, wherein,<br>
after the object to be processed is degassing processed in each<br>
of the degassing chambers, then moved to the processing chamber.<br>
The present embodiment may also be directed to the vacuum<br>
processing apparatus wherein the degassing chamber vacuum evacuation<br>
device has an evacuation speed that brings the pressure inside the<br>
degassing chamber to a pressure atmosphere of higher than or equal<br>
to 1 Pa and lower than or equal to 100 Pa; and wherein the processing<br>
chamber vacuum evacuation device has an evacuation speed that<br>
brings the pressure in the processing chamber to below 1 Pa.<br>

 <br>
and the processing chamber being put in a vacuum atmosphere, an<br>
obj ect to be processed, which has been heated and degassing processed<br>
inside the degassing chamber, being transferred into the processing<br>
chamber through the buffer chamber and vacuum processed inside the<br>
processing chamber, wherein the evacuation speed of a degassing<br>
chamber vacuum evacuation device connected to the degassing chamber<br>
is set to be lower than the evacuation speed of a buffer chamber<br>
vacuum evacuation device connected to the buffer chamber.<br>
The present embodiment may also be directed to the vacuum<br>
processing apparatus wherein the evacuation speed of the degassing<br>
chamber vacuum evacuation device is set tobe lower than the evacuation<br>
speed of a processing chamber vacuum evacuation device connected<br>
to the processing chamber.<br>
The present embodiment may also be directed to the vacuum<br>

space smaller.<br>
The carry-in chamber need not be in a high vacuum atmosphere,<br>
which makes vacuum evacuation system of the carry-in chamber need<br>
not be provided with a large-sized valve.<br>
From the graph of Fig. 4, it can be seen that as long as, in<br>
a buffer chamber prior to the processing chamber, vacuum evacuation<br>
up to a pressure that allows connection to the processing chamber<br>
is performed, the pressure of the carry-in chamber when evacuated<br>
to vacuum and the pressure of the degassing chamber when degassing<br>
may be higher than approximately three times heretofore.<br>
Consequently, the present invention allowed a significant<br>
reduction of the vacuum evacuation systems with an approximately<br>
5% to 10% reduction in device cost. The facility power, the amount<br>
of power for device operation, and cooling water were successfully<br>
reduced by approximately 5%. The installation space was<br>
successfully reduced by approximately 3%. In addition, by omitting<br>
unnecessary vacuum evacuation devices, the reliability of the entire<br>
apparatus can improve, and reduce the periodical maintenance cost<br>
as well.<br>

MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, the reference numeral 10 represents the<br>
vacuum processing apparatus to be used in one example of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The vacuum processing apparatus 10 includes a carry-in chamber<br>
15, a first degassing chamber 11, a second degassing chamber 12,<br>
a buffer chamber 13, a processing chamber 14, a cooling chamber<br>
17, and a take-out chamber 16. The chambers 15, 11 to 14, 17, and<br>
16 are arranged in this order, and are connected in series through<br>
gate valves 51 to 56.<br>
First and second degassing chamber vacuum evacuation devices<br>
61 and 62 are connected to the first and second degassing chambers<br>
11 and 12, respectively; a buffer chamber vacuum evacuation device<br>
63 is connected to the buffer chamber 13; and a processing chamber<br>
vacuum evacuation device 64 is connected to the processing chamber<br>
14. A cooling chamber vacuum evacuation device 67 is connected to<br>
the cooling chamber 17.<br>
To start a vacuum processing operation, the gate valves 51<br>
to 56 are closed and the vacuum evacuation devices 61 to 64 and<br>
67 are activated to evacuate to vacuum the inside of the first and<br>
 <br>
second degassing chambers 11 and 12, the buffer chamber 13, the<br>
processing chamber 14, and the cooling chamber 17 in advance.<br>
After the operation has started, the vacuum evacuation devices<br>
SI to 64 and 67 are respectively kept in operation to continue<br>
evacuating the first and second degassing chambers 11 and 12, the<br>
buffer chamber 13 , the processing chamber 14, and the cooling chamber<br>
17.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, an object to be processed 18 such as a<br>
glass substrate is set on a carrier 7 by a frame 19, thereby<br>
constituting a transfer unit 5; and a door 57 between the carry-in<br>
chamber 15 and air atmosphere is opened, to carry the transfer unit<br>
into the carry-in chamber 15.<br>
When a predetermined number of transfer units 5 are carried<br>
into the carry-in chamber 15, the door 57 is closed and the carry-in<br>
chamber 15 is evacuated to vacuum by the carry-in chamber vacuum<br>
evacuation device 65.<br>
When the interior of the carry-in chamber 15 reaches a<br>
predetermined pressure of approximately 100 Pa, the gate valve 51<br>
is opened to move one of the transfer units 5 from the carry-in<br>
chamber 15 into the first degassing chamber 11.<br>
First and second heating mechanisms 31 and 32 are arranged<br>
in the first and second degassing chambers 11 and 12, respectively;<br>
keeping the first heating mechanism 31 generating heat by applying<br>
electric current in advance, and then with the transfer unit 5 made<br>
to be opposed to the first heating mechanism 31 and the gate valve<br>
 <br>
51 to the carry-in chamber 15 closed to heat the transfer unit 5,<br>
absorbed gas that has been absorbed in the transfer unit 5 is released<br>
out from the transfer unit 5 with raised temperature into the interior<br>
of the first degassing chamber 11.<br>
The absorbed gas released from the transfer unit 5 is evacuated<br>
to vacuum by the first vacuum evacuation device 61. As the interior<br>
of the first degassing chamber 11 continues being evacuated to vacuum<br>
by the first vacuum evacuation device 61 and the amount Q1 of the<br>
released gas decreases with passage of time during the degassing<br>
processing, the internal pressure of the first degassing chamber<br>
11 also decreases.<br>
Because the first vacuum evacuation device 61 has an effective<br>
evacuation speed Si of the degree such that the degassing processing<br>
for a first degassing processing time which has been preset in advance<br>
can bring the pressure Pi inside the first degassing chamber 11 into<br>
the range of 1 to 100 Pa, after an elapse of the first degassing<br>
processing time, the gate valve 52 is opened to move the transfer<br>
unit 5 from the first degassing chamber 11 to the second degassing<br>
chamber 12.<br>
The transfer unit 5 is opposed to the second heating mechanism<br>
32 . With the gate valve 52 closed, the inside of the second degassing<br>
chamber 12 is evacuated to vacuum by the second vacuum evacuation<br>
device 62 while the transfer unit 5 is heated.<br>
In this embodiment, the transfer unit 5 is degassed in the<br>
second degassing chamber 12 for a second degassing processing time<br>
 <br>
that has been preset in advance.<br>
Like the effective evacuation speed S1 of the first vacuum<br>
evacuation device 61, the second vacuum evacuation device 62 has<br>
an effective evacuation speed S2 of the degree such that the degassing<br>
processing for the second degassing processing time that has been<br>
preset in advance canbring the pressure P2 inside the second degassing<br>
chamber 12 into the range of 1 to 100 Pa.<br>
In this embodiment, the effective evacuation speed S2 of the<br>
second vacuum evacuation device 62 is the same as the effective<br>
evacuation speed Si of the first vacuum evacuation device 61, however,<br>
because the amount Q2 of the absorbed gas released from the transfer<br>
unit 5 inside the second degassing chamber 12 is smaller than the<br>
amount Qi of the gas released in the first degassing chamber 11,<br>
with progression of the degassing processing in the second degassing<br>
chamber 12, an internal pressure P2 of the second degassing chamber<br>
12 becomes lower than an internal pressure P1 of the first degassing<br>
chamber 11.<br>
After an elapse of the second degassing processing time that<br>
has been set, the gate valve 53 is unclosed and the transfer unit<br>
5 is moved into the buffer chamber 13.<br>
The buffer chamber vacuum evacuation device 63 is a high vacuum<br>
evacuation pump and has an evacuation speed S3 higher than the<br>
evacuation speeds Si and S2 of the first and second vacuum evacuation<br>
devices 61 and 62, so that, with the gate valve 53 closed, the buffer<br>
chamber 13 is evacuated to vacuum by the buffer chamber vacuum<br>
 <br>
evacuation device 63, the pressure in the buffer chamber 13 drops<br>
quickly.<br>
In this embodiment, the buffer chamber 13 is provided with<br>
a buffer chamber heating mechanism 33 to which the transfer unit<br>
5 is made to oppose, and raise the temperature to nearly equal to<br>
the ones inside the first and second degassing chambers 11 and 12,<br>
in order to lower the pressure in the buffer chamber 13 while<br>
degassing.<br>
Since the processing chamber 14 has been evacuated to vacuum<br>
up to a high vacuum atmosphere in advance, after the internal pressure<br>
of the buffer chamber 13 is lowered to nearly equal to the internal<br>
pressure of the processing chamber 14, the gate valve 54 is opened<br>
in order to move the transfer unit 5 into the processing chamber<br>
14, and then the gate valve 54 is closed.<br>
The processing chamber vacuum evacuation device 64 is a high<br>
vacuum evacuation pump and has an evacuation speed S4 higher than<br>
or equal to the evacuation speed S3 of the buffer chamber vacuum<br>
evacuation device 63. The interior of the processing chamber 14<br>
can be reduced to a pressure which is lower than the pressure of<br>
the buffer chamber 13.<br>
An MgO evaporation source 3 5 is placed inside the processing<br>
chamber 14. The transfer unit 5 is arranged with the surface of<br>
the object to be processed 18 directed toward the MgO evaporation<br>
source 35, so that when MgO vapor is released from the MgO evaporation<br>
source 35, the MgO vapor reaches the surface of the object to be<br>
 <br>
processed 18 to grow an MgO thin film.<br>
After a predetermined thickness of MgO thin film is formed,<br>
the gate valve 55 is opened and the transfer unit 5 is moved to<br>
the cooling chamber 17 for cooling down, after the cooling the transfer<br>
unit 5 is moved to the take-out chamber 16.<br>
By transferring unprocessed transfer units sequentially into<br>
the processing chamber 14, the vacuum processing (the formation<br>
of the MgO thin film) can be performed on the plurality of objects<br>
to be processed in succession.<br>
After a predetermined number of vacuum-processed transfer<br>
units 5 are placed inside the take-out chamber 16, a door 58 leading<br>
to the air is opened with the gate valve 56 closed in order to take<br>
the transfer units 5 out into the air.<br>
Fig. 4 is a graph showing the relationship between elapsed<br>
time inside the vacuum processing apparatus 10 and pressure of the<br>
ambient atmosphere around a transfer unit 5, in which the horizontal<br>
axis shows the elapsed time, and the vertical axis shows the pressure<br>
(in an arbitrary unit).<br>
The origin point 0 of the horizontal axis represents the time<br>
when the degassing processing had started in the first degassing<br>
chamber 11,- the symbol tx represents the time when the transfer unit<br>
5 was moved from the first degassing chamber 11 to the second degassing<br>
chamber 12; the symbol t2 represents the time when moved from the<br>
second degassing chamber 12 to the buffer chamber 13,- and the symbol<br>
t3 represents the time when moved from the buffer chamber 13 to the<br>
 <br>
processing chamber 14.<br>
The group of curves represented by the symbol A shows changes<br>
in pressure when the present invention is applied. The group of<br>
curves represented by the symbol B shows changes in pressure in<br>
the conventional technology.<br>
If the transfer unit 5 is heated to the same temperature when<br>
degassing, the speed of release of the absorbed gas depends on the<br>
degassing time; in the case of the same release speed, the pressure<br>
of the vacuum atmosphere depends on the effective evacuation speed<br>
of the evacuation vacuum system, the pressure in the buffer chamber<br>
13 is therefore the same both in the present invention where the<br>
degassing is performed at a high pressure and in the conventional<br>
technology where the degassing is performed in a high vacuum<br>
atmosphere.<br>
While the vacuum processing apparatus 10 described above is<br>
provided individually with the separate vacuum evacuation devices<br>
61 to 67, it is possible, for example, to share one or a plurality<br>
of evacuation devices. For example, the vacuum evacuation devices<br>
65 and 66 of the carry-in chamber 15 and the take-out chamber 16<br>
may be shared.<br>
Up to this point, a description has been given on the embodiment<br>
where the pressure in the degassing chamber is brought into a pressure<br>
atmosphere of higher than or equal to 1 Pa and lower than or equal<br>
to 10 0 Pa, and the pressure in the buffer chamber is brought to<br>
below 1 Pa, nevertheless, the present invention may also be applied<br>
 <br>
to a vacuum processing apparatus inwhich the pressure in the degassing<br>
chamber is brought into a pressure atmosphere of higher than or<br>
equal to 0.1 Pa and lower than or equal to 100 Pa, and the pressure<br>
in the buffer chamber is brought to below 0.1 Pa.<br>
Next, another example of the method of the present invention<br>
will be described.<br>
The reference numeral 110 in Fig. 3 is a vacuum processing<br>
apparatus that can be used for the method of the present invention<br>
and which has a vacuum chamber 114.<br>
A substrate heating mechanism 117 is arranged in the vacuum<br>
chamber 114, and an object to be processed 118 is disposed opposite<br>
to the substrate heating mechanism 117.<br>
Vacuum evacuation devices c and 164 are connected to the vacuum<br>
chamber 114 through valves. The vacuum evacuation device with the<br>
symbol c is intended for roughing; and the vacuum evacuation device<br>
with the numeral 164 is intended for high vacuum evacuation. While<br>
the roughing vacuum evacuation device c evacuates the vacuum chamber<br>
114, the obj ect to be processed 118 is heated by the substrate heating<br>
mechanism 117, thereby the gas absorbed in the object to be processed<br>
118 is released and degassing processing is performed. The absorbed<br>
gas released is discharged into the air atmosphere by the roughing<br>
vacuum evacuation device c.<br>
The high vacuum evacuation device 164 includes a cryopump,<br>
however, with valve a between the high vacuum evacuation device<br>
164 and the vacuum chamber 114 closed during degassing processing,<br>
 <br>
the degassing processing is performed by the roughing vacuum<br>
evacuation device c. Since the cryopump is not connected to the<br>
internal atmosphere of the vacuum chamber 114, the cryopump will<br>
not absorb gas.<br>
During the degassing without using the cryopump, the interior<br>
of the vacuum chamber 114 is maintained at pressures of higher than<br>
or equal to 1 Pa and lower than or equal to 10 0 Pa. After the degassing<br>
processing on the object to be processed 118 is performed in such<br>
pressure range for a predetermined time, the cryopump is connected<br>
to the internal atmosphere of the vacuum chamber 114, to have the<br>
vacuum chamber 114 evacuated to vacuum at a high effective evacuation<br>
speed S5 of the cryopump, thereby the pressure of the interior of<br>
the vacuum chamber 114 is lowered to a pressure P5 (= Q5 / S5) that<br>
is determined by the amount Q5 of the released gas after the degassing<br>
and the effective evacuation speed S5 of the cryopump.<br>
An MgO evaporation source 135 is placed in the lower part of<br>
the vacuum chamber 114, and after the low pressure P5 is reached,<br>
MgO vapor is emitted from the MgO evaporation source 13 5 to form<br>
an MgO thin film of high quality on the surface of the object to<br>
be processed 118.<br>
Since the released gas during the degassing is not absorbed<br>
in the cryopump, the regeneration intervals of the cryopump can<br>
be lengthened without an increase in the processing time as compared<br>
to the conventional technology where the cryopump is used to create<br>
a high vacuum even during the degassing processing.<br>
 <br>
[Embodiment]<br>
Specific vacuum pumps for use in the vacuum processing<br>
apparatus 10 of the foregoing embodiment is as follows.<br>
The following table 1 shows the composition of the vacuum<br>
evacuation devices 61 to 63 and 65 of the vacuum processing apparatus<br>
10 in Fig. 1, the evacuation speeds of the vacuum evacuation devices<br>
61 to 63 and 65, and the pressures in the vacuum chambers when moving<br>
the transfer unit 5 to the subsequent vacuum chambers.<br>
 <br>
The chambers 11 to 14, 16, and 17 other than the carry-in chamber<br>
15 have been evacuated to vacuum in advance. The pressure of the<br>
processing chamber 14 when performing vacuum processing on the object<br>
to be processed IB is in the 10"2 Pa range.<br>
The carry-in chamber vacuum evacuation device 65 is an<br>
evacuation unit that is composed of a dry pump and a mechanical<br>
booster pump and has a total evacuation speed Si of 0.5 m3/sec.<br>
The carry-in chamber vacuum evacuation device 65 was activated<br>
 <br>
to evacuate to vacuum the carry-in chamber 15, into which transfer<br>
units 5 had been carried, from air pressure to a pressure in the<br>
range of 10 to 102 Pa, at which the carry-in chamber 15 was connected<br>
to the first degassing chamber 11 to have a transfer unit 5 moved<br>
to the first degassing chamber 11.<br>
The first vacuum evacuation device 61 and the second vacuum<br>
evacuation device 62 are vacuum evacuation systems, having<br>
respective pumping speeds S2 and S3 of approximately 1.0 m3/sec,<br>
that use a turbomolecular pump (and a back pressure pump) of wide<br>
range type for medium and high vacuum evacuation; while the inside<br>
of the first degassing chamber 11 was evacuated to vacuum by the<br>
first vacuum evacuation device 61, the transfer unit 5 was heated<br>
to release the absorbed gas and perform degassing for a predetermined<br>
time; and when the first degassing chamber 11 was evacuated to vacuum<br>
down to a pressure in the range of 1 to 10 Pa, the first degassing<br>
chamber 11 was connected to the second degassing chamber 12 and<br>
the transfer unit 5 was moved to the second degassing chamber 12.<br>
The second degassing chamber 12 was evacuated to vacuum by<br>
the second vacuum evacuation device 62, and while maintained at<br>
pressures in the range of 1 to 10 Pa, the transfer unit 5 was heated<br>
to release the absorbed gas to perform degassing for a predetermined<br>
time, after which, with the pressure in the range of 1 to 10 Pa,<br>
the second degassing chamber 12 was connected to the buffer chamber<br>
13 and the transfer unit 5 was moved to the buffer chamber 13.<br>
The buffer chamber evacuation device 63 is a high vacuum<br>
 <br>
evacuation system, with a total evacuation speed S3 of approximately<br>
8 0 m3/sec, using a turbomolecular pump and a cold trap (and a backing<br>
pressure pump) ; while the inside of the buffer chamber 13 was evacuated<br>
to vacuum by the buffer chamber vacuum evacuation device 63,<br>
the transfer unit 5 was heated to release the absorbed gas and perform<br>
degassing for a predetermined time. After the pressure of the buffer<br>
chamber 13 was lowered to the order of 10"3 Pa, the buffer chamber<br>
13 was connected to the processing chamber 14 and the transfer unit<br>
5 was moved into the processing chamber 14. When a process gas is<br>
introduced into the processing chamber for the process, the pressure<br>
of the buffer chamber may be lowered before the buffer chamber is<br>
supplied with the processing gas and then connected to the processing<br>
chamber.<br>
The processing chamber vacuum evacuation device 64 uses the<br>
same vacuum pump as that of the buffer chamber vacuum evacuation<br>
device 63, so that an MgO thin film can be deposited in a high vacuum<br>
evacuated state.<br>
A description will now be given as to a procedure when using<br>
a vacuum processing apparatus of a comparative example which has<br>
the same configuration as that of the foregoing embodiment, except<br>
vacuum evacuation devices.<br>
As in the foregoing embodiment, degassing is performed by<br>
heating the transfer unit 5 is heated in the first and second degassing<br>
chambers 11 and 12 and the buffer chamber 13. The following table<br>
2 shows the composition of the vacuum evacuation devices connected<br>
 <br>
to the respective chambers 11 to 13 and 15, and the pressures when<br>
moving to the subsequent vacuum chambers.<br>

In the vacuum processing apparatus of the comparative example,<br>
the carry-in chamber 15 is connected to an evacuation unit that<br>
is composed of a dry pump and a mechanical booster pump with a total<br>
evacuation speed of 4 . 5 m3/sec, and also to a turbomolecular pump<br>
(and a back pressure pump) with a evacuation speed of S.O m3/sec;<br>
the carry-in chamber 15 with transfer units 5 carried therein was<br>
initially evacuated to vacuum by means of the evacuation unit, whereby<br>
the pressure of the inside of the carry-in chamber 15 was lowered<br>
from air pressure to 10 Pa, then the evacuation operation was switched<br>
to the turbomolecular pump,in order to have the carry-in chamber<br>
15 evacuated to vacuum by the turbomolecular pump to lower the pressure<br>
of the inside of the carry-in chamber 15 from 10 Pa to 10"1 Pa, at<br>
which pressure a transfer unit 5 was moved to the first degassing<br>
 <br>
chamber 11.<br>
The first and second degassing chambers 11 and 12 are connected<br>
to respective high vacuum evacuation systems that are composed of<br>
a turbomolecular pump and a cold trap (and a back pressure pump)<br>
with a total evacuation speed of approximately 80 m3/sec; in the<br>
first degassing chamber 11, while vacuum evacuation was performed<br>
by its high vacuum evacuation system, the transfer unit 5 was heated<br>
and degassed, until the pressure of the inside of the first degassing<br>
chamber 11 was reduced to within the range of 10~2 Pa, at which pressure<br>
the first and second degassing chambers 11 and 12 were connected<br>
to move the transfer unit 5 into the second degassing chamber 12.<br>
The second degassing chamber 12 was also evacuated to vacuum<br>
by its high vacuum evacuation system, and while heating and degassing<br>
were performed with the pressure maintained in the range of 10~2<br>
Pa, the second degassing chamber 12 was connected to the buffer<br>
chamber 13 at a pressure in the range of 10"2 Pa.<br>
The buffer chamber 13 is connected to the same high vacuum<br>
evacuation system as those of the first and second degassing chambers<br>
11 and 12 (a high vacuum evacuation system using a turbomolecular<br>
pump and a cold trap (and a back pressure pump) with a total evacuation<br>
speed of approximately 80 m3/sec); while vacuum evacuation was<br>
performed by the high vacuum evacuation system, heating and degassing<br>
were performed, and the buffer chamber 13 was connected to the<br>
processing chamber 14 at a lowered pressure in the range of 10"3<br>
Pa, and the transfer unit 5 was moved.<br>
 <br>
As described above, when performing vacuum evacuation from<br>
air pressure, and heating and degassing the transfer unit 5 and<br>
thentransf erring the transf erunit 5 into the inside of the processing<br>
chamber which is in a high vacuum state, both the vacuum processing<br>
apparatus of an embodiment of the present invention and the vacuum<br>
processing apparatus of the comparative example were able to reduce<br>
the pressure from the air pressure to within the range of 10"3 Pa<br>
within the same time period.<br>
As compared to the comparative example, the vacuum pumps in<br>
the first and second vacuum evacuation systems 61 and 62 of the<br>
present invention have operating pressure ranges higher than those<br>
of the vacuum pumps of the buffer chamber vacuum evacuation device<br>
63 and the processing chamber vacuum evacuation device 64 ; assuming<br>
that the lowest pressure value in an operating pressure range is<br>
the ultimate pressure, the first and second vacuum evacuation systems<br>
61 and 62 have ultimate pressures higher than those of the buffer<br>
chamber vacuum evacuation device 63 and the processing chamber vacuum<br>
evacuation device 64.<br>
Consequently, according to the present invention, the carry-in<br>
chamber 15 need not be connected to a turbomolecular pump, and the<br>
first and second degassing chambers 11 and 12 can dispense with<br>
a cold trap, which reduces the device costs and makes facilitates<br>
maintenance easier.<br>
In this embodiment, the first and second degassing chambers<br>
11 and 12 are evacuated to vacuum by the first and second degassing<br>
 <br>
chamber vacuum evacuation devices 61 and 62 which are composed of<br>
a turbomolecular pump, however, a dry pump and a Roots blower pump<br>
(mechanical booster pump) may be used for evacuation instead of<br>
the turbomolecular pump. Moreover, the present invention is not<br>
limited to a vacuum deposition apparatus of inline type, but may<br>
be applied to a single substrate apparatus, a load lock apparatus,<br>
and a hatch-type apparatus.<br>
Fig. 5(a) shows such an embodiment of the present invention,<br>
where a vacuum processing apparatus 20 has a transfer chamber 29<br>
with a substrate transfer robot disposed is connected with a carry-in<br>
/take-out chamber 2 5 for carrying a transfer unit 5 in and taking<br>
the same out, first and second degassing chambers 21 and 22 with<br>
respective heating devices disposed, and a processing chamber 24<br>
for performing vacuum processing on an object to be processed of<br>
the transfer unit 5. In this embodiment, the processing chamber<br>
24 is a device for forming an MgO thin film or the like in a vacuum<br>
atmosphere or performing vacuum processing such as etching in the<br>
vacuum atmosphere, and the chambers 21, 22, 24, and 29, other than<br>
the carry-in/take-out chamber 25, are evacuated to vacuum in advance.<br>
Vacuum evacuation systems 75, 71, and 72, which are connected<br>
to the carry-in/ take-out chamber 25 and the first and second degassing<br>
chambers 21 and 22, are connected to dry pumps 75a, 71a, and 72a<br>
and mechanical booster pumps 75b, 71b, and 72b, respectively, so<br>
that for vacuum evacuation from air pressure, the dry pumps 75a,<br>
71a, and 72a are directly used for vacuum evacuation; at pressures<br>
 <br>
where the evacuation speed of the dry pumps 75a, 71a, and 72a descend,<br>
while the dry pumps 75a, 71a, and 72a evacuate to vacuum the backing<br>
pressure of the mechanical booster pumps 75b, 71b, and 72b, the<br>
mechanical booster pumps 75b, 71b, and 72b evacuate to vacuum the<br>
respective chambers 25, 21, and 22 (the transfer chamber 29 is<br>
connected to a high vacuum evacuation system which is not shown<br>
in the drawings and is thereby put in a vacuum atmosphere).<br>
In the first and second degassing chambers 21 and 22 , degassing<br>
is performed in sequentially at pressures of 1 Pa or higher, and<br>
after the amount of released gas has reduced, the transfer unit<br>
5 is transferred into the processing chamber 24 through the transfer<br>
chamber 2 9.<br>
The processing chamber 24 is connected to an vacuum evacuation<br>
system 73 which is composed of a turbomolecular pump, after the<br>
inside of the processing chamber 24 is evacuated to vacuum to 10"3<br>
Pa, then the vacuum processing is started, after which the transfer<br>
unit 5 is taken out into the atmosphere from the carry-in/take-out<br>
chamber 25.<br>
Since only the processing chamber 24 is provided with the<br>
turbomolecular pump, it is possible to put the processing chamber<br>
24 in a high vacuum atmosphere with the vacuum evacuation systems<br>
of low cost.<br>
Fig. 5(b) shows a vacuum processing apparatus 120 according<br>
to conventional technology, where a transfer chamber 12 9 is connected<br>
to a carry-in/take-out chamber 125, first and second degassing<br>
 <br>
chambers 121 and 122, and a processing chamber 124. The chambers<br>
121, 122, 124, and 129 other than the carry-in/take-out chamber<br>
125 are evacuated to vacuum in advance. The processing chamber 124<br>
and the first and second degassing chambers 121 and 122 are connected<br>
to respective vacuum evacuation systems 173, 171, and 172, each<br>
of which is composed of a turbomolecular pump, so as to be capable<br>
of vacuum evacuation to high vacuum.<br>
A vacuum evacuation system connected to the carry-in/ take-out<br>
chamber 125 includes a dry pump 175a, a mechanical booster pump<br>
175b, and a turbomolecular pump 175c, the carry-in/ take-out chamber<br>
125 is firstly evacuated to vacuum from air atmosphere by the dry<br>
pump 175a, the carry-in/take-out chamber 125 is then evacuated to<br>
vacuum by the mechanical booster pump 175b while evacuating to vacuum<br>
with the backing pressure evacuated by the dry pump 175a, until<br>
the pressure has been lowered to a pressure where the turbomolecular<br>
pump 175c is operable, after which vacuum evacuation by means of<br>
the turbomolecular pump 175c is started.<br>
In such a state, the object to be transferred 5 is moved to<br>
the first degassing chamber 121, to perform degassing sequentially<br>
in the first and second degassing chambers 121 and 122, while<br>
evacuating to vacuum by the evacuation systems 171 and 172,the in<br>
order to lower the pressure in the processing chamber 124 toapressure<br>
for vacuum processing.<br>
The vacuum processing apparatus 2 0 of the present invention<br>
evacuated to vacuum from the air pressure to the one in which the<br>
 <br>
vacuum processing could be started after heating and degassing,<br>
in the same time as the one that it took the vacuumprocessing apparatus<br>
120 of the comparative example, that had turbomolecular pumps<br>
connected to the carry-in/ take-out chamber 125, and to the first<br>
and second degassing chambers 121 and 122 , as well as to the processing<br>
chamber 124. This means the vacuum processing apparatus 20 of the<br>
present invention is lower in cost and easier to do maintenance.<br>
