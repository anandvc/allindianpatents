				<td>PIGMENT CONCENTRATE<br>
The present invention relates to a non-aqueous pigment concentrate comprising<br>
one or more pigments, one or more pigment dispersants, one or more resins,<br>
and optionally one or more solvents and/or diluents. In the paint industry, stock<br>
control and logistics are often rationalized by using colour mixing systems.<br>
These include systems where the paint formulation selected by a user is<br>
produced by selecting a base paint from a limited number of available base<br>
paints and tinting the selected base paint with the aid of one or more pigment<br>
concentrates or tinting pastes. In other systems, pigment concentrates are<br>
mixed with resin compositions to form a paint or toner of a colour and in a next<br>
step an appropriate selection of these toners is mixed to form a paint of a<br>
desired end colour. Pigment concentrates generally distinguish themselves from<br>
pigmented coating compositions in that they have higher pigment loads than<br>
colour strength requires.<br>
Pigment concentrates differ from coating compositions in their generally higher<br>
pigment concentration and the limited number of pigment types they contain -<br>
usually one, sometimes two. The pigments present in pigment concentrates are<br>
colouring pigments, whereas coating compositions generally also contain<br>
extender pigments and other functional pigments. Further, although pigment<br>
concentrates may be film-forming, the resultant films will not have the<br>
performance - as to solvent resistance, for instance - associated with coating<br>
compositions.<br>
For environmental reasons, it is desirable to reduce the emission of volatile<br>
organic compounds and, hence, the solvent content. To balance pigment<br>
concentrate viscosity requirements with a minimized volatile organic content<br>
(VOC), additional resins typically having a relatively low molecular weight can<br>
be used. Such resins can help also to prevent the agglomeration of pigments at<br><br><br>
the moment when the pigment concentrate is mixed into the base paint and<br>
help to compatibilize the pigment concentrate content with the base paint binder<br>
system. Non-volatile reactive and/or non-reactive diluents may also be used to<br>
reduce the VOC.<br>
Pigments of the various colours, pigment dispersants, diluents, and solvents<br>
can vary considerably in nature. Hence, it is often necessary to use a<br>
compatibilizer resin which is compatible not only with various types of<br>
dispersants and solvents but also with various types of base paint binder<br>
systems or let-down resins used to make toners. Also, the compatibilizer aids<br>
the incorporation of the colorant into the base paint.<br>
A pigment concentrate comprising a polyester resin is disclosed for example in<br>
WO 02/096997. These polyesters are oxidatively drying alkyds which do not<br>
have broad compatibility with other binder systems.<br>
WO 03/089522 discloses pigment dispersions comprising carbamate-functional<br>
polyester pigment dispersants. The carbamate groups serve as an anchoring<br>
group which is affinitive with pigment particles. The volatile organic content is<br>
high and substantially above 350 g/l.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a non-aqueous pigment<br>
concentrate comprising a resin which is widely compatible with different binder<br>
systems. A further object is to provide a resin which allows the formulation of<br>
pigment concentrates having a low volatile organic content (VOC).<br>
This object is achieved by a non-aqueous pigment concentrate comprising one<br>
or more pigments, one or more dispersants, and at least one resin,<br>
characterized in that the resin is a polyester comprising at least one oligo-ester<br>
building block with a hydrophobic tail linked thereto, wherein the hydrophobic<br>
tail is selected from the group consisting of: (a) branched hydrocarbons, (b)<br><br><br>
hydrocarbons containing a cyclic group, and (c) linear hydrocarbons, provided<br>
that when said linear hydrocarbon is linked to the oligo-ester building block via<br>
an ester group, the linear hydrocarbon contains 3 to 12 carbon atoms.<br>
The concentrate may further comprise one or more solvents and/or diluents, as<br>
long as the pigment concentrate remains non-aqueous, which is defined as<br>
containing less than 5 wt% of water, based on the total weight of the pigment<br>
concentrate. More preferably, the pigment concentrate contains less than 2.5<br>
wt%, even most preferably less than 1 wt% of water.<br>
The oligo-ester building blocks can be formed by reacting one or more<br>
anhydrides and/or the corresponding dicarboxylic acids with one or more diols<br>
and/or monoepoxides having a pendant hydrophobic group, thereby forming<br>
ester linkages. An example of a suitable monoepoxide is glycidyl neodecanoate.<br>
Surprisingly, it was found that such polyesters are compatible with a wide range<br>
of binder resins and solvent types.<br>
The term "oligo-ester building block" is defined as a building block which<br>
contains at least one ester group and is linked to other building blocks of the<br>
polyester by at least one ester group.<br>
The polyester present in the pigment concentrate according to the present<br>
invention contains on average at least 1, preferably 2-7, more preferably 2-5,<br>
and most preferably 3-5 oligo-ester building blocks.<br>
The oligo-ester building block can have a structure according to the following<br>
formula:<br><br><br>
wherein: Q =	a covalent bond or a hydrocarbon radical with at least<br>
one, preferably 1-4, more preferably 2-4, and most<br>
preferably 2 carbon atoms;<br>
X =	a divalent, optionally branched and/or substituted,<br>
radical, e.g., a saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon<br>
radical containing at least 2 carbon atoms, optionally<br>
comprising further ester groups;<br>
Y =	a trivalent hydrocarbon radical;<br>
Z =	a group linking the hydrophobic tail to the oligo-ester<br>
building block, or a covalent bond. Examples of suitable<br>
linking groups are ester groups, ether groups, C-C<br>
single or double bonds<br>
R =	the hydrophobic tail.<br>
Alternatively, building blocks having a similar structure but without the X group<br>
can be used. In another embodiment, oxalic acid can be used to introduce the<br>
ester groups. In that case, both Q and X are absent from the building block.<br>
As can be seen in the above structure, the oligo-ester building block contains at<br>
least one ester group and can be linked to other building blocks by ester<br>
groups.<br>
Oligo-ester building blocks wherein Q and X are present to form a ring can for<br>
example be obtained by esterifying cyclic anhydrides or their corresponding<br><br><br>
dicarboxylic acids possessing cyclic groups with groups bearing a hydrophobic<br>
tail. The anhydride can for example be a cyclic anhydride of unsaturated,<br>
aromatic and/or saturated cyclic or acyclic dicarboxylic acids. The anhydride<br>
can for example be phthalic anhydride, hexahydrophthalic anhydride, methyl-<br>
hexahydrophthalic anhydride, tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, or mixtures thereof.<br>
Suitable dicarboxylic acids are, for example, the carboxylic acids of the<br>
aforementioned anhydrides or, e.g., 1,3-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid or 1,4-<br>
cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid, or their cyclopentane or cycloheptane<br>
counterparts.<br>
Acyclic oligo-ester building blocks, wherein X is absent, can be obtained using<br>
for instance succinic anhydride, maleic anhydride, malonic anhydride, the<br>
corresponding dicarboxylic acids, or oxalic acid.<br>
Oligo-ester building blocks wherein X comprises an ester group can for example<br>
be obtained using tricarboxylic acids or their anhydrides, such as trimellitic<br>
anhydride.<br>
Any combination or mixture of the listed acids and/or anhydrides can also be<br>
used to obtain oligo-ester building blocks.<br>
The carboxylic acids or anhydrides can be linked by esterification with a<br>
monoepoxide bearing a hydrophobic tail to form the oligo-ester building block.<br>
Suitable monoepoxides are, for example, epoxidized olefins, such as<br>
cyclohexene oxide or epoxidized a-olefins, e.g., dodecene oxide, tetradecene<br>
oxide, and octadecene oxide; glycidyl ethers, such as ethylhexyl glycidyl ether,<br>
n-butyl glycidyl ether, t-butyl glycidyl ether, hexyl glycidyl ether, phenyl glycidyl<br>
ether; and the glycidyl esters of carboxylic acids, such as versatic acid glycidyl<br>
ester, e.g., glycidyl neodecanoate, commercially available from Hexion as<br>
Cardura® E10P or mixtures thereof. Other suitable examples are epoxy-<br>
containing aromatic hydrocarbons such as styrene oxide.<br><br>
Instead of or in addition to monoepoxides, diols can be reacted with the<br>
carboxylic acids or anhydrides to form the oligo-ester building block. Suitable<br>
diols include 1,3-propane diol, 1,2-ethane diol, 1,4-butane diol, 1,5-pentane diol,<br>
1,6-hexane diol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, polyethylene glycols,<br>
dipropylene glycol, and polytetrahydrofuran. Suitable branched diols include<br>
dimethylol propane, neopentyl glycol, 2-propyl-2-methyl-1,3-propane diol, 2-<br>
butyl-2-ethyl-1,3-propane diol, 2,2-diethyl-1,3-propane diol, 1,2-propane diol,<br>
1,3-butane diol, 2,2,4-trimethylpentane-1,3-diol, trimethylhexane-1,6-diol, 2-<br>
methyl-1,3-propane diol, tripropylene glycol, and polyoxypropylene glycols.<br>
Suitable cycloaliphatic diols include 1,4-cyclohexane diol, cyclohexane<br>
dimethanol and cyclic formals of pentaerythritol, and 1,3-dioxane-5,5-<br>
dimethanol. Suitable aralkyl diols include 1,4-xylylene glycol and 1-phenyl-1,2-<br>
ethane diol.<br>
If it is desired to obtain a branched polyester, polyols and/or polyacids may be<br>
used.<br>
Polyols include polyfunctional phenols, triols, and tetrols. Suitable triols include<br>
glycerol, trimethylol propane, trimethylol ethane, trimethylol butane, 3,5,5-<br>
trimethyl-2,2-dihydroxyrnethylhexan-1-ol, and 1,2,6-hexane triol. Alternatively,<br>
cycloaliphatic and aralkyl triols and/or corresponding adducts with alkylene<br>
oxides or derivatives thereof can be used. Suitable tetrols include erythritol,<br>
pentaerythritol, ditrimethylol propane, diglycerol, and ditrimethylol ethane. It is<br>
also possible to use cycloaliphatic and/or aralkyl tetrols as well as<br>
corresponding adducts with alkylene oxides or derivatives thereof. Polyols with<br>
even more hydroxyl groups, such as dipentaerythritol, dulcitol, and threitol, can<br>
also be used. Such polyols are particularly useful as starter molecules to obtain<br>
branched star-shaped molecules.<br>
Suitable polyacids include 1,2,4-butane tricarboxylic acid and trimellitic acid.<br>
Acid alcohols, such as tartaric acid and 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl) propanoic acid,<br>
can be used additionally or alternatively.<br><br>
A polyester prepared with pentaerythritol as a starter molecule can have the<br>
following structure:<br><br>
wherein R is the hydrophobic tail.<br>
Optionally, the polyesters may contain a repetition of oligo-ester building blocks<br>
formed from the alternating reaction of a cyclic anhydride or diacid with a<br>
(mono)epoxide or diol. This can for example be initiated by a monofunctional,<br>
difunctional or polyfunctional starter molecule and can be catalyzed, for<br>
instance by catalysts such as zinc salts, e.g., zinc acetate.<br>
Monoalcohols can for instance be used as a starter molecule. Suitable mono-<br>
functional alcohols for use as starter molecules include linear alcohols, such as<br>
methanol, ethanol, hexanol, butanol, octanol, hexadecanol, etc., branched<br>
alcohols, such as iso-propanol, 2-ethylhexanol, etc., cycloaliphatic alcohols,<br>
such as cyclohexanol, aralkyl alcohols, such as benzyl alcohol, or phenol.<br><br>
For example, a polyester prepared with 2-ethylhexanol, hexahydrophthalic<br>
anhydride, and a glycidyl ester can have the following structure:<br><br>
wherein R is the hydrophobic tail, e.g. a hydrocarbon group, and n &gt; 0,<br>
preferably 0-6, more preferably 1-5, and most preferably 2-4. Another example<br>
is a similar polyester with groups derived from glycidyl ethers.<br>
Other possible starter molecules are amines. Suitable primary amines include<br>
monoamines, e.g. alkyl amines such as butyl amine, and diamines, e.g.,<br>
alkylene diamines such as ethylene diamine. Secondary monoamines, such as<br>
piperidine, dialkyl amine, e.g. dibutyl amine, or diamines, such as piperazine,<br>
can also be used.<br>
Suitable carboxylic acid-functional starter molecules include monoacids, such<br>
as 2-ethylbutyric acid, or cyclohexane carboxylic acid, diacids, such as adipic<br>
acid or 1,4-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid, and polyacids, such as 1,2,4-butane<br>
tricarboxylic acid.<br>
Monothiols, such as dodecane thiol, dithiols, or polythiols, such as<br>
pentaerythritol tetrakis (3-mercaptopropionate), can also be used as starter<br>
molecules. Further, blends of two or more of the aforementioned starter<br>
molecules can be used. Alternatively or additionally, starter molecules of mixed<br>
functionality can be used, such as acid alcohols, amine alcohols, aminoacids,<br>
aminothiols, acid thiols, thiol alcohols or starters having more than two different<br>
functionalities. Suitable acid alcohols include tartaric acid and 2,2-bis-<br>
(hydroxymethyl) propanoic acid. Suitable amine alcohols include<br><br><br>
diethanolamine and 1-(2-hydroxyethyl) piperazine. A suitable example of an<br>
acid thiol is 3-mercaptopropanoic acid. A suitable example of a thiol alcohol is<br>
2-thioethanol. Polymeric starters, such as acrylic polyols and acrylic acid<br>
alcohols, may also be used.<br>
If desired, the hydroxy-functional starter molecules may be generated in situ, for<br>
instance via the reaction of an epoxide with a monocarboxylic acid. A suitable<br>
epoxide is for example glycidyl neodecanoate. Other means of generating the<br>
hydroxyl group in situ include the reaction of an epoxide with an amine, thiol or<br>
phenol or the reaction of a cyclic lactone, e.g., £-caprolactone, with an amine,<br>
an alcohol or a thiol.<br>
If a monofunctional starter molecule is used, the resulting polyester will contain<br>
a tail originating from said starter molecule on one end of the polymer chain.<br>
The present invention therefore also relates to a polyester consisting of (i) at<br>
least one, preferably 1-7, more preferably 2-6, and most preferably 3-5 oligo-<br>
ester building blocks with the hydrophobic tail linked thereto, and (ii) a tail<br>
originating from a monofunctional starter molecule on one end of the polymer<br>
chain, said monofunctional starter molecule being selected from the group<br>
consisting of alcohols, amines, carboxylic acids, and thiols. Preferably, the<br>
hydrophobic tail is linked to the oligo-ester building block by an ester group. The<br>
monofunctional starter molecule preferably is a branched mono-alcohol, such<br>
as 2-alkyl alkanol, e.g. 2-ethylhexanol.<br>
So, when the monofunctional starter molecule is 2-ethylhexanol, the resulting<br>
polymer chain will contain a 2-ethylhexyl tail on one end.<br>
The polyester used in the present invention possesses hydrophobic tails. The<br>
term hydrophobic describes the tendency of a molecule or molecular group to<br>
pass out of or not penetrate into water, as defined in ISO 862: 1995. Hydro-<br>
phobic properties of molecules or groups are generally linked to the presence of<br>
hydrocarbon groups. The hydrophobic tails preferably comprise 4-20, more<br><br><br>
preferably 6-16, even more preferably 8-10, and most preferably about 9 carbon<br>
atoms. The hydrocarbon tails can be saturated, unsaturated, or aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon groups and they may be branched, linear, or cyclic. The<br>
hydrophobic tails can for example also contain ether and/or ester groups, such<br>
as groups obtainable by the ring opening of e-caprolactone by an acid or an<br>
alcohol. However, it is essential that when the hydrophobic tail is a linear<br>
hydrocarbon linked to the oligo-ester building block via an ester group (i.e. when<br>
Z is an ester group), the linear hydrocarbon contains 3 to 12 carbon atoms.<br>
Preferably, the polyester has an acid value below 20 mg KOH/g, more<br>
preferably below 10 mg KOH/g, most preferably below 5 mg KOH/g. To reduce<br>
the acid value of the end product, an acid-reactive compound, such as a<br>
monoalcohol or monoepoxide, can be used for reaction with the terminal<br>
carboxylic acid groups of the polyester. Suitable compounds include the<br>
monoepoxides and monoalcohols listed above.<br>
Optionally, the polyester resin may have hydroxyl-functional groups. In that<br>
case, they can be reacted in paint systems based on crosslinking with OH-<br>
reactive crosslinkers, such as isocyanates. The polyester preferably has a<br>
hydroxyl value of 0-250 mg KOH/g, more preferably 0-160 mg KOH/g. The<br>
hydroxyl value can be lowered, for example by reaction with OH-reactive<br>
compounds, such as acetic anhydride.<br>
Whereas in WO 03/089522 polyesters with carbamate pigment anchoring<br>
groups are used as dispersants, the polyesters of the present invention are<br>
used as compatibilizer resins and combined with dispersants in the pigment<br>
concentrate. These dispersants typically comprise a polymeric part and one or<br>
more pigment-affinitive groups. Often, these dispersants are built as comb<br>
polymers having one or more polymer chains and one or more pigment-affinitive<br>
groups. Generally, a dispersant with a single polymer chain has a pigment-<br>
affinitive group at a terminal position. Other types of dispersants can have a<br><br><br>
backbone with pigment-affinitive groups and have polymeric tails which are<br>
soluble in the solvent to be used. In order to be soluble in organic solvents, the<br>
polymeric tails can for example consist mainly of aliphatic hydrocarbon parts.<br>
Generally, the pigment-affinitive groups are groups with high polarity, e.g. ionic<br>
groups, such as carboxylic, sulphate, sulphonate, amine salts, phosphate or<br>
phosphonate groups. Non-ionic groups, such as carbamate, urea, amide or<br>
amine groups, can also be suitable pigment-affinitive groups. Suitable<br>
dispersants are for instance the Solsperse®, Solplus® and Ircosperse®<br>
dispersants, available from Lubrizol Advanced Materials, the Disperbyk®<br>
dispersants from Byk Chemie, the Efka® dispersants from Ciba, the Tego®<br>
dispersants from Degussa, and the Nuosperse® dispersants from Elementis<br>
Specialies. The amount of dispersant can for example be at least about 0.1% by<br>
weight of the pigments used, e.g., at least about 2% by pigment weight. The<br>
amount of dispersant can for example be below 100% by weight of the<br>
pigments used, e.g., below about 10% by pigment weight.<br>
The pigment concentrate can contain solvents but may also be solvent-free if so<br>
desired. Suitable solvents include for example aromatic solvents, such as<br>
xylene, mesitylene, or the solvents marketed as Solvesso® 100 of Exxon.<br>
Aromatic-free solvents, such as aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents, e.g.<br>
isoparaffins; esters, such as n-butyl acetate; ethers, such as butoxy ethanol;<br>
ether esters, such as methoxy propyl acetate, or ketones, and alcohols, such as<br>
n-butanol, can also be used, as can white spirit. Alternatively or additionally, the<br>
composition may contain non-volatile reactive diluents, such as hexane diol<br>
diglycidyl ether, glycidyl neodecanoate, epoxidized linseed oil or benzyl alcohol,<br>
and/or non-reactive diluents, such as for instance dibutyl phthalate and liquid<br>
aromatic hydrocarbon resins, such as the hydrocarbons of the commercially<br>
available Hirenol® PL and CL series ex Kolon Chemical Company. Mixtures of<br>
any combination of two or more of the aforementioned solvents and/or diluents<br>
can also be used.<br><br><br>
The pigments to be used can be inorganic or organic pigments. Examples of<br>
inorganic pigments include titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, carbon black, iron<br>
oxides, bismuth vanadates, raw and burnt sienna or umber, chromium oxide<br>
green, cadmium pigments, and chromium pigments. Examples of organic<br>
pigments include phthalocyanines, quinacridones, anthraquinones, isoindolines,<br>
pyranthrones, indanthrones, derivatives of dioxazine, diketopyrrolopyrroles, and<br>
azo-compounds.<br>
The pigment concentrates of the present invention can also comprise effect<br>
pigments or luster pigments. These are platelet-shaped mono- or multi-layer<br>
pigments showing visual effects marked by the interplay of interference,<br>
reflection, and absorption phenomena. Examples are aluminium platelets and<br>
aluminium, iron oxide, and pearlescent or mica platelets bearing one or more<br>
coats, especially of metal oxides. Dichroic or colour shift pigments can also be<br>
used.<br>
Optionally, filler pigments may be added, such as clay, barytes, silica, talc,<br>
mica, wollastonite, and the like.<br>
High pigment contents can be realized in the pigment concentrates according to<br>
the present invention without the need to increase the solvent content, while<br>
maintaining a satisfactory viscosity. If organic pigments are used, the pigment<br>
content suitably ranges from 5-45% by weight, preferably from 25-40% by<br>
weight, based on the total weight of the pigment concentrate. If inorganic<br>
pigments are used, the pigment content may be more than 30% by weight, e.g.,<br>
40-60% by weight, or even higher, for instance in the case of titanium dioxide. If<br>
translucent pigments, e.g. translucent iron oxides, are used, the pigment<br>
content can be over 5% by weight, preferably over 20% by weight or even over<br>
30% by weight. If carbon black is used, the pigment content may for instance be<br>
10-20% by weight.<br><br><br>
Preferably, the pigment concentrate has a volatile organic content VOC not<br>
exceeding 250 g/l, measured according to EPA method 24 of the US<br>
Environmental Protection Agency. Preferably, the VOC of the pigment<br>
concentrate is low enough to allow formulation of paints with a VOC not<br>
exceeding 100 g/l.<br>
Optionally, the pigment concentrate comprises an additional resin, such as an<br>
acrylate resin or a urea-aldehyde resin. Suitable acrylic resins are for instance<br>
Setalux® 1385-51 available from Nuplex Resins. The mixing ratio between the<br>
additional resin and the polyester is preferably 0:1 - 4:1, more preferably 1:1 -<br>
3:1.<br>
The pigment concentrate according to the present invention can for example be<br>
prepared by grinding a pigment with a dispersant. The polyester is added during<br>

Compatibility evaluation of the resins of Examples 1 -15<br>
To test the compatibility of the compatibilizer resins of Examples 1-15 with a<br>
range of base paint binder systems, the following evaluation procedure was<br>
carried out.<br>
The evaluation was carried out with the following base resins: an acrylic polyol,<br>
an oxidatively drying alkyd based on tall oil fatty acid and pentaerythritol with an<br>
oil length of 64%, an acrylic polyamine, Synocure® 892 BA70 available from<br>
Cray Valley, and a polysiloxane (Dow Corning® 3074 Intermediate).<br>
The base resins and the compatibilizer resins were mixed in a mixing ratio of<br>
10:1. Approximately 0.25 g of the compatibilizer resin was weighed accurately<br><br><br>
into four glass vials. Into each vial approximately 2.5 g of the required base<br>
resin were then weighed accurately. Then into each vial approximately 2.75g of<br>
the solvent (1 -methoxy-2-propyl acetate) were weighed accurately. The<br>
samples were mixed until completely dissolved. In the case of the vial<br>
containing Dow Corning® 3074 Intermediate, 0.125 g of 3-aminopropyl<br>
triethoxysilane and 0.05 g of dibutyl tin dilaurate were added. Then films were<br>
applied for all samples using a 400 urn film applicator bar on a glass panel and<br>
stored at 25°C for 24 hours. The tests were repeated with a storage<br>
temperature of 10°C. The compatibility was evaluated visually and categorized<br>
as either OK (clear film), slightly cloudy or cloudy.<br>
In all cases, the films remained clear and no cloudiness was observed,<br>
indicating that the compatibilizer resins are fully compatible with the various<br>
binder resins.<br>
Compatibility evaluation of the resin of Example 18<br>
The compatibility of the compatibilizer resin of Example 18 was tested with the<br>
following resins: acrylic resins Setalux® 1385 and Setalux® 1161 available from<br>
Nuplex Resins, Setal® 164, a polyester polyol resin available from Nuplex<br>
Resins, and a blend of two cellulose acetate butyrate resins available from<br>
Eastman Chemical Company.<br>
Each resin, or resin blend in the case of the cellulose acetate butyrates, was<br>
mixed with the compatibilizer resin in a 100 ml glass bottle using a mixing ratio<br>
of 10:1. To 1 g of compatibilizer resin were added 10 g of the resin being tested.<br>
Then to each bottle 11 grams of 1-methoxy-2-propyl acetate solvent were<br>
added. The bottles were shaken vigorously until the resin sample had dissolved.<br>
The samples were initially judged in the bottle for any indication of<br>
incompatibility such as phase separation or haziness. After storage at 25°C for<br>
24 hours all the samples appeared homogenous and clear. The samples were<br><br><br>
then applied as a wet film using a 200-micron applicator bar on acetate sheets<br>
and stored at 25°C for 24 hours. The drawdowns were evaluated visually and<br>
categorized as either OK (clear film), slightly cloudy or cloudy. In all cases the<br>
resin films remained clear and no cloudiness was observed, which<br>
demonstrates that the compatibilizer resin is fully compatible with the tested<br>
resins.<br>
Viscosity<br>
A pigment concentrate was formulated comprising 25 wt.% of a blue pigment,<br>
Sunfast® Blue 15.2, 15 wt.% of a 30% solution of the polyester prepared in<br>
Example 7, 26 wt.% of a thermosetting acrylic resin, Setalux® 1385 BX51, 24<br>
wt.% of a dispersant, Disperbyk® 170, and 10 wt.% of butyl acetate solvent. The<br>
solid content was about 50 wt.%. The pigment to binder ratio was about 1.<br>
Zirconia beads (200 g) of diameter 1.25 - 1.6 mm were added to a glass bottle<br>
of volume 370 ml. Next, 125 g of the pigment paste premix were added to the<br>
bottle. A further 190 g of the zirconia beads were added. A screwtop lid was<br>
fitted and the bottle placed in a shaker. The bottle was shaken for 90 minutes in<br>
order to achieve a pigment paste Hegman grind of 
The paste viscosity was measured using a CAP2000 cone and plate viscometer<br>
at a shear rate of 75 rpm and 750 rpm, respectively. At a shear rate of 75 rpm,<br>
the paste had a viscosity of 2.0 - 2.5 cPs, while the 750 rpm viscosity was 1.5 -<br>
1.8 cPs. This means that although the pigment content was more than 30%<br>
higher than that of the prior art pastes, the viscosity was still lower.<br>
Determination of achievable VOC<br>
Pigment concentrates were prepared using the compatibilizer resins of<br>
Examples 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 14. A comparative test was carried out using<br>
Laropal® A81, available from BASF. In the pigment concentrates Solsperse®<br>
38500, available from Noveon Performance Coatings, was used as a<br><br>
dispersant. The evaluation was carried out with the following pigments- a<br>
titamum dioxide (Tioxide® TR92, available from Huntsman), yellow iron oxide<br>
(Bayferrox® Yellow 3920 of Bayer), carbon black (Special Black 100, available<br>
from Degussa), a blue copper (II) phthalocyanine pigment (Monastral® Blue<br>
CSN, available from Heubach), and a red pigment (Irgazin® Red 2030, available<br>
from Ciba Specialty Chemicals).<br>
The pigment concentrates were prepared by dissolving the compatibilizer resins<br>
in 1-methoxy-2-propyl acetate. The compatibilizer resin solution was then mixed<br>
with further solvent and the dispersant, Solsperse® 38500. Pigment was added<br>
under agitation at a temperature of 40°C. Glass beads of 1 mm diameter were<br>
added in a 1:1 weight ratio with respect to the total colorant weight. For the<br>
Bayferrox® Yellow 3920 colorant, a 1:1.4 weight ratio was used. The mixture<br>
was then mixed with a speed of 8,000 - 10,000 rpm and filtered using a 250 urn<br>
polyester mesh for separation from the grinding media. In all cases the product<br>
was a fluid, pourable pigment concentrate. Table 1 shows that a VOC of 250 g/l<br>
or less can be achieved. Table 2 shows the formulations of the pigment<br>
concentrates.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
