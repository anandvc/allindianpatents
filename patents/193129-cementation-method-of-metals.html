CEMENTATION METHOD OF METALS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1.<br>
 Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a cementation method of metals, and more particularly relates to a cementation method of metals, wherein hydrocarbon gas and oxidization gas are introduced into a heat treatment furnace in order to prevent a deposited carbide from being bulked, so that the treatment time is shortened to enhance the reproducibi1ity, and that the sooting is prevented to reduce the maintenance costs or the like.<br>

In the conventional cementation method, a converted gas obtained from the conversion furnace is used as a carrier gas. Recently, in order to enhance the quality, and to reduce the treatment time and running cost, such a method that the conversion furnace is not used, but a hydrocarbon gas and an oxidizing gas are introduced directly into the furnace to carry out the metamorphism and the cementation in the furnace has been proposed. Further, such a cementation method that the carbon potential in the furnace atmosphere is increased and decreased repeatedly to reduce the treatment time is described in Japanese Patent Laid Open Nos. 128577/1980 and 49621/1994, Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 21866/1987, 38870/ 1989 and<br><br>

51904/1994, for example.<br>
Fig. 5 is a graph showing the relation between<br>
a temperature curve a and a carbon potential curve<br>
b in an example of the conventional cementation method. In this method, a work inserted into a furnace for processing is heated to and maintained at a temperature of austenite region, such as 930°c in a cementation atmosphere. The work is cementated for a predetermined time at a carbon potential of about 0.8%, subjected to diffusion process at a carbon potential of about 0.7%, and then cooled to and hardened at 850°c .<br>
Fig. 6 shows a cementation method in the Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 49621/1994. In this method, during the cementation process the carbon potential is varied to about 1.1% and about 0.8%, alternatively so as to reduce the cementation time and to prevent the furnace from being sooted.<br>
The cementation time can be reduced, if the cementation is carried out in an atmosphere of higher carbon potential. However, in most cases, the work to be treated includes special chemical elements therein which deposit easily carbides. Accordingly, if the carbon potential of the atmosphere in the furnace is set to a high level carelessly, the deposited<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
carbide causing the fatigue strength of the work to be lowered is bulked, and the cementation time cannot be reduced.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <br>
An object of the present invention is to<br><br>
obviate the above defect of the conventional<br><br>
cementation method.	<br>
In a cementation method of metals of the present invention wherein hydrocarbon gas and oxidization gas are introduced into a heat treatment furnace, a small quantity of hydrocarbon gas of a low pressure is introduced into the heat treatment furnace in order to form an initial atmosphere. Further, in the present invention, a shift time and a gradient of a carbon potential varying toward different level are controlled by increasing or decreasing the quantities of hydrocarbon gas and oxidization gas.<br>
Further, in the present invention, a carbon potential of the atmosphere in the furnace is maintained for a predetermined time at such a high level as to prevent a carbide deposited in a work to be processed from being bulked when a cementation process is carried out, and wherein the carbone potential is maintained for a predetermined time<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
at a low level so as to carry out the solution treatment of the deposited carbide when the<br>
cementation process is carried out.	<br>
Further, in the present invention, oxidization<br>
gas of intermediate pressure is flushed into a gas<br>
supply pipe so as to prevent the gas supply pipe <br>
from being sooted.	<br>
Further, in the present invention, hydrocarbon gas of a low pressure and oxidization gas of an intermediate pressure are supplied into a conversion pipe in a preheating zone so as to prevent components of atmosphere in the furnace from being disturbed. The intermediate pressure is a pressure between a low pressure (not higher than 0.025 kg/cm2) and a high pressure (not less than 10 kg/cm2).<br>
Furthermore, In the present invention, CO2 of an intermediate pressure is injected into all gas supply pipes at the same time so as to remove a soot from each of said gas supply pipes and to prevent the lack of CO in the furnace.<br>
The foregoing and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following more particular description of a preferred embodiment of the invention, as illustrated in the accompanying<br><br>
- 6 -<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT In the present invention, wherein the batch furnace as shown in Fig. 3 is used, the entrance door 3 for the heating room 1 is opened, the rotation of the agitating fan 19 in the heating room 1 is stopped in order to prevent an outside air from being entered into the heating room 1, and a work such as steel etc. to be treated is inserted through the entrance door 3 into the heating room 1.<br>
Then, the entrance door 3 is closed, and<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
oxidization gas such as CO2 of an intermediate pressure is introduced Into the heating room 1 and at the same time the opening and closing port 3a is opened in order to purge to the outside air entered<br>
Into the heating room 1 when the work is introduced<br><br>
thereinto.	<br>
After that, a small quantity of hydrocarbon gas such as C4H10 of an intermediate pressure (0.025 kg/cm2 - 0.1 kg/cm2, preferably 0.07 kg/cm2) is introduced<br>
into the heating room 1 at a rate of 10 ~ 200 liters/<br>
minute, preferably 40 liters/minute, and the opening and closing port 3a is closed. Then, the agitating fan 19 is rotated, and the work is heated to about 9300C without adding any catalyst so as to carry out the cementation and diffusion processes.<br>
Next, the work is cooled at the hardening temperature of about 850°c . Then, the intermediate door 4 is opened, and the work is moved to the cooling room 2. Then, the work is lowered by an elevator (not shown) into the cooling oil tank 6 so as to carry out the hardening for about 15 minutes. After that, the work is lifted from the cooling oil tank 6 and remain for about 10 minutes in order to drop the oil from the work. Then, the outlet door 5 is opened, and the work<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
is taken out therefrom. When the intermediate door 4 is opened and the work is moved to the cooling room 2, air in the cooling room 2 is expanded due to the heat radiation from the heating room 1 and the heated work. When the intermediate door 4 is<br><br>
closed the, heat radiation to the cooling room 2<br>
from the heating room 1 is shutted off. Accordingly,<br>
when the work are dipped into the cooling oil in the cooling oil tank 6, the pressure in the cooling<br>
room 2 becomes negative. In order to prevent the <br>
pressure in the cooling room 2 from becoming negative,<br>
the valve 12 is opened and C02 of intermediate pressure is supplied through the gas supply pipe 10 to the cooling room 2.<br>
In case that the continuous furnace is used, a predetermined quantity of oxidization gas is introduced into the cementation and diffusion zones, and hydrocarbon gas is introduced into the preheating, cementation, diffusion and hardening zones.<br>
In the present invention, the quantity of hydrocarbon gas introduced into each of said zones is adjusted according to the values of O2 sensor, CO2 infrared analyzer, CP coil and dew point with respect to each of said zones so that a predetermined<br><br>
_ 9 _<br>
carbon potential (activity) can be obtained.<br>
As stated above, by the control of the gas quantity, not air quantity, the production of soot can be suppressed.<br>
That is as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the carbon potential is varied repeatedly from about 1.2% to about 0.8% and vice versa in the process of cementation and maintained at 1.2% or 0.8% for a predetermined time. The gradients of the curve b between the positions B-C and D-E, and values of the maintaining.<br>
times t1 , t2 , t3 ,	are set suitably so that the <br>
deposited carbide is not bulked, that the cementation time is reduced and that the production of soot in the furnace is prevented effectively.<br>
Table 1 shows an outer ring of SCM 420H (75 mm in outer diameter, 57 mm in inner diameter) processed by the cementation method of the present Invention shown in Fig. 1 for comparison. In this case, the temperature of the cementation and diffusion is set to 930°c , and the target of hardened thickness of effective layer is set between 1.45 mm to 1.90 mm (Hv 513).<br><br>
- 10 -<br><br>
As apparent from said Table 1, according to this embodiment of the present invention, it is possible to reduce the total processing time by<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
235 minutes in comparison with the conventional method shown in Fig. 5, and to reduce by 30 minutes in comparison with the method shown in the Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 49621/1994. If such a control state that the carbon potential of the atmosphere in the furnace is increased more than the solid solution limit of carbon at the austenite region temperature is continued, the deposited carbide in the work becomes bulked. Accordingly, in the present invention, the shift time and the gradient of the<br>
carbon potential varying toward a predetermined high level are controlled by increasing the quantity of cementation gas to be supplied to the furnace or by decreasing the quantity of oxidization gas to be supplied to the furnace, and after the carbon potential is reached to the high level the carbon potential is maintained for a predetermined time of period so as to prevent the carbide deposited in the work from being bulked. After that, the carbon potential of the atmosphere in the furnace is lowered to a predetermined low level in order to carry out the solution treatment of the deposited carbide into the austenite. At this stage, the cementation time becomes excess if the carbon potential is lowered to a value lower than a<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
required value carelessly. Accordingly, in the present invention, the shift time and the gradient of the carbon potential varying toward a predetermined low level are control led by decreasing the quantity of cementation gas to be supplied to the furnace or by increasing the quantity of oxidization gas to be supplied to the furnace. After the carbon potential is reached to the low value the carbon potential is maintained for a predetermined time of period. These steps are repeated, and diffusion is carried out for a suitable time of period as like as the conventional manner so that the surface carbon density is adjusted. The shift time and the gradient of the carbon potential as well as the time during which the carbon potential is maintained at the high level or the low level may be varied suitably with time, because the diffusion of carbon in the work is reduced with time.<br>
In order to prevent the gas supply pipe from being choked with the soot of the hydrocarbon, oxidization gas of intermediate pressure is flushed timely into said gas supply pipe at a rate of 2-10 kg/cm2, preferably 5 kg/cm2.<br>
Further, in order to prevent the components<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
of the atmosphere in the furnace from being varied due to the change in furnace pressure when the door is opened or closed, hydrocarbon gas of an intermediate pressure (0.025 kg/cm2 ~ 0.1 kg/cm2, preferably 0.07 kg/cm2) and oxidization gas of an intermediate pressure (2 - 10 kg/cm2, preferably 5 kg/cm2) are added by a super charger in the conversion pipe in the preheating zone.<br>
Furthermore, in the present invention, CO2 of intermediate pressure is supplied into each gas supply pipe at the same time in order to remove the soot in each of the gas supply pipes, on the contrary to the conventional method wherein CO2 is supplied in order into each gas supply pipe in each cycle.<br>
According to the present invention, such a problem as to lack of CO to be introduced into the furnace can be solved and the time for the cementation can be reduced remarkably.<br>
As stated above, according to the present invention, the processing time of the cementation of metals can be reduced, and the cementation method of metals is carried out economically.<br>
While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to the preferred<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.<br><br><br>
