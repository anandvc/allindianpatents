				<td>SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR DETERMINING STATOR WINDING<br>
RESISTANCE IN AN AC MOTOR<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001] The present application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application serial<br>
number 60/932,743, filed June 4, 2007, and which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
GOVERNMENT LICENSE RIGHTS<br>
[0002] The present invention was made at least in pan with Government support<br>
under Contract No. DE-FC36-04GO14000, awarded by the United States Department of<br>
Energy. The Government may have certain rights in the invention.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] The present invention relates generally to alternating current (AC) motors and,<br>
more particularly, to a system and method for determining stator winding resistance for<br>
thermal protection of AC motors.<br>
[0004] Thermal protection is an important aspect in the monitoring of motor<br>
conditions, as motor failures can often be related to the stator winding insulation. It is<br>
commonly assumed that the motor's life is reduced by 50% for every 10° C increase in<br>
temperature above an acceptable stator winding temperature limit. Therefore, accurate<br>
monitoring of the stator winding temperature is beneficial for motor protection purposes.<br>
[0005] Various methods and mechanisms for determining the stator winding<br>
temperature are currently employed. Aside from the direct stator winding temperature<br>
measurement, thermal model-based and motor parameter-based temperature estimation<br>
methods are two major techniques for thermal protection. The thermal model-based<br>
methods estimate the stator winding temperature using motor thermal models. However,<br>
due to the thermal parameter variation and the difficulty of thermal parameter<br>
identification, the accuracy of these methods can fall outside acceptable ranges. Besides,<br>
due to the change of cooling conditions, the thermal parameters are not constant, and may<br>
need to be identified for each motor under each specific cooling condition.<br>
[0006] The AC motor parameter-based approaches to determining stator winding<br>
temperature are developed to estimate the average winding temperatures from the stator<br>
winding resistances. Stator winding resistance (Rs) estimation is broadly used not only in<br>
thermal protection, but also in motor controls, fault diagnosis, and efficiency evaluation.<br>
Over the years, various Rs estimation methods have been proposed for different purposes.<br>
Generally, they are divided into three major categories: direct measurement methods,<br>
equivalent circuit-based methods, and signal-injection-based methods. Direct methods,<br>
such as the IEEE standard-118, give the most accurate Rs estimates, but have limitations<br>
and drawbacks due to the fact that resistance is only measured at a certain temperature<br>
and the resistance variations due to temperature changes are not considered. A further<br>
drawback of direct measurement methods is that the motor has to be disconnected from<br>
service to perform the required tests.<br>
[0007] The equivalent circuit-based methods of Rs estimation use the motor current<br>
and voltage to calculate the stator resistance based on an AC motor equivalent circuit<br>
(i.e., a model of the AC motor). Such model-based methods are non-intrusive and can<br>
respond to changes in the cooling conditions but are generally too sensitive to motor<br>
parameter variations to provide useful results for temperature estimation. That is, the<br>
estimation error of model-based methods can be about 20%, which is too high for use in<br>
temperature estimation.<br>
[0008] The signal injection-based methods for determining stator resistance inject a<br>
DC bias into the stator supply voltage and use the DC component of the voltage and<br>
current to calculate the stator resistance. In one DC injection method, a resistor in<br>
parallel with a transistor is installed in one phase of the motor, which leads to an<br>
equivalent resistance in the induction motor that is different when input current is<br>
positive and negative, thus producing a DC component. Although this approach can be<br>
accurate and robust to the variations in cooling conditions and motor parameters, it<br>
suffers from its intrusive nature, as an extra DC injection circuit needs to be installed in<br>
series with one of the motor leads. Additionally, due to the current limits of<br>
semiconductor devices, previous signal injection-based methods cannot generally be<br>
directly applied to motors beyond 100 hp.<br>
[0009] It would therefore be desirable to design an accurate, non-intrusive method for<br>
determining stator winding resistance, without adding further resistance to the induction<br>
motor.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0010] The present invention provides a system and method for remote and sensoriess<br>
stator winding resistance estimation for thermal protection of induction motors. The<br>
switching time of a switch in a motor control device is modified to generate a DC<br>
component in an output of the motor control device. This DC component is analyzed to<br>
determine a stator winding resistance, and a temperature of the stator windings is<br>
determined based on the stator winding resistance.<br>
[0011] In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a motor control device to<br>
determine resistance of a stator winding of an AC motor includes a circuit having an<br>
input connectable to an AC source and an output connectable to an input terminal of an<br>
AC motor. The circuit further includes at least one contactor and at least one switch to<br>
control current flow and terminal voltages in the AC motor. The motor control device<br>
also includes a controller connected to the circuit and configured to modify switching<br>
time of the at least one switch to create a DC component in an output of the motor control<br>
device corresponding to an input to the AC motor and determine a stator winding<br>
resistance of the AC motor based on the injected DC component of the voltage and<br>
current.<br>
[0012] In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a method for determining<br>
resistance of a stator winding of an AC motor without added sensors includes the step of<br>
providing a soft-starter in series between an AC power source and the AC motor, the soft-<br>
starter comprising at least one contactor and at least one solid-state switch to condition<br>
voltage and current to the AC motor. The method also includes the step of selectively<br>
operating the soft-starter in a bypass mode and a DC injection mode, wherein the bypass<br>
mode bypasses the DC injection mode for normal operation and wherein operating the<br>
soft-starter in the DC injection mode comprises opening a contactor for one phase and<br>
transmitting a gate drive signal having a delay angle therein to the at least one solid-state<br>
switch for the one phase, thereby introducing a DC bias into a phase of the AC motor<br>
Operating the soft-starter in the DC injection mode also includes measuring the DC bias<br>
in the voltage and current provided to the AC motor and determining the resistance of the<br>
stator winding based on the measured DC bias.<br>
[0013] In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, a soft-starter to control<br>
transmission of voltage and current from an AC power source to an induction motor<br>
having a stator winding includes a plurality of supply lines, with each supply line<br>
corresponding to a phase in the induction motor. The soft-starter also includes at least<br>
one solid-state switch on at least one of the plurality of supply lines to condition a motor<br>
line voltage and phase current to the induction motor and a processor programmed to<br>
delay gating of the at least one solid-state switch on one supply line to cause a DC<br>
component therein and determine the resistance of the stator winding based on the DC<br>
component.<br>
[0014] Various other features and advantages of the present invention will be made<br>
apparent from the following detailed description and the drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[002l] The embodiments of the invention set forth herein relate to a system and<br>
method for remote and sensorless stator winding resistance estimation for thermal<br>
protection of alternating current (AC) motors. The switching time of a switch in one<br>
phase in a motor control device is modified to generate a DC component that is<br>
measurable in each phase of the AC motor. This DC component is analyzed to determine<br>
a stator winding resistance, and a temperature of the stator windings is determined based<br>
on the stator winding resistance. While described below with respect to a three-phase, AC<br>
motor having windings connected in a wye-arrangement, it is also recognized that<br>
embodiments of the invention also include single-phase and other multi-phase motors<br>
having winding arrangements in various patterns (e.g., delta arrangement). The<br>
switching time of a switch in each of these various types of AC motors can be modified<br>
to inject a DC component into each phase of the motor.<br>
[0021] Referring to FIG. 1, a three-phase, AC motor is shown according to an<br>
embodiment of the invention, and is generally designated by the reference numeral 10.<br>
As is conventional, AC motor 10 is represented as three windings 12a-12c connected in a<br>
wye-arrangement, although it can be appreciated that AC motor may be connected in a<br>
delta arrangement without deviating from the scope of the invention. Stator windings<br>
12a-12c of AC motor 10 are operatively connected to an AC source 16 through<br>
corresponding supply lines 18, 20 and 22, respectively, at motor terminals 24, 26 and 28,<br>
respectively.<br>
[0023] As shown in FIG. 1, a motor control device 30 is connected between AC<br>
source 16 and AC motor 10. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, motor<br>
control device 30 comprises a soft-starter configured to limit the transient voltages and<br>
current to AC motor 10 during start-up, resulting in a "soft" motor start starting current<br>
that avoids inrush currents. The basic structure of soft-starter 30 is shown in FIG. 1 (i.e.,<br>
circuitry of the soft-starter) as including a plurality of contactors 32 therein, with a<br>
contactor corresponding to each supply line 18, 20, 22 or each phase of the supply power.<br>
Soft-starter also includes multiple pairs of anti-parallel switches 34, such as solid-state<br>
switches in the form of thyristors, to control the current flow and, in turn, the terminal<br>
voltages of the motor. That is, a pair of thyristors 34 is connected in parallel for each<br>
supply line 18, 20, 22 or each phase of the supply power, with the thyristors 34 in each<br>
pair having an opposite polarity. While shown as including a pair of thyristors 34 on<br>
each supply line 18, 20, 22, it is also envisioned that soft-starter could have a pair of<br>
thyristors on only one or two supply lines (e.g., only supply line 18). Additionally, it is<br>
also recognized that, for a specified supply line, a thyristor could be arranged in parallel<br>
with a diode rather than another thyristor. In any of the embodiments described above, a<br>
thyristor 34 on a single supply line can be controlled to distort the input voltage and<br>
current received by AC motor 10, as described in detail below.<br>
Also included in soft-starter 30 is a controller or processor 36 configured to<br>
control operation of thyristors 34 via the transmission of gate drive signals thereto, as<br>
well as control opening and closing of contactors 30. During start-up of AC motor 10,<br>
soft-starter 30 operates in a "start-up" mode, during which controller 36 causes one or<br>
more of contactors 32 corresponding to supply lines 18, 20, 22 to open such that power<br>
from AC source 16 passes through thyristors 34, thus controlling the current flow (and<br>
therefore the voltage) applied to the AC motor 10. Upon start-up of AC motor 10, the<br>
soft-starter enters a bypass mode in which controller 36 causes contactor 30 on each<br>
supply line 18, 20, 22 to close, so as to minimize power dissipation. The bypass mode<br>
thus is considered the "normal" mode of operation for the soft-starter 30 and for AC<br>
motor 10.<br>
[0025] According to an embodiment of the invention, controller 36 is further<br>
programmed to operate soft-starter 30 in a gate drive control mode (i.e., a "DC injection<br>
mode") to inject a DC bias or components into the motor line voltages and phase<br>
currents, as shown in FIG. 2. During the DC injection mode, controller 36 operates to<br>
open a contactor 32 on one of the supply lines corresponding to only one phase (e.g.,<br>
"phase a"), while the other two contactors 32 still work normally as in bypass mode and<br>
remain closed. Controller 36 also operates in an asymmetrical fashion to introduce a<br>
delay (i.e., a delay angle) to the gate drive signal sent to thyristors 34 corresponding to<br>
the open contactor of the phase a supply line 18, to modify a switching time thereof. In<br>
one embodiment, controller 36 operates to introduce a short delay to the gate drive signal<br>
of only one conducting thyristor 34 of phase a (VG, or VG2) after the phase a current's<br>
rising or falling zero-crossing. The conducting thyristor 34 that receives the delay signal<br>
from controller can be either the forward conducting or backward conducting thyristor.<br>
In another embodiment, both the forward conducting and backward conducting thyristors<br>
34 receive a delayed gate drive signal from controller 36, with the length of the delay<br>
(i.e., amplitude of the delay angle) of the signal differing for the forward conducting<br>
thyristor and the backward conducting thyristor. An example of the waveforms of the<br>
motor line voltage 38 (vab) and phase current (/a) 40 when a delay angle 42 of a (e.g., a 
30°) is added to the gate drive signal is shown in FIG. 3.<br>
[0026] Referring again to FIG. 2, based on the introduction of the delay into the gate<br>
drive signal of the selected conducting thyristor(s) 34, a disturbance or distortion (i.e., a<br>
shift in the phase current and a notch in the line voltage) of at least one of the phases of<br>
the AC motor is caused, which generates or injects a DC component into the motor line<br>
voltages and phase currents. These DC components can be measured and determined for<br>
each DC injection mode period by voltage and current sensors 44 included in soft-starter<br>
30. Because the DC components in the input voltages and currents do not "pass through"<br>
the air-gap of the AC motor (i.e., the rotor/stator air-gap), they have no impact on the<br>
rotor circuit of the AC motor 10. Therefore, an equivalent DC model of the AC motor<br>
with soft-starter 30 can be illustrated as in FIG. 4.<br>
[0027] The stator resistance Rs can be estimated from the terminal voltages and<br>
currents at the AC motor 10. The amplitude of the DC component from a line-to-line<br>
voltage and a phase current resulting from the disturbance/distortion therein caused by<br>
the delay of the gate drive signal, allowing for the estimation of the stator resistance Rs<br>
as:<br><br>
where vab and ia are the DC components of the motor line voltage vab and phase<br>
current /a , respectively, and k is a constant that is determined by the AC motor<br>
configuration. That is, for a three-phase AC motor having windings in a wye-<br>
arrangement, £=2/3. However, for a single phase or multi-phase motor, or for windings in<br>
an alternative arrangement, k would have a different value. Additionally, while Eqn. 1<br>
shows that the phase current is measured for phase a, and that line-to-line voltage is<br>
measured between phases a and b, it is also envisioned that the phase current could be<br>
measured for a different phase and that the line-to-line voltage could be measured<br>
between phase a and a different phase. That is, the DC components of the motor line<br>
voltage and phase current are present in all phases of the AC motor. The current phases<br>
can thus be measured for the phase in which the delay signal was added (phase a) or<br>
another phase, and the line-to-line voltage can be measured between phase a and any<br>
other phase. For a single phase motor, it is noted that line-to-line voltage would be<br>
measured between the single phase line and a neutral line.<br>
[0028] Based on the estimated Rs from DC signal injection, the stator winding<br>
temperature Ts can be monitored. The Rs variation is linearly proportional to the Ts<br>
variation, as:<br><br>
where Tsq and R&amp; represents Ts and Rs at room temperature; fs and Rs are the estimated<br>
Ts and Rs from DC injection; and u, is the temperature coefficient of resistivity.<br>
[0029] In determining the stator resistance Rs from Eqn. 1 from the DC components<br>
vj; and if , the motor line voltage vab and phase current /a are analyzed. For a small<br>
delay angle a (i.e., a 
only includes the DC component and a supply fundamental frequency (coe) component,<br>
as:<br><br>
[0030] Similarly, the phase current ia can be approximately denoted as:<br><br>
where are the DC component and the line frequency component of /a,<br>
respectively.<br>
Therefore, the DC component in ia can be approximately derived as:<br><br>
where is the peak value of the line frequency component in /a. The injected DC<br>
voltage can be approximately derived as:<br><br>
Having determined the DC components of the voltage and current, vgb and ia , the<br>
stator resistance Rs can be estimated according to Eqn. 1 and, accordingly, the stator<br>
winding temperature Ts can then be monitored based on the determined Rs according to<br>
Eqn. 2 in real-time while the AC motor is in operation. In one embodiment of the<br>
invention, controller 36 (FIGS. 1 and 2) is configured to generate an alert (e.g., audible or<br>
visual alert) if the stator winding temperature exceeds a pre-determined threshold value.<br>
This alert allows an operator to take a desired action, such as shutting down the AC<br>
motor 10.<br>
t€tl35j To obtain a more accurate Rs estimate, it is desired that larger delay angles a be<br>
introduced to increase the percentage of DC components in the motor voltages and<br>
currents. However, it is recognized that injection of the DC component causes torque<br>
pulsations in the AC motor 10. Therefore, according to an embodiment of the invention,<br>
controller 36 (FKjS. I and 2) is programmed to inject maximal DC components into the<br>
voltage and current by introducing a maximal delay angle a in the thyristor gate drive<br>
signal, while keeping the resulting torque pulsations under a preset tolerance range.<br>
To determine an acceptable delay angle a, the torque pulsations in the AC<br>
motor are analyzed. That is, the dominant components in the torque pulsations and their<br>
correlations to the injected DC components are analyzed using sequence analysis theory<br>
in a d-q reference frame. These torque pulsations are decomposed into components at<br>
multiples of the fundamental frequency, each of which can be separately monitored by<br>
observing the sequence components of the motor currents. Thus, the stator voltage, stator<br>
current, and total flux linkage are described as space vectors in the d-q stationary<br>
reference frame, and are defined as <br><br>
where p is the number of poles in the AC motor. In Eqn. 7, the flux linkage vector<br>
Xd can be estimated based on the stator voltage and current vectors as:<br><br>
[0035] The flux and current space vectors can be decomposed into vectors at multiples<br>
of the fundamental frequency, as:<br><br>
where the superscript of each decomposed vector indicates its rotating direction and<br>
angular speed (frequency) in the vector space. Tt is noted that, as the DC current and<br>
voltage have no effect on the flux, there is no DC component in <br>
The correlation of each component in the injected signals to the torque<br>
pulsation can be evaluated separately based on this decomposition analysis. The<br>
frequency of the torque variation caused by flux linkage vector and current vector<br>
 Therefore, the air-gap torque determined in Eqn. 7 can be extended as:<br><br>
where T\dc and T®' represent the DC component and the fundamental frequency<br>
components at supply frequency coe in the air-gap torque, and ^T is the remaining high<br>
frequency torque components. Neglecting high-order harmonics in the flux linkage and<br>
stator current, the DC component and the coe component in the air-gap torque can be<br>
respectively denoted as:<br><br>
\JMBT\~ The DC component in the air-gap torque is induced by the fundamental<br>
frequency component in the phase current as in bypass mode, while the fundamental<br>
frequency component in the air-gap torque T^ is the torque distortion caused by the<br>
injected DC current It is noted that the negative sequence current caused by the DC<br>
injection is negligible compared to the injected DC component, and therefore, the major<br>
harmonic in the air-gap torque is the fundamental frequency component T£ caused by<br>
the injected DC current.<br>
[003^1 The percentage torque pulsation can thus be simply derived using Eqns. 5 and<br>
11 as:<br><br>
where cos(cp) is the power factor. From this, the percentage torque pulsation caused by<br>
the injected DC signal can be controlled within an acceptable range by controlling the<br>
delay angle a. During operation of soft starter 30 in DC injection mode, the delay angle<br>
is adjusted by monitoring the DC and negative sequence components of the stator current,<br>
and as a result, the torque pulsations are maintained within a preset tolerance range.<br>
While torque pulsation is under the tolerance range, the delay angle can be gradually<br>
increased until the optimal delay angle is reached. In one example, the delay angle is<br>
controlled to be between 10° and 25° so that the torque pulsation caused by the injected<br>
DC signal is within the preset tolerance range.<br>
[0039| Since DC injection causes torque pulsation and extra power dissipation in the<br>
soft-starter and the motor, it is not necessary to inject the dc signal and estimate Rs and Ts<br>
continuously, given a typical motor thermal time constant. The soft-starter 30 can thus be<br>
periodically operated in DC injection mode at a pre-defined repetition rate and operated<br>
in bypass mode for the remainder of motor operation. Soft-starter 30 is operated in DC<br>
injection mode for a minimal time interval that is sufficient to obtain an accurate estimate<br>
of Rs, while small enough not to cause unacceptable torque pulsation and additional<br>
power dissipation.<br>
[0040] Given a typical motor thermal time constant, operation of soft-starter 30 in DC<br>
injection mode at a periodic rate of once every 5-10 minutes is normally sufficient for<br>
thermal protection purposes, depending on the requirements of practical application.<br>
However, it is recognized that the soft-starter can be operated in DC injection mode more<br>
or less frequently (i.e., greater/lesser periodic rate) based on parameters of the motor and<br>
the operation of the motor by a user. As stated above, each operation of soft-starter 30 in<br>
DC injection mode lasts for a minimal time interval sufficient to obtain an accurate<br>
estimate of Rs. Such a time interval can be, for example, for 0.5 seconds and can be<br>
repeated every 5-10 min, although longer or shorter DC injection mode intervals are also<br>
envisioned. A large enough number of samples of the DC components are measured and<br>
determined in the time interval to allow for an accurate estimate of Rs. After this time<br>
interval of DC injection mode operation, controller 36 in soft-starter 30 (FIGS. 1 and 2)<br>
functions to close all contactors 32 to return the soft-starter to normal bypass operation.<br>
It is recognized that, in determining stator resistance from the injected DC<br>
components, other factors/variables may be considered. For example, since vacb and iac<br>
are obtained from the mean of vab and za during DC injection mode, the DC offsets in the<br>
voltage and current measurements influence the accuracy of the Rs estimate. Therefore,<br>
the DC offsets of the measurements can be compensated. According to one embodiment<br>
of the invention, and assuming that the DC component in the supply voltage can be<br>
neglected, the offsets can be calculated by the mean of vab and /a for an integer number of<br>
cycles in the bypass mode before each DC injection mode period, when there is no<br>
injected DC signal. For example, the mean of the vab and /„ measurements for 15 cycles<br>
in the bypass mode before each DC injection mode can be calculated as measurement<br>
offsets. After compensation for the measurement offsets, the equation for Rs calculation<br>
is modified from Eqn. 1 to:<br><br>
Similar to Eqn. 1, for a three-phase AC motor having windings in a wye-arrangement, the<br>
constant k=2/3.<br>
[0042] In another embodiment of the invention, if soft-starter 30 is installed in a motor<br>
control center (not shown) and the motor terminals 24, 26 and 28 (FIG. 1) arc not<br>
accessible, the resistance of a cable connecting the AC motor 10 to soft-starter 30 is<br>
considered. That is, as the resistance of the cable may not be negligible compared to Rs,<br>
the Rs estimate set forth in Eqn. 1 becomes:<br><br>
where again, for example, &amp;=2/3 for a three-phase AC motor having windings in a wye-<br>
arrangement.<br>
To obtain accurate Rs estimates, the cable resistance must be compensated by<br>
measurement or estimation of Rcab\e. When measuring Rcable is not possible, given the<br>
cable number in the American Wire Gauge (AWG) standard, Rcab\e can be estimated<br>
based on the resistivity p given by the AWG standard, the approximate length / of the<br>
cable and the ambient temperature TA as:<br><br>
where u is the temperature coefficient of resistivity and To is the room temperature,<br>
assuming that the cable temperature is the same as ambient temperature.<br>
[0j944f It is noted that the system and method set forth above for injecting a DC<br>
component into an AC motor power supply enables online Rs estimation using only the<br>
motor terminal voltages and currents, without the need of any other sensors, such as<br>
speed and torque transducers. Such an arrangement allows for a nonintrusive, sensorless,<br>
and low-cost technique for determining stator winding resistance in real-time while the<br>
AC motor is in operation.<br>
[0045] A technical contribution for the disclosed method and apparatus is that it<br>
provides for a computer implemented technique for determining stator winding resistance<br>
for thermal protection of AC motors. The technique controls switching time of a switch<br>
in a motor control device to generate a DC component in an output of the motor control<br>
device corresponding to an input to the AC motor and determines a stator winding<br>
resistance from the DC component. A temperature of the stator windings can also be<br>
determined in the technique based on the stator winding resistance.<br>
[0046] Therefore, according to one embodiment of the present invention, a motor<br>
control device to determine resistance of a stator winding of an AC motor includes a<br>
circuit having an input connectable to an AC source and an output connectable to an<br>
input terminal of an AC motor. The circuit further includes at least one contactor and at<br>
least one switch to control current flow and terminal voltages in the AC motor. The<br>
motor control device also includes a controller connected to the circuit and configured to<br>
modify switching time of the at least one switch to create a DC component in an output<br>
of the motor control device corresponding to an input to the AC motor and determine a<br>
stator winding resistance of the AC motor based on the injected DC component of the<br>
voltage and current.<br>
[0047] According to another embodiment of present invention, a method for<br>
determining resistance of a stator winding of an AC motor without added sensors<br>
includes the step of providing a soft-starter in series between an AC power source and the<br>
AC motor, the soft-starter comprising at least one contactor and at least one solid-state<br>
switch to condition voltage and current to the AC motor. The method also includes the<br>
step of selectively operating the soft-starter in a bypass mode and a DC injection mode,<br>
wherein the bypass mode bypasses the DC injection mode for normal operation and<br>
wherein operating the soft-starter in the DC injection mode comprises opening a<br>
contactor for one phase and transmitting a gate drive signal having a delay angle therein<br>
to the at least one solid-state switch for the one phase, thereby introducing a DC bias into<br>
a phase of the AC motor Operating the soft-starter in the DC injection mode also includes<br>
measuring the DC bias in the voltage and current provided to the AC motor and<br>
determining the resistance of the stator winding based on the measured DC bias.<br>
[QQ48\ According to yet another embodiment of the present invention, a soft-starter to<br>
control transmission of voltage and current from an AC power source to an induction<br>
motor having a stator winding includes a plurality of supply lines, with each supply line<br>
corresponding to a phase in the induction motor. The soft-starter also includes at least<br>
one solid-state switch on at least one of the plurality of supply lines to condition a motor<br>
line voltage and phase current to the induction motor and a processor programmed to<br>
delay gating of the at least one solid-state switch on one supply line to cause a DC<br>
component therein and determine the resistance of the stator winding based on the DC<br>
component.<br>
[0049] The present invention has been described in terms of the preferred<br>
embodiment, and it is recognized that equivalents, alternatives, and modifications, aside<br>
from those expressly stated, are possible and within the scope of the appending claims.<br>
