				<td>INTRODUCTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of 5-bromo-l-(4"-flurophenyl)-l,3-dihydro-isobenzofuran of formula-I and l-(4^-fluorophenyl)-l,3-dihydro-isobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile of formula-II. The present invention particularly relates to an improved procesgfor the preparation of 4-bromo-(2-hydroxymethyl) phenyl-(4"-fluorophenyl)methanol of formula-VIII.<br><br>
The process for the preparation of antidepressant citalopram and its pharmaceutical properties were first disclosed in DE Patent no. 2,657,013 (1977) corresponding to US Patent no. 4,136,193 (1979). Subsequently it was also disclosed in GB patent no.l, 526,331(1978).<br>
The basic process for the preparation of citalopram described in the above-referred patents involves two major routes illustrated in Scheme-1 and Scheme-2. Major difference in these two routes is introduction of dimethylaminopropyl side chain at an early stage (Scheme-1) or at a later stage (Scheme-2).<br><br>
In the first route, 5-bromophthalide of the formula-IV is reacted with p-fluorophenyl-magnesium bromide to get a benzophenone derivative of the formula-V. This benzophenone derivative is reacted with 3-N,N-dimethyiaminopropylmagnesium chloride to get the dihydroxy intermediate of the formula-VI. Cyclization this with an acid catalyst resulted in the formation of phthalane derivative of the formula-VII. This bromophthalane derivative is reacted with copper cyanide to get the citalopram base of the formula-Ill.<br><br>
In the second route, 5-bromophthalide of the formula-IV is reacted with p-fluorophenyl-magnesium bromide to get the corresponding benzophenone derivative of the formula-V. This compound is reduced with lithium aluminum hydride to get the dihydroxy compound of the formula-VIII, which is cyclized with an acid catalyst to get the<br><br>
phthalane derivative of the formula-1. The bromo group is replaced with a cyano group and alkylated with the required side chain to get the citalopram base.<br><br>
Bogeso (EP no. 171, 943, corresponding to US patent no.4, 650,884) has indicated that the methods described in the above patents for the preparation of citalopram possess some problems in the scale-up to commercial production.<br>
In an attempt to develop a shorter route for the preparation of citalopram and to avoid the risk involved in the metalation step used previously, Bogeso started with 5-cyanophthalide of the formula-IX and surprisingly found that cyano group survived the cyclization step where 70% sulfuric acid was used at 80°C temperature (Scheme-3).<br><br><br>
Further processes have been disclosed in international patent application nos. WO<br>
98/019511, WO 98/019512, WO 98/019513, WO 99/030548, WO 00/011926, WO<br>
00/013648, and WO 00/023431.   International patent appUcation no. WO 98/019511<br>
discloses a process for the manufacture of Citalopram wherein a compound of the<br>
formula-X was reduced with sodium borohydride to get a compound of the formula-XII,	i<br>
However, yield is only 40% and large quantity (-50 times) of alcohol was used. This<br>
compound of the formula-XII is subjected to ring closure and the resuhing 5-substituted<br>
dihydroisobenzofliran derivative is converted to the corresponding 5-cyano derivative<br>
and alkylated with (3-dimethylamino) propyl halogenide to obtain citalopram.<br><br>
WO 98/019512 and WO 98/019513 relate to methods wherein a 5-amino-, 5-carboxy-, or 5-(sec-aminocarbonyl)phthalide is subjected to two successive Grignard reactions, ring closure and conversion of the resuhing 1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran derivative to the corresponding 5-cyano compound, i.e. citalopram.<br><br>
«<br>
International patent application no WO 99/030548 discloses a process for the preparation<br>
of citalopram wherein cyano group was introduced from the corresponding 5-aldehyde<br>
analogue of citalopram.	t<br>
International patent application nos. WO 00/011926 and WO 00/013648 disclose an improved process for the preparation of citalopram wherein 5-halogen (CI or Br) analogue of citalopram is activated by using palladium or nickel complex catalyst to introduce the corresponding cyano group present in citalopram.<br>
International patent application no WO 00/023431 discloses a process for introduction of cyano group present in citalopram via the corresponding 5-oxazolyl analogue of citalopram.<br>
A major drawback in the scale up to commercial production of citalopram by following the original patent process (disclosed in US patent no.4, 136,193) is removal of impurities present in citalopram to an acceptable level of pharmaceutical quality. Methods followed to improve the quality of citalopram are either by chemical purification (via acid addition salt where ever applicable) or by high vacuum distillation. Chemical method does not seem to remove the impurities up to the acceptable level because some of the impurities like compound of formula-VI, formula-VII or formula-XIII have similar salt formation properties with an acid.<br><br>
All the intermediates involved in the original patent for the preparation of citalopram have very high boiling point (~200°C at 
 <br>
Second route of the original patent for the preparation of citalopram involves purification of intermediate compounds of the formulae-I and II by high vacuum distillation (180-200°C at 
Third and simplified route (disclosed in EP Patent no. 171,943) for the preparation of citalopram involves the introduction of 5-cyano group present in citalopram at the beginning itself This route also has major drawback of removal of impurities present in citalopram. Repeated re-crystallization technique was described in making pharmaceutically acceptable quality citalopram. Also, there is a considerable loss if required product (citalopram) in this technique.<br>
All other international patents published between 1998 and 2000 are involving with various methods to introduce 5-cyano group from different functional groups. All these methods are focusing on new chemistry and are not adaptable for commercial production.<br>
Citalopram has become a well-known antidepressant drug that has now been on the market and has shown great promise as a valuable antidepressant drug with few side effects. Keeping in view of the difficulties in commercialization of the above-mentioned processes for the preparation of citalopram, we aimed to develop a simple and economical process for commercial production of citalopram.<br>
We observed that a promising approach for such a process is to (a) improve the quality of one or more of the isolable intermediates by simple techniques (b) avoid costly and risky reagents like lithium aluminum hydride and (c) minimize the effluents like large quantity of phosphoric acid.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been developed based on our finding that if the 3-(dimethylamino)-propyl side chain present in citalopram is introduced at an early stage, it is difficult to remove the related impurities by conventional methods. Further if a simple crystallization technique for the formation of one or more of the isolable intermediates, it becomes easy to get citalopram with acceptable pharmaceutical quality.<br>
Accordingly the main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of the intermediates of the formula-VIII, which is useful for the preparation of citalopram of the formula-Ill.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of the intermediate of the formula-I usefiil for the preparation of citalopram of the formula-Ill, which is simple, economical and environmentally safe.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of intermediates of the formula-I, which is useful for the preparation of<br><br>
citalopram avoiding the introduction of 3-(dimethylamino) propyl side chain present in citalopram at an early stage.<br>
Further objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of intermediate of the formula-I, which is useful for the preparation of citalopram by replacing the costly and hazardous lithium aluminum hydride with simple sodium borohydride and with no involvement of additional steps.<br><br><br><br>
(ii)       Reducing the benzophenone derivative of formula-V with sodium borohydride in the presence of a protic solvent to get the compound of formula-VIII.<br>
The temperature of the Grignard reaction may be in the range of-25°C to 0°C and the solvent may be tetrahydrofliran.<br>
The reduction may be effected at a temperature in the range of-25°C to 25°C preferably at a temperature in the range of-10°C to 0°C. The protic solvent used in step (i) may be selected from methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, n-butanol, t-butanol, and the like.<br>
This simplification has led to the synthesis of the crucial intermediates of the formulae-I&amp;II from the compound of the formula-IV in a very simple and easy to adopt manner suitable for any commercial scale.<br>
In our co-pending and main application no 157/MAS/Ol we have described and claimed an   improved   process   for  the   preparation   of  compound   of  formula   III,   l-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4"-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-isobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile (citalopram) based on the present invention.<br>
