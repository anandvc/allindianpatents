Novel insulin derivatives having a rapid onset of action<br>
The present invention relates to insulin derivatives which, in comparison to human insulin, have an accelerated onset of action, to a process for their preparation and to their use, in particular in pharmaceutical preparations for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.<br>
Approximately 120 million people worldwide suffer from diabetes mellitus. Among these are approximately 12 million type I diabetics, for whom the administration of insulin is the only therapy possible at present. The affected people are assigned insulin injections, as a rule several times daily, for life. Although type II diabetes, from which approximately 100 million people suffer, Is not fundamentally accompanied by an insulin deficiency, in a large number of cases, however, treatment with insulin is regarded as the most favorable or only possible form of therapy.<br>
With increasing length of the disease, a large number of the patients suffer from so-called diabetic late complications. These are essentially micro-and macrovascular damage, which depending on the type and extent, result in kidney failure, blindness, loss of extremities or an increased risk of heart/circulation disorders.<br>
As a cause, chronically increased blood glucose levels are primarily held responsible, since even with careful adjustment of the insulin therapy a normal blood glucose profile, such as would correspond to physiological regulation, is not achieved (Ward, J, D, (1989) British Medical Bulletin 45, 111-126; Drury, P.L et al. (1989) British Medical Bulletin 45, 127-147; Kohner, E.M. (1989) British Medical Bulletin 45,148-173)<br><br>
In healthy people, insulin secretion is closely dependent on the glucose concentration of the blood. Increased glucose levels, such as occur after meals, are rapidly compensated by an increased release of insulin. In the fasting state, the plasma Insulin level falls to a basal value, which is sufficient to guarantee a continuous supply of insulin-sensitive organs and tissue with glucose. An optimization of the therapy, the so-called intensified insulin therapy, is today primarily aimed at keeping variations in the blood glucose concentration, especially deviations upward, as low as possible (Bolli, G. B. (1989) Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 6, p. 3 - p. 16; Berger, M. (1989) Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 6, p. 25 - p. 32). This leads to a significant decrease in the occurrence and the progression of diabetic late damage (The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group (1993) N. Engl. J. Med. 329, 977-986).<br>
From the physiology of insulin secretion, it can be deduced that for an improved, intensified insulin therapy using subcutaneously administered preparations, two insulin preparations having different pharmacodynamics are needed. To compensate the blood glucose rise after meals, the insulin must flow in rapidly and must only act for a few hours. For the basal supply, in particular in the night, a preparation should be available which acts for a long time, has no pronounced maximum and only infuses very slowly.<br>
The preparations based on human and animal insulins only fulfill the demands of an intensified insulin therapy, however, in a restricted manner. After subcutaneous administration, rapidly acting insulins (unmodified insulins) pass too slowly into the blood and to the site of action and have too long an overall duration of action. The result is that the postprandial glucose levels are too high and the blood glucose begins to fall severely several hours after the meal (Kang, S. et al. (1991) Diabetes Care 14, 142-148; Home, P.J. et al. (1989) British Medical Bulletin 45, 92-110; Bollix, G. B. (1989) Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 6, p. 3 - p. 16). The available basal<br><br>
insulins in turn, especially NPH insulins, have too short a duration of action and have a too severely pronounced maximum.<br>
Beside the possibility of affecting the profile of action by means of pharma¬ceutical principles, the alternative presents itself today of designing insulin derivatives, with the aid of genetic engineering, which achieve specific properties such as onset and duration of action solely by means of their structural properties. By the use of suitable insulin derivatives, a signifi¬cantly better adjustment of the blood glucose more closely adapted to the natural conditions could therefore be achieved.<br>
Insulin derivatives having an accelerated onset of action are described in EP 0 214 826, EP 0 375 437 and EP 0 678 522. EP 0 214 826 relates, inter alia, to substitutions of B27 and 828, but not in combination with the substitution of B3. EP 0 678 522 describes insulin derivatives which have various amino acids, preferably proline, but not glutamic acid, in the position 829. EP 0 375 437 encompasses insulin derivatives having lysine or arginine in B28, which can optionally be additionally modified in 83 and/or A21.<br>
EP 0 419 504 discloses insulin derivatives which are protected against chemical modifications by changing asparagine in 83 and at least one further amino acid in the positions A5, A15, A18 or A21. Combinations with modifications in positions 827, 828 or B29 are, however, not described. An indication that these compounds have modified pharmacodynamics resulting in a more rapid onset of action is not given.<br>
WO 92/00321 describes insulin derivatives in which at least one amino acid of the positions 81-86 is replaced by lysine or arginine. According to WO 92/00321, insulins of this type have a prolonged action. Combinations with modifications of the positions 827, 28, 29, however, are not disclosed.<br><br>
The object of the present invention is to prepare insulin derivatives which after administration, in particular after subcutaneous administration, have an onset of action which is accelerated in comparison with human insulin.<br>
Insulin derivatives are derivatives of naturally occurnng insulins, namely human insulin (see SEQ ID NO 1 = A chain of human insulin; see SEQ ID NO 2 = B chain of human insulin, sequence listing) or animal insulins which differ from the corresponding, otherwise identical naturally occurring insulin by substitution of at least one naturally occurnng amino acid residue and/or addition of at least one amino acid residue and/or organic residue.<br>

The present invention accordingly also relates to said precursors of the preferred insulin derivatives, namely the peptides having the sequence numbers SEQ ID NO.: 11, SEQ ID NO 6, SEQ ID NO 7 and SEQ ID NO 8, the DNA sequences which code for said precursors, the expression vehicles which comprise these DNA sequences and the host cells which are transformed using these expression vehicles.<br><br>
The insulin derivatives of the formula I are mainly prepared by genetic engineering by means of site-directed mutagenesis according to standard methods.<br>
To do this, a gene stnjcture coding for the desired insulin derivative of the formula 1 is constructed and expressed in a host cell - preferably in a bacterium such as E. coli or a yeast, in particular Saccharomyces cerevisiae - and - if the gene structure codes for a fusion protein - the insulin derivative of the formula I is released from the fusion protein; analogous methods are described, for example, in EP-A-0 211 299, EP-A-0 227 938, EP-A-0 229 998, EP-A-0 286 956 and the DE patent application P38 21 159.<br>
The removal of the fusion protein component can be carried out chemically by cell disruption by means of cyanogen halide (see EP-A-0 180 920).<br>
tn the preparation by means of a preproinsulin precursor which has a fusion protein component (presequence) according to US 5,358,857, the removal of the fusion protein component takes place in a later stage together with the removal of the C peptide.<br>
The insulin precursor is then subjected to oxidative sulfitolysis according to the method described, for example, by R.C. Marshall and A.S. Inglis in "Practical Protein Chemistry - A Handbook" (Publisher A. Darbre) 1986, pages 49 - 53 and then renatured in the presence of a thiol with formation of the correct disulfide bridges, e.g. according to the method described by G.H. Dixon and A.C Wardlow in Nature (1960), pages 721 - 724. The insulin precursors, however, can also be folded directly (EP-A-0 600 372; EP-A-0 668 292).<br>
The C peptide is removed by means of tryptic cleavage - e.g. according to the method of Kemmler et al., J.B.C. (1971), pages 6786 - 6791 and the<br><br>
insulin derivative of the formula I is purified by means of known techniques such as chromatography - e.g. EP-A-0 305 760 - and crystallization.<br>
If n in formula II is 0, tryptic cleavage serves to sever the peptide bond between A and B chains.<br>
In this process, the B chain C terminal ends with arginine or two arginine residues. These can be removed enzymatically by means of carboxy-peptidase B.<br>
The insulin derivatives according to the invention have full biological activity. This was shown by intravenous administration to rabbits and the blood glucose fall resulting therefrom (Examples 5 and 6).<br>
The more rapid onset of action after subcutaneous administration was shown in fasting dogs using the euglycemic clamp technique (Example 7). 0.3 lU/kg was administered. The reference preparation was human insulin. In the clamp technique, the blood glucose value is measured at short time intervals after insulin injection and exactly the amount of glucose to compensate the fall is infused. This has the advantage that no counter-regulation occurs with the animals, as would be the case with a severe fall in the blood glucose after the administration of insulin. The amount and the time course of the infused glucose characterize the action of the insulin. Lys(B3), Glu(B29)- (SEQ ID NO 3) and Lys(B3), lle{B28)- (SEQ ID NO 4) insulin have a clearly more rapid onset of action than human insulin. The maximum action (glucose infusion rate) is achieved after 100 minutes with human insulin, after 80 minutes, however, with Lys(B3), Glu(B29)-insulin (SEQ ID NO 3) and already after 60 minutes with Lys(B3)-, lle(B28)-insuiin (SEQ ID NO 4). Therefore these analogs, when they are injected shortly before a meal, should compensate the postprandial rise in the blood glucose better than human insulin.<br><br>
The insulin derivatives described are therefore suitable both for the therapy of type I and of type II diabetes mellltus, preferably in combination with a basal insulin.<br>
The present invention therefore also relates to the use of the insulin derivative and/or its physiologically tolerable salt of the formula I for the production of a pharmaceutical preparation which has an insulin activity with a rapid onset of action.<br>
A suitable carrier medium which is physiologically acceptable and compatible with the insulin derivative is a sterile aqueous solution which is made isotonic with blood in the customary manner, e.g. by means of glycerol, sodium chlohde, glucose, and in addition contains one of the customary preservatives, e.g. phenol, m-cresol or p-hydroxybenzoic acid ester. The carrier medium can additionally contain a buffer substance, e.g. sodium acetate, sodium citrate, sodium phosphate. For adjustment of the pH, dilute acids (typically HCI) or alkalis (typically NaOH) are used. The preparation can furthermore contain zinc ions.<br>
The insulin derivatives can be employed In the pharmaceutical preparations even in the form of their physiologically tolerable salts, as alkali metal or as ammonium salts. Any desired proportion of one or more insulin derivatives of the formula 1 or an insulin derivative of the formula 1 can be present in a mixture of other of these insulin derivatives independently of one another in each case in dissolved, amorphous and/or crystalline form.<br>
It is sometimes advantageous to add to the preparation according to the invention a suitable amount of a suitable stabilizer which prevents the precipitation of protein under thermomechanical stress on contact with vanous materials. Such stabilizers are disclosed, for example, in EP-A-18609, DE-A 32 40 177 or in WO-83/00288.<br><br>
The present invention further relates to a pharmaceutical preparation which comprises at least one insulin derivative and/or a physiologically tolerable salt thereof of the formula I, preferably in dissolved, amorphous and/or crystalline form.<br>
The insulin derivatives according to the invention have a rapid onset of action. In practical insulin therapy, it is customary under certain circum¬stances to mix rapid-acting insulins with preparations which contain a depot auxiliary (e.g. NPH insulin). Depending on the composition, preparations result from this whose profiles of action correspond to the superimposed individual profiles provided the individual components in the mixture are stable and are not mutually affected. When mixing an insulin derivative with human NPH insulin, however, it is to be expected that, particularly on long-term storage, an exchange takes place between the dissolved derivative and the crystalline NPH insulin. As a result of this both the pharmacodynamics of the depot insulin and those of the dissolved rapidly acting insulin are changed in an unforeseeable manner. In order to avoid this, it is sensible to prepare the rapidly acting derivative using a depot auxiliary - for example as NPH insulin. This depot form of the insulin derivative can then be mixed as desired with the dissolved rapidly acting form without the composition of one or the other form changing in the course of storage due to exchange.<br>
Although the invention in essence relates to rapidly acting insulin derivatives, it accordingly, however, also comprises the possibility of preparing derivatives of this type as a depot form for the purpose of miscibility, the depot auxiliary preferably being protamine sulfate and the insulin derivative andtor its physiologically tolerable salt being present with the protamine sulfate in a cocrystallizate.<br>
The present invention further relates to an injectable solution which comprises the pharmaceutical preparations described above in dissolved form.<br><br>
Examples<br>
Example 1: Construction of Lys (B3)-proinsulin as a starting point for the plasmids relevant to the invention corresponding to Examples 2-4<br>
US 5,358,857 describes the vector pINT 90d and the PCR primers Tir and Insu 11. These components serve as starting materials for the construction of a plasmid pINT 125d, which codes for the desired Lys (B3)-proinsulin.<br>
Additionally, the primers Insu 35 having the sequence<br>
5' TTT GTG AAG CAG CAC CTG 3' and Insu 36 having the sequence<br>
5' CAG GTG CTG CTT CAC AAA 3' are synthesized.<br>
A PCR reaction is carried out using the primers Tir and Insu 36 and a second reaction is carried out using the primers Insu 11 and Insu 35. The template used for this is pINT 90d DNA.<br>
The products of the two PCR reactions are partially complementary, such that when they are combined in a third PCR reaction with the primers Tir and Insu 11 they afford a fragment which codes for a proinsulin variant which contains the B chain lysine in position 3. This PCR fragment is precipitated in ethanol for purification, dried and then digested with the restriction enzymes Nco 1 and Sal 1 according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The reaction mixture is separated by gel electrophoresis and the desired Nco 1/Sal 1 fragment is isolated.<br><br>
The application cited describes a plasmid plNT91d which codes for a mini-proinsulin. If the sequence coding for mini-proinsulin is excised by means of Nco 1 and Sal 1 and the residual plasmid DNA is isolated, this residual plasmid DNA can be reacted with the shown Nco 1/Sal 1 PCR fragment in a T4 ligase reaction to give the plasmid pINT 125d. This is transformed by E. coli K12, replicated therein and reisolated. After verification of the plasmid structure by means of DNA sequence and restriction analysis, pINT 125d DNA is used as template DNA for the introduction of further mutations into this proinsulin variant.<br>
Example 2:      Construction of Lys (B3) Glu (B29)-proinsulin<br>
For the preparation of the mutein, the primers 329a having the sequence<br>
5' TTC TAC ACA CCC GAG ACC CGC GGC ATC G - 3' and 329b having the sequence<br>
5' GCC GCG GGT CTC GGG TGT GTA GAA GAA GC 3'<br>
are synthesized.<br>
The template used is DNA of the plasmids plNT125d and pINTSId. Primer 329a is reacted with the primer Insu 11 on the template plNT91d and primer 329b is reacted with Tir (see above example) on the template plNT125d in a PCR reaction. Since both PCR products are partially complementary, they can be combined in a direct PCR reaction and reacted again with the primers Tir and Insu 11. A DNA fragment results which codes for the desired mutein. This fragment Is double-digested using the restriction enzymes Nco 1 and Sal 1 and the resulting Nco 1/Sal 1 fragment is inserted into the pINT 91d residual plasmid DNA in a T4 ligase reaction.<br><br>
The ptasmid plNT329 results, which after amplification in E. coli K12 by means of restriction and DNA sequence analysis is verified with respect to the desired structure.<br>
The proinsulin derivative encoded by the plasmid is charactehzed by the two amino acid replacements and a C-bonding member which consists of the amino acid arginlne.<br>
Example 3:      Construction of Lys (B3) lie (B27)-proinsulin<br>
The construction is carried out according to the preceding example using the primer pairs<br>
KB3 JB 27A<br>
5' TTC TAG ATC CCC AAG ACC CGC CG 3'<br>
and Insu 11<br>
and also<br>
K B3 J 27B<br>
5' CTT GGG GAT GTA GAA GAA GCC TCG 3'<br>
and Tir.<br>
The template used in both PCR reactions is DNA of the plasmid plNT125d. The PCR products of both reactions are combined in a third reaction, as described in Example 1, and the product is cloned corresponding to the example.<br>
The plasmid plNT332 results.<br><br>
Example 4:      Construction of Lys (B3) lie (B28)-proinsulin<br>
The construction is carried out according to Example 3 using the primer pairs:<br>
KB3 JB 28A<br>
5' TAG ACA ATC AAG ACC CGC CGG GAG - 3'<br>
and Insu 11<br>
and also<br>
KB J B28B<br>
5' GGT CTT GAT TGT GTA GAA GAA GCC TCG - 3'<br>
and Tir.<br>
The plasmid pINT 333 results.<br>
Expression of the constructed insulin variants<br>
The plasmids p(^4T 329, 332 and 333 are each transformed by way of example by E. coli K12 W3110. Recombinant bacteria which contain plasmids which encode the respective variants are then fermented according to Example 4 of the US patent having the patent number 5227293 and the desired raw material for the production of the respective insulin variants is thus produced.<br>
Example 5: Construction of Lys (B3), He (B28). Asp (A21 )-proinsulin<br>
Construction is carried out as in Example 3. Instead of plNT125d, however, the template serving for the PCR reaction is DNA of the plasmid plNT333, which was constructed in Example 4. The following primer pair is used here:<br><br>
P-pint 365<br>
5'-I I II I IGTCGACTATTAGTCGCAGTAGTTCTACCAGCTG-3' and TIr.<br>
The plasmid plNT365 results.<br>
