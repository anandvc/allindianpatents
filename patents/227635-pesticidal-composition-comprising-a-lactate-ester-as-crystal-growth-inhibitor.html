				<td>PESTICIDAL COMPOSITION COMPRISING A LACTATE ESTER AS CRYSTAL GROWTH INHIBITOR<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the field of pesticidal compositions, particularly to the<br>
use of lactate acid esters as a crystal growth inhibitor in said compositions.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Perhaps the most prevalent practice for applying pesticides to plants is by spraying a<br>
liquid composition onto the plant. Some technical difficulties are associated with this<br>
practice when predominantly aqueous compositions of pesticides which are essentially<br>
water insoluble, are employed. In such cases, often certain parts of the spraying<br>
equipment, e.g. filters and nozzles, are clogged as a result of crystal growth of the water-<br>
insoluble pesticide in said parts. A particular method for overcoming this problem is by<br>
inhibiting or preventing the crystal growth of the pesticide in the sprayer parts by<br>
employing a crystal growth inhibitor in the pesticidal composition. U.S. 5,206,225<br>
describes the employment of alkylcarboxylic acid dimethylarnides as crystallization<br>
inhibitors of azole fungicides. EP 637,202 describes a liquid pesticidal composition<br>
containing as crystallization inhibitor benzene which contains two or three hydroxy<br>
groups and substituted by one or more lower alkyl groups. Notwithstanding, the prior art<br>
crystallization inhibitors are organic substances which are essentially insoluble in an<br>
aqueous medium. Hence, it is necessary to employ an organic co-solvent in which the<br>
pesticide and crystal growth inhibitor are soluble. This may present difficulties in terms of<br>
' environmental safety and phytotoxicity. The current practice in pest control is to reduce<br>
the use of organic solvents.<br>
WO 00/35284 describes an aqueous suspension concentrate of triazole fungicides which<br>
contains a tristyrylphenol-ethoxylate, phosphate or sulfate thereof, with a vinylpyrrolidon<br>
polymer or copolymer thereof, as a crystal growth inhibitor. However, in order to inhibit<br>
crystal growth according to WO 00/35284 it is necessary to employ a mixture of<br>
crystallization inhibitors; at least a binary mixture thereof.<br>
Furthermore, the crystal growth inhibitors disclosed in the prior publications do not offer<br>
a solution for all needs, practices and conditions employed in agriculture. The crystal<br>
growth inhibitor may vary in accordance with the active ingredient. Thus, mere is an<br>
ongoing need to develop further crystal growth inhibitors which overcome the<br>
shortcomings of the prior art.<br>
It is therefore a purpose of the present invention to provide a pesticidal composition with<br>
a new crystal growth inhibitor.<br>
A further purpose of the present invention is to present the new use of a compound as a<br>
crystal growth inhibitor.<br>
Yet a further purpose of the present invention is to provide a method for crystal growth<br>
inhibition in pesticidal compositions.<br>
Other objects of the invention will become apparent as the description proceeds.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a method for preventing crystallization of pesticidal<br>
compositions during application, comprising adding a lactate ester as a crystallization<br>
prevention agent to the composition.<br>
The present invention provides a liquid pesticidal composition comprising one or more<br>
pesticide as an active ingredient and a lactate ester as a crystal growth inhibitor.<br>

Compositions according to the present invention may further contain surfactant agents,<br>
thickners,anti-foaming agents, dispersing agents and wetting agents.<br>
1% to 40% of the present composition may be surfactant agents wherein non-limiting<br>
examples of suitable surface-active compounds are nonionic, cationic and/ or anionic<br>
surfactants having good emulsifying, dispersing and wetting properties. The term<br>
"surfactants" will also be understood as comprising mixtures of surfactants.<br>
Suitable anionic surfactants can be both water-soluble soaps and water-soluble synthetic<br>
surface-active compounds. Suitable soaps are the alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal<br>
salts or unsubstituted or substituted ammonium salts of higher fatty acids (C10 -C22), e.g.<br>
the sodium or potassium salts of oleic or stearic acid, or of natural fatty acid mixtures<br>
which can be obtained, e.g. from coconut oil or tallow oil. Further suitable surfactants are<br>
also the fatty acid methyltaurin salts as well as modified and unmodified phospholipids.<br>
More frequently, however, so-called synthetic surfactants are used, especially fatty<br>
sulfonates, fatty sulfates, sulfonated benzimidazole derivatives or alkylarylsulfonates.<br>
The fatty sulfonates or sulfates are usually in the form of alkali metal salts, alkali earth<br>
metal salts or unsubstituted or substituted ammonium salts and contain a C8 -C22 alkyl<br>
radical which also includes the alkyl moiety of acyl radicals, e.g. the sodium or calcium<br>
salt of lignosulfonic acid, of dodecylsulfate, or of a mixture of fatty alcohol sulfates<br>
obtained from natural fatty acids. These compounds also comprise the salts of sulfuric<br>
acid esters and sulfonic acids of fatty alcohol/ethylene oxide adducts. The sulfonated<br>
benzimidazole derivatives preferably contain 2 sulfonic acid groups and one fatty acid<br>
radical containing 8 to 22 carbon atoms. Examples of alkylarylsulfonates are the sodium,<br>
calcium or triethanolamine salts of dodecylbenzenesulfomc acid,<br>
dibutylnaphthalenesulfonic acid, or of a naphthalenesulfonic acid/formaldehyde<br>
condensation product. Also suitable are corresponding phosphates, e.g. salts of the<br>
phosphoric acid ester of an adduct of p-nonylphenol with 4 to 14 moles of ethylene oxide.<br>
Non-ionic surfactants are preferably polyglycol ether derivatives of aliphatic or<br>
cycloaliphatic alcohols, or saturated or unsaturated fatty acids and alkylphenols, said<br>
derivatives containing 3 to 30 glycol ether groups and 8 to 20 carbon atoms in the<br>
(aliphatic) hydrocarbon moiety and 6 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety of the<br>
alkylphenols.<br>
Further suitable non-ionic surfactants are the water-soluble adducts of polyethylene oxide<br>
with polypropylene glycol, ethylenediaminopolypropylene glycol and alkylpolypropylene<br>
glycol containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain, which adducts contain 20 to<br>
250 ethylene glycol ether groups and 10 to 100 propylene glycol ether groups. These<br>
compounds usually contain 1 to 5 ethylene glycol units per propylene glycol unit.<br>
Representative examples of non-ionic surfactants are nonylpheholpolyethoxyethanols,<br>
castor oil polyglycol ethers, polypropylene/polyethylene oxide adducts,<br>
tributylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol, polyethylene glycol and<br>
octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol. Fatty acid esters of polyoxyethylene sorbitan, e.g.<br>
polyoxyethylene sorbitan trioleate, are also suitable non-ionic surfactants.<br>
Cationic surfactants are preferably quaternary ammonium salts which contain, as<br>
N-substituent, at least one C8 -C22 alkyl radical and, as further substituents, unsubstituted<br>
or halogenated lower alkyl, benzyl or hydroxy-lower alkyl radicals. The salts are<br>
preferably in the form of halides, methylsulfates or ethylsulfates, e.g.<br>
stearyltrimethylammonium chloride or benzyldi (2-chloroethyl) ethylammonium bromide,<br>
preferably 1% to 40%.<br>
Anti-foaming agents (AF) suitable for use in the present composition are those<br>
customarily employed in pesticidal compositions, wherein non-limiting examples of said<br>
agents are silicon oils or silicon oil emulsions in water commercially available as, e.g.,<br>
Dapro DF-1161, wherein 0% to 1% of anti-foarrdng agent are employed, preferably 0% to<br>
According to a particular aspect of the present invention, the compositions of the present<br>
invention can contain up to 50% water. Non-limiting examples of such compositions are:<br>
emulsifiable concentrates (EC) and emulsion in water (EW) formulations.<br>
Preparation:<br>
Charge the Purasolve to the vessel and heat to 50 - 60°C. Add the tebuconazole<br>
and rosin gum and mix until homogenous solution is obtained. Cool to ambient<br>
temp, and add the Berol, Emcol and AF and mix until homogenous solution is<br>
obtained. Add the water, mix for another hour.<br>
Example 2: Comparative preparation without crystallization inhibitors<br>
Test of crystal growth inhibition<br>
The formation of crystals in spraying solutions is determined in various conditions in<br>
order to assure no crystal formation in various spraying conditions.<br>
10 liters of spraying solutions are prepared using hard water (CIPAC standard water D,<br>
342 ppm) in 3 different concentrations: 0.5, 1, 2 times the recommended spraying<br>
concentration for each formulation. Each sample is placed at 3 different temperatures:<br>
2°C, 15°C and 30°C for 24 hours to allow crystal growth. The solutions are sprayed using<br>
a personal spraying machine and using two filters (~8 gr. each); 100 and 50 mesh. After<br>
spraying the filters are dried and weighed. A weight difference of the filter before and<br>
after spraying of less than 0.05 gr. indicates essentially no crystal growth. Hence, there<br>
will not be filter blocking.<br>
While embodiments of the invention have been described by way of illustration, it will be<br>
apparent that the invention may be carried out with many modifications, variations and<br>
adaptations, without departing from its spirit or exceeding the scope of the claims.<br>
