7. ABSTRACT OF THE INVENTION: N.A.<br>
1<br><br>
Technical Field:<br>
The present invention relates to a device for monitoring the usage of air conditioner in motor vehicles.<br>
Prior Art:<br>
Patent No. JP119339 discloses the operational history collecting and managing system of automotive unit. The stated objective is to evaluate the residual life for each<br>
control unit inside the vehicle with high accuracy. Individual control units in the car (engine, ABS, a damper, electronic steering, air conditioner, combination meter, air bag and a display, transmission control units for respective sensors and actuators) are connected through a common LAN to a central control unit which transmits and receives data from individual units. A maintenance input/outut terminal interfaces with the central control units and is used to collect and manage the operation history of each unit connected to the LAN.<br>
However, it is not clearly defined in the available documentation as to whether the device monitors the control units or the systems they control. Further, it does not define nature and purpose of monitoring done on the air conditioning.<br>
Patent No. US 6366199 discloses method and apparatus for measuring and accumulating critical automobile warranty statistical data. The stated objective is a system for monitoring operating parameter information to derive warranty statistical data. It uses a microprocessor and sensor interface mounted in housing. Signals from sensors that monitor various vehicle operating parameters are fed to the microprocessor via interface and stored in its memory. The stored parameter information is accessed via a data interface and processed using statistical tools to obtain warranty statistical data. Also describes further uses like deriving predictive mathematical models, prescribe servicing actions to customers, better manage vehicle availability through predictive maintenance programs.<br>
2<br><br>
Thermal sensors provided in the compressor circuit to monitor air conditioner usage patterns. Although it could be used to recommend service actions to a customer when his vehicle reaches the service centre, it does not provide for alerting the customer to take his vehicle for servicing the air conditioner. There is no display of amount air conditioner usage for customer to control. The device has no in built processing capability or convert air conditioner operation in a stationary vehicle to distance. In short, concept for this device relates to vehicle manufacturers, while the invention below relates to the vehicle customer/user.<br>
Summary of the Invention:<br>
The object of the present invention is to measure, record and display on-line amount of use of vehicle air conditioner through the vehicle's driver information system in kilometers and hours.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to record and display air conditioner utilization with vehicle in stationary condition i.e. idle time with air conditioner on.<br>
It is further object of the present invention to display the quantity of fuel consumed with air conditioner ON to enable a fuel consumption calculation in conjunction with kilometers traveled.<br>
It is still further object of the present invention to provide an alert for service intervals only for the air conditioner so as to maintain its function and reliability.<br>
The purpose of the present invention is to support fault diagnosis in case of air conditioning function failure.<br>
The aim of the present invention is to display the cabin air temperature.<br>
3<br><br>
Description of the Present Invention:<br>
The foregoing objects of the invention are accomplished and the problems and shortcomings associated with prior art techniques and approaches are overcome by the present invention described in the present embodiment.<br>
The figure 1 is the block diagram with respect to the present invention. The figure 2 shows the working of the present invention.<br>
The figure 1 shows a numerical display in driver information system (1) and an AC control unit (2) with connections to the electrical circuit of the vehicle air conditioner system.<br>
The input signals are given from:<br>
a.	Vehicle or speed sensor (3)<br>
b.	AC request switch (4) on the instrument panel of the vehicle.<br>
c.	Pressure switch (5), de-icing switch (6), relay bank(7) controlling the AC<br>
compressor (10) and condenser fan switch (11) the condenser fan (12) operation.<br>
d.	Cabin air temperature sensor(8)<br>
e.	Engine electronic control unit i.e ECU (9)<br>
The fault diagnosis is through the diagnostic interface (13).<br>
Operation &amp; Function:<br>
1.	AC counter starts when the "AC ON " switch is put on and blower motor is also ON and stops when either of these is put off.<br>
2.	Normal AC compressor on/off cycling does not stop the count.<br>
3.	It does not count in case compressor is not in operation due to defects.<br>
4.	The utilization can be cumulative i.e similar in behaviour to the main odometer of the vehicle and / or trip- linked.<br>
4<br><br>
5.	If AC is used with the vehicle at standstill, the utilization can be displayed separately in "idle hours" and /or add into the "kms" display. Conversion from time to kms is achieved by multiplying time in idling with a constant factor.<br>
6.	No direct facility for "re-set" of kms and hours is given. Such facility is only through the vehicle diagnostics tool and protected by a code/password.<br>
7.	Altering the owner for AC service is displayed and /or audible. Fault diagnosis can be supported through engine diagnostics interface.<br>
8.	The fuel count is re-settable for each trip. The controller has a memory to store the kms for the last five trips with the fuel consumed with air conditioner ON.<br>
9.	Cabin temperature and blower speed can be displayed.<br>
Technical Aspect of Driver Information System in Embodiments:<br>
1.	The switch input from the AC input switch and compressor switch is given to ports of the microcontroller.<br>
2.	The microcontroller starts updating the AC meter in "Kms" in consideration with the<br>
vehicle speed from the speed sensor.<br>
3.	The microcontroller will update the kms as the normal odometer.<br>
4.	When the speed value is zero and when the AC switch is ON then the microcontroller will take this count in the "IDLE COUNT ". Since AC counter values are written to the EEPROM connected externally to the microcontroller it is possible to make the values non re-settable.<br>
5.	When the AC count has reached a certain Km, the MCU can send signal to the LCD as an indication for service.<br>
6.	The cabin temperature can be given to the microcontroller through ADC and the microcontroller will calculate the temperature and will send signal to the LCD to display the temperature.<br>
7.	Since already the fuel signal is sent to the microcontroller the fuel consumption rate with the AC ON can be calculated and sent to the LCD.<br>
8.	Logic for resetting the fuel counter is provided. The value of the trip km can be stored<br>
5<br><br>
in the EEPROM when the fuel counter is reset. 9. Five trip values can be stored in the EEPROM.<br>
