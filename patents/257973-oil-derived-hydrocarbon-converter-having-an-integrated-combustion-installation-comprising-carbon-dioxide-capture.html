				<td>OIL-DERIVED HYDROCARBON CONVERTER IN<br>
AN INTEGRATED COMBUSTION INSTALLATION WITH A<br>
CARBON DIOXIDE TRAP.<br>
The invention relates to an oil-derived hydrocarbon converter coupled<br>
to an integrated combustion installation with a carbon dioxide trap.<br>
Such an oil-derived hydrocarbon converter includes a hydrocarbon<br>
catalytic cracking baffle in the presence of catalyst particles in fluidized phase<br>
and which fractionated oil cuts are recovered by ballistic separation of the<br>
particles and these fractional oil cuts. In this first baffle is customarily<br>
associated a catalyst particle regenerator, on which coke is deposited within<br>
the cracking vessel. In this regenerator, the catalyst particles are regenerated<br>
by burning the coke and are then recycled towards the cracking baffle.<br>
These types of installation are described in patent documents FR 2<br>
625 509, FR 2 753 453 and FR 2 811 327.<br>
Conventionally to achieve the combustion of coke in the regenerator<br>
by means of injected air at the base of the regenerator and the combustion gas<br>
containing in part carbon dioxide, resulting from the reaction of the oxygen in<br>
air and the carbon constituting the coke, is evacuated at the top part of the<br>
regenerator.<br>
Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse-effect gas that should be reduced<br>
from emissions, bringing about a total or partial capture of this dioxide.<br>
The carbon dioxide can be captured in a reactor by washing with a<br>
solvent, for example, monoethanolamine, which selectively solubilises the<br>
carbon dioxide.<br><br>
The solvent is then regenerated by extracting the carbon dioxide due to<br>
heating by injecting steam in another reactor then the regenerated solvent is<br>
returned to the scrubber unit. However, this solution has to be treated with<br>
nitrogen, which is also evacuated in part with the carbon dioxide at the top of<br>
the catalyst regenerator, which means proportioning the carbon dioxide trap in<br>
proportion with the quantity of nitrogen present. Furthermore, the thermal<br>
regeneration entails the inconvenience of requiring large quantities of steam.<br>
This solution therefore consumes a lot of energy.<br>
Consequently, replacing the nitrogen diluent by recycled carbon<br>
dioxide and burning with an O2/CO2 oxidizer. However, the oxygen is produced<br>
from air by using an air separation unit with a cryogenic system that consumes<br>
a lot of energy.<br>
Another process known to carry out gas combustion with integrated<br>
recuperation of carbon dioxide while using a metallic oxide used as an oxygen<br>
vehicle support. This oxide circulates between two reactors in which it is<br>
oxidized in a fluidized bed reactor circulating by mixing with air, is reduced by<br>
mixing with the gaseous fuel. This process has an advantage of not requiring<br>
an air separation unit since the oxide forms the oxygen support.<br>
These carbon dioxide capturing processes have the inconvenience of<br>
increasing the investment cost twofold and they require large areas.<br>
Therefore it has been considered as described in the patent document<br>
FR 2 850 156 to make a carbonaceous solid combustion facility to include a<br>
reactor for reducing oxides, a first cyclone, an exchanger for flue gas heat<br>
recovery, a reactor for oxidizing oxides, a second cyclone, exchangers for<br>
controlling temperature of the circulating oxides, in which circulates an oxide<br>
which is reduced and then oxidized in each of both reactors. According to this<br>
prior art,<br><br>
the solid combustible material is milled before entering the oxide reduction<br>
reactor. The oxides are reduced by first of all having them in contact with the<br>
fuel which reacts with the oxygen released by the oxide and then oxidized by<br>
contact with air which regenerates the oxide. The reduced size of the solid fuel<br>
particles allows more complete and faster combustion and production of<br>
nearly 100% of fly ash.<br>
This type of facility for combustion of carbonaceous solid materials<br>
operating at atmospheric pressure with integrated capture of carbon dioxide<br>
does not require any prior air separation. Because of the simplicity and the<br>
compactness of this system the costs of capturing carbon dioxide may be<br>
reduced while providing production of steam for generating electricity.<br>
The invention proposes an integration of a system of this type to<br>
capture the carbon dioxide emitted in a hydrocarbon conversion facility such<br>
as specified above. By using the invention, the carbon dioxide is captured,<br>
while providing the production of steam intended for the production of energy,<br>
and an optimal size and cost.<br>
To do this, the invention proposes an oil-derived hydrocarbon<br>
conversion facility including a catalytic cracking baffle in the presence of<br>
catalyser particles in fluidized phase and a regenerator of the said catalyser<br>
particles by burning coke deposited on these, the said catalyst circulating<br>
between the said cracking vessel and said regenerator, the said regenerator<br>
being a reactor integrated in a combustion facility to produce steam including<br>
capturing the carbon dioxide, characterized in that the said regenerator is a<br>
reduction reactor for an oxygen support, supplied with solid fuel including the<br>
said particles supplied with coke and equipped with a separation cyclone for<br>
the solids and exchangers, this reduction reactor for the said oxygen support<br>
being associated with an oxidization reactor for the said oxygen support and<br>
equipped with a separation cyclone for the solids and exchangers, the said<br>
oxygen support circulating between these two reactors and in thai the said<br>
oxygen support is constituted from metallic oxide particles<br><br>
of average diameter different from that of the aforesaid catalyser particles.<br>
So is achieved the integration of a circulating loop for the catalyser<br>
particles, providing the conversion of the oil-derived hydrocarbons, and an<br>
oxygen support circulating loop, providing a energy-producing combustion and<br>
capturing the carbon dioxide.<br>
By carefully choosing the catalytic cracking material, the said oxygen<br>
support can be constituted with the said catalyst particles.<br>
Generally, the said oxygen support is formed from average diameter<br>
metallic oxide particles different from the said catalyst particles.<br>
According to a preferred method, the said reduction reactor is a<br>
circulating fluidized bed fluidized by the steam and/or the recycled carbon<br>
dioxide and/or sulphur dioxide.<br>
Advantageously, the installation includes in the cyclone outlet of the<br>
reduction reactor a siphon separating said metallic oxide particles directed<br>
towards the oxidization reactor and said catalyst particles directed towards the<br>
cracking baffle.<br>
It can be set up, between the said cyclone outlet of the reduction<br>
reactor and the said cracking baffle, a granulometric sorter re-injecting the<br>
metallic oxide particles into the reduction reactor and the catalyst particles into<br>
the cracking baffle.<br>
In this case, preferably, the said granulometric sorter has a circulating<br>
fluidized bed equipped with a separation cyclone.<br>
Preferably, said catalyst particles are re-introduced into the said<br>
cracking baffle by means of a rising duct of a defined height of which the load<br>
loss compensates the difference in pressure between the said baffle and the<br>
said granulometric sorter. This balances the difference in pressure between<br>
the circulation loop of the catalyst particles and the circulation loop of the<br>
metallic oxide particles.<br><br>
The ratio between the average diameter of the metallic oxide particles<br>
and the catalyst particles is advantageously higher than 2:1.<br>
Said metallic oxides can include iron oxide.<br>
Said catalyst particles can consist of nickel oxide.<br>
To provide requirements in steam or electricity, it is possible that said<br>
solid fuel also includes oil residues, such as pitch, bitumen or asphalt, to<br>
generate sufficient power.<br>
The invention is described in detail below together with a diagram<br>
which only represents a preferred method of carrying out the invention.<br>
This diagram represents an installation conforming with the invention.<br>
This installation includes an oil-derived hydrocarbon converter<br>
including a catalytic cracking baffle 1 in the presence of catalyst particles in a<br>
fluidized phase that is fed by a duct A1 and a catalyst particle regenerator 2 by<br>
combusting the coke deposited on these, the catalyst circulating between the<br>
cracking baffle 1 and the regenerator 2. The catalyst particles are evacuated<br>
from the cracking baffle towards the regenerator by a supply duct 1A and are<br>
re-injected from this regenerator towards the cracking baffle by a re-injection<br>
duct 2A. Some fractional oil cuts are obtained from the cracking baffle outlet by<br>
an outlet duct 1B. In such a cracking baffle, the temperature is around 650°C<br>
and the pressure about 2 bars.<br>
According to the invention, the regenerator 2 is a reactor integrated in a<br>
combustion installation for producing steam with a carbon dioxide trap.<br>
This regenerator 2 is a reduction reactor for an oxygen support,<br>
preferably formed from average diameter metallic oxide particles different from<br>
the catalyst particles, supplied in solid fuel including the particles provided<br>
from coke by the<br><br>
supply duct 1A and equipped with a separation cyclone C2 for the solids and<br>
exchangers E2. The solid fuel fed by the duct A2 can also include oil residues.<br>
This reduction reactor is a heat source to the circulating fluidized bed<br>
fluidized with the steam by a supply duct 2B and an air box 2C introducing the<br>
fluidization steam in the lower part of the reduction reactor 2. This steam is<br>
mixed with the carbon dioxide or the sulphur dioxide recycled by an additional<br>
duct 2D clearing in the same air box 2C. In such a combustion reactor, the<br>
temperature is around 900°C and the pressure is atmospheric pressure.<br>
Generally speaking, the said reduction reactor 2 is a circulating<br>
fluidized bed fluidized by the steam and/or the recycled carbon dioxide and/or<br>
sulphur dioxide.<br>
In the top part of the reduction reactor 2 is installed the cyclone C2<br>
where the solid particles separated from the fly ash and the combustion gases<br>
containing carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and steam.<br>
The fly ash and the combustion gases are brought to the heat<br>
exchangers E2 and steam generators for the production of electricity. The fly<br>
ash is separated from the combustion gases in a bag filter F2. The combustion<br>
gases are then sent into a cooling and condensation circuit R2 via a fan V2.<br>
This circuit extracts water and the remaining H2SO4 from the carbon dioxide<br>
which is then partially reintroduced into the reactor 2 by the additional duct 2D.<br>
The fly ash is separated from the metallic oxide particles by a granulometric<br>
separator S2 to be stocked in a silo, whereas the metallic oxide particles are<br>
sent towards a silo 4.<br>
The solid particles coming from the C2 separator, containing metallic<br>
oxide particles, regenerated catalyst particles and carbon residues, pass via a<br>
siphon 5 from where a first part is<br><br>
sent into a granulometric separator 6 intended for separating the metallic oxide<br>
particles and the catalyst particles and which will be made clear further on. A<br>
second part coming from the cyclone is discharged towards a elimination<br>
device for the carbon residue 7.<br>
This elimination device 7 is fluidized by the steam from a steam inlet<br>
duct 8, also supplying the feed duct 2B of the reduction reactor 2. This<br>
fluidization separates the fine and light particles such as the carbon residual<br>
from the metallic oxide particles and reintroduces them into the reduction<br>
reactor 2 via a duct 7A, while the denser and larger metallic oxide particles are<br>
transferred by a duct 7B towards a second reactor 3 that is an oxidization<br>
reactor. A composition example of such an elimination device 7 is described in<br>
the patent document FR 2 850 156.<br>
The oxidization reactor 3 is equipped with a starting system D3 that is<br>
supplied with fuel such as gas, a system of introducing the metallic oxide<br>
particles from the oxides silo 4 and a fluidization and oxidization system by a<br>
supply duct 9. This starting system D3 reheats the reactors and the solids<br>
circulation loops up to a temperature threshold higher than 700°C and starts<br>
the reactions.<br>
The oxidization reactor 3 for the oxygen support, containing metallic<br>
oxide particles of an average diameter different from the catalyst particles, is<br>
equipped with a separation cyclone for the solids C3 and exchangers E3.<br>
A bed composed of metallic oxides circulates in the oxidization reactor<br>
3 that is fluidized by air coming from the inlet duct 9 supplying an air box 3C. In<br>
such an oxidization reactor, the temperature is around 1000°C and the<br>
pressure is atmospheric pressure.<br>
The metallic oxide particles and exhausted air, after oxidization in the<br>
reactor in question 3, passes into the solids separation cyclone<br><br>
C3 where the metallic oxide particles are separated from the constituted gases<br>
essentially nitrogen, oxygen and fly ash.<br>
The hot gases are cooled in the heat exchangers E3 and steam<br>
generator for the production of electricity. The oxide particles carried along are<br>
separated from the air by a bag filter F3 and reproduced into the oxide silo 4,<br>
while an exhaust fan sends back air into the atmosphere via a chimney 10.<br>
The solid particles that have been extracted in the cyclone C3 pass by<br>
a siphon 11 from where a first part is transferred into the base of the reduction<br>
reactor 2, a second part is re-circulated into the base of the oxidization reactor<br>
3 and a third part is sent towards an outside bed 12 by air supplied by the air<br>
inlet duct 9 where a fluidized heat exchanger is situated, then finally<br>
reintroduced into the oxidization reactor 3. This exchanger controls the<br>
temperature in the oxidization reactor 3.<br>
Extra metallic oxide particles in the oxidization reactor 3 are possible<br>
from the oxide silo 4 via the duct 13. Extra oxide particles can be justified to<br>
compensate the losses by attrition in the different reactors 2 and 3, so as to<br>
provide sufficient oxides to ensure the transfer of materials and the circulation<br>
of the solids. The large ash particles or agglomerates are periodically<br>
extracted by an extraction duct 14 at the bottom of the oxidation reactor to a<br>
recovery silo.<br>
As already mentioned, between the reduction reactor cyclone outlet<br>
C2 and the cracking baffle 1, there is a granulometric sorter 6 re-injecting the<br>
metallic oxide particles into the reduction reactor 2 and the catalyst particles<br>
into the cracking baffle 1.<br>
In the said, in effect, it is anticipated that the oxygen support is made<br>
up of metallic oxide particles different from the catalyst particles, which are, for<br>
example, made up from nickel oxide. This metallic oxide<br><br>
preferably includes iron oxide and could also be manganese oxide, copper or<br>
nickel.<br>
Equally within the framework of the invention, this oxygen support can<br>
be formed from the catalyst particles themselves. In this case, the<br>
granulometric sorter 6 is not required.<br>
To effectively sort the particles, when the oxide particles are different<br>
from the catalyst particles, the granulometry of these particles is chosen so<br>
that the ratio between the average diameter of the oxide particles and the<br>
catalyst particles is higher than 2:1. By way of example, the oxide particles<br>
have an average diameter of about 160 microns and the catalyst particles<br>
have an average diameter of about 60 microns.<br>
The granulometric sorter 6 is formed from a circulating fluidized bed<br>
6A supplied in steam via the inlet duct 8 and equipped with a separation<br>
cyclone 6B sized to carry out the sorting. In the lower part of the cyclone 6B in<br>
question, the evacuated oxide particles that are re-injected into the lower part<br>
of the reduction reactor 2. In the top part of the cyclone 6B in question, the<br>
catalyst particles are sent back into the cracking baffle 1, by means of a rising<br>
duct 6C of a defined height from which the load loss compensates the<br>
difference in pressure between the cracking baffle 1 and the granulometric<br>
sorter 6. This transfer is done via a hopper 15.<br>
The cycle of the different reactions will now be described.<br>
The oil-derived hydrocarbons and the catalyst particles are introduced<br>
into the cracking baffle 1. Fractional oil cuts are obtained and the catalyst<br>
particles charged with coke and therefore carbon are evacuated in the<br>
reduction reactor 2, possibly with oil residues.<br>
This reduction reactor 2 being a circulating fluidized bed, an increased<br>
time delay in this reactor is obtained because of the internal circulation of the<br>
solids in this reactor and the recirculation via its cyclone C2. The volatile<br>
materials clear very quickly after reheating the<br><br>
fuel and reacts with the oxygen cleared by the oxygen vehicle metallic oxide to<br>
perform a partial combustion that continues with the combustion of the fixed<br>
carbon, ensuring the elimination of coke carried by the catalyst particles that<br>
are regenerated on one hand, and on the other hand the reduction in possibly<br>
additional metallic oxide particles.<br>
A part of the oxide bed is extracted at the bottom of the siphon 5<br>
situated under the cyclone associated with this reduction reactor 2, to be<br>
purified from the carbon residues that have not been transformed into fly ash,<br>
using the elimination device 7 that forms a barrier to the carbon in the<br>
installation, then reintroduced into the oxidization reactor 3 to be oxidized by<br>
the oxygen in the air.<br>
Due to this carbon barrier, no carbon residual is transferred into the<br>
oxidization reactor 3. Thus, it is not produced from carbon dioxide, which<br>
would reduce the efficiency in capturing the carbon dioxide from the<br>
installation.<br>
Air weak in oxygen coming from the oxidization reactor 3 is cooled in<br>
the heat exchanger E3, that for practical purposes is formed from a plurality of<br>
exchangers, then any dust is removed in the bag filter F3 and sent back out to<br>
the atmosphere.<br>
The oxide particles regenerated after their passage into the<br>
oxidization reactor 3 are sent back towards the reduction reactor 2 to start a<br>
new cycle of transporting oxygen from the oxidization 3 reactor towards the<br>
reduction reactor 2. The quantity of oxides sent back into the reduction reactor<br>
2 can be controlled by a flow control valve (not shown).<br>
Another part of the oxide bed extracted with the siphon base 5 situated<br>
under the cyclone associated with the reduction reactor 2, is directed on the<br>
one hand downwards from the reduction reactor 2 to maintain a circulation of<br>
solids in the reactor 2, and on the other hand towards the granulometric sorter<br>
6, that separates the regenerated catalyst particles thai are re-injeeioid into<br><br>
the cracking baffle 1 and the residual oxide particles which are reintroduced<br>
into the base of the reduction reactor.<br>
As mentioned earlier, it is possible to use as a cracking catalyst, an<br>
oxygen support which can also ensure the oxygen circulation loop between<br>
the two reactors 2 and 3. The installation is simplified since it is not then<br>
required to carry out the granulometric sorting done by the sorter 6.<br><br>
