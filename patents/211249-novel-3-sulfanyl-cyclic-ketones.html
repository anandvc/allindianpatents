				<td>This invention relates to novel 3-sulfanyl cyclic ketones This invention particularly relates to novel 3-sulfanyl cyclic ketones of formula 3 wherein, A is methylene or ethylene, R may be hydrogen or methyl-7-heptanoate, R1 may be hydrogen, hydroxy, ter-butyldimethylsilyloxy, triethylsilyloxy, or trimethylsilyloxy:, and R2 may be, 2-hydroxyethylsulfanyl, 2-hydroxy-3-(4-methoxylphenyloxy)propylsulfanyl, 2-hydroxy-3-( 1-naphthyloxy)propyisulfanyl or 2-hydroxy-3-(2-naphthyloxy)propylsulfanyl. This invention also relates to a process for the preparation of 3-sulfanyl cyclic ketones More particularly it relates to the zeolite catalysed 1,4-addition (Michael addition) of thiols having formula (1) to cyclic enones having general formula (2) in the drawing accompanying this specification wherein, A is methylene or ethylene, R may be hydrogen or methyl-7-heptanoate, RI may be hydrogen, hydroxy, ter-butyldimethylsilyloxy, triethylsilyloxy, or trimethylsilyloxy; into cyclic ketones of the general formula (3) in the drawing accompanying this specification wherein; A, R, and RI are as above (for 2) and R2 may be 4-chlorothiophenyl, 4-methylthiophenyl, 2-hydroxyethylsulfanyl, 2-hydroxy-3-(4-methoxylphenyloxy)propylsulfanyl, 2-hydroxy-3-(l-naphthyloxy)propyl-sulfanyl or 2-hydroxy-3-(2-naphthyloxy)propylsulfanyl. Still more particularly it relates to process for the preparation of 13-thiaprostaglandin derivatives.<br>
This method provides preparation of 13-thiaprostaglandin derivatives racemic or optically active depending upon the cyclic enone used. 13-Thiaprostaglandin derivatives are biologically active molecules, e.g. prosolvin is marketed as a veterinary luteolytic drug<br><br>
Some other analogues are useful in the treatment of glaucoma, ocular hypertension and high blood pressure. It is believed that the 13-sulfur atom acts as a bioisostere of the<br>
13, 14-( cis ) double bond of the normal prostaglandin omega chain<br>
The compounds of formula (3) wherein; A is methylene, R is 7-heptanoic acid, R1 is hydroxy and R2 is 2-hydroxy-3-(4-chloro or methoxyphenyloxy)propylsulfanyl have been prepared by generally employing the methods disclosed in the forgoing references either alone or in combination with other methods. Base catalysed addition of thiols on the cyclic enone system of the formula 2 with the corresponding substituents in the drawing accompanying this specification is known in the literature wherein organic bases like diisopropylamine, piperidine, triethylamine etc are used Heterogenous or inorganic catalysts such as clays, Y-type zeolites, heteropolyacids, H-ZSM-5, LaN?trts-(binaphthoxide), SmNa3 tris (binaphthoxide) have been employed for Michael addition of different substrates wherein in some reports alcohols are used instead of thiols. Y-type zeolites have been used for Michael addition of thioacetic acid to acyclic α,ß-unsaturated carboxylic acid esters. The x- and y-type zeolites are alluminosilicates with different percentages of aluminum and silica. They are commercially available or can be prepared by known methods (D.W.Breck, "Zeolite Molecular Sieves Structure, chemistry and use", London, Wiley (1974). Some of the related references are:<br>

x-type zeolites doped with lithium, potassium or cesium metal for 1,4-addition of thiols to a cyclic enone system of the formula 2 and the preparation of compounds of the formula 3<br>
Some of the compounds of the formula 3 prepared and reported by the present process are novel. The hitherto known methods using organic bases resulted into side products and disulfide formation as major component during the preparation of the compounds of the formula 3. However, the disulfide formation has been minimized by employing the zeolite catalyst which maintains neutral conditions for the reaction.<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to provide a process for the preparation of 3-sulfanyl cyclic ketones using x-type zeolite with lithium / potassium / cesium cations<br><br>

hydrogen, hydroxyl, ter-butyldimethylsilyloxy, triethysilyloxy, or trimethylsilyloxy; and<br>
R2 may be 2-hydroxyethylsulfanyl, 2-hydroxy-3-(4-chloro or<br>
methoxyphenyloxy)propylsulfanyl, 2-hydroxy-3-(1-naphthyloxy)propyl-sulfanyl or 2-<br>
hydroxy-3-(1-naphthyloy)propyl-sulfanyl	or	2-hydroxy-3-(2-naphthyloxy)<br>
propylsulfanyl.<br>

In one of the embodiments of the present invention the cyclic enone may be of the general formula 2 wherein, A may be methylene or ethylene, R may be Hydrogen or methyl 7-heptanoate, R1 may be hydrogen, hydroxy, ter-butyldimethylsilyloxy, triethylsilyloxy or trimethylsilyloxy<br>

In another embodiment the x type zeolite catalyst may be doped with lithium, potassium or cesium Preferably Li-X-type zeolite.<br>
In  yet  another embodiment the dehydrating agent  used  may  be  sodium  sulfate  or magnesium sulfate. <br><br>
In a feature of the present invntion the crude products of the formula 3 are<br>
purified using column chromatography with silica gel as an adsorbent and<br>
petroleum ether : ethyl acetate as an eluting solvent system to achieve 50-<br>
90% yield of the pure isolated product.<br>

BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY :<br>
Thiaprostaglandins are prostaglandin analogs in which the trans double bond at C13-C14 in natural prostaglandin F2oe is replaced by sulfur  Such sulfur analogs are known for their<br><br>
luteolytic activity ( veterinary ) in the literature. For example, prosolvin is presently used as lutenizing hormone in cattle breeding. The thiaprostaglandin analogs prepared and included in this specification are expected to possess similar biological activity.<br>
ADVANTAGES:<br>
Thiaprostaglandins can be readily prepared by our process using zeolite catalysts which can be removed by filtration, reused and recycled. This process provides cheaper methodology of preparing biologically important compounds. Thiaprostaglandins are chemically and biologically stable analogs of naturally occurring prostaglandins therefore may be advantageous provided their biological activity is comparable which is yet to be explored.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
We claim :<br>
Novel 3-sulfanyl cyclic ketones having the general formula 3 of the drawing accompanying the specification wherein; A is methylene or ethylene, R may be hydrogen or methyl-7-heptanoate, R1 may be hydrogen, hydroxyl, ter-butyldimethylsilyloxy, triethysilyloxy, or trimethylsilyloxy; and R2 may be 2-hydroxyethylsulfanyl, 2-hydroxy-3-(4-chloro or methoxyphenyloxy)propylsulfanyl, 2-hydroxy-3-(1-naphthyloxy)propyl-sulfanyl or 2-hydroxy-3-(1-naphthyloy)propyl-sulfanyl or 2-hydroxy-3-(2-naphthyloxy) propylsulfanyl.<br>
