Preferred catalysts are tertiary amides, e.g. DMF and DMAC, or pyridines, e.g. pyridine or DMAP or mixtures thereof. More preferred catalysts are tertiarybenzamides, e.g. A/.AkJimethylbenzamide. Even more preferred catalysts are A/-alkyl lactams, e.g. Af-methylpyrrolidinone. Catalysis by iron salts and by tetraaikyiureas, e.g. tetramethylurea, is known in the art.<br><br>
The invention also relates to process for preparing a compound of fonnula C<br><br>
or a stereoisomer thereof, which comprises reacting an amine of the formula HNR6R7 with a compound of the formula<br><br><br>
wherein Rp is H or a protecting group.<br>
In an embodiment, the protecting group is tert-butyloxycarbonyl ("BOC"). In another embodiment, the process comprises combining CL" with a catalyst, e.g. HOBt, and a carbodiimide in a suitable solvent, and adding the amine HNR6R7. In a preferred embodiment, the carbodiimide is N.N"-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. In another preferred embodiment, the carbodiimide is EDC. In another preferred embodiment, the suitable solvent is dichlorom ethane. In a preferred embodiment, the mixture of C!, the amine HNR6Rr, HOBt and carbodiimide is stirred for about 30 minutes to 24 hours before further processing. In an embodiment, the further processing comprises an aqueous work-up to provide the compound of formula C. In a preferred embodiment, the amine HNR6R7 is A/-methylbenzylamine, i.e., R6 is methyl and Rr is benzyl. In another preferred embodiment, Rp is BOC and the amine is N-methylbenzylamine, and in a more preferred embodiment thereof, the resulting compound of formula C, (terf-butyl (A?S)-2-[benzyl(methyl)amino]-2-oxo-1-phenyIethylcarbamate^is treated with trifluorocaetic acid and triethylsilane in dichloromethane, followed by aqueous workup to yield (RS)-/V-benzyl-A/-methyl-2-phenylglycinarnide. In a particularly preferred embodiment, Rp is BOC and the amine is /V-methylbenzylamine, and in a more preferred embodiment thereof, the resulting optically enriched compound of formula C, (fen*-butyl (S)-2-[benzyl(methyl)amino]-2-oxo-1-phenylethylcarbamate), is treated with concentrated hydrochloric acid in propan-2-ol, followed by advantageous precipitation of (S)-N-benzyl-A/-methyl-2-phenylglycinamide hydrochloride monohydrate from mixtures of propan-2-ol and tert-butyl methyl ether, resulting in a useful increase in the degree of optical enrichment.<br>
A salt of the phenyiglycine amide may be prepared, e.g., by treating the amide, e.g., (RS)-A/-benzyl-A/-methyl-2-phenylglycinarnide, with di(o-toluoyl)-l_-tartaric acid in a suitable solvent, e.g. ethyl acetate, to provide the di(o-toluoyl)-L-tartrate) salt, e.g. (RS)-A/-benzyl-N-methyl-2-phenyIglycinamide. Tartrate salts of the phenyiglycine amides may be broken to provide the amide, which may be purified as its hydrochloride salt.<br>
In another embodiment, racemic compounds of the formula C may be resolved via the selective precipitation of one of the enatiomers as its salt with an optically enriched chiral acid, of which many examples are known in the art, from suitable solvents, e.g. methanol and ethanoi. Such optically enriched chiral acids may be naturally occuring or synthetic. The precipitated salts may be hydrates or solvates.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, RS)-A/-benzyl-A/-methyl-2-phenylglycinamide is treated<br>
4<br><br>
with di(o-toluoyl)-L-tartaric acid in methanol at 20°C. The precipitated salt is filtered and washed with methanol, then dried providing (S)-/V-benzy|-/V-methyI-2-phenylgIycinamide di(o-toluoyl)-L-tartrate with 92.7% d.e. (chiral HPLC). This material is reslurried in hot methanol, filtered, washed and dried to providing (S)-/V-benzyl-A/-methyl-2-phenyIglycinamide di(o-toluoyl)-L-tartrate with 99% d.e. (37% overall yield).<br>
The diastereomericly enriched salts formed as described in the previous embodiments may be broken to provide optically enriched free amines Q, e.g. (S)-yV-benzyl-/V-methyl-2-phenylglycinamide, which may be advantageously purified by crystallization as-is or by the formation of a salt with an achiral acid in the presence of suitable solvents, e.g. precipitation of (S)-/V-benzyl-/\/-methyl-2-phenylglycinarnide hydrochloride from mixtures of propan-2-ol and terf-butyl methyl ether.<br>
In another embodiment, a racemic compound of the formula C may be resolved via the selective recrystallization of its salt with an optically enriched chiral acid, e.g. (RS)-N-benzyl-/V-methyl-2~phenylglycinamide di(o-toluoyl)-L-tartrate prepared as described above, from a suitable solvent, to provide diastereomericly enriched salts, e.g. (S)-A/-benzyl-A/-methyl-2-phenylglycinamide di(o-toluoyl)-L-tartrate. Breakage of these salts delivers optically enriched free amines of the formula C, which may be advantageously isolated and used as the hydrochloride salt, e.g. (S)-N-benzyl-A/-methyl-2-phenylglycinamide hydrochloride.<br>
In another embodiment, where optically enriched compunds C are preferred, the unwanted enantiomer of the compound C may be recycled by racemization. In a more preferable embodiment, the racemization is applied to mother liquors from the resolutions described above by refluxing in the presence of a catalytic amount of a carbonyl compound, e.g. 2-chlorobenzaldehyde, thus allowing the isolation of second crops of diastereomerically enriched salts containing the desired enatiomer of compound C, e.g. (S)-/V-benzyl-A/-methyl-2-phenylglycinamide di(o-toluoyl)-L-tartrate with 92% d.e. in approximately 50% yield of the solute in the initial ethanolic mother liquors. In a still more preferred embodiment, the catalysed racemization is performed at a suitable temperature and concentration in-situ during the resoluton in a suitable solvent, prior to the isolation of the first crop of product; this "dynamic resolution" allows a first crop yield of product to be significantly greater than the 50% available by traditional salt resolutions. Dynamic resoultions are known in the art, but are considered far from trivial and highly substrate dependant.<br>
In still another embodiment of a process for preparing an opticaly enriched compound of formula C, a homochiral amino acid, e.g. (S)-L-2-phenylglycine, is converted to the corresponding /V-carboxyanhydride, e.g. (S)-4-phenyl-1,3-oxazolidine-2,5-dione, using methods well known in the art, which, may then be combined an amine, e.g. N-methylbenzylamine. The resulting mixture is then subjected to an aqueous work-up, providing the optically enriched aminoamide, e.g. (S)-N-benzyl-N-methyl-2-phenylglycinamide, which may be purified as-is or as a suitable salt.<br><br>
It is to be understood that the methods of preparing the compounds disclosed herein, including the compounds of formulas 1, ■ ■ - • their varied embodiments and synthetic precursors or intermediates are not limiting but only illustrative.<br>

The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt(s)", as used herein, unless otherwise indicated, includes salts of acidic or basic groups that may be present in the compounds of the invention. For example, pharmaceutically acceptable salts include sodium, calcium and potassium salts of carboxylic acid groups and hydrochloride salts of amino groups. Other pharmaceutically acceptable salts of amino groups are hydrobromide, sulfate, hydrogen sulfate, phosphate, hydrogen phosphate, dihydrogen phosphate, acetate, succinate, citrate, " tartrate, lactate, mandelate, methanesulfonate (mesylate) and p-toluenesulfonate (tosylate) salts. The preparation of such salts is described below.<br>
The compounds of the invention that are basic in nature are capable of forming a wide variety of salts with various inorganic and organic acids. The acids that may be used to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of such basic compounds of the invention are those that form non-toxic acid addition salts, i.e., salts containing pharmacologically acceptable anions, such as the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, nitrate, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid phosphate, isonicotinate, acetate, lactate, salicylate, citrate, acid citrate, tartrate, pantothenate, bitartrate, ascorbate, succinate, maleate, gentisinate, fumarate, gluconate, glucaronate, saccharate, formate, benzoate, glutamate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate and pamoate (i.e., 1,T-methylene-bis-(2-bydroxy-3-naphthoate)) salts.<br>
The compounds of the invention that are acidic in nature, are capable of forming base salts with various pharmacologically acceptable cations. Examples of such salts include the alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts and particularly, the sodium and potassium salts. This invention also encompasses pharmaceutical compositions containing, and methods of treating proliferative disorders or abnormal cell growth through administering, prodrugs of compounds of the invention. Compounds of the invention having free amino, amido, hydroxy or carboxylic groups can be converted into prodrugs. Prodrugs include compounds wherein an amino acid residue, or a polypeptide chain of two or more (e.g., two, three or four) amino acid residues is covalentiy joined through an amide or ester bond to a free amino, hydroxy or carboxylic acid group of compounds of the invention. The amino acid residues include but are not limited to the 20 naturally occurring amino acids commonly designated by three letter symbols and also includes 4-hydroxyproIine, hydroxyiysine, demosine, isodemosine, 3-methylhistidine, norvalin, beta-alanine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, citrulline homocysteine, homoserine, ornithine and methionine sulfone. Additional types of prodrugs are also<br><br>
encompassed. For instance, free carboxyl groups can be derivatized as amides or alkyl esters. Free hydroxy groups may be derivatized using groups including but not limited to hemisuccinates, phosphate esters, dimethyiaminoacetates, and<br>
phosphoryloxymethyloxycarbonyls, as outlined in Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, 1996, 19, 115. Carbamate prodrugs of hydroxy and amino groups are also included, as are carbonate prodrugs, sulfonate esters and sulfate esters of hydroxy groups. Derivatization of hydroxy groups as (acy!oxy)methyl and (acyioxy)ethyl ethers wherein the acyl group may be an alkyl ester, optionally substituted with groups including but not limited to ether, amine and carboxylic acid functionalities, or where the acyl group is an amino acid ester as described above, are also encompassed. Prodrugs of this type are described in J. Med. Chem. 1996, 39,10. Free amines can also be derivatized as amides, sulfonamides or phosphonamides. All of these prodrug moieties may incorporate groups including but not limited to ether, amine and carboxylic acid functionalities.<br>
In certain combination therapies with other lipid-lowering agents, such as those described hereinbelow, e.g., HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, HMG CoA synthetase inhibitors, ACAT inhibitors, squalene synthetase inhibitors, etc., a compound of the invention may further comprise a prodrug which comprises a compound of formula J. in a hydrolyzable linkage to another anti-cancer agent. Di-ester linkages, for example, are particularly useful for this purpose, i.e., the prodrug is in the form A1-C(0)0-L1-0(0)C-A2, wherein A1 and A2 are the two agents, L1 is a linker such as a methylene or other (CrC6) alkylene group (alone or further comprising a phenyl or benzyl group). The two agents may both be a compound of the invention, or one may be another agent useful for treating, e.g., obesity, as described herein. See, e.g., U.S. patent 4,342,772 - penicillins in di-ester linkages with p-lactamase inhibitors. Accordingly, a compound of the invention having an available carboxylic acid group provides just one convenient means of producing combination prodrugs of the compound of the invention, which are encompassed by this invention. Typically, the acidic conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, or enzymes localized in the cells thereof cause the hydrolysis of the prodrug, releasing both agents.<br>
Certain compounds of the invention have asymmetric centers and therefore exist in different enantiomeric forms. All optical isomers and stereoisomers of the compounds of the invention, and mixtures thereof, are considered to be within the scope of the invention. With respect to the compounds of the invention, this invention includes the use of a racemate, one or more enantiomeric forms, one or more diastereomeric forms, or mixtures thereof. Some of the compounds of the invention may also exist as tautomers, including, e.g., keto-enol tautomers. This invention relates to the use of all such tautomers and mixtures thereof.<br>
Furthermore, some compounds may exhibit polymorphism. It is to be understood that the present invention encompasses any and all racemic, optically-active, polymorphic and stereoisomer^ forms, or mixtures thereof, which form or forms possess properties useful in the treatment of the conditions noted hereinabove, it being well known in the art how to prepare optically-active forms (for example, by resolution of the racemic form by<br><br>

The compounds of formula J., 2 and 3 are most conveniently synthesized by employing procedures analogous to those known in the chemical arts for the production of similar compounds. Exemplary processes for the manufacture of compounds of formula 1 2 and 3 as defined in detail hereinabove are provided as further features of the invention and are illustrated by the following procedures in which the meanings of generic radicals are as previously defined unless otherwise qualified.

In the following Schemes, unless otherwise indicated, substituents R1 - R1S, Ra - Rc, L, X, Z1 and Z2 are as defined above.<br>
The compounds of formulas I, 2 and 3 are generally prepared by forming amide linkages between the groups A, B and Q shown in Table 1 below, wherein in compounds of formula 1, B is BJ.; in compounds of formula 2, B is B2; and in compounds of formula 3, B is B3: wherein Lc is a carboxylic acid or an activated form thereof as described further below, and the amide linkages are formed between the Lc group of A and the amino group -NHR9, and between the Lc group of B and the amine -NHR5 of C, respectively It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that there are many well-known methods of forming amide linkages, and that it is generally not important which amide linkage is formed first.   Also, it will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the groups A, B and C are either commercially available or can readily be prepared using materials and methods which are well-known in the art, as well as by the methods and procedures described herein.   For example, compounds comprising the group A wherein X is C(RC) and R10 is phenyl are commercially available, e.g., 2-biphenylcarboxylic  acid,  4"-(methyl)-2-biphenyIcarboxylic  acid  and  4"-(trifluoromethyl)-2-biphenylcarboxylic acid.

bipyridyl (X is N and R10 is pyridyi) compounds are also readily obtained.   Compounds of group B are readily formed from commercially available indoles (Bl, B2), benzofbjfurans (B3) or benzofblthiophenes (B3), as well as by the methods and procedures described herein. Compounds of group C are readily prepared from commercially available phenyl glycines, wherein the carbamoyl moiety C(0)NR6R7 is formed between the carboxylic acid group of the phenylglycine and the amine NRBR7.  Exemplary procedures for forming each of these groups and the amide linkages between them are provided in detail below. The Schemes which follow provide examples of various methods of forming the compounds of formulas 1, 2 and 3 using the synthetic precursors discussed above.<br><br><br><br>

Scheme 2<br><br><br>
B1<br><br><br>
AB1-e<br><br><br>
AB1 ;<br><br>
Scheme 1 illustrates a method for preparing a compound .of formula I which comprises reacting a compound of the formula AB1, with an amine of the formula C, or, by reacting a compound of the formula A with an amine of the formula B1C. where Lc is a carboxylic acid, preferably, an activated carboxyiic acid. In both cases, a compound of formula 1 is prepared by the formation of an amide linkage.<br>
Activated carboxylic acids of the compound of formula A and AB1 are readily formed by conventional means, for example, wherein -Lc is -COOH, by reacting the free acid with a carbodiimide, e.g., 1-(3-dimethylamjnopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride ("EDC) or 1,1"-carbonyldiimidazole ("CDI").   EDC, if used, may advantageously be polymer-bound, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,416,193.  Preferably, the amide linkage reaction is earned out in the presence of a suitable base. An example of a suitable base for use in the coupling reaction  is a polymer bound  amine,   such   as  polymer bound  morpholino-polystyrene. Preferably, the reaction is carried out in the presence of an alcohol e.g., a C1-C4 alcohol such as  methanol,  ethanol,  propanol,  isopropanol,  n-butanol or t-butanol. Alternatively,  the carboxylic acid may be activated by conversion to its corresponding acid chloride by e.g., treatment with oxalyl chloride in methylene chloride in the presence of a catalytic amount of DMF. Compounds A, C, AB1 and B1C. and their synthetic precursors and intermediates are each readily prepared using well-known methods for the formation of amide linkages, and also by the methods disclosed herein.<br>
Another example of a method for forming the amide linkage between AB1 and C, from the compound AB1 where Lc is a carboxylic acid, is by combining AB1. C, and PyBroP (about 1 eq) in methylene chloride, followed by the addition of diisopropylethylamine (2-3 eq) and stirring at room temperature from about 30 minutes to 24 hours. The solvent may be evaporated and the product purified by TLC or flash chromatography using ethyl acetate / hexane as the eluting solvent.<br>
Still another example of a method for forming the amide linkage between AB1 and £, where Lc is a carboxylic acid, is to first combine the acid (AB1) with N.O-dimethyl hydroxylamine hydrochloride salt and PyBroP in methylene chloride followed by addition of diisopropylethylamine and stirring for several hours. The resulting N.O-dimethyl hydroxyamide of the acid is purified by flash chromatography and then treated with DIBAL in THF to yield the corresponding aldehyde (i.e., Lc is C(O)H). The AB1 aldehyde is then suspended in methylene chloride with C and acetic acid, and after stirring for about 30 minutes, NaB(OAc)3H and chloroform are added and the compound of formula 1 purified from the organic layer, e.g., by flash chromatography using rnethanol/chloroform.<br>
The method illustrated in Scheme 1 comprising reacting a compound of the formula A with an amine of the formula B1C is advantageous in the utilization of a library of A groups, i.e., phenyl or pyridyl carboxylic acids as in Scheme 1, or other carboxylic acids.  In this case,<br>
a compound of formula 1, ,	,	-may be formed between a compound of the<br>
formula B1C and a A group or other carboxyiic acid, by reacting A or the other acid with a<br><br>
mixture comprising B1C, EDC and DMAP in methylene chloride, preferably at room temperature, followed by addition of N,N-dimethylethylenediarnine, and subsequent purification of the compound of formula 1..<br>
Scheme 2 illustrates a method of preparing compounds of formula AB1.  In Scheme 2, a compound of formula A is reacted with a 5-amino- or 6-amino- indole of formula B_X, wherein Le is a carboxylic acid ester to form the compound AB1-e, followed by hydrolysis of Le to form the compound AB, bearing a carboxylic acid group Lc, which as described above may be used in the method of Scheme 1 directly or in the form of an activated acid. The group Le may advantageously be -COORd, wherein Rd is a (CrC6) alkyl group or a substituted variation thereon; preferably Rd is methyl or ethyl, more preferably ethyl. Where ~LC is e.g., -COCI, i.e., an acid chloride, the reaction between A and B_l may be carried out in methylene chloride and pyridine or, in a preferred embodiment, as described in Example 44.    AB1-e may be hydrolysed (or otherwise deprotected) to form AB1 by any conventional means, e.g., by addition of aqueous LiOH to a solution of the compound in THF and methanol, or, in a preferred embodiment, as described in Example 44, wherein the compound AB1   has advantageous filtration properties, for example where Lc is -COOH and acidification is performed at elevated temperature, and preferably where Lc is -COO~K+ crystallizing as a 2.5 mole hydrate.<br>
Still another embodiment of a process for making a compound of the formula 1 wherein R10 is of the formula -OR17 is shown in Scheme 3.- In this process, an amide linkage is formed between A"B1 and C, wherein A| is analogous to the group R1 except that R10 is, e.g., acetyl or a thioester as exemplified by a compound such as acetylsalicoylchloride. In this process, a compound of the formula A"B1 is formed analogously to the process shown in Scheme 2, by adding to a mixture comprising about 1 equivalent of B^ (ester form, i.e. having "Le" at the 2-position) and diisopropylethylamine (2 eq) in methylene chloride, about one equivalent of A), followed by hydrolysis of the ester group Le of A"B1 to produce a carboxylic acid group Lc and (preferably as part of the same step) hydrolysis of the acetyl group of A[ to form an alcohol. The alcohol/acid A"B1 is then reacted with C as described above, in the presence of PyBroP to produce a hydroxy-substituted compound A"B1C whose hydroxyl group may then be converted to OR17 by reaction with an alcohol R17OH.<br>
Compounds of formula A are well-known, and are readily obtained commercially or prepared from commercially available biphenyl, bipyridyl or phenyl-pyridyl compounds substituted with at least a carboxylic acid group or having at least one substituent susceptible to derivatization to a carboxylic acid group. Examples of suitable groups A and methods for preparing them may be found in, for example, U.S. Patent No. 6,121,283, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. A particularly preferred group of formula A is 4"-(trif]uoromethyl)-2-biphenylcarboxyiic acid, which is commercially available; other A groups are commercially available or readily prepared from commercially available analogues by means which are well-known in the art.<br><br>
Compounds of formula B_l are readily prepared from well-known or commercially available indoles, e.g., 5-nitro or 6-nitro-indole-2-carboxylic acid ethyl ester ("the indole ester"). To prepare a group EM wherein R4 is alkyl or alkoxyalkyl, the indole ester in a suitable solvent, e.g., DMF, may be treated with about one equivalent of sodium hydride, followed by addition of a slight molar excess of alkyl iodide or alkoxyalkyl iodide, e.g., methyl iodide, iodomethy! methyl ether, ethyl iodide, 2-iodopropane, etc., followed by quenching with acid, e.g., HCI, and suitable isolation to yield the alkyl or alkoxyalkyl indole ester. Alternatively the alkylating agent may be an alkyl sulfonate ester, e.g.  methyl tosylate, and the base may be a inorganic salt, e.g. potassium carbonate, and the product provided by an appropriate isolation, such as described in Example 44. In yet another embodiment, a group Bl wherein R4 is akyl or alkoxyalkyl and Lc = R4, may be prepared by exposing commercially available 5-nitro or 6-nitro-indole-2-carboxylic acid to analogous conditions with adjusted stoichiometry.<br>
Independently, or after alkylation of the indole ester, a compound Bl, wherein R3 is halogen, i.e., chloro, bromo or iodo, may be prepared by treating the indole ester with a N-halosuccinimide in a suitable solvent, e.g., THF, followed by neutralization and isolation.<br>
After halogenation and/or alkylation (or alkoxyalkylation) the 5-nitro or 6-nitro group of any of the resulting indole esters (i.e., R3 is H or halo and R4 is independently H, alkyl or alkoxyalkyl) may then be reduced, e.g., with hydrazine hydrate and Raney Nickel in a suitable solvent, e.g., methanol to yield the 5-amino- or 6-amino- indole ester. Alternatively, the nitro group may be hydrogenated catalytically over palladium based catalysts, e.g. palladium on carbon. Alternatively, the nitro group may be hydrogenated catalytically over palladium based catalysts. Alternatively, the nitro group may be subjected to catalytic transfer hydrogenation using palladium based catalysts and a non-gasseous hydrogen source, e.g., a salt of an amine with formic acid such as ammonium fomate, followed by an appropriate isolation, such as described in Example 44. The 5-amino- or 6-arnino- indole esters Bl may advantageously be isolated as their salts with strong acids, e.g. hydrochloric acid. Alternatively the 5-amino or 6-amino-indole esters may be retained in solution for use directly in the following synthetic step.<br>
The 5-amino- or 6-amino- indole ester may then be reacted with a compound of formula A as in Scheme 2 to form the compound AB1-e. wherein R9 is hydrogen. The amide nitrogen of AB1-e , is optionally alkylated, e.g., free radical methylation is used to produce R9 = methyl, preferably before hydrolysis of the carboxylic acid ester to the corresponding 2-carboxylic acid or activated acid form of the compound of formula BJ. used as in Scheme 1.<br>
Compounds of formula B_2 are readily prepared from well-known or commercially available indoles, e.g., 5-nitro or B-nitro-indole-1 -acetic acid. Compounds of formula Z are then readily prepared by forming amide linkages between A^ B2 and C using the processes described above for linking B1 to A (or A") and C.<br>
Compounds of formula ,B3 are also readily prepared from well-known or commercially. available indoles, e.g., 5-nitro or 6-nitro-benzofuran-2-carboxyIic acid.    The acid is first<br><br>
esterified, and then the nitro group is reduced to an amine, both using conventional means as described herein, and the amide linkages between A, B3 and C to form a compound of formula 1_b are readily formed using the processes described herein for linking Bl to A (or /V) andC.<br>
Compounds of formula C are readily prepared by methods analogous to those described above, by forming an amide linkage between a phenyl-glycine amino acid analogue, e.g.,<br><br>
k<br>
and an amine of the formula HNR6R7, wherein Rp is H or a protecting group, such as tert-butyloxycarbonyl ("BOC"), Various embodiments of processes for preparing a compound of formula C have been described above, and illustrative examples are provided below.<br>
One example of a process for preparing a compound of formula C, where, e.g., R7 is benzyl and R8 is methyl, involves combining commercially available (S)-/V-tert-butoxycarbonyi-2-phenylglycine, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate and A/,/v"-dicyclohexylcarbodimide in dichloromethane, and after mixing, adding slowly, with stirring, A/-methylbenzylamine in dichloromethane, all at 0-5°C. The resulting slurry is allowed to warm to room temperature overnight before being filtered and the solids washed with dichloromethane. The combined filtrate is preferably subjected to further washes with aqueous weak base and then with aqueous weak acid, and finally washed with water, providing a dichloromethane solution of a phenylglycine acid amide, where the phenylglycine amino group (See Table 1, NHR5 of C) is t-butoxycarbonyl-protected. After purification, the phenylglycine amide is deprotected, e.g., by addition of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and the monohydrate crystalline form of the product precipitated by the addition of terf-butyl methyl ether and seeding, followed by washing with ferf-butyl methyl ether and drying to yield the product C with higher optical purity than its /V-protected precursor. The preferred solid form of the product C is characterized by the XRD (X-ray diffraction) data shown in Table 12, as described below.<br>
Table 12 shows 2-theta values for a simulated X-ray powder diffraction pattern the intermediate compound (S)-A/-benzyI-/V-methyl-2-phenylglycinamide hydrochloride monohydrate described in Example 44 step (e). The data was simulated using primary data obtained by single crystal X-ray diffraction.<br>

In another example of a process for preparing a compound of formula C, where R is methyl and Rr is benzyl, (RS)-/v-tert-butoxycarbonyl-2-phenyiglycine, commercially available or prepared from (f?S)-2-phenylglycine using methods well known in the art, is combined with 1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate, commercially available N-methylbenzylamjne and N-[3-{dimethylamino)propyl-A/"-ethylcarbodimide hydrochloride in dichioromethane and the resulting mixture stirred for about 24 hours. The resulting mixture is subjected to an aqueous work-up similar to that described above, providing (tert-butyl (/?S)-2-[benzyl(methyl)amino]-2-oxo-1-phenylethylcarbamate, which may be treated with trifluorocaetic acid and triethylsilane in dichioromethane, followed by aqueous workup to yield (RS)-/V-benzyl-A/-methyl-2-phenylglycinamide.<br>
A salt of the phenylglycine amide may be prepared, e.g., by treating the amide, e.g., ((/?S)-/V-benzyl-N-methyl-2-phenyIglycinarnide), with di(o-toluoyl)-L-tartaric acid in a suitable solvent to provide the di(o-toluoyl)-L-tartrate) salt. Tartrate salts of the phenylglycine amides may be broken to provide the amide, which may be purified as its hydrochloride salt.<br>
In still another embodiment of a process for preparing a compound of formula C, commercially available (f?S)-DL-2-phenylglycine is converted to (RS)-4-phenyI-1,3-oxazolidine-2,5-dione using methods well known in the art, which, analogous to the above examples, is then combined with commercially available N-methylbenzylamine. The resulting mixture is then subjected to an aqueous work-up, providing the phenylglycinamide, which may be purified as its hydrochloride salt as described.<br>
In another embodiment, racemic compounds of the formula C may be resolved via the selective precipitation of one of the enantiomers as its salt with an optically enriched chiral acid, of which many examples are known in the art, from suitable solvents, e.g. methanol and ethanol. Such optically enriched chiral acids may be naturally occuring or synthetic. The precipitated salts may be hydrates or solvates. Breakage of these salts delivers optically enriched free amines of the formula C, which may be purified as-is or as a suitable salts using suitable solvents.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, (RS)-/V-ben2yl-A/-methyl-2-phenylglycinamide (10.0g) was treated with di(o*toluoyl)-L-tartaric acid (15.2g) in methanol (167mL) at 20°C. The precipitated the salt was filtered and washed with methanol, then dried providing (S)-A/-benzyl-/V-methy!-2-ahenylglycinamide di(o-toluoyl)-L-tartrate (11.73g, 46.6%) with 92.7%d.e. (chiral HPLC). This naterial (1.00g) was reslurried in hot methanol (8.8ml) to provide (S)-/V-benzyI-/V-methyl-2-<br><br>
phenylglycinamide di(o-toluoyl)-L-tartrate with 99% d.e. (0.79g, 79% recovery) after filtration, washing and drying. The tartrate salts formed as described maybe broken to provide the free amine of formula C, i.e. (S)-/V-benzyl-/V-methyJ-2-phenyJglycJnamide, which maybe advantageously purified by the formation of a salt with an achiral acid in the presence of appropriate solvents, e.g. precipitation of (S)-A/-benzyl-A/-methyl-2-phenylglycinarnide hydrochloride from mixtures of propan-2-ol and terf-butyl methyl ether as described.<br>
In another embodiment, a racemic compound of the formula C may be resolved via the selective recrystallization, from a suitable solvent, of its salt with an optically enriched chiral acid, e.g. (f?S)-/V-benzyl-W-methyl-2-phenylglycinamide di(o-toluoyl)-L-tartrate prepared as described above, to provide diastereomericly enriched salts, e.g. (S)-/V-benzyl-/V-methyl-2-phenylglycinamide di(o-toluoyl)-L-tartrate. Breakage of these salts delivers optically enriched free amines of the formula C, which may be advantageoulsy isolated and used as the hydrochloride salt, e.g. (S)-W-benzyl-A/-methyI-2~phenylglycinamide hydrochloride as described.;<br>
In another embodiment, where optically enriched compunds C are preferrable, the unwanted enantiomer of the compound C may be recycled by racemization. In a more preferred embodiment, the racemization is applied to mother liquors from the resolutions described in the preceding embodiments, by (a) optionally changing the nature of the solvent and (b) refluxing in the presence of a catalytic amount of a carbonyl compound, e.g. 2-chlorobenzaldehyde, thus allowing the isolation of second crops of diastereomericly enriched salts containing the desired enantiomer of compound C, e.g. (S)-/V-benzyl-N-methyl-2-phenylglycinamide di(o-toluoyI)-L-tartrate with 92% d.e. in approximately 50% yield of the solute in the initial ethanolic mother liquors. In an even more preferred embodiment, the catalysed racemization is performed at a suitable temperature and concentration in-situ during the resoluton in a suitable solvent, prior to the isolation of the first crop of product; this "dynamic resolution" allows a first crop yield of product to be significantly greater than the 50% available by traditional salt resolutions. Dynamic resoultions are known in the art, but suitable conditions are generally highly substrate-dependent.<br>
In still another embodiment of a process for preparing an opticaly enriched compound of formula C, commercially available homochiral (S)-L-2-phenylglycine is converted to (S)-4~ phenyl-1,3-oxazolidine-2,5-dione using methods well known in the art, which, may then be combined with commercially available /V-methylbenzylamine. The resulting mixture is then subjected to an aqueous work-up, providing the phenylglycinamide, e.g. (SyN-benzyl-N-methyl-2-phenyiglycinamide with 43% e.e. in 49% yield, which may be purified as its hydrochloride salt as described, or di(o-toluoyI)rL-tartrate salt.<br>
Biological Assays<br>
The selectivity of the apo B secretion/MTP inhibitors was determined by the following protocols.<br><br>
Inhibition of fat absorption<br>
Healthy female CF1 mice (Charles River) weighing 18-20 grams upon arrival are employed as test subjects. The mice are housed in groups of 10 in standard caging, and are allowed to acclimate for one week prior to testing. Mice are fasted overnight in a separate procedure room prior to testing. Each treatment group typically consists of 5 mice.<br>
The test compound is preferably provided as a powder in a glass vial. The dosing solution (6.10ml/25g body weight) administered by oral gavage consists of an emulsion of Miglyol 812 (20%), Cremaphor (5%), Water (75%). An appropriate volume of Miglyol is first added to the test compound, and the vial vortexed for approximately 1 minute. Next, the appropriate volume of Cremaphor is added, and the vial again vortexed as previously. The appropriate volume of water is then added, and the emulsion formed by vortexing and briefly sonicating.<br>
Hamster liquid diet (Bioserve F0739) (dose volume 0.5ml/25g body weight) is prepared by adding (for every 10 mL needed) 2.5 grams liquid diet powder, 10 mL water and 5 microcuries giycerol-3H-trioleate (Amersham TRA191) to a laboratory blender. The mixture is then blended at high speed for approximately 1 minute. The liquid diet is stored at 4°C until use.<br>
Sample tubes are weighed (Falcon 15ml polypropylene conical). Three milliliters of 2.5N KOH is then added to each tube.<br>
Following overnight fasting, each mouse is dosed (see above volumes) with test compound followed immediately by liquid diet. Positive (a known potent MTP inhibitor) and negative control groups (vehicle) are included in each assay. One scintillation vial is sham dosed every 30 mice in order to determine the activity of the initial bolus.<br>
At two hours post dose the mice are euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation, the abdominal cavity opened, and the small intestines removed and placed in the KOH conical ;ube. Each tube is then weighed.<br>
Tubes containing intestines are then placed in a 75°C water bath for 1.5-2 hours. Following saponification, the tubes are vortexed and 200uL saponate placed in a 20mL liquid scintillation vial. Samples are decolorized (for 30 minutes) by adding 200jiL of 30% (w/w) hydrogen peroxide. Each sample is neutralized by the addition of 200pL of 3N HCL. Ten milliliters of Ready Safe® (Beckman) liquid scintillation fluid are added and the samples were counted on a Beckman Coulter LS 6500 scintillation system. The calculations are carried out as follows:<br>
-	weight of saponate = weight of tube (KOH + intestine) - weight of empty tube<br>
-	saponate fraction = 0.22/ saponate weight (density of the saponate = 1.1 g/mL; therefore the weight of the aliquot is equal to 0.22g)<br>
total DPM for the entire intestine = DPM of sample/saponate fraction<br>
-	The initial bolus DPM is calculated by averaging the counts from the sham dosed<br><br>
scintillation vials.<br>
The fraction of bolus recovered from the intestine (percent recovery) = total DPM/ bolus count.<br>
Percent recovery from each test group = average of percent recovery from each<br>
5	mouse.<br>
Interpretation of results:<br>
To compare efficacy of test compounds, an ED2s for intestinal fat absorption is calculated. The (average) percent triglyceride recovery (percent unabsorbed and remaining in the intestine) of the vehicle control group is adjusted to equal 0%, and the (average) percent recovery of the compound control group is adjusted to equal 100%. The same calculations are applied to the percent recovery values obtained for test compounds and an adjusted percent recovery is obtained (% recovery of the test sample - % recovery of vehicle control group / (% recovery of positive control group - % recovery of vehicle control group)). An ED25 is then calculated by plotting a graph of compound concentration vs. adjusted percent recovery.<br>
Serum triglyceride lowering<br>
Healthy female CF1 mice (Charles River) weighing 18-20 grams upon arrival are employed as test subjects. The mice are housed in groups of 10 in standard caging, and were allowed to acclimate for one week prior to testing. Mice are fasted overnight in a separate procedure room prior to testing. Each treatment group typically consists of 10 mice.<br>
The test compound is preferably provided as a powder in a glass vial. The dosing solution (0.250ml/25g body weight) administered by oral gavage consists of an emulsion of Miglyol 812 (40%), Cremaphor (10%), Water (50%), An appropriate volume of Miglyol is first added to the test compound, and the vial vortexed for approximately 1 minute. Next, the appropriate volume of Cremaphor is added, and the vial again vortexed as previously. The appropriate volume of water is then added and the emulsion formed by vortexing and briefly sonicating..<br>
Following overnight fasting, each mouse is dosed (see above volumes) with test compound. At 1hour post dose the mice are euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation and blood collected for triglyceride quantitation.<br>
Serum triglyceride values are quantitated using a colorimetric endpoint assay (Wako Triglyceride E kit # 432-4021) on a Spectra Max 250 plate reader with Softmax Pro software. All samples are run in duplicate.<br>
For comparison of triglyceride values, the percent change from control is calculated. The average triglyceride value of the test compound group is divided by the average triglyceride value of the vehicle group, multiplied by 100 and then subtracted from 100%. The ED25 value is then calculated by plotting a graph of compound concentration versus percent change from control.<br><br>
The relative values of the ED25 for triglyceride lowering and the ED25 for inhibition of intestinal fat absorption are used as a means to compare selectivity of the test compounds.<br>

Scriven et al„ J.C.S., P.T.1, (1979) p.53-59). For example, methylation may be achieved using any compatible combination of electrophilic methylating agent, i.e., H3C-LG, where LG is a leaving group, and a base, e.g., using dimethylsuifale, methyl iodide (Example 45, step (a)) or methyl tosylate, with bases such as sodium hydride, potassium t-butoxide or potassium carbonate. Preferably, methyl tosylate and potassium carbonate are used as follows:<br>
To a refiuxing mixture of commercially available ethyl 5-nitro-1/-/-indole-2-carboxylate (420g) and potassium carbonate (272.6g) in acetonitrile (3360 mL) was added a solution of methyl p-to!uenesulfonate (367.3g) in acetonitrile (630 mL), and the resulting mixture refluxed for 18 hours. The mixture was then cooled to 20°C over 3 hours and water (4200 mL) added over a 3 hour period. The product was granulated, filtered, washed with a 50/50 mixture of demineralized water and acetonitrile (630 mL), demineralized water (420 mL) and then with<br><br>
