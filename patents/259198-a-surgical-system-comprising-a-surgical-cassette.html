				<td>SURGICAL SYSTEM HAVING A<br>
NON-INVASIVE FLOW SENSOR<br>
This application is a continuatiori-in-part of U.S. Patent Application Serial No.<br>
11/391,748, filed March 29, 2006, currently co-pending.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an ultrasonic flow sensor and more particularly to a<br>
surgical system and cassette having an ultrasonic flow sensor.<br>
Conventional ophthalmic surgical instrument systems use vacuum to aspirate the surgical<br>
site and positive pressure to irrigate the site. Typically, a cassette is serially connected between<br>
the means used to generate pressure and the surgical instrument. The use of cassettes with<br>
surgical instruments to help manage irrigation and aspiration flows at a surgical site is well<br>
known. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,493,695 and 4,627,833 (Cook), 4,395,258 (Wang, et al.), 4,713,051<br>
(Steppe, et al.), 4,798,850 peMeo, et al.), 4,758,238,4,790,816 (Sundblom, et al.), and<br>
5,267,956, 5,364,342 (Beuchat) and 5,747,824 (Jung, et al.) all disclose ophthalmic surgical<br>
cassettes with or without tubes, and they are incorporated in their entirety by this reference.<br>
Aspiration fluid flow rate, pump speed, vacuum level, irrigation fluid pressure, and irrigation<br>
fluid flow rate are some of the parameters that require precise control during ophthalmic surgery.<br>
Prior art devices have used pressure sensors in the aspiration and irrigation lines and<br>
calculate fluid flow rates based on the sensed pressure. In the past, measuring of fluid pressures<br>
in surgical cassettes has been very precise and as the resistance in the fluid paths is known, fluid<br>
flow rates can be calculated reliably from fluid pressure. Recent improvements in the reliability<br>
of ultrasonic flow sensors, however, have now made it possible to non-invasively measure fluid<br>
flow accurately.<br>
For example, one ultrasonic flow sensor disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,098,466<br>
(Shkarlet) discloses a flow sensor capable of accurately measuring fluid flow in vessels or tubes<br>
having decreased sensitivity to flow distribution non-uniformities and decreased overall size by<br>
employing multiple angled reflector surfaces which cause incident ultrasonic waves from one or<br>
more ultrasonic transducers to pass through the flow volume multiple times and in multiple<br>
directions without changing the planar orientation of the ultrasound waves. The wave paths<br>
resulting from the multiple reflections and multidirectional illumination of the flow volume<br>
decreases the probe's size and sensitivity to spatial distribution non-uniformities. The multiple<br>
angled reflector surfaces also permit the transmitting and receiving ultrasonic transducers to be<br>
placed close to one another, thereby reducing the overall probe size and making them<br>
particularly useful for incorporation in the relatively small fluid flow cassette used in ophthalmic<br>
surgery. In order for an ultrasonic flow sensor to work, the transducer must be acoustically<br>
coupled to the tubing in which the fluid is flowing so that any air located between the transducer<br>
and the tubing is removed. This acoustic coupling is sensitive to the amount of pressure<br>
between the transducer and the flow channel being monitored, making a fairly constant force<br>
desirable. When the flow channel is mounted on a removable surgical cassette and the<br>
transducer located in a surgical console on which the cassette connects, normal manufacturing<br>
variation can result in undesirable variation in the amount offeree pressing the cassette into the<br>
transducer, thereby causing inaccuracies in the flow measurement.<br>
Accordingly, a need continues to exist for a device for assuring a fairly constant force<br>
between a flow channel located on a surgical cassette and an ultrasonic flow measuring<br>
transducer located on a surgical console.<br>
Brief Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention improves upon the prior art by providing a surgical system having<br>
a console that receives a cassette with a rigid fluid channel formed into a rigid plastic component<br>
or housing. The housing serves as a substrate for an elastomeric acoustic coupling that can be<br>
formed on the housing outside of the fluid channel. The acoustic transducer is elastically<br>
mounted within the console, such as on a spring, so as to provide a relatively constant force<br>
between the transducer and the acoustic coupling when the cassette is installed in the console.<br>
Accordingly, one objective of the present invention is to provide a surgical cassette<br>
having an acoustic coupling.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a surgical cassette having an<br>
acoustic coupling that is formed on the cassette without the use of adhesives.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a surgical system with a<br>
cassette having an acoustic coupling that is over molded onto the cassette.<br>
These and other advantages and objectives of the present invention will become apparent<br>
from the detailed description, drawings and claims that follow.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
As best seen in FIGS. 1, 2 and 3, cassette 10 of the present invention generally included<br>
valve plate 12, body 14 and cover 16. Valve plate 12, body 14 and cover 16 may all be formed<br>
of a suitable, relatively rigid, thermoplastic. Valve plate 12 contains a plurality of openings <br>
and pumping channel 20 that are sealed fluid tight by elastomers 22 and 24, forming a plurality<br>
of fluid paths. Ports 26 provide connectors between cassette 10 and surgical console 100 for the<br>
various irrigation and aspiration functions of cassette 10, such functions may requiring the use of<br>
filter 28. Attached to body 14 are ultrasound reflector 30 and reflector cover 32. Acoustic<br>
reflector 30 and reflector cover 32 may be molded as one piece and are located on body 14 to<br>
align with transmission window 125 in recess 36 along fluid passage 34 formed in valve plate 12<br>
when valve plate 12 is assembled onto body 14 in the manner shown in FIG. 3. Located within<br>
recess 36 on valve plate 12 is elastomeric acoustic coupler 38. Recess 36 is located adjacent to<br>
fluid passage 34 in valve plate 12 and aligned with acoustic reflector 30 and reflector cover <br>
when valve plate 12 is assembled on body 14. When cassette 10 is installed in cassette receiving<br>
portion 110 of console 100, ultrasound transducer 120 presses against elastomeric acoustic<br>
coupler 38, providing an acoustic coupling between transducer 120 and fluid passage 34, thus<br>
allowing the use of ultrasound transducer 120 to measure the fluid flow rate in fluid passage  Elastomeric acoustic coupler 38 preferably is formed by over molding an elastomeric material,<br>
such as a thermoplastic elastomer or silicone rubber within recess 36 of valve plate 12. Such a<br>
construction method eliminates the need for adhesives to attach elastomeric acoustic coupler 38<br>
to valve plate 12 and ensures the removal of any air from between elastomeric acoustic coupler<br>
38 and valve plate 12.<br>
As best seen in FIG. 6, transducer 120 is mounted within cassette receiving portion 110<br>
of console 100 so as to press against coupler 38 when cassette 10 is installed within cassette<br>
receiving portion 110. In order to ensure a relatively uniform compressive force by transducer<br>
120 against coupler 38, transducer 120 is mounted within cassette receiving portion 110 on<br>
elastic mounting 130, such as spring 131. Mounting 130 preferably has a fairly low spring rate<br>
and is compressed through a fairly large deflection, resulting in a force versus position curve<br>
having a fairly flat slope.<br>
One skilled in the art will recognize that the description given above is only a schematical<br>
illustration of the device of the present invention. For example, instead of spring 131, other<br>
similar devices, such as a low friction air cylinder, a solenoid, a motor or an elastomer molded to<br>
act like a spring may also be used.<br>
As best seen in FIGS. 7 and 8, transducer 120 may be mounted on carriage 200. Carriage<br>
200 generally includes carrier 210 mounted to bracket 220. Spring 131 rides on shaft 230 and<br>
contains bushings 240 and 250. The construction of carriage 200 is such that transducer 120 can<br>
slide within carrier 210 by compressing spring 131. As best seen in FIG. 8, bracket 220 can be<br>
mounted to active deployment mechanism 260, such as an air cylinder, solenoid or electric<br>
motor, which moves carriage 200 back and forth along the same axis of movement as transducer<br>
120. Active deployment mechanism 260 allows transducer 120 to be retracted within cassette<br>
receiving portion 110 when not in use. Retracting transducer 120 helps to prevent damage to<br>
transducer 120, which contains delicate crystals that can be damaged easily.<br>
This description is given for purposes of illustration and explanation. It will be apparent<br>
to those skilled in the relevant art that modifications may be made to the invention as herein<br>
described without departing from its scope or spirit.<br><br>
