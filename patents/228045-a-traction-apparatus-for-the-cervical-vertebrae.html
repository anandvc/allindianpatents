				<td>ATRACTION APPARATUS FOR THE CERVICAL VERTEBRAE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a traction apparatus for a cervical vertebrae<br>
adapted to stretch a.patient's cervical vertebrae, thereby allowing him or her to perform<br>
a stretching exercise,<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The vertebral column of a human skeletal frame, often called a spinal column,<br>
is formed of a series of bones called the vertebrae. The vertebrae is a flexible column.<br>
The head is balanced on top of the column. The skeletal framework of the neck<br>
consists of seven cervical vertebrae. The cervical vertebrae has an anatomical<br>
structure unlike that of the lumbar vertebrae and thoracic vertebrae, and provides<br>
versatile movement for rotation (twisting), flexion and extension.<br>
The cervical vertebrae positioned at the back of the neck region have smaller<br>
bones than those of the back and waist, and have a broader moving region than that of<br>
the waist. The cervical vertebrae is also exposed to frequent movement, such that<br>
they are easily affected by shocks compared with the waist, thus causing frequent pain<br>
thereto.<br>
One therapeutic treatment for treating pain caused in the cervical vertebrae is a<br>
traction apparatus. Generally, there are four types of traction apparatus for<br><br>
performing the traction of cervical vertebrae.<br>
The first type is a fixed traction apparatus for pushing the neck region to a<br>
prescribed level, including the chin, rear part of the neck and shoulder region, via a<br>
screw and fixing same. The second type is a power-driven traction apparatus for<br>
pulling the chin and rear part of the neck by using a motor while a patient's body is<br>
fixed on a bed. The third type is a pneumatic traction apparatus for wrapping the<br>
neck region, including the chin and rear part of the neck by an air tube and expanding<br>
the air tube in the longitudinal direction of the neck by using a pump to push up and<br>
stretch the cervical vertebrae. The fourth type is a traction apparatus for fixing the<br>
chin and rear part of the neck and hanging the fixed chin and the rear part of the neck<br>
on a horizontal bar to elongate the cervical vertebrae by the patient's weight.<br>
However, there is a serious drawback in the conventional traction apparatus<br>
thus described in that a disorder known as Temporomandibular Disorder (TMD),<br>
referring to a collection of medical and dental conditions affecting the<br>
Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ), may occur because these conventional traction<br>
apparatus serve to lift or pull the jaw and back part of the neck at the same time for<br>
traction of the cervical vertebrae, and because the cervical vertebrae are positioned at<br>
the back of the neck, a strong force can be applied to the jaw when the jaw and the<br>
back of the neck are pulled altogether.<br>
For reference, TMJ is a joint located in front of an ear to connect the skull and<br>
the maxillary bone, and is connected with muscles related with a mouth opening,<br><br>
closing movements and mastication. TMD can occur when the maxillary bone, TMJ<br>
and muscles are not properly positioned and cannot move in harmony, and TMD can<br>
easily occur when an excessive shock or pressure is applied to the jaw.<br>
There is another drawback in the conventional traction apparatus of<br>
simultaneously pushing or pulling the chin and the back part of the neck in that the<br>
elongated distance of the cervical vertebrae is short and an exercise of pulling<br>
epiglottis covering the first and second cervical vertebrae cannot be conducted when<br>
compared with an apparatus of pulling the rear part of the neck, thereby resulting in an<br>
ineffective pulling of the cervical vertebrae.<br>
For example, the first cervical vertebra is a region where the brain connects to<br>
the spinal cord through which approximately'30,000 nerve strands pass, and when a<br>
structural problem occurs at this region, a disorder occurs at a region governed by the<br>
nerve strands and structural deformation can result on the spinal cord and the skull,<br>
such that an elongating exercise by way of traction is indispensable.<br>
However, there is a drawback in the conventional traction apparatus of<br>
simultaneously pushing or pulling the chin and the back of the neck in that a rear part<br>
of the skull is not raised, preventing a proper elongation of the first and second cervical<br>
vertebrae, whereas it is necessary to lift the epiglottis of the skull and to elongate the<br>
first and second cervical vertebrae in order to evenly transmit the elongation effect to<br>
seven cervical vertebrae because the first cervical vertebra is covered by the epiglottis.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is disclosed to solve the aforementioned problems and it<br>
is an object of the present invention to provide a traction apparatus for cervical<br>
vertebrae adapted to concentratively pull only the rear part of the neck close to the<br>
cervical vertebrae,<br>
In accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention, the traction<br>
apparatus for cervical vertebrae comprises: a first prop for supporting shoulder parts at<br>
one side of the first prop; a second prop slidably coupled to the first prop in the<br>
longitudinal direction of the cervical vertebrae; moving means for moving the second<br>
prop in the longitudinal direction of the cervical vertebrae by way of manipulation of a<br>
user, a third prop rotatably coupled at one distal end thereof to the second prop in such<br>
a way that the rear part of a head can be laid thereon, the third prop provided with a<br>
head support for supporting the border area between the head and neck at one side of<br>
the third prop; and lifting means for rotating the third prop in the stooping direction of<br>
the neck by way of manipulation of the user.<br>
In accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention, a traction<br>
apparatus for cervical vertebrae comprises: a first prop for supporting a shoulder part<br>
at one side of the first prop; a second prop slidably coupled to the first prop at one side<br>
of the second prop; lifting means for rotating the second prop in the stooping direction<br>
of the neck by way of manipulation of the user, a head support formed at the second<br>
prop for supporting the border between the neck and the head; and moving means for<br><br>
slidably coupling the head support in the longitudinal direction of the cervical<br>
vertebrae and for moving the head support by way of manipulation of a user.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in<br>
detail with reference to the annexed drawings. FIG 1 is a perspective view of a<br>
traction apparatus for cervical vertebrae according to the first embodiment of the<br>
present invention. FIG 2 is a cross-sectional view taken along line AA of FIG. 1.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the traction apparatus for cervical vertebrae<br>
according to the first embodiment of the present invention includes a first prop (1), a<br>
second prop (30) and third prop (40).<br>
The first prop (1) for supporting shoulder parts at one side of the first prop (1)<br>
may be formed as one single member. However, as illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, the<br>
first prop (1) may be formed with shoulder supports (10,11) at one side of the first prop<br>
(1) and a prop (20) at the other side of the first prop (1). The shoulder supports<br>
(10,11) and the prop (20) may either be integrally formed or separately formed and<br>
coupled together thereafter.<br>
The shoulder supports (10,11) of the first prop (1) are contoured to support to<br>
the shoulder parts (S) of a human body, for example, each shoulder part may be<br>
concave shaped. The prop (20) at the first support (1) has a shape of a box with a<br>
right side thereof being opened, and is fixedly formed at a bottom surface thereof with<br><br>
a plurality of female screw members (21-23) formed with female screw holes in the<br>
right and left ends thereof.<br>
The second prop (30) has a shape of an upside down box and is slidably and<br>
horizontally coupled to the first prop (1), in other words, in the longitudinal direction<br>
of the cervical vertebrae lying on the third prop (40).<br>
Furthermore, the second prop (30) is disposed with a first screw axis (31)<br>
circumferentially formed with male threads. The first screw axis (31) passes through<br>
a right lateral surface of the second prop (30) to be rotatably fixed by a bearing (32)<br>
and a first axis fixation member (33). The first screw axis (31) is then inserted into<br>
screw holes of each screw member (21-23) disposed at the prop (20) of the first prop<br>
(1). The first screw axis (31) is coupled at a right longitudinal end thereof to a first<br>
handle (34) by which a user can easily rotate the first screw axis (31).<br>
The second prop (30) is formed thereon with second and third axis fixation<br>
members (35a, 35b) each fixedly disposed at left and right ends thereof; and a second<br>
screw axis (37) circumferentially formed with male threads and rotatably fixed by the<br>
axis fixation members (35a, 35b) and bearings (36a, 36b).<br>
The second screw axis (37) is circumferentially formed with a moving<br>
member (38) equipped with female threads corresponding to the male threads and is<br>
coupled at a right longitudinal end thereof to a second handle (39) by which a user can<br>
easily rotate the second screw axis (37).<br>
The third prop (40) has a shape of an upside down box and is open at the right<br><br>
side thereof. The third prop (40) is disposed on top of the second prop (30) and is<br>
rotatably fixed at a left longitudinal end thereof to the second prop (30) via a hinge<br>
(41).<br>
Between the third prop (40) and the second prop (30), a connecting member<br>
(44) is rotatably fixed at one end thereof to a ceiling of the third prop (40) via a hinge<br>
(42) and rotatably fixed at the other end thereof to the moving member (38) via a hinge<br>
(43).<br>
The third prop (40) is fixedly formed thereon with head supports (50,51) for<br>
supporting a border between the head (H) and the neck (N) in the right direction, i.e.,<br>
in the direction of the head (H).<br>
Hereinafter, the operational merits of the first embodiment of the present<br>
invention thus constructed will be described in detail with reference to the annexed<br>
drawings.<br>
First, as illustrated in FIG 2, the shoulder (S) is arranged to be supported by<br>
shoulder supports (10,11) of the first prop (1) and a body is so'positioned as to allow<br>
the border between the head (H) and the neck (N) tp be supported by the head supports<br>
(50, 51).<br>
Under these circumstances, as illustrated in FIG. 3, when the second handle<br>
(39) is rotated in the clockwise direction in order for a user or a patient to stoop the<br>
neck (N) at an appropriate angle, the second screw axis (37) rotates in the clockwise<br>
direction to move the moving member (38) to the left in relation with Fig. 3, which<br><br>
inserted into the second screw axis (37).<br>
When the moving member (38) moves to the left (toward the body), the third<br>
prop (40) connected to the moving member (38) via a connecting member (44) is<br>
rotated about a hinge axle (4i) to thereafter be lifted. In other words, the neck (N) of<br>
a user can be stooped forward at a desired angle as the third prop (40) is lifted.<br>
Next, as illustrated in FIG 4, when the first handle (34) is rotated in the<br>
clockwise direction, the first screw axis (31) rotates in the clockwise direction to push<br>
each female screw member (21-23) fixed at the prop (20) of the first prop (1) to the left<br>
in relation with Fig, 4.<br>
As the first screw axis (31) pushes each female screw member (21-23) of the<br>
first prop (1) to the left (toward the body), the second prop (30) consequently moves to<br>
the right (away from the body) for elongating the cervical vertebrae of the neck (N).<br>
Because the neck (N) of the user is bent forward at a prescribed angle, the neck (N) is<br>
elongated at a slight incline from the rear to the front of the neck (N).<br>
In other words, an elongation exercise is carried out with the neck (N) under a<br>
slightly stooped state, such that only the rear part of the neck (N) where the cervical<br>
vertebrae are located is elongated while the chin is not elongated. As a result, there is<br>
no problem of Temporomandibular disorder (TMD), and the elongation distance of the<br>
cervical vertebrae is relatively lengthened compared with the back of the neck and the<br>
chin being lengthened at the same time, thereby enabling to conduct a concentrated<br>
traction of the cervical vertebrae only.<br><br>
Meanwhile, although, the aforementioned operation describes an elongation<br>
exercise where the third prop (40) is lifted, the neck (N) is stooped and the second prop<br>
(30) is moved, the elongation exercise may be conducted in such a way that the second<br>
prop (30) is first moved to lift the third prop (40), or the second and third props (30,<br>
40) are gradually moved and lifted.<br>
Although the first embodiment thus described exemplifies a manually<br>
operated construction where a user personally rotates the handles (34, 39), the<br>
construction may be embodied in such a way that an actuator (an electric motor, a<br>
pneumatic pump, a solenoid or the like) may be applied to a handle part whereby an<br>
elongation exercise may be performed by the actuator without direct application on the<br>
handle by a user.<br>
For example, as illustrated in PIG 5, preferably, first and second gear boxes<br>
(60, 61) are coupled to the first and second screw axes (31, 37) instead of the first and<br>
second handles (34, 39), and each gear box (60, 61) is connected to first and second<br>
electric motors (70, 71) whereby the first and second electric motors (70, 71) can be<br>
driven by the current applied from a manipulation controller (80).<br>
As another example, although the first embodiment of the present invention<br>
describes a Construction where the second prop (30) is arranged underneath the third<br>
prop (40), the second prop (30) may be positioned above the third prop (40), as shown<br>
in Fig. 6 except that, in this case, the second prop (30) should be rotatably fixed to the<br>
first prop (1) via the hinge (41).<br><br>
FIG 7 is a perspective view of a traction apparatus for cervical vertebrae<br>
according to the second embodiment of the present invention and FIG 8 is &amp; partial<br>
cut-out perspective view of FIG 7, As depicted in FIGS. 7 and 8, a traction apparatus<br>
for cervical vertebrae according to the second embodiment of the present invention<br>
comprises a first prop (100), a second prop (130) and a third prop (140).<br>
The first prop (100) is designed to support the shoulder part at one side thereof.<br>
Preferably, the first prop (100) is made of a solid member or constructed with shoulder<br>
parts (110,111) at one side and a prop (120) at the other side as shown in FIGS. 7 and 8.<br>
Preferably, the shoulder parts (110,111) and the prop (120) are integrally formed, or<br>
separately formed and assembled later.<br>
Each shoulder part (110, 111) of the first prop (100) is contoured to support<br>
the shoulder part of a body, i.e., concave shape at one side thereof, and the prop (120)<br>
of the first prop (100) has a shape of an opened box at the right side, and is fixedly<br>
arranged on the floor surface with a plurality of female screw members (121-123)<br>
formed with female screw holes, each member spaced out at a prescribed distance.<br>
The second prop (130) of a box shape is horizontally coupled to the first prop<br>
(100), i.e., slidably coupled in the longitudinal direction of the cervical vertebrae lying<br>
on the third prop (140), A floor surface (130a) of the second prop (130) is opened at<br>
one side thereof such that the female screw members (121-123) can be protruded into<br>
the second prop (130) when coupled with the first prop (100).<br>
The second prop (130) is disposed with a first screw axis (131)<br><br>
circumferentially formed with male threads. The first screw axis (131) passes<br>
through a right lateral surface of the second prop (130) to be rotatably fixed by a<br>
bearing (132) and a first axis fixation member (133). The first screw axis (131) is<br>
then inserted into screw holes of each screw member (121-123) disposed at the first<br>
prop (100). The first screw axis (131) is coupled at a right longitudinal end thereof to<br>
a first handle (134) by which a user can easily rotate the first screw axis (131).<br>
Furthermore, the second prop (130) is disposed with a second screw axis (137)<br>
circumferentially formed with male threads. The second screw axis (137) passes<br>
through a right lateral surface of the second prop (130) to be rotatably fixed by<br>
bearings (136a, 136b) and axis fixation members (135a, 135b). The second screw<br>
axis (137) is circumferentially inserted by a moving member (138) equipped with<br>
female screw holes corresponding to male threads. The second screw axis (137) is<br>
coupled at a longitudinal distal end thereof to a second handle (139) by which a user<br>
can easily rotate the second screw axis (137).<br>
The third prop (140) of a broad plate shape is arranged on the second prop<br>
(130), and is rotatably fixed at a left longitudinal distal end thereof to the second prop<br>
(130) via a hinge (141). Between the third prop (140) and the second prop (130),<br>
there is disposed a connecting member (144) rotatably fixed at one end thereof to a<br>
ceiling of the third prop (140) and rotatably fixed at the other end thereof to the<br>
moving member (138) via a hinge (143). The third prop (140) is fixedly formed<br>
thereon with head supports (150, 151) for supporting a border between the head (H)<br><br>
and the neck (N) in the right direction, i.e., in the direction of the head (H).<br>
When compared with the first embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
second embodiment is different in that the third prop is shaped of a plate and a part<br>
where a head of a user is positioned is lowered in height thereof and the overall<br>
external appearance looks thin and simple. However, the operational merits and<br>
processes between the first and second embodiments are identical.<br>
Meanwhile, although the second embodiment describes that the third prop<br>
(140) is lifted in performing the elongation exercise, the head is stooped and the<br>
second prop (130) is moved, it should be noted that the second prop (130) may initially<br>
be moved to lift the third prop (140), or the second prop (130) and the third prop (140)<br>
may be gradually and little by little moved and lifted for conducting the elongation<br>
exercise.<br>
In the same context, although the second embodiment thus described<br>
exemplifies a manually operated construction where a user personally rotates the<br>
handles (134, 139), the construction may be embodied in such a way that an actuator<br>
(an electric motor, a pneumatic pump, a solenoid or the like) may be applied to a<br>
handle part whereby an elongation exercise may be performed by the actuator without<br>
any force from a user being directly applied to the handle.<br>
For example, as illustrated in FIG 5, preferably, first and second gear boxes<br>
are coupled to the first and second screw axes (131, 137) instead of the first and<br>
second handles (134,139), and each gear box is connected to first and second electric<br><br>
motors whereby the exercise may be conducted by the first and second electric motors<br>
driven by the current applied from a manipulation controller.<br>
FIG 9 is a perspective view of a traction apparatus for cervical vertebrae<br>
according to a third embodiment of the present invention and FIG 10 is a partial cut-<br>
out perspective view of FIG 9. As depicted in PIGS. 9 and 10, a traction apparatus<br>
for cervical Vertebrae includes a first prop (200), a second prop (230) and a head<br>
support (240),<br>
The first prop (200) is designed to support the shoulder part at one side thereof.<br>
Preferably, the first prop (200) is made of a solid member, or constructed with shoulder<br>
parts (210, 211) at one side and a prop (220) at the other side as shown in FIGS. 9 and<br>
10. Preferably, the shoulder parts (210,211) and the prop (220) are integrally formed,<br>
or separately formed and assembled later.<br>
Each shoulder part (210, 211) of the first prop (200) is contoured to support<br>
the shoulder part of a body, i.e., concave shape at one side thereof, and the prop (220)<br>
of the first prop (200) has a shape of a box with an opening (220a) at the right side.<br>
The prop (220) of the first prop (200) is formed with a first screw axis (221)<br>
circumferentially formed with male threads. The first screw axis (221) passes<br>
through a right lateral surface of the prop (220) and is rotatably fixed by axis fixation<br>
members (222a, 222b) and bearings (223a, 223 b).<br>
The first screw axis (221) is circumferentially inserted by a moving member<br>
(224) equipped with female threads corresponding to the male threads and is coupled<br><br>
at a right longitudinal distal end thereof with a first handle (225) by which a user can<br>
easily rotate the first screw axis (221).<br>
The second prop (230) of a broad plate shape is formed with a guide groove<br>
(230a) for guiding the movement of the head support (240) and is arranged on the first<br>
prop (200), and is rotatably fixed at a left longitudinal distal end thereof to the first<br>
prop (200) via a hinge (231). Between the second prop (230) and the first prop (200),<br>
there is disposed a connecting member (233) rotatably fixed at one end thereof to a<br>
ceiling of the second prop (230) and rotatably fixed at the other end thereof to the<br>
moving member (224) via a binge (232).<br>
The second prop (230) is formed thereunder with a second screw axis (234)<br>
circumferentially formed with male threads. The second screw axis (234) is rotatably<br>
fixed via axis fixation members (235a, 235b) each inserted into the prop (220) via an<br>
opening (220a) formed at the prop (220) of the first prop (200) and fixed to a ceiling<br>
surface of the second prop (230) and bearings (236a, 236b).<br>
The second screw axis (234) is circumferentially inserted by a guide moving<br>
member (237) equipped with female thread boles corresponding to the male threads<br>
and coupled at one side thereof to a bottom surface of the head support (240) via the<br>
guide groove (230a) of the second prop (230). The second screw axis (234) is further<br>
coupled at the other longitudinal distal end thereof to a second handle (238) by which a<br>
user can easily rotate the second screw axis (234).<br>
The head support (240) supports a border part between the head and the neck<br><br>
in the right direction, i.e., the head direction, and moves along the guide groove (230a)<br>
in response to the rotation of the second screw axis (234).<br>
In the third embodiment of the present invention thus described, when the first<br>
handle (225) is rotated in the clockwise direction, the first screw axis (221) is rotated<br>
in the clockwise direction to lift the second prop (230) and the cervical vertebrae is<br>
stooped forward. When the second handle (238) is rotated in the clockwise direction,<br>
the second screw axis (234) is rotated in the clockwise direction to move the head<br>
support (240) to the right direction (toward the head) and to elongate the cervical<br>
vertebrae. The operational merits of the third embodiment are the same as those of<br>
the first embodiment. The third embodiment of the present invention is so designed<br>
as to reduce the number of parts for simplification of the construction as compared<br>
with the first and second embodiments.<br>
Meanwhile, although the third embodiment describes that the second prop<br>
(230) is lifted in performing the elongation exercise, the head is stooped and the head<br>
support (240) is moved, it should be noted that, in response to a user's desire, the head<br>
support (240) may initially be moved to lift the second prop-(230), or the second prop<br>
(230) and the head support (240) may be gradually and little by little moved and lifted<br>
for conducting the elongation exercise.<br>
In the same context, although the third embodiment thus described exemplifies<br>
a manually operated construction where a user personally rotates the handles (225,<br>
238), the construction may be embodied in such a way that an actuator (an electric<br><br>
motor, a pneumatic pump, a solenoid or the like) may be applied to a handle part<br>
whereby an elongation exercise may be performed by the actuator without any force<br>
from a user being directly applied to the handle.<br>
For example, as illustrated in FIG 5, preferably, first and second gear boxes<br>
are coupled to the first and second screw axes (221, 234) instead of the first and<br>
second handles (225, 238), and each gear box is connected to first and second electric<br>
motors whereby the exercise may be conducted by the first and second electric motors<br>
driven by the current applied from a manipulation controller.<br>
As described above, according to the three embodiments of the present<br>
invention, the cervical vertebrae are stooped and elongated by which the height of the<br>
chine is fixed and only the rear part of the neck is concentratively elongated, thereby<br>
enabling to achieve an effective traction of the cervical vertebrae. A further detailed<br>
explanation of the traction of the cervical vertebrae is provided below.<br>
The cervical vertebrae are lopsidedly aligned from the middle to the back<br>
section of a neck, and when the back of the neck is concentratively depressed,<br>
resistance of unflexible tissues can be reduced. Blood vessels, gullet and respiratory<br>
tract that are positioned at the front of cervical vertebrae can be protected.<br>
Furthermore, considering that most of the disorders in a cervical vertebral<br>
region occur in the rear part of the cervical vertebrae, it is preferable that the back of<br>
the neck should be concentratively elongated. For example, in case of prolapsus of<br>
intervertebral disks, the back of the cervical vertebrae should be elongated as in the<br><br>
present embodiments such that the curvature of the cervical vertebrae can be<br>
straightened and the intervertebral foramen positioned at the back of the cervical<br>
vertebrae can be lifted to effectively reduce pressure to nerve roots, because the<br>
cervical vertebrae have a shape of "C " opening to the rear of the neck.<br>
Furthermore, in order to transmit the elongation effect to the entire seven<br>
cervical vertebrae, the larynx of the skull should be lifted to elongate the number one<br>
and two cervical vertebra. However, the method of pulling or pushing both the chin<br>
and the rear part of the neck according to the prior arts cannot lift the larynx of the<br>
skull and properly elongate the number one and two vertebra, whilst according to the<br>
present invention, the cervical vertebrae can be stooped slightly in the forward<br>
direction and elongated such that the traction exercise can be conducted with the<br>
larynx of the skull covering the number one and two cervical vertebra being lifted,<br>
thereby enabling to evenly transmit the elongation effect to the seven cervical<br>
vertebrae.<br>
The foregoing description of the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention has been presented for the purpose of illustration and description. It is not<br>
intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed, and<br>
modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teachings or may be<br>
acquired from practice of the invention. It is intended that the scope of the invention<br>
be defined by the claims appended hereto, and their equivalents.<br>
As apparent from the foregoing, there is an advantage in the traction apparatus<br><br>
for cervical vertebrae thus described according to the embodiments of the present<br>
invention, in that force is not applied to the chin but is only concentrated to the rear part<br>
of the neck such that impact or pressure is not applied to the chin, thereby preventing<br>
TMJ disorder and further lengthening the elongation distance of the cervical vertebrae<br>
compared with elongation of both the chin and the rear part of the neck, and effectively<br>
elongating the cervical vertebrae because the larynx of the skull covering the number<br>
one and two cervical vertebra is lifted.<br>
There is another advantage in that cervical vertebrae lopsidedly positioned<br>
toward the back of the neck are concentratively depressed by which resistance of<br>
unfexible tissues that protect and encompass blood vessels, gullet and respiratory tract<br>
that are positioned at the front of cervical vertebrae can be reduced, and more effective<br>
and safer elongation exercises can be conducted.<br>
There is still another advantage in that the inclined angle of the neck can be<br>
adjusted to a safe and comfortable position at any time before or after the elongation or<br>
in the midst of the elongation for a patient who has a deformation.in the overall<br>
structure of the cervical vertebrae, and a patient can adjust the position of the neck land<br>
the intensity of the elongation force by himself or by herself.<br><br>
