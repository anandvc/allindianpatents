COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"WEDGE    CLAMP   TYPE   TERMINATION    FOR   ELEVATOR   TENSION MEMBER"<br>
OTIS ELEVATOR COMPANY, a corporation organized under the laws of the State of New Jersey, of 10 Farm Springs, Farmington, Connecticut 06032-2568, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
WEDGE CLAMP TYPE TERMINATION FOR ELEVATOR TENSION MEMBER<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to elevator systems, and more particularly to tension members for such elevator systems.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
A conventional traction elevator system includes i. car, a counterweight, two or more ropes interconnecting the car and counterweight, a traction sheave to move the ropes, and a machine to rotate the traction sheave. The ropes are formed from laid or twisted steel wire and the sheave is formed from cast iron.<br>
Although conventional steel ropes and cast iron sheaves have proven very reliable and cost effective, there are limitations on their use. One such limitation is the traction forces between the ropes arid the sheave. Typical techniques to increase the traction forces between the ropes and sheave result in reducing the durability of the ropes, increasing wear or the increasing rope pressure.<br>
Another limitation on the use of steel ropes is the flexibility and fatigue characteristics of steel wire ropes   The minimum diameter of a steel rope is di:tated mostly by fatigue requirements and results in a relatively thick rope. The relattvely thick cross section of a steel rope reduces its inherent flexibility necessitating a sheave having a relatively large diameter. The larger the sheave diameter, the greater torque required from the machine to drive the elevator system thereby increasing the size and cost of the elevator system<br>
Another drawback of conventional round ropes is that smaller sheave diameters increase rope pressure shortening the life of the rope   Rope press ire is generated as the rope travels over the sheve and is dierctly proportional to the tension . in the rope and inversely proportional to the sheave diameter D and the rope dimeter   In addition, the shape of the sheave grooves, including such traction enhancing techniques<br><br>
as undercutting the sheave grooves, further increases the maximum rope pressure to which the rope is subjected<br>
In a typical rope driven elevator installation rope wedge clamps are used for termination purposes. Wedge clamps operate by securing the el ;vator rope between opposed angled walls of the wedge clamps and a tear drop shap;d wedge around which the cable is wound. The wedge acts to cam the rope against the walls of the wedge clamp during tensioning of the ropes. A benefit of this design is that the wedge may have a relatively sharp angle producing a large clamping force. Because the steel ropes have a high compressive strength the large clamping force has no deleterious effects on the rope such as crush or creep<br>
In attempts to overcome the deficiencies and drawbacks of conventional round steel ropes for use in elevator systems coated tension members, including a relatively flat tension member, has been developed. The flat tension member ncludes a plurality of individual load carrying cords encased within a common layer of coating. An exemplar)" tension member of the type contemplated in this application is discussed in further detail in U.S. Serial No. 09/031,108 filed February 26, 1998 Entitled Tension Member For An Elevator and Continuation-In-Part Application Entitled Tension Member For An Elevator filed December 22, 1998 under Attorney Docke: No. 9K-2143, both of which are entirely incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The coating layer surrounds and/or separates the individ raj cords and defines an engagement surface for engaging a traction sheave. As a result cT the configuration of the tension member, the rope pressure may be distributed more uniformly throughout the tension member, traction is increased and smaller sheave diametv.rs are possible<br>
A method of terminating and securing flat tension members involves looping the members over a bar and clamping the end with a pair of plates,   The plates are secured by a plurality of fasteners that pass through holes provided in the plates.   Another method of terminating flat tension members includes a wedged end fastener wherein a wedge of material is positioned at the end of the tension member and clamped by a pair of plates<br><br>
In such a configuration one of the plates comprises a wedge shaped cross section cooperating with the wedge of material and the second plate comprises a cross section of uniform thickness. The plates are similarly secured by a plurality of fasteners that pass through holes provided in the plates. A drawback to these types of termination methods is that the tension carrying capability of the termination relies solely on the clamping forces provided by the fasteners. In addition, the wedge type fastener limits the termination point of the member and hampers adjustability.<br>
The above art notwithstanding, scientists and engineers under the direction of Applicants" Assignee are working to develop more efficient and durable methods and apparatus to drive elevator systems.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
According to the present invention, a termination device for a tension member having a compressible outer coating has a wedge disposed in a socket having cooperating jaw surfaces. The rope is wrapped around the wedge and inserted with the socket and clamped therein by forces generated by the tension in the member and the cooperation of the wedge and jaw surfaces.<br>
A principal feature of the present invention is the geometry of the wedge, particularly the angle of the wedge, including its length and width. The wedge is sized and the angle is selected to provide sufficient clamping force to resist slippage of the rope without exceeding the compressive stress capability of the tension member   In addition, the wedge comprises a domed top portion to efficiently distribute the tension of the rope across the wedge<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Illustrated in Figure 1 is a traction elevator system 12. The elevator system 12 includes a car 14, a counterweight 16, a traction drive 18, and a machine 20. The traction drive 18 includes a tension member 22, interconnecting the car 11 and counterweight 16, and a traction sheave 24. The tension member 22 is engaged with  the sheave 24 such that rotation of the sheave 24 moves the tension member 22, and thereby the cir 14 and counterweight 16. Tension member 22 is coupled to courterweight 16 and caj 14 by tcrmma) clamp 30. Although shown as a geared machine 20, it should be noted thai this configuration is for illustrative purposes only, and the present (mention may be used with geared or gearless machines. In addition, although shown as  a relatively ::lat tension member 22, it should be noted that this too is by way of example and the present invention may be used with other types of tension membes including round coated tension members.<br><br>
An embodiment of terminal clamp 30 is illustrated in more detail in Figure 2. Tension member 22 is wrapped around wedge 32 and disposed within socket :4. Terminal clamp 30 is attached to car 14 and counterweight 16 via  attachment iod 36 attached to socket 34 by pin 38. Attachment rod 36 is coupled to counterweight 16 and car 14 by threaded nuts 40 secured in place by cotter pin -2. AISO shown in Figure 2 is an optional gripping jaw clamp 50 wherein tension member 22 is clamped within grooves 52,54 of plates 56, 58 in a double overlap arrangement.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3 clamp 30 operates to provide a secure termination of tension member 22. In use, lead portion 44 of tension member 22 is inserted within aperture 46 in the bottom portion of socket 34, as viewed in the figure, wrap portion 47 of the tension member is then wrapped around wedge 32 and then tail portion 48 passed back out through aperture 44. Wedge 32 is then inserted within opening (0 of socket 34 to the clamp position shown in FIG. 2 wherein lead portion 44 and tail portion 48 are clamped between jaw surfaces 62, 64 respectively, of socker 34. lerminazion clamp 30 is designed such that tension member 22 and attachment rod 36 are substantially axially aligned to allow for efficient load transfer and prevents undesirable rotation of termination clamp.<br>
Still referring to FIG. 3. in normal operation of the elevatar system 12 (FIG. 1), the tension (T) in lead portion 44 of tension member 22 is  in the direction indicated by arrow 66 which reacts in wrap ponion 47 to force wedge 32 fartrer into socket 34 in the direction of aperture 46. With the load in tension member 22 foicing wedge 32 into socket 34. a clamping force represented by arrow 68 ciarr.ps lead portion 44 against jaw surface 62 and a clamping force represented by arrow 70 clamps tail ponion 48 against jaw surface 64. Clamping forces 68, 70 are normal to jaws 62, 64 respectively, and to the respective portions of wedge 32 and are expressed as normal forces (Fn).   "he clamping forces generated by jaws 62. 64, together with the frict on forces acting on wrap portion 47. react out the total tension (T) in tension member 22 thereby letaining the member in clamp 30.<br><br>
An alternative embodiment of termination clamp 30 is shown in FIGS 4 and 5 wherein attachment rod 36 is attached to pivot block 72 by pin 33 an in mm pivotally attached to socket 34 by pivot pin 74 and secured by cotter pin 76. In this particular embodiment, lead portion 44 of tension member 22 is inserted w thin aperture 46 in the<br>
5     bottom portion of socket 34, as viewed in the figure, wrap portio:i 47 of the tension member is then wrapped around wedge 32 and then tail portion 48 passed back out through aperture 44. Wedge 32 is then inserted within opening 60 of socket 34 to the clamp position shown in FIG. 5 wherein lead portion 44 and tail portion 48 are clamped between jaw surfaces 62,64 respectively, of socket 34. It is an important fcanire of this<br>
10     embodiment that once wedge 32 and tension member 22 are instidied within socket 34 pivot block 72 is then installed to prevent the wedge from being inadvertently dislodged from the socket if tension is lost in the member, as will be more fully described hereinbelow. In addition, this particular embodiment maintains tension member 22 and attachment rod 36 substantially axially aligned to allow for effici int load transfer. Pivot<br>
5     block 72 also permits angular displacement of tension member 22 relative to the car 14 or counterweight 16 without imparting large stresses within attachment rod 36 or socket 34. Another advantage of this particular embodiment over that shown in FIGS  2 and 3 is that the overall height the socket is reduced because the wedge 32 is inserted through the top of socket 34. Pivot block 72 is then inserted within close proximity of the wedge<br>
0     thus reducing the overall height of termination clamp 30.<br>
The geometry of wedge 32 is an important facior in pioducing normal forces 68, 70 and properly retaining tension member 22   The relevant parameters of wedge 32 controlling the normal force F„ are shown with reference to FIG. 5 and include the length (L) designated by 78, depth (d) represented by 80, angle § represented by 82 and<br>
5      measured from centerhne 83 to clamping surface 33. 35 and the v,idth (\V) of tension member 22 (FIG. 2). The other factor relevant to controlling the lormal forces 68, 70 is the tension (T) in tension member 22 represented by 66 The parameters L and d are somewhat dependant on Φ and are typically limited by available space in the hoistway<br><br>
(not shown). Given a nominal tension T. normal forces F, 68, 7( (FIGS 3 and 5) are inversely related to Φ. That is to say, if Φ is too small, F„ will be too great and tension member 22 will experience compressive creep. This is p articularly important in an embodiment where tension member 22 is comprised of a methane outer coating, or where the coating is another flexible elastomer, as they hive a maximum compressive stress (oc) capability of about 5 MPa before non-recoverable deformation, or creep, occurs  On the other hand if Φ is too large the normal forces wil be too small the tension member will slip within termination clamp 30. It is particularly itdvantageous to reduce the compressive stress on tension member 22. One way lo reduce the compressive stress is to increase the length L over which the clamping force:} are applied, however hoistway consideration are generally limiting in this regard. Taking the ab:&gt;vc referenced physical parameters in to consideration, in order to preclude exce«iding o\ the minimum <j> can be predetermined in accordance with the formula: Φ tan 1[T/(Oc*L*W)]<br>
In a typical application of the present invention for a tension member having a T of about 2500 K, d ranges from about 60 mm to about 70 mm, L is about 140 mm, 4&gt; ranges from about 9 degrees to about 10 degrees<br>
The present invention will now be described with respect to a specific example of the termination clamp 30 shown in FIGS 4 and 5 by referring to FIG. 6. A typical tension member 22, as described in the above related app.ication;. is comprised of a 30 mm wide flat flexible rope having a urethane outer coating and has a maximum tension capability of 30,000 N. As is known in the art, a safetv factor of about 12 is applied to elevator ropes and provides a maximum tension in member 22 ol" about 2500 N   Wedge 32 has length L of 140 mm and angle 6 of 10 degrees geometrically yielding ciameter d as follows.<br>
d = 2(L tan Φ) « 2(140 tan 20-2)) = 49.37 mm<br>
The determination of F„ with T equal to 2500 N is as follows:<br><br><br>
Since F„ is distributed over the entire area of lead portion 44 the compressive stress cr on the tension member 22 is a function of the area of lead portion. A, clamped between wedge 32 jaw surface 32, and is calculated as follows: A - L * W = 140 * 30 = 4,200 mm2<br>
The compressive stress in tension member 22 is then determined as follows.<br><br>
In this particular example, the compressive stress limit of the material is not exceeded and therefore no creep will occur.<br>
The ability of termination clamp 30 to react out T in lead section 44 is important and is a function of F0 and the coefficient of friction (u) between the tension member 22 and jaw surface 62 and the surface of wedge 32. In the example ?iven. tension member 22 is comprised of a urethane coating and jaw surface 62. as well as wedge 32. is smooth steel and a conservative number for die coefficient friction between the surfaces is about u = 0.25.   To properly maintain wedge 32 within socket 34 T must be preferably substantially reacted out within lead section 44 although e remainder may be transferred into wrap section 47. The following relation, from clamp ng theory, provides the maximum reaction force Fr, or the amount of tension that can be eacted, in the example given for \± = 0.25:<br><br>
Therefore, recalling that the maximum T in the example given is 2500 K, all of the tension T will be reacted out of tension member 22 in the lead portion 44 and the member will not slip within termination clamp 30.<br>
An alternative embodiment of the present invention aimed at increasing the coefficient of faction between the tension member 22 and the jav surface 62, 64 and<br><br>
wedge 32 comprises a roughened surface on the jaws and the wedge. In one particular embodiment the surface is roughened by a sandblasting procedure. Sandblasting of the surfaces raises the coefficient of friction to .35 or greater. Other methods of increasing the surface friction include etching, machining, knurling and other suitable equivalents. 5     In addition to raising the coefficient of friction the roughened sui faces would form small ridges and valleys. A characteristic of the urethane coating is its tendency to exhibit cold flow under high loading conditions. Under the loading conditiors described above the urethane coating cold flows into and around the ridges and valleys, also referred to as locking features, in the wedge and socket and provides for a small but effective<br>
10     mechanical lock. The locking features increase the ability of the termination clamp to resist slippage of tension member 22. It is within the scope of ths present invention that the locking features may comprise grooves, striations 83 (FIG 7), cuts, diamond partem, or other suitable equivalents. It is important to note that the locking features reduce the required normal force as described hereinabove. The use of locking features as describes<br>
15      allows a reduction in the length L, or an increase in angle Φ to further minimi2£ the nsk of creep.<br>
An alternative embodiment for wedge 32 is shown in FIG 7 and includes ndges 84, 86 forming a channel 88 therebetween. Ridges 84, 86 are approximately the height of a cord within the coating of tension member 22. For example, a particular embodimenr<br>
20     of tension member 22 is 3mm thick having a cord with a 1.4mm cord disposed therein Ridges 84, 86 for this particular embodiment would define a chainel 88 having a depth of approximately1mm. Tension member 22 is disposed within channel 88 and wedge 12 is installed within socket 34 as described herein above. The benefit of ridges 34, 86 are that they contain tension member 22 within channel 88 given the anticipated cold flow<br>
25      characteristics of the coating material   In addition, ridges 84, 86 are sized to prevent compressive stress failure of tension member 22 by limiting the displacement of wedge 32 within socket 34. In the event that a higher than anticipated normal force F„ is<br><br>
transferred to the member ridges 84, 86 will contact jaw surfaces 62, 64 and arrest  the travel of wedge 32 within socket 64<br>
Referring now to FIGURES 2, 8 and 9. the above mentioned  optional tension<br>
clamp 50 for use with the termination clamp 30 is illustrated. The purpose of tension<br>
clamp 50 is to aid in terminating and reacting tension in member 22 and to equalize the<br>
tension between lead portion 44 and tail portion 48 as thev enter socket 34. Tension<br>
clamp 50 also assists termination clamp 30 in the unlikely event ;of that tension member<br>
22 loses tension, such as for instance, during an abrupt stop of elivator car 14. Tension<br>
clamp 50 is clamped onto the tail portion 48 and lead portion 44 prior to entering socket<br>
34. When engaged with the tension member 22, tension clamp 50 cannot move thereon.<br>
Plates 56, 58 as shown and described are identical, however it is within the scope of the<br>
present invention that the plates are different wherein one plate has a tension member<br>
groove and one plate has no groove.	<br>
As described hereinabove tension clamp 50 comprises a pair of plates 56, 58 each having a tension member groove 52, 54 approximately thr thickness of the tension member 22. Bore holes 51 are provided for through passige of fasteners 53. Plates 56. 58 further include leading edges 55 composing a generous radia-; to facilitate a smooth transition of lead portion 44 and tail portion 48 from socket 34 ir.to tension clamp 50<br>
In use, the lead portion 44 is inserted into groove 52 of plate 56 and ta:I portion 48 into groove 54 of plate 58 and the plates are assembled together with fasteners 53. When the bolts 53 are tightened tension member 22 is clamped within the grooves 52, 54 and are held resistant to slippage by plates 56, 58 In this way the  tension member is prevented from moving relative to tension clamp 50.<br>
When optional tension clamp 50 is used in conjunction with termination clamp 30, leading portion 44 and tail portion 48 load share the full tension created by car 14   In this regard, the analysis for determining the clamping performance establishec. herein above is modified to reflect a load sharing in the tension in each of the cables<br><br>
While preferred embodiments have been shown and descnbed, various modifications and substitutions may be made thereto without departing from the spint and scope of the invention. Accordingly, it is to be understood dial me present invention has been described by vvav of illustration and not limitation<br><br>
