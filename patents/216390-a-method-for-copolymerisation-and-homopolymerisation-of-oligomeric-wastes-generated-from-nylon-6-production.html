(Structure Removed)<br>
In accordance to one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention, the diacid, referred to as monomer-I is preferably ethylene glycol and diacid, referred to as monomer-II is terephthalic acid and such combination of said monomer-I and said<br><br>
monomer-II will result in preparation of copolymer of nylon and polyester, referred to as, nylon6-PET, wherein nylon6 represents oligomeric waste and PET represents said monomers. The selection of said monomer-I and/or said monomer-II will depend upon desire of copolymer to be manufactured.<br>
In accordance to the preferred embodiment of the present invention the raising of temperature, preferably to about 180°C to 200°C and maintaining at this temperature for about 2 to 4 hrs result in increase of NH2 group from 50 meq/kg to about 125 to 250 meq/kg, which indicates opening if chain of some of the cyclic oligomers, which were obtained in the said oligomeric waste.<br>
Further, in accordance to one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention, the said oligomeric waste, as stated herein above, is heated first to a temperature of about 135 to 140°C and maintained at this temperature and then subsequently further heated to raise the temperature, preferably to about 180 to 200°C and maintained at this temperature for about 2 to 4 hrs.<br>
Further, according to the preferred embodiment of this invention, said monomer-II is added and the temperature is again raised to about 260°C and maintaining at this temperature for about 5 to 10 hrs, preferably for about 6 to 7 hrs, however, the present invention is not restricted by the time period for which the temperature of about 260°C is maintained, which will depend upon the copolymer required to be prepared.<br>
In accordance to one of the preferred embodiments of the presently disclosed method, if the step of opening of the cyclic oligomer of the oligomeric waste is avoided, it will result in preparation of homopolymers of the oligomeric waste, that is of nylon, and such homopolymerisation process.<br><br>

The said reactor is transferred preferably while hot and more preferably at a temperature of about 180°C, to a metal bath, where it is heated and continuously stirred at further increased temperature of about 250°C to 290°C, preferably about 270°C, which is attained in about 30 min and allowed to remain at this temperature for about 4 to 8 hrs, preferably about 6 hrs.<br>
In accordance to one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention, the last step of copolymerisation or the homopolymerisation processes, as described herein above, can be carried partially or completely under vacuum.<br>
In accordance to one of the preferred embodiments of the presently disclosed method, the said monomer-I is preferably diamine or diol, depending upon the desire of copolymerisation, which is added preferably after heating in a water bath. In accordance to another preferred embodiment of the presently disclosed method, the said monomer-II is preferably diacid.<br>

The copolymers or homopolymers in particular, or the polymers in general, obtained in accordance to the preferred embodiments of the process of the present invention have been characterised for their viscosity/molecular weight, weight loss on heating, melting point range and have been tested for end use application particularly for application as hot melt adhesive.<br>
The polymers, obtained in accordance to the preferred embodiments of the homopolymerisation process of the present invention have shown intrinsic viscosity, herein after referred to as IV of about 0.37 dl/gm, when process carried under normal pressure, which corresponds to a molecular weight of about 4275. The homopolymerisation employing said last step under low vacuum results in a little better IV of about 0.40 dl/gm, which corresponds to molecular weight of about 4800.<br>
The copolymers, obtained in accordance to the preferred embodiments of the copolymerisation process of the present invention employing said diol or diamine and said diacid have shown interesting trend in intrinsic viscosity, that is the copolymers of type N66-N6 (2:1) show IV of about 0.412 dl/gm, of type N66-N6 (1:1) show IV of<br><br>
about 0.413 dl/gm, of type N66-N6 (1:2) show IV of about 0.340 dl/gm, of type N66-N6 (1:3) show IV of about 0.260 dl/gm, of type PET-N6 (1:1) show IV of about 0.338 dl/gm, of type PET-N6 (1:2) show IV of about 0.280 dl/gm, of type PET-N6 (1:3) show IV of about 0.231 dl/gm, wherein the figures in brackets refer to the molar ratio of the respective component.<br>
The above data is evident that all the polymers could attain a reasonable IV appropriate for their application as hot melt adhesive, which has been tested and the inferences given herein below.<br>
The homopolymers, obtained in accordance to the preferred embodiments of the homopolymeristion process of the present invention have shown three step weight loss in the studied temperature range of 70 to 570°C. The first weight loss is less than 17% in the temperature range of 70 to 330°C, the second weight loss is less than 68% in the temperature range of 330 to 468°C, the third weight loss is less than 15% in the temperature range of 468 to 570°C.<br>
The copolymers, as obtained in accordance to the preferred embodiments of the copolymerisation process of the present invention employing said diamine and said diacid, resulting in copolymer of type N66-N6 (1:1), have also shown three step weight loss in the studied temperature range of 120 to 600°C. The first weight loss is less than 5% in the temperature range of 120 to 330°C, the second weight loss is less than 85% in the temperature range of 330 to 485°C, the third weight loss is less than 9.8% in the temperature range of 485 to 600°C. Similarly, the copolymers, obtained in accordance to the preferred embodiments of the copolymerisation process of the present invention employing said diol and said diacid, resulting in copolymer of type PET-N6 (1:1), have also shown three step weight loss in the studied temperature range of 70 to 570°C. The first weight loss is less than 10% in the temperature range of 70 to 330°C, the second<br><br>
weight loss is less than 72% in the temperature range of 330 to 480°C, the third weight loss is less than 19% in the temperature range of 480 to 570°C.<br>
The said homopolymer has shown a broad melting range from about 162 to 214°C. The broad peak in the DSC graph is attributed to a variety of mixed species including cyclic oligomeric present in the polymer. In hot melt adhesive, the presence of cyclic oligomers is advantageous, as it helps in increasing the flowability of the molten adhesive and also helps in lowering the melting point of the composition.<br>
The said copolymers have shown a relatively narrow letting range. The copolymer of type N66-N6 (2:1) has shown melting point range from about 145 to 187°C, copolymer of type N66-N6 (1:1) has shown melting point range from about 145 to 183°C, copolymer of type N66-N6 (1:2) has shown melting point range from about 128 to 172°C, copolymer of type N66-N6 (1:3) has shown melting point range from about 124 to 165°C, and copolymer of type PET-N6 (1:1) has shown melting point range from about 141 to 197°C, copolymer of type PET-N6 (1:2) has shown melting point range from about 134 to 181°C, copolymer of type PET-N6 (1:3) has shown melting point range from about 99 to 153°C.<br>
The melting point of the presently developed polymers has shown decreasing tend with the addition of oligomeric waste component.<br>
The polymers, as obtained in accordance to the preferred embodiments of the presently disclosed process of the present invention have been tested for end use application, particularly for application as hot melt adhesive by known method and lap shear and T-peel tests have been performed in the known manner. The polymers have shown better adhesive strength, whicn may be attributed to the regular structure of the prepared polymers.<br><br>
The presently disclosed invention has been described with a set of specific reaction for polymerization of oligomeric waste, whichis not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. It is obvious that, a minor modification in the reaction conditions of the presently disclosed set of specific reaction for polymerization of oligomeric waste of the presently disclosed invention is possible without deviating from the scope of the present invention.<br><br><br><br>
