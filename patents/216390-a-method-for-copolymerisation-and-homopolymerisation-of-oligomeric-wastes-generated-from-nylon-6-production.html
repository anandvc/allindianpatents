The copolymers or homopolymers in particular, or the polymers in general, obtained in accordance to the preferred embodiments of the process of the present invention have been characterised for their viscosity/molecular weight, weight loss on heating, melting point range and have been tested for end use application particularly for application as hot melt adhesive.<br>
The polymers, obtained in accordance to the preferred embodiments of the homopolymerisation process of the present invention have shown intrinsic viscosity, herein after referred to as IV of about 0.37 dl/gm, when process carried under normal pressure, which corresponds to a molecular weight of about 4275. The homopolymerisation employing said last step under low vacuum results in a little better IV of about 0.40 dl/gm, which corresponds to molecular weight of about 4800.<br>
The copolymers, obtained in accordance to the preferred embodiments of the copolymerisation process of the present invention employing said diol or diamine and said diacid have shown interesting trend in intrinsic viscosity, that is the copolymers of type N66-N6 (2:1) show IV of about 0.412 dl/gm, of type N66-N6 (1:1) show IV of<br><br>
about 0.413 dl/gm, of type N66-N6 (1:2) show IV of about 0.340 dl/gm, of type N66-N6 (1:3) show IV of about 0.260 dl/gm, of type PET-N6 (1:1) show IV of about 0.338 dl/gm, of type PET-N6 (1:2) show IV of about 0.280 dl/gm, of type PET-N6 (1:3) show IV of about 0.231 dl/gm, wherein the figures in brackets refer to the molar ratio of the respective component.<br>
The above data is evident that all the polymers could attain a reasonable IV appropriate for their application as hot melt adhesive, which has been tested and the inferences given herein below.<br>
The homopolymers, obtained in accordance to the preferred embodiments of the homopolymeristion process of the present invention have shown three step weight loss in the studied temperature range of 70 to 570째C. The first weight loss is less than 17% in the temperature range of 70 to 330째C, the second weight loss is less than 68% in the temperature range of 330 to 468째C, the third weight loss is less than 15% in the temperature range of 468 to 570째C.<br>
The copolymers, as obtained in accordance to the preferred embodiments of the copolymerisation process of the present invention employing said diamine and said diacid, resulting in copolymer of type N66-N6 (1:1), have also shown three step weight loss in the studied temperature range of 120 to 600째C. The first weight loss is less than 5% in the temperature range of 120 to 330째C, the second weight loss is less than 85% in the temperature range of 330 to 485째C, the third weight loss is less than 9.8% in the temperature range of 485 to 600째C. Similarly, the copolymers, obtained in accordance to the preferred embodiments of the copolymerisation process of the present invention employing said diol and said diacid, resulting in copolymer of type PET-N6 (1:1), have also shown three step weight loss in the studied temperature range of 70 to 570째C. The first weight loss is less than 10% in the temperature range of 70 to 330째C, the second<br><br>
weight loss is less than 72% in the temperature range of 330 to 480째C, the third weight loss is less than 19% in the temperature range of 480 to 570째C.<br>
The said homopolymer has shown a broad melting range from about 162 to 214째C. The broad peak in the DSC graph is attributed to a variety of mixed species including cyclic oligomeric present in the polymer. In hot melt adhesive, the presence of cyclic oligomers is advantageous, as it helps in increasing the flowability of the molten adhesive and also helps in lowering the melting point of the composition.<br>
The said copolymers have shown a relatively narrow letting range. The copolymer of type N66-N6 (2:1) has shown melting point range from about 145 to 187째C, copolymer of type N66-N6 (1:1) has shown melting point range from about 145 to 183째C, copolymer of type N66-N6 (1:2) has shown melting point range from about 128 to 172째C, copolymer of type N66-N6 (1:3) has shown melting point range from about 124 to 165째C, and copolymer of type PET-N6 (1:1) has shown melting point range from about 141 to 197째C, copolymer of type PET-N6 (1:2) has shown melting point range from about 134 to 181째C, copolymer of type PET-N6 (1:3) has shown melting point range from about 99 to 153째C.<br>
The melting point of the presently developed polymers has shown decreasing tend with the addition of oligomeric waste component.<br>
The polymers, as obtained in accordance to the preferred embodiments of the presently disclosed process of the present invention have been tested for end use application, particularly for application as hot melt adhesive by known method and lap shear and T-peel tests have been performed in the known manner. The polymers have shown better adhesive strength, whicn may be attributed to the regular structure of the prepared polymers.<br><br>
The presently disclosed invention has been described with a set of specific reaction for polymerization of oligomeric waste, whichis not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. It is obvious that, a minor modification in the reaction conditions of the presently disclosed set of specific reaction for polymerization of oligomeric waste of the presently disclosed invention is possible without deviating from the scope of the present invention.<br><br><br><br>
