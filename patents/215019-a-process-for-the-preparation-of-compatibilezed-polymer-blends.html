				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of a corapatibilized polymer blend. More particularly it relates to a process for the preparation of compatibilized blend of poly(phenylene sulphide) and an aliphatic-aromatic liquid crystalline polymer using a compatibilizer. The compatibilized blends prepared by the process of this invention are useful in high performance applications such as pump housings, gears, impellers. The compatibilized blends prepared by the process of this invention are new.<br>
Polymer blends are the resultant product of mixing two or more polymers. The conventional methods of mixing of the polymers to prepare polymer blends are solution or melt blending rather than physical blending of the individual polymers. The method of preparing the blend determines the resultant properties and hence is of paramount importance. Most polymers are not miscible and the blends are usually phase separated with the extent of phase separation dependent on the mixing mechanism and the ratio of the individual polymers that are used for the preparation of the blend. The immiscible polymers in certain cases can be made to form a miscible system with the use of modifiers called as compatibilizers. Another approach is by in situ chemical reaction during the process of blending.<br>
Compatibilizers for polymers could be defined as materials that induce miscibility of two thermodynamically immiscible polymers. Conventionally these materials comprise of block or graft copolymers with long segments or blocks that have<br><br>
characteristics of miscibility at the interface. The addition of compatibilizers reduces the interfacial energy between the immiscible phases and they also ensure finer dispersion when two immiscible phases are brought together during mixing operation. They also provide better stability against separation of the two phases and to increase the adhesion at phase boundaries giving improved stress transfer.<br>
Compatibilization of blend components is an important factor to be considered when designing blends and is often the primary criterion for commercial success.<br>
Blending of thermoplastic polymers are resorted when the resultant material can lead to easier processing and in situ matrix reinforcement in some cases depending on the choice of the polymers that are used for blending.<br>
An important reason in seeking new polymer blends is cost-effectiveness, coupled with synergistic improvement in the properties of the individual polymers.<br>
The use of liquid crystalline polymers in the preparation of blends has the following advantages :<br>
1. Since liquid crystalline polymers have very low thermal coefficient of expansion, the problem of mold shrinkage is greatly reduced. This factor also allows a high tolerance in molded components.<br><br>
2. The melt viscosity of liquid crystalline is low compared with the conventional thermoplastic polymers. Liquid crystalline polymers in blends therefore act as a processing aid thus acting as a viscosity modifier.<br>
Poly(phenylene sulphide) has very good thermal stability and chemical resistance, potentially important characteristics for an TLCP blend. TLCPs having excellent processing characteristics and mechanical properties. Poly(phenylene sulphide and TLCPs are high strength/high temperature speciality polymers that find applications in the electrical and electronic industries. However, TLCPs are generally incompatible with PPS. The properties of blends are strongly influenced by their morphology as a consequence of incompatibility and phase separation.<br>
The main object of this invention is to provide a process for the preparation of compatibilized polymer blends of PPS and a thermoplastic liquid polymer useful for high performance applications.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of compatibilized blend of poly(phenylene sulphide) and a thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of compatibilized blend of poly(phenylene sulphide) and a thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer using an aliphatic-aromatic compatibilizer.<br><br>
Accordingly,  the  invention  describes  a  process  for  the<br>
preparation of compatibilized polymer blends useful for high performance applications which comprises, melt blending poly(phenylene sulphide) and an aliphatic-aromatic liquid crystalline polymer of the kind such as herein described and the said poly(phenylene sulphide) to said aliphatic-aromatic liquid crystalline polymer being in the range form 97 to 10% in melt in a suitable blender in an inert atmosphere and in the presence of a compatibilizer such as herein described being in the range from 1 to 10% at a temperature in the range of 300 to 320°C, for a period ranging from 3 to 5 minutes, removing the compatibilized blend in the form of lumps and allowing the product to cool to ambient temperature or by extruding the blend to get the product in the form of strands or pellets.<br>
According   to   an   embodiment   of   the    invention,    the   inert   gas used could be  chosen  from nitrogen,   argon or  the  like.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, the compatibilizer used may be prepared as described and claimed in our copending application NF-147/97application no  <br>
According    to    yet    another    embodiment    of    the	invention,    the<br>

polyethylene        terephthalate-co-oxy        benzoate,	polybutylene<br>
terephthalate-co-  oxy benzoate polymers.<br>
