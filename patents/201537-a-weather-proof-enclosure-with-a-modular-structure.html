				<td>A WEATHER PROOF ENCLOSURE WITH A MODULAR STRUCTURE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to weatherproof enclosure with a modular structure suitable for outdoor use for accommodating equipments such as electrical, electronic parts, instruments, junctions, etc.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Enclosures are used for protecting, electrical junctions, switches, equipments, instruments, etc. from outdoor weathering conditions, thereby providing reliable service for the intended applications over an extended period of time requiring minimum maintenance.<br>
Metal enclosures are still widely used mostly of steel, aluminium or SS. Metal enclosures need frequent painting in addition to finishing, surface treatment, galvanizing, etc. to provide extended weathering ability.<br>
With wide acceptance of polymers, especially fibre reinforced polymer composites for outdoor use, several manufacturer's offer polymer enclosures.<br>
These enclosures primarily comprise of two members, one a side wall assembly or enclosure body with provision for housing the equipment to be protected and a door or cover to seal the contents in the body.<br>
The enclosure body is made with a integral continuous projection or tongue all around the upper periphery and the cover made with a matching integral continuous groove, fixed with a elastomeric seal preferably a seamless formed-in-place gasket. When the body and cover are held together by means of screws and nuts provided on the cover and body respectively or by means of hinges and fasteners, the elastomeric gasket gets compressed between the tongue and the groove and the enclosure gets sealed to achieve a high level of ingress protection.<br><br>
Medium to large enclosures with increasing size with respect to length, breadth and depth, such or similar integral body and cover designs become expensive, due to high cost of moulds, process equipment, processing and transportation cost,<br>
if Some manufacturers attempted to make such medium to large enclosures in modular design, wherein the body is assembled with standard modules having a bottom, top and at least two sides and fitted with an integral rear cover and hinged or removable integral front cover. In some cases, a common rear and front covers are used.<br>
The disadvantage in the above mentioned type of enclosure Is that though the tongue formed integrally out of sides, top and bottom part of ttie body, is not continuous at the junctions resulting in reduced the level of ingress protection. In addition, as the cover is integral with a continuous groove, and the body parts are mostly made individually for each size, the mould costs and associated processing costs are still high.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The principal object of tjiis invention is to provide a weattierproof enclosure with modular structure made of composite polymers or metals, capable of being assembled to a wide range of enclosure sizes made from simple, small accurate standard set of modules, or parts where each such assembled * enclosure has a matching continuous tongue and groove sealing arrangement in body and cover to obtain a high level of ingress protection.<br><br>
other objectives of the invention include:<br>
1)	Capability of assembling a wide variety of Enclosures with<br>
a)	door at either ends,<br>
b)	see through door,<br>
c)	two or more door on each end,<br>
d)	sloped roof,<br>
e)	large length, width and depth, etc.<br>
Such variety of capabilities are achieved with simple set of modules or parts.<br>
2)	Flexibility in design up-gradation due to modular design.<br>
3)	Max. standardization to reduce inventory.<br>
4)	Reduced capital costs in tools/moulds, processing equipments<br>
5)	Reduced packing cost and transportation costs.<br>
Other objects and further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description given herein, and it should be understood, however that the detailed description, while indicating preferred embodiments of the inventions, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirt and scope of the invention will beconne apparent from such description. Though the enclosure according to the invention can have three or more sides, the descriptions below is mainly directed to an enclosure with four sides for convenience.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides a weatherproof enclosure having a modular structure with following features:<br><br>
a) A plurality of elongated side wall straight panel members and at least one type side wall comer panel with a matching side wall corner stiffener. All such side wall straight panel members have same width, and differing lengths, with integral flanges on all four sides. All side wall straight panel members on the width-side preferably have same number of holes at constant pitch and the length-side have holes at regular pitch, with the number of holes var/ing depending on the lengtii along the length-side.<br>
The side wall corner panel member preferably has constant length and same width as that of the side wall straight panel members, has integral flanges on all four sides, one integral flange on the width-side has a comer with radius on the outside and with a flange having a thicker wall with integral metal nuts fonned below a boss along this wall and the number of metal nuts equal that of the number of holes on the width-side of side wall straight panel members. The holes on other width-side flange are equal to the number of metal nuts and the holes on the remaining two flanges match the straight panel length-side hole pitch.<br>
Each side wall comer panel member is provided with two integral pockets for hokling two metal nuts, and such pocket located behind the extreme length side holes adjacent to the integral metal nuts on both ends.<br>
A side wall comer panel stiffener member, shaped like an 'L' angle with holes to match each of the integral nuts, is made with a profile to frt inside the corresponding inner profile on the side wall comer panel member, provides rigidity and a flat surface to the side wall comer panel member when tightened against the width-side flange of ttie adjacent side wall straight panel member when a perpencficular joint is required, to form, the comers of<br><br>
the enclosure. The stiffener also retains the metal nuts provided in the two pocket of each side wall corner pane!. All above members are preferably provided with ribs to increase the rigidity and strength.<br>
The width of the side wall panel members to determine the depth of enclosure. Differing lengths of side wail straight panel members, and constant length of side wall corner panel members may be used to assemble the desired size of enclosures, with optimal number of members.<br>
The assembling of the enclosure is started by suitable selection of required types and quantity of side wall straight panel members and side wall corner panel members with stiffeners and metal nuts and joining each other with gaskets, nuts and bolts, to achieve the required length and width of the desired size of enclosure. The gasket used for sealing all the joints comprise of elastomeric or polymeric materials in suitable form.<br>
The side wall assembly of the enclosure thus formed is open at both ends and has flanges with holes at constant pitch all around the periphery in the front and rear and with nuts each retained in the respective pockets provided at each of the side wall comer panel members to receive the respective members to complete the endosure.<br>
To double the depth of the total enclosure, two such side wall assembly of the enclosure described above need to be connected to each other through the holes on peripheral flanges with gaskets, suitable nuts and bolts to make a side wall assembly of the enclosure with double depth. However care is taken to ensure that all the side wall comer panel members and side wall straight panel members are joined together in pairs first. Then the metal nuts are placed in the extreme available pockets, followed by placing the<br><br>
corresponding stiffeners and assembling all the other required side wall straight panel members together.<br>
To obtain different depths of enclosure, the width of the side wall panel members may be made with required widths,<br>
b) A plurality of elongated straight side wall frame members of different lengths, a side wall frame corner member and all each such part having a matching stiffener member.<br>
The different lengths are selected to match the desired range of enclosures sizes.<br>
All side wall frame members have similar outer and similar inner profile and each with flange on either end having matching holes and with provision for joining each other with nuts and bolts. All side wall frame members are provided on the inside with integral metal nuts below bosses spaced at intervals to match the holes pitch of the side wall panel length-side holes excepting one position at the perpendicular junction on side wall frame corner, which has a counter bore from the outside profile instead of a integral metal nut, to allow a bolt to go thm' and fasten on to the nut provided in the pocket on the corresponding position on the side wall comer panel, as access is not available from inside.<br>
All side wall frame members on the outer profile are provided with pips to indicate location of integral nuts below, such that when drilled at these required pips, the metal nut is exposed for fixing the hinge-lock mechanism, from the other end.<br>
As an alternate to providing the expensive integral metal nuts in all side wall frame members, a square or hexagonal recess or counter bore is provided on<br><br>
the outer profile, to later house a metal part with threadings, with access hole for joining to the side wall frame from inside with bolts. The other end of the metal nut is available for fixing required hinge-lock mechanism. All such joining done with seals or 'O' rings for ingress protection.<br>
Each of the side wall frame member is provided with a corresponding side wall frame stiffener member. The stiffener part is shaped like an 'L' angle with holes to match the pitch of the integral nuts and made with a profile to fit inside the inner profile of the corresponding side wall frame member, for increasing rigidity and to provide a continuous flat surface for sealing with gaskets when bolted down to the corresponding position on the peripheral flange, on the side wall panel assembly of the enclosure.<br>
When the required series of such side wall frame members of different lengths and four side wall frame corner members with their matching stiffeners are joined with each other by nuts, bolts and gasket and such complete side wall frame assembly when joined by bolting and gaskets to the peripheral flange on the side wall panel assembly of the enclosure, a side wall assembly of the enclosure with a continuous tongue is formed, such assembly can be done on both ends to provide for enclosures with doors at both ends.<br>
c) A door frame assembly comprising plurality of straight door frame members of different lengths and same width to suit the desired size of the door assembly and door frame corner members.<br>
Each of such door frame member is provided with a flange at both ends with matching holes to join with each other, and have a similar outer profile, and on the inside integral metal nuts are provided at equal intervals in two rows, one row on the inside for bolting down a plane sheet of metal or composite or a transparent polymer v\?jth steel clamping members, and another row on<br><br>
the outside along wiOi two slot profiles for damping a steel or composite stiffening members along with the hinges and multi-point locking mechanism at required locations.<br>
The outer row of metal nut pitch match the hole-pitch of all side wall panel length-side hole-pitch, and in between these two rows of integral nuts, each of these door frame members have a groove profile matching the tongue profile on the side wall frame member.<br>
Each stiffening member connects all the door frame members together in each length-side and width-side direction. When they are bolted down to the integral metal nuts on each door frame member, and they themselves get bolted together on the integral metal nut at the perpendicular junction of each door frame comer, providing the necessary stiffness for the door frame. As the hinge-lock mechanism are located outside of the tongue and groove sealing area &amp; results in avoidance of extra care for sealing such joints to avoid ingress protection. The steel members, hinge-lock mechanism, etc. are well known and is not elaborated more.<br>
A plurality of such door frame members to complete the required door frame assembly when joined to each other with gaskets, nut and bolts and damped on to the steel stiffening members all around forms a rigid complete door frame assembly, having a continuous groove profile to match the continuous tongue profile described eariier. An elastomeric gasket either a foamed-in-place or profiled elastomeric seal is placed^ in this continuous groove. On this door frame assembly, a sheet of metal or a composite polymer Is clamped on to the inner row of nuts wilti gaskets and steel or composite clamping members all around with sealing gaskets. Rnally, the required hinges and one part of kxking mechanism is joined on to the outer row of nuts over the stiffening mannbers, providing the door assembly.<br><br>
d)	The side wall assembly of the enclosure with a continuous tongue when fitted<br>
with a complete door, without hinge-lock mechanism, elastomeric seal and<br>
steel stiffening members on the rear peripheral end with gaskets, and bolted<br>
rigidly to the rear peripheral flange, a side wall assembly of the enclosure is<br>
formed with a fixed rear door. However, care is taken at the four corners of<br>
door assembly .where the metal inserts are opened through from inside and a<br>
counter bore provided such that a bolt can pass through the metal nut and<br>
directly screw on to the metal nut provided in the pockets of the corner side<br>
wall.<br>
Alternatively, a plane sheet of metal or composite polymer when directly fixed with nuts, bolts and gaskets on to the rear peripheral flange of the side wall of the enclosure provides side wall assembly of the enclosure with a less expensive plane rear cover.<br>
e)	The side wall assembly of the enclosure as described above when joined to a<br>
complete door with bolts at the corresponding hinge point locations, on the<br>
side wall frame assembly and also the other part of locking mechanism fitted<br>
at corresponding locations on the opposite ends of the side wall frame<br>
assembly at matching locations, or fitted with screws rigidly bolted on the<br>
body at required intervals then an enclosure of desired size is achieved with a<br>
hinged door or screw down door.<br>
If a side wall assembly of the enclosure with continuous tongue on both ends is fitted with a door assembly, then a complete desired enclosure is achieved having doors at both ends.<br>
f)	Variants in the side wall straight panel members with a tapered profile when<br>
joined to a side wall panel assembly of the enclosure at the top and fitted<br>
with all other members as described, provide an enclosure with a tapered<br>
roof.<br><br>
g) Special V angle profile members of different lengths when bolted on at the bottom of side wall and with ail other members as described produce enclosures that have complete bottom opening for cable entry, as desired.<br>
h) Special contoured L angle of composites or metal equal to the width of enclosure is clamped on the side wall frame top end with gaskets at required interval through the opened pip ends of the integral metal nuts provide a shade or prevent accumulation of dust, water, etc, on junction of door frame and side wall frame at the top portion of the enclosure.<br>
i) An enclosure of required longer length, width or depth called as cabinet type enclosures are joined with a series of standard members as required or specially made longer straight lengths of side wall straight panels, door frame and side wall frame members with corresponding stiffeners to reduce ttie number of members, resulting in fewer joints and cost. The Body of such large cabinets if necessary, are provided extra rigidity by suitably clamping stiffening members of steel or composite polymer profiles at the various existing bolting points at the required lengths and widths inside tine enclosure.<br>
j) A locking mechanism provided on ail three sides of the door except the hinge side for wider and longer doors to ensure adequate ingress protection of larger enclosures, as required.<br>
k) Variants in the side wall corner panel members called as middle corner support members of suitable width are used for accommodating two doors side by side, and with length equal to the width of regular side wall comer panel members, and middle straight support members of width equal to side wall comer panel member and different lengths equal to the standard side<br><br>
wall straight panel members when joined together either or. front or rear from bottom to top provide necessar/ peripheral flange for mounting t//o independent door assemblies.<br>
Alternatively, the two independent door assemblies can be provided using only the middle straight support members at the top and bottom instead of a middle corner support members and joined along with a 'C type side wall corner panel members for providing the corners.<br>
