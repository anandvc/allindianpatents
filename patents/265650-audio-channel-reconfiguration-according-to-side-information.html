Description<br>
Channel Reconfiguration with Side Information<br>
Background Art<br>
With the widespread adoption of DVD players, the utilization of multichannel<br>
(greater than two channels) audio playback systems in the home has become<br>
commonplace. In addition, multichannel audio systems are becoming more prevalent<br>
in the automobile and next generation satellite and terrestrial digital radio systems are<br>
eager to deliver multichannel content to a growing number of multichannel playback<br>
environments. In many cases, however, would-be providers of multichannel content<br>
face a dearth of such material. For example, most popular music still exists as two-<br>
channel stereophonic ("stereo") tracks only. As such, there is a demand to "upmix"<br>
such "legacy" content that exists in either monophonic ("mono") or stereo format into<br>
a multichannel format.<br>
Prior art solutions exist for achieving this transformation. For example, Dolby<br>
Pro Logic II can take an original stereo recording and generate a multichannel upmix<br>
based on steering information derived from the stereo recording itself. "Dolby", "Pro<br>
Logic", and "Pro Logic II" are trademarks of Dolby Laboratories Licensing<br>
Corporation. In order to deliver such an upmix to a consumer, a content provider may<br>
apply an upmixing solution to the legacy content during production and then transmit<br>
the resulting multichannel signal to a consumer through some suitable multichannel<br>
delivery format such as Dolby Digital. "Dolby Digital" is a trademark of Dolby<br>
Laboratories Licensing Corporation. Alternatively, the unaltered legacy content may<br>
be delivered to a consumer who may then apply the upmixing process during<br>
playback. In the former case, the content provider has complete control over the<br>
manner in which the upmix is created, which, from the content provider's viewpoint,<br>
is desirable. In addition, processing constraints at the production side are generally<br>
far less than at the playback side and, therefore, the possibility of using more<br>
sophisticated upmixing techniques exists. However, upmixing at the production side<br>
has some drawbacks. First of all, transmission of a multichannel signal in comparison<br>
to a legacy signal is more expensive due to the increased number of audio channels.<br>
Also, if a consumer does not possess a multichannel playback system, the transmitted<br>
multichannel signal typically needs to be downmixed before playback. This<br><br>
WO 2006/132857	PCT/US2006/020882<br>
-2-<br>
downmixed signal, in general, is not identical to the original legacy content and may<br>
in many cases sound inferior to the original.<br>
FIGS. 1 and 2 depict examples of prior art upmixing applied at the production<br>
and consumption ends, respectively, as just described. These examples assume that<br>
the original signal contains M=2 channels and that the upmixed signal contains N=6<br>
channels. In the example of FIG. 1, upmixing is performed at the production end,<br>
whereas in FIG. 2, upmixing is performed at the consumption end. An upmixing as in<br>
FIG. 2, in which the upmixer receives only the audio signals upon which it is to<br>
perform an upmix is sometimes referred to as a "blind" upmix.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, in the Production portion 2 of an audio system, one or<br>
more audio signals constituting M-Channel Original Signals (in this and other figures<br>
herein, each audio signal may represent a channel, such as a left channel, a right<br>
channel, etc.) are applied to an upmix device or upmixing function ("Upmix") 4 that<br>
produces an increased number of audio signals constituting N-Channel Upmix Signals.<br>
The Upmix Signals are applied to a formatter device or formatting function<br>
("Format3') 6 that formats the N-Channel Upmix Signals into a form suitable for<br>
transmission or storage. The formatting may include data-compression encoding.<br>
The formatted signals are received by the Consumption portion 8 of the audio system<br>
in which a deformatting function or deformatter device ("Deformat") 10 restores the<br>
formatted signals to the N-Channel Upmix Signals (or an approximation of them). As<br>
discussed above, in some cases a downmixer device or downmixing function<br>
("Downmix") 12 also downmixes the N-Channel Upmix signals to M-Channel<br>
Downmix Signals (or an approximation of them), where M<n.></n.>
Referring to FIG. 2, in the Production portion 14 of an audio system, one or<br>
more audio signals constituting M-Channel Original Signals are applied to a formatter<br>
device or formatting function ("Format") 6 that formats them into a form suitable for<br>
transmission or storage (in this and other figures, the same reference numeral is used<br>
for devices and functions that are essentially the same in different figures). The<br>
formatting may include data-compression encoding. The formatted signals are<br>
received by the Consumption portion 16 of the audio system in which a deformatter<br>
function or deformatting device ("Deformat") 10 restores the formatted signals to the<br>
M-Channel Original Signals (or an approximation of them). The M-Channel Original<br>
Signals may be provided as an output and they are also applied to an upmixer function<br><br>
WO 2006/132857	PCT/US2006/020882<br>
-3-<br>
or upmixing device ("Upmix") 18 that upmixes the M-Channel Original Signals to<br>
produce N-Channel Upmix Signals.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Aspects of the present invention provide alternatives to the arrangements of<br>
FIGS. 1 and 2. For example, according to certain aspects of the present invention,<br>
rather than upmixing the legacy content at either the production or consumption end,<br>
analysis of the legacy content by a process at, for example, an encoder may generate<br>
auxiliary, "side," or "sidechain" information that is sent along, in some manner, with<br>
the legacy content audio information to a further process at, for example, a decoder.<br>
The manner in which the side information is sent is not critical to the invention; many<br>
ways of sending side information are known, including, for example, embedding the<br>
side information in the audio information (e.g., hiding it) or by sending the side<br>
information separately (e.g., in its own bitstream or multiplexed with the audio<br>
information). "Encoder" and "decoder" in this context refer, respectively, to a device<br>
or process associated with production and a device or process associated with<br>
consumption - such devices and processes may or may not include data compression<br>
"encoding" and "decoding." Side information generated by an encoder may instruct<br>
the decoder how to upmix the legacy content. Thus, the decoder provides upmixing<br>
with the help of side information. Although control of the upmix technique may lie at<br>
the production end, the consumer may still receive unaltered legacy content that may<br>
be played back unaltered if a multichannel playback system is not available. In<br>
addition, significant processing power may be utilized at an encoder to analyze the<br>
legacy content and generate side information for a high quality upmix, allowing the<br>
decoder to employ significantly fewer processing resources because it only applies the<br>
side information rather than deriving it. Lastly, transmission cost of such upmix side<br>
information is typically very low.<br>
Although the present invention and its various aspects may involve analog or<br>
digital signals, in practical applications most or all processing functions are likely to<br>
be performed in the digital domain on digital signal streams in which audio signals are<br>
represented by samples. Signal processing according to the present invention may be<br>
applied either to wideband signals or to each frequency band of a multiband processor,<br>
and depending on implementation, may be performed once per sample or once per set<br>
of samples, such as a block of samples when the digital audio is divided into blocks.<br><br>
WO 2006/132857	PCT/US2006/020882<br>
-4-<br>
A multiband embodiment may employ either a filter bank or a transform<br>
configuration. Thus, the examples of embodiments of the present invention shown<br>
and described in connection with FIGS. 3,4A-4C, 5A-5C, and 6 may receive digital<br>
signals in the time domain (such as, for example, PCM signals) and apply them to a<br>
suitable thne-to-frequency converter or conversion for processing in multiple<br>
frequency bands, which bands may be related to critical bands of the human ear.<br>
After processing, the signals may be converted back to the time-domain. In principle,<br>
either a filterbank or a transform may be employed to achieve time-to-frequency<br>
conversion and its inverse. Some detailed examples of embodiments of aspects of the<br>
invention described herein employ time-to-frequency transforms, namely the Short-<br>
time Discrete Fourier Transform (STDFT). It will be appreciated, however, that the<br>
invention in its various aspects is not limited to the use of any particular time-to-<br>
frequency converter or conversion process.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a method for<br>
processing at least one audio signal or a modification of the at least one audio signal<br>
having the same number of channels as the at least one audio signal, each audio signal<br>
representing an audio channel comprises deriving instructions for channel<br>
reconfiguring the at least one audio signal or its modification, wherein the only audio<br>
information that the deriving receives is the at least one audio signal or its<br>
modification, and providing an output that includes (1) the at least one audio signal or<br>
its modification, and (2) the instructions for channel reconfiguring, but does not<br>
include any channel reconfiguration of the at least one audio signal or its modification<br>
when such a channel reconfiguration results from the instructions for channel<br>
reconfiguring. The at least one audio signal and its modification may each be two or<br>
more audio signals, in which case, the modified two or more signals may be a matrix-<br>
encoded modification, and, when decoded, as by a matrix decoder or an active matrix<br>
decoder, the modified two or more audio signals may provide an improved<br>
multichannel decoding with respect to a decoding of the unmodified two or more<br>
audio signals. The decoding is "improved" in the sense of any well-known<br>
performance characteristics of decoders such as matrix decoders, including, for<br>
example channel separation, spatial imaging, image stability, etc.<br>
Whether or not the at least one audio signal and its modification are two or<br>
more audio signals, there are several alternatives for channel reconfiguring<br><br>
WO 2006/132857	PCT/US2006/020882<br>
-5-<br>
instructions. According to one alternative, the instructions are for upmixing the at<br>
least one audio signal or its modification such that, when upmixed in accordance with<br>
the instructions for upmixing, the resulting number of audio signals is greater than the<br>
number of audio signals comprising the at least one audio signal or its modification.<br>
According to other alternatives for channel reconfiguring instructions, the at least one<br>
audio signal and its modification are two or more audio signals. In a first of such<br>
other alternatives, the instructions are for downmixing the two or more audio signals<br>
such that, when downmixed in accordance with the instructions for downmixing, the<br>
resulting number of audio signals is less than the number of audio signals comprising<br>
the two or more audio signals. In a second of such other alternatives, the instructions<br>
are for reconfiguring the two or more audio signals such that, when reconfigured in<br>
accordance with the instructions for reconfiguring, the number of audio signals<br>
remains the same but one or more spatial locations at which such audio signals are<br>
intended to be reproduced are changed. The at least one audio signal or its<br>
modification in the output may be a data-compressed version of the at least one audio<br>
signal or its modification, respectively.<br>
In any of the alternatives and whether or not data compression is employed,<br>
instructions may be derived without reference to any channel reconfiguration resulting<br>
from the instructions for channel reconfiguring. The at least one audio signal may be<br>
divided into frequency bands and the instructions for channel reconfiguring may be<br>
with respect to respective ones of such frequency hands. Other aspects of the<br>
invention include audio encoders practicing such methods.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, a method for processing at least<br>
one audio signal or a modification of the at least one audio signal having the same<br>
number of channels as the at least one audio signal, each audio signal representing an<br>
audio channel, comprises deriving instructions for channel reconfiguring the at least<br>
one audio signal or its modification, wherein the only audio information that the<br>
deriving receives is the at least one audio signal or its modification, providing an<br>
output that includes (1) the at least one audio signal or its modification, and (2) the<br>
instructions for channel reconfiguring but does not include any channel<br>
reconfiguration of the at least one audio signal or its modification when such a<br>
channel reconfiguration results from the instructions for channel reconfiguring, and<br>
receiving the output.<br><br>
WO 2006/132857	PCT/US2006/020882<br>
-6-<br>
The method may further comprise channel reconfiguring the received at least<br>
one audio signal or its modification using the received instructions for channel<br>
reconfiguring. The at least one audio signal and its modification may each be two or<br>
more audio signals, in which case, the modified two or more signals may be a matrix-<br>
encoded modification, and, when decoded, as by a matrix decoder or an active matrix<br>
decoder, the modified two or more audio signals may provide an improved<br>
multichannel decoding with respect to the decoding of the unmodified two or more<br>
audio signals. "Improved" is used in the same sense as in the first aspect of the<br>
present invention, described above.<br>
As in the first aspect of the invention, there are alternatives for channel<br>
reconfiguring instructions - for example, upmixing, downmixing, and reconfiguring<br>
such that the number of audio signals remains the same but one or more spatial<br>
locations at which such audio signals are intended to be reproduced are changed. As<br>
in the first aspect of the invention, the at least one audio signal or its modification in<br>
the output may be a data-compressed version of the at least one audio signal or its<br>
modification, in which case the receiving may include data decompressing the at least<br>
one audio signal or its modification. In any of the alternatives of this aspect of the<br>
present invention, whether or not data compression and decompression is employed,<br>
instructions may be derived without reference to any channel reconfiguration resulting<br>
from the instructions for channel reconfiguring.<br>
As in the first aspect of the invention, the at least one audio signal or its<br>
modification may be divided into frequency bands, in which case the instructions for<br>
channel reconfiguring may be with respect to ones of such frequency bands. When<br>
the method further comprises reconfiguring the received at least one audio signal or<br>
its modification using the received instructions for channel reconfiguring, the method<br>
may yet further comprise providing an audio output and selecting as the audio output<br>
one of: (1) the at least one audio signal or its modification, or (2) the channel-<br>
reconfigured at least one audio signal.<br>
Whether or not the method further comprises reconfiguring the received at<br>
least one audio signal or its modification using the received instructions for channel<br>
reconfiguring, the method may further comprise providing an audio output in<br>
response to the received at least one audio signal or its modification, in which case<br>
when the at least one audio signal or its modification in the audio output are two or<br><br>
WO 2006/132857	PCT/US2006/020882<br>
- 7 -<br>
more audio signals, the method may yet further comprise matrix decoding the two or<br>
more audio signals.<br>
When the method further comprises reconfiguring the received at least one<br>
audio signal or its modification using the received instructions for channel<br>
reconfiguring, the method may yet further comprise providing an audio output.<br>
Other aspects of the invention include an audio encoding and decoding system<br>
practicing such methods, an audio encoder and an audio decoder for use in a system<br>
practicing such methods, an audio encoder for use in a system practicing such<br>
methods, and an audio decoder for use in a system practicing such methods.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a method for processing at<br>
least one audio signal or a modification of the at least one audio signal having the<br>
same number of channels as said at least one audio signal, each audio signal<br>
representing an audio channel, comprises receiving at least one audio signal or its<br>
modification and instructions for channel reconfiguring the at least one audio signal or<br>
its modification but no channel reconfiguration of the at least one audio signal or its<br>
modification resulting from said instructions for channel reconfiguring, said<br>
instructions having been derived by an instruction derivation in which the only audio<br>
information received is said at least one audio signal or its modification, and channel<br>
reconfiguring the at least one audio signal or its modification using said instructions.<br>
The at least one audio signal and its modification may each be two or more audio<br>
signals, in which case, the modified two or more signals may be a matrix-encoded<br>
modification, and, when decoded, as by a matrix decoder or an active matrix decoder,<br>
the modified two or more audio signals may provide an improved multichannel<br>
decoding with respect to the decoding of the unmodified two or more audio signals.<br>
"Improved" is used in the same sense as in the other aspects of the present invention,<br>
described above.<br>
As in other aspects of the invention, there are alternatives for channel<br>
reconfiguring instructions - for example, upmixing, downmixing, and reconfiguring<br>
such that the number of audio signals remains the same but one or more spatial<br>
locations at which such audio signals are intended to he reproduced are changed.<br>
As in the other aspects of the invention, the at least one audio signal or its<br>
modification in the output may be a data-compressed version of the at least one audio<br>
signal or its modification, in which case the receiving may include data<br><br>
WO 2006/132857	PCT/US2006/020882<br>
-8-<br>
decompressing the at least one audio signal or its modification. In any of the<br>
alternatives of this aspect of the present invention, whether or not data compression<br>
and decompression is employed, instructions may be derived without reference to any<br>
channel reconfiguration resulting from the instructions for channel reconfiguring. As<br>
in the other aspects of the invention, the at least one audio signal or its modification<br>
may be divided into frequency bands, in which case the instructions for channel<br>
reconfiguring may be with respect to ones of such frequency bands. According to one<br>
alternative, this aspect of the invention may further comprise providing an audio<br>
output, and selecting as the audio output one of: (1) the at least one audio signal or its<br>
modification, or (2) the channel reconfigured at least one audio signal. According to<br>
another alternative, this aspect of the invention may further comprise providing an<br>
audio output in response to the received at least one audio signal or its modification,<br>
in which case the at least one audio signal and its modification may each be two or<br>
more audio signals and the two or more audio signals are matrix decoded. According<br>
to yet another alternative, this aspect of the invention may further comprise providing<br>
an audio output in response to the received channel-reconfigured at least one audio<br>
signal. Other aspects of the invention include an audio decoder practicing any of such<br>
methods.<br>
In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention, a method for<br>
processing at least two audio signals or a modification of the at least two audio signals<br>
having the same number of channels as said at least one audio signal, each audio<br>
signal representing an audio channel, comprises receiving said at least two audio<br>
signals and instructions for channel reconfiguring the at least two audio signals but no<br>
channel reconfiguration of the at least two audio signals resulting from said<br>
instructions for channel reconfiguring, said instructions having been derived by a an<br>
instruction derivation in which the only audio information received is said at least two<br>
audio signals, and matrix decoding the two or more audio signals. The matrix<br>
decoding may be with or without reference to the received instructions. When<br>
decoded, the modified two or more audio signals may provide an improved<br>
multichannel decoding with respect to the decoding of the unmodified two or more<br>
audio signals. The modified two or more signals may be a matrix-encoded<br>
modification, and, when decoded, as by a matrix decoder or an active matrix decoder,<br>
the modified two or more audio signals may provide an improved multichannel<br><br>

decoding with respect to the decoding of the unmodified two or more audio signals.<br>
"Improved" is used in the same sense as in other aspects of the present invention,<br>
described above. Other aspects of the invention include an audio decoder practicing<br>
any of such methods.<br>
In yet further aspects of the invention, two or more audio signals, each audio<br>
signal representing an audio channel, are modified so that the modified signals may<br>
provide an improved multichannel decoding, with respect to a decoding of the<br>
unmodified signals, when decoded by a matrix decoder. This may be accomplished<br>
by modifying one or more differences in intrinsic signal characteristics between or<br>
among the audio signals. Such intrinsic signal characteristics may include one or both<br>
of amplitude and phase. Modifying one or more differences in intrinsic signal<br>
characteristics between or among ones of the audio signals may include upmixing the<br>
unmodified signals to a larger number of signals, and downmixing the upmixed<br>
signals using a matrix encoder. Alternatively, modifying one or more differences in<br>
intrinsic signal characteristics between or among the audio signals may also include<br>
increasing or decreasing the cross correlation between or among ones of the audio<br>
signals. The cross correlation between or among the audio signals may be variously<br>
increased and / or decreased in one or more frequency bands.<br>
Other aspects of the invention include (1) apparatus adapted to perform the<br>
methods of any one of herein described methods, (2) a computer program, stored on a<br>
computer-readable medium, for causing a computer to perform any one of the herein<br>
described methods, (3) a bitstream produced by ones of the herein described methods,<br>
and a (4) bitstream produced by apparatus adapted to perform the methods of ones of<br>

Description of the Invention<br>
FIG. 3 depicts an example of aspects of the invention in an upmixing<br>
arrangement. In the Production 20 portion of the arrangement, M-Channel Original<br>
Signals (e.g., legacy audio signals) are applied to a device or function that derives one<br>
or more sets of upmix side information ("Derive Upmix Information") 21 and to a<br>
formatter device or formatting function ("Format") 22. Alternatively, the M-Channel<br>
Original Signals of FIG. 3 may be a modified version of the legacy audio signals, as<br>
described below. Format 22 may include a multiplexer or multiplexing function, for<br>
example, that formats or arranges the M-Channel Original Signals, the upmix side<br>
information, and other data into, for example, a serial bitstream or parallel bitstreams.<br>
Whether the output bitstream of the Production 20 portion of the arrangement is serial<br>
or parallel is not critical to the invention. Format 22 may also include a suitable data-<br>
compression encoder or encoding function such as a lossy, lossless, or a combination<br>
lossy and lossless encoder or encoding function. Whether the output bitstream or<br>
bitstreams are encoded is also not critical to the invention. The output bitstream or<br>
bitstreams are transmitted or stored in any suitable manner.<br>
In the Consumption 24 portion of the arrangement of the example of FIG. 3,<br>
the output bitstream or bitstreams are received and a deformatter or deformatting<br>
function ("Deformat") 26 undoes the action of the Format 22 to provide the M-<br>
Channel Original Signals (or an approximation of them) and the upmix information.<br>
Deformat 26 may include, as may be necessary, a suitable data-compression decoder<br>
or decoding function. The upmix information and the M-Channel Original Signals (or<br>
an approximation of them) are applied to an upmixer device or upmixing function<br><br>
WO 2006/132857	PCT/US2006/020882<br>
-12-<br>
('Upmix") 28 that upmixes the M-Channel Original Signals (or an approximation of<br>
them) in accordance with the upmix instructions to provide N-Channel Upmix Signals.<br>
There may be multiple sets of upmix instructions, each providing, for example, an<br>
upmixing to a different number of channels. If there are multiple sets of upmix<br>
instructions, one or more sets are chosen (such choice may be fixed in the<br>
Consumption portion of the arrangement or it may be selectable in some manner).<br>
The M-Channel Original Signals and the N-Channel Upmix Signals are potential<br>
outputs of the Consumption 24 portion of the arrangement Either or both may be<br>
provided as outputs (as shown) or one or the other may be selected, the selection<br>
being implemented by a selector or selection function (not shown) under automatic<br>
control or manual control, for example, by a user or consumer. Although FIG. 3<br>
shows symbolically that M=2 and N=6, it will be understood that M and N are not<br>
limited thereto.<br>
In one example of a practical application of aspects of the present invention,<br>
two audio signals, representing respective stereo sound channels are received by a<br>
device or process and it is desired to derive instructions suitable for use in upmixing<br>
those two audio signals to what is typically referred to as "5.1" channels (actually, six<br>
channels, in which one channel is a low-frequency effects channel requiring very little<br>
data). The original two audio signals along with the upmixing instructions may then<br>
be sent to an upmixer or upmixing process that applies the upmixing instructions to<br>
the two audio signals in order to provide the desired 5.1 channels (an upmix<br>
employing side information). However, in some cases the original two audio signals<br>
and related upmixing instructions may be received by a device or process that may be<br>
incapable of using the upmixing instructions but, nevertheless, it may be adapted to<br>
performing an upmix of the received two audio signals, an upmix that is often referred<br>
to as a "blind" upmix, as mentioned above. Such blind upmixes may be provided, for<br>
example, by an active matrix decoder such as a Pro Logic, Pro Logic II, or Pro Logic<br>
IIx decoder (Pro Logic, Pro Logic II, and Pro Logic IIx are trademarks of Dolby<br>
Laboratories Licensing Corporation). Other active matrix decoders may be employed.<br>
Such active matrix blind upmixers depend on and operate in response to intrinsic<br>
signal characteristics (such as amplitude and/or phase relationships among signals<br>
applied to it) to perform an upmix. A blind upmix may or may not result in the same<br>
number of channels as would have been provided by a device or function adapted to<br><br>
WO 2006/132857	PCT/US2006/020882<br>
-13-<br>
use the upmix instructions (e.g., in this example, a blind upmix might not result in 5.1<br>
channels).<br>
A "blind" upmix performed by an active matrix decoder is best when its inputs<br>
were pre-encoded by a device or function compatible with the active matrix decoder<br>
such as by a matrix encoder, particularly a matrix encoder complementary to the<br>
decoder. In that case, the input signals have intrinsic amplitude and phase<br>
relationships that are used by the active matrix decoder. A "blind" upmix of signals<br>
that were not pre-encoded by a compatible device, such signals not having useful<br>
intrinsic signal characteristics (or having only minimally useful intrinsic signal<br>
characteristics), such as amplitude or phase relationships, is best performed by what<br>
may be termed an "artistic" upmixer, typically a computationally complex upmixer,<br>
as discussed further below.<br>
Although aspects of the invention may be advantageously used for upmixing,<br>
they apply to the more general case in which at least one audio signal designed for a<br>
particular "channel configuration" is altered for playback over one or more alternate<br>
channel configurations. An encoder, for example, generates side information that<br>
instructs a decoder, for example, how to alter the original signal, if desired, for one or<br>
more alternate channel configurations. "Channel configuration" in this context<br>
includes, for example, not only the number of playback audio signals relative to the<br>
original audio signals but also the spatial locations at which playback audio signals<br>
are intended to be reproduced with respect to the spatial locations of the original audio<br>
signals. Thus, a channel "reconfiguration" may include, for example, "upmixing" in<br>
which one or more channels are mapped in some manner to a larger number of<br>
channels, "downmixing" in which two or more channels are mapped in some manner<br>
to a smaller number of channels, spatial location reconfiguration in which that<br>
locations at which channels are intended to be reproduced or directions with which<br>
channels are associated are changed or remapped in some manner, and conversion<br>
from binaural to loudspeaker format (by crosstalk cancellation or processing with a<br>
crosstalk canceller) or from loudspeaker format to binaural (by "binauralization" or<br>
processing by a loudspeaker format to binaural converter, a "binauralizer"). Thus, in<br>
the context of channel reconfiguration according to aspects of the present invention,<br>
the number of channels in the original signal may be less than, greater than, or equal<br>
to the number of channels in any of the resulting alternate channel configurations.<br><br>
WO 2006/132857	PCT/US2006/020882<br>
-14-<br>
An example of a spatial location configuration is a conversion from a<br>
quadraphonic configuration (a "square" layout with left front, right front, left rear and<br>
right rear) to a conventional motion picture configuration (a "diamond" layout, with<br>
left front, center front, right front and surround).<br>
An example of a non-upmixing "reconfiguration" application of aspects of the<br>
present invention is described in U.S. Patent Application S.N. 10/911,404 of Michael<br>
John Smithers, filed August 3,2004, entitled "Method for Combining Audio Signals<br>
Using Auditory Scene Analysis." Smithers describes a technique for dynamically<br>
downmixing signals in a way that avoids common comb filtering and phase<br>
cancellation effects associated with a static downmix. For example, an original signal<br>
may consist of left, center, and right channels, but in many playback environments a<br>
center channel is not available, in this case, the center channel signal needs to be<br>
mixed into the left and right for playback in stereo. The method disclosed by<br>
Smithers dynamically measures during playback an average overall delay between the<br>
center channel and the left and right channels. A corresponding compensating delay<br>
is then applied to the center channel before it is mixed with the left and right channels<br>
in order to avoid comb filtering. In addition, a power compensation is computed for<br>
and applied to each critical band of each downmixed channel in order to remove other<br>
phase cancellation effects. Rather than compute such delay and power compensation<br>
values during playback, the current invention allows for their generation as side<br>
information at an encoder, and then the values may be optionally applied at a decoder<br>
if playback over a conventional stereo configuration is required.<br>
FIG. 4A depicts an example of aspects of the invention in a generalized<br>
channel reconfiguration arrangement. In the Production 30 portion of the<br>
arrangement, M-Channel Original Signals (legacy audio signals) are applied to a<br>
device or function that derives one or more sets of channel reconfiguration side<br>
information ("Derive Channel Reconfiguration Information") 32 and to a formatter<br>
device or formatting function ("Format") 22 (described in connection with the<br>
example of FIG. 3). The M-Channel Original Signals of FIG. 4A may be a modified<br>
version of the legacy audio signals, as described below. The output bitstream or<br>
bitstreams are transmitted or stored in any suitable manner.<br>
In the Consumption portion 34 of the arrangement, the output bitstream or<br>
bitstreams are received and a deformatter device or deformatting function<br><br>
WO 2006/132857	PCT/US2006/020882<br>
-15-<br>
("Deformat") 26 (described in connection with FIG. 3) undoes the action of the<br>
Format 22 to provide the M-Channel Original Signals (or an approximation of them)<br>
and the channel reconfiguration information. The channel reconfiguration<br>
information and the M-Channel Original Signals (or an approximation of them) are<br>
applied to a device or function ("Reconfigure Channels") 36 that channel reconfigures<br>
the M-Channel Original Signals (or an approximation of them) in accordance with the<br>
instructions to provide N-Channel Reconfigured Signals. As in the FIG. 3 example, if<br>
there are multiple sets of instructions, one or more sets are chosen ("Select Channel<br>
Reconfiguration") (such choice may be fixed in the Consumption portion of the<br>
arrangement or it may be selectable in some manner). As in the FIG. 3 example, the<br>
M-Channel Original Signals and the N-Channel Reconfigured Signals are potential<br>
outputs of the Consumption portion 34 of the arrangement. Either or both may be<br>
provided as outputs (as shown) or one or the other may be selected, the selection<br>
being implemented by a selector or selection function (not shown) under automatic or<br>
manual control, for example, by a user or consumer. Although FIG. 4A shows<br>
symbolically that M=3 and N=2, it will be understood that M and N are not limited<br>
thereto. As noted above, the "channel reconfiguration" may include, for example,<br>
"upmixing" in which one or more channels are mapped in some manner to a larger<br>
number of channels, "downmixing" in which two or more channels are mapped in<br>
some manner to a smaller number of channels, spatial location reconfiguration in<br>
which that locations at which channels are intended to be reproduced are remapped in<br>
some manner, and conversion from binaural to loudspeaker format (by crosstalk<br>
cancellation or processing with a crosstalk canceller) or from loudspeaker format to<br>
binaural (by "binauralization" or processing by a loudspeaker format to binaural<br>
converter, a "binauralizer"). In the case of binauralization, the channel<br>
reconfiguration may include (1) an upmixing to multiple virtual channels and/or (2) a<br>
virtual spatial location reconfiguration rendered as a two-channel stereophonic<br>
binaural signal Virtual upmixing and virtual loudspeaker positioning are well known<br>
in the art since at least as early as the nineteen-sixties (see e.g., Atal et al, "Apparent<br>
Sound Source Translator," U.S. Pat. No. 3,236,949 (Feb. 26,1966) and Bauer,<br>
"Stereophonic to Binaural Conversion Apparatus," U.S. Pat. No. 3,088,997 (May 7,<br>
1963).<br><br>
WO 2006/132857	PCT/US2006/020882<br>
-16-<br>
As mentioned above in connection with the examples of FIG. 3 and FIG. 4A, a<br>
modified version of the M-Channel Original Signals may be employed as inputs. The<br>
signals are modified so as to facilitate a blind reconfiguration by a commonly-<br>
available consumer device such as an active matrix decoder. Alternatively, when the<br>
unmodified signals are two-channel stereophonic signals, the modified signals may be<br>
a two-channel binauralized version of the unmodified signals. The modified M-<br>
Channel Original Signals may have the same number of channels as the unmodified<br>
signals, although this is not critical to this aspect of the invention. Referring to the<br>
example of FIG. 4B, in the Production portion 38 of the arrangement, M-Channel<br>
Original Signals (legacy audio signals) are applied to a device or function that<br>
generates an alternate or modified set of audio signals ("Generate Alternate Signals")<br>
40, which alternate or modified signals are applied to a device or function that derives<br>
one or more sets of channel reconfiguration side information ("Derive Channel<br>
Reconfiguration Information") 32 and to a formatter device or formatting function<br>
("Format") 22 (both 32 and 22 are described above). The Derive Channel<br>
Reconfiguration Information 32 may also receive non-audio information from the<br>
Generate Alternate Signals 40 to assist it in deriving the reconfiguration information.<br>
The output bitstream or bitstreams are transmitted or stored in any suitable manner.<br>
In the Consumption portion 42 of the arrangement, the output bitstream or<br>
bitstreams are received and a Deformat 26 (described above) undoes the action of the<br>
Format 22 to provide the M-Channel Alternate Signals (or an approximation of them)<br>
and the channel reconfiguration information. The channel reconfiguration<br>
information and the M-Channel Alternate Signals (or an approximation of them) may<br>
be applied to a device or function ("Reconfigure Channels") 44 that channel<br>
reconfigures the M-Channel Original Signals (or an approximation of them) in<br>
accordance with the instructions to provide N-Channel Reconfigured Signals. As in<br>
the FIG. 3 and 4A examples, if there are multiple sets of instructions, one set is<br>
chosen (such choice may be fixed in the Consumption portion of the arrangement or it<br>
may be selectable in some manner). As noted above in the description of the FIG. 4A<br>
example, the "channel reconfiguration" may include, for example, "upmixing"<br>
(including virtual upmixing in which a two-channel binaural signal is rendered having<br>
upmixed virtual channels), "downmixing", spatial location reconfiguration, and<br>
conversion from binaural to loudspeaker format or from loudspeaker format to<br><br>
WO 2006/132857	PCT/US2006/020882<br>
-17-<br>
binaural. The M-Channel Alternate Signals (or an approximation of them) may also<br>
be applied to a device or function that reconfigures the M-Channel Alternate Signals<br>
without reference to the reconfiguration information ("Reconfigure Channels Without<br>
Reconfiguration Information") 46 to provide P-Channel Reconfigured Signals. The<br>
number of channels P need not be the same as the number of channels N. As<br>
discussed above, such a device or function 46 may be, in the case when the<br>
reconfiguration is upmixing, for example, a blind upmixer such as an active matrix<br>
decoder (examples of which are set forth above). The device or function 46 may also<br>
provide conversion from binaural to loudspeaker format or from loudspeaker format<br>
to binaural. As with device or function 36 of the FIG. 4A example, the device or<br>
function 46 may provide a virtual upmixing and/or a virtual loudspeaker repositioning<br>
in which a two-channel binaural signal is rendered having upmixed and/or<br>
repositioned virtual channels. The M-Channel Alternate Signals, the N-Channel<br>
Reconfigured Signals, and the P-Channel Reconfigured Signals are potential outputs<br>
of the Consumption portion 42 of the arrangement. Any combination of them may be<br>
provided as outputs (the figure shows all three) or one or a combination of them may<br>
be selected, the selection being implemented by a selector or selection function (not<br>
shown) under automatic or manual control, for example, by a user or consumer.<br>
A further alternative is shown in the example of FIG. 4C. In this example, M-<br>
Channel Original Signals are modified, but the Channel Reconfiguration Information<br>
is not transmitted or recorded. Thus, the Derive Channel Reconfiguration Information<br>
32 may be omitted in the Production portion 38 of the arrangement such that only the<br>
M-Channel Alternate Signals are applied to Format 22. Thus, a legacy transmission<br>
or recording arrangement, which may be incapable of carrying reconfiguration<br>
information in addition to audio information, is required to carry only a legacy-type<br>
signal, such as a two-channel stereophonic signal, which, in this case, has been<br>
modified to provide better results when applied to a low-complexity consumer-type<br>
upmixer, such as an active matrix decoder, in the Consumption portion 42 of the<br>
arrangement, the Reconfigure Channels 44 may be omitted in order to provide one or<br>
both of the two potential outputs, the M-Channel Alternate Signals and the P-Channel<br>
Reconfigured Signals.<br>
As indicated above, it may be desirable to modify the set of M-Channel<br>
Original Signals applied to the Production portion of an audio system so that such M-<br><br>
WO 2006/132857	PCT/US2006/020882<br>
-18-<br>
Channel Original Signals (or an approximation of them) is more suitable for blind<br>
upmixing in the Consumption portion of the system by a consumer-type upmixer,<br>
such as an adaptive matrix decoder.<br>
One way to modify such a set of non-optimal audio signals is to (1) upmix the<br>
set of signals using a device or function that operates with less dependence on<br>
intrinsic signal characteristics (such as amplitude and/or phase relationships among<br>
signals applied to it) than does an adaptive matrix decoder, and (2) encode the<br>
upmixed set of signals using a matrix encoder compatible with the anticipated<br>
adaptive matrix decoder. This approach is described below in connection with the<br>
example of FIG. 5 A.<br>
Another way to modify such a set of signals is to apply one or more of known<br>
"spatialization" and/or signal synthesis techniques. Ones of such techniques are<br>
sometimes characterized as "pseudo stereo" or "pseudo quad" techniques. For<br>
example, one may add decorrelated and/or out-of-phase content to one or more of the<br>
channels. Such processing increases apparent sound image width or sound<br>
envelopment at the cost of diminished center image stability. This is described in<br>
connection with the example of FIG. 5B. To help reach a balance between these<br>
signal features (width/envelopment versus center image stability), one could take<br>
advantage of the phenomenon that center image stability is determined mainly by low<br>
to mid frequencies, while image width and envelopment is determined mainly by<br>
higher frequencies. By splitting the signal into two or more frequency bands, one<br>
could process audio subbands independently so as maintain image stability at low and<br>
moderate frequencies by applying minimal decorrelation, and increase the sense of<br>
envelopment at higher frequencies by employing greater decorrelation. This is<br>
described in the example of FIG. 5C.<br>
Referring to the example of FIG. 5 A, in the Production portion 48 of the<br>
arrangement, M-Channel Signals are upmixed to P-Channel Signals by what may be<br>
characterized as an "artistic" upmixer device or "artistic" upmixing function (Artistic<br>
Upmix) 50. An "artistic" upmixer, typically, but not necessarily, a computationally<br>
complex upmixer, operates with little or no dependence on intrinsic signal<br>
characteristics (such as amplitude and/or phase relationships among signals applied to<br>
it) on which active matrix decoders rely to perform an upmix. Instead, an "artistic"<br>
upmixer operates in accordance with one or more processes that the designer or<br><br>
WO 2006/132857	PCT/US2006/020882<br>
-19-<br>
designers of the upmixer deem suitable to produce particular results. Such "artistic"<br>
upmixers may take many forms. One example is provided herein in connection with<br>
FIG. 7 and the description under the heading "The present invention applied to a<br>
spatial coder". According to this FIG. 7 example, the result is an upmixed signal<br>
with, for example, better left/right separation to minimize "center pile-up," or more<br>
front/back separation to improve "envelopment." The choice of a particular technique<br>
or techniques for performing an "artistic" upmix is not critical to this aspect of the<br>
invention.<br>
Still referring to FIG. 5A, the upmixed P-Channel Signals are applied to a<br>
matrix encoder or matrix encoding function ("Matrix Encode") 52 that provides a<br>
smaller number of channels, the M-Channel Alternate Signals, which channels are<br>
encoded with intrinsic signal characteristics, such as amplitude and phase cues,<br>
suitable for decoding by a matrix decoder. A suitable matrix encoder is the 5:2 matrix<br>
encoder described below in connection with FIG. 8. Other matrix encoders may also<br>
be suitable. The Matrix Encode output is applied to the Format 22 that generates, for<br>
example, a serial or parallel bitstream, as described above. Ideally, the combination<br>
of Artistic Upmix 50 and the Matrix Encode 52 results in the generation of signals,<br>
which when decoded by a conventional consumer active matrix decoder, provides an<br>
improved listening experience in comparison to a decoding of the original signals<br>
applied to Artistic Upmix 50.<br>
In the Consumption portion 54 of the FIG. 5 A arrangement, the output<br>
bitstream or bitstreams are received and a Deformat 26 (described above) undoes the<br>
action of the Format 22 to provide the M-Channel Alternate Signals (or an<br>
approximation of them). The M-Channel Alternate Signals (or an approximation of<br>
them) may be provided as an output and applied to a device or function that<br>
reconfigures the M-Channel Alternate Signals without reference to any<br>
reconfiguration information ("Reconfigure Channels Without Reconfiguration<br>
Information") 56 to provide P-Channel Reconfigured Signals. The number of<br>
channels P need not be the same as the number of channels M. As discussed above,<br>
such a device or function 56 may be, in the case when the reconfiguration is upmixing,<br>
for example, a blind upmixer such as an active matrix decoder (as discussed above).<br>
The M-Channel Alternate Signals and the P-Channel Reconfigured Signals are<br>
potential outputs of the Consumption portion 54 of the arrangement. One or both of<br><br>
WO 2006/132857	PCT/US2006/020882<br>
-20-<br>
them. may be selected, the selection being implemented by a selector or selection<br>
function (not shown) under automatic or manual control, for example, by a user or<br>
consumer.<br>
In the example of FIG. 5B, another way to modify a non-optimum set of input<br>
signals is shown, namely a type of "spatialization" in which the correlation among<br>
channels is modified. In the Production portion 58 of the arrangement, M-Channel<br>
Signals are applied to a set of decorrelator devices or decorrelation functions<br>
("Decorrelator") 60. A reduction in cross correlation between or among the signal<br>
channels can be achieved by independently processing the individual channels with<br>
any of the well know decorrelation techniques. Alternatively, decorrelation can be<br>
achieved by interdependently processing between or among channels. For example,<br>
out of phase content (i.e., negative correlation) between channels can be achieved by<br>
scaling and inverting the signal from one channel and mixing into another. In both<br>
cases, the process can be controlled by adjusting the relative levels of processed and<br>
unprocessed signal in each channel. As mentioned above, there is a trade off between<br>
apparent sound image width or sound envelopment and diminished center image<br>
stability. An example of decorrelation by independently processing individual<br>
channels is set forth in the pending U.S. Patent Applications of Seefeldt et al, S.N.<br>
60/604,725 (filed August 25, 2004), S.N. 60/700,137 (filed July 18,2005), and S:N.<br>
60/705,784 (filed August 5,2005, attorneys' docket DOL14901), each entitled<br>
"Multichannel Decorrelation in Spatial Audio Coding." Another example of<br>
decorrelation by independently processing individual channels is set forth in the<br>
Breebaart et al AES Convention Paper 6072 and the WO 03/090206 international<br>
application, cited below. The M-Channel Signals with decreased correlation are<br>
applied to Format 22, as described above, which provides a suitable output, such as<br>
one or more bitstreams, for application to a suitable transmission or recording. The<br>
Consumption portion 54 of the FIG. 5B arrangement may be the same as the<br>
Consumption portion of the FIG. 5 A arrangement.<br>
As mentioned above, adding decorrelated and/or out-of-phase content to one<br>
or more of the channels increases apparent sound image width or sound envelopment<br>
at the cost of diminished center image stability. In the example of FIG. 5C, to help<br>
reach a balance between width/envelopment versus center image stability, signals are<br>
split into two or more frequency bands and the audio subbands are processed<br><br>
WO 2006/132857	PCT/US2006/020882<br>
-21-<br>
independently so as maintain image stability at low and moderate frequencies by<br>
applying minimal decorrelation, and increase tbe sense of envelopment at higher<br>
frequencies by employing greater decorrelation.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5C, in the production portion 58', M-Channel Signals are<br>
applied to a subband filter or subband filtering function ("Subband Filter") 62.<br>
Although FIG. 5C shows such a Subband Filter 62 explicitly, it should be understood<br>
that such a filter or filtering function may be employed in other examples, as<br>
mentioned above. Although Subband Filter 62 may take various forms and the choice<br>
of the filter or filtering function (e.g., a filter bank or a transform) is not critical to the<br>
invention. Subband Filter 62 divides the spectrum of the M-Channel Signals into R<br>
bands, each of which may be applied to a respective Decorrelator. The drawing<br>
shows, schematically, Decorrelator 64 for band 1, Decorrelator 66 for band 2, and<br>
Decorrelator 68 for band R, it being understood that each band may have its own<br>
Decorrelator. Some bands may not be applied to a Decorrelator. The Decorrelators<br>
are essentially the same as Decorrelator 60 of the FIG. 5B example except that they<br>
operate on less than the full spectrum of the M-Channel Signals. For simplicity in<br>
presentation, FIG. 5C shows a Subband Filter and related Decorrelators for a single<br>
signal, it being understood that each signal is split into subbands and that each<br>
subband may be decorrelated. After decorrelation, if any, the subbands for each<br>
signal may be summed together by a summer or summing function ("Sum") 70 The<br>
Sum 70 output is applied to the Format 22 that generates, for example, a serial or<br>
parallel bitstream, as described above. The Consumption portion 54 of the FIG. 5C<br>
arrangement may be the same as the Consumption portion of the FIG. 5 A and 5B<br>
arrangements.<br>
Integration with Spatial Coding<br>
Certain recently-introduced limited bit rate coding techniques (see below for<br>
an exemplary list of patents, patent applications and publications relating to spatial<br>
coding) analyze an N channel input signal along with an M channel composite signal<br>
(N&gt;M) to generate side-information containing a parametric model of the N channel<br>
input signal's sound field with respect to that of the M channel composite. Typically<br>
the composite signal is derived from the same master material as the original N<br>
channel signal. The side-information and composite signal are transmitted to a<br>
decoder that applies the parametric model to the composite signal in order to recreate<br><br>
WO 2006/132857	PCT/US2006/020882<br>
-22-<br>
an approximation of the original N channel signal's sound field. The primary goal of<br>
such "spatial coding" systems is to recreate the original sound field with a very<br>
Limited amount of data; hence this enforces limitations on the parametric model used<br>
to simulate the original sound field. Such spatial coding systems typically employ<br>
parameters to model the original N channel signal's sound field such as inter-channel<br>
level differences (ILD), inter-channel time or phase differences (ITD or IPD), and<br>
inter-channel coherence (ICC). Typically such parameters are estimated for multiple<br>
spectral hands across all N channels of the input signal being coded and are<br>
dynamically estimated over time.<br>
Some examples of prior art spatial coding are shown in FIGS. 6A-6B<br>
(encoder) and 6C (decoder). N-Channel Original Signals may be converted by a<br>
device or function ("Time to Frequency") to the frequency domain utilizing an<br>
appropriate time-to-frequency transformation, such as the well-known Short-time<br>
Discrete Fourier Transform (STDFT). Typically, the transform is manipulated such<br>
that its frequency bands approximate the ear's critical bands. An estimate of the inter-<br>
channel amplitude differences, inter-channel time or phase differences, and inter-<br>
channel correlation is computed for each of the bands ("Generate Spatial Side<br>
Information). If M-Channel Composite Signals corresponding to the N-Channel<br>
Original Signals do not already exist, these estimates may be utilized to downmix<br>
("Downmix") the N-Channel Original Signals into M-Channel Composite Signals (as<br>
in the example of FIG. 6A). Alternatively, an existing M channel composite may be<br>
simultaneously processed with the same time-to-frequency transform (shown<br>
separately for clarity in presentation) and the spatial parameters of the N-Channel<br>
Original Signals may be computed with respect to those of the M-Channel Composite<br>
Signals (as in the example of FIG. 6B). Similarly, if N-Channel Original Signals are<br>
not available, an available set of M-Channel Composite Signals may be upmixed in<br>
the time domain to produce the "N-Channel Original Signals - each set of signals<br>
providing a set of inputs to the respective Time to Frequency devices or functions in<br>
the example of FIG. 6B. The composite signal and the estimated spatial parameters<br>
are then encoded ("Format") into a single bitstream. At the decoder (FIG. 6C), this<br>
bitstream is decoded ("Deformat") to generate the M-Channel Composite Signals<br>
along with the spatial side information. The composite signals are transformed to the<br>
frequency domain ("Time to Frequency") where the decoded spatial parameters are<br><br>
WO 2006/132857	PCT/US2006/020882<br>
-23-<br>
applied to their corresponding bands ("Apply Spatial Side Information") to generate<br>
an N-Channel Original Signals in the frequency domain. Finally, a frequency-to-time<br>
transformation ("Frequency to Time") is applied to produce the N~Channel Original<br>
Signals or approximations thereof. Alternatively, the spatial side information may be<br>
ignored and the M-Channel Composite Signals selected for playback.<br>
While prior art spatial coding systems assume the existence of N-channel<br>
signals from which a low-data rate parametric representation of its sound field is<br>
estimated, such a system may be altered to work with the disclosed invention. Rather<br>
than estimate spatial parameters from original N-channel signals, such spatial<br>
parameters may instead be generated directly from an analysis of legacy M channel<br>
signals, where M<n. the parameters are generated such that a desired n-channel></n.>
upmix of the legacy M-channel signals is produced at the decoder when such<br>
parameters are there applied. This may be achieved without generating the actual N-<br>
charmel uprnix signals at the encoder, but rather by producing a parametric<br>
representation of the desired upmixed signal's sound field directly from the M-<br>
channel legacy signals. FIG. 7 depicts such an upmixing encoder, which is<br>
compatible with the spatial decoder depicted in FIG. 6C. Further details of producing<br>
such a parametric representation are provided below under the heading "The present<br>
invention applied to a spatial coder."<br>
Referring to the details of FIG. 7, M-Channel Original Signals in the time<br>
domain are converted to the frequency domain utilizing an appropriate time-to-<br>
frequency transformation ("Time to Frequency") 72. A device or function 74<br>
("Derive Upmix Information as Side Information") derives upmixing instructions in<br>
the same manner that spatial side information is generated in a spatial coding system.<br>
Details of generating spatial side information in a spatial coding system are set forth<br>
in one or more of the references cited herein. The spatial coding parameters,<br>
constituting upmix instructions, along with the M-Channel Original Signals are<br>
applied to a device or function ("Format") 76 that formats the M-Channel Original<br>
Signals and the spatial coding parameters into a form suitable for transmission or<br>
storage. The formatting may include data-compression encoding.<br>
An upmixer employing the parameter generation as just described in<br>
combination with a device or function for applying them to the signals to be upmixed<br><br>
WO 2006/132857	PCT/US2006/020882<br>
-24-<br>
as, for example, a FIG. 6C decoder, is suitable as a computationally-complex upmixer<br>
for use in generating alternate signals as in the examples of FIGS. 4B AC, 5 A and 5B.<br>
Although it is advantageous to produce the parametric representation directly<br>
from the M-channel legacy signals without generating the desired N-channel upmix<br>
signals at the encoder (as in the example below), it is not crucial to the invention.<br>
Alternatively, spatial parameters may be derived by generating the desired N-channel<br>
uprnix signals at the encoder. Functionally, such signals would be generated within<br>
block 74 of FIG. 7. Thus, even in this alternative, the only audio information that the<br>
instruction deriving receives is the M-channel legacy signals.<br>
FIG. 8 is an idealized functional block diagram of a conventional prior art 5:2<br>
matrix passive (linear time-invariant) encoder compatible with Pro Logic II active<br>
matrix decoders. Such an encoder is suitable for use in the example of FIG. 5 A,<br>
described above. The encoder accepts five separate input signals; left, center, right,<br>
left surround, and right surround (L, C, R, LS, RS), and creates two final outputs, left-<br>
total and right-total (Lt and Rt). The C input is divided equally and summed with the<br>
L and R inputs (in combiners 80 and 82, respectively) with a 3 dB level (amplitude)<br>
attenuation (provided by attenuator 84) in order to maintain constant acoustic power.<br>
The L and R inputs, each summed with the level-reduced C input, have phase- and<br>
level-shifted versions of the LS and RS inputs subtractively and additively combined<br>
with them. The left-surround (LS) input ideally is phase shifted by 90 degrees, shown<br>
in block 86, and then reduced in level by 1.2 dB in attenuator 88 for subtractive<br>
combining in combiner 90 with the summed L and level-reduced C. It is then further<br>
reduced in level by 5 dB in attenuator 92 for additive combining in combiner 94 with<br>
the summed R, level-reduced C, and a phase-shifted level-reduced version of RS, as<br>
next described, to provide the Rt output. The right-surround (RS) input ideally is<br>
phase shifted by 90 degrees, shown in block 96, and then reduced in level by 1.2 dB<br>
in attenuator 98 for additive combining in combiner 100 with the summed R and<br>
level-reduced C. It is then further reduced in level by 5 dB in attenuator 102 for<br>
subtractive combining in combiner 104 with the summed R, level-reduced C, and<br>
level-reduced phase-shifted LS to provide the Lt output.<br>
In principle there need be only one 90 degree phase-shift block in each<br>
surround input path, as shown in the figure. In practice, a 90 degree phase shifter is<br>
unrealizable, so four all-pass networks may be used with appropriate phase shifts so<br><br>
WO 2006/132857	PCT/US2006/020882<br>
-25-<br>
as to realize the desired 90 degree phase shifts. All-pass networks have the advantage<br>
of not affecting the timbre (frequency spectrum) of the audio signals being processed.<br>
The left-total (Lt) and right-total (Rt) encoded signals maybe expressed as<br>
Lt = L + m(-3)dB*C-j * [m(-1.2)dB*Ls + m(-6.2)dB*Rs], and<br>
Rt = R + m(-3)dB*C + j * [(m(-1.2)dB*Rs + m(-6.2)dB*Ls),<br>
where L is the left input signal, R is the right input signal, C is the center input signal,<br>
Ls is the left surround input signal, Rs is the right surround input signal, "j is the<br>
square root of minus one (-1) (a 90 degree phase shift), and "m" indicates multiply by<br>
the indicated attenuation in decibels (thus, m(-3)dB = 3dB attenuation).<br>
Alternatively, the equations may be expressed as follows:<br>
Lt = L + (0.707)*C - j*(0.87*Ls + 0.56*Rs), and<br>
Rt = R + (0.707)*C + j*(0.87*Rs + 0.56*Ls),<br>
where, 0.707 is an approximation of 3dB attenuation, 0.87 is an approximation of<br>
1.2dB attenuation, and 0.56 is an approximation of 6.2dB attenuation. The values<br>
(0.707, 0.87, and 0.56) are not critical. Other values may be employed with<br>
acceptable results. The extent to which other values may be employed depends on the<br>
extent to which the designer of the system deems the audible results to be acceptable.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
Spatial Coding Background<br>
Consider a spatial coding system that utilizes as its side information per-<br>
critical band estimates of the inter-channel level differences (ILD) and inter-channel<br>
coherence (ICC) of the N channel signal. We assume the number of channels in the<br>
composite signal is M=2 and that the number of channels in the original signal is N=5.<br>
Define the following notation:<br>
Xj[b,t]: The frequency domain representation of channel j of<br>
composite signal x at band b and time block t. This value is derived by<br>
applying a time to frequency transform to the composite signal x sent<br>
to the decoder.'<br>
Zj[b,t]: The frequency domain representation of channel i of<br>
original signal estimate z at band b and time block t. This value is<br>
computed by applying the side information to Xj [b, t].<br><br>
WO 2006/132857	PCT/US2006/020882<br>
-26-<br>
ILDij[b,t]: The inter-channel level difference of channel i of<br>
the original signal with respect to channel j of the composite at band b<br>
and time block t. This value is sent as side information.<br>
ICCt[b,t]: The inter-channel coherence of channel i of the<br>
original signal at band b and time block t. This value is sent as side<br>
information.<br>
As a first step in decoding, an intermediate frequency domain representation<br>
of the N channel signal is generated through application of the inter-channel level<br>
differences to the composite as follows:<br><br>
Next a decorrelated version of Y, is generated through application of a unique<br>
decorrelation filter H, to each channel i, where application of the filter may be<br>
achieved through multiplication in the frequency domain:<br>
Ŷi = HtYt<br>
Lastly, the frequency domain estimate of the original signal z is computed as a<br>
linear combination of Y, and Ŷi, where the inter-channel coherence controls the<br>
proportion of this combination:<br><br>
The final signal z is then generated by applying a frequency to tune<br>
transformation to Zi [b,t].<br>
The present invention applied to a spatial coder<br>
We now describe an embodiment of the disclosed invention that utilizes the<br>
spatial decoder described above in order to uprnix an M=2 channel signal into an N=6<br>
channel signal. The encoding requires synthesizing the side information ILDij [b, t]<br>
and ICC, [b, t] from Xj [b, t] alone such that the desired uprnix is produced at the<br>
decoder when ILDij[b,t] and ICCi[b,t] are applied to Xj[b,t] , as described above.<br>
As indicated above, this approach also applies provides a computationally-complex<br>
upmixing suitable for use, when the upmixed signals are then applied to a matrix<br><br>
WO 2006/132857	PCT/US2006/020882<br>
-27-<br>
encoder, in generating alternate signals suitable for upmixing by a low-complexity<br>
upmixer such a consumer-type active matrix decoder.<br>
The first step of the preferred blind upmixing system is to convert the two-<br>
channel input into the spectral domain. The conversion to the spectral domain may be<br>
accomplished using 75% overlapped DFTs with 50% of the block zero padded to<br>
prevent circular convolurional effects caused by the decorrelation filters. This DFT<br>
scheme matches the time-frequency conversion scheme used in the preferred<br>
embodiment of the spatial coding system. The spectral representation of the signal is<br>
then separated into multiple bands approximating the equivalent rectangular band<br>
(ERB) scale; again, this banding structure is the same as the one used by the spatial<br>
coding system such that the side-information may be used to perform blind upmixing<br>
at the decoder. In each band b a covariance matrix is calculated as shown in the<br>
following equation:<br><br>
Where, X1 [k, t] is the DFT of the first channel at bin k and block t, X2 [k, t] is<br>
the DFT of the second channel at bin k and block t, W is the width of the band b<br>
counted in bins, and RbtXX. is an instantaneous estimate of the covariance matrix in<br>
band b at block t for the two input channels. Furthermore, the "*" operator in the<br>
above equation represents the conjugation of the DFT values.<br>
The instantaneous estimate of the covariance matrix is then smoothed over<br>
each block using a simple first order IIR filter applied to the covariance matrix in each<br>
band as shown in the following equation:<br>
Rb,tXX=λRb,t-1XX +(1-λ)Rb,tXX<br>
Where, Rb,t-1XX is a smoothed estimate of the covariance matrix, and X is the<br>
smoothing coefficient, which may be signal and band dependent.<br>
For a simple 2 to 6 blind upmixing system we define the channel ordering as<br>
follows:<br><br><br>
WO 2006/132857	PCT/US2006/020882<br>
-28-<br><br>
Using the above channel mapping we develop the following per band ILD and<br>
ICC for each, of the channels with respect to the smoothed covariance matrix:<br><br><br>
WO 2006/132857	PCT/US2006/020882<br>
-29-<br>
For channel 6 (LFE):<br>
ILDSA[b,t] = 0<br>
ILD6,2[b,t] = 0<br>
ICC6[b,t] = l<br>
In practice, an arrangement according to the just-describe example has been<br>
found to perform well - it separates direct sounds from ambient sounds, puts direct<br>
sounds into the Left and Right channels, and moves the ambient sounds to the rear<br>
channels. More complicated arrangements may also be created using the side<br>
information transmitted within a spatial coding system.<br>

11.	The method of any one of claims 1-10 wherein said at least one audio signal<br>
or its modification is divided into frequency bands and said instructions for channel<br>
reconfiguring are with respect to ones of such frequency bands.<br>
12.	A method for processing at least one audio signal or a modification of the at<br>
least one audio signal having the same number of channels as said at least one audio<br>
signal, each audio signal representing an audio channel, comprising<br>
receiving at least one audio signal or its modification and instructions for channel<br>
reconfiguring the at least one audio signal or its modification, said instructions having<br>
been derived by an instruction derivation in which the only audio information received is<br>
said at least one audio signal or its modification, and<br>
channel reconfiguring the at least one audio signal or its modification using said<br>
instructions.<br>
13.	The method of claim 12 wherein said at least one audio signal and its<br>
modification are each two or more audio signals.<br>
14.	The method of claim 13 wherein the modified two or more audio signals are<br>
decoded by a matrix decoder.<br>
15.	The method of claim 14 wherein the matrix decoder is an active matrix<br>
decoder.<br>
16.	The method of any one of claims 13-15 wherein the modified two or more<br>
audio signals are a matrix-encoded modification.<br>
17.	The method of any one of claims 12-16 wherein the instructions for channel<br>
reconfiguring are instructions for upmixing the at least one audio signal or its<br>
modification and said channel reconfiguring upmixes the at least one audio signal or its<br>
modification such that the resulting number of audio signals is greater than the number of<br>
audio signals comprising the at least one audio signal or its modification.<br>
18.	The method of any one of claims 12-16 wherein said at least one audio signal<br>
and its modification are each two or more audio signals and the instructions for channel<br>
reconfiguring are instructions for downmixing the two or more audio signals and said<br>
channel reconfiguring downmixes the two or more audio signals such that the resulting<br>
number of audio signals is less than the number of audio signals comprising the two or<br>
more audio signals.<br>
19.	The method of any one of claims 12-16 wherein said at least one audio signal<br>
and its modification are each two or more audio signals and the instructions for channel<br>
reconfiguring are instructions for reconfiguring the two or more audio signals such that<br><br>
the number of audio signals remains the same but the respective spatial locations at which<br>
such audio signals are intended to be reproduced are changed.<br>
20.	The method of any one of claims 12-16 wherein the instructions for channel<br>
reconfiguring are instructions for rendering a binaural stereophonic signal having an<br>
upmixing to multiple virtual channels of the at least one audio signal or its modification.<br>
21.	The method of any one of claims 12-16 wherein the instructions for channel<br>
reconfiguring are instructions for rendering a binaural stereophonic signal having a<br>
virtual spatial location reconfiguration.<br>
22.	The method of any one of claims 12-21 wherein the at least one audio signal<br>
or its modification is data-compressed, the method further comprising data<br>
decompressing the at least one audio signal or its modification.<br>
23.	The method of any one of claims 12-21 wherein said at least one audio signal<br>
or its modification is divided into frequency bands and said instructions for channel<br>
reconfiguring are with respect to respective ones of such frequency bands.<br>
24.	The method of any one of claims 12-23 further comprising<br>
providing an audio output, and<br>
selecting as the audio output one of:<br>
(1)	the at least one audio signal or its modification, or<br>
(2)	the channel reconfigured at least one audio signal.<br><br>
25.	The method of any one of claims 12-23 further comprising<br>
providing an audio output in response to the received at least one audio signal or its<br>
modification.<br>
26.	The method of claim 25 wherein said at least one audio signal and its<br>
modification are each two or more audio signals, the method further comprising matrix<br>
decoding the two or more audio signals.<br>
27.	The method of any one of claims 12-23 further comprising<br>
providing an audio output in response to the received channel-reconfigured at<br>
least one audio signal.<br><br>
During production, at least one audio signal is processed in order to derive<br>
instructions for channel reconfiguring it. The at least one audio signal and the<br>
instructions are stored or transmitted. During consumption, the at least one audio signal<br>
is channel reconfigured in accordance with the instructions. Channel reconfiguring<br>
includes upmixing, downmixing, and spatial reconfiguration. By determining the<br>
channel reconfiguration instructions during production, processing resources during<br>
consumption are reduced.</td>
