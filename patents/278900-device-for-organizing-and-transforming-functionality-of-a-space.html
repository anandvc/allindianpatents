				<td>DEVICE FOR ORGANIZING AND TRANSFORMING FUNCTIONALITY OF A<br>
SPACE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the fields of modification of functional utility of available space. The present Invention specifically relates to a device for organizing and transforming functionality of a space.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The functional utility of a space is defined by the activity that is performed in the space. In traditional practice, separate spaces are utilized for each activity, i.e. a house to relax, office to work, kitchen to cook and many more. Nowadays, due to space unavailability and limitations, there is a need for doing one or more of these activities in a single location. This increases the demand for need of a single unit of multiple functional utilities within the space available.<br>
Moreover, when single room space is available with no partitions, in such case only either office or home space is possible without any possibility for other activities. Many business meeting points requires the multi functions of home and office/kitchen as a single unit, i.e. one of the rooms being converted to space for home, office, kitchen, etc. With such increasing needs, it would be desirable to provide such single room spaces for conducting business at certain hours and some mechanism for functionally modifying the same space for other activities such as home, kitchen, etc. The concepts of multiple functionalities in a single space can be addressed by architects in terms of partitions and by furniture designers in terms of foldable furniture.<br>
In architecture and construction, the concepts of collapsible space are mostly used for creating additional space around one or two protrusions of the<br>
 <br>
existing body of the construction. US 5,934,738 describes a unique way to obtain more living space from a designed camper generally mounted on the back of a pickup truck. The projecting nose portion of the camper is upgraded to an additional space by providing sidewalls and floor members, which are folded away when not required. US 4,909,268 describes a collapsible, bellow-like enclosure, which provides privacy and eliminate the inconvenience of having a fixed, bulky enclosure where space is essential.<br>
Similarly, US 3,968,809 discloses a method of providing a van tent for an open-ended van to form a temporary room-like extension at the rear end. Further, US 2002/0149220 A1 describes creation of additional space when there is no protrusion, by totally hinged and folded members without intruding into the vehicle space. US 4,745,960 describes a set of collapsible partition assembly with a ceiling unit folded into a convenient storage configuration or unfolded and guided accurately onto the unfolded room module. US 4,074,475 describes methods of using foldable members from the ceiling and from the wall, which are opened out to subdivide large space into small spaces.<br>
On the other hand, the changing of functional utility of a space such as house or office or kitchen, is addressed by furniture manufacturers. For example, US 2008/0042528A1 describes that the space layout of an office can be changed as per requirement, using modular furniture. US 5,979,118 describes the concept of collapsibility into furniture systems by using telescopic furnishings. Similarly, US 5,536,080 describes that a collapsible furniture, in a living space, can be used to create a workstation when open and an aesthetic outfit when closed. The aesthetic furniture also indicates modern collapsible furniture that can combine various related functions like the mobile kitchen that combines eating and cooking, the foldaway guest room that combines sleeping and relaxing and the foldaway office that combines working and studying.<br>
 <br>
All of the conventional approaches disclose that architectural efforts are resulted either in creating additional space in the exterior or subdividing the interior without addressing functionality. The work by furniture manufacturers and researchers only provides combination of related functionalities by folding furniture concepts. Most of these concepts of folding furniture address only efficient use of the space. The sen/e part of the gadgets is kept open for usage and when the serve part are collapsed and kept away, additional gadgets are required by the user for other functional activities. For example, if the user not requires the collapsible office furniture, then the user searches for some other furniture, particularly bed, to relax after closing the office furniture.<br>
With respect to the conventional approaches, the concept of modifying the available space for multiple utilities by means of single unit is not addressed. Moreover, it is very difficult and complex to design the self contained and collapsible single unit for combination of unrelated functions like work and sleep effectively, without the need for additional gadgets. Thus, there exists a need for single equipment that can completely serve all the needs of a person to work or relax or choose to have space for both simultaneously, in a single space. Therefore, it is desirable to provide a device for organizing and transforming functionality of a space, which is capable of overcoming all of these aforementioned drawbacks.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a device for organizing and transforming functionality of a space, which is capable of achieving different space functionalities within the available space and with all necessary gadgets and provisions included in it.<br>
 <br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a device for organizing and transforming functionality of a space, which is simple in construction and occupies least space when it is completely collapsed.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a device for organizing and transforming functionality of a space, which Is self sufficient in terms of ability to hold the required gadgets within its structure.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to one aspect, the present invention, which achieves the objectives, relates to a device for organizing and transforming functionality of a space comprising a set of panel sections connected with each other in such a way that the panel sections are pivotably movable with respect to other panel sections between an open position and a close position. Each panel section is provided with several storage areas disposed in it for accommodating one or more units. One or more locking mechanisms are attached with the panel sections for securing the panel sections with each other, where the locking mechanisms is actuated by one or more actuating means. At least one control unit is associated with the locking mechanisms and the actuating means. The control unit is configured to control the actuating means for operating the locking mechanisms in such a way that appropriate panel sections are opened and/or closed in accordance with user requirements, which transforms the functionality of the room space into a desired living space by organizing and projecting the units in the appropriate panel sections. Such device is simple in construction and facilitates different space functionalities within the available space and with all necessary gadgets and provisions included in it.<br>
Furthermore, the storage areas of the panel sections are horizontally positioned with inwardly projecting surfaces. The panel sections are composed of at least one rear panel section, at least one front panel section and one or more<br>
 <br>
optional intermediate panel sections. The outer surface of the front panel sections Is arranged as a door like structure. The panel sections are connected to each other at the edges by means of hinge connection. The units in the panel sections comprises bed, work table, integrated kitchen top (cook top, preparation space, sink and drying space), television, writing board, cloth hanger, mirror, refrigerator, phone, kettle cup, etc. The control unit is associated with one or more additional locking mechanisms that are respectively secured against the bed, the work table and the integrated kitchen top for opening and closing the bed, the work table and the integrated kitchen top in accordance with the user requirements.<br>

Moreover, the rear panel section (1), the intermediate panel section (2), the front panel sections (3, 4), the bed panel section (5) and the table panel section (6) may be of any convenient shapes and sizes, and may be formed of any suitable materials.<br>
In addition, the device comprises locking mechanisms (8, 9, 10, 11) respectively configured for the front panel section (4), the intermediate panel section (2), the bed panel section (5) and the table panel section (6). The locking mechanisms (8, 9, 10, 11) are respectively actuated or operated by actuating means (12, 13, 14, 15). The locking mechanisms (8, 9, 10, 11) and the actuating means (12, 13, 14, 15) include, but are not limited lead screw mechanism and motor, respectively. The locking mechanisms (8, 9, 10, 11) and the actuating means (12, 13, 14, 15) of the device can be integrated to an integral control unit like microprocessor. The control unit controls the actuating means (12, 13, 14, 15) to operate the locking mechanisms (8, 9, 10, 11) based on the user requirements, so that movements of the panel sections (1-4) are automatically controlled for ease of operation. Hereafter, the locking mechanisms (8, 9, 10, 11) and the actuating means (12, 13, 14, 15) are being referred as lead screw mechanism and motor only for the purpose of explanation. The rear panel section (1) houses the bed panel section (5) with the help of hinges. The bed panel section (5) can come out or be closed using the lead screw mechanism (10) actuated by the motor (14). The bed panel section (5) is supported by supporting frames (5a, 5b) when the bed panel section (5) is in an opened position. The supporting frames (5a, 5b) are pivotably secured to the rear panel section (1) by means of fasteners (18).<br>
 <br>
The intermediate panel section (2) is hinged at one end of the rear panel section (1) through the hinge pipes (16). The intermediate panel section (2) serves to completely close the rear panel section (1). The intermediate panel section (2) is pivotably movable about the rear panel section (1) using the lead screw mechanism (8) actuated by the motor (12). The intermediate panel section<br>
(2)	can be assembled with an extendable frame section (7) for additional<br>
transition space. Similarly, the front panel section (3) is pivotably movable about<br>
the intermediate panel section (2) using the lead screw mechanism (9) actuated<br>
by the motor (13). Moreover, the front panel section (3) houses the table panel<br>
section (6) with the help of hinges. The table panel section (6) can come out or<br>
be closed using the lead screw mechanism (11) actuated by the motor (15). The<br>
table panel section (6) is supported by a supporting frame (6a) when the table<br>
panel section (6) is in an opened position. The supporting frame (6a) is pivotably<br>
secured to the front panel section (3) by means of fasteners (20). The table panel<br>
section (6) rests on a mounting unit (19) when it is a closed position, i.e. when<br>
the table panel section (6) is housed within the front panel section (4). The rear<br>
panel section (1), the intermediate panel section (2) and the front panel sections<br>
(3)	are retained by means of holding members (17).<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, a schematic view of home section of the device for organizing and transforming functionality of a space is illustrated, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Each panel section (1-4) is pivotally movable, independent of the other section due to hinge connection. In order to expose the home section of the device, the front panel section (4) is initially opened and the front panel section (3) is opened along with the intermediate panel section (2). Once the front panel section (3) is opened along with the intermediate panel section (2), the bed panel section (5) housed within the rear panel section (1) via the hinges (10) can then be coming out or sliding out and supported using supporting frames (5a, 5b). Thus, the overall design of the device acts as a bedroom for relaxing. The bed panel section (5) is arranged<br>
 <br>
in such a way that it can be come out automatically or manually, once the front panel section (3) is opened along with the intermediate panel section (2).<br>
Further, each panel section (1-4) provides sufficient surface area and storage space for accommodating any utensils. For example, as shown in FIG. 3, the front panel section (4) accommodates all the common facilities needed for the functions incorporated in the panel sections (1-4) like television, mobile phone, stand for teacups and other articles, refrigerator, etc. Similarly, the housing area of the bed panel section (5) in the rear panel section (1) can be used for additional storage of coats or other articles. The intermediate panel section (2) is provided with a mirror and other households. The front panel sections (3, 4) open out like doors. The front panel section (3) is hinged to the intermediate panel section (2) at its edge where the intermediate panel section (2) is hinged to the rear panel section (1). The front panel section (4) is hinged to the rear panel section (1) at its other edge. The proportions of width between the front panel sections (3, 4) are at the ration of 1:4 to 4:1, preferably at the ratio of 2:1.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, a schematic view of office section of the device for organizing and transforming functionality of a space is illustrated, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The inner wall of the front panel section (3) is provided with a hinged flat structure, i.e. table panel section (6) is coming out to serve as a flat surface of a table, and also has some inbuilt storage space. The flat surface can be aesthetically designed to appear like a tabletop surface. The table panel section (6) forms the table top and the chairs are provided separately. The chairs are also designed in a foldable manner such that it occupies minimum space when not in use.<br>
In order to expose the office section of the device, the front panel section (4) is initially opened and the front panel section (3) is opened alone without disturbing the hinge connection between the intermediate panel section (2) and<br>
 <br>
the rear panel section (1). In particular, the intermediate panel section (2) is merged with the rear panel section (1) while exposing the office section of the device. Once the front panel section (3) is opened solely, the table panel section (6) housed between the front panel section (3) and the intermediate panel section (2) can be coming out or sliding out and supported using supporting frames (6a). Thus, the device acts as office section with the table. The table panel section (6) is arranged in such a way that it can be coming out automatically or manually, once the front panel section (3) is opened alone with respect to the intermediate panel section (2), and the chairs can be positioned manually.<br>
Further, the front panel section (4) acts to accommodate similar space for utensils in case of both the office and home section of the device whereas the intermediate panel section (2) is provided with a writing board. The front panel sections (3, 4) open out like doors. The front panel section (3) is hinged to the intermediate panel section (2) at its edge where the intermediate panel section (2) is hinged to the rear panel section (1). The front panel section (4) is hinged to the rear panel section (1) at its other edge. The proportions of width between the front panel sections (3, 4) are at the ration of 1:4 to 4:1, preferably at the ratio of 2:1.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, a schematic view of both the home and office sections of the device for organizing and transforming functionality of a space is illustrated, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The entire arrangement of the device is assembled on coasters that enable effortless opening and closing as well as movement of each panel in the device. The locking mechanisms (8, 9, 10, 11) secure each panel of the device. When the front panel section (3) is opened, the entire arrangement of the device provides an office atmosphere with the table panel section (6). Moreover, more hinged flat panels similar to the front panel section (3) can be created on the<br>
 <br>
inner walls of the front panel section (3) to hold additional office gadgets like phone, computers etc.<br>
In addition, when the intermediate panel section (2) is opened and the front panel section (3) is closed, the entire arrangement of the device provides a bedroom for relaxation. As shown in FIG. 5, when both the intermediate panel section (2) and the front panel section (3) are opened, the entire arrangement of the device provides a relaxing space along with a working space simultaneously. When none of the panel sections (1-4) are opened, the device appears like a cupboard, with minimum footprint on the ground and a larger portion along the height, in particular the panel sections (1-4) are made flat in completely closed position for space minimization and standing along the wall. For aesthetic purposes, it is also possible to modify the panel sections (1-4) and the flat surfaces by ornamentally modified structures.<br>
Moreover, in one open position, the device serves as an office space with a flat worktable. In another open position, the device offers space for relaxing, with a flat bed without folds-unlike the folding beds that split the bed into two halves and offer minimum support to the waist, which leads to discomfort for the user. In further open position, the device offers both the office space and the bed space simultaneously, with complete privacy. Based on the user requirements, each panel section can be provided with gadgets for self-containment such as lighting and electrical outfits for gadgets like music systems or computers.<br>
The overall description of the device discusses only one form, i.e. the concept of space function modifier modified into home section and office section. It is also possible to have other related variations like office space being substituted by kitchen space or any other utility thereof. Thus, the device can modify the functionality of a space or room into workstation or bedroom or both or any other utilities, depending on the arrangement of panel sections (1-4) of the device. The panel sections and gadgets of the device can serve for various<br>
 <br>
combinations of work related functions like reading, writing or typing, and domestic functions like sleeping, relaxing, cooking or gaming. The outer surface of the panel sections (1-4) can be flat or curved or aesthetically decorated. The device is also arranged with in-built provisions for electrical wiring, sanitation piping, etc, which can be readily connected to the main lines. The device exhibits stand-alone power supply from alternate energy sources like battery, solar panel, etc, and modifications in size to integrally contain functional gadgets as per the user requirements.<br>
Such device enables transformation of space for one activity to another, and acts as a physical interactive interface between the user and the space to aid the transformation of space. It is a unique package of plug and play equipment. The device is customized for any variations and uses the same space for different activities, where the variations can be grouped as single panel section, double panel section, triple panel section and so on, which is based on the number of large panel sections hinged to the left side of the rear panel section (1). The thickness of the front panel section (4) hinged onto the right side of the rear panel section (1) is equal to a sum of the panel section hinged on to the left side of the rear panel section (1). The device can transform a bed space into an office space in no time, which facilitates the user to use both the home and work section without the need for moving to a different place for different activities, which saves lot of time, effort and money, especially for frequent business travelers.<br>
For example, the device can also modify the functionality of a space or room into three variations depending on the arrangement of panel sections (1-4) of the device. In the first variation, the two large panels (2, 3) are hinged on the left side of the rear panel (1) and the small panel (4) is hinged on the right side of the rear panel (1). When the front panel (3) is opened, the table (6) in the panel (3) falls down, which serves as office space. When the panel (2) is opened, the bed (5) comes out of the rear panel (1), which sen/es as bed space. The small<br>
 <br>
panel (4) is used for all the common facilities like television, telephone, small refrigerator kettle, cups, etc., shared by both the office and bed spaces. This variation can generally be used in hotels, office cabins, hostels, temporary office cum stay, etc.<br>
In the second variation, the large panel (3) is hinged to the left side of the rear panel (1) and the small panel (4) is hinged to the right side of the rear panel (1). When the front panel (3) is opened, the bed (5) comes out of the rear panel (1), which serves as dormitory space. When the front panel (3) is closed, the front side of the panel (3) acts as a display and write up board. The small panel (4) is used for all the common facilities in the dormitory and gathering space. Such variation in the device can transform the dormitory space into a gathering or meeting space or an informal classroom, which is used in hostels, residential schools, exhibition places, etc.<br>
In the third variation, the three large panels are hinged to the left side of the rear panel (1) and the small panel (4) is hinged to the right side of the rear panel (1). When the first panel is opened, the table comes out from it, which serves as office space. When the second panel is opened, a cook top comes out from it, which serves as kitchen space. When the third panel is opened, the bed comes out of the rear panel (1), which servers as bed space. The small panel (4) is used for all the common facilities shared by the kitchen, bed and office space. Such variation in the device can transform a single space into a bed space or kitchen space or office space or small empty space as necessary, which is used in single space homes, serviced apartments, resorts, paying guest accommodations, etc.<br>
The device can be single, double or triple paneled based on the functions and the user requirements. The single paneled device creates an office space for interaction with customers when it is opened and uses a display when it is closed, which creates a clutter free display in commercial spaces like automobile<br>
