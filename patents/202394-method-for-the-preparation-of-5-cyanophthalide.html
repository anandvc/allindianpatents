				<td>The present invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of 5-cyanophthalide which is an intermediate used for the manufacture of the well known antidepressant drug citalopram, l-[3-(diraethylamino)propyl]-l-(4-fluorophenyl&gt;l,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile.<br>
Background of the Invention.<br>
Citalopram is a well known antidepressant drug that has now been on the market for some years and has the following structure:<br><br>
It is a selective, centrally active serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) reuptake inhibitor, accordingly having antidepressant activities. The antidepressant activity of the compound has been reported in several publications, eg. J. Hyttel, Prog. Neuro-Psychopharmacol. &amp; Biol Psychiat., 1982, 6, 277-295 and A. Gravem, Acta Psychiatr. Scand., 1987, 75 , 478-486.<br>
Citalopram is prepared by the process described in US Patent No 4,650,884, according to which 5-cyanophthaiide is subjected to two successive GTignard reactions, i.e. with 4-fiuorophenyl magnesium halogenide and HN-dimethylaminopropyl magnesium halogenide, respectively, and the resulting compound of the formula<br><br><br>
is subjected to a ring closure reaction by dehydration with strong sulfuric acid.<br>
Enantiomers of citaloprara may be prepared by the method described in US Patent No 4,943,590, i.e. by separating the enantiomers of the intermediate of Formula H and performing enantioselective ring closure in order to obtain the desired enantiomer.<br>
Thus, 5-cyanophthalide is an important intermediate for the manufacture of citalopram and it is important to produce this material in an adequate quality, by a convenient process and in a cost-effective way.<br>
A method for the preparation of 5-cyanophthalide has previously been described in Bull. Soc. Sci. Bretagne, 1951, 26, 35 and in Levy and Stephen, J. Chem. Soc, 1931, 867. By this method 5-aminophthalide is converted to the corresponding 5-cyanophthalide by diazotation followed by reaction with CuCN. 5-Aminophthalide was obtained from 4-aminophthalimide by a two step reduction procedure.<br>
Synthesis of certain alkyl- and phenylnitriles from acid chlorides is described in Tetrahedron Letters, 1982,23,14,1505 -1508, and in Tetrahedron, 1998, 54,9281.<br>
It has been found that 5-cyanophthalide may be prepared in high yields by a convenient, cost-effective procedure from the 2-(l-oxo-l,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-yl)oxazoline or -thiazoline intermediates of Formula IV.<br><br>
Description of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a novel method for the preparation of 5-cyanophthalide comprising treatment of a compound of Formula IV<br><br>
wherein X is O or S;<br>
R1 - R2 are each independently selected from hydrogen and Ci-6 aUcyl, or R1 and R2 together form a C2.5 alkylene chain thereby forming a spiro-ring; R3 is selected from hydrogen and Ci-* alkyl, R4 is selected from hydrogen, CM alkyl, a carboxy group or a precursor group therefore, or R and R* together form a C2-5 alkylene chain thereby forming a spiro-ring; with a dehydration agent or alternatively where X is S, thermally cleavage of the thiazoline ring or treatment with a radical initiator, such as peroxide or with light, to form 5-cyanophthalide having the formula<br><br>
The dehydration agent may be phosphoroxytrichloride, thionylchloride, phosphorpentachloride, PPA (polyphosphoric acid), and P4O10. The reaction may be carried out in the presence of an organic base, such as pyridine or a catalytic amount of a tertiary amide.<br>
Preferably, the compound of Formula IV is treated with SOCI2 as a dehydrating agent and the reaction is carried out in toluene comprising a catalytic amount of N,N-d^methylformamide.<br><br>
Alternatively, the dehydration agent may be a Vilsmeier reagent, i.e. a compound which is foimed by reaction of a chlorinating agent, preferably an acid chloride, e.g. phosgene, oxalyl chloride, thionyl chloride, phosphoroxychloride, phosphorpentachloride, trichloromethyl chtoroformate, also briefly referred to as "diphosgene", or bis(trichloromethyl) carbonate, also briefly referred to as "triphosgene", with a tertiary amide such as N,N-dimethyIformamide or a N,N-dialkylalkanamide, e.g N,N-dimethyIacetamide. A classic Vilsmeyer reagent is the chloromethylenedbnethyliminium chloride. The Vilsmeier reagent is preferably prepared in situ by adding the chlorinating agent to a mixture containing the starting oxazoline or thiazoline derivative of formula IV and the tertiary amide.<br>
When X is S and the conversion of the thiazoline group into the cyano group is made by thermal transformation, the thermal decomposition of compound IV is preferably carried out in an anhydrous organic solvent, more preferably an aprotic polar solvent, such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, dimethylsulfoxide or acetonitrile. The temperature at which the thermal decomposition transforms the 2-thiazolyl group to a cyano group is between 60 °C and 140 °C. The thermal decomposition may conveniently be carried out by reflux in a suitable solvent, preferably acetonitrile. The thermal cleavage may conveniently be carried out in the presence of oxygen or an oxidation agent. Compounds of Formula TV where X is S and R4 is a carboxy group or a precursor for a carboxy group can also be converted to citalopram by treatment with a radical initiator such as light or peroxides.<br>
Throughout the specification and the claims, Ci-e alkyl refers to a branched or unbranched alkyl group having from one to six carbon atoms inclusive, such as methyl, ethyl, 1-propyl, 2-propyl, 1-butyl, 2-butyl, 2-methyl-2-propyl, 2,2-dimethyl-l-ethyl and 2-methyl- 1-propyl.<br>
Accordingly, by the process of the invention, 5-cyanophthaUde is obtained in high yields and the process is much more convenient than the known process. It is a so-called robust process. The usage of CuCN is eliminated thereby minimising the amount of undesirable by-products and making an environmentally compatible process.<br><br>
In a further aspect, the invention relates to a method for preparing the intermediate of Formula IV comprising:<br><br><br>
Preferably, the Junctional derivative used in step a) is an ester, such as alkylester, arylester or alkylarylester derivative of 5-carboxyphthalide, or an acidhalide derivative of 5-carboxyphthalide,<br>
Preferably, !he dehydrating agent used in step b) is SOCl2, POCI3 and PCI5, most preferably SOCb.<br>
The reaction in step b) is carried out neat or in a suitable solvent, such as toluene, sulfolan or acetonitrile. Furthermore, when a solvent is used, a catalytic amount of N,N-dimethylformamide may be needed, in particular when the dehydrating agent is SOCb- Preferably, toluene is used as the solvent, if necessary in the presence of a catalytic amount of N,N-dimethylformamide.<br>
The reaction in step b) is carried out at elevated temperature, preferably at the reflux temperature of the solvent.<br>
The reaction time is not important and may easily be determined by a person skilled in the art.<br>
The 5-carboxyphthalide used as a starting material may be obtained by the methods described in US patent No 3,607,884 or German patent No 2630927, i.e. by reacting a concentrated solution of terephthalic acid with formaldehyde in liquid SO3 or by electrochemical hydrogenation of trimellithic acid.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the process of the invention, R1 is methyl or ethyl.<br>
5-Cyanophthalide may be isolated in a conventional way, e.g. by addition of water, filtration and subsequent washing of the crystals. Further purification may, if desired, be performed by recrystalUsation.<br>
Accordingly, by the process of the invention, 5-cyanophthalide is obtained by the novel use of the 2-(l-oxo-l,3-a^ydroisobenzofuran-5-yl)oxazoline or -tbiazoline intermediates of Formula IV as reactants. Using these reactants, process conditions<br><br>
are much more convenient than the conditions previously described in the known process for preparing 5-cyanophthaIide, especially with the use of SOCfe as a dehydrating agent.<br>
