				<td>The invention relates to an aqueous, colloidal gas black<br>
suspension, to a process for its production and to its use.<br>
It is known to use aqueous, colloidal carbon black<br>
suspensions to produce paints, printing inks or else<br>
directly as inks, for example in ink jet printers (US-A<br>
5,085,698, US-A 5,320,668).<br>
It is also known to produce carbon black suspensions using<br>
dyes which also act as wetting agents without: the addition<br>
of further wetting agents (US 9,911,935).<br>
It is also known to produce aqueous carbon black<br>
suspensions using water-soluble wetting agents, for example<br>
acrylic resins (US-A 5,609,671) or ethoxylates (DE 19824947<br>
Al) .<br>
EP 1215250 discloses ink jet inks which contain a solvent,<br>
a pigment and also a dye which is soluble in the solvent,<br>
of which the absorption peak is in the wavelength range of<br>
500 nm to 700 nm.<br>
Drawbacks of the known wetting agent-stabilised carbon<br>
black suspensions are, when using non-ionogenic<br>
surfactants, the excessively high zeta potential and the<br>
low surface tension and, when using anionic surfactants,<br>
excessive wetting of the paper owing to the pronounced<br>
interactions with the likewise anionic paper coating, and<br>
these lead to low optical printing densities.<br>
Further drawbacks of the known dye-stabilised carbon black ,<br>
suspensions are the inadequate stability in storage and<br>
freeze-thaw stability. With relatively long service lives<br>
of the dispersions or at storage temperatures of more than<br>
50 °C or less than 0 °C, this leads to a marked and<br>
irreversible increase in the viscosity, to reagglomeration<br>
of the suspended pigment particles or to complete<br><br>
flocculation of the suspension. Ink jet prints with known<br>
dye-stabilised carbon black dispersions also exhibit<br>
insufficient water resistance, and this is a significant<br>
drawback in terms of application technology. When using<br>
furnace carbon blacks a relatively low optical density is<br>
also seen.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an<br>
aqueous gas black suspension having high optical density on<br>
substrates, such as paper, a low zeta potential, a high<br>
surface tension, a low viscosity, good stability in storage<br>
and excellent water resistance in the ink jet print.<br>
The invention relates to an aqueous, colloidal gas black<br>
suspension, which is characterised in that it<br>
i<br>
contains a gas black, an azo compound of general formula 1,<br><br>
wherein R1 - R18 may be identical or different and consist<br>
of hydrogen, hydrophilic or hydrophobic groups, acceptor or<br>
donor substituents or portions of aliphatic, aromatic or<br>
heteroaromatic, acyclic, cyclic or multiply cyclic systems<br>
with acceptor, donor, hydrophilic or hydrophobic groups,<br>
and watper.<br>
Colloidal means the uniform distribution of particles with<br>
a diameter of 10 nm to 10 µm in a suspending medium.<br><br>
Depending on the printing process, a low viscosity may be<br>
advantageous for use in inks, to obtain the desired<br>
printing properties, for example print quality. A low zeta<br>
potential, which describes the charge state of the<br>
particles in the carbon black suspension, is a measured<br>
variable for good stability of the suspension. High surface<br>
tension, for example in ink jet processes, positively<br>
influences droplet formation. A high degree of dispersion<br>
is of fundamental importance for good stability in storage,<br>
for good colour properties in use and for preventing nozzle<br>
blockages, especially in ink jet processes. Good water<br>
resistance of the print is also particularly advantageous,<br>
as external applications are becoming increasingly<br>
important in ink jet processes.<br>
The gas black may have a volatile matter content (950°C) of<br>
may have a BET surface area of 80 to 350 m2/g. The gas<br>
black may have a primary particle size of 8 to 40 ran,<br>
preferably of 13 to 30 nm, particularly preferably of 13 to<br>
20 nm. The gas black may have a DBP number of 40 to 200<br>
ml/100 g.<br>
The gas black may also be a mixture of different gas<br>
blacks.<br>

Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
Production of the carbon black suspensions:<br>
1.	Preparation of the suspension<br>
All components apart from carbon black are introduced into<br>
a container and homogenised while stirring.<br>
The carbon black is gradually incorporated into the<br>
solution while stirring slowly (either manually or using a<br>
slow agitator).	<br>
2.	Dispersion<br>
The suspension prepared under point 1 is dispersed using<br>
the ultrasound equipment. Very coarse particles may be<br>
separated in the centrifuge from the suspension thus<br>
obtained.<br>
Table 1 shows the compositions and properties of reference<br>
suspensions and of the aqueous, colloidal gas black<br>
suspension 1 according to the invention.<br><br><br><br><br>
from Bayer is used as the azo compound of formula 1. This<br>
azo compound has a salt content of 312 ppm.<br>
Determining the salt content<br>
The salt content of the azo compound is the sum of sodium<br>
sulphate measured by the sulphate concentration and<br>
converted to sodium sulphate, and sodium chloride, measured<br>
by the chloride concentration and converted to sodium<br>
chloride.<br>
Determining the sulphate concentration<br>
Basis of the process<br>
A low capacity ion exchanger is used as the separation<br>
column.<br>
The ions were eluted by electrolytes. A conductivity<br>
detector was used for detection.<br>
Chemicals<br>
Ultrapure water (conductivity 
Sulphate stock solution w(SO4) = 1000 mg/1<br>
Eluent Na2CO3/NaHCO3 (2.2/2.8 mmol/1)<br>
Equipment<br>
Tumbler<br><br>
Ion chromatograph with conductivity detector<br>
Low capacity ion exchanger<br>
Principle<br>
The samples were eluted in the tumbler at ambient<br>
temperature for 1 hour with ultrapure water and sulphate<br>
determined by ion chromatography in the eluate..<br>
Implementation<br>
About 200 mg sample were weighed into a closable test tube<br>
and eluted in the tumbler at ambient temperature for 1 hour<br>
with ultrapure water.<br>
The suspension was then transferred to a measuring flask<br>
and filled up to the mark with ultrapure water. The<br>
measuring flask should be selected such that the sample<br>
solution contains 0.5 to 40 mg/1 SO42".<br>
The sample solution was injected via a 0.2 urn injection<br>
filter into the ion chromatograph. The sulphate<br>
concentration was calculated using the measured peak area.<br>
  L<br><br>
Determining the chloride concentration<br>
Basis of the process<br>
To determine the chloride content, the sample was suspended<br>
using ultrapure water.<br>
The chloride concentration was determined by argentometric<br>
titration.<br>
Chemicals<br>
Ultrapure water (conductivity 
Chloride stock solution, c(Cl") = 0.1000 ± 0.0005 mol/1<br>
Silver nitrate solution, c(AgNO3) =0.1 mol mol/1 and 0.01<br>

Nitric acid w(HNO3) = 30 %<br>
Equipment<br>
Titroprocessor 670 (Metrohm)<br>
Silver rod electrode<br>
Reference electrode (Hg/HgSO4)<br>
Principle<br>
After formation of a slurry, the suspension was acidified<br>
and titrated with silver nitrate.<br>
Implementation<br>
About 1 to 3 g of the sample were weighed to exactly 1 mg<br>
into a beaker.<br>
After addition of about 80 ml ultrapure water, the mixture<br>
was stirred and the material adhering to the glass wall<br>
above the liquid level was rinsed down with water.<br>
After 5 min, the sample was acidified using nitric acid,<br>
the electrodes and the burette tip were immersed in the<br>
suspension and potentiometrically titrated.<br>
Calculation<br>
The percentage mass fraction w of chloride was calculated<br>
to<br><br><br>
The aqueous, colloidal gas black suspension 1 according to<br>
the invention is of low viscosity and has a high optical<br>
density, good stability in storage, a high degree of<br>
dispersion and excellent water resistance of the dried<br>
print.<br>
Fig. 1 shows light microscopic photographs of the reference<br>
suspension 3 and of the aqueous, colloidal gas black<br>
suspension 1 according to the invention. The reference<br>
suspensions 1 to 3 have a large coarse fraction and are<br>
partially flocculated and sedimented and therefore do not<br>
meet the requirements of an ink jet ink. By contrast, the<br>
gas black suspension 1 according to the invention does not<br>
have a coarse fraction and has outstanding stability in<br>
storage (no sediment).<br>
Example 2<br>
Table 2 shows the dependence of aqueous, colloidal gas<br>
black suspensions 1 to 4 according to the invention on the<br>
salt content.<br><br><br>
The aqueous, colloidal gas black suspensions 1 to 4<br>
according to the invention show that even a slight increase<br>
in the salt content causes a marked increase in viscosity,<br>
so, with regard to metering capacity, pumping capacity and<br>
long-term stability, they have insufficient properties to<br>
be used, for example, in ink jet processes. The aqueous,<br>
colloidal gas black suspension 1 according to the invention<br>
is thin and may therefore be easily metered and pumped.<br>
Owing to the excellent stability in storage even when<br>
stored in heat over 28 days, the gas black suspension 1<br><br>
according to the invention has the best properties for use,<br>
for example in the ink. jet process.<br>
Example 3<br>
Table 3 shows the properties of reference suspensions with<br>
addition of anionic (reference suspension 4) and non-ionic<br>
(reference suspension 5) wetting agent in comparison with<br>
the aqueous, colloidal gas black suspension 1 according to<br>
the invention.<br><br>

sulphanatophenyl) azo] -1-naphth-l-yl] azo] naphthalene-2,7-<br>
disulphonate from Bayer.<br>
In comparison with the aqueous, colloidal gas black<br>
suspension 1 according to the invention, the reference<br>
suspensions 4 and 5 stabilised with wetting agent have an<br>
excessive zeta potential and a low surface tension when<br>
using non-ionogenic surfactants (5), whereas excessive<br>
wetting of the paper and therefore an inadequate optical<br>
density is observed when using anionic surfactants (4),<br>
owing to the pronounced interactions with the likewise<br>
anionic paper coatings (Table 3).<br>

Table 4 shows the properties of a dye-containing reference<br>
suspension (6) in comparison with the aqueous, colloidal<br>

dispersion: The degree of dispersion was evaluated with<br>
400x magnification. With this setting, coarse particles &gt; 1<br>
urn may be easily detected using the scale on the light<br>
microscope.<br>
Rating:<br>
Grade 1: very good; no coarse fractions &gt; 1 urn,<br>
Grade 2: satisfactory; very few coarse fractions &gt; 1 µm,<br>
Grade 3: poor; large number of coarse particles &gt; 1 µm.<br>
Determining the viscosity:<br>
The rheological behaviour was detected in a rotation<br>
experiment with a critical shear rate (CSR) using a Physica<br>
Rheometer UDS 200. The viscosity value was read off at a<br>
shear rate of 1000 s-1.<br>
Determining the mean particle size:<br>
The particle size distribution was determined using a<br>
photon correlation spectrometer (PCS), Horiba LB-500 type,<br>
and the "median value" shown read off as the mean particle<br>
size. Measurement was carried out on an undiluted sample of<br>
suspension.<br>
Determining the surface tension:<br>
The dynamic surface tension was determined using the<br>
Blasentensiometer BP2 from Kruss. The end value was read<br>
off at 3,000 ms.<br>
Stability in storage test at 50 °C over 28 days:<br>
The samples were stored at 50 °C for 28 days. The viscosity<br>
and sedimentation tendency were investigated.<br><br>
Each 300 ml of suspension sample were stored in the drying<br>
cabinet for 28 days at 50 °C in a closed glass bottle. The<br>
formation of sediment on the base was investigated using a<br>
spatula and the viscosity measured using a Brookfield<br>
Viscosimeter DV II plus. In addition, the formation of<br>
sediment on some samples was investigated during storage at<br>
ambient temperature.<br>
Freeze-thaw stability test:<br>
The samples were frozen at -25°C and, after thawing, the<br>
degree of dispersion was investigated using a light<br>
microscope.<br>
A sample is judged to be freeze-thaw stable it, after<br>
thawing, the previously frozen sample has a thin<br>
consistency again, does not form a sediment and no<br>
reagglomerations are visible under the light microscope.<br>
Determining the pH:<br>
The pH of the undiluted suspension was determined using the<br>
pH-Meter CG 837 from Schott. For this purpose, the glass<br>
electrode was immersed in the solution and the temperature-<br>
corrected pH was read off after 5 minutes.<br>
Determining the zeta potential:<br>
The zeta potential was determined using a MBS-8000 from<br>
Matec. The samples were measured undiluted. The zeta<br>
potential was determined by means of electrokinetic sound<br>
amplitude (ESA).<br>
Water resistance:<br>
To assess the water resistance, inks with a 4.5 % carbon<br>
black content were produced from the suspensions with the<br>
following formulation:<br>
30.0 % gas black suspension<br><br>
12.0	% 2-pyrrolidone<br>
3.0	% Liponic EG 07<br>
1.2	% IDID @ solv.hd<br>
4.0	% IDIS @ solv.pd<br>
49.8	% deion. water<br>
Print demos were produced on copier paper using an ink jet<br>
office printer HP Deskjet 6122 and dried for 24 hours at<br>
ambient temperature. The print demos were submerged in a<br>
photographic tray in distilled water and soaked for 5 min.<br>
After the soaking period, the prints were removed from the<br>
water bath and dried for 24 hours at ambient temperature.<br>
The water resistance was evaluated by visual assessment of<br>
the discolouration of the copier paper.<br>
Rating:<br>
Very good = no discoloration of the paper<br>
Poor = discoloration of the paper<br>
The aqueous, colloidal gas black suspension 5 according to<br>
the invention has improved water resistance compared to the<br>
reference suspension 6. The aqueous, colloidal gas black<br>
suspension 5 according to the invention meets all the<br>
requirements of an optimal suspension.<br>
Example 5<br>
Inks with a 4.5% carbon black content were produced from<br>
the gas black suspension 5 according to the invention using<br>
2-pyrrolidone, 1,2-hexanediol, 1,3 propanediol, ethoxylated<br>
glycerol, dimethylaminoethanol and deionised water. For<br>
this purpose, the premix was presented to ink additives and<br>
the carbon black suspension carefully added while stirring.<br>
The finished ink was filtered at a filtering fineness of<br><br>
500 Nm. 6 urn draw downs were then produced on copier paper<br>
(Kompass Copy Office type) using the K Control Coater and<br>
the optical density was determined after 24 hours using a<br>
densitometer.<br>
The print tests were carried out using a Canon Office BJC-<br>
S750 printer. For this purpose, the ink was deaerated in<br>
advance under vacuum and poured into a cleaned original<br>
printer cartridge.<br>
The following print tests were carried out:<br>
a.	Print one side of copier paper and various conventional<br>
commercial ink jet papers to determine the optical density<br>
and for visual assessment of the print quality.<br>
b.	Ref'ire tests after 1, 3, and 7 days' pause in printing<br>
to assess the write-on and dry-on behaviour of the ink.<br>
I<br>
Table 5 compiles the print results.<br>
The inks according to the invention are distinguished by<br>
very good printability, high optical densities and very<br>
good stability in storage.<br><br><br><br><br>
The same azo compound was used as the azo compound of<br>
general formula 1 as in the aqueous, colloidal gas black<br>
suspension 1 according to the invention (tetrasodium-6-<br>
amino-4-hydroxy-3-[ [ 7-sulphonato-4-[ (4-<br>
sulphonatophenyl) azo] -1-naphth-l-yl] azo] naphthaiene-2 , 7-<br>
disulphonate.<br>
An ink according to the invention with a 2 % gas black<br>
content was produced from the gas black suspension<br>
according to the invention using ethanol, ethyleneglycol,<br><br>
1,2 hexanediol and deionised water. For this purpose, the<br>
premix was introduced to the ink additives and the carbon<br>
black suspension carefully added while stirring..<br>
The degree of dispersion was assessed using the light<br>
microscope.<br>
Fig. 2 shows light microscopic photographs of the inks 2<br>
and 3 according to the invention and Fig. 3 shows light<br>
microscopic photographs of the reference ink 1. The<br>
reference ink 1 has a very large coarse fraction and is<br>
virtually completely flocculated, while the ink 3 according<br>
to the invention is partially flocculated and the ink 2<br>
according to the invention is not flocculated at all. In<br>
particular, the ink 2 according to the invention has a high<br>
degree,of dispersion and no coarse fractions.<br>
The two inks according to the invention based on gas black<br>
produce very high optical densities on copier paper, while<br>
the reference ink with furnace carbon black produces<br>
substantially lower optical densities on copier paper.<br><br>
