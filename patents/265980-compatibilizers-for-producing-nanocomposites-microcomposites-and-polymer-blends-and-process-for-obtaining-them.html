				<td>COMPATIBILIZERS FOR PRODUCING NANOCOMPOSITES.<br>
MICROCOMPOSITES AND POLYMER BLENDS AND PROCESS FOR OBTAINING<br>
THEM<br>
Purpose of the invention<br>
The present invention comprises new compatibilizers to be used for obtaining<br>
materials called nanocomposites, microcomposites, and polymer blends of<br>
polyolefins, and it includes the process for obtaining such compatibilizers. Those<br>
compatibilizers are obtained from the monomers of the organic compounds Itaconic<br>
acid (ITA) or its monooctadecyl itaconate (MODIT) derivative. The compatibilizers are<br>
polyolefins grafted with theses monomers, which are characterized by having<br>
functional groups with a hydrophilic character and a polymer backbone with a<br>
hydrophobic character. The compatibilizers of this invention are characterized by<br>
having controlled degrees of grafting of these monomers, and they may be used<br>
optimally according to their application. For example, the compatibilizers of this<br>
invention allow modified clays to be dispersed in polyolefin matrices to form clay<br>
nanocomposites, as well as to prepare microcomposites facilitating the dispersion of<br>
polar microparticles in the polyolefins and also to produce polyolefin and elastomer<br>
blends, improving the interaction between polyolefins and elastomers. With the<br>
present invention nanocomposites, microcomposites and polyolefin blends can be<br>
obtained that are characterized by an improved mechanical and thermal behavior<br>
compared to that of nanocomposites, microcomposites and polyolefin blends that use<br>
compatibilizers such as polyolefins grafted with maleic anhydride. The<br>
nanocomposites, microcomposites and blends obtained from this invention may be<br>
used in all the fields and applications which require them, such as the automotive,<br>
electronics, packaging, textile and construction fields, among others.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
With polyolefins like polyethylene and polypropylene one can mnufacture a<br>
variety of finished molded or injected products, tubes, thin films and fibers that have<br>
excellent chemical, physical and mechanical properties. These polyolefins, however,<br>
have disadvantages that restrict considerably their applications. For example, if a<br><br>
polyolefin is used as a structural plastic, it may be inadequate for that purpose<br>
because of its insufficient mechanical resistance, dimensional stability and resistance<br>
to temperature changes. With the purpose of reinforcing these properties, the<br>
incorporation of reinforcing materials like glass fibers or of an inorganic reinforcement<br>
in the polyolefin can improve those properties. This procedure, however, is insufficient<br>
to provide effective reinforcement because the adhesion between the reinforcement<br>
and the polyolefin is not strong. For that reason there are alternative procedures that<br>
have been implemented for reinforcing polyolefins, such as, for example, the use of<br>
block copolymers or graft copolymeros that contain polar groups as compatibilizers,<br>
which are applied to improve the adhesion of the reinforcement with the polyolefin,<br>
thus improving its mechanical properties.<br>
Materials made of organic and inorganic compounds, of polymers and<br>
inorganic reinforcements of nanometric size are innovative materials that are currently<br>
being investigated and developed. These materials or composites have a double<br>
phase in which at least one of them is dispersed in a nanometric or micrometric state.<br>
Compatibility between the two phases, such as clay and polymer, for example, is<br>
always essential for good dispersion. In the case of siliceous laminar clays, which are<br>
hydrophylic and immiscible with organic compounds, the space between the sheets is<br>
modified when an organic compound like a quaternary ammonium salt is introduced<br>
as an intercalation agent. In principle, the space between the sheets is increased by<br>
the intercalation agents, and it needs to be sufficiently wide to facilitate the entry of<br>
polymer molecules to obtain intercalated and/or exfoliated composite. In the case of<br>
exfoliation the distance between the sheets disappears and the clay sheets are<br>
dispersed randomly in the polymer matrix.<br>
Commercial intercalation agents like the protonated aliphatic amines are<br>
appropriate for smectic type clays like montmorillonite, which can be dispersed in<br>
different polymer matrices to obtain a compound nanomaterial or nanocomposite.<br>
Those kinds of intercalation agents can increase the interiaminar distance of the clay<br>
to the order of 13 to 18 A. Thus it is possible to obtain a compound based on a<br><br>
polymer matrix and the clay which is found in some degree of dispersion, intercalated<br>
and/or partially or totally exfoliated.<br>
Japanese patent No. 8-22946 applies the first commercial inorganic/organic-<br>
polymer nanocomposite. This composite is produced by dispersing montmorillonite<br>
intercalated with an amino-carboxylic acid (H3N+(CH2)11COO) in poly(e-caprolactam)<br>
or Nylon 6. In the case of nonpolar polymers \ike polyethylene and polypropylene,<br>
compounds like amino-carboxylic acids do not allow dispersion of the clays, which are<br>
hydrophilic in these polymers. Moreover, other intercalation agents for clays have<br>
been reported that allow the interiaminar distance to be increased. However, these<br>
agents do not modify sufficiently the polarity of the clays. The main problem will<br>
therefore be the loss of compatibility between the hydrophilic clay and the nonpolar<br>
hydrophobic organic polymer.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Polypropylene (PP) has been recognized as one of the most widely used<br>
thermoplastics in recent years because of its high availability in the market, its wide<br>
range of properties, and its low cost. In spite of all these advantages, PP has some<br>
deficiencies for certain applications, like its low impact resistance at low<br>
temperatures, for example. To overcome these deficiencies, one of the alternative<br>
methods is to prepare composites by mixing the polymer with micro- and/or<br>
nanometric-sized reinforcements. The challenge of achieving a good result using this<br>
alternative method refers to the optimization of the adhesion of the reinforcing<br>
material with the polymer matrix, and this results in an increase of the degree de<br>
dispersion and a reduction in the size of the reinforcement, as well as an increase of<br>
the interfacial interaction between the components of the mixture.<br>
Reinforcements based on particles, whether they are in the micrometer or the<br>
nanometer size range, are characterized by the different degree of surface to volume<br>
ratio. The optimization of this ratio is an important parameter when these particles are<br>
used as reinforcing agents for polymers. Some examples are the studies on the<br>
SiO2/PP system composites with micro- or nanoparticles of SiO2, in which a slight<br><br>
improvement is achieved in mechanical properties such as impact and tensile<br>
resistance as well as elongation at breakage. However, the use of PP grafted with<br>
maleic anhydride groups as compatibilizers allowed the elimination of silica<br>
aglomerates in the composite and therefore improved its mechanical properties and<br>
the particle/PP-matrix interface.<br>
On the other hand, research on polymer materials with new property profiles<br>
has stimulated interest in polymer blends and reactive processes. In recent years<br>
many new blends have been developed in the market. Although some of them are<br>
homogeneous mixtures of polymers, most of the commercial blends consist of<br>
immiscible polymers and contain two or more polymer phases. This is due to poor<br>
polymer-polymer interaction. Their properties depend on composition as well as on<br>
morphology, and they can be improved dramatically by adding an adequate<br>
compatibilizer, and therefore they are incompatible and have low tensile and impact<br>
resistance. An effective compatibilizer is obtained, for example, by grafting a<br>
compound that has carboxyl groups. In those cases the variables to be considered<br>
are compatibilizer concentration and mixing strategies in the morphology of the<br>
blends, as well as the effect of their morphology on mechanical properties and<br>
crystallization behavior.<br>
Among the compounds used most commonly as raw materials to obtain polyolefin<br>
and polar compatibilizers are monomers with a hydrophilic character and in particular<br>
mono-, di- or polycarboxylic organic compounds, in addition to the aforementioned<br>
maleic anhydride, among others. Itaconic acid (ITA) is therefore a polar organic<br>
compound that has been used as additive in combination with other similar organic<br>
compounds in materials formulations. However, the authors of this Invention have<br>
reported in the scientific literature only the specific grafting of ITA with a polyolefin in<br>
solution, that is, using aromatic solvents. In this way a low degree of ITA grafting on<br>
the polyolefin and extensive degradation of the polyolefin are achieved. Moreover, an<br>
excessive use of high cost and harmful aromatic solvent is required. Pesetskll and<br>
collaborators (J. Appl. Polym. SCi. ,86, 64-72 :2002) have reported on the grafting of<br>
ITA and glicidil-metacrylate in PP but using a more complex process. They obtained<br><br>
lower degrees of grafting and without informing the reproducibility of the percentages<br>
of grafting obtained. They also concluded that independent of the type of peroxide or<br>
monomer used in the grafting reactions, a considerable degradation of the polyolefin<br>
was occurred even at low peroxide concentration, resulting in the significant increase<br>
of the melt flow index of the PP.<br>
The ITA or MODIT in this invention have been grafted in a controlled manner<br>
on polyolefins for the preparation of compalibilizers, and the degree of degradation of<br>
the initial polymer is also restricted. The use of the compatibilizers obtained in the<br>
present invention for the preparation of composites and polyolefin blends comprises,<br>
on the one hand, a new and alternative procedure, and on the other hand it is used<br>
alone and without considering prior treatments or mixtures with other similar organic<br>
compounds.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present invention relates to compatibilizers produced by the grafting<br>
reaction in the molten state of organic compounds like the monomers of itaconic acid<br>
and/or its monooctadecyl itaconate derivative on polyolefins, characterized by having<br>
different degrees of grafting of those monomers in the polyolefin. It also relates to the<br>
processes for:<br>
i) Obtaining these compatibilizers with a predefined (controlled) degree of<br>
grafting,<br>
ii) Determination of the degree of monomer grafting on the polyolefin in the<br>
compatibilizers.<br>
iii) Obtaining nanocomposites, microcomposites and polyolefin blends using<br>
these compatibilizers. These composites and blends are applicable in the<br>
automotive, electronics, packaging, textile and construction industries, among<br>
others. The components of these composites and polyolefin blends are<br>
mainly: i) nanoparticles or microparticles of elastomers; ii) compatibilizers of<br>
this invention; and iii) antioxidants. With the present invention one can obtain<br>
nanocomposites, microcomposites and polyolefin blends using compatibilizers<br><br>
of this invention (polyolefins grafted with monomers with a controlled degree of<br>
grafting) with an improved mechanical and thermal behavior with respect to<br>
the nanocomposites, microcomposites and polyolefin blends that use organic<br>
compounds and compatibilizers such as polyolefins grafted with maleic<br>
anhydride, among others.<br>
For a better understanding of the invention, the following temns are defined as:<br>
1.	compatibilizer: an organic compound that allows two or more chemicals such<br>
as, for example, a polymer and micro- or nanometric particles to mix without<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Specifically, this invention relates to connpatibilizers such as, for example,<br>
polyolefin grafted with the monomer of itaconic acid (ITA) or its monooctadecyl<br>
itaconate (MODIT) derivative. These compatibilizers are characterized particularly by<br>
having a controlled and reproducible degree of monomer grafting.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of these compatibilizers to obtain<br>
nanocomposites, microcomposites and polyolefin blends, and it also describes the<br>
procedure for obtaining them.<br>
The compatibilizers are produced by means of a procedure starting from the<br>
grafting reaction of the monomers on a polyolefin by melt mixing and the use of<br>
initiators and antioxidants.<br>
Moreover, the process for obtaining the nanocomposites, microcomposites and<br>
polyolefin blends using the compatibilizers developed in this invention comprises the<br>
dosing and sequential mixing of the components of the nanocomposite or<br>
microcomposite or blend, that is: i) molten polyolefins; ii) nanoparticles or modified<br>
nanoparticles or microparticles or elastomers or modified elastomers; iii)<br>
compatibilizers of this invention; and iv) antioxidants, all this in a stream of an inert<br>
gas like nitrogen, argon, helium, among others, followed by pressing the resultant<br>
material of the mixing, and finally grinding the pressed material.<br>
The present invention comprises:<br>
1. Use of altemative organic substances as compatibilizers to be applied for obtaining<br>
nanocomposites, microcomposites and polymer blends.<br>
These organic substances or compatibilizers considered in this invention<br>
include the preparation of polyolefins with a polar character by means of the<br>
incorporation of polar groups from the ITA or its MODIT derivative.<br>
Some of these alternative organic substances are polyolefins modified with ITA<br>
or its MODIT derivative incorporated in their polymer chains. That is, a compound<br>
based on a polyolefin that contains polar carboxyl and/or ester groups from the ITA or<br>
its MODIT derivative. Moreover, these modified polyolefins developed in this invention<br>
as alternative organic substances, have a higher degree of polarity than similar<br><br>
compounds such as polyolefins grafted with maleic anhydride (MAA). Also, these<br>
modified polyolefins are characterized by having a controlled degree of grafting of the<br>
monomers in the polymer matrix. The most widely used organic substances are<br>
polyolefins modified with MAA that have a lower degree of polarity than the organic<br>
substances developed in this invention.<br>
Furthermore, it must be pointed out that the compounds considered in this<br>
invention use ITA, which has the great advantage of being obtained from natural and<br>
renewable resources, that is, they are obtained, for example, by the fementation of<br>
molasses, while maleic anhydride is a synthetic product, not a natural one.<br>
In particular, the ITA monomer that is used in this invention has also found<br>
other applications in the development of some materials with specific functions due to<br>
its hydrophilic character as well as because of its high chemical reactivity associated<br>
with its carboxyl groups. However, in all its aplications, described in numerous<br>
scientific papers as well as in industrial patents, it is used together with other<br>
compounds with similar polarity in various polymer formulations, but not as a<br>
compatibilizer.<br>
On the other hand, the use of the MODIT monomer has not been reported so<br>
far either in the scientific literature or in industrial patents leading to the preparation of<br>
some compound or material as in the applications described in this invention.<br>
These alternative organic substances are then treated with polyolefins to<br>
prepare the compatibilizers of this invention.<br>
2. Procedure for obtaining these organic substances as compatibilizers as well as for<br>
obtaining nanocomposites, microcomposites and polymer blends.<br>
The preparation of the organic substances such as the polar polyolefins takes<br>
place by a procedure like the grafting reaction of polar organic compounds such as<br>
ITA or its MODIT derivative to the polyolefins. The grafting reaction comprises a<br>
process in the molten state between the polyolefin and the polar organic compound in<br>
a discontinuous mixer.<br><br>
This mixing procedure makes it possible to prepare polar polyoleflns with a<br>
high and controlled degree of grafting of the organic compound, for example itaconic<br>
acid, which corresponds to a procedure that is different from the process that uses<br>
specially designed extruders to carry out the same kind of modifications, as in the<br>
case of the grafting of MAA on the polyolefins.<br>
Moreover, the use of extruders for making polyolefins grafted with maleic<br>
anhydride (PP-g-AMA) has as a consequence the formation of modified polyolefins<br>
with a low degree of grafting and highly degraded, and therefore with lower polarity<br>
compared to the grafting process of ITA and/or its derivatives like MODIT to<br>
polyolefins considered in this invention.<br>
It is necessary to point out that the use of an extruder in the procedure for the<br>
preparation of grafted polyolefins corresponds to a more effective melt mixing<br>
process, but in spite of that it produces a lower degree of grafting, that is, this process<br>
would have a low yield for the preparation of modified polyolefins with a high degree<br>
of grafting like that achieved in the case of the modified polyolefins developed in this<br>
invention using ITA and/or MODIT in a discontinuous mixer.<br>
In the case of obtaining the nanocomposites, this invention comprises the use<br>
of hybrid clays or clays modified with an amine, octadecylamine (ODA), by means of<br>
an ion exchange reaction, that is, a procedure for intercalation in solution. The hybrid<br>
clays are used to obtain the so called "masterbatch," which consists in mixing the<br>
hybrid clay with the polyolefin, in the molten state, together with the modified<br>
polyolefins or compatibilizers of this invention, characterized by the degree of<br>
controlled monomer grafting on the polyoiefin. The degree of grafting of the<br>
compatibilizer is specific for a type of hybrid or modified clay with the aim of preparing<br>
a nanocomposite with improved mechanical properties. In some cases, depending on<br>
the cation exchange capacity of the clay, it may need a compatibilizer with a higher or<br>
lower degree of grafting. The preparation of the nanocomposites is carried out in a<br>
manner similar to that described for the preparation of the modified polyolefins, that<br>
is, in a discontinuous mixer. Therefore the process comprises the melt mixing of a<br>
given amount of the masterbatch with the polyolefin that constitutes the matrix of the<br><br>
nanocomposite. The use of a discontinuous mixer corresponds to a procedure that<br>
differs from the process that uses speciallly designed extruders for preparing this kind<br>
of nanocomposite.<br>
On the other hand, the procedure for obtaining microcomposites and polymer<br>
blends uses the compatibilizers or polar polyolefins developed in this invention. The<br>
procedure for preparing these microcomposites also corresponds to a procedure<br>
similar to that for the preparation of the polar polyolefins (compatibiiizers) and<br>
nanocomposites.<br>
Therefore the invention comprises procedures for obtaining:<br>
•	Compatibilizer based on polypropylene grafted with ITA (PP-g-ITA) containing<br>
0.5-2.0% by weight of ITA (Procedure 1) and the quantitative determination of<br>
the actual graft on the polyolefin (Procedure 1a).<br>
•	Compatibilizer based on polypropylene grafted with MODIT (PP-g-MODIT)<br>
containing 0.5-2.0 % by weight of MODIT (Procedure 2) and the quantitative<br>
determination of the actual graft on the polyolefin (Procedure 2a).<br>
•	Nanocomposites from modified clays (clays intercalated with an amine like<br>
octadecylamine (ODA)) and PP-g-ITA or PP-g-MODIT compatibilizer of this<br>
invention (Procedure 3).<br>
•	Microcomposites based on polyolefms and PP-g-ITA or PP-g-MODIT<br>
compatibilizer of this invention (Procedure 4).<br>
•	Blends of polyolefin and PP-g-ITA or PP-g-MODIT compatibilizer of this<br>
invention (Procedure 5).<br>
Procedure 1<br>
Obtaining the compatibilizer polyolefin grafted with itaconic acid (PP-g-ITA).<br>
The compatibilizer, PP-g-ITA, is the polyolefin grafted with itaconic acid, and it<br>
is used in the process of obtaining nanocomposites, microcomposites and the<br>
polyolefin blends. Polypropylene and other polyolefins were used as compounds<br>
based on homopolymers of ethylene and propylene, as well as copolymers of those<br>
homopolymers with alpha olefins.<br><br>
The preparation of PP-g-ITA compatibilizer with different degrees of ITA<br>
grafting in the polyolefin comprises the following stages:<br>
a)	Dosing and mixing, in a discontinuoous mixer at 180-190 °C during 10-15 minutes<br>
at 75 - 90 rpm under a stream of inert gas such as nitrogen, for example, of:<br>
i) polypropylene (PP) (90-99% by weight);<br>
ii) itaconic acid (1-5% by weight);<br>
ill) initiator such as dicumyl peroxide (0.5-1.0 % by weight); and<br>
iv) antioxidants such as beta-hydroxytoluene or Pentaerythritol tetrakis(3,5-di-tert-<br>
butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl-propenoate) (Irganox 1010®) and Tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)<br>
phosphite (Irgafos 168) in a 2/1 ratio (0.02-0.03% by weight).<br>
b)	Pressing at 4-6 MPa and 60-80 °C of the resultant mass from the discontinuous<br>
mixer to obtain 1-2-mm thick plates.<br>
c)	Grinding the pressed material obtained in stage (b) into rectangular pieces about 1<br>
to 3 mm on each side.<br>
From this material the sheet and/or film is obtained to determine quantitatively<br>
the percentage by weight of actual ITA graft on PP by infrared analysis.<br>
Procedure 1a<br>
Determination of the actual ITA grafting degree on the polypropylene homopoiymer.<br>
The procedure for quantifying the percentage of actual ITA grafting on PP<br>
consists in preparing physical mixtures, in the molten state, of PP and ITA in the<br>
discontinuous mixing equipment under controlled temperature, time and mixing<br>
speed. The carbonyl index (CI) of the mixtures with different proportions of ITA on PP<br>
was determined, and from the average value of the CI for each of the mixtures a<br>
calibration curve was obtained that relates that CI value with the percentage of ITA<br>
graft present in the mixture (GITA). With this calibration it was possible to determine<br>
the percentage of actual ITA grafting on the PP. The CI was defined by the ratio of<br>
the intensity of the absorption bands centered at 1712 cm-1 and 1788 cm-1<br>
corresponding to the acid and anhydride carbonyl groups of the ITA molecule, and<br><br>
the intensity of the absorption band centered at 1167 cm-1 which corresponds to the<br>
absorption band of the CH3 groups of the PP used as reference.<br>
Procedure 2<br>
Obtaining the compatibilizer polyolefin grafted with MODIT (PP-g-MODIT).<br>
The procedure for obtaining the compatibilizer based on polyolefin and grafted<br>
with the MODIT monomer is similar to that described for obtaining the PP-g-ITA<br>
compatibilizer (Procedure 1), but in stage (a) part (ii) the ITA monomer is replaced by<br>
MODIT.<br>
Procedure 2a<br>
Determination of the degree of actual MODIT grafting on the polypropylene<br>
homopolymer.<br>
The determination of the degree of actual MODIT grafting on the polypropylene<br>
homopolymer is similar to that described for obtaining the degree of actual ITA<br>
grafting on the PP-g-ITA compatibilizer (Procedure 1a), replacing the ITA monomer<br>
by MODIT.<br>
Procedure 3<br>
Obtaining nanocomposites based on modified clays of the smectic type (clays<br>
intercalated with the amine ODA) and PP-g-ITA or PP-g-MODIT compatibilizer of this<br>
invention.<br>
It comprises the following stages:<br>
a)	Obtaining the hybrid clay by means of the organic modification of smectic clay<br>
through the cation exchange reaction with an amine such as ODA in an acid<br>
medium (pH 2.8-3.2, at 25-30 °C).<br>
b)	Preparation of the masterbatch, which comprises mixing the hybrid clay from<br>
stage (a) and the PP-g-ITA or PP-g-MODIT compatibilizer of this invention.<br>
This mixture, which contains a hybrid clay/compatibilizer ratio of 1/3, is made in<br><br>
a discontinuous mixer at 75-90 rpm, 190-195 °C, during 10-15 minutes in a<br>
stream of an inert gas such as nitrogen,<br>
c) Obtaining the nanocomposite by dilution of the masterbatch with polyolefin in a<br>
discontinuous mixer in the molten state and a composition between 1-5% of<br>
hybrid clay in the polyolefin.<br>
Stage (a), obtaining the hybrid clay, is carried out according to the procedure<br>
developed and optimized as part of this invention and applicable to smectic type<br>
clays. The hybrid clay corresponds to a clay with its sheet layers more separated due<br>
to the partial replacement of the interlaminar cations of the clay by aliphatic chain<br>
amino groups. This greater separation of the sheet layers in the hybrid clay has been<br>
detennined and verified by X-ray diffraction. The replacement of the interchangeable<br>
cations of the clay takes place through the cation exchange reaction, in this case<br>
using an aliphatic amine like ODA. The clay is hybrid due to the presence of an<br>
inorganic surface layer of cations in the clay and the organic layer corresponding to<br>
the replacement of the interlaminar cations in the clay by the aliphatic amine. The<br>
procedure for obtaining the hybrid clay comprises the mixing of the aqueous<br>
suspension of clay (8-10 g/l) and the alcoholic solution of the commercial amine (3.0-<br>
3.2 g/l), followed by its isolation by filtration. The optimization of this procedure<br>
involves considering the mixing parameters of the solutions used for obtaining the<br>
hybrid clay, that is time (2-3 h), mixing temperature (25-30 °C) and pH 2.8-3.2.<br>
Stage (b), preparation of the masterbatch, is carried out in a discontinuous<br>
mixer in the molten state under controlled temperature (190-195 °C), time (10-15<br>
min) and stirring (75-90 rpm). The components of the masterbatch are: i) hybrid clay,<br>
ii) PP-g-ITA or PP-g-MODlT compatibilizer of this invention, and iii) antioxidants. The<br>
weight ratio of hybrid clay/compatibilizer is 1/3 in the masterbatch. The antioxidant<br>
composition in the masterbatch can be between 0.02-0.03% by weight of the total<br>
masterbatch mass. This mixture is selective, that is, a compatibilizer with a fixed<br>
degree of grafting is recommended for a specific clay with the purpose of optimizing<br>
the distribution of the components in the masterbatch.<br><br>
Stage (c), obtaining the clay nanocomposites, comprises the dispersion of the<br>
masterbatch by dilution with polyolefin in the molten state in the discontinuous mixer<br>
under controlled temperature, time and stirring (190-195 °C, 10-15 min, 75-90 rpm).<br>
The result of this process is to obtain clays with a high degree of exfoliation, that is, a<br>
system composed of nanosheets of clay dispersed homogeneously in the polymer<br>
matrix. The degree of dilution of the clay includes the range of 1-5% by weight of<br>
hybrid clay in the nanocomposite. The process of dilution in the molten state is carried<br>
out in a discontinuous mixer in a stream of inert gas such as nitrogen whose function<br>
is to replace the oxidizing environment (air) in the mixer's chamber and prevent the<br>
oxidation of the polyolefin. Furthermore, 0.02-0.03% by weight of antioxidants like<br>
beta-hydroxytoluene or Pentaerythritol tetrakis(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl-<br>
propenoate) (Irganox 1010®) and Tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphite (Irgafos 168)<br>
were used in a 2/1 ratio in the mixer.<br>
Procedure 4<br>
Obtaining microcomposites based on polyolefins and PP-g-ITA or PP-g-MODIT<br>
compatibilizers of this invention.<br>
The procedure describes the preparation of PP microcomposites (40-90% by<br>
weight) using microparticles such as talc, natural and synthetic calcium carbonate, as<br>
well as cellulose fibers (10-60% by weight) as polyolefin reinforcing agents, PP-g-ITA<br>
or PP-g-MODIT compatibilizers of this invention (1.0-9.0% by weight) and an<br>
antioxidant such as beta-hydroxytoluene (BHT) or Pentaerythritol tetrakis(3,5-di-tert-<br>
butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl-propenoate) (Irganox 1010®) and Tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)<br>
phosphite (Irgafos 168) in a 2/1 ratio (0.02-0.03% by weight), and it comprises the<br>
following stages:<br>
a)	Sequential dosing of PP, dry microparticles, PP-g-ITA or PP-g-MODIT<br>
compatibilizer of this invention, and antioxidant in a discontinuous mixer.<br>
b)	Mixing at 75-90 rpm of the mixture obtained in stage (a) at 190-195 °C during<br>
10-15 minutes in a stream of an inert gas such as nitrogen, for example.<br>
c)	Pressing at 4-6 MPa and 60-80 °C of the resultant mass from the mixer.<br><br>
d) Grinding the pressed material.<br>
Stage (a), dosing the components of the composite, comprises addding I) PP 40-<br>
90% by weight, ii) microparticles 10-60% by weight, iii) compatibllizer PP-g-ITA or PP-<br>
g-MODIT, that is PP grafted with ITA or MODIT, 0-13% by weight, and iv) antioxidant<br>
such as BHT or Pentaerythritol tetrakis(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl-propenoate)<br>
(Irganox 1010®) and Tris(2,4-dl-tert-butylphenyl) phosphite (Irgafos 168), for<br>
example, In a 2/1 ratio, 0.02-0.03% by weight. The function of the antioxidant is to<br>
prevent the degradation of the PP during the mixing process.<br>
Stage (b) is carried out in a discontinuous mixer. Mixing the components of the<br>
composite, PP, microparticles, compatibllizer and antioxidant has the purpose of<br>
getting the microparticles to be distributed homogeneously in the molten<br>
polypropylene matrix. Once all the components of the composite have been added,<br>
mixing is continued for 10-15 minutes under a stream of inert gas, for example<br>
nitrogen, whose function is to displace the oxidizing air environment in the chamber<br>
and prevent the degradation of the polypropylene.<br>
In stage (c) the resultant mass from stage (b) is pressed at 4-6 MPa and 60-80<br>
°C to obtain pressed plates 1-2 mm thick that will finally go to stage (d), which Is the<br>
grinding of the resultant plates.<br>
Stage (d), grinding of the plates, is carried out by cutting manually or<br>
mechanically rectangular pieces approximately 1-3 mm on each side.<br>
From this granular microcomposite the test specimens sized according to<br>
ASTM standards for determining its tensile properties (ASTM D 638) are obtained.<br>
The procedure described in this invention for obtaining the PP<br>
microcomposites reinforced with natural calcium carbonate microparticles also<br>
comprises the use of traditional reinforcements like calcium carbonate, talc and<br>
cellulose fibers such as sawdust. Natural calcium carbonate has been obtained<br>
according to the procedure described in patent application CL2542-2004 by the<br>
authors of this invention, and it allows microparticles of natural calcium carbonate to<br>
be obtained from egg shells recovered frrom farming and industrial wastes.<br><br>
At the same time, microcomposite without the PP-g-ITA or PP-g-MODIT<br>
compatibilizer of this invention was obtained for comparison purposes.<br>
Procedure 5<br>
Process for obtaining poiyolefin blends and PP-g-ITA or PP-g-MODIT compatibilizer<br>
of this invention.<br>
The procedure for obtaining poiyolefin blends using PP-g-ITA or PP-g-MODIT<br>
compatibilizer and nonfunctionalized and/or functionalized elastomer (EL) (elastomer<br>
grafted with ITA monomer, EL-g-ITA) comprises the following stages;<br>
a)	sequential dosing in a discontinuous mixer of:<br>
(i) poiyolefin such as PP ZN340;<br>
(ii) nonfunctionalized elastomers (EL) such as ethylene-1-octene (Engage or Eng)<br>

ethylene-co-1-hexene (PEC6) copolymer, or ethylene-co-1-octadecene (PEC18)<br>
copolymer, and/or functionalized elastomers such as elastomers grafted with ITA<br>
(EL-g-ITA), such as Eng-g-ITA or SEBS-g-ITA or PEC6-g-ITA or PEC18-g-ITA;<br>
(ill) PP-g-ITA or PP-g-MODIT compatibilizer of this invention; and<br>
(iv) antioxidant such as BHT or Pentaerythritol tetrakis(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-<br>

phosphite (Irgafos 168) in a 2/1 ratio.<br>
b)	Mixing at 75-90 rpm of the composition obtained in stage (a) at 190-195 °C<br>
during 10-15 minutes in a stream of an inert gas, such as nitrogen, for example.<br>
c)	Pressing at 4-6 MPa and 60-80 °C of the resultant mass from the mixing.<br>
d)	Grinding of the pressed material.<br>
Stage (a), dosing the components of the blend, includes adding:<br>
i) PP (70-90% by weight);<br>
ii) nonfunctionalized elastomer such as Eng or SEBS or PECe or PEC18<br>
and/or functionalized elastomer EL-g-ITA such as Eng-g-ITA or SEBS-g-<br>
ITA or PEC6-g-ITA or PEC18-g-ITA (1.0-30.0% by weight). The<br><br>
functionalized elastomer has the purpose of allowing greater<br>
homogenization of the different phases of the blend;<br>
iii) PP-g-ITA or PP-g-MODIT compatibilizer of this invention (1.0-15.0% by<br>
weight); and<br>
iv) antioxidant (0.2-0.3 % by weight). The function of the antioxidant is to<br>
prevent the degradation of the PP during the mixing process.<br>
Stage (b) is carried out in a discontinuous mixer. The mixing of the<br>
components of the blend: PP, antioxidant, PP-g-ITA or PP-g-MODIT compatibilizer of<br>
this invention, and unfuncionalized elastomer (EL) and/or functionalized elastomer EI-<br>
g-ITA has the purpose of getting the elastomer (disperse phase) to become<br>
distributed homogeneously in the molten PP matrix, and these functionalized<br>
elastomers are obtained by a procedure similar to the grafting of ITA on the polyolefm<br>
as described in procedure 1 "Obtaining the PP-g-ITA compatibilizer" of this invention.<br>
Once all the components of the blend have been added, mixing is continued during<br>
10-15 minutes under a stream of inert gas, for example nitrogen, whose function is to<br>
displace the oxidizing air environment from the chamber and prevent the degradation<br>
of the polypropylene.<br>
In stage (c) the resultant mass from stage (b) is pressed at 4-6 MPa and 60-<br>
80 °C to obtain pressed plates 2-4 mm thick and finally go to step (d), which is the<br>
grinding of the resultant plates.<br>
Stage (d), grinding of the plates, is carried out by cutting manually or<br>
mechanically into rectangular pieces approximately 1-3 mm on each side.<br>
From this granulated blend the test specimens sized according to ASTM<br>
standards for determining their tensile properties (ASTM D 638) are obtained.<br>
At the same time, blend without the PP-g-ITA or PP-g-MODIT compatibilizer of<br>
this invention and/or without functionalized elastomer was obtained for comparison<br>
purposes.<br><br>

Example 1<br>
Methodology for obtaining the polyolefin grafted with itaconic acid (PP-g-ITA)<br>
compatibilizer.<br>
The organic compound or compatibilizer obtained in this invention comprises<br>
the polyolefin grafted with ITA with a controlled degree of grafting by means of a<br>
procedure developed in this invention. The raw materials for obtaining the<br>
compatibilizer are: i) commercial PP homopolymer ZN250 from Petroquim S.A.; ii) ITA<br>
from Sigma USA; ill) dicumyl peroxide initiator from Akzo USA, and iv) Pentaerythritol<br>
tetrakis(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl-propenoate) (Irganox 1010®) and Tris(2,4-<br>
di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphite (Irgafos 168) antioxidants in a 2/1 ratio from Petroquim<br>
S.A.<br>
A description is given in this example of the stages for obtaining a<br>
compatibilizer with 1.8% of ITA grafting on PP ZN250 and a total mass of 35 grams,<br>
equivalent to the capacity of the discontinuous mixer used, and it comprises:<br>
a) dosing and mixing in a discontinuous mixer at 190 °C, 75 rpm, and during 10<br>
minutes under a stream of inert gas such as nitrogen of:<br><br>
i) PP ZN250 (33.77 grams; 96.48% by weight),<br>
ii) ITA (1.05 grams; 3.00% by weight),<br>
iii) dicumyl peroxide initiator (0.175 grams; 0.50% by weight), and<br>
iv) Pentaerythritol tetrakis(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl-propenoate)<br>
(Irganox 1010®) and Tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphite (Irgafos<br>
168) antioxidant in a 2/1 ratio (0.07 grams; 0.02% by weight),<br>
b)	pressing at 5 MPa and 70 °C of the resultant mass from the discontinuous<br>
mixer to obtain pressed plates 1-2 mm thick, and<br>
c)	grinding the pressed material (PP-g-ITA compatibilizer) into rectangular<br>
pieces approximately 1-3 mm on each side.<br>
Example la<br>
Determination of the degree of actual grafting of itaconic acid (ITA) in polypropylene<br>
(PP).<br>
The method for quantifying the percentage of actual grafting of ITA on PP for<br>
the PP-g-ITA compatibilizer consists in preparing physical mixtures, in the molten<br>
state, of PP and ITA in the Brabender Plasticorder model PL331 discontinuous mixing<br>
equipment. For that purpose three mixtures are made of PP ZN250 with ITA with<br>
compositions between 1.0% and 3.0% by weight of ITA (Table 1). These mixtures are<br>
processed in the discontinuous mixer during 6 min at 190 °C and 75 rpm in an inert<br>
atmosphere, for example nitrogen. The samples were then analyzed by Fourier<br>
transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The carbonyl index (CI) of all of them was<br>
determined. The CI was defined as the ratio of the sum of the intensities of the FTIR<br>
absorption bands centered at 1712 cm-1 and 1788 cm-1 corresponding to the<br>
carbonyl groups and succinic anhydride of the ITA molecule, and the intensity of the<br>
FTIR absorption band centered at 1167 cm'\ which corresponds to the absorption<br>
band of the CH3 groups of the PP used as reference<br>
  From the average value of the CI of each of the<br>
mixtures a calibration curve is obtained that relates that CI value with the percentage<br><br>
of ITA present in the mixture. With this curve it was possible to determine the<br>
percentage of actual grafting (GAI) of ITA on PP with different fluidity index (Fl).<br>
Equation 1, obtained from the linear relation of the calibration curve, allows the GAI to<br>
be determined.<br>
GAI (% by weight) = Ic / 0.3093	(Equation 1)<br>
In this way compatibilizers with 0.7, 1.0 and 1.8% of ITA graft or GAI value were<br>
obtained, that is, PP-g-ITAo.7, PP-g-ITA1.8 and PP-g-ITA1-8, respectively, in the<br>
polypropylene ZN250 matrix. The proportions of the components of each of these<br>
compatibilizers together with the molecular weight and polydispersity are summarized<br>
in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.<br>
The use of the compatibilizers to obtain nanocomposites, microcomposites<br>
and/or blends based on polyolefins is specific, and their mechanical and thermal<br>
properties are determined according to the degree of actual grafting of ITA on the<br>
polyolefin.<br>

Example 2<br>
Methodology for obtaining the compatibilizer of polyolefin grafted with MODIT (PP-g-<br>
MODIT).<br>
Similar to application example 1, in which stage a) ii) is modified by replacing<br>
the ITA monomer by MODIT, thus obtaining PP-g-MODIT compatibilizer with a<br>
variable degree of actual grafting between 0.5 and 1.4% by weight in the PP ZN250<br>
homopolymer.<br>
Example 2a<br>
Methodology for determining the degree of actual grafting of MODIT in the polyolefin.<br>
The determination of the degree of actual grafting of MODIT in the PP<br>
homopolymer is similar to that described for obtaining the degree of actual grafting of<br>
ITA in PP-g-ITA compatibilizer (Procedure 1a), replacing the ITA monomer by<br>
MODIT.<br>
The MODIT monomer was prepared from the reaction of itaconic anhydride<br>
(1.0 mol) and 1-octadecyl alcohol (1.2 mol) in toluene as solvent at the reflux<br>
temperature of the latter. Reaction time was 2.5 hours. At the end of the reaction the<br>
solvent was removed in a rotary evaporator and the crude product obtained was<br>
recrystailized in a 50/50 v/v toluene/petroleum ether mixture. The purified product<br>
melts at a temperature of 86-88 °C and its purity was verified by proton nuclear<br>
magnetic resonance spectrometry (1H NMR).<br>
The physical mixtures of PP ZN250 and MODIT made for the determination of<br>
the degree of actual grafting of MODIT on PP comprised a composition between<br><br>
0.5% and 5.0% by weight of MODIT (Table 3). These mixtures were processed in a<br>
manner similar to the procedure described for the PP-g-ITA compatlbilizer, in the<br>
discontinuous mixer during 6 min, 75 rpm and 190 °C in an Inert atmosphere of, for<br>
example, nitrogen. The samples were then analyzed by Fourier transform infrared<br>
spectroscopy (FTIR). In all of them the carbonyl index (CI) was determined. The CI is<br>
defined as the ratio of the sum of the intensities of the FTIR absorption bands<br>
centered at 1718 cm-1 1735 cm-1 and 1778 cm-1, corresponding to the representative<br>
groups of the MODIT molecule, and the intensity of the FTIR absorption band<br>
centered at 1164 cm-1 which corresponds to the absorption band of the CH3 groups<br>
of the PP used as reference. Table 4 shows the CI values for each of the mixtures<br>
prepared, the actual percentage of resultant MODIT grafting, and the code of each<br>
PP-g-MODITx compatlbilizer, where x represents the actual percentage of grafting,<br>
and following the same procedure as that used for the PP-g-ITA compatlbilizer.<br>
The use of the compatibllizers for obtaining the nanocomposites,<br>
microcomposites and/or blends based on polyolefins is specific, and its mechanical<br>
and thermal properties are determined according the degree of actual grafting of<br>
MODIT on the polyolefin.<br>

invention.<br>
The polyolefin and smectic type clay nanocomposite is comprised of the<br>
following raw materials: i) polyolefin; ii) clay modified or intercalated with ODA; ill) PP-<br>
g-ITA or PP-g-MODIT compatibilizer of this invention, and iv) antioxidants.<br>
(I) The polyolefins used were Ziegler-Natta polypropylene homopolymers from<br>
the Petroquim S.A. company, with fluidity indices (Fl) between 1.8 and 26.0 (ZN340<br>
and ZN150), as well as metallocene polypropylene homopolymers (Met 340 and Met<br>
190) with the properties indicated in Table 5.<br>
(ii) Clays of the smectic type such as montmorillonite (Mo) and natural (Hn)<br>
and synthetic (Hs) hectorite supplied by the Netherland Organisation for Applied<br>

butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl-propenoate) (Irganox 1010®) and Tris(2,4-di-tert-<br>
butylphenyl) phosphite (Irgafos 168) in a 2/1 ratio, from the Petroquim S.A.<br>
company.<br><br><br><br>
This example describes the stages for obtaining a nanocomposite of<br>
polypropylene ZN340 (96.0% by weight); Mo hybrid clay (1.0% by weight) and PP-g-<br>
AIT1-8 compatibilizer of this invention (3.0 % by weight), which comprises the following<br>
preparation stages:<br>
a)	Mo hybrid clay;<br>
b)	hybrid clay-compatibilizer masterbatch; and<br>
c)	hybrid clay-compatibilizer-PP nanocomposite.<br><br>
a)	The preparation of hybrid Mo is achieved by means of the intercalation of<br>
the amine ODA in Mo clay, that is, a cation exchange reaction of Mo clay with the<br>
amine ODA in an acid environment (pH 3.0). For that purpose an aqueous dispersion<br>
of Mo is prepared using 5.0 grams of Mo in 500 ml of distilled water, stimng during 30<br>
minutes. Separately, 1.6 g of ODA is dissolved in 500 ml of a 1/1 ethanol/water<br>
mixture at 70 °C, adjusting to pH = 3,0 with hydrochloric acid. Then the ODA solution<br>
is added to the aqueous dispersion of Mo, again adjusting the pH of this new resultant<br>
suspension at 3.0, and stirring is continued during 2.5 hours at 30 °C. It is then<br>
filtered, washed with a 1/1 ethanol/water mixture, the filtrate is dried at 60 °C for 12<br>
hours, and the resultant hybrid Mo is ground in a mechanical laboratory mill to<br>
Standard 325 mesh.<br>
b)	Preparation of the masterbatch, which comprises mixing i) 9.25 grams of the<br>
hybrid Mo obtained in stage (a); ii) 27.7 grams of PP-g-AIT1-8 compatibilizer of this<br>
invention (1/3 hybrid Mo/compatibilizer ratio); and iii) 0.02 grams of BHT antioxidant<br>
and 0.02 grams of Pentaerythritol tetrakis(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl-<br>
propenoate) (Irganox 1010®) and Tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphite (Irgafos 168)<br>
antioxidant in a 2/1 ratio. The masterbatch is thus obtained in a discontinuous mixer<br>
at 100 rpm, 190 °C and 10 minutes in a stream of an inert gas such as nitrogen.<br>
c)	Obtaining the nanocomposite: It comprises mixing: i) 1.48 grams of<br>
masterbatch prepared in the previous stage; ii) 35.6 grams of PP ZN340; and iii) 0.02<br>
grams of BHT and 0.02 grams of Pentaerythritol tetrakis(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-<br>
hydroxyphenyl-propenoate) (Irganox 1010®) and Tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)<br>
phosphite (Irgafos 168) in a 2/1 ratio as antioxidants. This mixing is carried out in a<br><br>
Brabender Plasticorder discontinuous mixer at 190 °C, 75 rpm, during 10 min under a<br>
stream of an inert gas such as nitrogen, whose function is to dilute the oxidizing air<br>
environment in the chamber to prevent the degradation of the polypropylene. The<br>
resultant mass from the discontinuous mixer is then pressed at 5 MPa and 80 °C,<br>
producing plates 1-2 mm thick which are finally ground into rectangular pieces<br>
approximately 1-3 mm on each side. From this ground nanocomposite the specimens<br>
for the tensile and thermal tests according to standards are obtained.<br>
The same procedure described in this example of applications is valid for<br>
obtaining nanocomposites using other smectic clays such as Hn and Hs of Table 6,<br>
different PPs such as ZN250 and ZN150 of Table 5, and PP-g-AITx Or PP-g-MODITx<br>
compatibilizers with different degrees of ITA or MODIT grafting on the PP. The<br>
nanocomposites obtained in this way will have a composition of 1, 3 and 5% by<br>
weight of hybrid Hn or Hs using a masterbatch with a hybrid clay/compatibilizer ratio<br>
of 1/3.<br>
Similarly, the description of this example of application is also valid to obtain<br>
nanocomposites, for comparison purposes, using the PP-g-AMA compatibilizer<br>
instead of PP-g-AITx or PP-g-MODIT x of this invention. The PP-g-AMA compatibilizer<br>
has 0.6% of maleic anhydride (MAA) grafted on the polyolefin. This is valid for all the<br>
smectic clays of Table 6, as well as the PPs cited in Table 5, and keeping the hybrid<br>
clay/PP-g-AMA weight ratio of 1/3 of the masterbatch, as well as the hybrid clay<br>
composition of 1.0 to 5.0% by weight.<br>
IVIechanical and thermal tests of the nanocomposites.<br>
The tests carried out to detemnine the mechanical and thermal properties of the<br>
nanocomposites of PP homopolymers and smectic hybrid clays were:<br>
• Thermal tests by thermogravimetric analysis that make it possible to obtain the<br>
thermal decomposition temperature measured as the temperature corresponding<br>
to a 50% weight loss, coded as T50" and referred to thermal stability.<br><br>
• Tensile tests according to ASTIVI D 638, to determine tensile mechanical<br>
properties like elastic modulus (E) in megapascals (MPa), and elastic limit (ay) in<br>
megapascals (MPa).<br>

ITA with different percentages of grafting as compatibilizer agent, and 1% of different<br>
hybrid clays. (T50 PP = 319 °C)<br><br>
According to the thermal tests of the nanocomposites it can be established that:<br>
• The nanocomposites obtained using the compatibilizer of this invention, PP-g-<br>
ITA with different degrees of ITA grafting on the PP (0.7, 1.0 and 1.8% by<br>
weight of ITA on PP), have a thermal stability (T50) greater than that of<br>
polypropylene alone. Furthermore, the thermal stability (T50) of the<br>
nanocomposite is a function of the degree of actual grafting of ITA in the PP-g-<br>
ITA compatibilizer used, and it is also specific according to the type of smectic<br>
clay used (Table 7).<br><br>

According to the mechanical tests of the nanocomposites based on polyolefins, hybrid<br>
clays, and compatibilizers of this invention or PP-g-AMA compatibilizer, it can be<br>
established that:<br>
•	Nanocomposites obtained using the PP-g-ITA compatibilizer of this<br>
invention have greater rigidity (E) (13.0 to 49.0%) and elastic limit (17.0 to<br>
22.0%) than those made using the PP-g-AMA compatibilizer. This is valid<br>
for the nanocomposites with 1.0% by weight of the hybrid clays and the<br>
PPs used in this invention.<br>
•	The rigidity (E) of the nanocomposites increases as the fluidity index of<br>
the PP used increases (6.0 to 15.0% increase) and also as the degree of<br>
actual grafting of MODIT in the PP-g-MODIT compatibilizer increases (5.0<br>
to 10.0% increase).<br><br>
•	The rigidity (E) and elastic limit of the nanocomposites based on<br>
polyolefins (ZN340 or ZN150), the PP-g-ITA compatibilizer of this<br>
invention, and clays (Mo or Hn) is a function of the degree of actual<br>
grafting of the ITA on the PP to obtain such nanocomposites.<br>
•	The rigidity (E) of the nanocomposites based on polyolefins (ZN340 or<br>
ZN150), PP-g-AITo.6 or PP-g-MODITo.5 compatibilizer of this invention,<br>
and Mo or Hn hybrid clays is greater (5.0 to 49.0% increase) than that<br><br>
corresponding to nanocomposites obtained using the PP-g-AMA<br>
compatibilizer with 0.6% actual grafting of AMA on the PP.<br>
• Nanocomposites that use compatibilizers of this invention can be applied<br>
in fields in which the rigidity requirements are more demanding than in<br>
the fields of application of the nanocomposites that use the PP-g-AMA<br>
compatibilizer.<br>

Methodology for obtaining microcomposites based on polyoleflns and PP-g-AITx or<br>
PP-g-MODITx compatibilizers of this invention.<br>
The microcomposites based on polypropylene (PP) with microparticles and the<br>
PP-g-AITx or PP-g-MODITx compatibilizer of this invention considered the use of the<br>
commercial Ziegler-Natta PPs of Table 5 and the microparticles shown in Table 10.<br><br>
This example describes the stages for obtaining a microcomposite of PP ZN250<br>
with 40% by weight of ES400 natural calcium carbonate microparticles (obtained<br>
according to procedure described in patent application CL2542-2004 by the authors<br>
of this invention), and PP-g-AIT0.7 compatibilizer of this invention, for a total mass of<br><br>
35 grams, equivalent to the capacity of the discontinuous mixer used, and it<br>
comprises:<br>
a)	Sequential dosing and mixing, in a discontinuous mixer at 190 °C during 10<br>
minutes and at 75 rpm under a stream of an inert gas such as nitrogen, of the<br>
components of the microcomposite:<br>
i) PP ZN250 (20.6 grams);<br>
ii) PP-g-AIT0.7 compatibilizer of this invention (0.35 grams);<br>
ill) Pentaerythritol	tetrakis(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl-propenoate)<br>
(Irganox 1010®) and Tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphite (Irgafos 168)<br>
antioxidant in 2/1 ratio (0.048 grams); and<br>
iv) Dry ES400 microparticles (14.0 grams).<br>
b)	pressing at a 5 MPa and 80 °C of the resultant mass from the mixing in the<br>
discontinuous mixer to obtain pressed plates 1-2 mm thick, and<br>
c)	grinding the resultant pressed material or microcomposite of polypropylene with<br>
40% by weight of ES400 microparticles into rectangular pieces approximately 1-3<br>
mm on each side.<br>
The same procedure is valid for microcomposites based on PP ZN340 and<br>
ZN250 with 40% by weight of microparticles of CC2 or TA2 or cellulose fibers such as<br>
sawdust and 1.0 to 9.0% by weight of PP-g-AIT0.6 or PP-g-MODIT0.5 compatiblizer of<br>
this invention.<br>
Similarly, for comparison purposes and with the same methodology, PP-<br>
microparticles microcomposites and without compatibilizer were obtained.<br>
Microcomposites of PP-microparticles that use compatibilizers such as PP-g-AMA0.6<br>
were also obtained to evaluate the comparative advantages of the PP-g-AIT0.6 or PP-<br>
g-MODIT0.5 compatibilizers of this invention on the mechanical properties of the<br>
microcomposite.<br>
The mechanical tests made with the microcomposites obtained were tensile tests<br>
according to ASTM D 638, to determine tensile mechanical properties such as elastic<br><br>
modulus (E) in megapascals (MPa), elastic limit (ay) in megapascals (MPa), and<br>
elongation at breakage in %.<br>
Table 11: Elastic modulus (E), elastic limit (ay) and elongation at breakage (6 ) of<br>
microcomposites obtained with PP ZN250 and microparticles (40% by weight) of talc<br>
(TA2) or calcium carbonate (ES400) and PP-g-AIT0.6 or PP-g-MODIT0.5 compatibilizer<br>
of this invention and PP-g-AMA0.6<br><br>
The mechanical properties of the microcomposites of polyolefins containing<br>
microparticles of natural calcium carbonate ES400 or talc TA2 and PP-g-AIT0.6 or PP-<br>
g-MODIT0.5 compatibilizer of this invention or PP-g-AMA show that:<br>
•	The rigidity (E) and elastic limit increase as the proportion of PP-g-AIT0.6<br>
or PP-g-MODIT0.5 compatibilizer of this invention (10.0 to 20.0%<br>
increase for E and 4.0 to 30.0 % increase for the elastic limit) or of PP-<br>
g-AMA0.6 compatibilizer increases (from 1.0 to 9.0% by weight) (5.0 to<br>
10.0 % increase of E and 4.0 to 25.0% increase of the elastic limit).<br>
•	The rigidity (E) and elastic limit of microcomposites that use the PP-g-<br>
AITo.e or PP-g-MODIT0.5 compatibilizer of this invention are greater than<br>
those of the similar microcomposite without compatibilizer (10.0 to<br>
20.0% increase of E and 4.0 to 30.0 % increase of the elastic limit).<br><br>
•	The rigidity (E) and elastic limit of the microcomposites that use the PP-<br>
g-AIT0.6 or PP-g-MODIT0.5 oompatibilizer of this invention increases in a<br>
higher proportion when the proportion of oompatibilizer increases from<br>
1.0 to 9.0 % by weight, compared with the increase of E and elastic limit<br>
of the microcomposites that use the PP-g-AMA0.6 oompatibilizer in the<br>
same composition range.<br>
•	The microcomposites obtained using the compatibilizers of this<br>
invention can be applied in fields in which the requirements of rigidity<br>
are similar or more demanding than in the fields of application of the<br>
microcomposites obtained using the PP-g-AMA compatibilizer.<br>

b) metallocenes: ethylene-co-1-hexene copolymer (PECe), ethylene-co-1-octadecene<br>
copolymer (PECia) (Table 12).<br>
Modified elastomers were also used as additional compatibilizers to achieve<br>
better homogenization of the phases in the polyolefin blend, and they comprise the<br>
grafting of ITA (0.7% degree of grafting) on the elastomer (EL-g-ITA) such as Eng-g-<br>
ITA or SEBS-g-ITA or PECe-g-ITA or PECia -g-ITA.<br>

butylphenyl) phosphite (Irgafos 168) in a 2/1 ratio, from the Petroquim S.A.<br>
company.<br><br><br>
This example describes the stages for the preparation of the blend based on PP<br>
ZN340, nonfunctionalized elastomer (30% by weight) and PP-g-AIT0.7 compatibilizer<br>
of this invention (10% by weight) for a total mass of 35 grams, equivalent to the<br>
capacity of the discontinuous mixer used, and it comprises:<br>

(Irgafos 168) in a 2/1 ratio (0.048 grams); and<br>
iv) Engage unfunctionalized elastomer (14.0 grams).<br>
b)	pressing at a 5 MPa and 80 °C of the resultant mass of the mixing in the<br>
discontinuous mixer to obtain pressed plates 1-2 mm thick, and<br>
c)	grinding the resultant pressed material or blend into rectangular pieces<br>
approximately 1-3 mm on each side.<br>

elastomer such as SEBS, PEC6, PEC18, and PP-g-AIT0.6 or PP-g-MODIT0.5<br><br>
compatibilizer of this invention. Blends were also obtained based on PP ZN340, PP-<br>
g-AIT0.6 or PP-g-MODIT0.5 compatibilizer of this invention, and with functionalized<br>
elastomers such as SEBS-g-ITA, PEC6-g-ITA and PEC18-g-ITA as additional<br>
compatibilizers.<br>
Furthennore, for the purpose of comparison, mixtures of PP-elastomer<br>
unfunctionalized and without compatibilizer were also obtained using the same<br>
methodology.<br>
The mechanical tests carried out with the reference mixtures and blends<br>
obtained, as detailed in Table 13, were:<br>
i) tensile tests according to ASTM D 638 to determine tensile mechanical<br>
properties such as Young's modulus (E) in megapascals (MPa), elastic<br>
limit (cry) in megapascals (MPa) and elongation at breakage in %, and<br>
ii) impact resistance (ASTM D 256) to determine impact resistance (J/m).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
According to the mechanical tests of the blends based on polyolefins and<br>
compatibilizers of this invention it can be established that there is:<br>
•	Increased rigidity (E) (5.0 to 20.0% increase) and elongation at<br>
breakage (10.0 to 90.0% increase) when using the PP-g-ITA or PP-g-<br>
MODIT compatibilizer of this invention for obtaining the PP-EL blend.<br>
•	Increased rigidity (E) (10.0 to 35.0 % increase), elastic limit (5.0 to 15.0<br>

the elastomers functionalized with the itaconic acid monomer are added<br>
as compatibilizers with respect to the PP-EL blend.<br>
•	Greater rigidity (E) of the PP-EL blend (25% increase) when an<br>
elastomer with a longer side chain is used, in increasing order for<br>
PP/PEC6
•	Increased impact resistance (10.0 to 80.0%) when adding the<br>
functionalized elastomers to the PP-EL blend.<br>
•	Greater impact resistance (10.0 to 50.0% increase) for PP-EL blends<br>
that contain PP-g-AITx polymers grafted with ITA of this invention than<br>
those PP-EL blends that do not contain it.<br>
•	The blends obtained using compatibilizers of this invention can be<br>
applied in fields in which the rigidity and elongation at breakage<br>
requirements are more demanding than in the fields of application of the<br>
blends without compatibilizer.<br><br>
