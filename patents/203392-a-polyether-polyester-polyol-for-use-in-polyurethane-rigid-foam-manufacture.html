COMPANY.<br><br><br>
PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION The following complete specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and<br><br>
the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
GRANTED<br>
20-6-2006<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to a polyether polyester polyol for use in polyurethane rigid foam manufacture.<br>
More particularly this invention relates to an ethylene oxide based polyether polyester polyol comprising 1-5 reactive ester groups, nominal functionality 3.1 - 5.5 and of molecular weight 400 - 1000 g/mole, with metal content 
This invention also relates to a process for the production of the ethylene oxide based polyether polyester polyol.<br>
The polyurethane rigid foam products manufactured using the ethylene oxide based polyether polyester polyol of the invention as a base polyol, find application as thermal insulators.<br>
PRIOR ART;<br>
Non-esterified alkoxylated polyols are reported to be used as base polyols in the manufacture of polyurethane rigid foam. The non-esterified alkoxylated polyols may be prepared from polyols such as water soluble sugars or sugar alcohols like sorbitol or aliphatic amines like ethylene<br>
2<br><br>
diamine and an alkylene oxide such as ethylene or propylene oxide (US) Patents Nos 4239907 and553334 and PCT Publication Nos WO 96/12759 and WO 98/55523). The non-esterified alkoxylated polyols prepared from ethylene oxide being polar, C4 . 6 straight chain or cyclic hydrocarbon blowing agents which axe used in the manufacture of polyurethane rigid foam show poor solubility [ 4.2). Processing of such highly viscous alkoxylated polyols to manufacture polyurethane rigid foam products is difficult under ordinary conditions and requires use of high pressure equipments. Besides, large quantities of blowing agents will be consumed during polyurethane rigid foam manufacture. Propylene oxide is expensive and less active than ethylene oxide. The process for preparing propylene oxide based polyols is thus expensive and time consuming.<br>
Esterified alkoxylated polyols are reported to be prepared by alkoxylation of a polyol like sucrose with alkylene oxide such as ethylene oxide in the presence of water and a base catalyst like sodium hydroxide. The resulting alkoxylate is transesterified with an ester like methyl laurate (Japanese Patent No 7762216). The esterifed alkoxylated polyol is reported to comprise 1-3 ester groups per molecule which may or may not be reactive and has nominal functionality upto 2.98. The esterified alkoxylated<br>
3<br><br>
polyols are reported to be used as non-ionic surfactant. The above alkoxylation employs large amount (~9%) of water because of which the nominal functionality of the esteiified product is reduced to below 3. This renders the esteiified alkoxykated polyol unsuitable as a base polyol for making dimensionally stable polyurethane rigid foam. The esteiified product is also reported to have high (&gt; 500 ppm) metal content. If high metal containing esteiified alkoxylated polyol is processed as base polyol for polyurethane manufacture, by-products are likely to result which affects the quality/properties of the polyurethane rigid foam. The purity of the esteiified alkoxylated polyol as prepared by the above process is reported to be low (95%).<br>
Esteiified alkoxylated polyols prepared by esterification of an alkoxylated polyol such as ethoxylate or propoxylate of sugar or sugar alcohol like sucrose with C2-24fatty aids like oleic acid are described in European Patent No 415635A1. These esterified alkoxylated polyols comprise 6-8 ester groups per molecule which may or may not be reactive and are reported to be used as fat substitutes. Presence of 6 - 8 ester groups per molecule will increase the molecular weight of the esterified alkoxylated polyol which renders them unsuitable for use as base polyol in polyurethane rigid foam manufacture. The process for the preparation of the esterified alkoxylated polyol employs inert solvents like methylene chloride or methanol which are hazardous and expensive. The esterification process itself as reported in the above process takes about   32 hours.     The process for   the preparation of   the   esterified<br>
4<br><br>
alkoxylated polyols is thus unsafe, expensive and time consuming. A low-yield of 86% of the product is reported when prepared by the above route.<br>
It has been found out by experimentation that an esterified alkoxylated polyol comprising reactive ester groups, hence hereinafter referred to as polyether polyester polyol (PEPEP), based on ethylene oxide and of the characteristics as defined in the invention finds application in the manufacture of polyurethane rigid foam products as base polyol with distinct advantages.<br>

According to the invention, by controlling the mole ratio of ethylene oxide to the amino or hydroxy compound during ethoxylation as stated in the invention, an ethoxyiate which has a molecular weight of 340 - 65g/mole is obtained. Reaction of such an ethoxyiate with fatty acid ester which comprises atleast one reactive hydrogen and 1-5 reactive ester groups per molecule results in a PEPEP comprising 1-5 reactive ester groups with molecular weight of 400 - 1000 g/mole. Water not being used for the reaction, the nominal functionality of the PEPEP of the invention is achieved between 3.1 - 5.5. Filtration of the PEPEP through a filter bed of metal oxide or silicate ensures low metal content in the PEPEP. Use of ethylene oxide in the preparation of PEPEP of the invention renders the PEPEP less viscous which can be easily processed further for the manufacture of polyurethane rigid foam without using high pressure equipments. Further blowing agents are consumed in the quantities during the manufacture of polyurethane rigid foam Ethylene oxide is also less expensive and more reactive than other alkylene oxides. Therefore the ethylene oxide based PEPEP of the invention is rendered less expensive. The process of the invention for the preparation of the ethylene oxide based PEPEP is less time consuming. It does not use any solvent and is safe and economical. PEPEP produced by the process of the invention is obtained in high yield (~99.5%) and purity (99.5 - 99.9%). Therefore the use of the ethylene oxide based PEPEP prepared by the process of the invention, in the manufacture of polyurethane rigid foam renders the polyurethane rigid foam products less expensive. Due to capping of the ethoxyiate with C2.24 fatty acid ester, hydrocarbon/halogenating blowing     agent show high<br>
13<br><br>
solubility in the ethoxylated PEPEP of the invention than in non-esterified ethoxylated polyol. Low metal content in the ethylene oxide based PEPEP of the invention eliminates formation of by-products in the manufacture of polyurethane rigid foam. The polyurethane rigid foam products to be used as thermal insulators prepared from the PEPEP of the invention are of good quality and show dimesional stability with low thermal conductivity.<br>

of cyclopentane. 162 g of the blend was mixed with 192 g of polymethylene polyphenylene polyisocyanate (Suprasec 5005) at 22°C for 6 secs. The resulting polyurethane rigid foam was moulded using a mild steel carton box of dimensions 45 x 25 x 9 cms.<br>
The properties of a sample of each of the polyurethane rigid foam products of Examples 7 to 10 of dimensions 100 x 100 x 30 mm were studied and the results were as follows in Table 1<br><br>

The polyurethane rigid loam products of Examples 7 to 10 prepared using the less expensive PEPEP of the invention as base polyol have proved to be less expensive. Since the ethylene oxide based PEPEP of the invention is less viscous, its further processibility while blending with other agents viz polymers, surfactants or catalysts was found to be easy and did not require the use of high pressure equipments. Blowing agents were consumed in less quantities during the manufacture of polyurethane products. In the ethylene oxide based PEPEP of the invention, hydrocarbon/halogenating blowing agents like cyclopentane or chlorofluorocarbon were found to be highly soluble while manufacturing the polyurethane rigid foam products. The polyurethane rigid foam products of Examples 7 to 10 prepared using the ethylene oxide based PEPEP of the invention as base polyol were found to be dimensionally stable with low thermal conductivity with other properties comparable to the standard polyurethane rigid foam products commercially available.<br>
