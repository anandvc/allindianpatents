				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a device for reducing vibrational forces set up by the crankshaft of an engine, either an automobile engine or a static engine.<br>
Conventionally, devices for reducing vibrational forces in both antomobile and static engines are known to the art.<br>
However in   the  device  proposed  herein   two   aspects  of vibrational forces are addressed.<br>
The first kind of force causes torsional or linear vibration in crankshafts, the symptoms of which are power steering pressure pulses, alternator current fluctuations and Water pump output fluctuations to name but a few. Such vibrational forces result in the degradation of the life of the components.<br>
Conventionally, torsional or linear vibration is controlled by means of using a damper. A crankshaft will twist back and forth at a high frequency while rotating. This twisting can be reduced by using a crankshaft damper.<br>
The second kind of force causes rigid body mode vibration on front engine accessories. Devices for isolating FEAD (front engine accessories devices) from excessive speed variation and for reducing the dynamic load on the FEAD are also known to the art. Such devices are called isolators.<br><br>
Known devices such an the damper cannot perform the function of an isolator; nor can the known devices such as the isolator perform the function of a damper for the reason that their respective constructions do not allow of performance of these functions.<br>
It is an object of this invention, therefore, to propose a device for reducing vibrational forces set up by the crankshaft of an engine which can perform the function of a damper as well as that of an isolator.<br>
The device, according to this invention, for reducing vibrational forces set up by the crankshaft of an engine, comprises a hub for mounting the said crankshaft and a pulley provided with a belt drive characterised in that an inertia member is tightly mounted on the hub, by means of a first elastic member<br><br>
circumferentially sandwiched between the inertia member and the hub; the pulley is tightly mounted on the hub by means of a second elastic member circumferentially sandwiched between die pulley and the hub.<br>
The device proposed herein will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example, and not by way of limitation, one of various possible embodiments of this invention.<br><br>
Fig. illustrating a sectional assembled view of the embodiment<br>
And<br>
Fig.2 illustrating an exploded view of the said embodiment.<br>
The embodiment illustrated will be seen to consist of a hub H provided for mounting the crankshaft (not illustrated for the sake of clarity) of the engine. A pulley P is provided with a Vee belt drive, the grooves for seating the belts being indicated by 0. The belt drive is intended for taking off power from the crankshaft.<br>
The characteristic features of this invention, are :<br>
An mertia member J is tightly mounted on the hub H, by means of a first elastic member El circumferentially. sandwiched between the inertia member J and the hub H, whereby any torsional or linear vibrational forces set up by the rotating crankshaft are reduced or damped by the flexible joint between the inertia member J and the hub H. The damping action, in effect, reduces vibration by modifying the mass elastic system of the crankshaft. It nay be noted that the inertia member J is not directly coupled to the pulley P, there being a gap F between the said member J and the pulley.<br><br>
The pulley P is tightly mounted on the hub J by means of a second elastic member E2 circumferentially sandwiched between the said pulley and the hub H whereby the pulley is isolated from the negative effects of rigid body mode vibration, that is to say, reduces the transmission of vibration forces set up by the crankshaft to another part of the vehicle where the vibration will be felt or heard by the driver or passenger. It may be noted that the inertia wheel J is directly coupled to the pulley P through the second elastic member E2. A bearing B is located between the pulley P and the hub H.<br><br>
The torsional or linear vibration of the engine as well as the negative effects of rigid body mode vibration on front engine<br><br>
accessories are thus reduced by the damping and isolating action of the device proposed herein<br>
The terms and expressions herein are of description and not of limitation, masmnch as various other embodiments of the said device are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	A device for reducing vibrational forces set up by the<br>
crankshaft of an engine, comprising a hub for mounting the<br>
said crankshaft and a pulley provided with a belt drive<br>
characterised m that an inertia member is tightly mounted on<br>
the hub. by means of a first elastic member<br>
circumferentially sandwiched between the inertia member<br>
and the hub; the pulley is tightly mounted on the hub by<br>
means of a second elastic member circumferentially<br>
sandwiched between the pulley and the hub.<br>
2.	A device as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the engine is an<br>
automobile engine.<br>
3.	A device as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the engine is a<br>
static engine.<br>
4.	A device for reducing vibrational forces set up by the<br>
crankshaft of an engine substantially as herein described<br>
with reference to, and as illustrated in, the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br><br></td>
