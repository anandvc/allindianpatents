		The invention relates to an apparatus and a method<br>
	for the anaerobic fermentation of materials.<br>
		An apparatus and a method according to the preamble<br>
10 	of claim 1 and of claim 8 is known from the DE 198 04<br>
	007. This document relates to the treatment of an organi-<br>
	cally burdened fluid whereat the gas is generated in the<br>
	fermentation stage. In practice it has turned out that<br>
	the average duration of stay of the burdened fluids in<br>
15 	the pre-acidification stage is approximately 15 hours and<br>
	a total process approximately 30 hours. In this time the<br>
	process water is sufficiently preâ€”acidified so that it<br>
	can be transported into the fermenter without involving<br>
	the risk that there would occur yet another acidification<br>
20 	in the fermenter which would be very disadvantageous for<br>
	the fermentation process particularly by damaging the<br>
	methane producing bacteria due to low pH-values. Usually<br>
	in the pre-acidification a pH-value of 6.0 or below must<br>
	be reached. The pre-acidification serves to solubilize<br>
25 complex carbon compounds since the fermentation bacteria<br>
	can utilize simple carbon compounds only.<br>
		During the fermentation biogas is extracted which<br>
	represents a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide and<br>
	which can be Used for generating energy.<br>
30 		Further, from practice solid reactors are known in<br>
	which pre-acidification and fermentation for the extrac-<br>
	tion of biogas take place jointly. In such reactors solid<br>
	to pasty materials can be treated, whose time of stay 16<br>
	weeks until a sufficient total process has taken place. <br><br><br>
- 2 -<br>
		At breweries fluid burdened process waters for exam-<br>
	ple from cleaning processes for example and as more solid<br>
	organic materials yeasts and draff, i.e. brewer grain for<br>
	example arise. At fruit juice extraction plants also<br>
5 press residues like solid peel particles arise besides<br>
	the process water. At such or similar production sites at<br>
	which organically burdened fluids as well as organic re-<br>
	mains arise normally both i.e. two independent reactors<br>
	are therefore required primarily due to the incompatible<br>
10	pre-acidification periods in order to utilize the materi-<br>
	als for biogas production. This is however quite costly<br>
	and complicated.<br>
	The DE 199 37 876 Al discloses a method for the bio-<br>
	logical conversion of organic materials to methane gas,<br>
15 	Which method is to achieve a power enhancement by shift-<br>
	ing the stable operating point of the system, For that<br>
	purpose the residence time of organic components in the<br>
	reactors is to be uncoupled from the hydraulic residence<br>
	time by the retention of organic components by means of a<br>
20 semipermeable membrane in order to achieve a better adap-<br>
	tation of the bacteria growth.<br>
		The object of the present invention is therefore to<br>
	create an apparatus and a method with which a more cost<br>
	effective simpler alternative for the production of bio-<br>
25 	gas from fluid and soild materials can be realized.<br>
		This objective is achieved by an apparatus with the<br>
	characteristics of claim 1 and a method with the charac-<br>
	teristics of claim 8.<br>
		Preferred embodiments are disclosed in the respec-<br>
30 	tive sum claims.<br>
		With the apparatus according to the present inven-<br>
	tion means for transporting materials into the fermenter<br>
	are provided with which it is possible by selective pro-<br>
5<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
	cess control, to transport all materials in a sufficiently<br>
	pre-acidified condition. Here, still insufficiently pre-<br>
	acidified normally more solid sparsely solubilized mate-<br>
	rials are left in the pre-acidifier for sufficient pre-<br>
5 	acidification.<br>
		Accordingly the method according to the present in-<br>
	vention relates to such one at which only sufficiently<br>
	pre-acidified materials are transported.<br>
		In this way it is possible to put fluid respectively<br>
10 	largely solubilized materials as well as solid or pasty<br>
	less solubilized ones into a pre-acidifier and sibse-<br>
	quently feed them sufficiently pre-acidified to a common<br>
	fermenter.<br>
		For the selective transport a variety of material<br>
15 	characteristics can be utilized which distinguish the<br>
	sufficiently pre-acidified materials from the still in-<br>
	sufficiently pre-acidified materials.<br>
		While for example sufficiently pre-acidified solid<br>
	or pasty materials are soaked by the pre-acidification<br>
20 	solubilization and dissolve in the fluid the insuffi-<br>
	ciently pre-acidified solid are normally coarse grained<br>
	and sedimenting, respectively. Thus, a selection can be<br>
	done by sieving and treating for example whereat the<br>
	sieve for example has to be designed so that the still<br>
25 	insufficiently pre-acidified solids get caught in the<br>
	sieve and the fluid and soaked materials can pass through<br>
	the sieve.<br>
		Furthermore, it has turned out that the still insuf-<br>
	ficiently pre-acidified solids in the pre-acidifier de-<br>
30 	posit themselves on the bottom of the same if no agita-<br>
	tion or stirring take place in the pre-acidifier. This<br>
	means that upon switch-off of the agitation or of the<br>
	stirring normally taking place in the pre-acidifier the<br>
	insufficiently pre-acidified materials gather in the low-<br><br><br>
-4-<br>
10<br>
	er portion, whereas the sufficiently pre-acidified mate-<br>
	rials gather in the upper portion whereby a selection of<br>
	sufficiently pre-acidified materials by a withdrawal of<br>
	materials in the upper portion of the pre-acidifier is<br>
5 	rendered possible by carrying out the forwarding into the<br>
	fermenter only during the "rest phases".<br>
		It has furthermore turned out that by a flotation<br>
	for example by blowing air or gas into the pre-acidifier<br>
	from the bottom the solid preferably bloat on the sur-<br>
10 	face so that also here a separation of still insuffi-<br>
	ciently pre-acidified materials from the sufficiently<br>
	pre-acidified materials results so that a selection dur-<br>
	ing transport by a withdrawal of materials from the lower<br>
	portion of the pre-acidifier is possible.<br>
15 		A preferred embodiment with very coarse feedstock<br>
	materials such as peels, grains or the like includes a<br>
	pre-treatment preferably a mechanical pre-comminution of<br>
	the solids with a chopper or a mill or the like. A pre-<br>
	treatment particularly a mechanical pre-comminution fa-<br>
20 	cilitates the solubilization of the solid materials in<br>
	the pre-acidifier.<br>
		Preferred embodiments of the apparatus according to<br>
	the present invention and the method according to the<br>
	present invention are explained on the basis of the ac-<br>
25 	companying figures, in which:<br>
		Figure 1 shows a three-dimensional perspective view<br>
	of an apparatus according to the invention,<br>
		Figure 2 shows a schematic sectional view of the ap-<br>
	paratus according to the invention,<br>
30 		Figure 3 shows a schematic sectional view of another<br>
	embodiment according to the invention, and<br>
		Figure 4 shows a sectional view of a further embodi-<br>
	ment of the invention.<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
		In figure 1 an apparatus for the pre-acidification<br>
	and anaerobic fermentation of materials is shown in a<br>
	schematic three-dimensional illustration. The apparatus<br>
	comprises a pre-acidifier 2, a fermenter with a main load<br>
5 	stage 3a and a light load stage 3b and a final sedimenta-<br>
	tion stage 4. For the performance of the anaerobic fer-<br>
	mentation main load stage 3a and light load stage 3b are<br>
	covered by a tarpaulin for example for collecting and<br>
	storing the arising gases, which is not illustrated in<br>
10 figure 1 for the sake of clarity. This tarpaulin can ad-<br>
	ditionally cover pre-acidification 2 for example when the<br>
	flotation occurs by means of gas or gas circulation(not<br>
	illustrated).<br>
		Between pre-acidifier 2 and main load stage 3a a di-<br>
15 	vider 17, between main load stage 3a and light load stage<br>
	3b a double divider 18 as well as between light load<br>
	stage 3b and final sedimentation stage 4 a divider 19 are<br>
	put in which can be adjustable or fixed.<br>
		In the portion of pre-acidifier 2 stirrers 6, 7 can<br>
20 	be arranged with which an agitation can be carried out in<br>
	the portion of pre-acidifier 2. Stirrers 6, 7 can be<br>
	driven by a control device 14 via signal or power supply<br>
	lines 15 . Via a signal or power line 16 control device 14<br>
	can also be connected to a pump 5c with which a transport<br>
25 	from pre-acidifier 2 into main load stage 3a via<br>
	pipelines 5a and 5b can take place. At this the end of a<br>
	nozzle and of a pipeline 5b are arranged in the portion<br>
	of pre-acidifier 2 in the upper portion of pre-acidifier<br>
	2 i.e. for example above the middle along the height of<br>
30 	pre-acidifier 2. Main, load stage 3a as well as light load<br>
	stage 3b can comprise partition walls not further illus-<br>
	trated. Double divider 18 between main load stage 3a and<br>
	light load stage 3b as well as divider 19 between light<br>
	load stage 3b and final sedimentation stage 4 may com-<br><br><br>
 15 							- 6 -<br>
	praise transfer points 20 or overflow spillways with which<br>
	materials from the respective stage can pass over into<br>
	the subsequent stage.<br>
		The basin illustrated in figure 1 can be embedded<br>
5 	into the ground which however is not illustrated in fig-<br>
	ure 1 for reason of clarity.<br>
		While in figure 1 pre-acidifier 2, fermenter 3a, 3b<br>
	as well as final sedimentation stage 4 are accommodated<br>
	in a basin they can also be arranged individually in a<br>
10 	basin or tank.<br>
		In figure 2 there is a schematic sectional view of<br>
	the apparatus of figure 1, in which tarpaulin 13 is il-<br>
	lustrated which covers the main load stage and the light <br>
	load stage. Under tarpaulin 13 the biogas produced<br>
15	gather so that the tarpaulin bulges as illustrated in<br>
	figure 2.<br>
		Furthermore in figure 2 the induction of the materi-<br>
	als A and B via feed mechanisms 8 and 9 and for B alter-<br>
	natively via a pre-treatment 25, respectively, is<br>
20 	schematically illustrated. While the fluid material A is<br>
	normally fed through a pipeline the solid material B can<br>
	be fed via a conveyor belt or via containers or the like.<br>
	If the solid material B is available in a pasty or bloat-<br>
	ed form it can also be fed via a pipeline 9. In figure 2<br>
25 	a possible pre-treatment 25 of the solid materials B is<br>
	also specified.<br>
		In figure 3 another embodiment of apparatus 1 is<br>
	schematically illustrated. Here a sieve 12 is arranged at<br>
	the entry of a pipeline 5b which serves for transporting<br>
30 	from pre-acidifier 2 into main load stage 3a. While sieve<br>
	12 is arranged here in an approximately middle position<br>
	with respect to the vertical height of pre-acidifier 2,<br>
	it can also be arranged further up or further down. Sieve<br><br><br>
- 7 -<br>
	12 is required to have a mesh aperture or transfer port<br>
	opening size such that solids B which are fed into the<br>
	pre-acidifier cannot pass through as long as they are in-<br>
	sufficiently pre-acidified.<br>
5 		Instead of a pipeline 5b and a sieve 12 as transport<br>
	means a sieve or a rack in a spillway or just a spillway<br>
	with a automatically lockable value can also be arranged<br>
	through which materials from pre-acidifier 2 flow over<br>
	into main load stage 3a. Such a spillway can be arranged<br>
10 	at the upper end of divider 17 for example and can proba-<br>
	bly be lockable. The described spillways can also be ar-<br>
	ranged in the middle or lower part of divider 17.<br>
		Instead of a sieve 12 any other suitable device for<br>
	separating coarse structured materials from soft or fluid<br>
15	materials as for example an intermediate sedimentation<br>
	stage can also be provided. From such an intermediate<br>
	sedimentation stage the solid materials would be trans-<br>
	ported back into pre-acidifier 2 so that they undergo a<br>
	further pre-acidification.<br>
20 		Figure 4 shows a further embodiment of the inven-<br>
	tion. At this a pipe 5e is provided as transport means,<br>
	whose entry nozzle end is located in the lower portion of<br>
	pre-acidifier 2. Furthermore a flotation device 10, 11 is<br>
25	provided with which air or gas which is fed through a<br>
	acidifier 2.<br>
		A pump 5d is connected via a signal, a compressed-<br>
	air, a hydraulic or a power line to a control device 14<br>
	which can drive pump 5d or an automatic value (not illus-<br>
30 	trated). Furthermore, control device 14 is connected to<br>
	an optional stirrer 6, 7 and/or to flotation device 10,<br>
	11, 21 via one or more signal, compressed-air, hydraulic<br>
	or power lines and can drive these.<br>
20<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
		A first embodiment of a method according to the in-<br>
	vention shall be explained on the basis of figures 1 and<br>
	2.<br>
		Via pipelines 8 a brewery waste water (process wa-<br>
5 	ter) for example is fed into the portion of pre-acidifier<br>
	2. The draff, yeasts and filtered out remains furthermore<br>
	arising at the brewery can be fed into the portion of<br>
	pre-acidifier 2 unprocessed, completely or partially pre-<br>
	treated via suitable transport means such as pipelines or<br>
10 	conveyor belts or the like as solids B.<br>
		In this portion a fermentation by acidogeneous bac-<br>
	teria into mainly organic acids, hydrogen carbon dioxide<br>
	as well as low alcohols occurs. At this a pH-value of ap-<br>
	proximately 6 and below or 5.5 and below is achieved.<br>
15 		To support the thorough mixing one or more stirrers<br>
	6, 7 for example are employed in the portion of pre-acid-<br>
	ification 2.<br>
	The materials A and B are put into the portion of<br>
		pre-acidifier 2 continuously or intermittently.<br>
20 		From pre-acidifier 2 a transport of materials into<br>
	main load stage 3a must occur continuously or in inter-<br>
	vals, For this, stirrers 6 and 7 or other agitation de-<br>
	vices for example are switched off by means of control<br>
	device 14. After a while (some minutes up to several ten<br>
25 	minutes) the solids which are normally still insuffi-<br>
	ciently pre-acidified deposit themselves in the lower<br>
	portion of pre-acidifier 2. In the upper portion of the<br>
	reactor the sufficiently pre-acidified fluid materials as<br>
	well as the soaked and therefore sufficiently pre-acidi-<br>
30 	fied solids gather. After the deposition in the portion<br>
	of pre-acidifier 2 which is caused by a switched-off for<br>
	example of stirrers 6,7 a pump 5c is switched on via<br>
	control device 14 which transports materials via<br><br><br>
- 9 -<br>
25<br>
	pipelines 5a and 5b from the upper portion, of pre-acidi-<br>
	fier 2 into main load stage 3a or control device 14 opens<br>
	the alternatively installed valve.<br>
		In main load stage 3a and in light load stage 3b the<br>
5 	pre-acidified materials ferment and methanate,<br>
	respectively, under the formation of biogas and the mate-<br>
	rials leaving light load stage 3b are final-treated in<br>
	final sedimentation stage 4. The final-treated materials<br>
	can be re-transported to the process, for example into<br>
10 	the light load stage 3b, by means of pump 22 and pipeline<br>
	23 	or taken out in a controlled way as surplus sludge by<br>
	means of value 24.<br>
		The draff and the filtered-out remains can be me-<br>
	chanically pre-hackled or purified otherwise so that for<br>
15 	example a present grain size of solid material results.<br>
	This is advantageous to the controlled process control as<br>
	well as to the accelerated pre-acidification of the<br>
	solids.<br>
		On the basis of figure 3 a further embodiment of the<br>
20 	method shall be explained. The addition of materials A, B<br>
	to pre-acidifier 2 as well as the fermentation and final<br>
	sedimentation is the same as the procedure described with<br>
	reference to figures 1 and 2.<br>
		In this method materials are transported continuous-<br>
25 	ly or in intervals from pre-acidifier 2 into main load<br>
	stage 3a with a pipeline 5b and a pump, not illustrated,<br>
	through a sieve 12. Sieve 12 retains the still insuffi-<br>
	ciently pre-acidified solids and lets the sufficiently<br>
	pre-acidified fluid and soaked materials pass through.<br>
30 	At this the withdrawal from pre-acidifier 2 can be<br>
	carried out in a middle position, as illustrated in fig-<br>
	ure 3, or further up or further down.<br>
		Furtheron, means for keeping sieve 12 free such as<br>
	slides can be provided which remove in suitable intervals<br><br><br>
- 10 -<br>
	material accumulating on sieve 12. For that purpose a de-<br>
	vice can also be provided which creates a cross current<br>
	in sieve 12 in order to remove remove accumulating meterial from<br>
	sieve 12 in this way.<br>
5 		The agitation device, here stirrers 6, 7 may be<br>
	switched on or switched off during the transport.<br>
		Using figure 4 a further embodiment of a method<br>
	shall be explained.<br>
		Here the feed at the materials A, B and the fermen-<br>
10 	tation and final sedimentation, respectively, are the<br>
	same as described with reference to figures 1 and 2.<br>
		For the transport of materials from pre-acidifier 2<br>
	into main load stage 3a a pump 21 for example with which<br>
	air or gas is pumped through a pipeline 10 into the lower<br>
15 	portion of the pre-acidifier is driven by control device<br>
	14. There the air or the gas exits through outlets 11 so<br>
	that a flotation in pre-acidifier 2 occurs. At this junc-<br>
	true the insufficiently pre-acidified solids are bloated<br>
	upwards. Meanwhile with control device 14 a pump 5d is<br>
20 	put in operation which transports materials via pipelines<br>
	se from pre-acidifier 2 into main load stage 3a. Here the<br>
	entry of the nozzle to pump 5d lies in the lower portion<br>
	of pre-acidifier 2, because here no insufficiently pre-<br>
	acidified solids are present during the flotation. The<br>
25 nozzle can however also lie in the middle or upper por-<br>
	tion when floating is not performed but sedimenting.<br>
		An optionally provided stirrer 6, 7 is preferably<br>
	switched off during transporting.<br>
		With the method described above it is possible for<br>
30 	example to set the mean duration of stay of fluid materi-<br>
