COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING FLUOROOLEFINS AND USES<br>
THEREOF<br>
CROSS REFERENCE(S) TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)<br>
This application claims the priority benefit of U.S. Provisional Application 60/732,581, filed November 1, 2005 and of U.S. Patent Application 11/486,791, filed July 13, 2006.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to compositions for use in refrigeration, air-conditioning or heat pump systems wherein the composition comprises at least one fluoroolefin. The compositions of the present invention are useful in processes for producing refrigeration or heat, as heat transfer fluids and many other uses.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The refrigeration industry has been working for the past few decades to find replacement refrigerants for the ozone depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) being phased out as a result of the Montreal Protocol. The solution for most refrigerant producers has been the commercialization of hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants. The new HFC refrigerants, HFC-134a being the most widely used at this time, have zero ozone depletion potential and thus are not affected by the current regulatory phase out as a result of the Montreal Protocol.<br>
Further environmental regulations may ultimately cause global phase out of certain HFC refrigerants. Currently, the automobile industry is facing regulations relating to global warming potential for refrigerants used in mobile air-conditioning.   Therefore, there is a great current need to identify new refrigerants with reduced global warming potential for the mobile air-conditioning market. Should the regulations be more broadly applied in the future, an even greater need will be felt for refrigerants that can be used in all areas of the refrigeration and air-conditioning industry.<br>
Currently proposed replacement refrigerants for HFC-134a include HFC-152a, pure hydrocarbons such as butane or propane, or<br>
"natural" refrigerants such as CO2. Many of these suggested replacements are toxic, flammable, and/or have low energy efficiency. Therefore, new alternative refrigerants are being sought.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide novel refrigerant compositions and heat transfer fluid compositions that provide unique characteristics to meet the demands of low or zero ozone depletion potential and lower global warming potential as compared to current refrigerants.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to compositions comprising at least one fluoroolefin. By fluoroolefin is meant any compound containing carbon, fluorine and optionally, hydrogen or oxygen that also contains at least one double bond. These fluoroolefins may be linear, branched or cyclic.<br>
These compositions have a variety of utilities in working fluids, which include use as foaming agents, blowing agents, fire extinguishing agents, heat transfer mediums (such as heat transfer fluids and refrigerants for use in refrigeration systems, refrigerators, air-conditioning systems, heat pumps, chillers, and the like), to name a few.<br>
A heat transfer fluid (also referred to herein as a heat transfer composition or heat transfer fluid composition) is a working fluid used to carry heat from a heat source to a heat sink.<br>
A refrigerant is a compound or mixture of compounds that function as a heat transfer fluid in a cycle wherein the fluid undergoes a phase change from a liquid to a gas and back.<br>
The present invention provides fluoroolefins having the formula E- orZ-R1CH=CHR2 (Formula I), wherein R1 and R2 are, independently,C1toC6  perfluoroalkyi groups. Examples of R1 and R2 groups include, but are not limited to, CF3, C2F5, CF2CF2CF3, CF(CF3)2, CF2CF2CF2CF3, CF(CF3)CF2CF3, CF2CF(CF3)2, C(CF3)3, CF2CF2CF2CF2CF3, CF2CF2CF(CF3)2, C(CF3)2C2F5, CF2CF2CF2CF2CF2CF3, CF(CF3) CF2CF2C2F5, and C(CF3)2CF2C2F5.  In one embodiment the fluoroolefins of Formula I, have at least about 3 carbon atoms in the molecule. In another embodiment, the fluoroolefins of Formula I have at least about 4 carbon atoms in the molecule. In yet another embodiment, the fluoroolefins of Formula I have at least about 5 carbon atoms in the molecule. Exemplary, non-limiting Formula I compounds are presented in Table 1.<br>
TABLE 1<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Compounds of Formula I may be prepared by contacting a perfluoroalkyi iodide of the formula R1l with a perfluoroalkyltrihydroolefin of the formula R2CH=CH2 to form a trihydroiodoperfluoroalkane of the formula R1CH2CHIR2. This trihydroiodoperfluoroalkane can then be dehydroiodinated to form R1CH=CHR2. Alternatively, the olefin R1CH=CHR2 may be prepared by dehydroiodination of a trihydroiodoperfluoroalkane of the formula R1CHICH2R2 formed in turn by reacting a perfluoroalkyi iodide of the formula R2I with a perfluoroalkyltrihydroolefin of the formula R1CH=CH2.<br>
Said contacting of a perfluoroalkyi iodide with a perfluoroalkyltrihydroolefin may take place in batch mode by combining the reactants in a suitable reaction vessel capable of operating under the autogenous pressure of the reactants and products at reaction temperature. Suitable reaction vessels include fabricated from stainless steels, in particular of the austenitic type, and the well-known high nickel alloys such as Monel® nickel-copper alloys, Hastelloy® nickel based alloys and Inconel® nickel-chromium alloys.<br>
Alternatively, the reaction may take be conducted in semi-batch mode in which the perfluoroalkyltrihydroolefin reactant is added to the perfluoroalkyi iodide reactant by means of a suitable addition apparatus such as a pump at the reaction temperature.<br>
The ratio of perfluoroalkyi iodide to perfluoroalkyltrihydroolefin should be between about 1:1 to about 4:1, preferably from about 1.5:1 to 2.5:1. Ratios less than 1.5:1 tend to result in large amounts of the 2:1 adduct as reported by Jeanneaux, et. al. in Journal of Fluorine Chemistry, Vol. 4, pages 261-270 (1974).<br>
Preferred temperatures for contacting of said perfluoroalkyl iodide with said perfluoroalkyltrihydroolefin are preferably within the range of about 150°C to 300°C, preferably from about 170°C to about 250°C, and most preferably from about 180°C to about 230°C. Suitable contact times for the reaction of the perfluoroalkyl iodide with the perfluoroalkyltrihydroolefin are from about 0.5 hour to 18 hours, preferably from about 4 to about 12 hours.<br>
The trihydroiodoperfluoroalkane prepared by reaction of the perfluoroalkyl iodide with the perfluoroalkyltrihydroolefin may be used directly in the dehydroiodination step or may preferably be recovered and purified by distillation prior to the dehydroiodination step.<br>
The dehydroiodination step is carried out by contacting the trihydroiodoperfluoroalkane with a basic substance. Suitable basic substances include alkali metal hydroxides (e.g., sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide), alkali metal oxide (for example, sodium oxide), alkaline earth metal hydroxides (e.g., calcium hydroxide), alkaline earth metal oxides (e.g., calcium oxide), alkali metal alkoxides (e.g., sodium methoxide or sodium ethoxide), aqueous ammonia, sodium amide, or mixtures of basic substances such as soda lime. Preferred basic substances are sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. Said contacting of the trihydroiodoperfluoroalkane with a basic substance may take place in the liquid phase preferably in the presence of a solvent capable of dissolving at least a portion of both reactants. Solvents suitable for the dehydroiodination step include one or more polar organic solvents such as alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, isobutanol, and tertiary butanol), nitriles (e.g., acetonitrile, propionitrile, butyronitrile, benzonitrile, or adiponitrile), dimethyl sulfoxide, N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, or sulfolane. The choice of solvent may depend on the boiling point product and the ease of separation of traces of the solvent from the product during purification. Typically, ethanol or isopropanol are good solvents for the reaction.<br>
Typically, the dehydroiodination reaction may be carried out by addition of one of the reactants (either the basic substance or the trihydroiodoperfluoroalkane) to the other reactant in a suitable reaction<br>
vessel. Said reaction may be fabricated from glass, ceramic, or metal and is preferably agitated with an impeller or stirring mechanism.<br>
Temperatures suitable for the dehydroiodination reaction are from about 10°C to about 100°C, preferably from about 20°C to about 70°C.   The dehydroiodination reaction may be carried out at ambient pressure or at reduced or elevated pressure.   Of note are dehydroiodination reactions in which the compound of Formula I is distilled out of the reaction vessel as it is formed.<br>
Alternatively, the dehydroiodination reaction may be conducted by contacting an aqueous solution of said basic substance with a solution of the trihydroiodoperfluoroalkane in one or more organic solvents of lower polarity such as an alkane (e.g., hexane, heptane, or octane), aromatic hydrocarbon (e.g., toluene), halogenated hydrocarbon (e.g., methylene chloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, or perchloroethylene), or ether (e.g., diethyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, 2-methyl tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dimethoxyethane, diglyme, or tetraglyme) in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst. Suitable phase transfer catalysts include quaternary ammonium halides (e.g., tetrabutylammonium bromide, tetrabutylammonium hydrosulfate, triethylbenzylammonium chloride, dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride, and tricaprylylmethylammonium chloride), quaternary phosphonium halides (e.g., triphenylmethylphosphonium bromide and tetraphenylphosphonium chloride), or cyclic polyether compounds known in the art as crown ethers (e.g., 18-crown-6 and 15-crown-5).<br>
Alternatively, the dehydroiodination reaction may be conducted in the absence of solvent by adding the trihydroiodoperfluoroalkane to a solid or liquid basic substance.<br>
Suitable reaction times for the dehydroiodination reactions are from about 15 minutes to about six hours or more depending on the solubility of the reactants. Typically the dehydroiodination reaction is rapid and requires about 30 minutes to about three hours for completion. The compound of formula I may be recovered from the dehydroiodination reaction mixture by phase separation after addition of water, by distillation, or by a combination thereof.<br>

The compositions of the present invention may comprise a single compound of Formula I, Formula II, or Table 3 or may comprise a combination of said compounds. Additionally, many of the compounds of Formula I, Formula II, and Table 3 may exist as different configurational isomers or stereoisomers. The present invention is intended to include all single configurational isomers, single stereoisomers or any combination thereof. For instance, 1,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene (HFC-1234ze) is meant to represent the E-isomer, Z-isomer, or any combination or mixture of both isomers in any ratio. Another example is F12E, by which is represented<br>
the E-isomer, Z-isomer, or any combination or mixture of both isomers in any ratio.<br>
Compositions of the present invention have zero or low ozone depletion potential and low global warming potential (GWP). The fluoroolefins of the present invention or mixtures of fluoroolefins of this invention with other refrigerants will have global warming potentials that are less than many hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants currently in use. One aspect of the present invention is to provide a refrigerant with a global warming potential of less than 1000, less than 500, less than 150, less than 100, or less than 50. Another aspect of the present invention is to reduce the net GWP of refrigerant mixtures by adding fluoroolefins to said mixtures.<br>
The compositions of the present invention that are combinations or mixtures may be prepared by any convenient method to combine the desired amounts of the individual components. A preferred method is to weigh the desired component amounts and thereafter combine the components in an appropriate vessel. Agitation may be used, if desired.<br>
An alternative means for making compositions of the present invention comprises (i) reclaiming a volume of one or more components of a refrigerant composition from at least one refrigerant container, (ii) removing impurities sufficiently to enable reuse of said one or more of the reclaimed components, (iii) and optionally, combining all or part of said reclaimed volume of components with at least one additional refrigerant composition or component.<br>
A refrigerant container may be any container in which is stored a refrigerant blend composition that has been used in a refrigeration apparatus, air-conditioning apparatus or heat pump apparatus. Said refrigerant container may be the refrigeration apparatus, air-conditioning apparatus or heat pump apparatus in which the refrigerant blend was used. Additionally, the refrigerant container may be a storage container for collecting reclaimed refrigerant blend components, including but not limited to pressurized gas cylinders.<br>
Residual refrigerant means any amount of refrigerant blend or refrigerant blend component that may be moved out of the refrigerant<br>
container by any method known for transferring refrigerant blends or refrigerant blend components.<br>
Impurities may be any component that is in the refrigerant blend or refrigerant blend component due to its use in a refrigeration apparatus, air-conditioning apparatus or heat pump apparatus. Such impurities include but are not limited to refrigeration lubricants, being those described earlier herein, particulates such as metal or elastomer that may have come out of the refrigeration apparatus, air-conditioning apparatus or heat pump apparatus, and any other contaminants that may adversely effect the performance of the refrigerant blend composition.<br>
Such impurities may be removed sufficiently to allow reuse of the refrigerant blend or refrigerant blend component without adversely effecting the performance or equipment within which the refrigerant blend or refrigerant blend component will be used.<br>
It may be necessary to provide additional refrigerant blend or refrigerant blend component to the residual refrigerant blend or refrigerant blend component in order to produce a composition that meets the specifications required for a given product. For instance, if a refrigerant blend has 3 components in a particular weight percentage range, it may be necessary to add one or more of the components in a given amount in order to restore the composition to within the specification limits.<br>

Of particular utility in compositions comprising at least one flammable refrigerant and at least one fluoroolefin are those fluoroolefins that themselves are non-flammable. Flammability of a fluoroolefin appears to be related to the numbers of fluorine atoms and the numbers of hydrogen atoms in the molecule. The equation below provides a flammability factor that may be calculated as an indication of predicted flammability:<br>
flammability factor =    	F	<br>
(F + H)<br>
wherein:<br>
F = the number of fluorine atoms; and<br>
H = the number of hydrogen atoms in a molecule.<br>
As certain compounds have been experimentally determined to be flammable, the cut-off for non-flammable fluoroolefin flammability factors has been determined. Fluoroolefins may be determined to be flammable or non-flammable by testing under conditions specified by ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc.) Standard 34-2001, under ASTM (American Society of Testing and Materials) E681-01, with an electronic ignition source. Such tests of flammability are conducted with the compound of interest at 101 kPa (14.7 psia) and a specified temperature (often 100 °C (212 °F)) at various concentrations in air in order to determine the lower flammability limit (LFL) and/or upper flammability limit (UFL) of the test compound in air.<br>
The flammability factors for several fluoroolefins are listed in Table 4 along with the experimental determination of flammable or non-flammable. Therefore, it can be predicted for the other fluoroolefins of the present disclosure, which will be most useful in combination with the flammable refrigerants of the present disclosure as being in fact non-flammable fluoroolefins.<br>
TABLE 4<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The fluoroolefins as listed in Table 4 may be determined to be flammable or non-flammable based upon the value of the flammability factor. If the flammability factor is found to be equal to or greater than 0.70, then the fluoroolefin may be expected to be non-flammable. If the flammability factor is less than 0.70, then the fluoroolefin may be expected to be flammable.<br>

In yet another embodiment, the fluoroolefins of the present disclosure that may be particularly useful in combination with flammable refrigerants, may be at least one fluoroolefin selected from the group consisting of:<br>
(a) fluoroolefins of the formula E- or Z-R1CH=CHR2, wherein R1 and R2 are, independently,C1toC6  perfluoroalkyl groups, and wherein the flammability factor is greater than or equal to 0.70; and<br>

While the flammability factor provides a basis for predicting flammability of certain fluoroolefin compounds, there may be certain variables, such as position of the hydrogen atoms on the molecule that would account for certain isomers with a given molecular formula being flammable while other isomers are non-flammable. Therefore, the flammability factor may only be used as a tool for predicting flammability characteristics.<br>
Flammable refrigerants of the present invention comprise any compound, which may be demonstrated to propagate a flame under specified conditions of temperature, pressure and composition when mixed with air. Flammable refrigerants may be identified by testing under conditions specified by ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc.) Standard 34-2001, under ASTM (American Society of Testing and Materials) E681-01, with an electronic ignition source.

One may observe the fluorescence of the dye under an ultra-violet light. Solubilizing agents may be needed due to poor solubility of such UV dyes in some refrigerants and heat transfer fluids.<br>
By "ultra-violet" dye is meant a UV fluorescent composition that absorbs light in the ultra-violet or "near" ultra-violet region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The fluorescence produced by the UV fluorescent dye under illumination by a UV light that emits radiation with wavelength anywhere from 10 nanometer to 750 nanometer may be detected. Therefore, if refrigerant or heat transfer fluid containing such a UV fluorescent dye is leaking from a given point in a refrigeration, air-conditioning, or heat pump apparatus, the fluorescence can be detected at the leak point, or in the vicinity of the leak point. Such UV fluorescent dyes include but are not limited to naphthalimides, perylenes, coumarins, anthracenes, phenanthracenes, xanthenes, thioxanthenes, naphthoxanthenes, fluoresceins, and derivatives of said dye or combinations thereof.

Solubility of these UV fluorescent dyes in refR1gerant and heat transfer compositions may be poor. Therefore, methods for introducing these dyes into the refR1geration, air-conditioning, or heat pump apparatus have been awkward, costly and time consuming. US patent no. RE 36,951, incorporated herein by reference, descR1bes a method, which utilizes a dye powder, solid pellet or slurry of dye that may be inserted into a component of the refR1geration or air-conditioning apparatus. As refR1gerant and lubR1cant are circulated through the apparatus, the dye is dissolved or dispersed and carR1ed throughout the apparatus. Numerous other methods for introducing dye into a refR1geration or air-conditioning apparatus are descR1bed in the literature.<br>
Ideally, the UV fluorescent dye could be dissolved in the refR1gerant thereby not requiR1ng any specialized method for introduction to the refR1geration, air-conditioning, or heat pump apparatus. The present invention relates to compositions including UV fluorescent dye, which may be introduced into the system dissolved in the refR1gerant in combination with a solubilizing agent. The inventive compositions will allow the storage and transport of dye-containing refR1gerant and heat transfer fluid even at low temperatures while maintaining the dye in solution.<br>
In the present compositions compR1sing refR1gerant, UV fluorescent dye and solubilizing agent, or compR1sing heat transfer fluid and UV fluorescent dye and solubilizing agent, from about 1 to about 50<br>
weight percent, preferably from about 2 to about 25 weight percent, and most preferably from about 5 to about 15 weight percent of the combined composition is solubilizing agent in the refR1gerant or heat transfer fluid. In the compositions of the present invention the UV fluorescent dye is present in a concentration from about 0.001 weight percent to about 1.0 weight percent in the refR1gerant or heat transfer fluid, preferably from 0.005 weight percent to about 0.5 weight percent, and most preferably from 0.01 weight percent to about 0.25 weight percent.<br>
Solubilizing agents such as ketones may have an objectionable odor, which can be masked by addition of an odor masking agent or fragrance. Typical examples of odor masking agents or fragrances may include Evergreen, Fresh Lemon, Cherry, Cinnamon, Peppermint, Floral or Orange Peel, all of which are commercially available, as well as d-limonene and pinene. Such odor masking agents may be used at concentrations of from about 0.001% to as much as about 15% by weight based on the combined weight of odor masking agent and solubilizing agent.<br>
The present invention further relates to a method of using the refR1gerant or heat transfer fluid compositions compR1sing ultraviolet fluorescent dye to detect leaks in refR1geration apparatus, air-conditioning apparatus, or heat pump apparatus. The presence of the dye in the compositions allows for detection of leaking refR1gerant in the refR1geration, air-conditioning, or heat pump apparatus. Leak detection helps to one to address, resolve and/or prevent inefficient operation of the apparatus or system or equipment failure. Leak detection also helps one contain chemicals used in the operation of the apparatus.<br>
The method compR1ses providing the composition compR1sing refR1gerant, ultra-violet fluorescent dye or compR1sing heat transfer fluid and UV fluorescent dye, as descR1bed herein, and optionally, a solubilizing agent as descR1bed herein, to refR1geration, air-conditioning, or heat pump apparatus and employing a suitable means for detecting the UV fluorescent dye-containing refR1gerant. Suitable means for detecting the dye include, but are not limited to, ultra-violet lamps, often referred to as a "black light" or "blue light". Such ultra-violet lamps are commercially available from numerous sources specifically designed for detecting UV fluorescent dye. Once the ultra-violet fluorescent dye containing<br>
composition has been introduced to the refR1geration, air-conditioning, or heat pump apparatus and has been allowed to circulate throughout the system, a leak point or the vicinity of the leak point can be located by shining said ultra-violet lamp on the apparatus and observing the fluorescence of the dye in the vicinity of any leak point.<br>
Mechanical refR1geration is pR1maR1ly an application of thermodynamics wherein a cooling medium, such as a refR1gerant, goes through a cycle so that it can be recovered for reuse. Commonly used cycles include vapor-compression, absorption, steam-jet or steam-ejector, and air.<br>
Vapor-compression refR1geration systems include an evaporator, a compressor, a condenser, and an expansion device. A vapor-compression cycle re-uses refR1gerant in multiple steps producing a cooling effect in one step and a heating effect in a different step. The cycle can be descR1bed simply as follows. Liquid refR1gerant enters an evaporator through an expansion device, and the liquid refR1gerant boils in the evaporator at a low temperature to form a gas and produce cooling. The low-pressure gas enters a compressor where the gas is compressed to raise its pressure and temperature. The higher-pressure (compressed) gaseous refR1gerant then enters the condenser in which the refR1gerant condenses and discharges its heat to the environment. The refR1gerant returns to the expansion device through which the liquid expands from the higher-pressure level in the condenser to the low-pressure level in the evaporator, thus repeating the cycle.<br>
There are vaR1ous types of compressors that may be used in refR1geration applications. Compressors can be generally classified as reciprocating, rotary, jet, centR1fugal, scroll, screw or axial-flow, depending on the mechanical means to compress the fluid, or as positive-displacement (e.g., reciprocating, scroll or screw) or dynamic (e.g., centR1fugal or jet), depending on how the mechanical elements act on the fluid to be compressed.<br>
The compositions of the present invention compR1sing fluoroolefins may be useful in any of the compressor types mentioned above. The choice of refR1gerant for any given compressor will depend on many factors including for instance, boiling point and vapor pressure requirements.<br>
Either positive displacement or dynamic compressors may be used in the present inventive processes. A centR1fugal type compressor is one preferred type of equipment for certain of the refR1gerant compositions compR1sing at least one fluoroolefin.<br>
A centR1fugal compressor uses rotating elements to accelerate the refR1gerant radially, and typically includes an impeller and diffuser housed in a casing. CentR1fugal compressors usually take fluid in at an impeller eye, or central inlet of a circulating impeller, and accelerate it radially outward. Some static pressure R1se occurs in the impeller, but most of the pressure R1se occurs in the diffuser section of the casing, where velocity is converted to static pressure. Each impeller-diffuser set is a stage of the compressor. CentR1fugal compressors are built with from 1 to 12 or more stages, depending on the final pressure desired and the volume of refR1gerant to be handled.<br>
The pressure ratio, or compression ratio, of a compressor is the ratio of absolute discharge pressure to the absolute inlet pressure. Pressure delivered by a centR1fugal compressor is practically constant over a relatively wide range of capacities.<br>
Positive displacement compressors draw vapor into a chamber, and the chamber decreases in volume to compress the vapor. After being compressed, the vapor is forced from the chamber by further decreasing the volume of the chamber to zero or nearly zero. A positive displacement compressor can build up a pressure, which is limited only by the volumetR1c efficiency and the strength of the parts to withstand the pressure.<br>
Unlike a positive displacement compressor, a centR1fugal compressor depends entirely on the centR1fugal force of the high-speed impeller to compress the vapor passing through the impeller. There is no positive displacement, but rather what is called dynamic-compression.<br>
The pressure a centR1fugal compressor can develop depends on the tip speed of the impeller. Tip speed is the speed of the impeller measured at its tip and is related to the diameter of the impeller and its revolutions per minute. The capacity of the centR1fugal compressor is determined by the size of the passages through the impeller. This makes the size of the compressor more dependent on the pressure required than the capacity.<br>
Because of its high-speed operation, a centR1fugal compressor is fundamentally a high volume, low-pressure machine. A centR1fugal compressor works best with a low-pressure refR1gerant, such as tR1chlorofluoromethane (CFC-11) or 1,2,2-tR1chlorotR1fluoroethane (CFC-113). Some of the low pressure refR1gerant fluids of the present invention may be suitable as drop-in replacements for CFC-113 in existing centR1fugal equipment.<br>
Large centR1fugal compressors typically operate at 3000 to 7000 revolutions per minute (rpm). Small turbine centR1fugal compressors (mini-centR1fugal compressors) are designed for high speeds, from about 40,000 to about 70,000 (rpm), and have small impeller sizes, typically less than 0.15 meters (about 6 inches).<br>
A multi-stage impeller may be used in a centR1fugal compressor to improve compressor efficiency thus requiR1ng less power in use. For a two-stage system, in operation, the discharge of the first stage impeller goes to the suction intake of a second impeller. Both impellers may operate by use of a single shaft (or axle). Each stage can build up a compression ratio of about 4 to 1; that is, the absolute discharge pressure can be four times the absolute suction pressure. Several examples of two-stage centR1fugal compressor systems, particularly for automotive applications, are descR1bed in US 5,065,990 and US 5,363,674, both incorporated herein by reference.<br>

The method for producing heating or cooling may be used in stationary air-conditioning, heat pumps or mobile air-conditioning and refR1geration systems. Stationary air-conditioning and heat pump applications include window, ductless, ducted, packaged terminal, chillers and commercial, including packaged rooftop. RefR1geration applications include domestic or home refR1gerators and freezers, ice machines, self-contained coolers and freezers, walk-in coolers and freezers and transport refR1geration systems.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may additionally be used in air-conditioning, heating and refR1geration systems that employ fin and tube heat exchangers, microchannel heat exchangers and vertical or hoR1zontal single pass tube or plate type heat exchangers.<br>
Conventional microchannel heat exchangers may not be ideal for the low pressure refR1gerant compositions of the present invention. The low operating pressure and density result in high flow velocities and high fR1ctional losses in all components. In these cases, the evaporator design may be modified. Rather than several microchannel slabs connected in seR1es (with respect to the refR1gerant path) a single slab/single pass heat exchanger arrangement may be used. Therefore, a preferred heat exchanger for the refR1gerant or heat transfer fluid compositions of the present invention is a single slab/single pass heat exchanger.<br>
The present invention further relates to a process for producing cooling compR1sing evaporating the fluoroolefin compositions of the present invention in the vicinity of a body to be cooled, and thereafter condensing said compositions.<br>
The present invention further relates to a process for producing heat compR1sing condensing the fluoroolefin compositions of the present invention in the vicinity of a body to be heated, and thereafter evaporating said compositions.<br>
The present invention further relates to a process to produce cooling compR1sing compressing a composition compR1sing at least one fluoroolefin in a centR1fugal compressor, condensing said composition, and thereafter evaporating said composition in the vicinity of a body to be cooled. Additionally, the centR1fugal compressor of the inventive method may be a multi-stage centR1fugal compressor and preferably a 2-stage centR1fugal compressor.<br>
The present invention further relates to a process to produce cooling in a refR1geration apparatus, air-conditioning apparatus, or heat pump apparatus, wherein said apparatus compR1ses at least one single slab/single pass heat exchanger, said process compR1sing condensing a composition of the present invention, and thereafter evaporating said composition in the vicinity of a body to be cooled.<br>
The compositions of the present invention are particularly useful in small turbine centR1fugal compressors (mini-centR1fugal compressors), which can be used in auto and window air-conditioning, heat pumps, or transport refR1geration, as well as other applications. These high efficiency mini-centR1fugal compressors may be dR1ven by an electR1c motor and can therefore be operated independently of the engine speed. A constant compressor speed allows the system to provide a relatively constant cooling capacity at all engine speeds. This provides an opportunity for efficiency improvements especially at higher engine speeds as compared to a conventional R-134a automobile air-conditioning system. When the cycling operation of conventional systems at high dR1ving speeds is taken into account, the advantage of these low pressure systems becomes even greater.<br>
Alternatively, rather than use electR1cal power, the mini-centR1fugal compressor may be powered by an engine exhaust gas dR1ven turbine or a ratioed gear dR1ve assembly with ratioed belt dR1ve. The electR1cal power available in current automobile design is about 14 volts, but the new mini-centR1fugal compressor requires electR1cal power of about 50 volts. Therefore, use of an alternative power source would be advantageous. A refR1geration apparatus or air-conditioning apparatus powered by an engine exhaust gas dR1ven turbine is descR1bed in detail in U.S. Patent Application seR1al no. 11/367,517, filed March 3, 2006,. A refR1geration apparatus or air-conditioning apparatus powered by a ratioed gear dR1ve assembly is descR1bed in detail in U.S. Patent Application seR1al no. 11/378,832, filed March 17, 2006.<br>
The present invention further relates to a process to produce cooling compR1sing compressing a composition of the present invention, in a mini-centR1fugal compressor powered by an engine exhaust gas dR1ven turbine; condensing said composition; and thereafter evaporating said composition in the vicinity of a body to be cooled.<br>
The present invention further relates to a process to produce cooling compR1sing compressing a composition of the present invention, in a mini-centR1fugal compressor powered by a ratioed gear dR1ve assembly with a ratioed belt dR1ve; condensing said composition; and thereafter evaporating said composition in the vicinity of a body to be cooled.<br>
The present invention relates to a process to produce cooling in a refR1geration apparatus, air-conditioning apparatus, or heat pump apparatus, wherein said apparatus compR1ses at least one single slab/single pass heat exchanger, said process compR1sing compressing a composition of the present invention, in a centR1fugal compressor, condensing said composition, and thereafter evaporating said composition in the vicinity of a body to be cooled.<br>
The present invention further relates to a method for replacing or substituting for a refR1gerant composition having a GWP of about 150 or more, or a high GWP refR1gerant, with a composition having a lower GWP. One method compR1ses providing a composition compR1sing at least one fluoroolefin of the present invention as the replacement.  In another embodiment of the present invention the refR1gerant or heat transfer fluid composition of the present invention, having a lower GWP than the composition being replaced or substituted is introduced into the refR1geration, air conditioning or heat pump apparatus.   In some cases, the high GWP refR1gerant present in the apparatus will need to be removed from the apparatus before introduction of the lower GWP compositions. In other cases, the fluoroolefin compositions of the present invention may be introduced into the apparatus while the high GWP refR1gerant is present.<br>
Global warming potentials (GWPs) are an index for estimating relative global warming contR1bution due to atmospheR1c emission of a kilogram of a particular greenhouse gas compared to emission of a kilogram of carbon dioxide. GWP can be calculated for different time hoR1zons showing the effect of atmospheR1c lifetime for a given gas. The GWP for the 100 year time hoR1zon is commonly the value referenced.<br>
A high GWP refR1gerant would be any compound capable of functioning as a refR1gerant or heat transfer fluid having a GWP at the 100 year time hoR1zon of about 1000 or greater, alternatively 500 or greater, 150 or greater, 100 or greater, or 50 or greater. RefR1gerants and heat transfer fluids that are in need of replacement, based upon GWP<br>
calculations published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), include but are not limited to HFC-134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane).<br>
The present invention will provide compositions that have zero or low ozone depletion potential and low global warming potential (GWP). The fluoroolefins of the present invention or mixtures of fluoroolefins of this invention with other refR1gerants will have global warming potentials that are less than many hydrofluorocarbon refR1gerants currently in use. Typically, the fluoroolefins of the present invention are expected to have GWP of less than about 25. One aspect of the present invention is to provide a refR1gerant with a global warming potential of less than 1000, less than 500, less than 150, less than 100, or less than 50. Another aspect of the present invention is to reduce the net GWP of refR1gerant mixtures by adding fluoroolefins to said mixtures.<br>
The present invention further relates to a method for loweR1ng the GWP of a refR1gerant or heat transfer fluid, said method compR1sing combining said refR1gerant or heat transfer fluid with at least one fluoroolefin of the present invention. In another embodiment, the method for loweR1ng the global warming potential compR1ses combining said first composition with a composition compR1sing at least one fluorolefin, to produce a second composition suitable for use as a refR1gerant or heat transfer fluid, and wherein said second composition has a lower global warming potential than said first composition.   It may be determined that the GWP of a mixture or combination of compounds may be calculated as a weighted average of the GWP for each of the pure compounds.<br>
The present invention further relates to a method of using the composition of the present invention compR1sing at least one fluoroolefin to lower global warming potential of an oR1ginal refR1gerant or heat transfer fluid composition, said method compR1sing combining said oR1ginal refR1gerant or heat transfer fluid composition with the composition of the present invention compR1sing at least one fluoroolefin, to produce a second refR1gerant or heat transfer fluid composition wherein said second refR1gerant or heat transfer fluid composition has a lower global warming potential than said oR1ginal refR1gerant or heat transfer fluid composition.<br>
The present invention further relates to a method for reducing the GWP of an oR1ginal refR1gerant or heat transfer fluid composition in a<br>
refR1geration, air-conditioning or heat pump apparatus, wherein said oR1ginal refR1gerant or heat transfer fluid has a GWP of about 150 or higher; said method compR1sing introducing a second, lower GWP refR1gerant or heat transfer fluid composition of the present invention into said refR1geration, air-conditioning or heat pump apparatus. .<br>
The present method for reducing the GWP of an oR1ginal refR1gerant may further compR1se removing the oR1ginal refR1gerant or heat transfer fluid composition from said refR1geration, air-conditioning or heat pump apparatus before the second, lower GWP refR1gerant or heat transfer fluid is introduced.<br>
The present invention further relates to a method for replacing an oR1ginal refR1gerant or heat transfer fluid composition with a second refR1gerant or heat transfer fluid composition compR1sing providing a composition of the present invention as the second refR1gerant or heat transfer fluid composition. An oR1ginal refR1gerant may be any refR1gerant being used in a refR1geration, air-conditioning or heat pump apparatus in need of replacement<br>
The oR1ginal refR1gerant or heat transfer fluid needing replacement may be any of hydrofluorocarbon refR1gerants, chlorofluorocarbon refR1gerants, hydrochlorofluorocarbon, refR1gerants, fluoroether refR1gerants, or blends of refR1gerant compounds.<br>

The present invention relates to a method for reducing the fire hazard in refR1geration apparatus, air-conditioning apparatus, or heat pump apparatus, said method compR1sing introducing a composition of the present invention into said refR1gerant apparatus or air-conditioning apparatus.<br>
RefR1gerant that may leak from a refR1geration apparatus, air-conditioning apparatus, or heat pump apparatus, is a major concern when consideR1ng flammability. Should a leak occur in a refR1geration apparatus or air-conditioning apparatus, refR1gerant and potentially a small amount of lubR1cant may be released from the system. If this leaking mateR1al comes in contact with an ignition source, a fire may result. By fire hazard is meant the probability that a fire may occur either within or in the vicinity of a refR1geration apparatus, air-conditioning apparatus, or heat pump apparatus. Reducing the fire hazard in a refR1geration apparatus, air-conditioning apparatus, or heat pump apparatus may be accomplished by using a refR1gerant or heat transfer fluid that is not considered flammable as determined and defined by the methods and standards descR1bed previously herein. Additionally, the non-flammable fluoroolefins of the present invention may be added to a flammable refR1gerant or heat transfer fluid, either in the apparatus already or pR1or to adding to the apparatus. The non-flammable fluoroolefins of the present invention reduce the probability of a fire in the event of a leak and/or reduce the degree of fire hazard by reducing the temperature or size of any flame produced.<br>
The present invention further relates to a method for reducing fire hazard in or in the vicinity of a refR1geration apparatus, air-conditioning apparatus, or heat pump apparatus, said method compR1sing combining at least one non-flammable fluoroolefin with a flammable refR1gerant and introducing the combination into a refR1geration apparatus, air-conditioning apparatus, or heat pump apparatus.<br>
The present invention further relates to a method for reducing fire hazard in or in the vicinity of a refR1geration apparatus, air-conditioning apparatus, or heat pump apparatus, said method compR1sing combining at least one non-flammable fluoroolefin with a lubR1cant and introducing the<br>
combination into the refR1geration apparatus, air-conditioning apparatus, or heat pump apparatus compR1sing flammable refR1gerant.<br>
The present invention further relates to a method for reducing fire hazard in or in the vicinity of a refR1geration apparatus, air-conditioning apparatus, or heat pump apparatus, said method compR1sing introducing at least one fluoroolefin into said apparatus.<br>
The present invention further relates to a method of using a flammable refR1gerant in refR1geration apparatus, air-conditioning apparatus, or heat pump apparatus, said method compR1sing combining said flammable refrigerant with at least one fluoroolefin.<br>
The present invention further relates to a method for reducing flammability of a flammable refR1gerant or heat transfer fluid, said method compR1sing combining the flammable refR1gerant with at least one fluoroolefin.<br>
The present invention further relates to a process for transfer of heat from a heat source to a heat sink wherein the compositions of the present invention serve as heat transfer fluids. Said process for heat transfer compR1ses transporting the compositions of the present invention from a heat source to a heat sink.<br>
Heat transfer fluids are utilized to transfer, move or remove heat from one space, location, object or body to a different space, location, object or body by radiation, conduction, or convection. A heat transfer fluid may function as a secondary coolant by providing means of transfer for cooling (or heating) from a remote refR1geration (or heating) system. In some systems, the heat transfer fluid may remain in a constant state throughout the transfer process (i.e., not evaporate or condense). Alternatively, evaporative cooling processes may utilize heat transfer fluids as well.<br>
A heat source may be defined as any space, location, object or body from which it is desirable to transfer, move or remove heat. Examples of heat sources may be spaces (open or enclosed) requiR1ng refR1geration or cooling, such as refR1gerator or freezer cases in a supermarket, building spaces requiR1ng air-conditioning, or the passenger compartment of an automobile requiR1ng air-conditioning. A heat sink may be defined as any space, location, object or body capable of absorbing<br>
heat. A vapor compression refR1geration system is one example of such a heat sink.<br>

The results indicate that HFC-1234yf and E-HFC-1234ze are flammable, while HFC-1225ye, HFC-1429myz/mzy, and F12E are non¬flammable. For mixtures of HFC-1225ye and HFC-32 (which is known to be flammable in the pure state) it has been determined that 37 weight percent HFC-32 is the highest amount that can be present to maintain the non-flammable characteR1stic. Those compositions compR1sing fluoroolefins that are non-flammable are more acceptable candidates as refR1gerant or heat transfer fluid compositions.<br><br>

Tip Speed to Develop Pressure<br>
Tip speed can be estimated by making some fundamental relationships for refR1geration equipment that use centR1fugal compressors. The torque an impeller ideally imparts to a gas is defined as<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Equation 1 where<br>
T = torque, Newton-meters<br>
m = mass rate of flow, kg/sec<br>
V2 = tangential velocity of refR1gerant leaving impeller (tip speed), meters/sec<br>
X2 = radius of exit impeller, meters<br>
v1 = tangential velocity of refR1gerant enteR1ng impeller, meters/sec<br>
r1 = radius of inlet of impeller, meters<br>
Assuming the refR1gerant enters the impeller in an essentially axial direction, the tangential component of the velocity vi = 0, therefore<br>

Although Equation 8 is based on some fundamental assumptions, it provides a good estimate of the tip speed of the impeller and provides an important way to compare tip speeds of refR1gerants.<br>
