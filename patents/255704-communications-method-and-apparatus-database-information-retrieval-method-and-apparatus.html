TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Communications Method and Apparatus, Database Information Retrieval Method and<br>
Apparatus<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method of establishing a communications session<br>
between first and second devices associated with first and second parties respectively.<br>
In one particular example of the present invention, establishment of the communications<br>
session is performed using the Session Initiation Protocol. A further aspect of the<br>
present invention relates to a database system, a database, a method for retrieving<br>
information from a database, and a method for enabling retrieval of information from a<br>
database.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a signalling protocol for creating, modifying and<br>
terminating sessions involving one or more participants in a communications network.<br>
These sessions include Internet multimedia conferences, Internet (or any IP network)<br>
telephone calls and multimedia distribution, with participants in a session<br>
communicating via a multicast or via a number of unicast relations, or a combination of<br>
these.<br>
The SIP allows session originators to deliver invitations to potential session participants<br>
wherever they may be in the network, providing name translation and user location<br>
functions to ensure that the call reaches the called party irrespective of their location.<br>
The SIP also provides feature negotiation functions which allow the parties involved in<br>
a call to agree on the features supported, recognising that not all the parties can support<br>
the same level of features (for example, video may or may not be supported). The SIP<br>
also provides call participant management functions, allowing a party to bring other<br>
parties into the session or cancel connections with certain other parties; parties can also<br>
be transferred or placed on hold. Finally, the SIP supports call feature change functions<br><br><br>
whereby a party in a session is able to change the call characteristics during the course<br>
of the call, for example changing the session from one set up as "voice-only" to one that<br>
enables a video function. A third party joining a call may also require different features<br>
to be enabled in order to participate in the call.<br>
The SIP is an RFC (Request For Comments) standard (RFC 3261) from the Internet<br>
Engineering Task Forse (IETF), which can be located at<br>
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3261.txt. The SIP is an application layer protocol, and takes a<br>
modular approach that is free from any underlying protocol or architectural constraints.<br>
The SIP has been designed so that it can easily bind SIP functions to existing protocols<br>
and applications, such as e-mail and Web browsers, focussing on a specific set of<br>
functions. The SIP has also been designed to reuse as many existing protocols and<br>
protocol design concepts as possible; for example, SIP was modelled after HTTP, using<br>
Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) for addressing and the Session Description<br>
Protocol (SDP) to convey session information. With the SIP, each party is identified<br>
through a hierarchical URL that is built around elements such as a user's phone number<br>
or host name (for example, sip:<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="f98c8a9c8bb99a969489989780d79a9694">[email&#160;protected]</a>), meaning that it is straightforward<br>
to redirect a caller to another phone as it is to redirect someone to a webpage.<br>
The SIP also uses MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) to convey<br>
information about the protocol used to describe the session, and as a result, SIP<br>
messages can contain Java Applets, images, audio files, authorisation tokens or billing<br>
data. The SIP also uses the Domain Name System (DNS) to deliver requests to a server<br>
that can appropriately handle them, simplifying the integration of voice and e-mail.<br>
Servers along the call path can easily create and forward e-mail messages, and vice-<br>
versa, enabling various combined services. The SIP is independent of the packet layer,<br>
typically being used over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) or the Transport Control<br>
Protocol (TCP).<br>
The SIP has been adopted by the Voice-over-IP community as its protocol of choice for<br>
signalling, and as will be described further below has been chosen as the signalling<br><br>
protocol for establishing multimedia sessions in Universal Mobile Telecommunications<br>
System (UMTS) Release 5 EP Multimedia Subsystems (IMS).<br>
Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings is a schematic illustration of a communications<br>
network 1 which uses the SIP to initiate a voice session between a first device 2 and a<br>
second device 4. The communications network 1 further comprises a SIP proxy server<br>
6 and an application server 8. The establishment of a voice session between the first<br>
and second devices 2 and 4 will now be described with reference to Figure 2 of the<br>
accompanying drawings, which shows one example of the signal exchanges between<br>
the various components of the communications network 1 during the course of<br>
establishing the voice session.<br>
In step T1, a SIP Invite message is sent from the first device 2 to the SIP proxy server 6.<br>
The Invite message is described in detail in the above-referenced RFC document, but in<br>
summary it is a text-based message containing certain information relating to the<br>
session. For example, the body of the Invite message contains a description of the<br>
session, encoded in some protocol format such as the Session Description Protocol<br>
(SDP, see RFC 2327). The Invite message also contains a number of text header fields<br>
each followed by a string indicating information relating to that field. For example, the<br>
"from" field is followed by a SIP URL address of the calling party, while the "to" field<br>
identifies the SIP URL address of the called party. Numerous other types of session<br>
information can be included in the Invite message, as described in RFC 3261.<br>
In step T2, the Invite message is forwarded to the application server 8, by way of<br>
requesting information from the application server 8 relating to the active and available<br>
services. In step T3, the application server 8 returns a SIP "200 OK" response having a<br>
message body containing the requested information. In step T4, the SIP proxy server 6<br>
sends the Invite message to the second device 4.<br>
Since the Invite message received by the second device 4 contains information relating<br>
to the calling party associated with the first device 2, such as the name of the calling<br>
party, this allows the called party associated with the second device 4 to see information<br><br><br>
about the calling party before answering. This is similar to the Calling Line<br>
Identification Presentation (CLIP) function of conventional telephony services, where<br>
the telephone number of the calling party (and associated name if it is stored in the<br>
receiving device) is made available to the called party before answering. The CLIP<br>
function is typically enabled using a combination of DTMF (Dual Tone Multiple<br>
Frequency) and pole reversal wherein the telephone number of the calling party is sent<br>
from the local exchange before the ringing signal. Before the first ringing signal is sent,<br>
the called party's CLIP function is activated by the local exchange by reversing the<br>
polarity for the DC feed on the subscriber line. The telephone number of the calling<br>
party is then sent in the form of DTMF signals to the telephone display of the called<br>
party, and only then is the ringing signal sent to the called party.<br>
Returning to the SIP example of Figure 1, once the called party associated with the<br>
second device 4 has checked the information of the calling party associated with the<br>
first device 2, the following steps must be performed before the voice session can<br>
finally be established. In step T5, the two end parties perform a SDP negotiation in<br>
which the media characteristics for the session are negotiated in order to come to a<br>
decision on the media streams that can be supported in the session; in this example a<br>
basic voice call would be required. In step T6, the necessary resources are reserved for<br>
supporting the session, and once resource reservation is completed successfully, in step<br>
T7 the second device 4 sends a SIP "200 OK" final response and the first device 2<br>
replies with a SIP "ACK" message to confirm the session set up. In step T8, the voice<br>
session has been established, allowing the respective users of the first and second<br>
devices 2 and 4 to speak to each other.<br>
As described above, the SIP provides a useful framework for creating, modifying and<br>
terminating sessions. Nevertheless, it is desirable to extend the functionality of the SIP<br>
and other such session initiation protocols.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figure 3 is a block diagram illustrating a communications network 100 embodying the<br>
present invention. The communications network 100 comprises a first device 102, a<br>
second device 104, a SIP proxy server 106, an application server 108, a subscriber<br>
server 110, a database 112 and a mail server 114. The first and second devices 102 and<br>
104 are communications devices capable of exchanging data of a variety of different<br>
formats, including speech data. The respective users of the first and second devices 102<br>
and 104 are therefore able to communicate with each other by voice.<br>
The first and second devices 102 and 104 are multi-party devices capable of being used<br>
by more than one different user or party. For example, the second device 104 is capable<br>
of accepting voice calls directed to a number of different parties, and the first device<br>
102 is able to originate calls from a number of different parties. Before a party or a<br>
device is able to establish sessions with other parties or devices, a registration procedure<br>
must first be carried out to provide details to the SIP proxy server 106 as to which<br>
device the party is using and where the device is located. The SIP Registration method<br>
is described in detail in RFC 3261 and further explanation is not required here.<br>
However, in an embodiment of the present invention, a party or device is able to register<br>
to receive "extended caller information" as will now be explained.<br>
In the standard SIP, sufficient information is provided in the Invite message to enable<br>
the called party to determine the identity of the calling party before the called party has<br>
to accept or reject the call, as described above. An embodiment of the present invention<br>
enables a far wider range of information to be made available to the called party before<br>
he has to decide whether to take the call. This extra information is referred to in the<br>
present description either as "extended caller information" or "further information".<br><br><br>
In the present embodiment, by way of example, the extended caller information<br>
comprises information relating to e-mail communications stored in the mail server 114<br>
which have previously been sent between the calling party and the called party. As will<br>
be described below with reference to Figure 5, the extended caller information is<br>
included in the SIP Invite message, and rather than including all of the mail server data<br>
relating to e-mails between the calling party and the called party in the further<br>
information to be included in the Invite message, it is possible that only summary<br>
information relating to the e-mail communications is included. In the present<br>
embodiment, the summary information comprises only the e-mail header information,<br>
including the e-mail titles.<br>
In the description that follows, it will be assumed that a first party is using the first<br>
device 102 to call a second party who is using the second device 104. The first party<br>
has already performed a registration procedure to register the first party as using the first<br>
device 102. One possible procedure for registering the second party as using the second<br>
device 104 is shown in Figure 4. In this example, the second party wishes to indicate<br>
his preference for receiving extended caller information when the first party is calling<br>
him.<br>
In step P1, a SIP Register message is sent from the second device 104 to the SIP proxy<br>
server 106, and information about the location of the second party is updated in the<br>
subscriber server 110. In step P2, the application server 108 sends a request to the<br>
database 112 to synchronise with the mail server 114 to retrieve the relevant summary<br>
information from the mail server to be included as extended caller information at a later<br>
stage. The address of the mail server 114 is determined by the application server 108 by<br>
reference to the subscriber server 110, this information being sent in step P2 to the<br>
database 112. In step P3, the database 112 verifies that the mail server 114 exists and is<br>
accessible, and the mail server responds in step P4. A synchronization procedure takes<br>
place to ensure that up-to-date summary information from the mail server 114 is stored<br>
in the database 112. An automatic synchronization can also be set up which causes the<br>
database 112 to synchronize with the mail server 114 at predetermined intervals. In step<br>
P5, the database 112 responds to the applicable server 108 with an acknowledgement.<br><br><br>
In step P6, the SIP proxy server 106 sends a SIP "200 OK" message back to the second<br>
device 104 to indicate a successful registration and request for extended caller<br>
information for calls from the first party.<br>
Once the above registration procedure has been successfully concluded to register the<br>
second user with the SIP proxy server 106 and to indicate a requirement to receive<br>
extended caller information for calls from the first party, a method to establish a<br>
communications session between the first and second devices associated with the first<br>
and second parties respectively can be performed. Such a method will now be<br>
described with reference to Figure 5.<br>
In step S1, a SIP Invite message is sent from the first device 102 to the SIP proxy server<br>
106, indicating a request to establish a session between the first and second devices and<br>
comprising session information relating to the session. For example, the session<br>
information comprises an indication of the first and second parties. In step S2, the SIP<br>
proxy server 106 requests information from the application server 108 concerning the<br>
active and available services. In step S3, the application server 108 returns a SIP code<br>
"200 OK" providing the requested information and indicating that extended caller<br>
information has been requested by the second party when the first party is calling.<br>
In response to this indication that extended caller information is required, the SIP proxy<br>
server 106 requests in step S4 summary information from the database 112 which is to<br>
be used as the extended caller information. The database 112 notices that the stored<br>
summary information is not up to date, and accordingly in step S5 the database 112<br>
synchronises with the mail server 114 by requesting up-to-date summary information,<br>
which is returned from the mail server 114 to the database 112 in step S6. The<br>
summary information is then returned to the SIP proxy server 106 in step S7.<br>
Upon receipt of the summary information, the SIP proxy server 106 includes the<br>
information in the body of the Invite message which is then forwarded to the second<br>
device 104. The further information can be included in an extension header field of the<br>
SIP (for more, see RFC 3261). Upon receipt of the Invite message including the<br><br><br>
summary information, the information is presented at the second device 104 for<br>
inspection by the second party before deciding whether or not to accept the request to<br>
establish a session. In this embodiment, the second party would be able to view a<br>
summary of e-mails sent between the first and second parties, as well as other<br>
information extracted from the session information in the Invite message such as the<br>
number and name of the first party.<br>
If the second party decides to accept the call, a session is established between the first<br>
and second devices 102 and 104 based on information in the received Invite message by<br>
performing steps S9 to S12 which correspond to steps T5 to T8 described above with<br>
reference to Figure 2.<br>
As mentioned above, the further information (or extended caller information) included<br>
in the Invite message received by the second device 104 is summary information<br>
relating to the e-mail correspondence between the first and second parties and as such<br>
does not include complete information relating to that e-mail correspondence; for<br>
example, the main message bodies of the e-mails are not included in the summary<br>
information. If the second party wishes to view complete information relating to any<br>
one or more of the e-mail items, this can be achieved by direct communication between<br>
the second device 104 and the mail server 114 as illustrated in Figure 6. In step Q1 of<br>
Figure 6, the second device 104 requests complete information from the mail server 104<br>
relating to one or more items specified in the request. The requested complete data is<br>
returned from the mail server 114 to the second device 104 in step Q2. Such a request<br>
for complete information based on the summary information can be made at any time<br>
after receipt of the Invite message, either before or after the session is established.<br>
Although it is described above with reference to steps P2 to P5 in Figure 4 that a<br>
synchronisation is performed and/or set up between the database 112 and the mail<br>
server 114 at the registration stage, this is not essential since synchronisation can be<br>
requested during the Invite procedure as described above with reference to steps S4 to<br>
S7 of Figure 5.<br><br><br>
It is possible that an Invite message requesting establishment of a session between the<br>
first and second parties associated with the first and second devices respectively does<br>
not actually originate from the first device 102. For example, it is possible that the<br>
Invite message is sent by a third party from a third device. It is also possible that,<br>
although the Invite message indicates the second party as being the intended recipient of<br>
the call, the Invite message is actually processed by a further device such that the further<br>
information is displayed at the further device and the session is initially established<br>
between the first device 102 and the further device, with the call then being forwarded<br>
to the second party using the second device 104. The Invite message indicates a request<br>
to set up a session between two parties at whatever respective devices those parties<br>
happen to be using at the time; information about the actual devices to be uses for the<br>
session between the two parties is determined from the subscriber server 110.<br>
The usefulness of the present invention can be extended beyond just the inclusion of e-<br>
mail information in the extended caller information. For example, if the first party is<br>
calling his bank then the extended caller information could include certain information<br>
relating to the bank account of the first party. Another possibility is where the first<br>
party is calling a department store, and in this situation the extended caller information<br>
could include details relating to the first party such as his registered information and<br>
order status. Other such examples will be readily apparent to the skilled person. For<br>
example, any information relating to the first party that is likely to be of interest to the<br>
second party is a candidate for inclusion in the further information.<br>
In the above embodiment, the relevant extended caller information is located on the<br>
mail server 114, and this is retrieved by the SIP proxy server 106 not directly but<br>
through the database 112. It will be appreciated that the SIP proxy server could also<br>
retrieve the further information directly from the database or another server. Likewise,<br>
the above embodiment has been described in relation to the Session Initiation Protocol<br>
but any other equivalent protocol could be used; for example the invention can be<br>
applied to ISUP U2U information (ISDN User Part user-to-user information), where the<br>
text string is passed as is and therefore can be imparted with extended caller<br>
information. Communications between the mail server 114 and the database 112 or the<br><br><br>
second device 104 can use the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP);<br>
communications between the database 112 and the SIP proxy server 106 can use the<br>
Structured Query Language (SQL); and direct communications between the first device<br>
102 and the second device 104 after session establishment can use the Real-time<br>
Transport Protocol (RTP). However, an embodiment of the present invention is not<br>
limited to such example communications protocols.<br>
As mentioned above, SIP has become increasingly popular in the Voice-over-IP<br>
community, and in particular SIP has been chosen as the signalling protocol for<br>
establishing multimedia sessions in UMTS Release 5 IP Multimedia Subsystems (IMS).<br>
A summary of how the present invention can be applied within the context of a<br>
combination of UMTS and SIP will be described below with reference to Figure 7 but<br>
further details of the use of SIP within UMTS can be found from the 3GPP Technical<br>
Specification TS 24.228 V5.8.0 (2004-03).<br>
UMTS is a third generation wireless system designed to provide higher data rates and<br>
enhanced services to subscribers. UMTS is a successor to the Global System for<br>
Mobile Communications (GSM), with an important evolutionary step between GSM<br>
and UMTS being the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS). GPRS introduces packet<br>
switching into the GSM core network and allows direct access to packet data networks<br>
(PDNs). This enables high-data rate packets switch transmissions well beyond the<br>
64kbps limit of ISDN through the GSM call network, which is a necessity for UMTS<br>
data transmission rates of up to 2Mbps. UMTS is standardised by the 3rd Generation<br>
Partnership Project (3GPP) which is a conglomeration of regional standards bodies such<br>
as the European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI), the Association of<br>
Radio Industry Businesses (ARIB) and others.<br>
The standardisation of UMTS has progressed in three phases. The first phase is known<br>
as Release '99. The Release '99 specifications define the basic architecture that consists<br>
of the UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN), Circuit Switched Core<br>
Network (CS-CN) and Packet Switched Core Network (PS-CN). The release '99<br>
specification offers traditional circuit as well as packet-switched services. The next<br><br><br>
phase in the standardisation process is Release 4, adding new services to the '99<br>
architecture. Release 5 represents a significant shift, offering both traditional telephony<br>
as well as packet-switched services over a single converged packet-based network.<br>
The UMTS Release 5 architecture adds a new subsystem known as the IP Multimedia<br>
Subsystem (IMS) to the PS-CN for supporting traditional telephony as well as new<br>
multimedia services. The IMS is able to connect to both PSTNASDN (Public Switched<br>
Telephone Network/Integrated Services Digital Network) as well as the Internet. The<br>
3GPP has chosen SIP for signalling between a User Equipment (UE) and the IMS as<br>
well as between the components within the IMS.<br>
Figure 7 is an illustrative diagram showing an embodiment of the present invention<br>
within the UMTS context. A communications network 200 is shown as comprising a<br>
UE 204 located within a Visited Network 202. The UE 204 is attached to a Serving<br>
GPRS Support Node (SGSN) 208 via a UTRAN, which is in turn in communication<br>
with a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) 210. Within the Visited Network 202,<br>
the GGSN 210 communicates with a Proxy Call Session Control Function (P-CSCF)<br>
212, which is the first point of contact in the visited IMS network for the UE 204. The<br>
P-CSCF forwards SIP registration messages and session establishment messages to the<br>
Home Network 214.<br>
The first point of contact within the Home Network 214 is the Interrogating Call<br>
Session Control Function (I-CSCF) 216, which is an optional node in the IMS<br>
architecture, whose main purpose is to query the Home Subscriber Server (HSS) 220 to<br>
find the location of the Serving Call Session Control Function (S-CSCF) 218. The S-<br>
CSCF 218 performs session management for the IMS network, and there can be several<br>
S-CSCFs in the network. The HSS 220 is a centralised subscriber database, and has<br>
evolved from the Home Location Register (HLR) from earlier UMTS releases. The<br>
HSS 220 interfaces with the I-CSCF and the S-CSCF to provide information about the<br>
location of the subscriber and the subscriber's subscription information.<br><br><br>
The communications network 200 further comprises an application server 222, a<br>
database 224 and a mail server 226 located in the Home Network 214. From the<br>
S-CSCF 218, signalling messages are passed to the intended destination, which may be<br>
another Release 5 IMS network 228 comprising a UE 230, or to a legacy network 232<br>
comprising a PSTN interfaced through a Media Gateway Control Function (MGCF), or<br>
to an IP network 234.<br>
Specific details of the operation of the UMTS communications network 200 and of the<br>
various components within such a network can be found from the Technical<br>
Specifications for UMTS which are available from http://www.3gpp.org. However, a<br>
correspondence between parts of the communication network 100 described above<br>
with reference to Figure 3 and parts of the communications network 200 shown in<br>
Figure 7 will be readily apparent, and therefore it will be apparent to the skilled person<br>
how the method of establishing a communications session described above with<br>
reference to Figure 3 can be applied to the Figure 7 network.<br>
A summary of the correspondence between the parts is as follows: The UE 204<br>
corresponds to the first device 102; the UE 230 corresponds to the second device 104;<br>
the database 224 corresponds to the database 112; the application server 222<br>
corresponds to the application server 108; the mail server 226 corresponds to the mail<br>
server 114; the HSS 220 corresponds to the subscriber server 110; and one or more of<br>
the P-CSCF 212, I-CSCF 216 and S-CSCF 218 corresponds to the SIP proxy server<br>
106.<br>
In brief, the UE 204 establishes a connection to the SGSN 208 through the UTRAN 206<br>
using the UMTS Attach procedure. Once the UE 204 is attached to the SGSN 208, it<br>
must activate a PDP (Packet Data Protocol) address (for example, an IP address) when<br>
it wishes to begin packet data communications, including using SIP services.<br>
Activating a PDP address sets up an association between the UE's current SGSN 208<br>
and the GGSN 210, and a record of the association is known as a PDP context. The<br>
activation of a PDP context is performed by the UMTS PDP Context Activation<br>
procedure. After the UE 204 has attached to the network and activated a PDP context,<br><br>
SIP service registration can then be performed, for example in accordance with the<br>
method shown in Figure 4 relating to the second device 104, before it can establish a<br>
communications session. During the course of service registration, the HSS 220 is<br>
notified of the current location of the UE 204, updating the subscriber profile<br>
accordingly. The Home Network 204 also selects a suitable S-CSCF 218 for the UE<br>
204 and the subscriber profile is sent to that S-CSCF 218. Following the registration<br>
procedure, a communications session can then be established between the UE 204 and<br>
the UE 230 following the procedure set out and described above with reference to<br>
Figure 5.<br>
It will be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to any particular type of<br>
network architecture such as the UMTS architecture. For example, the present<br>
invention can be applied to a GPRS architecture, or to PSTN (ISUP).<br>
It will be appreciated that operation of one or more of the first device 102, SIP proxy<br>
server 106 and second device 104 can be controlled by a program operating on the<br>
device. Such an operating program can be stored on a computer-readable medium, or<br>
could, for example, be embodied in a signal such as a downloadable data signal<br>
provided from an Internet website. The appended claims are to be interpreted as<br>
covering an operating program by itself, or as a record on the carrier, or as a signal, or<br>
in any other form.<br><br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
COMMUNICATIONS METHOD AND APPARATUS, DATABASE<br>
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL METHOD AND APPARATUS<br>
A method is provided of establishing (S12) a communications session between first and<br><br>
second devices (102, 104) associated with first and second parties respectively. A<br>
session request message (Invite) is sent (S1) that indicates a request to establish the<br>
session and that comprises session information relating to the session. In response to<br>
the session request message (Invite), further information is retrieved and included in the<br>
session request message (S2 to S8). The session is established (S12) based on<br>
information in the resulting session request message (Invite). The session may be<br>
established between the first and second devices (102, 104) using the Session Initiation<br>
Protocol (SIP). The further information comprises summary information from which<br>
complete information can subsequently be determined by the second device (104) after<br>
the session has been established. The complete information is stored in a mail server<br>
(114) and the summary information derived from the complete information is stored in<br>
a database (112). The summary information in the database (112) is synchronised (S5,<br>
S6) with the complete information in the mail server (114). Summary information is<br>
retrieved (S4, S6) from the database (112) for inclusion (S8) in the further information<br>
so as to enable the second device (104) subsequently to retrieve (Q1, Q2) complete<br>
information from the mail server (114) relating to that summary information.</td>
