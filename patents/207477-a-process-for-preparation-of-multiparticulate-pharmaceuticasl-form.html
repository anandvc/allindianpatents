				<td>The invention relates to a process for preparation otmuitiparticuiate pharmaceutical form, with programmed and pulsed release.<br>
Numerous pharmaceutical to forms with delated release for oral administration are available. The release of the active ingredient must be controlled as a function of the therapeutical purpose and of the phstmscologicfll properties of the active ingredient. In consequence, it is not always desirable dial the plasmatic rate be constant. On the contrary, in order to avoid any habituation and in order to limit the side effects provoked by the active ingredient, it "would be absolutely advariijigrotjs for the plasrnahr rate lo follow the metabolic rhyihrn and the specific needs of the patient during certain periods of the nvcthemcr. For instance, in order to diminish the nocturnal symptoms or the symptoms upon awakening in the case of certain chronic diseases such as ischemic heart disease. asthma and arthritis, the drugs should be administered such a way that the desired therapeutical plasmatic level is reached only at the desired moment, that is to say during sleep or just at the moment of awakening.<br>
In the article "An Organic Acid-Induced Sigmoidal Release System for Oral Controlle.d-Release Preparations11, Pharmaceutical Research. Vol. 11. No. 1 (1994). is disclosed a pharmaceutical form wherein the release of the active ingredient is of the sismoidal type. However, it is indicated tn this article that the siqjnoidai rr.leJisr; of the active in;rrecltent ran be obtained onlv if an orcraiiu: ;icicl i:s ^dded!o the pharmaceutical form. However, due to the presence of an organic acid, such pharmaceutical forms may have an irritating ettect, which conotitxites a major drawback especially in the case of lone; lasting treatments. WO 98/17261 discloses n multiparticulate pharmaceutical form of controlled release, which comprises two kinds of medicinal spheriods, as well as its preparation process.<br>
1A<br><br>
Consequently, there does not exist at present a muitiparticulate pharmaceutical torm free of organic acid, capable of making available high concentrations of active ingredient at the moment at which the patient needs them the most, while maintaining the minimal therapeutical plasmatic concentration throughout the day.<br>
The Applicants hove had the merit of findino-uneyocrerilv und snrnrisincrJv dial it is possible to obtain such pliaimaoeutical fumis which arc easy for administration and which do not present an irritating effect.<br>
Thus, the Tnuil.tparliriifjile pharmaceutical lorrn according !o me invention wheretn the release of the-active ingredient is delayed ,and pulsed and which enables to obtain the onset of the availability of the active ingredient within 4 to 8 hours after the ingestion of the pharmaceutical form, and then a progressive release of the totality of the active ingredient within the 3 to 20 following hours, is characten2ed by the fact that it is free of organic acid and that it is in the form of microgranules or medicinal spheroids consisting of a neutral spherical core comprising a first coating based on a mixture of at least one hydrosoluble polymer and of at least one non hydrosoluble polymer throughout which are uniformly distributed the constitutive particles of an arrive ingredient, the wholft comprising1 a second coating based on at least two pI I independent polymers presenting rates of permeability  different  trom  one  another with  respect to  the gastric  and<br>
inirslinal   mrdiurns,,  optionally   at. 1ra:;l   one:  pH  dr.prntlrni. polymer,  at. \r.x'Al   ont:<br>
piasticizer and at least one ineit carrier uniformly distributed throughout the said coating..<br>
The concentration of active ingredient is very high m the coating which envelops the neutral spherical core which makes it possible to obtain medicinal spheroids of<br><br>
3<br>
reduced size and thus definite pharmaceutical forms of low size which are easier,.and more ploasant to be ingested by ths patient and which permit the administration of highe; dosages per administered drug unit.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment, this pharmaceutical form according to the invention is thu:; characterized by the fact that the active ingredient represents from 20 to 100% by weight of the coating which envelops a neutral spherical core, preferably from 60 to 90s by weight and still more preferably from 80 to 90% by we ight.<br>
The hydrosoluble polymer which is part of this composition of the coating which envelops the neutral spherical core and which contains the active ingredient i:i selected from the group comprising especially poyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, and thiair mixtures, and the non hydroso.Luble polymer is selected from the group comprising especially acrylic and/o meuhacrylic resins, cellulosic polyners, and their mixtures.<br>
The weight ratio between the hydrosoluble polyme:: and the non hydrosoluble polyme is from 0.1 to 0.9 preferably from 0.3 to 0.7, and still more preferably froin 0.45 to 0.55.<br>
The second coating of the pharmaceutical from according to the invention is based on at least two pH independent polymers which present permeability rates which are different from one another witn respect to the gastrio and the intestinal mediums, optionally at least one pU dependent polymer, at least one pla;ticizer and at least oni5 innrt carrier uniformly distributed throughout the said coating.<br>
In this second coating, tha proportion between th-a polymer which presents the lowest permeability and th.= po! ymer which presents the highest permeability, is froin 97,3 to 80/20.<br><br>
4<br>
It is necessary to respect these proportions betwesr the polymers of different permeability rates. As a matter oi faot,  in  the  case  of proportic ns  of  polymer  of  lov permeability higher than 97%, the release of the active-ingredient can be too much delayed; on the contrary, in th"s caise of proportions of polymer of low permeability lower than 80%,  the release of the ac tive ingredient is not. sufficiently delayed.<br>
The polymers of the second ooating are selected fron this group comprising especially acrylic and/or methacrylic reisins, cellulosic polymers, and their mixtures.<br>
The inert carrier which is uniformly distributed throughout the second coating is selected from the group conprising especially talc, anhydrous colloidal silicon*; dioxide, magnesium stearate, morion tear ate of glycerol and thoir mixtures.<br>
The plasticizer which is part of the constitution o:: thi? second coating must be pharmaceutically acceptable; it is selected from the group comprising especially jethylphthalate, triethylcitrate, dibutylsebacate, triacetine and their mixtures.<br>
According to an advantagsous embodiment of the invention, the active ingredient is selected from the group conprising especially the molecules which are active on th cardio-vascular system, and more especially Diltiazem and Verapamil, the anti-inflammatories, the antiallergic^ and thfi antihistamines.<br>
The pharmaceutical form according to the invention is administered at bed-time.<br>
Thus, the availability oi1 the active ingredien1; becrins about 4 to 8 hours after ingsstion, that is to say a; thtj moment of awakening of the patient, i.e. the moment a: wh:.ch certain of the symptoms anong which the risks o: cardio-vascular accidents are the highest.<br>
The release continues regularly  throughout  the<br><br>
5<br>
foLlowing 8 to 20 hours.<br>
The administration of the lext pharmaceutical forn being carried out several hours after the end of the tota._ release of the active ingredient-, the patient has the be.iefit of the minimal therapeutica. plasmatic concentration during the whole nycthemer.<br>
The process according to the invention for this preparation of the pharmaceutical form according to thn invention is characterized by a sequence of step!! comprising:<br>
-	the introduction of neutral spherical cores into<br>
a reaction vessel working on the pr .nciple of the fluidised-<br>
bed,<br>
-	the spraying onto the said neutral spherical core:;<br>
of particles of the active ing.redient suspended in a<br>
solution of at least one hydroso.uble polymer and of at<br>
least one non hydrosoluble polymer in an organic and/o::<br>
aqueous solvent,<br>
-	the spraying on the coated particles obtained in<br>
the preceding step of a coating suspension comprising at<br>
least one inert carrier suspended in a solution of a mixture<br>
of at least two polymers having permeabilities differsni:<br>
from one another with respect to the gastric and tins<br>
iniiestinal mediums,<br>
-	optionally  the  drying  of   the  medicinal   spheroid:?<br>
thus   obtained.<br>
