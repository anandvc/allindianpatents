Process for producing enantiopure P-amino acid derivatives, and enantiopure<br>
p-amino acid derivatives<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing enantiopure p-amino acid derivatives, and to enantiopure p-amino acid derivatives.<br>
Some p-amino acids and their derivatives are useful in the context of the production of peptides which can be used as medicinal products. Specific examples of such p-amino acids comprise at least one nitrogenous heterocycle.<br>
In the search for active principles, it is desirable to have amino acids which participate in the pharmacological activity in particular peptides and which can be used in the process for producing peptides or peptide analogues.<br>
US patent 3,891,616 describes some biologically active peptides containing 2-pyrrolidineacetic acid. The N-Boc derivative of this acid is prepared by treatment of natural L-proline with diazomethane.<br>
This known process requires the use of an enantiopure natural amino acid as starting product. The latter is subjected to conversions with a dangerous reagent under conditions which can involve a risk of racemization.<br>
The invention is aimed at remedying the abovementioned problems.<br>
The invention consequently relates to a process for producing enantiopure p-amino acid derivatives corresponding to general formula (I)<br>
Rl-NZ-CHR2-CH2-COOR3 (I) in which<br>
Rl and R2 independently denote organic residues optionally forming a cyclic substituent,<br>
R3 denotes H or an organic residue, and<br>
Z represents H or an amino function-protecting group,<br>
comprising a step in which a mixture of enantiomers of a compound corresponding to general formula (II)<br>
Rl-NZ-CHR2-CH2-COOR4 (II)<br>
in which<br>
Rl, R2 and Z are as defined for formula (I), and<br>
R4 is an organic residue,<br>
is subjected to hydrolysis in the presence of a lipase.<br>
It has been found that the process according to the invention makes it possible<br><br>
to produce p-amino acids or their derivatives of high enantiomeric purity with a high yield.<br>

Rl and R2 independently denote organic residues optionally forming a cyclic substituent,<br>

comprising a step in which a mixture of enantiomers of a compound corresponding to general formula (II)<br>
Rl-NZ-CHR2-CH2-COOR4 (II) in which<br>
Rl, R2 and Z are as defined for formula (I), and<br>
R4 is an organic residue,<br>
is subjected to hydrolysis in the presence of a lipase.<br>
2	- Process according to Claim 1, in which the substituents Rl and R2 in the compounds of general formula (I) and (II) form a heterocycle with the group N-Z-CH, said ring preferably comprising from 4 to 8 atoms, more particularly from 5 to 7 atoms.<br>
3	- Process according to Claim 2, in which the heterocycle comprises at least one additional hetero atom preferably chosen from N, O and S.<br>
4	- Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, in which the substituent Z in the compound of general formula (II) is an amino function-protecting group, in particular an alkoxycarbonyl group, an aryloxycarbonyl group or an aralkoxycarbonyl group.<br>
5	- Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, in which the substituent R4 in the compound of general formula (II) is a methyl or ethyl group.<br>
6	- Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, in which the lipase is Pseudomonas cepacia lipase.<br>
7	- Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, in which the hydrolysis is<br><br>
carried out at a temperature of 0 to 50°C and a pH of 6 to 8.<br>
8	- Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, in which the amount of lipase used is 10 to 100 mg/mmol of compound of formula (II).<br>
9	- Process for producing a peptide or a peptide analogue, according to which<br>
(a)	an enantiopure p-amino acid derivative is produced according to the<br>
process of any one of Claims 1 to 8;<br>
(b)	the enantiopure p-amino acid derivative obtained is used to produce<br>
the peptide or the peptide analogue.<br>
10	- Enantiopure p-amino acid derivative corresponding to general formula (I)<br>
Rl-NZ-CHR2-CH2-COOR3 (I) in which the substituents Rl and R2 form a heterocycle with the group N-Z-CH, said heterocycle comprising at least one additional hetero atom,<br>
R3 denotes H or an organic residue, and<br>
Z represents H or an amino function-protecting group.<br>
11	- Enantiopure P-amino acid derivative according to Claim 10, in which the<br>
heterocycle comprises from 5 to 7 atoms and the additional hetero atom is chosen<br>
from N, O and S.<br>
12	- Peptide or peptide analogue which can be obtained using, in the process<br>
for producing it, an enantiopure p-amino acid derivative according to Claim 10 or<br>
11.<br><br></td>
