				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a cobalt-based alloy for<br>
the coating of organs subject to erosion by liquid.<br>
In particular, the present invention relates to a cobalt-<br>
based alloy in powder form suitable for the coating of<br>
organs subject to erosion by liquid such as the blades of<br>
vapour turbines and the relative application method to<br>
increase its resistance to erosion following impact with<br>
liquid particles.<br>
It is known that in vapour turbines the condensation<br>
pressure values must be as low as possible in order to<br>
obtain the highest outlet power in simple and combined<br>
cycles.<br>
Under these operating conditions, the low pressure rotor<br>
blades are subjected to different chemical and physical<br>
stress and therefore undergo erosion processes due both<br>
to the presence of numerous water particles in the vapour<br>
flow and also to the high peak rates of the blades.<br>
The erosion phenomena of vapour turbine components, which<br><br>
occur as a result of repeated impact with liquids under<br>
prolonged operating conditions, have already been the<br>
subject of studies and are documented in Wear, M. Lesser<br>
1995, 28-34.<br>
In order to avoid the drawbacks due to these erosion phe-<br>
nomena, attempts were made to solve the problem, from the<br>
design point of view, by increasing the axial spacing be-<br>
tween the stator and rotor or by extracting the humidity<br>
between the rows of blades through holes or air gaps<br>
situated on the blades of the stator.<br>
These remediations did not prove to be particularly suit-<br>
able for solving the problem, as they cause a reduction<br>
in the performances of the turbine.<br>
Attempts were then made to prolong the average operating<br>
life of the turbine blades, by studying new coating mate-<br>
rials which are capable of reducing the erosion rate of<br>
the metals caused by impact liquid separation (F.J. Hey-<br>
mann, ASM Handbook Vol. 18, page 221).<br>
The improvements in this field have so far been reached<br>
by resorting to specific treatment on the metal surface<br>
of the blades, such as induction or local flame harden-<br>
ing, by means of stellite plate brazing or with tool<br>
steels, or by means of hard coatings applied by welding.<br>
In order to evaluate the resistance to erosion, the coat-<br>
ing materials of the known art have been subdivided, ap-<br><br>
proximately, into two groups, that of carbides and that<br>
of metallic materials among which Stellite 6, according<br>
to what is already described in literature for example in<br>
the publication "Erosion-resistant Coating for Low-<br>
Pressure Steam Turbine Blades, Euromat '99".<br>
Ionic nitriding with PVD coating using titanium nitride<br>
and chromium or zirconium nitride were selected for the<br>
surface treatment.<br>
The blades subjected to ionic nitriding treatment fol-<br>
lowed by two subsequent PVD coatings were made up of a<br>
layer of titanium nitride followed by a coating of zirco-<br>
nium nitride or chromium nitride.<br>
All the PVD coatings had a thickness of about 3-4 Âµm. The<br>
coating tests showed a coating discontinuity of the mod-<br>
els and the behaviour was considered unsatisfactory.<br>
A SEM test revealed that the PVD coating was not substan-<br>
tially capable of opposing impact erosion whereas the ni-<br>
tride layer was subject to lesions as a result of micro-<br>
fractures together with the foil nitrides present in the<br>
structure.<br>
Blades with metallic coatings were then tested with HVOF<br>
(Triballoy 800) .<br>
The performances of the Triballoy 800 alloy, as coating<br>
material against erosion from liquids, proved to be in-<br>
adequate .<br><br>
From the indications obtained in the tests effected, it<br>
can in fact be held that these metal alloy coatings are<br>
not even as effective, in limiting erosion phenomena, as<br>
uncoated surfaces of the base material.<br>
This behaviour on the part of the Triballoy 800 alloy is<br>
verified both by the results of the adhesion tests (all<br>
the coatings tested did not pass this test) and also<br>
through SEM micrographic observation which revealed the<br>
presence of numerous micro-fractures in the coating<br>
layer. The microstructure of these coatings, in fact, has<br>
a high oxide content and a marked porosity which make it<br>
unsuitable for resisting erosion by liquids.<br>
Blades with metallic coatings (Stellite 6) were then<br>
tested with HVOF.<br>
Although stellite alloys are known as being a material<br>
suitable for coating, they show all their limits when ap-<br>
plied by means of HVOF. Micrographic analysis, in fact,<br>
demonstrates that low content particles are also envel-<br>
oped in a film of oxide.<br>
This fact is also confirmed by the surface morphology re-<br>
vealed by means of SEM, which shows a detachment or un-<br>
gluing of the material specifically along these parti-<br>
cles .<br>
Blades treated with coatings with HVOF and SD-Gun TM car-<br>
bides were then tested.<br><br>
The results obtained with these types of coatings are in<br>
some cases comparable to or better than those obtained<br>
with the hardened base material (WC-10Co-4CrSD-Gun TM and<br>
88 WC-12CO HVOF).<br>
The cases in which an unsatisfactory behaviour is veri-<br>
fied can be explained by the reduced adhesion of the<br>
coating and through the known intrinsic fragility (due to<br>
the presence of chromium carbides).<br>
Vice versa, the coatings of the known art which provide<br>
better results are those made of tungsten carbides with a<br>
cobalt or chromium-cobalt matrix, depending on the coat-<br>
ing process used.<br>
Coatings which have a good resistance to erosion are<br>
characterized by a detachment of the material on a small<br>
portion of the sample whereas this phenomenon is extended<br>
to a much larger surface of the materials whose resis-<br>
tance properties are considered unsatisfactory.<br>
This different behaviour can be explained by considering<br>
the surface morphology.<br>
When the layer of surface coating starts losing its con-<br>
formation following the loss of material, the liq-<br>
uid/solid interaction is particularly complex. In this<br>
situation, the impulse or impact pressures which trigger<br>
the erosion phenomenon, are greatly influenced by the<br>
point in which there is initial contact with the drops<br><br>
which fall on a crest (slope) , developing lower local<br>
pressures with respect to the drops which fall into a<br>
crater.<br>
In the case of base materials, the low resistance ef-<br>
fected by the surface makes the removal of the material<br>
almost completely uniform along the whole area involved<br>
in the test.<br>
The unsatisfactory behaviour of most of the coatings of<br>
the known art can be explained by the reduced adhesion of<br>
the coating on the metallic substrate and the well known<br>
intrinsic fragility (due to the presence of chromium car-<br>
bides) .<br>
Vice versa, the coatings of the art which provide im-<br>
proved results are those consisting of tungsten carbides<br>
with a cobalt, chromium-cobalt matrix, depending on the<br>
use of the coating process.<br>
In general, the performances of the coatings with HVOF<br>
improve with an increase in the content of tungsten car-<br>
bide. The micrographic morphology of the 88WC-12Co coat-<br>
ing is, in fact, more homogeneous with respect to that of<br>
83WC-17Co. On the other hand, the difference in perform-<br>
ance of the same material (WC10Co-4Cr) , applied by means<br>
of SD-GunTM or HVOF is quite marked. The results of the<br>
former are encouraging, whereas those of the latter are<br>
unsatisfactory.<br><br>
This confirms that at present the spraying process has a<br>
significant importance in obtaining certain performances<br>
of the coating.<br>
The thermal treatment of the known art for increasing the<br>
hardness, however, has as yet shown a reduced increase in<br>
resistance to erosion due to an excessive fragility.<br>
It has been verified that in the case of coatings by<br>
means of thermal spraying, an important parameter for<br>
evaluating the resistance to erosion by liquids is the<br>
adhesion resistance. A low value immediately suggests<br>
that the coating is not appropriate. An additional requi-<br>
site for resistance to erosion is the good quality of the<br>
microstructure of the coating.<br>
At the moment, the necessity is consequently felt for<br>
having new types of coating or treatment for gas turbine<br>
components which are capable of effectively reducing the<br>
metallic erosion rate due to separation by impact with<br>
liquids.<br>
One of the general objectives of the present invention<br>
therefore consists in providing an alloy for the coating<br>
of vapour turbine components which is highly resistant to<br>
metallic erosion phenomena as a result of impact with<br>
liquids.<br>
A further objective of the invention consists in provid-<br>
ing a method for the treatment of the surfaces of metal-<br><br>
lie organs subject to erosion, in particular vapour tur-<br>
bine blades, which effectively increases the adhesion re-<br>
sistance of the coating applied.<br>
The last but not least important objective consists in<br>
providing an alloy and a method for the coating of vapour<br>
turbine blades which is simple to produce and does not<br>
involve high production costs.<br>
It has now been surprisingly found that it is possible to<br>
obtain a coating for vapour turbine components subject to<br>
erosion, by applying on the metallic surfaces of said<br>
components a cobalt-based alloy, having a composition<br>
which is particularly rich in tungsten and suitably se-<br>
lected.<br>
The alloy according to the invention is of the stellite<br>
or Haynes alloy type, referring to a material which be-<br>
longs to the group of non-ferrous hard alloys based on<br>
cobalt, chromium and tungsten, resistant to corrosion and<br>
wear.<br>
In particular, the applicant has now identified an alloy<br>
composition which is particularly suitable for the coat-<br>
ing of vapour turbine components, comprising:<br><br><br><br>
nickel 3-6% by weight<br>
molybdenum 1-3% by weight<br>
cobalt the complement to 100%.<br>
According to an embodiment, the alloy of the invention<br>
can also comprise iron 0-1% by weight, manganese 0-1% by<br>
weight and other elements in a quantity ranging from 0 to<br>
0.5% by weight.<br>
The alloy of the invention has an optimized selected<br>
chemical composition for enhancing the characteristics of<br>
anti-erosion by liquid when subjected to erosion phenom-<br>
ena such as, for example vapour turbine components.<br>
It has been verified that the alloy compositions of the<br>
invention advantageously supplied in powder form, allow<br>
the production of a layer of coating on vapour turbine<br>
components which is highly resistant to mechanical stress<br>
caused by impact with liquid particles.<br>
In particular, from specific tests it has been observed<br>
that the use of the alloy of the invention allows the<br>
production of coatings having a higher resistance to ero-<br>
sion from impact with liquids by an order of magnitude<br>
(for example 2,100,000 of impacts against 180,000 with<br>
traditional hardening materials) with respect to the re-<br>
sistance values of other materials used in the known art.<br>
It has also been observed that the application of the al-<br>
loy of the invention to the surface of turbine blades,<br><br>
causes an unexpectedly higher resistance to erosion with<br>
respect to the use of stellite compositions of the known<br>
type.<br>
The alloy of the invention has a selected quantity of<br>
various elements which determines the resistance proper-<br>
ties to corrosion by liquid when applied to the surfaces<br>
of turbine components.<br>
In particular, the carbon content in the composition is<br>
optimized and balanced to form carbides having a suitable<br>
stoichiometry, the chromium content and high tungsten and<br>
molybdenum contents are selected to obtain an improved<br>
reinforcement for a solid solution and to obtain maximum<br>
precipitation values of carbides having a suitable<br>
stoichiometry. Furthermore, the alloy composition of the<br>
invention has a high nickel content, preferably from 3.5<br>
to 5.5%, so as to increase the ductility of the alloy and<br>
resistance of the coating layer.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, a method is<br>
provided for the treatment of organs subject to erosion,<br>
in particular vapour turbine components, comprising the<br>
application of a cobalt-based alloy previously described<br>
to the surface of said organ or turbine component, to<br>
form an anti-erosion coating layer.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the application of<br>
the coating to organs subject to erosion, such as for ex-<br><br>
ample blades, rotor, stator, vapour turbine plates, is<br>
effected by means of laser plating, advantageously using<br>
a laser apparatus with CO2 or an Nd-Yag laser.<br>
An alloy of the invention is in fact suitable for use in<br>
laser plating which comprises one or more passages on the<br>
surfaces of metallic organs subject to erosion so as to<br>
form one or more layers of coating.<br>
According to an embodiment, the metallic material to be<br>
subjected to the anti-erosion treatment of the invention<br>
can be previously heated and then plated by means of la-<br>
ser cladding.<br>
The differences in the behaviour of a turbine component<br>
treated according to the method of the invention and<br>
metal components either non-plated or plated with prod-<br>
ucts of the known art are evident from the enclosed draw-<br>
ing in which:<br>
The figure illustrates a graph relating to comparative<br>
liquid erosion tests on 4 metal samples.<br>
In particular, the enclosed figure illustrates a graph<br>
which indicates in abscissa the number of impacts and in<br>
ordinate the volume loss following impact with liquid<br>
drops.<br>
The graph summarizes the results of erosion by liquid<br>
drops sprayed through a 0.13 mm nozzle on four test sam-<br>
ples made of martensite stainless steel, the same mate-<br><br>
rial but with martempering treatment (MT), integral stel-<br>
lite and stainless steel coated with a layer produced by<br>
laser plating of the alloy of the invention, according to<br>
Example 1.<br>
The graph indicates the increased resistance to erosion<br>
by liquid drops of the sample treated according to the<br>
invention with respect to the samples of the known art.<br>
Once the coating material, according to the present in-<br>
vention, has been applied to metallic surfaces of vapour<br>
turbine components, it has a high adhesion resistance.<br>
The high resistance properties of the coating produced<br>
with the method of the invention are also justified by<br>
its microstructural morphology.<br>
It has in fact been observed that the structure of the<br>
coating produced with the laser technique is extremely<br>
thin and the removal of the material, which essentially<br>
takes place by means of cracking along the carbide bonds,<br>
is reduced even after prolonged periods of turbine activ-<br>
ity.<br>
Furthermore, the coating alloy applied according to the<br>
method of the invention only tends to become detached,<br>
following prolonged and repeated stress, on a reduced<br>
portion of the sample whereas this phenomenon involves a<br>
much wider surface area when the coating is made with ma-<br>
terials of the known art.<br><br>
The application of the laser technology consequently<br>
makes it possible to produce coatings with a high resis-<br>
tance to erosion by separation due to impact with liq-<br>
uids, reducing alteration of the base material to the<br>
minimum. The use of the laser technology also allows<br>
stress reducing treatment to be effected at temperatures<br>
slightly lower than the recovery temperature, thus avoid-<br>
ing any possible negative effects on the tensile<br>
strength.<br>
The following examples are provided for the sole purpose<br>
of illustrating the present invention and should in no<br>
way be considered as limiting the protection scope ac-<br>
cording to the enclosed claims.<br><br>

mechanical vapour turbine components having the following<br>

layer having a thickness equal to about 1.2 mm.<br>
