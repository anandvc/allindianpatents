				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to<br>
telecommunications systems and, more specifically, to credit management<br>
of accounts in a multi service telecommunications environment, wherein<br>
services are provided in exchange for credits.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The take up of prepai d subscri pti ons for mobi1e telephony<br>
has far exceeded anyone's expectations. Now in the light of 3G and true<br>
multi-service mobile networks it is likely that prepaid will take an ever<br>
greater stance. The introduction of prepaid into the fixed wireline<br>
networks is also likely.<br>
Together with new technologies, the industry is<br>
experiencing consumer prices dropping to a level just above cost. The<br>
result of this is a significant increase in the level of service usage,<br>
e.g. the number of calls made.<br>
The introduction of family prepaid accounts, where the one<br>
prepaid account has many users (mother, father, son, etc.), will<br>
complicate matters even more.<br>
Moreover, the number of services offered is increasing<br>
rapidly, the number of users is still growing and the frequency and<br>
number of services accessed by each user is on the increase as wel 1.<br>
Since most of these services are charged, the requirements placed on<br>
credit management systems (which responsibility is the financial<br>
management of user accounts) are becoming more and more demanding.<br>
Multiple services need to be charged to one account, which can be<br>
accessed by multiple users at the same time.<br>
In order to reduce the load on the credit management<br>
system, each service capability server, e.g. a service control point<br>
(SCP) for telephony calls or a wireless application protocol (WAP)<br>
gateway is likely to make use of credit control protocols which<br>
effectively reserve chunks of credit for the sole use of that service.<br>
For example, during a WAP session the WAP gateway may reserve 10 euros<br>
from the credit management system.<br>
Credit reservation can also be a requirement for service<br>
deployment when the cost of the service cannot be determined based on a<br>
linear expression of time. For example, in charging for web access, where<br>
some web pages cost more than others, it is unknown how many pages will<br>
be accessed per minute and which pages will be accessed. Credit<br>
reservation ensures that services can be deployed with minimum delay.<br>
Given the present situation, where multiple services can be<br>
accessed at the same time by one or more users, accordingly multiple<br>
credit reservations are placed against the same account at the same time.<br>
It will be understood that a credit reservation differs<br>
from direct deduction of consumed credit from the account. Eventually, in<br>
the case of multiple credit reservations, a situation may occur where the<br>
credit management system shows a small amount of unreserved credits<br>
avai1abl e and a servi ce capabi1i ty server requests to reserve or deduct a<br>
number of credits exceeding that left over. In this case the service is<br>
denied while the user is informed of the fact that there are insufficient<br>
credits available for that service. In fact, however, there are<br>
sufficient credits available, but these are all reserved for usage by<br>
other services.<br>
Known solutions are either to have one server handling<br>
prepaid access for all services or alternatively not to allow credit to<br>
be reserved. However, the disadvantages of prior art is that neither<br>
option is suitable in a multi-service network.<br>
The use of one service capability server handling all<br>
services is not feasible from an architectural point of view when<br>
di scussi ng the 1arge number of servi ces avai 1 able for mobi1e and fi xed<br>
telephony and internet services.<br>
The ability for service capability servers to reserve<br>
credit improves service delivery to the end-user and ensures availability<br>
of the credit management system to other users and servers. Removing the<br>
credit reservation facility will create serious architectural and<br>
performance issues.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
system for and a method of handling credit reservations that reduce the<br>
amount of erroneous denials of service by service provisioning means to<br>
the user, whilst maintaining the benefits of the existing architectural<br>
design, i.e. performance due to credit reservation and multiple service<br>
capability servers.<br>
Another object the present invention, related to this, is<br>
improvement of quality of service, contributing to customer satisfaction.<br>
These and other objects and advantages of the present<br>
invention are provided by a method for credit management of an account in<br>
a multi service telecommunications system, wherein services are provided<br>
in exchange for units, wherein a predetermined amount of units is<br>
available for the account and which units are reserved before<br>
provisioning of a service, characterized in that a forced booking of<br>
actually consumed units can be carried out.<br>
By carrying out forced booking of consumed credits the<br>
credi t management system can send a message to al1 servi ce capabi1i ty<br>
servers connected to an account, force them to book all the consumed<br>
credits and release the remaining credits. This ensures that the total<br>
balance in the account is up to date at the moment the forced booking has<br>
taken place. A forced booking could possibly take place as soon as the<br>
amount of credits in the account drops below a certain threshold.<br>
If, following upon a forced booking, a forced credit<br>
accreditation request is being demanded by the credit management system,<br>
the servi ce capabi1i ty servers are i nformed of the avai1abi1i ty of<br>
credits in the account and will place requests for credit at the credit<br>
management system. The credit management system will receive all<br>
outstanding requests and will start an accreditation procedure.<br>
During the accreditation procedure the credit management<br>
system will be enabled to optimise distribution of available credits by<br>
using accreditation rules to evaluate the requests. For example, these<br>
accreditation rules can be based on history information like actual<br>
consumption of credits per unit of time, a classification of services<br>
(prioritization), the amount of credits requested, the life-span of the<br>
request (for how long is will the requested amount be reserved) or any<br>
other desired parameter for optimisation.<br>
By analysing these and other factors an appropriate amount<br>
can be accredited to the service capability server, the main principle<br>
being that upon accreditation each server is provided less credits than<br>
previously held before the forced booking. It is thus less likely that<br>
service will inappropriately be refused due to lack of funds, in case a<br>
small amount of credits is remaining in the account. As the credit<br>
balance approaches zero, various services (using a service<br>
classification) can be refused credit if multiple services are active at<br>
the same time.<br>
The advantages of using this method are numerous. The<br>
number of incorrect denials of service will be reduced substantially,<br>
improving the quality of service to the user. Of course this will result<br>
in improved customer satisfaction. Still, the performance benefits of<br>
credit reservation are maintained by allowing these reservations. In<br>
addition, the requirement of multiple service capability servers is met<br>
as wel1.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, a forced booking can be<br>
carried out by credit management, in order to force service provisioning<br>
means to book all consumed credits and release their reservations. This<br>
will enable credit management to update balance information of the<br>
account in order to rule out the possibility of providing incorrect<br>
information to the customer and thus avoid denial of service where<br>
inapplicable.<br>
If this forced booking would be performed only in case the<br>
amount of credits drops below a predetermined threshold, the performance<br>
of a credit management means would not be disturbed too much.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention the forced booking<br>
could be made service dependent, for instance only the services with<br>
large outstanding credit reservations are forced to book their consumed<br>
credits. This approach could as well improve performance of the invention<br>
as i t reduces the amount of booki ngs to be handl ed and does not requi re<br>
attention from all service provisioning means.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the forced booking can be<br>
followed up by a request from the credit management means to the service<br>
provisioning means to place new accreditation requests for credit. This<br>
will avoid interference with the service provisioning processes as the<br>
service provisioning means will be able to build up a credit reserve<br>
again.<br>
In addition, accreditation of these requests can be done<br>
according to accreditation rules that enable credit management to<br>
determine the most optimal distribution of credits amongst the service<br>
provisioning means.<br>
These rules could be dependent on any parameter that<br>
requires optimisation, which of is an inexhaustible list dependent on the<br>
requirements of the telecommunications system as a whole. A number of<br>
possibilities is provided here as an example:<br>
rate of credit consumption of a service,<br>
classification, for instance a prioritization, of<br>
services,<br>
requested amount of credits,<br>
life span of the request (is the amount requested for 1<br>
minute or 10 minutes).<br>
It will be appreciated that, in an embodiment of the<br>
invention, said credits are monetary units, units of time, units of<br>
volume, for instance data volume of data transmitted through a network or<br>
maybe dependent on the amount of used bandwidth by the user of the<br>
account.<br>
The account could in another embodiment of the invention be<br>
accessed by multiple users, if desired, at the same time.<br>
The services could be related to a group which comprises<br>
voice, data and internet communications. Specific examples of said<br>
services are voice telephony, email, WAP, facsimile services, multimedia<br>
services, etc.<br>
The invention could in an alternative embodiment be used in<br>
a telecommunications network which can be accessed by users via both<br>
fixed and wireless connections.<br>
Said telecommunication system, in an embodiment of the<br>
invention, could comprise a plurality of service provisioning systems, in<br>
communicative connection to said credit management.<br>
Specifically, the invention could be part of a multi<br>
service telecommunications system, wherein services are provided in<br>
exchange for units, wherein a predetermined amount of units is available<br>
for the account and which units are reserved before provisioning of a<br>
service, wherein the credit of available units for the account is being<br>
registered or managed by at least one credit management system.<br>
Credit management of the invention could be a system or<br>
even a part of a system that is part of the telecommunications system as<br>
a whole. Of course alternatively, credit management can be performed at<br>
the user's premises, in the equipment used to access the network, or any<br>
other device in communicative connection with said telecommunications<br>
system.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>

FIGURE 2 shows a process flow diagram of the forced booking<br>
method according to the invention.<br>
Detailed Description of the Embodiments<br>
Figure 1 shows a multi service telecommunications network<br>
1, which comprises a network (comprising a set of exchanges, routers and<br>
other equipment physically connected with each other) a plurality of<br>
service provisioning gateways 3-7, a credit management system 8, an<br>
exchange enabling access to the network, a base station 12 required to<br>
establish a wireless connection between mobile communications means 11<br>
and exchange 9, fixed communications means 10 and a personal computer<br>
system 13. The credit management system 8, here connected to exchange 9,<br>
could be connected directly to or part of the communications means 10-11<br>
and 13, base station 12, any of the service gateways 3-7 or any other<br>
device in the network. In this figure the alternative connections for 8<br>
are shown as dotted lines.<br>
Suppose a single account can be accessed by any of the<br>
means 10, 11 and 13 at any time and any of these means 10, 11 and 13 can<br>
make use of any of the services 3-7 at the same time. When mobile<br>
communications means 11 accesses the network through base station 12 and<br>
requests any of the services 3-7, for instance WAP 5, the service gateway<br>
5 submits a credit reservation request at the credit management system 8<br>
which determines whether the amount of credits is sufficient to accept<br>
the reservation. If, for instance, the reservation is accepted, the<br>
credit management system 8 notifies the WAP gateway 5 of the acceptance<br>
and the gateway provides service to the user at mobile communications<br>
means 11.<br>
If, following upon WAP service provisioning to mobile<br>
communications means 11, personal computer system 13 requests e-mail<br>
services 6 while mobile user 11 is still using WAP (and maybe more<br>
services are requested by any of the users at 10, 11 and 13 at the same<br>
time), the credit management system 8 might discover there are<br>
insufficient credits still available for reservation. Credit management<br>
system 8 will force booking of all consumed credits and at the same time<br>
release all outstanding reservations, upon which the credit management<br>
system 13 updates the account balance information. The credit management<br>
system 8 will then request each of service gateways 3-7 to submit new<br>
credit accreditation requests (reservations) after which, upon receiving<br>
of the requests, the credit management system will evaluate all the<br>
requests using a set of accreditation rules.<br>
The set of rules used to evaluate all requests and to<br>
accredit amounts of credit to service gateways 3-7, can be based on a<br>
inexhaustible number of desirable parameters to optimise. For example,<br>
the rules can be based on history information like credit consumption<br>
rate, a classification of services like a prioritization of services<br>
(voice could be more important to a user than WAP), the amount of credits<br>
requested, the life-span of the request (for how long is will the<br>
requested amount be reserved) or any other parameter.<br>
With these rules, the credit management system 8 can decide<br>
upon the most optimal distribution of credits amongst the service<br>
gateways 3-7. The service gateways will then provide service to the user<br>
(or deny service in case the account is empty). The user wi11 not<br>
experience denial of service unless his/her balance really is<br>
insufficient.<br>
Figure 2 shows a typical process flow chart of the method<br>
according to the invention. As it is a communications protocol between<br>
service provisioning means 15 and credit management means 16, the<br>
flowchart shows where the events are happening on either sides of the<br>
dotted line.<br>
The process starts with any service provisioning means 15<br>
placing a credit request (reservation) 17 at credit management system 16.<br>
The credit management system 16, upon receiving the request, checks the<br>
balance of the account in step 18 and in case the balance check is<br>
positive the reservation is accepted 19 and service is provided 20. In<br>
case the balance check 18 shows a negative result, the credit management<br>
system carries out a forced booking 21a of all consumed credits, the<br>
service provisioning means 16 will book all consumed credits and release<br>
outstanding reservations in step 21b. The credit management system 16<br>
then forces all service provisioning means 16 to submit their new credit<br>
accreditation requests in step 22, which requests are placed in step 23.<br>
After receiving these requests, the credit management system 16 will in<br>
step 24 evaluate all requests making use of a set of accreditation rules.<br>
These rules are dependent on and determined by the parameters that are<br>
desired to optimise distribution of credits 25 for. When all credit<br>
amounts are determined the credit management system 16 will distribute 25<br>
the amounts amongst service provisioning means 15 which will on their<br>
turn provide service to the user in terminal step 26.<br>
It will be appreciated that numerous modifications and<br>
variations of the present invention are possible in the light of the<br>
above teachings. It is therefore understood that within the scope of the<br>
