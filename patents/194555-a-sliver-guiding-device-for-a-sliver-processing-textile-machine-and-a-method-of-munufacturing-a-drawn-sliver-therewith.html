				<td>The present invention relates  to a sliver-guiaing device for s   sliver-processing textile machine and a method of manufacturing a  drawn sliver therewith.<br>
The technical field of the invention is textile machines. In this field a drawing frame is encountered in panicular which is provided with a calender device which comprises at least two opposmg calender rollers or calender discs by means of which the sliver is con¬densed. The invention relates to the sliver guidance and to the guide nozzles which set this guidance.<br>
It is customary in the prior art for a pair of delivery rollers, which convey fibre fleece into a fleece funnel, to be arranged at the outlet of a drawing unit of a drawing frame (for example, a sliver-processing machine). Immediately downstream of the pair of delivery rollers the sliver is widened as a result of the drafting so as to correspond to the roller width. The person skilled in the art refers to the sliver widened at this point as a fibre fleece. The fibre fleece, i.e. the widened sliver, is conveyed into the opening of a fleece fuimel. The fibre fleece is rolled m and combined in the fleece fimnel and is passed through the mouth of the fimnel to a sliver tube of considerable length. At the end of the sliver tube the sliver is introduced into a sliver ftmnel which deflects the conveying direction of the sliver by about 90° and inserts it between a pair of calender rollers. After it has passed through the pair of calender rollers the sliver which has been condensed there is passed to the deposirion device of the drawing frame. An example of this is shown in the left-hand half of Fig. 1, in which case the sliver mbe is designated 8 and the delivery rollers of the drawing frame are designated 70b and 70a.<br>
A design with a long sliver tube 8 is likewise described in EP 593 884 Al. Another example of a long sUver tube (also designated 8 therein) is US 4,372,010; the pair of calender rollers are designated 9a, 9b therein.<br>
A further example of the customary nature of a long sliver tube is disclosed in DE-A 26 23 400. There die sliver tube itself is curved through an angle of about 90° and it guides the sliver without a change in the angle between the calender discs therein designated 5, 6. It is described as being advantageous if the tube designated 14 is flattened into an oval shape (cf. p. 9, last paragraph).<br>
Finally, a collecting tube is also disclosed in the East German Specification 290 697. There the fleece funnel and the sliver fimnel are spaced apart by an appreciable distance. An aerating opening (ref 8) allows the air flowing in at the beginning of the collecting tube (ref 5) to escape completely appreciably upstream of the narrowest point of the sliver funnel.<br><br>
The German Patent 36 12 133 relates to a sliver-guiding duct between the delivery rollers and the calender rollers on a spinning-preparation machine. The sliver-guiding duct relates to the automatic insertion of the leading end of a sliver into a sliver funnel (column 1, lines 9 to 10). The sliver-guiding duct is relatively long and provides the sliver with the necessary guidance on the path to the sliver funnel. A plurality of injectors {air duct, com¬pressed-air line) are arranged on this path. The entire mass of the sliver is drawn m the sliver-guiding duct by means of injectors. The mass of the beginning of the sliver must then be compressed exclusively in the sliver funnel (column 1, lines 54 to 58).<br>
The problem of the build-up of air in the sliver funnel (column 1, lines 59 to 62) exists in this arrangement. In order to overcome this problem, the sliver tunnel must have a device for briefly increasing its cross-section. This is the pre-condition of automatic insertion of the sliver.<br>
A further disadvantage is that, in order to insert the leading end of the sliver automati¬cally, the calender rollers must additionally be opened. During the rotation of the closed calender rollers the leading end of the sliver cannot be drawn into the clamping gap of the calender rollers.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a sliver guiding device for a sliver-processing textile machine, in particular arranged between the delivery roller and the calender of a drawing frame, in which, a plurality of nozzle inserts are joined together in the conveying direction of the sliver; the nozzle axis has two axial portions displaceable towards one another at an angle, and a pivot axis extending transversely through the sliver-guiding duct.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides a method of manufacturing a drawn sliver by operating a device, such as herein above described, in which, a first portion of a guide axis for a fleece feed is pivoted automatically with respect to a second portion if the nozzle which rolls in and joins together the fleece and which is arranged downstream of the delivery rollers discharges less fleece than is conveyed thereto; the pivoting takes place about a pivot axis which extends transversely through the fleece-guiding duct; a ramp area is pivoted by the pivoting of the nozzle upstream of the outlet of the delivery rollers, against which the fibre fleece (initially) being passed on abuts, in order to be deflected laterally out of the normal-operational conveying direction of the fleece.<br><br>
The object of the invention is to reduce the stoppage times of textile machines caused by build-up of fleece.<br>
To this end it is proposed (Claims 1, 16, 21) that a pivot axis V should extend trans¬versely through the sliver-guiding duct, in order to pivot one (Claims 5, 6, 16) of a plurality of nozzle inserts on this axis if a build-up of fleece occurs in the said nozzle insert (claim 16).<br>
The arrangement of the pivot axis makes it possible, when the fleece can no longer be removed, for the pressure of the build-up of the supplied fleece to pivot the first nozzle forming the fleece funnel out of its operating position in order to pivot a ramp portion of the said nozzle into the operating supply duct, which in the pivoted-in position has an inclination-such that the (initially further conveyed) fleece encountering it is deflected out of the interior of the drawing unit transversely to the normal conveying direction (Claims 10, U).<br>
The arrangement of the pivot axis results in a very small lever arm on which the fleece fed into the fleece funnel acts, so as to require only slight forces for pivoting the fleece funnel. In the event of a build-up of fleece, the fleece funnel swings out particularly easily when the pivot axis is situated below the fleece funnel (Claim 22) and the kink K in the axis is situated in the pivot axis (Claim 9).<br>
The fleece funnel can be made removable (Claim 15) in all its operational positions, and in particular in the pivoting position, which corresponds both to the attachment position for threading in the fleece and to the build-up position of the fleece (Claim 14).<br><br>
The attachment position or the build-up position of the fleece can be cushioned (Claims 12, 13) in order to achieve a soft impact in the case of automatic pivoting.<br>
The cushioned pivotability can also be used manually for performing servicing or cleaning operations. For this purpose a corresponding gripping and actuating portion on the pivotable nozzle is made easily accessible.<br>
The pivotable nozzle (fleece funnel) comprises a funnel area (Claim 16) and a ramp or planar area arranged adjacent thereto, so that the fibre fleece is shaped by rolling-in, deflecting and joining to form the sliver in the operating position of the said nozzle, and when the nozzle is tilted the ramp area ensures that the fibre fleece supplied thereto is deflected in such a way that it is discarded from the deflecting area, does not block the area of the drawing unit and can easily be removed by the operator (Claim 20).<br>
The ramp area also ensures that no build-up of fleece can occur, since the nozzle is then pivoted automatically by the force of the fibre fleece conveyed thereto and the ramp area moves the continuously supplied fibre fleece away out of the interior of the drawing unit until the delivery rollers are switched off. In this case this nozzle has at the same time come to occupy its attachment position, which corresponds to the position which it occupies when a build-up of fleece occurs.<br>
The pivotable, rectangular nozzle (Claim 17) can be pivotably mounted in the sliver-fimnel nozzle (of a cylindrical ftmnel-shaped nozzle) by way of the insert. The pivotable nozzle can also, however, be mounted pivotably on the aforesaid calender guide portion together with a nozzle portion directly attached thereto and constructed as a sliver funnel iff. Fig. 9a, Fig. 8a),<br>
In addition, the device which is free from long stoppage periods is constructed in a compact manner (Claim 4). Despite the ability to pivot the an- guidance is not reduced in its effectiveness (Claim 2).<br>
The compact design begins immediately behind the last delivery roller with a distinct change in path (Claim 6) before the entry into a guide duct. The additional deflecting roller, the axis of which is situated slightly above the normal fibre movement (without a deflecting roller) and substantially in one plane with the pivot axis V and the calender gap, can ensure deflecting of more than 50°, without adversely affecting the drawn quality of the fibres.<br>
The ramp plane of the fleece fimnel is determined in accordance with Claim 18, depending upon the unpact angles α1, α2 or αA, αA.<br>
In order to permit easy swinging-out, the fleece fimnel is situated at an appreciable distance from the sliver funnel by spaced bearing plates (Claim 19) relative to the overall length of the fibre guide and is nevertheless simated close thereto.<br>
Embodiments of the invention are intended to broaden and deepen the understanding thereof. In the drawing<br><br>
Fig. 1 shows, superimposed, a conventional arrangement of a sliver guide with a long sliver tube and a design with assembled nozzle mserts 30, 40, 50, 60, of which two nozzle inserts 40, 50 are tillable about an axis V with respect to the other two nozzle inserts 30, 60 which are mounted on a nozzle holder 20 fixed above the calender discs 100a, 100b. The superimposed drawing serves to illustrate the reduction in length of the conveying path of sliver.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates once more, selected from EP 593 884, the sliver guide of the prior art with a long sliver tube 8, a sliver funnel 9 and calender discs 100a, 100b. The fleece funnel is designated 1 in Fig. 2 and the delivery rollers of the drawing frame are designated 70a, 70b.<br>
Figs. 2a and 2b show the two pivoting positions αA, αA of the nested nozzles of the entire nozzle insert as an embodiment of the invention.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a prepared leading end of a fibre fleece for insertion into a fleece funnel 50.<br>
Figs. 3a and 3b show the two tilting positions for the insertion of the fibre fleece (build-up position) and during the operation of the draw frame.<br>
Figs. 4a and 4b show a fleece funnel 50 with a sliver-fixnnel portion 30 mounted directly thereon, which are jointly pivotable with respect to a calender-guide portion 61'.<br>
Figs. 5a, 5b, 5c and 5d show the sliver funnel 30 for use in a holder 60 as shown in Fig. 6.<br>
Figs. 6a, 6b and 6c show the holder 60 arranged as a lipped funnel for the sliver<br>
funnel 30,	:<br>
Fig. 7 is a diagrammatic plan view of the clamping gap 100c which is formed by the pair of calender discs 100a, lOOb. The air ducts 65a, 65b are bounded on the outside by the lips 61a, 61b which are arranged at the front end of the sliver funnel 60. This view is shown in detail in Fig. 6c, but without calender discs.<br>
Figs. 7a and 7b show m greater detail the clamping gap illustrated diagrammatically in Fig. 7, in one case closed lOOc and in the other case opened lOOd, by moving away one calender disc 100b with respect to the other.<br>
Figs. 8a and 8b show an embodiment which is comparable with Figs. 3a, 3b and in which the pivoting area has at the same rime the kink K in the guide axis 200a, 200b of the sliver guide. A calender guide portion remains as a fixed portion 61' below the kink K in the axis. Opposite it all the operational members of the nozzle ~ even the sliver funnel area - between the delivery rollers 71, 70a, 70b and the calender discs 100a, 100b are<br><br>
pivotable. The area above the portion 61' is constructed in one piece, as an insert 40, 30 in the fleece funnel 50, and surrounded by a cylindrical holder 80.<br>
Figs. 9a and 9b show the fleece funnel 50 with the tilting joint 5Dc on the stationary holder 20, in which the sliver funnel 60, 30 is releasably held. The front end 41 of the upper insert 40 is mounted pivotably in the lower insert 30 of the sliver funnel 60, for which purpose two articulation faces are used, which cooperate in a radially air-tight manner in the operating position.<br>
The superimposition in Fig. 1 illustrates the difference between the invention and the prior art, which is shown diagrammatically in Fig. 2. In the case of the prior art the undrawn sliver FV in the drawing unit during the insertion is inserted into a fleece funnel by way of drawing rollers 68a, 68b, 69a, 69b and delivery rollers 70a, 70b and from there into a long guide tube 8 which opens into a sliver fimnel 9. The sliver funnel deflects the sliver FB by substantially 90° into the clamping gap of the calender with its calender discs 100a, 100b. Reference is made below to calender discs or a pair of calender discs. This term also covers the pair of calender rollers. This is possible since, as compared with a pair of calender discs, a pair of calender rollers does not constitute a restriction of the in¬vention.<br>
The calendered sliver KF emerges vertically downwards from the calender and arrives at a deposition device and is deposited there (by means of turntables, not shown) In a can. This guidance of the sliver is also illustrated in Fig. 2 with the same reference numerals.<br>
An embodiment of the invention shortens the sliver path and dispenses with the sliver tube 8. A fiirther deflecting roller 71 is added, which causes a deflection of substantially 60° of the conveying direction FV of the fleece and introduces the fibre fleece into a sliver duct comprising a plurality of operational members.<br>
The first member is the fleece funnel 50 with a ramp face 50b and a fimnel portion 50a which is arranged directly thereon and in which the fibre fleece arriving in a wide state is folded, turned over and inserted into a first portion of the duct. The portion of the duct is formed by an insert 40 which is inserted on the rear side of the portion 50a of the fleece funnel 50 and is secured with a screw. It can be adjusted.<br>
The fleece funnel 50 (with an inner insert) can be tilted by a handle portion 51 in such a way that the ramp face 50b can be pivoted into the sliver guide and the funnel portion 50a can be pivoted next to it.<br>
At the front end of the insert 40 an articulation face 41a, 41b is provided, which, in the angular position αA shown in Fig. 1 or Fig. 2b, allows the guide duct to be sealed off<br>
fi-om the following sliver funnel 30.<br>
The articulation face 41a, 41b - symmetrical to the median plane of the first insert 40 - of the front cylindrical portion of the inner insert 40 comprises two continuously curved portions 41a and 41b which become narrow towards the rear (in the axial direction) and<br><br>
which engage in a corresponding bearing face 35 on the sliver funnel 30. Figs. 4a and 4b show the said articulalion face in two views at the front end of the insert 40 for the fleece funnel 50. Pivoting the fleece funnel 50 in the direction a into the other angular position αA does not break the radially air-tight seal between the fleece funnel and the sliver funnel. Radially air-tight guidance of the sliver is made possible both m the pivoted-in (ag) and in the pivoted-out (αA) state.<br>
If the fleece fiinnel 50 is constructed in two parts- with an insert 40 which can be inserted contrary to the conveying direction of the flbres - the aforesaid relative setting can be performed with a handle 51.<br>
The sliver is conveyed into the guide duct as far as the clamping gap 100c by the fleece nozzle 50, the inner insert 40 and the sliver funnel 30, for which purpose the fleece iuimel 50 is pivoted outwards. The portion Fl of fibre fleece narrowed by hand as shown in Fig. 3 and held in the mouth 50a of the funnel is sucked in by way of injector bores 34a, 34b, 64a, 64b in the sliver funnel. A brief suction flow in the cylindrical duct 31 in the order of magnitude of 500 ms in duration is sufficient. It is produced by a very brief supply of compressed air to the injector bores 34a and 34b, m order to convey the narrowed portion Fl of fibre fleece in front of the clamping gap 100c, since the articulation face 35 and the bearing faces 41a, 41b of the inner insert 40 are closed in a radially air-tight manner. Mechanical aids for insertion are not required.<br>
In order to convey the portion Fl of fibre fleece and with it the entire width F of the now shaped sliver through the clamping gap, a brief rotational pulse of the duration T2 is<br>
given to the calender discs.  It can switch on automatically after a pre-deiermined suction period T^, it can. be superimposed thereon or it can be performed separately by hand.<br>
The shape of the sliver funnel 30 may be seen more clearly in Fig. 5a, 5b and 5c, where the direction and arrangement of the injector bores 34a, 34b in the sliver funnel are shown enlarged. They open into a cylindrical duct 31 which forms the front end of the sliver duct. The cylindrical portion 31 widens by way of a tapered portion 32a to the diameter of the duct 32 which is pre-set by the inner insert 40. The bearing face 35, which corresponds in its curvature to the articulation face 41a, 41b, is provided at the upper end of the taper 32a.<br>
The two inclined mjeclor bores 34a, 34b can extend at an angle of about 45° with respect to the axis 200b of the sUver-funnel insert 30. Advantageously they can be offset in parallel, openmg in a common plane in the cylindrical portion 31, in order to impart a twist and further strength to the inserted sliver in addition to the injector effect. This arrangement is shown in Fig. 5d. The injector bores start above a cylindrical portion 33 of the insert 30 in an annular duct 36 open towards the outside.<br>
In the upper, substantially cylindrical portion 67, as shown in Figs. 6a, 6b, 6c, the sliver-funnel holder 60 has a central, substantially cylindrical opening 62 into which the<br><br>
sliver-funnel insert 30 is inserted. An annular duct 33, which can be supplied with com¬pressed air by two or more cylindrical bores 64a, 64b, extends in the peripheral direction and opens towards the inside in the cylindrical opening. Starting trom the annular duct, the compressed air introduced from the outside is fed mto the inclined mjector bores 34a, 34b when the sliver-funnel insert 30 is inserted, in order to open into the cylindrical portion 31 of the sliver duct which is situated closely adjacent the clamping gap 100c. When changing the parts, the exchangeability of the inserts 30, 40 allows a rapid change¬over to altered widths of the duct as a result of different sliver material.<br>
Figs. 6a and 6b show the cylindrical lip 61 of the sliver-funnel holder 60 which adjoins a tapered portion 68 fonning the transition between the upper cylindrical end 67 and the Up 61, It has a length L and a diameter designated as the width b in the cross-section of Fig. 6b. The lip 61 is arranged fixed and is in two halves, since it is slotted laterally as shown in Fig. 6c. A segment of the rotating calender discs 100a, 100b engages in the two aforesaid slots, as shown in the diagrammatic illustration of Fig. 7. This is also clear from the right-hand half of Fig. 1. The clamping gap comes to be situated in the middle of the lip of the sliver-funnel holder 60, i.e. in the axis 200b of the fleece guide. As shown in Figs. 7a and 7b the clamping gap can be both closed (clamping gap lOOc) and opened by moving away one calender disc 100b (clamping gap lOOd opened).<br>
The integrally attached lip halves 61a, 61b, which are formed by the aforesaid slots 61c, 61d in the cylmdrical lip 61, guide the guiding air past the clamping gap 100c or 1 OOd. The guiding air has previously been introduced into the annular duct 63 by way of the injector bores 64a, 64b and from the said annular duct 63 into the sliver duct by way of the injector bores 34a, 34b of the sliver funnel 30 extending obliquely to the axis 200b. The lips prevent the guiding air from escaping in front of the gap 100c, lOOd, but rather it is guided beyond the gap to behind the clamping gap. In order to guide this air. use is made of a first narrow duct portion 65a on one side of the calender discs or a second narrow duct portion 65b on the other side of the calender discs, which have a substantially semicircular cross-sectional shape. The respective duct is made very narrow as compared with tKe thickness d or width b of the lip 61 or the inner wall thereof which is directly adjacent the lateral face of the calender disc.<br>
As a result of the lateral air guidance beyond the calender gap by means of the Up halves 61a, 61b having a length L which corresponds substantially to half the diameter of the calaider discs m tiie embodiment, the width b of the lip and tiie covering d of the inside of the lip halves opposite the calender discs have a sealing effect which is produced without contact by lateral flow resistance ranging from perceptible to considerable in magnitude with respect to the axial lateral air ducts 65a, 65b.<br><br>
Even if no contact is necessary between the lip halves 61a, 61b (the insides of the lip halves) and the rotating calender discs, an air guidance substantially only in the axial direction past the calender gap nevertheless becomes possible.<br>
Only in the case where the calender gap 1 OOd is opened, as shown in Fig. 7b, is the air conveyed not only past the calender gap, but also to an appreciable degree through the calender gap. The sliver is also immediately threaded in through the calender gap by the guiding air and the calender disc 100b can then be brought up (closed position), so as to have reached the operating position with the sliver threaded in. In this case too, where the calender gap is opened, the sealing area (part of the covering d) is sufficiently large relative to the air resistance of the now enlarged through duct comprising the duct segments 65a, 65b and the opened calender gap lOOd, to prevent the guiding air from escaping radially.<br>
Figs. 8a and 8b show an embodiment of the guide portion which is made substantially in one piece and contains both the fleece nozzle 50 and the sliver funnel 30. In this case the sliver funnel 30 is inserted directly into the fleece nozzle 50 and is additionally fixed in position by a tubular holder 80. The front end of the sliver funnel 30 is mounted in complementary bearing shells and rounded faces, as described with reference to Figs. 4b and 4c for the fleece-fimnel insen 40.<br>
The radial sealing is also achieved in the case of Figs. 8a and 8b, in which a residual guide portion 61' is arranged fixed with respect to the calender discs, for example on the holder 20 as shown in Fig. 9a. The residual guide portion 61' corresponds to the lip area L of the sliver-funnel holder 60 of Fig. 6a. In this embodiment the air is introduced into the front end of the combined fleece funnel and sliver funnel by way of obliquely orientated injector bores 34a, 34b, in which case a pivoting movement produces a slight pivoting of the air-introduction area, this pivoting, however, bemg only slight on account of its proximity to the pivot point K.<br>
The two pivoting positions in Figs. 8a and 8b are designated a, and α2; they corre¬spond to the pivoting positions αA and αA, but they can have slightly different dimensions since the pivotable part is larger or longer in Figs. 8a and 8b than in Figs. 3a and 3b.<br>
The sliver-guiding portions are defined by different bores and corresponding tapered transition portions in the insert 40, which at the same time form the fleece-funnel insert and the sliver funnel 30. Exchanging the insert 40 at the same time constitutes an exchange of the sliver funnel 30. Re-adjustment or balancing operations can be dispensed with as a result of the one-piece design.<br>
The annular holding means does not rest quite flush against the combined fleece furmel and sliver funnel, but leaves an annular space 81 between the inside of the funnel and the external diameter of the substantially cylindrical combined funnel 30/40. The atmular space 81 guides the compressed air introduced into the fibre guide, it being sealed<br><br>
at the front end by flush (annular) abutment against the combined nozzle - below the injector bores 34a, 34b. A main air supply, which is guided outwards and which opens into the annular space 81, is situated at a suitable level which can be selected in accordance with the purpose of use, and the said air supply can accumulate compressed air in the annular space 81 and feeds the injector bores 34a, 34b.<br>
In this example the injector bores are also appreciably mclined with respect to the axis 200a, they open at the kinlc pomt K directly in front of the articulation sealed in a radially air-tight manner, a radial air-tight mounting taking place at the said kink point K in the two positions of Fig. 8 and Fig. 8b.<br>
The angles a, and Α2 are each slightly reduced as compared with the example of<br>
Figs. 2a and 2b, but in the same indicated area, as in the Figs. 2. In this embodiment the exact angle for α2 amounts to about 5° and for a, about 25° (± 10%), whereas in Fig. 2a an angle αA of about 30" and in Fig. 2b an angle of about 1° (± 10%) have worked reliably in experiments.<br>
The planar area 50b in Figs. 8a and 8b is accordingly adapted to the angle of the ramp area 50b in Figs, 2a and 2b. It is linked with the angles a in the respective end positions of pivoting, in which case the pivoting position α1 and αA pre-supposes an angle of the<br>
ramp such that the conveying direction of the fibre fleece FV is orientated appreciably transversely out of the outlet area of the drawing frame. In this case it is most advan¬tageous when the transverse direction of FV comprises a slight downward component, i.e. is inclined slightly downwardly with respect to the horizontal.<br>
For this purpose the ramp area either has a slight mclination of from 1° to 2° with respect to the funnel area or is made slightly tapered.<br>
Two different dimensions of the guide duct, a narrow one and a wide one, and each with a tapered offset to the narrowest cylindrical duct portion, are shown in the combined funnel 30/40 in Figs. 8a and 8b.<br>
Figs 9a and 9b are lateral and plan views resectively of the fleece funnel 50 with its ramp area 50b and its funnel area 50a as shown in Fig. 3. The pivot axis V is situated transversely to the guide axis 200a, 200b and extends through the air-tight articulation 41a, 41b and 35, as indicated in Figs. 4 and 5. At the same time the pivot axis V extends through the bearings 50c which are formed by lateral holdmg plates 52a, 52b and pins on which pivoting receptacles at least half open at the front can be placed. The fleece funnel 50 can thus be removed and tilted, at the same time remaining as an air-tight sealing of the guide duct 200a, 200b formed on the inside.<br>
Figs. 9a and 9b show the pivotable fleece nozzle 50 with the ramp portion 50b and the funnel area 50a. The pivot axis V is indicated and is defmed by a joint which is shown diagrammatically on the right next to Fig. 9b. A bearing tongue 52a (on the opposite side 52b) has a substantialiy semicircular recess which is open at the bottom and which is<br><br>
 placed on a pin 50c in order to form a joint. Because of the smooth transitions at the opening end of the recess 53a (on the opposite end 53b) the fleece funnel 50 can easily be removed and can be put on again. This is indicated by the direction of the arrow F. At the same time the fleece funnel 50 is pivotable about the angle o, the pivoting either being performed by an operator moving a handle 51 or being produced by a fleece build-up and the resulting build-up pressure above the pivot axis V, in which case the ramp area 50b is pivoted in the conveying direction of FV.<br>
The width of the ramp area 50b is e and is substantially as wide as the inlet area of the fuimel portion 50a. It can be made slightly tapered and it can be inclined at an atigle , with respect to a plane E, which is orientated at right angles to the axis 200a of the sliver duct (cf. Fig. 3b). The inclination , is adapted to the pivoting angle αA which is set as the end position (attachment setting) when the fleece funnel is pivoted out. In this case the conveying direction FV' of the fleece should extend at about 90° from the area of the drawing unit. Accordingly, in practical use an angle of about 30° (20° to 40°) will be selected.<br>
The inlet area of the funnel portion 50a has an angle 2 slightly reduced with respect to the angle 1. The difference between these two angles S amounts to between 1° and 5°.<br>
With one embodiment of the fleece funnel an improved, i. e. constant, rolling-in of the fleece is achieved during the insertion of the sliver into the guide portion.<br>
At the same time the machine is safeguarded from stoppage periods in such a way that the fleece funnel itself is pivoted out and guides the further movement of the sliver into the external space of the machine, where the sliver which is no longer properly drawn can be easily removed.<br>
The operating times are shortened and simplified. In addition to the build-up position, the ramp 50b of the fleece funnel also makes the attachment position possible, without an operator first having to unthread sliver from the area of the drawing unit. This is performed automatically.<br>
In conjimction with the release of the upper roller during the coil formation the fleece-nozzle ramp 50b closes the possible free space for uncontrolled conveying of fibre-fleece and therefore the coil formation. The machine can be monitored electrically.<br><br><br>
