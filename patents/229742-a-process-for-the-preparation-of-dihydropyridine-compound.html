COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br>
4. DESCRIPTION<br>
(Description starts from next page)<br><br><br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The present invention discloses an improved and cost effective synthesis of (E) t-butyl-2-formylcinnamate and its conversion to dihydropyridine compound such as lacidipine.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Lacidipine is a second-generation calcium channel antagonist that reduces the transmembrane influx of calcium ions, blocking the type L voltage-dependent channels. Lacidipine is one of the most vascular selective dihydropyridine derivatives. It has a long duration of action because of its high degree of lipophilicity, its storage in the deep lipid compartment of the membrane and its continuous release to receptor. Anti-hypertensive effect apart, Lacidipine has also been shown to have anti-atherosclerotic, antioxidant, platelet anti-aggregant &amp; blockade of endothelin-1 induced vasoconstriction effects.<br>
Lacidipine is also known as (E)-4-[2-[3-(l,l-dimethylethoxy)-3-oxo-l-propenyl] phenyl]-l,4-dihydro-2, 6-dimethyl-3, 5-pyridine dicarboxylic acid diethyl ester and has a CAS Reg. No. 103890-78-4. The structure of Lacidipine (I) is given below.<br><br>
Processes for the preparation of Lacidipine and similar compounds are described in US Patent nos. 4801599; 4935548; 5011848; 5051432 and European Patent no. 245919. The US patents 4801599 and 5011848 describe several methods of preparation of Lacidipine (I) and similar compounds. These methods are given in Scheme-1.<br><br><br>
Lacidipine is prepared by condensation of ethyl 3-aminocrotonate with tert-butyl 2-formylcinnamate (II) in acetic acid or trifluoroacetic acid (Reaction - B). The formyl cinnamate ester is prepared by a Wittig reaction of benzene 1,2-dicarbaldehyde with tert-butoxycarbonyl methylene triphenyl phosphorane (Reaction - A). In another process, Lacidipine is prepared by condensation of ethyl aminocrotonate with ketoester (III), which is prepared by reacting tert-butyl 2-formylcinnamate (II) with ethyl acetoacetate (Reaction - C). Lacidipine is also prepared by reacting compound II with a mixture of ethyl acetoacetate and ethyl aminocrotonate in alcoholic solvent in the presence of strong acids like trifluoroacetic acid. (Reaction - D). US Patent 4801599 also describes a method of preparation of lacidipine, in which compound (IV) is reacted with triphenylphosphorane (V) to give lacidipine. (Reaction - E)<br><br>
According to US 4801599 and US 5011848, Lacidipine and similar compounds are prepared by treating compound of formula VI (where X represents a bromine or iodine atom) with tert-butyl acrylate in presence of a catalytic amount of a palladium salt such as palladium acetate and triphenylphosphine as ligand in solvents like dimethylformamide in the presence of alkyl amines as depicted in Scheme-2.<br><br>
EP 534520 and US 5310917 describe a process for the preparation of felodipine and other dihydropyridine compounds by heating intermediates like (VII) with suitably substituted amino crotonate compound in alcoholic solvents at elevated temperature for a sufficiently long time followed by treating the resultant mixture with a strong acid. In a variation of this process, after the reaction has been heated for sufficient time, the reaction mass is cooled in ice bath and then diluted with 1:1 ethanol-water and the product is isolated by filtration as depicted in Scheme-3.<br><br>
The above methods of lacidipine preparation use expensive reagents, or strongly acidic conditions and involve extractive work up procedures to isolate the product.<br>
In developing an improved process for the preparation of Lacidipine, an alternative method for the formation of the cinnamate ester is desired. The objective is to avoid use of solvents   like   diethyl   ether   to   remove   phosphine   oxide   by-products   and   column<br><br>
chromatography for purification. In a variation of the Wittig reaction, phosphonate esters such as VIII have been used as reagents for the preparation of olefins (Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction). These olefination reactions are performed in alkaline conditions involving bases like sodium hydride and in solvents like tetrahydrofuran and are selective in producing the E isomers (B.E. Maryanoff and A. B Reitz, Chem. Revs. (1989) 89, 863; L. A. Yanovskaya Zh. Vses. Khim Mendeleeva (1986), 31, 38 CA: 1986, 105, 41961u). These reactions are also carried out under biphasic conditions using strong solutions of aqueous sodium hydroxide at reflux temperature of solvents used. In one case, the olefination reaction is conducted in water without any organic solvent (J. Villieras and M. Rambaud, Synthesis (1983), 300-303).<br>
The literature methods describe reactions of single carbonyl functionality. In the present case, o-phthalaldehyde, a compound with.two identical carboxaldehyde functional groups is to be selectively reacted at only one of these groups, hi the process of making t-butyl-2-formyl cinnamate, the olefination reaction was conducted in water without any organic solvent as previously reported by Villieras and Rambaud. Several products are formed and no selectivity is observed. Upon further reactions of the gum with ethyl acetoacetate and ethyl amino crotonate, no lacidipine could be obtained (example - 1). Another reaction was conducted in biphasic solvent system without a phase transfer catalyst. In the second case the rate of conversion is very slow (example - 2). Therefore, a different method is required for selective mono olefination of the bis-aldehyde functionality.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
It is an object of the present invention to develop a process for the preparation of lacidipine (I) giving the product in higher yields having lower percentage of undesirable impurities than previously described processes without using phosphine reagents (which necessitates use of hazardous solvents like diethyl ether or chromatographic methods) or expensive palladium salts or strong acids. It is further an object of the invention to provide a process for the preparation of lacidipine wherein the product crystallizes from the reaction mixture and is isolated by conventional techniques such as filtration, thereby eliminating the need for more expensive and time consuming extractive isolation procedures. In the present invention, lacidipine is prepared by 1) reaction of o-phthalaldehyde with tert-butyl phosphonoacetate in a biphasic solvent system comprising water and an organic solvent in the presence of a base and a phase transfer catalyst; 2) condensing the resulting cinnamate ester with ethyl acetoacetate in hydrocarbon solvents at reflux temperature of the solvent in<br><br>
the presence of a carboxylate salt of a secondary amine with the water formed in the reaction being removed azeotropically; 3) reacting the resulting compound with ethyl aminocrotonate in alcoholic solvents at reflux temperature of the solvent; 4) cooling the reaction mixture to crystallize lacidipine and isolation of lacidipine by conventional methods such as filtration or centrifugation.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION:<br>
In the present invention (Scheme - 4) the olefin derivative is synthesized by a process involving tert-butyl phosphonoacetate (VIII) and o-phthalaldehyde under biphasic conditions employing water and an organic solvent with a phase transfer catalyst and alkali metal carbonates are bases. The preferred base in the present invention is potassium carbonate. Organic solvents like benzene, toluene, xylene, chloroform, dichloromethane (MDC), ethylene chloride, diethyl ether etc can be used. The preferred solvent is dichloromethane. The phase transfer catalyst can be selected from any commonly available ones like benzyltriethylammonium chloride, tetra butyl ammonium bromide, cetrimide etc in 0.1 to 10% quantities. The preferred catalyst is cetrimide with about 1% being most suitable. The reactions are normally complete in about 6-24hours. The reaction can be carried out at temperature ranging from 0-50 °C and preferably between 25 and 35°C. Furthermore, inert atomosphere is not required; the reaction can be carried out exposed to atmosphere. When the reaction has proceeded to a desired stage (typically less than 3% of o-phthalaldehyde), the organic layer is separated from aqueous phase and evaporated to obtain the desired product in around 90% purity. Optionally, the product tert-butyl-2-formyl [£]-cinnamate may remain in solution and can be utilized as it is in the next step.<br><br><br>
The olefin compound (II) thus obtained is condensed with a p-keto acid ester such as ethyl acetoacetate in the presence of a catalyst such as carboxylic acid salt of a secondary amine. The carboxylic acids can be acetic acid, benzoic acid etc and organic base can be piperidine, morpholine, pyrrolidine, dialkyl amines like dimethylamine, diethylamine etc. The preferred catalyst combination is piperidine and acetic acid. Suitable solvents for the reaction are hydrocarbon solvents selected from benzene, toluene, xylene, hexane, heptane or cyclohexane etc. with the preferred solvents being cyclohexane and heptane. The reaction is carried out in a temperature range of 70-120°C, preferably 80-90°C. After the reaction has proceeded to the desired stage (typically less than 1% of the starting ester), the solvent is removed under vacuum to leave an oily product (III) as a cis/trans mixture.<br>
Compound (III) is then reacted with ethyl-3-aminocrotonate, in suitable low molecular weight alcohol solvent such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and the like. The preferred solvent is methanol. The reaction is conducted at reflux temperature of the solvent and is complete generally in 3-10 hours, preferably 4-6 hours. It was found that addition of a strong acid to speed up the reaction is not required. After the said period of heating, the reaction mass is cooled to ambient temperature for 10-15 hours for the product to crystallize. Optionally, the reaction mass may be seeded with the product to speed up crystallization. The product is isolated by simple filtration. Washing the crude product with chilled methanol removes most of the impurities. The product can be re-crystallized from suitable alcoholic solvents like methanol, ethanol or isopropanol or from solvents like ethyl acetate or acetonitrile. The solvent of choice is ethyl acetate. Lacidipine thus obtained is more than 99.8% pure and it contained less than 0.1% impurities.<br><br>
Advantages of the present invention include: 1) use of a biphasic system and phase transfer catalytic conditions for the formation of 2-forraylcinnamate ester; 2) easy and cost efficient isolation of Lacidipine without purification of any intermediates by crystallization from the reaction mixture; 3) Replacement of a triphenyl phosphine ylid with tert-butyl phosphonoacetate and minimal extractive work up procedures.<br>
The following examples are provided to further illustrate the practice of present invention and are not intended to limit the scope or utility thereof.<br>
EXAMPLES:<br>
Example-1<br>
A mixture of potassium carbonate (8.3g, 0.06mol), o-phthalaldehyde (4g, 0.03mol) and t-butyl phosphonoacetate (8.7g, 0.0358mol) in 6ml water is stirred at room temperature for lhr. Reaction is diluted with 25ml of water and 50ml chloroform. The layers are separated and the organic layer is washed with water (2x25ml). The chloroform solution is dried over sodium sulfate and solvent is distilled off under vacuum to get red viscous oil. The above product is dissolved in 50ml cyclohexane. To this solution are added 0.2 lg of piperidine, 0.15g of acetic acid and 4.8g of ethyl acetoacetate. The mixture is stirred under reflux for 4 hours.
