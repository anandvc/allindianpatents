"A PRESERVATIVE COMPOSITION FOR FRUITS AND VEGETABLES"<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to the preservative composition which enable peeled<br>
fruit and prepared vegetables, peeled or chopped as for cooking or raw consumption, nuts, shoots, fruit and vegetable juices, and cut flowers to be marketed and stored without unacceptable deterioration. Background of the Invention<br>
Citrus fruits, such as oranges, mandarins and grapefruit, deteriorate rapidly once peeled due to oxidation of the fruit and other effects; Such rapid spoiling has prevented the marketing of peeled citrus fruits, and in view of the known difficulties associated with the peeling of such fruits, has restricted the consumption and sale of such fruits. Other fruits, such as apples, are equally susceptible to spoiling when peeled or exposed to the atmosphere in the raw state. Vegetables, nuts and shoots are similarly susceptible to spoiling, as are fruit and vegetablejuices and cut flowers.<br>
Nature has demonstrated that vitamin C is never found alone in nature; it<br>
is always found in combination with flavonoids. Flavonoids were first located<br>
in the white pith of oranges. The inclusion of vitamin C and/or ascorbates<br>
(calcium, magnesium, sodium or potassium ascorbates) in nature in combination<br>
with flavonoids results in natural preservation of the fruit or vegetable.<br>
Summary of Invention and Object	<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved composition for the preservation of peeled fruits and vegetables, peeled or chopped as for cooking or raw consumption, peeled and cut fruits, fruit salad, nuts and shoots, fruit and vegetable juices and cut flowers, including oranges, mandarins, grapefruit, apples, kiwi fruit, guavas, lychees, rumbutarrs, apricots, peaches, nectarines, pineapple, melon, strawberries, cherries, passionfruit, mangostein, mango, asparagus, broccoli, avocado, cauliflower, beans (whole, of chopped), peas (including shelled peas and snowpeas), celery, carrot (chopped, shredded or in straws), capsicum, chocos, zucchini, corn, brussel sprouts, cabbage, pumpkin, garlic, chilli and ginger, fruit and vegetable juices, and cut flowers (hereinafter<br><br>
-2 -<br>
"peeled fruits, peeled or cut vegetables, cut flowers, nuts and shoots, fruit and vegetable juices"), in a manner which enables the peeled fruits, peeled or cut vegetables, cut flowers, nuts and shoots or fruit and vegetable juices to be suitably packaged and stored for subsequent consumption without unacceptable deterioration.<br>
This object is realised by including in the  composition an effective amount of an antioxidant containing flavonoids.<br>
The invention further provides a preservative composition for peeled fruits, peeled or cut vegetables, cut flowers, nuts and shoots, fruit and vegetable juices (as hereinbefore defined) including a fruit juice, or water and fruit juice component containing vitamin C which inhibits oxidation of the product to be preserved, a preservative component such as sugar is desired, and an antioxidant component which includes at least one antioxidant containing flavonoids.<br>
The fruit juice component is preferably a fruit juice which is palatable and which inhibits, oxidation of the product to be preserved. The antioxidant component can be selected from a natural oil-containing material, such as grapeseed oil and/or any extract from the bark of pinus, such as Pinus Radiata, Pinus Pinasta. (Maritime Pine), or from the other flavonoid containing antioxidants described below-. Such antioxidants contain substantial amounts of flavonoids and are readily commercially available. Examples of pinus bark extracts include Enzogenol™ (see "Why Enzogenol is an Antioxidant Breakthrough" by Kelvin Duncan dated 1998 in "The Enzogenol Story), or Pycnogenol™, an extract from Maritime Pine (Pinus Pinasta) (see "Pycnogenol The Super Protector Nutrient** Richard A Passwater and Chithan Kandaswami), The grapeseed oil component referred to above can be replaced by a powdered grapeseed extract which is dissolved in the composition.<br>
Other acceptable flavonoid containing antioxidants include Acerola, Rutin, Hesperidm (Vitamin P), Alpha Lipoic Acid, Quercetin, Blueberry Powder, Bioperin, Lectein, Xanthophyll (marigold essence), Lycopene (tomato extract), Methyisulfonyiemethan (MSM), Boswellia Serrata, Schizandra Chinensis, Citrin, Flavones, Calechin, Flavoals, Citrus Seed Extract, Rhodiola<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
Rosea,   Juniper  Berry  Powder   Extract,   Astraeaus   Membranaceus   Extract, Echinacea Augusifolia Extract, Gold Seal Extract, Cranberry Extract.<br>
The vitamin C component of the preservative solution can be contained in the fruit juice component or can be supplemented or provided by appropriate ascorbates of calcium, magnesium, sodium or potassium. Suitable fruit juices containing appropriate amounts of vitamin C or ascorbate include cranberry juice (vaccinium macrocarpon), lemon juice, rose hip tea or powder (rosa canina) or green tea (camellia sinensis), pineapple juice, juniper berry tea or juniper berries powder or blackcurrant juice. This list is not meant to be exhaustive and other natural fruit juices or teas having appropriate levels of vitamin C or ascorbate can be used with equally successful results.<br>
The process of the present invention effectively replaces the detrimental results of chopping and peeling by replacing the vitamin C, ascorbates and flavonoids of the peeled or chopped product. In food preparation, there are serious losses in flavonoids, and the replacement of those flavonoids by the preservative solution of the present invention ensures that the product is preserved in an apparently fresh state for a considerable period of time.<br>
Grapes, apples, grapefruit, broccoli, onions and fennel contain the flavonoid Quercetin, and the replacement of this important flavonoid by the use of the preservative solution ensures that the product is preserved in a natural state.<br>
The flavonoid Acerola is found in cherries, and the loss of that flavonoid can be replaced in a peeled or cut version of this fruit by the preservative solution of the invention.<br>
Berries contain the flavonoid Schizandra Chinensis, and such berries will also respond well to the replacement of that particular flavonoid by means of the preservative solution of the present invention.<br>
Due to the fact that flavonoids increase the absorption of vitamin C, many flavonoids are found to be effective across the whole spectrum of fruit (deciduous or tropical) and vegetables. Hesperidin, the bio-flavonoid sometimes   called  vitamin  P  includes  Quercetin,  Citrin,   Rutin,  Flavones,<br><br>
-4-<br>
Calechin and Flavonals.    The versatility of this bio-flavonoid is apparent together with the following bio-flavonoids.<br>
1)	Tomato (Lycopene), and<br>
2)	Marigold (xanthophyll), or any one or more of the flavonoid<br>
                 containing antioxidants defined above.<br>
These particular bio-flavonoids will be referred to below in relation to the preservation of fruits, vegetables and cut flowers.<br>
The   interchangeability  of vitamin C   and   ascorbates  are   tolerated favourably    by    all    products    as    defined,    above,    and    the    particular      interchangeability of flavonoids with any fruit or vegetable is particularly apparent. In nature, there are over four thousand types of flavonoids in the form of water soluble compounds, and it is therefore possible to use mixes  of flavonoids and vitamin C or ascorbic acids in' the preservative solution of the present invention.    By suitably selecting the most appropriate flavonoids, vitamin C or ascorbic acids, the taste of the preserved product is always fresh and the flesh of the product firm.<br>
If desired, zinc can be combined with vitamin C or ascorbate as it enhances its function. For example, zinc gluconate can be added to water with lemon juice to preserve vegetables such as potatoes and fruits such as apples and pears.  Beta Carotene can also be added to vegetables in the presence of vitamin G or ascorbates. Beta Carotene is the water soluble form of vitamin A. Similarly, d- -tocopherol may be added when vitamin C or ascorbates are present in the preservative solution.  This compound is natural vitamin E which is an antioxidant which functions well together with Beta Carotene and zinc to inhibit degeneration of the fruit, vegetable or fruit juice.<br>
In the specific examples described below, it will be noted that products being preserved are dipped or soaked for a short interval in the preservative solution, and it has been found that the composition is'absorbed only into the surface of the product rather than absorbed deeply into the flesh of the product. Nevertheless, acceptable preservation is still achieved.<br>
Fruit salad having the preservative  composition as  its juice,  achieved<br><br>
remarkable longevity, even when apple is included.<br>
In applying the preservative composition to the products defined above, It is preferred to dry some products after the preserving composition is applied. By drying the treated product, it is found that the preserving composition is more successful.<br>
The preferred fruit juice component is pineapple juice, but other fruit  juices or fruit juice combination, such as lemon juice and water, which are palatable and which inhibit oxidation can be used.<br>
In one-preferred form of the invention, a preservative composition for peeled fruit or vegetables include about 40% to 60% by weight of pineapple juice, about 40% to 60% by weight of sugar, and about 0,04% to 0.06% by volume of grapeseed oil and/or Enzogenol or Pycnogenol e.g. (proanthocyanidin powder).<br>
In preparing the above defined composition pineapple juice and sugar components are preferably boiled for a period of about three minutes and allowed to cool before adding the grapeseed oil and/or Enzogenol, proanthocyanidin, Pycnogenol or any other suitable proanthocyanidin powder to preserve the antioxidant properties of the oil<br>
The invention further provides a preservative composition including a boiled or substantially sterile water and sugar solution, an anti-browing component selected from lemon juice, citric acid or ascorbic acid, and an anti-oxidant component including at least one antioxidant containing flavonoids.<br>
Suitably sterile water can be produced by adding about 4 drops of colloidal silver to 1 litre of water. Colloidal silver has a sanitising effect acceptable under the N.H.M.R.C and U.S.E.P.A, water quality guidelines.<br>
The astioxidant can be selected from a natural oil coating material, such as grapeseed oil, an extract from the bark of pirns such as Pinus Radiata or an extract from the bark of pinus pinaster, or Pinus Maritime, such ss the antioxidant products described above.<br>
The amount of sugar contained in the  composition depends on the fruit or vegetable being preserved and may vary from about 2% by weight to about 40% by weight.<br><br>
-6-<br>
The invention further provides a process for preserving peeled fruits, raw vegetables, nuts, shoots, and fruit or vegetable juices, including the steps of peeling the fruit or preparing the vegetable, nut,, shoots or juice, removing the central pith material from the fruit if necessary, soaking the fruit or vegetable in the solution as defined above, or adding the solution to the juice, and suitably packaging the preserved fruit or vegetable, nut, shoots or juice.  Citrus fruits are preferable soaked whole, although they can be cut or segmented.   Vegetables are at least peeled and can be cut as for usual preparation for cooking or eating.<br>
If desired, the fruit or vegetable can be preserved by the process in cut or segmented pieces.<br>
In packaging the fruit, vegetables, nuts, shoots and juices, it is preferred to package in the presence of a suitable known food gas, such as those containing nitrogen and carbon dioxide gases. Once packaged the produce is refrigerated at a constant of between 0°C and 6°C.<br>
In a particularly preferred form of the invention, the pineapple juice is preferably unsweetened pineapple juice, while the sugar component is preferably processed white sugar.<br>
In the preservation of grapefruit, a quantity of up to about 50% of the pineapple juice may be replaced by grapefruit juice, while the sugar content is preferably provided by raw sugar rather than processed sugar. Otherwise, the preservingcomposition is the same as for oranges.<br>
If desired, the solution may include an appropriate quantity of rose pink colouring, such as food colour 122.<br>
As  mentioned  above,  the  natural  oil  coating  component,  such  as grapeseed oil, may be replaced or supplemented by extracts from the bark of Pinus Radiata or pinus pinaster.   This latter material is described in greater detail in United  States Patent No.  4,698,360,  the contents  of which  are incorporated herein by cross-reference.    These alternative or supplementary substances are used because they protect the fruit, vegetables, nuts and shoots from oxidative damage.    Enzogenol has a wide mixture of flavonoids from every flavonoid group, the natural defence mechanism of many plants, which -<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
protect against: fungal parasites, herbivores, pathogens and oxidative cell injury and environmental stress. Flavonbids contribute to the colour, nutritional value, texture and taste of fruit, vegetables, nuts and shoots, and to their keeping qualities.<br>
	Pycnogenol has built into it an  enzyme delivery system,  and  as  a<br>
medicinal dose, the suggested daily dose is 20mg for every 20 pounds of body weight. As reported by the International Bio-Research Inc, no toxic doses have been found. There are no recommended levels for flavonoid intake for humans, but one has to eat an enormous quantity of fruit and vegetables to obtain reasonable levels for flavonoids from these sources.   Because not all fruit and vegetables contain the same flavonoids, or similar proportions of various flavonoids, Enzogenol is excellent because of its extremely wide range of flavonoids and phenolic acids.    Flavonoids and phenolic acids are removed during handling, storing, skinning and peeling. The above described extracts are beneficial to the preservative   composition according  to the invention because they are water soluble and fat soluble.<br>
In order that the invention may be more readily understood, preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described in further detail. Description of Preferred Embodiments Orange Preservation<br>
Oranges can be preserved by this embodiment of the invention by fully peeling the orange and radically cutting the central pith region of the orange as part of the peeling process.<br>
The preserving composition is  prepared by boiling about 400 grams of Unsweetened pineapple juice, and about 400 grams of white sugar for about three minutes, and allowing the solution to cool   Following cooling, about 4 teaspoons of grapeseed oil with or without 20 to 60mg of Enzogenol  or proanthocyanidin, Pycnogenol or any other suitable proanthocyanidin powder are added to the solution.   The peeled oranges are then fully immersed in the cooled solution for about three minutes, following which the soaked oranges are removed and suitably packaged.  The packaging preferably seals the preserved<br><br>
-8-<br>
fruit within, the package in the presence of a suitable food grade gasa although acceptable results are achieved without the use of the gas. Grapefruit Preservation<br>
In the preservation of  grapefruit, the fruit is peeled and the central pith      region radically removed. A preservative composition including 125 grains of white sugar, 125 grams of raw sugar 125 grams of unsweetened pineapple juice, and 125ml of grapefruit juice, is boiled for about three minutes and then cooled. Following Cooling, 25mls of grapeseed oil, with or without 20-60mg of Bnzogenol    and   proanthocyanidin,    Pycnogenol or   any    other   suitable proanthocyanidin powder and one drop of rose pink colouring are added to the composition. The peeled fruit is immersed in the cooled composition  for about three minutes, following which if is packaged in the same manner as the preserved oranges.<br>
In the case of tropical fruits, grapeseed oil is optional and is preferably replaced by the above extracts.<br>
The above preserving solutions can be used with success with oranges, mandarins, tangerines, kiwi fruits, mango, pineapple, apricots, blackberries, raspberries, mulberries, cherries, blue berries, figs, peaches, nectarines, pears, nashi, plums, tamarillo, cantaloupe, grapefruit, apples, guavas, lychees, rumbutans, melon, passionfruit, and mangostein,. Avocado did not brown, once it had been introduced to the orange formula.<br>
Most fruits and avocado were soaked in the formula for about two to four minutes, drained, then packaged in an airtight container, and refrigerated or packaged in a tamper-proof plastic container (PET™' or PAK™) -and refrigerated, or tamper-proofed as above after being filled with food grade gas (50%-CO2 and 50% nitrogen) and then refrigerated. In the case of apple, pears, nashi and guava, 12 to 15 minutes soaking is required.<br>
Fruit and vegetable preserving solution, using Enzogenol and/or proanthocyanidin powder. This was created especially for apples in the beginning, but it was found to be highly successful for preserving pears, nashi, kiwi fruit, lychee, peaches, nectarines, pineapple, honey dew melon, seedless<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
watermelon, star fruit, strawberries, rumbuhtans and baby coconut.<br>
The formula is able to preserve vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, green beans, snow peas, celery, carrot, capsicum, chocos, zucchini, mushrooms, garlic and ginger. Vegetables are treated individually as to the time allowed to soak in the formula: the average time is six minutes.<br>
The formula is also able to preserve chestnuts, shelled and peeled. The soak time is 6-10 minutes. The formula is also able to preserve shoots, such as alfalfa or mixed shoots, or mung bean shoots. The soak time is 2-3 minutes.<br>
Apple Formula<br>
1.	400mls spring water (preferably purified with 4 drops colloidal silver to<br>
1	litre water)<br>
2.	20gms sugar<br>
boil for 3 minutes then cool<br>
3.	20mg Enzogenol-powder or proanthocyanidin powder<br>
4.	60mls lemon juice or 20 mg ascorbic acid.<br>
Nashi Formula<br>
1.	400mls spring water (preferably purified with 4 drops colloidal silver to<br>
1	litre water)<br>
2.	l00gms sugar<br>
boil for three minutes then cool<br>
3.	20mg Enzogenol powder or proanthocyanidin powder<br>
4.	15mls lemon juice<br>
Honey-Dew Melon<br>
1.	o      400mls spring water<br>
2.	lOOgms sugar<br>
boil for three minutes then cool<br>
3.	10mg Enzogenol powder or proanthocyanidin powder<br>
4.	10mls lemon juice<br>
Various fruit or vegetables, nuts or shoots are applied to either of the formulas or variations. Granny Smith apples are soaked for 10 minutes, softer apples for 8 minutes, nashi are soaked for 3 minutes, pears for 5, melons for 3<br><br>
-10-<br>
minutes.<br>
All the products are drained and packed as above and refrigerated. Apples, pears and nashis are still white and crisp after 3 weeks. Kiwi fruit responds just as well to the apple formula as the orange formula.<br>
After introducing the. fruit, vegetables, nuts and shoots to the relevant formula, all products are of a rich colour, crisp, firm, natural and fresh tasting and smell fresh.    Even "tired" broccoli revived and improved after being preserved in the apple formula. In the above formula:<br>
lemon juice, ascorbic acid and citric acid may be used together or interchangeably;<br>
grapeseed extract which is also a flavonoid rich substance may be used alone or together with the pine bark extract;<br>
all nuts, coconut including "baby coconut" can be readily preserved; all tropical fruit may also be preserved using the composition. The bio-flavonoids Lycopene and Xanthophyll can be used together in the   proportions,   Lycopene   3rng   and   Xanthophyll   2.1mg   per  400ml   of preservative solution.<br>
Rose hip fruit powder (rosa canena or rhodiola rosea) is also able to be used;<br>
Bio-flavonoids powder can be used 25rag for each 1,5 grams of ascorbate or vitamin C in the preservative solution.<br>
Juniper berry powder can be used in the proportion 5mg per 400ml of preservative solution with 2rng of ascorbate.<br>
Grapeseed powder extract can be used instead of grapeseed oil and the proportions 40mg per 400ml of preservative solution, provided that solution contains vitamin C or ascorbate.<br>
Maritime pine bark extract can be used in place of Pinus Radiata bark extract. Similarly, Astragaus membranaceus extract equivalent to dry inner stem bark 60 to l00mg per 1000ml of preservative-composition can be used in place of the pinus  bark  extracts  referred   to  above.     Furthermore,  echinachea<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
angustifolia extract equivalent to dry root 100mg standardised to contain echinoside 1.7mg per 1000ml of preservative composition may be used in place of any one of the above.<br>
Alternatively, gold seal (hydrastis canadenis extract) equivalent to dry stem bark 150mg may be used in place of the above.<br>
Similarly cranberry (vaccinium macrocarpon) 100mg dry fruit equivalent to 10 grams fresh fruit juice can be added to 400ml of preservative solution.<br>
Similarly, Quercetin, Acerola, Schizandra Chinensis,  Hesperidin  and Rutin can also be added to the preservative solution to provide flavonoid input to preserve the fruit, vegetable or other product.   In addition to Alpha Lipoic Acid, Blueberry Powder, Bioperin, Lectein, Xanthophyll (marigold essence), Lycopene  (tomato  extract),  Methylsuifonylemethan  (MSM),  and  Boswellia Serrata, Citrin, Flavones, Calechin, Flavoals, Citrus Seed Extract, Rhodiola Rosea,  Juniper  Berry  Powder  Extract,   Astraeaus  Membranaceus  Extract, Echinacea Augusifolia Extract, Gold Seal Extract, Cranberry Extract. Fruit Juices<br>
Testing was done with navel oranges which are notorious for turning bitter after a short time of cutting or juicing. o Juice squeezed at the same time was divided into three.  One "control" sample was regular untreated juice, one test had a same measure of Navel orange juice with Enzogenol and one test had the same measure of orange juice with Pycnogenol.  At the two week mark the taste test showed definite bitterness in the control juice but only sweetness and freshness in the other two.   At the three week mark the taste test of 1 was sharper, but 2 and 3 remained, unchanged.    The preserved juice contained 200mls navel orange juice to 40mg Enzogenol or 20mg Pycnogenol.   Apples were juiced with the same measurements allowing also 2 to 5mg ascorbic acid per   200ml    apple   juice   as   well    as    the    Enzogenol    or   Pycnogenol (proanthocyanidin powder) or grapeseed extract.   No change at week four for examples 2 and 3. Cut Flowers It is expected that in the same way that broccoli and beans revived after<br><br>
-12-<br>
treatment with pine bark extract containing solution, that cut flowers would also, if these or any other flavonoid were placed in water holding cut flowers with  a small  quantity of ascorbate.     For example 5mg  of Ascorbate  (eg potassium ascorbate), 20mg of Enzogenol to about 2 litres of water. Alternative Vegetable Formulae 1.        200ml boiled water<br>
5mg green tea extract<br>
cool, then add<br>
5mg ascorbic acid<br>
5mg grapeseed oil and/or equivalent powder or apricot oil<br>
2.	200ml boiled water, cool then add<br>
5mg grapeseed extract<br>
5mg ascorbic acid<br>
5mg grapeseed oi] and/or equivalent powder or almond oil<br>
3.	Effuse 6 juniper berries in 150ml boiled water, then cool<br>
Add 5mg calcium ascorbate<br>
Add 5mg zinc gluconate<br>
Add 5001.U. d-alpha-tocopherol (emulsified vitamin E)<br>
In each of the above examples, it is preferred that the fruit, vegetable, nut, shoot or other product to be preserved is dried after being immersed in the preservative composition./Drying of the preserved product has been found, to improve the preservative effect significantly.<br>
Testing of the above described preserving, solutions and processes have demonstrated that peeled oranges and grapefruit can be kept for considerable periods without unacceptable deterioration of the product. Thus, the applicant has been able to store the preserved fruit under domestic refrigeration for a period of the order of eighteen months. It is expected that similar results will be achieved in the preservation of mandarins and other citrus fruits.<br><br>
