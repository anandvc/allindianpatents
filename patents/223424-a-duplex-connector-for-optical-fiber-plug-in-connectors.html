				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a duplex conntctort<br>
comprising two fastening devices for receiving two simplex plug-<br>
in connectors for forming a duplex plug-in connector.<br>
A duplex connector of the generic type in question is<br>
disclosed by US 979,429. The duplex connector comprises a plate-<br>
shaped element, on the side walls of which two differently<br>
designed cylindrical pins are respectively arranged and can be<br>
inserted into corresponding holes in a connector housing of a<br>
simplex connector. Arranged on the upper side of the plate-shaped<br>
element is a clip—shaped element, which in the assembled state<br>
engages around the latching clips of the simplex plug-in<br>
connectors, so that the two latching clips of the simplex plug-in<br>
connectors can be simultaneously released by actuation of the<br>
clip-shaped element. The simplex plug-in connectors are formed<br>
with holes on both sides of their housing, so that each simplex<br>
plug-in connector can be arranged on either side of the duplex<br>
connector. As a result, it is possible for example for the<br>
channels to be subsequently changed over by exchanging or<br>
changing the simplex plug-in connectors. Consequently, the duplex<br>
conntctor allows a duplex plug-in connector to be produced from<br>
two simplex plug-in connectors. A further advantage is that, when<br>
one simplex plug-in connector is defective, only this defective<br>
plug-in connector has to be exchanged. The disadvantage of the<br>
known duplex connector is the inadequate quality of the<br>
mechanical connection and its limited suitability for use.<br>
The invention is therefore based on the technical<br>
problem of providing a duplex connector for optical fiber plug-in<br>
connectors which can be used universally and realises an improved<br>
mechanical connection between a duplex connector and a plug-in<br>
connector.<br>
The technical problem is solved by the device<br>
having the features of the invention. Further advanta-<br>
geous developments of the invention emerge from the<br>
essential features of the invention. In this respect, the<br>
fastening devices are designed in such a way that they at least<br>
partially enclose the connector housing and/or the kink preventer<br>
of a plug-in connector to be received. As a result, the plug-in<br>
connector to be received is securely clamped by the fastening<br>
device, the clamping forces being distributed around the plug-<br>
in housing in a way corresponding to the design of the fastening<br>
device. A further advantage of the duplex connector according to<br>
the invention is that it does not require any mechanical<br>
provisions on the plug-in connector itself. As a result, the<br>
duplex connector can be used universally for plug-in connectors<br>
from various manufacturers.<br>
In a preferred embodiment,the fastening devices are<br>
designed as C-shaped receptacles, so that they securely clamp the<br>
respective kink preventer in a resilient mannar. In this case,<br>
the open legs of the C-shaped receptacle are preferably formed<br>
with a bevel in order to faciliate the insertion of the plug-in<br>
connector.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, a right-angled<br>
receptacle adjoins the C-shaped receptacle in the longitudinal<br>
direction of the duplex connector. This right-angled receptacle<br>
serves for securely clamping part of the connector housing.<br>
Consequently, the plug-in connector is securely clamped by the<br>
duplex connector on the kink preventer and the connector housing<br>
simultaneously, which brings about a particularly secure<br>
mechanical connection.<br>
The right-angled receptacle is preferably essentially<br>
of an L-shaped form, the open legs preferably being formed with a<br>
bevel. Furthermore, the L-shaped receptacle is formed with a web<br>
which protrudes over the upper side of the connector housing.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, a clip-shaped<br>
element is arranged on the upper side in such a way that, in the<br>
fastened state of the simplex plug-in connectors, it engage, over<br>
the clips of the latter so that, by actuation of the clip—shaped<br>
element, the two clips of the simplex plug-in connectors are<br>
actuated simultaneously.<br>
The invention is explained in wore detail below on the<br>
basis of a preferred exemplary embodiment. In the figures :<br>
Figure 1 shows a perspective rear view of a duplex<br>
connector,<br>
Figure 2 shows a perspective front view of the duplex<br>
connector.<br>
Figure 3 shows a side view of the duplex connector,<br>
Figure 4 shows an exploded representation of the duplex<br>
connector with two simplex plug-in connectors,<br>
Figure 9 shows a duplex plug-in connection comprising<br>
a duplex connector and two simplex plug-in connectors in the<br>
assembled state and<br>
Figure 6 shows a side view of the duplex plug-in<br>
connection.<br>
The duplex connector 1 comprises an upper side 2 and a<br>
lower side 3, between which a web-shaped wall element 4 is<br>
centrally arranged. Arranged on each side of the wall element 4<br>
is a C-shaped receptacle 5 and an L-shaped receptacle 6. The C-<br>
shaped receptacles 9 extend over the full width of the duplex<br>
connector 1. The end faces 7 of the upper legs are formed with a<br>
bevel 8 and the end faces 9 of the lower legs are formed with a<br>
bevel 10. The end face 9 of the lower leg extends over the full<br>
length L of the duplex connector 1, whereas the end face 7<br>
extends only as far as the L-shaped receptacle 6. Arranged<br>
parallel to the upper side 2 of the duplex connector 1 in the<br>
region of the L-shaped receptacle 6 is a web 11, which is<br>
somewhat narrower than the width B of the duplex connector 1.<br>
The web 11 is likewise formed with a bevel 12. The length of the<br>
C-shaped receptacle 5 is in this case somewhat more than twice<br>
the length of the L-shaped receptacle 6. Arranged on the upper<br>
side 2 is a clip-shaped element 13, which extends at an angle<br>
from the front side to the rear side and goes into a part<br>
parallel to the upper side 2.<br>
Represented in Figure 4 is the duplex connector 1 from<br>
Figures l-3, with the simplex plug-in connectors 14. The two<br>
simplex plug-in connectors 14 are of a completely identical<br>
construction. Each simplex plug—in connector 14 comprises the<br>
actual optical fiber cable 15, a cable sheath fixing means 16, a<br>
kink preventer 17 and the connector housing 18. The kink<br>
preventer 17 is made up of a conical part and a cylindrical part<br>
the cylindrical part facing the connector housing 18. Arranged on<br>
the connector housing 18 is a snap clip 19 which serves for<br>
latching and releasing the plug-in connector 14 in a<br>
corresponding receptacle. The connector housing 18 itself is of<br>
an essentially cuboidal design. The snap clip 19 is made up of a<br>
latching clip 20 and a releasing clip 21, which is explained in<br>
more detail with reference to Figure 6.<br>
Represented in Figure 9 is the complete duplex plug-in<br>
connector 22. In this caset the cylindrical part of the kink<br>
preventer 17 is securely clamped in the C-shaped receptacle 9 and<br>
part of the connector housing 18 is securely clamped in the<br>
L-shaped receptacle 6. The lateral gripping of the end faces 7, 9<br>
with their bevels 8, 10 around the receptacles 5, 6 makes the<br>
clamping connection mechanically very stable. The clip-shaped<br>
element 13 is in this caw ovtr both the clips 19 of the two<br>
simlplex plug-in connectors 14, so that they can be simultaneously<br>
released.<br>
As can be seen from figure 6, the releasing clips 21<br>
are over the latching clips 20 and the clip-shaped element 13 is<br>
over the releasing clips 21. If the duplex plug-in connector 22<br>
is then fitted into a corresponding receptacle, the latching<br>
clips 20 latch into the receptacle . Pressure on the sloping<br>
part of the clip-shaped element 13 causes the releasing clips 21<br>
likewise to be pressed downward. These in turn press the latching<br>
clips 20 downwardt so that all the clips are unlatched and the<br>
duplex plug-in connector 22 can be released.<br>
