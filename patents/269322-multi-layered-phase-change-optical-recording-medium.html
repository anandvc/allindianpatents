				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
MULTI-LAYERED PHASE-CHANGE OPTICAL<br>
RECORDING MEDIUM<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a multi-layered<br>
phase-change optical recording medium having a plurality of<br>
phase-change recording layers, which enables to record,<br>
reproduce and rewrite information by irradiating phase-change<br>
recording layers with a light beam to thereby induce an optical<br>
change in a recording layer material in the phase-change<br>
recording layers.<br>
Background Art<br>
Typically, a phase-change optical recording medium<br>
(phase-change optical disc) such as DVD+RW has a basic<br>
structure in which a recording layer composed of a phase-change<br>
material is formed on a plastic substrate, and a reflective layer<br>
that allows for improving optical absorptance of the recording<br>
layer and has a thermal diffusion effect is formed on the<br>
recording layer, and such a typical phase-change optical<br>
recording medium is irradiated with a laser beam from the<br>
substrate surface side, thereby information can be record and<br>
reproduced. A phase-change recording material is<br><br>
phase-changed between an amorphous phase and a crystalline<br>
phase by application of heat of laser beam irradiation and<br>
subsequent cooling. When, after a rapid heating treatment of a<br>
phase-change recording material, the phase-change recording<br>
material is immediately quenched, the phase-change recording<br>
material is changed into an amorphous phase, and when the<br>
phase-change recording material is slowly cooled after the rapid<br>
heating treatment, it is crystallized. These characteristics are<br>
applied for recording and reproducing information in<br>
phase-change optical recording media.<br>
Further, for the purpose of preventing oxidation,<br>
transpiration or deformation of a recording layer which are<br>
caused by application of heat for light beam irradiation, a<br>
phase-change optical recording medium is typically provided<br>
with an under protective layer (also called as an under dielectric<br>
layer) in between a substrate and a recording layer, and an<br>
upper protective layer (also called as an upper dielectric layer)<br>
in between the recording layer and a reflective layer. These<br>
protective layers can respectively function to control optical<br>
properties of the optical recording medium by adjusting the<br>
thickness thereof, and the under protective layer also has a<br>
function to prevent the substrate from softening due to heat<br>
applied to the recording layer during recording.<br>
In recent years, with increased information volume<br><br>
handled with computers, recording capacities of rewritable<br>
optical discs such as DVD-RAM, DVDRW and DVD+RW are<br>
largely increased, and high-density recording of information is<br>
advanced. DVD has a recording capacity of around 4.7GB,<br>
however, in the days to come, requests for high-density<br>
recording are further expected to increase. Along with<br>
increased information volume, it should be considered that<br>
enhancement of recording speed is also required. Presently, as<br>
a rewritable DVD disc, an optical recording medium with a<br>
single-recording layer that allows for 8X recording speed is<br>
commercially available. As a method for allowing for<br>
high-density recording using such a phase-change optical<br>
recording medium, for example, there have been proposals to<br>
shift a wavelength of a laser beam to be used toward shorter<br>
wavelengths to blue region or to enlarge the numerical aperture<br>
(NA) of an objective lens used for optical pick-up to record or<br>
reproduce information to thereby change the spot size of the<br>
laser beam applied to an optical recording medium to smaller,<br>
and these methods have been studied, developed and put into<br>
practical use.<br>
For a technique to increase recording capacity by<br>
improving an optical recording medium itself, various types of<br>
two-layered phase-change optical recording media are proposed<br>
that are produced such that two information layers each<br><br>
composed of at least a recording layer and a reflective layer are<br>
laid one on top of another on one surface of a substrate, and the<br>
two information layers are bonded together with an ultraviolet<br>
curable resin or the like. A separation layer (called an<br>
intermediate layer in the present invention) which is the bonded<br>
part between these information layers has a function to optically<br>
separate the two information layers and is composed of a<br>
material that less absorbs laser beam or avoid absorbing laser<br>
beam unnecessarily because the laser beam used for recording<br>
and reproducing needs to reach the innermost information layer<br>
as viewed from the laser irradiation side.<br>
There are still many problems existing in such a<br>
two-layered phase-change optical recording medium.<br>
For example, when an information layer (a first<br>
information layer) disposed at the front side as viewed from the<br>
laser beam irradiation side is not sufficiently transmissive to a<br>
laser beam, it is impossible to record and reproduce information<br>
on a recording layer of another information layer (a second<br>
information layer) disposed at the innermost side as viewed<br>
from the laser beam irradiation side, and thus a reflective layer<br>
constituting the first information layer must be a ultrathin<br>
semi-transparent reflective layer. As the result, it is difficult<br>
to obtain light transmittance and heat dissipation effect, and it<br>
is necessary to form a heat diffusion layer (a light transmissive<br><br>
layer) so as to make contact with the semi-transparent reflective<br>
layer to increase the light transmittance and supplement the<br>
heat dissipation effect. Further, as compared to conventional<br>
single-layer phase-change optical recording media or<br>
conventional two-layered recordable optical recording media, the<br>
reflectance of a two-layered phase-change optical recording<br>
medium is extremely low of about one third of that of each of<br>
these conventional media. Thus, it is considered that it may be<br>
difficult to record and reproduce information on the first<br>
information layer as well as on the second information layer<br>
even with stable tracking ability provided. Further, since the<br>
first information layer has a layer structure in which heat is<br>
hardly dissipated, from the perspective of storage stability, it is<br>
not conceivable that any materials may be used for the recording<br>
layer just because a phase-change material is used. Actually, it<br>
is necessary to limit materials and the composition of the<br>
recording layer for the first information layer.<br>
As a known technique, Patent Literature 1 discloses a<br>
two-layered phase-change optical recording medium provided<br>
with a substrate having a groove depth of 10 nm to 30 nm and<br>
using a laser beam having a wavelength of 360 nm to 420 nm,<br>
however, an upper protective layer in a first recording layer<br>
structure of the two-layered phase-change optical recording<br>
medium is composed of ZnS-SiO2, and the layer composition<br><br>
differs from that of the multi-layered phase-change optical<br>
recording medium of the present invention.<br>
Patent Literature 2 discloses an optical recording medium<br>
provided with a thermal diffusion layer containing an In oxide<br>
and an Sn oxide as the main components, in which the content of<br>
the In oxide is 90 mol% or more. Patent Literature 3 discloses<br>
an optical recording medium provided with a thermal diffusion<br>
layer containing an Sn oxide and an Sb oxide, and Patent<br>
Literature 4 discloses an optical recording medium provided<br>
with a thermal diffusion layer containing an In oxide and a Zn<br>
oxide as the main components, in which the content of the In<br>
oxide is 50% or more. However, these disclosed optical<br>
recording layer respectively have a different layer composition<br>
from that of the optical recording medium of the present<br>
invention, and there is no description on groove depth of the<br>
substrate, unlike the present invention.<br>
Patent Literature 5 discloses a two-layered recordable<br>
optical recording medium with recording layers composed of an<br>
organic dye or organic dyes, in which the range of the groove<br>
depth is 4XV16n to 7A./16n, however, the two-layered recordable<br>
optical recording medium can ensure a reflectance of about 20%,<br>
and the optical recording medium configuration basically differs<br>
from that of a two-layered phase-change optical recording<br>
medium, and the groove depth range also differs from that of a<br><br>
two-layered phase-change optical recording medium.<br>
Further, Patent Literature 6 describes a two-layered<br>
optical recording medium in its claim 8, however, the optical<br>
recording medium configuration is basically different from that<br>
of the two-layered phase-change optical recording medium of the<br>
present invention.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in<br>
detail.<br>
The present invention is a multi-layered phase-change<br>
optical recording medium having a plurality of information<br><br>
layers between a first substrate and a second substrate as<br>
described above, in which thermal diffusion layers (light<br>
transmissive layers) of respective information layers other than<br>
an information layer disposed at the innermost side as viewed<br>
from the laser beam irradiation side are composed on materials<br>
of an In oxide, a Zn oxide, an Sn oxide and an Si oxide and the<br>
content of these materials is set within a range specified in a<br>
first embodiment of the present invention, thereby the light<br>
transmittance of the respective information layers can be<br>
increased and the recording sensitivity of the respective<br>
information layers can be enhanced. As the result, the light<br>
reflectance at the information layer disposed at the innermost<br>
side as viewed from the laser beam irradiation side can be<br>
increased, and thus information can be reduced and reproduced<br>
with stable tracking ability. Here, a refractive index of the<br>
first and second substrates is represented as "n", the wavelength<br>
of a laser beam is represented as "X" and the depth of the groove<br>
depth of the first and second substrates is represented as "H".<br>
On a multi-layered phase-change optical recording medium<br>
having a low light reflectance, information can be recorded and<br>
reproduced with stable tracking ability by setting the groove<br>
depth of the guide groove H within a range specified in the first<br>
embodiment of the present invention to induce a phase change to<br>
reflected light beams from concave and convex portions of the<br><br>
guide groove (generally, concave portions are called "land<br>
portion" and convex portions are called "groove portion") and<br>
detecting the difference in quantity of reflected light beams.<br>
Respective refractive indexes "n" and respective groove depths<br>
"H" of the first and second substrates may be the same to each<br>
other or may be different to each other, however, typically they<br>
are respectively set to have the same value between the first<br>
substrate and the second substrate. It should be noted that a<br>
laser beam that can be used in the present invention has a<br>
wavelength X within a red wavelength region of 645 nm to 665<br>
nm. Details on material of the substrates will be described<br>
below, and typically, a polycarbonate having a refractive index<br>
"n" of 1.55 to 1.60 is used.<br>
FIG. 1 shows one example of a layer configuration of an<br>
optical recording medium having two layers of information layer<br>
each of which includes a phase-change recording layer.<br>
During rotation of an optical disc, an eccentric error of<br>
several ten micrometers occurs due to eccentricity and<br>
axis-variation etc. between the central hole and the track core of<br>
the optical disc. Particularly, as can be seen in a multi-layered<br>
optical recording medium, the eccentricity amount of an<br>
information layer that is distantly located from an optical<br>
pickup is usually greater than that of an information layer<br>
located at the front side as viewed from the optical pickup. For<br><br>
this reason, to constantly and accurately scan the information<br>
tracks with a laser beam spot, it is necessary to detect a<br>
tracking error with an optical pickup, drive a tracking actuator<br>
connected to a servo circuit and control a fine position of the<br>
object lens. Thus, designing of a groove depth formed on a<br>
substrate is particularly important to an optical recording<br>
medium having a low reflectance like a multi-layered<br>
phase-change optical recording medium.<br>
As typical examples of tracking error signals, push-pull<br>
signals are exemplified. A reflected light beam is picked up<br>
with an objective lens from a disc having a guide groove with a<br>
track pitch "p", and a push-pull signal can be detected with a<br>
photodiode split behind the objective lens. A periodically<br>
arrayed guide groove is a sort of diffraction grating, and in<br>
reflected lights, a zero-order light that goes straight on and a +<br>
first-order light that is diffracted at an angle 9 are generated.<br>
Here, 9 (theta) is represented by sin_1(A,/p). Among reflected<br>
lights to the objective lens, besides the zero-order light, part of<br>
the + first-order light is picked up with the objected lens. At a<br>
region where diffracted lights of the zero-order light and the<br>
first-order light are overlapped, interference of light is<br>
generated. The intensity of the lights varies due to track<br>
misalignment of a laser beam applied to the optical recording<br>
medium. A two-split photodiode (which may be a<br><br>
quadruple-detector photodiode though) separately detects a<br>
region where the zero-order light and the ± first-order light are<br>
overlapped to read a difference signal to thereby generate a<br>
tracking error signal. FIG. 2 shows intensity distributions of<br>
reflected lights. When the center of a laser beam is in accord<br>
with the center of a guide groove, the intensity distribution of<br>
reflected light is a symmetrical distribution and the respective<br>
output from the photodiode results in the equation, X = Y.<br>
When a tracking misalignment occurs, the intensity distribution<br>
of reflected light is an asymmetrical distribution and a value X<br>
is greater than a value Y. When a tracking error signal Z is<br>
defined as being equal to X - Y, i.e., Z = X - Y, the value Z is<br>
represented by the following equation.<br>
Z = 4(S1) (El)sin(<j>l)sin(27tAp/p)<br>
In the equation, SI represents an area in which the zero-order<br>
light and the first-order light are overlapped on a detector; EO<br>
and El respectively represent an amplitude of the zero-order<br>
light and an amplitude of the first-order light; represents a<br>
phase difference between the zero-order light and the first-order<br>
light; "p" represents a track pitch; and Ap represents a track<br>
misalignment amount. Since the tracking error signal Z has a<br>
value that depends on the tracking misalignment amount Ap and<br>
is an odd function, the value Z shows that the beam spot is<br>
misaligned in either the plus direction or minus direction.<br><br>
FIG. 3 shows a relation between a groove in an optical<br>
recording medium and tracking error. When the laser beam<br>
center is in accord with the groove center or the center of a land<br>
portion, the tracking error signal is zero. When the laser beam<br>
center is not in accord with the land center and the misaligned<br>
position between the laser beam center and the land center is at<br>
the inner position of the land portion or at the outer position of<br>
the land portion as viewed from the radius direction of the<br>
optical disc, the plus/minus sign of reflected light is reversed<br>
and the tracking misalignment amount and the plus or minus<br>
direction in the radius direction can be distinguished. And the<br>
tracking misalignment amount is used for a servo signal. When<br>
sin is a maximum value, the maximum amplitude of the<br>
tracking error signal Z can be obtained. When the groove shape<br>
is rectangular and the groove depth is ("n" is a refractive<br>
index of a substrate), the value is equal to and<br>
the maximum amplitude can be obtained. For this reason, the<br>
dqpth of a guide groove of an optical disc is often set at near<br>
λ/(8n) (see FIG. 4). However, optical properties and thermal<br>
transfer characteristic depending on the layer configuration of<br>
an optical recording medium affect recording properties of the<br>
optical recording medium, and the recording properties are also<br>
changed depending on the groove depth employed. Therefore, it<br>
is necessary in the present invention that each groove depth H<br><br>
of the first substrate and the second substrate be set to λ/(l7 x<br>
n) 
groove depth H of a first substrate and a second substrate to 0<br>
to λ/(4n), however, when the each groove depth is set within the<br>
range, it is difficult to satisfy both excellent recording<br>
properties and highly stable tracking accuracy with the use of a<br>
groove depth within the range. A higher push-pull signal<br>
amplitude means more excellent property. However, in view of<br>
a balance with recording properties, an excessively high<br>
push-pull signal amplitude is not always preferable. Thus,<br>
there is a need to design a groove depth taking into account both<br>
of the properties. The results of push-pull signal in the present<br>
invention was measured using a photodetector shown in FIG. 5<br>
based on the expression, [(la + lb] - (lc + Id)) / [la + lb + lc + Id].<br>
The first substrate needs to be transmissive to a light<br>
beam irradiated for recording and reproducing, and material<br>
conventionally known in the art can be used. Typically, glass,<br>
ceramics or resins are used for the first substrate, and resins<br>
are particularly preferable in terms of formability and cost.<br>
Examples of the resin include polycarbonate resins, acryl resins,<br>
epoxy resins, polystyrene resins, acrylonitrile-styrene copolymer<br>
resins, polyethylene resins, polypropylene resins, silicon resins,<br>
fluorine resins, ABS resins and urethane resins. Acryl resins<br>
such as polycarbonate resins and polymethyl methacrylate<br><br>
(PMMA) are preferable because they are excellent in formability,<br>
optical properties and cost.<br>
A surface of the first substrate with information layers<br>
formed thereon has a helical or concentric wobbled groove, and a<br>
convexo-concave pattern called land portion and groove portion<br>
is formed thereon. Typically, a groove is transcribed on a<br>
substrate surface using a stamper attached in a die by injection<br>
molding method or a photopolymer method, thereby the<br>
substrate surface is formed. The thickness of the first<br>
substrate is preferably about 10 μm to 590 μm.<br>
For material of the second substrate, the same material<br>
as the one used for the first substrate may be used, or a<br>
material that is opaque to recording and reproducing light beam<br>
may be used, or the material and groove shape of the second<br>
substrate may differ from those for the first substrate. The<br>
thickness of the second substrate is not particularly limited,<br>
however, it is preferable to adjust the thickness so that the total<br>
thickness of the first and second substrates is 1.2 mm.<br>
For a thermal diffusion layer (light transmissive layer),<br>
there are known techniques using ITO[In2O3 (main components)<br>
- SnO2] prepared by mixing an In oxide and an Sn oxide or using<br>
IZO[In2O3 (main components) - ZnO] as a thermal diffusion<br>
layer material of conventional optical discs, however, an In<br>
oxide-rich material is highly expensive, and the use of an In<br><br>
oxide_rich material is problematic in terms of production cost.<br>
In addition, in the course of development of an optical recording<br>
medium with the use of an In oxide_rich material, it was found<br>
that the first information layer cannot have a sufficient light<br>
transmittance and the recording sensitivity of the first<br>
information layer is degraded because of its high thermal<br>
conductivity. Therefore, to increase the light transmittance of<br>
the first information layer and increase the light reflectance of<br>
the second information layer to thereby enhance tracking<br>
accuracy while ensuring a proper thermal conductivity value,<br>
there is a need to find out a material having a high sputtering<br>
rate and allowing for ensuring recording properties and<br>
recording sensitivity, separately from ITO and IZO which have<br>
been conventionally used for thermal diffusion layers.<br>
Then, the present inventors studied a mixture of oxides<br>
having a higher light transmittance on a thermal diffusion layer<br>
(light transmissive layer) and enabling to more efficiently<br>
enhance recording sensitivity than IZO and ITO. Consequently,<br>
the study result showed that there is a need to mix an In oxide,<br>
a Zn oxide, an Sn oxide and an Si oxide at the following<br>
composition ratio when the respective contents of the In oxide,<br>
An oxide, Sn oxide and Si oxide are represented by a, b, c and d<br>
[moI%].<br>
3 
 <br>
0 
a+b+c+d= 100<br>
Use of an In oxide of less than 3 mol% is unfavorable<br>
because a sufficient thermal conductivity cannot be obtained and<br>
the obtained thermal diffusion layer is hardly sputtered because<br>
of decreased electrical conductivity. When the content of In<br>
oxide is more than 50 mol%, a high light transmittance cannot<br>
be ensured and the cost is very expensive. Furthermore, the<br>
recording sensitivity of the first information layer is degraded<br>
due to the high thermal conductivity. Use of an Si oxide within<br>
the above-noted range is preferable because it can improve<br>
repetitive recording durability of the first information layer.<br>
The preferred content ratio for a Zn oxide and an Sn oxide is not<br>
particularly limited, however, when either material is highly<br>
contained, the sputtering rate tends to be high. These oxides<br>
respectively have a high electrical conductivity and allows for<br>
DC (direct current) sputtering, and thus when a thermal<br>
diffusion layer (light transmissive layer) having a layer<br>
thickness of around 60 nm is formed, the layer can be formed in<br>
a short time. Further, by reducing the content of an In oxide, it<br>
is possible to increase the light transmittance of the first<br>
information layer and further to enhance recording sensitivity<br>
thereof (see FIG. 20). All of the four types of oxides are<br>
materials that do not accelerate deterioration of reflective<br><br>
layers.<br>
FIG. 6 shows measurement results of light transmittance<br>
of a first information layer of an optical recording medium which<br>
was prepared in the same manner as an optical recording<br>
medium produced in Example 1, which will be described<br>
hereinafter, except that material of the thermal diffusion layer<br>
(light transmissive layer) used in Example 1 was changed to IZO.<br>
It clearly shows that the optical recording medium of Example 1<br>
has a higher light transmittance than the optical recording<br>
medium using IZO for the thermal diffusion layer.<br>
The layer thickness of the thermal diffusion layer (light<br>
transmissive layer) is preferably within a range of 40 nm to 80<br>
nm. When the thermal diffusion layer thickness is thinner<br>
than 40 nm, heat dissipation ability is degraded and repetitive<br>
use durability of the optical recording medium degrades. When<br>
thicker than 80 nm, it is unfavorable because the light<br>
transmittance is decreased.<br>
The thermal diffusion layer (light transmissive layer)<br>
mentioned above can be formed by various vapor growth<br>
methods such as vacuum evaporation method, sputtering method,<br>
plasma CVD method, photo-CVD method, ion plating method and<br>
electron beam deposition method. Of these, sputtering method<br>
is excellent in mass-productivity, film quality and the like.<br>
The intermediate layer preferably has small light<br><br>
absorption coefficient to light of wavelengths irradiated for<br>
recording and reproducing information. For materials of the<br>
intermediate layer, resins are preferably used in terms of<br>
formability and cost, and ultraviolet (UV) curable resins,<br>
delayed resins, thermoplastic resins etc. can be used.<br>
The intermediate layer is the one that enables an optical<br>
pickup to identify the first information layer and the second<br>
information layer to optically separate them, and the thickness<br>
of the intermediate layer is preferably 10 μm to 70 μm. When<br>
the thickness of the intermediate layer is thinner than 10 μm,<br>
cross-talk phenomenon occurs between information layers.<br>
When thicker than 70 μm, spherical aberration occurs when<br>
information is recorded or reproduced on the second information<br>
layer, and it tends to be difficult to record and reproduce<br>
information.<br>
Development on conventional materials for recording<br>
layers is broadly divided into two streams. One stream<br>
includes GeTe which is a material used for recordable recording<br>
layers," Sb2Te3, i.e., an alloy between Sb and Te, which is<br>
reversibly phase-changeable; and a recording layer material<br>
consisting of a ternary alloy of GeSbTe prepared from a solid<br>
solution or an eutectic composition of the above-noted two<br>
materials. Another stream include recording layer materials<br>
composed of an alloy between Sb and Te similarly to the above,<br><br>
however, the alloy is an eutectic composition of Sb and Sb2Te3 in<br>
which a trace amount of elements is added to SbTe having a Sb<br>
content of around 70%.<br>
In an optical recording medium having multiple recording<br>
layers, particularly an information layer disposed at the front<br>
side as viewed from the laser beam irradiation side is required<br>
to have a high light transmittance in consideration of recording<br>
and reproducing an information layer disposed at the innermost<br>
side as viewed from the laser irradiation side. To meet the<br>
need, it is necessary to make recording layers thin in parallel<br>
with efforts to reducing light absorbance of metal layers. A<br>
thinner layer thickness of a recording layer reduces a<br>
crystallization rate thereof, therefore, it is advantageous to<br>
select a recording layer material itself having a high<br>
crystallization rate. Then, among the two streams of the<br>
materials for recording layers, the latter material, i.e., a SbTe<br>
eutectic composition containing Sb at around 70% is preferable<br>
to the former material.<br>
However, according to studies by present inventors, it<br>
was found that when the content of Sb is increased to achieve a<br>
higher crystallization rate, i.e., to achieve a higher linear<br>
velocity, the crystallization temperature was decreased and the<br>
storage stability of the optical recording medium was degraded.<br>
In a multi-layered phase-change optical recording<br><br>
medium, when an information layer disposed at the innermost<br>
side as viewed from the laser beam irradiation side is<br>
reproduced, there is a problem that the amplitude of<br>
reproducing signals is low because of its low reflectance which is<br>
attributable to light absorption or the like of an information<br>
layer disposed at the front side as viewed from the laser beam<br>
irradiation side. Taking the problem into account, a higher<br>
reproducing light power is required than in reproducing an<br>
optical recording medium having a single recording layer.<br>
In use of the SbTe material, to achieve a high<br>
crystallization rate, it requires only to increase the Sb content,<br>
however, it causes a decreasing trend of the crystallization rate.<br>
Therefore, when information is reproduced on an information<br>
layer using SbTe disposed at the front side as viewed from the<br>
laser beam irradiation side with a high reproducing light power,<br>
it may cause a problem that amorphous marks are<br>
re-crystallized and cannot be reproduced. It is also unfavorable<br>
because a decreased crystallization temperature triggers an<br>
unstable storage condition. Then, a crystallization rate can be<br>
kept high at information layers by adding a third element Ge to<br>
SbTe material, thereby it is possible to maintain an optical<br>
recording medium stable during storage without causing<br>
re-crystallization of amorphous marks even when reproducing<br>
information with a high reproducing light power.<br><br>
For a phase-change recording material allowing for<br>
obtaining excellent recording properties, reproducing<br>
information with a high reproducing light power and stabilizing<br>
the storage condition, used for phase-change recording layers of<br>
a multi-layered phase-change optical recording medium,<br>
materials containing at least three elements of GeSbTe are<br>
preferable.<br>
Further, other elements may be added to the GeSbTe<br>
ternary material. For the additive elements, Ag and In are<br>
preferable, and they are typically used for storage stability.<br>
The composition ratio of the total additive elements is<br>
preferably set to 8 atomic% or less. When the composition ratio<br>
is more than 8 atomic%, the crystallization rate of the recording<br>
layer is slow, although the storage stability is enhanced,<br>
resulting in a difficulty in recording at high speed. Further, it<br>
is unfavorable because stability of recorded condition to a<br>
reproducing light is degraded.<br>
As defined in the item , i.e, a second embodiment of<br>
the present invention, when the Sb content (p) is within the<br>
range of 60 
material, Sb material allows for recording and reproducing<br>
information in a stable manner. When the Sb content (p) is less<br>
than 60 atomic%, information cannot be record and reproduced<br>
in a stable manner, and further, as a multi-layered phase-change<br><br>
optical recording medium, it may result in a recording layer that<br>
is not suited for high-speed recording. With the use of a Sb<br>
content more than 75 atomic%, the crystallization temperature<br>
is decreased and it is difficult to reproduce information with a<br>
high reproducing light power, resulting in an unstable storage<br>
condition, although the crystallization rate is increased.<br>
Te has a function to accelerate generation of an<br>
amorphous condition and to increase the crystallization<br>
temperature. However, when combining only Te singularly with<br>
Sb, these is a possibility that recorded amorphous marks are<br>
lost due to long-term storage or storage at high temperature<br>
because of the insufficient temperature increasing rate of the<br>
crystallization temperature and poor stability of the amorphous<br>
phase, although it is possible to adjust the crystallization rate<br>
utilizing the amorphousis-accelerating effect. In contrast, use<br>
of a combination of Te with Ge have advantages in that stability<br>
of amorphous phase can be ensured by using Ge and stability of<br>
a crystalline phase can also be enhanced. Generally, a<br>
crystallized condition is a highly stable condition, however, in<br>
the case of a material used for high-speed recording taken up<br>
here, the crystallization progresses at high speed at the time of<br>
initialization or recording, and thus it cannot be necessarily<br>
said that a formed crystallized condition is stable. For this<br>
reason, when information is recorded again after long-term<br><br>
storage or storage at high temperature, it causes a problem that<br>
recording properties and recording conditions are changed from<br>
the condition before storage. The reason is considered that the<br>
crystallized condition is changed by storage from the<br>
crystallized condition before storage. However, an addition of<br>
Te to materials for recording layer can reduce such variation of<br>
recording properties and recording conditions caused by storage.<br>
To obtain an effect of reducing variation of recording<br>
properties and recording conditions before and after storage by<br>
improving stability of crystal as described above, it is desirable<br>
to add Te at 6 atomic% or more (6 
large amount of Te addition causes a too slow crystallization<br>
rate, causing a loss of ability to repeatedly record information at<br>
high speed. When Te is used for the first recording layer of the<br>
multi-layered phase-change optical recording medium of the<br>
present invention, it is preferable to set the Te amount to 30<br>
atomic% or less (γ 
Further, use of a Ge (a) amount within a range of 2 
20 (atomic%) enables to reproduce information with<br>
high-reproducing light power and ensures an excellent storage<br>
condition. Addition of a Ge amount of less than 2 atomic%, the<br>
effect of Ge addition cannot be obtained and an excellent storage<br>
condition cannot be obtained. In contrast, addition of a Ge<br>
amount of more than 20 atomic%, the recording sensitivity is<br><br>
degraded because of its high-melting point of the Ge itself,<br>
although stability with a reproducing light and storage stability<br>
are highly maintained because the crystallization temperature<br>
can be set high.<br>
The layer thickness of the first recording layer is<br>
preferably within a range of 4 nm to 10 nm. When the first<br>
recording layer has a layer thickness less than 4 nm, signal<br>
quality is degraded due to an excessively low reflectance, and<br>
the repetitive recording properties are degraded. When thicker<br>
than 10 nm, it is unfavorable because the light transmittance is<br>
decreased. The layer thickness of the second recording layer is<br>
preferably within a range of 10 nm to 20 nm. When the second<br>
recording layer has a layer thickness less than 10 nm, the<br>
repetitive recording properties are degraded, and when thicker<br>
than 20 nm, the recording sensitivity is degraded.<br>
In a third embodiment of the present invention, when the<br>
upper protective layers of respective information layers other<br>
than the information layer disposed at the innermost side as<br>
viewed from the first substrate side contains an In oxide, a Zn<br>
oxide, an Sn oxide and an Si oxide or a Ta oxide and each of<br>
contents of the In oxide, Zn oxide, Sn oxide and Si oxide or Ta<br>
oxide is represented as e, f, g and h [mol%], the following<br>
requirements are satisfied:<br>
3 
 <br>
50 
0 
e + f + g+ h = 100<br>
Use of a composition satisfying all the expressions stated<br>
above is preferable because it enables to increase recording<br>
speed by containing a Zn oxide or an Sn oxide at 50 mol% or<br>
more in the upper protective layers to thereby accelerate<br>
crystallization of the recording layers. An alternative property<br>
to crystallization rate is transition linear velocity. Transition<br>
liner velocity is a linear velocity, specifically, when a reflectance<br>
of a recording layer after being irradiated with a light beam<br>
continuously is monitored at a constant linear velocity,<br>
transition linear velocity means a linear velocity at which the<br>
reflectance starts changing. In FIG. 7, the transition linear<br>
velocity is 21m/s. Generally, a faster transition linear velocity<br>
increases the recording speed. In FIG. the continuous light<br>
power is set at 15mW.<br>
As shown in FIG. 8, by containing a Zn oxide or an Sn<br>
oxide at 50 mol% or more in an upper protective layer, a DOW10<br>
jitter value of lower than 9% can be realized, and excellent jitter<br>
property can be obtained at high-speed recording.<br>
Further, as shown in FIG. 9, when the content of a Zn<br>
oxide or an Sn oxide is set at 90 mol% or less in an upper<br>
protective layer, it is preferable because variation of DOW10<br><br>
jitter value can be suppressed to 1% or less and the storage<br>
stability is improved. When the content of a Zn oxide or an Sn<br>
oxide is 90 mol% or more, excellent storage reliability cannot be<br>
obtained.<br>
For a material used for an upper protective layer in a<br>
conventional single-layer phase-change optical recording<br>
medium, the upper protective layer is preferably formed of a<br>
material that is transparent, transmissive to light, has a higher<br>
melting point than the recording layer and has functions to<br>
prevent deterioration of the recording layer, to enhance the<br>
bonding strength with the recording layer and enhance the<br>
recording properties. It has been known that particularly<br>
ZnS-SiO2 is preferably used for upper protective layer, and for<br>
the mixture ratio, ZnS"SiC&gt;2 = 80^20 (molar ratio) is most<br>
preferable.<br>
However, in the case of a multi-layered phase-change<br>
recording medium, when recording information on a first<br>
recording layer, the heat dissipation property of the first<br>
recording layer is degraded because of the thin thickness of the<br>
first reflective layer to cause a problem that there is a difficulty<br>
in recording. To avoid the problem, it is preferable to use a<br>
material having excellent thermal conductivity. When<br>
ZnS-SiO2is used for the first upper protective layer, the<br>
recording properties are degraded because of the low thermal<br><br>
conductivity and the storage stability after recording is poor,<br>
and thus ZnS"SiO2 is not suitable for the first upper protective<br>
layer in a multi-layered phase-change optical recording medium.<br>
FIG. 10 shows a result of measuring a DOW10 jitter variation<br>
obtained when a phase-change optical recording medium of<br>
Example 1 to be hereinafter described and another phase-change<br>
optical recording medium prepared in the same manner as in<br>
Example 1 except that material of the first upper protective<br>
layer was changed to ZnS-SiO2 (80:20 mol%) were stored at 80oC<br>
and a relative humidity (RH) of 85% for 100 hours. The result<br>
shown in FIG. 10 demonstrated that in the optical recording<br>
medium using ZnS"SiO2, the jitter variation was not reduced<br>
irrespective to the layer thickness.<br>
Summarizing above-mentioned results, it is preferable to<br>
use a Zn oxide and an Sn oxide having higher heat dissipation<br>
property than ZnSSiO2. When either Zn oxide or Sn oxide is<br>
used as simple material, excellent storage stability cannot be<br>
obtained. Therefore, an In oxide and an Si oxide or a Ta oxide<br>
are preferably contained therein. When these metal oxides are<br>
used for a first information layer of a multi-layered<br>
phase-change optical recording medium, high light<br>
transmittance, excellent recording properties and storage<br>
stability can be obtained because these metal oxides are<br>
transparent to light and have high thermal conductivity.<br><br>
Since a first upper protective layer formed using these<br>
metal oxides can ensure a sufficient modulation degree and a<br>
sufficient reflectance with a thin layer of around 5 nm, (in, Zn,<br>
Sn) oxides, which can be sputtered by RF sputtering or DC<br>
sputtering, plus Si oxide may be used. When the use amount of<br>
Sn oxide or Zn oxide is large in a first upper protective layer,<br>
the crystallization rate of the recording layer is accelerated, and<br>
thus the recording speed can be increased.<br>
For the second upper protective layer, ZnS"SiO2 may be<br>
used as usual. The reason is that when information is recorded<br>
on the second recording layer, sufficient heat dissipation<br>
property can be obtained because the second reflective layer can<br>
be thickly formed. However, when ZnS-SiC*2 is used for the<br>
second upper protective layer and Ag is use for the second<br>
reflective layer, it is preferable that an interface layer formed of<br>
TiOTi02 is inserted in between the second upper protective<br>
layer and the second reflective layer.<br>
The layer thickness of the first upper protective layer is<br>
preferably in a range of 2 nm to 15 nm. When the first upper<br>
protective layer has a thickness thinner than 2 nm, the<br>
modulation degree is reduced due to excessively high light<br>
transmittance, and when thicker than 15 nm, it is unfavorable<br>
because the light transmittance is lowered, heat hardly escapes,<br>
and thus the recording properties are degraded.<br><br>
The layer thickness of the second upper protective layer<br>
is preferably within a range of 3 nm to 30 nm. When the second<br>
upper protective layer has a thickness thinner than 3 nm, the<br>
recording properties are degraded, and when thicker than 30 nm,<br>
heat easily stays at the second upper protective layer, resulting<br>
in degraded recording properties.<br>
In a fourth embodiment of the present invention, Cu is<br>
used as the main component for semi-transparent reflective<br>
layers of information layers other than that of an information<br>
layer disposed at the innermost side as viewed from the laser<br>
irradiation side. This configuration enables enhancing<br>
recording properties and storage stability of the first recording<br>
layer. Here, the term "main component" means that Cu is<br>
contained at 95% by weight or more. The reason why the first<br>
reflective layer containing Cu as the main component is<br>
preferable is described below.<br>
In a phase-change optical recording medium having two<br>
layers of recording layer as shown in FIG. 1, a second<br>
information layer needs to be irradiated with as much light as<br>
possible using a recording and reproducing laser light.<br>
Therefore, a material that hardly absorbs laser light and is<br>
easily transmissive to laser light is preferably used for the first<br>
reflective layer.<br><br>
Then, the present inventors measured optical properties<br>
for various types of reflective layers at a wavelength of 660 nm.<br>
Here, data of A (absorbance), R (reflectance) and T (light<br>
transmittance) was obtained. For measurement samples,<br>
polycarbonate substrates each having a thickness of 0.6 mm and<br>
covered with various metal films having a layer thickness of 10<br>
nm formed were used. The results are shown in FIG. 11. From<br>
the results, it can be assumed that Pt, Pd and Ti are unsuitable<br>
for a first reflective layer because these materials have a low<br>
light transmittance and a high light absorbance.<br>
Next, Cu and Ag, which has a relatively high light<br>
transmittance and a relatively low absorbance, were respectively<br>
formed on a polycarbonate substrate, A (absorbance), R<br>
(reflectance) and T (light transmittance) were measured at a<br>
wavelength of 660 nm while varying the layer thickness, the<br>
results as shown in FIG. 12 (Cu) and FIG. 13 (Ag) were obtained.<br>
The measurement results showed that Ag has greater variations<br>
by layer thickness than Cu. This shows that Cu has more<br>
excellent stability of optical constant to layer thickness of a<br>
layer formed.<br>
Further, FIG. 14 shows the measurement results of<br>
spectral transmittance when Ag and Cu were formed to be 8 nm<br>
in thickness. The results showed that light transmittance lines<br>
of Ag and Cu cross at a wavelength range of around 450 nm.<br><br>
These facts showed that Cu has a higher light<br>
transmittance than Ag in a wavelength range longer than 450<br>
nm or so, and Cu is preferably used to a laser light having a<br>
wavelength of around 660 nm for the first reflective layer.<br>
Further, in respective recording media using Cu, Ag or<br>
Au for each of the first reflective layers, a 3T single pattern was<br>
recorded on the first recording layer at a wavelength of 660 nm,<br>
and the C/N ratio was measured. The results are shown in FIG.<br>
15. The highest C/N ratio was obtained when using Cu. From<br>
the perspective of recording properties, Cu is also shown to be<br>
suitable for the first reflective layer. Note that respective plots<br>
shown in FIG.14 are the ones that a plurality of experimental<br>
data units is arranged along the horizontal axis.<br>
The second reflective layer is not necessarily<br>
semi-transparent, like the first reflective layer.<br>
The layer thickness of the first reflective layer is<br>
preferably within a range of 6 nm to 12 nm. When the layer<br>
thickness is thinner than 6 nm, signal quality is degraded due to<br>
the excessively low reflectance, and repetitive recording<br>
property is degraded because the heat dissipation property is<br>
degraded. When thicker than 12 nm, it is unfavorable because<br>
the light transmittance is lowered.<br>
The layer thickness of the second reflective layer is<br>
preferably within a range of 100 nm to 200 nm. When the layer<br><br>
thickness is thinner than 100 nm, sufficient heat dissipation<br>
property cannot be obtained and then repetitive recording<br>
property is degraded, and when the layer thickness thicker than<br>
200 nm, a layer having a wasteful thickness is formed, although<br>
the heat dissipation property is unchanged, and mechanical<br>
property of the recording medium itself is degraded.<br>
The first semi-transparent reflective layer and the<br>
second reflective layer as described above can be formed by<br>
various vapor deposition methods, for example, vacuum<br>
evaporation method, sputtering method, plasma CVD method,<br>
optical CVD method, ion-plating method and electron beam<br>
deposition method. Of these, sputtering method is excellent in<br>
mass productivity and layer quality and the like.<br>
The first lower protective layer and the second lower<br>
protective layer are preferably formed of a material that is<br>
transparent, is transmissive to light and having a higher<br>
melting point than the recording layer and has functions to<br>
prevent deterioration of the recording layer, to enhance the<br>
bonding strength with the recording layer and enhance the<br>
recording properties. Metal oxides, nitrides, sulfides and<br>
carbides are mainly used. Specific examples thereof include<br>
metal oxides such as SiO, SiO2, ZnO, SnO2, A12O3, TiO2, ln2O3,<br>
MgO and ZrO2; nitrides such as Si3N4, AIN, TiN, BN and ZrN;<br>
sulfides such as ZnS, In2S3 and TaS4.' carbides such as SiC, TaC,<br><br>
B4C, WC, TiC and ZrC; diamond carbons or mixtures thereof.<br>
Each of these materials may be used alone or in combination<br>
with two or more. Further, each of these materials may contain<br>
impurities in accordance with necessity. For example, a<br>
mixture of ZnS with SiO2 and a mixture of Ta2O5 with SiO2 are<br>
exemplified. Particularly, ZnS-SiC&gt;2 is often used, and the<br>
mixture ratio of ZnS:SiO2 = 80:20 is most preferable. This<br>
material is capable of increasing light absorption efficiency of<br>
recording layers because it has a high refractive index n and an<br>
extinction coefficient of nearly zero, and this material can<br>
appropriately suppress diffusion of heat generated by light<br>
absorption because of its small thermal conductivity, and thus<br>
the use of ZnS:SiC&gt;2 enables to raise the temperature of<br>
recording layers to a temperature at which the recording layers<br>
can be melted.<br>
The layer thickness of the first lower protective layer is<br>
preferably within a range of 40 nm to 80 nm. When the first<br>
lower protective layer has a thickness thinner than 40 nm, it is<br>
unfavorable because the repetitive recording durability and<br>
recording properties are degraded and the light transmittance is<br>
lowered. When thicker than 80 nm, it is unfavorable because<br>
the light transmittance is lowered. The layer thickness is more<br>
preferably within a range of 60 nm to 80 nm. By adjusting the<br>
layer thickness of the first lower protective layer within the<br><br>
above-mentioned range, the repetitive recording durability is<br>
greatly enhanced.<br>
The layer thickness of the second lower protective layer<br>
is preferably within a range of 110 nm to 160 nm. When the<br>
second lower protective layer has a thickness thinner than 110<br>
nm, the reflectance of light from the second information layer is<br>
lowered, resulting in degraded reproducing signal quality and<br>
degraded repetitive recording durability. When thicker than<br>
160 nm, the reflectance of light from the second information<br>
layer is lowered, resulting in degraded reproducing signal<br>
quality and degraded mechanical property of the recording<br>
medium itself.<br>
The first and the second upper protective layers and the<br>
first and second lower protective layers described above can be<br>
formed by various vapor deposition methods, for example,<br>
vacuum evaporation method, sputtering method, plasma CVD<br>
method, optical CVD method, ion-plating method and electron<br>
beam deposition method. Of these, sputtering method is<br>
excellent in mass productivity and layer quality and the like.<br>
A two-layered phase-change optical recording medium<br>
according to the present invention can be typically produced<br>
through a layer forming step, an initialization step and a<br>
bonding step.<br><br>
In. the layer forming step, a first information layer is<br>
formed on a surface of a first substrate (see FIG. l) with a<br>
groove formed thereon, and a second information layer is formed<br>
on a surface of a second substrate with a groove formed thereon.<br>
The first information layer and the second information layer can<br>
be formed by various vapor deposition methods, for example,<br>
vacuum evaporation method, sputtering method, plasma CVD<br>
method, optical CVD method, ion-plating method and electron<br>
beam deposition method. Of these, sputtering method is<br>
excellent in mass productivity and layer quality and the like.<br>
In a sputtering method, a layer is formed with streaming an<br>
inactive gas such as argon, and at this point in time, the layer<br>
may be reactively sputtered while incorporating oxygen and<br>
nitrogen etc.<br>
In the initialization step, the entire surface of the optical<br>
recording medium is initialized by irradiating the first<br>
information layer and the second information layer with energy<br>
light such as laser light, i.e, the recording layers are<br>
crystallized. When there is a possibility that a film floats by<br>
laser light energy during initialization step, the first<br>
information layer and the second information layer may be<br>
spin-coated with a UV curable resin etc. before the initialization<br>
step and then cured by irradiating with ultraviolet ray so as to<br>
be overcoated. Further, after the bonding step to be described<br><br>
below is preliminarily carried out, the first information layer<br>
and the second information layer may be initialized from the<br>
first substrate side.<br>
In the bonding step, the first substrate and the second<br>
substrate are bonded together via an intermediate layer in a<br>
condition where the first information layer faces the second<br>
information layer. For example, a UV curable resin is applied<br>
to any one of the layer surfaces of the first information layer<br>
and the second information layer, the both substrates are<br>
pressurized and bonded in the condition where the first<br>
information layer surface and the second information layer<br>
surface face to each other, and the ultraviolet curable resin is<br>
irradiated with an ultraviolet ray to thereby cure the UV<br>
curable resin.<br>
A three-layered phase-change optical recording medium<br>
having three information layers is produced basically in the<br>
same manner as in the two-layered phase-change optical<br>
recording medium stated above, however, since the number of<br>
information layers is increased by one, it is produced, for<br>
example, in the order of the following steps.<br>
First, in a first layer forming step, a first information<br>
layer is formed on a first substrate, and a third information<br>
layer is formed on a second substrate.<br><br>
Next, in an intermediate layer forming step, a second<br>
intermediate layer is formed on the third information layer.<br>
Next, in a second layer forming step, a second<br>
information layer is formed on the second intermediate layer.<br>
Next, in a bonding step, the first substrate and the<br>
second substrate are bonded together via a first intermediate<br>
layer in a condition where the first information layer and the<br>
second information layer face to each other.<br>
Subsequently, in an initialization step, the first<br>
information layer to the third information layer are initialized<br>
in the same manner as in the two-layered phase-change optical<br>
recording medium.<br>
The present invention can provide a multi-layered<br>
phase-change optical recording medium having excellent<br>
repetitive recording durability and excellent storage stability, in<br>
which respective information layers other than an information<br>
layer disposed at the innermost side as viewed from the laser<br>
beam irradiation side are made to have a high light<br>
transmittance to allow for recording and reproducing<br>
information on the respecting information layers with stable<br>
tracking accuracy.<br><br>
Examples<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be further<br>
described in detail referring to specific Examples, however, the<br>
present invention is not limited to the disclosed Examples.<br>
For an evaluation apparatus, ODU1000 manufactured by<br>
PULSTEC INDUSTRIAL CO., LTD was used. A laser<br>
wavelength used to irradiate recording layers at the time of<br>
recording was 660 nm, and a numerical aperture (NA) of an<br>
objective lens was 0.65. A recording linear velocity used at the<br>
time of recording was 9.2 m/s, and recorded information was<br>
reproduced with a reproducing light power of 1.2 mW. For a<br>
light waveform generation unit, MSG3A manufactured by<br>
PULSTEC INDUSTRIAL CO., LTD was used. As to recording<br>
method, for a first information layer (L0 layer) disposed at the<br>
front side as viewed from the laser beam irradiation side, IT<br>
cycle recording strategy was used , and for a second information<br>
layer (LI layer) disposed at the innermost side as viewed from<br>
the laser beam irradiation side, 2T cycle recording strategy was<br>
used. The recording strategies used in the test are shown in<br>
FIG. 16 and FIG. 17, and parameters used in the test are shown<br>
in Tables 7-A and 7B. The wording "el" shown in Tables 7-A<br>
and 7-B represents a ratio (Pe/Pw) of an erasing power Pe to a<br>
recording power Pw. In FIG. 17, "dTx" is expressed as a<br>
positive value when leading to the related clock edge, and is<br><br>
expressed as a negative value when lagging to the related clock<br>
edge.<br>
(Example 1)<br>
On a first substrate composed of a polycarbonate resin<br>
having a diameter of 12 cm, a thickness of 0.575 mm, and having<br>
convexoxoncaves (groove depth-' A./11.5n)(n= 1.55) of a tracking<br>
guide formed with a serpentine continuous groove with a track<br>
pitch of 0.74 μm and having a groove width of convex portions<br>
(groove) of 0.25 urn on one surface thereof, a first lower<br>
protective layer composed of ZnS-SiO2 (80 : 20 (mol%)) having a<br>

an Ar flow rate of 35 seem.<br>
Next, on the first recording layer, a first upper protective<br>
layer composed of In203-ZnO-SnO2-Ta2O5 (7.5 : 22.5 : 60 : 10<br>
(mol%)) having a layer thickness of 5 nm was formed by RF<br>
magnetron sputtering method under the conditions of a<br>
sputtering power of lkW and an Ar flow rate of 15 seem.<br><br>
Next, on the first upper protective layer, a first<br>
semi-transparent reflective layer composed of Cu-Mo (l.l mol%)<br>
having a layer thickness of 8 nm was formed by DC magnetron<br>
sputtering method under the conditions of a sputtering power of<br>
0.5 kW and an Ar flow rate of 20 seem.<br>
Next, on the first semi-transparent reflective layer, a<br>
thermal diffusion layer composed of In203"ZnO-Sn02'SiO2 (8.8 -<br>
41.7 : 35.2 : 14.3 (mol%)) having a layer thickness of 65 nm was<br>
formed by DC magnetron sputtering method under the<br>
conditions of a sputtering power of 2kW and an Ar flow rate of<br>
15 seem to thereby form a first information layer (L0 layer).<br>
In the meanwhile, on a second substrate composed of a<br>
polycarbonate resin having a diameter of 12 cm, a thickness of<br>
0.6 mm, and having convexo-concaves (groove depth- AV11.5n)<br>
(n= 1.55) of a tracking guide formed with a serpentine<br>
continuous groove with a track pitch of 0.74 μm and having a<br>
groove width of convex portions (groove) of 0.24 μm on one<br>
surface thereof, a second reflective layer composed of Ag having<br>
a layer thickness of 40 nm was formed by DC magnetron<br>
sputtering method under the conditions of a sputtering power of<br>
3kW and an Ar flow rate of 15 seem.<br>
Next, on the second reflective layer, an interface layer<br>
composed of TiC"TiO2 (70 - 30 (mol%)) having a layer thickness<br>
of 4 nm was formed by DC magnetron sputtering method under<br><br>
the conditions of a sputtering power of 2kW and an Ar flow rate<br>
of 15 seem.<br>
Next, on the interface layer, a second upper protective<br>
layer composed of ZnS"SiO2 (80 : 20 mol%) having a layer<br>
thickness of 20 nm was formed by RF magnetron sputtering<br>
method under the conditions of a sputtering power of 1.5 kW and<br>
an Ar flow rate of 15 seem.<br>
Next, on the second upper protective layer, a second<br>
recording layer composed of Ago.2ln3.5Sb71.4Te21.4Ge3.5 having a<br>
layer thickness of 15 nm was formed by DC magnetron<br>
sputtering method under the conditions of a sputtering power of<br>
0.4 kW and an Ar flow rate of 35 seem.<br>
Next, on the second recording layer, a second lower<br>
protective layer composed of ZnS"SiO2 (80 : 20 mol%) having a<br>
layer thickness of 140 nm was fromed by RF magnetron<br>
sputtering method under the conditions of a sputtering power of<br>
4kW and an Ar flow rate of 15 seem to thereby form a second<br>
information layer (LI layer).<br>
For a sputtering apparatus, DVD SPRINTER<br>
manufactured by Unaxis Japan Co., Ltd. was used.r<br>
Next, an ultraviolet curable resin (KARAYAD DVD802,<br>
manufactured by Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd.) was applied over the<br>
layer surface of the first information layer, the layer surface of<br>
the second information layer was bonded to the layer surface of<br><br>
the first information layer, and the first information layer and<br>
the second information layer were bonded by spin-coating.<br>
Then, the ultraviolet curable resin was irradiated with an<br>
ultraviolet ray for curing to form an intermediate layer having a<br>
layer thickness of 50 μm, thereby a two-layered phase-change<br>
optical recording medium having two information layers as<br>
shown in FIG. 1 was prepared.<br>
Next, the two-layered phase-change optical recording<br>
medium was irradiated with a laser beam in the order of the<br>
second information layer and the first information layer to<br>
initialize the information layers. The first recording layer and<br>
the second recording layer were initialized by converging a laser<br>
beam emitted from a semiconductor laser (emission wavelength<br>
810 ± 10 nm) onto the recording layers by an optical pickup (NA<br>
= 0.55). For conditions for initializing the second recording<br>
layer, the disc was rotated in CLV (constant leaner velocity)<br>
mode at a linear velocity of 7m/s, a feed rate of 40 um/revolution,<br>
a radius position of 22 mm to 59 mm, with an initialization<br>
power of 2,000 mW. For conditions for initializing the first<br>
recording layer, the disc was rotated in CLV (constant leaner<br>
velocity) mode at a linear velocity of 6m/s, a feed rate of 60<br>
um/revolution, a radius position of 22 mm to 59 mm with an<br>
initialization power of 1,100 mW.<br><br>
For the reflectance of the crystalline phase after the<br>
initialization, the LO layer had a reflectance of 6.2%, the LI<br>
layer had a reflectance of 5.8%, and the two-layered<br>
phase-change optical recording medium had well-balanced<br>
reflectance.<br>
(Examples 2 to 13 and Comparative Examples 1 to 4)<br>
Two-layered phase-change optical recording media each<br>
having the same substrates and the same layer configuration as<br>
those of Example 1 were prepared except that the material<br>
composition of the thermal diffusion layer (light transmissive<br>
layer) was changed to the material composition shown in Table 1.<br>
The two-layered phase-change optical recording media were<br>
tested.<br>
The acceptance level of light transmittance of the first<br>
information layer was determined to be 42%. Further, to<br>
determine the reliability of repetitive recording durability, a<br>
jitter value (DOW 500 jitter) after repeatedly recording at 500<br>
times was evaluated. The acceptance level of jitter value was<br>
determined to be 10%.<br>
Table 1 shows the evaluation results, and when Sn oxide<br>
and Si oxide were not contained in the material composition for<br>
thermal diffusion layer, the light transmittance and the DOW 10<br>
jitter were not within acceptable level. When In oxide was<br>
contained at 3 mol% or less, the DOW 500 jitter value was<br><br>
increased, although the light transmittance was excellent.<br>
When In oxide was contained at 50 mol% or more, the light<br>
transmittance tended to be lowered, although the DOW 500<br>
jitter value was decreased. Further, when Si oxide was<br>
contained at 30 mol% or more, the sputtering rate tended to be<br>
lowered.<br>
(Examples 14 to 40 and Comparative Examples 5 to 13)<br>
Two-layered phase-change optical recording media of<br>
Examples 14 to 40 and Comparative Examples 5 to 13 were<br>
prepared in the same manner as in Example 1, except that the<br>
groove depths of the first and the second substrates were<br>
changed to values shown in Tables 2-A, 2-B and 2-C. There is a<br>
tendency that the shallower the groove depth is, the higher the<br>
reflectance is, however, actually, there was little difference in<br>
reflectance with the groove depths employed in Examples, the<br>
reflectances of the L0 layer and LI layer were well balanced in<br>
any of the optical recording media of Examples 14, 23 and 32<br>
respectively formed with a deep groove and the optical recording<br>
media of Example 22, 31 and 40 respectively formed with a<br>
shallow groove.<br>
The two-layered phase-change optical recording media of<br>
Examples 14 to 40 and Comparative Examples 5 to 13 were<br>
evaluated with a laser wavelength of 660 nm, 645 nm and 665<br>
nm, respectively. Tables 2-A, 2-B and 2-C show the evaluation<br><br>
results. When the groove depth was shallower than the lower<br>
limit value (λ/17n) as in the optical recording media of<br>
Comparative Examples 6 to 7, 9 to 10 and 12 to 13, the<br>
amplitude of a push-pull signal was decreased, and stable<br>
tracking accuracy could not be obtained. When the groove<br>
depth was deeper than the upper limit value (λ/11.5n) as in the<br>
optical recording media of Comparative Examples 5, 8 and 11,<br>
the jitter value was increased.<br>
Marks were repeatedly recorded 10 times at three<br>
adjacent tracks in the recording layer and, of these three tracks,<br>
the middle track was reproduced to evaluate properties of<br>
optical recording media of Examples 14 to 40 and Comparative<br>
Examples 5 to 13. The evaluation of properties was carried out<br>
based on a jitter obtained when 3T to 11T and 14T marks and<br>
spaces were randomly recorded. The "jitter" represents a time<br>
deviation between boundary and time clock when reflectance<br>
levels of marks and spaces were binarized on a specific slice<br>
level. The lower the jitter value is, the more excellent the<br>
recording property is. The acceptance level of jitter value was<br>
9% or less. The modulation degree after recording was<br>
measured, and both the L0 layer and LI layer had a modulation<br>
degree of 63%. As to the recording power Pw at that time, the<br>
recording power (Pw) of the L0 layer was 36 mW, and the<br>
recording power (Pw) of the LI layer was 38 mW. A modulation<br><br>
degree is the one represented by (Rtop - Rbot)/Rtop when the<br>
reflectance of a crystalline phase is represented by Rtop and the<br>
reflectance of an amorphous phase is represented by Rbot.<br>
The push-pull signals shown in Tables 2-A, 2-B and 2-C<br>
are the ones that [(la + lb) - (lc + Id)] / [la + lb + lc + Id] are<br>
measured using a photodetector shown in FIG. 5. The<br>
frequency was filtered with a low-pass filter having a cutoff<br>
frequency of 30 kHz (-3dB) so that serpentine wobble frequency<br>
components (about 820 kHz) and other noise components were<br>
not mixed at the time of measurement. The acceptance level of<br>
push-pull signal was determined to be 0.28 or more.<br>
The same results could also be obtained with the optical<br>
recording media of Examples 2 to 13 in which each of the<br>
material of the thermal diffusion layer (light transmissive layer)<br>
was changed.<br>
(Examples 41 to 49 and Reference Examples 14 to 18)<br>
Two-layered optical recording media each having the<br>
same substrates and the same layer configuration as those of<br>
Example 1 were prepared, except that the material composition<br>
of the recording layer was changed to the material composition<br>
shown in Table 3. The prepared optical recording media were<br>
tested as to recording properties and storage stability.<br>
A jitter (DOW10 jitter) after repeatedly recording 10<br>
times at a recording linear velocity of 9.2 m/s was measured, a<br><br>
jitter value less than 10% was evaluated as "A" and a jitter<br>
value of 10% or more was evaluated as "B". Further, when a<br>
jitter variation obtained after being left at 80°C for 300 hours<br>
was less than 2%, it was evaluated as "A", and when a jitter<br>
variation obtained after being left at 80°C for 300 hours was 2%<br>
or more, it was evaluated as "B". The two-layered<br>
phase-change optical recording medium was stored in a<br>
thermostatic bath set at 80°C and a relative humidity of 85% for<br>
300 hours to thereby carry out the storage test.<br>
As can be seen from Table 3, when the content of Ge was<br>
smaller than 2%, the storage stability of the optical recording<br>
medium was degraded because of the low crystallization<br>
temperature. When the content of Ge was greater than 20%,<br>
the repetitive recording property of the optical recording<br>
medium was degraded, although the crystallization temperature<br>
was sufficiently high. It can be considered that when the<br>
content of Sb is smaller than 60%, high-speed recording cannot<br>
be carried out because of its low transition linear velocity at the<br>
recording layer. When the content of Sb was greater than 75%,<br>
recording could not be done because of its excessively high<br>
transition linear velocity, and the storage stability of the optical<br>
recording medium was poor because the crystallization<br>
temperature was decreased. When the content of Te was<br>
smaller than 6%, it was difficult to initialize the recording layer,<br><br>
and the jitter value was increased. When the content of Te was<br>
greater than 30%, the transition linear velocity was slow and<br>
the recording properties tended to be degraded<br>
(Examples 50 to 65}<br>
Two-layered phase-change optical recording media each<br>
having the same substrates and the same layer configuration as<br>
those of Example 1, except that the material composition of the<br>
first upper protective layer was changed to the composition as<br>
shown in Tables 4 and 5. The prepared optical recording media<br>
were tested.<br>
A transition linear velocity of the first information layer<br>
and a jitter value obtained after repeatedly recording 10 times<br>
were evaluated. The evaluation results showed that the<br>
sputtering rate was almost the same, however, when any one of<br>
ZnO or SnO2 was contained at 50 mol% or more, the recording<br>
properties of the optical recording medium were enhanced<br>
because the transition linear velocity was improved.<br>
(Example 1 and 66 to 77)<br>
Two-layered phase-change optical recording media each<br>
having the same substrates and the same layer configuration as<br>
those of Example 1, except that the material composition of the<br>
first semi-transparent reflective layer was changed to the<br>
material shown in Table 6. The prepared optical recording<br>
media were tested.<br><br>
The measurement results of Examples 66 to 77 were<br>
shown together with the results of Example 1 in Table 6. The<br>
jitter variation of the optical recording media after being stored<br>
at 80°C and a relative humidity of 85% for 300 hours was<br>
evaluated, and any of the optical recording media had a jitter<br>
variation less than 1%.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 78<br>
For the respective two-layered phase-change optical<br>
recording media prepared in Examples 1 to 3, 6 and<br>
Comparative Example 1, a light transmittance of the first<br>
information layer (LO layer) within a wavelength range of 640<br>
nm to 680 am was measured. FIG. 18 shows the measurement<br>
results of the light transmittance. FIG. 19 shows measurement<br>
results of a relation between recording power and DOW10 jitter<br>
for the two-layered phase-change optical recording media-<br>
Further, FIG. 20 shows a relation between thermal<br>
conductivity of the thermal diffusion layer (light transmissive<br>
layer) of the respective two-layered phase-change optical<br>
recording media, the optimum recording power obtained in FIG.<br>
19 (a recording power with which the lowest jitter value was<br><br>
obtained), and light transmittance of each of the LO layers<br>
measured at a wavelength of 660 nm obtained in FIG. 18.<br>
The results shown in FIG. 20 verified that the smaller<br>
the amount of In oxide was contained in the thermal diffusion<br>
layer (light transmissive layer), the higher the light<br>
transmittance of each of the LO layers was and the lower the<br>
optimum recording power was.<br><br>
