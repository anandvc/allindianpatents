Fiber bundle collecting device of a spinning machine<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a fiber bundle collecting device of a spinning machine, and more specifically, to a fiber bundle collecting device arranged, for example, on the downstream side of a drafting device (drafting part) of a spinning frame and adapted to collect a fiber bundle drafted by the drafting device, 2. Description of the Related Art<br>
There have been proposed various fiber bundle collecting devices which are aimed at achieving an improvement in thread quality such as a reduction in fluff generation by collecting a drafted fiber bundle before the fiber bundle receives a twisting action. An endless perforated belt {perforated apron) is often used for effecting collection and transfer of a fiber bundle which are basic functions of those devices.<br>
For example, refer to the descriptions in paragraphs 0022, 0030 and Figs. 1 and 7 in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 11-286837 as Patent Document 1.<br>
Further, refer to the descriptions in a paragraph 0018 and Fig. 1 in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2000-34631 as Patent Document 2.<br>
Further, refer to Figs. 2 and 3 in German Patent Laid-Open No. DE19708410A1 as Patent Document 3.<br>
The perforated belt is moved while covering a suction hole that extends in a direction in which the fiber bundle moves. To regulate movement of the perforated belt in the width direction (i,e. lateral movement), Patent Document 1 discloses providing a<br><br>
tension element formed of plastic for the purpose of imparting tension to and guiding the perforated belt. Further, Patent Document 1 also discloses providing a lateral guide engaging with the perforated belt to a hollow profile equipped with the suction hole. Further, Patent Document 2 discloses guiding the perforated belt in the lateral direction along lateral ends of a tension roller used for tensioning the perforated belt.<br>
As shown in Figs. 8A and 8B of the specification of the present application, a device disclosed in Patent Document 3 includes a delivery roller pair 72 equipped with a perforated apron 71, and a suction air current acts on the conveying surface of the perforated apron 71 via groove holes formed in an apron guide 73 that guides the perforated apron 71. The perforated apron 71 is wrapped around the apron guide 73, a delivery roller 72a, and a tension imparting member 74. The delivery roller 72a is adapted to rotate by means of friction with a friction roller portion 75a of i rotation shaft 75 arranged in parallel to a front bottom roller (not shown). Lateral movement of the perforated apron 71 is regulated by a side surface of the friction roller portion 75a.<br>
In the case where spinning machines equipped with the fiber bundle collecting devices described above are used for producing thread through spinning, fluff generation as well as thread specks are reduced as compared with the case where spinning machines equipped with no fiber bundle collecting devices are used for producing thread through spinning, thereby achieving an increase in U%. However, there is a demand for a further improvement in this regard.<br>
In fiber bundle collecting devices of the prior art, no particular contrivance has been made with respect to the downstream<br><br>
side of the nip point in order to achieve an improvement in terms of thread quality. Then, the inventors of the present invention have devised a fiber bundle collecting device which is capable of achieving an improvement in thread quality, by providing a suction pipe also on the downstream side of the nip point, the suction pipe exerting sucking action on a fiber bundle through an air-permeable apron (perforated apron), and by providing a wrapping member on the downstream side of the nip point, the wrapping member having the air-permeable apron wrapped therearound to increase a fleece angleâ€¢ In this case also, it is necessary to prevent lateral displacement of the air-permeable apron. Note that, the tenterm "fleece angle" means the angle made by a segment connecting the center of curvature of an arcuate surface along which the fiber bundle (fleece) having passed the nip point is guided to a draw-out position and the nip point and a segment connecting the center of curvature and the draw-out point for the fiber bundle F.<br>
In the case where the wrapping member, around which the air-permeable apron (perforated apron) is wrapped, exists on each of the upstream side and the downstream side of the nip point, the presence of a regulating member for regulating lateral (widthwise) movement of the air-permeable apron becomes an important consideration as compared with the case where no wrapping member exists on the downstream side. The air-permeable apron needs to be replaced at each cleaning cycle of certain time period or at the end of its life. However, in a construction in which a dedicated regulating member is provided in addition to the suction pipe and the wrapping member, the replacement of the air-permeable apron is cumbersome because its engagement with the regulating member<br><br>
needs to be released upon the replacement, and thus a large amount of time is required for replacing hundreds to thousands of such air-permeable aprons that are typically provided per one spinning machine. Further, a construction such as disclosed in Patent Document 3, which involves special processing to be performed on the rotation shaft, leads to an increase in cost.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a fiber bundle collecting device of a spinning machine, which is capable of restraining generation of fluff in comparison with the prior art to thereby achieve an improvement in terms of thread quality as well as restraining lateral movement of the air-permeable apron, with a simple construction.<br>
In order to attain the above object, this invention relates to a fiber bundle collecting device which is provided on a downstream side of a final delivery roller pair of a drafting part of a spinning machine and adapted to collect a fiber bundle drafted by the drafting part, the fiber bundle collecting device including: a delivery portion equipped with a nip roller; a suction pipe which is provided on an upstream side of a nip point of the delivery portion with respect to a moving direction of the fiber bundle and has a guide surface equipped with a suction slit; and an air-permeable apron constituting the delivery portion and adapted to be rotated while sliding on the guide surface, in which a wrapping member around which a part of the air-permeable apron is wrapped is provided in parallel to the suction pipe on the downstream side of the nip point of the delivery portion with respect to the moving direction of<br><br>
the fiber bundle, and a regulating guide for preventing lateral displacement of the air-permeable apron is formed integrally with at least one of the suction pipe and the wrapping member.<br>
According to this invention, the fiber bundle drafted by the drafting part is collected by the fiber bundle collecting device provided on the downstream side of the final delivery roller pair of the drafting part and moved in the collected state. Hence, as compared with a spinning machine equipped with no fiber bundle collecting device, it is possible to restrain generation of fluff as well as waste cotton, thereby achieving an improvement in terms of thread quality. Further, due to the wrapping member provided on the downstream side of the nip point and separately from the suction pipe, the fluff generation restraining effect is enhanced to thereby achieve an improvement in terms of thread quality. The air-permeable apron adapted to transfer the fiber bundle is moved (rotated) in a state in which its lateral movement is prevented due to the action of the regulating guide, and thus the transfer of the fiber bundle is performed in a stable manner. Further, the regulating guide is formed integrally with at least one of the suction pipe and the wrapping member, so that the construction is simplified as compared with the case where a dedicatfed regulating guide is provided separately from the suction pipe and the wrapping member .<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS An embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to Figs. 1 through 6. Fig. 1 is a schematic perspective view of a unit to which a suction pipe, a wrapping member, air-permeable aprons, and the like are mounted. Fig. 2 is a side view, partly in section, showing one side of a drafting device and a fiber bundle collecting device. Fig. 3 is a partial schematic view with the top roller side being omitted, showing a relationship among a bottom roller of a drafting device, and suction portions and bottom nip rollers of the fiber bundle collecting device. Fig. 4A is a schematic view of the fiber bundle collecting device as seen in a fiber bundle-drawing-out direction at a nip point (as<br><br>
seen from the front side with respect to a fiber bundle moving direction in the drafting device).<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, a drafting device 11 as a drafting part is of a three-line construction equipped with a front bottom roller 12, a middle bottom roller 13, and a back bottom roller 14. The front bottom roller 12 is supported at a predetermined position with respect to a roller stand 15 constituting a machine base frame, and the middle and back bottom rollers 13 and 14 are supported through the intermediation of support brackets 13a and 14a secured to the roller stand 15 so as to allow position adjustment in the longitudinal direction. The support brackets 13a and 14a are fastened to predetermined positions by means of bolts passed through an elongated hole formed in the roller stand 15 and nuts (all not shown). A bottom apron 16 is wrapped around a bottom tenser 17 and the middle bottom roller 13.<br>
Supported by a weighting arm 18 are a front top roller 19, a middle top roller 20, and a back top roller 21 at positions respectively corresponding to the front bottom roller 12, the middle bottom roller 13, and the back bottom roller 14- Each of the top rollers 19 through 21 is supported in a two-spindle unit. The front bottom roller 12 and the front top roller 19 constitute a pair of final delivery rollers of the drafting device 11.<br>
Arranged on the weighting arm 18 is a lever 18a so as to be rotatable to a pressurizing position and to a releasing position. In the condition in which the lever 18a is arranged at the pressurizing position where it abuts the frame 18b of the weighting arm shown in Fig. 2, a lock state is maintained in which the top rollers 19 through 21 supported by the weighting arm 18 are in the pressurizing<br><br>
position (spinning position) in which they are pressurized towards the bottom rollers 12, 13, and 14. In the condition in which the lever 18a has been rotated from the position shown in Fig. 2 to the upper, releasing position, the lock state is canceled.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, a fiber bundle collecting device 30 is arranged on the downstream side of the pair of final delivery rollers of the drafting device 11. The fiber bundle collecting device 30 is equipped with a delivery portion 31, a suction pipe 32, a wrapping member 33, and an air-permeable apron 34. The delivery portion 31 is<br>
formed on a rotation shaft 35 arranged parallel to the front bottom roller 12, and the top nip roller 31a, which is pressurized against the bottom nip roller 35a through the intermediation of the air-permeable apron 34. As shown in Figs. 2 and 5, the suction pipe 32 is arranged on the upstream side of the nip point of the bottom nip roller 35a with respect to the moving direction of the fiber bundle F, and the wrapping member 33 is arranged on the downstream side thereof.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4A, in the fiber bundle collecting device 30 of this embodiment, the top nip roller 31a is, like the top rollers 19 through 21 of the drafting device 11, supported in every two spindles by the weighting arm 18 through the intermediation of a support member 36 (shown in Figs. 2 and 5). Note that, in this embodiment, the support member 36 is formed integrally with a support member of the front top roller 19.<br>
J â€” n<br>
On the other hand, on the bottom side of the fiber bundle collecting device 30, half the spindles arranged between the roller of the drafting device 11. i.e., four spindles in this<br><br>
embodiment, constitute one unit. As shown in Fig. 3, at the middle position of the roller stands 15 arranged at predetermined intervals in the longitudinal direction of a machine base, a support arm 38 is arranged in a state in which its base end is supported by a support beam 37 extending in the longitudinal direction of the machine base, and the rotation shaft 35 is supported between the roller stand 15 and the support arm 38.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4B, the rotation shaft 35 is formed in a predetermined length corresponding to a plurality of spindles (four spindles in this embodiment), and a bearing 39 is secured to either end thereof. Then, as shown in Fig. 1, the rotation shaft 35 is attached onto the unit in a state in which the bearing 39 is in fitting engagement with the pair of end plugs 40. The suction pipe 32 and the wrapping member 33 are also supported in a state in which their end portions are in fitting engagement with the pair of end plugs 40 supporting the rotation shaft 35.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4A, the end plugs 40 are supported in the engagement portions 40a by support portions 15a and 38a provided on the roller stand 15 and the support arm 38, whereby the rotation shaft 35 is rotatably supported between the roller stand 15 and the support arm 38. The support portions 15a and 38a are formed so as to be capable of supporting two end plugs 40, and are capable of supporting the end plugs 40 that are mounted to the ends of the adjacent rotation shafts 35.<br>
The support portion 15a is formed by a block fixed to the roller stand 15, and has an engagement recess extending obliquely upward on a front side of the machine base. The support portion 38a also has an engagement recess extending obliquely upward on the front<br><br>
side of the machine base. Then, the end plug 40 has an engagement portion 40a capable of being engaged with both the engagement recesses, and is formed so as to be capable of being engaged, in a single snap motion, with the support portions 15a and 38a in the engagement portion 40a.<br>
The rotation shaft 35 has a gear 41, which is arranged so as to be capable of rotating integrally with the rotation shaft 35. The gear 41 is provided at a position shifted from the center of the rotation shaft 35 toward the end portion side by the length of one spindle unit. As shown in Fig. 3, the front bottom roller 12 has a gear portion 12a formed at a position opposed to the gear 41. Further, an intermediate gear 43 in mesh with the gear portion 12a and the gear 41 is rotatably supported by a support arm 42 whose base end is fixed to the support beam 37 like the support arm 38. That is, the torque of the front bottom roller 12 is transmitted to the rotation shaft 35 by way of the gear portion 12a, the intermediate gear 43, and the gear 41.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, in the machine base of the spinning frame, ducts 44 serving as suction sources (negative pressure sources) for the fiber bundle collecting device 30 are arranged so as to extend in a longitudinal direction thereof (in a direction perpendicular to the plane of Fig. 2). Suction devices 45 for maintaining negative pressure in each of the ducts 44 are connected to each of the ducts 44 through pipes 46. Used as the suction devices 45 are fan motors in which fans 47a are driven by motors 47. As shown in Fig. 2, the ducts 44 are arranged on the upper rear side of the drafting device 11 and at the center of the machine base of the spinning machine, and the suction devices 45 are arranged<br><br>
below the ducts 44. The suction pipe 32 has a connection portion 32c (shown in Fig. 1) formed at a longitudinally central portion thereof, and is connected to the duct 44 through a connection pipe 48, which is brought into fitting engagement with the connection portion 32c, so as to extend parallel to the duct 44.<br>
The suction pipe 32 has a sliding surface 32b serving as a guide surface, the sliding surface 32b having formed therein suction holes 32a that serve as suction slits extending toward the upstream side with respect to the direction in which the fiber bundle {fleeces) F moves relative to the nip point of the bottom nip roller 35a. The suction pipe 32 is formed in a configuration such that it can guide the air-permeable apron 34 so as to bring it near the nip point of the front bottom roller 12 and the front top roller 19.<br>
As shown in Figs. 1, 3, and the like, a regulating guide 49 for preventing lateral displacement of the air-permeable apron 34 is formed integrally with the suction pipe 32. The regulating guide 49 is formed by removing a part of an elevated step portion 50 in conformity with the width of the air-permeable apron 34, the step portion 50 being formed on the front side of the top surface of the suction pipe 32 (on the downstream side with respect to the moving direction of the fiber bundle F) so as to extend in a longitudinal direction. Note that, in Fig. 1, the air-permeable aprons 34 are illustrated one by one for ease of description of the suction hole 32a and the regulating guide 49.<br>
To facilitate production of the suction pipe 32 having the regulating guide 49 formed integrally therewith, the suction pipe 32 is extrusion molded so as to have the step portion 50, so that a portion of the suction pipe 32 where the regulating guide 49 is<br><br>
to be formed is elevated in height. Then,a cutting proces for<br>
removing a part of the step portion 50 in conformity with the width of the air-permeable apron 34, and machining of the suction holes 32a are performed.<br>
The wrapping member 33 has a slide surface 33a as a guide surface for slidingly guiding the air-permeable aprons 34. The wrapping member 33 is arranged such that the distance L (shown in Fig. 6A) between the nip point and the position where the fiber bundle F is separated from the air-permeable apron 34 on the downstream side of the nip point is not less than 5 mm, more preferably, 8 to 10 mm. The wrapping member 33 is formed of a bar-like solid member.<br>
The air-permeable apron 34 is wrapped so as to be in contact partly with the suction pipe 32, partly with the wrapping member 33, and partly with the bottom nip roller 35a, and is adapted to rotate while rolling on the slide surfaces 32b and 33a as the bottom nip roller 35a rotates â€¢ In this embodiment, the air-permeable aprons 34 are formed of woven fabric that ensures appropriate air-permeability.<br>
As shown in Figs. 2, 4A, etc., arranged in the vicinity of the lower portion of the wrapping member 33 is a forward end portion of a suction nozzle 51 of a single type pneumatic device adapted to suck the fiber bundle F sent out from the drafting device 11 at the time of thread breakage. A base end of the suction nozzle 51 is connected to a pneumatic duct 52 common among all the spindles.<br>
Next, the operation of the device constructed as described above will be described.<br>
When the spinning frame is operated, each fiber bundle F is drafted by passing between the bottom rollers 12 through 14 and<br><br>
the top rollers 19 through 21, and then guided to the fiber bundle collecting device 30. The top nip roller 31a of the delivery portion 31 is rotated somewhat faster than the surface velocity of each of the front bottom roller 12 and the front top roller 19, and after passing the nip point of the delivery portion 31 under appropriate tension, the fiber bundle F moves toward the downstream side while receiving twisting action.<br>
Further, the sucking action of the ducts 44 is exerted on the suction pipes 32 through the connection pipes 48, and the sucking action of the suction holes 32a formed on the sliding surfaces 32b is exerted on the fiber bundles F through the air-permeable aprons 34. Then, the fiber bundles F move while being attracted and collected toward positions corresponding to the suction holes 32a. Thus, as compared with the case of a spinning machine with no fiber bundle collecting device 30, it is possible to restrain generation of fluff and waste cotton, thereby achieving an improvement in terms of thread quality.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6A, due to the presence of the wrapping member<br>
33	provided on the downstream side of and separately from the suction<br>
pipe 32, the fleece angle 81 is larger than the fleece angle 02 (shown in Fig. 6B) when no wrapping member 33 exists. In the state in which the fleece angle is large, the distance covered by the fiber bundle F until it is separated from the surface of the air-permeable apron<br>
34	after passing the nip point, is relatively long. Thus, due to<br>
the twisting action exerted on the fiber bundle F from the take-up<br>
portion, the fiber bundle is rotated, with fibers f sticking out<br>
of the periphery of the fiber bundle F being in contact with the<br>
air-permeable apron 34, so that the fibers f are easily twisted<br><br>
into the fiber bundle F, thereby restraining generation of fluff. Further, in the construction in which the wrapping member 33 exists, as the fiber bundle F reciprocates while rolling on the apron, the fibers f sticking out of the periphery of the fiber bundle F are easily twisted into the fiber bundle F.<br>
It has conventionally been believed that an increase in fleece angle makes the thread subject to breakage. However, in the case in which the fiber bundle collecting device 30 is provided, the fiber bundle F is drawn out from the nip point while being collected by the sucking action of the suction hole 32a, so that the twisting due to the take-up action easily reaches the vicinity of the nip point to thereby achieve an increase in thread strength, restraining an increase in occurrence of thread breakage even when the fleece angle is increased. Thus, it is possible to restrain a reduction in productivity due to thread breakage.<br>
The air-permeable apron 34 adapted to transfer the fiber bundle F is moved (rotated) in ,a state where its lateral displacement is prevented due to the action of the regulating guide 49, and thus the transfer of the fiber bundle F is performed in a stable manner. Of the regulating guides 49, the regulating guide 49 for regulating the air-permeable apron 34 wrapped at a position close to the connection portion 32c that is to be connected to the connection pipe 48, regulates movement of the air-permeable apron 34 to either side in the width direction by means of its end faces along which the step portion 50 is removed. As for the regulating guide 49 for regulating the air permeable apron 34 wrapped at a position close to the end plug 40, regulation on movement of the air-permeable apron 34 toward the center of the suction pipe 32 is effected by<br><br>
means of an end face of the regulating member 49 along which the step portion 50 is removed, whereas regulation on movement of the air-permeable apron 34 toward the end portion side is effected by means of an end face of the end plug 40.<br>
This embodiment provides the following effects:<br>
(1)	The suction pipe is provided on the upstream side of the<br>
nip point of the delivery portion 31 with respect to the direction<br>
in which the fiber bundle F moves. On the downstream side of the<br>
nip point with respect to the direction in which the fiber bundle<br>
F moves, the wrapping member 33, around which a part of the<br>
air-permeable apron 34 is wrapped, is provided in parallel to the<br>
suction pipe 32. Accordingly, the fleece angle is increased, so<br>
that the fluff generation restraining effect is enhanced as compared<br>
with the construction in which the wrapping member 33 does not exist,<br>
thereby achieving an improvement in terms of thread quality.<br>
(2)	The regulating guide 49 for preventing lateral displacement<br>
of the air-permeable apron 34 is formed integrally with the suction<br>
pipe 32. Accordingly, the air-permeable apron 34 adapted to transfer<br>
the fiber bundle F is moved (rotated) in a state where its lateral<br>
displacement is prevented due to the action of the regulating guide<br>
49. As a result, the transfer of the fiber bundle F is performed<br>
in a stable manner. In addition, the construction is simplified<br>
as compared with the case where a dedicated regulating guide is<br>
provided separately from the suction pipe 32.<br>
(3)	The suction pipe 32, in which the regulating guide 49 is<br>
to be formed, is extrusion molded so as to have the step portion<br>
50 so that a portion of the suction pipe 32 where the regulating<br>
guide 49 is to be formed is elevated in height. The regulating guide<br><br>
49 is formed by removing a part of the step portion 50 in conformity with the width of the air-permeable apron 34. Accordingly, as compared with the case where the regulating guide is attached to the suction pipe by welding, adhesion, or screwing, its production is facilitated.<br>
(4)	The wrapping member 33 is provided such that the distance L between the nip point of the delivery portion 31 and the position where the fiber bundle leaves the air-permeable apron 34 on the downstream side of the nip point is not less than 5 mm. Thus, as the fiber bundle F moves while rolling on the air-permeable apron 34, the fibers f sticking out of the fiber bundle F are easily twisted into the fiber bundle F, thereby improving the fluff generation restraining effect.<br>
(5)	The wrapping member 33 is formedof a bar-like solidmember. Thus, as compared with the case in which the wrapping member 33 is formed in a tubular configuration, its production is facilitated. Further, even if the wrapping member 33 collides with other members at the time of mounting, dismantling and maintenance operation, etc., it is not easily damaged.<br><br>
(6)	The force with which the top nip roller 31a pressurizes the air-permeable apron 34 is borne by the bottom nip roller 35a, and the pressurizing force of the top nip rollqr 31a is not applied to the suction pipe 32. Thus, as compared with the case of the cohventional device (Patent Document 1), the rigidity required of the suction pipe 32 is less, and a sufficient strength of the suction pipe can be secured even if it is formed of resin.<br>
(7)	The duct 44 serving as the negative pressure source is provided independently of the pneumatic device for sucking fleece<br><br>
senr out trom the drafting part at the time of thread breakage. Thus, the sucking pressure of the suction pipe 32 can be easily adjusted to an appropriate pressure.<br>
The above-described embodiment should not be construed restrictively. For example, the following constructions are also possible.<br>
It is sufficient that the regulating guide 49 be formed in at least one of the suction pipe 32 and the wrapping member 33. For example, as shown in Fig. 1, it is also possible to adopt a construction in which the regulating guide 49 is formed in the wrapping member 33. In the case where the regulating member 49 is formed in the wrapping member, cleaning/removal of dust or the like that has deposited between the regulating guide and the air-permeable apron is facilitated as compared with the case where the regulating guide is formed on the suction pipe 32 situated on the upstream side.<br>
The regulating guide 49 may also be formed in both the suction pipe 32 and the wrapping member 33.<br>
Instead of forming the wrapping member 33 of a solid member, the wrapping member 33 may be formed in a tubular configuration. When formed in a tubular configuration, the wrapping member 33 can be made lightweight.<br>
Regarding the distance L between the nip point of the delivery portion 31 and the position where the fiber bundle F leaves the air-permeable apron 34 on the downstream side of the nip point of the delivery portion 31, the fluff generation restraining effect is satisfactory as long as the distance L is not less than 5 mm. There is no particular upper limit to the distance L. However, making<br><br>
the distance too long does not help much in improving the fluff generation restraining effect but only results in an increase in the size of the machine base. Therefore, the distance ranges preferably from 8 to 10 mm.<br>
The construction of the delivery portion of the fiber bundle collecting device 30 is not restricted to the one equipped with the nip roller pair. For example, it is also possible to adopt a construction for driving the air-permeable apron 34 which includes eliminating the suction pipe 32 and the bottom nip roller 35a, providing a suction pipe egg-shaped in section, forming a suction hole at a predetermined position of the suction pipe, and slidably wrapping the air-permeable apron 34 around the outer peripheries of the suction pipe and the wrapping member 33. Then, by making the top nip roller 31a be positively driven, the air-permeable apron 34 is driven by driving the top nip roller 31a while keeping it in press contact with the air-permeable apron 34. In this case, it is possible to endow the wrapping member 33 with a tension adjusting function for the air-permeable apron 34.<br>
The wrapping member 33 may also be endowed with the function of exerting sucking action on the fiber bundle F transferred by the air-permeable apron 34. For example, in addition to forming the wrapping member 33 by using a pipe, the suction holes are provided in the wrapping member 33. In this case, the fiber bundle F moves while being attracted and collected at positions corresponding to the suction holes. Accordingly, the fiber bundle F moves in a collected state due to the sucking action even after passing the nip point, so that generation of fluff and waste cotton is restrained to achieve an improvement in terms of thread quality.<br><br>
The suction pipe 32, the wrapping member 33, and the rotation shaft 35 are not restricted to the construction in which four spindle units constitute one unit. It is also possible to adopt a construction in which the spindle units (e.g., eight spindle units) between the adjacent roller stands 15 constitute one unit or a construction in which two spindle units constitute one unit. Further, it is not always necessary for all the units to have the same number of spindle units; it is also possible to make the numbers of spindle units between the adjacent roller stands 15 different from each other (e.g., six and two), providing two kinds of units in correspondence therewith.<br>
It is also possible for the end portions of the suction pipe 32 to be closed. In this case, there is no need for the end plugs 40 to hermetically seal the end portions of the suction pipe 32, and it is only necessary to provide an engagement hole with which the bearing 39 is engaged and engagement portions (engagement holes) with which the end portions of the suction pipe 32 and the wrapping member 33 are engaged^ thereby facilitating the production.<br>
Instead of providing the plurality of ducts 44 extending in the longitudinal direction, it is also possible to provide a single duct extending over the entire length of the machine base of the spinning machine.<br>
The position of the duct 44 is not restricted to the one on the rear side of and above the drafting device H; it may also be arranged on the rear side of or on the rear side of and below the drafting device 11.<br>
Instead of the arrangement in which the duct 44 is shared by the suction pipes 32 arranged on the right and left sides of the<br><br>
spinning frame, it is also possible to adopt an arrangement in which the ducts are arranged in two rows, respectively for the right and left sides, so as to extend in the longitudinal direction of the machine base of the spinning machine.<br>
Instead of forming the air-permeable apron 34 of woven fabric, it is also possible to form the air-permeable apron 34 of knitted fabric, in this case also, it is possible to obtain an appropriate level of air-permeability without taking the trouble to form small perforations in the belt forming the air-permeable apron 34, making it possible to manufacture the air-permeable apron 34 at low cost. Further, due to the elasticity of the knitted fabric, it is possible for the air-permeable apron 34 to be rotated under appropriate tension without having to provide any special tension device.<br>
Instead of forming the air-permeable apron 34 of woven fabric or knitted fabric, it is also possible to form the air-permeable apron 34 by perforating a resin belt formed of rubber or elastic resin.<br>
It is also possible to adopt a construction in which the rotation shaft 35 with the bottom nip rollers 35a formed thereon is a shaft shared by all the spindle units and driven by a motor through a row of gears provided at the gear end of the machine base as in the case of the bottom rollers 12 through 14 of the drafting device 11.<br>
It is also possible to use a common negative pressure source for the suction pipe 32 and the pneumatic device.<br>
As the pneumatic device, it is also possible to adopt a flute-type construction instead of a single nozzle type one.<br><br><br>
