The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
Technical field of the invention:<br>
The present invention relates to controlled release pharmaceutical compositions of Galantamine and process of preparation of said compositions.<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
Galantamine is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderately severe dementia of the Alzheimer type. Galantamine is a tertiary alkaloid and is a competitive and reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase. Galantamine hydrobromide is chemically (4aS ,6R,8aS)-4a,5,9,10,11,12-hexahydro-3-methoxy-11 -methyl-6H-benzofuro[3a,3;2-efj [2]benzazepin-6-ol hydrobromide. The empirical formula of Galantamine hydrobromide is C17H21NO3HBr and it has a molecular weight of 368.27. Galantamine hydrobromide is a white to almost white powder and is sparingly soluble in water. The structural formula for Galantamine hydrobromide is as represented in Formula I,<br><br>
Galantamine hydrobromide is available in the form of tablets and capsules for the use in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Galantamine and its salts have also been employed in the treatment of a variety of disorders including alcoholism, nicotinic dependence and mania due to their affinity for nicotinic receptors and it is capable of passing the blood-brain barrier. Galantamine hydrobromide is marketed as Razadyne® in US by Janssen pharmaceuticals and Reminyl® in Europe by Shire pharmaceuticals.<br>
Galantamine hydrobromide is also available in the form of extended release capsules and is marketed in United states by Janssen pharmaceuticals. Galantamine hydrobromide extended release capsules (Innovator) are available as opaque hard gelatin extended-release capsules of 8 mg (white), 16 mg (pink), and 24 mg (caramel)<br><br>
containing Galantamine hydrobromide, equivalent to respectively 8, 16 and 24 mg Galantamine base. The inactive ingredients include gelatin, diethyl phthalate, ethylcellulose, hypromellose, polyethylene glycol, titanium dioxide and sugar spheres (sucrose and starch). The 16 mg capsule also contains red ferric oxide. The 24 mg capsule also contains red ferric oxide and yellow ferric oxide. In Europe, the extended release capsules of Galantamine hydrobromide are marketed under the brand name 'Reminyl XL®' by Shire pharmaceuticals.<br>
Prior art discloses several formulations of Galantamine. Various attempts have been made to improve the characteristics of controlled release formulation of Galantamine.<br>

High shear granulation improves the cohesiveness of particles and provides excellent flowability and compression characteristics to the tablet. As the granules exhibit good flow properties, mini tablets produced possess uniformity in weight.<br>
In the practice of the present invention, aqueous/non-aqueous granulation is carried out by adding the binder slowly in a thin stream continuously using a peristaltic pump under high speed mixing with the impeller 'on' and chopper 'off'. On completion of binder addition, mixing is continued at high impeller speed till cohesive granular mass is obtained. If the mass is lumpy then chopper may be used at high speed with impeller also at high speed to obtain uniform wet mass. Drying of granulated mass may be carried out using fluidized bed drier or tray drier. Granulated mass is dried for sufficient time till loss on drying value in the range of about 0.5% to about 3.0% is achieved. In a conventional fluid bed processor both the steps of granulation and drying can be carried out in the same equipment thereby simplifying the process and saving the processing time. Compression may be carried out using equipments known in the art such as a rotary tablet press or any suitable tabletting machine fitted with suitable size punches and dies. Coating may be carried out using equipments known in the art such as spray coating or coating in conventional coating pan or perforated pans.<br>
