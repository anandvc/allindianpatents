The combined TBME phases are mixed with 50 ml water and 50 ml saturated Na2SOit dried with magnesium sulphate and evaporated at 45°C under vacuum to obtain a crude product.<br>
38.3 g crude product is dissolved in TBME (300 ml) at 40°C. The clear yellow solution is concentrated in a volume of 50 ml (240 ml TBME distilled off). The mixture is stirred for one hour at 40°C (crystallisation). 50 ml HPTF is added, the mixture is cooled to 0°C and stirred<br><br>
at 0°C for 1 hour. Evaporating and washing with 2 x 15 ml heptane fraction and drying overnight at 45°C under vacuum gives white crystals.<br>

Preparation of 4-(diphenyl-rydroxy-methyi)-benzoic acid (alternative method)<br><br>
After 30 min stirring at -5"C a solution of 1,55 kg benzophenone (8,50 moi) In 8 It TBME is added during a period of 2C min keeping the temperature between -5° and 0"C. The addition container is rinsed with 3 It T3ME. A very small amount of a white solid is formed. After 15 min stirring at -5°C a process control sample (HPLC 1) is taken. The reaction mixture is stirred for further 25 min at -5:C and warmed up to +25°C.<br>
3,2 kg n-butyllithium (20% n cyclohexane; 10,00 mol) is added during a period of 25 min keeping the temperature between +25 and 27°C. The addition is slightly exothermic and the colour turned to slightly green. Some precipitate and froth are formed. After 20 min stirring a process control sample is taken (HPLC 2). Depending on the result of HPLC 2 further 0,3 kg n-buthyllithium is added after stirring at 4-25°C for 35 min. After 15 min stirring a sample for process control is taken (r?LC 3). The lines of the n-buthyllithium addition are rinsed with 1,5 It TBME and the reaction is cooled to -10°C.<br><br>
1,99 kg dry ice (solid C02) is added portionwise during a period of 20 min keeping the temperature between -10 and -5°C. The reaction is exothermic and a slightly yellow precipitate is formed. After 15 min stirring at -10°C 11 l TBME are added and the reaction mixture is warmed to 0DC. 5 I 13% aqueous hydrochloric acid is added during a period of 15 min keeping the temperature between 0° and -r5°C. The addition is exothermic and the precipitate is dissolved (pH 
The clear solution is transferred to a separation tank and the reactor is rinsed ,\i;h 5 it TBME. After separation of the aqueous phase the organic phase is washed with 20 it water. After separation of the two layers the organic phase is extracted with 13 it 5°o aqueous KOH solution. The basic water phase is separated and the organic layer is extracted again ,vith 13 it 5% aqueous KOH solution. The combined basic aqueous layers are transferred to :he 1C0 It Hastelloy-Reactor. 22 I of TBME and 3 I aqueous-18% hydrochloric acid are added over a period of 20 min at a temperature between 0° and +5C. The addition is exothermic and a white precipitate is formed but it dissolves again at a low pH-value (pH 
 <br>
white precipitate is stirred for 2 h at 50°C JT. The jacked temperature is regulated at 0 = C and stirring is continued over night (16 h) letting cool down the suspension to 0rC. The white suspension is filtered off and the reactor is rinsed 5 times with 5 It of the mother licucr. The residue is dried at 45°C JT under vacuum (&gt;10 mbar) to constant weight (over night).<br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of Fmoc-(2Sr4P)'Pro(4-OCO-NH'CH2-CH2'NH-Boc)-OH starting from Cbo-(2S,4R)-Pro(4-OH)-OMe<br>
1. Dimethylaminopyridine (30.5 g, 250 mmol) and Cbo-(2S,4R)-Pro(4-OH)-OMe (34.9 gt 125 mmol) are dissolved in tciuene (870 ml). A solution of 4-nitrophenylchlorcformate (31.5 g, 157 mmol) in toluene (206 ml) is added dropwise to this solution at 0°C to 5 °C over 20 minutes and stirred for an additional 2 hours. This is followed by addition of a solution of Boc-ethylenediamine  (80.1   g,  500 mmol)  in  toluene  (205  ml)  and  stirring  at  ambient<br><br>
temperature for 12 hours. A solution of concentrated sulfuric acid (43.7 g, 450 mmol) in water (873 ml) is then added white maintaining a temperature of 20 °C to 25 °C. The white suspension is filtered by suction and washed with toluene (30 mi). The toluene phase is washed with water (450 ml), sodium carbonate (10% w/w, 450 ml) and three times with water (450 ml each). The toluene phase is azeotropically dried by distilling off 300 ml, which is continuously replaced by dry toluene (2 x 300 ml). Heptane (130 ml) is added to the dry toluene solution at 50 °C and cooled to 0°C over two hours. The precipitated product is filtered, washed two times with toluene/heptane 1:2 v/v (70 ml), and dried at 50 °C under vacuum to leave Cbo-(2S,4R)-Pro(4-OCO-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-Boc)-OMe as a white solid.<br>
2.	Cbo-(2S,4R)-Pro(4-OCO-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-Boc)-OMe (20.0 g, 43.0 mmol) is dissolved<br>
in a 1:1 mixture of tetrahydrofuran and methanol (380 ml). A 1 M sodium hydroxide solution<br>
(51.6 ml) is added and the resulting mixture stirred for 4 hours at ambient temperature. The<br>
mixture is adjusted to pH 3 by adding sulfuric acid (50 ml, 1 M). Tetrahydrofuran and<br>
methanol are distilled off at 50 °C and 50 mbar until no further solvents distil. The remaining<br><br>
3.	Palladium on charcoal (10%, 1.94 g, 0042 mmol) is added to a solution of Cbo-<br>
(2S,4R)-Pro(4-OCO-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-Boc)-OH (19.4 g, 43.0 mmol) in isopropanol (350 ml)<br>
and water (37 ml). Hydrogen is bubbled through this mixture for 4 hours, the catalyst is<br>
filtered off, and the residue is washed with a mixture of isopropanol (50ml) and water (50 ml).<br>
The isopropanol/ water phase is azeotropically dried by distilling off 2/3 of the volume, which<br>
is continuously replaced by a toluene/isopropanol mixture (1:1 v/v). The remaining dry<br>
solution is concentrated in vacuo to dryness (50 °C, 200 mbar) to leave (2S,4R)-Pro(4-OCO-<br>
NH-CH2-CH2-NH-Boc)-OH as a brownish solid, which was used without further purification.<br>
4.	(2S,4R)-Pro(4-OCO-NH-CHrCH2-NH-Boc)-OH (5.0 g, 15 mmol) is dissolved in a<br>
mixture of water (25 ml) and triethylamine (1.5 g, 15 mmol) at 40 °C. A solution of Fmoc-<br><br>
OSu (4.65 g, 14 mmol) in acetonitrile (25 ml) is added to the clear solution over 30 minutes and stirred for 2 hours. Then the reaction mixture is adjusted to pH 3 with hydrochloric acid (1 m, 13 ml) and stirred for a further hour. Acetonitrile is distilled off (40 °C, 80 mbar) and replaced by isopropyl acetate, affording a two-phase mixture. The lower aqueous phase is separated off, whilst the remaining organic layer is washed with water and distilled two times with replacement with isopropylacetate and then concentrated to a brownish foam. This foam is dissolved in isopropylacetate (25 ml) and added dropwise to heptane (200 mi) whereby the product is precipitated. The solid is filtered, washed with isopropylacetate/heptane and dried in vacuo at 40 °C to leave Fmoc-(2S,4R)-Pro(4-OCO-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-Boc)-OH.<br>
