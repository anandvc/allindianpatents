				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of a flavour-enriched garlic powder. This invention particularly relates to the preparation of garlic powder by incorporating the encapsulated garlic oil in dehydrated garlic powder and an edible, permitted diluent in specified proportions. Garlic (Allium sativum L.) finds use as a spice and a flavouring agent and in pharmaceutical preparations. It is characterised by a strong alliaceous odour due to the presence of organic sulphur compounds. Maceration or physical injury of the oil cells in fresh garlic cloves results in the precursor S-allyl cysteine sulphoxide (alliin) coming in contact with an enzyme, alliinase (C-S lyase), producing several sulphur compounds which are constituents of the oil of garlic.<br>
In hitherto known processes steam / hydrosteam distillation of garlic is well known resulting in volatile oil, the yield ranging from 0.1 to 0.2 % (V/W) depending on the variety used. The distillation can be carried out in the laboratory and the oil recovered using a Clevenger apparatus or bulk quantities of garlic can be distilled using a stainless<br>
steel 'still' of varying capacities connected to a condenser and a receiver. The garlic oil is generally dispersed in solvent carriers for marketing. The dehydration of garlic resulting in the removal of water thereby effecting a substantial reduction in bulk to produce garlic powder is also known. Dehydrated garlic powder is highly hygroscopic and since it is composed of saccharides, moisture pick-up causes rapid caking of the powdered product, followed by colour development characterised by the familiar "browning" reaction. Also, the surface area being large, the powder loses the volatiles over a period of storage. The drawbacks of hitherto known processes are detailed below:<br>
The garlic oil, on storage, becomes deep brown in colour thereby rendering it repulsive to use. Further, on storage for longer periods for more than six months, the oil polymerises to a thicker consistency.<br>
Since garlic powder is a valuable adjunct as a food flavouring, the loss of flavour needs to be compensated and enriched to make the process commercially more viable. The main object of the present invention is to provide "a process for the preparation of the flavour-<br>
enriched garlic power. Another object is to prepare a garlic powder with a brighter white colour by mixing garlic powder with encapsulated garlic power produced from garlic oil and permitted conventional diluent, emulsifying agent and anticaking agent. Still another object is to prepare a garlic power wherein loss of flavour is compensated and having a long shelf life.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of flavour enriched garlic powder which comprises , (i) preparing dehydrated garlic powder by conventional drying, milling, sieving and mixing with an anti caking agent , preferably with tri calcium phosphate , (ii) preparing encapsulated garlic oil by conventional hydro distillation of garlic clove , mixing the oil obtained from hydro distillation of garlic clove with natural gum and with an emulsifying agent as herein defined, chilling and spray drying the obtained mixture to get encapsulated garlic oil, (iii) blending the said encapsulated garlic oil with dehydrated garlic powder obtained in step (i) and with a permitted edible diluents at a ratio 3:l:6,(iv) adding to the obtained blend an anticaking agent as defined above, to get desired flavour enriched powder. In one of the embodiments of this invention, permitted diluent used may be such as polysaccharides preferably corn starch or mixtures thereof. In another embodiment of the invention, anionic emulsifying agent used may be polyoxyethylene mono oleate (Tween 80).<br>
In a still another embodiment of the invention, anticaking agent used   may    be    selected   from    tricalcium    phosphate,       calcium      stearate<br>
or mixtures thereof.The principle of the process of the present invention is micro encapsulation wherein the volatile flavour components in garlic are entrapped in an impermeable shell thereby protecting them from loss or deterioration in quality. The encapsulated garlic powder is then blended with dehydrated garhc powder / permitted diluent in varying proportions to obtain garhc powders with enriched flavour strength and better colour.<br>
This invention also relates to a process for encapsulation of garlic oil in a suitable edible carrier or a blend of carriers which is/are called the encapsulant(s). The garlic oil can be incorporated into an aqueous solution of the "wall" material(s) and homogenised to obtain an emulsion. The emulsion is then spray dried and the encapsulated garlic powder so obtained is blended with dehydrated garlic to produce flavour-enriched garlic powder. The process involved is generally described in the following flow diagram.<br>
( Diagram Removed)<br><br>
Flow diagram for the preparation of flavour enriched garlic powder<br><br>
The process is further illustrated by the following examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
Garlic cloves (5 Kg) are separated from the bulbs rejecting the outer cellulosic skin, flaked and then dried in a through flow dryer at 55°C for 6 h. The dried grits are powdered in an Apex hammer mill fitted with a 30u sieve . The powder is packed in airtight containers after mixing with tricalcium phosphate. Yield of dry garlic powder is 35%.<br>
Another portion of the cloves (5 Kg) is flaked and then pulped by passing through a Fryma colloid mill alongwith water (10 L) to obtain a slurry which is distilled for 4.5 h in a volatile oil distiilation still. The yield of garlic oil obtained is 0.42% (dry weight basis).<br>
An aqueous gum acacia solution (10% solids content) is prepared. Garlic oil (1% based on solids) is added to the solution and homogenised alongwith Tween 80 (0.2%)to form an emulsion. The gum acacia solution is chilled at 8°C and homogenised using a high speed homogeniser.<br>
The emulsion is dried using a spray dryer (Bowen Engg., New Jersey, USA) fitted with a 2-fluid nozzle, at an evaporation rate of 2.0 L water per hour; inlet air temperature and outlet temperature being 150°C and 90°C, respectively. The yield of spray dried powder is 75% and the garlic oil retained by the encapsulant is 70%.<br>
Enriched garlic powder is prepared by blending the encapsulated garlic powder with dehydrated garlic powder (moisture, 4% and volatile oil, 0.25% dwb) and corn starch in the ratio 3:1:6. Tricalcium phosphate is then added as anticaking agent at 2% (WAV) and the mixture blended in a Sigma mixer. The product is stored at ambient temperature after packing in any moisture proof flexible or airtight rigid packaging material.<br>
Example 2 Using the same varieties of fresh garlic as referred in example 1, the garlic oil is prepared in 15 kg batches by steam distilling the garlic slurry until the oil collected is 100 ml. The oil is incorporated at 3% on gum acacia pulvis: maltodextrin (2:1) contained in the aqueous solution (30% W/W). The mixture is homogenised well alongwith Tween 80 (0.2%) to form an emulsion wherein the size of the particles<br>
are of the order of 5µ. The emulsion is chilled 8° C and spray dried employing "Anhydro" dryer fitted with a rotary atomiser. The inlet air temperature and outlet temperature are maintained at 170°C and 110°C while the infeed flow at 18 L/h. The yield of spray dried powder is about 90%.<br>
The encapsulated spray dried garlic powder is blended with corn starch in the ratio 3:7 to obtain enriched garlic powder with enhanced flavour strength, vis-a-vis, garlic oil content (0.6%). Calcium stearate is added as anticaking agent at 2% (WAV)and the mixture blended in a Sigma mixer.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
