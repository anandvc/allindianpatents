RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001] This application is related to the following U.S. applications: Serial<br>
Number 60/605,020 filed August 27,2004, Serial Number 60/617,170 filed October 8, 2004,<br>
Serial Number 60/625,676 filed November 5, 2004, and Serial Number 60/683,169 filed<br>
May 19,2005, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The hedgehog signaling pathway is essential for numerous processes during<br>
embryonic development. Members of the hedgehog family of secreted proteins control cell<br>
proliferation, differentiation and tissue patterning. The pathway was first deciphered in the fruit<br>
fly Drosophila, but since has been shown to be highly conserved in invertebrates and<br>
vertebrates, including humans. The overall activity of the hedgehog signaling pathway declines<br>
after emtayogenesis in most cells, but the pathway remains active in certain adult cell types. Recently, it has been shown that uncontrolled activation of the hedgehog pathway results in certain types of cancer as detailed below.	<br>
[0003] The Hedgehog polypeptide is a secreted protein that functions as a signaling ligand in<br>
the hedgehog pathway. Exemplary hedgehog genes and proteins are described in PCT<br>
publications WO 95/18856 and WO 96/17924. Three different forms of the hedgehog protein<br>
are found in humans; Sonic hedgehog (Shh), Desert hedgehog (Dhh) and Indian hedgehog (Ihh).<br>
Sonic hedgehog is the most prevalent hedgehog member in mammals and also is the best<br>
characterizedligand of the hedgehog family. Prior to secretion, Shh undergoes an intramolecular<br>
cleavage and lipid modification reaction. The lipid modified peptide is responsible for all<br>
signaling activities<br>
[0004] Two transmembrane proteins are involved in signal transduction of in the hedgehog<br>
pathway; the twelve-transmembrane Patched receptor (Ptc) and the seven-transmembrane<br>
Smoothened protein (Smo).<br>
[0005] The findings in the art suggest that Hedgehog acts by binding to Ptc, thereby<br>
releasing an inhibitory effect of Ptc on Smo. Since Ptc and Smo are both transmembrane<br>
proteins, a proposed scenario is that they physically associate to form a receptor complex,<br><br>
though indirect mechanisms of action are also plausible. The derepression of Smo from Ptc<br>
inhibition most likely involves a conformational change in Smo. Ptc, however, is not essential<br>
for Smo's activity, since Smo becomes constitutively activated in the complete absence of<br>
Patched protein (Alcedo et al, supra; Quirk et al. (1997) Cold Spring Harbor Svmp. Quant.<br>
Biol. 62: 217-226). Once Smo is derepressed it is rapidly and highly phosphorylated and<br>
transduces a signal that activates transcription via the Gli transcription factors (homologue of<br>
Dropophila Ci protein) (Alexandre et al. (1996) Genes Dev. 10: 2003-13)). The Glil<br>
transcription factor up-regulates many genes involved in growth and development (Alexandre et<br>
al., supra). Hedgehog signaling is essential in many stages of development, especially in<br>
formation of left-right symmetry. Loss or reduction of hedgehog signaling leads to multiple<br>
developmental deficits and malformations, one of the most striking of which is cyclopia (Belloni<br>
et al. (1996) Nature Genetics 14: 353-6).<br>
[0006] Recently, it has been reported that activating hedgehog pathway mutations occur in<br>
sporadic basal cell carcinoma (Xie et al. (1998) Nature 391: 90-2) and primitive<br>
neuroectodermal tumors of the central nervous system (Reifenberger et al. (1998) Cancer Res<br>
58: 1798-803). Uncontrolled activation of the hedgehog pathway has also been shown in<br>
numerous cancer types such as GI tract cancers including pancreatic, esophageal, gastric cancer<br>
-(Berman et aI (2003) Nature 425: 846-51, Thayer et al. (2003) Nature 425: 851-56) lung cancer<br>
(Watkins et al (2003) Nature 422: 313-317, prostate cancer (Karhadkar et al (2004) Nature 431:<br>
707-12, Sheng et al. (2004) Molecular Cancer 3: 29-42, Fan et al. (2004) Endocrinology 145:<br>
3961-70), breast cancer (Kubo et al (2004) Cancer Research 64: 6071-74, Lewis et al (2004)<br>
Journal of Mammary Gland Biology and Neoplasia 2: 165-181) and hepatocellular cancer<br>
(Sicklick et al. (2005) ASCO conference, Mohini et al. (2005) AACR conference).<br>
[0007] Small molecule inhibition of hedgehog pathway activity has been shown to result in<br>
cell death in a number of different cancer types having uncontrolled hedgehog pathway<br>
activation (See, for example, Berman et al, 2003 Nature 425: 846-51).<br>
[0008] Hedgehog pathway antagonists are currently being explored in a large number of<br>
clinical conditions where a therapeutic effect can be obtained for a condition or disorder by<br>
inhibiting one or more aspects of Hedgehog pathway activity. Although the primary focus has<br>
been on cancer, investigators have found that small molecule inhibition of the hedgehog<br>
pathway has been shown to ameliorate the symptoms of psoriasis (Tas, et al, 2004 Dermatology<br>
209:126-131, published US patent application 20040072913 (herein incorporated by<br>
reference)). Psoriasis is a very common, chronic skin disorder typically characterized by skin<br><br>
lesions usually containing erythematous papules and plaques with a silver scale, although there<br>
are variations both on the skin and in other parts of the body. Psoriasis is currently thought to be<br>
an autoimmune disease but its etiology is still poorly understood.<br>
[0009] A hedgehog pathway inhibitor that has attracted considerable interest is the natural<br>
product cyclopamine. Cyclopamine was first isolated from the lily Veratrum califomicum in<br>
1966 after it was found that the offspring of grazing sheep were bom with severe birth<br>
deformities. In an effort to identify the agent(s) responsible for causing these birth deformities,<br>
the FDA investigated possible sources of tetragens and identified the jervine family of steroidal<br>
alkaloids, including the compound cyclopamine, as the tetragens responsible for the birth<br>
deformities.<br>
[0010] Much later, it was found that cyclopamine's mechanism of action was through the<br>
inhibition of hedgehog pathway activity (Cooper et al. (1998) Science 280: 1603-7, Ch.ea.etal,<br>
(2002) Genes and Development 16: 2743-8). Cyclopamine and related compounds have been<br>
shown to have anticancer activities through action on the hedgehog pathway. Despite initial<br>
promise, no members of this family of compounds, or analogues thereof, have been successfully<br>
developed as an anticancer agent. The present invention fulfills this need and has other related<br>
advantages.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0011] The present invention provides analogs of steroidal alkaloids of the cyclopamine family that are useful for inhibiting proliferation of cells and/or promoting apoptosis in a cell,<br>
such as in the treatment of proliferative disorders such as cancers. The hedgehog pathway antagonists of the present invention may be used to inhibit proliferation (or other biological consequences) of cells or tissues, such as in a patient, characterized as having a Ptc loss-of- <br>
function phenotype, a Smo gain-of-function phenotype or a Hedgehog gain-of-function<br>
phenotype.<br>
[0012] In certain uses, the present methods are used to counteract the phenotypic effects of<br>
unwanted activation of a Hedgehog pathway, such as resulting from hedgehog gain-of-function,<br>
Ptc loss-of- function or Smo gain-of-function mutations. For instance, the present methods can<br>
involve contacting a cell {in vitro or in vivo) with a hedgehog pathway antagonist of the present<br>
invention (defined below) in an amount sufficient to antagonize Smo-dependent pathway<br>
activation. Such antagonism will stop or slow unwanted cell proliferation and can lead to cell<br>
death.<br><br>
[0013] In certain embodiments, the methods and compounds of the present invention may be<br>
used to regulate proliferation of cells and/or cell death in vitro and/or in vivo such as in the<br>
treatment of malignant disorders of the head, neck, nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, nasopharynx,<br>
oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, hypopharynx, salivary glands, paragangliomas, pancreas,<br>
stomach, skin, esophagus, liver and biliary tree, bone, intestine, colon, rectum, ovaries, prostate,<br>
lung, breast, lymphatic system, blood, bone marrow central nervous system, or brain.<br>
[0014] In certain embodiments, the methods and compounds of the present invention may be<br>
used to treat the symptoms of psoriasis in a subject. The compounds of the present invention<br>
may be used to treat psoriasis as a single agent or in combination with one or more anti-psoriasis<br>
agents. In particular embodiments, the compounds of the present invention are topically<br>
administered to a subject in need thereof.<br>
[0015] The compounds of the present invention may be further formulated as a<br>
pharmaceutical preparation comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, for<br>
administration to a patient as a means of treating cancer. The hedgehog pathway antagonists of<br>
the present invention and/or preparations comprising them may be administered to a patient to<br>
treat conditions involving unwanted cell proliferation, e. g., cancer and/or tumors of the head,<br>
neck, nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, nasopharynx, oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx,<br>
hypopharynx, salivary glands, paragangliomas, pancreas, stomach, skin, esophagus, liver and<br>
biliary tree, bone, intestine, colon, rectum, ovaries, prostate, lung, breast, lymphatic system,<br>
blood, bone marrow central nervous system, or brain. In certain embodiments, such compounds<br>
or preparations are administered systemically, e.g. parenterally and/or locally, e. g., topically.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Definitions<br>
[0016] The definitions of terms used herein are meant to incorporate the present state-of-the-<br>
art definitions recognized for each term in the chemical and pharmaceutical fields. Where<br>
appropriate, exemplification is provided. The definitions apply to the terms as they are used<br>
throughout this specification, unless otherwise limited in specific instances, either individually<br>
or as part of a larger group.<br>
[0017] The term "heteroatom" is art-recognized and refers to an atom of any element other<br>
than carbon or hydrogen. Illustrative heteroatoms include boron, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus,<br>
sulfur and selenium.<br><br>
[0018] The term "alkyl" is art-recognized, and includes saturated aliphatic groups, including<br>
straight-chain alkyl groups, branched-chain alkyl groups, cycloalkyl (alicyclic) groups, alkyl<br>
substituted cycloalkyl groups, and cycloalkyl substituted alkyl groups. In certain embodiments, a<br>
straight chain or branched chain alkyl has about 30 or fewer carbon atoms in its backbone (e.g.,<br>
C-1-C30 for straight chain, C3-C30 for branched chain), and alternatively, about 20 or fewer.<br>
Likewise, cycloalkyls have from about 3 to about 10 carbon atoms in their ring structure, and<br>
alternatively about 5, 6 or 7 carbons in the ring structure. Alkyl groups, unless otherwise<br>
specified, may optionally be substituted with suitable substituents. The number of substituents<br>
is typically limited by the number of available valences on the alkyl group; thus an alkyl group<br>
may be substituted by replacement of one or more of the hydrogen atoms that would be present<br>
on the unsubstituted group, suitable substituents for alkyl groups include halo, =0, =N-CN, =N-<br>
OR\ =NR\ OR', NR'2, SR', S02R', S02NR'2, NR'S02R', NR'CONR'2) NR'COOR',<br>
NR'COR', CN, COOR', CONR'2, OOCR', COR', and N02, wherein each R' is independently<br>
H, C1-C6 alkyl, C2-C6 heteroalkyl, C1-C6 acyl, C2-C6 heteroacyl, C6-C10 aryl, C5-C10 heteroaryl,<br>
C7-C12 arylalkyl, or C6-C12 heteroarylalkyl, each of which is optionally substituted with one or<br>
more groups selected from halo, C1-C4 alkyl, C1-C4 heteroalkyl, Q-C6 acyl, C1-C6 heteroacyl,<br>
hydroxy, amino, and =0; and wherein two R' on the same substituent or on adjacent atoms can<br>

from N, O and S;<br>
[0019] Unless the number of carbons is otherwise specified, "lower alkyl" refers to an alkyl<br>
group, as defined above, but having from one to about ten carbons, alternatively from one to<br>
about six carbon atoms in its backbone structure. Likewise, "lower alkenyl" and "lower<br>
alkynyl" have similar chain lengths.<br>
[0020] The term "aralkyl" is art-recognized and refers to an alkyl group substituted with an<br>
aryl group (e.g., an aromatic or heteroaromatic group).<br>
[0021] The terms "alkenyl" and "alkynyl" are art-recognized and refer to unsaturated<br>
aliphatic groups analogous in length and possible substitution to the alkyls described above, but<br>

double and triple bonds. Alkenyl and alkynyl groups are also optionally substituted unless<br>
otherwise specified, by the same substituents described above for alkyl groups.<br>
[0022] "Heteroalkyl", "heteroalkenyl", and "heteroalkynyl" and the like are defined<br>
similarly to the corresponding hydrocarbyl (alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl) groups, but the 'hetero'<br>
terms refer to groups that contain 1-3 O, S or N heteroatoms or combinations thereof within the<br><br>
backbone residue; thus at least one carbon atom of a corresponding alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl<br>
grouy ,s replaced by one of the specified heteroatoms to form a heteroalkyl, hetero alkenyl, or<br>
heteroalkynyl group. The typical and preferred sizes for heteroforms of alkyl, alkenyl and<br>
alkynyl groups are generally the same as for the corresponding hydrocarbyl groups, and the<br>
substituents that may be present on the heteroforms are the same as those described above for<br>
the hydrocarbyl groups. For reasons of chemical stability, it is also understood that, unless<br>
otherwise specified, such groups do not include more than two contiguous heteroatoms except<br>
where an oxo group is present on N or S as hi a sulfonyl group.<br>
[0023] The term "aryl" is art-recognized and refers to 5-, 6- and 7-membered single-ring<br>

carbons are common to two adjoining rings (the rings are "fused rings") wherein at least one of<br>
the rings is aromatic, e.g., the other cyclic rings maybe cycloalkyls, cycloalkenyls,<br>
cycloalkynyls, aryls and/or heterocyclyls.<br>
[0024] The terms ortho, meta and para are art-recognized and refer to 1,2-, 1,3- and 1,4-<br>

more rings (e.g., cycloalkyls, cycloalkenyls, cycloalkynyls, aryls and/or heterocyclyls) in which<br>
two or more carbons are common to two adjoining rings, e.g., the rings are "fused rings". Rings<br>
that are joined through non-adjacent atoms are termed "bridged" rings. Each of the rings of the<br>
polycycle may be substituted with such substituents as described above, as for example,<br>
halogen, alkyl, aralkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, hydroxyl, amino, nitro, sulfhydryl, imino,<br>

[0032] The term "alkylthio" refers to an alkyl group, as defined above, having a sulfur<br>
radical attached thereto. In certain embodiments, the "alkylthio" moiety is represented by one of<br>
-S-alkyl, -S-alkenyl, -S-alkynyl, and -S-(CH2)m-R61, wherein m and R61 are defined above.<br>
Representative alkylthio groups include methylthio, ethyl thio, and the like.<br>

pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.<br><br>
^Synthesis of SteroidaLAlkaloid Compounds J<br>
[03C2p] The cyclopropyl steroidal alkaloid derivatives of the present invention can be<br>
prepared directly from a steroidal alkaloid isolated as a natural product (or synthesized) or N-<br>
protected forms of these compounds. Suitable nitrogen protecting groups include, but are not<br>
limited to Fmoc, Alloc, Boc, Troc, trifluoroacetate, Tosyl, Cbz, ethyl cyanide, and Bn.<br>
[0121] A variety of cyclopropanating agents can be used to cyclopropanate the steroidal<br>
alkaloid. 1,1-Haloalkylmetal complexes, including reactive species referred to as carbenoids, are<br>
commonly used to cyclopropanate olefins. These reagents are typically made using a<br>
diiodoalkane or diazoalkane and a metal or organometalic species such as EtzZn, ZB113AI,<br>
samarium, copper, rhodium, or palladium, hi certain embodiments, Et2Zn and diiodomethane are<br>
used to affect the cyclopropanation. Other known cyclopropanation methods such as those<br>
utilizing sulfur ylides to react with an olefin conjugated to a carbonyl to add a CH2 or CH-alkyl<br>
or CH-aryl group, and metal-catalyzed decomposition of diazoalkyl and a-diazo-carbonyl<br>
compounds, such as diazomethane and ethyl diazoacetate, can also be used: these methods<br>
readily provide cyclopropanes having alkyl, aryl, alkoxycarbonyl (-COOR), or acyl<br>
substituents. For example, the addition of ethyl diazopropionate (EtChC-C^TSy-Me) to an<br>
olefinic compound in an organic solvent containing a metal catalyst such as copper or palladium<br>
results in formation of a cyclopropane containing a group represented by formula lb wherein Z<br>
represents C(R23)2, in which one R23 is Me and the other R23 is COOEt.<br>
[0122] By carefully selecting the cyclopropanating agent, site selectivity can be achieved in<br>
the cyclopropanation of steroidal alkaloids with more than one olefin. For example, if<br>
diiodomethane and Et2Zn are used to cyclopropanate jervine under certain conditions only the<br>
more electron rich olefin will react.<br>
[0123] The diastereoselectivity of the cj'clopropanation can be controlled in a number of<br>
ways. For example, lowering the temperature of the cyclopropanation reaction can lead to higher<br>
diastereoselectivities. Alternatively, a chiral cyclopropanating agent can be used that can<br>
distinguish between each diastereo-face of the steroidal alkaloid. Facial selectivity in the<br>
cyclopropanation can also be achieved by using substrate directed reactions (i.e.<br>
cyclopropanation of allylic alcohols using Et2Zn/CH2l2 reagents).<br>
[0124] The cyclopropanation reactions may be conducted in an aprotic solvent, preferably<br>
one in which the reaction ingredients are substantially soluble. Suitable solvents include ethers,<br>
such as diethyl ether, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, diglyme, t-butyl methyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and<br>
the like; halogenated solvents, such as chloroform, dichloromefhane, dichloroethane, and the<br><br>
like; aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon solvents, such as benzene, xylene, toluene, hexane,<br>
pentane and the like; esters and ketones, such as ethyl acetate, acetone, and 2-butanone; polar<br>
aprotic solvents, such as acetonitrile, dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, and the like; or<br>
combinations of two or more solvents. In a preferred embodiment, dichloromethane is the<br>
solvent used for the cyclopropanation when a dialkyl zinc and diiodomethane is used.<br>
[0125] Following synthesis of the cyclopropanated steroidal alkaloid core, the compound<br>
maybe derivatized using a variety of functionalization reactions known in the art.<br>
Representative examples include palladium coupling reactions to alkenylhalides or aryl halides,<br>
oxidations, reductions, reactions with nucleophiles, reactions with electrophiles, pericyclic<br>
reactions, installation of protecting groups, removal of protecting groups, and the like.<br>
[0126] In the presence of Lewis or Bronsted acids the cyclopropyl cyclopamine analogs of<br>
the present invention undergo a hereto unobserved rearrangement and ring expansion to afford<br>
novel cyclopamine analogs in which the D ring has been, expanded by one carbon. The<br>
cyclopropyl ring may be substituted or unsubstituted. In cases where the cyclopropyl ring is<br>
substituted, the groups attached to the methylene of the cyclopropane will be installed onto the<br>
D ring after rearrangement and ring expansion. Suitable acids include, but are not limited to<br>
ZnL;, BF3, methanesulfonic acid, diaryloxyphosporic acids, and HC1. In a preferred embodiment<br>
of the invention the Lewis acid used is BF3. These homologated analogs maybe further<br>
functionalized using a variety of functionalization reactions known in the art. Representative<br>
examples include palladium coupling reactions to alkenylhalides or aryl halides, oxidations,<br>
reductions, reactions with nucleophiles, reactions with electrophiles, pericyclic reactions,<br>
installation of protecting groups, removal of protecting groups, and the like.<br>
/' Methods of the Invention }<br>
V_|ftl27] The present invention further provides methods for treating, ameliorating one or<br>
more of the symptoms of, and reducing the severity of hyperproliferative disorders, i.e. cancer,<br>
as well as other hedgehog pathway mediated disorders or conditions.<br>
[0128] Hedgehog pathway antagonists are currently being explored in a large number of<br>
clinical conditions where a therapeutic effect can be obtained for a condition or disorder by<br>
inhibiting one or more aspects of Hedgehog pathway activity. Although the primary focus has<br>
been on cancer, investigators have found that small molecule inhibition of the hedgehog<br>
pathway ameliorates the symptoms of psoriasis (Tas, et al, 2004 Dermatology 209: 126-131,<br>
published US patent application 20040072913 (herein incorporated by reference)). Psoriasis is a<br><br>
veiy common, chronic skin disorder typically characterized by skin lesions usually containing<br>
erythematous papules and plaques with a silver scale, although there are variations both on the<br>
skin and in other parts of the body. Psoriasis is currently thought to be an autoimmune disease<br>
but its etiology is still poorly understood. In one study, topical application of cyclopamine to<br>
psoriasis lesions led to full or partial regression of the lesion with a decrease in inflammatory<br>
cells (Tas et al, supra).<br>
[0129] The hedgehog pathway antagonists of the present invention may be used to treat or<br>
prevent psoriasis when administered as a single agent or when administered in combination with<br>
one or more other anti-psoriasis agents including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, tar,<br>
calcipotriene, tazarotene, calcineurin inhibitors, ultraviolet irradiation, methotrexate, retinoids,<br>
cyclosporine, immunomodulatory drugs, etanercept, alefacept, efalizumab, and infliximab.<br>
[0130] Many tumors and proliferative conditions have been shown to depend on the<br>
hedgehog pathway. The growth of such cells and survival can be affected by treatment with the<br>
compounds of the present invention. For example, small molecule inhibition of the hedgehog<br>
pathway has been shown to inhibit the growth of basal cell carcinoma (Williams, et al, 2003<br>
PNAS 100: 4616-21), medulloblastoma (Berman et al, 2002 Science 297: 1559-61), pancreatic<br>
cancer (Berman et al, 2003 Nature 425: 846-51), gastrointestinal cancers (Berman et al, 2003<br>
Nature 425: 846-51, published PCT application WO 05/013800), esophageal cancer (Berman et<br>
al, 2003 Nature 425: 846-51), lung cancer (Watkins et al, 2003. Nature 422: 313-7), and<br>
prostate cancer (Karhadkar et al, 2004. Nature 431_: 707-12).<br>
[0131] In addition, it has been shown that many cancer types have uncontrolled activation of<br>
the hedgehog pathway, for example, breast cancer (Kubo et al, 2004. Cancer Research 64:<br>

[0151] The chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation therapy can be administered according<br>
to therapeutic protocols well known in the art. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that<br>
the administration of the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation therapy can be varied<br>
depending on the disease being treated and the known effects of the chemotherapeutic agent<br>
and/or radiation therapy on that disease. Also, in accordance with the knowledge of the skilled<br>
clinician, the therapeutic protocols (e.g., dosage amounts and times of administration) can be<br>
varied in view of the observed effects of the administered therapeutic agents (i.e., antineoplastic<br>
agent or radiation) on the patient, and in view of the observed responses of the disease to the<br>
administered therapeutic agents, and observed adverse affects.<br>
[0152] Also, in general, compounds of the present invention and the chemotherapeutic agent<br>
do not have to be administered in the same pharmaceutical composition, and may, because of<br>
different physical and chemical characteristics, have to be administered by different routes. For<br><br>
example, compounds of the present invention may be administered intravenously to generate<br>
and maintain good blood levels, while the chemotherapeutic agent may be administered orally.<br>
The determination of the mode of administration and the advisability of administration, where<br>
possible, in the same pharmaceutical composition, is well within the knowledge of the skilled<br>
clinician. The initial administration can be made according to established protocols known in the<br>
art, and then, based upon the observed effects, the dosage, modes of administration and times of<br>
administration can be modified by the skilled clinician.<br>
[0153] The particular choice of chemotherapeutic agent or radiation will depend upon the<br>
diagnosis of the physicians and their judgment of the condition of the patient and the appropriate<br>
treatment protocol.<br>
[0154] A compound of the present invention, and chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation<br>
may be administered concurrently (e.g., simultaneously, essentially simultaneously or within the<br>
same treatment protocol) or sequentially, depending upon the nature of the proliferative disease,<br>
the condition of the patient, and the actual choice of chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation to<br>
be administered in conjunction (i.e., within a single treatment protocol) with a compound of the<br>
present invention.<br>
[0155] If a compound of the present invention and the chemotherapeutic agent and/or<br>
radiation are not administered simultaneously or essentially simultaneously, then the optimum<br>
order of administration of the compound of the present invention, and the chemotherapeutic<br>
agent and/or radiation, may be different for different tumors. Thus, in certain situations the<br>
compound of the present invention may be administered first followed by the administration of<br>
the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation; and in other situations the chemotherapeutic agent<br>
and/or radiation may be administered first followed by the administration of a compound of the<br>
present invention. This alternate administration may be repeated during a single treatment<br>
protocol. The determination of the order of administration, and the number of repetitions of<br>
administration of each therapeutic agent during a treatment protocol, is well within the<br>
knowledge of the skilled physician after evaluation of the disease being treated and the condition<br>
of the patient. For example, the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation maybe administered<br>
first, especially if it is a cytotoxic agent, and then the treatment continued with the<br>
administration of a compound of the present invention followed, where determined<br>
advantageous, by the administration of the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation, and so on<br>
until the treatment protocol is complete.<br><br>
[0156] Thus, in accordance with experience and knowledge, the practicing physician can<br>
modify each protocol for the administration of a component (therapeutic agent, i.e., compound<br>
of the present invention, chemotherapeutic agent or radiation) of the treatment according to the<br>
individual patient's needs, as the treatment proceeds.<br>
Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
[0157] In another embodiment, the present invention provides pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
compositions which comprise a therapeutically-effective amount of one or more of the<br>
compounds described above (Formula 1 and 2), formulated together with one or more	/<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers (additives) and/or diluents. The pharmaceutical	I<br>
compositions of the present invention may be specially formulated for administration in solid or ^<br>
liquid form, including those adapted for the following: (1) oral administration, for example,<br>
drenches (aqueous or non-aqueous solutions or suspensions), tablets, e.g., those targeted for I<br>
buccal, sublingual, and systemic absorption, boluses, powders, granules, pastes for application to j<br>
the tongue; (2) parenteral administration, for example, by subcutaneous, hitramuscular,	|<br>
intravenous or epidural injection as, for example, a sterile solution or suspension, or sustained- ]<br>
release formulation; (3) topical application, for example, as a cream, ointment, or a controlled-<br>
release patch or spray applied to the skin; (4) intravaginally or intrarectally, for example, as a<br>
pessary, cream or foam; (5) sublingually; (6) ocularly; (7) transdermally; (8) pulmonarily, or (9)<br>
nasally. As set out above, certain embodiments of the present compounds may contain a basic<br>
functional group, such as amino or alkylamino, and are, thus, capable of forming<br>
pharmaceutically-acceptable salts wim pharmaceutically-acceptable acids. The term<br>
"pharmaceutically-acceptable salts" in this respect, refers-to the relatively non-toxic, inorganic<br>
and organic acid addition salts of compounds of the present invention. These salts can be<br>
prepared in situ in the administration vehicle or the dosage form manufacturing process, or by<br>
separately reacting a purified compound of the invention in its free base form with a suitable /<br>
organic or inorganic acid, and isolating the salt thus formed during subsequent purification. /<br>
Representative salts include the hydrobromide, hydrochloride, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, /<br>
nitrate, acetate, valerate, oleate, palmitate, stearate, laurate, benzoate, lactate, phosphate,<br>
tosylate, citrate, maleate, fumarate, succinate, tartrate, napthylate, mesylate, glucoheptonate,<br>
lactobionate, and laurylsulphonate salts and the like. (See, for example, Berge et al. (1977)<br>
"Pharmaceutical Salts", J. Pharm, Sci. 66:1-19)<br><br>
[0158] The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the present invention<br>
include the conventional nontoxic salts or quaternary ammonium salts of the compounds, e.g.,<br>
from non-toxic organic or inorganic acids. For example, such conventional nontoxic salts<br>
include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloride, hydrobromic, sulfuric,'<br>
sulfamic, phosphoric, nitric, and the like; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as<br>
acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, palmitic,<br>
maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicyclic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxybenzoic,<br>
fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, isothionic, and the like.<br>
[0159] In other cases, the compounds of the present invention may contain one or more<br>
acidic functional groups and, thus, are capable of forming pharmaceutically-acceptable salts<br>
with pharmaceutically-acceptable bases. The term "pharmaceutically-acceptable salts" in these<br>
instances refers to the relatively non-toxic, inorganic and organic base addition salts of<br>
compounds of the present invention. These salts can likewise be prepared in situ in the<br>
administration vehicle or the dosage form manufacturing process, or by separately reacting the<br>
purified compound in its free acid form with a suitable base, such as the hydroxide, carbonate or<br>
bicarbonate of a pharmaceutically-acceptable metal cation, with ammonia, or with a<br>
pharmaceutically-acceptable organic primary, secondary or tertiary amine. Representative alkali<br>
or alkaline earth salts include the lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and<br>
aluminum salts and the like. Representative organic amines useful for the fonnation of base<br>
addition salts include ethylamine, diethylamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine,<br>
diethanolamine, piperazine and the like. (See, for example, Berge et al, supra)<br>
[0160] Wetting agents, emulsifiers and lubricants, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and<br>
magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, release agents, coating agents, sweetening,<br>
flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the<br>
compositions.<br>
[0161] Examples of pharmaceutically-acceptable antioxidants include: (1) water soluble<br>
antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, cysteine hydrochloride, sodium bisulfate, sodium<br>
metabisulfite, sodium sulfite and the like; (2) oil-soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbyl<br>
palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), lecithin, propyl<br>
gallate, alpha-tocopherol, and the like; and (3) metal chelating agents, such as citric acid,<br>
emylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), sorbitol, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like.<br>
[0162] Methods of preparing these formulations or compositions include the step of bringing<br>
into association a compound of the present invention with the carrier and, optionally, one or<br><br>
more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and<br>
intimately bringing into association a compound of the present invention with liquid carriers, or<br>
finely divided solid carriers, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.<br>
[0163] Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention suitable for parenteral<br>
administration comprise one or more compounds of the invention in combination with one or<br>
more pharmaceutically-acceptable sterile isotonic aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions,<br>
suspensions or emulsions, or sterile powders which may be reconstituted into sterile injectable<br>
solutions or dispersions just prior to use, which may contain sugars, alcohols, antioxidants,<br>
buffers, bacteriostats, solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the<br>
intended recipient or suspending or thickening agents.<br>
[0164] Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers winch maybe employed in<br>
the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water, ethanol, polyols (such as<br>
glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof,<br>
vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper<br>
fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the<br>
maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.<br>
[0165] These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting<br>
agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms<br>
upon the compounds of the present invention may be ensured by the inclusion of various<br>
antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and<br>
the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and<br>
the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable<br>
pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption<br>
such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.<br>
[0166] In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is desirable to slow the<br>
absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished<br>
by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material having poor water<br>
solubility. The rate of absorption of the dmg then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in<br>
turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a<br>
parenterally-administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an<br>
oil vehicle.<br>
[0167] Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the<br>
compounds of the present invention in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-<br><br>
polyglycolide. Depending on the ratio of drug to polymer, and the nature of the particular<br>
polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable<br>
polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also<br>
prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with<br>
body tissue.<br>
[0168] Formulations of the invention suitable for oral administration may be in the form of<br>
capsules, cachets, pills, tablets, lozenges (using a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or<br>
tragacanth), powders, granules, or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous<br>
liquid, or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion, or as an elixir or syrup, or as<br>
pastilles (using an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia) and/or as<br>
mouth washes and the like, each containing a predetermined amount of a compound of the<br>
present invention as an active ingredient. A compound of the present invention may also be<br>
administered as a bolus, electuary or paste.<br>
[0169] When the compounds of the present invention are administered as pharmaceuticals,<br>
to humans and animals, they can be given per se or as a pharmaceutical composition containing,<br>
for example, 0.1 to 99% (more preferably, 10 to 30%) of active ingredient in combination with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
[0170] These compounds may be administered to humans and other animals for therapy by<br>
any suitable route of administration, including orally, nasally, as by, for example, a spray,<br>
rectally, intravaginally, parenterally, intracisternally and topically, as by powders, ointments or<br>
drops, including buccally and sublingually.<br>
[0171] Regardless of the route of administration selected, the compounds of the present<br>
invention, which may be used in a suitable hydrated form, and/or the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of the present invention, are formulated into pharmaceutically-acceptable dosage<br>
forms by conventional methods known to those of skill in the art.<br>
[0172] Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of<br>
the present invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is<br>
effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, composition, and<br>
mode of administration, without being toxic to the patient.<br>
[0173] The selected dosage level will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity<br>
of the particular compound of the present invention employed, or the ester, salt or amide thereof,<br>
the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion or metabolism of the<br>
particular compound being employed, the rate and extent of absorption, the duration of the<br><br>
treatment, other drugs, compounds and/or materials used in combination with the particular<br>
compound employed, the age, sex, weight, condition, general health and prior medical history of<br>
the patient being treated, and like factors well known in the medical arts.<br>
[0174] A physician or veterinarian having ordinary skill in the art can readily determine and<br>
prescribe the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition required. For example, the<br>
physician or veterinarian could start doses of the compounds of the invention employed in the<br>
pharmaceutical composition at levels lower than that required in order to achieve the desired<br>
therapeutic effect and gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved.<br>
[0175] In general, a suitable daily dose of a compound of the invention will be that amount<br>
of the compound which is the lowest dose effective to produce a therapeutic effect. Such an<br>
effective dose will generally depend upon the factors described above. Generally, oral,<br>
intravenous, intracerebro ventricular and subcutaneous doses of the compounds of the present<br>
invention for a patient, when used for the indicated analgesic effects, will range from about<br>
0.0001 to about 100 mg per kilogram of body weight per day.<br>
[0176] If desired, the effective daily dose of the active compound may be administered as<br>
two, three, four, five, six or more sub-doses administered separately at appropriate intervals<br>

Example 26<br>
Inhibition of the Hedgehog pathway in cell culture using analogs of cyclopamine<br>
[0233] Hedgehog pathway specific cancer cell killing effects may be ascertained using the<br>
following assay. C3H10T1/2 cells differentiate into osteoblasts when contacted with the sonic<br>
hedgehog peptide (Shh-N). Upon differentiation; these osteoblasts produce high levels of<br>
alkaline phosphatase (AP) which can be measured in an enzymatic assay (Nakamura et ah, 1997<br>
BBRC 237: 465). Compounds that block the differentiation of C3H10T1/2 into osteoblasts (a<br>
Shh dependent event) can therefore be identified by a reduction in AP production (van der Horst<br>
et al., 2003 Bone 33: 899). The assay details are described below. The results approximate<br>
(EC50 for inhibition) of the differentiation assay is shown below in Table 1.<br>
Assay Protocol<br>
Cell Culture<br>
[0234] Mouse embryonic mesoderm fibroblasts C3H10T1/2 cells (obtained from ATCC)<br>
were cultured in Basal MEM Media (Gibco/Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated<br>
FBS (Hyclone), 50 units/ml penicillin and 50ug/ml streptomycin (Gibco/Invitrogen) at 37C with<br>
5% C02 in air atmosphere.<br>
Alkaline Phosphatase Assay<br>
[0235] C3H10T1/2 cells were plated in 96 wells with a density of 8xl03 cells/well. Cells<br>
were grown to confluence (72hrs). After sonic Hedgehog (250ng/ml), (R&amp;D Systems) and/or<br>
compound treatment, the cells were lysed in 1 lOul of lysis buffer (50mM Tris pH 7.4, 0.1%<br>
TritonXlOO), plates were sonicated and lysates spun through 0.2um PVDF plates (Corning). 40<br>
ul of lysates was assayed for AP activity in alkaline buffer solution (Sigma) containing lmg/ml<br>
p-Nitrophenyl Phosphate. After incubating for 30 min at 37C, the plates were read on an<br>
Envision plate reader at 405 nm. Total protein was quantified with a BCA protein assay kit from<br>
Pierce according to manufacturer's instructions. AP activity was normalized against total<br><br>
protein. Note that "A" indicates that the IC50 is less than 200 nM, "B" indicates that the IC50 is<br>
200-500 nM, "C" indicates that the IC50 is &gt; 500 nM.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
CYCLOPAMINE ANALOGUES<br>
The present invention discloses compositions and methods for modulating smoothened dependent<br>
pathway activation. The present invention also discloses analogs of cyclopamine that can be used to<br>
counteract the phenotypic effects of unwanted activation of a hedgehog pathway, such as resulting<br>
from hedgehog gain-of-function, Ptc loss-of-function or smoothened gain-of-function mutations. The<br>
compounds of the present invention are particularly useful in treating cancers.</td>
