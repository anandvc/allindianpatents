Novel 8a- and 9a-15-membcred Lactams<br>
Technical Field of the Invention<br>
A6 IK 31/70, C07H 17/08<br>
Technical Problem<br>
The invention relates to novel 15-membered 8a- and 9a-Iactams from the class of the macrolide antibiotic 6-0-methyl-er&gt;ihromycin A. t6\ intermediates for their preparation, to a process for their preparation, to their pham^aceutically acceptable addition salts with inorganic and organic acids, to their hydrates\p a process for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions as well as to the use of pharmaceutical compositions for treatment of bacterial infections.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Erythromycin A is a macrolide antibiotic, whose structure is characterized by a 14-membered lactone ring with C-9 ketone and two sugars, L-cladinose and D-desosamine, glycosidically bound in C-3 and C-5 positions onto an aglycone moiety of the molecule (McGuire, Antibiot. Chemother. 1952; 2:281). By an oximation of C-9 ketone with hydroxylamine hydrochloride, by Beckmann rearrangement of the obtained 9{£)-oxime and by a reduction of the formed 6,9-imino ether there is obtained 9-deoxo-9a-aza-9a-homoer&gt;thromycin A, the first semisynthetic macrolide with a 15-membered azalactone ring (Kobrehel G. et al., US 4,328,334, 5/1982). By means of a reductive melhylation of 9a-amino group, azithromycin, a protot&gt;'pe of a novel class of 9a-azaUde antibiotics was synthesized (Kobrehel G. et al., BE 892 357, 7/1982). [n addition to having a broad antimicrobial spectrum including also Gram-negative bacteria, azithromycin is also characterized by a long biological half-life, a specific transport mechanism to the site of use and a short therapy time. Azithromycin easily penetrates and accumulates inside human fagocyte cells resulting in improved activity on intracellular pathogenic microorganisms from classes Legionella, Chlamydia and Helicobacter.<br><br>
It Is known as well that by a 0-methyIation of C-6 hydroxyl group clarithromycin (6-(?-methyl-erhytromycin A) is obtained (Morimoto S. et al.. J. Antibiotics 1984. 37. 187). In relation to erythrom\cin A. clarithromycin is much more stable in acidic medium and exhibits improved in vitro activity against Gram-positi\e bacterial strains (Kirst H. A. et al., Antimicrobial Agents and Chemother., 1989, 1419).<br>
By recent research on 14-membered macrolides. a novel type of macrolide antibiotics, ketoUdes, has been discovered, whose structure is characterized by a 3-keto group instead of a neutral sugar, L-cladinose (Agouridas C. el al., EP 596802 Al 5/1994; Le Martret O., FR 2697524 Al 5/94). Ketolides exhibit significantly improved in vitro activity against MLS (macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin B) induced-resistant organisms{JamjianC.,Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 1997, 41. 485).<br>
It has been described as well that by Beckmann rearrangement of 6-0-methyl-erythromycin A 9(E)- and 9(Z)-oximes, hydrolysis of cladinose of the obtained 8a- and 9a-lactams, protection of 2'-hydroxyI group of desosamine, an acylation reaction, an oxidation of 3-hydroxyl group and by deprotection, there are obtained 15-membered 8a- and 9a- ketoHdes from the class of 6-(3-methyi-erythromycin A (Lazarevski G. et al., PCT/HR 99/00004,4/99).<br>
According to known and established prior art, novel 15-membered 8a- and 9a-iactams from the class of 6-0-methyl-er}'thromycin A, which are the object of the present invention, their pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts with organic or inorganic acids, their hydrates, methods and intermediates for their preparation and methods for their preparation and use as pharmaceutical preparations have hitherto not been described. The object of this invention is preparation of 11,12-substituted derivatives of 6-0-methyl-erythromycin A 8a- and 9a-lactams and their 3-hydroxy and 3-keto derivatives. A further object of the present invention are 3-acyl derivatives of 6-0-methyl-erythronnycin A 8a- and 9a-lactams and 3-acyl-derivatives of n,12-substituted 6-O-methyl-erythromycin A 8a- and 9a-Iactaras. Novel 15-membered 8a- and 9a-<br><br>
