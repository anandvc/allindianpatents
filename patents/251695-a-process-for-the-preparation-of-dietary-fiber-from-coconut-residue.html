				<td>Field of invention:<br>
The present invention relates to the process for the preparation of dietary fiber from<br>
coconut residue.<br>
The present invention particularly relates to preparation of the dietary fiber having fat<br>
content less than 2% and particle size 500 µm and having a long shelf life from coconut<br>
residue.<br>
Background and prior art of the invention;<br>
Dietary fiber refers to the plant substances including plant cell wall (cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin and lignin) as well as intracellular polysaccharides such as gums and mucilage that are not digested by human digestive enzymes. The main components of dietary fiber are cellulose, hemicellulose, starch, pectin substance (polygalacturonic acid components) and lignin. Amongst these, only cellulose and a portion of retrograded starch (called resistant starch) are insoluble in water, while the others are soluble. The non-starch polysaccharides act as bulking agent or roughage in the food. Dietary fiber is considered as a physiologically inert material although the bulking and laxative properties of many fiber sources have long been appreciated. It has been shown to play an important role in the prevention of the risk of carcinogenesis, atherosclerosis and in the control and proper management of diabetes mellitus. Adequate amount of dietary fiber in food is good for the proper bowel moments. Consumption of cereal-based dietary fiber has been promoted for its prophylactic value in regulating colonic function. Incorporation of dietary fiber in our food also serves nutritional, technological as well as physiological purposes. Insoluble fibers in biscuits, cooked meat products, confectioner}7, drinks, sauces, desserts and yogurt act as bulking agent and reduce the calorie content. Fibers are added to cooked meat products to increase the cooking yield owing to then-water and fat retention properties. In fried food products, addition of fiber reduces lipid retention and increases moisture content. A wide range of dietary fibers is available in the market. Dietary fibers from different sources differ in chemical composition and physico-chemical properties and they have been extensively studied for their ability to regulate transit time due to increased stool bulk and other beneficial properties such as hydration properties like swelling capacity, water holding and water retention capacities. Hydration<br><br>
properties of dietary fibers determine their optimal usage levels in food because a<br>
desirable texture must be retained.<br>
Practically no reports are available in literature regarding the utilization of coconut fiber<br>
as dietary fiber, except the one by [Trinidad TP, Valdez D, Mallillin AC, Askali FC,<br>
Maglaya AS, Chua MT, Castillo JC, Loyola AS, Masa DB (2001) Indian Coconut<br>
Journal   7: 45-50]. This study emphasizes the physico-chemical and some nutritional<br>
properties of coconut fiber, without giving any details about the isolation of dietary fiber<br>
from coconut residue.<br>
There are no other reports on utilization of coconut residue as a source of dietary fiber.<br>
However to draw analogy, references are made in the following sections about the dietary<br>
fibres produced from other sources (Table 1).<br>
Reference can be made to US Patent 5,747,093 and 5,919,513 wherein, artificial<br>
sweetener-free   dietary   fiber   has   been   reported   containing   variable   content   of<br>
methylcellulose (2 to 95%), natural coconut (5 to 40%), non-sucrose containing inactive<br>
materials (0 to 93%) and /or banana (5-75%). In this study, coconut was used as a<br>
component of dietary fiber formulations.<br>
Reference can be made to US Patent 3,876,811 wherein, ready-to-eat cereal of natural<br>
ingredients consisting essentially of a base and a coating thereon. Coconut was used as<br>
one of the base material along with cereal flakes, milk solids and edible nuts. And the<br>
coating comprised of brown sugar, non-hydrogenated vegetable oil and sugar. Coconut<br>
was only used as component of base material.<br>
Reference can be made to US Patent 4,766,004 wherein, whole psyllium husks was converted to dietary fiber by the addition of vegetable fat, a sweetening agent and flavouring agent.<br>
Reference can be made to US Patent 6,528,106 and 6,254,913 wherein, Indian mulberry (Morinda citrifolia) plant was used for dietary fiber preparation by washing and separating Indian mulberry pulp from juice by filtration. The pulp was pasteurised and dried. A high fiber product can be prepared by mixing the pulp with ingredients, such as supplemental dietary fiber, water, sweeteners, flavoring agents, coloring agents, and nutritional ingredients.<br><br>
Reference can be made to US Patent 5,350,593 wherein, dietary fiber are derived from the tapioca pulp fiber that is a by-product of tapioca starch milling operations. The tapioca fiber was refined through an enzymatic removal of starch and bleaching. Reference can be made to US Patent 4,948,600 wherein, process for producing a natural cocoa dietary fiber enriched material has been reported by utilizing cocoa powder as starting material. The dietary fiber-rich cocoa material is obtained by enzymatic removal of starch, followed by washing, separating and drying steps. The resulting cocoa material rich in dietary fiber is suitable for producing dietary fiber enriched products. Reference can be made to US Patent RE32, 811 wherein, method for the preparation of dietary fiber readily dispersible in liquids, such as water, is reported. The process comprised of blending of dietary fiber product with the mixture of a non-toxic solvent in a food grade emulsifier followed by removing the solvent.<br>
Reference can be made to US Patent 4,844,924 wherein, the method of preparation of dietary fiber based on corn bran with improved color stability was discussed. The esterification of corn bran prior to bleaching results in a lighter colored dietary fiber product with enhanced sensory acceptance.<br>
Reference can be made to US Patent 4,619,831 and 4,565,702 wherein, a dietary fiber was prepared by coating an insoluble fiber with a soluble fiber. The insoluble fiber was enzymatically and chemically purifying cereal bran and the soluble fiber was pectin or an alginate. The dietary fiber composition can be used to prepare low calorie, high fiber content dietary food products.<br>
Reference can be made to US Patent 5,082,673 and 4,996,063 wherein, soluble dietary fiber and containing maltodextrin can be prepared by hydrolyzing cereal flour or a blend of cereal flour and starch or oat milled products with a-amylase. The recovered material comprises P-glucans and/or pentosans as the dietary fiber. These compositions are colourless and devoid of inherent undesirable flavours and are suitable for use in a variety of foods.<br><br>

and a process for the preparation of dietary fiber from coconut residue comprising the steps of:<br>
g) removing fat content from partially defatted coconut fibers using solvent<br>
extraction from -20% to 2 to 5% in a percolator type solvent extractor<br>
using fiber to solvent ratio of 1:3 to 1:8 w/v; h) drying residue in tray drier at about 70°C for 4 h in order to remove the<br>
residual solvent (hexane); i)   grinding in a hammer mill fitted with a suitable sieve, so as to get the<br>
material in the particle size from 400 to 700µm; j)   sieving to obtain a product of uniform particle size of 500-600 µm and<br>
then packed in polyethylene pouches;<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the reduction of fat content was from<br>
-20% to 2%.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the fibre to solvent ratio was kept<br>
preferably to about 1:5.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the grinding of the dried material<br>
is in the range from 500 to 600µm.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention ground product was sieved to a<br>
particle size of about 550 µm<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the moisture content was about 1.5-2%.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the fat content was about 1.5-2%.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the water holding capacity, water binding capacity and swelling capacity of the dietary fiber produced are 6.5-7.5g/g, 6.5-7.5 g/g and 19-20 ml/g, respectively.<br><br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the soluble dietary fiber, insoluble dietary fiber and total dietary fiber content of the dietary fiber produced are 4-5%, 55-60% and 60-65%, respectively.<br>
The present invention leads to the development of process for the production of dietary fiber from coconut residue. The following steps are involved in the process.<br>
1.	Solvent Extraction: The partially defatted coconut fibers were subjected to solvent extraction for removal of the fat content from -20% to less than 2% in a percolator type solvent extractor using fiber to solvent ratio of 1:3 to 1:8 (w/v). During solvent extraction the fat content of the product should be reduced to less than 2% and product has to be dried completely. The presence of higher content of fat and moisture result in inadequate grinding, which reduces water as well as fat absorption properties.<br>
2.	Removal of solvent: After solvent extraction, residue is to be subjected to drying (tray drier) at about 70°C for removal of the solvent (hexane) (in the range 2 to 5%) for 4 h.<br>
3.	Grinding of fat free desiccated coconut residue: Coconut fiber, thus obtained, after removal of solvent were ground in a hammer mill fitted with a suitable grid, so as to get the material in the particle size from 500-600 µm. The grinding has to be done in such a way that the resultant product size must be -550 µm. A very fine or very coarse product will lead to decrease in water as well as fat absorption properties.<br>
4.	Size separation: The ground product was then passed through a sieving unit to obtain a product of uniform particle size of 550 µm and then it is packed in polyethylene pouches. Further sieving ensures the desired particle size. The effective surface is for adsorption and porosity was optimized through the effective grinding to enhance the hydration properties.<br>
The flowchart for the production dietary fiber from coconut residue along with the integrated coconut processing is given in Figure 1.<br><br>
The solvent extraction of the product to reduce the fat content below 2% and grinding of the solvent extracted and completely dried fibre are the critical steps, which enabled the dietary fibre from coconut residue to have residual fat content and particle size 500 urn with a long shelf life. The characteristics of the dietary fibre from coconut residue are given in Table 1.<br>

b.	Insoluble dietary fiber	55.0-60.0%<br>
C.    Total dietary fiber	60.0-65.0%<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Ten kg of partially defatted coconut fibers (coconut residue) was subjected to solvent extraction for removal of the fat content from -20% to less than 2% in a percolator type solvent extractor. The ratio of fiber to solvent (hexane) was kept 1:8. After solvent extraction, the residue was subjected to drying (tray drier) at about 70°C for removal of the solvent for 4 h. Coconut fibers, thus obtained, after removal of solvent were ground in a hammer mill fitted with a suitable grid, so as to get the material in the particle size from 500-600 µm. The ground product was then passed through a<br><br>
sieving unit to obtain a product of uniform particle size of 550 µm and then packed in polyethylene pouches.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Twenty fresh coconuts were shelled, pared and disintegrated and yielded 4.80 kg fresh coconut grating. The coconut gratings, thus obtained, were subjected to a screw press to obtain coconut milk (3.12 kg) and coconut residue (1.5 kg). One and a half kg of partially defatted coconut fibers (coconut residue) was dried and subjected to solvent extraction for removal of the fat content from ~20% to less than 2% in a percolator type solvent extractor. The ratio of fiber to solvent (hexane) was kept 1:5. After solvent extraction, the residue was subjected to drying (tray drier) at about 70°C for removal of the solvent for 4 h. Coconut fibers, thus obtained, after removal of solvent were ground in a hammer mill fitted with a suitable grid, so as to get the material in the particle size from 500-600 µm. The ground product was then passed through a sieving unit to obtain a product of uniform particle size of 550 µm and then packed in polyethylene pouches.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Eight kg of desiccated coconut fiber was subjected to solvent extraction for removal of the fat content from -65% (dry basis) to less than 2% in a percolator type solvent extractor. The ratio of fiber to solvent (hexane) was kept 1:8. After solvent extraction, the residue was subjected to drying (tray drier) at about 70°C for removal of the solvent for 4 h. Coconut fibers, thus obtained, after removal of solvent were ground in a hammer mill fitted with a suitable grid, so as to get the material in the particle size from 500-600 µm. The ground product was then passed through a sieving unit to obtain a product of uniform particle size of 550 µm and then packed in polyethylene pouches.
