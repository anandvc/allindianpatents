DRAWBACKS OF EXISTING MIC ENGINE TECHNOLOGY<br>
Existing MIC Engines use linear crankshaft having multiple crankpins. These crankshafts are oriented along a straight line. Use of such linear crankshafts in MIC engines, have following disadvantages as inherent part of MIC engines.<br>
a)	Volume and weight of linear crankshaft is more. It's weight forms major portion of weight of MIC engines because, linear crankshaft is long, its diameter is considerable and it consists of many balance weights.<br>
b)	Linear crankshaft is made of alloy steel forgings. Steel used for manufacturing forgings is expensive.<br>
c)	Manufacturing crankshaft is highly precise operation. It requires set of costly machine tools, precision toolings, sophisticated gages and skilled manpower.<br>
All these factors make existing MIC engines heavier and costly. These engines also consume more raw material and space.<br><br>

The present invention embodies use of a single crankpin crankshaft for MIC Engines, such MIC Engines using single crankpin crankshaft are hereinafter referred to as SCMIC engine /s. The conventional MIC Engines in existence have their cylinder bores machined along a straight line in linear crankcase. The shape of crankcase under the present invention is "somewhat prismatic with cylinder like central portion" and Cylinder bores machined on periphery of such crankcase.<br>
In some versions of SCMIC engines under invention only segment of "prismatic shape crankcase with cylinder like central portion" is  used.<br>
The present invention uses a non-linear single crankpin crankshaft for an internal combustion engine having multiple cylinders. This eliminates use of linear crankshaft, consequently disadvantages of linear crankshaft are nullified.<br>

c)	Multi camshaft system for operating engine valves. In this system number of camshafts depend on total number of cylinder bores in same engine. Each camshaft services either one or two cylinder bores and its valves. (Ref. Fig. 6 &amp; 7).<br><br>
4<br>
d)	Cam ring set and lifter rocker system for operating engine valves. In this system, there is one cam ring set and multiple lifter rocker sets. Each lifter rocker set servicing one cylinder bore and its valves. Both these systems are part of present invention. (Ref. Fig. 8,9, 10 &amp; 11)<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
Now the invention is described with reference to the drawings referred above. A typical existing MIC engine has six cylinder bores (as shown in Fig 1 machined in crank case (6) along straight line (1) and uses crank shaft (2) with integral       multiple crankpins. One crank pin (3) is positioned below each cylinder Thus, crankshaft becomes linear and crankshaft forms longest part of MIC   engines.<br>
The SCMIC engine under invention uses a single crankpin crankshaft making the SCMIC engine compact.<br>
An SCMIC engine with prismatic cylinder like core crankcase and cylinder bore locations in vertical plane is schematically shown in Fig. 2 &amp; 3. Fig. 2 is elevation view and Fig. 3 is sectional view. Fig. 2 shows SCMIC engine with four cylinders.<br><br>
The crankcase (1) is square prismatic with cylinder like core and it has four cylinders. This crankcase (1) has cylinder bores (2) machined on it's periphery in one vertical plane, shown by line (11). This plane is perpendicular to crankshaft axis. Cylinder bores are machined at fixed angular pitches. This angular pitch can very or can be same from Cylinder to Cylinder as per requirement. Center lines of all cylinder bores converge at point (12) on<br><br>
7<br>
Crankshaft axis. Cylinder tops (13) of all cylinders are equidistant from point (12). Pistons (3) are fitted in cylinder bores (2). Connecting rods (4) are fitted to pistons (3) by piston pins (5) Crankpin bores of all connecting rods (4) are fitted on crankpin hub (7), in their respective separate positions by hub pins (6). Crankpin hub (7) is fitted on single crankpin (8) of one crankpin crankshaft (9). Crankshaft (9) is assembled in journals (10) of crankcase (1)<br>
When crankshaft is rotated by cranking it, such as by starter, crankpin hub rotates with it. Crankpin hub rotation operates pistons to move rectilinearly in cylinder bores. Consequently SCMIC engine gets fired, starts and runs In another embodiment, SCMIC engine embodies a segmented crank case of prismatic shape with cylinder like core is shown in Fig. 4 and 5. Fig. 4 is elevation view and Fig. 5 is plan view of schematic drawing. This "Segment of hexagonal prismatic with cylinder like core" shape crankcase (1) has four cylinders. Cylinder bores (2) are machined on periphery of crankcase (1) along curvicular line. Characteristics of curvicular line are defined by axial pitch (10) and angular pitch (9). This angular pitch and axial pitch can be varied or can be same from Cylinder to Cylinder. Centerlines of all cylinder bores pass through a straight line. This straight line is equidistant from tops of all cylinders (16).(Points of intersection of this straight line and centerlines of cylinder bores are shown by (12, 13, 14 &amp; 15). Distance (12 - 13) (13-14) and (14-15) are each equal to axial pitch (10). This straight line being equidistant from all cylinder tops, forms axis of crankshaft (8)(Pistons (3), piston pins (5), connecting rods (4) are assembled in cylinder bores (2)) Crankpin diameters of all connecting rods (4) are fitted on single crankpin (6) of one crankpin crankshaft (8)(Crankshaft (8) is further assembled in journals (7) of crankcase (1).<br>
When crankshaft is rotated by cranking it, by starter, pistons   move in cylinder bores in rectilinear motion to fire and run SCMIC engine.<br><br>
8<br>
The cylinder valves may be operated by two systems. Working of multi camshaft system to operate engine valves of SCMIC engine is shown schematically in Fig. 6 &amp; 7. Fig. 6 is elevation view and Fig. 7 is end view of the system. This system has crank-gear (2) integral with crankshaft (10). Crank-gear (2) drives two different idler gears (3). Idler gears (3) are fitted on idler shafts (7). Idler gears (3) further drive camshafts gears (4). Camshafts gears (4) are located on camshafts (5). Camshafts (5), idler shafts (7) and crankshafts (10) are located in respective locations (6,8 &amp; 9) in crankcase (1). Design of this gear train is such that proper speed of rotation is given to camshafts (5). Camshafts further operate lifters, pushrods, engine rocker arms and engine valves.<br>
In another embodiment, cam ring set and lifter rocker system is used to operate engine valves, is shown in Fig. 8 and 9. Fig. 8 is elevation view and Fig. 9 is end view of schematic drawing of this system. This system has crank gear (2) integral with crankshaft (15). Crank gear (2) drives idler gear (4). Idler gear 4 is fitted on idler shaft (5) along with other idler gear (3). This way drive given to idler gear (4) is imparted to idler gear (3). Idler gear (3) further drives camring gear (6). Camring gear (6) is located on camring spigot (8). Camring spigot (8) is located on camring spigot housing (7). Camring spigot housing (7) is fitted to crankcase (1), and allows free rotation of camring spigot (8). Camring set (9) is also mounted on camring spigot (8) and rotates with camring gear (6) at same speed. Idler shaft (5) and crankshaft (15) are mounted in respective bores in crankcase (1). Gear train in this system is designed to give required speed to camring set (9) to operate engine valves. When camring set (9) rotates it gives movement to lifters (10). Lifters (10) are guided in guide holes in rocker block (11). This rocker block (11) is fitted to crankcase (1). Lifters (10) movement operates lifter rocker arms (12). Lifter rocker arms (12) further operate pushrod rocker arms (13). Lifter rocker arms (12) and push rod rocker arms (13) are<br><br>
9<br>
fitted on rocker block (11) and they are free to swivel about their respective axis. Movements of push rod rocker arms (13) is given to push rods (14), engine rocker arms and finally to engine valves.<br>
Camring set being an important part of this system is shown separately in Fig. 10 &amp; 11. Fig. 10 is elevation view and Fig. 11 is end view. There are several suitable grooves (2) in main body of camring set (1). Cam-rings are fitted in these grooves by screws. Holes (3) are provided in main body of camring set (1), for these screws for location. All cam-rings for all cylinders when fitted in all grooves of main body (1), a cam ring set is formed. This set rotates with camring gear at required speed as explained earlier.<br>
