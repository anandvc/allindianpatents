				<td>Field of invention<br>
This invention in general relates to the field of medical technology. Further, this invention relates to a novel custom-built endoprosthesis namely the Distal Tibial prosthesis with ankle joint. Principally, this invention relates to custom-built endoprosthesis - Distal Tibial prosthesis that allows normal functioning of the ankle as it provides a near normal ankle joint.<br>
Introduction<br>
Management of patients with musculoskeletal neoplasms has always been one of the most challenging areas in oncology. Prior to 1970, almost every patient with a primary malignant tumour of musculoskeletal system would have any surgical treatment. They would not have adjuvant chemotherapy or irradiation and surgical treatment was almost an amputation with a five-year survival rate of 20%. For benign lesions such as Giant Cell Tumours, the treatment was curettage with 40-60% recurrence rate. Patients with painful metastatic lesions underwent palliative management until they were mercifully relieved by death.<br>
Prior Art Technique and Practice<br>
The conventional treatment for bone tumours over the years has been amputation, which is surgical removal of the affected part of the body. Amputation led to severe disability and psychological problems. The patient was made to lose not only part of the physical human body, but also a part of the personality of the patient. By the advent of limb salvage, the technique of removing the tumour only and saving the limb of the patient was developed. The aim of limb salvage in bone tumour management is to eradicate the disease, retain the integrity of the skeletal system and preserve the limb with useful functions using metallic prosthesis.<br>
The early methods of reconstruction after limb salvage used the patient's own bone from another part of the body, but were associated with severe disability due to the lack of knee motion.<br><br>
The technique of endoprosthetic replacement revolutionized limb salvage by providing a method of reconstruction that provides stability and mobility. The endoprostheses that is used after excision of bone tumours around the ankle joint differs from other joint replacement prosthesis because of the complex anatomy at this site due to the ankle and subtalar joints. The prosthesis is fabricated according to the anatomical dimensions of the patient and is therefore termed as the Custom Prosthesis.<br>
The custom prosthesis was designed by us to meet the anatomical and functional demands after excision of bone tumours. Different types of Custom Prosthesis have been developed by us to replace bone defects after limb salvage surgery for bone tumours of the distal tibia (ankle), elbow, distal radius, distal femur (thigh bone) and proximal tibia (leg bone).<br>
Our patent application No:897/MAS/2001, which has already been submitted, is a Proximal Tibial Prosthesis with a Pivotal Hinge Mechanism. Our patent application No:1002/MAS/2002, which has already been submitted, is a Proximal Tibial Prosthesis with a Bearing Polymer Pad Mechanism. Our patent application No: 898/MAS/2001, which has also been submitted, is a Distal Femoral Prosthesis with Pivotal Hinge Mechanism. Our patent application No: 707/CHE/2003, which has already been submitted, is a Distal Femoral Prosthesis With Thrust Bearing Polymer Pad And Rotating Axis Mechanism. Even though all these patent applications are for prostheses around the knee joint, the anatomical part replaced by patent application Nos: 897/MAS/2002 and 1002/MAS/2002 is the upper part of the leg bone (Proximal Tibia), whereas the patent application No: 898/MAS/2001, and patent application No: 707/CHE/2003 replace the lower part of the thigh bone (Distal Femur). Our other copending application that has been filed in patent application No. 1023/CHE/2003, for the Distal Radius Prosthesis with Wrist Joint.<br>
The current application patent No: 1067/CHE/2003 is the distal tibial prosthesis with ankle joint, which replaces the distal tibial and the ankle joint.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
The Distal Tibial Prosthesis with ankle joint is a cemented fixation device, cemented at its both ends. The special feature of this prosthesis is that it has a rolling hinge apparatus at its lower end, which simulates movements of the ankle joint in one plane, i.e., in a plane perpendicular to the coronal plane - Dorsiflexion and plantarflexion - upward and downward movement of the foot. All the components are made of surgical stainless steel of AISI - Grade 316 L or titanium of ASTM - B 348, Grade 5, except the collared bushes and the cushioning bearing pad, which are made<br><br>
of Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene provided to evade metal-to-metal friction.<br>
The Distal tibial prosthesis mainly comprises of the following components: the tibial stem assembly that consists of a proximal segment (1 in figure) with an anchoring stem (la in figure 2) at its superior aspect, the lower segment of the distal segment (3 in figure 1,3 &amp; 4) tibial component, connected to the upper segment by means of three fixing screws (2 in figure 1 &amp; 3). The expanded malleolar portion (3d in figure 2) of the distal segment houses the rolling hinge mechanism in its inferior aspect.<br>
The proximal segment has a straight anchoring stem at its superior aspect that has a matted surface and three longitudinal troughs on its outer surface. This helps to fix the prosthesis firmly with bone cement to the remaining proximal tibial portion.<br>
The lower portion of the proximal segment forms the medial aspect of the tibial stem. The upper part of the distal segment forms the lateral aspect of the tibial stem. The inner surfaces le (in figure 2) of the proximal component and 3i (in figure 2) of the distal segment lie in close opposition when assembled. To prevent rotation of the two said components, they lock themselves (Refer figure 2) superiorly - the knob 3a of the distal segment into the pit lb of the proximal segment, inferiorly the knob Id of the proximal segment into the pit 3c of the distal segment. This locking as a result, finds the surfaces If of the proximal segment oppose with 3n of the superior aspect of the distal segment. Similarly, the surface Ig of the inferior aspect of the proximal segment lies against 3m of the distal segment. All the aforesaid surfaces (If, 3n, Ig &amp; 3m in figure 2) are planar.<br>
The two segments, proximal and distal, when assembled, are secured to each other by three fixing screws and washers (2 in figure 2 &amp; 10), which are driven from a lateral to medial direction into the holes 3b of the distal segment and Ic of the proximal segment. The screws are so designed to contain their heads (figure 3) within the tibial stem. The outer circumference 2a (in figure 2) lies against the inner circumference 3j (figure 2) of the bores of the distal segment. The threaded portions of the fixing screws limit themselves within the inner medial surface of the proximal<br><br>
segment (figure 4). The washers (10 in figure 2) made of stainless steel or titanium present adjacent to the head and the threaded portion of the screws, limits further propagation of the fixing screws beyond the inner (medial) surface of the tibial stem.<br>
The lower portion (3d in figure 2 &amp;5) of the distal segment of the tibial stem is expanded in the medio-lateral and antero-posterior directions to simulate the normal anatomy at that level. The distal most ends of the lateral aspect of this portion extend beyond the inferior surface (3p in figure 4) of the distal segment to form a clevis type of configuration to accommodate the rolling hinge mechanism. The lower aspect of the inner walls (3e in figure 5) is formed by two cross-holes (3f in figure 5) that take in the pivot pin (5 in figures 1,2 &amp; 3). The Pivot pin is locked in its place with the help of two locking setscrews (9 in figure 2) that go into the threaded cross-holes (3h in figure.2 that correspond to the threaded portions of the setscrews) in tip of the sidewalls of the clevis configuration. These two inferior cross-holes (3h) open into the cross-holes (31) of the sidewalls such that the non-threaded tip (9b in figure 5) of the setscrews lock the pivot pin at their corresponding pits (5c in figure 5) on either ends. The outer and inner surfaces (5a in figure 5) has a vertical slit that corresponds in line with the direction of the locking setscrews that fix the pivot pin at the pits.<br>
The inferior surface of the distal segment has a cylindrical disc-shaped pit (3g in figures 4 &amp; 5) whose height (3k in figure 5) corresponds exactly to that of the locking disc part (6a in figure.5) of the cushioning-bearing pad (6 in figure 1,2,3 &amp; 4). The rest of the inferior planar surface (3p in figure 4) of the distal segment lies in contact with the superior planar surface (6d in figure 4) of the cushioning bearing pad. The inferior surface (6c in figure 5) of the cushioning bearing pad is concave so that the anterior and posterior surfaces (6b in figure 5) of the bearing pad are inclined (as seen in figure 4) to the normal.<br>
The inferior concave surface (6c in figure 5) of the cushioning bearing pad has a specific radius that matches the radius of the superior surface (7c in figure 5) of the talar component. The inferior margins of the inclined anterior and posterior surfaces of the cushioning bearing pad (6b in figure 5) stop short at the superior margins of the straight anterior and posterior surfaces (7f in figure 5), in the neutral position, as seen in figure 1.<br><br>
The pivot pin fits snugly (the outer surface 5b in figure 5) into the bores (4c in figures 5) of the collared bushes,whose collars (4b in figure 5) are placed in the channel (7a in figure 5) of the talar component with their outer faces (4a in figure 5) face the exterior.<br>
The talar component has a channel (7a in figure 5) configuration in a reniform or bean-shape (when viewed from the side, as in figures 4 &amp; 5), into which the collars (4b in figure 5) of the two collared bushes are assembled. Hence the inner faces of the two collars (4d in figureS) lie in opposition to the lateral and medial abutting surfaces of the rim (7 1 in figure 5). This makes the collared bushes to traverse through the channel of the talar component limited anteriorly and posteriorly at 7g and 7h respectively as well as at 7k (of figure 5) superiorly. The fit of the collared bushes into the channel is such that the outer surface of the bush (4b in figure 5) that is just adjacent to inner surfaces (4d in figure 5) articulates within the thin perimeter formed by the arching surfaces 7k and 7b (in figure 5) at the outer and inner aspects of the talar component. Due to this arrangement, the talar component gets a rocking motion that results in upward and downward tilting movements of the inferior surface (7e in figure 5), perpendicular to the coronal plane, to simulate the movements of ankle joint.<br>
There are two screwed holes (7i in figure 5) at the bottom flat serrated surface of the talar component, which house the two counter-sunk head screws (8 in figure 5). These screws get embedded into the tarsal bones with the bone cement smeared in the gap between the head (8a in figure 5) and the shaft (8b in figure 5). The serrated inferior planar surface (7e in figure 5) on this area gives sufficient grip for the bone to get anchored to the bone cement.<br>
