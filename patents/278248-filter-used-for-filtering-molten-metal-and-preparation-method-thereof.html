FILTER USED FOR FILTERING MOLTEN METAL AND PREPARATION METHOD THEREOF<br>
JINAN SHENGQUAN DOUBLE SURPLUS CERAMIC FILTER CO., LTD.,<br>
a Chinese Company of Diaozhen Chemical Industrial Development Zone Zhangqiu Jinan,<br>
Shandong 250204 (CN)<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br>
 <br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a field of filter preparation, in particular relates to a filter used for filtering molten metal and a preparation method thereof<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
At present, a lot of literatures regarding filters used for filtering molten metal are available.<br>
US Patent No. 5104540 (Corning Inc.) discloses a carbon-coated porous sintered ceramic filter for filtering molten metal, comprising a single unit filter substrate material formed from refractory material such as alumina, mullite, zircon powder, zirconia, spinel, cordierite, lithium, aluminosilicate, titanate, feldspar, quartz, fumed silica, silicon carbide, kaolin, aluminum titanate, silicate, aluminate and mixtures thereof. A carbon-based coating is applied to the surface of the filter screen or used as a thermite.<br>
US 5520823 discloses a filter only for filtering molten aluminum, wherein borosilicate glass is employed as the binder. Although the filter contains graphite, considerable amount of graphite is lost due to sintering in the air. The loss of carbon limits this filter to be used in filtering aluminum metal only while is not suitable for filtration of molten iron or steel.<br>
WO 0218075 discloses a filter for filtering molten metal, wherein the filter comprises open cell porous material containing refractory particles bonded together by a binder containing carbon structure. That is to say, in this filter, no other bonding mechanism except for carbon binder exists.<br>
In the present filters, the high temperature resistance of the filter is enhanced by the employment of carbon binder, while the content thereof needs to be controlled within a narrow range, which is not favourable for controlling the<br>
 <br>
cotents of the binder during the processing. Furthermore, although carbon containing refractory materials can withstand temperature higher than that of the molten metal, prevent metal penetration, exhibit very high strength at high temperature and show better thermal shock resistance; unfortunately, the filter bonded by carbon binder has very low strength at room temperature, at the same time, it tends to absorb moisture, thus influencing the use of this product under high temperature.<br>

The result shows that the filter withstood the testing condition and performed as required in filtering the molten steel. According to the tests carried out on the casts after filtration, the tensile strength, the elongation rate and the structure of the casts all showed significant improvements compared with the casts before filtration: the tensile strength was increased 4.0-7:5%; the elongation rate was increased 9.5-15.0%; the metallographic structure was improved a lot, both being ferrite and pearlite before and after filtration, while the ferrite becomes finer after filtration, which is beneficial for performance improvement. Scanning electron microscope analysis of the fracture of the casts before and after filtration indicates that there is sulfide inclusion at the fracture of the unfiltered cast while no inclusion exists at the fracture of the cast after filtration by the filter of the invention.<br>
