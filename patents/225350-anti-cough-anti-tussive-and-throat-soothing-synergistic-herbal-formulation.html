				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to development of an anticough, antitussive and throat soothing herbal formulation(s).<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART OF THE INVENTION<br>
Anti-tussives are substances that specifically inhibit or suppress the act of coughing. Such inhibition may be due to (1) depression of medullary center or associated higher centers (2) increased threshold of periphery reflexogenous zones (3) interruption of tussal impulses in the afferent limb of cough reflex (4) inhibition of conduction along the motor pathways and (5) removal of irritants by facilitating bronchial drainage and mucociliary activity.<br>
Wide arrays of antitussive combinations are commercially available. The combinations can consist of two to four active ingredients and include any combination of an antitussive plus sympathomimetics, antihistamines, expectorants and/ or analgesics. These cough products are very controversial and rarely offer an advantage.<br>
The over-the-counter (OTC) market has offered products for throat soothing for many years. Majorities of these products utilize phenol as their active ingredient. Phenol is the simple alcohol derivative of benzene. Both of these chemicals are listed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as extremely carcinogenic.<br>
Histamine is an endogenous mediator and plays an important role in bronchoconstriction. Mainly it acts through different receptors in the bronchial muscle. The histamine is stored in the mast cells during stress or abnormal physiological function, the mast cell degranulates and the histamine is released. The mediator histamine is playing a key role in the cough and throat infections.<br>
A natural non-carcinogenic formulation for treatment of cough, soothing of throat is an alternative of phenol especially for the speakers, who need to speak for a longer duration of time, to prevent the breakdown of voice and dryness of the mouth. Hitherto, an herbal formulation is the need of the hour having throat soothing activity along with prevention of dryness of mouth and breaking of voice. Only on oral tradition prevalent in certain group of South Indian Brahmin (Aiyangar) particularly<br><br>
those families who participate in vedic recital for days together, (one of the authors of this patent is from one<br>
such family) we have proposed an entirely novel formulation(s). These people use Piper cubeba for clearing throats and to maintain a healthy and sound vocal system, while they recite veda continuously for over a week. Based on this lead we propose a novel formulation(s) in a combination with a better dosage form and activity.<br>
As a result of intensive study conducted by the inventors, with the aim of achieving aforementioned objectives, new formulations for oral ingestion were developed employing herbal drugs which are from natural origin, incorporating them into binders and diluting agents to form oral dosage forms.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary objective of the invention is to prepare a novel anti-tussive and throat soothing herbal formulation(s), which prevents dryness of mouth, and cracking of voice by toning the vocal cord.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to prepare a forrnulation(s) that gives immediate relief to throat irritation and also stimulates the release of saliva.<br>
Yet another of the present invention is to prepare herbal formulation with a combination of the plants which are used in bronchitis, asthma, stimulate respiration, bronchodialator, antimicrobial, antitussive along with antiemetic anti-inflammatory, bronchial catarrh properties and also in the treatment of allergic reactions.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention a synergistic herbal composition is provided to prevent dryness of the mouth, cracking of voice, soreness of throat that contains Piper cubeba that has been used by a certain group of people as mentioned in the prior art for the above mentioned purpose as the active ingredient. Along with these plants other traditional plants like Glycyrrhiza glabra, Acorus calamus, Alpinia galanga and Zingiber officinale are added which are used in bronchitis, asthma, to stimulate respiration, antimicrobial, antitussive and also in the treatment of allergy.<br>

The material is then powdered into a fine powder. A specified amount of the powdered material is then extracted exhaustively with 50 % aqueous alcohol at room temperature (25-35 °C). Extraction was carried out in a closed container immersing specified amount of the plant material in specified solvent (1:8 - 1:15 ratio) for 4-7 days. At the end of this stage, solvent is decanted and filtered if necessary to make it free from plant debris. The solvent is then concentrated by evaporating under vacuum at less than 40-60 C. The concentrate is then freeze dried to obtain final product in powder form. The final<br><br>
product is then made into oral dosage form by using it as an ingredient for making syrup, lozenges or chewable tablets. Suitable binders like starch and diluents like lactose are added to make up the formulation. Simple syrup as mentioned in Indian Pharmacopoeia is taken for making the syrup formulation.<br>

Rats were prior treated with 1 ml, 2 ml, 4 ml, and 6 ml to different groups and<br>
3 hours after last dose treatment. Rats were sacrified and intestinal mesentry was<br>
taken for study of mast cells. Mesnteries of sacrified rats along with intestinal pieces<br>
were kept in a Ringer's solution at 37°C.	'<br><br>
Pieces of mesentry were stained with Toludiene blue (0.1% for 10 min), then the tissue was then transferred to xylene for 5 - 10 min. and finally rinsed 2 or 3 times with acetone.<br>
The intestinal tissue pieces were out and removed, placed in a slide and stretched with the help of needles. Then, the tissue was examined under the microscope. The numbers of intact and disrupted mast cells per high field (400 x) were counted.<br>
