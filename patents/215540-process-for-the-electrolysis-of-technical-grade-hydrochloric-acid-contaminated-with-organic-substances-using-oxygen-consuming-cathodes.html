				<td>process For The Electrolysis Of Technical-Grade Hydrochloric Acid Contaminated<br>
With Organic Substances Using Oxygen-Consuming Cathodes<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a novel rhodium sulphide catalyst for reduction of oxygen in<br>
industrial electrolysers. The catalyst is highly resistant towards corrosion and poisoning<br>
by organic species, thus resulting particularly suitable for use in aqueous hydrochloric<br>
acid electrolysis, also when technical grade acid containing organic contaminants is<br>
employed.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for the electrolysis of contaminated hydrochloric<br>
acid.<br>
Hydrochloric acid is obtained as a waste product in a number of chemical processes.<br>
This applies in particular to addition reactions using phosgene, such as in<br>
isocyanate chemistry, where the chlorine used issues completely in the form of HCI.<br>
Hydrochloric acid is however also formed in substitution reactions, such as for<br>
example in the production of chlorobenzenes and chlorotoluenes, in which half of the<br>
chlorine used issues in the form of HCI. The third main source of HCI is the thermal<br>
decomposition of chlorine-containing compounds, in which chlorine issues<br>
completely in the form of HCI. If no direct use exists for the gaseous HCI, such as for<br>
example in oxychlorination processes, concentrated hydrochloric acid is formed by<br>
absorption in water or dilute hydrochloric acid. Chemically non-usable quantities<br>
can be very advantageously recycled to form chlorine by means of hydrochloric acid<br>
electrolysis, and in particular by means of hydrochloric acid electrolysis using<br>
oxygen-depolarised cathodes.<br>
STATE OF THE ART<br>
The electrolysis of aqueous HCI solutions is a well known method for the<br>
recovery of high-value chlorine gas. Aqueous hydrochloric acid is an abundant chemical<br>
by-product, especially in chemical plants making use of chlorine as a reactant: in this<br>
case, the chlorine evolved at the anodic compartment of the electrolyser can be recycled<br>
as a feedstock to the chemical plant. Electrolysis becomes extremely attractive when the<br>
standard hydrogen-evolving cathode is substituted with an oxygen-consuming gas<br>
diffusion electrode due to the significant drop in energy consumption. The ability of the<br>
gas diffusion electrode to operate successfully in this context is crucially dependent on<br>
the nature and performance of the catalyst, but also on the structure of the gas diffusion<br>
electrode.<br>
Platinum is generally acknowledged as the most effective catalyst for the<br>
electroreduction of oxygen in a wide range of conditions; the activation of gas diffusion<br>
electrodes with platinum based catalysts is well known in the art, and finds widespread<br>
application in fuel cells and electrolysers of many kinds. However, the case of aqueous<br>
HCI electrolysis poses some serious drawbacks to the use of platinum as cathodic<br>
catalyst, as it is inevitable for the gas diffusion cathode to come at least partially in<br>
contact with the liquid electrolyte, which contains chloride ion and dissolved chlorine.<br>
First of all, platinum is susceptible to chloride ion poisoning which negatively affects its<br>
activity toward oxygen reduction; a second source of poisoning is constituted by<br>
contaminant species, especially organic species, which are in most of the cases<br>
dissolved in the by-product hydrochloric acid undergoing electrolysis. Even more<br>
importantly, the combined complexing action of hydrochloric acid and dissolved chlorine<br>
gas changes the platinum metal into a soluble salt which is dissolved away, making this<br>
material inappropriate for use in gas diffusion electrodes.<br>
Other platinum group metals appear to follow a similar fate. For example,<br>
according to Pourbaix Atlas of Electrochemical Equilibria in Aqueous Solutions, finely<br>
divided rhodium metal dissolves in hot concentrated sulphuric acid, aqua regia, and<br>
oxygenated hydrochloric acid. Similarly, (hydrated) Rh2O3?5H2O dissolves readily in HCI<br>
and other acids. These problems have been partially mitigated with the disclosure of the<br>
rhodium / rhodium oxide based catalyst described in concurrent U.S. Pat. Application<br>
09/013,080. In particular, the rhodium/rhodium oxide system, although slightly less active<br>
than platinum towards oxygen reduction, is not poisoned by chloride ions. Also the<br>
chemical resistance to aqueous hydrochloric acid with small amounts of dissolved<br>
chlorine is sensibly enhanced with respect to platinum. However, an activation step is<br>
needed to obtain a sufficiently active and stable form of this catalyst, and some<br>
limitations arise when such catalyst has to be included in a gas diffusion electrode; for<br>
instance, the chemical and electronic state of the catalyst is changed upon sintering in<br>
air, a very common step in gas diffusion electrode preparations known in the art.<br>
Cumbersome and/or costly operations have to be carried out to replace this step, or to<br>
restore the active and stable form of the catalyst afterwards, as disclosed in U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,598,197. Furthermore, the required chemical stability is displayed only in the<br>
potential range typical of the electrolysis operation; extremely careful precautions have<br>
to be taken during the periodical shut-downs of the electrolysers, otherwise the sudden<br>
shift in the cathodic potential, combined 1o the highly aggressive chemical environment,<br>
causes the dissolution of a significant amount of catalyst, and the partial deactivation of<br>
the remaining portion. While tailored procedures for planned shut-downs of the<br>
electrolysers can be set up, although resulting in additional costs, little or nothing can be<br>
done in case a sudden, uncontrolled shut-down due to unpredictable causes (for<br>
instance, power shortages in the electric network) should occur. There is also no<br>
evidence that rhodium/rhodium oxide based catalysts are more insensitive to<br>
contaminants with respect to platinum based catalysts.<br>
Technical-grade hydrochloric acid of the kind obtained for example in the<br>
above mentioned processes, is usually contaminated with partially chlorinated<br>
organic substances, such as for example monochlorobenzene or ortho-<br>
dichlorobenzene from the processes themselves, as well as possibly with organic<br>
substances from vessel linings, packing materials or pipelines. Such organic<br>
substances are obtained for example in the form of surfactants or acrylic esters. The<br>
total concentration measured in the form of the TOC can in fact greatly exceed 20<br>
ppm. In the electrolysis of hydrochloric acid using oxygen-depolarised cathodes in<br>
initial tests in which platinum was used as the catalyst, the operating voltages were<br>
found to be sensitive to the degree of contamination: over a period of several<br>
weeks, and in some cases only a few days, an increase in the cell voltage by 150 to<br>
300 mV was observed, a phenomenon which was at least partially reversed during<br>
experimental operation using chemically pure hydrochloric acid. Similar results were<br>
obtained after switching off the apparatus although the reduction in voltage did<br>
however disappear again after a few days. The object was to find a process which<br>
avoids this disadvantage of increased operational voltage in the presence of<br>
contaminated hydrochloric acid.<br>
The hydrochloric acid typically recycled in production processes usually<br>
emerges from several feed streams with corresponding fluctuations in the content of<br>
organic or inorganic impurities. Besides the mentioned organic impurities typical<br>
inorganic contaminants are in particular sulphates, phosphates and sulphides. One<br>
attempt to solve this problem was the purification of technical grade hydrochloric<br>
acid using activated carbon. The effect of the reduction in the highly fluctuating<br>
TOC from between 20 and 50 ppm to approx. 10 ppm, accompanied by the reduction<br>
in the content of chlorinated organic substances to 
considerable improvement in the operation of the cell.<br>
Subsequent purification of the concentrated, approx. 30% hydrochloric acid,<br>
with the aid of adsorber resins, allowed a reduction in the content of chlorinated<br>
organic substances to below the detection limit of 6 ppb. It was however also found<br>
that the non-chlorinated organic substances, which did after all make up the main<br>
proportion of impurities, rapidly exhaust the adsorptive capacity of the adsorber resin<br>
at the high impurity contents, so that these organic substances break through the<br>
adsorption column and have a negative effect on the operating voltage of the<br>
electrolysis. The cell voltage increases accordingly. The regeneration of the<br>
adsorber resin with methanol according to the manufacturers" specifications would<br>
be relatively laborious and, given the above contents of impurities, would have to be<br>
carried out every few days. Due to the risk of explosion which must be taken into<br>
account the adsorber resin container would have to be removed and regenerated<br>
externally.<br>
If the hydrochloric acid does however stem from a direct connection to an<br>
isocyanate unit the content of impurities is considerably lower and consists<br>
essentially of the constituents mono- and dichlorobenzene, which can be removed<br>
very successfully by means of activated carbon as well as adsorber resins to levels<br>
below the detection limit, and the regeneration cycles of the adsorber resin packing<br>
extend to several months up to about half a year, depending on the content of<br>
impurities.<br>
Tests with platinum catalysed oxygen-depolarised cathodes all showed a<br>
similar high sensitivity towards organic impurities. In tests using rhodium oxide-<br>
catalysed oxygen-depolarised cathodes the sensitivity towards organic substances<br>
was found to be slightly less, although it was still quite considerable. The rhodium<br>
oxide catalyst had been developed in order to be able to dispense with polarisation<br>
upon switching the apparatus off. This catalyst did however reveal in tests that its<br>
structural stability was not sufficient. Thus the activation of an electrode in which<br>
this catalyst was used decreased by approx. 30% within only a few weeks.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a novel catalyst for oxygen reduction<br>
having desirable and unexpected chemical stability towards highly corrosive media.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a novel catalyst for oxygen<br>
reduction having desirable and unexpected electrocatalytic activity in presence of<br>
organic contaminants.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide novel gas diffusion electrodes with<br>
a novel catalyst therein having desirable and unexpected electrocatalytic properties.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a novel electrolytic cell containing a<br>
gas diffusion electrode of the invention and to provide an improved method of<br>
electrolysing hydrochloric add to chlorine.<br>
These and other objects and advantages of the invention will become obvious<br>
from the following detailed description.<br>
THE INVENTION<br>
A more effective catalyst having the advantages of the chemical stability of<br>
rhodium in the presence of hydrochloric acid is rhodium sulphide. Test electrodes in<br>
which RhSx is used as a catalyst displayed the expected stability after switching off<br>
the electrolysis, without polarisation, and the required resistance to catalyst losses<br>
due to washing out.<br>
It was however surprisingly found that electrodes in which RhSx is used as the<br>
catalyst are almost completely non-sensitive to the broad spectrum of organic and<br>
inorganic impurities. Whereas Pt-catalysed electrodes underwent an increase in<br>
the operational voltage of up to 260 mV within ten days, even when purified<br>
hydrochloric acid was used, and RhOx-catalysed electrodes also underwent an<br>
increase of 100 mV under similar conditions, tests using RhSx-catalysed electrodes<br>
and purified hydrochloric acid revealed only a slight increase of about 20 mV<br>
compared with cells operated with chemically pure hydrochloric acid and only an<br>
increase of about 40 mV compared with the value obtained using purified<br>
hydrochloric acid even when completely non-purified hydrochloric acid was used.<br>
This increase proved to be reversible when purified acid was once again<br>
subsequently used. The difference in the operation of the cell when purified<br>
technical-grade hydrochloric acid was used as opposed to chemically pure<br>
hydrochloric acid has also been demonstrated in additional tests to be between a<br>
non-detectable increase in voltage and a maximum increase of 30 mV in the<br>
operating voltage of a cell operated under typical electrolysis conditions (current<br>
density: 5 kA/m2, operating temperature: 70°C, 13 - 14% HCI).<br>
It is thus by all means advantageous for the technical-grade hydrochloric acid<br>
to be pre-purified via an activated carbon line and possibly in addition via an<br>
adsorber resin bed, in order to avoid even small increases in the operating voltage.<br>
Purification is at any case recommendable, in order to avoid the further reaction of<br>
mono- and dichlorobenzene at the anode to form hexachlorobenzene, since the<br>
latter is deposited|as a solid in the electrolysis unit and the hydrochloric acid loops<br>
and can lead to problems especially in valves and pumps after long periods of<br>
operation.<br>
An additional finding is noteworthy: oxygen depolarised cathodes of the flow-<br>
through type in which the carbon fabric was directly catalysed and which have an<br>
open structure, were able to be operated continuously at up to 5 kA/m2 not only with<br>
. pure oxygen but also with air or depleted oxygen and using organically contaminated<br>
hydrochloric acid. The other type used, in which the catalyst is applied to the carbon<br>
fabric in a form embedded in electrically conductive carbon dust (the single-sided<br>
type) already reached its limits at a content of nitrogen in the oxygen of approx. 30%:<br>
The operating voltage was 300 to 350 mV higher and thus already on the borderline<br>
of effective operation.<br>
The novel electrochemical catalyst of the invention is comprised of rhodium<br>
sulphide, which may be either supported on a conductive inert carrier or unsupported.<br>
This catalyst does not require any activation step prior to its use, and surprisingly retains<br>
all of its electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen reduction in presence of chloride ions<br>
and organic molecules. Moreover, the catalyst is surprisingly not dissolved by the<br>
complexing action of aqueous hydrochloric acid / chlorine mixtures, thereby requiring no<br>
particular precautions during shut-downs when used in hydrochloric acid electrolysers.<br>
The catalyst is preferably coated on at least one side of a web, and may be used alone,<br>
with a binder, blended with a conductive support and a binder, or supported on a<br>
conductive support and combined with a binder. The binder may be hydrophobic or<br>
hydrophilic, and the mixture can be coated on one or both sides of the web. The web<br>
can be woven or non-woven or made of carbon cloth, carbon paper, or any conductive<br>
metal mesh.<br>
Examples of high surface area supports include graphite, various forms of carbon<br>
and other finely divided supports but carbon black is preferred.<br>
Such catalyst coated webs can be employed as gas diffusion cathodes exhibiting<br>
cell voltages, current densities and a lifetime that could not be previously obtained under<br>
normal operating conditions, especially when used in highly aggressive environments<br>
and with low purity reactants, such as the case of electrolysis of by-product hydrochloric<br>
acid.<br>
The catalyst may be easily prepared upon sparging hydrogen sulphide gas in an<br>
aqueous solution of a water soluble rhodium salt. Nitrogen gas may be used as a carrier<br>
for hydrogen sulphide, and a pure nitrogen flow may advantageously be used to purge<br>
excess hydrogen sulphide upon completion of the reaction. The resulting solids are<br>
recovered by filtration, washing and drying to constant weight at 125°C, for example. The<br>
rhodium sulphide obtained in this way is unsupported (unsupported catalyst). However,<br>
when the aqueous solution of the water soluble rhodium salt further contains a<br>
suspension of a suitable conductive support, then the rhodium sulphide is preferentially<br>
deposited as tiny particles on the surface of the conductive particles (supported<br>
catalyst). The resulting hydrated form of rhodium sulphide must be heated in an inert<br>
atmosphere at 550 to 650°C, and preferably above 600°C to form an anhydrous form of<br>
rhodium sulphide catalyst. The heating may be for several hours depending on the size<br>
of the batch, and the choice of the temperature is crucial for the formation of a sufficiently<br>
stable catalyst.<br>
If the temperature is too low such as 300°C, the resulting crystallites are not well-<br>
defined and the catalyst stability is not sufficient. If the temperature is too high, i.e.,<br>
725°C, the unsupported catalyst has excellent acid stability but is not electrically<br>
conductive enough.<br>

In the following examples, there are described several preferred embodiments to<br>
illustrate the invention. However, it is to be understood that the invention is not intended<br>
to be limited to the specific embodiments.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
100 grams of supported rhodium sulphide were prepared by the following procedure:<br>
57.3 grams of RhCI3xH2O (39.88% given as rhodium metal) were dissolved in 2 litres of<br>
de-ionised (D.I.) water, without any pH adjustment. 53.4 grams of Vulcan XC-72 active<br>
carbon were added, and the mixture was slurried with a magnetic stinrer.<br>
Hydrogen sulphide gas was then sparged through the slurry at ambient temperature<br>
using nitrogen as a carrier gas, according to the scheme of Figure 1. The mixture has<br>
been allowed to react as described for 7 hours. Upon completion of the reaction,<br>
nitrogen was purged through the system to remove residual H2S. The remaining<br>
solution was vacuum filtered to isolate the solids, which were then washed with de-<br>
ionised water and dried at 125°C to a constant weight.<br>
The resulting catalyst cake was finally ground to a fine powder and subjected to 650°C<br>
under flolving argon for two hours. A load of catalyst on carbon of 30%, given as rhodium<br>
metal, was obtained.<br>
As already stated before, this final thermal treatment is a crucial step in the preparation<br>
of the desired stable and active metal sulphide. Figure 2 shows the development of a<br>
preparation of rhodium sulphide as outlined above as a function of treatment<br>
temperature. In particular, figure 2 shows the results of a powder sample XRD scan on<br>
a.) the supported catalyst after filtration and drying, b.) the supported catalyst of a.) after<br>
heating to 300°C in argon, and c.) the supported catalyst of b.) after heating to 650°C.<br>
The increase in number and clarity of peaks in these scans indicates the formation of<br>
well-defined crystallites containing rhodium and sulphur. These changes induced in the<br>
XRD spectrograph by the temperature treatment also reflect corresponding substantial<br>
gains in catalyst stability.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
8 grams of unsupported rhodium sulphide were prepared by the following procedure:<br>
12.1 grams of RhCI3 xH2O (39.88% given as rhodium metal) were dissolved in 700 ml of<br>
de-ionised water, without any pH adjustment. Hydrogen sulphide gas was then sparged<br>
through the slurry at ambient temperature using nitrogen as a carrier gas, according to<br>
the scheme of Figure 1. The mixture has been allowed to react as described for 4 hours.<br>
Upon completion of the reaction, nitrogen was purged through the system to remove<br>
residual H2S. The remaining solution was vacuum filtered to isolate the solids, which<br>
were then washed with de-ionised water and dried at 125°C to a constant weight. The<br>
resulting catalyst cake was finally ground to a fine powder and subjected to 650°C under<br>
flowing argon for two hours.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1<br>
A rhodium oxide/rhodium catalyst on Vulcan XC-72 was prepared following the<br>
method disclosed in co-pending U.S. Patent Serial No. 09/013,080 (26 Feb. 98) and<br>
herebelow repeated. 9.43 g of RhCI3?xH2O (39.88% given as rhodium metal) were<br>
dissolved in 2 litres of de-ionised water at room temperature, and the resulting solution<br>
was added to a dispersion of 8.75 g of Vulcan XC-72 in 500 ml of D.I. water. The<br>
mixture was stirred to maintain a uniform carbon slurry while slowly adding (2-3 ml/min) a<br>
0.5 molar solution of ammonium hydroxide. Besides the 220 ml of ammonium hydroxide<br>
theoretically required to form Rh(OH)3, a 20% excess of ammonium hydroxide was<br>
added to set a basic environment. The basic slurry was then stirred at 60-70°C for 30-<br>
60 minutes and filtered hot. The filter cake was washed with about 200 ml D.I. water at<br>
60-70oC and dried in air at 125°C for 15 hours.<br>
The resulting cake was then ground to a fine powder and heated at 650°C under flowing<br>
argon gas to dehydrate and stabilise the catalyst. The load of catalyst on carbon was<br>
30%, given as rhodium metal. The catalyst powder was further subjected to an<br>
activation step by heating at 500°C for 30 minutes under flowing hydrogen gas to further<br>
reduce some of the rhodium oxide to rhodium metal. As emphasised in co-pending U.S.<br>
Patent Serial No. 09/013,080 (26 Feb. 98), activation of rhodium-rhodium oxide catalyst<br>
Is essential to obtain the most active form of this catalyst.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2<br>
100 grams of supported platinum sulphide were prepared according to the<br>
procedure of the above Example 1, whereby a solution of chloroplatinic acid was<br>
employed instead of the rhodium chloride salt.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
The catalysts of all the above reported examples, along with commercially available<br>
platinum on Vulcan XC-72 (for example from E-TEK, Inc.), can be utilised in several<br>
different configurations. The catalyst of this invention is not limited by the structure of<br>
the gas diffusion electrode: for instance, in the present case, each catalyst of the above<br>
examples and comparative examples was incorporated in four different types of<br>
electrode structure, thereby obtaining sixteen different samples, according to the<br>
following procedures:<br>
a) ELAT: A web of carbon cloth with a warp-to-fill ratio of unity and about 25 to 50 yarns<br>
per inch, and a 97-99% of carbon content was selected from a commercially available<br>
product with a thickness of 10 to 15 mils. Carbon cloth with a thickness of 5 to 50 mils<br>
could have advantageously been used for this purpose. A mixture of fluorinated polymer<br>
(polytetrafiuoroethylene, P.T.F.E., commercialised by DuPont under the trademark<br>
Teflon®) and Shawinigan Acetylene Black (SAB) carbon, commercialised by Cabot<br>
Corp., was coated on each side of the carbon cloth, air drying at room temperature after<br>
each coat, until reaching at a total loading of 8 to 10 mg/cm2. A mixture of the powdered<br>
catalyst and Teflon® was then applied on one side of the carbon web in multiple coats<br>
until obtaining a layer of 0.5 to 2 mg of catalyst per square cm. After the final coat, the<br>
carbon cloth was heated to 340°C for 20 minutes.<br>
b). Single-sided ELAT: The above procedure for preparation of the ELAT was repeated<br>
except the SAB/Teflon® mixture was applied to only one side of the carbon cloth, with a<br>
loading of 4 to 5 mg/cm2. The catalyst coat was applied on the same side, on top of the<br>
SAB/Teflon® layer.<br>
c). Flow-through Electrode: A carbon cloth with the same specifications for the ELAT<br>
electrode was selected and 2 to 5 coats of a mixture of catalyst powder and Teflon® were<br>
applied to one side thereof. The coated fabric was then heated at 340°C for about 20<br>
minutes to obtain 1.03 mg/cm2 of rhodium metal. The final heating step or sintering step<br>
is believed to melt the Teflon® and distribute it across the carbon catalyst. However, the<br>
sintering step may be successfully omitted for this electrode.<br>
d). Membrane Electrode Assembly: An ink was formulated consisting of approximately<br>
3 parts catalyst and 1 part (as dry weight) Nafion® ionomer, such as that sold by<br>
Solutions Technology, (Mendenhall, Penn.) as a suspension in a mixture of water and<br>
lower aliphatic alcohols such as methanol, propanol, and/or butanol. The ink was applied<br>
to a Nafion® 324 ion exchange membrane, commercialised by DuPont, held in place with<br>
a heated vacuum table, via spraying or painting. Other ion exchange membranes known<br>
in the art may have alternatively been utilised. Subsequent layers of the ink were applied<br>
until depositing 0.05 to 1 mg metal/cm2 of catalyst. The assembly was further heated to<br>
remove solvents, and assembled with an appropriate electrode backing such as those<br>
disclosed in co-pending Patent Serial Number 09/184,089 (30 October 98). The catalyst<br>
ink as described could alternatively have been applied to an electrode backing,<br>
subsequently heated to remove solvents and assembled with an ion exchange<br>
membrane to form an equivalent membrane electrode assembly.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Prior to incorporation in gas diffusion electrodes, the resistance of this invention"s<br>
catalyst to corrosive media such as boiling solutions of HCI/CI2 can be simply determined<br>
and compared to prior art catalysts as well as rhodium sulphide prepared at various<br>
temperatures. One to five grams of the catalysts of Table 1 were placed in a 250 ml<br>
beaker containing 130g/l chlorine-saturated HCI and heated to boiling. The formation of<br>
a deep colour indicates the dissolution of the metal from the catalyst, thus providing<br>
evidence for whether the catalyst would be appropriate for use in systems for the<br>
recovery of chlorine from aqueous HCI solutions.<br>
Table 1 Summary of stability experiments for supported platinum and rhodium<br>
compounds, in boiling chlorine-saturated HCI<br>
From this Table it is evident that in order to produce a stable form of rhodium<br>
sulphide, some heat treatment step is mandatory. It is also possible to conclude that not<br>
all sulphides of precious metals are stable in these conditions, and furthermore, in view<br>
of the instability of supported platinum sulphide, it is surprising to find supported rhodium<br>
sulphide relatively inert in these conditions.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
The electrodes of Example 3 were subjected to an electrolysis laboratory test according<br>
to the scheme of Fig. 3. This configuration had a 3 mm gap between the cathode and<br>
the anode. However, equivalent results were obtained with a "zero-gap" adjustment,<br>
where the cathode and the anode were both pressed against the membrane. The<br>
exposed electrode surface area was 6.45 cm2 and the membrane was Nafion 324. The<br>
anode was titanium mesh activated with ruthenium oxide catalyst. Oxygen was fed to<br>
the cathode at a rate of up to five-fold stoichiometric excess at 45-50 mbar pressure and<br>
17% aqueous hydrogen chloride electrolyte (184+10 g/l) was fed to the anode. The<br>
said electrolyte was recirculated until 50% of the hydrogen chloride was depleted and<br>
then fresh electrolyte was added. The 50% depletion leads to a temporary increase in<br>
cell voltage, and is exhibited as "spikes" on a graph of voltage versus time. The<br>
electrolyte flow rate was 4 ml per minute or 0.372 m3hour/m2 at a back-pressure of 120<br>
mbar. Unless stated otherwise, the cells were run at 3 kA/m2 and all voltages were<br>
uncorrected for current collector resistance. The temperature of the cell and electrolyte<br>
was held at 55°C ± 5°C with heating tape applied to the cell metal end plates and an air<br>
conditioning unit.<br>
In commercial electrochemical plants, two common temporary operation modes<br>
are encountered which reflect the situations of either scheduled repair or replacement of<br>
worn-out components, or the unscheduled failure of these components. For the<br>
scheduled shut-downs, one can induce a "controlled" procedure, whereby elements of<br>
the plant are systematically turned off or attenuated to a lower operational level. In<br>
particular, chlorine can be degassed on the anode side and oxygen can be substituted<br>
with nitrogen on the cathode side. Conversely, during the unscheduled failures<br>
("uncontrolled" shut-downs), components of the plant are typically subjected to the most<br>
rigorous of operating conditions. In particular, chlorine and oxygen are left in the cell and<br>
as a consequence severe corrosion conditions arise. Since it is an object of this<br>
invention to provide a catalyst and gas diffusion electrode capable of operation in an<br>
electrochemical plant, the catalyst-electrode assemblies were tested in simulated<br>
controlled and uncontrolled shutdowns.<br>
These two interventions differ in the manner of turning off various components.<br>
For the controlled shutdown, an inert gas was fed to the cathode, and the rectifier current<br>
was slowly decreased, followed by turning the rectifier off. Once the rectifier was off, the<br>
pumps were halted. For the uncontrolled shut-down, oxygen flow was halted to the<br>
cathode while the rectifier and pump circuits were suddenly shut off. without the gradual<br>
decrease in current or flow rate.<br>
The catalyst of this invention was subjected to testing under the uncontrolled shut-down,<br>
and compared to current state-of-the art catalysts. Figure 4 shows the typical platinum<br>
catalyst in an ELAT™ electrode. While the operating voltage is 1.15 volts, the<br>
uncontrolled shut-down causes the catalyst to experience the full corrosive force of the<br>
electrolyte, and the cell potential increases by over 500 mV. Figure 5 shows the case of<br>
the rhodium/rhodium oxide of Comparative Example 1, incorporated in a single-sided<br>
ELAT, as described in Example 3, paragraph b). Here the initial steady-state voltage is<br>
just over 1.2 V, and only after activation does the voltage decrease below 1.2 V to<br>
approximately 1.18 V. Figure 6 is the case of a single-sided ELAT made with the<br>
rhodium sulphide catalyst of Example 1, as described in Example 3, paragraph b). The<br>
steady-state voltage of 1.15 V was obtained without any form of activation of the catalyst,<br>
either prior to assembly in the electrode or during operation in the laboratory test system.<br>
Figure 6 demonstrates that this new catalyst obtains desirable performance without an<br>
additional activation step, and that the catalyst activity is preserved after being exposed<br>
to the full corrosive force of solutions of HCI/CI2.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Since much of the waste aqueous HCI is generated after chlorinating an organic<br>
feedstock, there is often a significant level of organic contaminants in the recycled acid<br>
solution. Although one object in the design of oxygen reduction catalysts is to provide a<br>
catalyst that yields appreciable activity in the presence of high chloride ion<br>
concentrations, it is another goal to provide an oxygen reduction catalyst that yields<br>
appreciable activity in the presence of organic contaminants, as already mentioned.<br>
Such a catalyst may find utility in other applications as well, such as a cathode in Direct<br>
Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFC), whereby methanol crossing over from the anode to the<br>
cathode acts as a poison toward the latter when a platinum based state of the art<br>
catalyst, such as the commercial product cited in the Example 4, is used. In any case, it<br>
is well known that methanol ranks among the organic molecules with the highest activity<br>
towards adsorption on transition metals, therefore the behaviour in the presence of<br>
methanol of a transition metal-based catalyst is fairly representative of the general<br>
attitude of such catalyst to poisoning by organic contaminants.<br>
The efficacy of the rhodium sulphide catalyst to reduce oxygen in the presence of<br>
organic molecules has been assessed in a potentiostated three-electrode system. The<br>
three-electrode or "half cell" method fits 1 cm2 sample of gas diffusion electrode into an<br>
inert holder. The gas-fed side of the gas diffusion electrode is positioned into a plenum<br>
whereby an excess of air or oxygen is passed at low pressures (on the order of 10 mm of<br>
water or less). The face containing the catalyst (that would normally be against the<br>
membrane of an electrolyser or DMFC) is held in a 0.5M H2SO4 solution at a fixed<br>
temperature. The counter electrode is placed directly across the gas diffusion electrode,<br>
and a reference electrode is held in-between the two. The fixed geometry is maintained<br>
between the three electrodes through a specially constructed cap. A potentiostat is<br>
employed to control the potential and measure the current. A current interrupt device is<br>
placed in series with the electrodes and the internal resistance (IR) is subtracted from<br>
the readings. The direct addition of organic molecules such as methanol to the sulphuric<br>
acid solution allows the ready evaluation of catalyst performance in the presence of<br>
contaminants.<br>
Figure 7 shows the case of an ELAT activated with the commercial Pt on Vulcan<br>
XC-72 catalyst of Example 4 operated as the cathode under a potential control in the<br>
half-cell, at 70°C and in 0.5M H2SO4. For each addition of methanol since the very first<br>
one, an instant and substantial reduction in oxygen reduction current due to the<br>
methanol poisoning can be noticed. Figure 8 shows the ELAT™ of Example 3 paragraph<br>
a) activated with the rhodium sulphide catalyst of Example 1, operating under the same<br>
regimen. In, this case, a shift in cathodic potential was observed only at the highest<br>
concentration levels of methanol. These last two figures illustrate the highly selective<br>
nature of the rhodium sulphide catalyst inasmuch as the catalyst is able to readily reduce<br>
oxygen in the presence of methanol.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 3<br>
In an arrangement as shown in fig. 9 with an electrochemical cell of 100 cm2<br>
active area, a gap of 2 mm between anode and membrane of type Nafion 324 and an<br>
ELAT cathode of the single side type catalysed with platinum supported on carbon<br>
powder, technical grade hydrochloric acid was electrolysed. For this purpose the<br>
anolyte cycle was under hydrostatic pressure of 400 mbar to press the membrane<br>
against the ODC which itself was pressed against the cathodic current distributor<br>
mesh to be electrically contacted. The concentration of the anolyte cycle was kept at<br>
ca. 14 % as fed into the cell and the ca. 13% as leaving the cell. For this purpose the<br>
anolyte was circulated with a pump and the concentration loss in the electrolysis was<br>
compensated by continuously feeding fresh concentrated acid into the circuit. The<br>
temperature of the anolyte leaving the cell was controlled to about 70°C via a heat<br>
exchanger between pump and cell. The current density throughout the experiment<br>
was 5 kA/m2.<br>
As can be seen in fig. 10, during the electrolysis with chemical pure hydrochloric<br>
acid the cell voltage was between 1.06 and 1.08 V. With feeding the acid coming<br>
from the isocyanate plant which was purified with activated carbon and subsequently<br>
with adsorption resin of type OC 1066 from Bayer AG (Germany) the cell voltage<br>
gradually increased for 50 to 60 mV and stabilised at this level. In the same<br>
arrangement in a next step with the same purification hydrochloric acid of a multi<br>
plant site was supplied to the experiment. The effect was a dramatic increase of cell<br>
voltage for about 260 mV, which was only to a minor part recovered after a shut down,<br>
snowing the high sensitivity of the platinum catalyst with respect to organic contaminants<br>
especially of the second type, partly identified as tensides from polymerised ethylene<br>
and propylene oxides and acrylic acid esters. This effect is rather surprising in view of<br>
the fact that the ODC is hydraulically separated from the anode compartment by the<br>
Nafion membrane.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 4<br>
In another experiment with the same arrangement of fig. 9 but with a single<br>
sided ELAT catalysed with carbon powder carried rhodium / rhodium oxide the cell<br>
behaviour was found to be the following: the start-up voltage under chemical pure<br>
acid proved to be ca 130 mV higher trfan comparative example 3, as can be seen in<br>
figure 11. It should be noticed, that this test was run with a current density of 4 kA/m2<br>
and a temperature of 60°C. After feeding technical grade hydrochloric acid of the<br>
multi plant site mentioned in example 7 and purified with activated carbon and<br>
subsequently with another resin of type EP63 from Bayer AG (Germany) the cell<br>
voltage increased and stabilised about 100 mV higher. This behaviour was<br>
promising with respect to the reduced sensitivity against organic contaminants still<br>
passing the purification line. However, during this experiment the catalyst loss was<br>
nearly 30 %, as measured in catholyte drain. This gave a hint, that the stability of<br>
this catalyst against being leached out was not sufficient, as well as the cell voltage.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
In this experiment with the same arrangement as for comparative examples 3 and 4<br>
the new carbon powder carried catalyst on rhodium sulphide basis in a single side<br>
ELAT was tested in comparison to a platinum catalyst in the same type ELAT. With a<br>
current density of 5 kA/m2 and an operating temperature of 70 °C the starting voltage<br>
proved to be merely 40 mV higher for the rhodium sulphide catalyst as for the<br>
platinum catalyst during the first days of operation with chemical pure hydrochloric<br>
acid. With acid coming from an isocyanate plant which was purified with activated<br>
carbon and subsequently with adsorption resin of type OC 1066 from Bayer the cell<br>
voltage stabilised only 20 mV higher, as can be seen in figure 12. The voltage<br>
increase for the platinum catalyst was 40 mV. Changing to the technical grade<br>
hydrochloric acid of the multi plant site, purified the same way, the voltage increased<br>
further 10 mV only for the rhodium sulphide catalyst but about 260 mV for platinum<br>
catalyst. Omitting the second step of purification with resin of type OC 1066 the<br>
increase in cell voltage was 10 mV only for the rhodium sulphide. Electrolysis<br>
without any purification resulted in an increase of cell voltage for 20 mV for the<br>
ihodium sulphide catalyst only. These last two steps had not been performed with<br>
the platinum catalyst. Going back to the full purification proved the effect of<br>
increasing cell voltage to be reversible for the rhodium sulphide catalyst.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
In a long time test run over 90 days with the same arrangement and using a rhodium<br>
sulphide catalyst as in example 7 technical grade hydrochloric acid of a multi plant<br>
site only purified with activated carbon or chemical pure hydrochloric acid were<br>
supplied alternately. The surprising result was that nearly no effect due to the<br>
technical grade acid was found, which proved that the purification with activated<br>
carbon is sufficient, as can be seen in figure 13. The organic impurities,<br>
predominantly mono and di-chlorobenzenes, can be reduced to a level of 
with the activated carbon.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
In a pilot plant with a four element electr6lyser of an element size of 0.85 m2 a long time<br>
test under industrial conditions was performed. In an analogous arrangement as in fig. 9<br>
with 400 mbar anolyte pressure, the operating temperature was controlled to 
the hydrochloric acid inlet concentration to ca. 14% by weight. Except for the start-up<br>
period with 3 kA/m2 throughout the operation a current density of 4 kA/m2 was kept. Over<br>
a period of more than 280 days, predominantly technical grade hydrochloric acid of the<br>
multi plant site type was electrolysed. The acid was purified with activated carbon only.<br>
As can be seen from figure 14, the element voltage was surprisingly stable, showing<br>
again the high tolerance of inserted rhodium sulphide catalyst in ELAT type<br>
electrodes. The other very positive result was the indifference of the electrodes<br>
under shut down conditions. The plant was shut down without polarisation for 16<br>
times and no influence on the voltage could be observed. The amount of catalyst<br>
Joss as measured via rhodium content in the catholyte drain was in total about 6.5%<br>
by weight with respect to the total amount of catalyst. The main loss occurred during<br>
the first start up and the first shut downs (ca. 3%). During normal operation the loss<br>
of catalyst was found to be 1.57% by weight only, promising together with the<br>
decreasing losses during shut downs an electrode lifetime of several years.<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
In a laboratory cell in the experimental arrangement of examples 7 and 8 an oxygen<br>
depolarised cathode of the flow through type catalysed with rhodium sulphide was<br>
tested with technical grade hydrochloric acid of the multi plant site purified with<br>
activated carbon only as in examples 7 through 9. The electrode was intermittently<br>
supplied with pure oxygen and air. It could be proven that even with air as cathodic<br>
feed-gas the cell could be operated up to 5 kA/m2. Despite the fact, that technical<br>
grade acid was utilised, there was the surprising result of a good performance of the<br>
cell: applying 4 kA/m2 the voltage increase was found to be 160 mV after three days<br>
of conditioning, see fig 15. Raising the current density to 5 kA/m2 the voltage<br>
increased for another 160 mV. The air flow was 1 mVh and 1.7 nrrVh respectively.<br>
After reducing the depth of the cathodic gas room from 20 mm to 5 mm the air flow<br>
rate could be reduced to 0.4 m3/h for 5 kA/m2 and the voltage was even lower with<br>
the reduced air flow rate, showing the possibility for further optimisation for this<br>
mode of operation in increasing the off-gas exchange rate with reducing the flow<br>
channel dimension. The important result is that using a flow through type oxygen<br>
depolarised cathode catalysed with rhodium sulphide an operation with air and with<br>
technical grade hydrochloric acid is possible.<br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
A comparative test with technical grade hydrochloric acid under the same conditions<br>
as in example 10 with a single sided ODC versus a flow through type ODC, both<br>
catalysed with RhSx was carried out. An increasing amount of nitrogen mixed into the<br>
pure oxygen results in a voltage increase applying the single sided ODC. With only<br>
30% of nitrogen the voltage reaches a level of &gt;1.6 V with a strong exponential<br>
behaviour towards higher percentages of nitrogen. The behaviour of the flow through<br>
type ODC in the contrary showed a much smaller effect, as can be seen in figure 16.<br>
In addition it could be shown that an increase of the gas flow by a factor of 5 through<br>
the same non flow optimised cathode chamber reduces the increase of cell voltage<br>
with the flow through type ODC from 70 mV to 30 mV only. This indicates that only<br>
the flow through type ODC was capable to be operated with depleted oxygen or<br>
even with air. At the same time the RhSx catalysed ODC was found to be tolerant<br>
against organic impurities in the hydrochloric acid.<br>
