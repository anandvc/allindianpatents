				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>Over 150 million tonnes of industrial wastes are produced from various agro-industrial processes per annum in India. The major solid industrial wastes have been identified are fly ash, phosphogypsum, fluorogypsum, lime sludge, red mud, mine tailings etc. These materials require immediate attention to reduce environmental pollution and health hazards and at the same time to mitigate disposal problems associated with them. Investigations were, therefore, undertaken to formulate cementitious binders by judicious blending of the ground fly ash with the gypsum anhydrite (Fluorogypsum or by-product gypsum), hydrated lime sludge, calcined clay, portland cement including a chemical activator. It was found that cementitious binder of high compressive strength may be produced by admixing 10-15 wt.% gypsum anhydrite (fluorogypsum), 5-20 wt.% calcined clay pozzolana, 15-20 wt.% lime sludge, 10-15 wt.% portland cement and 1-2 wt.% chemical activator (Na2SO4.1OH2O) with 50-60 wt. % of fly ash. The cementitious binders were produced with and without addition of portland cement. The strength development of binders take place through formation of ettringite (C3A. 3CaSO4. 32H2O), C-S-H and C4AH,3. The binders are emminently suitable for making cement mortar of high compressive strength and high workability properties. Cost - wise, these binders are cheaper than the portland cement and conform to the strength characteristics of BS : 6610-1991, Specification for pulverized fuel ash pozzolanic cement.The findings further infer that fly ash can be used in the range 50-60% in formulating these binders along with other wastes to alleviate environmental pollution.</td>

				<td>The present invention relates to a "Compositions for Making Cementitious<br>
Binders Based on High Fly ash content, Clay Pozzolana and Other Minerals<br>
or Industrial Wastes for Use in Cement Mortar and Concrete".<br>
The Compositions can be used for preparing cementitious binder<br>
based on fly ash, calcined clay, gypsum anhydrite ( by-product gypsum or<br>
natural gypsum) and lime or lime sludge, portland cement and small<br>
quantity of a chemical activator. The production of cementitious binder will<br>
consume sizeable quantities of industrial solid wastes and may help in<br>
reducing threat to environment.<br>
Fly ash is produced as finely divided by-product from the combustion<br>
of pulverised coal in suspension fired furnaces of thermal, power plants. It is<br>
collected by electrical or mechanical precipitators or cyclones or bag filters.<br>
It is normally, finer than portland cement and comprises of rounded glassy<br>
particles of variable chemicals and mineralogical compositions. The<br>
properties of fly ash show variation and depend upon numerous factors, such<br>
as the composition of coal (bitumenous, sub-bitumenous and lignite coals),<br>
fineness of coal, flame temperature, oxidation conditions and mode of<br>
collection of fly ash. Several countries and organisations have their own<br>
standard specifications and requirements for fly ash to be used as mineral<br>
admixture or as pozzolana. ASTM C 618-89, defines the pozzolana as<br>
"siliceous or siliceous and aluminuous materials which is themselves possess<br>
little or no cementitious value but in finely divided form and in the presence<br>
of moisture chemically react with Ca(OH)2 at ordinary temperature to form<br>
compounds possessing cementitious properties". ASTM C 618-89 classify<br>
the pozzolana into class N, F, C and S. Class N refers to raw or calcined<br>
natural pozzolana such as some diatomacious earths, opline, shales or cherts,<br>
and volcanic or pumicites. Class S refers to processed, pumicites which are<br>
porous forms of volcanic glass and to certain calcined and ground<br>
diatomites, clays &amp; shales. Classs F and C pozzolanas refer to fly ash<br>
derived from the burning of different coals. Physical and chemical properties<br>
of fly ash play an important role in imparting the pozzolanic reactivity and in<br>
the production of cement mortar and concrete. Most of the fly ash particles<br>
are glassy or amorphous. Yet the minerals like quartz, mullite, silimanite,<br>
crysto-bellite, haematite and calcium compounds including calcium sulphate<br>
may be present as crystalline compounds constituting about 15.0 percent by<br>
weight of the fly ash. Some of the carbon in coal particles does not burn<br>
properly and thus fly ashes also possess unburnt carbon. Over 500 million<br>
tonnes of fly ash is produced annually by thermal power plants all over the<br>
world (R.C. Joshi and R.P.Lohtia, Types and Properties of Fly ash, Progress<br>
in Cement &amp; Concrete - Mineral Admixtures in Cement and Concrete, Vol.<br>
4, 1st Edn., 1993, Academia Books International, New Delhi, p. 121). In<br>
India 70 percent power is generated through coal based thermal power plants<br>
which throw 70 million tonnes of fly ash per annum. Not more than 10.0 per<br>
cent of fly ash is being used in India at present. The major reasons for<br>
limited utilization of fly ash may be non-availability of quality grade fly ash<br>
complying with IS:3812 (Part-I)-1981, specification of fly ash for use as<br>
pozzolana in solid form and due to its less reactivity compared to foreign fly<br>
ashes. However, the utilization of fly ash is an important building material<br>
which has been accepted as an engineering fact in the technologies in<br>
advanced countries. Extensive work has been accomplished abroad as well<br>
as in India regarding effective utilization of fly ash in areas such as factory<br>
produced portland pozzolana cement, ready mixed fly ash concrete for use<br>
as structural concrete in the manufacture of precast building products<br>

ash has been made substantially in the manufacture of cementitious binders<br>
in conjunction with calcined gypsum, cement and chemical retarders (Manjit<br>

50 per cent fly ash was used both in moist cold blending and hot curing<br>
environments and the durability of systems was established.Thus, binders<br>
based on fly ash have been produced in combination with other wastes as<br>
cited above but very limited work has been done on the activation of fly<br>
ashses. Generally, fly ash is activated by (1) addition of chemical additives<br>
to fly ash concrete (2) mechanical grinding of fly ash and by (3) curing fly<br>
ash concrete at elevated temperature respectively (Caijun, Shi and L.Day<br>

9518, Jan 6, 1993. Activation of fly ash hydrated lime blends (80 and 20<br>
percent by mass) by Na2SO4 or CaCl2.2H2O chemicals at 50°C has been<br>
claimed (Caijun Shi, Pozzolanic reaction and microstructure of chemical<br>
activated lime-fly ash pastes, ACI Materials J., Sept. - Oct. 1998, pp 537 -<br>
545) which establish the understanding of chemical activation of reactivity<br>
of fly ashes. Besides fly ash, several other industrial solid wastes such as<br>
phosphogypsum, fluorogypsum, lime sludges etc. are produced from the<br>
phosphoric acid, hydrofuoric acid, acetylene/sugar/paper industries<br>
respectively. In India over 5.0 million tonnes of phosphogypsum as well as<br>
lime sludge and about 0.2 million tonnes of fluorogypsum are produced<br>
annually which require judiceous disposal and utilization. Enormous work<br>
has been done on these wastes throughout the world regarding their<br>
beneficiation and utilization as potential building material (R.K.Collings,<br>

Mining and Metallurgy Bulletin, Vol. 65, Sept. 1972, pp 41-51; Manjit<br>
Singh et. al., An improved process for the purification of phosphogypsum,<br>

National Seminar on Building Materials - Their Science and Technology<br>
New Delhi, 15-16 April 1982; 11 B, pp 1-4. Several cements and<br>
cementitious materials are being produced through out the world using fly<br>
ash. In India fly ash being used in the range of 10 to 25 percent (by mass) in<br>
the manufacture of portland pozzolana cement as per 18:1489-1976,<br>
Specification for Portland pozzolana cement. The properties of PPC are at<br>
par with the properties of ordinary portland cement (OPC) of 33 grade as per<br>
18:269-1989, Specification for 33 grade ordinary portland. The quantity of<br>
fly ash differs from country to country for making PPC. Various European<br>
standards have now permitted large quantities of fly ash to be blended with<br>
cement for its uses in construction activities. In BS:6610-1991, Specification<br>
for pozzolanic fuel ash cement; the fly ash has been allowed to be<br>
incorporated in the range 41 to 53 percent and the compressive strength of<br>
cement prescribed is &gt; 12.0 and 22.5 N/mm2 at 7 and 28 days respectively.<br>
In continuation of these cements, two cementitious binders (1) containing 60<br>
percent fly ash, 5.0 percent calcined clay pozzolana, 10.0 percent each of<br>
gypsum anhydrite (fluorogypsum, by-product gypsum or natural gypsum)<br>
and portland cement, 15.0 percent calcined hydrated lime sludge and 1.0<br>
percent sodium sulphate (Na2SO4.10H2O) activator and (2) the binder<br>
containing 50.0 percent fly ash, 20.0 percent calcined clay pozzolana, 10.0<br>
percent gypsum anhydrite ( by-product gypsum or natural gypsum), 20.0<br>
percent calcined hydrated lime sludge and 1.0 percent sodium sulphate<br>
activator have been produced at CBRI, Roorkee conforming to strength<br>
requirements (7 and 28 days) of BS:6610-1991, specification for pozzolanic<br>
pulverized fuel ash cement have been claimed for the first time.<br>
The development of cementitious binders from fly ash and other<br>
industrial wastes, such as gypsum anhydrite (by-product gypsum or natural<br>
gypsum), calcined clay, hydrated lime sludge to give strength and other<br>
characteristics similar to strength requirements as per 18:6610-1991 are the<br>
novel features which were not possible to achieve earlier just by blending<br>
gypsum anhydrite ( by-product gypsum or natural gypsum) or hydrated<br>
lime with the fly ash.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a<br>
Composition for making cementitious binders based on high fly ash<br>
content, clay pozzolana and other industrial wastes.<br>
Another object is to provide cement mortar and concrete made from<br>
the novel compositions containing industrial solid wastes.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a 'composition for<br>
making cementitious binders based on high fly ash content, clay pozzolana<br>
and other industrial wastes for use in cement mortar and concrete which<br>
comprises:<br>
Pulverised fly ash (400 to 520 m2/kg) in the range of 50 to 65 wt. %;<br>
gypsum anhydrite ( by-product gypsum or natural gypsum) (350 to 450<br>
m2/kg) in the range of 15 to 15 wt. %; Calcined clay pozzolana (400 to<br>
530 m2/kg) in the range of 5 to 20 wt. %; lime sludge (350 to 430<br>
m2/kg) in the range of 10 to 25 wt. %; Portland cement (300 to 330<br>
m2/kg) in the range of 10 to 15 wt. %; and Sodium Sulphate activator<br>
(350 to 400 m2/kg) in the range of 1 to 2 wt.%.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, fly ashes of lime reactivity<br>
3.0 to 5.0 N/mm2 may be used to form binders.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the pozzolanic clay<br>
may be obtained by calcining the clay at a temperature in the range of 700 to<br>
1000°C for a period of 15 minutes to 200 minutes.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the lime may be<br>
produced by calcining the lime sludge /stone at a temperature in the range of<br>
950 to 1100°C for a period of 15 minutes to 4.0 hours.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the fly ash may<br>
have SiO2 in the range of 50-60 wt. %, A12O3 + Fe2O3 in the range of 20 to<br>
33 wt.%, loss on ignition, in the range of 0.5 to 5.0 wt. % and lime reactivity<br>
3.0 to 5.0 N/mm2.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the gypsum<br>
anhydrite (by-product gypsum or natural gypsum) may have SO3 in the<br>
range of 50 to 56 wt. %, loss on ignition in the range of 0.40 to 0.92 wt.%,<br>
and fluoride in the range of 1.0 to 2.0 wt.%.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the pozzolanic<br>
clay may have SiO2 in the range of 40 to 50 wt.%, and A12O3 + Fe2O3 in the<br>
range of 35.0 to 40.0 wt.%.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the lime sludge<br>
may have cotamination of P2O5 and F in the range of 1.0 to 3.5 wt.% and 1.0<br>
to 2.0 wt. % respectively.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the fly ash may<br>
be ground to a fineness of 400 to 520 m2/kg (Blaine) in a ball mill or a<br>
pulverizer.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention commercial grade<br>
chemical activator such as sodium sulphate (Na2SO4. 10H2O) may be used.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, various<br>
consituents are first uniformally blended in a blender followed by grinding<br>
in a ball mill or pulverizer to achieve a fineness of 500 to 530 m2/kg<br>
(Blaine).<br>
All these ingredients are mixed parts by weight except<br>
activator which is mixed by wt.% of the total wt. of the binder.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides composition of<br>
cementitious binders which can be produced by intimately mixing 50 to 60<br>
percent ground fly ash (400 to 520 m2/kg) (Blaine) with the ingredients such<br>
as 5 to 20% calcined clay pozzolana (400 to 530 m2/kg, (Blaine) produced at<br>
700 to 1000°C), 10 to 15% gypsum anhydrite ( by-product gypsum or<br>
natural gypsum) (350 to 450 m2/kg (Blaine), and lime sludge (350 to 430<br>
m2/kg (Blaine) calcined at 950 to 1100°C) and 10 - 15% portland cement<br>
(300 to 330 m2/kg (Blaine) and 1 - 2% sodium sulphate activator (350 to 400<br>
m2/kg Blaine) followed by grinding in the ball mill to a fineness of 500 to<br>
530 m2/kg (Blaine) to form uniformally blended binder which is hardened to<br>
give a strong mass through formation of ettringite (C3A.3CaSO4.32H2O),<br>
tobermorite C-S-H and tetracalcium aluminium hydrate (C4AHi3)<br>
conforming to BS:661 0-1 991.<br>
The process for making cementitious binders from fly ash and other<br>
industrial wastes consists of calcining the clay (700 - 1000°C) and lime<br>
sludge (950- 1 100°C) whereby clay is transformed into reactive pozzolana of<br>
high lime reactivity (8-12 N/mm2) and lime sludge into lime. The lime is<br>
converted into hydrated lime by sprinkling l/3rd (by mass) of the water on<br>
the lime. The calcined clay pozzolana and the gypsum anhydrite (by-product<br>
gypsum or natural gypsum) ground to the requisite finenesses are then<br>
blended with ground fly ash (50-60%), portland cement and the sodium<br>
sulphate activator followed by grinding to form cementitious binders.<br>
The fly ash, clay, gypsum anhydrite ( by-product gypsum or natural<br>
gypsum) , lime sludge and portland cement samples are analysed for their<br>
chemical constituents as per standard test procedures and subjected to DTA<br>
and XRD to identify the composition of the materials. The clay pozzolana is<br>
produced by heating the clay sample in a furnace or rotary kiln at 700-<br>
1000°C for a period of 15 minutes to 200 minutes. The lime sludge<br>
(sugar/paper/acetylene industries) is heated at 950-1100°C in a furnace or<br>
rotary calciner for a period of 15 minutes to 4.0 hours to get lime. After<br>
cooling, the calcined lime sludge is crushed to coarser powder and then<br>
slaked. About l/3rd of water by the weight of lime is sprinkled over the lime<br>
powder gradually and is thoroughly mixed. After 15-20 minutes, the<br>
hydration/slakening occurs with heat liberation and the slaking is completed<br>
in a period of one hour. After cooling, the finely divided white hydrated lime<br>
is screened through 300 micron sieve and the coarse fruction is discarded.<br>
The samples of fly ash, calcined clay, gypsum anhydrite (fluorogypsum,byproduct<br>
gypsum or natural gypsum), hydrated lime, portland cement and<br>
Na2SO4.10H2O activator dried at 42 + 2°C are ground to the fineness of 400<br>
to 520 nr/kg, 400 to 530 nr/kg, 350 to 450 nr/kg, 300 to 330 m2/kg and 350<br>
to 400 m2/kg (Elaine) respectively. After grinding, the fly ash, calcined clay,<br>
gypsum anhydrite (fluorogypsum,by-product gypsum or natural gypsum) <br>
hydrated lime, portland cement and Na2SO4.10H2O activator are blended in<br>
two proportions (1) 60% fly ash, 5.0% calcined clay pozzolana, 10.0% each<br>
of gypsum anhydrite (by-product gypsum or natural gypsum), and portland<br>
cement, 15.0% calcined hydrated lime and 1.0% Na2SO4.10H2O activator<br>
and (2) 50% fly ash, 20% clay pozzolana, 10.0% gypsum anhydrite<br>
(fluorogypsum,by-product gypsum or natural gypsum), 20% hydrated lime<br>
and 1.0% Na2SO4.10H2O activator (by wt.%) respectively followed by<br>
grinding in a ball mill to form an uniform cementitious binder. The<br>
cementitious binder is then ready for packing.<br>
The chemistry of cementitious binder is predominently is based on the<br>
reactivity of fly ash and clay pozzolana. Fly ash is a pozzolanic material<br>
which shows reactivity when interacted with lime in presence of water and<br>
produce insoluble stable cementitious products. The reactivity of fly ash is<br>
due to amorphous SiO2, A12O3 and Fe2O3 constituents. Similarly, calcined<br>
clay contains amorphous SiO2 and A12O3 including Fe2O3. The quantities of<br>
these constituents vary with the type of the clay mineral used. The<br>
metastable silicate present in fly ash and clay pozzolana reacts with Ca2+<br>
ions contributed by the hydration of portland cement and lime and form<br>
water insoluble calcium silicates (C-S-H), C4AH13 and aluminate hydrate<br>
compounds. Besides fly ash and clay pozzolanas, the cementitious binders<br>
contain gypsum anhydrite ( by-product gypsum or natural gypsum) which on<br>
addition of water releases SO4<br>
2" ions which further combiness with A12O3<br>
and CaO available in the aqueous phase and form ettringite<br>
(C3A.3CaSO4.32H2O). The development of C-S-H, C4AH13 and ettringite<br>
compounds have been amply demonstrated by differential thermal analysis<br>
(DTA) and scanning, electron microscopy of the hydrated cementitious<br>
binder. The interaction of fly ash and clay pozzolana with the moist lime and<br>
gypsum to form cementitious materials is shown below:<br>

In the above equations a, b, c, x, y and z are the variables that are<br>
dependent on the temperature, pressure and molar ratios of the reactants. It<br>
may be noted here that transformation of gypsum anhydrite (by-product<br>
gypsum or natural gypsum) which is an anhydrite (CaSCU) into gypsum<br>
dihydrate is a slow process, the addition of Na2SO4.10H2O activator<br>
facilitates rapid transformation of anhydrite into gypsum and also accelerate<br>
the interaction of SiO2, A12C&gt;3 and Fe2O3 of fly ash and clay pozzolana to<br>
precipitrate cementitious compounds.<br>
The following example is given by way of illustration of the present<br>

compressive strength complying with the strength requirements of BS:6610-<br>
1991. The Cementitious binders were found sound as the cold expansion<br>
was within the maximum specified value of 5.0 mm laid down in IS:6909-<br>
1983, specification for super-sulphated cement. Hence, these two mix<br>
compositions are recommended for commercialization.<br>
The suitability of optimum mix composition of cementitious binders<br>
i.e. 'B' and 'D' were tested and evaluated for making masonry mortars. The<br>
results are listed in Tables 4 and 5.Data show that masonry mortars 1:3 and<br>
1:4 binder-sand (P.M. 2.20 and P.M. 1.26) have much higher strength and<br>
water-retentivity than the conventionally used 1:6, cement-sand mortars and<br>
comply with the minimum specified strength of 2.5 and 5.0 N/mm2 at 7 and<br>
