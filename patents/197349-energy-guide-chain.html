				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to an energy guide chain for cables and the like, the chain links of which comprise opposing side walls and upper and lower transverse webs or walls connecting those side walls, and are articulated to one another , the energy guide chain forming a lower, approximately rectilinear portion (lower half) which is adjoined, via a turn-around region of more than 180°, by an upper, slack region (upper half) of which the lower side slides at least partially on the upper side of the lower half, and some chain links being provided with guide stops which prevent: lateral movement of the opposite half of the chain.<br>
Chain Jinks in the sense of the present invention are to be understood as being both chain links having transverse webs releasably secured to the side walls and chain links having transverse webs formed in one piece with the side walls. The transverse webs may also have a larger extent in the longitudinal direction of the chain so that the inner space of the energy guide chain is almost completely enclosed.<br>
Also to be included are energy guide chains composed of a continuous, for example extruded, flexible moulded body in the case of which the chain links are formed, for example, as a result of the fact that the outer wall and the side walls of the moulded body are separated by recesses, the moulded body wall that is on the Inside in the turn-abound region being substantially in the form of a continuous belt. The articulations connecting the chain links to one another are substantially in the form of film or strap hinges owing to the resilient deformability of the material of the energy guide chain.<br>
If the energy guide chain has a relatively long travel and guide channels in which the upper and lower halves of the chain are laid are not used,<br>
chain occurs owing to the axial play of the chain links relative to one another. This leads to the sliding edges of the side walls of the upper half of the chain sliding over the outside of the lower transverse webs or transverse walls so that these relatively thin components may be abraded and, in the worst case, destroyed. Furthermore, if there are relatively great deviations from the straight course , the chain may tilt or fall off the side. If there are relatively great lateral deviations,<br>
the hinge connections of the chain linka are also placed under excessive strain.<br>
DE 44 :33 678 Al has already disclosed energy guide chains comprising chain links which have, on the outer side of at least one side wall, a guide stop which is constructed, for example, as a slide-like guide stop, star handle or one- or two-armed lever, the guide stops being movable to a limited extent in the plane of the outer side of the chain link side walls or in a plane parallel thereto. In the chain region in which the upper half slides on the lower half, the side walls of the opposite half ace overlapped and guided in the running direction of the chain by the guide stops so that, at least in that region, lateral deviations are no longer possible. If during the travel of the energy guide chain the guide stops of the upper half of the chain co-operate with those of the lower half in such a manner that the guide stops of the upper half are turned, pivoted upwards or displaced upwards, the rate of travel of the energy guide chain is limited thereby, because otherwise the holders of the guide stops would be exposed to excessive loads. In addition, the co-operation of the guide stops at high rates of travel entails considerable noise development. This is especially the case when the energy guide<br>
chain, starting from its connection point, is extended fully in both directions, so that, during travel, each of the guide stops of the upper half of the chain is moved and thus contributes to noise emission. Furthermore, when guide stops are arranged on the side of the side walls, the additional broadening of the energy guide chain and tho irregular outer contour, which can easily lead to the side projections' hooking into one another, are disturbing.<br>
The problem of the invention is to provide guiding for enorgy guide chains in the case of which the above-nentioned disadvantages are eliminated and which, especially, has no troublesome side projections and is easy and inexpensive to manufacture.<br>
This problem is solved according to the invention in that the guide stops are in the form of webs extendj.ng in the longitudinal direction of the chain end at least one guide stop on the chain links of one half of the chain engages between two guide stops on the chain links of the opposite half of the chain, so that the engaged chain links are secured against transverse displacement relative to one another.<br>
The guide stops can be arranged on the outer regionn of the upper side of the chain links of the lower half of the chain or of the lower side of the chain links of the upper half of the chain. Guiding preventing transverse movement therefore advantageously takes place at the outer regions of the chain. The guide stops may, however, also be arranged in other regions of the upper side of the upper half of the chain or of the lower side of the upper half of the chain.<br>
The guide stops are preferably constructed as double webs in the form of U-sections, the intermediate spaces of which complement the webs. "Complement" in this context is intended to mean that tKe webs and intermediate spaces between the webs are in a form such that they co-operate to prevent transverse movement of the chain links. Of course, the intermediate spaces may be larger to a greater or lesser extent than the width of the webs so that slight transverse movement, which does not, however, substantially impair the straight guiding of the chain links lying above one another, is permitted.<br>
An especially preferred embodiment provides for a large number of guide stops which form a comb structure extending over the width of the chain<br>
links, the web-form guide stops of the chain links of one half of the chain engaging in complementary<br>
stops of the chain links of the opposite half.<br>
At the transition of the lower half of the chain into the upper half, the webs of the contacting chain links are first positioned above one another with upacing between. As the energy guide chain travels further, the webs of the mutually contacting chain links of the upper and lower halves of the chain seat on one another. Owing to the articulation play transverse to the axis of the chain links, a lateral offsetting of the chain links lying above one another takes place as the energy guide chain travels so that their webs engage in the manner of a comb in the U-shaped intermediate spaces of the opposing chain links with the result that one limb of each chain link is guided between two limbs of the opposing chain link and further lateral movement of the opposing chain links is prevented.<br>
The ccmb structure extending over the width, preferably the entire width, of the chain links also has the advantage that it permits an especially large bearing face of the mutually contacting webs and U-shaped intermediate spaces<br>
and tMs gives rise to an especially low degree of abrasive wear on the guide stops. Especially when the wib ends and the base of the U-shaped intermediate spaces are in the form of flat slide faces, the entire width of the chain links is available as a bearing face and therefore as a slide face, so that, at a given weight of the upper half of the chain, there is only a slight surface pressing of the components on one another and thus an embodiment exhibiting an especially low degree of wear is provided.<br>
The longth of the guide stops is also advantageously such that, when the upper and lower halves of the chain are in an extended arrangement, the guide stops exceed the length of the intermediate spaces existing between guide stops of consecutive chain links of the opposite half of the chain. When the lower half of the chain makes a transition via the turn-around<br>
region into the upper half of the chain, it is<br>
necessary to thread only the guide stops of the<br>
first chain link of the upper half of the chain betweon the guide stops of the lower half. The guide stops of the following chain links are then already in their threading position and can be readily arranged between the guide stops of the opposite half of the chain, This guiding of the<br>
guide stops provides for especially low-noise and especially smooth and trouble-free travel of the energy guide chain, which permits a very high rate of travel, in particular, separate positioning of the guide stops of each chain link by interaction with the guide stops of chain links of the opposite half of the chain is not neceseary, unlike the case of guide stops that are arranced on the outer side of the chain link side walls and that move under the action of the guide stops of the opposite half of the chain in the plane of the outer side and are conveyed into their desired position.<br>
The length of the guide stops can also, however, but while forfeiting smooth running, be smaller than the length of the intermediate spaces between guide stops of the opposite half of the chain because the lateral offsetting of the chain links, especially when the rate of travel is high, is generally not so great that the guide stops come out of their track when passing through the intermediate space between the guide stops of adjacent chain links.<br>
Advantageously, the guide stops are of a length such t.hat they do not hinder the angling of adjacent chain links relative to one another, and<br>
the pivoting of adjacent chain links relative to one another is limited only by the stops provided for the purpose.<br>
In order not to obstruct the angling of adjacent chain links in the turn-around region, the guide stops should be offset from the central plane of the side portions in the direction towards one of the articulation regions of the chain links. The central plane is the plane arranged centrally betweon the articulation regions of a chain link perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction of the energy guide chain.<br>
in order to facilitate the threading of the guide stops of one half of the chain between the guide stops of the opposite half of the chain during the seating thereof, the upper or lower outer sides of the guide stops may be bevelled or the guide stops may he.ve a trapezoidal cross-section or the like. In order also to facilitate the tracking of the guide stops of one half of the chain between those of thci opposite half of the chain during the travel of the energy guide chain/ the end faces of the guide stops may also be bevelled.<br>
Advantageously, the guide stops are formed in one piece with the side of the chain links that faces<br>
the opposite half of the chain. The guide stops can the formed, for example, on the transverse weba which are non-releasably connected, for example injection-moulded, to the aide walls. The guide stops may, however, also be formed in one piece with other components, for example with the narrow sides of the chain link side portions.<br>
In the case of an energy guide chain having releasable transverse webs, the guide stops may advantageously be formed in one piece with the transverse webs. In that case, energy guide chains are especially easy to retrofit with suitable guide stops by exchanging the transverse webs.<br>
On the other hand, it is also possible to have embodiments in the case of which the guide stops are secured releasably to the chain links. Separate carriers with which the guide stops are, for example, formed in one piece may be provided for this purpose, the carriers being releasably securable to the chain links, for example to the side portions or the transverse webs. Securing may be effected, for example, by means of locking or clamping connections.<br>
Finally, the invention is to include embodiments in the case of which the guide stops are movable to a limited extent on the chain links. The webs extending in the longitudinal direction of the chain may be held, and may be displaceable in parallel manner/ for example in slots which extend transversely to the chain links and which are provided, for example, on the transverse webs. The length of the slots may be such that the webs of th€&gt; chain links which abut one another can move out of each other's way and can be moved past one another by displacement in the slots, optionally by means of run-on slopes arranged on the end faces. The movement of the webs is restricted by the erds of the slots so that, as guide stops sliding against one another at their sides, they prevent transverse movement of the chain links lying on top of one another. Automatic transition of the guide stops, for example, from the slot ends that are on the inside relative to the middle of the chain link, to the outer ends of the same during the passage of the chain links from the upper half of the chain to the lower half and vice<br>
versa  to alow   ended possible in that the slots<br>
are inclined in a slanting position along the transverse direction of the chain links, so that the displaceable guide stops are positioned as a result of gravity on the lower end of the slot,<br><br>
that is to say, in the lower half of the chain, for example on the outer ends of the slots and, in the upper half of the chain, on the inner ends of the slots.<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention is explained by way oil example and described with reference to the drawing.<br>
Figures 1 shows an energy guide chain which comprises a lower half, a turn-around region and an upper half and the links of which have guide stops on the side facing the opposite half of the chain,<br>
Figures 2 shows a cut-out portion of the energy guide chain according to Figure 1 in side view (top), in cross-section (middle) and in plan view (bottom), and<br>
Figure 3 is a cross-section through the energy guide chain according to Figure 1 on the section A-A with the upper half of the chain deposited on the lower half.<br>
The er.ergy guide chain 1 shown in Figures 1 to 3 comprises a large number of links 2 which are connected to one another at their ends, in such a<br><br>
manner that they are pivotable to a limited extent, by means of articulation bolts 3. The chain links 2 comprise offset side walls 4 which are connected to one another by upper and lower transverse webs 5.<br>
The energy guide chain 1 comprises a lower half 6 which makes a transition into an upper half 8 via a tun-around region 7. The chain links of the upper half and the lower half of the chain have an identical construction and are provided with guide stops 9 which prevent lateral movement of the lower half relative to the upper half.<br>
It ha 3 been found sufficient for many sizes of chain link to provide web-like guide stops that are approximately 5 mm high and that are 2-3 mm wide.<br>
As is shown especially in Figure 2, the side walls 4 have an offset-out region 10 and an offset-in region 11, the guide stops 9 extending at the level of the lower edge of the side portions 4 (according to the view at the top of Figure 2) over :he offset-in region 11 and partially over the offset-out region 10. Relative to the central plane 12 arranged centrally between the articulation regions of a chain link, the guide<br>
stops 9 are offset in the direction towards a respective articulation region of the chain links. The length of the guide stops 9 in the longitudinal direction of the chain is such that, taking into account the bending radius of, the energy guide chain in the turn-around region 7 (see Figure 1), the guide stops 9 do not obstruct the angling of adjacent chain links relative to one another, and the pivotability of the chain links is restricted only by the stops provided for the purpose. Therefore, in the turn-around region 7, thore is still a small distance between the guide stops 9 of consecutive chain links at the regions marked with the reference numeral 13. The guide stops may also have a shape other than the rectar.gular shape shown and may, for example, be trapezoidal in longitudinal section, it also being possible for the slanting sides of the trapezium to be constructed as angled abutment faces for adjacent guide stops.<br>
The guide stops 9 are in the form of rectangular webs having plane-parallel outer faces and are arranged at identical distances from one another on the mutually opposing transverse webs 5 of the chain links 2. The guide stops 9 form a comb structure which may be described as being composed of a large number of U-sections or webs, the limbs<br>
of the U-sections being formed by the guide stops 9 and the base of the U-sections being formed by the transverse web 5. In this embodiment, the guide stops 9 are manufactured from the same plastics material as the chain links and are formed in one piece with the transverse webs 5.<br>
Aa shown in Figure 3, the comb structures, formed by tho guide stops 9, of chain links of the upper half I) of the chain engage in the intermediate spaces of the comb structure of the chain links of the lower half 6 of the chain, so that lateral<br>
movemont of the chain links of the lower and upper relatives to one anotnar is preventea.  The<br>
spacing and width of the guide stops 9 are such that, being only slightly smaller than the opposing intermediate spaces, the guide stops are guided between the guide stops of the opposite half of the chain.<br>
If thci upper half 8 of the chain is guided in a sliding manner on the lower half 6, the end faces 14 of the guide stops are supported on the transverse webs or transverse walls of the opposing chain links. Overall, therefore, almost the entire width of the chain links is available as a bearing face, so that, in contrast to energy guide chains known hitherto, in the case of which<br>
only the narrow aides of the side walls, or skids provided thereon, are supported on one another, an especially large bearing face and thus a low-wear embodiment are provided.<br>
Aa shown in Figure 1, when the energy guide chain is turned around, the chain links of the region of the turn-around region 7 running out into the upper half 8 of the chain are passed over the chain links of the lower half 6 of the chain. If this takes place without lateral offsetting of the chain links relative to one another, the end faces 14 of the guide stops 9 of the upper half 8 of the chain are supported on those of the guide stops of the lower half 6 of the chain. Owing to the ever present articulation play transverse to the axis of the chain links one behind the other, however, a sliding movement of the guide stops 9 on one another occurs only over a small portion of the path of travel. The guide stops 9, with lateral offsetting of the chain links in the lowar and upper halves of the chain relative to one another, are then threaded into the intermediate spaces of the comb structure of the chain link beneath, so that the arrangement, shown in Figure 3, of the upper and lower halves of the chain is present at the lavel of section A-A. The threading-in operation is facilitated by the rounded or<br>
bevelled end faces 14 of the guide stops 9. If the arrangement, shown in Figure 3, of the upper and lower halves of the chain relative to one another is present in a portion of the energy guide chain then the comb structures of the respective<br>
followino chain links are readily threaded in as the energy guide chain travels and, because the<br>
length of the guide stops 9 in the longitudinal direction of the chain exceeds the length of the intermediate spaces 15 in the opposite half of the chain, once the comb structures have been threaded in, the guide stops are easily guided in the respective track without their having to act on one another, for example by means of run-on slopeu, or without their having to change their position relative to the chain links to which they are secured. Overall, this ensures that the energy guide chain travels with a very low degree of noise, even at a high rate of travel.  In addition, if the guide stops are secured in a fixed manner to the chain links, the present embodiment also requires very little maintenance.<br>
