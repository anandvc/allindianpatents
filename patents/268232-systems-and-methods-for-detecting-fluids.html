SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR DETECTING FLUIDS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]                The present invention relates to systems and methods for determining whether<br>
a fluid, such as saline solution, is present in a container, such as a package for storing a contact<br>
lens.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]                Contact lenses are commonly provided to the consumer in containers in the<br>
form of plastic packages. A typical package includes defines one or more cups each suitable<br>
for holding a contact lens. Each cup is usually filled with saline solution that immerses the<br>
contact lens, and maintains the contact lens in a hydrated condition. The cup may be covered<br>
by a piece of aluminum foil, or other suitable material, applied to the package after the contact<br>
lens and saline solution are introduced into the cup. The packaging process is typically<br>
performed using automated equipment centrally controlled by a programmable logic controller-<br>
or other suitable control device.<br>
[0003]                The cups of the packages may be filled using pumps that deliver a metered<br>
dose of saline solution. Thecentralized control device can be programmed to check whether<br>
each pump delivers a dose of saline solution to an associated cup. The controller can perform<br>
this function by monitoring whether the pump activates while the cup is positioned to receive<br>
saline solution from the pump. A secondary check can be performed before the cup is covered<br>
and sealed to verify that saline solution has been delivered to the cup.<br>
[0004]                The secondary check can be performed using a photoelectric proximity sensor<br>
that emits infrared light toward the cup. Saline solution, if present in the cup above a certain<br>
level, will reflect the infrared light. The proximity sensor, in turn, can detect the reflected light of<br>
a predetermined intensity, as measured by the proximity sensor, can be interpreted as an<br>

WO 2007/044847                                                                                       PCT/US2006/039849<br>
indication that saline solution is present in the cup above a certain level, e.g., above the half-full<br>
mark.<br>
[0005]                The operation of the sensor is dependent upon alignment of the sensor and the<br>
cup. In particular, the infrared beam emitted by the sensor may need to be focused precisely at<br>
the apex of the meniscus of the saline solution for the proximity sensor to provide an accurate<br>
indication of whether saline solution is present in the cup. The degree of alignment required for<br>
the proximity sensor to function optimally may be difficult to achieve and maintain in a<br>
production environment.<br>
[0006]                The operation of the proximity sensor can also be dependent upon the<br>
orientation of the meniscus of the saline solution. For example, air bubbles often form in the<br>
meniscus during filling of the cup and can alter the orientation of the meniscus, so that the<br>
beam of the proximity sensor is no longer focused at the apex of the meniscus. The sensor<br>
may issue false readings under such circumstances. In particular, the sensor may falsely<br>
indicate that the package does not contain saline solution, leading to an unwarranted rejection<br>
of the package and the associated contact lens.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007]                Fluids such as saline solution that are disposed in containers such as contact<br>
lens packages can be detected by directing ultrasonic energy at the container and receiving a<br>
return reflection of the ultrasonic energy. The ultrasonic energy and the return reflection can<br>
propagate through a shroud that substantially isolates the ultrasonic energy and the return<br>
reflection from air currents.<br>
[0008]                Preferred embodiments of a system comprise a container comprising a surface<br>
that forms a cup that holds the saline solution, and an ultrasonic sensor that directs acoustic<br>
energy at the surface, and detects a return reflection of the acoustic energy.<br>
[0009]                Preferred methods comprise directing acoustic energy at a surface of a<br>
container, the surface forming.a cup that holds saline solution, detecting a return reflection of<br>
the acoustic energy, and determining a distance between a point of origin of the acoustic energy<br>
and a point of reflection of the acoustic energy based on an elapsed time between directing the<br>
acoustic energy at the surface and detecting the reflection of the acoustic energy.<br>

[0010]                Other preferred embodiments of a system comprise a container having a<br>
surface that defines a cup, and a fluid disposed In the cup, an ultrasonic sensor that directs<br>
acoustic energy at the surface, detects a return reflection generated by contact between the<br>
acoustic energy and the fluid, and generates an output based on an elapsed time between<br>
directing the acoustic energy at the surface of the container and detecting the return reflection,<br>
and      a shroud coupled to the ultrasonic sensor.<br>
[0011]                Other preferred processes comprise placing a contact lens in a cup of a<br>
container, conveying the package to a first position proximate a pump, introducing saline<br>
solution into the cup using the pump, determining whether the pump was activated while the<br>
package was in the first position, conveying the package to a second position proximate an<br>
ultrasonic sensor, and directing acoustic energy at the cup and measuring a reflection of the<br>
acoustic energy while the container is in the second position using the ultrasonic sensor.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0023]                The figures depict a preferred embodiment of a system 10 for detecting fluid in<br>
a container, or package 12. The package 12 can be used to store a contact lens 14 during<br>
shipment of the contact lens 14 to the end user. The package 12 defines a semi-spherical<br>
bowl, or cup 16, as shown in Figure 8. The cup 16 holds the contact lens 14. The cup 16 is<br>
filled with saline solution 18 that immerses the contact lens 14, and maintains the contact lens    ,<br>
14 in a hydrated condition. The cup 16 can be covered and sealed by a piece of aluminum foil<br>
20 after the contact lens 14 and the saline solution 18 have been introduced into the cup 16.<br>
Specific details of the package 12 are disclosed herein for exemplary purposes only. The<br>
system 10 can include packages configured differently than the packages 12.<br>
[0024]                As shown in Figure 1, the package 12 can be filled with the saline solution 18 at<br>
a pump station 26 after the contact lens 14 has been placed in the cup 16. The package 12 can<br>
be supported on a pallet 21 as the contact lens 14 and the saline solution 18 are introduced into<br>
the cup 16. The pallet 21 is depicted in Figures 1, 2, and 9. The pallet 21 can accommodate<br>
ten of the packages 12, arranged in two rows of five. The pallet 21 can be transported to and<br>
from the pump station 26 by a conveyor 22.<br>
[0025]                The pump station 26 includes a plurality of pumps 28 for introducing a dose of<br>
saline solution 18 into each cup 16 of the packages 12, as shown in Figure 9. The nominal<br>
dose of saline solution 18 fills the cup 16 to within approximately 1.0 mm (0.039 inch) of the<br>
upper end of the cup 16.<br>
[0026]                As shown in Figure 10, the pumps 28, conveyor 22, and other equipment<br>
associated with the packaging of the contact lenses 14 can be communicatively coupled to a<br>
centralized controller, such as a programmable logic controller (PLC) 30. The PLC 30 can<br>
4<br>
WO 2007/044847                                                                                       PCT/US2006/039849<br>
coordinate the overall packaging process for the contact lenses 14. The PLC 30 can perform<br>
an initial check of whether saline solution 18 has been introduced to each package 12 on the<br>
pallet 21 by the pumps 28. In particular, the PLC 30 can be programmed to check whether<br>
each pump 28 activates when the pallet 12 is positioned beneath the pump station 26. The<br>
PLC 30 can be programmed to classify all of the packages 12 on a particular pallet 21 as<br>
rejects if the PLC 30 determines that one or more of the pumps 28 has not activated. The<br>
packages 12 designated as rejects can subsequently be disposed of as scrap.<br>
[0027]                As shown in Figures 1-5, the system 10 comprises a plurality of ultrasonic<br>
sensors 23, and a mounting structure 24. The sensors 23 can verify that the level of the saline<br>
solution 18 in each package 12 is above a predetermined level. The sensors 23 can thereby<br>
act as a secondary check that saline solution 18 has been added to each package 12 on a<br>
particular pallet 21. If desired, the PLC 30 can be programmed to prevent this check from being<br>
conducted on packages 12 designated as rejects during the initial fill check conducted by the<br>
PLC 30.<br>
[0028]                As shown in Figures 1-3, the sensors 23 are mounted on a plate member 27 of<br>
the mounting structure 24. The sensors 23, when mounted on the plate member 27, form an<br>
array 29. As in Figures 2 and 3, the sensors 23 can be mounted using, for example, nuts 31<br>
having threads that engage complementary threads formed on a housing 108 of associated<br>
sensor 23.<br>
[0029]                The system 10 can include, for example, ten of the sensors 23 arranged in two<br>
rows of five, so that the respective levels of saline solution 18 in ten of the packages 12 can be<br>
measured simultaneously. The use ten sensors 23 in the array 29 is described for exemplary<br>
purposes only. The principles of the present invention can be applied to a single sensor and to<br>
sensor arrays having more or less than ten sensors.<br>
[0030]                The conveyor 22 moves the pallet 21 to a position beneath the array 29 of<br>
sensors 23, after the cups 16 have been filled at the pump station 26 (see Figures 1 and 9).<br>
The sensors 23 are arranged on the plate member 27 so that each sensor 23 can align with an<br>
associated package 12 when the pallet 21 is positioned underneath the array 29. In a<br>
representative example, the center to center spacing between adjacent sensors 23 in the same<br>
row is approximately 30.00 mm (1.181 inches) and the center to center spacing between the<br>
5<br>
WO 2007/044847                                                                                                 PCT/US2006/039849<br>
two rows can be approximately 50.00 mm (1.969 inches) to substantially match the spacing of<br>
the packages 12 on the pallet 21.<br>
[0031]                The mounting structure 24 supports the bracket member 27 and the array 29 of<br>
sensors 23 above the pallet 21. As discussed below, the position of the bracket member 27<br>
can be adjusted in relation to the pallet 21 so that the sensors 23 can be optimally positioned in<br>
relation to the corresponding packages 12.<br>
[0032]                As shown in Figures 1-4, the mounting structure 24 preferably includes two<br>
bracket assemblies 50, and two base members 52. Each bracket assembly 50 can include a<br>
substantially L-shaped lower bracket 54 that is secured to an associated base member 52 by a<br>
suitable means such as fasteners 56. The fasteners 56 can be accommodated by slots 58<br>
formed in each lower bracket 54. As shown in Figure 3, the slots 58 extend in a first direction<br>
substantially perpendicular to the lengthwise direction of the plate member 27. This feature<br>
permits the positions of the sensors 23 in relation to the pallet 21 (and the packages 12) to be<br>
adjusted in the first direction.<br>
[0033]                The mounting structure 24 further includes two substantially L-shaped upper<br>
brackets 60. Each upper bracket 60 is secured to a corresponding lower bracket 54 by a<br>
suitable means such as fasteners 56 similar or substantially identical to the fasteners 56 used to<br>
secure the lower bracket 54 secured to the base members 52. Each lower bracket 54 has slots<br>
62 formed therein, proximate an upper end thereof, to accommodate these fasteners 56 (see<br>
Figures 1,4, and 9). The slots 62 each extend in a second direction coinciding substantially<br>
with the vertical direction (from the perspective of Figure 4). This feature permits the positions<br>
of the upper brackets 60 (and the plate member 27 and sensors 23) to be adjusted in relation to<br>
the pallet 21 in the second (vertical) direction.<br>
[0034]                Each upper bracket 60 is secured to a corresponding end of the plate member<br>
27 by a suitable means such as fasteners 56 similar or substantially identical to the fasteners 56<br>
used to secure the lower bracket 54 secured to the base members 52. As shown in Figures 1<br>
and 3, the plate member 27 has slots 66 formed therein to accommodate the associated<br>
fasteners 56. The slots 66 each extend in a third direction coinciding substantially with the<br>
lengthwise direction of the plate member 27. This feature permits the positions of the sensors<br>
23 in relation to the pallet 21 to be adjusted in the third direction.<br>

[0035]                As shown in Figure 10, each sensor 23 can include a vibrating element 100,<br>
and a processor 102, such as a microprocessor, communicatively coupled to the vibrating ,<br>
element 100. The vibrating element 100 and the processor 102 can be mounted within the<br>
housing 108 of the sensor 23. The housing 108 can be, for example, a barrel-type housing.<br>
Power and signals can be transmitted to and from the sensors 23 by way of cabling 109 and a<br>
connector 111 associated with each sensor 23. (The cabling 109 and connectors 111<br>
associated with several of the sensors 23 are not shown in Figures 2 and 3, for clarity.)<br>
[0036]                The sensor 23 transmits and receives acoustic energy. In particular, the<br>
vibrating element 100 of the sensor 23 can generate pulses or bursts of acoustic energy of a<br>
predetermined frequency, e.g., 500 kHz. The vibrating element 100 can be, for example, a<br>
piezoelectric crystal that vibrates at a predetermined frequency in response to the application of<br>
an electric current thereto. The acoustic energy, upon striking an object within the operating<br>
distance of the sensor 23, generates a return reflection, or pulse echo. The return reflection,<br>
upon reaching the vibrating element 100, causes the vibrating element 100 to vibrate and<br>
generate an electrical output.<br>
[0037]                The processor 102 can be programmed to calculate the presence of an object<br>
within the operating distance of the sensor 23. In particular, the processor 102 can be<br>
programmed with a time clock that registers the elapsed time between the transmission of the<br>
pulse of acoustic energy and the reception of the return reflection by the vibrating element 100<br>
(as registered by the electrical output of the vibrating element 100).<br>
[0038]                The processor 102 can be programmed to calculate the distance between the<br>
sensor 23 and a target object based on the local speed of sound and the elapsed time between<br>
the transmission of the acoustic energy and the reception of the return reflection. The<br>
processor 102 can also be programmed to generate an output only when the target object, i.e.,<br>
the meniscus 19 of the saline solution 18 in the cup 16, is determined to be within the operating<br>
distance of the sensor 23.<br>
[0039]                Specified details of the sensor 23 are presented for exemplary purposes only.<br>
Other types of ultrasonic sensors, including ultrasonic sensors in which the generation of the<br>
acoustic energy and the reception of the return reflection are performed by separate elements,<br>

WO 2007/044847                                                                                                PCT/US2006/039849<br>
claims, is intended to include devices in which the generation of the acoustic energy and the<br>
reception of the return reflection are performed by one element, by separate elements disposed<br>
in a common housing, and by separate elements not disposed in a common housing.<br>
[0040]                The sensors 23 are arranged in Figure 1 on the plate member 27 so that each<br>
sensor 23 substantially aligns with the cup 16 of a corresponding one of the packages 12, and<br>
the pulses of acoustic energy generated by the sensor 23 are directed toward the cup 16. The<br>
pulses of acoustic energy impinge upon the meniscus 19 of the saline solution 18 in the cup 16<br>
if the saline solution 18 is present, thereby generating a return reflection.<br>
[0041]                As noted above, the processor 102 of each sensor 23 can determine whether<br>
the distance between the sensor 23 and the meniscus 19 of the saline solution 18 in the<br>
associated cup 16 is within the operating distance of the sensor 23. If the distance between the<br>
sensor 23 and the meniscus 19 is within the operating distance of the sensor 23, the processor<br>
102 can generate an output that is transmitted to the PLC 30 by way of the cabling 109 and the<br>
connector 111 associated with the sensor 23. The PLC 30 can interpret this output as an<br>
indication that saline solution 18 is present in the cup 16 above a predetermined level.<br>
[0042]                The ability of the sensors 23 to generate an accurate and reliable indication of<br>
whether saline solution 18 is present in the cups 16 is dependent upon the spacing between the<br>
sensors 23 and the target, i.e., the meniscus 19 of the saline solution 18. The ability of the<br>
sensors 23 to detect the saline solution 18 in the cups 16 therefore can be optimized by<br>
positioning the sensors 23 at a particular vertical distance from the pallet 21. This distance is<br>
denoted by the reference character "D1" in Figure 2.<br>
[0043]                The distance D1 can adjusted by varying the vertical position of the plate<br>
member 27 on the mounting structure 24, in the above-discussed manner. For example, the<br>
vertical position of the plate member 27 can be adjusted so that the distance D1 is<br>
approximately 51.00 mm (2.008 inches). Applicants have found that spacing the sensors 23<br>
and the pallet 21 by this distance causes each sensor 23 to generate accurate, repeatable<br>
indications that the level of saline solution 18 in the corresponding cup 16 is (or is not) above<br>
the approximately half-full level.<br>
[0044]                The optimal value for the distance D1 is application dependent, and can vary<br>
with factors such as the specific sensors used as the sensors 23, the size and spacing of the<br>
8<br>
WO 2007/044847                                                                                              PCT/US2006/039849<br><br>
cups 16, and the ambient environmental conditions. A particular value for the distance D1 is<br>
presented for exemplary purposes only.<br>
[0045]                Each sensor 23 preferably has a beam width of approximately 10 mm (0.39<br>
inch) at the target distance, i.e., at a point approximately 51.00 mm (2.008 inches) from the<br>
bottom of the sensor 23. The optimal beam width can vary by application, with factors such as<br>
the target distance, the spacing between the sensors 23.<br>
[0046]                Ultrasonic sensors suitable for use in the present invention can be obtained, for<br>
example, from Hyde Park Electronics LLC, of Dayton, Ohio, as the SUPERPROX Model SM300<br>
series ultrasonic sensors. Cabling and connectors suitable for use as the cabling 109 and the<br>
connectors 111 can also be obtained, for example, from Hyde Park Electronics LLC, as the<br>
AC134 right-angle, 4-conductor, connector/cable assembly.<br>
[0047]                Each sensor 23 is preferably equipped with a tubular shroud 76. (For clarity,<br>
only one of the shrouds 76 is depicted in Figure 2.) The shroud 76 is secured to the end of the<br>
sensor 23 that faces the pallet 21. The shroud 76 can be attached to the sensor 23 by, for<br>
example, complementary threads formed on the shroud 76 and the sensor 23.<br>
[0048]                Each shroud 76 permits the pulses of acoustic energy and the return reflections<br>
generated by the associated sensor 23 to propagate between the sensor 23 and an associated<br>
package 12 on the pallet 21. The shroud 76 also substantially isolates, or shields the pulses<br>
and the return reflections from air currents that may be present between the sensor 23 and the<br>
package 12. As shown in Figures 5-7, each shroud 76 defines an axially-extending passage<br>
77. The passage 77 is in communication with the vibrating element 100 of the sensor 66, so<br>
that the pulses of acoustic energy and the return reflections can propagate between the<br>
vibrating element 100 and the associated package 12 by way of the passage 77. The passage<br>
77 preferably has a diameter approximately equal to the diameter of a lower end of the sensors<br>
23.<br>
[0049]                The shrouds 76 can potentially improve the functionality of the sensors 23. In<br>
particular, Applicants have found that the functionality of the sensors 23 can be adversely<br>
affected by air currents between the sensors 23 and the corresponding packages 21. Air<br>
currents that can adversely affect the functionality of the sensors 23 can be generated, for<br>
example, by the laminar airflow created inside the enclosure that may house the system 10, or<br>
9<br>
WO 2007/044847                                                                                       PCT/US2006/039849<br>
by clean air exhaust that may be generated by secondary equipment such as vacuum<br>
generators. The functionality of the sensors 23 can also be adversely affected by the air<br>
conditioning or heating systems of the facility in which the system 10 is installed, or by the<br>
movement of people or objects in the immediate vicinity of the system 10. It is believed that<br>
such air currents can alter the acoustic energy and the return reflections propagating from and<br>
to each sensor 23, thereby impeding the ability of the sensor 23 to accurately determine the<br>
distance between the sensor 23 and the saline solution 18 in the associated package 21.<br>
[0050]                Applicants have also found that reducing the sensitivity of the sensors 23 to air<br>
currents between the sensors 23 and the packages 12 may require placing the sensors 23 so<br>
close to the packages 12 that the functionality of the sensors 23 can be adversely affected.<br>
Placing the sensors 23 close enough to the packages 12 to substantially reduce the adverse<br>
effects of air currents can make the distance D1 less than that required for the sensors 23 to<br>
optimally detect the presence of saline solution 18 in the packages 12.<br>
[0051]                The shrouds 76 can substantially isolate the pulses of acoustic energy and the<br>
return echoes generated by the sensors 23 from air currents between the sensors 23 and the<br>
packages 12. The use of the shrouds 76 can thereby allow the sensors 23 to be placed at a<br>
sufficient distance D1 from the pallet 21 to facilitate optimal detection of the saline solution 18 in<br>
the cups 16 without introducing sensing errors due to air currents between the sensors 23 and<br>
the packages 12.<br>
[0052]                For example, each shroud 76 can be sized so that it extends approximately<br>
33.50 mm (1.319 inch) below the end of the sensor 23. This dimension is denoted by the<br>
reference character "D3" in Figure 2. Sizing the shroud 76 in this manner results in a gap of<br>
approximately 24.50 mm (0.9646 inch) between the bottom of the shroud 76 and the top of the<br>
pallet 21 when the distance D1 is approximately 51.00 mm. The gap between the bottom of the<br>
shroud 76 and the top of the pallet 21 is denoted by the reference character ("D2") in Figure 2.<br>
[0053]                The optimal value for the gap D2 is application dependent and can vary with<br>
factors such as the specific sensors used as the sensors 23, the magnitude and direction of the<br>
air currents between the sensors 23 and the pallet 21, and the ambient environment. A<br>
particular value for the gap D2 is presented for exemplary purposes only.<br>

WO 2007/044847                                                                                       PCT/US2006/039849<br>
[0054]                Applicants have also found that the sensors 23 can provide accurate and<br>
reliable indications of the levels of saline solution 18 in the cups 16 when bubbles are present in<br>
the meniscus 19. Bubbles commonly form in the meniscus 19 as the cups 16 are filled with the<br>
saline solution 18. The ability of the sensors 23 to detect the level of the saline solution 18 with<br>
bubbles present in the meniscus 19 is believed to represent a substantial advantage in relation<br>
to other types of sensors, such as photoelectric sensors, that may experience sensing errors<br>
due to the presence of bubbles. Sensing errors can occur in the presence of bubbles because<br>
the photoelectric sensor may interpret the top of one or more of the bubbles as the liquid level.<br>
Applicants have also found that the sensors 23 are less susceptible than photoelectric sensors<br>
to sensing errors caused by misalignment between the sensor and the target.<br>
