ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURING THE<br>
ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to electronic equipment equipped with a connector which is electrically connected to a device to be connected.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art<br>
An electronic control unit (ECU: Electronic Control Unit) of an electrical motor-driven type power steering device mounted in a vehicle as disclosed in JP-A-2000-203437 and JP-A-2003-267233 (patent documents 1 and 2) is known as electronic equipment equipped with a connector. This electronic control unit is connected to an electrical motor by a screw or the like, and they are electrically connected to each other through a connector. The electronic control unit controls the driving of the electrical motor so that steering assisting torque corresponding to a steering operation is produced in the steering shaft.<br>
In the patent document 1, an electrically conductive plate is subjected to insert molding using insulating resin to integrally form a housing and a connector, and the housing, a control board and a metal board are overlapped with one another and electrically connected to one another by soldering.<br><br>
The hosing and the respective boards are accommodated in a case, and the connector is projected from the case. In the patent document 2, a connector is fixed onto a case by a screw, and the terminal of the connector projecting into the case is electrically connected to the control board by soldering. A large current board is formed by subjecting an electrically conductive member to insert molding using insulating resin. The large current board, the control board and the metal board are overlapped with one another, electrically connected to one another by soldering and accommodated in the case.<br>
In the related art structure as shown in the patent document 1, the housing accommodated in the case and the connector exposed from the case are integral with each other. Therefore, when external force is applied to the connector because a partner connector is attached/detached to/from the connector or a foreign matter impinges against the connector, the external force is directly transferred from the connector to the housing, and stress is applied to the soldering-connection portions of the housing, the control board and the metal board, and thus there is a risk that the soldering is broken and the connection reliability is lowered. Furthermore, in the related art structure as shown in the patent document 2, the connector is fixed onto the case by the screw, and the terminal of the connector is connected to the control board in the case by soldering.  Therefore, when external force<br><br>
is applied to the connector because of a dimensional error among respective parts, an assembly error or the like, stress is applied to the soldering-connection portions of the terminal of the connector and the control board and resides, and also stress is applied to the soldering-connection portions of the control board, the large current board and the metal board and resides. Therefore, there is a risk that the soldering is broken with time lapse and the connection reliability is lowered. Furthermore, in the related art structures shown in the patent documents 1, 2, when external is applied to the connector due to the difference in thermal shrinkage characteristic among materials of respective parts, stress is applied to the soldering-connection portions of the housing, the board and the connector, and thus there is a risk that the soldering is broken and thus the connection reliability is lowered.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been implemented to solve the above problem, and has an object to provide electronic equipment and electronic equipment manufacturing method which can prevent lowering of connection reliability of soldering-connection portions.<br>
Electronic equipment according to the present invention comprises a connector for electrically connecting a device to be connected, a board to which the connector is electrically<br><br>
connected and which has a soldering-connection portion, a base that is overlapped with the board to support the board and the connector, and a case for fixing the connector while the connector is exposed from an opening portion thereof and fixing the board and the base while the board and the base are accommodated therein, wherein the base supports the connector through a flexible member.<br>
Accordingly, the connector is fixed to the case and it is supported through the flexible member by the base. Therefore, even when external force is applied to the connector due to the attachment/detachment of the partner connector to/from the connector or the impingement of foreign matters against the connector, the dimensional error or assembly error of the respective parts, the difference in thermal shrinkage characteristic among the materials of the respective parts or the like, the connector does not jounce (move) with respect to the case, the base and the board, and the external force is absorbed by the flexible member, so that the external force is not transferred to the base and the board. Therefore, stress with which soldering may be broken is not applied to the soldering connection portions of the connector and the board, and thus the connection reliability at the soldering connection portions can be prevented from being lowered.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, in the above electronic equipment, an electrically conductive<br><br>
metal piece constituting a terminal of the connector and a flexible metal piece constituting the flexible member are subjected to insert molding using insulating resin so that the connector and the base are formed integrally with each other,, and then the continuous insulating resin portion is cut out, whereby the connector and the base are connected to each other by only the flexible metal piece.<br>
In the above construction, the connector and the base are manufactured by the same mold at the same time, and thus the manufacturing cost can be reduced. Furthermore, it is unnecessary to assemble the connector to the base and thus the connector and the base can be assembled to the case and the board in a lump, so that the number of assembling steps of the electronic equipment can be reduced, and the assembling work can be facilitated.<br>
Furthermore, in the embodiment of the present invention, the flexible member has a bending portion in the electronic equipment.<br>
In the above construction, the effective length of the flexible member can be increased, and the external force applied to the connector can be surely absorbed by the flexible member. Furthermore, the width dimension of the flexible member which directs from the connector to the base is reduced to thereby reduce the interval between the connector and the base, so that the electronic equipment can be miniaturized.<br><br>
According to the embodiment of the present invention, in the above electronic equipment, the board comprises a first board that is supported while overlapped with the upper side of the base, and a second board that is supported while overlapped with the lower side of the base, the first board and the second board are electrically connected to each other by soldering, and the connector is electrically connected to at least one of the first board and the second board by soldering.<br>
In the above construction, the connector is fixed to the case, and supported through the flexible member by the base. Therefore, stress which may break soldering is not applied to the soldering connection portions of the connector and each board, and the connection reliability of the soldering connection portions can be prevented from being lowered.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing electronic equipment comprising a connector electrically-connected to a device to be connected, a board having a soldering-connection portion to which the connector is electrically connected, a base for supporting the board and the connector while overlapped with the board, and a case for fixing the connector while the connector is exposed from an opening portion thereof and fixing the board and the base while the board and the base are accommodated in the case, in which an electrically conductive metal piece constituting<br><br>
a terminal of the connector and a flexile metal piece are subjected to insert-molding using insulating resin so that the connector and the base are formed integrally with each other, and then a continuous resin portion is cut out.<br>
According to the above method, the connector and the base can be manufactured by the same mold at the same time, it is unnecessary to assemble the connector to the base, and the connector and the base can be assembled to the case and the board in a lump. Therefore, the manufacturing cost can be reduced, the number of assembling steps of the electronic equipment can be reduced, and the assembly work can be facilitated. Furthermore, even when external force is applied to the connector under the assembly state of the electronic equipment, the connector does not jounce and the external force is absorbed by the flexible member, so that no external force is transferred to the base and the board. Therefore, stress which may break soldering is not applied to the soldering connection portions of the connector, the board, etc. , and thus the reduction in connection reliability can be prevented.<br>
Furthermore, according to the embodiment of the present invention, in the electronic equipment manufacturing method, after the connector, the board and the base are fixed to the case, the connector and the board are electrically connected to each other by soldering.<br>
According to the above construction, external force<br><br>
applied to the connector due to the dimensional error or assembly error of the respective parts or the like can be absorbed by the flexible member, and it is prevented from being transferred to the base and the board. Therefore, the connector and the board can be connected to each other by soldering. Accordingly, stress caused by the external force is not applied to the soldering connection portions, and thus the soldering is not broken, so that the connection reliability of the soldering connection portions can be surely prevented from being lowered.<br>
According to the present invention, even when the external is applied to the connector, the connector does not jounce with respect to the case, the base and the board, and the external force is absorbed by the flexible member, so that no external force is transferred to the base and the board. Accordingly, stress which may break soldering is not applied to the soldering connection portions of the connector, the board, etc., and the connection reliability of the soldering connection portions can be prevented from being lowered.<br>

Then, screws 22 are made to penetrate through holes 6h formed in the base 6, and threadably mounted in screw holes 2h formed in the lower case 2, whereby the base 6 is fixed to the lower case 2 as shown in Fig. 10. Furthermore, screws 23 are made to penetrate through holes 5f formed in the connector 5, and threadably mounted in screw holes 2c formed in the lower case<br><br>
2,	thereby fixing the connector 5 to the lower case 2. The<br>
fixing of the connector 5 to the lower case 2 may be carried<br>
out before or after the base 6 is fixed to the lower case 2.<br>
Furthermore, the fixing of the connector 5 and the base 6 to<br>
the lower case 2 may be carried out at the same time with being<br>

formed in the control board 3, and are threadably mounted in nuts 14 inside of the cylinder 6c of the base 6, whereby the control board 3 is fixed to the base 6 and the lower case 2 as shown in Fig. 11. Accordingly, the control board 3 is kept to be supported by the base 6.<br>
Subsequently, the respective terminals 12c of the connectors 12a, 12b projecting from the through holes 3a of the control board 3 are electrically connected to the control board 3 by soldering, whereby the control board 3 and the power module board 4 are kept to be electrically connected to each other. Furthermore, the upper end portions 7e of the terminals 7a to 7c of the connector 5 projecting from the holes 3b of the control board 3 are electrically connected to the control board 3 by soldering. Subsequently, the connector 10 (omitted from the illustration in Fig. 11) on the control board 3 is engagedly fitted in an opening portion (not shown) of the upper case 1, thereby assembling the lower case 2 and the upper case 1 as shown in Fig. 12. Accordingly, the boards 3, 4 and the base 6 are accommodated in the cases 1, 2 and the connectors 5, 10 are projected from the outside of the cases 1, 2, thereby completing the assembly of the electronic equipment 100.<br>
When the electronic equipment 100 and the electric motor 90 are assembled with each other, motor terminals 92a to 92c of the electric motor 90 which project from the surface of the case 91 are inserted into the recesses 5c of the connector 5<br><br>
of the electronic equipment 100, and the lower case 2 is mounted on the case 91. Then, the screws 25 are made to penetrate through holes 92d formed in the motor terminals 92a to 92c and holes 7g formed in the terminals 7a to 7c of the connector 5, and threadably mounted in the nuts 13 (see Fig. 8B^ etc.) in the holes 5d of the connector 5, whereby the motor terminals 92a to 92c and the terminals 7a to 7c are brought into close contact with one another. As a result, the electronic equipment 100 and the electric motor 90 are kept to be electrically connected to each other. Furthermore, screws 26 are made to penetrate through holes 2 j formed in the lower case 2, and threadably mounted in screw holes 91 j formed in the case 91, whereby the cases 91, 92 are brought into close contact with each other. As a result, the electronic equipment 100 and the electric motor 90 are kept to be connected and fixed to each other.<br>
According to the foregoing description, the connector 5 is fixed to the lower case 2, and the connector 5 is supported through the beam 8 of the flexible metal piece by the base 6. Therefore, even when external force is applied to the connector 5 due to the attachment/detachment of the motor terminals 92a to 92c to/from the connector 5, the impingement of foreign matters to the connector 5, the dimensional error or assembly error of the respective parts, the difference in thermal shrinkage characteristic among the respective parts or the like,<br><br>
the connector 5 does not jounce (move) with respect to the cases 1, 2, the base 6 and the boards 3, 4, and the external force is absorbed by the beam 8, so that no external force is transmitted to the base 6 and the boards 3, 4. Therefore, stress which may break soldering is not applied to the soldering connection portions of the connector 5 and the boards 3, 4, and thus the connection reliability of the soldering connection portions can be prevented from being lowered.<br>
Furthermore, the connector 5 and the base 6 are formed at the same time in the same insert-molding metal molds 31,. 32 by insert molding, so that the manufacturing cost can be reduced. The connector 5 and the base 6 are connected to each other through the beam 8, so that it is unnecessary to carry out the work of assembling the connector 5 to the base 6 and the connector 5 and the base 6 can be assembled to the case 2 and the boards 3, 4 in a lump. Therefore, the number of assembling steps of the electronic equipment 100 can be reduced, and the assembling work can be facilitated.<br>
Furthermore, by providing the bending portions 8a to the beam 8, the effective length of the beam 8 by which the beam 8 can sag (the length of the portion of the beam 8 which is exposed from the connector 5 and the base 6, that is, the spring length of the beam 8) can be increased, and the external force applied to the connector 5 can be surely absorbed by the beam 8.  In addition, the width dimension W in the direction from<br><br>
the connector 5 of the beam 8 shown in Fig. 7B to the base 6 is reduced, and the interval S between the connector 5 and the base 6 is narrowed, so that the electronic equipment 100 can be miniaturized.<br>
Still furthermore, after the power module board 4, the base 6 and the connector 5 are fixed to the lower case 2, the terminals 7a to 7c of the connector 5, the terminals 11a to llf of the power module board 4 and the terminals 9d to 9f of the base 6 are connected to one another by spot welding. Therefore, after external force applied to the connector 5 due to the dimensional error or the assembly error of the respective parts is absorbed by the beam 8 so that no external force is transferred to the base 6 and the power module board 4, the power module board 4, the base 6 and the connector 5 can be stably connected to one another. Furthermore, after the control board 3 is fixed to the base 6 subsequently to the power module board 4, the base 6 and the connector 5, the terminals 7a to 7c of the connectors 5, 12 and the control board 3 are electrically connected to each other by soldering. Therefore, after the external force applied to the connector 5 due to the dimensional error or assembly error of the respective parts is absorbed by the beam 8 so that no external force is transferred to the base 6 and the power module board 4, the connectors 5, 12 and the control board 3 can be stably connected to each other by soldering.  Therefore, the stress caused by<br><br>
the external force is not applied to the soldering connection portions, and thus the soldering is not broken, so that the connection reliability of the soldering connection portions can be surely prevented from being lowered.<br>
The present invention may adopt various embodiments other than the above-described embodiment. For example, in the above embodiment, the connector 5 is supported by the base 6 through the metal beam 8 which is insert-molded to the insulating resin of the connector 5 and the base 6. However, the present invention is not limited to the above embodiment. For example, a separate metal leaf spring, rubber or the like may be secured to the connector and the base so that the connector is supported by the base through the leaf spring, rubber or the like. Furthermore, a hinge portion may be formed of insulating resin between the connector and the base in the molding process of the connector and the base so that the connector is supported by the base through the hinge portion. That is, the material of the flexible member of the present invention is not limited to metal insofar as it can absorb external force applied to the connector so that no external force is transferred to the base, the boards, etc.<br>
