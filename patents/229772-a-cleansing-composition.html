DESCRIPTION<br>
CLEANSING COMPOSITION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a cleansing composition comprising, as essential components, a sulfate type anionic surfactant, N-acyl-α-alanine or a salt thereof, and one or more kinds of compounds selected from an amphoteric surfactant, a cationic polymer, a silicone compound and an oily material.  More particularly, the present invention relates to a cleansing composition for skin and/or hair, which gives lather quickly during cleansing, is superior in lather amount, spreading of lather and lather retention, free of a residual feeling or a frictional feeling on the skin or hair during rinsing, and gives, after drying, a moist feeling and a clarifying feeling after use to the skin and a moist feeling and simultaneous softness and lightness to the hair.<br>
Background Art Conventionally, cleansing agents (cleansing compositions) for skin and/or hair comprising anionic surfactants represented by alkylsulfuric ester salt, polyoxyethylene alkyl ether sulfate and higher fatty acid soap, and betaine type amphoteric surfactants as main cleansing components (cleanser ingredients) have been used due to their high lather amount and high cleansing performance.  However, such cleansing agents (cleansing compositions) are defective in that they give a residual feeling as well as a frictional feeling to the skin during rinsing, and a dried-out feeling to the skin after drying. In addition, they are defective in that they give a residual feeling as well as a frictional feeling to the hair during rinsing, and a dried-out feeling and unruly hair after drying, and the like.<br>
For reducing friction during rinsing, antistatic<br><br>
effect and the like, cationic polymer conditioners such as cationic cellulose have been used for liquid cleansing agents (cleansing compositions) for skin and/or hair.  However, when contained in a large amount to afford a sufficient effect, cationic cellulose degrades lather quality, and problematically leaves a residual feeling during rinsing and after drying.<br>
Silicone compounds have been used in shampoo to give glossy hair, smooth hair and the like.  However, when contained in large amounts to afford a sufficient effect, silicone compounds problematically degrade lather quality and water rinsing performance during cleansing, and leave a dried-out feeling of the hair after drying and make hair spread.<br>
While various fats and oils are used for cleansing agents (cleansing composition) to give a moist feeling to the skin and/or hair, particularly after drying, they are mostly washed away during cleansing and it is difficult to give a moist feeling to the skin and/or hair after drying.  When contained in large amounts to afford a sufficient effect, fats and oils problematically degrade lather quality.<br>
While glycerol, propylene glycol, sodium lactate and the like are known as moisturizers, cleansing compositions simply combining these moisturizers with cleansing agents cannot sufficiently improve a moist feeling of the skin and/or hair.<br>
JP-A-09-506351 discloses a cleansing composition containing polyoxyethylene alkyl ether sulfate, an amphoteric surfactant, N-acylsarcosinate and cationic cellulose. However, this cleansing composition is associated with problems in that a residual feeling remains during rinsing of the skin and/or hair, and a moist feeling cannot be obtained after drying.  Furthermore, USP5866110 and USP5908617 disclose cleansing compositions obtained by adding a higher<br><br>
pilcohol to the above-mentioned composition disclosed in JP-A-09-506351.  However, the composition is associated with problems in that a residual feeling during rinsing is not improved, a moist feeling after drying is improved somewhat but a clarifying feeling is inferior, and softness and lightness of hair is difficult to achieve.<br>
JP-A-11-189515 and JP-A-11-29446 disclose shampoo compositions containing polyoxyethylene alkyl ether sulfate, an amphoteric surfactant, a compound selected from N-acylsarcosinate, N-acyl-N-methyl-β—alanine salt, N-acyl glutamate salt and the like, and methylpolysiloxane. However, this composition is associated with a problem in that it is inferior in a frictional feeling of hair during rinsing, and softness and lightness of hair after drying.<br>
In view of the above-mentioned situation, the present invention aims at providing a cleansing composition for skin and/or hair, which gives lather quickly during cleansing, is superior in lather amount, spreading of lather and lather retention, free of a residual feeling or a frictional feeling on the skin or hair during rinsing, and gives, after drying, a moist feeling and a clarifying feeling after use to the skin and a moist feeling and simultaneous softness and lightness to the hair.<br>

Exasqples The present invention is explained in more detail in the following by referring to Exarrples and Comparative Exairples, which are not to be construed as limitative. Production Example 1 (synthesis of N-cocoyl-L-alanine sodium salt)<br>
Water (167 g) was added to L-alanine (30.0 g), and cocoyl chloride (7 3.68 g) and 27 wt% aqueous NaOH solution were simultaneously added dropwise over 1 hr with stirring while maintaining pH of 10.9 8 - 11.02 and reaction temperature of 33 - 37"^^C.  After aging for 1 hr, the reaction mixture was heated and 75 wt% sulfuric acid was added to adjust the pH to 2.0.  The mixture was further heated to 80°C, stirred for about 10 min and stood still for 10 min to allow partitioning into an organic layer and an aqueous layer.  The aqueous layer (about 200 g) was removed from the bottom part of a container.  Hot water was added to the<br><br>
remaining organic layer, and the mixture was heated again to 80°C, stirred for about 10 min and stood still for 10 min. The partitioned aqueous layer was removed to give an organic layer.  A 27% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution and water were added to the organic layer to adjust the pH to 6.8, whereby an object product (N-cocoyl-L-alanine sodium salt) was obtained.<br>
Production Exanple 2 (synthesis of N-cocoyl-DL-alanine sodium salt)<br>
In the same manner as in the above-mentioned Production Example 1 except that DL-alanine was used instead of L-alanine, object product (N-cocoyl-DL-alanine sodium salt) was obtained.<br>
