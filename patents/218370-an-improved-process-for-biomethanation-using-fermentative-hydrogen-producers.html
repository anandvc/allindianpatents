				<td>The present invention relates to a process for propation of biogen using fermentative hydrogen producers.<br><br>
The main utility of present invention is to provide an effective method to overcome the problem of process instability during both start-up and operation of biomethanation. The present invention makes use of fermentative hydrogen producers to improve biomethanation process.<br>
Anaerobic treatment process is increasingly recognized as the core method of an advanced technology for environmental protection and resource preservation. (L. Seghezzo, G. Zeeman, J.B. van Lier, H.V.M. Hamelers and G. Lettinga, Bioresource Technology, 65: 175; 1998). It becomes imperative to look for renewable energy sources due to increased environmental problems like Global warming and rapidly depleting fossil fuel reserves. (A. Hansel and P. Lindblad, Applied Microbiol. and Biotechnology, 50: 153; 1998). Anaerobic digestion has been applied to derive energy from different wastes (I.J.Callander and J.P.Barford, Process Biochem., 18(8): 24;1996). Anaerobic digestion is a process by which most organic wastes (except lignocellulosic content rich waste) can be biologically converted into energy rich methane gas. This complex process, therefore requires specific environmental conditions and various bacterial populations (N. Sharma and G.Pellizzi, Energy Convers. Mgmt., 32 (5): 447:1991).<br>
The National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) Fruit and Vegetable Unit, Mangolpuri, New Delhi, INDIA, alone generates about 8000-10000 tonnes of green pea-shells annually. These waste are till now sent to landfills but in recent years their disposal has become a problem, due to increasing cost of transportation and scarcity of landfill sites for quick disposal. (V.C.Kalia and A.P.Joshi, Bioresource Technology, 53:165;1995; S.K.Madhukar, H.R.Srilatha, K. Srinath, K.Bharthi and K.Nand, Process Biochem., 32(6):509;1997).<br>
The major limitations encountered in anaerobic digestion of biological wastes is due to high organic matter over loading into the digester. Under these conditions, accumulation of higher volatile fatty acids results in physiological stress on microbial population and consequent digester failure. (D.T.Hill and J.P. Bolte, Transactions of the ASAE 30(2):502: 1987; D.T.Hill, S.A.Cobb and J.P.Bolte, Transactions of the ASAE 30(2): 496; 1987; B.K.Ahring &amp; P.Westermann, Appl. Environ. Microbiol., 53(2): 434; 1987).<br>
Methane production during anaerobic digestion is preceded by hydrogen production, which serves as substrate for the former. However, thermodynamically methane production is favoured, no net evolution of hydrogen is observed in these syntrophic populations. (W.Verstraete, D. de Beer, M. Pena, G. Lettinga and P.Lens, World J. Microbiol. and Biotechnol., 12: 221; 1996).<br>
Hydrogen producers have a very active role to play in this metabolism. H2 has<br>
the potential for feed back control of acidogenic reaction. (I.S.Kim, J.C.Young and H.H.Tabak, Water Environment Research, 66 (3) : 119; 1994). It thus becomes another limitation for active methanogenesis leading to stress conditions. Hydrogen is also quenched by other bacteria like nitrate reducers, sulphate reducers, etc. (A.Visser, Y.Gao and G. Lettinga, Bioresource Technology, 44: 113; 1993). Thirty per cent of the total methane production is<br>
due to H2 and CO2 combination while the rest is via acetic acid route.  Normally,<br>
propionate and butyrate accounts for 20% of total methane produced in the digester (P. Fongastitkul, D.S.Mavinic and K.V. Lo, Water Environ. Research, 66 (3): 243; 1994) but under stress conditions there is an accumulation of these<br>
acids. Consequently, there is excess of H2 generation resulting in digester<br>
failure. (B.K.Ahring and P.Westermann, Applied Environ. Microbiol., 53 (2): 434; 1987).<br>
Till date some conventional process parameters employed for the improving biomethanation of bio-waste materials are briefly described below:<br>
For improving the biomethanation process efficiency, recycling of biogas through the digester or stirring of waste matter in digester was done (M.Hunziker and A.Schildknecht, U.S. Patent No. 4,511,370 dt Apr.16,1985, D.O.Hitzman, U.S.Patent No. 4,798,801 Dt Jan.17,1989, M.F.Peters and W.T.Peters, U.S. Patent No. 4,238,337 dt Dec.9,1980, D.W.Grabis, U.S. Patent No. 4,394,136 Dt Jul.19,1983). Another proposal to improve the waste handling and processing is to produce a mixture of hydrogen and methane under 2 stage process (J.Benemann, Nature Biotechnology, 14: 1101, 1996). However, fermentative hydrogen producers have not yet been employed to improve biomethanation.<br>
For increasing digestibility of such ligno-cellulosic wastes, various chemical and physical pre-treatments, e.g., acid and alkali treatment, high temperature exposure and selective microbial environment (R.K. Malik and P.Tauro, Indian J. Microbiol., 35 (3) :205; 1995; P.A.Scherer and R.Vollmer,1995. Patent No. DE-; DE 19516378; 26.10.95 Germany), have added only to higher energy inputs and reduced process efficiency. (A.Gupta and D.Madhukar, Biotechnology Prog., 13 :166;1997). However, we have recently shown bio-separation of ligno-cellulosic content from pea-shells by microbial action.<br>
The major limitations encountered in the various physical and chemical methods for improving biomethanation process efficiency are in terms of high energy input and environmental degradation. Among the physical methods, recycling of biogas through the digester and stirring of waste material in the digester add to the energy input of the over all treatment. It implies reduced process efficiency. Similarly, use of chemicals cause environmental degradation since the resultant effluent will have certain chemical nickel, iron, cobalt, etc. in excess. These trace elements on accumulation become toxic for other organisms. Ensiling to separate ligno-cellulosic content from wastes is time consuming as it can take up to 6 months to complete.<br>
In the present invention we have overcome the major limitations involved in the biomethanation process of bio wastes.<br>
The novelty of the present invention is in using fermentative hydrogen producers to improve biomethanation process. In the present invention, no toxic materials are added in the process. In the present invention, the microbes used grow easily under prevailing ambient conditions. The present invention overcomes the problems of process instability during start-up and operation of biomethanation.<br>
The main object of present invention is to provide a process for improved biomethanation using fermentative hydrogen producers, which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an effective method to overcome the problem of instability during both start-up and operation of biomethanation.<br>

Details of the invention:<br>
Source of the fermentative hydrogen producing bacteria, Bacillus licheniformis strain JK1 were isolated from actively fermenting apple pomace and Bacillus subtilis strain VC2 were isolated from damaged wheat grains, in our laboratory. Both the strains were identified by Microcheck, Inc. Microbial Analysis Laboratory, P.O. Box 456. Northfield, Vermont 05663, U.S.A. Bacillus licheniformis strain JK1 grows well on nutrient agar medium and also on medium specific for Desulfovibrio species at pH 7.0 at 37-40°C. It turns red on Desulfovibrio specific medium. It can also grow at 55°C and in medium containing 7% sodium chloride. Strain JK1 colonies on agar plate have irregular margins, rugose surface, thick density, and pink coloured. Strain JK1 cells are Gram positive, small rods and endospore forming. It can grow and produce acids from glucose, mannitol, xylose, arabinose, cellobiose, fructose and ribose. It can utilize citrate and is able to hydrolyse starch, casein and not urea. It shows catalase and oxidase activities. Strain JK1 evolves 1.4 mole biogas-H / mole glucose consumed and<br>
0.68 mole H2 / mole glucose consumed.  Bacillus subtilis strain VC2 grows well<br>
on nutrient agar medium and also on medium specific for Desulfovibrio species at pH 7.0 at 37-40°C. It can also grow at 55°C and in medium containing 5% sodium chloride.. Strain VC2 colonies on agar plate are circular, medium sized, translucent and cream coloured. Strain VC2 cells are Gram positive, motile rods and mostly single. It grows also on McCarty agar but cannot utilize citrate and is unable to hydrolyse starch, casein and urea. It shows catalase and oxidase activities. Strain VC2 evolves1.8 mole biogas-H / mole glucose consumed and<br>
0.98 mole H2 / mole glucose consumed. The isolates have ability to produce<br>
hydrogen from biological wastes as well. The strains were maintained on nutrient agar plates. These strains have been deposited at CBT, a constitutive laboratory of CSIR (India) and have been given accession numbers CBT-JK1 and CBT-VC2. The biological waste material was allowed to undergo fermentation in step (iii) at pH 7 for 2 to 3 days at 37 to 40°C. A small amount of the actively fermenting slurry was streaked on nutrient agar medium and incubated for 24 h at 37 to 40°C.<br>
In the present invention, anaerobic digestion of pea-shells was done in a two stage process. The various plant tissues contain complex organic molecules. The complete degradation of the organic matter is a multi-step process. A syntrophic bacterial consortia is required for effective biodegradation. Hydrolysis of feed into simple monomeric compounds and acidogenesis i.e. production of volatile fatty acids is done in microaerophillic conditions, where fermentative bacteria digested the soft tissues of the pea-shells. The acidified material under anaerobic conditions are acted upon by hydrogen producers. A wide range of food (feed) to microbe ratio are tested by making slurries at different organic solid concentrations. pH adjustment to neutral level is done regularly after each hydrogen evolution cycle of 24 h. Hydrogen producers can convert a portion of the available organic matter in the waste material, the rest of the unutilised organic matter is quite suitable as food for methanogens. Although pH is maintained near neutral by the microbial populations however, it may be adjusted to around 7 invariably only once in the beginning of this incubation period. The partially digested feed is then subjected to biomethanation under anaerobic conditions. At very high organic matter load bacterial population become stressed and their metabolism shifts to production and accumulation of higher fatty acids. There is also an increase in partial pressure of hydrogen gas<br>
inside the system. It lead to digester failure. Fermentative hydrogen producers<br>
can be employed to relieve the acetogens and methanogens of impeding hydrogen stress by selectively producing hydrogen. With reduced partial pressure of hydrogen in the system, there is improvement in methanogenic bacterial activity and consequently in the overall process as well.<br>
The invention has been described here in below with examples which are illustrative only and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention in any manner.<br>

of acidogenic  PSS     was  inoculated  with   5  ml  of  H2-producers  Bacillus<br>
licheniformis strain JK1  and was incubated for 3 - 4 days to observe H2<br>
production. 25 ml of enriched methanogens in 9:1 ratio (v/v, 10% cattle dung slurry, CDS) were added and incubated under fermentative conditions for 45 days at 42°C, at pH 6.8.
