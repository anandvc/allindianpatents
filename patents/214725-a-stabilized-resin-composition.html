				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a stabilized resin composition and pertains to resin compositions containing a stabilizer or mixture of stabilizers selected from the group consisting of the phenolic antioxidants, the 3-arylbenzofuranones, the hindered amine stabilizers, the ultraviolet light absorbers, the organic phosphorus compounds, the alkaline metal salts of fatty acids, the hydroxylamines, and the thiosynergists, which are stabilized against degradation and/ or discoloration by an effective amount of a tertiary amine oxide.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Although various antioxidants have long been known to be effective stabilizers for polymeric resins and have enjoyed wide commercial Success for that use, these same stabilized polymeric resin compositions continue to discolor upon heating at elevated temperatures for prolonged periods or upon exposure to the combustion products of natural gas.<br>
While the addition of organic phosphites to such resin compositions stabilized with phenolic antioxidants tends to reduce the discoloration, it remains a serious practical problem.<br>
Likewise polymeric resin compositions containing certain phenolic antioxidants and hindered amine stabilizers tend to discolor upon storage for extended periods even at ambient temperatures.<br>
The organic hydroxylamine compounds, such as those found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,644,278 and 3,778,464, have also been used as antioxidant stabilizers for hydrocarbons including polyolefins. The use of the hydroxylamines in polyolefins in combination with a phenolic antioxidant or<br><br>
in combination with an organic phosphorus compound, an ultraviolet light absorber, a thiosynergist, or a hindered amine stabilizer with the resulting resistance to degradation and/or discoloration is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,590,231. Although such stabilized polyolefin compositions are improved, there continues to exist a need and desire to provide polymeric resin compositions which exhibit enhanced levels of stability and to provide alternate stabilizer compositions for incorporation into polymer compositions.<br>
The tertiary amine oxides are widely used commercially as organic surfactants. Such surfactants have properties that make them very useful in shampoos, hair conditioners, dish and laundry detergents, fabric softeners and the like. The use of tertiary amine oxides until this time as stabilizer additives for polymeric resins, however, is believe to be novel, especially when used in combination with other additives.

Other combinations are also envisioned in the present invention.<br>
The amine oxide is preferably a tertiary amine oxide as represented by general formula (I):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1 and R2 are independently each a C6 to C36 residue that may optionally contain at least one -O-, -S-, -SO-, -CO2-, -CO-, or -CON- moiety; and R3 is a Ci to Cae residue that may also optionally and independently contain at least one -O-, -S-, -SO-, -CO2-, -CO-, or -CON- moiety. Included in the residues for R1, R2, and R3 are benzyl and substituted benzyl residues. It is also possible for each of R1, R2, and R3 to be the same residue. R1 and R2 are preferably C8 to C26 residues and most preferably C10 to C26 residues and R3 is preferably C1 to C22 residues and most preferably a C1 residue (e.g., methyl) . Also, preferred amine oxides include those wherein R1, R2, and R3 are the same C6 to C36 residues. Preferably, all of the aforementioned residues for R1, R2, and R3 are saturated hydrocarbon residues or saturated hydrocarbon residues containing at least one of the aforementioned -O-, -S-, -SO-, -CO2-, -CO-, or -CON- moieties. Those skilled in the art will be able to envision other useful residues for each of R1, R2, and R3 without detracting from the present invention.<br>
The amine oxide of the present invention also includes poly(amine oxides). By poly(amine oxide) is meant tertiary amine oxides containing at least two tertiary amine oxides per molecule. Illustrative poly(amine oxides) (also called "poly(tertiary amine oxides)") include the tertiary amine oxide analogues of aliphatic and alicyclic diamines such as, for example, 1,4-diaminobutane; 1,6-diaminohexane; 1,10-diaminodecane; and 1,4-diaminocyclohexane, and aromatic based diamines such as, for example, diamino anthraquinones and diaminoanisoles. Also included are tertiary amine oxides derived from oligomers and polymers of the aforementioned diamines. Useful amine oxides also include amine oxides attached to polymers, for example, polyolefins, polyacrylates, polyesters, polyamides,<br>
polystyrenes, and the like. When the amine oxide is attached to a polymer, the average number of amine oxides per polymer can vary widely as not all polymer chains need to contain an amine oxide. Generally a useful number of amine oxide moieties in the overall thermoplastic resin is between about 0.001 weight percent and about 5 weight percent, based on the weight of the entire thermoplastic composition. All of the aforementioned amine oxides may optionally contain at least one -O-, -S-, -SO-, -CO2-, -CO-, or -CON- moiety. In a preferred embodiment, each tertiary amine oxide of the polymeric tertiary amine oxide contains a C1 residue.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the amine oxide is attached to a molecule containing a hindered amine. Hindered amines are known in the art and the amine oxide of the present invention may be attached to the hindered amine in any manner and structural position of the hindered amine. Useful hindered amines in the present invention include those of the general formulas (II) and (III):<br><br>
(Formula Removed) <br><br><br>
wherein K is a carbon chain containing the amine oxide (or amine oxides), Y is a C1-30 alkyl moiety, a -C(O)R moiety wherein R is a C1-30alkyl group, or a -OR moiety wherein R is a C1-30 alkyl group, and each R4 is independently a C1-30 alkyl group, preferably a methyl group. Also included are amine oxides containing more than one hindered amine and more than one amine oxide per molecule. The hindered amine may be attached to a poly(tertiary amine oxide) or attached to a polymeric substrate, as discussed above.<br>
Amine oxides and processes for making thereof are set out in Richard J. Nadolsky Amine Oxides Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Vol. 2, pages<br><br>
259-271, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. (1978), which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Also included in the present invention are thermal reaction products of tertiary amine oxides. Under elevated temperatures, e.g., such as those useful to prepare the thermoplastic compositions of the present invention, amine oxides including those illustrated by Formula I are belieyed to undergo various reactions. Some of these reactions are believed to result in the formation of various thermal reaction products, for example, hydroxyl amines and olefinic species. Although the mechanism for the stabilization of various resins with the tertiary amine oxides is presently unknown, it is believed that various reactive intermediates along the reaction pathways may play a role in the stabilization effect.<br>
Amine oxide reaction products containing at least one long chain carbon residue are preferred in order to increase the solubility of the reaction products, including the hydroxyl amine-type reaction products, with the thermoplastic resin. When only a single alkyl substituent (i.e., only one of R1, R2, and R3) in the tertiary amine oxide is a Ce to Cse residue and the other two alkyl substituents are C1-5 residues, some of the hydroxyl amine-type reaction products are believed to contain only short chain substituents (i.e., C1-5 residues). It is believed that this is a result of some of the long chain residues being eliminated from the amine oxide as an olefinic by-product. In order to insure that at least one long chain is retained in the hydroxyl amine-type thermal reaction products, either all three substituents should preferably be long chain or one chain can be C1 (e.g., methyl) and the other two substituents be long chain (e.g., C6 to C36 residues). When one substituent is a C1 residue and the other two substituents are long chain residues (including polymeric residues as previously described), the resultant thermal reaction product will be asymmetrical and contain a C1 residue and a long chain residue. By long chain carbon residue is meant from C6 to about C36, preferably from C8 to C26<br><br>
and most preferably C10to C22. Also included by long chain residue are the before mentioned polymeric amine oxide residues. The long chain carbon residue may also optionally contain at least one of the before mentioned -O-, -S-, -SO-, -CO2-, -CO-, or -CON- moieties described for R1, R2, and R3. Hydroxyl amines-type reaction products that do not contain the aforementioned long chain residue tend to migrate out of the thermoplastic resin and can bloom to the surface of the thermoplastic resin or coat the surface of the processing equipment requiring costly downtime for cleaning and maintenance. It should be clear from the foregoing that the present invention includes hydroxyl amines containing at least one long chain carbon residue, preferably asymmetrical hydroxyl amines containing a long chain and a short chain; and also include polymeric hydroxyl amines containing at least two hydroxyl amines per molecule.<br>
Especially preferred amine oxides for use in the present invention are saturated amine oxides and include dioctyl methyl amine oxide, trioctyl amine oxide, didecyl methyl amine oxide, tridecyl amine oxide, di(coco alkyl) methyl amine oxide, tri(coco alkyl) amine oxide, di(tallow alkyl) methyl amine oxide, tri(tallow alkyl) amine oxide, tri(C2o-C22) amine oxide, and di(C2o-C22 alkyl) methyl amine oxide. Especially preferred hydroxyl amines are saturated hydroxyl amines and include octyl methyl hydroxyl amine, decyl methyl hydroxyl amine, (coco alkyl) methyl hydroxyl amine, (tallow alkyl) methyl hydroxyl amine, and (C20-C22 alkyl) methyl hydroxyl amine. By the term "coco alkyl" is meant hydrogenated C12-C14 alkyl commonly referred to as hydrogenated coconut oil. By the term "tallow alkyl" is meant hydrogenated C16-C18 alkyl commonly referred to as hydrogenated tallow oil. Hydrogenated tallow oil is described in U.S. Patent 4,876,300. The aforementioned hydrogenated coconut oil and hydrogenated tallow oil do contain some percentage of higher and/or lower carbon chain lengths than are described above and it should be understood that these other fractions are<br><br>
within the scope of the present invention. It is preferred that at least 75% of the carbon chains be within the described ranges for the coconut oil and tallow oil.<br>
The amine oxide and any reaction products thereof are preferably present in an amount effective to improve the melt stability and/ or the yellowness index of a thermoplastic composition. The amount is generally less than about 5 weight percent based on the weight of the thermoplastic<br>
resin, preferably less than about 1000 ppm based on the weight of the thermoplastic resin, and is even more preferably between about 950 ppm and about 5 ppm based on the weight of the thermoplastic resin.<br>
It should be clear that the present invention includes a thermoplastic resin composition comprising a thermoplastic resin, and an amine oxide present at a level of from 0.001 to 5 percent by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, wherein the amine oxide has the structural formula (I):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1, R2, and R3 are independently selected from alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkaryl, cycloalkyl, alkcycloalkyl and cycloalkalkyl and each have from 1 to 36 carbon atoms per group, provided that if one of R1, R2, and R3 is an alkyl group having from 6 to 36 carbon atoms per group, then the other two of R1, R2, and R3 cannot both be alkyl groups having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms per group. It should also be clear that the present invention includes a method for stabilizing a thermoplastic resin, said method comprising: admixing an amine oxide with the thermoplastic resin, said amine oxide having the structural formula (I):<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein R1, R2, and R3 are independently selected from alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkaryl, cycloalkyl, alkcycloalkyl and cycloalkalkyl and each have from 1 to 36 carbon atoms per group, provided that if one of R1, R2, and R3 is an alkyl group having from 6 to 36 carbon atoms per group, then the other two of R1, R2, and R3 cannot both be alkyl groups having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms per group.<br>
The thermoplastic resin, also referred to as a polymer, may be any thermoplastic known in the art, such as polyesters, polyurethanes, polyalkylene terephthalates, polyketones, polysulfones, polyimides, polyphenylene ethers, styrenic polymers, polycarbonates, acrylic polymers, polyamides, polyacetals, halide containing polymers and polyolefin homopolymers and copolymers. Mixtures of different polymers, such as polyphenylene ether/styrenic resin blends, polyvinyl chloride/ABS or other impact modified polymers, such as methacrylonitrile and a-methylstyrene containing ABS, and polyester/ABS or polycarbonate/ABS and polyester plus some other impact modifier may also be used. Such polymers are available commercially or may be made by means well known in the art. However, the hydrocarbon amine oxides and stabilizer compositions of the invention are particularly useful in thermoplastic polymers, such as polyolefins, polycarbonates, polyesters, polyphenylene ethers and styrenic polymers, due to the extreme temperatures at which thermoplastic polymers are often processed and/or used.<br>
Polymers of monoolefins and diolefins, for example polypropylene, polyisobutylene, polybutene-1, polymethylpentene-1, polyisoprene, or polybutadiene, as well as polymers of cycloolefins, for instance of cyclopentene or norbornene, polyethylene (which optionally can be crosslinked), for example high density polyethylene (HDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE) and linear<br><br>
low density polyethylene (LLDPE) may be used. Mixtures of these polymers,<br>
for example, mixtures of polypropylene with polyisobutylene, polypropylene<br>
with polyethylene (for example PP/HDPE, PP/LDPE) and mixtures of different<br>
types of polyethylene (for example LDPE/HDPE), may also be used. Also<br>
useful are copolymers of monoolefins and diolefines with each other or with<br>
other vinyl monomers, such as, for example, ethylene/propylene, LLDPE and<br>
its mixtures with LDPE, propylene/butene-1, ethylene/hexene,<br>
ethylene/ethylpentene,	ethylene/heptene,	ethylene/octene,<br>
propylene/isobutylene, ethylene/butane-1, propylene/butadiene, isobutylene, isoprene, ethylene/alkyl acrylates, ethylene/alkyl methacrylates, ethylene/vinyl acetate (EVA) or ethylene/acrylic acid copolymers (EAA) and their salts (ionomers) and terpolymers of ethylene with propylene and a diene, such as hexadiene, dicyclopentadiene or ethylidene-norbornene; as well as mixtures of such copolymers and their mixtures with polymers mentioned above, for example polypropylene/ethylene propylene-copolymers, LDPE/EVA, LDPE/EAA, LLDPE/EVA, and LLDPE/EAA.<br>
Thermoplastic polymers may also include styrenic polymers, such as<br>
polystyrene, poly-(p-methylstyrene), poly-(α-methylstyrene), copolymers of<br>
styrene or α-methylstyrene with dienes or acrylic derivatives, such as, for<br>
example, styrene/butadiene, styrene/acrylonitrile, styrene/alkyl methacrylate,<br>
styrene/maleic	anhydride,	styrene/butadiene/ethyl	acrylate,<br>
styrene/ aerylonitrile/methylacrylate, mixtures of high impact strength from styrene copolymers and another polymer, such as, for example, from a polyacrylate, a diene polymer or an ethylene/propylene/diene terpolymer; and block copolymers of styrene, such as, for example, styrene / butadiene / styrene, styrene / isoprene / styrene, styrene / ethylene / butylene / styrene or styrene/ethylene/propylene styrene. Styrenic polymers may additionally or alternatively include graft copolymers of styrene or a-methylstyrene such as, for example, styrene on polybutadiene, styrene on polybutadiene-styrene or<br><br>
polybutadiene-acrylonitrile; styrene and acrylonitrile (or methacrylonitrile) on polybutadiene and copolymers thereof; styrene and maleic anhydride or maleimide on polybutadiene; styrene, acrylonitrile and maleic anhydride or maleimide on polybutadiene; styrene, acrylonitrile and methyl methacrylate on polybutadiene, styrene and alkyl acrylates or methacrylates on polybutadiene, styrene and acrylonitrile on ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymers, styrene and acrylonitrile on polyacrylates or polymethacrylates, styrene and acrylonitrile on aery late/butadiene copolymers, as well as mixtures thereof with the styrenic copolymers indicated above.<br>
Nitrile polymers are also useful in the polymer composition of the invention. These include homopolymers and copolymers of acrylonitrile and its analogs, such as polymethacrylonitrile, poly acrylonitrile, acrylonitrile/-butadiene polymers, acrylonitrile/alkyl aery late polymers, acrylonitrile/alkyl methacrylate/butadiene polymers, and various ABS compositions as referred to above in regard to styrenics.<br>
Polymers based on acrylic acids, such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, methyl methacrylic acid and ethacrylic acid and esters thereof may also be used. Such polymers include polymethylmethacrylate, and ABS-type graft copolymers wherein all or part of the acrylonitrile-type monomer has been replaced by an acrylic acid ester or an acrylic acid amide. Polymers including other acrylic-type monomers, such as acrolein, methacrolein, acrylamide and methacrylamide may also be used.<br>

N,N'-diacetal-adipic acid dihydrazide, N,N'-bis-salicyloyl-oxalic acid dihydrazide, N,N'-bis-salicyloylhydrazine, N,N'-bis-(3,5-di-tert.-butyl-i-hydroxyphenylpropionyl)-hydrazine, N-salicyloyl-N'-salicylalhydrazine, ^^ salicyloyl-amino-l,2,4-triazole or N,N'-bis-salicyloyl-thiopropionic acid dihydrazide.<br>
Nucleation agents, e.g., 4-tert.-butylhenzoic acid, adipic acid, diphenylacetic acid or substituted sorbitols such as 1,3; 2,4-dibenzylidenesorbitol.<br>
Other additives that can be incorporated in the stabilized compositions are antiblocking agents, clarifiers, antiozonants, lubricants such as stearyl alcohol, fillers, carbon black, asbestos, kaolin, talc, glass fibers, pigments, optical brighteners, flameproofing agents and antistatic agents.<br>
The compositions of the present invention can be prepared by a variety of methods involving intimate admixing of the ingredients with any additional materials desired in the formulation. Suitable procedures include solution blending and melt blending. Because of the availability of melt blending equipment in commercial polymer processing facilities, melt processing procedures are generally preferred. Examples of equipment used in such melt compounding methods include: co-rotating and counter-rotating extruders, single screw extruders, disc-pack processors and various other types of extrusion equipment. In some instances, the compounded material exits the extruder through small exit holes in a die and the resulting strands of molten resin are cooled by passing the strands through a water bath. The cooled strands can be chopped into small pellets for packaging and further handling.<br>
All of the ingredients may be added initially to the processing system, or else certain additives may be precompounded with each other or with a portion of the polymeric resin to make a stabilizer concentrate. Moreover, it is also sometimes advantageous to employ at least one vent port to allow<br><br>
venting (either atmospheric or vacuum) of the melt. Those of ordinary skill in the art will be able to adjust blending times and temperatures, as well as component addition location and sequence, without undue additional experimentation.<br>
While the stabilizers of this invention may be conveniently incorporated by conventional techniques into polymeric resins before the fabrication thereof into shaped articles, it is also possible to apply the instant stabilizers by a topical application to the finished articles. This is particularly useful with fiber applications where the instant stabilizers are applied topically to the fibers, for example, by way of a spin finish during the melt spinning process.<br>
All patents and references cited herein are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
The following examples are presented for the purpose of illustration only and are not to be construed to limit the nature of scope of the instant invention in any manner whatsoever. Examples<br>
In a typical process for the practice of the present invention, the test stabilizer was blended/mixed with the resin using Turbula Blender for 30 minutes. The test stabilizer, if liquid, was preblended with a portion of a resin which was then subsequently blended with the resin and mixed well using Turbula Blender. The stabilized resin formulation was extruded at 100 rpm from a 1 inch (2.54 cm) diameter extruder at 500°F (260°C) (Killion extruder). The rpm and temperatures may be adjusted according to the resin utilized.<br>
After each of the first, third and fifth extrusions, resin pellets were compression molded 5 into 125 mil (3.2 mm) thick plaques at 370°F (188°C) and specimen yellowness index (YI) was determined. Low YI values indicate less yellowing. Additionally, the melt flow rate (in grams/10 minutes) was measured (ASTM-D-1238) on the pellets after the first, third and fifth<br><br>
extrusions. The closer the melt flow rate after the fifth extrusion is to the melt flow rate after the first extrusion indicates the superior process stabilization of the resin.<br>
Molded plaques were subjected to a gas fading procedure whereby the plaques were subjected to fumes from a propane flame in a chamber at 100°C for the specified time. The yellowness index (YI) of the plaques was then measured. In this test, the closer the number is to zero, the less yellow is the plaque. .<br>

In each of the examples in Tables 1 to 6, a commercially available<br>
polypropylene resin obtained from Montell as grade Profax 6501 was used.<br>
The compositions of Tables 1 to 6 demonstrate the broad utility and<br>
advantageous properties that may be obtained for compositions that do<br>
contain a tertiary amine oxide in combination with other stabilizers.<br><br>
Table 1<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
As seen by these data, the melt stability of the compositions not containing a tertiary amine oxide is inadequate as indicated by the large shift in melt flow rate upon multiple extrusion passes. As seen by these data, neither salts of organic acids, phenolic antioxidants, organic phosphorus compounds, or hindered amine stabilizers afford solutions to the melt stability issue.<br>
Table 2.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Compositions 8 to 11 in Table 2 illustrate the properties obtained with a combination of an organic phosphorus compound with a phenolic antioxidant in the presence of an alkaline metal salt of a fatty acid. A can be seen by these illustrative data, a reduction in the shift in melt flow rate upon multiple extrusion passes is obtained in these compositions. Compositions 14 to 16 contain a hydroxylamine compound with other stabilizers and improvements in properties are also obtained.<br>
Table3.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The compositions in Table 3 illustrate the tremendous improvements in properties that are obtained with a combination of a tertiary amine oxide and at least one other stabilizer, for example, a hindered amine stabilizer. As exemplified by comparing the properties of composition 14 not containing a tertiary amine oxide to composition 15 containing a tertiary amine oxide with a hindered amine oxide, very desirable physical properties are obtained. It was unexpected, for example, that such a large improvement in melt stability, as indicated by the retention of the MFR value on multiple extrusions, would be obtained in the compositions containing the tertiary amine oxide.<br>
Table 4.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The compositions in Table 4 further illustrate the tremendous improvements in properties that are obtained with a combination of a tertiary amine oxide and at least one other stabilizer, for example, an organic phosphorus compound. As exemplified by comparing the properties of composition 20 not containing a tertiary amine oxide to composition 21 containing a tertiary amine oxide with an organic phosphorus compound, very desirable physical properties are obtained. It was unexpected that the tertiary amine oxide would afford the magnitude of improvements noted by these data.<br>
Table5<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The compositions in Table 5 further illustrate the tremendous improvements in properties that are obtained with a combination of a tertiary amine oxide and a combination of stabilizers, for example, an organic phosphorus compound and a hindered amine stabilizer. As exemplified by comparing the properties of composition 28 not containing a tertiary amine oxide to composition 29 containing a tertiary amine oxide with an organic phosphorus compound and a hindered amine stabilizer, very desirable physical properties are obtained with the addition of the tertiary amine oxide.<br><br>
Table 6.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The compositions in Table 6 further illustrate the tremendous improvements in properties that are obtained with a combination of a tertiary amine oxide, in these examples N(O)(CH3)(C16-18)2, and a combination of stabilizers, for example, an organic phosphorus compound and a hindered amine stabilizer. These compositions further demonstrate the unexpected improvement in melt stability with the addition of the tertiary amine oxide.<br><br><br>
