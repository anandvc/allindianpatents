				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a process for industrially producing<br>
halogenated a-fluoroethers which are important as an intermediate of<br>
medicines or agrichemicals or as a flon alternative compound.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Halogenated a-fluoroethers, the object of the present invention,<br>
serve as an important intermediate of medicines or agrichemicals or as an<br>
important flon alternative compound. Particularly, a,ß,ß,ß-tetrafluoroethers<br>
are utilized as a useful intermediate for a volatile anaesthetic "desflurane". As<br>
conventional techniques for such a-fluoroethers, relating to the present<br>
invention, the following two techniques are exemplified.<br>
[0003] There have been disclosed: a process for reacting fluoral hemiacetals<br>
with the Yarovenko's reagent (Patent Publication 1); and a process consisting<br>
of two process steps in which fluoral hemiacetals are converted into<br>
corresponding /rtoluenesulfonic acid esters and then these are reacted with<br>
Fluoride anion (F) (Patent Publication 2).<br>
REFERENCES ABOUT PRIOR ART<br>
Patent Publication<br>
[0004] Patent Publication 1: Japanese Patent Application Publication No.<br>
50-76007<br>
Patent Publication 2- Japanese Patent Application Publication No.<br>
2-104545.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005] An object of the present invention is to provide a process for<br>
industrial production of halogenated a-fluoroethers.<br>
[0006] Patent Publication 1 in which the Yarovenko's reagent is used as a<br><br>
dehydroxyfluorination agent requires previously preparing the reagent from<br>
chlorotrifluoroethylene and diethylamine. Furthermore, a fluorine-containing<br>
organic waste is stoichiometrically formed as a by-product, so that an<br>
industrial execution thereof had been difficult.<br>
[0007] In Patent Publication 2 where the reaction is achieved with two<br>
process steps, the operations including a post-treatment are so complicated<br>
that a high productivity cannot be expected. Additionally, the total yield is<br>
also not satisfying.<br>
[0008] Thus, there has been intensely desired a production process which<br>
can be readily and industrially accomplished and provide halogenated<br>
a-fluoroethers with high productivity and yield.<br>
[0009] As a result of eager studies the present inventors have made in<br>
view of the above, they have newly found it possible to produce halogenated<br>
a-fluoroethers represented by the general formula [2] by reacting halogenated<br>
hemiacetals represented by the general formula [1] with sulfuryl fluoride in<br>
the presence of an organic base. Furthermore, there has been also newly<br>
found that the present reaction can be applied to bis-derivatives formed<br>
through alkylene group (, in which halogenated a-fluoroether bis-derivatives<br>
represented by the general formula [2a] are obtained as the objective by using<br>
halogenated hemiacetal bis-derivatives represented by the general formula<br>
[1a] as the starting substrate).<br>
[0010] Incidentally, the present applicant has found a<br>
dehydroxyfluorination reaction of alcohols by combination of sulfuryl fluoride<br>
(SO2F2) and the organic base and has already filed an application therefor<br>
[International Publication 2006/098444 Pamphlet (Japanese Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 2006-290870)]. On the other hand, the raw<br>
materials of the present invention are relatively unstable "halogenated<br>
hemiacetals" or bis-derivatives thereof. These can be said to be "an equivalent<br>
of a compound having a carbon with which two hydroxyl groups are<br>
concurrently bonded". The present inventors have made it clear: that these<br>
raw material compounds are reacted with sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2) in the<br>
presence of the organic base thereby selectively subjecting "free hydroxyl<br>
group" alone to fluorine substitution; and that, as opposed to this, -OR2 group,<br>
 group and haloalkyl group are inducted into the halogenated<br>
a-fluoroelhcrs represented by the general formula [2] or the halogenated<br>
a-fluoroether bis-derivatives represented by the general formula [2a] with<br>
high yield without being subjected to any change.<br>
[0011] Moreover, the present invention allows the reaction to be conducted<br>
with one process step as a one-pot reaction, in which fluorosulfuric<br>
acid-esterification of the starting substrate halogenated hemiacetals (or the<br>
bis-derivatives thereof) and a succeeding fluorine substitution proceed<br>
continuously. In fluorine substitution, "a salt or complex of an organic base<br>
with hydrogen fluoride" formed as a by-product in the reaction system by the<br>
fluorosulfuric acid-esterification is usefully utilized as a Fluoride anion source,<br>
(see Scheme 1 showing an example where the halogenated hemiacetals<br>
represented by the general formula [1] are used as the starting substrate.)<br>
[0012] [Chemical Formula 1]<br><br>
[0013] In the present invention, it has also been made clear that the<br>
succeeding fluorine substitution enormously excellently proceeds by<br>
conducting the reaction in the additional presence of "a salt or complex of an<br>
organic base with hydrogen fluoride" in the system (see Scheme 2 showing an<br>
example where the halogenated hemiacetals represented by the general<br>
formula [1] are used as the starting substrate.) The fluorosulfuric<br>
acid-esterification of the relatively unstable halogenated hemiacetals proceeds<br>
excellently even in the presence of "a salt or complex of an organic base with<br>
hydrogen fluoride", which is a new finding.<br>
[0014] [Chemical Formula 2]<br><br>
[0015] Furthermore, the present invention have newly made it clear that<br>
hemiacetals of fluoral (corresponding to halogenated hemiacetals represented<br>
by the general formula [3]) or hemiacetals of 3,3.3-trifluoropyruvic acid esters<br>
(corresponding to halogenated hemiacetals represented by the general<br>
formula [o|) are extremely preferable starting substrates. When using such<br>
starting substrates, the desired reaction can excellently proceed under mild<br>
conditions and the objective halogenated crfluoroethers are obtained with<br>
high selectivity and yield. These starting substrates can be readily prepared<br>
from fluoral or 3,3.3-trifluoropyruvic acid esters (either of which is readily<br>
available in large-scale) so as to be suilable also from the viewpoint of a<br>
starting substrate for an industrial production process. Particularly,<br>
a,ß,ß,ß-tetrafluoroethylmetnylethcr obtained from fluoral methyl hemiacetal<br>
arc useful as an intermediate for a volatile anaesthetic "desflurane", so as to<br>
bo particularly preferable.<br>
[0016] Thus, an extremely useful process has been found as a process for<br>
industrially producing the halogenated afluoroethers. thereby achieving the<br>
present invention.<br>
[0017] More specifically, the present invention includes the following 1st<br>
process to 7th process and provides an industrial production process of the<br>
halogcnated a-fluoroethers.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0025] Advantageous points of the present invention over conventional<br>
techniques will be discussed below.<br>
[0026] As compared to Patent Publication 1, a dehydroxyfluorination agent<br>
used in the present invention is suitable for large-scale production. Sulfuryl<br>
fluoride is widely utilized as a fumigant and industrially available at low cost.<br>
Additionally, wastes made in the use of sulfuryl fluoride can be conveniently<br>
treated into inorganic salts such as fluorite (CaF2), calcium sulfate, etc., which<br>
reduce the load to the environment.<br>
[0027] As compared to Patent Publication 2, the reaction can be conducted<br>
with one process step (in which fluorosulfuric acid-esterification and a<br>
succeeding fluorine substitution proceed continuously as a one-pot reaction)<br>
with extremely high productivity and in high yield.<br>
[0028] Furthermore, impurities serving as by-products difficult to be<br>
separated off are hardly provided in the present invention, so that the<br>
objective product can be obtained at a high chemical purity.<br>
[0029] Thus, the present invention is a production process which can solve<br>
all problems the conventional techniques had carried and can be industrially<br>
readily conducted.<br>
[0030] A process for producing halogenated a-fluoroethers of the present<br>
invention will be discussed in detail.<br><br>
[0031] In the present invention, it is possible to produce halogenated<br>
a-fluoroethers represented by the general formula [2] (or halogenated<br>
a-fluoroether bis-derivatives represented by the general formula [2a]) by<br>
reacting halogenated hemiacetals represented by the general formula [1] (or<br>
halogenated hemiacetal bis-derivatives represented by the general formula<br>
[1a]) with sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2) in the presence of an organic base.<br>
[0032] HaloR as shown in the general formula [1] denotes haloalkyl group.<br>
Examples of the haloalkyl group are those obtained by substitution caused on<br>
any carbon atom in a linear, branched or cyclic (with a carbon number of not<br>
smaller than 3) alkyl group having a carbon number of from 1 to 18 with any<br>
number of and any combination of halogen atoms including fluorine, chlorine,<br>
bromine and iodine (where the alkyl group causes substitution with at least<br>
one halogen atom). Among these, the preferable is fluoroalkyl group and<br>
chloroalkyl group, and the more particularly preferable is trifluoromethyl<br>
group.<br>
[0033] R1 of the halogenated hemiacetals represented by the general<br>
formula [1] denotes hydrogen atom, alkyl group, substituted alkyl group,<br>
alkoxycarbonyl group or substituted alkoxycarbonyl group. Examples of alkyl<br>
moieties of the alkyl group and of the alkoxycarbonyl group (the moieties<br>
corresponding to, for example. R3 of the halogenated hemiacetals represented<br>
by the general formula [5]) include a linear, branched or cyclic (with a carbon<br>
number of not smaller than 3) alkyl group having a carbon number of from 1<br>
to 18.<br>
[0034] The alkyl group and the alkoxycarbonyl group may have, on any<br>
carbon atom in the alkyl moiety, any number of and any combination of<br>
substituents (and correspond to substituted alkyl group and substituted<br>
alkoxycarbonyl group, respectively). Examples of the substituents are:<br>
halogen atom such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, etc.; azide group;<br>
nitro group; lower alkyl group such as methyl group, ethyl group, propyl group,<br>
etc.; lower haloalkyl group such as fluoromethyl group, chloromethyl group,<br>
bromomethyl group, etc.; lower alkoxy group such as methoxy group, ethoxy<br>
group, propoxy group, etc.; lower haloalkoxy group such as fluoromethoxy<br>
group, chloromethoxy group, bromomethoxy group, etc.; lower alkyl amino<br>
group such as dimothylamino group, diethylamino group, dipropylamino<br>
group, etc.; lower alkylthio group such as mcthylthio group, ethylthio group,<br>
propylthio group, etc.; cyano group; lower alkoxycarbonyl group such as<br>
methoxycarbonyl group, ethoxycarbonyl group, propoxycarbonyl group, etc.;<br>
aminocarbonyl group (CONH2); lower alkylaminocarbonyl group such as<br>
dimethylaminocarbonyl group, diethylaminocarbonyl group,<br>
dipvopylaminocarbonyl group, etc.; unsaturated group such as alkenyl group,<br>
alkynyl group, etc.; aromatic cyclic gi'oup such as phenyl group, naphthyl<br>
group, pyrrolyl group, furyl group, thienyl group, etc.; aromatic cyclic oxy<br>
group such as phenoxy group, naphthoxy group, pyrrolyloxy group, furyloxy<br>
group, thienyloxy group, etc.; aliphatic heterocyclic group such as piperidyl<br>
group, piperidino group, morpholinyl group, etc.; protected hydroxyl group;<br>
protected amino group (including amino acid and peptide residue); protected<br>
thiol group; protected aldehyde group; protected carboxyl group; etc.<br>
[0035] Incidentally, in the present specification, each of the following terms<br>
is used as having the following meaning. "Lower" means a linear, branched or<br>
cyclic (with a carbon number of not smaller than 3) chain having a carbon<br>
number of from 1 to 6. In the case that "unsaturated group" is the double bond<br>
(alkenyl group), it may be in the form of E configuration, Z configuration or a<br>
mixture of these. As "protecting groups of hydroxyl group, amino group<br>
(including amino acid and peptide residue), thiol group, aldehyde group and<br>
carboxyl group", it is possible to use protecting groups and the like described<br>
in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third Edition. 1999, John Wiley &amp;<br>
Sons, Inc.(, in which not less than two functional groups may be protected<br>
with one protecting group). Moreover, "unsaturated group", "aromatic cyclic<br>
group", "aromatic cyclic oxy group" and "aliphatic heterocyclic group" may be<br><br>
subjected to substitution with halogen atom, azide group, nitro group, lower<br>
alkyl group, lower haloalkyl group, lower alkoxy group, lower haloalkoxy<br>
group, lower alkyl amino group, lower alkylthio group, cyano group, lower<br>
alkoxycarbonyl group, aminocarbonyl group, lower alkylaminocarbonyl group,<br>
protected hydroxyl group, protected amino group (including amino acid and<br>
peptide residue), protected thiol group, protected aldehyde group, protected<br>
carboxyl group or the like.<br>
[0036] Among these, hydrogen atom, alkoxycarbonyl group and substituted<br>
alkoxycarbonyl group are preferable. Particularly, hydrogen atom and<br>
alkoxycarbonyl group are more preferable.<br>
[0037] R2 of the halogenated hemiacetals represented by the general<br>
formula [1] denotes alkyl group or substituted alkyl group.<br>
[0038] The alkyl group and the substituted alkyl group are the same as the<br>
alkyl group and the substituted alkyl group as had been discussed as R1 of the<br>
halogenated hemiacetals represented by the general formula L1], and can be<br>
selected independently of R1.<br>
[0039] HaloR and R1 of the halogenated hemiacetal bis-derivatives<br>
represented by the general formula [1a] are the same as haloR and R1 as had<br>
been discussed on the halogcnatcd hemiacetals represented by the general<br>
formula [1]. n represents an integer of from 2 to 18. Among these, with regard<br>
to n, an integer of from 2 to 12 is preferable and that of from 2 to 6 in<br>
particular is more preferable. Two haloR included in the halogenated<br>
hemiacetal bis-derivatives represented by the general formula [1a] are<br>
mutually independently selected from the above substituents. However, it is<br>
preferable to select the same substituent for the two haloR if taking the<br>
preparation of the starting substrate into account. Additionally, the same<br>
thing can be said for two R1 of the halogcnatcd hemiacetal bis-derivatives<br>
represented by the general formula [1a].<br><br>
[0040] Stereochemistry of the halogenated hemiacetals represented by the<br>
general formula [1] will be discussed. In the halogenated hemiacetals, a<br>
carbon atom with which hydroxyl group forms a covalent bond is an<br>
asymmetric carbon atom with the exception of the case where haloR and R1<br>
adopt the same substituent. In the case where the starting substrate has the<br>
asymmetric carbon atom, it is not only allowed to use a racemic form (it will be<br>
understood that the racemic form can be used) but also allowed to use an<br>
optically active form (R configuration or S configuration), and its optical<br>
purity is not limited. A dehydroxyfluorination reaction of the present<br>
invention proceeds together with stereochemical reversal, stereochemical<br>
maintenance or racemization. This stereoselectivity differs according to the<br>
combination of the starting substrate and the organic base and to the adopted<br>
reaction conditions, so that the starting substrate, the organic base and the<br>
reaction conditions may be suitably selected according to the desired<br>
stereochemistry (R configuration, S configuration or racemic form) of the<br>
objective halogenated a-fluoroethers represented by the general formula [2],<br>
The same as the stereochemistry of the halogenated hemiacetals represented<br>
by the general formula [1] goes for that of corresponding two carbon atoms of<br>
the halogenated hemiacetal bis-derivatives represented by the general<br>
formula [1a], mutually independently.<br>
[0041] The halogenated hemiacetals represented by the general formula [1]<br>
(or the halogenated hemiacetal bis-derivatives represented by the general<br>
formula [1a]) can be prepared by the conventionally known method.<br>
Halogenated hemiacetals represented either by the general formula [3] or by<br>
the general formula [5], the particularly preferable starting substrate for the<br>
present invention, can be readily prepared from fluoral [CF3CHO (or an<br>
equivalent thereof)] and 3,3,3-trifluoropyruvic acid esters [CF3COCO2R (R<br>
denotes alkyl group or substituted alkyl group)], respectively. Furthermore,<br>
ethylhomiacetal or hydrate of fluoral, and ethyl 3,3,3-trifluoropyruvate are<br>
commercially available.<br>
[0042] The amount of the used sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2) is required only to<br>
be not lower than 0.7 mole, preferably from 0.8 to 10 moles in general, more<br>
preferably from 0.9 to 5 moles in particular, relative to 1 mole of the<br>
halogenated homiacotals represented by the general formula [1]. In the case of<br>
using the halogenated hemiacetal bis-derivatives represented by the general<br>
formula [1a] as the starting substrate, it is required only to use it in the same<br>
manner in an amount two times that of the halogenated hemiacetals<br>
represented by the general formula [1].<br>
[0043] As a dehydroxyfluorination agent for the present invention,<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonyl fluoride (CF3SO2F) or perfluorobutanesulfonyl<br>
fluoride (C4F9SO2F) may be used. However, a conscious employment of these<br>
reactants is not so advantageous in view of their availability in large scale;<br>
their fluorine atom economy; waste treatment (by which a fluorine-containing<br>
organic waste is stoichiometrically formed as a by product): etc.<br>
[0044] Examples of the organic base for the present invention are<br>
trimethylamine, dimethylethylamine. diethylmethylamine, triethylamine,<br>
di-n-propylmcthylamine, dimethylcyclohexylamine, diisopropylethylamine,<br>
tri-n-propylaminc, diisopropylisobutylamine, dimethyl-n-nonylamine,<br>
tri-n-butylamine, di-n-hexylmethylamine, dimethyl-n-dodecylamine,<br>
tri-n-pentylamine, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO),<br>
dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), l,5diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene (DBN),<br>

particular. These organic bases may be used singly or in combination.<br>
Additionally, an organic base having a carbon number of not less than 8 is<br>
high in fat-solubility so as to be readily recovered at a post-treatment using<br>

such an organic base is suitable for an industrial production process. In the<br>
present specification, "carbon number" means the total number of carbon<br>
atoms contained in an organic base.<br>
[0046] The amount of the used organic base is required only to be not lower<br>
than 0.7 mole, preferably from 0.8 to 15 moles in general, more preferably<br>
from 0.9 to 10 moles in particular, relative to 1 mole of the halogenated<br>

pyridine, 2,4-lutidine, 2,6-lutidine, 3,5-lutidine and 2,4,6-collidine in<br>
particular.<br>
[0050] The mole ratio of the organic base of "a salt or complex of an organic<br>
base with hydrogen fluoride" to hydrogen fluoride is within a range of from<br>
100:1 to 1:100, preferably within a range of from 50:1 to 1:50 in general, and<br>
more preferably within a range of from 25:1 to 1:25 in particular. Furthermore,<br>
it is convenient to use "a complex comprising 1 mole of triethylamine and 3<br>
moles of hydrogen fluoride" and "a complex comprising up to 30% (up to 10<br>
mol%) of pyridine and up to 70% (up to 90 mol%) of hydrogen fluoride", both of<br>
which are placed on sale from Aldrich (Aldrich, 2007-2008 Comprehensive<br>
Catalogue).<br>
[0051] The amount of "a salt or complex of an organic base with hydrogen<br>
fluoride" to be used is required only to be not less than 0.3 mole as Fluoride<br>
anion (F-), preferably within a range of from 0.5 to 50 moles in general and<br>
more preferably within a range of from 0.7 to 25 moles in particular, relative<br>
to 1 mole of the halogenated hemiacetals represented by the general formula<br>
[1]. When using the halogenated hemiacetal bis-derivatives represented by<br>
the general formula [1a] as the starting substrate, it is required only to use it<br>
in the same manner in an amount two times that of the halogenated<br>
hemiacetals represented by the general formula [1].<br>
[0052] Examples of a reaction solvent are: aliphatic hydrocarbons such as<br>
n-hexane, cyclohexane, n-heptane, etc.; aromatic hydrocarbons such as<br>
benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, mesitylene. etc; halogenated<br>
hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane, etc;<br>
ethers such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, diisopropyl ether, tertrbutyl<br>
methyl ether, etc; esters such as ethyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, etc; amides<br>
such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide,<br>
N-methylpyrrolidone, 1,3-dimethyl-2imidazolidinone, etc; nitriles such as<br>
acetonitrile, propionitrile, etc; and dimcthylsulfoxide, etc.<br>
[0053] Among these, the preferable are n-hexane, n-heptane, toluene,<br>
xylene, mesitylene, methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran, diisopropyl ether,<br>
tert-butyl metlryl ether, ethyl acetate, N,N-dimethylformamide,<br>
N,N-dimethylacetamide, acetonitrile, propionitrile and dimethylsulfoxide.<br>
Particularly, the more preferable are toluene, xylene, methylene chloride,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, diisopropyl ether, ethyl acetate, N,N-dimethylformamide<br>
and acetonitrile. It is possible to use these reaction solvents singly or in<br>
combination. Furthermore, the present invention may be performed without<br>
the solvent.<br>
[0054] In the case of using the reaction solvent, the amount thereof is<br>
required only to be not less than 0.1 L (liter), preferably within a range of from<br>
0.2 to 10 L in general, and more preferably within a range of from 0.3 to 5 L in<br>
particular, relative to 1 mole of the halogenated hemiacetals represented by<br>
the general formula [1] (or the halogenated hemiacetal bis-derivatives<br>
represented by the general formula [1a]).<br>
[0055] The temperature condition is required only to be conducted within a<br>
range of from 100 to +100 °C, preferably within a range of from 60 to +60 °C<br>
in general, more preferably within a range of from -50 to +50 °C in particular.<br>
In the case of conducting the reaction under a temperature condition of not<br>
lower than the boiling point of sulfuryl fluoride (-49.7 °C), it is possible to use<br>
a pressure-proof reaction vessel.<br>
[0056] The pressure condition is required only to be conducted within a<br>
range of from atmospheric pressure to 2 MPa, preferably within a range of<br>
from atmospheric pressure to 1.5 MPa in general, more preferably within a<br>
range of from atmospheric pressure to 1 MPa in particular. Therefore, it is<br>
preferable to conduct the reaction in the use of a pressure-proof reaction<br>
vessel made of a material such as stainless steel (SUS) or glass (glass lining).<br>
Furthermore, for infusion of sulfuryl fluoride in large-scale, the effective is a<br>
process for causing a negative pressure in a pressure-proof reaction vessel<br>
first of all, and then introducing gaseous or liquid sulfuryl fluoride into<br>
therein while recovering the pressure under a reduced pressure.<br>
[0057] The reaction time is within 72 hours; however, it differs according to<br>
the combination of the starting substrate and the organic base and to the<br>
adopted reaction conditions. It is therefore preferable to determine a temporal<br>
point at which the starting substrate is generally completely consumed as the<br>
endpoint of the reaction, upon tracking the progress of the reaction by an<br>
analytical means such as gas chromatography, thin layer chromatography,<br>
liquid chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), etc. The objective<br>
halogenated a-fluoroethers represented by the general formula [2] (or the<br>
halogenated a-fluoroether bis-derivatives represented by the general formula<br>
[2a]) can be obtained by conducting an usual operation on a<br>
reaction-terminated liquid as a post-treatment. The objective product can be<br>
purified at a high chemical purity by activated carbon treatment, distillation,<br>
rccrystallization. column chromatography or the like as necessary.<br>
[0058] Such an operation as to directly distill the reaction-terminated<br>
liquid is particularly effective. By conducting such a post-treatment<br>
(defluorination, fractional distillation or the like, as necessary), it becomes<br>
possible to obtain a product of quality sufficient either for an intermediate of<br>
medicines or agrichemicals or for a flon alternative compound.<br>
[0059] In the present invention, the halogenated hemiacetals represented<br>
by the general formula [1] (or the halogenated hemiacetal bis-derivatives<br>
represented by the general formula [1a]) are reacted with sulfuryl fluoride in<br>
the presence of the organic base, thereby producing the halogenated<br>
a fluoroethers represented by the general formula [2] (or the halogenated<br>
crfluoroether bis-derivatives represented by the general formula [2a]).<br>
[0060] It is preferable to conduct the reaction in the presence of "a salt or<br>
complex of an organic base with hydrogen fluoride", by which the objective<br>
dehydroxyfluorination reaction can proceed extremely favorably.<br>
[0061] It is more preferable to use. as the starting substrate, halogenated<br>
hemiacetals represented by the general formula [3] or the general formula [5]<br>
and able to be prepared from fluoral or 3,3,3-trifluoropyruvic acid esters. With<br>
this, the industrially important halogenated a-fluoroethers can be industrially<br>
produced with high yield and selectivity.<br>
