DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Tetra vermi bed (100) is constructed of a seven-layered, chemically-treated,<br>
U.V.-stabilized, composite HDPE woven fabric (90), which is prepared by alternately laminating a layer of LDPE (92) in between two layers of HDPE (91). The composite fabric (90) has three layers of HDPE, which are made from HDPE granules, added with UV-stabilizing compound, and which alternate with four LDPE layers (signifying the word 'Tetra' of the product's name). The combined seven layers are laminated by extrusion coating into a single composite fabric (90). AN INVENTIVE FEATURE OF THE PRESENT INVENTION IS THE USE OF THE UV-STABILIZED, COMPOSITE FABRIC (90) IN CONSTRUCTION OF TETRA VERMI BED (100). UV-stabilizing compound is added 3-5% by weight to the granules to prevent cracking of the composite fabric (90), caused due to exposure to sunlight.<br>
Tetra vermi bed (100) is constructed of a main panel (100-1) of said composite fabric (90), admeasuring 16 feet 9 inches by 4 feet 2 inches and of a twin side panel (100-2,100-3) of said composite fabric (90), admeasuring 12 feet 9 inches by 2 feet. Each side panel (100-2, 100-3) is processed, as explained below, before it is joined with the main panel (100-1): <br>
Tetra vermi bed (100) is firmly erected over laid ground (95) - provided with a gradient of 6 inches over 12 feet - by means of fourteen pockets (80-1..80-14), of which six pockets (80-1. .80-6) exteriorly and perpendicularly to longitudinal axis are heat-sealed on the side panel (100-2) of the tetra vermi bed (100), as illustrated in the accompanying drawing # 1, and the other six pockets (80-7..80-14) exteriorly and perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis are heat-sealed on the other side panel (100-3) of the tetra vermi bed (100).The thirteenth pocket (80-13) exteriorly and parallel to the longitudinal axis is heat-sealed, as illustrated in the accompanying drawing # 1, on one lateral side of the main panel (100-1) of the tetra vermi bed (100) and the fourteenth pocket (80-14) exteriorly and parallel to the longitudinal axis is heat-sealed on the other lateral side of the main panel (100-1) of the tetra vermi bed (100). The fourteen pockets (80-1 to 80-14) are of inverted U- shape, open at bottom end and closed at the top end such that straight, 11/2 inch diameter wooden pole (81) is easily slid through 6 inch clearance provided in each of said fourteen pockets (80-1 to 40- 14) for the firm installation of the tetra vermi bed (100) over the well-laid ground (95). THE SECOND INVENTIVE FEATURE OF THE PRESENT INVENTION IS THE FOURTEEN, INVERTED U-SHAPED POCKETS (80-1 TO 80- 14), AS EXPLAINED ABOVE.<br>
Each U-shaped pocket (80-1 to 80- 14) is - during process of attachment - heat-sealed simultaneously on two sides thereof (80A) onto the panels (100-1, 100-2, 100-3) of the tetra vermi bed (100), leaving a six inch clearance (80B) along the entire length of the U-shaped pocket being attached (80-1 to 80- 14), as illustrated in the accompanying drawings # 7, 9 and 12. THE THIRD INVENTIVE FEATURE IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE TWIN-SIDED HEAT-SEALING (80A) OF FOURTEEN POCKETS (80-1 TO 80-14) AND ALLOWING SIX INCH CLEARANCE (80B) ALONG THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE FOURTEEN POCKETS (80-1 TO 80-14).<br>
Tetra vermi bed (100) breathes by ventilating out hot air generated within the mass being composted and facilitating circulation of fresh air into the composting mass through six (70-1... 70-6) windows. Three windows (70-1... 70-3) are provided on the side paffel (100-2) of the tetra vermi bed (100) and the other three windows (70-4... 70-6) are provided on the other side panel (100-3) of tetra vermi bed (100). The windows (70-1... 70-6) are marked on the respective side panels (100-2,100-3) of the tetra vermi bed (100) and the marked areas with round corners are cut out from the respective side panels. <br>
An HDPE net is sealed onto the cut portion, as illustrated in the accompanying drawing #11.<br>
A drain (71) is provided in the main panel (100-1) of the tetra vermi bed (100), as illustrated in the accompanying drawing # 4, by marking, cutting out the marked portion and sealing with an HDPE net (71). THE FOURTH INVENTIVE FEATURE OF THE PRESENT INVENTION IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE PROVISION OF SIX WINDOWS (70-1... 70¬6) - IN THE FORM OF HDPE NET - ON THE SIDE PANELS (100-2, 100¬3) AND A DRAIN OUTLET (71) - IN THE FORM OF HDPE NET - ON THE MAIN PANEL (100-1), AS EXPLAINED ABOVE.<br>
The side panels (100-2, 100-3) and the main panel (100-1) have their respective longitudinal and the lateral ends - farthest to the U-shaped mouths of the pockets (80-1 to 80-14) - roped end-to-end. ROPING THE MAIN PANEL (100-1) AND THE SIDE PANELS (100-2, 100-3) CHARACTERIZE THE FIFTH INVENTIVE FEATURE OF THE TETRA VERMI BED (100), AS EXPLAINED ABOVE. <br>
The inverted U-shaped pockets (80-1 to 80-12), after heat sealing with the side panels (100-2, 100-3), have their other end cut into U-shape, folded over the roped edge of the respective panels (100-2, 100-3) for anchoring and heat- sealed to the interior side of the panels (100-2, 100-3). U-pockets (80-13, 80¬14) are similarly anchored over the two lateral sides of the main panel (100-1). ANCHORING THE INVERTED, U-SHAPED POCKETS (80-1..80-14) OVER THE PANELS (100-1.. 10-3), AS EXPLAINED ABOVE, CHARACTERIZE THE SIXTH INVENTIVE FEATURE OF THE TETRA VERMI BED (100).<br>
The side panels (100-2, 100-3) at the un-roped longitudinal ends are heat- sealed with the main panel (100-1), thereby anchoring the twelve U-pockets (80-1 ...80-12) at their respective lower ends , as illustrated in the accompanying drawing # 5. The two lateral sides of the side panels (100¬2,100-3) are sealed in vertical configuration with the respective extending sides of the main panel (100-1) to form four joints (100-4 to 100-7), that form the four vertical sides of the tetra vermi bed (100). The vertical joints (100¬4... 100-7) are each folded sideways and then heat-sealed over the folds to impart extra strength against tear, as illustrated in the accompanying drawing # 6. THE SEVENTH INVENTIVE FEATURE OF THE TETRA VERMI<br>
BED IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE JOINING, BY HEAT-SEALING, THE TWO SIDE PANELS (100-2, 100-3) WITH THE MAIN PANEL (100¬1) AND STRENGTHENING THE JOINTS - THAT FORM THE VERTICAL SIDES OF THE TETRA VERMI BED (100) - BY FOLDING SIDEWAYS THE VERTICAL JOINTS AT (100-4 TO 100-7) AND HEAT- SEALING OVER THE FOLDS THE FOUR VERTICAL JOINTS (100-4 TO 100-7).<br>
The tetra vermi bed (100) is fully constructed in a foldable form and is ready for installation.<br>
The novelty of the present invention lies in the installation of the tetra vermi bed (100) by grouting fourteen straight, 40 inch-long, circular wooden poles (81-1 to 81-14) to 18 inches depth from the ground level (95)- as illustrated in the accompanying drawing # 14 - sliding downward the fourteen pockets (80-1 .... 80-14) over the grouted fourteen wooden poles (81-1...81- 14) to the points closest to the ground surface such that the poles (81-1.. .81¬14) firmly hold the four vertical sides of the tetra vermi bed (100), with the central portion of the main panel (100-1) forming the bottom of the tetra vermi bed (100) between the two fold lines (100-8, 100-9), as illustrated in the<br>
accompanying drawing # 2.<br>
Four eyelets (100-10 to 100-13) are provided at top four corner points of the tetra vermi bed (100) to facilitate roping and the eyelets are covered with flaps (100-14 to 100-17), as illustrated in the accompanying drawing # 3, to protect the roping from damage by the edges of the eyelets (100-10 to 100-13).<br>
A drain (71) is fabricated at the marked portion of the main panel (100-1) by cutting out the marked portion with round corners and heat-sealing an HDPE net over the cut portion. A HDPE drain pipe (83), semi-circularly cut-open along a part length, is fitted under the drain (71) such that the tetra vermi bed (100) fits neatly over the cut-open length (83-A) of the pipe (72) and the remainder uncut portion (83-B) is buried in the ground and placed above the container (84), as illustrated in the accompanying drawing U 4, which is placed in the dug-out pit (85) to collect vermi wash liquid (86). The drain (71) is positioned at the lowest point of the gradient of the laid ground (95). THE EIGHTH INVENTIVE FEATURE OF THE PRESENT INVENTION IS CHARACTERIZED IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE DRAIN (71) AND BY THE POSITIONING OF THE DRAIN PIPE (83), SEMI-CIRCULARLY <br>
CUT OPEN ALONG A PART LENGTH (83-A) FOR PLACEMENT UNDER THE DRAIN (71) OF THE TETRA VERMI BED (100).<br>
