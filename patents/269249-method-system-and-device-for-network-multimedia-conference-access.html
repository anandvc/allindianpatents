200710153037.8 submitted with the State Intellectual Property Office of P.R.C. on<br>
September 18, 2007, entitled " METHOD, SYSTEM, AND DEVICE FOR NETWORK<br>
MULTIMEDIA CONFERENCE ACCESS", the contents of which are incorporated herein<br>
in entirety by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a network multimedia conference technology, in<br>
particularly, to a network multimedia conference access method, system, and device.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
At present, along with development of network multimedia communication<br>
technology, in consideration of traffic safety, time, and cost, more and more people give up<br>
conventional face-to-face communication method. Meanwhile, a network multimedia<br>
conference system involving voices, videos, and data has become a widely used<br>
communication tool, with which people may participate in important conferences held far<br>
way without going out or even on their own desks, thereby saving a large amount of time<br>
and money.<br>
The Next Generation Network (NGN) technology has been gradually developed,<br>
with a result that NGN-based new services become more and more diversified. The network<br>
multimedia conference systems which are implemented by powerful control capability of<br>
devices such as switch controllers and application servers (AS) emerge. Most of the<br>
network multimedia conference systems are based on a Session Initialize Protocol (SIP).<br>
When a host begins a conference, a host number, a conference identification (ID), and a<br>
conference state of each conference are registered on the AS.<br>
Regarding a conventional conference access method, in order to access a<br>
conference, a terminal firstly must dial a conference access code, and the conference access<br>
code is a trigger number preset in the switch controller and capable of triggering a call<br><br><br>
request to the AS. Once the switch controller determines that a called number in the call<br>
request is the preset conference access code, the switch controller triggers the call request to<br>
the AS. After receiving the call request from the switch controller, the AS notifies a calling<br>
terminal to input the conference ID according to corresponding prompts. After the terminal<br>
inputs the conference ID, the AS controls the calling terminal to access the conference.<br>
In the process of implementing the present invention, the inventor has found the<br>
following defects in the prior art. Under such a conference access method, the terminal must<br>
know the conference access code and the conference ID before gaining access to the<br>
conference. However, multiple conference systems may exist in network, each system<br>
possibly has different conference access codes, and the conference IDs are generated by the<br>
system at random which are meaningless. These numbers are verbose, so it is difficult to<br>
remember the conference access codes and the conference IDs, and participants must<br>
review relevant information including the conference access codes and the conference IDs<br>
repeatedly. In another aspect, the terminal receiving a conference notice, such as a mail box,<br>
and the terminal participating in the conferences, such as a telephone, are generally different,<br>
which means that not all of the participants can review the conference notice in time; as a<br>
result, the participants cannot gain access to the conference conveniently and rapidly.<br>

control server determines whether the host terminal is holding a conference. If the host<br>
terminal is holding a conference, the control server directly adds the calling terminal to the<br>
conference being held by the host terminal. Or if the control server determines that the host<br>
terminal is holding the conference, the control server connects the incoming call to the host<br>
terminal and requests the host terminal to select whether to connect the calling terminal to<br>
the conference. Thereby, a user may be added to the conference by directly calling the host<br>
user ID, so that the user may gain access to the conference more rapidly and conveniently,<br>
without dialing verbose and irregular conference access codes and conference IDs.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In order to make the objectives, technical solutions and advantages of the<br><br><br>
present invention more apparent, embodiments accompanied with figures are described in<br>
detail below.<br>
Figure 1 is a structural view of a network multimedia conference access system<br>
according to a first embodiment of the present invention, in which the network multimedia<br>
conference access system includes an AS 101 and a switch controller 102.<br>
A calling terminal 103 is connected to the switch controller 102 through a<br>
switch core network. A host terminal 104 is connected to the switch controller 102 through<br>
a packet core network. The switch controller 102 is connected to the AS 101. The switch<br>
core network is a home public land mobile network, a public switched telephone Network,<br>
an NGN, or a combination thereof. The packet core network is the Internet, a wide area<br>
network, a local area network, or a combination thereof.<br>
The calling terminal 103 may be a terminal functioning like a telephone such as<br>
a common fixed telephone or a mobile telephone, and is adapted to send a call request to<br>
the switch controller 102.<br>
The host terminal 104 not only functions like a common telephone, but also<br>
servers as a host of a conference to hold a conference.<br>
The switch controller 102 is adapted to connect a call and forward a message,<br>
and set in advance the number of the host terminal 104 as a trigger number capable of<br>
sending the call request to the AS 101. The switch controller 102, after determining that a<br>
called number in the received call request is the preset number of the host terminal 104,<br>
sends the call request to the AS 101, and otherwise, sends the call request to the called<br>
terminal. The switch controller 102 receives an instruction of connecting the calling<br>
terminal to the conference controlled by the host terminal sent by the AS 101, and connect<br>
the calling terminal 103 to the conference controlled by the host terminal 104.<br>
The AS 101 determines whether the host terminal 104 corresponding to the<br>
called number in the call request sent by the switch controller 102 is holding a conference.<br>
If the host terminal 104 is holding a conference, the AS 101 sends an instruction of<br>
connecting the calling terminal to the conference controlled by the host terminal to the<br>
switch controller 102; and if the host terminal 104 is not holding a conference, the AS 101<br><br><br>
sends an instruction of connecting the calling terminal with the called terminal to the switch<br>
controller 102.<br>
The AS 101 further includes a conference access module 105, a message<br>
receiving module 106, and a message sending module 107.<br>
The conference access module 105 is adapted to control a conference access<br>
flow and determine whether the host terminal 104 corresponding to the called number in the<br>
call request received by the message receiving module 106 is holding a conference<br>
according to stored host IDs, conference IDs, and the conference state information of the<br>
conferences. If the host is holding a conference, the conference access module 105 sends an<br>
instruction of connecting the calling terminal to the conference controlled by the host<br>
terminal to the message sending module 107; and if the host is not holding a conference, the<br>
conference access module 105 sends an instruction of connecting the calling terminal with<br>
the called terminal to the message sending module 107.<br>
The message receiving module 106 receives the call request sent by the switch<br>
controller 102, and sends the call request to the conference access module 105.<br>
The message sending module 107 receives the instruction of connecting the<br>
calling terminal to the conference controlled by the host terminal sent by the conference<br>
access module 105, forwards the instruction to the switch controller 102, receives the<br>
instruction of connecting the calling terminal with the called terminal sent by the<br>
conference access module 105, and forwards the instruction to the switch controller 102.<br>
The switch controller 102 further includes a message control module 109 and a<br>
conference trigger module 108.<br>
The message control module 109 is adapted to receive and send a message,<br>
receive the call request sent by the calling terminal 103, and send the call request to the<br>
conference trigger module 108; receive the instruction of sending the call request to the AS<br>
101 sent by the conference trigger module 108, and send the call request to the AS 101;<br>
receive the instruction sent by the conference trigger module 108 to connect the calling<br>
terminal 103 and the host terminal 104; receive the instruction of connecting the calling<br>
terminal to the conference controlled by the host terminal sent by the AS 101, and connect<br><br><br>
the calling terminal 103 to the conference controlled by the host terminal 104; and receive<br>
the instruction of connecting the calling terminal with and the called terminal sent by the<br>
AS 101, and connect the calling terminal 103 and the host terminal 104.<br>
The conference trigger module 108 receives the call request sent by the message<br>
control module 109, and determines whether the called number in the call request is a preset<br>
host number which is capable of triggering the conference access flow. If the called<br>
number in the call request is a preset host number which is capable of triggering the<br>
conference access flow, the conference trigger module 108 sends the instruction of sending<br>
the call request to the AS 101 to the message control module 109; and the called number in<br>
the call request is not a preset host number which is capable of triggering the conference<br>
access flow, the conference trigger module 108 sends the instruction of connecting the<br>
calling terminal and the called terminal to the message control module 109.<br>
Figure 2 is a flow chart of a conference access method according to the first<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
When the calling terminal 103 in the embodiment shown in Figure 1 dials the<br>
number of the host terminal 104, the detailed flow is shown in Figure 2 as follows.<br>
In Step 201, the calling terminal dials the number of the host terminal and sends<br>
the call request to the switch controller.<br>
In Step 202, the switch controller determines whether the called number in the<br>
received call request is the preset number of the host terminal which is capable of triggering<br>
the call request to the AS. If the called number in the received call request is the preset<br>
number of the host terminal which is capable of triggering the call request to the AS, the<br>
process proceeds to Step 204, and otherwise, the process proceeds to Step 203.<br>
In Step 203, the switch controller normally connects the calling terminal with<br>
the called terminal, and the flow ends.<br>
In Step 204, the switch controller sends the call request of the calling terminal to<br>
the AS.<br>
In Step 205, the AS receives the call request and begins the conference access<br>
flow, and determines whether the called host number is holding a conference according to<br><br><br>
stored host IDs, conference IDs, and conference state information of the conferences. If the<br>
called host number is holding a conference, the process proceeds to Step 207, and if the<br>
called host number is not holding a conference, the process proceeds to Step 206.<br>
In Step 206, the AS sends an instruction of connecting the calling terminal with<br>
the called terminal to the switch controller, instructs the switch controller to connect the<br>
calling terminal with the called terminal, and the flow ends.<br>
In Step 207, the AS sends an instruction of connecting the calling terminal to the<br>
conference controlled by the host terminal to the switch controller, and instructs the switch<br>
controller to connect the calling terminal to the conference controlled by the called host<br>
terminal.<br>
In Step 208, the AS sends a notice to the host terminal through the switch<br>
controller, and notifies the host terminal that the calling terminal has been connected to the<br>
conference successfully.<br>
The first embodiment achieves the function of automatically gaining access to<br>
the conference by dialing the host number. However, irrelevant persons sometimes are not<br>
allowed to participate in some important conferences. Therefore, in order to further prevent<br>
persons having no relation to a conference from participating in the conference by mistake<br>
through dialing the host number, after the AS determines whether the host terminal is<br>
holding a conference, the call request of the calling terminal is connected to the host<br>
terminal, and the host terminal determines whether to add the calling terminal into the<br>
conference.<br>
Figure 3 is a system structural view of a network multimedia conference access<br>
system according to a second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In order to achieve the aforementioned function, the present invention provides a<br>
system of the second embodiment, as shown in Figure 3, which includes an AS 301 and a<br>
switch controller 102.<br>
The calling terminal 103 and the switch controller 102 have the functions<br>
described in the first embodiment. Furthermore, the switch controller 102 in this<br>
embodiment is further adapted to send a received message sent by the host terminal 304 to<br><br><br>
the AS 301; receive an instruction sent by the AS 301, and perform corresponding steps of<br>
connecting the calling terminal 103 with the host terminal 304, getting through a call of the<br>
calling terminal and the called terminal, rejecting the call request of the calling terminal 103,<br>
or connecting the calling terminal 103 to the conference controlled by the host terminal 304.<br>
The AS 301 receives the call request of the calling terminal 103 to the host<br>
terminal 304 sent by the switch controller 102, and instructs the switch controller 102 to<br>
connect the calling terminal 103 with the host terminal 304. If receiving a reply message<br>
sent by the switch controller 102, the AS 301 instructs the switch controller 102 to get<br>
through the call of the calling terminal and the called terminal. If receiving a call rejecting<br>
message sent by the switch controller 102, the AS 301 instructs the switch controller 102 to<br>
reject the call request of the calling terminal 103. If receiving a call ending message sent by<br>
the switch controller 102, the AS 301 instructs the switch controller 102 to end the call<br>
between the calling terminal 103 and the host terminal 304. If receiving a notice of allowing<br>
to connect the calling terminal to the conference transparently transmitted by the host<br>
terminal 304 through the switch controller 102, the AS 301 sends an instruction of<br>
connecting the calling terminal to the conference controlled by the host terminal to the<br>
switch controller 102.<br>
In the AS 301, the conference access module 303 records the host number, the<br>
conference ID, and the conference state information in real time, receives the call request of<br>
the calling terminal 103 to the host terminal 304 sent by the message receiving module 302,<br>
and sends the instruction of connecting the call request to the host terminal to the message<br>
sending module 307. If receiving the reply message sent by the message receiving module<br>
302, the conference access module 303 sends the instruction of getting through the call of<br>
the calling terminal and the called terminal to the message sending module 307. If receiving<br>
the call rejecting message sent by the message receiving module 302, the conference access<br>
module 303 sends the instruction of rejecting the call request of the calling terminal to the<br>
message sending module 307. If receiving the call ending message sent by the message<br>
receiving module 302, the conference access module 303 sends an instruction of ending the<br>
call between the calling terminal and the host terminal to the message sending module 307.<br><br><br>
If receiving the notice of allowing connecting the calling terminal to the conference sent by<br>
the message receiving module 302, the conference access module 303 sends the instruction<br>
of connection.<br>
The message receiving module 302 receives the call request sent by the switch<br>
controller 102 and forwards the call request to the conference access module 303; receives<br>
the reply message sent by the switch controller 102 and forwards the reply message to the<br>
conference access module 303; receives the call rejecting message sent by the switch<br>
controller 102 and forwards the call rejecting message to the conference access module 303;<br>
receives the call ending message sent by the switch controller 102 and forwards the call<br>

connect the calling terminal to the conference controlled by the host terminal transparently<br>
transmitted by the host terminal 304 through the switch controller 102 and forwards the<br>
notice to the conference access module 303.<br>
The message sending module 307 receives the instruction of connecting the<br>
calling terminal 103 with the host terminal 304 sent by the conference access module 303<br>
and forwards the instruction to the switch controller 102; receives the instruction of getting<br>
through the call of the calling terminal and the called terminal sent by the conference access<br>
module 303 and forwards the instruction to the switch controller 102; receives the<br>
instruction of rejecting the call request of the calling terminal sent by the conference access<br>
module 303, and sends the instruction to the switch controller 102; receives the instruction<br>
of ending the call between the calling terminal and the host terminal sent by the conference<br>
access module 303 and sends the instruction to the switch controller 102; receives the<br>
instruction of connecting the calling terminal to the conference controlled by the host<br>
terminal sent by the conference access module 303 and sends the instruction to the switch<br>
controller 102.<br>
The host terminal 304 further includes a message transmission module 305 and a<br>
command input module 306.<br>
The message transmission module 305 receives the call request sent by the<br>
switch controller 102 and forwards the call request to the command input module 306;<br><br><br>
receives the reply message sent by the command input module 306 and forwards the reply<br>
message to the switch controller 102; receives the call rejecting message sent by the<br>
command input module 306 and forwards the call rejecting message to the switch controller<br>
102; receives the call ending message sent by the command input module 306 and forwards<br>
the call ending message to the switch controller 102; receives the notice of connecting the<br>
calling terminal to the conference sent by the command input module 306 and sends the<br>
notice to the switch controller 102.<br>
When receiving the call request from the message transmission module 305, the<br>
command input module 306 prompts a terminal user to select to answer a call, reject a call,<br>
or allow connecting the calling terminal to the conference. If receiving a call rejecting<br>
command selected by the terminal user, the command input module 306 sends a call<br>
rejecting message to the message transmission module 305. If receiving the command of<br>
allowing to connect the calling terminal to the conference selected by the terminal user, the<br>
command input module 306 generates a notice of allowing to connect the calling terminal<br>
to the conference controlled by host terminal, and sends the notice to the message<br>

Figure 4 is a flow chart of the conference access method according to the second<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
When the calling terminal 103 in the embodiment of Figure 3 dials the number<br><br><br>
of the host terminal 304 as a calling terminal, the specific conference access flow is shown<br>
in Figure 4 as follows.<br>
Steps 401-404 are identical to the Steps 201-204 in the first embodiment, and<br>
will not be repeated any more.<br>
In Step 405, after receiving the call request, the AS sends the instruction of<br>
connecting the calling terminal with the called terminal to the switch controller, and<br>
instructs the switch controller to connect the calling terminal with the host terminal.<br>
Steps 406-409 show the detailed processes of the AS instructing the switch<br>
controller to connect the calling terminal with the host terminal, and are described as<br>
follows.<br>
In Step 406, the AS sends the call request to the host terminal to the switch<br>
controller.<br>
In Step 407, the switch controller sends the call request to the host terminal.<br>
In Step 408, the host terminal sends a ringing message to the switch controller.<br>
In Step 409, the switch controller sends the ringing message of the host terminal<br>
to the AS.<br>
In Step 410, the AS controls a ring-playing device, such as a Media Resource<br>
Server (MRS), so as to play a ringing tone for the calling terminal. Meanwhile, the host<br>
terminal prompts the terminal user to select to answer a call, reject a call, or allow<br>
connecting the calling terminal to the conference controlled by the host terminal. If<br>
receiving the call rejecting command selected by the terminal user, the process proceeds to<br>
Step 411. If receiving a call answering comment selected by the terminal user, the process<br>
proceeds to Step 412. If receiving the command of allowing to connect the calling terminal<br>
to the conference selected by the terminal user, the process proceeds to Step 501 in Figure<br>
5.<br>
In Step 411, the host terminal returns the call rejecting message to the switch<br>
controller and rejects the call request of the calling terminal, thereby ending the flow.<br>
In Step 412, the host terminal sends the reply message to the switch controller.<br>
In Step 413, the switch controller sends the reply message of the host terminal to<br><br><br>
the AS.<br>
In Step 414, the AS instructs the switch controller to establish the call between<br>
the calling terminal and the host terminal.<br>
In Step 415, after the call between the calling terminal and the host terminal has<br>
been established, the host terminal prompts the terminal user to select to end the call or<br>
allow connecting the calling terminal to the conference. If receiving the call ending<br>
command selected by the terminal user, the process proceeds to Step 416. If receiving the<br>
command of allowing to connect the calling terminal to the conference selected by the<br>
terminal user, the process proceeds to Step 417.<br>
In Step 416, the host terminal sends a call ending message to the switch<br>
controller, ends the call with the calling terminal, and the flow ends as well.<br>
Steps 417-423 are the steps of the host terminal answering the call and notifying<br>
the AS to connect the calling terminal to the conference controlled by the host terminal, and<br>
are described as follows.<br>
In Step 417, the host terminal generates a notice of connecting the calling<br>
terminal to the conference, and transparently transmits the notice to the AS through the<br>
switch controller.<br>
In Step 418, the AS sends a message of ending the call of the host terminal to<br>
the switch controller.<br>
In Step 419, the switch controller sends the call ending message to the host<br>
terminal.<br>
In Step 420, the host terminal sends a message of ending the call successfully to<br>
the switch controller.<br>
In Step 421, the switch controller sends a message of ending the call of the host<br>
terminal successfully to the AS.<br>
In Step 422, the AS sends the instruction of connecting the calling terminal to<br>
the conference to the switch controller, and instructs the switch controller to connect the<br>
calling terminal to the conference controlled by the host terminal.<br>
In Step 423, the AS transparently transmits a notice to the host terminal through<br><br><br>
the switch controller, and notifies the host terminal that the calling terminal has been<br>
connected to the conference successfully.<br>
In Steps 410 and 415, the operation of prompting the user of the host terminal to<br>
connect the calling terminal to the conference, if a conference system allows the host<br>
terminal to hold multiple conferences at the same time, after the user of the host terminal<br>
selects to connect the calling terminal to the conference, the user of the host terminal is<br>
further prompted to select the list of conferences which the calling terminal may be<br>
connected to, and the user of the host terminal may select to connect the calling terminal to<br>
a specified conference.<br>
Figure 5 is a branch flow chart of the conference access method according to the<br>
second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In Step 410, the processes of the host terminal selecting to connect the calling<br>
terminal to the conference held by the host terminal according to the prompt is shown in<br>
Figure 5, and the specific steps are described as follows.<br>
In Step 501, the host terminal transparently transmits the generated notice of<br>
connecting the calling terminal to the conference to the AS through the switch controller.<br>
Steps 502-505 are the steps for the AS to normally cancel the call request of the<br>
calling terminal to the host terminal.<br>
In Step 502, the AS sends a message of canceling the call request to the host<br>
terminal to the switch controller.<br>
In Step 503, the switch controller sends a message of canceling the call request<br>
to the host terminal.<br>
In Step 504, the host terminal sends a message of canceling the call request<br>
successfully to the switch controller.<br>
In Step 505, the switch controller sends a message of canceling the call request<br>
to the host terminal successfully to the AS.<br>
In Step 506, the AS sends an instruction of connecting the calling terminal to the<br>
conference to the switch controller, and instructs the switch controller to connect the calling<br>
terminal to the conference controlled by the host terminal.<br><br><br>
In Step 507, the AS transparently transmits a notice to the host terminal through<br>
the switch controller and notifies the host terminal that the calling terminal has been<br>
connected to the conference successfully.<br>
The notice in Steps 417 and 501 is adapted to enable the AS to perform the<br>
operation of connecting the calling terminal to the conference. The notice needs to be<br>
supported by a message carrying a message body of an extensible markup language (XML)<br>
or TEXT format in a content field, such as INFO, MESSAGE, REFER, or NOTIFY<br>
messages in a session initialize protocol (SIP). As long as relevant information is filled in<br>
the message body carried in the messages, the commands to be executed by the AS may be<br>
notified to the AS. The detailed contents to be filled in the message body are as follows.<br><inf><br><cmd>202K/cmd&gt;<br><id>3405</id><br><account>025400694</account><br><attendee>0257880011</attendee><br></cmd></inf><br>
The specific parameters are described as follows.<br>
The parameter Cmd represents a command code. Different codes represent<br>
different operations, so that the AS may know which operation is desired. For example,<br>
2021 represents the operation of connecting the calling terminal to the conference. Of<br>
course, the command code may be defined freely.<br>
The parameter Id represents the conference ID and identifies which conference<br>
the calling terminal should participate in. If the conference system allows one host terminal<br>
to hold multiple conferences at the same time, the terminal should carry the parameter in the<br>
notice to indicate the conference which the calling terminal should participate in. If the<br>
conference system limits one host number to hold only one conference, the parameter may<br><br><br>
be omitted.<br>
The parameter Account represents the number or an account of the host<br>
terminal.<br>
The parameter Attendee represents the number of the calling terminal, that is,<br>
the number of the terminal to participate in the conference.<br>
Therefore, the meaning of the aforementioned notice lies in telling the AS to<br>
execute the command code 2021 to connect the calling terminal to the conference, and<br>
connect the calling terminal with the number 0257880011 to the conference with the<br>
conference ID 3405 held by the host terminal with the number 025400694.<br>
The host terminal of the conference to be connected to may also be placed in a<br>
From header field of the message, and the calling number may also be placed in the to<br>
header field of the message. In this manner, in the message body, the account of the host<br>
and the attendee of the participants may not be filled in. The message is generated by an<br>
access control module in the host terminal according to the selection of the terminal user.<br>
In view of the above, the embodiments both describe the conference system<br>
which calls by numbers. However, in fact, the conference system may adopt various calling<br>
forms, such as calling by bynames, calling by E-MAIL addresses, and calling by Internet<br>
Protocols (IP) addresses. Different calling methods are merely caused by different user IDs,<br>
and the embodiments of the present invention do not aim at limiting the calling methods for<br>
connecting to a conference. In addition, the embodiments of the present invention merely<br>
involve the connecting of conference calls, but do not involve specific conference forms.<br>
No matter what the conference form is, such as voice conferences or multimedia data<br>
cooperative conferences, participants all can apply the present invention.<br>
Of course, the application server in the embodiments may be replaced by a<br>
device or a system with the same functions, such as Service Control Point (SCP) or<br>
PARLAY servers which may replace the application server. The servers for controlling the<br>
conference may be generally called "control servers." The switch controller may also be<br>
replaced by the device or system with the same functions, such as Softswitch, and the<br>
devices and systems for controlling switch are generally called "switch controller."<br><br><br>
Additionally, the devices may be connected in a wired or wireless manner. Networks that<br>
the switch controller is connected to may include IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) and other<br>
networks. In addition, the SIP protocol in this embodiment may also be Hypertext Transfer<br>
Protocol (HTTP), or H.248 protocol, and may also be a proprietary protocol. In fact, the<br>
embodiments of the present invention do not limit specific protocols and message formats.<br>
Therefore, the present invention has many other embodiments. The aforementioned<br>
equivalent replacements or improvements may become the embodiments of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The aforementioned embodiments both achieve the function of connecting a<br>
terminal to a conference by dialing the number of a host. In the first embodiment, the host<br>
needs not to execute any operation, and the application server connects the calling terminal<br>
to the conference by determining the state of the host, thereby achieving the objective of<br>
gaining access to the conference conveniently and rapidly. In the second embodiment, the<br>
application server connects an incoming call to the host terminal, so that the host terminal<br>
and the application server cooperate to connect the calling terminal to the conference,<br>
thereby not only achieving the objective of connecting to the conference conveniently and<br>
rapidly, but also preventing the calling terminal from attending a conference by mistake.<br>
Those of ordinary skill in the art may understand that all or a part of steps in the<br>
various methods in the aforementioned embodiments may be finished by a program<br>
instructing relevant hardware. The program may be stored in a computer accessible storage<br>
medium, including ROM, RAM, magnetic disks, or optical disks.<br>
Finally, it should be understood that the above embodiments are only used to<br>
explain, but not to limit the technical solution of the present invention. In despite of the<br>
detailed description of the present invention with referring to above preferred embodiments,<br>
it should be understood that various modifications, changes or equivalent replacements can<br>
be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present<br>
