				<td>Description<br>
PIG binding protein of adipocytes<br>
The invention refers to a protein from plasma nnennbranes of adipocytes which has specific binding affinity to phosphoinositolglycans.<br>
The role of phospholipids and phospholipases in trans-membrane signaling is firmly established. Equally well-established is the concept of anchoring proteins into cell membranes through a covalently linked glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), and the precise chemical structure of the GPI anchor has been worked out for several GPI-anchored proteins, such as acetylcholinesterase (AchE) from human erythrocytes, rat Thy-1, and several coat proteins of parasites like the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) from Trypanosoma brucei. Lipid anchoring occurs through phosphatidylinositol (PI), which consists of a diacyl- or an alkylacyl glycerol type phospholipid. Since the latter occurs, among others, in mammalian anchors, and differs from the bulk PI present in membranes, it could provide a novel molecular species involved in the generation of second messengers derived from GPIs. Signaling by GPIs is of special interest as these lipid-anchored molecules do not span the membrane, but in most  cases are embedded in the outer half of the lipid bilayer. The signal-mediated release from the cell membrane of GPIs has been demonstrated for a variety of endocrine and paracrine molecules, ranging from hormones to growth factors. The involvement of GPIs in transmembrane signaling and their intracellular effects seems by now established, but little is known about the signaling pathway leading to the observed metabolic effects.<br>
The notion that GPI-anchored molecules possess signaling properties results from eariy experiments in which it was shown that the binding of insulin to its receptor activates the hydrolysis of GPIs. A low-molecular-weight substance was identified that mimics certain actions of insulin on metabolic enzymes. This substance has an inositol glycan structure and is produced by the insulin-sensitive hydrolysis of a GPI in the plasma membrane. Although the GPI precursor for the inositol glycan enzyme<br><br>
modulator was originally thought to be structurally analogous to the GPI membrane protein anchor, there are distinct differences in the carbohydrate moiety between the signal transducing GPI and the GPI anchor of membrane proteins. The GPI-membrane protein anchor invariably consists of the trimannose core followed by an ethanolamine  phosphate, which provides the link to the C-terminal amino acid of the attached protein.<br>
Regulated GPI hydrolysis is not only restricted to insulin but has been obsen/ed with a number of other hormones.<br>
In practically all cases, the stimulation of cells by hormones or growth factors leads to a transient release of GPI-anchored proteins from the cell surface. Most of the receptors for these agonists are either tyrosine kinase receptors or receptors coupled to tyrosine kinases.<br>
Many of the proteins involved in insulin action have been identified at the molecular level. The insulin receptor is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase, which when activated by insulin binding, undergoes rapid autophosphorylation and phosphorylates a number of intracellular substrates, among them one or more 50-60 kDa proteins, including the Shc, a 15 kDa fatty acid binding protein and several so-called insulin receptor substrate proteins, lRS-1/2/3/4. After tyrosine phosphorylation, the IRS polypeptides act as docking proteins for several Src homology 2 domain-containing adaptor molecules and enzymes, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K), Grb2, SHP2, Nck, and Fyn. The interaction between the IRS proteins and PI 3-K occurs through the p85 regulatory subunit of the enzyme and results in an increase in catalytic activity of the p110 subunit. PI 3-K is essential for many insulin-sensitive metabolic processes, including stimulation of glucose transport and glycogen synthesis. In all cases in which there is stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS proteins, there is concomitant jocking of these proteins to the p85 subunit of PI 3-K and, with the exception of the cross-talk between the insulin and angiotensin signaling systems, this docking was associated with stimulation of PI 3-K activity.<br><br>
In addition to the identification of the signal-transduction pathways leading directly from the insulin receptor to down-stream targets, several cross-talks have been delineated between signaling transmission by insulin and other hormones/growth factors or diverse exogenous stimuli, which either mimic (to a certain degree) or modulate in a  positive or negative fashion metabolic and/or mitogenic insulin action in various cellular systems. Since none of these iigands activates the insulin receptor kinase directly, their signaling pathways may converge with that of insulin at a more distal signaling step. This property is shared by phosphoinositolglycan-peptide (PIG-P) molecules of different type as for example for PIG-P prepared from the glycosylphosphatidylinosito! anchor of yeast Gcelp which mimic metabolic insulin action to a significant degree without concomitant induction of insulin receptor kinase activity.<br>
Positive cross-talk of phosphoinositolglycans (PIG) and PIG-peptides (PlG-P) to the insulin signal transduction cascade in insulin-responsive target cells involves redistribution of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored plasma membrane proteins (GPI protein) and dually acylated non-receptor tyrosine kinases from detergent-resistant glycolipid-enriched plasma membrane raft domains of high cholesterol content (hcDlGs) to rafts of lower cholesterol content (IcDIGs).<br>
I In isolated rat adipocytes the primary target of PIG-P is localized in hcDIGs. Radiolabeled PIG-P, Tyr-Cys-Asn-NH-(CH2)2-O-P0(0H)0-6Mana1-2)-2Mana1-6Mana1-4GluN1-6ino-1,2-(cyclic)-phosphate (YCN-PIG) as well as radiolabeled and lipolytically cleaved GPI protein (IcGcelp) fronn Saccharomyces cerevisiae, from which YCN-PIG has been derived, bind to hcDIGs in saturable fashion but not to IcDIGs, microsomes or total plasma membranes. Binding of both YCN-PIG and IcGcel is specific, as it is completely abolished either by excess of chemically synthesized unlabeled YCN-PIG or by pretreatment of the adipocytes with trypsin and subsequent NaCI or N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) indicating that YCN-PIG is recognized by a cell surface receptor. Binding of PIG-P is considerably increased in hcDIGs from "adipocytes pretreated with GPl-specific phospholipases C compatible with lipolytic removal of endogenous Iigands, such as GPI proteins/lipids. Binding affinity is highest for YCN-PIG, followed by the combination of the separate constituents, Tyr-Cys-Asn-<br><br>
NH-(CH2)2-OH(YCN)plusHO-PO(H)0-6Mana1(Mana1-2)-2-Mana1-6Mana1-4GluN1-6lno-1,2-(cyclic)-phosphate (PIG37), and the peptide variant, YMN-PIG. PIG37 and YCN alone exhibit intermediate and low affinity. Incubation of adipocytes with YCN-PIG diminishes subsequent labeling by [14"CJNEM of the 115kDa polypeptide released 1 from the cell surface by sequential trypsin/NaCI-treatment. These data show that in rat adipocytes insulin-mimetic PIG(-P) are recognized by a trypsin/NaCI/NEM-sensitive 115kDa protein of hcDlGs which acts as receptor for GPI proteins.<br>
Several types of DIGs seem to exist in the same cell. Caveolae represent special DIGs in terminally differentiated cells which form flask-shaped invaginations driven by the abundant expression of the marker and structural protein, caveolin 1-3.<br>
Caveolae which account for 20 % of the plasma membrane surface area in adipocytes ^Darticipate in receptor-mediated potocytosis, endocytosis, transcytosis and signal transduction. In isolated rat adipocytes IcDIGs of low cholesterol/caveolin content exhibiting high buoyant density (according to sucrose density gradient centrifugation) can be discriminated from typical hcDIGs with high cholesterol/caveolin content characterized by low buoyant density. The major fraction of GPI proteins, such as Gce1 and Nuc, as well as of dually acylated proteins, such as the NRTK Non Receptor Tyrosine Kinase, pp59LYN, are located at hcDIGs. In response to insulin-mimetic stimuli such as synthetic PIG or the sulfonylurea, glimepiride, both GPI proteins and NRTKs are translocated from hcDIGs to IcDIGs. This redistribution is not caused by loss of their lipid modification.<br>
; The polar core glycan head group without (PIG) or with (PIG-P) adjacent amino acids from the carboxyl-terminus of the GPI protein polypeptide moiety provides the molecular basis of the distribution of GPI proteins between hcDlGs and IcDIGs in the basal state and their redistribution in response to insulin-mimetic stimuli.<br>
GPI proteins are cell surface antigens, ectoenzymes, receptors or cell adhesion molecules expressed in eucaryotes from yeast to man and anchored to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane by a covalently attached glycosylphosphatidylinositol<br><br>
(GPI) lipid moiety. Despite the lack of a transmembrane domain, they have been implicated in signal transduction across the plasma membrane.<br>
The finding that GPI proteins associate with specialized lipid raft domains, so-called detergent-insoluble glycoiipid-enriched rafts, DIGs, rather than with distinct transmembrane binding/linker proteins demonstrates the possibility of lipid-lipid interactions as the major coupling mechanism for signal transduction mediated by GPI proteins.<br>
The basic structural element of DIGs is a lateral assembly of (glyco)sphingolipids and cholesterol which adopts a liquid-ordered (lo) organization distinct from that of adjacent liquid-disordered (1) regions in the membrane lipid bilayer. The plasma membranes of mammalian cells contain cholesterol (30-50 mol %) and a mixture of lipids with preference for the Id domains (e.g. phosphatidylcholines with unsaturated tails) and lipids bearing saturated acyl chains with preference for I domains (e.g. [giycojsphingolipids and GPI lipids). Cholesterol is thought to contnbute to the tight packing of lipids in lo domains by filling interstitial spaces between lipid molecules, and the formation of lo domains is seen only within certain ranges of cholesterol concentration.<br>
Insulin is a very important hormone, which exerts a significant effect on the metabolism of the body. In the general terms it promotes anabolic processes and inhibits catabolic processes. Specifically it increases the rate of synthesis of glycogen, fatty acids and protein, and inhibits the breakdown of protein and glycogen. A vital action of the hormone is to stimulate cells from a liver, muscle and fat to remove glucose, some other sugars and amino acids from the blood.<br>
Bovine insulin consists of two polypeptide chains, polypeptide A containing 21 AA and polypeptide B containing 30 AA, which are joined by two -S-S- (disulfide bridges). This  same structural pattern occurs in insulin of many mammals including humans.<br><br>
The structure is compact cylinder-like with only the carboxyl end of the B chain sticking out from the rest of the protein. There are many hydrophobic residues, which interact to form a central hydrophobic core, and interdispersed are some polar residues on either side that further stabilize the protein. Three disulfide bridges clamp the structure together, two inter-chain and one intra-chain.<br>
A common feature in the biosynthesis of many proteins, but in particular for proteins exported from cells, is that the protein is produced in a precursor form then modified to produce the final form during storage and before release. Insulin is synthesized by a group of cells in the pancreas called Islets of Langerhans, stored in granules then released into the blood when required.<br>
When insulin is first synthesized it consists of a 100 AA single polypeptide chain consisting of a signal sequence of 16 AA, a B chain, a C chain called connecting chain of 33 AA, and a A chain. This structure is called pre-proinsulin (PPl). It is thought that the signal region is responsible for directing the PPl from the site of synthesis to the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) in the cell, which collect and package the insulin to form storage granules. When located in the ER, the signal peptide is removed by a protease enzyme.<br>
Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that requires long-term medical attention both to imit the development of its devastating complications and to manage them when they do occur. Diabetes is associated with acute and chronic complications as Hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar non-ketotic syndrome.<br>
Type 1 diabetes generally occurs in young, lean patients and is characterized by the marked inability of the pancreas to secrete insulin because of autoimmune destruction of the beta cells. The distinguishing characteristics of a patient with type 1 diabetes is that if insulin is withdrawn, ketosis and eventually ketoacidosis develop. These patients are, therefore, dependent on exogenous insulin to sustain their lives.<br>
Type 2 diabetes typically occurs in individuals older than 40 years who have a family history of diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by peripheral insulin resistance<br><br>
with an insulin-secretory defect that varies in severity. These defects lead to increased hepatic gluconeogenesis, which produces fasting hyperglycemia. Most patients (90 %) who develop type 2 diabetes are obese, and obesity itself is associated with insulin resistance, which worsens the diabetic state.<br>
A variety of other types of diabetes, previously called "secondary diabetes", are caused by other illnesses or medications. Depending on the primary process involved (i.e., destruction of pancreatic beta cells or development of peripheral insulin resistance), these types of diabetes behave similarly to type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The most common are diseases of the pancreas that destroy the pancreatic beta cells (e.g., hemochromatosis, pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, pancreatic cancer), hormonal syndromes that interfere with insulin secretion (e.g., pheochromocytoma) or cause peripheral insulin resistance (e.g., acromegaly, Gushing syndrome, pheochromocytoma), and drug-induced diabetes (e.g., phenytoin, glucocorticoids, estrogens).<br>
Diabetes mellitus is characterized by inappropriate regulation of serum glucose levels. In Type 1 diabetes an autoimmune attack on the endocrine pancreas results in progressive and irreversible destruction of the insulin secreting beta cells. Loss of insulin action on insulin-sensitive target cell glucose uptake and metabolism results. Type 2 diabetes has several etiologies, most often reflected in cellular resistance to insulin action, also with attendant alterations in the regulation of serum glucose levels. Insulin acts through a disulfide-bonded heterotetrameric cell surface receptor comprised of an extracellular alpha subunit coupled via disulfide bonds to a tansmembrane and intracellular beta subunit. In Type 1 diabetes, absence of the igand with normal cellular receptor structure and function is most often the cause of he subsequent metabolic defects. Hormone replacement therapy in the form of daily nsulin injections supplies the ligand for receptor action, though not necessarily in a lormal physiologic fashion. In Type 2 diabetes, resistance to the action of insulin often mderlies the disease with some of the resistance due to defects in receptor action.<br><br>
It is known in case of insulin resistance that a higher amount of insulin is required to set on the insulin signaling cascade by the insulin receptor. The present invention is related to a cell membrane protein of adipocytes which is able to stimulate glucose uptake by circumventing the insulin receptor triggered signaling pathway. This provides for a powerful solution of the problem not to have in hands a screening tool to identify compounds which could act as alternatives for insulin.<br>
Therefore the present invention refers to a protein from the plasma membrane of an adipocyte which is possibly stabilized by simultaneous presence of plasma membranes and/or lipid vesicles and/or raft domains with high cholesterol and/or lipid vesicles and which has specific binding affinity to phosphoinositolglycan or a phosphoinositolglycan-peptide characterized by<br>
a]       ability to thgger tyr phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 or 2 in an adipocyte after specific binding of a phosphoinositolglycan or a phosphoinositolglycan-peptide to this protein and<br>
D]       ability to stimulate glucose uptake in an adipocyte after specific binding of a phosphoinositolglycan or a phosphoinositolglycan-peptide to this protein.<br>

The binding constant is formed by the quotient of the velocity constants of forward and backward reaction. High values of the binding constant (e.g. larger than 10 mM) define a weak and unspecific binding whereas low values (e.g. not more than 100 pM) define a strong and specific binding.<br>

Preparation of Radiolabeled and Lipolytically Cleaved Gce1p (IcGcelp)<br>
Gce1p with intact GPI anchor was purified from lactate-grown yeast cells which had been metaboiically labeled with myo-[14*C]inositol and then enzymatically converted to spheroplasts. Plasma membranes were prepared, purified by Ficoll gradient centrifugation, solubilized using 0.35 % β-amidotaurocholate and subjected to TX-114 partitioning. Gcelp contained in the detergent-enriched phase was purified by gel filtration chromatography on Sephadex S-300, affinity chromatography on N^-(2-aminoethyl)-cAMP Sepharose and phenyl Sepharose chromatography. Elution from the columns was followed by on-line monitoring of ^H-radioactivity. Partially purified Gcelp was precipitated (12 % polyethylene glycol 6000), then resuspended in buffer G (25 mM Tris/acetate, pH 7.4, 144 mM NaCI, 0.1 % fl-amidotaurocholate, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.2 mM EDTA, 5 % glycerol, 0.1 mM PMSF, 5 μM leupeptin, 1 mM iodoacetamide, 10 μg/ml soy bean trypsin inhibitor) at 0.2 mg protein/ml and subsequently incubated (3 h, 25X) in the presence of 6 U/ml Pl-specific PLC (B. cereus). After addition of 10 volumes of an ice-cold solution of 2 % Triton X-114, 10 mM Tris/HCI (pH 7.4), 144 mM NaCI and phase separation (incubation for 2 min at 37°C and centrifugation at 12,000xg for 1 min at 25°C), IcGcelp was recovered from the upper detergent-<br><br>
depleted phase. After two reextractions of the lower detergent-enriched phase by<br>
addition of an equal volume of 10 mM Tris/HCI, 144 mM NaCI, redissolvation on ice<br>
and subsequent phase separation, the combined detergent-depleted phases were<br>
precipitated (12 % polyethylene giycol 6000).<br>
Radiolabeled IcGcelp was supended in buffer lacking β-amidotaurocholate at 200 -<br>
1000dpm/pl.<br>
Preparation of Radiolabeled YCN-PIG<br>
Radiolabeled YCN-PIG was derived from Gce1p by sequential digestion with V8 protease (S. aureus) and PI-PLC (B. cereus). YCN-PIG was recovered from the detergent-depleted phase after TX-114 partitioning and then sequentially punfied by cation exchange chromatography (Dowex 50W-X8), gel filtration on BioGel-P4, anion change chromatography on SAX HPLC column, two thin layer chromatographic runs on Si-60 HPTLC plates using different solvent systems and a final gel filtration on BioGel-P4. The elution of material during each chromatographic separation was followed by measurement of 3H-radioactivity, UV absorption (A220) and insulin-mimetic activity according to stimulation of glucose transport in isolated rat adipocytes. For demonstration of radiochemical purity, the final preparation of YCN-PIG was subjected to Dionex CarboPac PA-1 anion exchange HPLC at pH 13 calibrated in Dionex units by inclusion of a glucose oligomer standard mix., The internal standards were detected using a pulsed amperiometnc detector. The 14C-labeled fragments were followed by the Raytest Ramona on-line radioactivity monitor. For determination of the concentration, YCN-PIG were hydrolyzed (6 M HCI, 16 h, 110°C) and the amount of inorganic phosphate (2 mol/molecule) and tyrosine (1 mol/m.olecule ) was determined. Dried YCN-PIG was stored at -50oC until use and then suspended in H2O containing 2 mM DTT at a final concentration of 100 μM.<br>
Preparation of Rat Adipocytes and Incubation with PIG(-P)/YCN<br>
Adipocytes were isolated by collagenase digestion from epididymal fat pads of male Sprague Dawley rats (140-150 g, fed ad libitum) and incubated in KRH buffer (0.14<br><br>
mM NaCI, 4.7 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgS04, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 20 mM Hepes/KOH, pH 7.4) containing 1 % (w/v) BSA, 100 μg/ml gentamycin, 100 mM 1-nnethyl-2-phenylethyladenosine, 0.5 U/nnI adenosine deaminase, 0.5 mM sodium pyruvate and 5 mM D-glucose in the presence of PIG(-P)/YCN (dissolved in 20 mM Hepes/KOH, pH 7.4, 2 mM DTT) at 37oC in a shaking water bath at constant bubbling with 5 % CO2/95 % O2 for the periods indicated. Treatment of Rat Adipocytes with Trypsin/NaCI or NEM<br>
For trypsin/NaCl-treatment, 2 ml of adipocyte suspension (3.5 x 105 cells/ml) in KRH :ontaining 5 mM glucose was incubated (20 nnin, 30°C) in the presence of 100 pg/ml trypsin. Soy bean trypsin inhibitor (final cone. 100 pg/ml) and 2 ml of KRH containing 1 M NaCI and 0.5 % BSA were added and the incubation (10 min, 22°C) continued. For NEM-treatment, 1 ml of adipocyte suspension (3.5 x 10® cells/ml) in KRH containing 5 mM glucose was incubated (30 min, 25°C) with NEM (1.5 mM final cone.) and then I with DTT (15 mM final conc, 5 min). After the treatments, the cells were centrifuged (1500 xg, 5 min, swing-out rotor) and the infranatant removed by suction. The cell suspension left (about 0.5 mi) was supplemented with 10 ml of KRH containing 0.5 % BSA and then centrifuged again (500 xg, 1 min, swing-out rotor). After two additional washing steps, the final cell suspension was adjusted to 25 ml of KRH containing 0.5 % BSA, 50 μM glucose and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. 0.2 ml portions were assayed for lipigenesis to monitor the loss of responsiveness toward PIG41. Control cells were subjected to the same centrifugation and washing procedures as the treated cells with H2O replacing trypsin/NaCI. For radiolabeling of adipocytes with [14C]NEM, the cell suspension was centrifuged (500 xg, 1 min) and the infranatant removed. 50-pl portions (7 X 10^ cells/ml) v/ere incubated (10 min, 30°C) with 2.5 pCi["^C]NEM in a total volume of 60 pi. After addition of 5 pi of 10 mM DTT and 55 pi of KRH containing 10 mM glucose, the trypsin/NaCI-treatment was performed as described above in a total volume of 200 pi. 50-pl portions were carefully layered over 20Q-pl oil layers consisting of dinonyl phthalate in 0.4-ml centrifugation tubes. After centrifugation (5,000 xg, 15 sec), the tubes were cut through the oil layer. Proteins of the medium contained in the lower part of the tubes were precipitated (10 % TCA, two acetone washes), suspended in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.<br><br>
Preparation of Plasma Membranes, Total Cell Lysates and Micosomes<br>
Postnuclear infranatant was prepared from isolated rat adipocytes as described previously. For preparation of plasma membranes, 1 ml portions were layered on top of 5 ml cushions of 38 % (w/v) sucrose, 25 mM Tris/HCI (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, and centrifuged (110,000 xg, 1 h). The membranes at the interface between the two layers (0.5 ml) were removed by suction, diluted with four volumes of homogenization butter, and layered on top of an 8 ml cushion of 28 % Percoll, 0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 25 mM Tris/HCI (pH 7.0). After centnfugation (45,000 xg, 30 min), the plasma membranes were withdrawn from the lower third of the gradient (0.5 ml) with a Pasteur pipette, diluted with 10 volumes of homogenization buffer and centrifuged (200,000 xg, 90 min). For binding studies, the washed pellet was suspended in binding buffer at 1-2 mg protein/ml. For preparation of total cell lysates, the postnuclear infranatant was supplemented with deoxycholate and Nonidet P-40 (final conc. 0.3 and 0.2 %, -espectively), incubated (1 h, 4"C) and finally centrifuged (100,000 xg, 1 h, 4°C). The supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation. For preparation of microsomes, the Dostnuclear supernatant was centrifuged (100,000 xg, 1 h, 4°C). The pellet was suspended in binding buffer at 1-2 mg protein/ml.<br>
^reparation of hcDIGs/lcDIGs	<br>
urified pelleted plasma membranes (0.5 - 1 mg) were suspended in 1.5 ml of ice-cold 0.5 M Na2C03 (pH 11) containing 50 mM NaF, 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10 μM okadaic acid, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 20 μM ieupeptin, 5 μM pepstatin, 1 ΜM aprotinin, 5 mM iodoacetate, 200 μM PMSF, 1 mM EDTA and incubated (1 h, 4oC under repeated vortexing and suction with a pipette). The suspension was then mixed with an equal volume of 85 % sucrose in 15 mM MES/KOH (pH 6.5), 75 mM NaCI and overlaid with 1.5 ml cushions each of 42.5, 35, 28, 22, 15 and 5 % sucrose in the same medium, and centrifuged (230,000 xg, Beckman SW41 rotor, 18 h). The light-scattering opalescent bands of flocculent material at the 15-22 % (fractions 4 and 5) and 28-35 % (fractions 8 and 9) sucrose interfaces as well as the matenal of the 42.5 % cushions (fractions 12-15) were collected as hcDIGs, IcDIGs and solubilized plasma<br><br>
membrane proteins, respectively, using a 19-gauge needle and a syringe (0.75 ml per fraction). Density was determined by measuring the refractive index of the fractions. hc/lcDIGs were characterized by enrichment/deprivation of relevant markers as described previously. For binding studies, hc/lcDiGs were suspended in binding buffer " (15 mM Mes/KOH, pH 6.5, 0.25 M sucrose, 75 mM NaCI, 2 mM MgCb, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, protease inhibitors).<br>
Binding of Radiolabeled YCN-PIG or IcGcelp to Subcellular Fractions<br>
10 pi of radiolabeled YCN-PIG or IcGcel p (60,000-80,000 dpm/nmol, final conc. 5 pM) was added to 40 pi of suspended plasma membranes, microsomes or hc/lcDIGs (40-80 pg of protein) in binding buffer in the absence or presence of unlabeled competitor (as indicated in the figure legends) in a total volume of 100 μl and incubated (30 min,  4°C). For separation of membranes from the incubation medium, 45 μl aliquots were carefully layered over 200 μl oil layers consisting of dibutyl phthalate and dioctyl phthalate (1/1 by vol., final density 1.012) in case of plasma membranes/microsomes or dibutyl phthalate and dinonyl phthalate (1/9 by vol., final density 9.863) in case of hc/lcDIGs in 0.4 ml precooled (4""C) centrifugation tubes (microtubes no. 72.700, Sarstedt, Germany). After centrifugation (48,000 xg, 2 min), the tubes with caps closed were cut through the oil layer and the lower and upper parts of the tubes (with caps removed) containing the pelleted plasma membranes/microsomes and the floating hc/lcDlGs, which did or did not penetrate the oil layer, respectively, transferred into 10 ml scintillation vials containing 1 ml of 10 % SDS. After rigorous shaking (16 h, 25°C), the radioactivity was counted in 9 ml of ACSII scintillation cocktail (Beckman). Under these conditions, sticking to the tube walls and partitioning into the oil layer of both radiolabeled YCN-PIG and IcGcel p accounted for 50-120 dpm (i.e. less than 0.5 % of total radioactivity used per incubation) and therefore was not considered for calculation of binding data. Typical recoveries of plasma membranes and microsomes were 78-85 % and<br>
65-80 %, respectively, and of hcDIGs and IcDIGs 83-92 % and 70-78 %, respectively, according to protein determination.<br><br>
Chemical Synthesis of PIG(-P)<br>
Hydrophilic GPI structures can be generated from natural sources by two experimental approaches: (i) PIG released by G="l-specific PLC/D from free GPI lipids as their polar core glycan head groups and therefore tacking any amino ac:ds and (ii) PIG-P generated by combined lipolytic and proteolytic cleavages frcm a GPI protein yielding the polar core glycan head group together with one to several amino acids derived from the carboxy-terminus of the GPI protein left. Both GPI lipids and GPI proteins reside in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of eucaryotic cells with the core glycan head groups conserved from yeast to man. For assaying binding of the GPI core glycan head group, the disclosure of synthesis of a radiolabeled authentic PIG(-P) structure as described in "Muller et al., Endocrinology 138, 3459-3475, 1997"; was used; YCN-PIG prepared from the radiochemically pure GPI protein, Gcelp, of the plasma membrane from S. cerevisiae, which had been metabolically labeled with myo-[^"*C]inositol, by sequential proteolytic and lipolytic cleavages in vitro. For assessing the structure-activity relationship for binding, chemically synthesized YCN-PIG and derivatives thereof were used. (Fig. 1: YCN-PIG; Fig. 2: YMN-PIG; Fig. 3: PIG37; Fig. 4: YCN)<br>
Synthesis of the tripeptide of YCN-PIG was performed by means of state of the art peptide synthesis. The hexasaccharide was synthesized using the trichloroacetimide method as described in "Frick et al., Biochemistry 37, 13421-13436; 1998". The critical step in synthesis of PIG-P turned out to be the formation of the phosphodiester bond. Among various procedures tested the H-phosphonate method produced the most yield.<br>
Deprotection of the final compounds was performed under sodium in liquid NH3 enforced by the presence of cysteine (no hydration possible with palladium) and acid-labile cyclic phosphate. All compounds were characterized by mass, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and 31P-NMR spectroscopy.<br>
PIG(-P) Specifically Bind to hcDIGs<br><br>
Total plasma membranes prepared from unstimulated adipocytes by differential centrifugation were enriched (vs. total cell lysates) for specific marker enzymes of the plasma membrane. Quabain-sensitive p-nitrophenylphosphatase (corresponding to the catalytic subunit of the Na*/K*-ATPase) was enriched 9.5-fold and Nuc 10.9-fold (according to enzymic activities), β1-integrin 13.9-fold and syntaxin-1   16.4-fold {according to immunoblotting) and Gce1  7.8-fold (according to photoaffinity labelling). Simultaneously, the plasma membrane preparation was depnved (vs. total cell lysates) of the sarcoplasmic reticulum marker, EGTA-sensitive Ca2+-adenosine triphosphatase 5.7-fold and of the endosomal markers, SCAMP (Secretary Carrier Membrane Protein) 37/39 8.5-fold and GLUT4 (Glucose Transporter 4) 16.9-fold (according to immunoblotting). Microsomes from unstimulated adipocytes were enriched vs. total cell lysate for GLUT4 by 14.4-fold, SCAMP 37/39 by 8.5-fold, transfernn receptor by 6.9-fold and IGFIl receptor by 9.7-fold and depnved vs. total cell lysates of p-nitrophenyl¬phosphatase by 24.6-fold, Gcel by 12.5-fold, Nuc by 15.8-fold, fii-integrin by 39.5-foid and syntaxin-1 by 48.5-fold according to immunoblotting and of Ca^*-sensitive adenosine triphosphatase activity by 19.9-fold. This indicates that this fraction represented primarily endoplasmic reticulum and endosomal structures and was virtually devoid of plasma membranes and sarcoplasmic reticulum fragments. hsDIGs and IcDIGs were prepared from unstimulated adipocytes on basis of their insolubility in 0.5 M NazCOs (pH 11) and low buoyant density in sucrose density gradient centrifugation. They were characterized by their deprivation (vs. total plasma membranes) of GLUT4 and the insulin receptor l3)-subunit. hcDIGs and IcDIGs differed from one another in significantly higher enrichment of caveolin, pp59LYN and Gce1 in hcDIGs compared to IcDIGs.<br>
Isolated subcellular membrane fractions were incubated with increasing amounts of ■adiolabeled YCN-PIG and the incubation terminated by rapid separation from the ncubation medium by centrifugation through an oil layer of appropnate density.<br>
Membrane-associated YCN-PIG was recovered predominantly with hcDIGs in concentration-pependent and saturable fashion and to a minor degree with IcDIGs, whereas plasma membranes and microsomes were virtually devoid of radiolabel (Fig. 5). Within the linear range, unspecific binding of YCN-PIG to hcDlGs accounted for<br><br>
less than 20 % as assessed by the presence of a 500 fold excess of unlabeled synthetic YCN-PIG or other competitors (Fig. 5). The following experiments were performed using a concentration of YCN-PIG, corresponding to the end of the linear range of binding.<br>
Other methods for determination of receptor-Iigand interaction, such as rapid filtration and centrifugation on basis of sedimentation rather than density, failed to detect specific binding of YCN-PIG to any adipocyte membrane subfraction (data not shown), presumably due to the medium binding affinity and/or high dissociation rate. Scatchard plot analysis for YCN-PIG revealed a Kd in the range of 50nM-500nM and a Bmax of 50-200 pmol per mg protein of hcDIGs. The specificity of binding of YCN-PIG to hcDIGs was demonstrated by significantly reduced efficacy of the peptide variants, YMN-PIG and PIG37 lacking the peptidylethanolamidyl moiety, as well as the very low activity of -the peptidylethanolamidyl moiety, YCN, alone in the competition assay (Fig. 6).<br>
A combination of unlabeled YCN plus PIG37 (equimolar ratio) displaced binding of radiolabeled YCN-PIG to hcDIGs only slightly less efficiently than unlabeled YCN-PIG and more potently than either the PIG or peptidylethanolamidyl moiety alone as well as YMN-PIG. This finding demonstrates simultaneous and synergistic recognition of the PIG and peptidylethanolamidyl moieties. The iC50 for competition was just 3 to 4 fold higher for YCN plus P1G37 compared to covalently linked YCN-PIG (Fig. 6). Further it was studied whether the identified binding site for PIG(-P) is of proteinaceous nature. hcDIGs were pretreated with trypsin/NaCI or NEM and then incubated with increasing concentrations of radiolabeled YCN-PIG in the absence or presence of excess of unlabeled synthetic YCN-PIG (for evaluation of unspecific binding). Sequential treatment with trypsin and 0.5 M NaCI or treatment with NEM completely abrogated specific binding of radiolabeled YCN-PIG to hcDIGs, whereas trypsin or NaCl alone or NEM in the presence of DTT had no significant effect (Fig. 7). The identical inactivation pattern was observed for the lower affinity interaction of YCN-PIG with IcDIGs. These data demonstrate the existence of a trypsin/NaCI and NEM-sensitive binding protein for PIG(-P) at DIGs of the adipocyte cell surface. The preference of YCN-PIG for binding to hcDIGs compared to IcDIGs was confirmed by<br><br>
their conversion in course of cholesterol depletion of the adipocytes plasma membrane using m-βCD and subsequent analysis of hc/lcDIGs for specific binding of radiolabeled YCN-PIG. In control adipocytes, the major portion of YCN-PIG was recovered along with hcDIGs compared to 20 % left associated with IcDIGs (Fig. 8). However, treatment of intact rat adipocytes with m-(3.CD (1-10 mM) revealed a concentration-dependent decline in the amount of YCN-PIG bound to hcDIGs accompanied by corresponding increase at IcDIGs. Trypsin/NaCI or NEM treatment of the adipocytes after cholesterol depletion but before preparation of the DIGs significantly impaired specific binding of YCN-PIG to both hcDIGs and IcDIGs (data not shown). These findings demonstrate the predominant location of the<br>
PIG{-P) receptor in hcDIGs of rat adipocytes the formation of which critically depends on cholesterol.<br>
A Lipolytically Cleaved GPI Protein Specifically Binds to hcDIGs<br>
The PIG moiety, -NH-(CH2)2-0-PO(OH)0-6Mana1(Mana1-2)-2Mana1-6Mana1-4GluN1-6lno-1,2-(cyclic)-phosphate, of YCN-PIG, YMN-PIG and PIG37 (Fig. 1, 2 and 3) is identical to the polar core glycan head group of all eucaryotic GPI proteins. Consequently, it was studied whether the proteinaceous binding site for PIG-P interacts with IcGPI proteins, i.e. whether it recognizes the PIG(-P) moiety if attached to the complete polypeptide portion of a GPI protein. In order to obtain a radiolabeled IcGPI protein, Gce1p from metabolically labeled S. cerevisiae cells was treated with Pl-specific PLC (B. cereus) and the hydrophilic cleavage product purified to radiochemical homogeneity. Using the same oil-centnfugation-method as for PIG(-P), it was found that IcGcel p associated with DIGs from isolated rat adipocytes in a concentration-dependent and saturable fashion with hcDIGs being 11- to 15-fold more efficient than IcDIGs. Unspecific binding in the presence of a 200 fold molar excess of unlabeled IcGcel p accounted for less than 15 % of the total IcGcel p recovered with DIGs at non-saturating concentrations of IcGcel p. According to Scatchard plot analysis, the Kd for IcGcel p binding to hcDIGs is in the range of 0.1 - 1 1 μM with Bmax of 70 - 200 pmol per mg protein of hcDIGs. Total plasma membranes and microsomes did not exhibit specific binding of IcGcel p. Thus, hcDIGs of the<br><br>
adipocyte plasma membranes apparently harbor specific binding sites for IcGcelp from yeast. For further analysis of the identity of the binding sites for PIG(-P) and IcGPI proteins as indicated by the similar Kd and Bmax values, the relative affinities of the synthetic PIG(-P) compounds for the IcGcelp binding site at hcDIGs were compared in competition studies (Fig. 9),<br>
The binding of radiolabeled IcGcel p to hcDIGs was displaced by excess (more than 500 fold) of labeled synthetic YON-PIG, YMN-PIG and YCN plus PIG37 by more than 75 % of total IcGcelp bound confirming the specificity of the interaction of IcGcelp with hcDIGs. Competition of IcGcelp binding with PIG37 and YCN was considerably less efficient. The relative ranking of the different PIG(-P) as reflected in their apparent IC50 for displacing IcGcel p from hcDIGs was YCN-PIG&gt;YCN+P1G37&gt; YMN-PIG&gt;PIG37&gt;YCN and is, thus, identical to that for interference with YCN-PIG binding (Fig. 6). Moreover, the apparent IC50 values were very similar for competition of IcGcelp and YCN-PIG binding arguing that in both cases the same determinants are recognized and the residual protein moiety of the GPI protein (except of the carboxy-terminal tripeptidylethanolamidyl residue) does not contribute to binding. Next the sensitivity of the interaction of IcGcelp with hcDIGs toward trypsin/NaCI- and NEM-treatment of intact rat adipocytes was studied under conditions which almost completely disrupted binding of radiolabeled YCN-PIG (Fig. 7). hcDIGs from tirypsin/NaCI- as well as NEM-treated adipocytes displayed association of radiolabeled IcGcel p not exceeding unspecific binding in the presence of a 500 fold excess of unlabeled YCN-PIG (which accounts for about 30 % of total Gce1p recovered with hcDIGs from untreated control cells) (Fig. 10). In contrast, incubation of the adipocytes with NEM in the presence of excess of DTT (Fig. 10) or with either trypsin or NaCI alone (data not shown) did not impair binding of radiolabeled IcGcelp and its competition by 3 pM YCN+PIG37, 5μM PIG37 and 10 μM YCN compared to untreated cells. Taken together, the specific binding sites for YCN-PIG and IcGcel p display very similar characteristics with regard to localization at hcDIGs of the adipocyte plasma membrane, absolute and relative affinities (to structural derivatives), expression level and sensitivity tov/ard both trypsin/NaCI and NEM.<br><br>
Endogenous Ligands for the Receptor for PIG(-P) and IcGPI Proteins<br>
Candidates for physiological ligands of the apparently identical binding sites for PIG(-P) and IcGPI proteins are uncleaved GPI structures, i.e. GPI lipids and/or GPI protein anchors. To test this possibility, isolated rat adipocytes were subjected to treatment with various GPI-specific PLs and subsequent salt wash (0.5 M NaCI) prior to preparation of hcDIGs in order to specifically remove putative endogenous GPI molecules which interact with the receptor and thereby mask the binding sites for YCN-PIG/lcGce1p.<br>
Incubation of rat adipocytes with increasing concentrations of Pl-specific PLC from B. cereus or GPI-specific PLD from human serum resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in the amounts of radiolabeled YCN-PIG and Gce1p which specifically bind to hcDIGs (Fig. 11). The efficiency of the lipolytic digestions was demonstrated in parallel by the loss of Gce1 p and Nuc from hcDIGs.<br>
Their losses by 75 and 65 %, respectively, correlated with the increase in binding of YCN-PIG or IcGcel p to hcDIGs by 200 and 260 %. The specificity of the GPI cleavages was demonstrated by the complete failure of PC-specific PLC (B. cereus) and PLD from cabbage (which do not attack GPI structures) to significantly displace Gce1 or Nuc from hcDIGs as well as to stimulate YCN-PIG (IcGcel p) binding to hcDIGs (Fig. 11,12). Scatchard plot analysis of specific binding to hcDIGs from Pl-specific PLC-prepreated adipocytes (unspecific binding was not significantly altered) revealed that the increased association of radiolabeled YCN-PIG/lcGcelp was mainly due to the 2 to 3 fold higher Bmax with almost unaltered Kd. These findings demonstrate that about 50 % of the binding sites for PIG(-P) or IcGPI proteins at hcDIGs in isolated rat adipocytes in the basal state are occupied by endogenous GPI structures cleavable by (G)PI-specific PLC/D. Remarkably, insulin at a physiological concentration mimicked the effect of GPI-specific PLC/D treatment in rat adipocytes to a certain degree causing a moderate, but significant, decline in the amounts of Gcel p and Nuc in hcDIGs, Insulin-induced loss of GPI proteins from hcDIGs led to marked increase of binding capacities for YCN-PIG or IcGcel p (Fig. 11, 12).<br><br>
Furthermore, it could be demonstrated that the receptor for PIG(-P) and IcGPI proteins<br>
is identical to the trypsin/NaCl and NEM-sensitive 115kDa protein which was called<br>
CIR.<br>
Binding cf PIG-P to the receptor will affect its accessibility to subsequent covalent<br>
modification by NEM and/or cleavage and release from the adipocyte cell surface by<br>
trypsin/NaCI.<br>
Rat adipocytes were incubated with PIG(-P) and then sequentially subjected to<br>
labeling with [14"C]NEM and treatment with trypsin/NaCI. Analysis of the released<br>
radiolabeled polypeptides by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging revealed (Fig. 13) that<br>
PIG(-P) reduced crosslinking of a 115kDa polypeptide by [14CINEM and/or its recovery<br>
from the infranatant of adipocytes after trypsin/NaCI-treatment. The reduction by YCN-<br>
PIG or PIG37 at 3 pM and YCN at 30 μM was 83, 65 and 28 %, respectively,<br>
compared to control cells. This protein represented the only major NEM-labeled<br>
component which was released from plasma membranes by trypsin/NaCI but not by<br>
either treatment alone (Fig. 13) and is identical with CIR. In agreement with<br>
experimental evidence for the existence of endogenous ligands (e.g. GPI proteins) and<br>
their removal from the corresponding binding site by lipolytic cleavage (see Fig. 11,<br>
12), treatment of adipocytes with exogenous Pl-specific PLC (B. cereus) or insulin<br>
slightly but reproducibly stimulated the trypsin/NaCI-dependent release of [14C]NEM-	<br>
labeled CIR by 30 and 20 %, respectively (Fig. 13). Since the relative ratio of release of CIR from the adipocyte cell surface by trypsin/NaCI- vs. trypsin- vs. NaCl-treatment (100/20/10) was roughly comparable in control, PIG(-P)-stimulated and PLC/insulin-treated cells, binding of PIG(-P) and endogenous GPI ligands to hcDlGs apparently impairs labeling of CIR by NEM rather than its tryptic cleavage. This is caused by a conformational change in CIR elicited by the interaction of ligands with the PIG(-P) receptor at hcDIGs of the adipocyte plasma membrane.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
