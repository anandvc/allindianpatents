Gibbereliins are a series of naturally occurring compounds, which are known as plant growth regulators with wide application in the plant kingdom [1]. They have also been isolated from metabolites of some microorganisms, such as Gibberella fujikuroi [2]. Gibbereliins, especially Gibberellic Acid (Gibberellin A3), and its mixture with Gibberellin A4 and/or Gibberellin Ay which are commercially available, have been extensively applied in agriculture to increase the growth of some fruits (strawberries and grapes) and vegetables (tomatoes, cabbages and cauliflowers), also as food additive in the malting of barley [3].

We have now found application of Gibberellin or its derivatives for the treatment of diabetes including type 1 and type 2 diabetes and their related conditions.<br>
Disclosure of the invention:<br>
It has now been found that Gibberellins possess mammalian growth factor (such as IGF, EGF) like properties in our laboratory.<br>
The experimental results (examples 3 and 4) suggested that Gibberellins, which are generated by plants and microbes, act as broad-spectrum binders binding to a range of growth factor receptors. They differ from the growth factors found in animals, each of which has a high affinity for a specific receptor. This is the result of evolution. The biological systems of plants and microbes produce biological substances acting on a broader (less specific) base than that of the more complex life forms such as animals.<br>
Since Gibberellins are smaller molecules than growth factors, the binding of Gibberellins on the growth factor receptors is probably weaker. In the presence of low level of growth factors, Gibberellins bind to vacant growth factor receptors to stimulate cell growth and other functions. Under this condition, Gibberellins perform the functions of the growth factors. In the presence of normal level of growth factors, the growth factors bind to their receptors more<br><br>
readily due to their higher affinity for those receptor sites. The physical bulkiness of these growth factors leaves no room or very little room at the receptor sites for which Gibberellins can bind. This results in Gibberelllns being ineffective when growth factors with sufficient binding affinity are present in sufficient quantities. This mechanism provides a very good profile for Gibberellins acting as a substitute or sensitizer for growth factors including IGF since the presence of excess Gibberellins will not interfere with the normal functions of these growth factors.<br>
Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disorder manifested by hyperglycemia and altered lipid and protein metabolism. According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 13 million people in the U.S. suffer from diabetes, and each year some 650,000 new cases are identified. The introduction of insulin and of sulfonyl ureas represented important landmarks in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Insulin like growth factor - 1 (IGF-1), a molecule with structure homology to insulin, has its own specific receptor, the type-1 IGF receptor, through which it elicits a variety of metabolic effects that are similar to insulin. The discovery of the active region of human growth factor responsible for the Insulin like actions of the molecule has led to the development of new anti-diabetic peptide agents. In addition, growth factors are polypeptides that regulate the replication, differentiation and metabolic homeostasis cells. They increase the growth and/or survival of neurons. In pre-clinical testing for the treatment of various neurological disorders including diabetic neuropathies, lGF-2 increased the rate of nerve regeneration. Furthermore, elevated Intracellular concentrations of c-AMP potentiate glucose-dependent insuJin secretion from pancreatic 3-cells. Gibberellins have been found to increase the activity of adenylate and gryanylate cyclase, so that the intracellular concentrations of c-AMP and c-GMP may be increased by the administration of Gibberellins to potentiate in turn glucose-dependent insulin secretions from pancreatic Î²-cells. Gibberellins may thus be seen to have application in the treatment of diabetes.<br>
The animal experiment results (examples 5 &amp; 6) showed diabetic rats treated with 5mg/kg of Gibberellin A3 or a mixture of A3 and A4 or A7 returned<br><br>
their serum glucose level to the normal, as well as thier body  weights ,it<br>
indicated that Gibberellins may be effective in the treatment of diabetes.<br><br>
The toxicity to mammals of Gibberellin A3 is extremely low. The acute oral LD50 for rats and mice is reported to be 6.3g/kg [7a] and &gt;15g/kg [7b] respectively. In 90-day feeding trials, the no effect level for rats and dogs was &gt;1g/kg/day [7b]. It is non-irritating to skin and eyes [7b]. No indication has been found of carcinogenicity [7c]. Classifications: WHO Toxicity Class Table 5 (least hazardous class product, unlikely to present acute hazard in normal use); EPA Toxcity class 111 (second least hazardous classification).<br>

Suitable carriers include cocoa butter and other materials commonly used in the art, and the suppositories may be conveniently formed by admixture of the active compound with the softened or melted carrier(s) followed by chilling and shaping in moulds.<br>
For administration to the respiratory tract (including intranasal administration) compounds of formula (1) may be administered by any of the methods and formulations employed in the art for administration to the respiratory tract.<br>
Thus in general the compounds of formula (1) may be administered in the form of a solution or a suspension or as a dry powder.<br><br>
Solutions and suspensions will preferably be aqueous for example prepared from water alone (for example sterile or pyrogen-free water) or water and a physiologically acceptable co-solvent (for example ethanol. propylene glycol, and polyethylene glycols such as PEG 400).<br>
Such solutions or suspensions may additionally contain other excipients for example preservatives (such as benzalkonium chloride), solubilising agents/surfactants such as polysorbates (e.g. Tween 80, Span 80, benzalkonium chloride), buffers, isotonicity-adjusting agents (for example sodium chloride), absorption enhancers and viscosity enhancers. Suspensions may additionally contain suspending agents (for example microcrystalline cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose sodium).<br>
Solutions or suspensions are applied directly to the nasal cavity by conventional means, for example with a dropper, pipette or spray. The formulations may be provided in single or multi-dose form. In the latter case a means of dose metering is desirably provided. In the case of a dropper or pipette this may be achieved by the patient administering an appropriate, predetermined volume of the solution or suspension. In the case of a spray this may be achieved for example by means of a metering atomizing spray pump.<br>
An aerosol formulation may also be used for the respiratory tract administration, in which the compounds of formula (1) are provided in a pressurized pack with a suitable propellant such as a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) for example dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane or dlchlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. The aerosol may conveniently also contain a surfactant such as lecithin. The dose of drug may be controlled by provision of a metered valve.<br>
Alternatively the compounds of formula (1) may be provided in the form of a dry powder, for example a powder mix of the compound in a suitable powder base such as lactose, starch, starch derivatives such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidine (PVP). Conveniently the powder carrier will form a gel in the nasal cavity. The powder composition may<br><br>
be presented in unit dose form for example in capsules or cartridges of e.g. gelatin or blister packs from v/hich the powder may be administered by means of an inhaler.<br>
In formulations intended for administration to the respiratory tract, including intranasal formulations, the compound will generally have a small particle size for example of the order of 5 microns or less. Such a particle size may be obtained by means known in the art, for example by micronisation.<br>
For administration to the gastrointestinal tract, the compounds of formula (1) or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative may be administered by any of the methods and formulations employed in the art for administration to the gastrointestinal tract.<br><br>
desired, formulations adapted to give sustained release of the<br><br>
 may be employed.<br>
 compounds of formula (1) may also be used in combination with other  therapeutic agents, for example anti-diabetic agents such as Insulin, IGF, or analgesics, anti-hypertensive agents, sedatives, hypnotics, lipid-lowering agents anti-infective agents and so on. The Invention thus provides in a further . a combination comprising the compounds of formula (1) or <br>
pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof together with another therapeutically active agent.<br>
The combinations mentioned above may conveniently be presented for use in the form of a pharmaceutical formulation and thus such formulations comprising a combination as defined above together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefore comprise a further aspect of the invention.<br>
The individual components of such combinations may be administered either sequentially or simultaneously in separate or combined pharmaceutical formulations.<br><br>
When the compounds of formula (1) are used with a second therapeutic agent active in treatment of diabetes and related conditions, the dose of each compound may either be the same as or differ from that employed when each compound is used alone. Appropriate doses will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
The compounds of formula (1) and their pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives may be prepared by any methods known in the art for the preparation of compounds of analogous structure.<br>
The present invention is further described by the following examples, which are for illustrative purpose only and should not be construed as a limitation of the invention.<br><br>
(b) Isolation: The fermentation broth (18 liter) was adjusted to pH 6.5-7.0 with 10% NaOH, then filtered off. The filter-cake (mycelium) was washed with 4L of H2O. The filtrate and washings were combined and vacuum evaporated to a volume of 2L. The concentrate was stirred at 5-10Â°C with ethyl acetate (5L) and adjusted to pH 1.5 with 6NHCI. Then two layers were separated. The lower aqueous layer was re-extracted with ethyl acetate (2L). The organic  extracts  were  combined,  and washed  with  water (2L),  then<br><br>
evaporated to 400ml. The concentrate was stirred and heated at 60~70Â°C for 3-4 hours until no more precipitation occurred. After cooling to room temperature, the suspension was filtered. The solid was washed with cold ethyl acetate and dried to afford Gibbereilin A3 and A4/A7 mixture as an off-white solid (45g). This mixture contains -80% A3, -4% A4 and -4% A7.<br>
(c) Purification: 10g of the mixture of Gibbereilin A3 and A4/A7, as mentioned above, was dissolved in a mixture of 15ml methanol containing 1ml H2O, and 30ml acetone. The solution was diluted with 100ml ethyl acetate containing 10ml of H2O. The mixture was filtered. The filtrate was vacuum evaporated to a volume of about 80ml. The mixture was stirred and heated at 60~80Â°C for 2-3 hours, then cooled to room temperature. It was filtered off. The solid was washed with cold ethyl acetate and dried to afford Gibbereilin A3 at &gt;95% purity as a white crystal (6.3g). MS: 391 (M-1+2Na)^ 369 (M+23)* 329 (M+I-H2O)*<br>
Example 2. Preparation of Gibbereilin A3 salts and esters.<br>
(a)	Preparation of Gibbereilin A3 sodium salt: A solution of 346mg (1 mmole) of Gibbereilin A3 was dissolved in 1.5mi of methanol, was added to a solution of NaHCOa (84mg, 1 mmole) in 2ml H2O. The whole mixture was evaporated under reduced pressure to dryness. The residue was then dissolved in water (2ml) and freeze dried to afford Gibbereilin A3 sodium salt was a white solid at quantitative yield.<br>
(b)	Preparation of Gibbereilin A3 zinc salt: 100mg of Gibbereilin A3 sodium salt was dissolved in 10ml water, then passed through a column (20ml) Dowex 50 Zinc ion form resin. The column was then washed with 30ml H2O. The effluent and washings were combined and vacuum evaporated to small volume, then freeze dried to afford Gibbereilin A3 zinc salt as a white solid at quantitative yield.<br>
(c)	Preparation of Gibbereilin A3 ethyl ester: 346mg (1 mmole) of Gibbereilin A3 was dissolved in a mixture of acetone (10ml) and water (0.2ml). To the<br><br>
mixture at -20Â°C, triethylamine (100mg, 1mmole), N-methyl morpholine (10mg. 0.1mmole), ethyl chloroformate (108mg, Immole) were added. The mixture was stirred at -15Â°C for 20 minutes, then diluted with anhydrous ethanol (10ml), The mixture was stinted at room temperature overnight, then evaporated to dryness. The residue was then partitioned between ethyl acetate (30ml) and water (5ml). The organic layer was separated and washed successively with 2% HCI (5ml), water (5ml), 5% NaHCOa (5ml x 2), water (5ml), then evaporated under reduced pressure to dryness to afford a colorless solid Gibberellin A3 ethyl ester (319mg, 85%) MS 375 (M+l)".<br>
Example 3.<br>
(a) Effect of Gibberellin A3 on cell growth compared to EOF in vitro.<br>
Human skin cell culture experiments were conducted by using keratinocytes media. Each well was seeded with 1,500 cells. Incubation was carried out at 37Â°C for a period of five days. The experiments are shown as follows:<br><br><br>
Experiments 3.1 and 3.3 indicated that EGF (Epidermal Growth Factor) is essential for cell growth. Experiment 2 indicated that the presence of both EGF and Gibberellin A3 had no additive effect on the rate of cell growth. Experiment 4 gave an indication that Gibberellin A3 alone can stimulate cell growth as effectively as EGF.<br>
(b) Effect of Gibberellin A3 compared to IGF on cell culture growth using IGF-1 replace the EGF for the cell culture experiment, mentioned in (a). The results were similar to the results in (a).<br>
Example 4.<br>
The effect of a mixture of Gibberellin A3 with Gibberellins A4 and/or A7 was compared to that of IGF-1 on the cell growth in vitro. The results were similar to . those in example 3(b).<br>
Example 5. Effect of Gibberellin A3 on diabetic rats.<br><br>
Methods:<br>
Male Wistar rats (290g~330g) were weighed and lightly anaesthetized (4% halothane, 2:1 O2/N2O) so that blood glucose levels could be measured via a tail vein sample, using a Precision Q.l.D. glucometer. Diabetes was then induced by a single tail vein injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 60mg/kg), which was dissolved immediately prior to use in citrate buffer (50mM citric acid and 50mM trisodium citrate; pH 4.5). An equivalent volume of citrate buffer was injected into age-matched control rats.<br>
Rats were housed in groups of two during the experiment. Animal house temperature was maintained at 20Â°C (+2Â°C) with a 12 hour light/dark cycle, and rats were allowed free access to food and water.<br>
Ethical approval for all experiments was obtained from the Pharmacology Animal Ethics Committee.<br>
Drug Administration and Daily Monitoring Protocol:<br>
Forty-eight hours after the administration of STZ (60mg/kg), a blood glucose sample was taken and animals with blood glucose levels &gt;16mM were considered to be diabetic. Rats were then randomly divided into groups.<br>
The slow-acting, Lente Monotard insulin was used and Gibberellin sodium salt was made up as required in distilled water immediately prior to use.<br><br><br><br>
Example 6. Effect of Gibberellin A3 and A4/A7 mixture on diabetic rats.<br>
The protocol of this experiment is the same as that in Example 5 but Gibberellin A3 and A4/A7 mixture was used instead of Gibberellin A3. The results were no dlfferent from those in Example 5.<br><br><br><br><br>
