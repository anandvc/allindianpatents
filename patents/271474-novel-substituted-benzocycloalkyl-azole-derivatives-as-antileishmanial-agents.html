Leishmaniases are parasitic diseases transmitted by the bite of the infect.~d female<br>
phlebotomine sand fly and manifest with visceral, cutaneous, and mucocutane~us forms.<br>
I<br>
They are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the developing coundies of the<br>
world, and they affect about 2 million people per annum (TOR-Leishmaniasis 2007 Update)<br>
mostly in tropical and subtropical regions, the geographical distribution being limited by the<br>
I<br>
. biotope of the insect vector (P.J. Guerin, P. Olliaro, S. Sundar, M. Boelaert, S.L.I Croft, P.<br>
I<br>
Desjeux, M.K.Wasunna, A.D. Bryceson, Lancet Infect. Dis. 2 (2002) 494-501). However,<br>
. ' ~<br>
official data underestimate the reality of the human affliction.<br>
Of the various types, visceral leishmaniasis (VL), known as kala-azar (black fever) .)r Assam<br>
',]<br>
fever is caused by Leishmania donovani and is transmitted by phlebotomine s1md flies<br>
i<br>
(Phlebtomus argentipes). VL is characterized by irregular bouts of fever, substanti~l weight<br>
loss, swelling of the spleen and liver, and anaemia (occasionally serious). If left untreated,<br>
I .<br>
• I<br>
the fatality rate in developing_ countries can be as high as I 00% within 2 years. It is _preval·ent<br>
mostly_ in eastern India and still remains problematic as early diagnosis is difftbult and<br>
treatment often results in drug resistance.<br>
Chemotherapy. for these parasitic diseases is generally ineffective. mainly duei<br>
1<br>
to the<br>
emergence of drug-resistant strains and toxicity of the therapeutic agents. The pentavalent<br>
2<br>
antimonials are widely used as pnmary therapy ·whereas alternative drtigs include<br>
I<br>
amphotericin B, pentamidine, paromomycin, and azoles. Azole antifungal drug3 have been<br>
used as antileishmanial agents since 1980s [J.A. Maertens, Clin. Microbiol. Infect. i 0 (2004)<br>
I<br>
1-10]. However, resistance to antimonials is common and treatments with amrhotericin B<br>
and pentamidine are plagued by severe toxic side effects. Newly introduced first drally active<br>
drug miltefosine is quite effective but shows teratogenic effects and cannot be used in the<br>
pregnant women. Though th~re have been commendable research efforts towards ~lucidating<br>
the basic biology of Leishmania parasites, little progress has been made in the field of<br>
therapeutic interest (F. Chappuis, S. Sunder,· H. Ghalib. S.Rijai., R. W. Peeling, i Alavaran,<br>
I<br>
M. Boelaert, Nature Reviews Microbiology 5, Nov. 2007). Drug resistance, high t::&gt;xicity and<br>
high treatment costs necessitate the need for novel therapeutics.<br>
In order to find new drugs with antileislunanial activity the aryloxy benzocycloa\kyl azoles<br>
I<br>
have been synthesized and screened in vitro (against promasdgote/ and intracellular<br>
amastigotes) and in vivo (against Leishmania donovani./Haemester model).<br>

Accordingly the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of new aryloxy<br>
benzocycloalkyl azoles of general formula 4.<br>
In general, the compounds of formula 4 may be prepared by chemical reactions<br>
analogously known in the art, the choice of any specific route of preparation being dependent<br>
7<br>
upon a variety of factors e.g. general availability and cost of reactants. In preparing these<br>
compounds standard procedures and techniques which are well known and appreciated by<br>
those of ordinary skill in the art are utilized. For example, compounds of for;:nula 4 can<br>
conveniently.be made according to the general synthetic route outlined in scheme 1, which<br>
comprises of reacting an appropriately substituted pyrrolidinylmethyl ketone 1 wherein R =<br>
H, Me, Cl, F, Br or OCH3; n = I or 2 with imidazole/ triazole in water alcohol mixture to<br>
give the azolylmethyl ketone (2) wherein X = H or N followed by reaction with sodium<br>
·:r--~<br>
borohydride to give the amino alcohol (3) with TRANS stereoselectivity (8.5: 1.5). The<br>
potassium derivative of the amino alcohol 3 which is formed \Jy reacting 3 with potassium<br>
tertiary butoxide (KtBuO) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is further reacted with<br>
appropriately substituted aryl fluoride in the presence of DMSO to give the corresponding<br>
. ~<br>
compound of the formula 4 wherein R'=H, 4-CFJ, 4-COCHJ or 4-NOz and isolating the<br>
compounds by conventional methods. The procedure generally results in the TRA).J'S isomer<br>
in substantially pure form.<br>
For example, compounds of the formula (4) can conveniently be made according to<br>
the general synthetic route outlined in scheme 1.<br>

For assessing the activity of compounds against the amastigote stage of the liparasite,<br>
I<br>
I mouse macrophage cell line (J-774A.l) infected with promastigotes expressing h,1ciferase<br>
I<br>
firefly reporter gene was used. Cells were seeded in a 96-well plate (1.5x1 04cell/1 O~!Jllwell)<br>
in RPMI-1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum and the plates were incubated at 'iJoc in a<br>
!<br>
C02 incubator. After 24h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium cohtaining<br>
I<br>
I<br>
16<br>
. stationary-phase promastigotes (2.25x105/100J..tl/well). Promastigotes invades the<br>
macrophage and are transformed· into amastigote. The test material in appropriate<br>
concentrations (0.25-1 OJ..lg/ml). in complete medium was added after replacing the previous<br>
medium and the plates were incubated at 37°C in a C02 incubator for 72 hrs. After<br>
incubation, the drug-containing medium was decanted and 50J..ll PBS was added in each well<br>
and mixed with an equal volume of steady Glo reagent. After gentle shaking for 1-2 minute,<br>
the reading was taken in a luminometer. The inhibition of parasitic growth is determined by<br>
comparison· of the luciferase activity of drug treated parasites with that of untreated controls<br>
as described above.<br>
After assessing activity of compounds against amastigotes, Cytotoxicity assay were carried<br>
out using J-774 cell line.<br>
Cytotoxicity assay:<br>
The cell viability was determined using the MTT assay (Huber,W., Koella.J.C, Acta Tropica,<br>
55 (1993) 257-261). Exponentially growing cells J774.A-1 (1 x104cells /100J..tl/well) were<br>
incubated with different drug concentrations (30ng-1 00 J..lg/ml) for 72 hours and were<br>
incubated at 37°c in a humidified mixture of C02 and 95 % air in an incubator. Stock<br>
solutions of compounds were initially dissolved in DMSO and further diluted three fold with<br>
fresh complete medium. After incubation, 25 J..ll of MTT reagent (5mg/ml) in PBS medium,<br>
followed by syringe filtration, was added to each well and incubated at 3 7 °C for 2 hours. At<br>
the end of the incubation period, the supernatant is removed by. tilting plate completely<br>
without disturbing cell layer and 150 J..ll of pure DMSO were added to each well. After 15<br>
min. of shaking the readings were recorded as absorbance at 544 nm on a micro plate reader.<br>
The cytotoxic effects were expressed as 50% lethal dose, i.e. as the concentration of a<br>
comp.ound which provoked a 50% reduction in cell viability compared to cell in culture<br>
medium alone.<br>
Selective Index:<br>
The selective index (S.I.) were .calculated using the following equation<br>
S.I. = ICso (J-774 A-1 cells) I ICso (Leishmania amastigotes)<br>
In- Vivo Activity<br>
17<br>
The in-vivo ieishmanicidal activity was determined in golden hamsters (.Mesocricetus<br>
·auretus) infected with MHOM/IN/80/Dd8 strain of L. donovani obtained through the ccurtesy<br>
ofP.C.C. Garnham, Imperial College, London (U.K.) in 1979.<br>
For in-vivo evaluation of compounds, the method of Beveridge [S.Bevridge,In: R.J<br>
Shnitzer,F.I.Hanoking (Eds), Experimental Chemotherapy, vol.l ,(1963),257-280.] as<br>
modified by Bhatnagar et al. [S.Bhatnagar, P.Y.Guru, J.C.Katiyar, R.Srivastava,<br>
A.Mukherjee, M.S.Akhtar, M.Seth, A.P.Bhaduri, Ind.JMed.Res. 89(1989) 439.] and Gupta<br>
et al.[ S.Gupta, S.Tiwari, A.P.Bhaduri and G.K.Jain, Ada Tropica, 84(2002),165-173.] was<br>
employed.<br>
Golden hamsters (of either sex) weighing 40-45g were infected intracardially with 1x 107<br>
amastigotes per animal. The infection is well adapted to the hamster model and establishes<br>
itself in 15-20 days. Meanwhile, hamsters gain weight (65-75 g) and can be subjected to<br>
repeated spleen biopsies. Pretreatment spleen biopsy in all the animals was carried oot to<br>
assess the degree of infection. The animals with + 1 infection (5-15 amastigotes I 100 spleen<br>
cell nuclei) were included in the chemotherapeutic trials. The infecte~ animals are<br>
·randomized into several groups on the basis of their parasitic burdens. Four to six animals<br>
were used for each test sample. Drug treatment by i.p. route is initiated after 2 days of biopsy<br>
and continued for 10 consecutive days. Post-treatment biopsies are done on day 7 of the last<br>
drug administration and amastigote counts are assessed by Giemsa staining. In~enshy of<br>
infection in both , treated and untreated animals , as also the initial count in treated animals is<br>
compared and the efficacy is expressed in terms of percentage inhibition (PI) using the<br>
following formula:-<br>
PI= ANAT x 100/INAT x TIUC<br>
Where PI is Percent Inhibition of amastigotes multiplication<br>
ANA T is Actual Number of Amastigotes in Treated animals<br>
INAT is Initial Number of Amastigotes in Treated animals and<br>
TIUC is Times Increase of parasites in Untreated Control animals.<br>
The compounds synthesized were tested in Leishmania donovani m hamster model at<br>
50mg/kg x 10, i.p. dose as shown in Table-1.<br>
18<br>
Data of two replicates were pooled for calculation of mean percent inhibition.<br>
Standard drugs: Sodiurri stibogluconate (SSG) was used in each trial as experimental<br>
control.<br>
Data analysis<br>
1. IC50 were calculated by Probit analysis (Finney. D.J, Probit Analysis (1971),<br>
,Cambridge Univ. Press 3rdedn.).<br>
Criteria for significant activity:<br>
Compounds having IC5o  50 were picked<br>
up for in vivo evaluation.<br>
