				<td>The present invention relates to a method of making a light active sheet and a device thereof.<br>
The present invention pertains to a semiconductor roll-to-roll manufacturing method. The present invention also pertains to an inorganic light emitting diode light sheet and methods for manufacturing the same. More particularly, the present invention pertains to an inorganic light emitting diode light sheet that can be used as a photo-radiation source for applications including, but not limited to, general illumination, architectural lighting., novelty lighting, display backlighting, heads-up displays, commercial and roadway signage, monochromatic and full- color static and video displays, a radiation-source for photo-curable materials, patterned light emissive images, and the like. Further, the present invention pertains more particularly to an inorganic light active sheet that can be used as a light-to-energy device for converting photo-radiation to electrical energy for applications including, but not limited to, solar panels, CCD-type cameras, photo- sensors, and the like. Further, the present invention pertains more particularly, to methods for mass-producing the inventive light active sheet at relatively low cost. Inorganic light emitting diodes (LED) are based on elements of the periodic table of a vast variety. They come out of semiconductor technology, and indeed, a semiconductor diode such as a silicon diode, or a germanium diode were among the first semiconductor devices. These were made by doping the silicon or the germanium with a small amount of impurity to make n-type (excess electrons) or p-type (excess holes) in the material. LEDs emit light because of the materials selected so that the light is emitted in the ultra-violet, visible, or infrared ranges of the spectrum. The types of materials used are made from vapor deposition of materials on semiconductor wafers and cut into dice (a single one is a die). Typically, the die, or LED dice, are about 12 mil sq. The composition of the dice depends on the color, for example some red dice are AlInGaAs and some blue dice are InGaN. The variations are typically "three-five" variations, so-called because they vary based on the third and fifth period of the periodic table to provide the n- and p-type materials. <br>
The conversion of an LED die into an LED lamp is a costly process, involving very precise handling and placement of the tiny LED die. The LED dice are most simply prepared as 3 mm LED lamps. The die is robotically placed in a split cup with electrodes on each side. The entire structure is encased in a plastic lens that attempts to focus the beam more narrowly. High brightness dice may also be surface mounted with current-driving and voltage limiting circuits, and elaborate heat sink and heat removal schemes. Connection is by soldering or solderless ultrasonic wire bond methods. The result is a discrete point source of light. The LED lamp has a pair of leads, which can then be soldered to a printed circuit board. The cost of forming the lamp and then soldering the lamp to a printed circuit board is a relatively expensive process. Accordingly, there is a need to reduce the cost of forming alight emitting device based on the LED die.<br>
As an example application of LED lamps, it has recently been shown that ultraviolet LED lamps can be used to cure photo-polymerizable organic materials (see, for example, LoctiteÂ® 7700 Hand Held LED Light Source, Henkel-Loctite Corporation, Rocky Hill, CT).<br>
Photo-polymerizable organic materials are well known and are used for applications such as adhesives, binders and product manufacturing. Photo-polymerization occurs in monomer and polymer materials by the cross-linking of polymeric material. Typically, these materials are polymerized using radiation emitted from sources of light including intensity flood systems, high intensity wands, chambers, conveyors and unshielded light sources.<br>
As an example use of photo-polymerizable organic materials, precision optical bonding and mounting of glass, plastics and fiber optics can be obtained with photo-polymerizable adhesives. These materials can be used for opto-mechanical assembly, fiber optic bonding and splicing, lens bonding and the attachment of ceramic, glass, quartz, metal and plastic components.<br>
Among the drawbacks of the conventional systems that utilize photo-polymerizable organic materials is the requirement of ahigh intensity photo- radiation source. Typically, light sources, such as mercury vapor lamps, have been used to generate the radiation needed for photo-polymerization. However, these light sources are an inefficient radiation source because most of the energy put in to drive the lamp<br><br>
is wasted as heat. This heat must be removed from the system, increasing the overall bulk and cost. Also, the lamps have relatively short service life-times, typically around 1000 hours, and are very costly to replace. The light that is output from these light sources usually covers a much broader spectrum than the photo-radiation wavelengths that are needed for photo- polymerization. Much of the light output is wasted. Also, although the material can be formulated to be hardened at other wavelengths, the typical photo- polymerizable organic material is hardened at one of the peak output wavelengths of the mercury vapor lamp, to increase the polymerization efficiency. This peak output wavelength is in the UV region of the radiation spectrum. This UV radiation is harmful to humans, and additional shielding and protective precautions such as UV-filtering goggles are needed to protect the operators of such equipment<br>
Figure 66 is a side view of an inorganic LED die available. A conventional inorganic LED die is available from many manufacturers, typically has a relatively narrow radiation emission spectrum, is relatively energy efficient, has a long service life and is solid-state and durable. The die shown is an example of an AlGaAs/ AlGaAs red die, obtained from Tyntek Corporation, Taiwan. These dice have dimensions roughly 12 mil x 12 mil x 8 mil, making them very small point light sources. As shown in Figure 67, in a conventional LED lamp, this die is held in a metal cup so that one electrode of the die (e.g., the anode) is in contact with the base of the cup. The metal cup is part of an anode lead. The other electrode of the die (e.g., the cathode) has a very thin wire soldered or wire bonded to it, with the other end of the wire soldered or wire bonded to an anode lead. The cup, die, wire and portions of the anode and cathode leads are encased in a plastic lens with the anode and cathode leads protruding from the lens base. These leads are typically solder or wire bonded to a circuit board to selectively provide power to the die and cause it to emit light. It is very difficult to manufacture these conventional lamps due to the very small size of the die, and the need to solder or wire bond such a small wire to such a small die electrode. Further, the plastic lens material is a poor heat conductor and the cup provides little heat sink capacity. As the die heats up its efficiency is reduced, limiting the service conditions, power efficiency and light output potential of the lamp. The bulkiness of the plastic lens material and the need to solder or wire bond the lamp<br><br>
leads to an electrical power source limits emissive source packing density and the potential output intensity per surface area There is a need for a photo-radiation source that is energy efficient, generates less heat, is low cost and that has a narrow spectrum of radiation emission. There have been attempts to use inorganic light emitting diode lamps (LEDs) as photo- radiation sources. Usually, these LEDs are so-called high brightness UV radiation sources. A typical LED consists of a sub-millimeter sized die of light emitting material that is electrically connected to an anode lead and a cathode lead. The die is encased within a plastic lens material. However, the processing that takes the LED dice and turns it into an LED lamp is tedious and sophisticated, mostly due to the very small size of the LED die. It is very difficult to solder or wire bond directly to the dice, and so it is common practice to use LED lamps that are then solder or wire bonded onto a circuit board. Conventionally, UV LED lamps have been solder or wire bonded onto a circuit board in a formation to create a source of photo-radiation for photo-polymerizable organic materials.<br>
This solution is far from optimum, since the relatively high cost of the LED lamps keeps the overall cost of the photo-radiation source high. There is a need for a photo-radiation source that can use the LED dice directly, without the need for the lamp construction or a direct solder or wire bonded connection between the anode and cathode of the die. Such as system would have an efficient die packing density, enabling a high-intensity photo-radiation source having a narrow emission band.<br>
Wantanabe et al., published patent application US2004/0195576A1, teaches a device and method for forming a transparent electrode over the light-emitting portion of an LED die. This reference is concerned with overcoming the difficulty of forming an electrode accurately at the light output surface of a minute LED device (10 square microns). A conventional LED is 300 square microns. The reference states that forming a transparent electrode on a semiconductor device so as not to shield emitted light is already known. The crux of the Wantanabe invention is to form a transparent electrode directly and specifically over the light output face of a tiny LED device, or an array of such devices, instead of the conventional bonding or soldering of an opaque wire to connect the LED device to a power supply line or lead. To form the transparent electrode on such a small device, this reference teaches the use of semiconductor and/or printed circuit board techniques,<br><br>
An example of the steps of forming the Wantanabe device consist of: 1) Providing a substrate 2) Forming p-side wiring on the substrate 3) Transferring a light emitting diode onto the substrate so the p side of the diode is connected to the -wiring 4) Forming an insulation resin layer to cover the substrate, wiring and diode 5) Selectively removing the insulation resin to expose the n-side surfaces of the diode 6) Forming n-side wiring on the surface of the insulation resin 7) Forming a transparent electrode connecting the n-side of the diode to the n-side wiring<br>
The steps for forming the transparent electrode are: 7a) Forming a resist film to cover the insulation resin and the exposed n-side surfaces 7b) Selectively removing the resist layer to form an opening portion defining the light output surface of the diode and the n-side wiring 7c) Applying an electrode paste to the opening portion and the resist film 7d) Removing the electrode paste from the resist film to leave electrode paste only where the opening portion is so that the light output surface of the diode and the n-side wiring are connected.<br>
There are variations disclosed to the various steps and materials used, but in essence, the same cumbersome PCB-type processes are described in each of the examples. This reference shows that it is known to form a transparent electrode using PCB techniques on the light output surface of a diode to reduce the shielding of light emitted from the diode. But, replacing the conventionally-used opaque wire with a transparent electrode film is not new and is in the public domain (see, Lawrence et al, US Patent 4,495,514).<br>
Oberman, US Patent No. 5,925,897, teaches using a diode powder between conductive contacts, forming a conductor/emissive layer/conductor device structure. The diode powder consists of crystal particles 10-100 microns in size. The diode powder is formed by heating a mixture of In and Ga in a crucible and flowing nitrogen gas over the heated mixture. This powder now contains all n- rype material. The powder is adhered to a glass plate that is coated with an appropriate contact metal. A p-type dopant is diffused into the powder crystals to form a p-region and the p-n diode junction. A top substrate with a transparent conductive surface is placed on the powder and the entire structure thermally annealed to enhance the adhesion of the powder to the upper contact, Oberman states that the conventional LED is typically fabricated by connecting electrical contacts to the p and n regions of individual dies,<br><br>
and enclosing the entire LED die in a plastic package. Oberman's diode powder is specifically based on an observation that surfaces, interfaces and dislocations appear to not adversely affect the light emitting properties oflH-V nitrides. This reference says that the state-of-the-art nitride LED is grown on a sapphire substrate, and since sapphire is non-conducting, both electrical contacts are made from the top of the structure.<br>
Wickenden et al., US Patent No. 4,335,501, teaches a method for manufacturing a monolithic LED array. The individual LEDs are formed by cutting isolation channels through a slice of n-lype material. The channels are cut in two steps, a first step is cutting a gap into the back of the slice ofh-type material and then this gap is filled with glass. Then, in a second step the front of the slice is cut to complete the channel and the front cut is also filled with glass. Once the isolation W channels have been formed, the tops of the remaining blocks of n-type material are doped to become p-type and the n-p junction of each LED formed. Beam leads are formed connecting the p-regions of the LEDs.<br>
Nath, et si, WO92/06144 and US 5, 273, 608, teaches a method for laminating thin film photovoltaic devices with a protective sheet. The method provides the encapsulation of thin-film devices such as flexible solar cells within atop insulating substrate and a bottom insulating substrate. Nath's description o&gt;f the relevant prior art shows that encapsulating thin film devices between insulating sheets is not new. This reference teaches that the use of a heated roller is undesirable. 3Sfath's invention is to a specific method that heats a whole roll of composite material all at once to avoid the use of heated rollers. Nam teaches a new method for protecting and encapsulating thin film devices. Encapsulating thin film devices between insulating sheets is not new, but Nath teaches a specific method that avoids the use of heated rollers.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is intended to overcome the drawbacks of the prior art. It is an object of tie present invention to provide methods for manufacturing solid-state light active devices. It is another object of the present invention to provide device structures for solid-state light active devices. It is still another object of the<br><br>
present invention to provide a photo-radiation source for the selective polymerization of photo-radiation-curable organic material. It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a method of making a light sheet material. It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a method of manufacturing an encapsulated semiconductor circuit using a roll-to-roll fabrication process.<br>
The present invention pertains to a method of making a light active sheet A bottom substrate having an electrically conductive surface is provided. A hotmelt adhesive sheet is provided. Light active semiconductor elements, such as LED die, are embedded in the hotmelt adhesive sheet. The LED die each has a top electrode and a bottom electrode. A top transparent substrate is provided having a transparent conductive layer. The hotmelt adhesive sheet with the embedded LED die is inserted between the electrically conductive surface and the transparent conductive layer to form a lamination. The lamination is run through a heated pressure roller system to melt the hotmelt adhesive sheet and electrically insulate and bind the top substrate to the bottom substrate. As the hotmelt sheet is softened, the LED die breakthrough so that the top electrode comes into electrical contact with the transparent conductive layer of the top substrate and the bottom electrode comes into electrical contact with the electrically conductive surface of the bottom substrate. Thus, the p and n sides of each LED die are automatically connected to the top conductive layer and the bottom conductive surface. Each LED die is encapsulated and secured between the substrates in the flexible, hotmelt adhesive sheet layer. The bottom substrate, the hotmelt adhesive (with the embedded LED die) and the top substrate can be provided as rolls of material. The rolls are brought together in a continuous roll fabrication process, resulting in a flexible sheet of lighting material.<br>
This simple device architecture is readily adaptable to a high yield, low cost, roll- to-roll fabrication process. Applicants have proven the device architecture and method are effective by making many proof-of-concept prototypes. Figure 119 shows photographs of working prototypes constructed in accordance with the inventive method for manufacturing an inorganic light sheet. Figure 128Ca) is a photograph showing a step of the proof-of-concept prototype construction, this photo shows an active layer sheet comprised of LED die embedded in a sheet of hotmelt adhesive, the LED die being red emitting and yellow emitting. Figure 128(b) is a photograph<br><br>
showing another step of the proof-of-concept prototype construction, this photo shows the three constituent layers - active layer sheet (LED die embedded in a sheet of hotmelt adhesive), atop substrate (ITO coated PET) and a bottom substrate (ITO coated PET). Figure 128(c) is a photograph showing another step ofthe proof-of-concept prototype construction, this photo shows the three constituent layers with the active layer between the substrates to form an assembly. Figure 128(d) is a photograph showing another step ofthe proof-of-concept prototype construction, this photo shows the assembled lamination being passed through a heat laminator to activate the hotmelt sheet by melting between pressure rollers.<br>
Applicants have discovered that as the hotmelt sheet is softened, the LED dice breakthrough the adhesive so that the top electrode comes into electrical contact with the transparent conductive layer ofthe top substrate and the bottom electrode comes into electrical contact with the electrically conductive surface ofthe bottom substrate. Thus, the p and n sides of each LED die are automatically connected to the top conductive layer and. the bottom conductive surface. Each LED die is completely encapsulated within the hotmelt adhesive and the substrates. In addition, the LED dice are each permanently secured between the substrates in the flexible, hotmelt adhesive sheet layer. Figure 128 (e) is a photograph showing the just constructed proof-of-concept prototype being applied a voltage of a polarity and lighting up the yellow LED die. Figure 128(f) is a photograph showing trie just constructed proof-of-concept prototype being applied a voltage ofthe opposite polarity and lighting up the red LED die.<br>
In accordance with an aspect ofthe present invention, a method of making a light active sheet is provided. A "bottom substrate having an electrically conductive surface is provided. An electrically insulative adhesive is provided. Light actrve semiconductor elements, such as LED die, are fixed to the electrically insulative adhesive. The light active semiconductor elements each have an n-side and a p~ side. A top transparent substrate is provided having a transparent conductive layer. The electrically insulative adhesive having the light active semiconductor elements fixed thereon is inserted between the electrically conductive surface and the transparent conductive layer to form a lamination. The electrically insulative adhesive is activated to electrically insulate and bind the top substrate to the bottom substrate. The device<br><br>
structure is thus formed so that either the n-side or the p-side of the light active semiconductor elements are in electrical communication with the transparent conductive layer of the top substrate, and so that the other of the n-side or the p-side of each the light active semiconductor elements are in electrical communication with the electrically conductive surface ofthe bottom substrate to form a light active device. In accordance with the present invention, p and n sides of each LED die are automatically connected and maintained to the respective top and bottom conductor, completely securing each LED die between the substrates in a flexible, hotmelt adhesive sheet layer.<br>
The bottom substrate, the electrically insulative adhesive and the top substrate can be provided as respective rolls of material. This enables the bottom substrate, the electrically ins illative adhesive (with the LED die embedded therein) and the top substrate together in a continuous roll fabrication process. It is noted that these three rolls are all that are necessary for forming the most basic working device structure in accordance with the present inventioa This simple and uncomplicated structure is inherently adaptable to a high yield, continuous, roll- to-roll fabrication techniques that is not obtainable using prior art techniques.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the electrically insulative adhesive comprises a hotmelt material. The step of activating comprises applying heat and pressure to the lamination tp soften the hotmelt material. At least one ofthe heat and pressure are provided by rollers. Alternatively, the adhesive may be composed so that activating it comprises at least one of solvent action (e.g., silicone adhesive), catalytic reaction (e.g., epoxy and hardner) and radiation curing (e.g., UV curable polymer adhesive). The light active semiconductor elements can be light emitting diode die such as is readily commercially available from semiconductor foundries. The light active semiconductor elements may alternatively or additionally be light-to-energy devices, such as solar cell devices. To make white light, a first portion ofthe light active semiconductor elements emit a first wavelength of radiation and second portion ofthe light active semiconductor elements emit a second wavelength of radiation. Alternatively, yellow light emitting LED die and blue light emitting LED die can be provided in proper proportions to create a desired white light appearance. DiffUsers<br><br>
can be included within the adhesive, substrates or as a coating on the substrates and/or the adhesive to create a more uniform glowing surface.<br>
The electrically insulative adhesive can be ahotmelt sheet material, such as that available from Bemis Associates, Shirley, MA. The light active semiconductor elements can be pre-embedded into the hotmelt sheet before me step of inserting the adhesive sheet between the substrates. In this way, the hotmelt sheet can have the semiconductor devices embedded off-line so that multiple embedding lines can supply a roll-to-roll fabrication line. A predetermined pattern of the light active semiconductor elements can be formed embedded in the hotmelt sheet. The predetermined pattern can be formed by electrostatically attracting a plurality of light active semiconductor elements on a transfer member, similar to a laser printer electrostatic drum, and transferring the predetermined pattern onto the insulative adhesive.<br>
The predetermined pattern of the light active semiconductor elements can be formed by magnetically attracting a plurality of light active semiconductor elements on a transfer member, such as an optomagnetically coated drum, and transferring the predetermined pattern onto the insulative adhesive. The predetermined pattern of the light active semiconductor elements can be formed using conventional pick and place machines. Or, an adhesive transfer method, described in detail herein, can be employed. In this case, the predetermined pattern is formed by transferring the semiconductor elements from a relatively lower tack adhesive to a relatively higher tack adhesive.<br>
The transparent conductive layer can be footned by printing a transparent conductive material, such as ITO particles in a polymer binder, to form conductive light transmissive connecting lands. Each land is provided for connecting with a respective light active semiconductor. A relatively higher conducting line pattern can be formed on at least one of the top substrate and the bottom substrate for providing a relatively lower path of resistance from a power supply source to each light active semiconductor element.<br>
The electrically conductive surface and the electrically conductive pattern may comprise a respective x and y wiring grid foi selectively addressing individual light active semiconductor elements for forming a display.<br><br>
Color light can be provided by including LED capable of emitting different wavelengths of light. For example, a red eiraitting LED combined with a yellow emitting LED when driven together and located near each other will be perceived by the human eye as generating an orange light. White light can be generated by combining yellow and blue LED dice, or red, green and blue dice. A phosphor can be provided in the lamination. The phosphor is optically stimulated by a radiation emission of a first wavelength (e.g., blue) from the light active semiconductor element (e.g., LED die) to emit light of a second wavelength (e.g., yellow).<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for making an electronically active sheet. Thte electronically active sheet has a very thin and highly flexible form factor. It can be manufactured using the low cost, high yield continuous roll-to-roll fabrication method described herein. The electronically active sheet can be used for making a lighting device, a display, a light-to-energy device, a flexible electronic circuit, and many other electronic devices. The semiconductor elements can include resistors, transistors, diodes, and any other semiconductor element having a top and bottom electrode format. Other electronic elements can be provided in combination or separately and employed as components of the fabricated flexible electronic circuit. The inventive steps for forming the electronically active sheet include providing a bottom planar substrate having an electrically conductive surface. An adhesive is provided and at least one semiconductor element is fixed to the adhesive. Each semiconductor element has a top conductor and a bottom conductor, A top substrate is provided having an electrically conductive pattern disposed thereon. The adhesive with semiconductor element fixed thereto is inserted between the electrically conductive surface and the electrically conductive pattern to form a lamination. The adhesive is activated to bind the top substrate to the bottom substrate so that one of top conductor and bottom conductor of semiconductor element is automatically brought into and maintained in electrical communication with the electrically conductive pattern of the top substrate and so that the other of the top conductor and the bottom conductor of each semiconductor element is automatically brought into and maintained in electrical communication with the electrically conductive surface of the bottom substrate to form an electronically active sheet.<br><br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for making an encapsulated semiconductor device. A bottom substrate is provided having an electrically conductive* surface. An adhesive layer is provided on the electrically conductive surface. A predetermined pattern of semiconductor elements are fixed to the adhesive. The semiconductor elements each having a top device conductor and a bottom device conductor. A top substrate having a conductive pattern disposed thereon. A lamination is formed comprising the bottom substrate, the adhesive layer (with the semiconductor elements) and the top substrate. The lamination is formed so that the adhesive electrically insulates and binds the top substrate to the bottom substrate. In so doing, one of the top device conductor and bottom device conductor of the semiconductor elements is in electrical communication with the conductive pattern of the top substrate and the other of the top device conductor and bottom device conductor of each semiconductor element is in electrical communication with the electrically conductive layer of the bottom substrate. In this manner, each semiconductor element is automatically connected to the top and bottom conductors that are preformed on the top and bottom substrates. There is no need for wirebonding, solder, lead wires, or other electrical connection elements or steps.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, at least one the semiconductor elements is provided with a middle conductor region between the top conductor and the bottom conductor. For example, the semiconductor can be an npn or pnp transistor. The adhesive comprises at least one electrically conductive portion for making an electrical connection with the middle conductor region.<br>
The inventive light active sheet consists of a bottom substrate flexible sheet having an electrically conductive surface. A top transparent substrate flexible sheet has a transparent conductive layer disposed on it. An electrically insulative adhesive flexible sheet has light active semiconductor elements fixed to it. The light active semiconductor elements each have an n-side and a p-side. The electrically insulative adhesive sheet having the light active semiconductor elements fixed to it is inserted between the electrically conductive surface and the transparent conductive layer to form a lamination, The adhesive sheet is activated so that the electrically insulative adhesive electrically insulates and binds the top substrate sheet to the bottom substrate<br><br>
sheet. When the adhesive sheet is activated, one of the n-side or the p-side of the light active semiconductor elements is automatically brought into electrical Communication with the transparent conductive layer of the top substrate sheet. The other of the n-side or the p-side is automatically brought into electrical comrminication with the electrically conductive surface of the bottom substrate sheet to form a light active device.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
For purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention, reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings and specific language will be used to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended, there being contemplated such alterations and modifications of the illustrated device, and such further applications of the principles of the invention as disclosed herein, as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention pertains.<br>
The various elements making up each embodiment of the inventive devices and the various steps performed in the inventive methods can be interchanged in a variety of iterations, not all of which are provided as specific embodiments or examples herein. For example, function-enhancing components, such as phosphors, described in one embodiment may be employed, although not specifically described, in an alternative construction of another embodiment. Such iterations are specifically included within the scope of the inventions described herein.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the inventive method for manufacturing a patterned light active sheet. In accordance with the present invention, a solid-state light active sheet, and a method for manufacturing the same, is provided. The solid-state light active sheet is effective for applications such as flexible solar panels and light sensors, as well as high efficiency lighting and display products. The inventive light sheet utilizes semiconductor elements, such as commercially available LED dice, to create a totally<br><br>
new form of solar panel, lighting, signage and display devices. The light sheet can be constructed to provide an even, diffuse solid-state lighting device that is ultra-thin, flexible and highly robust. An embodiment of the inventive manufacturing method is based on the well-known physics and mechanical and electrical components found in a conventional desktop laser printer. In essence, in accordance with this inventive embodiment, LED dice replace the toner of a laser printer. The result is a unique light sheet form factor adaptable to an extraordinarily broad range of applications. These applications range from interior tent lighting, to display backlighting, to commercial and municipal signage and traffic control signals to replacements for incandescent and fluorescent source lighting.<br>
The inventive manufacturing process starts with a roll of flexible, plastic substrate. (I) A conductive electrode pattern is formed on the substrate through a variety of well-known printing techniques, such as inkjet printing. This electrode pattern is used to bring power to the dice. (2) Next, a conductive adhesive is printed at locations where the LED dice will be patterned. (3) Then, using an electrostatic drum and charge patterning mechanism similar to a laser printer engine, LED dice are patterned onto the electrostatic drum. The die pattern is then transferred to the adhesive areas that have been formed on the substrate. (4) A top substrate coated with a conductor is then brought in to complete the solid- state, ultra thin, flexible light sheet lamination. (5) Finally, the completed light sheet is rolled up on a take-up reel. This light sheet material can then be cut, stamped, thermoformed, bent and packaged into a wide range of new and useful solid-state lighting products.<br>
In accordance with the invention, a method is provided for forming a sheet of light active material. A first substrate (bottom substrate, shown in Figure 1) is provided having a transparent first conductive layer. The first substrate may be, for example, glass, flexible glass (available from Corning), PET, PAN, or other suitable polymer, Barrix (available from Vitrex) or other transparent or semi- transparent substrate material. The transparent first conductive layer may be, for example, sputter coated indium-tin-oxide (ITO), a conductive polymer, a thin metal film, or the like.<br>
A pattern of light active semiconductor elements are formed. The light active semiconductor elements may be, for example, LED dice having an n-side and a p-side and/or light-to-energy semiconductor layered particles wherein the n- and p- side<br><br>
correspond to charge donor and charge acceptor layers. Each light active semiconductor element has either of the n-side or the p-side in electrical communication with the transparent conductive layer. The electrical communication may be direct (i.e., surface to surface contact) or indirect (i.e., through a conductive or semi-conductive medium). A second substrate having a second conductive layer is provided. The second substrate may be, for example, a metal foil, a metal coated polymer sheet, a conductive polymer coated metal foil or polymer sheet, or the like. The second substrate is secured to the first substrate so that the other of the n-side or said p-side of each the light active semiconductor element in electrical communication with the second conductive layer. Again, the electrical communication can be direct or indirect. Thus, in accordance with the present invention, a solid-state sheet of light active material is formed.<br>
The transparent first conductive layer may comprise a transparent coating preformed on the first substrate. For example, the substrate may be a sheet or roll of a polymer film, such as PET or PAN, with a sputter coated conductor comprised of ITO. Alternatively, as shown in Figure 1, the transparent coating can be applied as a conductive ink or conductive adhesive.<br>
The pattern of light active semiconductor elements can be formed by electrostatically attracting the light active semiconductor elements to a transfer member. Then, the attracted light active semiconductor elements are transferred from the transfer member to the first substrate. The transfer member may include an opto-electric coating effective for holding a patterned electrostatic charge. The patterned electrostatic charge is effective for electrostatically attracting the light active semiconductor elements and forming the pattern of light active semiconductor elements. The optical patterning of the opto-electric coating can be done, for example, using a scanned laser beam and an LED light source, similar to the process used by laser or LED printers. Thus, the transfer member may comprise an opto-electric coated drum, and the patterning mechanism may be similar to the well-know mechanism employed for patterning toner in a laser or LED printer.<br>
An adhesive pattern can be formed on the first substrate for adhering the pattern oflight active semiconductor elements to the first substrate. Alternatively, or<br><br>
additionally, an adhesive pattern can also be formed on the first substrate for adhering the second substrate to the first substrate.<br>
A pattern of light active semiconductor elements can be formed by forming a first pattern of first light active semiconductor elements and forming a second pattern of second light active semiconductor elements. The first light active semiconductor elements emit light having a first color and the second light active semiconductor elements emit light having a second color. Alternatively, the first light active semiconductor elements emit light and the second light active semiconductor elements convert light to electrical energy.<br>
The first conductive layer may be formed as agrid of x-electrodes, and the second conductive layer formed as a grid of y-electrodes, so that each respective light active semiconductor element is addressable for forming a sheet of light active material capable of functioning as a pixelated display component.<br>
The pattern of light active semiconductor elements can be formed by forming a first pattern of first color light emitting semiconductor elements, forming a second pattern of second color light emitting semiconductor elements and forming a third pattern of third color light emitting semiconductor element. The first conductive layer may be formed as a grid of x-electrodes, and the second conductive layer formed as a grid of y-electrodes, so that each respective light active semiconductor is addressable for forming a sheet of light active material capable of functioning as a full-color pixelated display component.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates another inventive method for manufacturing a light active sheet. In each example of the mechanism employed for forming the inventive light active sheet, the components and processes can be mixed in a number of iterations. The examples herein depict a selection of such iterations, but represent just a few of the possible process and material combinations contemplated by the inventive methods and device structures. As shown in Figure 2, a first substrate is provided. A first conductive surface is formed on the first substrate. A pattern of LED dice is formed on the conductive surface. In the example shown, the conductive surface is provided as a conductive adhesive. However, the conductive surface may be, for example an ITO coating pre-formed on the bottom substrate. Each LED die has an anode and a cathode side. A second substrate is provided. A second conductive<br><br>

The first substrate is fixed to the second substrate so that either of the anode and the cathode side of the LED die is in electrical communication with the first conductive surface, and the other of the anode and the cathode side of the LED dice is in electrical communication with the second conductive surface. As shown, the LED dice may be encased within a conductive adhesive applied to the top and bottom substrate, with an insulator adhesive applied between the dice. Alternatively, only an insulator adhesive may be applied between the dice for fixing the top and bottom substrate together. The dice are then held in electrical contact with the top and bottom substrate conductive surfaces through the clamping force applied by the insulator adhesive. As other alternatives, only one or both of the substrates may have a conductive or non-conductive adhesive applied to it (through inkjet, silkscreen, doctor blade, slot-die coating, electrostatic coating, etc.), and the dice adhered directly or clamped between the substrates.<br>

The pattern of LED dice can be formed by electrostatically attracting the LED dice to a transfer member, and then transferring the attracted LED dice from the transfer member to the first conductive surface. The transfer member may include an opto-electric coating effective for holding a patterned electrostatic charge, the<br><br>
patterned electrostatic charge being effective for electrostatically attracting and forming the pattern of LED dice. The opto-electric coating can be patterned using at least one of a scanned laser beam and an LED light source. The transfer member may be a drum, aflat planar member, or other shape. The method of transferring the dice may also include a pick-and-place robotic method, or simple sprinkling of the semiconductor elements (i.e., the dice) onto an adhesive surface applied to the substrate.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates another inventive method for manufacturing a light active sheet having two or more different types of light active semiconductor elements. A pattern of light active semiconductor elements can be formed by forming a first pattern of first light active semiconductor elements and forming a second pattern of second light active semiconductor elements. The first light active semiconductor elements emit light having a first color and the second light active semiconductor elements emit light having a second color. Alternatively, the first light active semiconductor elements emit light and the second light active semiconductor elements convert light to electrical energy.<br>
The first conductive layer may be formed as agrid ofx-electrodes, and the second conductive layer formed as a grid ofy-electrodes, so that each respective light active semiconductor element is addressable for forming a sheet of light active material capable of functioning as a pixelated display component.

Figure 60 is a schematic side view showing two curved light sheets having a common light emission focal point. Figure 61 is a schematic side view showing three .curved light sheets having a common light emission focal point. As shown in these drawings, at least one of the flexible substrates can include a first optical system associated with it for controlling light emitted from the plurality of<br><br>
light emitting diode dice. A second optical system can be disposed adjacent to one of the substrates for controlling light emitted from the plurality of light emitting diode dice.<br>
Figure 62 is a cross-sectional block diagram skewing the constituent parts of the inventive light active sheet. In accordance with, an embodiment of the inventive light active sheet, a top PET substrate has a coating of ITO, acting as the top electrode. A bottom PET substrate can be ITO PET, metal foil, metalized mylar, etc., depending onthe intended application of the light sheet (e.g., transparent HUD element, light source, solar panel, etc.). Xhe matrix (carrier) material may be a transparent photopolymerizable solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) based on cross-linked polysiloxane-g-oglio9ethylene oxide (see, for example, Solid- polymer electrolytes based on cross-linked polysiloxane-g-oligo(ethylene oxide): ionic comductivityand electrochemical properties, Journal of Power Sources 119-121 (2003) 448-453, which is incorporated by reference herein). The emissive particulate may be commercially available LED dice, such as an AlGaAs/AlGaAs Red LED Die - TK 112UR, available from Tyntek, Taiwan). Alternatively the particulate may be comprised of light-to-energy particles, having charge donox and charge acceptor semiconductor layers, such as found in typical silicon-based solar panels. In the case of an energy-to-light device (i.e., a light sheet), it may be preferable for the matrix material to be less electrically conductive than the semiconductor elements so that the preferred path of electrical conductivity is through the light emitting elements. In the case of a light-to-energy device (i.e., a solar panel), it may be preferable for the matrix material to be more electrically conductive than the semiconductor element so that charges separated at the donor/acceptor interface effectively migrate to the top and bottom substrate electrodes.<br>
Figure 63 is a cross-section block diagram of an embodiment of the inventive light active sheet having a cross-linked polymer (e.g., polysiloxane-g- oglio9ethylene oxide) matrix, UV semiconductor elements, and phosphor re- emitter. In this case, a white-light solid-state light sheet is obtained through the stimulated re-emission of light in the visible sprectrum via UV stimulation of a phosphore re-emitter additive dispersed in the matrix between the substrates. In this case, the UV semiconductor elements may be LED dice (for example, UV LED dice C405-MB290-S0100,<br><br>
available from Cree of North Carolina) and the phosphor may be a YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) phosphor.<br>
Figure 64 is a cross-sectional block diagram of an embodiment of the inventive light active sheet having a light diffusive and/or re-emitter coating on a transparent substrate. In accordance with this embodiment, the additives in the matrix may be, for example, light diffusers, adhesive enhancers, matrix conductivity enhancers, etc. The re-emitter coating can be a YAG phosphor coating (with a multi-layered substrate). Further, the light diffusion can be obtained through the substrate composition or through substrate surface effects, such as calendaring and/or embossing.<br>
Figure 65 is a cross-sectional block diagram of an embodiment of the inventive light active sheet having blue and yellow semiconductor elements, and light diffusers (e.g., glass beads) within the matrix. The blue arid yellow semiconductor elements can be LED dice that are selected to create a white light emission, or an RGB combination.<br>
Figure 66 is a side view of a commercially available inorganic LED die. A conventional inorganic LED die is available from many manufacturers, typically has a relatively narrow radiation emission spectrum, is relatively energy efficient, has a long service life and is solid-state and durable. The die shown is an example of an AlGaAs/AlGaAs red die, obtained from Tyntek Corporation, Taiwan. These dice have dimensions roughly 12 mil x 12 mil x 8 mil, making them very small point light sources. As shown in Figure 67, in a conventional LED lamp, this die is held in a metal cup so that one electrode of the die (e.g., the anode) is in contact with the base of the cup. The metal cup is part of an anode lead. The other electrode of the die (e.g., the cathode) has a very thin wire solder or wire bonded to it, with the other end of the wire solder or wire bonded to an anode lead. The cup, die, wire and portions of the anode and cathode leads are encased in a plastic lens with the anode and cathode leads protruding from the lens base. These leads are typically solder or wire bonding to a circuit board to selectively provide power to the die and cause it to emit light. It is very difficult to manufacture these conventional lamps due to the very small size of the die, and the need to solder or wire bond such a small wire to such a small die electrode. Further, the plastic lens material is a poor heat conductor and the cup<br><br>
provides little heat sink capacity. As the die heats up its efficiency is reduced, limiting the service conditions, power efficiency and light output potential of the lamp. The bulkiness of*the plastic lens material and the need to solder or wire bond the lamp leads to an electrical power source limits emissive source packing density and the potential output intensity per surface area.<br>
Figure 68 is a cross-sectional view of an experimental prototype of the inventive photo-radiation source having a gap between the N electrode of an LED die and an ITO cathode. When voltage is applied to the aluminum anode and the ITO cathode, the air gap between the N electrode and the ITO prevents electricity from getting to the die.<br>
Figure 69 is a cross-sectional view of the experimental prototype of the inventive photo-radiation source having a drop of quinoline as a conductive matrix material completing the electrical contact between the N electrode of the LED die and the ITO cathode. When voltage is applied to the aluminum anode and the ITO cathode, the quinoline completes the electrical connection, and the die lights up brightly. This inventive device structure allows a connection that does not require solder or wire bonding between the die and the current source from the anode and cathode electrodes (the ITO and the aluminum). The aluminum block acts as an effective heat sink, and the quinoline surrounding Ihe die provides very efficient heat transfer from ihe die to the aluminum block. The result is that the die can be driven at higher voltage and bright intensity. Also, since tfcie connection to the die does not require a tedious and expensive solder or wire bonding operation, it is much easier to fabricate the inventive structure than the conventional LED lamp construction (shown, for example, in Figure 67). Further, the avoidance of solder or wire bonding connections directly to the die, and the heat transfer and dissipation provided by the conductive medium and the metallic heat sink, allows for extremely high die packing densities to be realized (as shown, for example, in Figure 51). The result is an effective photo-radiation source having superior radiation intensity, durability, lifetime, cost and spectrum as compared with any of the conventional art.<br>
Figure 70 is a photograph of an experiment prototype demonstrating a light active particle (LED die) connected to a top and/or bottom electrode through a charge transport material (quinoline). This photograph shows a conventional LED die<br><br>
suspended in a drop of quinoline, a benzene derivative. The quinoline drop and LED die are disposed between a top and bottom conductive substrate comprised of ITO-coated float glass. When voltage is applied to the respective top and bottom conductors (the ITO), the electrical connection to ttrA die is made through the quinoline, and the die brightly lights up.<br>
Figure 71 is a photograph of an experimental prototype denaonstrating a free-floating light emissive particulate (miniature LED lamps) dispersed within a conductive fluid carrier (salt-doped polyethylene oxide). An emissive particulate/conductive carrier concept was demonstrated and proven viable using very small "particulated" inorganic LEDs suspended in an ionic conducting fluid composed of a fluid poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) polymer doped with a room temperature molten salt. When connected to 110 v AC, these 3 v DC devices light up without burning out. Figure 72 is a photograph of an experiment prototype demonstrating an 8x4 element grid of light active semiconductor elements (LED dice) disposed between ITO-coated glass substrates, this photograph shows a light sheet prototype comprised of an array of 32 inorganic light emitting diode dice, each die is about the size of a fine grain of salt. Unlike conventional LED lamps (shown, for example, in Figure 67), in accordance with the present invention, there are no solder or wires connecting the LED dice to the power source. By avoiding the need for solder and wiring, the present invention provides a considerable cost savings as compared with the existing technologies. The inventive light sheet also has a unique, ultra-thin form factor and full spectrum of colors (including high brightness white light).<br>
As shown in Figure 73, in accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a method is provided of making a light active sheet. A bottom substrate having an electrically conductive surface is provided. A hotmelt adhesive sheet is provided. Light active semiconductor elements, such as LED die, are embedded in the hotmelt adhesive sheet. The LED die each have a top electrode and a bottom electrode. A top transparent substrate is provided having a transparent conductive layer. The hotmelt adhesive sheet with the embedded LEE&gt; die is inserted between the electrically conductive surface and the transparent conductive layer to form a lamination. The lamination is run through a heated pressure roller system to melt the hotmelt adhesive sheet and electrically insulate and bind the top substrate to the<br><br>
bottom substrate. As the hotmelt sheet is softened, the LED die breakthrough so that the top electrode comes into electrical contact with the transparent conductive layer of the top substrate and the bottom electrode comes into electrical contact with the electrically conductive surface of the bottom substrate. Thus, the p and n sides of each LED die are automatically connected to the top conductive layer and the bottom conductive surface. Each LED die is encapsulated and secured between the substrates in the flexible, hotmelt adhesive sheet layer. The bottom substrate, the hotmelt adhesive (with the embedded LED die) and the top substrate can be provided as rolls of material. The rolls are brought together in a continuous roll fabrication process, resulting in a flexible sheet of lighting material.<br>
Figure 73 illustrates an inventive method for manufacturing a light active sheet using a roll-to-roll fabrication process. The inventive light sheet has a very simple device architecture including a bottom substrate, a hotmelt adhesive (with embedded LED die) and a top substrate. The bottom substrate, the hotmelt adhesive (with the embedded LED die) and the top substrate can be provided as rolls of material. The rolls are brought together in a continuous roll fabrication process, resulting in a flexible sheet of lighting material.<br>
The inventive roll-to-roll fabrication process enables a high yield, lower cost manufacturing of light active and semiconductor electronic circuits. Also, the present invention results in devices with a unique, very thin form factor that is extremely flexible, waterproof and highly robust.<br>
The present invention pertains to a method of making a light active sheet. The inventive roll-to-roll fabrication process starts with a supply roll of bottom substrate material having an electrically conductive surface (stage 1). As shown in stage 2, a supply roll of a hotmelt adhesive sheet is brought into contact with the electrically conductive surface of the bottom substrate. Light active semiconductor elements, such as LED die, are embedded in the hotmelt adhesive sheet. The LED die each has a top electrode and a bottom electrode. The LED die (or other semiconductor or electronic circuit elements) can be pre-embedded into the hotmelt adhesive sheet off-line in a separate operation, or in-line as described elsewhere herein. A warm tacking pressure roller system can be used to soften the hotmelt adhesive and secure it to the bottom substrate. The hotmelt adhesive sheet can include a release sheet that protects the<br><br>
V<br>
embedded semiconductor elements and keeps the adhesive from sticking to itself inthe roll. At stage 3, a top transparent substrate having a transparent conductive layer is provided. The hotmelt adhesive sheet with the embedded LED die is inserted between the electrically conductive surface and the transparent conductive layer to form a lamination. The lamination is run through hot fusing pressure rollers to melt the hotmelt adhesive sheet and electrically insulate and bind the top substrate to the bottom substrate. The rollers may be heated, or separate heating zones can be provided for heat activating the adhesive.<br>
Applicants have discovered that as the hotmelt sheet is softened, the LED die breakthrough the adhesive so that the top electrode comes into electrical contact with the transparent conductive layer of the top substrate and the bottom electrode comes into electrical contact with the electrically conductive surface of the bottom substrate.<br>
Thus, the p and n sides of each LED die are automatically connected to the top conductive layer and the bottom conductive surface. Each LED die is completely encapsulated within the hotmelt adhesive and the substrates. In addition, the LED die is each permanently secured between the substrates fully encased within the flexible, hotmelt adhesive sheet layer and substrates.<br>
Figure 74 is a top view of an inventive light active sheet showing transparent conductor windows and highly conductive leads. In this embodiment, the transparent conductor windows are applied to a transparent substrate, such as PET, through a screen printing, sputtered through a mask, inkjet, gravure, offset, or other coating or printing process. The transparent conductive windows allow light generated by the LEDs to be emitted. In accordance with the present invention, conventional wirebonding or soldering of the LED die is not necessary. Instead, when the hotmelt sheet melts, the LED dice automatically make face-to- face electrically conductive contact with the top and bottom conductive surfaces on the substrates, and that contact is permanently maintained when the hotmelt sheet cools. This device architecture is readily adaptable to high yield manufacturing, and may avoid the need for metallic conductive pads formed on the LED die emitting face. The avoidance of the metallic conductive pad results in more effective light emission from the LED die, since the metallic conductive pads conventionally required for soldering or wirebonding are also light blocking. Thus, in addition to providing a lower manufacturing cost and<br><br>
w<br>
unique very thin form factor, the inventive light sheet may also be a more energy efficient device.<br>
Figure 75 is a cross sectional schematic view of the inventive light active sheet showing transparent conductor windows and highly conductive leads. The inventive light active sheet consists of a bottom substrate flexible sheet having an electrically conductive surface. A top transparent substrate flexible sheet has a transparent conductive layer disposed on it. An electrically insulative adhesive flexible sheet has light active semiconductor elements fixed to it. The light active semiconductor elements each have an n-side and a p-side. The electrically insulative adhesive sheet having the light active semiconductor elements fixed to it is inserted between the electrically conductive surface and the transparent conductive layer to form a lamination, The adhesive sheet is activated so that the electrically insulative adhesive electrically insulates and binds the top substrate sheet to the bottom substrate sheet. When the adhesive sheet is activated, one of the n-side or the p-side of the light active semiconductor elements is automatically brought into electrical communication with the transparent conductive layer of the top substrate sheet. The other of the n-side or the p-side is automatically brought into electrical communication with the electrically conductive surface of the bottom substrate sheet to form a light active device.<br>
Figure 76 is an isolated top view of a pair of LED devices connected to a highly conductive lead line through a more resistive transparent conductive window. Figure 77 is an equivalent electrical circuit diagram of the inventive semiconductor device circuit. The transparent windows are composed of a conductive material that is not as conductive as a metal conductor, such as copper wire. Therefore, each transparent window acts as a resistor in electrical series connection with each respective LED die. This resistor protects the LED die from seeing too much electrical energy. Further, highly conductive leads are connected to each transparent window, and each highly conductive lead is connected to a highly conductive buss. Power is supplied to this buss, and each LED die is energized with the same electrical power so that a consistent light is generated across the entire light sheet.<br>
Figure 78 is a cross sectional view of the light active sheet showing a transparent conductor layer on a transparent top substrate, LED dice embedded in a hotmelt adhesive layer, and a conductive bottom substrate. Figure 79 is an exploded<br><br>
v<br>
view of the component layers of the inventive light active sheet. In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, a method of making a light active sheet is provided. A bottom substrate having an electrically conductive surface is provided. An electrically insulative adhesive is provided. Light active semiconductor elements, such as LED die, are fixed to the electrically insulative adhesive. The light active semiconductor elements each have an n-side and a p- side. A top transparent substrate is provided having a transparent conductive layer.<br>
The electrically insulative adhesive having the light active semiconductor elements fixed thereon is inserted between the electrically conductive surface and the transparent conductive layer to form a lamination. The electrically insulative adhesive is activated to electrically insulate and bind the top substrate to Ihe bottom substrate. The device structure is thus formed so that either the n-side or the p-side of the light active semiconductor elements are in electrical communication with the transparent conductive layer of the top substrate, and so that the other of the n-side or the p-side of each the light active semiconductor elements are in electrical communication with the electrically conductive surface of the bottom substrate to form a light active device. In accordance with the present invention, p and n sides of each LED die are automatically connected and maintained to the respective top and bottom conductor, completely securing each LED die between the substrates in a flexible, hotmelt adhesive sheet layer.<br>
The bottom substrate, the electrically insulative adhesive and the top substrate can be provided as respective rolls of material. This enables Ihe bottom substrate, the electrically insulative adhesive (with the LED die embedded therein) and the top substrate together in a continuous roll fabrication process. It is noted that these three rolls are all that are necessary for forming the most basic working device structure in accordance with the present invention. This simple and uncomplicated structure makes it inherently adaptable to ahigh yield, continuous, roll-to-roll fabrication techniques that is not obtainable using prior art techniques. As shown in Figure 78, the transparent conductor on the top substrate can be formed as a continuous surface, such as ITO (indium tin oxide), conductive polymer, or a thin metallic layer.<br>
Figure 80(a) is a top view of a transparent substrate sheet. Figure 80(b) is a top view of the transparent substrate sheet having transparent conductive windows formed<br><br>

on it. Figure 80(c) is a top view of the transparent substrate sheet having transparent conductive widows, highly conductive lead lines and a conductive buss formed on it. In this case, the transparent conductive windows can be performed off-line on the top substrate and the substrate re-rolled, or the conductive windows can be in-line during the fabrication of the inventive light sheet or semiconductor device. The windows can be formed by inkjet, coating through a mask, screen printing or other technique. The transparent material can be a conductive paste, a conductive polymer, a sputtered layer, or other suitable material that enables light to be transmitted from the LED die.<br>
Figure 81 shows a two-part step for stretching a release substrate to create a desired spacing between semiconductor elements diced from a wafer. A predetermined pattern of the light active semiconductor elements can be formed using conventional pick and place machines. Also, in accordance with an inventive adhesive transfer method, the stretched substrate is used to create a desired spacing. The dice are provided from the foundry on an adhesive sheet that can be stretched for the pick and place equipment to remove the dice. In accordance with the present invention, a regular array can be formed by spreading the sheet to make an array of the right spacing and transfer it directly to the melt adhesive. There may need to be an intermediate step that transfers to a linear tape and then the linear tape is applied at a controlled rate to make wider or closer spacing, and with machine vision to identify the holes in the foundry sheet caused by the inspection and removal of defect dice.<br>
Figure 82 is an exploded view of the sheet components used to embed the semiconductor elements into an adhesive hotmelt sheet. A hotmelt sheet is placed on top of the stretched LED dice, and a Teflon release layer placed on top of the hotmelt sheet. The hotmelt sheet is heated, and pressure applied to embed the LED dice in the hotmelt sheet. When cooled, the hotmelt sheet can be removed from the stretch release substrate and the embedded LED dice lifted along with the hotmelt sheet. Figure 83(a) is a cross sectional view of the hotmelt sheet with embedded semiconductor elements prior to removing the semiconductor elements from the release stretch substrate. Figure 83(b) is a cross sectional view of the hotmelt sheet with embedded semiconductor elements after removing the semiconductor elements from the release stretch substrate.<br><br>
V<br>
In addition to lifting the LED dice from the release sheet in formation or using a pick and place machine, other inventive methods can be employed for forming a predetermined pattern of the light active semiconductor elements including the electrostatic, optomagnetic and adhesive transfer methods described herein. Figure 84 is a top view of the inventive light sheet material configured with addressable LED elements. Figure 85 is a cross sectional view of the inventive light sheet configured with addressable LED elements. Figure 86(a) is a top view of a bottom substrate sheet having a grid of x-electrodes. Figure 86(b) is a top view of an adhesive hotmelt sheet having embedded LED dice. Figure 86(c) is a top view of a transparent substrate sheet having a grid of y-electrodes. The transparent conductive layer can be formed by printing a transparent conductive material, such as ITO particles in a polymer binder, to form conductive light transmissive connecting lands. Each land is provided for connecting with a respective light active semiconductor. A relatively higher conducting line pattern can be formed on at least one of the top substrate and the bottom substrate for providing a relatively lower path of resistance from a power supply source to each light active semiconductor element. The electrically conductive surface and the electrically conductive pattern comprise a respective x and y wiring grid for selectively addressing individual light active semiconductor elements for forming a display.<br>
Figure 87 shows an inventive method for manufacturing a multi-colored light active sheet using a roll-to-roll fabrication process, this multi-color light sheet has RGB sub-pixels composed of individual LED die, and may be driven as a display, white light sheet, variable color sheet, etc., depending on the conductive lead pattern and driving scheme. Figure 88 is a cross sectional view of an embodiment of the inventive light sheet configured as a full-color display pixel,<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a method is provided for making an electronically active sheet. The electronically active sheet has a very thin and highly flexible form factor, and can be used to form an active display having a plurality of emissive pixels. Each pixel includes red, green and blue subpixel elements. It can be manufactured using the low cost, high yield continuous roll- to-roll fabrication method described herein. The electronically active sheet can also be used for making a lighting device, a light-to-energy device, a flexible electronic circuit, and many<br><br>
other electronic devices. The semiconductor elements can include resistors, transistors, diodes, and any other semiconductor element having a top and bottom electrode format. Other electronic elements can be provided in combination or separately and employed as components of the fabricated flexible electronic circuit.<br>
The inventive steps for forming the electronically active sheet include providing a bottom planar substrate (stage 1) and forming an electrically conductive lines on the bottom substrate (stage 2). An adhesive is provided (stage 3) and at least one semiconductor element is fixed to the adhesive. Each semiconductor element has a top conductor and a bottom conductor. In the case of a display device, or multi-1 colored device, LED dice that are capable of being driven to emit different colors (e.g., RGB) can be applied to the adhesive (stages 4-5), thus forming separately addressable sub-pixel elements of a completed display. A top substrate is provided having an electrically conductive pattern disposed thereon (stage 6). The adhesive with the semiconductor element fixed thereto is inserted between the electrically conductive surface and the electrically conductive pattern to form a lamination. The adhesive is activated (stage 7) to bind the top substrate to the bottom substrate so that one of the top conductor and the bottom conductor of the semiconductor element is automatically brought into and maintained in electrical communication with the electrically conductive pattern of the top substrate and so that the other of the top conductor and the bottom conductor of each semiconductor element is automatically brought into and maintained in electrical communication with the electrically conductive surface of the bottom substrate. Thus, the invention can be used to fabricate a thin, flexible, emissive display using roll-to-roll fabrication methods.<br>
As shown, in a preferred embodiment, the electrically insulative adhesive comprises a hotmelt material. The step of activating comprises applying heat and pressure to the lamination to soften the hotmelt material. At least one of the heat and pressure are provided by rollers. Alternatively, the adhesive may be composed so that activating it comprises at least one of solvent action (e.g., silicone adhesive), catalytic reaction (e.g., epoxy and hardner) and radiation curing (e.g., TJV curable polymer adhesive).<br>
The light active semiconductor elements can be light emitting diode die such as is readily commercially available from semiconductor foundries. The light active<br><br>
semiconductor elements may alternatively or additionally be light-to-energy devices, such as solar cell devices. To make white light, a first portion of the light active semiconductor elements emit a first wavelength of radiation and second portion of the light active semiconductor elements emit a second wavelength of radiation. Alternatively, yellow light emitting LED die and blue light emitting LED die can be provided in proper proportions to create a desired white light appearance. Diffusers can be included within the adhesive, substrates or as a coating on the substrates and/or the adhesive to create a more uniform glowing surface.<br>
Figure 89 is an exploded view showing tiie main constituent components of an embodiment of the inventive light sheet configured as a full-color display. The electricalfy insulative adhesive can be a hotmelt sheet material, such as that available from Beinis Associates. The light active semiconductor elements can be pre-embedded into the hotmelt sheet before the step of inserting the adhesive sheet between the substrates. Ih this way, the hotmelt sheet can have the semiconductor devices embedded off-line so that multiple embedding lines can supply a roll-to-roll fabrication line. A predetermined pattern of the light active semiconductor elements can be formed embedded in the hotmelt sheet. As shown in stages 4-6 of Figure 87, the predetermined pattern can be formed by electrostatically attracting a plurality of light active semiconductor elements on a transfer member, similar to a laser printer electrostatic drum, and transferring the predetermined pattern onto the insulative adhesive.<br>
Figure 90 is an exploded view showing the main constituent components of an embodiment of the inventive light sheet configured as an egress EXTT sign. In this case, the light emitting elements can be formed as a predetermined pattern either offline or in-line prior to the hotmelt sheet being inserted between the substrates.<br>
Color light can be provided by including LED capable of emitting different wavelengths of light. For example, a red emitting LED combined with a yellow emitting LED when driven together and located near each other will be perceived by the human eye as generating an orange light. White light can be generated by combining yellow and blue LED dice, or red, green and blue dice. A phosphor can be provided in the lamination. The phosphor is optically stimulated by a radiation<br><br>
emission of a first wavelength (e.g., blue) from the light active semiconductor element (e.g., LED die) to emit light of a second wavelength (e.g., yellow).<br>
Alternative methods and device architectures can be employed that add components such as doubsided electrically conductive tape or conductive adhesive to connect the LED die or semiconductor devices. These elements can also be employed in addition to the other inventive methods and device architectures described herein to connect other electronic components and form more complex device sheets.

In accordance with the present invention, a bright light panel is obtained using a grid of LED dice fixed between sheets of flexible conductive substrates. The panels are extremely lightweight, flexible, long-lived (100,000 hours based on the LED lifetime), and easily deployed. Thinner than a credit card, the lights are so rugged that they can be nailed or cut without affecting performance. The light is bright and diffuse at low power and compatible with photovoltaic sources. In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a two-color lighting panel is provided, having, for example white light for general illumination, and red-light for a command and<br><br>
w<br>
control situation or as a night vision aid. In an embodiment of the present invention, to change the color, only the polarity of the electrical source is switched.<br>
The features of the inventive lighting system include: 1. Low power, highly efficient, evenly diffuse solid state lighting that can be dimmed 2. Single- or two-color illumination 3. Easily repaired, amenable to low- voltage battery, direct photovoltaic source or charging system 4. Rugged, flexible, thin light sheet and fixture format - unbreakable 5. Unique solid-state technology robust against shock and vibration 6. Low cost at high volume when manufactured roll-to-roll<br>
The inventive device structure imbeds LED dice (chips) between two conductive layers, at least one of which is transparent. For example Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) -coated poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) has been successfully used in prototype devices. The other substrate could also be ITO/PET or for a higher level of conductivity (and brighter light), made of a reflective, metallized PET for flexibility and toughness, or a metal foil. The transparent electrode can also have a fine pattern of conductive ink printed on it to even out the current to the individual dies in a regular array for even lighting, or patterned for a signage application. The inventive structure is fabricated from prepared materials according to the manufacturing process described herein. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the manufacturing process comprises a simple lamination that can be used for producing sheet lighting material.<br>
The inventive process requires the preparation of the roll of hot-melt adhesive to make a holt-melt active layer for the final lamination. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, methods are provided to accurately orient the LED dice (dies) for the adhesive layer, and place them in the right place. The inventive fabrication of the hot-melt active layer may be a two-step process. First the dice are oriented and placed accurately on a tacky adhesive to hold them in place in a pattern of holes formed in a silicone-coated release layer template. Then the hot melt adhesive is warmed to soften and pick up the dice from the template. The template may be reused. A manual orientation and placement of the die may be used, or to increase the economic benefits of this inexpensive solid-state light source, one of the following inventive placement methods, or others, may be employed.<br><br>
Pick and Place Method. The current method for placing dice on printed circuit boards, or for fabricating individual LED lamps involves robotics orientation and placement using machine vision. Conventional pick and place equipment can be adapted for the placement of dice on a continuous hotmelt sheet web.<br>
Figure 112 shows a first step of an inventive adhesive transfer method for fixing semiconductor elements onto an adhesive transfer substrate. In this case, the predetermined pattern is formed by transferring the semiconductor elements from a relatively lower tack adhesive to a relatively higher tack adhesive. Figure 113 shows a second step of the inventive adhesive transfer method for fixing semiconductor elements onto the adhesive transfer substrate. Figure 114 shows a third step of the inventive adhesive transfer method for fixing semiconductor elements onto the adhesive transfer substrate.<br>
Electrostatic Transfer Method. An electrostatic printing method can be used to orient and place the dice on the hot melt adhesive. In this approach, in effect the dice become the toner in a low-resolution device that prints on a continuous web of the hot melt adhesive. Applicants have demonstrated the electrostatic attraction of the dice and have used an electrostatic field to orient the dice. Figure 120 is a photograph demonstrating a LED die electrostatically attracted to a charged needle. Figure 121 is a photograph demonstrating three LED dice electrostatcially attracted to a charged needle. As long as current doesn't flow, the LEDs are not damaged and continue to operate. An array of charged whiskers can be used to selectively pick up and place the semiconductor elements on an adhesive transfer susbtrate. The placement can be as an evenly spaced array, or by selectively charging the whiskers, a pattern of semiconductor elements can be formed. Figure 115 shows a first step of an electrostatic attraction transfer method for fixing semiconductor elements onto an adhesive transfer substrate. Figure 116 shows a second step of the electrostatic attraction transfer method for fixing semiconductor elements onto the adhesive transfer substrate. Figure 117 shows a third step of the electrostatic attraction transfer method for fixing semiconductor elements onto the adhesive transfer substrate. Figure 118 shows a fourth step of the electrostatic attraction transfer method for fixing semiconductor elements onto the adhesive transfer substrate. Multiple passes or<br><br>
V<br>
several stages in line enable several colors to be placed for red, green and blue (RGB) SStithesis of white light from several dice accurately placed on printed electrodes. Figure 111 illustrates an inventive method of making the active layer of the inventive light active sheet using an electrostatic drum transfer system for orienting and patterning LED dice on a hotmelt sheet. In order to write the dice into a hot melt array, the dice are used as toner in a laser printer. The analogous steps of the process are: 1) A transfer drum is charged -with a positive (+) charge. 2) The laser writes a negative image on the photosensitive drum under the PCL or Postscript control of the laser printer. 3) The developer roll is negatively charged to attract the positively charged LED dice. 4) The positively charged dice transfer to more negatively charged ("write black") regions of the transfer drum. 5) The even more highly negatively charged hot melt adhesive accepts the dice from the transfer drum and as it passes, the detac corona strip removes the charge. 6) In a hot zone, the melt adhesive is softened slightly to hold the dice in place. 7) The active array of dice in the hot melt is re-rolled at the end-As an alternative, or in addition to, charging the developer roll, it may be coated with a sulfide-based material like cadmium sulfide or something more benign like iron sulfide. Organic sulfides might also be used, or even vulcanized rubber. Gold attracts to sulfide better than most anything else, so th.ere might be a preference for the gold electrode side of the dice to prefer the sulfide-coated developer roller. In Step 3 above, the attraction of gold to sulfur may be used instead of, or in addition to, the electrostatics to align the dice, and then the charge on the transfer roll used to position the dice according to a desired pattern. The dice are then oriented with the gold electrode facing toward the developer roller with the light- emitting electrode oriented towards the transfer drum, then transferred to the hot melt adhesive gold electrode base down with the transparent electrode facing up.<br>
The image to be printed can be written on a commercially available laser printer. First the transfer drum is covered with a positive charge. Then the photosensitive drum is written on ("write black") with the laser under the control of the laser print engine, translating computer PCT or Postscript commands to the laser/mirror control unit to accurately write on the drum. The photoactive layer ejects electrons to cancel the positive charge in those areas and with the intensity of the<br><br>
V<br>
laser, converts that latent (neutral) image to a negatively-charged image on the transfer drum. This is the normal operation of the laser printer.<br>
The die-printing operation utilizes a relatively low resolution electrostatic laser "printer" with roughly 0.012" x 0.12" dice replacing trie usual toner. Alternatively, the dice can be fabricated having a magnetically attractive electrode, in which case, the developer roller and/or the drum can be magnetic systems, and may employ a optomagnetic coating for patterning.<br>
Only the negative areas written by the laser should receive dice from the developer roller. To implement this cleanly, the charge balance between the source and destination is adjusted so that the transfer takes place accurately and completely without disturbing the die orientation.<br>
The hot melt adhesive sheet (still solid) receives a negative charge and attracts the dice from the weaker-charged transfer drum. A so-called "detac corona" removes the charge from the hot melt sheet. The next step is similar to the fuser step in the commercial laser printer process except it is the substrate and not the toner that will soften. The proper selection of the hot melt softening temperature, or an adjustment of the fuser temperature and rate of motion or all of the above are used to get an optimum adhesion of the dice to the substrate. Rapid cooling with an air stream may be used for cooling the substrate. The resulting active layer made of hot melt adhesive with imbedded dice is then rolled up in a continuous process, or stacked as individual sheets.<br>

The lamination, is formed so that the adhesive electrically insulates and binds the top substrate to the bottom substrate. In so doing, one of the top device conductor and bottom device conductor of the semiconductor elements is in electrical communication with the conductive pattern of the top substrate and the other of the top device conductor and bottom device conductor of each semiconductor element is in electrical communication with the electrically conductive layer of the bottom substrate. In this manner, each semiconductor element is automatically connected to the top and bottom conductors that are preformed on the top and bottom substrates.<br><br>

In this case, magnetically attractive LED dice can be formed by including nickel or other magnetically attractive material on one side of the LED die. When the LED dice are scattered onto a release sheet, a single die fit into each through hole and become oriented due to the attractive force of the magnetic field sources.<br>
Figure 129(b) illustrates the method shown in Figure 129(a), showing the field attractive LED dice with some randomly scattered on top of a release sheet and some oriented and fixed to an adhesive substrate. When the magnetic field sources are removed, the dice that are on the release layer can be removed by gravity or air pressure, leaving the adhered and oriented dice in a fixed array pattern. Figure 129(c) illustrates the method shown in Figure 129(a), showing the field attractive LED dice left oriented and fixed to the adhesive substsrate. Figure 130(a) illustrates a method for mass producing a pattern of LED dice fixed to an adhesive substrate utilizing a<br><br>
displacement pin for selectively removing the dice from wafer dicing tape. A die ejector system, such as that used on a conventional semiconductor pick and place machine, is configured to remove a single chip from the wafer dicing tape and adhere it onto the adhesive substrate.

Figure 130(c) illustrates the method shown in Figure 130(a) showing the single die left on the adhesive substrate, and the adhesive substrate and the dicing sheet each being moved relative to the displacement pin to selectively locate the next LED die to be placed onto the adhesive substrate. The dicing sheet is moved to place the next LED die at the displacement pin position, and the adhesive substrate is moved so that the LED die is placed at the next desired LED placement location. Figure 130(d) illustrates a pattern of LED dice adhered to an adhesive substrate using the method shown in Figure 130(a);<br>
The adhesive substrate thus can be populated with a selectively formed pattern of LED dice. Since there is no pick and place probe involved, this system results in a very high chip placement capacity far exceeding that available by conventional pick and place machines.

In this case, an relatively inexpensive LED display can be formed with a very high pixel packing density due to the stacked construction of the sub-pixels (RGB) ofeach pixel.<br>

Figure 133(b) is an isolated view showing an LED die having a top and bottom chip reflector formed on the LED die for directing emitted light out the sides of the die, and showing additives within the adhesive substrate layer used, for example, to down convert UV radiation emitted by the LED die to visible white light.<br>
