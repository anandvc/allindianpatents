				<td>COMPOSITION COMPRISING PARASITE EGGS AND METHODS FOR ISOLA¬TION AND STORAGE OF PARASITE EGGS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a composition comprising eggs from a helminthic parasite and a method for treating, ameliorating, prophylactic or curative, an auto¬immune or allergic disease in an individual animal or man using eggs being sepa¬rated from the composition. The present invention further relates to methods for iso¬lation and storage of eggs of a helminthic parasite, and to a method for producing a pharmaceutical composition comprising a helminthic parasite preparation. The helminthic parasite eggs may be from the pig whipworm; Trichuris suis ova (TSO).<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
TSO is the raw material of an active pharmaceutical ingredient, intended for treat¬ment of autoimmune or allergic diseases.<br>
The use of parasite material for medical treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is described e.g. in US 6,764,838.<br>
The cause of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) appears to involve both genetic and environmental factors. Current theories suggest that IBD results from an abnormal immune response to intestinal bacteria, initiated by unknown causes. IBD is com¬mon in industrialized countries where helminthic colonization is rare. Conversely, it is rare in regions of the world where most people have worms. Helminths could be beneficial in many autoimmune or allergic diseases because of their unique capacity to decrease hyper-reactive immune responses, in support of this idea, helminths reduce intestinal inflammation in both mice and man.<br>
Members of helminth genus Trichuris are intestinal round worms (whipworms) with favorable characteristics for therapeutic use. Trichuris suis, the porcine whipworm, is genetically related to Trichuris trichiura, the human whipworm, but it has been shown experimentally to colonize humans only briefly without causing disease. The ova of T. suis can be produced using specific pathogen-free pigs, i.e. pigs free of infections with specified pathogens, and processed to assure absence of biological contaminants.<br><br>
For any production of TSO there are strict tolerances regarding the particle contami¬nation and microbial activity of the solution used as a media:<br>
1)	The isolation process should ensure a particle contamination of the solution beyond 2% or 1% counted as numbers.<br>
2)	The isolation process should ensure that other parasite eggs are eliminated.<br>
3)	The microbial profile should fulfill the requirements for an oral administration containing raw material of natural origin under category 3B of the European Pharmacopoeia.<br>
4)	The media used for the storage should allow the development of the egg from un-embryonated (non-infective) to embryonated (infective) eggs.<br>
5)	The media should preferably not hold antibiotics or other chemicals, which may cause allergic reactions in potential patient.<br>
6)	The media used for the storage should allow for further long time storage (3-5 yrs) without affecting the infectivity of the TSO to facilitate an extended shelf life of a medicinal product.<br>
7)	The method should be applicable for the high quantity recovery of eggs.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Helminthic parasites<br>
In defining a helminthic parasite, there are two groups. The first group is helminthic parasites that naturally colonize specified mammalian hosts, including humans, and the second group is helminthic parasites that do not successfully colonize the speci¬fied mammalian species, including man, but may afford protection to an individual if they become infected, due to stimulation of the immune system.<br>
In the first group, helminthic parasites are multi-cellular worms with complex life cy¬cles and development adjusted to the specific mammalian species. The nematodes (non-segmented round worms) and the platyhelminths (flat worms) are two groups of helminths that may colonize the human intestines. In accordance with the present invention, any one of a number of helminthic parasites that naturally colonize hu¬mans or animals will provide the intended results.<br>
Nematodes that frequently inhabit the human gut are Ascaris lumbricoides, En-terobius vermicularis (pin worm), Trichuris trichiura (whipworm), Ancylostoma duo-denale and Necator americanus (hookworms), and Strongyloides stercoralis. Trichi-nella spiralis infests the small intestine briefly but is rare.<br>
The platyhelminths include the trematodes and cestodes. The most common adult trematodes that reside in the human intestines are Fasciolopsis, Echinostoma and Heterophyes species. Those that live in the biliary system include Clonorchis sinen¬sis, Opisthorchis viverrini, O.felineus, and Fasciola hepatica and gigantica. Schisto¬soma species dwell in the venous system, but several species chronically affect the gut by the passage of eggs through the intestinal wall. Adult cestodes commonly infecting humans are Diphyllobothrium species (fish tapeworm), Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm), Taenia solium (pork tapeworm) and Hymenolepsis diminuta and H.nana (dwarf tapeworm).<br>
Other helminths of interest include the filarial parasites and the lung flukes. These do not have a gut phase, but stimulate strong immune responses (Th2-type).<br>
The second general group of helminthic parasites that can be utilized in the present invention include helminths that normally do not colonize the specified mammalian species, including man, but may afford protection against diseases including aller¬gies which are characterised by a "Th1-type" immune respons. These include Trichuris muris (mouse whipworm), Trichinella spiralis, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, Heligmosomoides polygyrus and Hymenolepsis nana, all of which are intestinal helminths infective to mice. Trichuris suis and Ascaris suum are pig helminths that can infect humans. Trichuris vulpis, Toxocara species, Toxascaris species, Gna-thostoma species, and Ancylostoma species are dog or cat helminths that also can infect humans. Anisakis and Pseudoterranova are nematodes of marine mammals that can be transmitted to humans. Bird schistosomes can transiently infect humans. Such schistosomes include S. douthitti, Trichobilharzia ocellata, T. stagnicolae, T. physellae, and Gigantobilharzia huronensis.<br>
Diseases Treatable Relevant to the Invention<br>
A. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (Crohn's disease, CD, and Ulcerative colitis, UC):<br>
Epidemiological data suggest genetic susceptibility to the development of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The incidence of CD in industrialized socie¬ties has increased from the 1950s and now is from 1 to 8 per 100,000 persons per year. This suggests that unknown changes in our environment have affected the frequency of CD.<br>
While the cause of IBD remains undetermined, it is presumed to result from dys-regulation of the intestinal mucosal immune system. Inflammatory cells in the mu¬cosa normally protect us from luminal contents. This highly effective chronic inflam¬mation is tightly controlled to limit tissue injury. IBD may result from inappropriately vigorous immune responses to luminal factors. CD appears to be an overly vigorous Th1-type inflammation that produces IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. The nature of UC is less well defined.<br>
There are several animal models of chronic intestinal inflammation. An important advance is the recent discovery that some mice with genetically engineered gene deletions can develop chronic bowel inflammation similar to IBD. These include mu¬tant mice bearing targeted deletions for IL-2, IL-10, MHC class II or TCR genes among others. Using some of these models has shown that a dysregulated immune system itself can mediate intestinal injury. The mucosal inflammation of several of these models generates large amounts of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha suggesting that excess production of Th1-type cytokines is one common mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of disease. Also, blocking Th1 circuitry prevents the inflammation. CD is also characterised by a high Th1 response. Thus, these models may have direct implications regarding the understanding of the immunopathology of this hu¬man disease process.<br>
B. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA):<br>
RA is a chronic disease featuring persistent inflammatory synovitis, usually involving peripheral joints in a symmetric distribution. This inflammation can lead to bone ero¬sions, cartilage damage and joint destruction. It is an affliction of about 1% of the population. The prevalence increases with age, and women are affected more fre-<br>
quently than men. The propagation of RA is an immunologically mediated event driven by CD4+ Th1 cells (type III hypersensitivity).<br>
C.	Insulin-Dependent, Juvenile Diabetes Mellitus (DM)(type 1):<br>
Type 1 DM is a disease that usually begins during early adulthood and that results from the inability to produce insulin in response to an increasing blood sugar con¬centration. Lac in insulin results in persistent high blood sugar levels and inability to properly metabolize glucose causes metabolic disturbances that eventually damage the eyes, kidneys, heart and other organs. Taking insulin parenterally can partially control these metabolic problems. Type 1 DM results from an autoimmune attack on the pancreatic beta cells, which are the source of insulin. Activated macrophages and cytotoxic T cells surround and destroy the pancreatic beta cells. Genetic sus¬ceptibility and poorly defined environmental events trigger the disease process.<br>
D.	Lupus Erythematosus (LE):<br>
LE is a systemic autoimmune disease that is most frequent in women of early to middle adulthood. The tissue damage is caused by autoantibodies and hyper¬reactive regulatory T cells. The abnormal immune response allows sustained pro¬duction of pathogenic autoantibodies and immune complexes, probably related to hypersensitivity type III. This leads to damage of the musculoskeletal, cutaneous, hematologic, renal tissues and other tissue systems. The abnormal immune re¬sponse probably depends upon the interaction of multiple hereditary and environ¬mental factors.<br>
E.	Sarcoidosis:<br>
Sarcoidosis is a chronic granulomatous disease of the lungs and other organs of unknown cause. Most patients present between the ages of 20-40. The most fre¬quent symptom is shortness of breath. The disease results from an exaggerated Th1-type, cellular immune response, probably to a limited number of antigens. Sar¬coidosis develops throughout the world and afflicts all races. However, there is re¬markable diversity of the prevalence of sarcoidosis among certain ethnic and racial groups. For instance, the disease is rare in Poland, Southeast Asia and India.<br>
F.	Multiple Sclerosis (MS):<br>
MS is a chronic relapsing, multifocal inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system that leads to focal demyelination and scarring of the brain. It is a frequent disease affecting about 1 mio people in the western world and which often begins during early to middle adulthood. MS is an autoimmune disease mediated at least in part by Th1 cells. The lesions of MS resemble those induced by delayed hypersensi¬tivity responses that contain activated T cells and macrophages. It is a disease of temperate climates, increasing in prevalence with distance from the equator.<br>
G.	Psoriasis<br>
Psoriasis is a chronic relapsing dermatitis, which may be found in 2-3% of the popu¬lations in the Western communities. The disease is typically diagnosed for the first time in 10 to 30 y old individuals and is associated with aberrant immune responses. The abnormal immune response probably depends upon multiple hereditary and poorly defined environmental factors.<br>
H. Autism<br>
Autism is characterised by behavioural and developmental deviations resulting in poor social performance. Autism may be found in up to 1 % of the population; how¬ever, the incidence is steadily increasing. The aetiology is unknown, but there is a strong genetic component, and the disease is particularly common in families with predisposition for autoimmune disorders, and therefore autoimmunity may be in¬volved.<br>
I. Allergy<br>
As for classical auto-immune diseases (such as diseases mentioned above), the relevance of helminth infection to modify hyper-reactive immune responses in aller¬gic disease phenotypes (e.g. type I hypersensitivity diseases like atopy, food allergy, asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis) should be seen in the context of the hygiene hypothesis. The incidences of these diseases are increasing steadily in the industrialized world with a high level of hygiene and sanitation. Observational stud¬ies on microbial exposures have most consistently reported that particularly helminth infection is associated with a reduced risk of atopy and allergic disease. Generally,<br>
helminth infection presents with a high level of IgE antibody in serum otherwise only seen in allergic disease. However, in allergic individuals, IgE against e.g. pollen trig¬gers allergic inflammation due to mast cell activation and degranulation with asso¬ciated immediate symptoms (e.g. swellings, sneezing and lacrymation), while helminth infection is often asymptomatic due to a state of hyporesponsiveness to the helminths. Infection with different species of helminth (e.g. schistosomes and hook¬worm) has been associated with reduced risk of atopy, suggesting a common bio¬logical mechanism. The state of hyporesponsiveness during helminth infection pre¬sents immunological characteristics, which are similar to those observed during ef¬fective allergen immune therapy for allergic rhinitis, including production of the cyto¬kine IL-10, and specific lgG4 to antigens/allergens. Both allergic reactions and helminth infection are characterised by a so-called Th2 cytokine profile (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13). However, during chronic helminth infection this profiles is modified by the cytokines IL-10 and TGF(3 believed to have anti-inflammatory regulatory properties. Murine models of helminth infection and allergic diseases support the above obser¬vations in humans.<br>
Observational studies have mostly focused on the relationship between asthma and helminths, and these studies further suggests that the observed reduction in risk of asthma might be stronger for infection with helminth species with a systemic phase in their human host, and/or to be strengthened with increasing intensity of infection measured by number of eggs in faeces. Currently, it is believed that helminths or their excretory products carry signature molecules that are particular suitable for the natural induction of a robust anti-inflammatory regulatory network that could prevent or alleviate symptoms of allergic disease. Evidence for a direct cause-effect rela¬tionship between helminth infection and reduced risk of allergic disease has been suggested by studies showing that anti-worm treatment in endemic areas effectively removes high worm burdens but such treatment is temporally associated with an increase in positive skin reactions to allergens (atopy).<br>
The occurrence of above mentioned disease complexes (A-G) have to a variable degree been described in domestic animals, although background and clinical mani¬festation may be different from the equivalent disease in humans. However, there is strong reason to believe that these diseases in animals are also treatable relevant to the invention.<br>
Evidence of the above-mentioned autoimmune and allergic diseases - as well as cure or amelioration thereof - is required to determine the need for treatment and to monitor treatment progress. The following procedures can be utilized to measure the clinical parameters of the above-mentioned diseases in man.<br>
1. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)<br>
Evaluation of inflammation: In mice, clinical evidence of disease includes weight loss, diarrhoea, rectal prolapse and histological evidence of intestinal inflammation. Thus, improvement in these parameters would signify amelioration of disease.<br>
To grade intestinal inflammation in animal models, tissue is removed, Swiss-rolled and embedded in paraffin according to standard methods. The sections are stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The degree of colonic inflammation is graded semi-quantitatively from 0 to 4 in a blinded fashion by a single pathologist using a stan¬dardized technique: 0=no inflammation; 1=low level inflammation; 2=intermediate level inflammation; 3=high level inflammation with wall thickening; and 4=transmural infiltration, and loss of goblet cells with wall thickening.<br>
To count mast cells, intestinal tissue samples from individual mice are prepared by the Swiss-roll technique, fixed in Camoy's fixative, paraffin embedded and proc¬essed for staining with Alcian Blue and safranin. Fifty adjacent fields of a given sec¬tion are scanned for mucosal mast cells in the lamina propria and muscle layers. Mast cells are identified by their distinctive intracellular granular staining with Alcian Blue. All samples are evaluated blindly.<br>
Disease activity in humans is monitored using various clinical, laboratory and histo¬logical criteria. There are several well established IBD disease activity indices that monitor clinical parameters like frequency of diarrhoea and abdominal pain. One particularly useful index for the assessment of Crohn's disease is the Crohn's Dis¬ease Activity Index, or CDAI. The CDAI incorporates 8 variables related to the dis¬ease activity and has been used in most recent studies of therapeutic agents in Crohn's disease. It includes the number of liquid or very soft stools, the severity of abdominal pain or cramping, general well-being, the presence of extra-intestinal<br>
manifestations of the disease, presence or absence of an abdominal mass, use of antidiarrhoeal drugs, hematocrit, and body weight. The composite score ranges from 0 to about 600. Scores below 150 indicate remission and scores above 450 indicate severe illness.<br>
A tested, accepted and disease specific quality of life questionnaire also may be administered prior to and after treatment to assess therapeutic progress. The Irvine Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire is a 32-item questionnaire. It evaluates quality of life with respect to bowel function (e.g. loose stools and abdominal pain), systemic symptoms (fatigue and altered sleep pattern), social function (work atten¬dance and the need to cancel social events) and emotional status (angry, de¬pressed, or irritable). The score ranges from 32 to 224, with higher scores indicating a better quality of life. Patients in remission usually score between 170 and 190.<br>
Also, helpful are endoscopic, x-ray and histological assessment of intestinal disease activity. C-reactive protein levels and blood cell sedimentation rate may also be monitored as systemic indicators of inflammation.<br>
2. Rheumatoid Arthritis<br>
Evaluation of inflammation: For mice with collagen-induced arthritis, mice are exam¬ined every other day and their paws scored as follows: 0, normal; 1, Erythema and mild swelling confined to the ankle joint or toes; 2. Erythema and mild swelling ex¬tending from the ankle to the midfoot; 3, Erythema and severe swelling extending from the ankle to the metatarsal joints; and 4, Ankylosing deformation with joint swelling. These arthritis scores can be correlated with the histological changes in the arthritic joints. Treatment success results in a decrease in the arthritis score with improvement in the histology.<br>
For pristane-induced arthritis, joints may be measured with a micrometer to detect swelling. In humans, RA is scored by measuring joint swelling, erythema, limitation of motion and pain. Additionally, synovial fluid may be analyzed for cytokine and inflammatory protein concentrations, and for leukocyte composition and function, according to methods known in the art. Synovial biopsies provide tissue for histo¬logical analysis according to methods known in the art.<br>
3. Lupus erythematosus<br>
Evaluation of inflammation: The normal development and function of the immune system critically depends on the removal of unwanted cells by a process called apoptosis. Cell-to-cell interactions through specific cell surface molecules and their receptors frequently trigger the process. One such system is called FAS and FAS ligand. Mice deficient in either FAS (LPR-l-mice) or FAS ligand (GLD-l-mice) de¬velop an autoimmune disease like lupus.<br>
Colonies of LPR or GLD mice are maintained in micro-isolator housing units under specific pathogen-free conditions. These mice can develop autoimmunity spontane¬ously, but more predictably after artificial induction. To induce disease, 8-wk-old mice are injected with an agent like pristane. Within two months, the mice have autoimmune disease. Many clinical, histological and immunological criteria useful for judging disease induction and amelioration in both mice and humans are well known in the art.<br>
4.	Juvenile Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (Type 1)<br>
Evaluation of inflammation: The NOD mouse develops type 1 diabetes mellitus simi¬lar to humans due to autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta cells. Clinical, biochemical, immunological and histological examination according to methods known in the art allow assessment of disease induction and amelioration in mice.<br>
5.	Sarcoidosis<br>
Evaluation of inflammation: In the bead embolization model of pulmonary inflamma¬tion, antigens are coupled to Sepharose beads, which are embolized to the lungs of mice via injection into their tail veins. The animals usually are pre-sensitized to the coupled antigen. The immune system of the host mounts a vigorous immune re¬sponse to the offending bead. These focal inflammatory responses, which can last for several weeks, can be examined histologically for size. Also, they can be isolated from tissue and studied for cell composition and cytokine production. Moreover, hilar lymph nodes and spleens are readily available for experimentation.<br>
Sarcoidosis, a disease of humans, usually involves the lung. Determination of sar¬coidosis and the extent of the disease may be made according to methods known in the art. Pulmonary function tests can assess lung compliance and function. Also, bronchiolar lavage obtains inflammatory cells that have infiltrated into the bronchial tree during the inflammatory process. These cells can be studied for composition and function. Pulmonary infiltrates and hilar lymphadenopathy are characteristic of sarcoidosis. Thus, periodic chest x-ray or CT scans can help assess disease activ¬ity. Serologic tests, such as measurement of angiotensin converting enzyme activity according to methods known in the art, can be used to gauge disease extent and activity.<br>
6.	Multiple Sclerosis<br>
Evaluation of inflammation: Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is induced in susceptible mice by repeated injection of appropriate sensitizing myelin antigens. Mice are assessed clinically according to the following criteria: 0, no disease; 1, tail atony; 2, hind-limb weakness; 3, hind-limb paralysis; 4, hind-limb paralysis and fore-limb paralysis or weakness; 5, moribund. For histological analysis, the spinal cords and brains are removed and fixed in formalin. The paraffin-embedded sections are stained and examined under light microscopy. Dispersed splenocytes and cells from other regions can be studied in-vitro. These parameters can help measure disease amelioration or improvement.<br>
In humans, MS disease activity is gauged by monitoring progression and remittance of neurological signs and symptoms. The most widely used outcome measurement is called The Expanded Disability Status Scale. Cerebral spinal fluid protein compo¬sition and cell content analyzed according to methods known in the art also may be used to monitor disease activity. Moreover, serial MRI studies show new gadolin¬ium-enhanced brain lesions.<br>
7.	Psoriasis<br>
Psoriasis may be measured simply by estimating the percentage of the skin that is affected with dermatitis or more adequately by the PASI (Psorisasis Activity and<br>
Severity Index) score that reflects the intensity of the skin lesions over time in com¬bination with the size of the affected skin area.<br>
8.	Autism<br>
Autism is a behavioral disorder and the severity of the symptoms can only be scored by behavioral studies.<br>
9.	Allergy<br>
Allergy is a complex of diseases associated with immediate symptoms as swellings, sneezing and lacrymation, and the scoring of diseases is among others done through measure of the severity of the specific symptoms related to exposure to the relevant allergen.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the following (steps 1-9) is given a detailed description of embodiments relating to the present invention. The embodiments cover recovery of parasite eggs (1, 2), re¬duction of particle contamination (3, 4), removal of foreign parasite eggs (5), wash¬ing in an acidic medium (6), embryonation of parasite eggs (7), storage of parasite eggs (8), and administration of a parasite egg suspension (9).<br>
1.   Recovery of parasite eggs from faeces (worms in situ) Pigs infected with the common intestinal worm T. suis will excrete parasite eggs to the faeces of the pigs approximately 7-9 weeks after they are inoculated. These eggs may be collected in high quantities from the faeces. The isolation process re¬lies on washing procedure on series of certified steel sieves (for example 1000, 500, 250, 100, 80, 70, 60, 50, and 20 µm mesh sizes) of large diameter (e.g. 0 450 mm). The repeated washing procedure on sieves with decreasing mesh size, allows the eggs to be efficiently washed off the undigested plant fibres in the faeces material. The parasite eggs are contained in the sieved fraction with particle size 20-50 µm. The 20-50 µm fraction is re-suspended in H2S04 (e.g. pH 0-2), eventually added antibiotics, to minimize pathogen growth and is further processed in steps 3 and/or 4 below.<br>
2.	Recovery of parasite eggs from worms (worms in vitro)<br>
Eggs may alternative be recovered in lower numbers from worms that are isolated directly from the intestine of pigs. After repeated washes in media with antibiotics, the worms are kept in vitro in growth media with antibiotics or other preservatives wherein they lay their eggs. The eggs are separated from the media by filtration on a 50 µm sieve followed by filtration on a 20 µm sieve. The resulting 20-50 µm fraction is further processed in steps 3 and/or 4 below.<br>
3.	Reduction of particle contamination by flotation<br>
The egg suspensions originating from step 1 and/or step 2 constitute the initial ma¬terial for a further reduction of contents of unwanted particles. In these suspensions, all particles are between 20 and 50 µm, but the eggs have lower density than most of the other particle (plant fibres and mineral particles). Therefore, the eggs may float in flotation fluids with specific gravidity of more than 1.18 g per ml, such as a saturated salt-sugar suspension, such as sodium chloride-glucose, or the eggs may float in solutions of magnesium sulphate or zinc chloride. By centrifugation, the eggs will float and the debris sediment. The floated eggs are isolated and washed on a 20 µm sieve and re-suspended in H2S04 (e.g. pH 0-2).<br>
4.	Reduction of particle contamination by filtration<br>
The egg suspensions resulting from steps 1, 2 and/or 3, containing particles in the size range of 20-50 µm, is further cleaned by filtration at disposable nylon net with certified mesh size of 30-35 µm, recovering the eggs on 20-25 µm nylon net.<br>
5.	Removal of foreign parasite eggs by filtration<br>
The filtration of the suspension at 30-35 µm ensures that the foreign parasite eggs, which may have been in the original faecal solution, are retained. Although Trichuris suis eggs are up to 80 µm in length they are only around 23-30 µm in width, slender and lemon-shaped and will orientate in the longitudinal direction of the current of the solution that passes a sieve. Thus, experiments have shown T. suis eggs will pass a 30 µm sieve. Other eggs with the potential to infect pigs will not: Ascaris suum (50-84 µm), Metastrongylus (38-64 µm) Strongyloides 30-57 µm, Globocephalus (40-72 µm), Oesophagostomum (38-83 µm), Hyostrongylus (31-76 µm), Macracanthorhyn-chus (65-110 µm). The eggs of a common round worm of cats and dogs Toxocara (75-90 µm) will also be retained.<br>
6.	Washing and pathogen inactivation by H2S04 (e.g. pH 0-2)<br>
Following the filtration, the suspension is washed repeatedly in H2S04 (e.g. pH 0-2), to reduce any pathogen or pathogen spores by dilution. Further pathogen growth is prevented by H2S04 (e.g. pH 0-2).<br>
7.	Embryonation of Trichuris suis egg (TSO) in H2S04 (e.g. pH 0-2)<br>
The suspension is stored in an incubator at temperatures of 15-30°C for develop¬ment of the eggs from un-embryonated to embryonated. The process, embryonation will take from 2-6 months depending on incubation temperature.<br>
8.	Storage of Trichuris suis eggs (TSO) in H2S04 (e.g. pH 0-2)<br>
After embryonation, the pharmaceutical raw material, can be stored at temperatures in the range of 1-10°C with unchanged infectivity in periods up to several year. Thus, the larvae inside the egg will remain infective in this period. The acid will prevent pathogen growth.<br>
9.	Oral administration of egg suspension (TSO) in H2S04 (e.g. pH 0-2)<br>
The suspension containing the embryonated helminthic eggs (with infective larvae) can be administered directly to an individual (man or animal) as an oral suspension either in capsules or by other means.<br>
Methods and/or embodiments relating to the present invention are further described in the flow charts shown in Figs. 1-3.<br>
Fig. 1 is a flow chart illustrating methods for the isolation of parasite eggs from fae¬ces (worms in situ) or intestinal worms (worms in vitro) of pigs infected with the whipworm Trichuris suis according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In Fig. 1 the starting point is inoculation of pigs with parasite material 101. Then in order to recover parasite eggs, two routes may be followed. The first route in Fig. 1 corresponds to step 2 outlined above and comprises the steps: Taking out the intes¬tine 102a; harvesting the worms 103a; washing the worms 104a; in vitro recovery of eggs in the media used for cultivation of worms 105a; filtering and re-suspension of eggs in sulphuric acid (H2S04) to minimize bacterial growth 106a; and ending up<br>
with raw material for reduction of particle contamination 107. The second route in Fig. 1 corresponds to step 1 discussed above and comprises the steps: Collecting fecal material 102b; suspending and sieving the fecal material 103b; recovery of a sieved fraction 104b; in vitro isolation of eggs from fecal material 105b; filtering and re-suspension of eggs in sulphuric acid (H2S04) to minimize bacterial growth 106b; and ending up with raw material for reduction of particle contamination 107.<br>
Fig. 2 is a flow chart illustrating a method for reduction of particle contamination and removal of foreign parasite eggs in a suspension of eggs of the pig whipworm Trichuris suis according to an embodiment of the present invention. The route de¬scribed in the flowchart of Fig. 2 corresponds to steps 3-6 discussed above. The starting point is the raw material of eggs recovered from worms or feces following step 107 of Fig. 1, Then the method illustrated in Fig. 2 follows the steps: sieving and re-suspension of the eggs in a salt-sugar flotation fluid 201; centrifugation and isolation of floated eggs 202; discarding the sediment with foreign particles with density larger than the salt-sugar flotation fluid 203; re-suspending the floated eggs in sulphuric acid H2S04 204; filtration of the egg suspension through a nylon net with mesh size of 30-50 micrometer 205, followed by removal of particles and foreign parasite eggs larger than 30 micro meters; filtration of the egg suspension on nylon net with mesh size of 20 micrometer thereby removing particles smaller than 20 mi¬crometers 206; repeated washing in sulphuric acid 207 to thereby reduce pathogens by dilution; adjusting the concentration of eggs in the solution 208; and storing the eggs in sulphuric acid 209 to thereby obtain raw material for embryonation of eggs.<br>
Fig. 3 is a flow chart illustrating a method for embryonation, storage and preparation of eggs of the pig whipworm Trichuris suis to be used as a raw material for a phar¬maceutical agent for oral administration according to an embodiment of the present invention. The route described in the flowchart of Fig. 3 corresponds to steps 7-9 discussed above. The starting point is the raw material of eggs cleaned by flotation and sieving step 209 of Fig. 2. Then the method illustrated in Fig. 3 follows the steps: embryonation of eggs in sulphuric acid at 15-30°C for 2-6 months with re¬peated stirring or shaking 301 and continuous observations of the development from undifferentiated eggs into eggs containing larvae (embryonation) 302; the embryo¬nation is allowed to progress until the embryonation coefficient is in the range of 60-90% or over 90% 303; washing of eggs in 2-10°C sulphuric acid H2S04 304; adjust-<br>
ing the concentration of eggs in the solution for bulk storage 305; storage of eggs at 1-10°C in sulphuric acid (H2S04), eventually added antibiotics, to thereby prevent pathogen growth 306; adjusting the concentration of eggs in the solution to require¬ments for the pharmaceutical raw material 307, which may be followed by the prepa¬ration of a standardized suspension; a dose of the egg solution may be put into shipment containers 308, which may be followed by packing and labeling, control, release and distribution.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates the lifecycle of the pig whipworm Trichuris suis. Adult worms are found in and on the wall 401 of the large intestine of the pig 402. Eggs from the worm can be obtained in two ways: 1) either worms are transferred to a culture dish where they are incubated in a media 403 in which they lay their eggs, or 2) eggs are recovered directly from feces by sieving the fecal material. The resulting eggs from either 1) or 2) are un-embryonated 404 which contains undifferentiated material. After storage in acidic media for 2-6 months, eventually added antibiotics, eggs be¬come embryonated 405 with a clearly visible larval structure inside. It is these em-bryonated eggs that constitute the active pharmaceutical agent for oral administra¬tion, Trichuris suis ova (TSO).<br>
