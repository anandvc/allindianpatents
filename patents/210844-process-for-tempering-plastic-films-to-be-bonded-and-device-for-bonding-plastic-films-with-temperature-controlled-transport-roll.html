				<td>Process for Tempering Plastic Films To Be Bonded and<br>
Device for Bonding Plastic Films with<br>
Temperature Controlled Transport Roll<br>
The invention relates to a process for tempering plastic films in accordance with the preamble of<br>
claim 1 and a device for bonding plastic slips in accordance with the preamble of claim 9.<br>
Processes and devices for bonding plastic films on tubular pieces or workpieces, which are also often<br>
made of plastic film, are known from the literature. When several thermoplastic elements are bonded<br>
together, it is often practical to heat these elements and thus to etch at least their surface.<br>
In this respect the term bond combines several different methods of joining plastic films, whereby<br>
the process temperature is a factor. Usually, as stated above, the surface of the plastic film is<br>
plasticized or melted by heating and then bonded or welded under pressure.<br>
However, the term bonding is also defined by the classical term cementing, where another substance<br>
- which can be an adhesive - is applied additionally on one or both films. This substance can be an<br>
adhesive, which is initially liquid and then hardens. The third substance can also be tempered -<br>
optionally together with the film surfaces - and raised to a temperature that is appropriate for<br>
bonding. In this case, too, the two films are finally joined together under pressure.<br><br>
According to the past state of the art, slips and workpieces are brought together in a roll slit. The<br>
contact surfaces of the elements to be bonded are heated inside the roll slit with hot air.<br>
To obtain reliably repeatablc results, the DE 198 18 720 shows a device, where the temperature of<br>
the already bonded elements is measured as the actual value after passage through the roll slit. The<br>
temperature of the hot air stream is adjusted according to this actual value.<br>
However, setting the bonding temperature only by means of a suitable air stream has drawbacks.<br>
Thus, it takes sometimes several hours until the device modules adjacent to the roll slit have reached<br>
the working temperature. Therefore, the film is not exposed to the temperature effect of the air<br>
stream until in the immediate environment of the roll slit. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the<br>
film"s speed of passage through the roll slit during the run-in phase so that the film assumes the<br>
desired temperature.<br>
The object of the present invention is to shorten this run-in phase so that the device can work faster<br>
at high speed. The invention solves the problem in that the plastic film is already tempered before<br>
reaching the roll slit.<br>
This process can be carried out by tempering those parts of the conveyor that transport the plastic<br>
film to be bonded into the roll slit and by setting in this manner the temperature of the film.<br>
The tempering can be limited, for example, to a conveying roll, but it can also be performed on the<br>
vacuum roll, or conveying and storage elements, positioned upstream in the conveying roll"s<br>
processing direction, or on deflecting rolls or groups of belts, which interact with the conveying roll,<br>
liven a combination of the tempering of the aforementioned elements is conceivable. Even an<br>
integration of additional temperable elements, which fulfill<br>
neither a transport nor a storage function, but make mechanical contact with the film to be bonded<br>
during transport or storage, is possible. All of these possibilities are included in the phrase "devices<br>
that transport or store the film" in the characterizing part of claim 2.<br>
The advantages of the invention include, besides the aforementioned shortening of the run-in phase,<br>
also a more efficient use of the supplied energy, since the air used in the past represents a relatively<br>
expensive form of thermal energy transfer.<br>
The process of the invention can be combined with other processes for setting a suitable melting or<br>
bonding temperature, such as the aforementioned heating of the film in the roll slit by means of hot<br>
air or the heating of the workpieces in front of the roll slit.<br>
Since the use of different beatable elements, the accumulation of the heat of friction or the process<br>
heat, and the ambient temperature can result in the necessity to cool, instead of heat, this application<br>
uses the word "tempering", which includes both heating and cooling.<br>
Temperature transfer from a conveying roll, made of cast material, to the plastic film, has proved to<br>
be especially appropriate, since this type of roll has a high thermal capacity. Hence, it exhibits a<br>
thermal inertia that is advantageous for a stable process, and in addition, makes relatively long<br>
contact with the film to be bonded.<br>
Other advantages and advantageous embodiments of the invention follow from the other claims and<br>
the following description of the subject matter.<br>
Embodiments of the invention are explained in detail below with reference to the drawings.<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic drawing of a side view of a device for applying and bonding slips on<br>
workpicces and additional hot air is blown into the roll slit.<br>
Figure 2 is a top view of an assembled block bottom with cover sheet cemented on the bottom.<br>
Figure 3 is a raised bottom with a valve slip cemented on a corner fold.<br>
Figure 4 is a detail of a side view as in Figure 1, where an additional heating coil is drawn in the<br>
transport cylinder.<br>
A frame, which is not illustrated, holds a table plate 1, on which tubular pieces made of plastic,<br>
which arc collapsed continuously in the direction of the A arrow and exhibit raised or assembled<br>
bottoms, are conveyed by means of conveyors, which are not illustrated. In the case of the tubular<br>
pieces 2, conveyed so as to lie transversely at an equidistance from each other, the assembled<br>
bottoms or the raised bottoms arc folded in the plane of the collapsed tubular pieces, as shown in<br>
Figures 2 and 3. In the machine frame a countcrprcssure roll 4 and a suction roll 5, which form<br>
together a pair of conveying rolls and whose roll slit lies in the area of the plane of the top side of<br>
the table 1, are mounted in a transverse slit 3 of the table 1. The jacket of the suction cylinder 5 is<br>
provided with rows of suction air holes 6 at approximately equal angular distances. The suction air<br>
is withdrawn in the usual manner from the interior of the suction cylinder 6 through the rotary<br>
passage, which is not illustrated.<br>
A knife and conveying cylinder 7 is mounted above the suction cylinder 5 in the machine frame. The<br>
slips 8, severed from the ejidless web of plastic (not illustrated), are pressed against said knife and<br>
conveying cylinder by means of a belt 9 of a continuous group of belts 10, which run over<br><br><br>
deflecting rolls 11,12,13, which are mounted above the machine frame and of which the roll 13 can<br>
also be driven. The knife and conveying cylinder 7 is provided in the usual manner with a knife 14,<br>
running along a surface line.<br>
A plate 16. which serves to temper and thus set the appropriate temperature of the tubular pieces 2,<br>
ends in front of the roll slit of the pair of cylinders 4, 5. To this end, this plate can lead thermal<br>
energy to or away from the tubular pieces. However, this plate is hereinafter referred to as the<br>
cooling plate 16 for the sake of simplicity. This cooling plate 16 is provided with an inlet side 17,<br>
which is bent upwards. The cooling plate 16, 17 is provided with pipes, which are intended for a<br>
coolant or heating medium and exhibit a meandering and / or serpentine shape. A medium flows<br>
through said pipes. This medium, for example water, is passed through the hose lines (not illustrated)<br>
into the connecting piece 18 and withdrawn again out of the connecting discharge piece 19. An<br>
inclined guide 20, on which a heating unit 21 can be moved back and forth between the stops 22,23<br>
of the guide 20 by means of a pressure medium piston cylinder unit 24, is mounted above the cooling<br>
plate 16,17 in the machine frame. The front end of the heating unit is provided with a pipe 25 for<br>
blowing out the hot air. The pipe 25 exhibits a rotary slide valve 26, whose slide valve can be moved<br>
into an open and closed position as well as intermediate positions, by means of an actuating lever<br>
27. To actuate the iever 27, there is a pressure medium piston cylinder unit 28, which is hinged, on<br>
the one hand, to the hot air unit 21 and, on the other hand, to the actuating lever 27. One outlet of<br>
the rotary slide valve 26 opens into a pipe 29, which bears a slit die 30, which is aimed at the slit<br>
between the rolls 4,5. The other outlet of the rotary slide valve 26 opens into a pipe 32, which opens<br>
into the open air or withdraws the hot air.<br>
The suction cylinder 5 accepts the slips 8 in the illustrated manner from the knife and conveying<br>
cylinder 7 and puts them in the correct position on the sack workpieces travelling through. At the<br>
same time hot air is blown at controlled times through the slit die 30 into the roll slit, in which the<br>
slip 8 and the workpiece 2 are located. Said hot air<br>
plasticizcs or melts the plastic material in such a manner that the slips 8 bond to the workpieces 2.<br>
The hot air feed is time-controlled by means of a control unit by way of the pressure medium piston<br>
cylinder unit 28. Furthermore, the distance between the slit die 30 and the roll slit can be set, as<br>
desired, by means of the pressure medium piston cylinder unit 24.<br>
In the emboditnenis, shown in Figures 1 to 4, not only the hot air feed but also the temperature of<br>
the suction cylinder 6, the conveying cylinder 7 and the cooling plate 16 can be regulated. In the case<br>
of extreme applications, it can even be necessary to blow cold air, instead of hot air, into the roll slit.<br>
The volume of air blown in per unit time is another parameter for setting the temperature.<br>
Figure 2 depicts a workpiece, which consists of an assembled block bottom, on which is cemented<br>
a bottom slip 8".<br>
Figure 3 depicts a sack vvorkpiece 2 with the bottoms, which are still open and where the valve slip<br>
8" is cemented on the leading corner fold of one bottom. This valve slip yields a valve tube when<br>
the side folds arc folded in the well-known manner.<br>
The device, depicted in Figure 1, is provided twice on both sides of the table 1, when both bottoms,<br>
molded to the tubular pieces 2, are to be provided simultaneously with bottom cover sheets 8".<br>
Directly behind the pair of rolls, comprising the counterpressure roll 4 and the suction roll 5, the<br>
temperature of the bonded area of the tubular pieces 2 is measured by means of a temperature probe,<br>
in the illustrated embodiment by means of an infrared pyrometer 43, which is mounted in the<br>
machine frame at a predetermined distance above the workpieces passing out.<br>
The measurement signals of the temperature probe 43 are sent over a signal line 44 to the control and<br>
regulating unit 40,<br>
In this embodiment this control and regulating unit regulates the temperature of the rolls 6 and 7 and<br>
the cooling plate 16 over signal lines (not illustrated) and by means of healing and cooling elements<br>
(not illustrated).<br>
Only the control or regulating elements for the temperature of the heating unit 21 or the air, which<br>
is heated by this heating unit and serves the purpose of bonding, are shown in the drawing.<br>
The temperature signals of the temperature probe 43 are sent over a signal line 41 to the control and<br>
regulating unit 40, which consists of a computer. The control and regulating unit 40 controls the<br>
temperature of the heated air, which is blown out, by means of a control line 42, which<br>
correspondingly raises or lowers the temperature oi the electric heating elements of the heating unit<br>
21.<br>
The temperature of the table 1 is measured behind the slit of the rolls 4,5 by means of a temperature<br>
probe 45, whose signals are sent over a signal line 46 to the control and regulating unit 40. The<br>
temperature probe 45 measures in essence the temperature of the device so that the temperature of<br>
the hot air, blown out of the slit die 30, can be preset by the control and regulating unit.<br>
Independently of the described control, the temperature of the hot air, blown out of the slit die 30,<br>
can also be set manually at the control and regulating unit, a feature that can be practical for<br>
presetting the temperature.<br>
Figure 4 shows a detail of a side view, as depicted in Figure 1. However, the embodiment, depicted<br>
in Figure 4, includes a heating coil, which is indicated by the serpentine line 50. This embodiment<br>
presents only as an example one possibility for tempering a cylinder.<br><br><br>
