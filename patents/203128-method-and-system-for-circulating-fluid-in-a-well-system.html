TITLE OF THE INVENTION "METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR CIRCULATING FLUID IN A WELL SYSTEM"<br><br><br>
of 5485 Beltline Road, Dallas, TX<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br><br>
METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR CIRCULATING FLUID IN A WELL SYSTEM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to systems and methods for the recovery of subterranean resources and, more particularly, to a method and system for circulating fluid in a well system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Subterranean deposits of coal, also referred to as coal seams, contain substantial quantities of entrained methane gas. Production and use of methane gas from coal deposits has occurred for many years. Substantial obstacles, however, have frustrated more extensive development and use of methane gas deposits in coal seams.<br>
For example, one problem of production of gas from coal seams may be the difficulty presented at times by over-balanced drilling conditions caused by low reservoir pressure and aggravated by the porosity of the coal seam. During both vertical and horizontal surface drilling operations, drilling fluid is used to remove cuttings from the well bore to the surface. The drilling fluid exerts a hydrostatic pressure on the formation which, when exceeding the pressure of the formation, can result in a loss of drilling fluid into the formation. This results in entrainment of drill cuttings in the formation, which tends to plug the pores, cracks, and fractures that are needed to produce the gas.<br>
Certain methods are available to drill in an under-balanced state. Using a gas such as nitrogen in the drilling fluid reduces the hydrostatic pressure, but other problems can occur, including increased difficulty<br>
2<br><br>
in maintaining a desired pressure condition in the well system during drill string tripping and connecting operations.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a method and system for circulating fluid in a well system that substantially eliminates or reduces at least some of the disadvantages and problems associated with previous fluid circulation methods and systems.<br>
In accordance with a particular embodiment of the present invention, a method for circulating drilling fluid in a well system includes drilling a substantially vertical well bore from a surface to a subterranean zone and drilling an articulated well bore from the surface to the subterranean tone using a drill string. The articulated well bore is horizontally offset from the substantially vertical well bore at the surface and intersects the substantially vertical well bore at a junction proximate the subterranean zone. The method includes drilling a drainage bore from the junction into the subterranean zone and pumping a drilling fluid through the drill string when drilling the drainage bore. The drilling fluid exits the drill string proximate a drill bit of the drill string. The method also includes providing fluid down the substantially vertical well bore through a tubing. The tubing has an opening at the junction such that the fluid exits the tubing at the junction. A fluid mixture returns up the substantially vertical well bore outside of the tubing. The fluid mixture comprises the drilling fluid after the drilling fluid exits the drill string.<br>
3<br><br><br>
The fluid provided down the substantially vertical well bore may comprise gas, such as compressed air. The fluid mixture returning up the substantially vertical well bore may comprise gas provided down the substantially vertical well bore through the tubing after the gas exits the tubing, fluid from the subterranean zone or cuttings from the subterranean zone. The method may also include varying a flow rate of the fluid provided down the substantially vertical well bore to achieve control a bottom hole pressure to achieve an under-balanced, over-balanced or balanced drilling condition.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment, a method for circulating drilling fluid in a well system includes drilling a substantially vertical well bore from a surface to a subterranean zone and drilling an articulated well bore from the surface to the subterranean zone using a drill string. The articulated well bore_ is horizontally offset from the substantially vertical well bore at the surface and intersects the substantially vertical well bore at a junction proximate the subterranean zone. The method includes drilling a drainage bore from the junction into the subterranean zone and pumping a drilling fluid through the drill string when drilling the drainage bore. The drilling fluid exits the drill string proximate a drill bit of the drill string. The method also includes providing a pump string down the substantially vertical well bore. The pump string comprises a pump inlet proximate the junction. The method includes pumping a fluid mixture up the substantially vertical well bore through the pump string, the fluid mixture entering the pump string at the pump inlet.  The method may include varying the speed of<br>
4<br><br><br>
the pumping of the fluid mixture up the substantially vertical well bore through the pump string to control a bottom hole pressure to achieve a desired drilling condition, such as an over-balanced, under-balanced or balanced drilling condition.<br>
Technical advantages of particular embodiments of the present invention include a method and system for circulating drilling fluid in a well system that includes providing gas down a substantially vertical well bore. The flow rate of the gas provided down the substantially * vertical well bore may be varied in order to achieve a desired drilling condition, such as an over-balanced, under-balanced or balanced drilling condition. Accordingly, the flexibility of the drilling and retrieval process nay be improved.<br>
Another technical advantage of particular embodiments of the present invention includes a level of fluid in an articulated well bore that acts as a fluid seal to resist the flow of formation fluid that might escape the drill rig during a drilling process. The formation fluid resisted may comprise poisonous gas, such as hydrogen sulfide. Accordingly, drilling equipment and personnel may be isolated from the flow of poisonous gas to the surface thus increasing the safety of the drilling system.<br>
Still another technical advantage of particular embodiments of the present invention is a method and system for circulating drilling fluid in a well system that includes pumping a fluid mixture up a substantially vertical well bore through a pump string. The fluid mixture may comprise drilling fluid used in the drilling process and cuttings from the subterranean zone. Gas from the subterranean zone may bypass the pump string<br>
5<br><br><br><br><br><br>
enabling such gas to be recovered or flared separately from other fluid in the drilling system. Moreover, the speed of the pumping of the fluid mixture up the substantially vertical well bore may be varied to achieve a desired drilling condition, such as an over-balanced, under-balanced or balanced drilling condition.<br>
Other technical advantages will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the figures, descriptions and claims included herein. Moreover, while specific advantages have been enumerated above, various embodiments may include all, some or none of the enumerated advantages.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIGURE 1 illustrates the circulation of fluid in a well system 10. The well system includes a subterranean zone that may comprise a coal seam. It will be understood that other subterranean zones can be similarly accessed using the dual well system of the present invention to remove and/or produce water, hydrocarbons, gas and other fluids in the subterranean zone and to treat minerals in the subterranean zone prior to mining operations.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 1, a substantially vertical well bore 12 extends from a surface 14 to a target layer subterranean zone 15. Substantially vertical well bore 12 intersects and penetrates subterranean zone 15. Substantially vertical well bore 12 may be lined with a suitable well casing 16 that terminates at or above the level of the coal seam or other subterranean zone 15.<br>
An enlarged cavity 20 may be formed in substantially vertical well bore 12 at the level of subterranean zone 15. Enlarged cavity 20 may have a different shape in different embodiments. Enlarged cavity 20 provides a junction for intersection of substantially vertical well<br>
7<br><br><br>
bore 12 by an articulated well bore used to form a drainage bore in subterranean zone 15. Enlarged cavity 20 also provides a collection point for fluids drained from subterranean zone 15 during production operations. A vertical portion of substantially vertical well bore 12 continues below enlarged cavity 2 0 to form a sump 22 for enlarged cavity 20,<br>
An articulated well bore 30 extends from the surface 14 to enlarged cavity 20 of substantially vertical well bore 12. Articulated well bore 30 includes a substantially vertical portion 32, a substantially horizontal portion 34, and a curved or radiused portion 36 interconnecting vertical and horizontal portions 32 and 34. Horizontal portion 34 lies substantially in the horizontal plane of subterranean zone 15 and intersects enlarged cavity 20 of substantially vertical well bore 12. In particular embodiments, articulated well bore 30 may not include a horizontal portion, for example, if subterranean zone 15 is not horizontal. In such cases, articulated well bore 30 may include a portion substantially in the same plane as subterranean zone 15.<br>
Articulated well bore 30 may be drilled using an articulated drill string 40 that includes a suitable down-hole motor and drill bit 42. A drilling rig 67 is at the surface. A measurement while drilling (MWD) device 44 may be included in articulated drill string 4 0 for controlling the orientation and direction of the well bore drilled by the motor and drill bit 42. The substantially vertical portion 32 of the articulated well bore 30 may be lined with a suitable casing 38.<br>
After enlarged cavity 20 has been successfully intersected by articulated well bore 30, drilling is continued through enlarged cavity 20 using articulated<br>
8<br><br><br>
drill string 40 and appropriate horizontal drilling apparatus to drill a drainage bore 50 in subterranean zone 15. Drainage bore 50 and other such well bores include sloped, undulating, or other inclinations of the coal seam or subterranean zone 15.<br>
During the process of drilling drainage bore 50, drilling fluid (such as drilling "mud") is pumped down articulated drill string 40 using pump 64 and circulated out of articulated drill string 40 in the vicinity of drill bit 42, where it is used to scour the formation and to remove formation cuttings. The drilling fluid is also used to power drill bit 42 in cutting the formation. The general flow of the drilling fluid through and out of drill string 40 is indicated by arrows 60.<br>
System 10 includes a valve 66 and a valve 68 in the piping between articulated well bore 30 and pump 64. When drilling fluid is pumped down articulated drill string 40 during drilling, valve 66 is open. While connections are being made to articulated drill string 40, during tripping of the drill string or in other cases when desirable, valve 68 is opened to allow fluid (i.e. drilling fluid or compressed air) to be pumped down articulated well bore 30 outside of articulated drill string 40, in the annulus between articulated drill string 40 and the surfaces of articulated well bore 30. Pumping fluid down articulated well bore 30 outside of articulated drill string 40 while active drilling is not occurring, such as during connections and tripping of the drill string, enables an operator to maintain a desired bottom hole pressure of articulated well bore 30. Moreover, fluids may be provided through both valve 66 and valve 68 at the same time if desired.   In the<br>
9<br><br><br><br>
illustrated embodiment, valve 68 is partially open to allow fluid to fall through articulated well bore 30.<br>
When pressure of articulated well bore 3 0 is greater than the pressure of subterranean zone 15 (the "formation pressure"), the well system is considered over-balanced. When pressure of articulated well bore 30 is less than the formation pressure,  the well system s considered under-balanced.  In an over-balanced drilling situation, drilling fluid and entrained cuttings may be lost into subterranean  zone  15.    Loss  of  drilling  fluid  and cuttings into the formation is not only expensive in terms of the lost drilling fluids, which must be made up, but it tends to plug the pores in the subterranean zone, which are needed to drain the zone of gas and water.<br>
A fluid, such as compressed air or another suitable gas, may be provided down substantially vertical well bore 12 through a tubing 80. In the illustrated embodiment, gas is provided through tubing 80; however it should be understood that other fluids may be provided through tubing 80 in other embodiments. The gas may be provided through the tubing using an air compressor 65, a pump or other means. The flow of the gas is generally represented by arrows 76. The tubing has an open end 82 at enlarged cavity 2 0 such that the gas exits the tubing at enlarged cavity 20.<br>
The flow rate of the gas or other fluid provided down substantially vertical well bore 12 may be varied in order to change the bottom hole pressure of articulated well bore 30. Furthermore, the composition of gas or other fluid provided down substantially vertical well bore 12 may also be changed to change the bottom hole pressure. By changing the bottom hole pressure of articulated well bore 30, a desired drilling condition<br>
10<br><br><br>
such  as   under-balanced,   balanced   or   over-balanced   may   be<br>
achieved.<br>
The drilling fluid pumped through articulated drill string 40 mixes with the gas or other fluid provided through tubing 80 forming a fluid mixture. The fluid mixture flows up substantially vertical well bore 12 outside of tubing 80.' Such flow of the fluid mixture is generally represented by arrows 74 of FIGURE 1. The fluid mixture may also comprise cuttings from the drilling of subterranean zone 15 and fluid from subterranean zone 15, such as water or methane gas. Drilling fluid pumped through articulated well bore 30 outside of articulated drill string 40 may also mix with the gas to form the fluid mixture flowing up substantially vertical well bore 12 outside of tubing SO.<br>
Articulated well bore 30 also includes a level 39 of fluid. Level 39 of fluid may be formed by regulating the fluid pump rate of pump 64 and/or the injection rate of air compressor 65. Such level of fluid acts as a fluid seal to provide a resistance to the flow of formation fluid, such as poisonous formation gas (for example, hydrogen sulfide), up articulated well bore 30. Such resistance results from a hydrostatic pressure of the level of fluid in articulated well bore 30. Thus, rig 6? and rig personnel may be isolated from formation fluid, which may include poisonous gas, flowing up and out of articulated well bore 30 at the surface. Furthermore, a larger annulus in substantially vertical well bore 12 will allow for the return of cuttings to the surface at a lower pressure than if the cuttings were returned up articulated well bore 30 outside of articulated drill string 40.<br>
11<br><br><br>
A desired bottom hole pressure may be maintained during drilling even if additional collars of articulated drill string 40 are needed, since the amount of gas pumped down substantially vertical well bore 12 may be varied to offset the change in pressure resulting from the use of additional drill string collars.<br>
FIGURE 2 illustrates the circulation of fluid in a well system 410 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. System 410 is similar in . many respects to system 10 of FIGURE 1, however the circulation of fluid in system 410 differs from the circulation of fluid in system 10. System 410 includes a substantially vertical well bore 412 and an articulated well bore 430. Articulated well bore 430 intersects substantially vertical well bore 412 at an enlarged cavity 420. Articulated well bore 430 includes a substantially vertical portion 432, a curved portion 436 and a substantially horizontal portion 434. Articulated well bore intersects an enlarged cavity 420 of substantially vertical well bore 412. Substantially horizontal portion 434 of articulated well bore 430 is drilled through subterranean zone 415. Articulated well bore 430 is drilled using an articulated drill string 440 which includes a down-hole motor and a drill bit 442. A drainage bore 450 is drilled using articulated drill string 440.<br>
A drilling fluid is pumped through articulated drill string 440 as described above with respect to FIGURE 1. The general flow of such drilling fluid is illustrated by arrows 460. The drilling fluid may mix with fluid and/or cuttings from subterranean zone 450 after the drilling fluid exits articulated drill string 440.   Using valve<br>
12<br><br><br>
468, fluids may be provided down articulated well bore 430 outside of articulated drill string 440 during connection or tripping operations or otherwise when desirable, such as the falling fluid illustrated in FIGURE 1.<br>
A fluid, such as compressed air, may be provided down substantially vertical well bore 41? in the annulus between a tubing 480 and the surface of substantially vertical well bore 412. In the illustrated embodiment, gas is provided down substantially vertical well bore 412 outside of tubing 480; however it should be understood that other fluids may be provided in other embodiments. The gas or other fluid may be provided using an air compressor 4 65, a pump or other means. The flow of the gas is generally represented by arrows 476.<br>
The flow rate of the gas or other fluid provided down substantially vertical well bore 412 may be varied in order to change the bottom hole pressure of articulated well bore 430. Furthermore, the composition of gas or other fluid provided down substantially vertical well bore 412 may also be changed to change the bottom hole pressure. By changing the bottom hole pressure of articulated well bore 430, a desired drilling condition such as under-balanced, balanced or over¬balanced may be achieved.<br>
The drilling fluid pumped through articulated drill string 440 mixes with  the gas or other fluid provided down substantially vertical well bore 412 outside of tubing 480 to form a fluid mixture. The fluid mixture enters an open end 482 of tubing 480 and flows up substantially vertical well bore 412 through tubing 480. Such flow of the fluid mixture is generally represented by arrows 474.   The fluid mixture may also comprise<br>
13<br><br><br>
cuttings from the drilling of subterranean zone 415 and fluid from subterranean zone 415, such as water or methane gas. Fluid pumped through articulated well bore 430 outside of articulated drill string 440 may also mix with the gas to. form the fluid mixture flowing up substantially vertical well bore 412 outside of tubing 480.<br>
FIGURE 3 illustrates the circulation of fluid in a well system 110 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. System 110 includes a substantially vertical well bore 112 and an articulated well bore 130. Articulated well bore 130 intersects substantially vertical well bore 112 at an enlarged cavity 120. Articulated well bore 130 includes a substantially vertical portion 132, a curved portion 136 and a substantially horizontal portion 134. Articulated well bore ijitersects an enlarged cavity 120 of substantially vertical well bore 112. Substantially horizontal portion 134 of articulated well bore 130 is drilled through subterranean zone 115. Articulated well bore 130 is drilled using an articulated drill string 140 which includes a down-hole motor and a drill bit 142. A drainage bore 150 is drilled using articulated drill string 140.<br>
Substantially vertical well bore 112 includes a pump string 180 which comprises a pump inlet 182 located at enlarged cavity 120. A drilling fluid is pumped through articulated drill string 140 as described above with respect to FIGURE 1. The general flow of such drilling fluid is illustrated by arrows 160. The drilling fluid may mix with fluid and/or cuttings from subterranean zone 150 to form a fluid mixture after the drilling fluid exits articulated drill string 140.<br>
14<br><br><br><br>
The fluid mixture is pumped up through substantially vertical well bore 112 through pump inlet 182 and pump string 180 using pump 165, as generally illustrated by arrows 172. Formation gas 171. from subterranean zone 115 flows up substantially vertical well bore 112 to areas of lower pressure, bypassing pump inlet 182. Thus, particular embodiments of the present invention provide a manner for pumping fluid out of a dual well system through a pump string and limiting the amount of formation gas pumped through the pump string. Formation gas 171 may be flared as illustrated or recovered.<br>
The speed of the pumping of the fluid mixture up substantially vertical well bore 112 through pump string 180 may be varied to change the fluid level and bottom hole pressure of system 110. By changing the fluid level and bottom hole pressure, a desired drilling condition such as under-balanced, balanced or over-balanced may be achieved. Substantially vertical well bore 112 includes a pressure sensor 168 operable to detect a pressure in substantially vertical well bore 112. Pressure sensor 168 may be electrically coupled to an engine 167 of pump 165 to automatically change the speed of pump 165 based on the pressure at a certain location in system 110. In other embodiments, the speed of pump 165 may be varied manually to achieve a desired drilling condition.<br>
While connections are being made to articulated drill string 140, during tripping of the drill string or in other cases when desirable, drilling fluid may be pumped through articulated well bore 130 outside of articulated drill string 140. Such drilling fluid may mix with fluid and/or cuttings from subterranean zone 150 to form the fluid mixture pumped up substantially vertical well bore 112 through pump string 180.<br>
15<br><br><br>
FIGURE 4 is a flowchart illustrating an example method for circulating fluid in a well system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The method begins at step 200 where a substantially vertical well bore is drilled from a surface to a subterranean zone. In particular embodiments, the subterranean zone may comprise a coal seam or a hydrocarbon reservoir. At step 2 02 an articulated well bore is drilled from the surface to the subterranean zone. The articulated well bore is drilled using a drill string. The articulated well bore is horizontally offset from the substantially vertical well bore at the surface and intersects the substantially vertical well bore it a junction proximate the subterranean zone. The junction may be at an enlarged cavity.<br>
Step 204 includes drilling a drainage bore from the junction into the subterranean zone. At step 206, a drilling fluid is pumped through the drill string when the drainage bore is being drilled. The drilling fluid may exit the drill string proximate a drill bit of the drill string.<br>
At step 2 08, gas, such as compressed air, is provided down the substantially vertical well bore through a tubing. In other embodiments, other fluids may be provided down the substantially vertical well bore through the tubing. The tubing includes an opening at the junction such that the gas exits the tubing at the junction. In particular embodiments, the gas mixes with the drilling fluid to form a fluid mixture that returns up the substantially vertical well bore outside of the tubing. The fluid mixture may also include fluid, and/or cuttings from the subterranean zone. The flow rate or composition of the gas or other fluid provided down the<br>
16<br><br><br>
substantially vertical well bore may be varied to control a bottom hole pressure of the system to achieve a desired drilling condition, such as an over-balanced, under-balanced or balanced drilling condition.<br>
FIGURE 5 is a 'flowchart illustrating an example method for circulating fluid in a well system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The method begins at step 300 where a substantially vertical well bore is drilled from a surface to a suDterranean zone. In particular embodiments, the subterranean zone may comprise a coal seam or a hydrocarbon reservoir. At step 302 an articulated well bore is drilled from the surface to the subterranean zone. The articulated well bore is drilled using a drill string. The articulated well bore is horizontally offset from the substantially vertical well bore at the surface and intersects the substantially vertical well bore at a junction proximate the subterranean zone. The junction may be at an enlarged cavity.<br>
Step 304 includes drilling a drainage bore from the junction into the subterranean zone. At step 3 06, a drilling fluid is pumped through the drill string when the drainage bore is being drilled. The drilling fluid may exit the drill string proximate a drill bit of the drill string. At step 308, a pump string is provided down substantially vertical well bore.
