				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the filed of facsimile devices. Further, this invention relates to internet aware facsimile devices and PSTN devices. More particularly, this invention relates to a method for notification of arrival of fax documents.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
In the present facsimile devices, there is no mechanism built in the facsimile devices to indicate the arrival of faxes.<br>
In such circumstances, the user needs to keep waiting for the fax documents near the facsimile devices. The sender will have to intimate the receiver that the facsimile has been sent and only the delivery report is generated at the sender's end to indicate to the sender the status of the fax delivery.<br>
Further, if the user selects the option to receive the notification using the Group notification then it is not secure. Also, maintenance of the user database is huge, which can be substituted by adding more memory on the System.<br>
US patent no. 6,233,317 describes a multiple language electronic mail notification of received voice and/or fax messages. In this invention, when a subscriber of a messaging system receives a voice and/or fax message, an electronic mail message notifying the subscriber of the received message is composed in a language selected by the subscriber, and then sent to the subscriber's electronic mail address. A subscriber to the system can select one of a plurality of different languages in which the subscriber wishes to receive such e-mail notifications. The electronic mail address and an indication of the subscriber's selected language are contained in a subscriber database. Each subscriber can select a different one of the available languages. Such a capability is advantageous in a multiple language environment, and overcomes the problem associated with systems that are capable of generating such messages in only one language. In this a messaging system incorporating the multiple language e-mail notification features of the present invention comprises a voice and/or fax messaging apparatus, the aforementioned database, means for composing an electronic mail message in any one of a plurality of different languages selected by the subscriber, and a server for sending the electronic mail message to the subscriber's electronic mail address. The means for composing an electronic mail message in a subscriber selected language comprises an array having a plurality of columns, wherein each column of the array contains the words of a different one of the plurality of languages from which electronic mail messages can be constructed. The means for composing further comprises program code that selects the array column corresponding to the subscriber selected language, and then composes the electronic mail message from the words in that selected column. In that invention preferably, the array is generated from a flat file containing all of the words for each of the different languages.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the present invention is to invent a method for notification of arrival of fax documents.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to keep the centralized data for fax documents received whereby a report of statistics such as number of fax documents received, no. of pages, resolution, etc. can be generated.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to inform/notify the user about the arrival fax document so that the user can collect the documents immediately as result of which the documents are more secure and the user will be informed that he has received a fax document.<br>
Using the present method, the user will be notified on reception of facsimile document and also the user will be able to configure the Fax Machines as to the <br>
type of notification method he would like to use. Some of the notification methods considered in this invention are: e-mail notification, PC-alert messages, and news messages to the centralized servers, SMS or through pagers.<br>
The above invention can be achieved using different mechanisms which are explained in the following sections. The present invention also provides the facility to the sender to select for the notification method. This system provides a system for communicating or interacting with the user.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention explains a method for notification of arrival of fax documents comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	configuring the notification;<br>
(b)	initiating the notification to the receiver;<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a typical communication scenario between IAF and other devices.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the<br>
disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art on how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Structure of the System<br>
The present systems will have following new features:<br>
1.	Addition of the SMS System to the MFP devices for notification: In this art we will be adding the SMS delivery system which will deliver the SMS data from IP network to the Mobile or Wireless networks.<br>
2.	The Notification Mechanisms are added to the Fax over IP also for T.37 and T.38; please refer to the Method #1, 2 and 3 for more details of these mechanisms.<br>
3.	The selection of notification using the Web Ul and using the User Interface on the MFP is also provided.<br>
Operation of the Invention<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a typical communication scenario between IAF and other devices.<br>
The following are the different steps involved in the operation of the invention: 1. Receiver will configure the notification method and the notification information. Following are the different methods of notification: Notifying by sending the e-mails Notifying by sending the SMS Notifying by sending the alert messages on PC<br>
Notifying by sending the pager.<br>
Notifying the group about the fax arrivals<br>
1.	The receiver will select any one of the above methods for his notification. If he selects e-mail notification, then he will configure his e-mail ID with the fax device, if SMS then the mobile number will be configured, etc.<br>
2.	Whenever the fax documents are received by the receiving fax device it identifies whether the fax has received successfully or not.<br>
3.	The notification can also be if there are any errors or on successful reception of the fax documents.<br>
4.	The user can configure whether he needs the notification for error case or success cases, depending on this the fax machine will send the notification to the user.<br>
5.	The system administrator can also configure the fax device such that the device sends the information related to the fax documents arrived.<br>
a.	The following information can be sent to the centralized servers, like From address (can be telephone number or IP address or Gateway IP address etc,)<br>
b.	Number of pages received<br>
c.	Resolution, color, text or images, etc. (the more information will be added)<br>
6.	System administrator can also configure the set of users or a group (a set of fax device users). If fax device is not able to identify that the fax document belongs to which received then the notification will be sent to the configured group. Here the configured group can be news groups, email group ID'S or SMS group ID. In this case it will send the sender information also so that the particular user who is waiting for the fax message can go &amp; pick the fax document. <br>
The following section explains the different methods initiating the notification to the<br>
receiver.<br>
Method #1:<br>
Indication using Sub-Addressing<br>
1.	Whenever a facsimile message is sent using the Sub-Addressing mechanism [ITU-T defined T.38], then the Sub-address will be extracted from the receiver address.<br>
2.	Each of these Sub-Addresses is mapped to corresponding User Notification Information.<br>
3.	The User Notification Information will contain the following information:<br>
a.	Notification Method<br>
b.	Notify for [Success/Error/Failure]<br>
c.	Notification details [Like E-mail ID, IP-address of a PC for the Alert Messages, Mobile Phone Number, Pager Number, etc]<br>
4.	For example the Sub addresses 5550555+3000. Here 3000 is the Sub-address which is similar to the extension.<br>
Method #2:<br>
Indication using "Non-Standard Commands"<br>
1.	By using non-standard commands of T.30, the notification information will be sent from the sender.<br>
2.	The receiver will use the information sent by non-standard commands and will be notified the receiver upon receiving the facsimile document.<br>
3.	The disadvantage is only the similar facsimile vendor devices can understand the non-standard commands.<br>
4.	In this case also the notification method can be any of the notification methods mentioned in the above section.<br>
5.	Here the Sender Machine sends indication to the receiving fax machine that indicates the fax arrival to the user.<br>
Method #3:<br>
Indication using OIS/DCS commands<br>
1.	Using DIS/DCS command identifies or initiates the notification to the receiver, receiver information can also be sent using the extension bits in the DIS command. For ex:<br>
a.	Notification method is e-mail, then e-mail ID will be extracted from the receiver information.<br>
b.	If notification method is paging, then the pager number will be extracted from the receiver information.<br>
c.	Same for sending the SMS also<br>
2.	Otherwise the DIS/DCS commands can also contain the Extension or Sub-address of the particular user where in the detailed notifications are mapped.<br>
3.	The DIS/DCS commands can also contain the "User Name/Nick Name/Any String' (which identifies the receiver) which will be mapped to notification details.<br>
The present invention also provides for the following:<br>
1.	The System administrator can also configure the Fax Machine so that for each received fax message there will be an entry in the centralized servers.<br>
2.	The details of the information can be "receiver name", "no of received pages", "color or black &amp; white", "text or image" etc.<br>
3.	The above will helps in generating the different kinds of statistics.<br>
4.	The notification method can also be configured as a Group Notification. In this case all the users who are registered in that group receive the <br>
notification or alert messages.<br>
a. The message information can contain the "sender name/lp address/destination address", no. of pages, or subject information if any. So that if any of the user expecting any fax from that particular sender then that user will collect the fax documents from the Facsimile Devices.<br>
