				<td>THERMAL CAPSULOTOMY TOOL AND SYSTEM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to generally to the field of cataract surgery. More specifically, the present invention relates to a thermal tool and system for burning a relatively large round thermal capsulotomy tlirough a relatively small corneal incision. The system provides heat, and airflow, to the surgical site such that the capsulotomy can be performed with efficiency and ease.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
To date, over one million cataract surgeries are performed annually in the United States, in which the anterior lens capsule must be opened to gain access to the lens nucleus and allow removal of degenerated cortical material. It is necessary to create a relatively large circular opening in the lens capsule in order to enter the lens interior and to withdraw matter from inside. Fojination of this opening is known as a capsulotomy. It is important that the opening has smooth edges and is tear resistant so that the lens contents can be easily removed through the opening. The lens opening is usually on the order of 5-7 millimeters in diameter, though tliis may vary.<br>
Currently, two techniques for anterior capsulotomy are widely used; the "can-opener" technique and capsulorrhexis. In can-opener capsulotomy, a small incision in the sclera or peripheral cornea is performed, then a cystotome, knife, or needle is inserted through the incision and small connecting tears are made in the anterior lens capsule in a circular pattern. After a complete circle has been made by connecting the tears, a circular piece of the anterior capsule is grasped with forceps and torn away along the perforations. Unfortunately, when opening the capsule with numerous small capsular tears, the small tags that remain become a focal area of least resistance and can lead to tears, which extend radially and posteriorly to the posterior capsule. The detrimental result is a loss of structural stability of the capsule and an increased likelihood of vitreous entry into the anterior chamber.<br>
Capsulorrhexis denotes a circular central opening in the anterior capsule. This continuous opening eliminates the residual tags common with the can-opener technique described above. In capsulorrhexis, a capsular incision is made with a cystotome, and this incision is coaxed to form a circular shape by pushing the leading edge of the freshly tearing capsule with the cystotome in a non-cutting fashion or by graspmg the leading edge with forceps. This procedure is challenging for the surgeon to control. The tearing motion can lead to an undesirable tear toward the equator<br>
 <br>
and tiie posterior capsule, and the size of the opening is difficult to dictate. Capsulorrhexis<br>
4<br>
requires a significant amount of skill and experience and to consistently obtain successful results.<br>
Opening the anterior capsule via either of the described teclmiques of anterior capsulotomy is a delicate procedure and is widely considered to be one of the most difficult steps in cataract surgery. A poorly performed anterior capsulotomy significantly hinders the subsequent surgical steps and increases the probability of operative complications. Complications resulting from a poor capsulotomy include zonular stress with subsequent breakage of the posterior capsule, vitreous loss, and large capsular tags preventing efficient lens removal. A poor capsulotomy also prevents placement of an intraocular lens in the capsular bag due to ill-defined capsular structures. The operative time is lengthened and patient discomfort can be increased, along with the risk of postoperative complications and decreased visual acuity results.<br>
With either of the above-described techniques for anterior capsulotomy, the size or position of the capsular opening is ofl:en not ideal. The location, size, and configuration of the incision have important consequences. For example, an overly small capsular opening can impair the safe removal of the lens nucleus and cortex and prevent proper intraocular lens insertion into the lens capsule. In addition, a small or eccentric capsular opening places excessive stress on the lens capsule during surgery, placing the eye at risk for zonular and capsular breakage.<br>
Certdn devices have been proposed to overcome the problems associated with conventional anterior capsulotomy techniques. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,766,897 issued to Smirmaul, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,269,787 and 5,873,883 issued to Cozean Jr. et al. each disclose instruments that include circular cutting members for incising the anterior capsule. However, use of such devices in small incision cataract surgery is limited due to their size. Specifically, the anterior lens capsule of the eye is shielded by the cornea and sclera, such that a passage wound must be cut in the corneal or scleral tissue before any surgical apparatus can reach the anterior capsule. It is desirable to limit the width of the passage wound incised on the corneal tissue, preferably to 1-3 millimeters. A small wound decreases the scope of the surgical closing procedures, promotes rapid healing, minimizes astigmatism, reduces potential infections, and offers rapid visual rehabilitation. Therefore, the instrumentation employed in cataract surgery should be capable of passing through a small wound. Prior art cutting members cannot be passed through a small corneal incision of 1-3 mm.<br>
Burning tools exist in which heat is concentrated at the tip, and the tip is made to contact and burn a surgical site. In use of such burning tools for cataract surgery, an incision is made in the cornea, and the tip of tool is inserted through the incision and brought into contact with the<br>
 <br>
capsule, where it is activated to sear through the capsule. The use of prior art burning tools is restricted by the small size of the incision, as previously mentioned, which hampers introduction of a large tip having a circular shape of the appropriate size of the desired seared area.<br>
International application PCT/ELO5/000461 by the Applicants describes a burning ring present at an oblique angle on the end of a narrow-diameter shaft. The burning ring can therefore be introduced through a small incision, and the oblique angle grants a relatively large elliptical burn, with the largest axis of the bum being larger than the diameter of the shaft.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,066,138 to Sheffer et al. describes a searing cautery that is retractable from within a handle, so that the cautery can be extended to its final size after insertion through the corneal incision. The Sheffer patent suffers from the disadvantage that the burning ring does not close a complete circle, as apparent in Figure lb, with the area near the handle not being seared. Therefore, it is still necessary to grasp that remaining area with a forceps, and form a tear tliat is difficult to control. Additionally, since the searing ring is formed from a single metal wire extending substantially into the depths of the handle, when the wire is heated electrically, it is difficult to insulate the tool and prevent heating in unwanted areas. Searing could accidentally occur in other portions of the eye adjacent to the lens, since the handle of the tool could heat, and since the tool needs to be inserted considerably into the eye.<br>
Other burning tools exist which have a small diameter tip, which is inserted through the incision, and used to burn a series of holes in the capsule, arranged in a ring, which is then grasped with forceps and torn into a circular opening. It is difficult to manipulate the burning tool to form a series of burns that are reliably ring-shaped and are present at the desired location, and form a ring of the desired size. It would be desirable to have a burning tool, which could be inserted through a small diameter incision in the cornea, yet could easily be used to form a large diameter ring-shaped opening in the capsule.<br>
Thus, the need exists for a surgical tool capable of reliably performing a uniform circular-shaped opening in the capsule.<br>
Additionally, in cataract surgery, the procedure is usually complicated by the need for multiple instruments: a cutting tool, an air pressure inlet, a water pressure inlet, and related surgical and electrical equipment. It would be useful to simplify such surgical procedures by providing a combination tool that concentrates heat on the surgical site and which is constructed so as to be convenient to handle and which can be used for providing both regulated heating and airflow pressure directed to a surgical site.<br>
 <br>
Thus, there is a need for a tool for forming a capsulotomy opening of approximately 5-7 millimeters in the lens capsule, the opening being resistant to manipulation. The tool should be<br>
'	r<br>
able to pass through a relatively small corneal incision, i.e., on the order of 1-2 millimeters.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is a principal object of the present invention to provide a thermal system and tool for the performance of a capsulotomy that effects formation of an opening in the lens capsule through the use of a short pulse of electrical current. The heat generated from the current instantaneously burns an opening of a predetermined size in the lens capsule.<br>
Moreover, the system and tool of the present invention is adapted for maintaining a pressurized airflow to the surgical site so that additional airflow control devices are not required.<br>
Additionally, the system and tool of the present invention has an expandable-retractable burning element that enables approaching the lens through a small corneal incision (about 1.5 millimeters) while allowing for a capsulotomy having a diameter, for example, of about 5-7 millimeters.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a system for performing a capsulotomy procedure, comprising a capsulotomy tool comprising a main housing having a distal end and an extendable-retractable burning element coupled to the distal end of the main housing and a capsulotomy and movement control unit. The capsulotomy tool is in connection with the capsulotomy and movement control unit for providing electrical current and movement control to the burning element such that when the burning element is extended and heated, an opening is burned on the lens capsule.<br>
According to preferred embodiments of the present invention, the system also comprises a handle for connecting between the tool and the capsulotomy and control unit. The burning element for performance of the capsulotomy is retracted from the capsulotomy tool portion beyond the handle, and this tool portion is for disposable, one-time use.<br>
According to further preferred embodiments of the present invention, the system also includes an air pressure unit and airflow means coupled to the air pressure unit for directing pressurized air to the surgical site.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The present invention discloses a capsulotomy tool, which has a retractable cautery ring, also known as a burning element. The burning element is initially hidden within a sleeve. After the tool is inserted past the capsular incision, the burning element is progressively extended from witliin the sleeve by sliding outwards several concentrically arranged tubes with which the element is associated. Finally, the burning element is fully opened to expand into a complete circular or complete oval shaped cautery, which is then heated to sear the lens. The complete circular or oval-shaped searing thus eliminates the need for tearing by forceps, which is potentially dangerous and difficult to perform.<br>
In the invention, heating is limited to the burning element, so there is no danger of searing inappropriate areas of the eye. The retractable nature of the burning element allows it to be introduced through a small capsular incision, yet provides burning on the lens at a diameter larger than that of the small capsular incision. The tool additionally provides pressurized airflow through its hollow center, alleviating the need for a separate airflow tool.<br>
Figs. 1-6 show a preferred embodiment for a capsulotomy tool 10, constructed and operated in accordance with the principles of the present invention.<br>
 <br>
Referring to Fig. 1, capsulotomy tool 10 includes a main housing 12 having a distal end 14 and a proximal end 16. Main housing 12 includes a connector 40 at proximal end 16 for ♦acilitating connection of main housing 12 to a handle wMch is operably connected to a capsulotomy and movement control unit and to an air pressure unit for providing electrical current and pressurized air, respectively, to capsulotomy tool 10. This will be described further herein with respect to Figs. 7a-b.<br>
Capsulotomy tool 10 includes a sleeve 52 that extends from distal end 14 of main housing 12. Initially, sleeve 52 is disposed over surgical elements of capsulotomy tool 10, to be described further herein. Sleeve 52 is formed from a non-conductive material, such as plastic or Teflon, and has smooth sides such that entry into the eye can be achieved with minimal friction. The end of sleeve 52 is tapered around the edges. This serves to ease of entry into the eye after an incision has been made. Sleeve 52 also provides a seal against the corneal incision afler the eye has been entered.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2 and best shown in Figs. 3a-b, capsulotomy tool 10 includes an outer tube 18 having a distal end 44. End 44 comprises a tip 46 and an outer tube extension 48 having a truncated circumference that extends between the completely tubular region (region not having a truncated circumference) of outer tube 18 and tip 46. The region where outer tube 18 changes from a completely tubular construction to extension 48 has a beveled edge 50, which provides extra structural support for outer tube extension 48, so that extension 48 can be made as thin as possible. Beveled edge 50 may be beveled to any suitable angle, for providing maximal support to extension 48.<br>
Capsulotomy tool 10 also includes an inner tube 20 that passes through the central axis of main housing 12, and that extends from distal end 14 of main housing 12 and through outer tube 18, The hollow center of inner tube 20 defines an air channel 24 (see Fig. 2) for directing pressurized airflow to the surgical site. Air channel 24 is operably coupled to the air pressure unit (described below in Fig. 7b) for receiving pressurized air. It will be appreciated that by providing airflow, the surgical site remains dry while the capsulotomy is performed. Pressurized airflow also serves to keep the anterior chamber of the eye open and expanded while the lens capsule is being opened.<br>
Referring Fig. 2, both imier tube 20 and outer tube 18 are coupled to a spring mechanism 54 located in main housing 12, for enabling combined movement of inner tube 20 and outer tube 18 out of sleeve 52, as well as for enabling movement of inner tube 20 within outer tube 18. This will be described further herein. It will be noted that as shown in Fig. 2, inner tube 20 is positioned inside of outer tube 18.<br>
 <br>
According to a preferred embodiment, all elements shown in Fig. 2 are disposable, and are intended for a single use. This includes housing 12, spring mechanism 54, inner tube 20, outer tube 18, sleeve 52, as well as burning element 30 (to be described hereinbelow).<br>
Referring to Figs. 3a and 3b, an e&gt;ctendable-retractable burning element 30 is connected to the end of inner tube 20. Fig. 3a illustrates the burning element 30 in its retracted state, within tile sleeve 52. Fig. 3b illustrates the burning element 30 after it has been extended out of the sleeve 52.<br>
Burning element 30 includes a first band 34 and a second band 36, which are formed from electrically conductive material such as, though not limited to, a tungsten alloy. The opposite ends of each band 34, 36 are vertically coimected between the end of inner tube 20 and tip 46 of outer tube 18. Movement of inner tube 20 in the direction of tip 46 of outer tube 18 causes first band 34 and second band 36 to adopt the extended and open configuration, in wliich bands 34, 36 substantially form a circle with one another, as shown in Fig. 6. A spring mechanism 54 is provided for enabling movement of inner tube 20 and of outer tube 18. It is appreciated that other mechanisms could be employed, as are well known in the art, for effecting outward movement of inner tube 20 and outer tube 18.<br>
Sleeve 52 covers outer tube 18 and inner tube 20 during passage of the tip of the capsulotomy tool 10 tlirough the corneal incision. By providing sleeve 52 as a cover for outer tube 18, as well as for inner tube 20 and burning element 30, the entry into the eye can be accomplished quickly and with minimal friction.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3b, once the anterior chaiuber has been reached, outer tube 18 and irmer tube 20 are advanced from the end of sleeve 52. When tip 46 is in proximity to the lens capsule, inner tube 20 is advanced so as to cause burning element 30 to be switched from the retracted configuration to the extended and opened configuration (see Figs. 4, 5, and 6). The burning element is then positioned on the capsule. A brief pulse of electricity sent through the tool then causes bands 34, 36 of burning element to heat up and burn an opening in the lens capsule.<br>
As mentioned previously, sleeve 52 also serves the purpose of providing a seal against the cornea once the end of capsulotomy tool 10 has been inserted into the eye. It will be noted that in Fig. 1, sleeve 52 conceals outer tube 18 and burning element 30 from view.<br>
In the retracted configuration, bands 34, 36 of burning element 30 are positioned substantially flattened and parallel to one another, directly above extension 48 of outer tube 18. In Figs. 1, 2, 3a and 3b, burning element 30 is in the retracted configuration (in Fig. 1, the burning element is not visible). In Figs, 1, 2, and 3a burning element 30 is located inside of<br>
 <br>
sleeve 52. In this position, the end of capsulotomy tool 10 can be inserted into a relatively small corneal incision, on the order of 1-2 millimeters.<br>
In Fig. 3b, burning element 30 has been partially advanced out of sleeve 52, though it is still in the retracted configuration. Movement of burning element 30 out of sleeve 52 is accomplished by moving outer tube 18 and inner tube 20 such that extension 48 and burning element 30 become exposed from the end of sleeve 52 Thereafter, inner tube 20 is moved towards tip 46 of outer tube IS, while outer tube 18 remains stationary, thereby causing each of bands 34, 36 to assume an arched, semi-circular configuration.<br>
Referring to Figs. 4-6, the extended and opened configuration is shown, though in Fig. 5, bands 34, 36 have been only partially opened.<br>
The height of bands 34, 36 is about 200 microns higher than that of inner tube 20 and tip 46, so that when the edges of bands 34, 36 contact the capsule, no other elements of capsulotomy tool 10 will contact it. Inner tube 20 is provided with a slot 60 formed in the upper edge at the end thereof for accommodating the additional height of bands 34, 36.<br>
Referring to Figs. 5 and 6, the length of first and second bands 34, 36 is designed according to the size of the capsulotomy that is required. For example, for a capsulotomy of 4-5 millimeters, a band length of about 7 millimeters is required. The band length is approximately half the circumference of the required capsulotomy. Extension 48 of outer tube 18 must also be of sufficient length so as to accommodate bands 34, 36 when they are in the flattened, retracted configuration. The angle of beveled edge 50 can be made larger or smaller depending on the length of extension 48.<br>
Optionally, before use the burning element 30 is removed from the tool 10, so that the size of the burning element can be selected in order to choose the size of the capsulotomy. Preferably, several removable burning elements can be designed having longer or shorter bands, m order perform a capsulotomy having a diameter selected from most preferred diameters 4, 5, 6 or 7 mm. Removable burning elements of other sizes can also be envisioned.<br>
First and second bands 34, 36 are formed from electrically conductive material such as a tungsten alloy or any other suitable element. Inner tube 20 and outer tube 18, are both formed, at least partially, from electrically-conductive material. Extension 48 and tip 46 of outer tube 18, are likewise formed from the same material. Inner tube 20 and outer tube 18 define opposite poles of an electrical circuit, and they are designed so as to be electrically insulated from one another.<br>
To perform a capsulotomy, a brief, low-voltage electrical pulse is passed through bands 34, 36. When a current is passed through inner tube 20, bands 34, 36, tip 46, extension 48, and<br>
 <br>
returning through outer tube 18, bands 34, 36 will heat up (or vice versa depending on the<br>
4<br>
polarity).<br>
It will be appreciated that a switch is provided such that the electrical circuit can be completed only when burning element 30 is in the extended configuration, so as to prevent premature heating of burning element 30.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 7a and 7b, and to a system for the performance of a capsulotomy employing the capsulotomy tool described above.<br>
Capsulotomy tool 10 is coupled to a handle 72 which facilitates maneuvering of tool 10 by the surgeon. Handle 72 houses a motor (not shown) that is connected to spring mechanism (54, see Fig. 2) of main housing 12 for enabling reversible movement of the outer tube 18, the inner tube 20, and the extending and retracting of the burning element 30.<br>
Handle 72 is coupled to an air pressure unit 74 via an air tube 76 having a connector 96 at the end thereof, for supplying pressurized air to the surgical site during performance of the capsulotomy. Air pressure unit 74 preferably includes a control 78 and a display 80 for determining the amount of pressurized air delivered to the air channel of capsulotomy tool 10.<br>
Handle 72 is further coupled to a capsulotomy and movement control unit 82 via a power cable 84 having a connector 94 at the end thereof, for supplying electrical current and movement control to capsulotomy tool 10. Capsulotomy and movement control unit 82 also includes a control 86 as well as a display 88 for determining the amount of electrical current applied through power cable 84 to capsulotomy tool 10. Power cable 84 is connected to the motor inside of the handle 72 for facilitating movement of the outer tube 18 and inner tube 20 of capsulotomy tool 10.<br>
A foot-pedal control switch 90 is also connected to capsulotomy and movement control unit 82 via a cord 92. Foot-pedal control switch 90 enables the surgeon to control the movement of the inner and outer tube 20, 18 and the extending and the retracting of the burning element 30, as well as applying of electrical current, with his foot.<br>
Operation of capsulotomy tool 10 will now be described, when used for creation of a seared capsulotomy opening during cataract surgery.<br>
In Figs. 8-13, illustrations are schematic and relative sizes are not necessarily accurate. In reality, the capsulotomy opening encompasses approximately half to two thirds of the area of the lens, with the capsulotomy opening usually being within the range of 4-7mm.<br>
Referring to Figs. 8a and 8b, the surgeon first makes a small incision in the cornea 100 of the eye 102, preferably on the order of 1-2 millimeters diameter, using a standard scalpel 104.<br>
 <br>
, Referring to Figs. 9a and 9b, following formation of an incision in the cornea 100, the end of capsulotomy tool 10 is inserted tlirough the incision, with capsulotomy tool 10 in the configuration shown in Fig. 1, with inner tube 20, outer tube 18 and burning element 30 disposed inside of sleeve 52. A burst of pressurized air is delivered to the cornea 100, through air channel 24 present at the hollow center of imier tube 20 (shown in Fig. 2). The pressurized air assists in retaining the shape of the cornea 100, and moves fluids to behind the lens 106, allowing fiirther steps of the procedure to be performed on a relatively dry lens 106.<br>
Referring to Fig. 10, after the eye is entered, the surgeon uses foot-pedal control switch 90 to advance outer tube 18, inner tube 20 (disposed inside of outer tube 18), and burning element 30, to extend and protrude from the end of sleeve 52 (Fig. 3b).<br>
Referring to Fig. 11, burning element 30 has been exposed, and inner tube 20 is advanced via foot-pedal control switch 90 such that bands 34, 36 of burning element 30 are pushed towards tip 46 of outer tube 18 while outer tube 18 remains stationary. This causes bands 34, 36 of burning element 30 to switch from a substantially flattened configuration (shown in Fig. 10), to semi-circular configuration (shown in Fig. 11) wherein bands 34, 36 of burning element 30 substantially form a circle with one another (also shown in Fig. 6).<br>
With burning element 30 thus extended and circular, the surgeon lowers tool 10 such that the lens capsule 106 is contacted by bands 34, 36 of burning element 30.<br>
A low-voltage electrical pulse is then applied using foot-pedal control switch 90, and bands 34, 36 heat up such that a capsulotomy opening is burned in the lens capsule 106 where bands 34, 36 are positioned.<br>
Referring to Fig. 12, bands 34, 36 are then returned to the retracted configuration via backwards movement of inner tube 20. The capsulotomy opening 108 seared using the invention is apparent in the center of Fig. 12. Closing of bands 34, 36 causes any excess capsular and cortical lens material seared from the area of the capsulotomy 108 to be retained within bands 34, 36, allowing removal of this excess material.<br>
Referring to Fig. 13, all internal elements of the tool 10, including burning ring 30 and inner and outer tubes 20, 18, have been retracted to within the sleeve 52, in preparation for removal of the tool 10 from the eye 102. Apparent at the center of Fig. 13 is the final capsulotomy opening 108 formed using the capsulotomy tool and system of the invention. The tool 10 is then removed flrom the eye 102, and the remainder of the cataract surgery can be performed via the capsulotomy opening 108 seared.<br>
 <br>
, The system and tool provide an effective and reproducible capsular opening in the lens and allows further steps of cataract surgery, such as phacoemulsification or an equivalent procedure, and removal of cataract material.<br>
Thus, the tool of the present invention provides a very significant advantage when compared with capsulotomy tools of the prior art. The extendable-retractable burning element allows for performance of a capsulotomy in a quick and efficient manner, leaving a capsular opening that is clean and tear resistant. Moreover, the extendable-retractable burning element allows for entry into the eye via a corneal incision on the order of 1-2 millimeters, while allowing for a large capsulotomy, for example, 5-7 millimeters. Using the capsulotomy tool of the present invention, the surgical procedure is simplified, since the surgeon does not need to use a separate device for providing pressurized air to the surgical site.<br>
Using the present invention, a complete circle or a complete oval-shaped searing takes place, so that there is no need for tearing of the lens using forceps, which would be difficult to perform and to control.<br>
Having described the invention with regard to certain specific embodiments thereof, it is to be understood that the description is not meant as a limitation, as further modifications will now become apparent to those skilled in the art, and it is intended to cover such modifications as fall within the scope of the appended claims.<br>
