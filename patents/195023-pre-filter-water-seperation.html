Generally in a diesel engine the function of the components of fuel injection system heavily depends on the quality of the luel flowing through the components. It is always preferable and recommended that the fuel be free of water components and dust free to avoid ineffcient combustion, poor startup and to increase the life of the components. The fuel delivered from the fuel supplied pump is past through the fuel filter system which has a water filtration unit and also a separate dust removal filter. The impuirity collected therein is disposed off and the clean fuel is moving on. The prior art does not allow the removal of filter element very easily when there is a need to replace the element due to the accumulation of dust on the filter element. The prior art has two basic disadvantage which is in the sense having two separate filter division and further filter element not been easily replaceable.<br>
The known fuel filter has a cylindrical outer container in which «li annular or cylindrical filter element is disposed coaxially. The unfiltered fuel enters the top portion of the container through an upper plate having a<br><br>
number of holes. The fuel then flows radially inward through the filter element to the middle of the filter where there is a threaded filter outlet concentric with the longltudinal axis of the filter.<br>
Alternatively the filter inlet and outlet may be reversed such that the flow is radially outward through the filter element which however is beyond the scope of this invention. Pew examples are given below:-<br>
In either event, water droplets fall to the bottom of the filter container where they are collected in a bowl removably connected there to by threads.<br>
