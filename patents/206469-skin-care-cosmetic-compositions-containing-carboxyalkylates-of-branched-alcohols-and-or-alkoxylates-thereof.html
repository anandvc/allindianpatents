SKIN CARE COSMETIC COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING<br>
CARBOXYALKYLATES OF BRANCHED ALCOHOLS<br>
AND/OR ALKOXYLATES THEREOF<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
WO 2004/006883	PCT/EP2003/007649<br>
SKIN CARE COSMETIC COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING<br>
CARB0XYALKYLATES OF BRANCHED ALCOHOLS<br>
AND/OR ALK0XYLATE3 THEREOF<br>
5<br>
Cosmetic methods and compositions for conditioning human skin by topical application to the skin of cosmetic compositions which contain carboxyalkylates of branched alcohols, and/or alkoxylates thereof alone or in combination with astringent 10 salts.<br>
Sebum is skin oil which is produced by sebocytes (cells of the sebaceous glands in the skin) and is then secreted to the skin surface. A frequent and undesirable skin condition is "oily<br>
15 skin," the condition which results from the excessive amount of sebum on the skin. Oily skin is associated with a shiny, undesirable appearance and a disagreeable tactile sensation. This condition affects various age groups. Therefore, cosmetic products which provide both sebum control and anti-aging<br>
20 benefits are highly desirable.<br>
In hot and humid climates, facial sweat derived from eccrine glands can interact with sebum to amplify the perception of oily/greasy skin. Even in individuals with low-normal levels 25 of sebum, sweat can interact with surface sebum to make an individual perceive their skin to be more oily. Therefore, cosmetic products which provide both sebum control and anti-perspirant benefits are highly desirable.<br>
30 The prior art discloses branched alcohols as compounds which provide skin benefits such as sebum suppression.  For example, Burger et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,756,109 relates to the use of a<br><br>
WO 2004/006883<br><br>
PCT/EP2003/007649<br><br>
-   2   -<br>
noncyclic polyunsaturated diterpene alcohol, geranyl geraniol, in combination with a retinol as a skin conditioning composition. This patent discloses sebum suppression as one advantage of the branched alcohol in combination withretinol. 5 Hata et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,344,850 discloses topical<br>
cotttpoaitions containing a q.8 saturated or unsaturated alcohol<br>
with four methyl branches for treating or preventing acne.<br>
Derivatives of linear and branched alcohols have also been 10 disclosed in the prior art for a variety of uses, ranging from industrial to personal cleansing.  For example, Lynch, U.S. Patent No. 5,328,953 relates to rubber compositions including alkoxyalkanoic acid and processes for making same; Medyna et al., "Cyanoethylation of Alcohols, Sintez PAV (Moscow, USSR 15 1989) relates to cyanoethylation of alcohols with acrylonitrile. Abe et al., "Antibacterial and Fungicidal Activities of Heavy Metal Salts of Some Beta-alkyloxypropionic Acids,"A lecture delivered at the Vlllth I.S.F. Congress (Budapest 1966) relates to the growth inhibiting powers of the cupric, mercuric and 20 silver salts of certain beta-alkoxy propionic acids.<br>
WO 9918928, assigned to The Proctor &amp; Gamble Company, discloses pereanal clea.nsing compositione comprising btanched  surfactant systems having a hydrophobic group and a hydrophilic group. The 25 hydrophobic group comprises mid-chain branched and linear<br>
surfactant compounds.  The hydrophilic group is selected from the group consisting of sulfate and/or ethoxylates thereof.<br>
Springman, U.S. Patent No. 3,992,443 discloses a process for the 30 carboxymethylation of alcohols or ether alcohols in a single<br><br>
WO 2004/006883	PCT/EP2003/007649<br>
-   3<br>
Stage, using both straight chain and branched alcohols as suitable starting alcohols.<br>
Cripe et al,, US Patent 6,020,303 discloses detergent surfactant 5 compositions derived from mid-chain branched primary alkyl hydrophobic groups and hydrophilic groups, specifically, alkyl sulfates for application in laundry and cleaning compositions. Birtwistle et al., US Patent No. 5,093,112 discloses topical cleansing (detergent) compositions containing an alcohol and an 10 alkyl or alkenyl phosphate salt.<br>
The applicants' co-pending U.S. patent application Serial No. 09/872,897, filed June 1, 2001, discloses cosmetic methods and compositions for conditioning human skin by topical<br>
15 application to the skin of cosmetic compositions containing carboxymethylates of branched alcohols, and/or ethoxylates thereof. While carboxymethyl iso-alcohols are effective oil control agents, a need still exists for even more effective agents, allowing the use of smaller amounts in the<br>
20 composition, and resulting in overall cost efficiency. A need still exists to minimize an unpleasant odour, characteristic of vinyl or a "new car smell," sometimes associated with carboxymethylates of branched alcohols, thereby making application in cosmetic skin conditioning compositions more<br>
25 suitable. Moreover, a need still exists for an agent with better colour which, again, is more suitable for cosmetic applications.<br>
The prior art cited above does not seem to suggest or disclose 30 cosmetic compositions or methods for skin conditioning which avoid the shortcomings of branched alcohols and<br><br>
WO 2004/006883	PCT/EP2003/007649<br>
carboxymethylates thereof. Therefore, a need remains for novel compounds and cosmetic compositions that retain or enhance the beneficial effects of branched alcohols and carboxymethylates thereof in relation to sebum suppression and skin conditioning, 5 while avoiding the unpleasant odour and water-insolubility associated with such alcohols.<br>
Not suggested or disclosed are cosmetic compositions or methods for skin conditioning which further improve the effects and 10 perceived effects of branched alcohols and carboxyalkylates of branched alcohols.<br>
Cosmetic make-up compositions containing antiperspirants to improve the staying power of the colour are disclosed in<br>
15 L'Oreal's Bazin et al., U.S. Patent No. 6,251,412. Use of antiperspirant active ingredients for the manufacture of preparations for removal of sebum from the skin, in particular for the removal and clearing of comedones, for avoiding comedone formation, for the prophylaxis and treatment of mild forms of<br>
20 acne, and for the prophylaxis and control of seborrhea, is<br>
disclosed in Herpens et al., U.S. Published Patent Application 2002/0119109.<br>
A  combination of astringent salts and carboxyalkylates of 25 branched alcohols has not been previously used for improving skin feel through a combined synergistic effect of sebum suppression and sweat suppression.  Therefore, a need remains for novel cosmetic compositions that retain or enhance the beneficial effects of carboxyalkylates of branched alcohols in 30 relation to sebum suppression and skin conditioning, while<br><br>

The branched alkyl chain of the present invention is preferably derived from a branched alcohol having 7 to 15 carbon atoms, more preferably at least 9 carbon atoms and at 5  least two branches, as noted above.  The preferred alcohols from which the inventive compositions are derived contain a total of at least 10 carbon atoms in order to obtain maximum efficacy, with 13 carbon atoms most preferred. The preferred alcohols from which the inventive compositions are derived,<br>
10  contain from 2 to 5 branches, more preferably 3 to 4 branches, in order to maximize efficacy at minimum cost. The branches may be methyl branches, ethyl branches, or propyl branches. Preferably, the branches are methyl branches or ethyl branches, most preferably methyl branches, due to reduced<br>
15  odour and enhanced efficacy.<br>
The alcohol may be a mixture of various chain length alcohols. Such mixtures are suitable in deriving the inventive compositions, as long as the predominant alcohol (at least 20  about 70%) in the mix contains a total of at least 7,<br>
preferably at least 9, optimally 13, carbon atoms and at least two branches.<br>
Examples of preferred compounds of formula A are 25  carboxyethylates of branched alcohols and/or ethoxylates thereof. The most preferred compounds of formula A are carboxyethyl tridecylisoalcohols (TDCE) and salts thereof.<br>
Carboxyethylates of branched alcohols may be synthesized by 30  the following process.<br><br>
WO 2004/006883	PCT/EP2003/007649<br>
11<br>
(branched alcohol)  (acrylonitrile) R OH  +  CH2= CHCN<br><br>
5<br><br>
(alkyl or alkenyl oxypropionitrile)(carboxyethyl iso-alcohol)<br>
10  Generally, carboxyethylation of the branched alcohol involves the addition of a carboxy-ethyl group to the branched alcohol. Compound of formula A, is derived from branched alcohols which are commercially available, e.g. from Exxon or Henkel.<br>
15  Step 1, etherification, involves first directly adding an<br>
acrylonitrile (available, for example, from Aldrich Chemicals) to the branched alcohol to form an alkyl or alkenyl ether nitrile, also referred to as alkyl or alkenyl oxypropionitrile.  The acrylonitrile may be used in a 1:1<br>
20  molar ratio to the branched alcohol, or in excess in order to drive the reaction forward and enhance yield.  In one preferred embodiment, the molar ratio of branched alcohol to acrylonitrile is 1:1.5.<br>
25  In the following step, Step 2, the alkyl or alkenyl ether<br>
nitrile is reacted with an aqueous solution of an acid, such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, at room/ambient temperature, over potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide catalyst, to yield carboxyethyl isoalcohol.<br>
30<br><br>
WO 2004/006883	PCT/EP2003/007649<br>
12<br>
The carboxyethyl isoalcohol may be further reacted with an alcohol or base, such as MeOH or NaOH, to form an R-O-M structure (A) as discussed above, such as wherein X is a methyl group or the cation sodium.<br>
The salt forms of compound A (where M is a cation in formula A) are preferred because they are water soluble for penetration through the skin.  Preferably, sodium salt is used because of commercial availability.<br>
10<br>
Tridecylcarboxyethylate, TDCE, is the most preferred carboxyalkylate of branched alcohol compound, due to water solubility and oil solubility properties which translate into effective skin activity and further to cost effectiveness due 15  to the ability to use a smaller amount of active to gain a given degree of benefit. Additionally, TDCE has more acceptable odour and colour characteristics than other similar molecules, particularly TDCM (tridecylcarboxymethylate).<br>
20  Compound A of the present invention retains or enhances the beneficial sebum suppression qualities of branched alcohols and methoxylates thereof, while eliminating the unpleasant odour and colour. Moreover, compound A is an anionic surfactant, thus providing a negative charge that aids in<br>
25  binding the surfactant onto the skin's surface. The water soluble characteristic effectuates delivery into the skin. Moreover, as compared to prior art surfactants such as sulfate groups on branched alcohols, the carboxyl group in compound A is a better metal chelator and milder to the skin due to its<br>
30  relatively low acidity (pKa of approximately 3). The carboxyl group has a lower molecular weight than a sulfate group, thus<br><br>
WO 2004/006883	PCT/EP2003/007649<br>
-   13   -<br>
lower amounts of the carboxyl group will yield more beneficial results than the sulfate group.<br>
Compounds of formula A are employed in the inventive methods 5  and compositions in amounts of about 0.001% to about 50%,<br>
preferably about 0.1% to about 20%, most preferably about 0.1% to about 10%.<br>
Compositions employing compounds of formula A may optionally,<br>
10  but preferably, include astringent salts.In the present invention, the inclusion of antiperspirant compounds, in particular astringent salts, in a topical skin cream having carboxyalkylates of branched alcohols and alkoxylates thereof, reduces the perception of oily/greasy skin in the<br>
15  dermal areas having eccrine glands, especially face, arms, and legs. Thus, the perception of oily/greasy skin, especially facial skin, can be indirectly controlled by reducing the amount of facial sweating and controlling sebum, i.e. through suppression of sweat and sebum secretion.<br>
20<br>
The astringent salts may be inorganic or organic salts of aluminum, zirconium, zinc and mixtures thereof.  Preferably, the astringent salts are employed herein in particulate form, i.e., hydrophilic porous particles, of less than about 100<br>
25  microns in size, preferably about 3 microns to about 10 microns in size.  Salts useful as astringents or as components of astringent aluminum complexes include aluminum hydroxide, aluminum halides, aluminum hydroxyhalides, zirconyl oxyhalides, zirconyl hydroxyhalides and mixtures of<br>
30  these salt materials.<br><br>
WO 2004/006883	PCT/EP2003/007649<br>
-   14<br>
Aluminum salts of this type include aluminum chloride and the aluminum hydroxyhalides having the general formula<br>
AI2(OH)xQy--XH20 where Q is chlorine, bromine or iodine, where x is 2 to 5, x+y=6 and x and y do not need' to be 5  integers; and where X is about 1 to 6.  For example,<br>
aluminum chlorohydrate, having the formula [Al2(OH)5C1]--<br>
XH2O, is preferred, due to its ready commercial availability and relatively low cost.<br>
10  Several types of complexes utilizing the above astringent<br>
salts are known in the antiperspirant art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,792,068 (Luedders et al.), discloses complexes of aluminum, zirconium and amino acids such as glycine. Complexes reported therein and similar structures are commonly<br>
15  known as ZAG.  The ZAG complexes ordinarily have an Al:Zr<br>
ratio of from about X.67 to 12.5 and a Metal;C1 ratio of from about 0.73 to 1.93. The preferred amino acid for preparing<br>
such ZAG-type complexes is glycine of the formula C2H(NH2)COOH.<br>
Spherical ZAG, with particle size 1 to 100 microns, is 20  especially preferred.<br>
More specifically, the following is a list of astringent salts which may be useful for the present invention and which have approved listings under the United States Food &amp; Drug<br>
25  Administration, Federal Register. They include aluminum chloride, aluminum chlorohydrate, aluminum chlorohydrex, aluminum chlorohydrex PEG, aluminum chlorohydrex PG, aluminum dichlorohydrate, aluminum dichlorohydrex PEG, aluminum dichlorohydrex PG, aluminum sesquichlorohydrate, aluminum<br>

Compounds of formula A employed in the inventive methods and compositions are liquid, and thus the invention is effective even in the absence of the carrier. However, the compositions according to the invention comprise a cosmetically acceptable 25  vehicle to act as a diluant, dispersant or carrier of compound A, so as to facilitate their distribution when the composition is applied to the skin.<br>
The vehicle may be aqueous, anhydrous or an emulsion. 30  Preferably, the compositions are aqueous or an emulsion,<br>
especially water-in-oil or oil-in-water emulsion.  Water when<br><br>
WO 2004/006883	PCT/EP2003/007649<br>
-   18<br>
present will be in amounts which may range from 5% to 99%, preferably from 40% to 90%, optimally between 60% and 90% by weight.<br>
5  Besides water, relatively volatile solvents may also serve as carriers within compositions of the present invention. Most<br>
preferred are monohydric q.-C3 alkanols.  These include ethyl<br>
alcohol, methyl alcohol and isopropyl alcohol. The amount of monohydric alkanol may range from 1% to 70%, preferably from 10  10% to 50%, optimally between 15% and 40% by weight.<br>
Emollient materials may also serve as cosmetically acceptable carriers. These may be in the form of silicone oils and synthetic esters. Amounts of the emollients may range 15  anywhere from 0.1% to 50%, preferably between 1% and 20% by weight.<br>
Silicone oils may be divided into the volatile and non¬volatile variety. The term "volatile" as used herein refers<br>
20  to those materials which have a measurable vapor pressure at ambient temperature. Volatile silicone oils are preferably chosen from cyclic or linear polydimethylsiloxanes containing from 3 to 9, preferably from 4 to 5, silicon atoms. Linear volatile silicone materials generally have viscosities less<br>
25  than about 5 centistokes at 250C while cyclic materials<br>
typically have viscosities of less than about 10 centistokes. Non-volatile silicone oils useful as an emollient material include polyalkyl siloxanes, polyalkylaryl siloxanes and polyether siloxane copolymers. The essentially non-volatile<br>
30  polyalkyl siloxanes useful herein include, for example,<br>
polydimethyl siloxanes with viscosities of from about 5 to<br><br>
WO 2004/006883	PCT/EP2003/007649<br>

10<br>
Humectants of the polyhydric alcohol type may also be employed as cosmetically acceptable carriers in compositions of this invention.  The humectant aids in increasing the effectiveness of the emollient, reduces scaling, stimulates removal of built-<br>
15  up scale and improves skin feel. Typical polyhydric alcohols include glycerol, polyalkylene glycols and more preferably alkylene polyols and their derivatives, including propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polyethylene glycol and derivatives thereof, sorbitol, hydroxypropyl<br>
20  sorbitol, hexylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, 1,2,6-<br>
hexanetriol, ethoxylated glycerol, propoxylated glycerol and mixtures thereof. For best results the humectant is preferably propylene glycol or sodium hyaluronate.  The amount of humectant may range anywhere from 0.5% to 30%, preferably<br>
25  between 1% and 15% by weight of the composition.<br>
Thickeners may also be utilized as part of the cosmetically acceptable carrier of compositions according to the present invention.

10  Collectively, the water, solvents, silicones, esters, fatty acids, humectants and/or thickeners will constitute the cosmetically acceptable carrier in amounts from 1% to 99.9%, preferably from 80% to 99% by weight.<br>
15  An oil or oily material may be present, together with an emulsifier to provide either a water-in-oil emulsion or an oil-in-water emulsion, depending largely on the average hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) of the emulsifier employed.<br>
20<br>
Various types of additional active ingredients may be present in cosmetic compositiona of the present invention. Actives are defined as skin benefit agents other than emollients and other than ingredients that merely improve the physical<br>
25  characteristics of the composition. Although not limited to this category, general examples include additional anti-sebum ingredients such as talcs and silicas, as well as alpha-hydroxy acids, beta-hydroxy acids, poly-hydroxy acids, benzoyl peroxide, zinc salts, and sunscreens.<br>

Beta-hydroxy acids include salicylic acid, for example.  Zinc pyrithione is an example of zinc salts useful in the compositions of the present invention.<br>
5  Sunscreens include those materials commonly employed to block ultraviolet light.  Illustrative compounds are the derivatives of PABA, cinnamate and salicylate.  For example,<br>
avobenzophenone (Parsol 1789) , octyl methoxycinnamate and 2-<br>
hydroxy-4-methoxy benzophenone (also known as oxybenzone) can 10  be used. Octyl methoxycinnamate and 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy<br>
benzophenone are commercially available under the trademarks, Parsol MCX and Benzophenone-3, respectively.  The exact amount of sunscreen employed in the compositions can vary depending upon the degree of protection desired from the sun's UV 15  radiation.<br>
Many cosmetic compositions, especially those containing water, must be protected against the growth of potentially harmful microorganisms. Anti-microbial compounds, such as triclosan,<br>
20  and preservatives are, therefore, necessary.  Suitable<br>
preservatives include alkyl esters of phydroxybenzoic acid, hydantoin derivatives, propionate salts, and a variety of quaternary ammonium compounds.  Particularly preferred preservatives of this invention are methyl paraben, propyl<br>
25 paraben, phenoxyethanol and benzyl alcohol. Preservatives will usually be employed in amounts ranging from about 0.1% to 2% by weight of the composition.<br>
The compounds and compositions according to the invention are 30  intended primarily as a product for topical application to human skin, especially as an agent for controlling or<br><br>
WO 2004/006883	PCT/EP2003/007649<br>

5  EXAMPLE 1<br>
This example provided carboxymethylation of an alcohol, which yields carboxymethylates of isoalcohols with a purity of about 50% to about 70%. 10<br>
Potassium tertiary-butoxide (9.42g, 0.084mole) was weighed out into a small round bottom flask under moisture free<br>
atmosphere (N2 dry box). To this was then added 25ml dry p-<br>
® dioxane and while stirring, a mixture of Exxal 13 alcohol<br>
15  (4.0g, 0.02mole) and chloroacetic acid (1.89g, 0.02mole) in 15ml dry p-dioxane was added. The heterogeneous reaction mixture was then stirred and heated at slight reflux overnight under N2. The overnight heating caused a slight colouration to the mixture.<br>
20<br>
Heating was stopped, and after cooling to room temperature the solids were filtered and washed with p-dioxane and suction dried to give 6.70g lightly coloured paste. The paste was dissolved in water and acidified with HCl and<br>
25  extracted with chloroform (separatory funnel). The<br>
chloroform was dried (MgS04) and after filtration, removal of<br>
chloroform (Rotavap) yielded about 0.90g of light brown oily liquid product.<br><br>
WO 2004/006883	PCT/EP2003/007649<br>
27<br>
H and  C NMR's of the liquid product indicated desired<br>
carboxymethylated product (acid form) ( H singlet at 4.11 ppm<br>
for R-O-CH2CO2 and multiplet at 3.56ppm for R-CH2-O-) ( C<br>
peaks at 60.34 and 67.88 ppm for the -CH2-O-CH2-CO).  This<br>
5  was further supported by GC analysis of the liquid product<br>
(silylated) versus starting Exxal 13 alcohol and<br>
chloroacetic acid. The carboxymethylated product had retention times of about 2 minutes and about 6 minutes longer than the alcohol and chloroacetic acid respectively. Half of 10  the carboxymethylated product in acid form was converted to the sodium salt in water and recovery of the sodium salt form was recovered via freeze-drying. Both the acid form and the salt form of the carboxymethylated product were used in the examples that follow.<br>

EXAMPLE 2<br>
This example provided carboxyethylation of a branched alcohol, which yields carboxyethylates of iso-alcohols (iso-tridecyloxy 20  propionic acid) with a purity of about 98% to about 99%.<br>
® To iso-tridecanol, Exxal 13 alcohol (4.0g, 0.02mole), in a<br>
small 3-neck round bottom flask fitted with a condenser and stirrer, was added a catalytic amount of pulverized potassium 25  hydroxide (32 milli-grams).  While stirring well,<br>
acrylonitrile (0.93 g, 0.02 mole) was added dropwise via a syringe. The reaction mixture was then stirred at room/ambient temperature for two hours. During the stirring, the mixture turned warm.  The mixture was then heated at 600C<br><br>
WO 2004/006883	PCT/EP2003/007649<br>
-   28   -<br>
for two hours, GC and IR (band at 2257 cm  for CN) analyses of the reaction mixture showed the main reaction product was iso-tridecyloxypropionitrile, as well as absence of iso-tridecanol . 5<br>
The iso-tridecyloxypropionitrile (2 g) and 8 ml concentrated hydrochloric acid were charged into a small 3-neck round-bottom flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and condenser and heated at 75-800c (water bath) for one hour and then at 10  reflux for 3 hours.<br>
After allowing the reaction mixture to cool to room/ambient temperature, the aqueous layer was extracted with 20 ml chloroform and dried. Note, hexeine extraction may also be 15  used.<br>
The chloroform was completely removed (Rotavap), yielding about 2.0 g clear colourless liquid product. This was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and infrared spectroscopy<br>
20  (IR: strong carbonyl band at 1722 cm ) to be the<br>
carboxyethyl iso-tridecanol product. Advantageously, the purity of the carboxyethyl iso-tridecanol product is at least about 98%.  Potential by products are: ammonium chloride, dimer of TDCE, ester of TDCE.<br>

EXAMPLE  3<br>
This example provided comparative data on inhibition of 5  sebocyte lipogenesis by the carboxymethylated and the<br>
carboxyethylated products of Examples 1 and 2, respectively.<br>
The iso-tridecyl carboxymethylated product and the iso-tridecyl carboxyethylated products (hereinafter "TDCM" and 10  "TDCE", respectively) and sodium salts thereof were obtained from Examples I and 2,   respectively.<br>
Secondary cultures of human sebocytes obtained from an adult male were grown in 96-well tissue culture plates (Packard<br>
15  Co.; Meriden, CT) until confluent.  Sebocyte growth medium consisted of Clonetics Keratinocyte Basal Medium (KBM) supplemented with 14 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract, 0.4 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 5 μg/ml insulin, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 1.2 x 10"" M cholera toxin, lOO units/ml<br>
20  penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All cultures were incubated at 37°C in the presence of 7.5% CO2. Medium was changed three times per week.<br>
On the day of experimentation, the growth medium was removed 25  and the sebocytes washed three times with sterile Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; phenol red free).  Fresh DMEM was added to each sample (duplicates, triplicates, or quadruplicates depending on the experiment) with 5 pL of test agent solubilized in ethanol or sterile, distilled water. 3 0  Controls consisted of addition of ethanol alone or phenol<br><br>

10<br><br>
Each plate was returned to the incubator for 20 hours followed by the addition of 14C-acetate buffer (5 mM final concentration, 56 mCi/mmol specific activity).  Sebocytes were returned to the incubator for four hours after which each culture was rinsed three times with phosphate buffered saline to remove unbound label. Radioactive label remaining in the sebocytes was harvested and counted using a TopCount-NXT brand scintillation counter (Packard Co., Meriden, Connecticut).<br><br>
The results that were obtained, expressed in terms of amount 15  of radioactive label remaining in the sebocytes aa a percent of control, are summarized in Table 2. A lower radioactive label, i.e. a lower % of control, indicates a greater inhibition of sebocyte lipogenesis.<br>

As shown in Table 2, both iso-tridecyl carboxymethylate 5  (TDCM) and iso-tridecyl carboxyethylate (TDCE) enhanced<br>
inhibition of lipogenesis at all tested concentrations. As can be seen from a comparison of the data in Table 2, TDCE performed significantly better than TDCM, i.e., TDCE was almost twice as effective as TDCM. 10<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
This example provides carboxypropylation of an alcohol, which yields the corresponding alkyl oxy butyric acid with a purity 15  of about 50% to about 70%.<br>
