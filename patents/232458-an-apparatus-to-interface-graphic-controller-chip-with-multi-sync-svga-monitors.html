				<td>FIELD  OF INVENTION<br>
This  invention relates to an  apparatus  for interfacing Graphic controller chip with multi-sync SVGA (Super  Video  Graphic  Adaptor) monitors  to  obtain  • comparable  resolution as that of a RGB  monitors  which are comparatively very expensive. PRIOR ART<br>
RGB  (Red Green Blue) monitors are  used  for data  visualisation.   RGB monitors are  ruggedised and capable   of  receiving  composite  video   signals  or separated video and  synchronous signals.<br>
The main limitation of use of RGB monitors is<br>
that these monitors are costly, about 819—1(90 times more<br>
than  a  SVGA monitor, and therefore their  use  is not<br>
cost-effective  for system development  purposes   where<br>
number of RGB monitors are required.<br>
Another  disadvantage of the RGB monitors  is that these are bulky.<br>
Still   another  disadvantage  of   the   RGB monitors  is  that their maintenance  is  difficult  and costly.<br>
Further disadvantage of the RGB monitors   is that  these are not readily available  off-the-shelf  in the market while SVGA monitors are readily  available.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for interfacing graphic controller chip with multi-sync SVGA monitors to provide a cheaper alternative option to the costly RGB monitors, thereby enabling drastic reduction in development cost of the systems.<br>
Another obiect of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for interfacing graphic controller chip with multi-sync SVGA monitors to provide resolution comparable to that of RGB monitors.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for interfacing graphic controller chip with multi-sync SVGA monitors which are lighter in<br>
weight and hence easy to handle .<br>
Further object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for interfacing graphic controller chip with multi-sync SVGA monitors to enable its use as a standby, to costly RGB monitor thereby reducing the down time.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for interfacing graphic controller chip with multi-sync SVGA monitors, which are readily available, to obtain performance comparable to RGB monitors, which are not readily available off-the-shelf in the market.<br>
Even further object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for interfacing graphic controller chip with multi-sync SVGA monitors wherein the apparatus is SVGA upward compatible<br><br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided<br>
an apparatus for interfacing graphic controller chip with multi-sync SVGA monitor to provide performance<br>
comparable to RGB monitor comprising a sync separator/amplifier (5) adapted to receive signals from<br>
a graphic controller chip (1), a buffer + phase inverter (6) connected to the output of said amplifier,<br>
TTL level converter (7) connected to said buffer phase inverter, a buffer (8) connected to said converter,<br>
integrator and emitter follower (9) connected to said converter, said follower connected to said buffer<br>
through two inverters (11) and  (12).<br>
Fig. l(a) illustrates the use of known RGB monitors. The graphic controller chip like ADV 453 is<br>
capable of producing Red (R), Blue (B) and Sync on Green (SQG) signals. RGB monitors require only 3 lines R,<br>
SOG, B to reproduce video display. The internal circuitry of RGB monitors is capable of separating »ync<br>
signal  from SOG signal so as to obtain Horizontal  sync<br><br>
 (H Sync) and Vertical  sync (V Sync) signals.  Thus  the signals  R, SOB, B produced by graphic  controller  chip<br>
like  ADV 453 are directly compatible and  can  straight away  be applied to RGB monitors.   On the  other  hand,<br>
SVGA  monitor  require  separated analog  video  signal*<br>
(RGB)   and  digital  sync signal.   The  composite  SO6<br>
signal  produced by graphic controller chip if  directly fed  into SVGA monitor is therefore not compatible  with<br>
SVGA monitor standard.  More over SOG signal if directly applied   to SVGA  monitor  would  lead   to  greenish<br>
background  with some SVGA monitors.    The  interfacing apparatus of the present invention resolves this problem<br>
by  converting   the  R, SOG, B  signals  received  from graphic   controller  chip  into   R,G,B   (collectively<br>
referred  in  the  art   as  analog  video  signal)  and horizontal  sync  (H sync) and vertical  sync  (V  sync)<br>
signals.   In other words SOG signal is  separated  into Green only and H sync and V sync signals.  In this   way<br>
separate  analog signals (RGB) and sync signals are fed into multi-sync SVGA monitor.<br>
The  interfacing  apparatus  of  the  present<br>
invention is shown in fig. 3.  The  Sync on Green  (SOG) signal  from the graphic controller chip like ADV453  is<br>
simultaneously   fed   into   Sync   separator/amplifier (5)   and Sync remover + buffer (10).   Sync  separator/<br><br>
amplifier (5) separates and amplifies the sync signal from the composite SOG signal whereas the Sync remover + green buffer(lO) removes sync signals and its output is green signal only, which is directly applied to SVGA monitor. The sync signal separated by sync separator/amplifier (5) is successively applied through Buffer + Phase inverter (6), TTL (Transistor Transistor Logic) level converter (7) and thereafter simultaneously to Buffer (8) and to Integrator and emitter follower (9). The output of signal directly fed into the Buffer(8) is taken as Horizontal Sync (H Sync) signal. The output from Integrator and emitter follower (9) is fed into Inverter (1 l),The output from Inverter (11) is simultaneously applied to Buffer (8) and Inverter (12). The output from Inverter (11) is vertical sync (V Sync) signal while the output from Inverter (12) is inverted vertical sync signal (V sync\).<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION WITH RESPECT TO DRAWINGS<br>
i<br>
Referring to Fig 1, graphic controller chip (1) is capable of producing R (Red), B (Blue) and SOG (Sync on Green) signals.  requires analog signals (ie: R, G, B signals ) and digital sync signals separately for displaying video information. Interfacing converts the SOG signal into green (G) and Horizontal sync (H Sync), Vertical Sync (V Sync) Signals.<br>
Referring to Fig 2, the Sync on green (SOG) signal is applied to Sync separator/amplifier (5) and simultaneously to Sync remover + green buffer (10). The Sync separator/amplifier (5) is constituted by a diode clamper and a class 'A' amplifier. The diode clamps the composite sync signal which is amplified by the class 'A' amplifier. The sync remover + green buffer (10) is an emitter follower with diode clamp which removes the sync signal from the SOG before buffering. The output of the sync remover + green buffer (10) contains green signal alone , which is directly fed as "green" input to SVGA (Fig 1).<br>
Sync separator/amplifier (5) is connected to Buffer + Phase Inverter (6) which is constituted by a Darlington pair. The output from sync separator/amplifier (5) is applied by Buffer + Phase inverter (6) which introduces minimum loading on the amplified composite sync signal. The output of Buffer + Phase Inverter (6) is an inverted version of composite sync signal.<br>
Buffer + Phase inverter (6) is connected to TTL (Transistor Transistor Logic) level converter (7) . TTL level converter (7) is a gating circuit which makes AND operatidh with composite sync signal. The output of Buffer + Phase Inverter (6) is input to TTL Level Converter (7) which converts the received inverted composite sync signal to TTL level. The output of TTL level converter (7) is routed to Buffer (8) as well as to integrater and emitter follower (9). Buffer (8) is constituted by a TTL Buffer which increases the drive capability of the sync signals. The output of Buffer(8) produced from the direct input from TTL level converter is horizontal Sync (H Sync\) input of the<br><br>
SVGA monitor. Integrator and emitter follower (9) is constituted by an emitter follower and integrating network. The output of integrator and emitter follower (9) routed through inverter (11) and Buffer(8) is Vertical Sync (V Sync) signal. The output of inverter(12) through Buffer (8) is inverted Vertical sync signal (V Sync\).<br>
Another preferred embodiment of the pmsentinterfacing apparatus is constructed as shown in Fig3. This embodiment is particularly useful for meeting the requirement of <br>
negative modulation as well as positive modulation for sync separation and to select positive or negative video. In this embodiment, two more stages are provided. In this case also SOG signal from graphic controller chip (1) is simultaneously applied to sync separator/amplifier (5) and sync remover + green buffer(10). But in this embodiment the SOG signal is applied to sync separator/amplifier through "Sync Polarity Select"(l3) and SIB , SIC sets of contacts of a two-way three-pole slide switch The two-poles SIB, SIC of three-pole switch are connected to the sync separator/amplifier (5). The SOG signal to sync remover + green buffer (10) is applied through "Video Polarity Select" (14) and through the third-pole SI A of the three-pole slide switch .<br>
' The Sync Polarity Select (13) and Video Polarity Select (14) are basically class A amplifiers with inverted and non inverted output facility. The non-inverted output is represented by " + " output whereas inverted output is represented by'"-" output. In the case of negative modulated signals the Sync Polarity Select (13) is bypassed by the selection of the section SIB and SIC of the Slide Switch. At the same time, Video Polarity Select option is achieved through the switch section SI A. In this case, the non-inverted output of the Video Polarity Select (14) is connected to the input of the Sync Remover + Green Buffer (10) through the Switch Section SI A. In the case of positive modulate*! signals, the Sync Polarity Select (13) become operational and inverter Sync output is taken out from the Sync Polarity Select (13) and applied to the input of the Sync Separator/Amplifier (5) as in the previous case. The inverted video signal from the Video Polarity Select (14) signal is taken out as input for the Sync Remover + Green Buffer (10).<br><br>
The switch contacts for negative or positive modulation, are as under<br>
Negative Modulation	SI A	23 connected to 22<br>
Negative Modulation	SIB	15 connected to 17<br>
Negative Modulation	SIC	20 connected to 18<br>
Positive Modulation	SI A	23 connected to 21<br>
Positive Modulation	SIB	15 connected to 16<br>
Positive Modulation	SIC	20 connected to 19<br><br>
