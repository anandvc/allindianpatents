				<td>A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF FLEXIBLE AND FREE STANDING CONDUCTING POLYANILINE FILM<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of flexible and free standing conducting polyaniline film. The thickness of the film can be tailored. Background of the invention<br>
Hitherto conducting polyaniline has been reported as a free standing conducting film having a electronic conductivity of 0.1 to 1S/cm (Patent application - CSIR Ref. No NF 2907 00).<br>
Film formation property is not observed when unfunctionalised dopants like hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, acetic acid and various other mineral and organic acids are used as primary dopants.<br>
Copending patent application (C.S.I.R Ref. NF 290/00) discloses a process to obtain the free standing conducting polyaniline = 0.lto 1 S/cm. The drawback of the process described in NF 290 / 00 is that the free standing film is obtained by casting polyaniline solution in organic solvents like chloroform, benzene, xylene and toluene which are difficult to recover. Also, the letting out of solvents in the atmosphere leads to pollution and secondly electronic conductivity lies in the range of 0.1 to 1 S/cm, which is not enough for many applications.<br>
Flexible and free standing conducting polymer film has application in the shielding of electromagnetic interference [EMI], conducting wires, as a thin film for batteries, chemical sensor, anti-static agent, zebra connectors for multi-point connections and in many other electronic applications. It is therefore important to develop a process for the preparation of a flexible and free standing conducting polyaniline film. Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of flexible and free standing conducting polyaniline film around 10 S/cm and to avoid organic co-solvents to obviate the drawback as detailed above. Brief description of the accompanying drawing<br>
Figure 1 is a flow chart of the process of the invention outlining the steps in the preparation of conducting polyaniline. Summary of the invention<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of flexible and free standing conducting polyaniline film with electrical conductivity more than 10 S/cm,<br><br>
which comprises stirring an emeraldine base in the presence of a functionalised aromatic sulphonic acid as a primary dopant and a halo substituted phenol as a secondary dopant for 2 - 3 hours to obtain a homogeneous thick viscous solution, casting the said viscous solution on a suitable unreactive substrate and heating under vacuum at a temperature in the range of 50 -70°C for 10 - 24 hrs to obtain said flexible free standing polyaniline film.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the functionalised aromatic sulphonic acid used comprises camphor- 10-sulphonic acid.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the halo substituted phenols used is selected from the group consisting of bromophenol, chlorophenol and flurophenol.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the stirring is done by mechanical grinding.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the unreactive substrate is selected from the group consisting of polytetrafluoroethylene sheet, glass plate and mercury metal.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the surface conductivity of 100% stetched conducting polyaniline film obtained is 100 S/cm.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is by avoiding of co- solvent like chloroform, xylene, benzene and toluene. Detailed description of the invention<br>
The conducting polyaniline of the invention is compatible with various type of engineering plastics. Electronic conductivity can be imparted to whole of the structure in an uniform manner to conventional plastics used for making cabinets to house electronic equipment and are transparent to electromagnetic radiations. Closely packed electronic circuitry requires the enclosures or housing to be electrically conductive for removal of static charge. The shielding of electromagnetic interference [EMI] is carried out by either using metallic frames or conductive components made by loading carbon black or metal powder or metal fiber which are susceptible for galvanic corrosion. Polyaniline prepared by the process herein finds application as a new material which is free from corrosion and brittleness.<br>
In the present process the electronic conductivity of 10 S/cm is obtained on a free standing polyaniline film. The utilization of a conducting polyaniline is very difficult due to its intractable nature. That means it is neither soluble in any solvent nor has any softening point. Thus for its effective utilization processibility is still a great concern. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that film formation property in polyaniline in presence of primary dopant and secondary dopant as given in example can uncoil the structure to an extended structure to yield a material, which has film formation property. This<br><br>
effect depends upon the ratio of emeraldine base, primary dopant and secondary dopant. This ratio is not constant and essentially is the function of an orientation, functionality and electronegativity of the primary dopant.<br>
Emeraldine base form of polyaniline is prepared by the oxidative polymerisation of 0.1M aniline in 1M aqueous hydrochloric acid solution under vigorous stirring for a period of 4-6 hours at a temperature of 0 - 5° C by adding drop by drop 0.1 M aqueous solution of ammonium persulphate. At the end of the reaction acetone is added to terminate polymerisation reaction and the reaction mixture is filtered under suction and collected green precipitates of emeraldine hydrochloride are washed repeatedly with distilled water till these washings are colourless.<br>
The filtered and washed precipitates are then treated with either aqueous solution of 0 1 M sodium carbonate or ammonia under stirring for two hours for effective undoping reaction to obtain emeraldine base. This reaction mixture is filtered, washed with distilled water till washings are neutral to pH indicator paper. The collected blue precipitates are dried under dynamic vacuum at 60-80°C for 8 hours. The detail process is depicted in Figure 1.<br>
The emeraldine base is a starting material for the preparation of our conducting polyaniline. This emeraldine base is dispersed in 0.1M aqueous solution of functionalised organic sulphonic acid under vigorous stirring for 4 hours to achieve 0.50 mole % doping. After 4 hours of a doping reaction, solution is filtered under suction and collected material is given washing with 0.1M aqueous solution of functionalised organic sulphonic acid. The so obtained polymer is dried at 50°C under dynamic vacuum for 12 hours before use. The electronic conductivity of 2 ton pressed pellets of conducting protonic acid doped polyaniline by four-probe method at room temperature is given in Table 1.<br>
Table.l Doping level of 0.50 per mole of repeat unit of polyaniline (two aniline molecule)<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
The details of the process are explained below:<br>
In a beaker required amount of emeraldine base, functionalised organic sulphonic acid, halo substituted phenol are mixed by mechanical grinding for about 2 to 3hrs, a solution obtained which cast on poly tetrafluroethylene, glass substrate or any un-reactive substrate<br><br>
yields  a free  standing and flexible dark green conducting polyaniline  as  film.   The conductivity of the polyaniline film = lOS/cm is given in table.2<br>

The following examples are given by way of illustration and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>

A homogeneous thick viscous liquid was obtained which was coated on a glass plate and was heated under dynamic vacuum at 60°C for 20 hrs. The thickness of the film obtained was observed to be 0.5 mm and the conductivity 3 S/cm. The conductivity of the 100% stretched film was observed to be 30 S/cm.<br>
