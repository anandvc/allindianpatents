				<td>AN ISOLATED POLYPEPTIDE<br>
NOCO RECEPTOR ANTAGONTSTS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] This invention relates to neurobiology and<br>
molecular biology. More particularly, this invention<br>
relates to immunogenic Nogo receptor-1 polypeptides, Nogo<br>
receptor-1 antibodies, antigen-binding fragments thereof,<br>
soluble Nogo receptors and fusion proteins thereof and<br>
nucleic acids encoding the same. This invention further<br>
relates to compositions comprising, and methods for making<br>
and using, such Nogo receptor antibodies, antigen-binding<br>
fragments thereof, immunogenic Nogo receptor-1 polypeptides,<br>
soluble Nogo receptors and fusion proteins thereof and<br>
nucleic acids encoding the same.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002] Axons and dendrites of neurons are long cellular<br>
extensions from neurons. The distal tip of an extending<br>
axon or neurite comprises a specialized region, known as the<br>
growth cone. Growth cones sense the local environment and<br>
guide axonal growth toward the neuron's target cell. Growth<br>
cones respond to several environmental cues, for example,<br>
surface adhesiveness, growth factors, neurotransmitters and<br>
electric fields. The guidance of growth at the cone<br>
involves various classes of adhesion molecules,<br>
intercellular signals, as well as factors that stimulate and<br>
inhibit growth cones. The growth cone of a growing neurite<br>
advances at various rates, but typically at the speed of one<br>
to two millimeters per day.<br>
[0003] Growth cones are hand shaped, with broad flat<br>
expansion microspikes or filopodia) that differentially<br>
adhere to surfaces in the embryo. The filopodia are<br>
continually active, some filopodia retract back into the<br>
growth cone, while others continue to elongate through the<br>
substratum. The elongations between different filopodia<br>
form lamellipodia.<br>
[0004] The growth cone explores the area that is ahead of<br>
it and on either side with its lamellipodia and filopodia.<br>
When an elongation contacts a surface that is unfavorable to<br>
growth, it withdraws. When an elongation contacts a<br>
favorable growth surface, it continues to extend and guides<br>
the growth cone in that direction. The growth cone can be<br>
guided by small variations in surface properties of the<br>
substrata. When the growth cone reaches an appropriate<br>
target cell a synaptic connection is created.<br>
[0005] Nerve cell function is greatly influenced by the<br>
contact between the neuron and other cells in its immediate<br>
environment (U. Rutishauser, T. M. Jessell, Physiol. Rev.<br>
1988, 68, p. 819). These cells include specialized glial<br>
cells, oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS),<br>
and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS),<br>
which ensheathe the neuronal axon with myelin (an insulating<br>
structure of multi-layered membranes) (G. Lemke, in An<br>
Introduction to Molecular Neurobiology, Z. Hall, Ed.<br>
[Sinauer, Sunderland, Mass., 1992], p. 281).<br>
[0006] While CNS neurons have the capacity to regenerate<br>
after injury, they are inhibited from doing so because of<br>
the presence of inhibitory proteins present in myelin and<br>
possibly also by other types of molecules normally found in<br>
their local environment (Brittis and Flanagan, Neuron 2001,<br>
30, pp. 11-14; Jones et al., J. Neurosci. 2002, 22, pp.<br>
2792-2803; Grimpe et al. , J. Neurosci. 2002.. 22, pp. 3144-<br>
3160).<br>
[0007] Several myelin inhibitory proteins that are found<br>
on oligoden drocytes have been characterized, e.g., NogoA<br>
(Chen et al., Nature, 2000, 403, 434-439; Grandpre et al.,<br>
Nature 2000, 403, 439-444), myelin associated glycoprotein<br>
(MAG, McKerracher et al, Neuron 1994, 13, 805-811;<br>
Mukhopadhyay et al, Neuron 1994, 13, 757-767) and<br>
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (OM-gp, Mikol and Stefansson,<br>
J. Ceil. Biol. 1988, 106, 1273-1279). Each of these<br>
proteins has been separately shown to be a ligand for the<br>
neuronal Nogo receptor-1 (Wang et al., Nature 2002, 417,<br>
941-944; Liu et al., Science, 2002, 297, 1190-93; Grandpre<br>
et al., Nature 2000, 403, 439-444; Chen et al., Nature,<br>
2000, 403, 434-439; Domeniconi et al., Neuron, 2002, 35,<br>
283-90).<br>
[0008] Nogo receptor-1 is a GPI-anchored membrane protein<br>
that contains 8 leucine rich repeats (Fournier et al.,.<br>
Nature 2001, 409, 341-346) . Upon interaction with an<br>
inhibitory protein (e.g., NogoA, MAG and OM-gp), the Nogo<br>
receptor-1 complex transduces signals that lead to growth<br>
cone collapse and inhibition of neurite outgrowth.<br>
[0009] There is an urgent need for molecules that inhibit<br>
Nogo receptor-1 binding to its ligands and attenuate myelin-<br>
mediated growth cone collapse and inhibition of neurite<br>
outgrowth.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>

polypeptides that bind to the antibodies of the invention.<br>
The invention further relates to nucleic acids encoding the<br>
polypeptides of this invention, vectors and host cells<br>

receptor-1 and are useful for inhibiting binding of Nogo<br>
receptor-1 to its ligands, inhibiting growth cone collapse<br>
in a neuron and decreasing the inhibition of neurite<br>

Immunogenic Nogo Receptor-1 Polypeptides<br>
[0059] In one aspect the present invention relates to<br>
Nogo receptor-1 polypeptides that are immunogenic. In some<br>
embodiments of the invention, the immunogenic polypeptide<br>
consists essentially of an amino acid sequence selected from<br>
the group consisting of: LDLSDNAQLRWDPTT (rat) (SEQ ID NO:<br>
I) ; LDLSDNAQLRSVDPAT (human) (SEQ ID NO: 2) ;<br>
AVASGPFRPFQTNQLTDEELLGLPKCCQPDAADKA (rat) (SEQ ID NO: 3);<br>
AVATGPYHPIWTGRATDEEPLGLPKCCQPDAADKA (human) (SEQ ID NO: 4) ;<br>
and CRLGQAGSGA (mouse) (SEQ ID NO: 5) .<br>
[0060] In some embodiments, the invention relates to a<br>
nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide of SEQ ID NOs: 1-5. In<br>
some embodiments of the invention, the nucleic acid molecule<br>
is linked to an expression control sequence (e.g.,<br>
pCDNA(I)).<br>
[0061] The present invention also relates to a vector<br>
comprising a nucleic acid coding for an immunogenic<br>
polypeptide of the invention. In some embodiments of the<br>
invention, the vector is a cloning vector. In some<br>
embodiments of the invention, the vector is an expression<br>
vector. In some embodiments of the invention, the vector<br>
contains at least one selectable marker.<br>
[0062] The present invention also relates to host cells<br>
comprising the above-described nucleic acid or vector.<br>
[0063] The present invention also relates to a method of<br>
producing an immunogenic polypeptide of the invention<br>
comprising the step of culturing a host cell. In some<br>
embodiments, the host cell is prokaryotic. In some<br>
embodiments, the host cell is eukaryotic. In some<br>
embodiments, the host cell is yeast.<br>
Antibodies<br>
[0064] The present invention further relates to an<br>
antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof that<br>
specifically binds an immunogenic Nogo receptor-1<br>
polypeptide of the invention. In some embodiments the<br>
antibody or antigen-binding fragment binds a polypeptide<br>
consisting essentially of an amino acid sequence selected<br>
from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 1-5. The antibody<br>
or antigen-binding fragment of the present invention may be<br>
produced in vivo or in vitro. Production of the antibody or<br>
antigen-binding fragment is discussed below.<br>
[0065] An antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof<br>
of the invention inhibits the binding of Nogo receptor-1 to<br>
a ligand (e.g., NogoA, NogoB, NogoC, MAG, OM-gp) and<br>
decreases myelin-mediated inhibition of neurite outgrowth<br>
and sprouting, particularly axonal growth, and attenuates<br>
myelin mediated growth cone collapse.<br>
[0066] In some embodiments, the anti-Nogo receptor-1<br>
antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof is murine. In<br>
some embodiments, the Nogo receptor-1 is from rat. In other<br>
embodiments, the Nogo receptor-1 is human. In some<br>
embodiments the anti-Nogo receptor-1 antibody or antigen-<br>
binding fragment thereof is recombinant, engineered,<br>
humanized and/or chimeric.<br>
[0067] In some embodiments, the antibody is selected from<br>
the group consisting of: monoclonal 7E11 (ATCC accession<br>
No. PTA-4587); monoclonal 1H2 (ATCC® accession No. PTA-<br>
4584); monoclonal 2F7 (ATCC® accession No. PTA-4585);<br>
monoclonal 3G5 (ATCC® accession No. PTA-4586); and<br>
monoclonal 5B10 (ATCC® accession No. PTA-4588) . In some<br>
embodiments, the antibody is polyclonal antibody 46.<br>
[0068] Exemplary antigen-binding fragments are, Fab,<br>
Fab', F(ab')2, Fv, Fd, dAb, and fragments containing<br>
complementarity determining region (CDR) fragments,<br>
single-chain antibodies (scFv), chimeric antibodies,<br>
diabodies and polypeptides that contain at least a portion<br>
of an immunoglobulin that is sufficient to confer specific<br>
antigen-binding to the polypeptide (e.g., immunoadhesins).<br>
[0069] As used herein, Fd means a fragment that consists<br>
of the VH and CH1 domains; Fv means a fragment that consists<br>
of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody; and<br>
dAb means a fragment that consists of a VH domain (Ward et<br>
al., Nature 341:544-546, 1989). As used herein, single-<br>
chain antibody (scFv) means an antibody in which a VL region<br>
and a VH region are paired to form a monovalent molecules<br>
via a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a<br>
single protein chain (Bird et al., Science 242:423-426, 1988<br>
and Huston et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883,<br>
198 8). As used herein, diabody means a bispecific antibody<br>
in which VH and VL domains are expressed on a single<br>
polypeptide chain, but using a linker that is too short to<br>
allow for pairing between the two domains on the same chain,<br>
thereby forcing the domains to pair with complementary<br>
domains of another chain and creating two antigen-binding<br>
sites (see e.g., Holliger, P., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.<br>
Sci. USA 90:6444-6448, 1993, and Poljak, R. J., et al. ,<br>
Structure 2:1121-1123, 1994). As used herein, immunoadhesin<br>
that specifically binds an antigen of interest, means a<br>
molecule in which one or more CDRs may be incorporated,<br>
either covalently or noncovalently.<br>
[0070] In some embodiments, the invention provides a<br>
subunit polypeptide of a Nogo receptor-1 antibody of the<br>
invention, wherein the subunit polypeptide is selected from<br>
the group consisting of: (a) a heavy chain or a variable<br>
region thereof; and (b) a light chain or a variable region<br>
thereof.<br>
[0071] In some embodiments, the invention provides a<br>
nucleic acid encoding the heavy chain or the variable region<br>
thereof, or the light chain and the variable region thereof<br>
of a subunit polypeptide of a Nogo receptor-1 antibody of<br>
the invention.<br>
[0072] In some embodiments, the invention provides a<br>
hypervariable region (CDR) of a Nogo receptor-1 antibody of<br>
the invention or a nucleic acid encoding a CDR.<br>
Immunization<br>
[0073] Antibodies of the invention can be generated by<br>
immunization of a suitable host (e.g., vertebrates,<br>
including humans, mice, rats, sheep, goats, pigs, cattle,<br>
horses, reptiles, fishes, amphibians, and in eggs of birds,<br>
reptiles and fish). Such antibodies may be polyclonal or<br>
monoclonal.<br>
[0074] In some embodiments, the host is immunized with an<br>
immunogenic Nogo receptor-1 polypeptide of the invention.<br>
In other embodiments, the host is immunized with Nogo<br>
receptor-l associated with the cell membrane of an intact or<br>
disrupted cell and antibodies of the invention are<br>
identified by binding to an immunogenic Nogo receptor-l<br>
polypeptide of the invention.<br>
[0075] In some embodiments, the Nogo receptor-l antigen<br>
is administered with an adjuvant to stimulate the immune<br>
response. Adjuvants often need to be administered in<br>
addition to antigen in order to elicit an immune response to<br>
the antigen. These adjuvants are usually insoluble or<br>
undegradable substances that promote nonspecific<br>
inflammation, with recruitment of mononuclear phagocytes at<br>
the site of immunization. Examples of adjuvants include,<br>
but are not limited to, Freund's adjuvant, RIBI (muramyl<br>
dipeptides), ISCOM (immunostimulatinc complexes) or<br>
fragments thereof.<br>

Manual, Yelton, D.E. et al. (1981); Ann. Rev. of Biochem.,<br>
50, pp. 657-80., and Ausubel et al. (1989); Current<br>
Protocols in Molecular Biology (New York: John Wiley &amp;<br>
Sons). Determination of immunoreactivity with an<br>
immunogenic Nogo receptor-1 polypeptide of the invention may<br>
be made by any of several methods well known in the art,<br>
including, e.g., immunoblot assay and ELISA.<br>
Production of Antibodies and Antibody Producing Cell Lines<br>
[0077] Monoclonal antibodies of the invention can made by<br>
standard procedures as described, e.g., in Harlow and Lane<br>
(1988), supra.<br>
[0078] Briefly, at an appropriate period of time the<br>
animal is sacrificed and lymph node and/or splenic B-cells<br>
are immortalized by any one of several techniques that are<br>
well-known in the art, including but not limited to<br>
transformation, such as with EBV or fusion with an<br>
immortalised cell line, such as myeloma cells. Thereafter,<br>
the cells are clonally separated and the supernatants of<br>
each clone tested for production of an antibody specific for<br>
an immunogenic Nogo receptor-1 polypeptide of the invention.<br>
Methods of selecting, cloning and expanding hybridomas are<br>
well known in the art. Similarly, methods for identifying<br>
the nucleotide and amino acid sequence of the immunoglobulin<br>
genes are known in the art.<br>
[0079] Other suitable techniques for producing an<br>
antibody of the invention involve in vitro exposure of<br>
lymphocytes to the Nogo receptor-1 or to an immunogenic<br>
polypeptide of the invention, or alternatively, selection of<br>
libraries of antibodies in phage or similar vectors. See<br>
Huse et al., Science, 246, pp. 1275-81 (1989). Antibodies<br>
useful in the present invention may be employed with or<br>
without modification.<br>
[0080] Antigens (in this case Nogo receptor-1 or an<br>
immunogenic polypeptide of the invention) and antibodies can<br>
be labeled by joining, either covalently or non-covalently,<br>
a substance that provides for a detectable signal. Various<br>
labels and conjugation techniques are known in the art and<br>
can be employed in practicing the invention. Suitable<br>
labels include, but are not limited to, radionucleotides,<br>
enzymes, substrates, cofactors, inhibitors, fluorescent<br>
agents, chemiluminescent agents, magnetic particles and the<br>
like. Patents teaching the use of such labels include U.S.<br>
Patents 3,817,837; 3,850,752; 3,939,350; 3,996,345;<br>
4,277,437; 4,275,149 and 4,366,241. Also, recombinant<br>
immunoglobulins may be produced (see U.S. Patent 4,816,567).<br>
[0081] In some embodiments of the invention, an antibody<br>
has multiple binding specificities, such as a bifunctional<br>
antibody prepared by any one of a number of techniques known<br>
to those of skill in the art including the production of<br>
hybrid hybridomas, disulfide exchange, chemical cross-<br>
linking, addition of peptide linkers between two monoclonal<br>
antibodies, the introduction of two sets of immunoglobulin<br>
 heavy and light chains into a particular cell line, and so<br>
forth (see below for more detailed discussion).<br>
[0082] The antibodies of this invention may also be human<br>
monoclonal antibodies, for example those produced by<br>
immortalized human cells, by SCID-hu mice or other non-human<br>
 animals capable of producing "human" antibodies.<br>
Phage Display Libraries<br>
[0083] Anti-Nogo receptor-1 antibodies of this invention<br>
can be isolated by screening a recombinant combinatorial<br>
antibody library. Exemplary combinatorial libraries are for<br>
binding to an immunogenic Nogo receptor-1 polypeptide of the<br>
invention, such as a scFv phage display library, prepared<br>
using VL and VK cDNAs prepared from mRNA derived an animal<br>
immunized with an immunogenic Nogo receptor-1 polypeptide of<br>
the invention. Methodologies for preparing and screening<br>
such libraries are known in the art. There are commercially<br>
available methods and materials for generating phage display<br>
libraries (e.g., the Pharmacia Recombinant Phage Antibody-<br>
System, catalog no. 27-9400-01; the Stratagene SurfZAP <br>
phage display kit, catalog no. 240612; and others from<br>
MorphoSys). There are also other methods and reagents that<br>
can be used in generating and screening antibody display<br>
libraries (see e.g., Ladner et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409;<br>

Sci. USA 88:7978-7982.<br>
[0084] Following screening and isolation of an anti-Nogo<br>
receptor-1 antibody of the invention from a recombinant<br>
immunoglobulin display library, the nucleic acid encoding<br>
the selected antibody can be recovered from the display<br>
package (e.g., from the phage genome) and subcloned into<br>
other expression vectors by standard recombinant DNA<br>
techniques. If desired, the nucleic acid can be further<br>
manipulated to create other antibody forms of the invention,<br>
as described below. To express an antibody isolated by<br>
screening a combinatorial library, DNA encoding the antibody<br>
heavy chain and light chain or the variable regions thereof<br>
is cloned into a recombinant expression vector and<br>
introduced into a mammalian host cell, as described above.<br>
Class Switching<br>
[0085] Anti-Nogo receptor-1 antibodies of the invention<br>
can be of any isotype. An antibody of any desired isotype<br>
can be produced by class switching. For class switching,<br>
nucleic acids encoding VL or VH, that do not include any<br>
nucleotide sequences encoding CL or CH, are isolated using<br>
methods well known in the art. The nucleic acids encoding<br>
VL, or VH are then operatively linked to a nucleotide<br>
sequence encoding a CL or CH from a desired class of<br>
immunoglobulin molecule. This may be achieved using a<br>
vector or nucleic acid that comprises a CL, or CH chain, as<br>
described above. For example, an anti-Nogo receptor-1<br>
antibody of the invention that was originally IgM may be<br>
class switched to an IgG. Further, the class switching may<br>
be used to convert one IgG subclass to another, e.g., from<br>
IgGl to IgG2.<br>
Mutated Antibodies<br>
[0086] In other embodiments, antibodies or antigen-<br>
binding fragments of the invention may be mutated in the<br>
variable domains of the heavy and/or light chains to alter a<br>
) binding property of the antibody. For example, a mutation<br>
may be made in one or more of the CDR regions to increase or<br>
decrease the Kd of the antibody for Nogo receptor-1, to<br>
increase or decrease KOff, or to alter the binding<br>
specificity of the antibody. Techniques in site-directed<br>
mutagenesis are well known in the art. See e.g., Sambrook<br>
et al. and Ausubel et al., supra. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, mutations are made at an amino acid residue that<br>
is known to be changed compared to germline in a variable<br>
region of an anti-Nogo receptor-i antibody of the invention.<br>
In some embodiments, mutations are made at one or more amino<br>
acid residues that are known to be changed compared to the<br>
germline in a variable region of an anti-Nogo receptor-1<br>
antibody of the invention. In another embodiment, a nucleic<br>
acid encoding an antibody heavy chain or light chain<br>
variable region is mutated in one or more of the framework<br>
regions. A mutation may be made in a framework region or<br>
constant domain to increase the half-life. A mutation in a<br>
framework region or constant domain also may be made to<br>
alter the immunogenicity of the antibody, to provide a site<br>
for covalent or non-covalent binding to another molecule, or<br>
to alter such properties as complement fixation. Mutations<br>
may be made in each of the framework regions, the constant<br>
domain and the variable regions in a single mutated<br>
antibody. Alternatively, mutations may be made in only one<br>
of the framework regions, the variable regions or the<br>
constant domain in a single mutated antibody.<br>
Fusion Antibodies and Immunoadhesins<br>
[0087] In another embodiment, a fusion antibody or<br>
immunoadhesin may be made which comprises all or a portion<br>
of an anti-Nogo receptor-1 antibody of the invention linked<br>
to another polypeptide. In some embodiments, only the<br>
variable region of the anti-Nogo receptor-1 antibody is<br>
linked to the polypeptide. In other embodiments, the VH<br>
domain of an anti-Nogo receptor-1 antibody of this invention<br>
is linked to a first polypeptide, while the VL domain of the<br>
antibody is linked to a second polypeptide that associates<br>
with the first polypeptide in a manner that permits the VH<br>
and VL domains to interact with one another to form an<br>
antibody binding site. In other embodiments, the VH domain<br>
is separated from the VL, domain by a linker that permits the<br>
VH and VL domains to interact with one another (see below<br>
under Single Chain Antibodies). The VH -linker- VL antibody<br>
is then linked to a polypeptide of interest. The fusion<br>
antibody is useful to directing a polypeptide to a cell or<br>
tissue that expresses a Nogo receptor-1 ligand. The<br>
polypeptide of interest may be a therapeutic agent, such as<br>
a toxin, or may be a diagnostic agent, such as an enzyme<br>
that may be easily visualized, such as horseradish<br>
peroxidase. In addition, fusion antibodies can be created<br>
in which two (or more) single-chain antibodies are linked to<br>
one another. This is useful if one wants to create a<br>
divalent or polyvalent antibody on a single polypeptide<br>
chain, or if one wants to create a bispecific antibody.<br>
Single Chain Antibodies<br>
[0088] The present invention includes a single chain<br>
antibody (scFv) that binds an immunogenic Nogo receptor-1<br>
polypeptide of the invention. To produce the ScFv, VH- and<br>
VL-encoding DNA is operatively linked to DNA encoding a<br>
flexible linker, e.g., encoding the amino acid sequence<br>
(Gly4-Ser)3/ such that the VH and VL sequences can be<br>
expressed as a contiguous single-chain protein, with the VL<br>
and VH regions joined by the flexible linker (see e.g., Bird<br>
et al. (1988) Science 242:423-426; Huston et al. (1988)<br>
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883; McCafferty et al. ,<br>
Nature (1990) 348:552-554). The single chain antibody may<br>
be monovalent, if only a single VH and VL are used,<br>
bivalent, if two VH and VL are used, or polyvalent, if more<br>
than two VH and VL are used.<br>
Chimeric Antibodies<br>
[0089] The present invention further includes a<br>
bispecific antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof in<br>
which one specificity is for an immunogenic Nogo receptor-1<br>
polypeptide of the invention. In one embodiment, a chimeric<br>
antibody can be generated that specifically binds to an<br>
immunogenic Nogo receptor-1 polypeptide of the invention<br>
through one binding domain and co a second molecule through<br>
a second binding domain. The chimeric antibody can be<br>
produced through recombinant molecular biological<br>
techniques, or may be physically conjugated together. In<br>
addition, a single chain antibody containing more than one<br>
VH and VL may be generated that binds specifically to an<br>
immunogenic polypeptide of the invention and to another<br>
molecule that is associated with attenuating myelin mediated<br>
growth cone collapse and inhibition of neurite outgrowth and<br>
sprouting. Such bispecific antibodies can be generated<br>
using techniques that are well known for example, Fanger et<br>
al. Immunol Methods 4: 72-81 (1994) and Wright and Harris,<br>
supra, and in connection with (iii) see e.g., Traunecker et<br>
al. Int. J. Cancer (Suppl.) 7: 51-52 (1992).<br>
[0090] In some embodiments, the chimeric antibodies are<br>
prepared using one or more of the variable regions from an<br>
antibody of the invention. In another embodiment, the<br>
chimeric antibody is prepared using one or more CDR regions<br>
from said antibody.<br>
Derivatized and Labeled Antibodies<br>
[0091] An antibody or an antigen-binding fragment of the<br>
invention can be derivatized or linked to another molecule<br>
(e.g., another peptide or protein). In general, the<br>
antibody or antigen-binding fragment is derivatized such<br>
that binding to an immunogenic polypeptide of the invention<br>
is not affected adversely by the derivatization or labeling.<br>
For example, an antibody or antibody portion of the<br>
invention can be functionally linked (by chemical coupling,<br>
genetic fusion, noncovalent association or otherwise) to one<br>
or more other molecular entities, such as another antibody<br>
(e.g., a bispecific antibody or a diabody), a detection<br>
agent, a cytotoxic agent, a pharmaceutical agent, and/or a<br>
protein or peptide that can mediate association of the<br>
antibody or antigen-binding fragment with another molecule<br>
(such as a streptavidin core region or a polyhistidine tag).<br>
[0092] In some embodiments, a derivatized antibody is<br>
produced by crosslinking two or more antibodies (of the same<br>
type or of different types, e.g., to create bispecific<br>
antibodies). Suitable crosslinkers include those that are<br>
heterobifunctional, having two distinctly reactive groups<br>
separated by an appropriate spacer (e.g.,<br>
m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester) or<br>
homobifunctional (e.g., disuccinimidyl suberate). Such<br>
linkers are available from Pierce Chemical Company,<br>
Rockford, 111.<br>
[0093] In some embodiments, the derivatized antibody is a<br>
labeled antibody. Exemplary, detection agents with which an<br>
antibody or antibody portion of the invention may be<br>
derivatized are fluorescent compounds, including<br>
fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine,<br>
5-dimethylamine-l-napthalenesulfonyl chloride,<br>
phycoerythrin, lanthanide phosphors and the like. An<br>
antibody also may be labeled with enzymes that are useful<br>
for detection, such as horseradish peroxidase,<br>
b-galactosidase, luciferase, alkaline phosphatase, glucose<br>
oxidase and the like. In embodiments that are labeled with<br>
a detectable enzyme, the antibody is detected by adding<br>
additional reagents that the enzyme uses to produce a<br>
detectable reaction product. For example, horseradish<br>
peroxidase with hydrogen peroxide and diaminobenzidine. An<br>
antibody also may be labeled with biotin, and detected<br>
through indirect measurement of avidin or streptavidin<br>
binding. An antibody may also be labeled with a<br>
predetermined polypeptide epitopes recognized by a secondary<br>
reporter (e.g., leucine zipper pair sequences, binding sites<br>
for secondary antibodies, metal binding domains, epitope<br>
tags).<br>
[00943 An anti-Nogo receptor-1 antibody or an antigen-<br>
fragment thereof also may be labeled with a radio-labeled<br>
amino acid. The radiolabel may be used for both diagnostic<br>
and therapeutic purposes. The radio-labeled anti-Nogo<br>
receptor-1 antibody may be used diagnostically, for example,<br>
for determining Nogo receptor-1 levels in a subject.<br>
Further, the radio-labeled anti-Nogo receptor-1 antibody may<br>
be used therapeutically for treating spinal cord injury.<br>
Examples of labels for polypeptides include, but are not<br>
limited to, the following radioisotopes or radionucleotides<br>
- 3H, 14C, 15N, 35S, 90Y, 99Tc, 111In, 135I, 131I .<br>
[0095] An anti-Nogo receptor-1 antibody or an antigen-<br>
fragment thereof may also be derivatised with a chemical<br>
group such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) , a methyl or ethyl<br>
group, or a carbohydrate group. These groups may be useful<br>
to improve the biological characteristics of the antibody,<br>
e.g., to increase serum half-life or to increase tissue<br>
binding.<br>
Characterisation of Anti-Nogo receptor-1 Antibodies<br>
Class and Subclass of Anti-Nogo receptor-1 Antibodies<br>
[0096] The class and subclass of anti-Nogo receptor-1<br>
antibodies may be determined by any method known in the art.<br>
In general, the class and subclass of an antibody may be<br>
determined using antibodies that are specific for a<br>
particular class and subclass of antibody. Such antibodies<br>
are available commercially. The class and subclass can be<br>
determined by ELISA, Western Blot as well as other<br>
techniques. Alternatively, the class and subclass may be<br>
determined by sequencing all or a portion of the constant<br>
domains of the heavy and/or light chains of the antibodies,<br>
comparing their amino acid sequences to the known amino acid<br>
sequences of various class and subclasses of<br>
immunoglobulins, and determining the class and subclass of<br>
the antibodies.<br>
Binding affinity of anti-Nogo receptor-1 antibody to Nogo<br>
receptor-1<br>
[0097] The binding affinity and dissociation rate of an<br>
anti-Nogo receptor-1 antibody of the invention to an<br>
immunogenic Nogo receptor-1 polypeptide of the invention may<br>
be determined by any method known in the art. For example,<br>
the binding affinity can be measured by competitive ELISAs,<br>
RIAs, BIAcore or KinExA technology. The dissociation rate<br>
also can be measured by BIAcore or KinExA technology. The<br>
binding affinity and dissociation rate are measured by<br>
surface plasmon resonance using, e.g., a BIAcore.<br>
[0098] The Kd of 7E11 and 1H2 were determined to be 1 x<br>
10-7 M and 2 x 10-8 M, respectively.<br>
Inhibition of Nogo receptor-1 activity by anti- Nogo<br>
receptor-1 antibody<br>
[0099] In some embodiments, an anti-Nogo receptor-1<br>
antibody or an antigen-binding fragment of the invention<br>
thereof inhibits the binding of Nogo receptor-1 to a ligand.<br>
The IC50 of such inhibition can be measured by any method<br>
known in the art, e.g., by ELISA, RIA, or Functional<br>
Antagonism. In some embodiments, the IC50 is between 0.1 and<br>
500 nM. In some embodiments, the IC50 is between 10 and 400<br>
nM. In yet other embodiments, the antibody or portion<br>
thereof has an IC50 of between 60 nM and 400 nM. The IC50 of<br>
7E1I and 1K2 were determined to be 400 nM and 60 nM,<br>
respectively, in a binding assay. See also Table 3, infra.<br>
[0100] In sum, one of skill in the art, provided with the<br>
teachings of this invention, has available a variety of<br>
methods which may be used to alter the biological properties<br>
of the antibodies of this invention including methods which<br>
would increase or decrease the stability or half-life,<br>
immunogenicity, toxicity, affinity or yield of a given<br>
antibody molecule, or to alter it in any other way that may<br>
render it more suitable for a particular application.<br>
[0101] Compositions comprising, and uses of, the<br>
antibodies of the present invention are described below.<br>
Soluble Nogo Receptor-1 Polypeptides<br>
Protein<br>
[0102] Full-length Nogo receptor-1 consists of a signal<br>
sequence, a N-terminus region (NT), eight leucine rich<br>
repeats (LRR), a LRRCT region (a leucine rich repeat domain<br>
C-terminal of the eight leucine rich repeats), a C-terminus<br>
region (CT) and a GPI anchor (see Fig. 1) .<br>
[0103] Some embodiments of the invention provide a<br>
soluble Nogo receptor-1 polypeptide. Soluble Nogo receptor-<br>
1 polypeptides of the invention comprise an NT domain; 6<br>
LRRs and an LRRCT domain and lack a signal sequence and a<br>
functional GPI anchor (i.e., no GPI anchor or a GPI anchor<br>
that lacks the ability to efficiently associate to a cell<br>
membrane).<br>
[0104] In some embodiments, a soluble Nogo receptor-l<br>
polypeptide comprises a heterologous LRR. In some<br>
embodiments a soluble Nogo receptor-1 polypeptide comprises<br>
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 heterologous LRR's. A heterologous<br>
LRR means an LRR obtained from a protein other than Nogo<br>
receptor-1. Exemplary proteins from which a heterologous<br>
LRR can be obtained are toll-like receptor (TLR1.2); T-cell<br>
activation leucine repeat rich protein; deceorin; OM-gp;<br>
insulin-like growth factor binding protein acidic labile<br>
subunit slit and robo; and toll-like receptor 4.<br>
[0105] In some embodiments, the invention provides a<br>
soluble Nogo receptor-1 polypeptide of 319 amino acids<br>
(soluble Nogo receptor-1 344, sNogoR1-344, or sNogoR344)<br>
(residues 26-344 of SEQ ID NOs: 6 and 8 or residues 27-344<br>
of SEQ ID NO: 8). In some embodiments, the invention<br>
provides a soluble Nogo receptor-1 polypeptide of 2 85 amino<br>
acids (soluble Nogo receptor-1 310, sNogoR1-310, or<br>
sNogoR310) (residues 26-310 of SEQ ID NOs: 7 and 9 or<br>
residues 27-310 of SEQ ID NO: 9). See Fig. 1.<br>
Table 1. Sequences of Human and Rat Nogo receptor-1<br>
Polypeptides<br>
[SHOULD WE ADD THE FULL-LENGTH AND 1-310 MOUSE SEQUENCES TO<br>
THIS TABLE?]<br>
[0106] In some embodiments of the invention, the soluble<br>
Nogo receptor-1 polypeptides of the invention are used to<br>
inhibit the binding of a ligand to Nogo receptor-1 and act<br>
as an antagonist of Nogo receptor-1 ligands. In some<br>
embodiments of the invention, the soluble Nogo receptor-1<br>
polypeptides of the invention are used to decrease<br>
inhibition of neurite outgrowth and sprouting in a neuron,<br>
such as axonal growth and to inhibit myelin mediated growth<br>
cone collapse in a neuron. In some embodiments, the neuron<br>
is a CNS neuron.<br>
[0107] sNogoR310 and sNogoR344, surprisingly, block the<br>
binding of NogoA, NogoB, NogoC, MAG and OM-gp to Nogo<br>
receptor-1.<br>
[0108] In some embodiments, the soluble Nogo receptor-1<br>
polypeptide of the invention is a component of a fusion<br>
protein that further comprises a heterologous polypeptide.<br>
In some embodiments, the heterologous polypeptide is an<br>
immunoglobulin constant domain. In some embodiments, the<br>
immunoglobulin constant domain is a heavy chain constant<br>
domain. In some embodiments, the heterologous polypeptide<br>
is an Fc fragment. In some embodiments the Fc is joined to<br>
the C-terminal end of the soluble Nogo receptor-1<br>
polypeptide of the invention. In some embodiments the<br>
fusion Nogo receptor-1 protein is a dimer.<br>
Nucleic Acid Molecules of the Present Invention<br>
[0109] The present invention provide a nucleic acid that<br>
encodes a polypeptide of the invention, including the<br>
polypeptides of any one of SEQ ID NOs: 1-9. In some<br>
embodiments, the nucleic acid encodes a polypeptide selected<br>
from the group consisting of amino acid residues 26-344 of<br>
Nogo receptor-l as shown in SEQ ID NOs: 6 and 8 or amino<br>
acid residues 27-344 of Nogo receptor-1 as shown in SEQ ID<br>
NO: 8. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid molecule<br>
encodes a polypeptide selected from the group consisting of<br>
amino acid residues 26-310 of Nogo receptor-1 as shown in<br>
SEQ ID NOs: 7 and 9 or amino acid residues 27-310 of Nogo<br>
receptor-1 as shown in SEQ ID NO: 9. As used herein,<br>
"nucleic acid" means genomic DNA, cDNA, mRNA and antisense<br>
molecules, as well as nucleic acids based on alternative<br>
backbones or including alternative bases whether derived<br>
from natural sources or synthesized. In some embodiments,<br>
the nucleic acid further comprises a transcriptional<br>
promoter and optionally a signal sequence each of which is<br>
operably linked to the nucleotide sequence encoding the<br>
polypeptides of the invention.<br>
[0110] In some embodiments, the invention provides a<br>
nucleic acid encoding a Nogo receptor-1 fusion protein of<br>
the invention. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid<br>
encodes a Nogo receptor-1 fusion protein of the invention,<br>
including a fusion protein comprising a polypeptide selected<br>
from the group consisting of amino acid residues 26-344 of<br>
Nogo receptor-1 as shown in SEQ ID NOs: 6 and 8 or amino<br>
acid residues 27-344 of SEQ ID NO: 8 and amino acid residues<br>
26-310 of Nogo receptor-1 as shown in SEQ ID NOs: 7 and 9 or<br>
amino acid residues 2 7-310 of SEQ ID NO: 9. In some<br>
embodiments, the nucleic acid encoding a Nogo receptor-1<br>
fusion protein further comprises a transcriptional promoter<br>
and optionally a signal sequence. In some embodiments, the<br>
nucleotide sequence further encodes an immunoglobulin<br>
constant region. In some embodiments, the immunoglobulin<br>
constant region is a heavy chain constant region. In some<br>
embodiments, the nucleotide sequence further encodes an<br>
immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region joined to a hinge<br>
region. In some embodiments the nucleic acid further<br>
encodes Fc. In some embodiments the Nogo receptor-1 fusion<br>
proteins comprise an Fc fragment.<br>
[0111] The encoding nucleic acids of the present<br>
invention may further be modified so as to contain a<br>
detectable label for diagnostic and probe purposes. A<br>
variety of such labels are known in the art and can readily<br>
be employed with the encoding molecules herein described.<br>
Suitable labels include, but are not limited to, biotin,<br>
radiolabeled nucleotides and the like. A skilled artisan<br>
can employ any of the art known labels to obtain a labeled<br>
encoding nucleic acid molecule.<br>
Compositions<br>
[0112] In some embodiments, the invention provides<br>
compositions comprising an immunogenic polypeptide selected<br>
from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ<br>
ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4 and SEQ ID NO: 5.<br>
[0113] In some embodiments, the invention provides<br>
compositions comprising an anti-Nogo receptor-1 antibody or<br>
an antigen-binding fragment thereof, or a soluble Nogo<br>
receptor-1 polypeptide or fusion protein of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[0114] In some embodiments, the present invention may<br>
contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers<br>
comprising excipients and auxiliaries which facilitate<br>
processing of the active compounds into preparations which<br>
can be used pharmaceutically for delivery to the site of<br>
action. Suitable formulations for paienteral administration<br>
include aqueous solutions of the active compounds in water-<br>
soluble form, for example, water-soluble salts. In<br>
addition, suspensions of the active compounds as appropriate<br>
oily injection suspensions may be administered. Suitable<br>
lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils, for<br>
example, sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, for<br>
example, ethyl oleate or triglycerides. Aqueous injection<br>
suspensions may contain substances which increase the<br>
viscosity of the suspension include, for example, sodium<br>
carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol and dextran. Optionally,<br>
the suspension may also contain stabilizers. Liposoraes can<br>
also be used to encapsulate the molecules of this invention<br>
for delivery into the cell. Exemplary "pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carriers" are any and all solvents, dispersion<br>
media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents,<br>
isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like that<br>
are physiologically compatible, water, saline, phosphate<br>
buffered saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol and the like,<br>
as well as combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the<br>
composition comprises isotonic agents, for example, sugars,<br>
polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, or sodium chloride.<br>
In some embodiments, the compositions comprise<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable substances such as wetting or<br>
minor amounts of auxiliary substances such as wetting or<br>
emulsifying agents, preservatives or buffers, which enhance<br>
the shelf life or effectiveness of the antibodies, antigen-<br>
binding fragments, soluble Nogo receptors or fusion proteins<br>
of the invention.<br>
[0115] Compositions of the invention may be in a variety<br>
of forms, including, for example, liquid, semi-solid and<br>
solid dosage forms, such as liquid solutions {e.g.,<br>
injectable and infusible solutions), dispersions or<br>
suspensions. The preferred form depends on the intended<br>
mode of administration and therapeutic application. In one<br>
embodiment, compositions are in the form of injectable or<br>
infusible solutions, such as compositions similar to those<br>
used for passive immunization of humans with other<br>
 antibodies.<br>
[0116] The composition can be formulated as a solution,<br>
micro emulsion, dispersion, liposome, or other ordered<br>
structure suitable to high drug concentration. Sterile<br>
injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the<br>
anti-Nogo receptor-1 antibody in the required amount in an<br>
appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients<br>
enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered<br>
sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by<br>
incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle<br>
that contains a basic dispersion medium and the required<br>
other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case<br>
of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable<br>
solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum<br>
drying and freeze-drying that yields a powder of the active<br>
ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a<br>
previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. The proper<br>
fluidity of a solution can be maintained, for example, by<br>
the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of<br>
the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by<br>
the use of surfactants. Prolonged absorption of injectable<br>
compositions can be brought about by including in the<br>
composition an agent that delays absorption, for example,<br>
monostearate salts and gelatin.<br>
[0117] In some embodiments, the active compound may be<br>
prepared with a carrier that will protect the compound<br>
against rapid release, such as a controlled release<br>
formulation, including implants, transdermal patches, and<br>
microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable,<br>
biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl<br>
acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen,<br>
polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Many methods for the<br>
preparation of such formulations are patented or generally<br>
known to those skilled in the art. See e.g., Sustained and<br>
Controlled Release Drug Delivery Systems, J. R. Robinson,<br>
ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1978.<br>
[0118] Supplementary active compounds also can be<br>
incorporated into the compositions. In some embodiments, a<br>
Nogo receptor-1 antibody or an antigen-binding fragments<br>
thereof, or soluble Nogo receptor-1 polypeptides or fusion<br>
proteins of the invention are coformulated with and/or<br>
coadministered. with one or more additional therapeutic<br>
agents.<br>
[0119] The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention<br>
may include a "therapeutically effective amount" or a<br>
"prophylactically effective amount" of an antibody, antigen-<br>
binding fragment, polypeptide(s), or fusion protein of the<br>
invention. A "therapeutically effective amount" refers to<br>
an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time<br>
necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic result. A<br>
therapeutically effective amount of the Nogo receptor-1<br>
antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof, soluble Nogo<br>
receptor-1 polypeptide or Nogo receptor fusion protein may<br>
vary according to factors such as the disease state, age,<br>
sex, and weight of the individual. A therapeutically<br>
effective amount is also one in which any toxic or<br>
detrimental effects of the antibody, antigen-binding<br>
fragment, soluble Nogo receptor-1 polypeptide or Nogo<br>
receptor fusion protein are outweighed by the<br>
therapeutically beneficial effects. A "prophylactically<br>
effective amount" refers to an amount effective, at dosages<br>
and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired<br>
prophylactic result. Typically, since a prophylactic dose is<br>
used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease,<br>
the prophylactically effective amount will be less than the<br>
therapeutically effective amount.<br>
[0120] Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the<br>
optimum desired response (e.g., a therapeutic or<br>
prophylactic response). For example, a single bolus may be<br>
administered, several divided doses may be administered over<br>
time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased<br>
as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral<br>
compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration<br>
and uniformity of dosage unit form as used herein refers to<br>
physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the<br>
mammalian subjects to be treated, each unit containing a<br>
predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to<br>
produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with<br>
the required pharmaceutical carrier". The specification for<br>
the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and<br>
directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the<br>
antibody, antigen-binding fragment, and soluble receptor-1<br>
polypeptide or Nogo receptor fusion protein and the<br>
particular therapeutic or prophylactic effect to be<br>
achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of<br>
compounding such an antibody, antigen-binding fragment, and<br>
soluble receptor-1 polypeptide or Nogo receptor fusion<br>
protein for the treatment of sensitivity in individuals. In<br>
some embodiments a therapeutically effective dose range for<br>
Nogo receptor-1 antibodies or antigen-binding fragments<br>
thereof is 0.1 - 4 mg/Kg per day. In some embodiments a<br>
therapeutically effective dose range for Nogo receptor-.1<br>
antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof is 0.2 - 4<br>
mg/Kg per day. In some embodiments a therapeutically<br>
effective dose range for Nogo receptor-1 antibodies or<br>
antigen-binding fragments thereof is 0.2 mg/Kg per day.<br>

[0126] In some embodiments, the invention provides a<br>

[0129] Any of the types of antibodies or receptors<br>
described herein may be used therapeutically. In some<br>
embodiments, the anti-Nogo receptor-1 antibody is a human<br>

mammal expressing a Nogo receptor-1 with which the antibody<br>
cross-reacts (e.g., a primate, cynomologous or rhesus<br>
monkey) for veterinary purposes or as an animal model of<br>

evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of antibodies of this<br>
invention.<br>
[0130] In some embodiments, administration of anti-Nogo<br>
receptor-1 antibody or antigen-binding fragment, or soluble<br>
Nogo receptor-1 polypeptide or fusion protein is used to<br>
treat a spinal cord injury to facilitate axonal growth<br>
throughout the injured site.<br>
[0131] The anti-Nogo receptor-1 antibodies or antigen-<br>
binding fragments, or soluble Nogo receptor-1 polypeptides<br>
or fusion proteins of the present invention can be provided<br>
alone, or in combination, or in sequential combination with<br>
other agents that modulate a particular pathological<br>
process., For example, anti-inflammatory agents may be co-<br>
administered following stroke as a means for blocking<br>
further neuronal damage and inhibition of axonal<br>
regeneration. As used herein, the Nogo receptor-1<br>
antibodies, antigen-binding fragments, soluble Nogo<br>
receptor-1 and Nogo receptor fusion proteins, are said to be<br>
administered in combination with one or more additional<br>
therapeutic agents when the two are administered<br>
simultaneously, consecutively or independently.<br>
[0132] The anti-Nogo receptor-1 antibodies, antigen-<br>
binding fragments, soluble Nogo receptor-1 polypeptides,<br>
Nogo receptor-1 fusion proteins of the present invention can<br>
be administered via parenteral, subcutaneous, intravenous,<br>
intramuscular, intraperitoneal, transdermal, inhalational or<br>
buccal routes. For example, an agent may be administered<br>
locally to a site of injury via microinfusion. Typical<br>
sites include, but are not limited to, damaged areas of the<br>
spinal cord resulting from injury. The dosage administered<br>
will be dependent upon the age, health, and weight of the<br>
recipient, kind of concurrent treatment, if any, frequency<br>
of treatment, and the nature of the effect desired.<br>
[0133] The compounds of this invention can be utilised in<br>
vivo, ordinarily in mammals, such as humans, sheep, horses,<br>
cattle, pigs, dogs, cats, rats and mice, or in vitro.<br>
Vectors of the Invention<br>
[0134] In some embodiments, the invention provides<br>
recombinant DNA molecules (rDNA) that contain a coding<br>
sequence. As used herein, a rDNA molecule is a DNA molecule<br>
that has been subjected to molecular manipulation. Methods<br>
for generating rDNA molecules are well known in the art, for<br>
example, see Sambrook et al., (1989) Molecular Cloning - A<br>
Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. In<br>
some rDNA molecules, a coding DNA sequence is operably<br>
linked to expression control sequences and vector sequences.<br>
[0135] In some embodiments, the invention provides<br>
vectors comprising the nucleic acids encoding the<br>
polypeptides of the invention. The choice of vector and<br>
expression control sequences to which the nucleic acids of<br>
this invention is operably linked depends directly, as is<br>
well known in the art, on the functional properties desired<br>
(e.g., protein expression, and the host cell to be<br>
transformed). A vector of the present invention may be at<br>
least capable of directing the replication or insertion into<br>
the host chromosome, and preferably also expression, of the<br>
structural gene included in the rDNA molecule.<br>
[013 6] Expression control elements that are used for<br>
regulating the expression of an operably linked protein<br>
encoding sequence are known in the art and include, but are<br>
not limited to, inducible promoters, constitutive promoters,<br>
secretion signals, and other regulatory elements.<br>
Preferably, the inducible promoter is readily controlled,<br>
such as being responsive to a nutrient in the host cell's<br>
medium.<br>
[0137] In one embodiment, the vector containing a coding<br>
nucleic acid molecule will include a prokaryotic replicon,<br>
i.e., a DNA sequence having the ability to direct autonomous<br>
replication and maintenance of the recombinant DNA molecule<br>
extra-chromosomally in a prokaryotic host cell, such as a<br>
bacterial host cell, transformed therewith. Such replicons<br>
are well known in the art. In addition, vectors that<br>
include a prokaryotic replicon may also include a gene whose<br>
expression confers a detectable or selectable marker such as<br>
a drug resistance. Typical of bacterial drug resistance<br>
genes are those that confer resistance to ampicillin or<br>
tetracycline.<br>
[0138] Vectors that include a prokaryotic replicon can<br>
further include a prokaryotic or bacteriophage promoter<br>
capable of directing the expression (transcription and<br>
translation) of the coding gene sequences in a bacterial<br>
host cell, such as E. coli. A promoter is an expression<br>
control element formed by a DNA sequence that permits<br>
binding of RNA polymerase and transcription to occur.<br>
Promoter sequences compatible with bacterial hosts are<br>
typically provided in plasmid vectors containing convenient<br>
restriction sites for insertion of a DNA segment of the<br>
present invention. Examples of such vector plasmids are<br>
pUC8, pUC9, pBR322 andpBR329 (Bio-Rad® Laboratories), pPL<br>
and pKK223 (Pharmacia) . Any suitable prokaryotic host can<br>
be used to express a recombinant DNA molecule encoding a<br>
protein of the invention.<br>
[0139] Expression vectors compatible with eukaryotic<br>
cells, preferably those compatible with vertebrate cells,<br>
can also be used to form a rDNA molecules that contains a<br>
coding sequence. Eukaryotic cell expression vectors are<br>
well known in the art and are available from several<br>
commercial sources. Typically, such vectors are provided<br>
containing convenient restriction sites for insertion of the<br>
desired DNA segment. Examples of such vectors are pSVL and<br>
pKSV-10 (Pharmacia), pBPV-1, pML2d (International<br>
Biotechnologies), pTDTl (ATCC® 31255) and other eukaryotic<br>
expression vectors.<br>
[0140] Eukaryotic cell expression vectors used to<br>
construct the rDNA molecules of the present invention may<br>
further include a selectable marker that is effective in an<br>
eukaryotic cell, preferably a drug resistance selection<br>
marker. A preferred drug resistance marker is the gene<br>
whose expression results in neomycin resistance, i.e., the<br>
neomycin phosphotransferase (neo) gene. (Southern et al.,<br>
(1982) J. Mol. Anal. Genet. 1, 327-341). Alternatively, the<br>
selectable marker can be present on a separate plasmid, the<br>
two vectors introduced by co-transfection of the host cell,<br>
and transfectants selected by culturing in the appropriate<br>
drug for the selectable marker.<br>
[0141] To express the antibodies, or antibody portions of<br>
the invention, DNAs encoding partial or full-length light<br>
and heavy chains are inserted into expression vectors such<br>
that the genes are operatively linked to transcriptional and<br>
translational control sequences. Expression vectors include<br>
plasmids, retroviruses, cosmids, YACs, EBV-derived episomes,<br>
and the like. The antibody gene is ligated into a vector<br>
such that transcriptional and translational control<br>
sequences within the vector serve their intended function of<br>
regulating the transcription and translation of the antibody<br>
gene. The expression vector and expression control<br>
sequences are chosen to be compatible with the expression<br>
host cell used. The antibody light chain gene and the<br>
antibody heavy chain gene can be inserted into separate<br>
vectors. In some embodiments, both genes are inserted into<br>
the same expression vector. The antibody genes are inserted<br>
into the expression vector by standard methods (e.g.,<br>
ligation of complementary restriction sites on the antibody<br>
gene fragment and vector, or blunt end ligation if no<br>
restriction sites are present).<br>
[0142] A convenient vector is one that encodes a<br>
functionally complete human CH or CL immunoglobulin<br>
sequence, with appropriate restriction sites engineered so<br>
that any VH or VL sequence can be easily inserted and<br>
expressed, as described above. In such vectors, splicing<br>
usually occurs between the splice donor site in the inserted<br>
J region and the splice acceptor site preceding the human C<br>
region, and also at the splice regions that occur within the<br>
human CH exons. Polyadenylation and transcription<br>
termination occur at native chromosomal sites downstream of<br>
the coding regions. The recombinant expression vector can<br>
also encode a signal peptide that facilitates secretion of<br>
the antibody chain from a host cell. The antibody chain<br>
gene may be cloned into the vector such that the signal<br>
peptide is linked in-frame to the amino terminus of the<br>
antibody chain gene. The signal peptide can be an<br>
immunoglobulin signal peptide or a heterologous signal<br>
peptide (i.e., a signal peptide from a non-immunoglobulin<br>
protein).<br>
[0143] In addition to the immunogenic polypeptides, Nogo<br>
receptor-1 antibodies, antigen-binding fragments, soluble<br>
Nogo receptor-1 polypeptides and soluble Nogo receptor-l<br>
fusion protein of the present invention, the recombinant<br>
 expression vectors of the invention carry regulatory<br>
sequences that control their expression in a host cell. It<br>
will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the<br>
design of the expression vector, including the selection of<br>
regulatory sequences may depend on such factors as the<br>
choice of the host cell to be transformed, the level of<br>
expression of protein desired, etc. Preferred regulatory<br>
sequences for mammalian host cell expression include viral<br>
elements that direct high levels of protein expression in<br>
mammalian cells, such as promoters and/or enhancers derived<br>
from retroviral LTRs, cytomegalovirus (CMV) (such as the CMV<br>
promoter/enhancer), Simian Virus 40 (SV40) (such as the SV40<br>
promoter/enhancer), adenovirus, {e.g., the adenovirus major<br>
late promoter (AdMLP)), poiyoma and strong mammalian<br>
promoters such as native immunoglobulin and actin promoters.<br>
For further description of viral regulatory elements, and<br>
sequences thereof, see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,168,062 by<br>
Stinski, U.S. Pat. No. 4,510,245 by Bell et al. and U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 4,968,615 by Schaffner et al.<br>
[0144] In addition to the heterologous genes and<br>
regulatory sequences, the recombinant expression vectors of<br>
the invention may carry additional sequences, such as<br>
sequences that regulate replication of the vector in host<br>
cells (e.g., origins of replication) and selectable marker<br>
genes. The selectable marker gene facilitates selection of<br>
host cells into which the vector has been introduced (see<br>
e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,399,216, 4,634,665 and 5,179,017, all<br>
by Axel et al.). For example, typically the selectable<br>
marker gene confers resistance to drugs, such as G418,<br>
hygromycin or methotrexate, on a host cell into which the<br>
vector has been introduced. Preferred selectable marker<br>
genes include the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene (for<br>
use in dhfr" host cells with methotrexate<br>
selection/amplification) and the neo gene (for G418<br>
selection).<br>
Host Cells and Methods of Recombinantly Producing Protein of<br>
the Invention<br>
[0145] Nucleic acid molecules encoding anti-Nogo<br>
receptor-1 antibodies, immunogenic peptides, soluble Nogo<br>
receptor-1 polypeptides, soluble Nogo receptor-1 fusion<br>
proteins of this invention and vectors comprising these<br>
nucleic acid molecules can be used for transformation of a<br>
suitable host cell. Transformation can be by any known<br>
method for introducing polynucleotides into a host cell.<br>
Methods for introduction of heterologous polynucleotides<br>
into mammalian cells are well known in the art and include<br>
dextran-mediated transfection, calcium phosphate<br>
precipitation, polybrene-mediated transfection, protoplast<br>
fusion, electroporation, encapsulation of the<br>
polynucleotide(s) in liposomes, and direct microinjection of<br>
the DNA into nuclei. In addition, nucleic acid molecules<br>
may be introduced into mammalian cells by viral vectors.<br>
[0146] Transformation of appropriate cell hosts with a<br>
rDNA molecule of the present invention is accomplished by<br>
well known methods that typically depend on the type of<br>
vector used and host system employed. With regard to<br>
transformation of prokaryotic host cells, electroporation<br>
and salt treatment methods can be employed (see, for<br>
example, Sambrook et al., (1989) Molecular Cloning - A<br>
Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press;<br>
Cohen et al., (1972) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 69, 2110-<br>
2114). With regard to transformation of vertebrate cells<br>
with vectors containing rDNA, electroporation, cationic<br>
lipid or salt treatment methods can be employed (see, for<br>
example, Graham et al., (1973) Virology 52, 456-467; Wigler<br>
et al., (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 76, 1373-1376).<br>
[0147] Successfully transformed cells, i.e., cells that<br>
contain a rDNA molecule of the present invention, can be<br>
identified by well known techniques including the selection<br>
for a selectable marker. For example, cells resulting from<br>
the introduction of an rDNA of the present invention can be<br>
cloned to produce single colonies. Cells from those<br>
colonies can be harvested, lysed and their DNA content<br>
examined for the presence of the rDNA using a method such as<br>
that described by Southern, (1975) J. Mol. Biol. 98, 503-517<br>
or the proteins produced from the cell may be assayed by an<br>
immunological method.<br>
[0148] Mammalian cell lines available as hosts for<br>
expression are well known in the art and include many<br>
immortalized cell lines available from the American Type<br>
Culture Collection (ATCC®) . These include, inter alia,<br>
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, NSO, SP2 cells, HeLa<br>
cells, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, monkey kidney cells<br>
(COS), human hepatocelluiar carcinoma cells (e.g., Hep G2) ,<br>
A549 cells, and a number of other cell lines. Cell lines of<br>
particular preference are selected through determining which<br>
cell lines have high expression levels. Other cell lines<br>
that may be used are insect cell lines, such as Sf9 cells.<br>
When recombinant expression vectors encoding the immunogenic<br>
polypeptides, Nogo receptor-1 antibodies or antigen-binding<br>
fragments, soluble Nogo receptor-1 polypeptides and soluble<br>
Nogo receptor-1 fusion proteins of the invention are<br>
introduced into mammalian host cells, they are produced by<br>
culturing the host cells for a period of time sufficient to<br>
allow for expression of the antibody, polypeptide and fusion<br>
polypeptide in the host cells or, more preferably, secretion<br>
of the immunogenic polypeptides, Nogo receptor-1 antibodies<br>
or antigen-binding fragments, soluble Nogo receptor-1<br>
polypeptides and soluble Nogo receptor-1 fusion proteins of<br>
the invention into the culture medium in which the host<br>
cells are grown. Immunogenic polypeptides, Nogo receptor-1<br>
antibodies or antigen-binding fragments, soluble Nogo<br>
receptor-1 polypeptides and soluble Nogo receptor-1 fusion<br>
proteins of the invention can be recovered from the culture<br>
medium using standard protein purification methods.<br>
[0149] Further, expression of immunogenic polypeptides,<br>
Nogo receptor-1 antibodies or antigen-binding fragments,<br>
soluble Nogo receptor-1 polypeptides and soluble Nogo<br>
receptor-1 fusion proteins of the invention of the invention<br>
(or other moieties therefrom) from production cell lines can<br>
be enhanced using a number of known techniques. For<br>
example, the glutamine synthetase gene expression system<br>
(the GS system) is a common approach for enhancing<br>
expression under certain conditions. The GS system is<br>
discussed in whole or part in connection with European<br>
Patent Nos. 0 216 846, 0 256 055, and 0 323 997 and European<br>
Patent Application No. 89303964.4.<br>
Host Cells<br>
[0150] The present invention further provides host cells<br>
transformed with a nucleic acid molecule that encodes a Nogo<br>
receptor-1 antibody, antigen-binding fragment, soluble Nogo<br>
receptor-1 polypeptide and/or soluble Nogo receptor-1 fusion<br>
protein of the invention. The host cell can be either<br>
prokaryotic or eukaryotic. Eukaryotic cells useful for<br>
expression of a protein of the invention are not limited, so<br>
long as the cell line is compatible with cell culture<br>
methods and compatible with the propagation of the<br>
expression vector and expression of the gene product.<br>
Preferred eukaryotic host cells include, but are not limited<br>
to, yeast, insect and mammalian cells, preferably vertebrate<br>
cells such as those from a mouse, rat, monkey or human cell<br>
line. Examples of useful eukaryotic host cells include<br>
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells available from the ATCC®<br>
as CCL61, NIH Swiss mouse embryo cells NIH-3T3 available<br>
from the ATCC as CRL1658, baby hamster kidney cells (BHK),<br>
and the like eukaryotic tissue culture cell lines.<br>
Production of Recombinant Proteins using a rDNA Molecule<br>
[0151] The present invention further provides methods for<br>
producing an a Nogo receptor-1 antibody or antigen-binding<br>
fragment, soluble Nogo receptor-1 polypeptide and/or soluble<br>
Nogo receptor-1 fusion protein of the invention using<br>
nucleic acid molecules herein described. In general terms,<br>
the production of a recombinant form of a protein typically<br>
involves the following steps:<br>
[0152] First, a nucleic acid molecule is obtained that<br>
encodes a protein of the invention. If the encoding<br>
sequence is uninterrupted by introns, it is directly<br>
suitable for expression in any host.<br>
[0153] The nucleic acid molecule is then optionally<br>
placed in operable linkage with suitable control sequences,<br>
as described above, to form an expression unit containing<br>
the protein open reading frame. The expression unit is used<br>
to transform a suitable host and the transformed host is<br>
cultured under conditions that allow the production of the<br>
recombinant protein. Optionally the recombinant protein is<br>
isolated from the medium or from the cells; recovery and<br>
purification of the protein may not be necessary in some<br>
instances where some impurities may be tolerated.<br>
[0154] Each of the foregoing steps can be done in a<br>
variety of ways. For example, the desired coding sequences<br>
may be obtained from genomic fx-agments and used directly in<br>
appropriate hosts. The construction of expression vectors<br>
that are operable in a variety of hosts is accomplished<br>
using appropriate replicons and control sequences, as set<br>
forth above. The control sequences, expression vectors, and<br>
transformation methods are dependent on the type of host<br>
cell used to express the gene and were discussed in detail<br>
earlier. Suitable restriction sites can, if not normally<br>
available, be added to the ends of the coding sequence so as<br>
to provide an excisable gene to insert into these vectors.<br>
A skilled artisan can readily adapt any host/expression<br>
system known in the art for use with the nucleic acid<br>
molecules of the invention to produce recombinant protein.<br>
[01553 In order that this invention may be better<br>
understood, the following examples are set forth. These<br>
examples are for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
7<br>
to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in<br>
any manner.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Production of Murine Monoclonal<br>
Anti-Nogo Receptor-1 Antibodies<br>
[0156] Anti-Nogo receptor-1 antibodies that specifically<br>
bind an immunogenic Nogo receptor-1 polypeptide of the<br>
invention were made using the following methods and<br>
procedures.<br>
Immunizations<br>
[0157] Two immunization approaches were used:<br>
1. COS-7 Cells or Cell Membranes Containing Nogo receptor-<br>
1 (NogoR-1) As the Immunogen<br>
[0158] The rat Nogo receptor-1 gene (GenBank™ No. AF<br>
462390) was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector<br>
pEAG1256 (Biogen®) that contained the CMV promotor and<br>
geneticin resistance gene for drug selection. The<br>
recombinant plasmid was transfected into COS-7 cells using<br>
Superfect (Qiagen®) . Transfectants were selected using<br>
geneticin (Gibco , 2 mg/ml), cloned and verified for surface<br>
expression of Nogo receptor-1 protein by FACS. COS-7<br>
membranes were prepared from these cells according to<br>
procedures as described [Wang et al., J. Neurochem.,75:1155-<br>
1161 (2000)] with two washings, and stored at 1 mg/ml<br>
[protein concentration] in 10% glycerol at -70°C.<br>
[0159] Eight-week-old female RBF mice (Jackson Labs, Bar<br>
Harbor, ME) were immunized intraperitoneally either with an<br>
emulsion containing 50 mg rat Nogo receptor-1-COS-7<br>
membranes or whole COS-7 cells expressing Nogo receptor-1 on<br>
the surface and 50 ml RIBI MPL+TDM+CWS adjuvant (Sigma®<br>
Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) once every two weeks (Lipman et<br>
al. , 1992). Sera from the immunized mice were collected<br>
before the first immunization, 7 days after the second and<br>
third immunizations, and 3 8 days after the third<br>
immunization and the anti-Nogo receptor-1 antibody titers<br>
were measured by ELISA as described below.<br>
2. Specific Nogo receptor-1 Peptides as the Immunogen<br>
[0160] The rat Nogo receptor-1 gene sequence was<br>
subjected to antigenicity analyses using Vector NTi<br>
software (Fig. 2). Antigenic peptides identified in the<br>
analyses were conjugated to Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH)<br>
using standard glutaldehyde procedures.<br>
[0161] Eight-week-old female RBF mice (Jackson Labs, Bar<br>
Harbor, ME) were immunized intraperitoneally with an<br>
emulsion containing 50 mg KLH-conjugated peptides and 50 ml<br>
-complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma® Chemical Co., St. Louis,<br>
MO) once every two weeks. Serum from the immunized mice was<br>
collected before the first immunization and 1 week after the<br>
second and third immunizations and anti-Nogo receptor-1<br>
antibody titers were measured. A booster dose was given<br>
after the: third immunization. Three days after this booster<br>
dose immunization, fusion experiments were initiated.<br>
Hybridoma production and screening<br>
[0162] Sera from mice immunised with antigenic Nogo<br>
receptor-1 peptides were screened by ELISA whereas sera from<br>
mice immunized with COS-7 cells expressing Nogo receptor-1<br>
were screened by flow cytometry. Mice that were positive<br>
for antibodies that specifically bound Nogo receptor-l-COS-7<br>
cells were identified by flow cytometry and were sacrificed.<br>
Splenocytes were isolated from the mice and fused to the<br>
FL653 myeloma (an APRT- derivative of a Ig-/HGPRT- Balb/c<br>
mouse myeloma, maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 450 0<br>
mg/L glucose, 4 mM L-glutamine, and 2 0 mg/ml 8-azaguanine)<br>
as described (Kennett et al., 1993, Monoclonal Antibodies:<br>
A New Dimension in Biological Analysis. Plenum Press, New<br>
York). Fused cells were plated into 24- or 48-well plates<br>
(Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY) , and fed with adenine,<br>
aminopterin and thymidine containing culture media. AAT<br>
resistant cultures were screened by ELISA. or flow cytometry<br>
for binding to either Nogo receptor-l-COS-7 cells or to a<br>
Nogo receptor-1 antigenic peptide as described below. Cells<br>
in the positive wells were further subcloned by limiting<br>
dilution.<br>
[0163] To screen for antibody binding to a Nogo receptor-<br>
1 antigenic peptide, the peptides that were used as<br>
immunogens were conjugated to BSA. 0.5 mg of the conjugated<br>
peptide in 50 ml of 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.0<br>
was added to each well of a 96-well MaxiSorp™ plate (Nunc™) .<br>
The plate was then incubated at 37°C for 1 hour or 4°C for<br>
16 hours and non-specific binding sites were blocked using<br>
25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 containing 0.1% BSA, 0.1% ovalbumin,<br>
0.1% blotto and 0.001% azide. Hybridoma supernatant was<br>
added and incubated at 25°C for 1 hour. After washing three<br>
times with PBS, 50 ml of a 1:10,000 dilution of horseradish<br>
peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody<br>
{Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc.) was added to each well and<br>
incubated further for 1 hour. After three washings, color<br>
was developed by TMB (Pierce) and stopped with 2 M sulphuric<br>
acid. Color intensity was monitored in a spectrophotometer<br>
at 450 ran.<br>
[0164] Antibodies were screened for binding to full<br>
length Nogo receptor-l as follows. COS-7 cells were labeled<br>
with 0.1 mM CellTracker Green CMFDA (Molecular Probes,<br>
Eugene, OR) as described by the vendor. Equal volumes of<br>
CellTracker'" labeled control cells were mixed with washed<br>
Nogo receptor-l-COS-7 cells before incubation with anti-Nogo<br>
receptor-1 test sera. Fifty microliters of the cell mixture<br>
was dispensed into each well of a 96-well V-bottom<br>
polystyrene plates (Costar® 3877, Corning, NY) and 100 ul of<br>
hybridoma supernatant or a control anti-Nogo receptor-1<br>
antibody was added. After incubation at 4°C for 30 minutes,<br>
the cells were washed and incubated with 50 ml of R-<br>
phycoerythrin-conjugated affinity pure F(ab')2 fragment goat<br>
anti-mouse IgG Fc gamma specific second antibody (1:200,<br>
Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory, West Grove, PA) in PBS.<br>
At the end of the incubation, the cells were washed twice<br>
with PBS and suspended in 200 ml of PBS containing 1% FBS,<br>
and subjected to FACS analyses. Alternately, Nogo receptor-<br>
l-COS-7 cells were mixed with hybridoma supernatant and then<br>
treated with R-phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse<br>
secondary antibody and directly subjected to standard FACS<br>
analyses.<br>
[0165] We generated 25 anti-Nogo receptor-1 antibodies<br>
using a variety of immunogens. We generated two antibodies,<br>
7E11 and 5B10, using a peptide sequence corresponding to rat<br>
Nogo receptor-1 residues 110-125 as the immunogen. We<br>
generated three antibodies, 1H2, 3G5 and 2F7, using<br>
membranes prepared from COS7 cells transfected with full<br>
length rat Nogo receptor-1 as the immunogen. We generated<br>
13 antibodies using sNogoR310-Fc as the immunogen (1D9.3,<br>
1E4.7, 1B4.3, 2C4.3, 1F10.3, 2H1.4, 1H3.3, 1G4.1, 1E4.1,<br>
2G7.1, 2C4.1, 2F11.1, and 1H4.1) and 7 antibodies using a<br>
peptide sequence corresponding to rat Nogo receptor-1<br>
residues 423-434 as the immunogen (2E8.1, 2G11.2, and<br>
1B5.1).<br>
Sequence Analysis of Monoclonal Antibodies 7E11 and 5B10<br>
[0166] We extracted total RNA using Qiagen® RNeasy® mini<br>
kit, and generated cDNA from the isolated RNA. We amplified<br>
the light chain sequence by PCR using primers 5'-<br>
TGAGGAGACGGTGACCGTGGTCCCTTGGCCCCAG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 12) and<br>
5'-AGGTSMARCTGCAGSAGTCWGG-3' . We amplified the heavy chain<br>
sequence by PCR using primers 5'-<br>
GGGGATATCCACCATGAAGTTGCCTGTTAGGCTGTTG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 13) and<br>
5'-GGGGATATCCACCATGAGGKCCCCWGCTCAGYTYCTKGGA-3' (SEQ ID NO:<br>
14). These primers comprise degenerate nucleotides as<br>
follows: S represents G or C; M represents A or C, R<br>
represents G or A; W represents A or T; K represents G or T;<br>
and Y represents T or C. We cloned the PCR fragments into a<br>
sequencing vector and determined the DNA sequence of the<br>
CDRs by dideoxychain termination using primers specific for<br>
the sequencing vector. We conceptually translated the DNA<br>
sequences and partial amino acid sequences of the CDR<br>
regions of the heavy of light chains of the monoclonal<br>
antibodies 7E11 and 5B10 are shown in Table 2. The 3 CDRs<br>
from the heavy and light chains of the mAbs are underlined<br>
in Table 2. The light chains of 7E11 and 5B10 are have 94%<br>
amino acid sequence identity and the heavy chains have 91%<br>
amino acid sequence identity. mAbs 7E11, 5B10, and 1H2 are<br>
of the IgGl isotype and mAbs 3G5 and 2F7 are of the IgG2a<br>
isotype. Each of these five mAbs has a light chain of the<br>
kappa isotype. We analyze the sequence of the other<br>
monoclonal antibodies by this approach.<br>
Inhibition of Ligand Binding to Soluble Nogo receptor-1 by<br>
Monoclonal anti-Nogo receptor-1 antibody<br>
[0167] We tested the anti-Nogo receptor-1 monoclonal<br>
antibodies produced as described above to determine whether<br>
they inhibited ligand binding to Nogo receptor-1.<br>
[0168] 0.5 mg of a soluble Nogo receptor-1 fusion<br>
protein comprising amino acid residues 26-344 of rat Nogo<br>
receptor-1 and the hinge and Fc region of the rat IgGl<br>
molecule (sNogoR344-Fc) produced as described below was<br>
immobilized on 2 50 mg of protein-A- or wheatgerm agglutinin-<br>
conjugated SPA beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2<br>
hours at 250C. SPA beads coupled with Fc-sNogoR-1 [WHICH<br>
sNOGO IS THIS?] , anti-Nogo receptor-1 mAb and lul 125I-Nogo66<br>
(Amersham, 2000 Ci/mmol, 1nM) in 50 ml of the HEPES-buffered<br>
incubation medium (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum<br>
albumin, 0.1% ovalbumin, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2 and protease<br>
inhibitors) was added to each sample well. After 16 hours,<br>
radioactivity was measured in quadruplicate samples using a<br>
TopCount® (Packard). IC50 values were calculated from a<br>
curve-fit analysis (Fig. 3) (PRISM, GraphPad Software, NJ).<br>
In some experiments, we also used AP-ligand conjugates (e.g.<br>
AP-Nogo66) and detected binding by monitoring alkaline<br>
phosphatase activity. We also assayed the ability of the<br>
mAbs to block binding of the ligands MAG-Fc and AP-OM-gp to<br>
Nogo receptor-1.<br>
[0169] Monoclonal antibodies 7E11, 5B10, 1H2, 3G5 and 2F7<br>
all inhibited binding of Nogo66, MAG and OM-gp to sNogoR344-<br>
Fc. The calculated IC50 for Nogo66 for 7E11 and 1H2 were<br>
400 nM and 60 nM, respectively. The data from ELISAs<br>
monitoring mAb-mediated inhibition of binding of the three<br>
ligands to Nogo receptor-1 are summarized in Table 3.<br>

EXAMPLE 2<br>
Production of Fab-Phage<br>
Anti-Nogo Receptor-1 Antibodies<br>
[0170] Anti-Nogo receptor-1 Fab-phage antibodies that<br>
specifically bind an immunogenic Nogo receptor-1 polypeptide<br>
of the invention were also made by screening a Fab-phage<br>
library as follows.<br>
[0171] The MorphoSys Fab-phage library HuCAL® GOLD was<br>
screened against recombinant rat soluble sNogoR310-Fc<br>
protein and COS7 cells expressing rat Nogo receptor-1. Fab-<br>
phages that specifically bound to Nogo receptor-1 were<br>
purified and characterised. The heavy chain of 14D5 is<br>
derived from the VH2 gene and the light chain is derived<br>
from the VK1 gene. The amino acid sequences of the CDRs of<br>
the heavy chain and light chain of one of these Fab-phages,<br>
14D5, are shown in Table 4.<br>
[0172] 14D5 binds to rat Nogo receptor-1 in both<br>
monovalent and bivalent forms. In addition, 14D5 binds to<br>
mouse and human Nogo receptor-1 and human Nogo receptor-2<br>
but not mouse Nogo receptor-3.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Immunoprecipitation of Nogo receptor-1 by Anti- Nogo<br>
receptor-1 Monoclonal Antibodies<br>
[0173] To perform the immunoprecipitation, 100 m1 lysed<br>
cells or 50 ml PiPLC treated cells were mixed with 400 or<br>
450 |il extraction buffer [10 mM Tria-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.5%<br>
Tween-2 0™, 0.2 mM PMSF] or RIPA buffer, respectively in the<br>
presence of 3 0 ml Protein A or G and 1-2 mg antibody. The<br>
mixture was incubated in a shaker at 4°C for 16 hours.<br>
[0174] Samples were spun gently to pellet the protein A<br>
or G coupled beads. The beads were washed three times with<br>
1 ml wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.1% Tween-20m) .<br>
The final wash was performed using 10% of original wash<br>
buffer.<br>
[0175] Beads were resuspended in 100 ml of 2X SDS with<br>
10% beta-mercaptoethanol. Samples were incubated at room<br>
temperature before being run on a 4-2 0% Tris-Glycine gel for<br>
SDS-PAGE. As determined by SDS-PAGE gel analysis,<br>
monoclonal antibodies, 3G5 and 2F7, immunoprecipitate Nogo<br>
receptor-1.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Determining Antibody Specificity by ELISA<br>
[017 6] To determine the specificity of the monoclonal and<br>
Fab-phage antibodies produced in Examples 1 and 2, we<br>
performed an ELISA using a panel of Nogo receptor-1<br>
polypeptides. The panel consisted of sNogoR310-Fc (a fusion<br>
protein comprising amino acids 26-310 of rat Nogo receptor-1<br>
and a rat Fc fragment), sNogoR344-Fc (see supra),<br>
polypeptide p-617 (SEQ ID NO: 1), polypeptide p-618 (a 19-<br>
amino acid polypeptide from the LRR7 region of rat Nogo<br>
receptor-1; Fig. 2; SEQ ID NO: 25) and polypeptides p-4 (SEQ<br>
ID NO: 26) and p-5 (SEQ ID NO: 27) (polypeptides from the<br>
LRR5 and LRRCT regions of Nogo receptor-1, respectively).<br>
Ovalbumin and BSA were used as controls. As shown in Fig.<br>
4, mAbs 1H2, 3G5 and 2F7 all specifically bound to<br>
sNogoR344-Fc. In similar experiments, those antibodies also<br>
specifically bound a polypeptide consisting of amino acids<br>
310-344 of rat Nogo receptor-1 (SEQ ID NO: 3) and mAbs 7E11<br>
and 5B10 specifically bound polypeptide p-617 (SEQ ID NO:<br>
1) .<br>
[0177] Ten of the antibodies (1D9.3, 1E4.7, 1B4.3, 2C4.3,<br>
1F10.3, 2H1.4, 1K3.3, 1G4.1, 1E4.1, and 2G7.1) from the<br>
sNogoR310-Fc immunisation diplaced each other for binding,<br>
indicating that they recognize a similar or overlapping<br>
epitopes on sNogoR310-Fc. The other three antibodies from<br>
the sNogoR310-Fc immunisation (2C4.1, 2F11.1, and 1H4.1)<br>
recognize different epitopes located in amino acid residues<br>
26-310.<br>
[0178] We also performed ELISA binding assays using the<br>
Fab-phage 14D5. Where AP-Nogo66, AP-OM-gp and MAG-Fc<br>
ligands were allowed to bind to immobilized sNogoR344-Fc, 1<br>
mM 14D5 completely inhibited Nogo and MAG binding. 10mM of<br>
14D5 was required to completely inhibit the binding of OM-gp<br>
to sNogoR344-Fc.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Neurite Outgrowth Assay<br>
[0179] To test the ability of the monoclonal and Fab-<br>
phage antibodies produced above to lessen the inhibitory<br>
effect of CNS myelin on neurons, Lab-Tek® culture slides (4<br>
wells) were coated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-D-lysine (Sigma®).<br>
CNS myelin or PBS was spotted as 3 ml drops. Fluorescent<br>
microspheres (Polysciences) were added to the myelin/PBS to<br>
allow later identification of the drops (Grandpre et al,<br>
Nature 403, 2000). Lab-Tek® slides were then rinsed and<br>
coated with 10 mg/ml laminin (Gibco ) . Dorsal root<br>
ganglions (DRG's) from P3-4 Sprague Dawley rat pups were<br>
dissociated with 1 mg/ml collagenase type 1 (Worthington),<br>
triturated with fire-polished Pasteur pipettes pre-plated to<br>
enrich in neuronal cells and finally plated at 23,000<br>
cells/well on the pre-coated Lab-Tek® culture slides. The<br>
culture medium was F12 containing 5% heat inactivated donor<br>
horse serum, 5% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum and 50<br>
ng/ml mNGF and incubated at 37°C and 5% C02 for 6 hours.<br>
Fifteen mg/ml of mAb 7E11 was added immediately after<br>
plating.<br>
[0180] Slides were fixed for 20 minutes with 4%<br>
paraformaldehyde containing 20% sucrose and stained for the<br>
neuronal marker anti beta-III-tubulin (Covance TUJ1) diluted<br>
1:500. As secondary antibody anti-mouse Alexa Fluor® 594<br>
(Molecular Probes) was diluted 1:300 and slides were<br>
coverslipped with Gel/Mount™ (Bi0medaTM ) . 5x digital images<br>
were acquired with OpenLabTM software and analysed by using<br>
the MetaMorph® software for quantification of neurite<br>
outgrowth.<br>
[0181] MAb 7E11 protected DRG neurons from myelin-<br>
mediated inhibition of neurite outgrowth. (Fig. 5). Similar<br>
results were observed with mAbs 1H2 and 3G5.<br>
[0182] In a neurite outgrowth protection assay where rat<br>
P7 DRG neurons were cultured on a CNS myelin substrate,<br>
bivalent 14D5 also efficiently promoted neurite outgrowth.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Immunohistochemistry with 7E11 on<br>
Cells Transfected with Nogo Receptor-1<br>
[0183] To further characterise the binding properties of<br>
anti-Nogo receptor-1 mAbs produced as described in Example<br>
1, we compared binding to both fixed and live COS-7 or 293<br>
cells expressing rat or human Nogo receptor-1.<br>
Fixed cells:<br>
[0184] Nogo receptor-1 transfected and non-transfected<br>
cells were plated in 8-well Lab-Tek® culture slides, fixed<br>
with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes, blocked with 10%<br>
normal goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 hour. Mab<br>
7E11 was added at 15 mg/ml and 1.5 mg/ml in blocking<br>
solution and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature;<br>
Alexa -conjugated secondary antibody anti-mouse (Molecular<br>
Probes) was incubated at a 1:300 dilution in blocking<br>
solution for 1 hour; DAPI was added at 5 mg/ml to the<br>
secondary antibody to label all nuclei.<br>
Live cells:<br>
[0185] Transfected and non-tx-ansfected cells were plated<br>
in 8 well Lab-Tek® culture slides, blocked with FACS buffer<br>
(containing 4% donor horse serum) for 30 minutes at 4°C,<br>
incubated with 7E11 at 15 mg/ml and 1.5 jig/ml in PACS buffer<br>
for 1 hour at 4°C, rinsed and incubated with secondary-<br>
antibody anti-mouse-Alexa® (1:300 in FACS buffer) for 30<br>
minutes at 4°C.<br>
[0186] Immunohistochemical staining experiments<br>
demonstrated that all of the mAbs bound cells expressing rat<br>
Nogo receptor-1. mAbs 7E11, 2G7.1 and 2C4.1 bound both<br>
fixed and live cells expressing human Nogo receptor-1.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
Mouse Model of Spinal Cord Contusive Injury<br>
[0187] To test the effect of anti-Nogo receptor-1 mAbs<br>
produced in Example 1 on neurons in vivo, we use a mouse<br>
spinal cord contusion injury model.<br>
[0188] Female mice (18-22 g) are treated prophylactically<br>
with analgesic and antibiotic agents. Mice are anesthetized<br>
and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus with vertebral column<br>
fixation under a stereomicroscope. Trauma to the spinal<br>
cord is introduced by a modified version of the weight-drop<br>
method (M. Li et al., Functional role and therapeutic<br>
implications of neuronal caspase-1 and -3 in a mouse model<br>
of traumatic spinal cord injury. Neuroscience Vol. 99, pp.<br>
333-342, 2000) .<br>
[0189] Briefly, a T9 and T10 laminectomy is made and the<br>
vertebral column is stabilized using a pair of mouse<br>
transverse clamps supporting the T9-T10 transverse processes<br>
bilaterally. A stainless steel impact rod with a diameter<br>
of 1.4 mm and weight of 2 g, is raised 2.5 cm above the dura<br>
and dropped onto the spinal cord at the T10 level. During<br>
the surgery, mice are kept on a 37°C warming blanket and 1<br>
ml of warmed sterile saline is administered subcutaneously<br>
to each mouse after surgery to avoid dehydration. The<br>
bladder is manually expressed once daily until reflexive<br>
bladder control is regained.<br>
[0190] All animals receive post-operative analgesia every<br>
8-12 hours after surgery and antibiotic treatment twice<br>
daily for 7 days thereafter. Animals have free access to<br>
food and water for the duration of the study. Anti-Nogo<br>
receptor-1 antibodies are delivered to the injury site via<br>
intrathecal injection for 2 8 days as described in the rat<br>
spinal cord transection model below.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
Characterization of Soluble Nogo receptor-1 Fusion Proteins<br>
[0191] To characterize soluble Nogo receptor-1<br>
polypeptides (sNogoR-1) and fusion proteins (Fc-sNogoR-1) we<br>
performed the following experiment.<br>
[0192] Three ug of soluble Nogo receptors (sNogoR310-Fc<br>
and sNogoR344-Fc) were immobilized on 250 mg WGA-SPA beads<br>
and received 0.5 mL of radioactive ligand (final<br>
concentration 0.5 nM) in a final volume of 100 mL of binding<br>
buffer (20 mM KEPES, pK 7.4, 2 mM Ca, 2 mM Mg, 0.1% BSA,<br>
0.1% ovalubmin and protease inhibitors). Ligands included<br>
10 mM Nogo66, 10 mM 125I-Nogo4 0 (amino acids 1-4 0 of NogoA)<br>
and 10 mL of anti-Nogo receptor-1 antibody supernatant for<br>
each ligand set. The three tyrosines on Nogo40 were<br>
separately iodinated and designated as Nogo4 0-A,-B and -C<br>
respectively. Mean values of triplicates are presented as<br>
normalised % bound radioactivity (Figs. 6, 7 and 8). Error<br>
bars indicate SEM. Bound radioactivity in the absence of<br>
inhibitors was taken as 100% and the lowest bound<br>
radioactivity in the presence of 10 mM Nogo4 0 was taken as<br>
the 0% for data normalization.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
Inhibition of Ligand Binding to<br>
Soluble Nogo receptor-1 Fusion Protein<br>
[0193] A binding assay similar to the binding assay of<br>
Example 8 was used to test the ability of two mAbs produced<br>
in Example 1 to inhibit 125I-NogoG6 binding to sNogoR344-Fc.<br>
Mabs 2F7 and 3G5 inhibited 12SI-Nogo66 binding to sNogoR344-<br>
Fc.<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
Neurite Outgrowth Assay<br>
[0194] Lab-Tek® culture slides (4 wells) were coated with<br>
0.1 mg/ml poly-D-lysine (Sigma®) . CNS myelin alone or mixed<br>
with sNogoR310, sNogoR310-Fc fusion protein, mAb 5B10 or<br>
control PBS were separately spotted as 3ml drops.*****<br>
Fluorescent microspheres (Polysciences) were added to the<br>
myelin/PBS to allow later identification of the drops<br>
(Grandpre et al, Nature 403, 2000). Lab-Tek® slides were<br>
then rinsed and coated with 10 (i.g/ml laminin (Gibco ) .<br>
[0195] Dorsal root ganglions (DRG's) from P3-4 Sprague<br>
Dawley rat pups were dissociated with 1 mg/ml collagenase<br>
type 1 (Worthington) , triturated with fire-polished Pasteur<br>
pipettes pre-plated to enrich in neuronal cells and finally<br>
plated at 23,000 cells/well on the pre-coated Labtek culture<br>
slides. The culture medium was F12 containing 5% heat<br>
inactivated donor horse serum, 5% heat inactivated fetal<br>
bovine serum and 50 ng/ml mNGF and incubated at 37°C and 5%<br>
CO2 for 6 hours.<br>
[0196] Slides were fixed for 20 minutes with 4%<br>
paraformaldehyde containing 20% sucrose and stained for the<br>
neuronal marker anti beta-III-tubulin (Covance TUJ1)<br>
diluted 1:500. As secondary antibody anti-mouse Alexa<br>
Fluor® 594 (Molecular Probes) was diluted 1:300 and slides<br>
TM TM<br>
were coverslipped with Gel/Mount (Bismeda ) . 5x digital<br>
images were acquired with OpenLab software and analyzed by<br>
using the MetaMorph® software for quantification of neurite<br>
outgrowth.<br>
[0197] sNogoR310, sNogoR310-Fc and mAb 5B10 all protected<br>
DRG neurons from myelin-mediated inhibition of neurite<br>
outgrowth (Figs. 9-11) . sNogoR310 was used in a similar<br>
assay using chick neurons and was found to be protective.<br>
[0198] We also tested the neuro-protective effect of<br>
soluble Nogo receptors by performing experiments with cells<br>
grown in the presence and absence of laminin. Neuronal cell<br>
growth in media without laminin is poor and models neuronal<br>
stress conditions.<br>
[0199] DRG's were dissected from post-natal day 6-7 rat<br>
pups (P6-7), dissociated into single cells and plated on 96-<br>
well plates pre-coated with poly-D-lysine as described<br>
above. In some wells 2 mg/ml laminin was added for 2-3<br>
hours and rinsed before the cells were plated. After an 18-<br>
20 h incubation the plates were fixed with 4% para-<br>
formaldehyde, stained with rabbit anti-Beta-III-tubulin<br>
antibody diluted 1:500 (Covance®) and anti-HuC/D diluted<br>
1:100 (Molecular Probes), and fluorescent secondary<br>
antibodies (Molecular Probes) were added at 1:200 dilution.<br>
The ArrayScan® II (Cellomics®) was used to capture 5x<br>
digital images and to quantify neurite outgrowth as average<br>
neurite outgrowth/neuron per well, by using the Neurite<br>
outgrowth application. Nine 5x images from 3<br>
wells/condition were analysed.<br>
[0200] In some experiments, a sub-clone of PC12 cells<br>
(Neuroscreen ) was used (Cellomics®) . The Neuroscreen™<br>
cells were pre-differentiated for 7 days with 2 00 ng/ml NGF,<br>
detached and replated on 96-well plates pre-coated with<br>
poly-D-lysine. In some wells 5 mg/ml laminin was added for<br>
2-3 hours and rinsed before the cells were plated. After 2<br>
days incubation the plates were fixed with 4% para-<br>
formaldehyde, stained with rabbit anti-Beta-III-tubulin<br>
antibody diluted 1:500 (Covance®) and Hoechst (nuclear<br>
stain) . The ArrayScan II was used to quantify neurite<br>
outgrowth as in the DRG cells.<br>
[0201] sNogoR344-Fc or rat IgG were added in solution to<br>
P6-7 DRG neurons and to differentiated Neuroscreen™ cells at<br>
the time of plating.<br>
[0202] , The neuro-protective effect of sNogoR344-Fc was<br>
observed at 1 uM and 10 mM when P6 DRG neurons were grown in<br>
the absence of laminin. Quantification of neurite outgrowth<br>
showed a dose-dependent increase with the addition of<br>
sNogoR344-Fc. Addition of sNogoR344-Fc at the same<br>
concentrations to DRG neurons growing on a laminin<br>
substrate, did not produce any unusual effect, indicating<br>
that sNogoR344-Fc is only active on stressed cells. The<br>
neuro-protective effect of sNogoR344-Fc at the same<br>
concentrations in the absence of laminin also was seen with<br>
Neuroscreen cells.<br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
25 Production and Purification of<br>
Fc-sNogoR-1 Fusion Protein<br>
[0203] A cDNA construct encoding amino acids 1-310 of rat<br>
Nogo receptor-1 was fused to rat IgGl Fc contained in a<br>
30 mammalian expression vector and this vector was<br>
electroporated into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) (DG44)<br>
cells. Cells were maintained in alpha-MEM, supplemented<br>
with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine and<br>
antibiotic-antimycotic reagents. Two days after<br>
transfection, the conditioned media was collected and<br>
analyzed by Western blot under reducing conditions. A<br>
protein band about 6 0 kDa was detected using a polyclonal<br>
rabbit anti-Nogo receptor-1 antibody. Cells were expanded<br>
and sorted using a R-PE conjugated goat anti-rat IgG<br>
antibody. After the second sorting, cells were plated at a<br>
density of one cell/well in 96-well plates. Secreted<br>
soluble Nogo receptor-1 protein levels from individual wells<br>
was tested and compared using a Sandwich ELISA. SLISA plate<br>
was coated with goat anti-rat IgG Fck specific antibody.<br>
Conditioned media was applied. The bound soluble Nogo<br>
receptor-1 protein was detected by HRP conjugated donkey<br>
anti-rat IgG Fab, Fc-specific antibody. Clone 4C12 had the<br>
highest secretion level. 4C12 was expanded and grown in CHO-<br>
M7 media in spinner flask. The secretion level was about 10<br>
mg/L at 37°C.<br>
[0204] CHO cells expressing the sNogoR310-Fc fusion<br>
protein were cultured in large scale. 1.7 L of concentrated<br>
conditioned media was obtained from a 10 L bioreactor run.<br>
The pH was raised by addition of one-tenth volume 1.0 M<br>
Tris-HCl, pH 8.9. Solid sodium chloride and glycine were<br>
added to 3.0 M and 1.5 M respectively. A 60 mL protein A-<br>
Sepharose column equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl, 3 M<br>
sodium chloride, 1.5 M glycine, pH 8.9 was prepared.<br>
Concentrated conditioned media was applied to the column at<br>
1.5 mL/min using a peristaltic pump. The column was washed<br>
with 300 mL of 10 mM Tris-HCl, 3 M sodium chloride, 1.5 M<br>
glycine, pH 8.9 followed with 120 mL 5 mM Tris-HCl, 3 M<br>
sodium chloride, pH 8.9. Protein was eluted with 25 mM<br>
sodium phosphate, 100 mM sodium chloride, pH 2.8. 10 mL<br>
fractions were collected in tubes containing 1.0 mL of 1.0 M<br>
HEPES, pH 8.5. Protein fractions were pooled and dialyzed<br>
against 3 x 2 L of 5 mM sodium phosphate, 3 00 mM NaCl, pH<br>
7.4.<br>
EXAMPLE 12<br>
Spinal Cord Transection Assay<br>
[0205] To test their ability to promote functional<br>
recovery in vivo, an sNogoR-1 fusion protein was tested in a<br>
rat spinal cord transection assay.<br>
[0206] Alzet® osmotic pumps were loaded with test<br>
solution (sNogoR310-Fc in PBS) made up freshly on the day of<br>
use. The loading concentration was calculated to be 5 and<br>
50 mM. Pumps were primed for &gt;40 hours at 37°C prior to<br>
implantation into animals. Female Long Evans rats were<br>
given pre-operative analgesia and tranquilizer and<br>
anesthetized using isoflurane (3% in O2) .<br>
[0207] Rats were placed in a stereotaxic frame and the<br>
motor cortex exposed for infusion of the tract tracing agent<br>
BDA (10,000 MW) bilaterally. Rats then underwent dorsal<br>
hemisection of the spinal cord at T5-T6 followed by<br>
implantation of the intrathecal catheter and pump system to<br>
deliver test compound (n=ll per group).<br>
[0208] Rats were allowed to recover and survive up to 28<br>
days after surgery. Behavioral scoring using the BBB system<br>
was recorded up to 28 days after induction of injury, just<br>
prior to termination of the in-life phase of the study.<br>
Following perfusion and fixation, spinal cords were removed,<br>
cryoprotected, sectioned, stained and axonal counts<br>
performed.<br>
[02 09] The Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating<br>
scale (Basso et al., 1996, Neurotrauma 13, 343-359), the<br>
inclined plane test and the inclined grid walking test (Li<br>
and Strittmatter, 2003, J Neurosci. 2003, 23, 4219-27) were<br>
monitored in rats and mice after injury. For the inclined<br>
plane test, we measured the maximal angle to which a 50 cm x<br>
60 cm board could be angled for 5 sec without the mouse<br>
sliding off. For inclined grid walking, the mice were<br>
trained to climb a wire grid (35 cm long with 2.54 cm<br>
squares) at a slope of 45 degrees. The number of instances<br>
in which the hindpaw dropped below the grid plane was scored<br>
for each excursion from bottom to top. For the rat<br>
behavioral testing, BBB locomotor scale, grid walking and<br>
footprint analysis were performed. For grid walking, the<br>
rats were trained to walk on a wire grid (70 cm long with<br>
2.54 cm squares), and the number of instances in which the<br>
hindpaw dropped below the grid plane was counted. For<br>
footprint analysis, the walking patterns of rat hindpaws<br>
were recorded with ink during a continuous locomotion across<br>
a 90 cm runway, and stride length on each side and stride<br>
width were calculated (Mete et al., 2000, Brain Res., 883,<br>
165-177). All of these behavioral tests were performed by<br>
at least two individuals. Throughout the surgery,<br>
behavioral testing and histologic analysis, researchers were<br>
blind to the identity of the compound in the minipump.<br>
[0210] sNogoR310-Fc promoted functional recovery (Fig.<br>

EXAMPLE 13<br>
Rat Spinal Cord Contusion Assay<br>
[0211] The effect of soluble Nogo receptor-1 polypeptides<br>
and fusion proteins on neurons in vivo are tested in a rat<br>
spinal cord contusion assay.<br>
[0212] Female hooded Long Evans rats (170-190 g) are<br>
treated prophylactically with analgesic and antibiotic<br>
agents. Ten minutes before surgery, animals are<br>
tranquilized with 2.5 mg/kg Midazolam i.p. and anesthetized<br>
in 2-3% isoflurane in O2. Rats are then shaved, wiped down<br>
with alcohol and betadine, and ocular lubricant applied to<br>
their eyes. Next, an incision is made down the midline and<br>
the T7 to T12 vertebrae exposed.<br>
[0213] A dorsal laminectomy is performed at T9 1/2 and<br>
T10 to expose the cord. The rat is mounted on the Impactor.<br>
T7 and T8 segments are first clamped and then the Tll and<br>
T12 segments are attached to the caudal clamp. A soft<br>
material is placed underneath the chest of the rat. The<br>
Impactor rod is set to the zero position and the electrical<br>
ground clip is attached to the wound edge. The Impactor rod<br>
is then raised to 25.0 mm and appropriately adjusted to a<br>
position directly above the exposed spinal cord. Next, the<br>
Impactor rod is released to hit the exposed cord and the<br>
Impactor rod is immediately lifted.<br>
[0214] The rat is then dismounted, and Gelfoam® placed on<br>
the wound. The muscle over the wound is sutured, and the<br>
incision is surgically stapled. Animals are placed in an<br>
incubator until they recover from anesthesia. Rats are<br>
given antibiotics, analgesics, and saline as required.<br>
Bladders are expressed every morning and evening thereafter<br>
until function is recovered.<br>
[0215] Soluble Nogo receptor-1 fusion protein (e.g.,<br>
sNogoR310-Fc) is administered intrathecally as described in<br>
the rat spinal cord transection model above. BBB scoring is<br>
performed one-day after surgery, then every week thereafter<br>
until 4 to 6 weeks.<br>
EXAMPLE 14<br>
Expression of sNogoR310 in Transgenic Mice<br>
[0216] We produced transgenic mice expressing soluble<br>
Nogo receptor-1 protein to test its effect when expressed in<br>
vivo.<br>
[0217] We cloned the mouse sNogoR310 cDNA (corresponding<br>
to amino acids 1-310 of the Nogo receptor-1; SEQ ID NO: 28)<br>
into the NotI site of the C-3123 vector. In this vector,<br>
sNogoR310 expression is under the control of the glial<br>
fibrillary acidic protein (gfap) gene regulatory elements,<br>
which allow high level expression with enhanced secretion<br>
from reactive astrocytes at site of injury. We digested the<br>
resulting vector sequentially with AatII and SfiI and<br>
isolated the gfap:: sNogoR310 construct on a 3.4 kb fragment.<br>
We microinjected this fragment into embryos to generate<br>
transgenic mice. We verified by PCR that the transgene had<br>
integrated and identified five founder lines. We crossed<br>
heterozygous males of the two founder lines with the highest<br>
expression levels to female C57BL/6J mice. We confirmed<br>
that the C4FAP-positive cells express and secrete sNogoR310<br>
in heterozygous transgenic mice by Western blot analysis<br>
using antibody raised against Nogo receptor-1.<br>
[0218] We homogenized the cortex and spinal cord in Tris-<br>
buffered saline supplemented with protease inhibitors<br>
(Roche) and centrifuged the homogenate at 40,000 rpm for 20<br>
min at 4°C. We treated the supernatant with 4%<br>
paraformaldehyde for 20 min to enhance antibody specificity<br>
and diaiyzed prior to immunoblotting. We homogenised the<br>
particulate fraction by sonication in RIPA buffer (1%<br>
Triton® X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS in PBS),<br>
centrifuged the resulting homogenate and treated this<br>
supernatant (detergent-soluble particulate fraction) as<br>
above. We analysed 2 0 ug of brain or spinal cord protein by<br>
immunoblot using rabbit antiserum raised against Nogo<br>
receptor-1 at 1:2000 dilution. We visualized<br>
immunoreactivity by incubation with AP-conjugated anti-<br>
rabbit IgG and JS1BT/BCIP AP substrates.<br>
[0219] We detected secreted 37 kDa sNogoR310 in<br>
detergent-free soluble extracts of cortex and spinal cord<br>
from the two transgenic lines Tg08 and Tg01, but little if<br>
any soluble Nogo receptor-1 protein at 3 7 or 81 kDa is<br>
present in littermate wild type (WT) mice. Examination of<br>
the particulate fractions demonstrated that there were<br>
comparable levels of endogenous Nogo receptor-1 in both WT<br>
and transgenic mice.<br>
EXAMPLE 15<br>
Expression of sNogoR310 in<br>
Transgenic Mice After Injury<br>
[0220] We tested the effect of CNS injury on sNogoR310<br>
expression in transgenic mice by performing a dorsal over-<br>
hemisection injury. We obtained sNogoR310 transgenic and<br>
nontransgenic control animals by mating heterozygous males<br>
with C57/BL6 females as described in Example 14.<br>
[0221] We deeply anesthetized adult female heterozygous<br>
transgenic or littermate WT mice (10-16 weeks of age) and<br>
performed a complete laminectomy, fully exposing the dorsal<br>
part of spinal cord at T6 and T7 levels. We performed a<br>
dorsal over-hemisection at T6 with a 3 0-gauge needle and a<br>
pair of microscissors to completely sever the dorsal and<br>
dorsolateral corticospinal tracts (CSTs). We passed a<br>
marked needle across the dorsal part of the spinal cord<br>
several times to assure that the lesion was at a depth of<br>
1.0 mm. We sutured the muscle layers over the laminectotnies<br>
and closed the skin on the back with surgical staples. To<br>
trace the corticospinal tracts, we made a burr hole<br>
overlying cerebral cortex on the right side into the skull<br>
14 days after spinal cord injury. We applied the tracer BDA<br>
(MW 10,000, 10% in PBS) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to 4<br>
injection sites at a depth of 0.7 mm from the cortical<br>
surface. Four weeks after injury, the mice were perfused<br>
transcardially with PBS, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde.<br>
Mice used for sNogoR310 expression experiments did not<br>
receive any tracer injection.<br>
[0222] For the mice used for western blot analysis, the<br>
spinal cord at a level between T3 and L3 was collected<br>
without perfusion 14 days after injury. Mice used for Nogo<br>
receptor-1 immunohistochemicai staining were perfused with<br>
4% paraformaldehyde 10 days after hemisection, and the<br>
injured spinal cord was removed for sectioning. To examine<br>
sNogoR310 expression in the injured brain of transgenic and<br>
WT mice, a cortex stab injury was performed with a number 11<br>
scalpel blade held in a stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf,<br>
Tujunga, CA) . A 4 mm parasagittal cut was made, 0.5 mm<br>
posterior to Bregma, 1.5 mm laterally from midline and 3.5<br>
mm deep.<br>
[0223] We detected increased levels of sNogoR310 in<br>
soluble extracts of spinal cords ten days after the injury<br>
in transgenic mice but not in WT mice, consistent with the<br>
upregulation after injury of GFAP around the lesion. To<br>
confirm that this was not due to compensatory upregulation<br>
of Nogo-A, we tested its expression and found that it was<br>
similar in either intact or injured cortex and spinal cord<br>
from either WT and transgenic mice.<br>
[0224] We examined the cellular expression of sNogoR310<br>
in injured CNS by immunostaining the injured brain and<br>
spinal cord containing the lesion area with antibodies<br>
against Nogo receptor-1 and GFAP. The general morphology of<br>
reactive astrocytic glia does not differ between WT and<br>
transgenic mice, but the density stained for Nogo receptor-1<br>
in both intra- and extracellular space is remarkably higher<br>
in the gfap: :sNogoR310, transgenic mice than in WT mice,<br>
indicating increased sNogoR310 expression around the lesion<br>
in transgenic mice. Nogo receptor-1 protein is co-localized<br>
with astrocytic marker GFAP only in the transgenic mice.<br>
There is also a greatly enhanced diffuse non-cellular<br>
staining in the transgenic samples, consistent with<br>
sNogoR310in the extracellular space. Neuronal cell body<br>
Nogo receptor-1 staining is detected in both WT and<br>
transgenic mice.<br>
EXAMPLE 16<br>
Secreted sNogoR310 Induces CST<br>
Sprouting in Transgenic Mice<br>
[0225] We tested whether increased expression of<br>
sNogoR310 around the lesion in transgenic mice results in<br>
the regeneration of injured axons.<br>
[0226] We investigated the integrity of descending<br>
corticospinal tracts (CST) by injecting anterograde tracer<br>
biotin dextran amine (BDA) into the right motor cortex as<br>
described in Li and Strittmatter, 2003, J. Neurosci., 23,<br>
4219-27. In littermate WT mice, the prominent dorsal CST<br>
(dCST) is tightly bundled rostral to the lesion, and a few<br>
dorsolateral CST fibers are visible ipsilaterally. A small<br>
number of BDA-labeled short collateral sprouts project into<br>
gray matter, particularly in the ventral cord, but the<br>
sprouting is largely confined to the side of the cord<br>
contralateral to the tracer injection. However, the<br>
sections rostral to dorsal hemiaection from injured<br>
sNogoR310 transgenic mice indicate a quite different BDA<br>
labeling pattern. A high density of BDA-labeled CST fibers<br>
are observed outside of prominent dCST in all the transgenic<br>
mice from line Tg08 or line Tg01. Ectopic fibers extend<br>
throughout the gray matter area, and some fibers reach into<br>
lateral and dorsolateral white matter. Several fibers (4-12<br>
sprouts per transverse section) are seen on the opposite<br>
side of the spinal cord (ipsilateral to the tracer injection<br>
site). Micro densitometric measurement of the collateral<br>
sprouts indicates approximately a tenfold increase in<br>
sprouting density in sNogoR310 transgenic mice. Examination<br>
of parasagittal longitudinal sections from 1 to 4 mm rostral<br>
to the lesion reveals that dCST fibers extend a large number<br>
of branching sprouts into the ventral gray matter area in<br>
sNogoR310 transgenic mice, in contrast to the littermate WT<br>
animals. Generally, the pattern and extent of sprouting<br>
rostral to the lesion in transgenic mice are similar to<br>
those observed in the mice treated systemically with Nogo<br>
receptor-1 antagonist peptide NEP1-40 (Li and Strittmatter,<br>
2003).<br>
[0227] These results demonstrate that secreted sNogoR310<br>
induces CST sprouting in the transgenic mice.<br>
EXAMPLE 17<br>
Regenerating CST Axons Bypass the Lesion Site into Distal<br>
Spinal Cord in sNogoR310 Transgenic Mice<br>
[022 8] We isolated spinal cord 4 mm rostral to and 4 mm<br>
caudal to the lesion site (8 mm long in total) from<br>
transgenic mice and embedded it in a glutaraldehyde-<br>
polymerized albumin matrix, and cut parasagittally on a<br>
vibratome (30 mm thick). We collected transverse sections<br>
(50 mm) from the spinal cord 5-7 mm rostral to and 5-7 mm<br>
caudal to the injury site. For sNogoR310-Fc injection<br>
experiments in rats, the spinal cord extending from 10 mm<br>
rostral to 10 mm caudal from the lesion site was cut<br>
parasaggitally (50 mm) on a vibrating microtome. Transverse<br>
sections were collected from the spinal cord 11-16 mm<br>
rostral to and 11-16 mm caudal to the injury site. We<br>
incubated the sections with avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex<br>
and visualized the BDA tracer by nickel-enhanced<br>
diaminobenzidine HRP reaction (Grandpre, 2002, Nature, 417,<br>
547-551). We processed some sections for serotonin<br>
immunohistochemistry (anti-5-HT antibody) by indirect<br>
immunofluoresence. To visualize the lesion area, we double-<br>
stained some sections with antibodies directed against GFAP<br>
(Sigma®, St. Louis, MO). We mounted, dehydrated and covered<br>
the sections with mounting medium.<br>
[0229] We tested whether the fibers induced by sNogoR310<br>
expressed in transgenic mice after injury (see Example 16)<br>
cross the lesion area into the caudal spinal cord to provide<br>
functional recovery.<br>
[023 0] Consecutive parasaggital sections across the<br>
injury site drawn in camera lucida display the overall<br>
distribution pattern of the regenerating CST fibers a few<br>
millimeters from the lesion. Sections from WT mice show no<br>
CST fibers extending beyond the injury site. Similar<br>
sections from sNogoR310 transgenic mice display numerous CST<br>
fibers that cross the transection area and project into the<br>
distal gray and white matter areas in a highly branched<br>
pattern. Immediately rostral to hemisection, a high density<br>
of BDA-labeled CST sprouting originated from prominent dCST<br>
projects into the lesion area, but most CST sprouts failed<br>
to pass the transection area where scar formation and tissue<br>
cavitation are prominent. A small but highly significant<br>
fraction of the regenerating axons bypass the lesion site<br>
through the remaining tissue bridges of the ventral and<br>
ventrolateral gray and white matter. In addition, a few CST<br>
fibers appear to cross the transection area itself via the<br>
lesioned dorsal and dorsolateral spinal cord into distal<br>
regions. In the vicinity of lesion, the course of<br>
regenerating fibers was typically tortuous and quite<br>
distinct from the normal straight fibers in the rostral CST.<br>
Collaterals and arborized fibers are most frequently seen in<br>
gray matter area of distal spinal cord. The reconstructions<br>
demonstrate 5-15 BDA-labeled regenerating fibers coursing in<br>
the rostral-caudal axis at any level 1-4 mm caudal to the<br>
lesion in each transgenic mouse. For transverse sections 5-<br>
7 mm caudal to dorsal hemisection, BDA-labeled CST axons are<br>
seen in both the gray matter and white matter areas in each<br>
transgenic mouse. The fiber counts for the transgenic mice<br>
indicate approximately a similar number of BDA-labeled CST<br>
fibers to the proximal levels in the sagittal sections.<br>
[0231] In addition to CST fibers, the other descending<br>
tracts, such as raphespinal fibers, also contribute to<br>
locomotor function in mice. In this mouse dorsal over-<br>
hemisection model, the transection injures a majority of the<br>
serotonergic fibers, decreasing the density of these fibers<br>
by approximately 8 0% in the ventral horn. Analysis of total<br>
length of serotonin fibers in the ventral horn of caudal<br>
spinal cord indicates a much greater number of these fibers<br>
in transgenic mice than WT group, indicating that the<br>
growth-promoting effects of sNogoR310 in transgenic mice are<br>
not limited to one axon descending pathway.<br>
EXAMPLE 18<br>
Transgenic Expression of sNogoR31Q Improves Locomotor<br>
Recovery<br>
[0232] The CST axon tracing and serotonergic fiber<br>
analysis indicate that the sNogoR310 released from<br>
astrocytes in transgenic mice stimulates extensive<br>
anatomical regeneration of injured descending axons in the<br>
spinal cord. We performed several behavioral tests as<br>
described in Example 12 to determine whether these<br>
regenerated fibers benefit functional recovery.<br>
[0233] As assessed by the BBB test, the WT mice partially<br>
recover locomotor function during a 4-week period of<br>
survival. At 4 weeks post-injury, most WT mice recover a<br>
level characterised by consistent plantar stepping with<br>
consistent weight support, but they exhibit only occasional<br>
to frequent forelimb-hindlimb coordination, with a rotation<br>
of predominant paw position when making initial contact with<br>
surface. In contrast, the BBB scores of sNogoR310 transgenic<br>
mice from both lines Tg08 and Tg 01 are significantly higher<br>
than control group throughout the 7-28 day observation<br>
period (Figs. 13A and 13B). At 28 days after injury, most<br>
transgenic mice show consistent forelimb-hindlimb<br>
coordination, and the predominant paw position is parallel<br>
to the body.<br>
[0234] We employed two more behavioral tests to further<br>
characterize the performance of sNogoR310 transgenic mice.<br>
First, we measured the maximal angle to which a board would<br>
be tilted without a mouse losing its grip within 5 sec.<br>
Before dorsal hemisection injury, both transgenic and WT<br>
mice can sustain their posture on board angled at 55<br>
degrees. On days 7-28 after injury, the sustainable angle<br>
is reduced in all mice, but the angles sustainable by the<br>
transgenic mice are significantly greater than those for the<br>
control group (Fig. 13C). In another behavioral test, mice<br>
climbed a grid placed at a 45 degree angle to vertical and<br>
excursions of the hindlimbs below the plane of the grid were<br>
counted (Metz et al., 2000). No mice made errors on this<br>
test during the pre-injury training. There are numerous foot<br>
fault errors with only minimal improvement in WT mice during<br>
the period 2-6 weeks post-injury. In contrast, the<br>
sNogoR310 transgenic mice exhibit a progressive improvement<br>
in grid climbing during this period, with the majority of<br>
improvement occurring betweenl-3 weeks post-injury (Fig.<br>
13D). Thus, transgenic mice secreting sNogoR310 from<br>
astrocytes exhibit CST regeneration, raphespinal sprouting<br>
and improved motor function after thoracic spinal<br>
hemisection.<br>
Example 19<br>
Intrathecal Administration of sNogoR310-Fc<br>
Protein Induces CST Sprouting<br>
[0235] As a second test of the growth-promoting benefit<br>
of soluble Nogo receptor-1 after spinal trauma, we<br>
administered the purified protein intrathecally.<br>
[0236] We fused the ligand binding domain (27-310) of rat<br>
Nogo receptor-1 to the rat IgGl Fc domain to promote<br>
stability and purification. We purified protein from stably<br>
transfected CHO cells. This protein blocks Nogo-66, MAG and<br>
myelin action in vitro, as shown previously for mouse<br>
sNogoR310-Myc His (Fournier et al., 2002, J Neurosci., 22,<br>
8876-8883; Liu et al., 2002, Science, 297, 1190-1193). We<br>
delived sNogoR310-Fc protein intrathecally to rats with a<br>
mid-thoracic dorsal hemisection injury through an osmotic<br>
minipump. During a four-week survival period after injury,<br>
1.2 mg sNogoR310-Fc protein was locally administered in each<br>
rat. In rats receiving the vehicle treatment (1.2 mg rat<br>
IgG), sections rostral to hemisection display the tightly<br>
bundled prominent dorsal CST and very few ectopic BDA- <br>
labeled CST fibers above the lesion site. Sections rostral<br>
to lesion from injured rats receiving sNogoR310-Fc protein<br>
exhibit a quite different pattern of labeling. Numerous<br>
ectopic fibers sprouting from the BDA-labeled CST are<br>
observed from transverse and parasagittal sections. In some<br>
cases, projections cross from the dCST area near the midline<br>
to the circumference of the cord, becoming intermingled with<br>
the dorsolateral CST. The sprouting axons extend through<br>
gray matter to a greater extent than white matter. A<br>
measure of ectopic sprouting fibers (=100 mm in transverse<br>
sections, =200 mm in sagittal sections) adjacent to the dCST<br>
reveals a greater increase in the sNogoR310-Fc-treated rats.<br>
Example 20<br>
CST Axons Regenerate into Distal Spinal Cord<br>
in sNogoR310-Fc Treated Rats<br>
[0237] We deeply anaesthetized female Sprague-Dawley rats<br>
(190-25 0 g) and conducted laminectomies at spinal levels of<br>
T6-7, exposing the spinal cord. We cut the dorsal half of<br>
the spinal cord with a 3 0-gauge needle and a pair of<br>
microscissors to sever the dorsal parts of CSGT tracts, and<br>
assured the depth of the lesion (1.8 mm) by passing the<br>
sharp part of a number 11 blade across the dorsal half of<br>
the cord.(Grandpre et al., 2002, Nature, 417, 547-551). An<br>
osmotic minipump (Alzet® 2ML4, 2 ml volume, 2.5 ml/h, 28 day<br>
delivery), which was filled with 1.2 mg rat IgG in PBS or<br>
1.2 mg sNogoR310-Fc fusion protein in PBS, was sutured to<br>
muscles under the skin on the back of the animals. A<br>
catheter connected to the outlet of the minipump was<br>
inserted into the intrathecal space of the spinal cord at<br>
the T7-8 level through a small hole in the dura.<br>
[0238] Nogo receptor-1 antagonist protein infusion<br>
induced extensive sprouting rostral to a rat hemisection,<br>
but a more critical issue is whether the sprouting CST<br>
fibers project to distal spinal cord and contribute to<br>
locomotor recovery. Longitudinal sections across lesion<br>
site from vehicle-treated rats display no detectable or a<br>
very small number of BDA-labeled ventral CST fibers below<br>
the lesion level (GrandPre et al., 2002; Weidner et al.,<br>
2001, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 98, 3513-3518) . The<br>
similar sections from sNogoR310-Fc treated rats demonstrate<br>
many BDA-labeled fibers bypass the transection site and<br>
project to the caudal spinal cord largely through the<br>
bridging tissues of the ventral and ventrolateral spinal<br>
cord. Immunostaining for astrocytic marker GFAP display<br>
that the extent of transection reached deeper than central<br>
canal area. Unlike the linear profile of rostral fibers in<br>
prominent dorsal CST, the regenerated CST fibers usually<br>
follow a highly branching trajectory in the distal spinal<br>
cord, particularly in gray matter area. These fibers are<br>
detected in many regions of spinal cord, but they are more<br>
easily seen in the central part and dorsal half of spinal<br>
cord throughout the spinal cord. Counts of CST fibers from<br>
sagittal sections indicate approximately 20 BDA-labeled<br>
axons at 1-2 mm caudal to lesion and 15 traced axons at 7-8<br>
mm distal to lesion from each sNogoR310-Fc-treated rat.<br>
[0239] Generally, the branching pattern of these fibers<br>
is similar to that observed from local NEP 1-40 peptide<br>
treated animals, but more collateral branching in each<br>
sprout is seen from the sections treated with sNogoR310-Fc<br>
protein. A measure of the sprouts from distal spinal cord<br>
demonstrates that the total collateral length of each sprout<br>
in sNogoR310-Fc-treated rats is twice as great as that from<br>
NEP 1-40-treated animals. The number of sprouts (=200 mm in<br>
length) at 1-10 mm caudal to spinal cord in both Nogo<br>
receptor-1 antagonist-treated groups is approximately 20-40<br>
times greater than control groups. More sprouts are seen<br>
from sNogoR310-Fc treated rats than local NEP 1-40 treatment<br>
(~50 vs. 25 sprouts/rat), but this difference is not<br>
statistically significant (p=0.1713, t-test).<br>
[0240] Regenerating CST axons are observed in transverse<br>
sections of spinal cord 11-15 mm caudal to hemisection in<br>
rats receiving sNogoR310-Fc treatment. These fibers are<br>
detected in both gray matter and white matter of the spinal<br>
cord. The fibers detected in gray matter often exhibit more<br>
collateral branching than in white matter area. In<br>
contrast, in transverse sections from vehicle-treated group,<br>
only occasional BDA-labeled are seen in the ventral white<br>
matter area, consistent with the uninjured ventral CST<br>
axons. At this level of distal spinal cord, the average<br>
number of BDA-labeled CST fibers from both Nogo receptor-1<br>
antagonist-treated groups [sNogoR310-Fc and NEP 1-40] are<br>
approximately 20-fold greater than vehicle-treated rats.<br>
Taken together, both Nogo receptor antagonists, sNogoR310-Fc<br>
protein and NEP 1-40 peptide, result in dramatic CST axon<br>
regeneration in distal spinal cord, but the sprouting<br>
induced by the former exhibits a more highly branched<br>
pattern.<br>
Example 21<br>
Local sNogoR310-Fc Induces Sprouting of Rubropinal and<br>
Serotonergic Axons in Injured Rat Spinal Cord<br>
[0241] Fourteen days after hemisection, a burr hole was<br>
made on each side of the skull overlying the sensorimotor<br>
cortex of the lower limbs to trace CST fibers. The<br>
anterograde neuronal tracer BDA (10% in PBS, 3.5 ml per<br>
cortex) was applied at seven injection sites at a depth of<br>
1.5 mm from dura on each side (Grandpre, 2002) . For<br>
rubrospinal tract tracing in rats, the tracer BDA (1 ml; MW<br>
10,000; 10% in PBS) was injected into red nucleus on the<br>
left side (5.8 mm posterior to bregma, 0.7 mm lateral, 7.0<br>
mm ventral to the skull surface). Two weeks after BDA<br>
injection, these animals were perfused with PBS, followed by<br>
4% paraformadehyde, and tissue was collected for histology.<br>
[0242] Repair of injured rubrospinal tract (RST) fibers<br>
contribute to functional improvements after spinal cord<br>
injury (Liu et al., 1999, J. Neurosci., 19, 4370-4387) . The<br>
widespread distribution of Nogo receptor-1 in CNS neurons<br>
(Wang et al., 2002, J. Neurosci., 22, 5505-5515) makes it<br>
possible that inhibition of Nogo receptor-1 with its<br>
antagonist may result in regrowth of RST axons after injury.<br>
To test effects of sNogoR310-Fc on injured RST, the<br>
integrity of this pathway was traced by injecting BDA into<br>
left red nucleus. At the spinal cord level, RST fibers are<br>
normally located in dorsolateral white matter area of spinal<br>
cord, and are transected by the dorsal hemisections of this<br>
study. In transverse sections 11-15 mm rostral to lesion<br>
from control rats, a small number of short BDA-labeled<br>
fibers are seen between the prominent RST and dorsal horn<br>
gray matter. Sections at same level treated with sNogoR310-<br>
Fc exhibit many linking fibers between the main RST and<br>
dorsal horn gray matter. Transverse sections 11-15 mm distal<br>
to SCI, no BDA-labeled RST fibers in vehicle-treated rats.<br>
In contrast, sections at the same level receiving sNogoR310-<br>
Fc treatment display many BDA-labeled RST fibers in both<br>
gray and white matter contralateral to tracer injection.<br>
Some sprouts with a branching pattern are seen in the gray<br>
matter ipsilateral to BDA injection.<br>
[0243] Ruphespinal spinal fibers were also examined in<br>
sNogoR310-Fc treated spinal injured rats. Immunostaining<br>
demonstrates the density of serotonergic fibers 11-15 mm<br>
rostral to lesion that is similar between vehicle and<br>
sNogoR310-Fc treated groups. In the sections 11-15 mm below<br>
the lesion, the seroton fibers in sNogoR310-Fc treated rats<br>
are twice as numerous as those in the control group. These<br>
results demonstrate that the responsiveness to Nogo<br>
receptor-1 inhibition by sNogoR310-Fc protein is not limited<br>
to CST fibers, and that the other descending tracts, such as<br>
rubrospinal and serotonergic axons, are also responsive to<br>
Nogo receptor-1 antagonism.<br>
Example 22<br>
Local Treatment with sNogoR310-Fc Improves<br>
Functional Recovery in Rats<br>
[0244] Intrathecal administration of sNogoR310-Fc protein<br>
stimulates axon regeneration in several descending pathways<br>
after traumatic spinal cord injury. We tested whether the<br>
protein also improves functional recovery in the injured<br>
spinal cord.<br>
[0245] At 2 weeks after the hemisection, the locomotor<br>
BBB score in vehicle-treated rats reaches a stable level of<br>
12 (Fig. 14A). At 4 weeks after lesion, most of controls (6<br>
out of 7} have frequent-consistent weight-supported plantar<br>
steps and frequent-consistent forelimb-hindlimb<br>
coordination, but they have a rotation of predominant paw<br>
position when making initial contact with surface. In<br>
contrast, in rats receiving sNogoR310-Fc protein treatment,<br>
the locomotor score continues to improve between 2-4 weeks<br>
post-trauma. At 4 weeks after injury, all 9 of the<br>
sNogoR310-Fc treated animals had consistent forelimb-<br>
hindlimb coordination and a parallel paw position at initial<br>
contact with the testing surface.<br>
[0246] Grid walking has been used to assess the deficits<br>
in descending fine motor control after spinal cord injury<br>
(Metz et al. , 2000). This performance requires forelimb-<br>
hindlimb coordination and voluntary movement control<br>
mediated by ventrolateral, corticospinal and rubrospinal<br>
fibers,. During the pre-injury training, all the rats<br>
accurately place their hindlimbs on the grid bars. At 2-4<br>
weeks post-injury, control rats make 8-9 errors per session<br>
with only minimal improvement over time. In contrast, the<br>
rats treated with sNogoR310-Fc exhibit a progressive<br>
improvement on grid walking and make significant fewer<br>
errors (4-7/session on average). The majority of the<br>
improvement occurs at 2-3 weeks after injury. Analysis of<br>
hindpaw footprints in control group displays that stride<br>
length is significantly decreased and stance width is<br>
increased at 4 weeks post-hemisection, compared with<br>
uninjured rats or injured animals receiving sNogoR310-Fc<br>
treatment (Fig. 14C). Therefore, these multiple behavioral<br>
tests demonstrate that blockade of Nogo receptor-1 function<br>
with local injection of antagonist protein improves<br>
locomotor recovery after injury.<br>
