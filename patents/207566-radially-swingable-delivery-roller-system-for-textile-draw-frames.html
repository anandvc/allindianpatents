This invention relates to a radially swingable delivery roller system for textile draw frames.<br>
In textile draw frames, sliver from down stream machine is fed to the drafting system through a creel. Sliver is drafted according to the desired requirement in the drafting system. From the drafting zone, the drafted sliver is collected by way of web guide and is delivered to the coiler through a pair of delivery rollers. Displacement of delivery rollers to accommodate the variation of the mass of sliver is an essential requirement. In conventional systems, the delivery rollers are spring loaded to effect this displacement.<br>
The delivery roller system consists of a fixed delivery roller shaft mounted on a fixed bearing assembly. This fixed shaft has a delivery roller on one end and a drive pulley mounted on the other end.<br>
A movable delivery roller shaft is mounted on a movable bearing assembly. This movable shaft is provided with a delivery roller on one end and a drive pulley on the other end.<br>
The axis of a deflector roller is located in the fixed bearing assembly and the movable bearing assembly is hingedly connected to the fixed bearing assembly at the axis of deflection to enable the movable bearing assembly to swing around the axis of the deflection roller. A rotatable intermediate shaft<br><br>
having a pulley and an endless belt, drives the delivery rollers. This endless belt envelops a pulley mounted on bearings, inside its surface. A further pulley is provided on the outer surface of this belt which may preferably be a flat belt.  A deflection roller is mounted on an eccentric pin such that the<br>
T I<br>
enveloping of the belt over the pulley may be adjustable through the eccentric pin. This arrangement enables the delivery rollers to rotate in the opposite direction also. Drive from the deflection roller is taken to the corresponding drive pulley mounted on me fixed delivery shaft through an endless belt Drive from another deflection roller is taken to the drive pulley mounted on the movable delivery roller shaft. This effects the swing of the movable bearing assembly in accordance with die mass of sliver passing between delivery rollers. The delivery rollers may be in the form of stepped rollers.<br>
A radially swingable delivery roller system for textile draw frames according to this invention comprises a first delivery roller, shaft, mounted on a fixed bearing assembly, a second delivery roller shaft, mounted on a movable bearing assembly, said movable bearing assembly being hingedly connected to the said fixed bearing assembly at the axis of a deflector roller, said the first and the second delivery roller shafts being provided with delivery rollers, each of said delivering roller shafts being provided with drive pulleys of their respective ends opposite to the said fixed and movable bearing assemblies and the drive means to drive the said first and second delivery roller shafts in a direction opposite to each other.<br><br>
An embodiment of this invention will now be described with reference to the single figure in the accompanying drawings.<br>
The fixed delivery roller shaft shown by numeral (14) is mounted in the bearings of a fixed bearing assembly (1). A movable delivery roller shaft (13) is mounted movably in the movable bearing assembly (2). Each of these shafts are provided with delivery rollers (3) and (3a) at one end. The other ends of the rollers provided with drive pulleys (4) and (4a); the axis of the moving bearing assembly is always parallel to the axis of the fixed bearing assembly.<br>
The drive means for the delivery rollers consist of a pulley (16) mounted on a rotatable intermediate shaft (not shown in the drawings). Three deflection rollers 7, 10 and 17 of which the axis of roller 7 located in the fixed bearing assembly form a part of the drive means.<br>
Drive to the delivery rollers is taken from pulley (16) through endless flat belt (6). The endless belts (12) and (15) connect drive rollers (4) and (4a) with the deflection rollers (7) and (17). Roller 10 connects the flat belt (6) and the pulley(16). The routing of the belt (6) is such that the delivery roller shafts rotate in the opposite direction. The outer surface of tins flat belt envelops a pulley (9) and the inner surface of belt envelops pulley (8). The deflection roller (10) is provided  with an eccentric pin (11). The<br><br>
envelop of the belt (6) over pulley (9) is adjustable through this eccentric pin. The delivery rollers are provided with the shoulders which acts as guide means to the sliver passing through condensor (5) which feeds the stiver between the rollers.<br>
The invention described and illustrated hereinabove relates only to a specific embodiment. Obvious equivalents and alterations are within the scope of the invention claimed hereinafter.<br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1. A radially swingable delivery roller system for textile draw frames comprising a first delivery roller shaft mounted on a fixed bearing assembly, a second delivery roller shaft mounted on a movable assembly, said movable bearing assembly being hingedly connected to said fixed bearing assembly at the axis of a deflector roller, said first and second delivery roller shafts being provided with delivery rollers, each of said delivery roller shafts being provided with drive pulleys at their respective ends opposite the said fixed and movable bearing assemblies, and a drive means to drive said first and second delivery roller shafts in a direction opposite to each other.<br>
2.	The delivery roller system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the drive means comprises a pulley mounted on a rotatory intermediate shaft drivably connecting said delivery roller shafts through an endless belt.<br>
3.	The delivery roller as claimed in claim 2, wherein the endless belt is a flat belt connected to a deflection roller provided with an eccentric pin.<br>
4.	The delivery roller as claimed in claims 1 to 3, wherein said drive means consists of deflection rollers connected to drive rollers through endless belts.<br><br>
The delivery roller as claimed in claims 1 to 4, wherein the axis of the moving bearing assembly is parallel to the fixed bearing assembly.<br>
The delivery roller as claimed in claims 1 to 5, wherein said delivery rollers are stepped rollers.<br>
The delivery roller as claimed in claims 1 to 5, wherein the delivery rollers are provided with shoulders to guide the sliver to said delivery rollers.<br>
The delivery roller as claimed in claims 1 to 6, wherein said endless belt connecting the rotatable intermediate shaft: and said deflection roller envelops two pulleys one on its inner surface and the other on its outer surface.<br>
A radially swingable delivery roller system for textile draw frames substantially as herein described and illustrated.<br><br></td>
