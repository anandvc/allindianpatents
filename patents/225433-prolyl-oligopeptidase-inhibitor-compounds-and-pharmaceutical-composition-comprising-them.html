ACTIVITY INHIBITOR COMPOUNDS AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION<br>
COMPRISING THEM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to new prolyl oligopeptidase inhibitors, and to their<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters thereof, as well as to pharmaceutical<br>
compositions containing them and to their use as a medicament.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Prolyl oligopeptidase (EC, 3.4.21.26) (POP), also known as prolyl endopeptidase, is the<br>
only serine protease that catalyses the hydrolysis of peptides at the C-terminal side of<br>
L-proline residues. It is widely distributed in mammals and can be purified from various<br>
organs, including the brain.<br>
The enzyme plays an important role in the breakdown of proline-containing<br>
neuropeptides related to learning and memory functions (Wilk, S., Life Sci., 1983, 33,<br>
2149-2157; O'Leary, R. M., O'Connor, B.,7. Neurochem., 1995,65,953-963).<br>
Compounds capable of inhibiting prolyl oligopeptidase are effective for preventing<br>
experimental amnesia induced by scopolamine in rats, inferring that prolyl oligopeptidase<br>
inhibitors have functions in the alleviation of mnemonic dysfunctions (Yoshimoto, T.,<br>
Kado, K., Matsubara, F., Koryama, N., Kaneto, H., Tsuru, D., J. Pharmacobio-Dyn.,<br>
1987,10, 730-735).<br>
In recent years it has been found that b-amyloid protein shows neurotoxic action in in<br>
vitro and in vivo experiments and that it may play an important role in the pathogenesis of<br>
Alzheimer's disease. In view of the hypothesis that substance P can suppress neurotoxic<br>
action of P-amyloid protein (Kowall, N. W., Beal, M. F., Busciglio, J., Duffy, L. K.,<br>
Yankner, B. A.,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1991,88,7247-7251), it is speculated that<br>
prolyl oligopeptidase inhibitors that inhibit also metabolism of substance P will be<br>
discovered to be an effective drug for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

The present invention also relates to the pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters of<br>
the compounds of the formula (I). Pharmaceutically acceptable salts, e.g. acid addition<br>
salts with both organic and inorganic acids are well known in the field of<br>
Pharmaceuticals. Non-limiting examples of these salts include chlorides, bromides,<br>
sulfates, nitrates, phosphates, sulfonates, formates, tartrates, maleates, citrates, benzoates,<br>
salicylates and ascorbates. Pharmaceutically acceptable esters, when applicable, may be<br>
prepared by known methods using pharmaceutically acceptable acids that are<br>
conventional in the field of Pharmaceuticals and that retain the pharmacological<br>
properties of the free form. Non-limiting examples of these esters include esters of<br>
aliphatic or aromatic alcohols, e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-<br>
butyl and tert-butyl esters.<br>
A further object of the invention is a pharmaceutical composition containing at least one<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier, and/or excipient, as well as a therapeutically<br>
effective amount of a compound of the formula (I) as the active agent. Still a further<br>
object of the invention is the use of the compounds of the formula (I) as a prolyl<br>
oligopeptidase inhibitor, for example in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such<br>
as for Alzheimer's disease, and senile dementia, as well as for improving learning and<br>
memory functions. Furthermore, a method for the treatment of a disesase or the<br>
enhancement of a condition where prolyl oligopeptidase inhibitors are indicated to be<br>
useful, e.g. a method for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, and/or for the<br>
improvement of learning and memory functions, is provided. In such a method a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention is administered to a<br>
subject in need of such treatment. The use of the compounds of the invention for the<br>
manufacture of a medicament to be used for the above indication is also provided.<br>
The compounds of formula (I), as well as the pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters<br>
thereof, are referred to below as the compounds of the invention, unless otherwise<br>
indicated.<br>
The invention includes within its scope all the possible stereoisomers of the compounds<br>
of formula (I), including geometric isomers, e.g. 2 and E isomers (cis and trans isomers),<br>
and optical isomers, e.g. diastereomers and enantiomers. Furthermore, the invention<br>
includes in its scope both the individual isomers and any mixtures thereof, e.g. racemic<br>
mixtures. The individual isomers may be obtained using the corresponding isomeric<br>
forms of the starting material or they may be separated after the preparation of the end<br>
compound according to conventional separation methods. For the separation of optical<br>
isomers, e.g. enantiomers, from the mixture thereof the conventional resolution methods,<br>
e.g. fractional crystallisation, may be used.<br>

DETERMINATION OF INHIBITORY EFFECT OF NOVEL COMPOUNDS ON<br>
PROLYL OLIGOPEPTIDASE ACTIVITY OF PIG BRAIN<br>
The inhibitory effect of the novel compounds on POP activity of pig brain was<br>
determined with a method based on that described by Toide et al. (Toide, K, Iwamoto,<br>
Y., Fujiwara. T., Abe, H., J.Pharmacol.Exp.Ther., 1995, 274,1370-1378) for the rat<br>
enzyme.<br>
The whole pig brains, excluding cerebellum and most of the brain stem, of three pigs<br>
were placed in liquid nitrogen within 30 min from killing and stored at -80°C until<br>
homogenized. The brains were homogenized with a glass-teflon homogenisator in 3<br>
volumes (w/v) of ice-cold 0.1 M sodium-potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and the<br>
homogenates were centrifuged for 20 min at 4°C at 10000 g. The supernatants were<br>
collected, pooled and stored in small aliquots at -80°C until used. The supernatant was<br>
thawn in ice just before activity assay and diluted in a ratio 1:2 with homogenisan'on<br>
buffer (= enzyme preparation).<br>
In the microplate assay procedure, 10 ml of enzyme preparation was preincubated with<br>
460 ml of 0.1 M sodium-potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and 5 ml of a solution of<br>
novel compound dissolved in DMSO and diluted with 0.1 M sodium-potassium<br>
phosphate buffer at 30°C for 30 min. The controls contained 10 ml enzyme preparation<br>
and 465 ml of 0.1 M sodium-potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The reaction was<br>
initiated by adding 25 ml of 4 mM Suc-Gly-Pro-AMC (AMC: 7-amido-4-<br>
methylcoumarin) dissolved in 0.1 M sodium-potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and<br>
the mixture was incubated at 30°C for 60 min. The reaction was terminated by adding<br>
500 ml of 1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.2).<br>
Formation of 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin was determined fluorometrically with<br>
microplate fluorescence reader (excitation at 360 nm and emission at 460 nm). The final<br>
concentration of novel compounds in the assay mixture varied from 10-12 M to 10-4 M.<br>
The prolyl oligopeptidase activity was calculated with the following formula in the<br>
presence of various concentrations of novel compounds. To reveal the inhibitory potency<br>
of the novel compound, activities (% of control) were plotted against the log<br>
concentration of the compound, and the IC50 value was determined by non-linear<br>
regression utilizing GraphPad Prism software.<br>
Activity (% of control) = a/b x 100, where<br>
a - fluorescence intensity in the presence of a novel compound<br>
b - fluorescence intensity without a novel compound (control)<br>
Inhibitory activity against other proline specific proteases<br>
The novel compounds were tested for specificity of inhibitory activity against formation<br>
of 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin from specific substrates of other proline specific<br>
peptidases in the pig brain.<br>
Determination of inhibitory effect of novel compounds on dipeptidyl peptidase II<br>
activity of pig brain<br>
By following the procedure for determination of inhibitory effect of novel compounds on<br>
prolyl oligopeptidase, but initiating the reaction by adding 25 ml of 0.4 mM H-Lys-Ala-<br>
AMC dissolved in 0.1 M sodium-potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and incubating<br>
the mixture at 30°C for 30 min, the formation of 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin was<br>
determined. The dipeptidyl peptidase n inhibition was calculated with the following<br>
formula in the presence of a novel compound (10-6 M).<br>
Percent inhibition (%) = (1 - c/d) x 100, where<br>
c = fluorescence intensity in the presence of novel compound<br>
d = fluorescence intensity without novel compound (control)<br>
The novel compounds did not exhibit any inhibitory effect against pig brain dipeptidyl<br>
peptidase II.<br>
Determination of inhibitory effect of novel compounds on dipeptidyl peptidase IV<br>
activity of pig brain<br>
By following the procedure for determination of inhibitory effect of novel compounds on<br>
prolyl oligopeptidase, but initiating the reaction by adding 25 ml of 2 raM H-Gly-Pro-<br>
AMC dissolved in 0.1 M sodium-potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), the formation of<br>
7-amido-4-methylcoumarin was determined. The dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibition was<br>
calculated with the formula described above in the presence of a novel compound (10-6<br>
M).<br>
The novel compounds did not exhibit any inhibitory effect against pig brain dipeptidyl<br>
peptidase IV.<br>
