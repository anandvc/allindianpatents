Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to referencing a physical channel carrying point-<br>
to-multipoint service data in a wireless communication system, and more particularly, to the use of an identifier to reference specific physical channel configurations<br>
previously sent to a mobile terminal from a network.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	Recently, mobile communication systems have developed remarkably, but for high<br>
capacity data communication services, the performance of mobile communication<br>
systems cannot match that of existing wired communication systems. Accordingly,<br>
technical developments for IMT-2000, which is a communication system allowing<br>
high capacity data communications, are being made and standardization of such<br>
technology is being actively pursued among various companies and organizations.<br>
[3]	A universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS) is a third generation mobile<br>
communication system that has evolved from a European standard known as Global<br>
System for Mobile communications (GSM). The UMTS aims to provide improved<br>
mobile communication service based on a GSM core network and wideband code<br>
division multiple access (W-CDMA) wireless connection technology.<br>
[4]	In December 1998, ETSI of Europe, ARIB/TTC of Japan, T1 of the United States,<br>
and TTA of Korea formed a Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for creating<br>
the detailed specifications of the UMTS technology.<br>
[5]	Within the 3GPP, in order to achieve rapid and efficient technical development of<br>
the UMTS, five technical specification groups (TSG)have been created for performing<br>
the standardization of the UMTS by considering the independent nature of the network<br>
elements and their operations.<br>
[6]	Each TSG develops, approves, and manages the standard specification within a<br>
related region. Among these groups, the radio access network (RAN) group<br>
(TSG-RAN) develops the standards for the functions, requirements, and interface of<br>
the UMTS terrestrial radio access network (UTRAN), which is a new radio access<br>
network for supporting W-CDMA access technology in the UMTS.<br>
[7]	Figure 1 illustrates an exemplary basic structure of a general UMTS network. As<br>
shown in Figure 1, the UMTS is roughly divided into a terminal (or user equipment:<br>
UE) 10, a UTRAN 100, and a core network (CN) 200.<br>
[8]	The UTRAN 100 includes one or more radio network sub-systems (RNS) 110,120.<br><br>
Each RNS 110, 120 includes a radio network controller (RNC) 111, and a plurality of<br>
base stations or Node-Bs 112,113 managed by the RNC 111. The RNC 111 handles<br>
the assigning and managing of radio resources, and operates as an access point with<br>
respect to the core network 200.<br>
[9]	The Node-Bs 112,113 receive information sent by the physical layer of the<br>
terminal through an uplink, and transmit data to the terminal through a downlink. The<br>
Node-Bs 112,113, thus, operate as access points of the UTRAN 100 for the terminal.<br>
[10]	A primary function of the UTRAN 100 is forming and maintaining a radio access<br>
bearer (RAB) to allow communication between the terminal and the core network 200.<br>
The core network 200 applies end-to-end quality of service (QoS) requirements to the<br>
RAB, and the RAB supports the QoS requirements set by the core network 200. As the<br>
UTRAN 100 forms and maintains the RAB, the QoS requirements of end-to-end are<br>
satisfied. The RAB service can be further divided into an Iu bearer service and a radio<br>
bearer service. The Iu bearer service supports a reliable transmission of user data<br>
between boundary nodes of the UTRAN 100 and the core network 200.<br>
[11]	The core network 200 includes a mobile switching center (MSC) 210 and a gateway<br>
mobile switching center (GMSC) 220 connected together for supporting a circuit<br>
switched (CS) service, and a serving GPRS support node (SGSN) 230 and a gateway<br>
GPRS support node 240 connected together for supporting a packet switched (PS)<br>
service.<br>
[12]	The services provided to a specific terminal are roughly divided into the circuit<br>
switched (CS) services and the packet switched (PS) services. For example, a general<br>
voice conversation service is a circuit switched service, while a Web browsing service<br>
via an Internet connection is classified as a packet switched (PS) service.<br>
[13]	For supporting circuit switched services, the RNCs 111 are connected to the MSC<br>
210 of the core network 200, and the MSC 210 is connected to the GMSC 220 that<br>
manages the connection with other networks.<br>
[14]	For supporting packet switched services, the RNCs 111 are connected to the SGSN<br>
230 and the GGSN 240 of the core network 200. The SGSN 230 supports the packet<br>
communications going toward the RNCs 111, and the GGSN 240 manages the<br>
connection with other packet switched networks, such as the Internet.<br>
[15]	Various types of interfaces exist between network components to allow the network<br>
components to transmit and receive information to and from each other for mutual<br>
communication therebetween. An interface between the RNC 111 and the core<br>
network 200 is defined as an Iu interface. In particular, the Iu interface between the<br>
RNCs 111 and the core network 200 for packet switched systems is defined as "Iu-PS,"<br>
and the Iu interface between the RNCs 111 and the core network 200 for circuit<br>
switched systems is defined as "Iu-CS."<br><br>
[16]	Figure 2 illustrates a structure of a radio interface protocol between the terminal and<br>
the UTRAN according to the 3GPP radio access network standards.<br>
[17]	As shown in Figure 2, the radio interface protocol has horizontal layers comprising<br>
a physical layer, a data link layer, and a network layer, and has vertical planes<br>
comprising a user plane (U-plane) for transmitting user data and a control plane<br>
(C-plane) for transmitting control information.<br>
[18]	The user plane is a region that handles traffic information of the user, such as voice<br>
or Internet protocol (DP) packets, while the control plane is a region that handles<br>
control information for an interface of a network, maintenance and management of a<br>
call, and the like.<br>
[19]	The protocol layers in Figure 2 can be divided into a first layer (L1), a second layer<br>
(L2), and a third layer (L3) based on three lower layers of an open system inter-<br>
connection (OSI) standard model. Each layer will be described in more detail as<br>
follows.<br>
[20]	The first layer (L1), namely, the physical layer, provides an information transfer<br>
service to an upper layer by using various radio transmission techniques. The physical<br>
layer is connected to an upper layer called a medium access control (MAC) layer, via a<br>
transport channel. The MAC layer and the physical layer send and receive data with<br>
one another via the transport channel.<br>
[21]	The second layer (L2) includes a MAC layer, a radio link control (RLC) layer, a<br>
broadcast/multicast control (BMC) layer, and a packet data convergence protocol<br>
(PDCP) layer.<br>
[22]	The MAC layer provides an allocation service of the MAC parameters for<br>
allocation and re-allocation of radio resources. The MAC layer is connected to an<br>
upper layer called the radio link control (RLC) layer, via a logical channel.<br>
[23]	Various logical channels are provided according to the kind of transmitted in-<br>
formation. In general, when information of the control plane is transmitted, a control<br>
channel is used. When information of the user plane is transmitted, a traffic channel is<br>
used. A logical channel may be a common channel or a dedicated channel depending<br>
on whether the logical channel is shared. Logical channels include a dedicated traffic<br>
channel (DTCH), a dedicated control channel (DCCH), a common traffic channel<br>
(CTCH), a common control channel (CCCH), a broadcast control channel (BCCH) and<br>
a paging control channel (PCCH) or a Shared Channel Control Channel (SHCCH). The<br>
BCCH provides information including information utilized by a terminal to access a<br>
system. The PCCH is used by the UTRAN to access a terminal.<br>
[24]	A Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS or "MBMS service") refers to a<br>
method of providing streaming or background services to a plurality of UEs using a<br>
downlink-dedicated MBMS radio bearer that utilizes at least one of point-to-multipoint<br><br>
and point-to-point radio bearer. One MBMS service includes one or more sessions and<br>
MBMS data is transmitted to the plurality of terminals through the MBMS radio bearer<br>
only while the session is ongoing.<br>
[25]	As the name implies, an MBMS may be carried out in a broadcast mode or a<br>
multicast mode. The broadcast mode is for transmitting multimedia data to all UEs<br>
within a broadcast area, for example the domain where the broadcast is available. The<br>
multicast mode is for transmitting multimedia data to a specific UE group within a<br>
multicast area, for example the domain where the multicast service is available.<br>
[26]	For purposes of MBMS, additional traffic and control channels exist. For example,<br>
an MCCH (MBMS point-to-multipoint Control Channel) is used for transmitting<br>
MBMS control information while an MTCH (MBMS point-to-multipoint Traffic<br>
Channel) is used for transmitting MBMS service data.<br>
[27]	The different logical channels that exist are listed below:<br>
Control Channel (CCH) 		 Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH)<br>
	 Paging Control Channel (PCCH)<br>
	 Dedicated Control Channel (DCCH)<br>
	 Common Control Channel (CCCH)<br>
	Shared Channel Control Channel (SHCCH)<br>
	MBMS point-to-multipoint Control Channel (MCCH)<br>
Traffic Channel (TCH)		 Dedicated Traffic Channel (DTCH)<br>
	 Common Traffic Channel (CTCH)<br>
	 MBMS point-to-multipoint Traffic Channel (MTCH)<br>
[28]	The MAC layer is connected to the physical layer by transport channels and can be<br>
divided into a MAC-b sub-layer, a MAC-d sub-layer, a MAC-c/sh sub-layer, and a<br>
MAC-hs sub-layer according to the type of transport channel to be managed.<br>
[29]	The MAC-b sub-layer manages a BCH (Broadcast Channel), which is a transport<br>
channel handling the broadcasting of system information. The MAC-d sub-layer<br>
manages a dedicated channel (DCH), which is a dedicated transport channel for a<br>
specific terminal. Accordingly, the MAC-d sub-layer of the UTRAN is located in a<br>
serving radio network controller (SRNC) that manages a corresponding terminal, and<br>
one MAC-d sub-layer also exists within each terminal (UE).<br>
[30]	The MAC-c/sh sub-layer manages a common transport channel, such as a forward<br>
access channel (FACH) or a downlink shared channel (DSCH), which is shared by a<br>
plurality of terminals, or in the uplink the Radio Access Channel (RACH). In the<br><br>
UTRAN, the MAC-c/sh sub-layer is located in a controlling radio network controller<br>
(CRNC). As the MAC-c/sh sub-layer manages the channel being shared by all<br>
terminals within a cell region, a single MAC-c/sh sub-layer exists for each cell region.<br>
Also, one MAC-c/sh sublayer exists in each terminal (UE). Referring to Figure 3,<br>
possible mapping between the logical channels and the transport channels from a UE<br>
perspective is shown. Referring to Figure 4, possible mapping between the logical<br>
channels and the transport channels from a UTRAN perspective is shown.<br>
[31]	The RLC layer supports reliable data transmissions, and performs a segmentation<br>
and concatenation function on a plurality of RLC service data units (RLC SDUs)<br>
delivered from an upper layer. When the RLC layer receives the RLC SDUs from the<br>
upper layer, the RLC layer adjusts the size of each RLC SDU in an appropriate manner<br>
upon considering processing capacity, and then creates certain data units with header<br>
information added thereto. The created data units are called protocol data units<br>
(PDUs), which are then transferred to the MAC layer via a logical channel. The RLC<br>
layer includes a RLC buffer for storing the RLC SDUs and/or the RLC PDUs.<br>
[32]	The BMC layer schedules a cell broadcast message (referred to as a 'CB message',<br>
hereinafter) received from the core network, and broadcasts the CB messages to<br>
terminals located in a specific cell(s). The BMC layer of the UTRAN generates a<br>
broadcast/multicast control (BMC) message by adding information, such as a message<br>
ID (identification), a serial number, and a coding scheme to the CB message received<br>
from the upper layer, and transfers the BMC message to the RLC layer. The BMC<br>
messages are transferred from the RLC layer to the MAC layer through a logical<br>
channel, i.e., the CTCH (Common Traffic Channel). The CTCH is mapped to a<br>
transport channel, i.e., a FACH, which is mapped to a physical channel, i.e., a S-<br>
CCPCH (Secondary Common Control Physical Channel).<br>
[33]	The PDCP (Packet Data Convergence Protocol) layer, as a higher layer of the RLC<br>
layer, allows the data transmitted through a network protocol, such as an IPv4 or IPv6,<br>
to be effectively transmitted on a radio interface with a relatively small bandwidth. To<br>
achieve this, the PDCP layer reduces unnecessary control information used in a wired<br>
network, a function called header compression.<br>
[34]	A radio resource control (RRC) layer is located at a lowermost portion of the L3<br>
layer. The RRC layer is defined only in the control plane, and handles the control of<br>
logical channels, transport channels, and physical channels with respect to setup, re-<br>
configuration, and release or cancellation of radio bearers (RBs). The radio bearer<br>
service refers to a service provided by the second layer (L2) for data transmission<br>
between the terminal and the UTRAN. In general, the setup of the radio bearer refers<br>
to the process of defining the characteristics of a protocol layer and a channel required<br>
for providing a specific data service, as well as respectively setting detailed parameters<br><br>
and operation methods.<br>
[35]	The RLC layer can belong to the user plane or to the control plane depending upon<br>
the type of layer connected at the upper layer of the RLC layer. That is, if the RLC<br>
layer receives data from the RRC layer, the RLC layer belongs to the control plane.<br>
Otherwise, the RLC layer belongs to the user plane.<br>
[36]	The different possibilities that exist for the mapping between the radio bearers and<br>
the transport channels are not always possible. The UE/UTRAN deduces the possible<br>
mapping depending on the UE state and the procedure that the UE/UTRAN is<br>
executing. The different states and modes are explained in more detail below.<br>
[37]	The different transport channels are mapped onto different physical channels. For<br>
example, the RACH transport channel is mapped on a given PRACH, the DCH can be<br>
mapped on the DPCH, the FACH and the PCH can be mapped on the S-CCPCH, the<br>
DSCH is mapped on the PDSCH and so on. The configuration of the physical channels<br>
is given by an RRC signaling exchange between the RNC and the UE.<br>
[38]	The RRC mode refers to whether there exists a logical connection between the RRC<br>
of the terminal and the RRC of the UTRAN. If there is a connection, the terminal is<br>
said to be in RRC connected mode. If there is no connection, the terminal is said to be<br>
in idle mode. Because an RRC connection exists for terminals in RRC connected<br>
mode, the UTRAN can determine the existence of a particular terminal within the unit<br>
of cells, for example which cell or set of cells the RRC connected mode terminal is in,<br>
and which physical channel the UE is listening to. Thus, the terminal can be effectively<br>
controlled.<br>
[39]	In contrast, the UTRAN cannot determine the existence of a terminal in idle mode.<br>
The existence of idle mode terminals can only be determined by the core network.<br>
Specifically, the core network can only detect the existence of idle mode terminals<br>
within a region that is larger than a cell, such as a location or a routing area. Therefore,<br>
the existence of idle mode terminals is determined within large regions. In order to<br>
receive mobile communication services such as voice or data, the idle mode terminal<br>
must move or change into the RRC connected mode. The possible transitions between<br>
modes and states are shown in Figure 5.<br>
[40]	A UE in RRC connected mode can be in different states, such as a CELL_FACH<br>
state, a CELL_PCH state, a CELLJDCH state or a URA_PCH state. Depending on the<br>
states, the UE listens to different channels. For example a UE in CELLJDCH state will<br>
try to listen (amongst others) to DCH type of transport channels, which comprises<br>
DTCH and DCCH transport channels, and which can be mapped to a certain DPCH.<br>
The UE in CELL_FACH state will listen to several FACH transport channels which<br>
are mapped to a certain S-CCPCH physical channel. The UE in PCH state will listen to<br>
the PICH channel and to the PCH channel, which is mapped to a certain S-CCPCH<br><br>
physical channel.<br>
[41]	The UE also carries out different actions depending on the state. For example, based<br>
on different conditions, a UE in CELLJFACH will start a CELL Update procedure<br>
each time the UE changes from the coverage of one cell into the coverage of another<br>
cell. The UE starts the CELL Update procedure by sending to the NodeB a Cell Update<br>
message to indicate that the UE has changed its location. The UE will then start<br>
listening to the FACH. This procedure is additionally used when the UE comes from<br>
any other state to CELL_FACH state and the UE has no C-RNTI available, such as<br>
when the UE comes from the CELL_PCH state or CELL_DCH state, or when the UE<br>
in CELL_FACH state was out of coverage.<br>
[42]	In the CELL_DCH state, the UE is granted dedicated radio resources, and may ad-<br>
ditionally use shared radio resources. This allows the UE to have a high data rate and<br>
efficient data exchange. However, the radio resources are limited. It is the re-<br>
sponsibility of the UTRAN to allocate the radio resources amongst the UEs such that<br>
they are efficiently used and ensure that the different UEs obtain the quality of service<br>
required.<br>
[43]	A UE in CELL_FACH state has no dedicated radio resources attributed, and can<br>
only communicate with the UTRAN via shared channels. Thus, the UE consumes few<br>
radio resources. However, the data rate available is very limited. Also, the UE needs to<br>
permanently monitor the shared channels. Thus, UE battery consumption is increased<br>
in the case where the UE is not transmitting.<br>
[44]	A UE in CELL_PCH/URA_PCH state only monitors the paging channel at<br>
dedicated occasions, and therefore minimizes the battery consumption. However, if the<br>
network wishes to access the UE, it must first indicate this desire on the paging<br>
occasion. The network may then access the UE, but only if the UE has replied to the<br>
paging. Furthermore, the UE can only access the network after performing a Cell<br>
Update procedure which introduces additional delays when the UE wants to send data<br>
to the UTRAN.<br>
[45]	Main system information is sent on the BCCH logical channel, which is mapped on<br>
the P-CCPCH (Primary Common Control Physical Channel). Specific system in-<br>
formation blocks can be sent on the FACH channel. When the system information is<br>
sent on the FACH, the UE receives the configuration of the FACH either on the BCCH<br>
that is received on the P-CCPCH or on a dedicated channel. The P-CCPCH is sent<br>
using the same scrambling code as a P-CPICH (Primary Common Pilot Channel),<br>
which is the primary scrambling code of the cell.<br>
[46]	Each channel uses a spreading code as commonly done in WCDMA (Wideband<br>
Code Division Multiple Access) systems. Each code is characterized by its spreading<br>
factor (SF), which corresponds to the length of the code. For a given spreading factor,<br><br>
the number of orthogonal codes is equal to the length of the code. For each spreading<br>
factor, the given set of orthogonal codes, as specified in the UMTS system, are<br>
numbered from 0 to SF-1. Each code can thus be identified by giving its length (i.e.<br>
spreading factor) and the number of the code. The spreading code that is used by the P-<br>
CCPCH is always of a fixed spreading factor 256 and the number is the number 1. The<br>
UE knows about the primary scrambling code either by information sent from the<br>
network on system information of neighboring cells that the UE has read, by messages<br>
that the UE has received on the DCCH channel, or by searching for the P-CPICH,<br>
which is sent using the fixed SF 256 and the spreading code number 0, and which<br>
transmits a fixed pattern.<br>
[47]	The system information comprises information on neighboring cells, configuration<br>
of the RACH and FACH transport channels, and the configuration of MCCH, which is<br>
a channel dedicated for MBMS service. Each time the UE changes cells, it is camping<br>
or in idle mode. When the UE has selected the cell (in CELL_FACH, CELL_PCH or<br>
URA_PCH state), the UE verifies that it has valid system information.<br>
[48]	The system information is organized in SIBs (system information blocks), a MIB<br>
(Master information block) and scheduling blocks. The MIB is sent very frequently<br>
and provides timing information of the scheduling blocks and the different SIBs. For<br>
SIBs that are linked to a value tag, the MIB also contains information on. the last<br>
version of apart of the SIBs. SIBs that are not linked to a value tag are linked to an<br>
expiration timer. The SIBs linked to an expiration timer become invalid and need to be<br>
reread if the time of the last reading of the SIB is larger than an expiration timer value.<br>
The SIBs linked to a value tag are only valid if they have the same value tag as a value<br>
tag broadcast in the MIB. Each block has an area scope of validity, such as a Cell, a<br>
PLMN (Public Land Mobile Network) or an equivalent PLMN, which signifies on<br>
which cells the SIB is valid. A SIB with the area scope "Cell" is valid only for the cell<br>
in which it has been read. A SIB with the area scope "PLMN" is valid in the whole<br>
PLMN. A SIB with the area scope "equivalent PLMN" is valid in the whole PLMN<br>
and equivalent PLMN.<br>
[49]	In general, UEs read the system information when they are in idle mode,<br>
CELL_FACH state, CELL_PCH state or in URA_PCH state of the cell that they have<br>
selected, i.e., the cell that they are camping on. In the system information, the UEs<br>
receive information on the neighboring cells on the same frequency, different<br>
frequencies and different RAT (Radio access technologies). This allows the UEs to<br>
know which cells are candidates for cell reselection.<br>
[50]	The 3GPP system can provide multimedia broadcast multicast service (MBMS).<br>
The 3GPP TSG SA (Service and System Aspect) defines various network elements and<br>
their functions required for supporting MBMS services. A cell broadcast service<br><br>
provided by the prior art is limited to a service in which text type short messages are<br>
broadcast to a certain area. The MBMS service, however, is a more advanced service<br>
that multicasts multimedia data to terminals (UEs) that have subscribed to the cor-<br>
responding service in addition to broadcasting multimedia data.<br>
[51]	The MBMS service is a downward-dedicated service that provides a streaming or<br>
background service to a plurality of terminals by using a common or dedicated<br>
downward channel. The MBMS service is divided into a broadcast mode and a<br>
multicast mode. The MBMS broadcast mode facilitates transmitting multimedia data to<br>
every user located in a broadcast area, whereas the MBMS multicast mode facilitates<br>
transmitting multimedia data to a specific user group located in a multicast area. The<br>
broadcast area signifies a broadcast service available area and the multicast area<br>
signifies a multicast service available area.<br>
[52]	Figure 6 illustrates a process of providing a particular MBMS service, by using the<br>
multicast mode. The procedure can be split into two types of actions, those that are<br>
transparent and those that are not transparent to the UTRAN.<br>
[53]	The transparent actions are described in the following. A user desiring to receive<br>
the MBMS service, first needs to subscribe in order to be allowed to receive MBMS<br>
services, to receive information on MBMS services, and to join a certain set of MBMS<br>
services. A service announcement provides the terminal with a list of services to be<br>
provided and other related information. The user can then join these services. By<br>
joining, the user indicates that the user wants to receive information linked to services<br>
that the user has subscribed to and becomes part of a multicast service group. When a<br>
user is no longer interested in a given MBMS service, the user leaves the service, i.e.,<br>
the user is no longer part of the multicast service group. These actions can be taken by<br>
using any means of communication, i.e., the actions may be done using SMS (Short<br>
Messaging Service), or by Internet access. These actions do not have to necessarily be<br>
done using the UMTS system.<br>
[54]	In order to receive a service for which the user is in a multicast group the following<br>
actions that are not transparent to the UTRAN are executed. The SGSN informs the<br>
RNC about a session start. Then the RNC notifies the UEs of the multicast group that a<br>
given service has started in order to initiate reception of the given service. After having<br>
broadcast the necessary UE actions and eventually the configuration of the PtM bearers<br>
for the given service the transmission of the data starts. When the session stops, the<br>
SGSN indicates the stopped session to the RNC. The RNC in turn initiates a session<br>
stop. The transmission of the service from the SGSN means for the RNC to provide a<br>
bearer service for conveying the data of the MBMS service.<br>
[55]	After the notification procedure, other procedures can be initiated between the UE<br>
and the RNC and the SGSN to enable data transmission, such as RRC connection es-<br><br>
tablishment, connection establishment towards the PS domain, frequency layer<br>
convergence, and counting.<br>
[56]	Reception of an MBMS service may be performed in parallel to the reception of<br>
other services, such as a voice or video call on the CS domain, SMS transfer on the CS<br>
or PS domain, data transfer on the PS domain, or any signaling related to the UTRAN<br>
or PS or CS domain.<br>
[57]	Contrary to the multicast service, for broadcast services, as shown in Figure 7, only<br>
the announcement of the service must be done in a transparent manner. No sub-<br>
scription or joining is needed. Afterwards, the actions that are transparent to the RNC<br>
are the same as for multicast services.<br>
[58]	For MBMS, two additional control channels are introduced. They are the MCCH<br>
and the MICH (MBMS Notification Indicator Channel). As explained above, the<br>
MCCH is mapped on the FACH. The MICH is a new physical channel and is used to<br>
notify users to read the MCCH channel. The MICH is designed to allow the UEs to<br>
perform a DRX (Discontinuous Reception) scheme. DRX allows the reduction of<br>
battery consumption for UEs while allowing the UEs to still be aware of any service<br>
for which a session is starting. The MICH may be used to inform the UE of a change in<br>
a frequency convergence scheme, change of a configuration of a point-to-multipoint<br>
(PtM) bearer, switch between the PtM bearer and a point-to-point (PtP) bearer, etc.,<br>
which all require the MCCH to be read.<br>
[59]	The MCCH channel periodically transmits information about active services, the<br>
configuration of the MTCH, information about frequency convergence, etc. The UE<br>
reads the MCCH information to be able to receive the subscribed services based on<br>
different triggers, i.e., after cell selection/reselection, when the UE is notified for a<br>
given service on MICH, when the UE is notified via the DCCH channel and other<br>
occasions.<br>
[60]	A physical channel, such as a Secondary Common Control Physical Channel<br>
(S-CCPCH), is characterized by certain physical channel parameters, such as a<br>
spreading factor, a spreading code, a coding type, transport block sizes and other<br>
attributes. In general, when the UE needs to listen to the S-CCPCH, the UE is given a<br>
complete set of these physical parameters.<br>
[61]	In one cell, there can exist several S-CCPCH channels. For dedicated services, the<br>
UE is generally only required to read one S-CCPCH channel. In case the UE receives<br>
several S-CCPCH channels, the UE compiles a list of S-CCPCH channels based on<br>
different criteria, such as all S-CCPCH that carry the PICH or all S-CCPCH channels<br>
that carry FACH channels. The S-CCPCH channels may be numbered from 0 to the<br>
number of S-CCPCHs that exist in the cell minus one. Accordingly, a formula may be<br>
produced such that the UE can calculate the number of the entry of the S-CCPCH<br><br>
channel that the UE shall listen to. For example, the number of the entry can be found<br>
by calculating the modulo of the UE identity and the number of S-CCPCHs available,<br>
as shown in Figure 8.<br>
[62]	This method implies that each UE will only listen to one S-CCPCH for the<br>
dedicated services, and that the S-CCPCH that the UE is listening to depends on the<br>
UE identity. As such, the UE will listen to the one S-CCPCH on the cell that the UE<br>
has selected.<br>
[63]	For MBMS, the S-CCPCH channel is also used for transmitting point-to-multipoint<br>
(PtM) data. In certain cases, it is possible that the same MBMS data is sent on different<br>
cells. In case a UE is in between two cells where the same content is sent on S-CCPCH<br>
channels, it is advantageous to use a special physical layer combining scheme between<br>
the two cells, as shown in Figure 9, where the UE takes advantage of the fact that<br>
similar data is transmitted on several cells, which the UE can receive. This increases<br>
the chances of the data being correctly received by the UE.<br>
[64]	Referring to Figure 9, a UE is in between cell 1 and cell 2. Cell 1 uses an S-CCPCH<br>
with configuration 1A, and another S-CCPCH with configuration 1B. Cell 2 uses S-<br>
CCPCHs with configuration 2A and 2B, respectively. In order to use the physical layer<br>
combining scheme, it is necessary to indicate to the UE which S-CCPCH from Cell 1<br>
can be combined with which S-CCPCH from Cell 2.<br>
[65]	In case that an MBMS service is sent on an S-CCPCH channel for which the con-<br>
figuration is already sent in the system information, it is inefficient to send the con-<br>
figuration again if a MTCH is mapped on a FACH of the S-CCPCH. Also, in case that<br>
physical layer combining is used, it is inefficient to repeat sending for each S-CCPCH<br>
configuration of the neighboring cell, the S-CCPCH configurations of the current cell<br>
with which it can be physical layer combined or vice versa.<br>

Mode for Invention<br>
[93]	The present invention relates to a method for referencing a physical channel<br>
carrying point-to-multipoint service data in a wireless communication system. The<br>
present invention utilizes an identifier to reference specific physical channel con-<br>
figurations previously sent to a mobile terminal from a network. By referencing a<br>
specific physical channel configuration already sent by the network and received by<br>
the mobile terminal, instead of sending or receiving the entire channel configuration<br>
again, network and mobile terminal resources are used more efficiently. In one<br>
embodiment, the identifier may reference an entry in a list of physical channel con-<br>
figurations in a specific message. In another embodiment, a physical channel con-<br>
figuration in a first message is first allocated a specific identity. Then, a specific<br>
identifier referencing the specific identity is used in a second message to identify the<br>
physical channel configuration in the first message.<br>
[94]	Referring to Figure 10, a method for referencing physical channels in accordance<br>
with a first embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. A network generates a<br>
specific message comprising at least one physical channel configuration for<br>
transmitting to a mobile terminal. Preferably, the specific message comprises physical<br>
channel configurations of physical channels the mobile terminal may be interested in<br>
receiving, e.g., the specific message comprises physical channel configurations for<br>
physical channels on which MBMS services that the mobile terminal may want to<br>
receive are mapped. Generally, the physical channel configuration is information<br>
related to the characteristics of the physical channel and may include physical channel<br>
parameters, such as spreading factor, spreading code, coding type, transport block size<br>
and other attributes. Thus, the specific message including the physical channel con-<br><br>
figuration is transmitted to the mobile terminal to inform the terminal of the channel<br>
characteristics. The mobile terminal uses the channel characteristics to configure the<br>
reception of the physical channel.<br>
[95]	As shown in Figure 10, a Message 1 is generated by the network to inform the<br>
mobile terminal of physical channel characteristics for configuring the reception of a<br>
physical channel, such as a Secondary Common Control Physical Channel (SCCPCH).<br>
Typically, the SCCPCH is used to carry transport channels, such as Forward Access<br>
Channel (FACH) and Paging Channel (PCH). The Message 1 comprises a plurality of<br>
SCCPCH configurations, which are transmitted to the mobile terminal. Each SCCPCH<br>
configuration is associated with a respective physical channel SCCPCH. The Message<br>
1 may be transmitted to the mobile terminal as a SIB 5 or SIB 6 message sent on a<br>
logical channel BCCH. Alternatively, the Message 1 may be transmitted to the mobile<br>
terminal as an MBMS specific message, such as an "MBMS CURRENT CELL P-T-M<br>
RB INFORMATION" message, or an "MBMS NEIGHBORING CELL P-T-M RB IN-<br>
FORMATION" message, which are sent on a logical channel MCCH. Preferably, the<br>
network organizes the SCCPCH configurations into a list in the Message 1, as shown<br>
in Figure 10.<br>
[96]	Further referring to Figure 10, a Message 2 is generated by the network to also<br>
inform the mobile terminal of physical channel characteristics for configuring the<br>
reception of an SCCPCH. The Message 2 may be transmitted to the mobile terminal as<br>
an MBMS specific message, such as an "MBMS CURRENT CELL P-T-M RB IN-<br>
FORMATION" message, or an "MBMS NEIGHBORING CELL P-T-M RB IN-<br>
FORMATION" message, which are sent on a logical channel MCCH.<br>
[97]	When subsequently informing the mobile terminal of physical channel charac-<br>
teristics, often the network will provide information on a specific SCCPCH for which<br>
the SCCPCH configuration had already been sent to the mobile terminal. Thus, to save<br>
resources, the present invention provides that the Message 2 reference the specific<br>
SCCPCH configuration in the Message 1 rather than re-sending the entire SCCPCH<br>
configuration. Upon receiving the Message 2, the mobile terminal refers to the<br>
SCCPCH configuration in the Message 1 referenced by the Message 2 and configures<br>
the reception of the SCCPCH according to the SCCPCH configuration in the Message<br>
1. As such, the amount of data transmitted from the network and received by the<br>
mobile terminal is reduced. Thus, system resources are saved.<br>
[98]	As shown in Figure 10, the SCCPCH configurations in the Message 1 are<br>
preferably referenced in the Message 2 by an implicit identifier or SCCPCH.Index<br>
number. The Message 2 may contain as many implicit identifiers as the number of<br>
SCCPCH configurations to be referenced in the Message 1. For example, assuming<br>
there are four SCCPCH configurations in the Message 1, such as SCCPCH con-<br><br>
figuration A, B, C and D in Figure 10, there are a maximum of four implicit identifiers<br>
in the Message 2 for referencing the four SCCPCH configurations in the Message 1.<br>
Here, the implicit identifier identifies the entry number of the SCCPCH configuration<br>
in the list of the Message 1.<br>
[99]	As shown in Figure 10, three implicit identifiers in the Message 2 reference three<br>
SCCPCH configurations in the Message 1. Here, SCCPCH Index 3 corresponds to the<br>
fourth entry in the list of SCCPCH configurations in the Message 1. Thus, SCCPCH<br>
Index 0 references SCCPCH configuration D. Similarly, SCCPCH Index 2 corresponds<br>
to the third entry in the list of SCCPCH configurations in the Message 1. Therefore,<br>
SCCPCH Index 2 references SCCPCH configuration C. Also, SCCPCH Index 0<br>
corresponds to the first entry in the list of SCCPCH configurations in the Message 1.<br>
Accordingly, SCCPCH Index 0 references SCCPCH configuration A.<br>
[100]	Referring to Figure 11, a method for referencing physical channels in accordance<br>
with a second embodiment of the present invention is illustrated.<br>
[101]	As shown in Figure 11, a Message 1 is generated by the network to inform the<br>
mobile terminal of physical channel characteristics for configuring the reception of an<br>
SCCPCH. The Message 1 comprises a plurality of SCCPCH configurations, which are<br>
transmitted to the mobile terminal. Each SCCPCH configuration is associated with a<br>
respective physical channel SCCPCH that the mobile terminal is interested in<br>
receiving. The Message 1 may be transmitted to the mobile terminal as a SIB 5 or SIB<br>
6 message sent on a logical channel BCCH. Alternatively, the Message 1 may be<br>
transmitted to the mobile terminal as an MB MS specific message, such as an "MB MS<br>
CURRENT CELL P-T-M RB INFORMATION" message, or an "MBMS<br>
NEIGHBORING CELL P-T-M RB INFORMATION" message, which are sent on a<br>
logical channel MCCH. Preferably, the network allocates a configuration identifier or<br>
Id number to each SCCPCH configuration in the Message 1.<br>
[102]	Further referring to Figure 11, a Message 2 is generated by the network to also<br>
inform the mobile terminal of physical channel characteristics for configuring the<br>
reception of an SCCPCH. The Message 2 may be transmitted to the mobile terminal as<br>
an MBMS specific message, such as an "MBMS CURRENT CELL P-T-M RB IN-<br>
FORMATION" message, or an "MBMS NEIGHBORING CELL P-T-M RB IN-<br>
FORMATION" message, which are sent on a logical channel MCCH.<br>
[103]	When subsequently informing the mobile terminal of physical channel charac-<br>
teristics, often the network will provide information on a specific SCCPCH for which<br>
the SCCPCH configuration had already been sent to the mobile terminal. Thus, to save<br>
resources, the present invention provides that the Message 2 reference the specific<br>
SCCPCH configuration in the Message 1 rather that re-sending the entire SCCPCH<br>
configuration. Upon receiving the Message 2, the mobile terminal refers to the<br><br>
SCCPCH configuration in the Message 1 referenced by the Message 2 and configures<br>
the reception of the SCCPCH according to the SCCPCH configuration in the Message<br>
1. As such, the amount of data is transmitted from the network and received by the<br>
mobile terminal is reduced. Thus, system resources are saved.<br>
[104]	As shown in Figure 11, the SCCPCH configurations in the Message 1 are<br>
preferably referenced in the Message 2 by an explicit identifier or SCCPCH Iden-<br>
tification (Id) number. The Message 2 may contain as many explicit identifiers as the<br>
number of SCCPCH configurations to be referenced in the Message 1. For example,<br>
assuming there are four SCCPCH configurations in the Message 1, such as SCCPCH<br>
configuration A, B, C and D in Figure 11, there are a maximum of four explicit<br>
identifiers in the Message 2 for referencing the four SCCPCH configurations in the<br>
Message 1. Here, the explicit identifier identifies the specific identity of an SCCPCH<br>
configuration found in the Message 1 by referencing the Id number allocated to the<br>
SCCPCH configuration by the network.<br>
[105]	As shown in Figure 11, three explicit identifiers in the Message 2 reference three<br>
SCCPCH configurations in the Message 1. The SCCPCH configurations have been<br>
randomly allocated specific Id numbers by the network. In order to reference an<br>
SCCPCH configuration in the Message 2, the specific Id number is used. Here,<br>
SCCPCH configuration A is allocated Id 6, SCCPCH configuration C is allocated Id 5<br>
and SCCPCH configuration D is allocated Id 2. Therefore, the Message 2 may<br>
explicitly identify a configuration in the Message 1 by referencing the specific Id<br>
number allocated to the configuration.<br>
[106]	The method of the second embodiment of the invention is advantageous in the event<br>
the entry positions of the configurations in the Message 1 change. For example, if the<br>
entry position of SCCPCH configuration A in the Message 1 of Figure 11 was moved<br>
from a first position to a third position on the list as a result of a new configuration<br>
being added to the Message 1, the specific Id 6 allocated to SCCPCH configuration A<br>
would remain the same. Thus, when the Message 2 references SCCPCH configuration<br>
A, the Message 2 continues to use the specific Id 6. Hence, the Message 2 does not<br>
need to change the identifier used to reference the configuration as a result of the con-<br>
figuration having its entry position changed in the Message 1. Preferably, this method<br>
can be used when a service is transmitted on an SCCPCH that is listed in SIB 5 or SIB<br>
6 to reference the SIB defined there. This method can also be used to indicate<br>
SCCPCHs available in neighboring cells with which SCCPCHs of the current cell can<br>
be combined with.<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
METHOD FOR REFERENCING AT LEAST ONE PHYSICAL CHANNEL<br>
CARRYING POINT-TO-MULTIPOINT SERVICE DATA IN A WIRELESS<br>
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
The present invention relates to a method for referencing a physical channel point-to-<br>
multipoint service data in a wireless communication system. The present invention<br>
utilizes an identifier to reference specific physical channel configurations previously sent<br>
to a mobile terminal from a network. The identifier may reference an entry in a list of<br>
physical channel configuration in a specific message. Alternatively, a physical channel<br>
configuration in a first message is first allocated a specific identity. Then, a specific<br>
identifier referencing the specific identity is used in a second message to identify the<br>
physical channel configuration in the first message.</td>
