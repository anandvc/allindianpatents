				<td>The present invention involves die fields of genetic engineering, plant<br>
5 breeding, grain processing, and animal nutrition. The present invention relates to a<br>
novel high tryptophan soybean meal to be used as an ingredient in animal feeding<br>
operations.<br>
Animal species raised for meat Jack the ability to manufacture a number of<br>
•• amino acids and tlierefore are required to obtain these amino acids from their d;^et,<br>
10 The amino acids which must be obtained from the diet are referred to as essential<br>
amino acids. Plants are able to synthesize all twenty of the essential amino acids and<br>
therefore serve as the primaiy source of these amino acids for animals. Tryptophan is<br>
one of these essential amino acids, and at the same time, is unden-epresented in the<br>
amino acid profile of many feed ingredients.<br>
15 Economical sources of protein, such as, by-products from the com milling and<br>
animal rendering plants, are commonly used in animal feeds. Examples of these types<br>
"of by-products Include corn gluten meal, distiller's grains with solubles, meat and<br>
bone meal, feather meal, and poultry meal. Unfortunately, the tryptophan content in<br>
these by-products is deficient for various animal requirements, and therefore limits the<br>
20 amounts that may be used in certain feed formulations.<br>
Soybean meal is one of the major ingredients of animal feed that provides<br>
protein and essential amino acids. Vv'hen soybean meal is formulated in feed rations,<br>
the inclusion rate is typically calculated based on satisfying the most limiting essential<br>
amino acid. This limiting essential amino acid is typically tryptophan, resulting in the<br>
25 remaining essential amino acids being formulated in excess of dietary requirements-<br>
The excess amino acids end up as waste. The need therefore exists to provide<br>
soybean meals with higher concentrations of tryptophan.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention described herein relates to a high tryptophan content<br>
30 soybean meal derived from the processing of one or more soybeans having a high<br>
total tryptophan content. The present invention includes the use of a high tryptophan<br>
content soybean jneal in the animal feed industry.<br>
2<br>
Thus, m a first aspect, the present invention is directed to a soybean meal<br>
having a total tryptophan content greater than about 0.78 weight percentage on a dry<br>
matter basis (wt.%), wherein no exogenous tryptophan has been added. In one<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the soybean mea! has at least about O.IO wt.%<br>
51. free tryptophan. In another embodiment the soybean meal has at least about 0.43<br>
wt.% free tryptophan. In a further embodiment, the soybean meal has a protein<br>
content of at least about 44 wt.% or higher. In addition the soybean meal may further<br>
have a protein bound tryptophan content comprising transgenlcally modified protein,<br>
wherein the transgenlcally modified protein contains at least 8 wt.% tryptophan<br>
10 residues.<br>
The present invention relates to a method of making a soybean meal having at<br>
least about 0,78 wt.% total tryptophan comprising; introducing into regenerable cells<br>
« '• of a soybean plant a trahsgene comprising an isolated nucleic acid molecule encoding<br>
an enzyme in the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway, wherein the isolated nucleic acid<br>
15 molecule is operably linked to a promoter functional in a plant cell, to yield<br>
transformed plant cells; and regenerating a plant from said transformed plant cells<br>
wherein the cells of the plant express the enzyme encoded by the isolated nucleic acid<br>
molecule in an amount effective to increase the tryptophan content in the soybean<br>
grain of the plant relative to the tryptophan content in the grain of an untransformed<br>
20 soybean plant of the same genetic background; and producing a soybean meal from<br>
the grain of the transformed plant,<br>
In one aspect of the present invention the method includes a transgene which<br>
encodes a monomeric anthranjiate synthase comprising an anthraniiate synthase alpha<br>
domain and an anthraniiate synthase beta domain. The method further includes a<br>
25 transgene that encodes a feedback insensitive maize anthraniiate synthase alphasubunit.<br>
The method frirther includes any of the transgenes that encode<br>
phosphoribosylanthranilate transferase, phosphoribosylanthranilate isomcrase, indolet<br>
3-phosphate synthase, or tryptophan synthase.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention is directed to a method of producing a<br>
30 high tryptophan content soybean meal comprising: a) selecting soybean grain having<br>
a total tiyptopJian content of greater than about 0,65 wt.%; and b) extracting an oil<br>
from said grain to produce a soybean meal. In one embodiment of the present<br>
3<br>
invention, the method of producing a high tryptophan content soybean meal may also<br>
use a soybean grain having a free tryptophan of greater than about 0,15 •wt.%.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention is directed to incorporating the<br>
soybean meal into animal feed, including feed for animal producer, feed for<br>
5 companion animals, and feed for aquacuiture. The soybean meal of the present<br>
invention is also useftil as a fermentation feed source.<br>
I.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention is directed to a high tryptophan<br>
content, fiill fat soybean meal for use in animal feeds, The high tryptophan content,<br>
fill! fat soybean meal may optionally be extruded.<br>
10 In another aspect, the present invention is directed to a high tryptophan<br>
content soybean isolate or soybean protein concentrate.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention describes a new feed ingredient, a high tryptophan<br>
^ content soybean meal. The meal of the present invention is useful in animal feeding<br>
15 operations, as an aquacuiture feed source and as a component of a fermentation<br>
media.<br>
The following de/mitions are used herein;<br>
Exogenous Tryptophan: Tryptophan that is not an intrinsic part of the soybean<br>
from which the soybean meal has been produced, Exogenous tryptophan may be<br>
20 '• added to the meal or to the feed, in order to increase the concentration.<br>
Free Tryptophan: Tryptophan in the free acid form and not part of an<br>
oligopeptide, polypeptide, or protein, i<br>
Full Fat Soybean Meal; A soybean product, produced similar to .soybean<br>
meal, except omitting the oil extraction step.<br>
25 Protein Content: Weight percentage of protein contained in soybean seeds or<br>
soybean meal.<br>
Soybean Meal: A feed ingredient that is a product of processing soybean<br>
"grain. The phrase "soybean meal", as used herein, refers to a'defatted, desolventized,<br>
toasted, and ground soybean materia!,<br>
30 Soybean Protein Isolate: A preparation from soybean grain made by removing<br>
the majority .of non-protein components and containing not less than 90% protein on a<br>
moisture-fi^ee basis. '<br>
4<br>
Soybean Protein Concentrate: A preparation from soybean grain made by<br>
'• removing most of the oil and water soluble non-protein constituents and containing<br>
not less than about 65% protein on a moisture-free basis.<br>
Transgenc: A nucleic acid molecule, including at least a pronnoter sequence, a<br>
5 coding region, and a transcription termination sequence, inserted into the genome of a<br>
cell via gene splicing techniques.<br>
Total Tiyptophan Content: The sum of free tryptophan and protein bound<br>
tryptophan contents.<br>
Free Tryptophan Content: The weight percentage of free tryptophan of the<br>
to ' soybean grain or soybean meal.<br>
Protein Bound Tryptophan Content: The weight percentage of tryptophan that<br>
Is Incorporated into proteins or peptides in the soybean seed or soybean meal. The<br>
phrases "protein bound tryptophan" and "peptide bound tr&gt;'ptophan" arc herein used<br>
interchangeably.<br>
15 High Tryptophan Soybean Varieties<br>
The high tryptophan content soybean meal of the present invention involves<br>
the use of a high tryptophan soybean variety or varieties. There are various methods<br>
of producing a high tryptophan soybean variety.<br>
Tryptophan in soybean grain e.xists in two different forms: protein bound and.<br>
20 free, Technical approaches for increasing the concentration of free tryptophan in<br>
grain include: 1) increasing synthesis, 2) decreasing degradation, or 3) increasing<br>
transport from the site of synthesis to the site of storage. Additionally, tlie<br>
combination of any or all of above approaches can be used to achieve optimal results.<br>
Increased synthesis of tryptophan in soybean plants can be achieved by 1) over<br>
25 expressing a key enzyme or enzymes in the biosyrithetic pathway, or 2) expressing at<br>
least one key enzyme in the biosyntlietic pathway that is less sensitive or insensitive<br>
to the feedback inhibition as compared to the corresponding endogenous enzyme.<br>
Examples of these methods are described in US, Patent Publication Nos.<br>
2003/0097677 and 2003/0213010, iiereln incorporated by reference.<br>
30 Decreased degradation of tryptophan can be achieved by 1) reducing the<br>
amount of the enzyme(s) responsible for degradation, or 2) reducing the effectiveness<br>
of the degradation enzymes by expressing aninhibitor of that enzyme; or 3) by<br>
expressing a mutant form of the degradation enzyme that would competitively inhibit<br>
5 ^<br>
I,<br>
the activity of tiie native enzyme. The amount of tiie enzyme may be reduced by gene<br>
suppression techniques such as antisense suppression, sense co-suppression, RNA<br>
interference, or other techniques well known in the art.<br>
Plants possess multiple forms of amino acid transporters characterized<br>
5 according to their specificity for, or affinity lo. individual amino acids. Over<br>
expression of a tryptophan transporter or expression of a more effective tryptophan<br>
transporter would facilitate transport of tryptophan from the plastJds to other<br>
compartments such as cytosohc space, extra cellular space, or vacuoles. See, for<br>
example, U.S. Patent Publication No. 2003/0188332.<br>
10 Protein bound tryptophan can be increased by over expressing a storage<br>
protein that contains a high level of tryptophan. The high tryptophan protein can be a<br>
native protein or a modified form of a native protein. Examples of these methods are<br>
disclosed in PCT Applications WO 98/45458, WO 98/20133, and WO 99/29882.<br>
Additionally, protein bound tryptophan can be increased on a weight<br>
1S percentage basis by increasing the overall concentration of protein in soybean grain,<br>
relative to other components such as carbohydrate and lipid. High protein soybeans<br>
can be obtained fay screening the natural germplasm of* soybeans or mutant<br>
populations of soybeans.<br>
Another method of increasing protein bound tryptophan is to suppress the<br>
20 expression of native storage proteins that are inherently low in'tryptophan. In this<br>
method, the amino acid composition of the grain changes in favor of higher levels of<br>
tryptophan as compared to a non-suppressed parental line. An example of this<br>
method, as specifically applied to corn, but applicable to soybeans, is disclosed in<br>
U.S. Patent 6,326,527,<br>
25 A further method of increasing protein bound tryptophan in soybeans is to<br>
engineer the nucleic acid sequences encoding a major storage protein by substituting<br>
tryptophan codons in place of those coding for other amino acids. The resulting<br>
expressed protein, tlios, has higher levels of tryptophan, thereby increasing the total<br>
tryptophan level in the plant. An example of this method is disclosed in U.S. Patent<br>
30 Publication No. 2003/0200558.<br>
In yet another method, free tryptophan levels can be increased in a target<br>
tissue, and at the same time, a complementary protein sink can be created, which<br>
6<br>
results in an increase in protein bound tryptophan. An example of this method is<br>
described in U.S. Patent 6,080,913,<br>
One of ordinary skill in tlie art will recognize that other methods of producing<br>
• a soybean grain having high tryptophan content exist, and may be used to generate the<br>
5 high tryptophan content soybean meal of the present invention. .<br>
Soybean Processing and Products<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, high tryptophan soybeans arc processed<br>
into high tryptophan content soybean meal. IMany methods are Icnqwn for the<br>
processing of raw soybeans into soybean meal. The high tryptophan content soybean<br>
10 meal of the present invention may be prepared using these methods to process high<br>
tryptophan soybean grain.<br>
Illustrative processes for soybean meal preparation include those taught in<br>
U.S. Patents 4,992,294; 5.225,230; 5,773,051; and 5,866,192. Typically, commercial<br>
soybean processes start with the step of receiving the soybeans from the field by any<br>
15 conventional transport means. The soybeans are typically received in a dirty and<br>
often wet condition and may be cleaned with a vibrating screen. In this step the<br>
soybeans are separated from non-soybean material, for example, rocks, sticks, leaves,<br>
stems, dirt, weed seeds, and unwanted fragments of soybeans. The cleaned soybeans,<br>
in combination witli the loose hulls that are not removed by the vibrating screen, are<br>
20 transferred to an aspirator in which most of the remaining loose hulls are removed by<br>
air, The soybeans are then transferred to storage, and the removed loose hulls are<br>
collected as a by-product for further processing.<br>
At this point in the processing, the soybeans typically contain about 12%<br>
water, but the actual water content of the soybeans may vary based on a host of<br>
25 different factors. If tlie water content of the soybeans is in excess of about 12%, then<br>
the soybeans may be subjected to a drj'ing step to reduce the water content below<br>
about 12% prior to placing in storage. The control of the water content is essential to<br>
prevent mold and microbial contamination during storage.<br>
The processing procedures from this point forward may vary depending upon<br>
30 the desired end products. For example, the soybeans may be first dehulled using such<br>
conventional equipment as cracking roils or hammer mills in combination with a<br>
conventional aspiration system. Alternatively, the hulls may not be removed prior to<br>
furtlier processing. See, for example, U.S. Patent 5,225,230. In order to deactivate<br>
7<br>
antinutritional factors, such as trypsin inhibitors, the soybeans may be subjected to<br>
For cracking processes, clean, dry, whole soybeans are fed to coarsely<br>
corrugated roller mills or "crackers." These crackers can have one or more sets of<br>
5 rolls. Soybean pieces, called "cracks," are formed. The goal of the cracking step is to<br>
maximize the pieces that are 1/4"* to l/S"* the size of the starting soybean, and to<br>
minimize the formation of fines, which are pieces less than 1 mm in diameter.<br>
From the cracking milts, particles ot"whole soybeans (cracks) are conveyed to<br>
multistage aspiration dehulling systems, which typically employ 1 to 3 stages. Bach<br>
10 stage consists of an aspirator and a size screening system. At each stage, the fiberrich<br>
hulls are first removed by means of a coimtercurrent air stream and a cyclone.<br>
The heavier, fiber-lean, meats fraction is conveyed to a screening system that removes<br>
at least one additional fraction by size, and yields one stream for fiirther aspiration.<br>
Alternatively, screening can be employed prior to aspiration. The "hulls" stream is<br>
15 typically combined with other soybean byproducts and used as an animal feed<br>
ingredient. The once dehuUed meats are then dehulled a second time to bring them to<br>
less than about 3% crude fiber (4.28% crude fiber on a defatted, dry basis) using a 2<br>
stage commercial pre-extraction process. However, the single stage systems can also<br>
be employed to yield meats.<br>
20 The resulting meats are then heat conditioned, such as in a rotary or stack<br>
cooker. The residence times of the cracks are typically between about 20 and about<br>
40 minutes. Discharge temperatures typically are in the range of about 120 to 180°F.<br>
Lower conditioning temperatures may be employed if a greater fines production in tlie<br>
flaker is tolerable.<br>
25 The conditioned meats are then fed to smooth roller mills called flakers. A<br>
force of greater than about 500 IcPa-gaugc (72.5 psig) is typically applied to the rolls.<br>
Flake thicltnesses of less than about 0,75 nun (0.030") are preferably produced' in<br>
order to obtain maximum oil recovery in the subsequent oil extraction,step.-<br>
Optionaily, the cracking and dehulling steps are eliminated, or done subsequent to the<br>
30 conditioning step. An additional option would be to expand a percentage of the<br>
flaked soybeans to form "collets" prior to oil extraction. Other process variations<br>
include conditioning prior to the cracking step, and eliminating the dehulling step<br>
prior to oil extraction. A soybean meal of the present invention produced In a process<br>
8<br>
'•• having the variation of eliminating the dehulling step would be considered a high<br>
tryptophan and high fiber soybean nicaJ, This product could be a specialty feed<br>
ingredient in a swine production operation.<br>
The next step iii the process of generating soybean meal is the extraction of<br>
5 oil. This extraction step is typically done using a lipophilic solvent, but may also be<br>
done by mechanical extraction. In tiiis process, the soybean meal is contacted with a<br>
suitable solvent (e.g., hexane) to remove tlie oil to a content of typically less than<br>
about 1% by weight. One example of a conventional solvent extraction procedure is<br>
. ' described in U.S. Patent 3.721.569.<br>
10 However, if a "full fat" soybean meal is desired.then the oil bearing meal is<br>
not subjected, to oil (also known as fat or lipid) extraction. In this embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the resulting product would be a high tryptophan content, full fat<br>
soybean meal. '<br>
At this stage, the solvent extracted, defatted soybean meal tj^pically contains<br>
15 about 30% solvent by weight. Prior to being used as an animal feed, the meal is<br>
typically processed through a desolventizer-toaster 03T) to remove the residua!<br>
solvent and to heat the protein fraction sufficient to inactivate trypsin inhibitors and<br>
other naturall)' occurring toxicants (antifeedants). Typically, steam contacts the<br>
soybean meal and the Itcat of vaporization released fi'om the condensing steam<br>
20 vaporizes the solvent, which is subsequently recovered and recycled.<br>
As an alternative to solvent extraction, the soybean meal is defatted<br>
mechanically using, for example, a screw piess. This mechanioally extracted or<br>
"expeller" soybean meal typically contains between about4 ind about 8% residual oil.<br>
If the intended use of the meal is as a feed supplement for ruminants, then the meal<br>
25 may first be heated and dried in a specified hianner, such as that taught in U.S; Patent<br>
5,225,230, before oil is extracted mechanically. The defatted soybean meal is then<br>
dried and typicaUy ground or pelletized, and then milled into a physical .state suitable<br>
for use as a food supplement (jr as an animal feed.<br>
Further processing of the soybean or the meal may optionally be done to make<br>
30 the resulting feed more palatable, available, and/or digestible in animals. These<br>
processes include addition of enzymes or nutrients, and heat treatment of the meal.<br>
Additionally, further processing may be done to the nseal, such as pelleting, to make it<br>
more compact and dense in distribution.<br>
9<br>
Further processing of the soybean mea! can produce soybean floxir, soybean<br>
protein concentrates, and soybean protein isolates that have food, feed, and industrial<br>
uses. The high tryptophan content soybean mea! of the present invention can be<br>
further processed into any of the products described below.<br>
5 Soybean flours are produced simply by grinding and screening the defatted<br>
soybean meol. Soybean protein concentrates, having at least about 65 wt.% protein,<br>
are made by removing soluble carbohydrate material from defatted soybean meal.<br>
Aqueous alcohol extraction (60-80% ethanoi in water) or acid leaching at the<br>
'•• isoelectric pH 4.5 of the protein are ll)e most common methods bf removing the<br>
3 0 soluble carbohydrate fraction. A myriad of applications ha,ve been developed for<br>
soybean protein concentrates and texturized concentrates in processed foods, meat,<br>
poultry, fish, cereal, and dairy systems, any of which can be employed with the high<br>
tryptophan content soybean mea! of the present invention.<br>
Soybean protein isolates are preferaljly produced through standard chemical<br>
15 isolation, drawing the protein out of the defatted soybean flake tlirough solubilization<br>
(alkaft extraction at pH 7-10) and separation followed by isoelectric precipitation. As<br>
' a result, isolates are at least about 90 wt.% protein. They are sometimes high in<br>
sodium and minerals (ash content), a property that can limit their application. Their<br>
major applications have been in dairy substitution, as in infant formulas and milk<br>
20 replacers.<br>
Soybean flours are often used in the man\ifacturt«g of meat extenders and<br>
analogs, pet foods, baking ingredients, and other food products. Food products made<br>
fi^om soybean flour and isolate include baby food, candy products, cereals, foocl<br>
drinks, noodles, yeast, beer, ale, and the like.<br>
25 • One of skill in the art v/ili recognize that variations in the above described<br>
procedures may be made without departing from the spirit of the present invention.<br>
The hightryptophan content soybean meal of the present invention can be fiirther<br>
processed into any of the products described above.<br>
Feed Formulations<br>
30 The higii tryptophan content soybean meal of the present invention is used in<br>
various feed formulations, in a preferred embodiment, the hightryptophan conbnt<br>
soybean meal of tiie present invention is used in feed formulations for simple stomach<br>
animals, such as swine and pdultry. Due to the higher tryptophan content of the<br>
10<br>
soybean meal of the present invention, inclusion rates arc commonly reduced as<br>
compared to commodity soybean meal. Use of the soybean meal of the present<br>
invention in feed fonnuktions will reduce or eliminate the need to add exogenous<br>
sources of tryptophan. These characteristics of the soybean meal of the present<br>
5 invention provide the benefit to the animal {jroducer and formulator of having more<br>
options in feed formulation.<br>
Tlie high tryptophan content soybean meal of the present invention allows a<br>
formulatpr to use less expensive ingredients in animal feeds which lowers the feed<br>
cost for animal producers. Shown in the table below is a comparison of broiler<br>
10 grower diets using the high tryptophan content soybean meal of the present invention<br>
(C), a formulation with no animal by-products (A), and a formulation with animal byproducts<br>
(B), As can be seen, by being able to use meat and bope meal (MBM) and<br>
corn gluten meal with the high tryptophan content soybean meal (HT) of the present<br>
'. invention, the cost per ton of feed is reduced 4-6 dollars.<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
This example describes the generation of transgenic high tryptophan soybeans<br>
used to prepare tlie high tryptophan content soybean meal of the present invention.<br>
12<br>
The high tryptophan soybeans designated GM_Ai5238:0015, were generated<br>
as described by Weaver et al (jU.S. Patent PublicBtion No, 2003/0213010, already<br>
incorporated by I'efercnce), Briefly, soybean plants were rransformed with the vector<br>
pMON39325, containing the coding sequence for a feedback insensitive maize<br>
5 antliranilate synthase (AS)<br>
a-subunit driven by a 7S a' promoter. An event containing a high tryptophan level<br>
was selected and numbered GM_A15238, Rl seeds from this event were grown<br>
under greenhouse conditions to generate Rl plants. Using the Invader® Assay,<br>
(Third Wave Technologies, Inc., Madison, WI) identifications of homozygous and<br>
10 heterozygous plants were made. One gene positive homozygous plant<br>
(Gly[_A15238:0015) and one gene negative homozygous piaat (GM_A15238:0017)<br>
were selected and advanced to further generations. The generation of soybean grain<br>
for high tryptophan content soybean meal preparation was executed under the<br>
guidance of USDA regulation for regulated transgenic material {see, for example 7<br>
15 CFR§340).<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
This example sets forth methods of analysis for free and total tryptophan, and<br>
total protein in soybean seeds and meal.<br>
Free Tryptophan<br>
20 Amino acids in the soybean meal are detected using a prc-column primary<br>
amine dcrivatization with o-phthalaldehyde (OPA). The resulting ammo acidadduct,<br>
an isoindole, is hydrophobic and possesses excellent fluorescence characteristics,<br>
which can then be detected on a tluorescence detector, <jsing reverse-phase></jsing>
chromatography, separation is achieved through the hydrophobicity of the R-groups<br>
25 located on each amino acid. To help stabilize the fluorophor, a thiol is added such as<br>
• 2-mercaptoethaiiol or 3-mercaptopropionic acid.<br>
Seed and meal samples are ground to 1 mm screen fineness or finer. Ground<br>
, samples are stored at 5°C prior to analysis. For analysis the samples are brought to<br>
room temperature and then weighed directly into conical centrifuge tubes (2.0 ml<br>
30 capacity). Tlie sample to extraction solvent ratio is equal to or less than 30 mg/ml, A<br>
5% ti-ichloroacetic acid (TCA) solution, (part no.VW3372-l, VWR Scientific, West<br>
13<br>
Chester, PA) is added to each sample and then mixed by vortex for about 30 minutes.<br>
The samples are allowed to sit overnight<br>
(16 hours) to ensure extraction completion. The samples are then mixed by vortex for<br>
about 30 minutes, centrifuged for 30 minutes at 3000 rpm, and the supernatant is<br>
5 saved and stored at<br>
-80°C prior to analysis.<br>
The amino acids are analyzed by HPLC (model 1100, Agilent Technologies,<br>
Inc., Palo Alto, CA) with flourescence detection (FLD) and a Zorbax Eclipse-AAA,<br>

EXAMPLE 3<br>
This example sets forth the production of soybean meal k the pilot plant scale.<br>
Ijhe soybean meal of the present invention, used in the feeding trials described<br>
herein, was prepared at a pilot plant scale, by a solvent extraction process.<br>
10 The high tryptophan soybeans, GM_A15238:0015 (descHbed in Example 1),<br>
as well as the parental line A4922 (Asgrow peed Company, Des Moines, lA), and the<br>
negative transgcnlo "tsoline, GM_A15238:0017, were cleaned and then dried in a<br>
Behlsn Wicks drier (Behlen Manufacturing Company, Columbus, NE) to between 10<br>
and 10.5% moisture. The cleaned and dried soybeans were then stored in covered,<br>
] 5 portable bins for 1 -3 days to allow the meats to loosen from the hulls. The beans were<br>
then fed into a single strand Ferreli-Ross (A. T. Ferrell Company Inc., Bluffton, IN)<br>
cracking mill. TTie cracking rolls operated at ambient temperature at a gap setting of<br>
8, corresponding to 1.9 mm. TUe rolls operated at a differential speed ratio of 1.5:1<br>
with the slower roll running at 700 ppm.<br>
20 The cracks produced from the cracking mills were conveyed to a multistage<br>
aeromechanica! dehulling system (Kice Zigzag Aspirator, Kice Industries, Wichita,<br>
KS) to remove the hulls from the meats. The aspirator was operated at an absolute<br>
pressure of 1-2.4 inches of water. The resulting hulls were collected and fed into a<br>
hammer mill, The product from (lie hammer mill was sent to a gravity table where<br>
25 the meat rich fraction was separated from the hulls and collected. The meats cbllccted<br>
this "way were blended with the aspirated cracks fraction (blended meats fraction)<br>
prior to flaking.<br>
The blended meats fraction was then conveyed at 66-IB8 kg/hour to a Scott<br>
Tenderblend conditioner (model number SJC2, Scott Equipment Company, New<br>
30 Prague, MN) and heated to obtain an exit temperature of 55-67°C and moisture<br>
content of 9,5%. The conditioned blended meats fiaction was fed into aRoskamp<br>
flaking roll model 2862 (28" diameter X 62'.; wide, CPM Roslcamp Champion,^<br>
15<br>
«<br>
Waterloo, lA) where they were flaked to a thickness of 0,23-0.36 mm, at 6(fC^ using<br>
a gap setting of 0.010 inch. ,<br>
• The flakes were then fed to a Crown Iron Works model 2 percolation extractor<br>
(Crown Iron Works Co., Roseviile, MN) for oil extraction. The extractor was<br>
5 operated using a residence time of approximately 37 minutes, a hexane to meal weight<br>
ratio of 1:1, and a throughput of approximately 140 kg/hour. The solvent extracted<br>
meal was then conveyed via a Crown Schnecken pre-desolventizer to a two-deck<br>
Crown desolventlzer toaster (DT), Tlie pre-desolventizer was operated under a<br>
pressure'of 0,2 inches of water to provide a discharge temperature of 50°C. Tk^e, DT<br>
10 was operated under the following conditions: the top deck temperature of 91-104'C;<br>
bottom deck temperature of lOMOS^C; and DT vapor temperature of 75 ± 5°C. The<br>
resulting meal had an exit moisture level of 16-19% and a urease level corresponding<br>
toapHriseof0.15±0.5,<br>
The desolventized meal was then dripd to a moisture level of 8.5-9.5% and<br>
15 then hm-nmermilled to a particle size small enough to pass through a 12/64 inch<br>
screen.<br>
Tlie resulting soybean meals were used in stability tests and in broiler feed<br>
trials, described herein below.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
5 This example describes the stability determination of free tryptophan in the<br>
high tryptophan content soybean meal of the present invention, during processing and<br>
• storage.<br>
The high tryptophan content soybean meal, described in Examples 3 and 4<br>
above, was used in the stability determinations described herein. Process samples<br>
10 were taken at various stages and analyzed for free tiyptophan, as described in'<br>
Exaraple'2. The analytical results from tliese samples are summarized below in Table<br>
3. The results demonstrate that there is no significant loss of free tryptophan<br>
concentration during the production of high tryptophan content soybean meal. The<br>
finished soybean meal retained about 98% of the initial free tryptophan contained in<br>
15 the soybean grain, when normalized to a defatted, dehuiled, and moisture free basis.<br>
As a comparison, the soybean meal that wa^ subjected to an additional heating time in<br>
the DT step of 90 minutes (overcooked soybean meal), had a significantly lower<br>
concentration of tiyptophan, indicating tliat degradation was possible under more<br>
severe heating conditions,<br>

Stability testing was conducted to determine the stability of the free and total<br>
tryptophan during storage of the meal. Samples of the high tryptophan content<br>
soybean meal, described in Ejcamples 3 and 4 above, were stored at 4*C, 22'C, and<br>
15 38°C, for 6 months in environmental chambers (Enconair Model GC8-2JH1, Enconair<br>
Ecological Chambers Inc., Winnipeg, Mannitoba, Canada). The samples that were<br>
stored at 38°C were also controlled at 60% humidity, A sample of approximately 600<br>
grams high tryptophan content soybean meal was contained in Nalgene jars.<br>
Subsamples were analyzed at the time points specified below in Tables 4 and 5, with<br>
20 each time point analysis being run in duplicate.<br>
The results are shown in Tables 4 and 5, The results indicate that both free<br>
and protein bound tryptopbaii are stable in the high tryptophan content soybean, meal<br>
of the present invention, over 6 months, even at elevated temperatures (SS^C).<br>

5 EXAMPLE 6<br>
This example describes a broiler feeding study using a high tryptophan content<br>
• soybean meal produced as described in Example 3.<br>
A feeding study was performed using a randomized block design comprising 7<br>
dietary treatments and 10 replicates per treatment. The treatments, analysis of the two<br>
10 soybean meals, and the feed formulations used in the study are described in Tables 6<br>
throBgh 8. Seventy PeterSime (Zulte, Belgium) cages in 3 batteries were divided into<br>
10 blocks (replicates). The blocks were distributed in such a way that the position and<br>
level of the cages withiii each battery was a blocking factor. A total of 3fiO male<br>
broilers (birds) of the strain Ross 308 (Welp Hatchery, Bancroft, lA) were used in this<br>
15 21 day trial.<br>
When the birds were 7 days of age, they were weighed, randomly assigned to<br>
pens, and-the test was initiated. The birds had ad libitum access to water and feed<br>
throughout the growing period. Mash diets were used across all age periods.<br>

Body weight and feed intake measurements were recorded at approximately<br>
5 day 7,14,21, and 28 of the trial to allow for calculation of average daily gain, feed<br>
intake, and feed to gain ratio during the 7-14,14-21,21-28, and overall periods.<br>
Mortality was also recorded throughout the trial.<br>
,, The room temperature was controlled at 90 ± 2"? at day 1 and then decreased<br>
1°F each day until the end of the trial, with daily highs and lows recorded. There was<br>
10 a 23 hour lighting used for the entii-e experiment with I hour dark ptriod-from<br>
midniglit to 1:00 am. Each pen housed 6 birds with a growing density of 0,58 square<br>
foot per bird at the start of the trial.<br>
Table 9 shows the factorial analysis of broiler performance data using<br>
treatments 2 to 7. For comparison purposes, the average performance of control is<br>
15 also listed. Average trends are very similar among testing periods. Results of? to 28<br>
. days of age indicate that there were significant differences for feed:gain ratio between<br>
the main effects of soybean meal level (P value 
20<br>
*<br>
I<br>
formulated to have tryptophan as the first limiting nutrient, the positive response of<br>
performance due to increasing SBM levels could be attributed to the increased<br>
tryptophan content, Performance averages among the main effect of tryptophan<br>
source confirms this conclusion. Treatments of parental SBM plus free tryptophan<br>
5 (P+T, Treatments 4 and 5) and positive tryptophan isoline SBM (HT, Treatments 6<br>
and 7) had the same amount of dietary tryptophan, and their performances were very<br>
shnilar (0-28d feedrgain ratios of 1.611 and 1.624 for P+T and HT, respectively).<br>
However, birds fed parental SBM diets (Treatments 2 and 3), which contained a lower<br>
level of tryptophan, gave a significantly poorer performance (0-28d feed;gain ratio of<br>
10 1.801). The results of the trial further indicate that the tryptophan in the transgenic<br>
high tryptophan meal (HT) is identical lo the synthetic tryptophan supplied<br>
exogenously (P+T), with respect to bird performance.<br>

5 EXAMPLE? •<br>
This example describes the generation of high tryptophan, high protein<br>
soybean varieties useful in preparing the high tryptophan content soybean meal of the<br>
present invention. ,,<br>
Soybeans, at the R3 generation, that are homozygous for the maize<br>
10 anthraniiate synthase a gene (described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2003/0213010)<br>
were cro.ssed to a high protein soybean variety EXP3103REN (described in PCT<br>
Application PCT/US05/002503) to produce Fl seed. Th^ resulting Fl seed was<br>
planted and grown to maturity to produce F2 seed. The resulting F2 seed was,planted<br>
and resulting plants were genotyped with respect to glyphosate resistance and<br>
22<br>
tryptophan content, Plants identified as heterozygous for the glyphosate resistance<br>
and high tryptophan genes were cuiled. 'The resulting F2:3 seed was collected in a<br>
single plant harvest and analyzed tor free tryptophan (described in Example 2 above),<br>
total protein and total oil content using raethodologies well known in the art. The<br>
5 results of the F2:3 selections indicate that the high tryptophan phenotype is expressed<br>
in a high protein germplasm, at approximately the expected frequency, while<br>
maintaining the acceptable oil level (Table 10),<br>

A single line from each of the events described in Table 10 were advanced to<br>
field trials to evaluate seed composition, tolerance to glyphosate herbicide and general<br>
agronomics. The field trials utilized a randomized spilt plot design with duplicates of<br>
the following 3 glyphosate treatments; no glyphosate, 1.5 lbs glyphosate acid<br>
15 equivalent (ae) /A at V3 and R], and 1,5 lbs glyphosate ae/A at V3 and 3,0 lbs<br>
glyphosate ae/A at HI stage. All plots are harvastedat maturity and subsamples are<br>
analyzed for tryptophan, oil protein, chlorosis, necrosis, plant height, maturity, and<br>
yield. The results of the F2;4 trials confirm the earlier result that the high tryptophan<br>
trait is expressed in the high protein germplasm. Additionally, the results indicate that<br>
20 that tiie presence of the high tryptophan trait does not affect the glyphosate tolerance.<br>
This example provides an adtiitional soybean source for use in generating theJiigh<br>
tryptophan content soybean meat of the present invention. These soybeans are<br>
processed into high tryptophan content soybean meal as described above in Example<br>
3,<br>

reference to the details of preferred embodiments of the present invention, it is to be<br>
23<br>
understood that the disclosure is intended in an illustrative rather than a limiting<br>
