				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates  to a water current meter for measuring water current.<br>
The water current in a water gap for example<br>
a river, canal, or  stream is important entity while<br>
planning a construction of a bridge over the said<br>
water gap.  Therefore, the measurement of water current in a water gap with known  level  of accuracy is an<br>
essential input in final planning of construction of a bridge over the said water  gap.  As  the measurement of water current over the water gap is required in its  stationary mode as well in the mobile mode<br>
that, is with the flow of water stream, the water current<br>
meter is required  to compute the signals received<br>
by the vehicle and across the water  gap against and across the flow of water.<br>
The conventional device for such purpose is a wooden piece and a clock and the method of measuring water current is manually ascertaining time by floating a wooden piece over a specified distance and finding<br>
out the  flow of water stream in a said river or canal.  This  flow of water  is then related to water<br>
current by standard principles, of physics.<br>
Another known  device for measuring water current  comprises the propeller for static application only.  These devices are not capable of measuring water current over the entire water gap and at  serial interfaces.  Such known devices are also not capable  of measuring water current against and across the flow of water,  while the sensor, more particularly a survey device is in mobile mode.<br>
Yet another  known  device for such  purpose is ultrasonic transducers.  The  use of ultrasonic transducers  is  highly  uneconomical.  The instrumentation for such  purpose is highly  sophisticated and require specialised  skill.  This  sophisticated  instrumentation required,  which is  itself  difficult for construction, additionally  add  on to the cost  of bridging, exhorbitently, for the said water  gap.<br>
The known devices are  attended with various disadvantages.  The  known devices  particularly meters<br>
of first and second type cannot measure the water<br>
current over the entire water gap  against add across<br>
the flow of water.  The third type of devices are not<br>
cost effective.<br>
Therefore the main object of this invention is to  propose  a construction  of a water current meter for measuring water current of a river, canal, or water stream from one bank to another<br>
bank across the entire water gap and which obviates the  disadvantages  associated with the prior art.<br>
Another object of the present  invention is to propose a water current meter capable of measuring the absolute water current from a moving platform across a water..<br>
Yet another object of this  invention is to propose a water current meter for measuring water current in a river canal, lake or water stream over  the water gap which transmits the measured water current to output port, which is recorded on a recorder of the meter.<br>
A further object of this invention is to propose a water current meter for measuring water current of a water gap which is portable and easy to operate.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a water current meter for measuring the water current comprising a sensor (1) secured with a rotatkble hanging device (2) adapted to be clamped with a vehicle, said sensor (1) being connected with a central processing unit (7) disposed in a cabinet (8) adapted to be mounted on to said vehicle.<br>
In accordance with this invention the water current meter has a sensor secured with a<br>
special rigid rotatable hanging device, which gives number of pulses proportional to the<br>
flow. The rotatable hanging device is clamped to the vehicle by locking clamp. The<br>
hanging device enables the said sensor to rotate through 360 degree and align with the<br>
flow of water. The sensor rotates due to the resultant flow between the vehicle<br>
movement and water velocity and this flow is called VR. The number of pulses from the<br>
sensor are counted on the counter of the process unit of the present device and these are<br>
calibrated to give the flow of water of river or canal. The square	<br><br>
of the  signal is substracted from the square  root<br>
of this  value ia the absolute water current<br>
Vw  which is  displayed on  the water current meter.<br>
A water current meter for measuring a water surrenr. according to a preferred embodiment, is<br>
herein described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings  wherein:<br>
Fig.l.  shows  the rotatable hanging device<br>
of the present  invention  having the sensor secured therewith. Fig. 2.  shows the cabinet for accomodating the  processor  unit theirin.<br>
Fig.3.  shows the electronic  block diagram of  the water current.<br>
Referring to the drawings  particularly fig.l<br>
the  water current  meter of the present  invention<br>
has  a sensor  1  secured with a rotatable hanging<br>
device  2 adapted to be clamped with a  vehicle<br>
(not shown) for  example a  ship/boat by means of a  locking  clamp  (not shown).  Tho rotatable<br>
hanging device  2  comprises  a  mounting bracket 3  connected to a  middle section  4 of the hanging  device  2  so 83 to connect the  device 2  with the vehicle.  A  bottom section  5 is rotatably  secured  to the  lower  and  of the middle section  4.  A connecting  plate 6 is  bolted  to the lower section  5 such that to hold  the  sensor -1  therewith.  The sensor-1  is connected with a central processor  unit-7 disposed in a cabinet-8 as shown  in Fig.2~. onnecting terminals-9 are provided on one side oÂ± said cabinet for connecting  power supply, sensor for water flow, vehicle velocity meter etc.  A cover-10 is provided to the cover teh cabinet-8 from the top side.  A glass window  11 ia provided In  the top cover -10 to  see the display screen-12 of the central processor unit-7.<br>
Reference is now mode to fig. 3 which shows the  block diagram of water current meter. A<br>
central processing unit-7 comprises a processor card -13  having a timer -14 connected to a counter-15  provided therein.  A signal conditioner 16  is connected to an input provided with the<br>
counter-15.  The sensor  signal conditioner -16 is connected  to the sensor-1.  The  output ot the counter-15 is fed  to a  processor unit-17  having a sensor  constant multiplier-18 connected  therewith. Outputs are  provide with said  processor 1? for connecting the vehicle velocity device-19 and power supply-20  therewith.  A reset switch-21 is connected to said  processor-17 and is provided for  resetting the water current meter after the use  and for the next operation.  The processor card-13 hns a sensor aonstant~22 and switch bank-23 connected to the output of the sensor constant multiplier -18 thereof.  Tho processor-17 has outputs for connecting the display-21 and aerial interface-25  therewith.  A recorder-26 is connected to the output of the serial  interface  to record the  readings.<br>
The input from the sensor  1 is  received by the signal conditioner-16  and given  to tho counter-15.  Tho rate of count is fixed by the timer-14.  The processor-17  evaluates the flow by calibrating the count per second. This receives number of pulser per second multiplies with sensor constant-22  and then<br>
adds the calibration factor,  the processor has  memory bnk-23 which  keeps the  look-up table  which  gives  relationship between velocity  of water  velocity VR of  flo and number of pulses N and senses multiplying constant A ft colibration factor B. (Ref equation below) .<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Thus  processor has accesses  VR  and roads vehi velocity (Vv)  obtained  thrigh Global position System  mounted on the. vehicle. The  absolute water current is calculated by<br>
following formula  by an  algorithm:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The  output is given  to the display-22 through the display driver, an;;  the same is available on aerial interface 25.  The serial interface-25 of  the  meter provides output of water current reading for recording on to tne recorder (not shown).  The instrument uses MIL  standard connectors for  Power supply-20 sensor-1 and serial interface-25-  These are not inter-changable to avoid incoreect connections.<br><br><br><br><br>
