We , UNITED PHOSPHORUS LIMITED,<br>
a company incorporated under the Companies Act,<br>

The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in<br>
which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a synergistic herbicidal composition containing selective herbicides and improvements in the use of selective herbicides like Pyrazosulfuron ethyl and other herbicide(s) preferably one or more from Butachlor, Pretilachlor and 2,4-D (2,4-dichloro phenoxy acetic acid).<br>
This application is divided out of our application no 553/MUM/2002<br>
In modernized agriculture today, considerable attention is being given to all aspects of crop production, especially to those which concern defence of crops against weeds, diseases and pests. In last few years a spurt in agricultural production is due to the green revolution, increased fertilizer use, crop production, improved irrigation and mfrastructural facilities. The important challenges confronted in the fanning today in the production practices is weed management. This invention is based on the strengths and weaknesses of ones approach in weed control and what better strategies can be adopted to contain their menacing impact on farming. Weed control using chemicals is much older . From 1940 onwards chemicals became the principal tools of weed control in the most developed nations and have been expanding slowly to developing nations ,<br>
Weeds are the plants, which grows where they are not wanted. They grow in the fields where they compete with the crops for water, soil nutrients, light and space and thus reduce crop yields. They also harbour insects, pests and micro-organism. Certain weeds release into the soil the inhibitors or poisonous substances which are harmful to the plants, human beings and live stocks. They increase the expenditure on labour and equipment, render harvesting difficult, and reduces the quality and marketability of the agricultural produce. They block the drainage and impede the flow of the water in canals and water -transport channels and their growth in the rivers renders navigation very difficult. The dense growth of the weeds in water pollutes the water because they deoxygenate the water and kill the fish.<br>
Weeds seeds germinate earlier, their seedlings grow faster, they flower earlier, and form seeds in profusion, and mature ahead of the crop they infest. Weeds have a remarkable capacity to germinate under varied conditions but very characteristically they are season bound and the peak period of the germination always takes place in certain season in the regular succession year after year.<br>
Weeds belongs to the class Angiospermae (flowering plants) which have two subclass : Monocotyledoneae ( monocots) and Dicotyledoneae ( dicots). On the basis of the habitat, they are divided into terrestrial and aquatic categories, and on the basis of the duration of life they are divided into annuals, biennials and perennials. Annuals live and produce their seeds in a single growing season . Biennials need two growing season ; in one season they pass through their vegetative or rosette stage, followed by the reproductive stage in the next season. The multiplication of both the annuals and biennials is through seed. Perennials live indefinitely and are propagated not only through seeds but often vegetatively through underground structures such as rhizomes, stolons, bulbs and tubers. Perennials are of two types the simple and the creeping. The former multiply through seeds. They have no normal means of spreading vegetatively. However, if they are injured or cut, the severed portions produce new plants. Creeping perennials are spread by creeping roots, creeping above ground stems( stolons) and creeping underground stems ( rhizomes).<br><br><br>
In non-irrigated areas, the competition between weeds and crops is largely for water. A saving of 750 to 1250 tonnes of water per hectare of soil, forming a one meter deep column, is possible by keeping the soil free from weeds. In irrigated tracts, the competition is severe for nutrients . The unchecked growth of weeds, in a wheat field measuring one hectare, removes about 20 Kg of Nitrogen , reducing the grain yield by about 12 Quintals. The minerals requirements of weeds are high. Weeds in a fallow land deplete the soil of both moisture and nutrients.<br>
Weeds generate a formidable competition with crop plants for light. One of the secrets behind the high-yield potential of the dwarf varieties of crop plants is that they can capture solar energy more efficiently. Unchecked weed growth in the fields cropped with dwarf variety will intercept solar radiation to detriment of the crop plants. Likewise, the competition that weeds offer to the valuable crop plants may assume, at times , so alarming proportions as to smother the latter. Both the nature of the weed and the crop which they infest, influence the action of weedicides.<br>
Measures against weeds comprise mechanical (cultivation and mowing), cultural or cropping, biological and chemical means. Each of these methods has certain merits and a prudent farmer can make use of one means or a combination of them to control weeds efficiently and economically. The controlling of weeds in the growing crops with weedicide increases their yields and ensure the efficient use of irrigation , fertilizer and plant protection measures.such as the spraying of insecticides and fungicides. The removing of weeds from the growing crop facilitates easy harvesting and gives a high-quality produce without admixture with the weed seeds. Chemical weed control can be adapted in time and in situations and under conditions which make manual, or mechanical weeding difficult. A great advantage of this method lies in killing weeds in the crop row or in the immediate vicinity of the crop plant. The chemical method is easier, less time consuming and less costly than weeding by hired labourers.<br>
Chemicals as herbicides began to be produced in 1950 through industrial research. As a consequence, world agriculture has been the recipient of a continuously expanding range of herbicides. A "herbicide" as a compound modifies or controls plant growth. The quantity of a compound which is capable of producing such an effect is termed as "herbicidally effective amount". Modifying or controlling modes includes all deviations from natural development, e.g. Killing, defoliation, retardation, dessication, regulation, stunting, leaf burn, tillering, dwarfing and the like. The germinating seeds, emerging seedlings and established vegetation, including roots and above-ground portions are termed as "Plants".<br>
In modern agriculture, chemical weed control through herbicides is the most popular method. Herbicides usage in a polyculture system prevailing in India is, however, not as simple as in monoculture due to differential selectivity and development of resistance in plant species as also due to herbicide persistence.<br>
Most of the presently available herbicides provide only a narrow-spectrum of weed control. These herbicides control either grasses or broad leaf weeds but not both. Many of them have activity only on annual species while a few are only effective against perennials. For example in broad leaf crops particularly in oilseeds and pulses, herbicides are available to control grassy weeds. It is difficult to control the broad leaf weeds like Lathyrus spp. in chickpea, vicia spp. in lentil and Asphodel"s tenuifolius in mustard and chickpea. Thus there is a danger of species<br><br>
replacement and hitherto less dominant weed becoming prominent and devastating. Selectively, therefore is also an important consideration in intercropping systems, which limits choice of herbicides.<br>
With the continuous use of herbicides in monoculture systems, herbicide resistance development is becoming problematic. Herbicide resistance is the inherited ability not to be controlled by herbicide. The indiscriminate use of agricultural chemicals led to two different problems due to persistence. One being harmful/inhibitive effect on sensitive crop growth in succession in a cropping system and thus reducing choice of crops. The second being the toxic chemical residues left undegraded, which may result in potential ecological hazard and pollution In addition there are problems of secondary pests and resurgence of weeds. As a result, change in weed communities are observed.<br>
In many cases, active herbicides in-combination have shown multi-facet advantage than when applied individually. Since the combination demonstrates a potency or/and activity level, exceeding that which might be expected from a mere addition of the individual potencies of the components are there by called as ""synergism". The present invention highlights the synergistic effect of a combination of two known active herbicides. Both the individual herbicides forming this combination, which is subject to this invention, are known to be potent herbicides , for their activity independent of each other.<br>
In the WO patent no WO/03/024224 a herbicidal composition has been disclosed in which in<br>

It does not appear to produce direct toxic effects on any animal species. In rats, following oral administration, elimination is rapid, and mainly as the unchanged substance. Following single doses of upto 10 mg/Kg, excretion is almost complete after 24 hours, although, with higher doses, complete elimination takes longer. The maximum concentration in organs is reached after 12 hours. In plants, metabolism involves hydroxylation, decarboxylation, cleavage of the acid side-chain, and ringopening. In soil, microbial degradation involves hydro xylation, decarboxylation, cleavage of the acid side-chain, and ring opening. Rapid degradation in the soil prevents significant downeward movement under normal conditions.Process for selectively combating weeds in the culturing of paddy (rice), which comprises the Pyrazo sulfur on ethyl and others, sufficient to selectively hinder the growth of weeds during the culturing of paddy, applied as a selective pre and early post emergence herbicide.<br>
Application rates depend upon the weeds to be controlled and the degree of control desired. The product provided by this invention is relatively more advantageous and exhibit very desirable characteristic noted herein after. The herbicidal composition can be applied to weed surfaces after dilution with water in recommended dilution rates.<br>
Pesticidal compositions are often formulated and transported in a concentrated form which is subsequently diluted by the user before application, The presence of small amounts of a surfactant facilitate this process of dilution. Thus, preferably a composition according to the invention comprises if desires at least one surfactant. For example, the composition may contain one or more carriers and at least one surfactant.<br>
A carrier in a composition according to the invention is any material with which the active ingredient is formulated to facilitate application to the locus to be treated, which may for example be a plant, seed or soil, or to facilitate storage, transport or handling.

The combination composition of the invention may also contain other additive such as surfactants, emulsifiers, defoamers, buffers, thickeners, dyes, extenders, emetic agent(s) and the like.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that the composition prepared by the process of the present invention has superior pest control at lower level of the combined concentrations of the active agents employed than that may be achieved when the active ingredients are applied alone. In other words, the process of preparing the composition of the present invention and the composition resulting there from, is not a mere admixture of the active ingredients resulting in the aggregation of the properties of the active ingredients employed in the composition. The<br>
process involves judicial selection of the appropriate amounts of the active ingredients which combination only imparts synergism to the resulting composition imparting to it the unexpected and unique properties<br>
Advantageously, known adjuvants which are known to enhance the activity, may also be incorporated in the process of preparing the composition. The composition resulting from the process may be dispersed in a solid or liquid diluent for application to the insect, its food supply,<br><br><br>
breeding ground or habitat as a dilute spray or as a solid dust or dust concentrate.<br>
As a commodity the composition is generally is in a ready to use form which may be diluted at the place of application for suitable concentration of the active ingredients.<br>
In general, the synergistic effect may be achieved at application rates of the active ingredient of about 10 to 20 g/ha of Pyrazosulfuron ethyl in combinaiton with 700 to 1500 g/ha of Butachlor; preferably in about 14 g/ha. Pyrazosulfuron ethyl to 1000 g/ha g/ha of Butachlor.<br>
In general, the synergistic effect may be achieved at application rates of the active ingredient of about 10 to 20 g/ha of Pyrazosulfuron ethyl combinaiton with 280 to 575 g/ha of Pretilachlor, preferably in about 14 g/ha of Pyrazosulfuron ethyl to 400 g/ha of Pretilachlor.<br>
In general, the synergistic effect may be achieved at application rates of the active ingredient of about 10 to 20 g/ha of Pyrazosulfuron ethyl combinaiton with 350 to 715 g/ha of 2, 4-D, preferably in about 14 g/ha of Pyrazosulfuron ethyl to 500 g/ha g/ha of 2, 4-D.<br>

Example<br>
Evaluation of the synergistic herbicidal effect of the Pyrazo sulfuron ethyl plus a second herbicide preferably from Butachlor,Pretilchlor and 2,4-D can be established by using any composition prepared by the process described in the above examples. For these evaluations one or more of the cornpositons prepared in the examples are used here.<br>
In this evaluation, one of the important weeds of Rice ( paddy ) corps , namely Echinochloa crusgalli is grown in standard greenhouse soil until its plants have reached the 6-leaf stage.Said plant are then sprayed with an aqueous solution of the test copound Pyrazosulfuron ethyl and a second herbicide preferably one of the following Butachlor,Pretilachlor or 2,4-D,using a spray nozzle opetating at 30 psi for a predetermined time so as to obtain a range of application rates of about 10 g/ha to 1500 g/h . Each treatment is replicated 3 times.Afier spraying, the plants are placed on greenhouse benches and are cared for in a manner commensurate with standard greenhouse practice. At 4 weeks after treatment, the plants are examined, and the % weed control as compared to the untreated check is recorded.<br>
Synergism can be calculated by using the Colby"s method i.e. the expected (or predicted) response ( E ) of the combination is calculated by taking the product of the observed response for each individual component X and Y, of the combination when applied alone divided by 100 and subtracting this value from the sum of observed response ( X + Y ) for each component when applied alone.<br>
E = (X + Y)-{ [X. Y]/100} where E - expected or predicted response<br>
X- observed response for "A" component Y- observed response for "B" component<br>
Synergism of the combination is then determined by comparing the observed response ( O ) of<br>
the combination to the expected (or predicted)  response ( E )as calculated from the observed<br>
response of each individual component alone. If the observed response of the combination is<br>
greater than the expected (or predicted) response then the combination is said to be synergistic<br>
and falls within the definition of synergistic effect. (Colby,S. R., Weeds, 1967(15), p. 20-22)<br>
e.g.	a. if E &gt; O then result is antagonistic effect;<br>
b.	if E = O then result is simply additional effect;<br>
c.	if E 
The treatment comprises different doses of Pyrazo sulfuron ethyl with a second herbicide preferably Butachlor, Pretilachlor or 2,4-D at doses specified specificallly below within relative examples.<br>
Using the above process, Pyrazo sulfuron ethyl may be evaluated alone and in combination with second herbicidal compound.<br>
20<br><br>
For example, the synergistic effect may be achieved at application rates of the active ingredient of about 10 to 20 g/ha of Pyrazosulfuron ethyl in combinaiton with 700 to 1500 g/ha of Butachlor; preferably in about 14 g/ha of Pyrazosulfuron ethyl to 1000 g/ha.<br>
For example, the synergistic effect may be achieved at application rates of the active ingredient of about 10 to 20 g/ha of Pyrazosulfuron ethyl combinaiton with 280 to 575 g/ha of Pretilachlor, preferably in about 14 g/ha of Pyrazosulfuron ethyl to 400 g/ha of Pretilachlor.<br>
For example, the synergistic effect may be achieved at application rates of the active ingredient of about 10 to 20 g/ha of Pyrazosulfuron ethyl combinaiton with 350 to 715 g/ha of 2,4-D, preferably in about 14 g/ha of Pyrazosulfuron ethyl to 500 g/ha of 2,4-D.<br>
Treatments which are used are shown in following table 5 .<br>
As can be seen from the data shown in Table 5 below, application of a combination of Pyrazosulfuon ethyl and Butachlor gives significantly greater weed control [of Rice ( paddy ) crop weed Echinochloa crusgall ] than that which could be predicted from the weed control resulting from the application of either Pyrazosulfuron ethyl alone or Butachlor alone.<br>
