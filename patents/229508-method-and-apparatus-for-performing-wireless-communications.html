				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PERFORMING WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The invention relates generally to method and apparatus for performing wireless<br>
communications, and in particular, for controlling handoffs between different wireless systems.<br>
Background<br>
Mobile communications systems, such as cellular or personal communications<br>
services (PCS) systems, are made up of a plurality of cells. Each cell provides a radio<br>
communication center in which a mobile station establishes a call with another mobile station<br>
or a wireline unit connected to a public switched telephone network (PSTN) or a packet<br>
switched data network (PSDN). Each cell includes a radio base station, with each base<br>
station connected to a mobile switching center that controls processing of calls between or<br>
among mobile stations or mobile stations and wireline terminals.<br>
Various wireless protocols exist for defining communications in a wireless network.<br>
One such protocol is the time-division multiple access (TDMA) standard, such as the<br>
TIA/EIA-136 standard provided by the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA).<br>
Another TDMA-based wireless communications technology is the Global System for Mobile<br>
(GSM) technology. According to TDMA, each radio frequency (RF) carrier carries a frame<br>
that is divided into plural (e.g., six or eight) times slots to increase the number of mobile<br>
stations that can be supported per RF carrier.<br>
Another standard for wireless communications is the code-division multiple access<br>
(CDMA) standard, with versions implemented as the IS-95A and IS-95B standards. CDMA<br>
is a spread spectrum wireless communications protocol in which transmission is based on the<br>
spread spectrum modulation technique to allow many users to have access to the same band<br>
of carriers.<br>
Traditionally, wireless networks have been designed for carrying circuit-switched<br>
voice traffic. However, with the explosion of the Internet and intranets, packet-switched<br>
communications (e.g., web browsing, electronic mail, and so forth) have become common.<br>
As a result, third generation (3G) wireless technologies are being developed to transition to<br>
higher bandwidth and more efficient packet-switched communications (of data as well as<br>
voice and other forms of real-time data) over wireless networks.<br>
To achieve 3G requirements, the CDMA 2000 family of standards has been<br>
developed, also referred to as the IS-2000 standards. A CDMA 2000 wireless<br>
communications system is capable of supporting both traditional voice traffic as well as<br>
packet-switched traffic, such as web browsing, electronic mail, voice-over-IP (Internet<br>
Protocol), and so forth. On the TDMA side, packet-switched wireless communications<br>
protocols have also been developed, including the Enhanced Data Rate for Global Evolution<br>
(EDGE) technology, sometimes referred to as Enhanced GPRS (General Packet Radio<br>
Service).<br>
The first phase of CDMA 2000 is referred to as lxRTT (also referred to as 3GIX or<br>
IX), which is designed to increase voice capacity as well as to support data transmission<br>
speeds that are faster than typically available. In addition, for even higher data rates, a High<br>
Data Rate (HDR) wireless technology has been developed. HDR is defined as TIA/ELA/IS-<br>
856, "CDMA 2000, High Rate Packet Data Air Interface Specification," which is adopted by<br>
the TIA. The HDR technology is also referred to as the lxEV-DO or lxEV technology.<br>
lxEV-DO provides relatively high data transfer rates over the air interface between mobile<br>
stations and base stations (referred to as access networks or ANs by lxEV-DO).<br>
For mobile stations that are capable of working in both lxRTT and lxEV-DO<br>
systems, a graceful way has not been developed for transitioning a mobile station between a<br>
lxEV-DO system and a lxRTT system. One current scheme that exists for transitioning a<br>
mobile station between lxEV-DO and lxRTT systems is that when a mobile station<br>
transitions from one system to another, the call is actually dropped (or terminated) in the<br>
system that the mobile station is leaving and re-originated in the system that the mobile<br>
station is entering.<br>
A need exists for an improved method and apparatus of transitioning mobile stations<br>
between different wireless systems, such as lxRTT and lxEV-DO systems.<br>
Summary<br>
In general, according to one embodiment, a method of performing wireless<br>
communications comprises communicating bearer traffic for a packet-switched<br>
communications session between a mobile station and a first base station associated with a<br>
first type of wireless system, and determining if handoff is required from the first base station<br>
to a second base station associated with a second, different type of wireless system.<br>
Messages are exchanged between the first and second base stations to perform the handoff in<br>
response to determining that the handoff is required.<br>
Other or alternative features will become apparent from the following description,<br>
from the drawings, and from the claims.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
In the following description, numerous details are set forth to provide an<br>
understanding of the present invention. However, it will be understood by those skilled in the<br>
art that the present invention may be practiced without these details and that numerous<br>
variations or modifications from the described embodiments may be possible.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, a wireless communications network 10 has a coverage area<br>
designated generally as 12. In one embodiment, the wireless communications network 10<br>
includes components that operate according to CDMA (code-divisional multiple access)<br>
2000. CDMA 2000 is defined by the CDMA 2000 family of standards (collectively referred<br>
to as the IS-2000 Standard), which is developed by the Third Generation Partnership Project<br>
2 (3GPP2). However, in other embodiments, other types of wireless protocols can be used<br>
for communications in the wireless communications network 10.<br>
The wireless communications network 10 includes a base station (BS) 14, which is an<br>
entity used for radio telecommunications with mobile stations (e.g., mobile station 16) within<br>
a cell 18 covered by the base station 14. The radio equipment of the base station 14 is<br>
implemented in a base transceiver subsystem (BTS) 20, and the control portion of the base<br>
station 14 is the base station controller (BSC) 22.<br>
For communicating circuit-switched voice traffic, the base station 14 is coupled to a<br>
mobile switching center (MSC) 24, which is responsible for switching mobile station-<br>
originated or mobile station-terminated traffic. Effectively, the MSC 24 is the interface for<br>
signaling and user traffic between the wireless network 10 and other public switched<br>
networks (such as a public switched telephone network (PSTN) 26) or other MSCs. The<br>
PSTN 26 is connected to landline terminals, such as telephones 28.<br>
In a voice call session between a mobile station (such as mobile station 16) and a<br>
landline terminal (such as telephone 28), voice traffic is routed through the air interface<br>
between the mobile station 16 and a base station 14, and through the base station 14, MSC<br>
24, and PSTN 26.<br>
The wireless communications network 10 also supports packet data services, in which<br>
packet data is communicated between a mobile station and another endpoint, which can be a<br>
terminal coupled to a data network 34 or another mobile station that is capable of<br>
communicating packet data. Examples of the data network 34 include private networks (such<br>
as local area networks or wide area networks) and public networks (such as the Internet).<br>
Packet data is communicated in a packet-switched communications session established<br>
between the mobile station and the other endpoint.<br>
To communicate packet data, the base station 14 is coupled to a packet control<br>
function (PCF) module 32, which manages the relay of packets between the base station 14<br>
and a packet data serving node (PDSN) 30. The base station 14 and PCF module 32 can be<br>
implemented on one platform or on multiple platforms. An interface 15 between the base<br>
station 14 and the PCF module 32 may include an A8 interface to carry user traffic and an A9<br>
interface to carry signaling. An interface 31 between the PCF module 32 and PDSN 30 may<br>
include an A10 interface to carry user traffic and an Al 1 interface to carry signaling.<br>
The PDSN 30 establishes, maintains, and terminates link layer sessions to mobile<br>
stations, and routes mobile station-originated or mobile station-terminated packet data traffic.<br>
The PDSN 30 is coupled to the public data network 34, which is connected to various<br>
endpoints, such as a computer 36 or a network telephone 38 (which is a telephone that is<br>
fitted with a network interface card for communications over packet data networks).<br>
Examples of packet data communications include web browsing, electronic mail, text chat<br>
sessions, file transfers, interactive game sessions, voice-over-IP (Internet Protocol) sessions,<br>
and so forth.<br>
The wireless communications network 10 thus provides two different types of<br>
communications: circuit-switched communications and packet-switched communications.<br>
Circuit-switched communications are routed through the MSC 24, while packet-switched<br>
communications are routed through the PDSN 30. In circuit-switched communications, a<br>
dedicated end-to-end channel is established for the duration of a call session. However,<br>
packet-switched communications utilize a connectionless intranetwork layer, such as that<br>
defined by the Internet Protocol (IP). In packet-switched communications, packets or other<br>
units of data carry routing information (in the form of addresses) that is used to route the<br>
packets or data units over one or more paths to a destination endpoint.<br>
One version of IP, referred to as IPv4, is described in Request for Comments (RFC)<br>
791, entitled "Internet Protocol," dated September 1981; and another version of IP, referred to<br>
as IPv6, is described in RFC 2460, "Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification," dated<br>
December 1998.<br>
The base station 14 is part of a first type of wireless communications system, which in<br>
one example is a lxRTT system. lxRTT refers to one phase of the CDMA 2000 technology.<br>
More generally, the base station 14 is referred to as an IS-2000 base station.<br>
The wireless communications network 10 also includes a second type of wireless<br>
communications system, which in the described example is a lxEV-DO or lxEV system.<br>
One version of lxEV-DO is defined in the TIA/EIA/IS-856 Standard, entitled "CDMA 2000<br>
High Rate Packet Data Air Interface Specification." Note that although only one base station<br>
14 and one access network 40 are shown in Fig. 1, the wireless communications network 10<br>
can include plural base stations 14 and plural access networks 40.<br>
The first type of wireless communications system (e.g., lxRTT system) supports<br>
packet data services at a first performance level while the second type of wireless<br>
communications system (e.g., lxEV-DO system) supports packet data services at a second,<br>
higher performance level. As used here, the term "performance level" refers to data<br>
bandwidth, data rate, and/or any other parameter that indicates a level of performance in<br>
wireless communications. Thus, generally, the first and second types of wireless<br>
communication systems within the wireless communications network 10 provide different<br>
performance levels for packet data services.<br>
The lxEV-DO wireless communications system includes an access network (AN) 40,<br>
which is network equipment that provides data connectivity between a packet-switched data<br>
network (such as the data network 34 through the PDSN 30) and a mobile station (e.g.,<br>
mobile station 43). The access network 40 provides coverage in a cell 41. According to<br>
lxEV-DO, a mobile station is referred to as an access terminal (AT), which is a device that<br>
provides data connectivity to a user. However, as used here, "mobile station" refers to any<br>
user device, whether it is capable of communicating in a lxRTT wireless system, lxEV-DO<br>
wireless system, or other wireless system. Examples of mobile stations include personal<br>
digital assistants (PDAs), mobile telephones, mobile units coupled to portable computing<br>
devices, and so forth.<br>
The access network 40 is equivalent to the base station 14 in the lxRTT (or more<br>
generally, IS-2000) wireless system. The access network 40 includes an access network<br>
controller (ANC) 42 and an access point (AP) 44. As used here, "base station" or "base<br>
station system" refers to the base station 14, the access network 40, or any other radio<br>
network controller and/or radio transceiver that supports wireless communications with<br>
mobile stations.<br>
A packet control function (PCF) module 46 is coupled between the access network 40<br>
and the PDSN 30. An interface 45 between the access network 40 and the PCF module 46<br>
may include A8 and A9 interfaces, and an interface 47 between the PCF module 46 and the<br>
PDSN 30 may include A10 and Al 1 interfaces. During a communications session, packet<br>
data is routed between the access terminal 43 and another endpoint through the access<br>
network 40, PCF module 46, and PDSN 30.<br>
In accordance with some embodiments of the invention, a relatively graceful handoff<br>
procedure is provided for handing off a call between a first type of wireless system and a<br>
second type of wireless system in response to a mobile station crossing a boundary between a<br>
cell covered by the first type of wireless system and a cell covered by the second type of<br>
wireless system. In the arrangement illustrated in Fig. 1, the mobile stations 43 and 16 are<br>
assumed to be "hybrid" mobile stations that are able to support communications in both the<br>
first and second types of wireless systems. In one example, the hybrid mobile stations 43 and<br>
16 are capable of supporting communications in both lxRTT and lxEV-DO wireless<br>
systems.<br>
To support handoff of a call when one of the mobile stations 16 and 43 crosses<br>
between one cell (covered by the first type of wireless system) and another cell (covered by<br>
the second type of wireless system), an interface is defined between the access network 40<br>
and the base station 14. In the example of Fig. 1, this interface is referred to as an Ay<br>
interface 50, which enables network-initiated handoff procedures.<br>
According to one embodiment, the handoff performed is a hard handoff in which the<br>
call is maintained (that is, the call is not dropped and re-originated). A point-to-point<br>
protocol (PPP) connection between the mobile station and the PDSN 30 is maintained<br>
through the use of a permanent terminal identifier, referred to as an international mobile<br>
subscriber identity (IMSI). PPP is described in RFC 1661, entitled "Point-to-Point Protocol,"<br>
dated July 1994.<br>
To enable handoffs between an access network 40 and a base station 14 in the two<br>
different types of wireless systems, each of the access network 40 and base station 14 is able<br>
to detect that a mobile station is approaching the edge of the coverage area. Further, the<br>
access network 40 has information about neighboring lxRTT (or more generally, IS-2000)<br>
pilots, and vice versa, the base station 14 has information about neighboring lxEV-DO pilots.<br>
Generally, when the access network 40 detects that a mobile station is approaching a<br>
coverage boundary, the access network 40 redirects the mobile station to the neighboring IS-<br>
2000 base station 14. The access network 40 also initiates a handoff procedure (network-<br>
initiated handoff procedure) by sending a message to notify the IS-2000 base station 14 that a<br>
handoff is required. This message includes the mobile station's permanent terminal identifier<br>
(IMSI) and a mobility event indicator. When the IS-2000 base station 14 receives the<br>
handoff notification, the base station 14 initiates procedures to transfer connections to the IS-<br>
2000 wireless system.<br>
A similar procedure is performed in the reverse direction when a mobile station<br>
transitions from the coverage area of an IS-2000 base station 14 to the coverage area of a<br>
lxEV-DO access network 40.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, a message flow of the process of a handoff between the access<br>
network 40 and the base station 14 is illustrated. For the sake of simplicity, the access<br>
network 40 and associated PCF module 46 are shown as a unit, while the base station 14 and<br>
PCF module 32 are shown as a single unit.<br>
An active lxEV-DO data session 100 has been established between the mobile station<br>
and the PDSN 30. In one example, the data session can be a voice-over-IP session, which is<br>
a session in which voice is carried in IP packets between two endpoints (a mobile station and<br>
another endpoint, such as an endpoint coupled to the data network 34). Other types of<br>
sessions for carrying other types of data can also be established, such as data communicated<br>
during web browsing, electronic mail, text chat sessions, file transfers, interactive gaming<br>
sessions, and so forth.<br>
As noted above, IP defines a packet-switched protocol in which packets are routed<br>
using addresses carried in the packets between endpoints. An IP network includes routers<br>
that route packets based on source and destination IP addresses carried in the packets. For<br>
voice-over-IP call sessions, voice data is carried as payload in IP packets. In one example,<br>
the voice data is stored in Real-Time Protocol (RTP) format. RTP defines a protocol for<br>
transporting real-time data, and is described in RFC 1889, entitled "RTP: A Transport<br>
Protocol for Real-Time Applications," dated January 1996.<br>
As the mobile station (43 in the illustrated example of Fig. 1) moves toward the<br>
boundary of the cell 41, the access network 40 detects a condition that a hard handoff is<br>
required. This can be based on pilot strength measurements, for example. In response to this<br>
condition, the access network 40 sends a Handoff Required message (at 102) to the target<br>
base station 14 through the interface 50. The access network 40 inserts the PANID (previous<br>
access network identifier) of the source PCF module 46 in the Handoff Required message.<br>
The Handoff Required message indicates that for a given mobile station that already<br>
has a dedicated radio resource assigned, a handoff is required for the reason given by a<br>
"Cause" information element. Conventionally, a Handoff Required message is sent by an IS-<br>
2000 base station to an MSC. In one embodiment, the Handoff Required message exchanged<br>
over the Ay interface 50 between the access network 40 and base station 14 is similar to<br>
Handoff Required messages exchanged between an IS-2000 base station and MSC, except<br>
that information elements are provided to indicate that the source system is a lxEV-DO<br>
system.<br>
The base station 14 then forwards the Handoff Required message (at 104) to the MSC<br>
24 with an indication that the Handoff Required message is a relayed message requesting<br>
handoff from the lxEV-DO access network 40. For example, this can be indicated in the<br>
"Cause" information element of the Handoff Required message. The message provides the<br>
MSC with a list of target candidate cells or optional measurement information for the MSC to<br>
use to determine a target with an available radio channel. Upon receiving a Handoff<br>
Required message, the MSC 24 may construct a candidate target list, modify an existing one,<br>
or use the existing list as received.<br>
The MSC 24 then sends (at 106) a Handoff Request message to the target base station<br>
14 to indicate that the mobile station is to be handed over to the base station 14. Upon receipt<br>
of the Handoff Request message, the target base station 14 allocates suitable idle radio<br>
resources.<br>
The target base station also returns (at 110) a Handoff Request Acknowledge message<br>
to the MSC 24 with appropriate RF channel information to allow the mobile station to be<br>
instructed to tune to the new RF channel.<br>
The MSC 24 then sends a Handoff Command message (at 111) to the target base<br>
station 14. The Handoff Command commences source cell handoff procedures. Note that,<br>
conventionally, the Handoff Command message is sent from the MSC to the source base<br>
station directly; however, in accordance with one embodiment, the MSC 24 sends the<br>
Handoff Command message to the target base station 14 in its role as proxy for the source<br>
access network 40.<br>
In response, the target base station 14 then sends a Handoff Command message (at<br>
112) to the source access network 40 over the Ay interface 50 containing the appropriate RF<br>
channel information. Upon receipt of the Handoff Command message, the source access<br>
network 40 instructs the mobile station to re-direct to the IS-2000 base station by sending (at<br>
114) a Handoff Direction message.<br>
The access network 40 next sends (at 118) a Handoff Commenced message to the<br>
target base station 14 over the Ay interface 50. The Handoff Commenced message is sent by<br>
the source access network 40 to the IS-2000 base station 14 to indicate that the Handoff<br>
Direction message has been sent to the mobile station and that the mobile station is not<br>
expected to return to the source access network 40. Note that, conventionally, the Handoff<br>
Command message is sent by the source base station to the MSC, but in the call flow of Fig.<br>
2, the Handoff Command message is sent from the source access network 40 to the target<br>
base station 14.<br>
The mobile station then sends (at 120) an Origination message to the target base<br>
station 14. The target base station 14 responds (at 122) with a Traffic Channel Assignment<br>
message.<br>
Next, the target PCF module (in this case PCF module 32) sends (at 126) an Al 1<br>
Registration Request message to the PDSN 30. The Al 1 Registration Request message<br>
contains the Mobility Event Indicator within the Vendor/Organization Specific Extension<br>
information element to the PSDN 30. The Mobility Event Indicator is used during dormant<br>
and active/hard handoffs. The Al 1 Registration Request message also includes the PANE)<br>
(of the source PCF module 46) and the current access network identifier (CANID) (of the<br>
target PCF module 32) within the Vendor/Organization Specific Extension information<br>
element. The Al 1 Registration Request message is sent by the target PCF module 32 to the<br>
PDSN 30 after a short data burst has been successfully sent to the PDSN 30 from the target<br>
PCF 32, with the Al 1 Registration Request message sent to establish an A10 connection<br>
between the PCF module 32 and PDSN 30. The Al 1 Registration Request message is<br>
described in RFC 2002, entitled "IP Mobility Support," dated October 1996.<br>
The PDSN 30 validates the Al 1 Registration Request message and accepts the<br>
connection by returning (at 128) an Al 1 Registration Reply message with an accept<br>
indication to the target PCF 32. The accept indication is provided in the "Code" information<br>
element of the Al 1 Registration Reply message. In response, the A10 connecting binding<br>
information at the PDSN 30 is updated to point to the target PCF module 32.<br>
The target base station 14 detects that the mobile station has successfully accessed the<br>
target. The target base station 14 then sends (at 130) a Handoff Complete message to the<br>
MSC 24. This indicates to the MSC 24 that the mobile station has arrived on the new RF<br>
channel and has completed connection procedures. At this point, a lxRTT session is<br>
established (at 132) between a mobile station and the PDSN 30 (also referred to as the A10<br>
connection).<br>
The PDSN 30 initiates termination of the A10 connection with the source PCF<br>
module (in this example PCF module 46) by sending (at 138) an Al 1 Registration Update<br>
message. The Al 1 Registration Update message is sent to update the status of the A10<br>
connection, in this case to terminate the A10 connection. The source PCF module 46<br>
responds (at 140) with an Al 1 Registration Update Acknowledge message.<br>
The source PCF module 46 then sends (at 142) an Al 1 Registration Request message<br>
with the Lifetime information element set to zero to tear down the A10 connection. Also,<br>
accounting related information may be carried in the Al 1 Registration Request message sent<br>
at 142. The PDSN 30 stores the accounting related information for further processing before<br>
returning (at 144) an Al 1 Registration Reply message. The source PCF module 46 closes the<br>
A10 connection for the mobile station, which has been handed off to the target base station<br>
14.<br>
At this point, all maintenance procedures that are required of the target PCF module<br>
32 continue.<br>
The message flow for transitioning from a lxRTT base station to a lxEV-DO access<br>
network is similar to the message flow for transitioning from a lxEV-DO access network to a<br>
lxRTT base station, with some modifications. To initiate the handoff, the source lxRTT<br>
base station also sends a Handoff Required message to the target lxEV-DO access network.<br>
The lxEV-DO access network then waits for the mobile station to send a Unicast Access<br>
Terminal Identifier (UATI)-Request message. The access network responds with a UATI-<br>
Assignment message in response, and then places the mobile station on the traffic channel.<br>
This is similar to the lxEV-DO to lxRTT transition, in which the network waits for the<br>
mobile station to show up. However, exchanges of messaging (104, 106, 110,111,130 in<br>
Fig. 2) between the target lxEV-DO access network and the MSC do not occur.<br>
The remaining flow of messages are identical to that shown in Fig. 2, except that the<br>
roles of the lxRTT base station and lxEV-DO access network are reversed. However,<br>
instead of a Handoff Complete message from the target to the MSC (130 in Fig. 2), the<br>
source lxRTT base station sends an indication to the MSC that the connection has been<br>
handed off to a lxEV-DO access network (and thus the MSC need no longer be involved in<br>
communications with the transitioning mobile station).<br>
The MSC also sends a Clear Command message to the source lxRTT base station to<br>
start a clearing procedure used in hard handoffs to release the source RF channel and<br>
terrestrial resource. In response to the Clear Command, the lxRTT base station sends a Clear<br>
Complete message to the MSC.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, some components inside the access network 40/base station 14<br>
and PCF module 46 or 32 according to one example are illustrated. It is noted that Fig. 3<br>
provides a functional view of some (but not all) of the components of the access<br>
network/base station. The access networkftase station and PCF module may be implemented<br>
on one platform or on multiple platforms, referred to as wireless packet service platform(s)<br>
200.<br>
The access network/base station has a communications stack for communication over<br>
an air interface. The communications stack is made up of several layers, including a physical<br>
layer 202, a medium access control (MAC) layer 204, a link access control (LAC) layer 206,<br>
and a layer 3 signaling block 208. The physical layer 202 implements the physical layer<br>
protocol that provides channel structure, frequency, power output, and modulation<br>
specifications for the forward and reverse links in the air interface.<br>
The MAC layer 204 implements the medium access protocol and is response for<br>
transport of LAC protocol data units using services provided by the physical layer 202. The<br>
LAC layer 206 implements a data link protocol that provides for the correct transport and<br>
delivery of signaling messages generated by the layer 3 signaling block 208. The layer 3<br>
signaling block 208 provides the control messaging for wireless communications between the<br>
access network/base station and the mobile station. The access network/base station may also<br>
include other layers 210. In addition, one or more applications 212 may be executable in the<br>
access network/base station.<br>
To communicate with the PCF module, the access network/base station includes A8<br>
and A9 interfaces 214. As discussed above, the A8 interface carries user traffic between the<br>
base station or access network and the PCF module, and the A9 interface carries signaling<br>
between the base station or access network and the PCF module. Also, the access<br>
network/base station includes an Ay interface 219 to enable communication between a base<br>
station and access network.<br>
The various components of the base station or access network illustrated in Fig. 3 can<br>
be implemented as software components, hardware components, or a combination thereof.<br>
The parts that are implemented in software are executable on a control unit 216 (which may<br>
be implemented as a single processor or as multiple processors). The control unit 216 is<br>
coupled to a storage unit 218 for storing data and instructions of software.<br>
The PCF module includes A8 and A9 interfaces 220, as well as signaling and user<br>
traffic control module 222. Other layers may also be present in the PCF module, which are<br>
not shown. The signaling and user traffic control module 222 also communicates with<br>
A10/A11 interface 224. As noted above, the Al 0 interface carries user traffic between the<br>
PCF module and the PDSN 30, and the Al 1 interface carries signaling between the PCF<br>
module and the PDSN 30.<br>
The components of the PCF module may be implemented as software, hardware, or a<br>
combination thereof. Parts that are implemented in software are executable on a control unit<br>
226, which is coupled to a storage unit 228 in the PCF module.<br>
Each control unit referred to herein includes a microprocessor, a microcontroller, a<br>
processor card (including one or more microprocessors or microcontrollers), or other control<br>
or computing devices. The storage units referred to in this discussion include one or more<br>
machine-readable storage media for storing data and instructions. The storage media include<br>
different forms of memory including semiconductor memory devices such as dynamic or<br>
static random access memories (DRAMs or SRAMs), erasable and programmable read-only<br>
memories (EPROMs), electrically erasable and programmable read-only memories<br>
(EEPROMs) and flash memories; magnetic disks such as fixed, floppy and removable disks;<br>
other magnetic media including tape; and optical media such as compact disks (CDs) or<br>
digital video disks (DVDs). Instructions that make up the various software routines or<br>
modules in the various devices or systems are stored in respective storage devices. The<br>
instructions when executed by a respective control unit cause the corresponding node or<br>
system to perform programmed acts.<br>
The instructions of the software routines or modules are loaded or transported to each<br>
node or system in one of many different ways. For example, code segments including<br>
instructions stored on floppy disks, CD or DVD media, a hard disk, or transported through a<br>
network interface card, modem, or other interface device are loaded into the device or system<br>
and executed as corresponding software routines or modules. In the loading or transport<br>
process, data signals that are embodied in carrier waves (transmitted over telephone lines,<br>
network lines, wireless links, cables, and the like) communicate the code segments, including<br>
instructions, to the device or system. Such carrier waves are in the form of electrical, optical,<br>
acoustical, electromagnetic, or other types of signals.<br>
As used here, a "controller" refers to a hardware component, software component, or<br>
a combination of the two. Although used in the singular sense, a "controller" can also refer<br>
to plural hardware components, plural software components, or a combination thereof.<br>
