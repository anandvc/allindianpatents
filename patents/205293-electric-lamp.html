The invention relates to an electric lamp.<br>
Moreover, the invention relates to lamps both with a screw base and with a bayonet base. In the first case, a normally round base bottom contact platelet is arranged centrally on the outer surface of the base bottom and serves there as an outer contact for connecing to an electric supply source. In the second case, two elongated, normally oval or elliptical base bottom contact platelets are arranged as electric outer contacts on the outer surface of the base bottom.<br>
The  type  of light source as such, that is to say  incandescent filament  or gas discharge, for example, plays no role  here.  The invention   therefore  comprises  both  incandescent  lamps   and discharge  lamps which have bases with at least one  base  bottom contact platelet.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
In this context, economic, that is to say automated lamp production entails the task of producing reliable soldered connections with a minimized consumption of solder in the shortest possible time, that is to say in conjunction with quickly moving lamp production lines.<br>
The soldered connections are usually implemented by dotting flux onto  the base bottom contact platelets, fallowing by soldering,<br><br>
2.<br>
for example flame solderiing. In the case of the targeted high performances of lamp production lines, that is to say in accordance with short machine clock cycles of the lamp production lines, a soldering time of typically f a few tenths of a second, for example 500 ms, is available. In this short time, it is difficult for the previously required amount of solder to be fused and suitably distributed over the entire surface of the contact platelet. A complicating factor is that because of the short machine clock cycles of the lamp production line, relatively high accelerating forces militate against the liquid solder remaining on the contact platelet.<br>
Document EP-A 0 488 462 discloses a lamp having a base bottom contact platelet. The base bottom contact platelet has a plurality of holes around &amp; central opening - for guiding through and soldering a supply lead! to the contact platelet. In order to save material, these holes are intended to reduce the extent to which flux and solder flow off.<br>
A further problem results from the attempt to reduce the consumption of material for the base bottom contact platelet as far as possible, for example for reducing the thickness of the contact platelet. This, however, further results increasingly in the need to connect the contact platelet reliably to the base bottom.<br><br>
3.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide an electric lamp having a base bottom contact platelet in accordance with the preamble of claim 1, which ensures a permanent connection between the base bottom and contact platelet in conjunction with a reduced requirement of material for the contact platelet and solder.<br>
According to the invention, at least one base bottom contact platelet of the lamp has at least one cutout. Moreover, the material of the cutout is bent over to form a lug in such a way that the lug engages in the base bottom.<br>
As a result of these two measures, it is achieved, on the one hand, that the area to be covered by the flux and the solder is restricted, specifically with the aid of the cutouts. On the other hand, an improved anchoring of the contact platelet in the base bottom is achieved, specifically by means of the lugs created with the aid of the cutouts. Said lugs also have the advantage that they are fabricated from the material which is required in any case for a contact platelet, that is to say without increased consumption of material.<br>
The at least one cutout, and consequently also that at least one lug, preferably has an elongated shape.<br><br>
3A.<br>
Moreover, two or more cutouts are preferably arranged around  the central opening for the supply lead.<br>
In a development for a bayonet base, the at least base bottom<br>
contact platelet has an elongated shape defining a longitudinal<br>
axis. Typical shapes are, for example, oval, elliptical or at<br>
least ellipse-like ones. Seen in the direction of the<br>
longitudinal axis, one cutout is arranged on the left of the<br>
central opening for the supply lead and one cutout is arranged on<br>
the right. Moreover, the two elongated cutouts are oriented<br>
essentially transverse to the longitudinal axis of the base<br>
bottom contact platelet. In addition, the lugs of the two<br>
elongated cutouts are bent essemtially transverse to the<br>
longitudinal axis of the base bottom	<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
contact platelet. This has the advantage that the elongated lugs project with their entire length into the base bottom and consequently anchor the base bottom contact platelet therein particularly effectively.<br>
The two lugs are preferably bent in such a way that, with reference to the longitudinal axis of the base bottom contact platelet, they engage in the base bottom at opposite narrow sides of the elongated cutouts, in other words are arranged diagonally with reference to the contact platelet. This reduces rotation or twisting of the contact platelet, which is particularly important in the case of relatively thin base bottom contact platelets.<br>
In a development for a lamp with a screw base, an essentially circular base bottom contact platelet is arranged in the center of the base bottom. At least two, preferably three, particularly preferably four elongated cutouts are arranged distributed symmetrically around the opening arranged in the center of the base bottom contact platelet.<br>
Relatively thin contact platelets can be used owing to the configuration according to the invention of the or each base bottom contact platelet, in particular on the basis of anchoring by means of lugs. The thickness of a base bottom contact platelet is typically less than 0.5 mm, in particular less than 0.3 mm.<br>
Description of the accompanying drawings<br>
The invention is to be explained in more detail below with the aid of an exemplary embodiment. In the drawing:<br>
Figure 1 shows a side view of an incandescent lamp according to the invention, with a bayonet base,<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
Figure 2 shows the plan view of the base in the direction toward the base bottom,<br>
Figure 3a shows a plan view of an elliptical base bottom contact platelet of the lamp from Figure 1,<br>
Figure 3b shows a sectional illustration along the longitudinal axis of the contact platelet from Figure 3a,<br>
Figure 3c shows a sectional illustration of the contact platelet from Figure 3a, along the line AA,<br>
Figure 4a shows a plan view of an alternative base bottom contact platelet of the lamp from Figure 1, and<br>
Figure 4b shows a sectional illustration along the longitudinal axis L of the contact platelet from Figure 4a.<br>
Figure 1 shows the side view of an incandescent lamp 1 according to the invention, with a bayonet base 2, in a schematic illustration. The incandescent lamp 1 has a transparent, pear-shaped lamp bulb 3 made from glass, which is sealed in a gastight fashion by means of a flare mount (not illustrated). An incandescent filament 4 is arranged in the interior of the lamp bulb 3. The incandescent filament 4 is connected to two supply leads 5, 6 which are led (not illustrated) to the outside in a gastight fashion through the flare mount. The flare mount of the lamp bulb 3 is arranged in the bayonet base 2. The bayonet base 2 has a base shell 7 made from aluminum and a base bottom 8 made from glass.<br>
Reference is also made below to Figure 2, which shows a schematic plan view of the base 2 of the lamp 1 from<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
Figure 1, in the direction of the base bottom 8. Two elliptical base bottom contact platelets 9, 10 of thickness 0.2 mm and made from copper-zinc (CuZn) alloy are arranged on the outer surface of the base bottom 8. The semiminor and semimajor axes are respectively approximately 2.7 cm and 5 cm. Each base bottom contact platelet 9, 10 respectively has a central opening 11, 12. Through each opening 11, 12, one of the two supply leads 5, 6 is respectively led outward, where it is connected to the associated base bottom contact platelet 9, 10 by means of solder 13 (not illustrated in Figure 2, for the sake of clarity).<br>
Reference is additionally made below to Figures 3a-3c, which show a plan view, a longitudinal section and a section along the line AA of one 9 of the two base bottom contact platelets 9, 10 of the lamp from Figure 1. Each base bottom contact platelet 9, 10 has two rectangular cutouts 14, 15 with dimensions 0.5 mm times 28 mm. Seen in the direction of the semimajor axis, one cutout 14, 15 or 16, 17 each is arranged on the left and right of the central opening 11, 12, and transverse to the semimajor axis in each case.<br>
The material of each cutout 14, 15 (Figures 3a-3c) is bent over to form a lug 18, 19. Each lug 18, 19 is orientated essentially perpendicular to the base bottom contact platelet 9. Only the free ends 20, 21 of the two -lugs 18, 19 are respectively bent, for reasons of stability, in the direction of the underside of the contact platelet 9. Both the entire lug and the end of the lug itself are more stable thereby in each case. Each lug 18, 19 projects into the base bottom 8 of the lamp 1 (not illustrated) , and anchors the base bottom contact platelet in this way in the base bottom 8.<br>
A plan view and a longitudinal section of an alternative embodiment of an eye-shaped base bottom contact platelet 22 are illustrated schematically in<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
Figures 4a and 4b for the lamp 1 shown in Figure 1. By contrast with the variant shown in Figures 3a-3c, here the two narrow sides 23a, 23b of each elongated cutout<br>
24	are not cut at right angles to the associated long<br>
sides 25, 26. However, the narrow sides 23a, 23b are<br>
cut essentially parallel to the respectively closest<br>
outer edges 27a and 27b of the contact platelet 2 2.<br>
This renders the two cutouts 24 no longer rectangular,<br>
but approximately trapezoidal. Moreover,  the material<br>
of each cutout 24 is bent along the shorter long side<br>
25	thereof to form a lug 28 in each case, which is<br>
orientated perpendicular to the plane of the contact<br>
platelet 22 and to the longitudinal axis L thereof.<br>
Because of their trapezoidal shape,  the two lugs 28<br>
thus  formed have the advantage that they are more<br>
effectively anchored in the base bottom 8 of the lamp<br>
1, since they are pressed from behind (not illustrated)<br>
by the material of the base bottom 8 in the finished<br>
lamp. The cuts, executed in each case parallel to the<br>
closest outer edge 27a, 27b of the contact platelet 22,<br>
of the narrow sides 23a,  23b of the two cutouts 24<br>
result in a higher flexural strength by comparison with<br>
a   corresponding   right-angled  cut.   Finally,   the<br>
manipulability of this base bottom contact platelet 22<br>
is also more favorable than in the exemplary embodiment<br>
illustrated in Figures 3a-3c. Since the two lugs 28 are<br>
bent along the long side 25 instead of along the narrow<br>
side, the lugs 28 are conspicuously shorter, but also<br>
conspicuously wider, in turn. In any event, by contrast<br>
with the first named exemplary embodiment, when these<br>
base bottom contact platelets 22 are manipulated there<br>
is no  longer any mutual mechanical  sticking during<br>
separation in a vibrating conveyor.<br><br>
