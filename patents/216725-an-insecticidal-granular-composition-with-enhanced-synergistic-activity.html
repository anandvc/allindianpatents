COMPLETE   SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10)<br>
AN INSECTICIBAL GRANULAR COMPOSITION WITH ENHANCE^<br>
SYNERGISTIC ACTIVITY<br>
We, UNITED PHOSPHORUS LIMITED, a company Incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 and having iti registered Office at 3 - 11, GIDC. Vapl -396 195, State of Gujarat, India and having its offict at Uniphos House, €,D,Marg, Khar (West), Mnrabai - 400 052, State of Maharashtra, India.<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertain the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
The present invention relates to a granular insecticidal composition with enhanced synergistic insecticidai activity of two active insecticides Cypermeihrin and Atephate,<br>
The protection of crops and its produce from pest damage is essential in agriculture produce enhancement To help combat these problems, various chemicals their combinations and their formulations were invented in effective management of pests.<br>
Insecticides of many types and groups are reported in the literature and a large number are in use, commercially, for effective control of pests in agriculture.<br>
In many cases, active insecticides have shown more effectiveness in combination than when applied individually, Since the combination demonstrates a potency and activity level exceeding that, which might be expected , from a mere addition of the individual potencies of the components, are there by called as "syatrgisffl". The, present invention highlights the synergistic effect of combination of two known active insecticides "Cypermetltrm" and "Acephate", Both individual insecticides, forming this combination, which is the subject of this invention are known to be potent insecticides, for their activity independent of each other.<br>
 in  modem agriculture scenario, where insect has attained resistance,, due to indiscriminate and non-judicious use of pesticide, in view to manage insect pests for a desire of higher yields and those insects which are hard to kill by the existing commercial insecticides solely and in cyclic spray mixtures, warrants invention of a potent synergistic insecticidal composition.<br>
Cypermethrln and Acephate in a synergistic composition can have higher potentiation, as insecticide, and is highly effective in controlling pests including even hard to kill pests. The synergic composition gives a quick knockdown kill of the pests. It is comparatively more persistent. It penetrates deep in leaves, killing many internal feeders. Jt is strongly active as a contact and stomach insecticide. It is especially a potent lethal weapon to kill, hard-to-kill, resistance pests, which are normally not controlled by other insecticides. The said mixture of the insecticides can have a good effect for controlling Cotton bollworms and sucking pests. Its toxicity is low and safe for human and animals. Its residue is also small.<br>
The name "CyperiaethriaS an insecticide, belongs to synthetic pyrethroid group describes a chemical "substance having a solubility in water of 0.004 mgfi (at pH7); corresponds to a mixture of cis and trans isomers having following formula ;<br><br><br><br>
So being almost insoluble in water, it is soluble in acetone, chloroform, cyclohexanone, xylene &gt;450 {g/1); ethanol 337 (g% hextne 103 (g/1) at 20°C.<br>
Cypermethriit is presently recognised as the non-systemic insecticide with contact and stomach action. It also exhibits antifeeding action and good residual activity on treated plants, ft is used to control a wide range of insects, especially Lepidoptera. but also Coleopiera, Dipetera, Hemiptera and other classes in fruits ( including Citrus), Vines, Vegetables. Potatoes, Cucurbits, Lettuce, Capsicums, tomatoes, cereals, maize, soyabeans., cotton, coffee.. Cocoa., rice., peaeans, oilseed rape, beet, ornamentals., forestry, etc, It is also used for control of flies and other insects in animal houses; and mosquitoes, Cockroaches, housefiies and other insect, pests in public health. It is also used as an animal ectoparasiticide.<br>
Presently Cypermeihrin is most preferably formulated in the form of emjjsifiable concentrate (EC) which consists of Cypermethrin active ingredient dissolved in soivent(s) aiongwith surfactants at a levels required to give maximum stability with the formation of homogeneous emulsion on dilution. The use of organic solvent(s) is disadvantageous from environmental and cost view point, These organic solvents may exhibit toxicity and side-effects which may be adverse to the effect of the agricultural chemical itself or to the plant or crop as a whole or to its parts produced in treated fields. They show hazards during manufacturing, filling, packing, storage, transit, and use. During use dermal and respiratory toxic exposure to user are frequently observed. By using the organic solvents percutaneous toxicity and inflammability may also occur.<br><br>
It is a systemic insecticide of moderate persistence with residual activity lasting about 10-15 days. It is effective against a wide range of aphids, leaf miners, lepidopterous larvae, sawflies and thrips. It is non-phyisfexic on many crop plants. Technical grade Aeepftate (purity 80-90%) is a colourless solid; melting point 82 -89°C; solubility at room temperature : about 650 g/1 water ; &gt; 100 g/1 acetone, ethanol; 
The formulation of Aceghate presently in use is Acephate75%, Soluble Powder (sp). consists of Acephate active ingedient 75% (w/w),surtactant1to2%(w/w), inert filter<br><br>
	(Precipitated Silica) to make 100% (w/w),    It poses the problems like dust, low<br>
	pourability , high transportation cost, high capital manufacturing investment, not easily<br>
	measurable, difficulties is packing material disposal, handling problems, nigh risk of<br>
	caking and others.<br><br>
| The present invention  minimises dermal and respiratory toxic exposure to users also<br>
Eliminates  the percutaneous toxicity and flammability hazard ince it does not contains<br>
I any organic solvent     The product provided by this invention is relatively more<br>
advantageous and exhibit very desirable charateristics noted herein after.  It is thus, an<br>
object of the present invention to provide dust free granules of insecticide„cypermethrin <br>
containing concentration in the range of 0.1 to_I0.0% Active ingredient + Aceghate„<br>
containing cocerntration in the range 	of 1.0 to 50.0% of active ingredient.   it  is a further<br>
object of the present invention to provide a method for a making  such granular synergistic inseeticidal composition with dry flow, low compact, dust free granular compositions.<br>
Both of these compounds are capable of controlling a large spectrum of insects especially Lepidoprera, Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera and other class in fruits, vegetables, ornamentals etc. Cypermethrin is distinguished for its sudden shock effect alongwith good residual activity on treated plants. Acenhate is a systemic insecticide of moderate persistence with residual activity and is effective against a wide range of aphids,. ieafininers, lepidoptrous larvae, sawflies and thrips, It is non phytotoxic on many crop plants.<br>
In the present invention, the two effects i.e. residual activity and antifeeding action are synergistically combined into a formulation of improved (high yielding) effidency assuming that the dosage (mass of active ingredients per hectare) significantly lesser than that required, when these two components are utilised separately, under identical conditions, and also reduces the chances of resistance development (which will resuit when a single active ingredient is used for a long time and in high doses), it  is also providing a ready to use, compatible plant-mix in an effective synergistic composition along with the improvement in inseeticidal activity<br>
The present invention provides an inseeticidal granular composition with enhanced synergistic activity of ""Cypermethrin"" and ""Acephate"" and the process for preparing the synergistic mixture with solubilizer, wetting cum dispersing agent, disintegrating agent, emetic agent, antifoaming agent, anricaking agent, dye(s) and fjller(s)-<br>
Ths preliminary pilot trials of various strength of Cyperraethrin and Acephate carried to find out the composition, of Cypermeihrm + Acephate, which exhibits optimum synergistic value.<br>
The process for the preparation of granular synergistic inseeticidal composition in the form of dry flow, low compact, dost free granules of Cypsmiethris + Acephate comprises of the folowing steps:<br><br><br>
the required quantify of Cypemefkrin technical is preniixed with required quantity of solubilizer and emetic agent to prepare a spray solution (say A);<br>
the required quantity of Aoephate technical is preniixed with required quantity of wetting cum dispersing agent, emetic agent-, antifoaming agent, disintegrating agent, anticaking agent, dye(s) and required inert filier(s). Thereafter grinded to achieve intimate and efficient mixing of particles. The grinded mixture is then post mixed to have a homogeneous mixture of all these (say B);<br>
thereafter the above prepared spray solution (A) is sprayed on the homogeneous mixture (B) and again mixed thoroughly for sufficient time to have a homogeneous bulk which (on passing quality tests) is feed through a screw feeder into the hopper of granulator for granulation. After which these granules are processed for drying, sizing and sieving. The fines collected are recycled. The product obtained is a granular insecticidal composition in the form of dry flow, low compact, dust free granules of Cypermethrin + Aoephate.<br>
the granules are tested for required quality specifications and on passing filled and packed is desired  packing. This granulation  technique gives 99.5% of yield conversion. The granules with incorporation of inert ingredients,, by proper choice, enjoys all the formulation advantages as discussed before. All the advantages makes it beneficial from economic aspect, handling aspect and shows a very good performance during application.<br>
The granular composition prepared by the prefered method and prefered compositon of the present invention exhibits the properties like dust free, good pourability, good stability, free fiowability, easy to measure, better bioefficacy eaasy to handle, good dispersibility, good resistance to attrition, less expensive.<br>
The above stated properties provides the benefits like low transportation cost, low capital investment, free from solvent, no exposure to solvent vapours during manufacturing, storage,transit and use; less expensive packing, minimum contamination of the packing material, can be packed in Environment friendly packing like water soluble sachet/bags, best utilization of energy  sources, less wastage during processing, easy disposal of packing material, limited risk of caking, safe during storage, transit,and use, semi skilled operators required, less space required for production, with good market potential, easily reproducible during processing. Less risk of inhalation and irritation, spillage is easy to collect and clean, less health hazards to operators, optimum coverage per application, sustained action for longer effect, no need to prepare slurry or paste prior to spraying, use of less surfactants),<br>
:<br><br>
We have found that by using (1) Cypermethrin active ingredient; (2) Acephate active ingredient; (3) solubilizer; (4) emetic agent; (5) thereafter spraying a solution of (1), (3), and (4) on a homogenous mixture of (2) Acephate active ingredient and other inert ingredients like disintegrating agent, antifoaming agent, wetting cum dispersing agent,anticaking agent, dye(s), filler(s) and mixing thoroughly to produce homogeneous bulk; (6) feeding the homogeneous bulk (5) into granulator to obtain granules; which are then processed for drying, sizing, and sieving to have granules of synergistic insecticidal composition in the form of dry flow, low compact, dust free granules of Cypermethrin + Acephate which overcomes the disadvantages of emulsifiable concentrates and soluble powders.<br>

Results<br>
Sucking insect population<br>
All the various treatment dosage of Cypermethrin 5% DF , Acephate 75% DF and Cypenaethria (5) + Acephate (45) 50% DF, did reduce leafhopper population and they were at par with each other. Untreated control recorded a maximum of 5.72 leaf hopper per leaf.<br>
All the dosage levels of Acephate 75% DF and Cypermethrin + Acephate ready mix combination recorded lower population of wbitefliss and they were with each other and also Acephate 75% SP treatment. Whereas all the dosage level treatments of Cypermethrin 5% DF and Cypermethrin 25% EC were comparable to untreated control is recording whiteflies population. Minimum aphid population was recorded in all the dosage treatments of Acecphate 75% DF and Acephate 75% SP insecticide. Whereas Cypermethrin 5% DF and 25% EC treatments recorded relatively high population of aphids and in ready mix (Cypermethrin + Acephate) aphid population was significantly less than ttie Cypermelhfin alone treatment because inclusion of Acephate. But $iese treatments were comparable to untreated control which recorded 11/35 aphids per leaf. (Table-3)<br>
Percent bollworm incidence.<br>
All the dosage level treataieats of Cypermethrin + Acephate readyaiis recorded lower percent bollworm incidence and they were at par with each other and significantly superior over rest of the treatments. Alone treatments of Cypermethrin 5% DF at 70g a.i./ha treatment records 27.02 % bollworm indicence which was significantly superior over its lower dosage treatments and also Cypermethrin 25% EC and Acephate 75 SP treatments. Untreated control recorded a maximum of 41.77 percent bollworm incidence. (Table-4)<br><br><br>
GOB and BOB per plant.<br>
Maximum number of GOBs and minimum number of BOBs per paint were recorded in all the dosage level treatments of Cypermethrifl + Acephate readymix treatments and these treatments significantly supenor over other treatments. Alone treatments of Cypermethrin 5% DF at 70 g a.i./ha treatment recorded 25.0 GOBs aad 10 BOBs per plant respectively which was superior to its lower dosage treatments but comparable to all the dosage level treatments of Acephate 75 DF and SP treatments. Untreated control recorded 11.8 and 14.6 GOB and BOB per plant respectively. (Table-4)<br>
Yield<br>
Ready mix treatment of Cypermethrin (3) + Acephate (45) 50% DF at all the dosage levels recorded relatively higher seed cotton yield and its treatments were significantly superior over other treatments. Cypermethrin at 60 g a.i./ha treatments recorded 10.45 q/ha seed cotton which was at par with its higher its higher dosage treatments but superior to its lower dosage treatments. Whereas Acephate 75% DF at 575 g axha treatment recorded 11.42 q/ha seed cotton yield which was at par with both its higher as well as lower dosage treatments and also comparable standard check treatments. Untreated control recorded a minimum of 6.38 q/ha seed cotton yield. (Table-4)<br>

The above experiment on the Cotton for boUworms and Jassids established that Cypermethrin (5) +. Acephate (45) 50% DF &amp; Cypermethrin (6) + Acephate (54) 60% DF are showing the efficiency in controlling at par to each other whereas that with Cypermethrin (4) + Acephate(36) 40% DF shows normal results when used at the required active ingredient, dosage per hectare.<br>
From the above test 3, it is conclused that Cypermethrin (5)"+ Acephate (45) 50% DF is very effective when compared to higher concentration combinations. As it is evident that the higher concentration combination does not exhibit any considerable improvement in effectiveness but it only adds to unnecessary, excess use of active ingredient to cause environment pollution.<br>
The minimum dosage of Cypermethrin (5) + Acephate (45) 50% DF depend upon the type and the evaluation of the tiled of cultivation. The experiments conducted make it possible to recommend the following initial doses,<br><br>

Table - 5 shows the observations taken for ten days on necrosis, epinasty, hyponesty, leaf lip injury, leaf surface injury, vein clearing etc, for evaluation of Cypermethrifi (5) + Acephate (45) 50DF readymix, Cypermethriji 5% DF and Acephate 75DF and SP for phytotoxicity on cotton.<br>
Results:-<br>
There were no visible phytoxicity symptoms on Cotton Plants treated with various dosage level treatment of Cypermethrin (5) + Acephate (45) 50% DF T Cypermethrin 5% DF, Acephate 75% DF 
<br><br><br><br><br>
*	The above examples, their results and observations concluded that Cypermethfta + Acephate exhibits synergistic rasecticidal activity in the range of 1:1 to 1:10 (Cypermethrin:Acephate) at the required active ingredient, dosage per hectere.<br>
*	The synergistic iaseeticidal composition of Cypennethrin + Acephate can be prepared by followiskng method as described in example 1 to 10.<br><br>
•	It also reveias that optimum synergistic activity is being noticed in the ratio of 1:9 (i,e, 1:9 parts of Cypennethrin: Acephate) at the required active iagredieat dosage per hectere.<br>
•	Cypennethrin (5) 4- Acephate (45) 50%DF is very effective among the lower and higher concentration In the same ratio of 1:9 and is very effective against Cotton bollwonn, leaf hopper and sucking pest.<br>
•	The synergistic composition of Cypennethrin and Acephate reveals that the active<br>
iagredieat dosage per hectare is sigmfieaatly lesser then thaa that required when<br>
Cypennethrin and Acephate applied individually for same performance.<br>
   The synergistic compoisition proposed reduces the chances of resistance    development and act as a potent lethal weapon to kill these insects.<br><br>
