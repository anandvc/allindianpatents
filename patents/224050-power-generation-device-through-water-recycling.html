This invention relates to Power Generation device through water recycling system. In this system the water is stored in a tank of 500 litres capacity. The pressure pump delivers the water to the turbine from the storage tank. This water automatically by gravity goes back to the tank. The pressure pump is operated by external source of power initially. Once power generation started by the system the external source of power is eliminated by a change over switch and the pressure pump will be operated with the power obtained from the system itself.<br>
Pollution coupled with human respiratory ailments has become enormous with thermal generation and radiation hazard is concomitant with nuclear power and initial cost is alarmingly exorbitant. The depletion and degradation of fossilized fuels are driving the scientific and technological community to seek alternate source of energy. Solar energy though available in plenty is not harnessed fully and is not cost effective at present. Hence search for alternate energy source with cost effectiveness is being pursued relentlessly throughout the world.<br>
In the prior art it has been noticed that in the usual power generating systems, the device comprises of a driving apparatus such as a s prime mover and driven apparatus such as an electric generator, either or both of which are liable to fluctuations in speed or load, and is concerned more particularly with apparatus of the character in which the driving apparatus is adapted to drive simultaneously the driven apparatus and a device which moves within a fluid medium, such as water, and generates heat which is absorbed by the fluid medium itself.<br>
Where a discontinuous source of hydraulic power is employed to drive an electric generator by means of a water turbine, latter, when the head increases, has a tendency to race. But the same was offset by interposing a variable governor controlled hydraulic brake between the water turbine and the electric generator and interconnecting the same by means of a common mechanical connection, the variable hydraulic brake acts to maintain the speed of the generator constant irrespective of any tendency for the water motor to race or of variations in the load on the electric generator.<br><br>
Furthermore, the energy absorbed by the hydraulic brake is not wasted but it stays there in an accumulator which is a device for storing the energy to maintain the pressure. Later a cheap and simple turbine or water motor of the propeller type was used which worked continuously and efficiently despite fluctuations in the head of water, or variations in the electrical load on the generator, thus dispensing with the necessity of using a complicated water motor or turbine fitted with a governor or a speed regulating device, or a direct current generator.<br>
Whereas in the hydro-electric plants operating alternately as turbines and pumps such as those used for power stations with hydraulic storage have to generate a higher head when operating as pumps than the head available for their operating as turbines, since in the first case the losses in the impeller and conduit are to be added to the geometrical level difference while in the second case these losses are to be deducted from said level difference. This has been achieved in the past by running the machine at higher speed when pumping which is inconvenient with alternating current electrical equipment.<br>
Said hydro-electric plant is operated at the same rotational speed alternately as a turbine, driving an alternator and as a pump driven by said alternator operating as a synchronous motor, the difference in head occurring in these two operations owing to the additive sign of hydraulic losses in pump operation and subtractive sign thereof in turbine operation being attained by increasing the diameter and/or blade angle at the outer ends of the runner blades for pump operation as compared with turbine operation. This efficiency is defined for turbine operation by<br><br><br><br>
Thus with conventional Francis runner types, the power absorbed in pumping operation could be controlled only the throttling, using a throttle valve or the guide vanes for such throttling, thereby a large percentage of the energy put into the water by the pump is dissipated when reducing the quantity of water delivered by throttling. Consequently the power absorbed by the pump does not decrease as a linear function of quantity and at zero quantity, drops only to about half the power for normal operation. Accordingly the hydroelectric plant becomes inefficient in pumping operation when flexibility of delivery is attained by means of throttling, or if efficiency is to be maintained the plant becomes inflexible.<br>
By adjusting the blade angle not only the different requirements of head in turbine and pump operation can be met efficiently as described, but also the quantity delivered and power absorbed in pumping operation can be efficiently controlled.<br><br>
In another types of power generating units operating on a closed Rankine cycle comprises of a boiler for the evaporation of the motive fluid, a turbine fed with vapour from the boiler and driving a generator or any other load, a condenser for condensing the exhaust vapours from the turbine and means for recycling the condensed fluid to the boiler.<br>
In power generating units of the kind specified above the condenser is mounted above the boiler at a sufficiently high level for the liquid motive to return from the liquid side of the condenser to the boiler by gravity flow. Where the self-starting power generating unit is of the pump-fed type said container for the liquid motive fluid may be the boiler itself or an auxiliary vessel communicating with the boiler and located upstream the boiler and downstream the pump.<br>
Further in this case the arrangement is such that the liquid motive fluid used for lubrication is tapped off the return line of the liquid motive fluid upstream the boiler and downstream the pump. Such a specific location of the tapping off point between the boiler and the pump ensures smooth and uninterrupted lubrication during all operational phases of the unit.<br>
Thus during the start-up when the turbine, generator and pump are all still at rest, liquid motive fluid from the boiler is forced into the bearings by the pressure which gradually builds up in the boiler. During the following operational phase when the pump operates, feeding of lubricating fluid into the bearings is taken over automatically by the pump without any interruption. Where in the course of the operation the pump is interrupted either intentionally or unintentionally lubrication of the bearings is again taken over by the boiler arid continues uninterruptedly in consequence of the pressure prevailing in the boiler. Likewise, during the slow-down period the lubrication fluid originates again from the boiler and is forced therefrom into the bearings by the residual pressure still prevailing in the boiler. Thus it is noticed that lubrication of bearing etc., are normally required and so it becomes a cumbersome process and also an apparatus.<br><br>
The primary object of this invention is to operate the turbine within 30°C or ambient of water temperature. This system eliminates the heat. Frequent lubrication of bearings is avoided. In freezing temperature anti-freezing element is to be used.<br>
The invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein the<br>
Fig. 1 shows the elevation view of the power generation device showing the turbine as mounted on the water tank, which is provided with the pressure pump and the suction pump according to this invention.<br>
Fig.2 shows a partial sectional elevation view of the connection between the turbine and the alternator through the special spindle housing assembly according to this invention.<br>
Fig.3 shows the schematic sectional view of the specially designed turbine mounted on the spindle.<br>
A turbine based on rotational kinematics has been specially designed and fabricated for this purpose. This type of turbine is entirely a new design and not found in any conventional turbine of Steam, Gas or Water. The water is drawn from a storage tank of 500 liters capacity. For this purpose a pressure pump of 3HP capacity is delivering the water at a Constant pressure. An alternator of 3 times the capacity (10HP) has been coupled to the turbine. The pressurized water rotates the turbine and that is coupled to the alternator which generates power. This power is taken to a Control Board for distribution. Four electric motors totaling 10HP can be connected as load. When the alternator is loaded by switching ON the motors, all the motors are able to start and run. There is ample provision to take care of the load conditions. Further it has been intensively tested to see the capacity of the turbine in this system by independently loading the turbine.<br><br>
Now referring to Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 of the accompanying drawings, the water recycling system comprises of a water tank 5, which has castor wheels for better mobility. The water tank 5 is connected on one side to a pressure pump 6 to deliver water by force in the form of a jet to the blades 1 of the turbine 3, through a pressure inlet 10. The turbine 3 has a turbine box 2 housing the turbine blades 1 inside in it. The said turbine 3 is provided with necessary feed control devices such as pressure variable drumS and velocity variable drum 9 to vary the velocity of the water jet and also the volume of the water flow on the said turbine blades 1. The water tank 5 is provided with a sturdy base 4 to withstand the running of the turbine at high speeds. A suction pump 7 having a suction inlet 11 is connected to the turbine 3 to draw water back for recycling. The suction pump 7 is provided with suction outlet pipe 12 to recycle the pumped in the turbine 3, back into the water tank 5.<br>
There are special feedback arrangement devices to take care of the load, frequency and the voltage. The turbine 3 is made to rotate by a water jet delivered through a water pressure pump 6. The turbine attains a critical speed within 60 seconds. The turbine is directly coupled to the alternator 13 through a coupler and spindle housing 14. At this critical speed the alternator 13 delivers the necessary voltage and frequency. The generated power is taken to a control board for distribution.<br>
When load is applied to the alternator, the pressure pump 6 automatically delivers water at higher pressure of water jet to maintain the voltage and frequency as can be seen in the following table given below. The air suction arrangements on the top of the turbine will make more velocity and additional power.<br><br><br>
By physical calculation using the formula Power = Torque x angular Velocity<br>
= 2nNT/60<br>
T (Torque) = Jma where, J m is the moment of inertia = V? mr2 where m is the weight of the rotating body and 'r' is the perpendicular radial distance, and 'a' is the angular acceleration<br>
For constant rotation Jm x angular velocity is a constant<br>
In this invention the specially designed Turbine has total weight of the rotating body of 36 Kgs and the perpendicular radial distance of 0.2 mtr.<br>
Hence,	Jm     =	l/2mr2<br>
i.e. M&gt; x 36 x 0.2 x 0.2<br>
0.72 kg m2<br>
Torque	=        Jm x angular velocity<br>
i.e. 0.72 x 2nNT/60 (where N = 1500 RPM)<br>
0.72 x 157 = 113.04 NM<br>
Power	=	2TINT/60       =	2x3.14x1500<br>
	 x 113.04<br>
