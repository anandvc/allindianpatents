				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to the transmission and the<br>
implementation of control instructions for access to functionalities of<br>
receivers, as well as to corresponding devices.<br>
In order to be able to control the degree of accessibility to a<br>
receiver across a network, it is known to determine a set of authorized or<br>
prohibited actions and to communicate them to the receiver. To do this, a list<br>
of permissions referred to as the "white list" or conversely, a list of prohibited<br>
operations referred to as the "black list" is transmitted. The receiver records<br>
this information in memory and uses it subsequently to establish on reception<br>
of each message across the network whether it should pay heed to actions<br>
requested by this message.<br>
This technique thus makes it possible to allocate variable rights to<br>
a set of receivers, then to send messages collectively, in particular by<br>
broadcasting. The expression "broadcasting" designates the transmitting of<br>
identical data to a set of destinations, whether this be performed in particular<br>
by radio broadcasting, via cable or via the Internet. The filtering of the<br>
operations dispatched in the messages is then performed directly at the level<br>
of the receivers, thereby enabling in particular various categories of receivers<br>
to be taken into account (for example according to distinct types of<br>
subscriptions to radio or audiovisual programmes) without having to worry<br>
about this when sending the messages.<br>
Another advantage of the white or black lists is that it makes it<br>
possible to reduce the risks of fraudulent actions via the network, which could<br>
jeopardize the correct functioning of the receivers. It is in fact possible to<br>
authorize only accesses to functionalities required for the current functioning<br>
of the receiver, locking out accesses to all other responsive functionalities.<br>
Hereinbelow and for simplicity, the expression "permission lists"<br>
will designate white or black lists, the prohibitions of access of a black list<br><br>
being regarded as implicitly defining permissions (complementary operations<br>
authorized).<br>
Such permission lists are used in particular for dispatching<br>
services to interactive television sets.<br>
However, even if the receivers are supplied with permission lists in<br>
permanent memory, it is desirable and usually necessary to modify these lists<br>
subsequently. To avoid the need for personnel to travel and to avoid manual<br>
operations, they are therefore generally rendered remotely updateable. Such<br>
a mode of updating actually becomes inevitable once a receiver alternately<br>
receives several types of services responding to distinct permissions. The<br>
modifications are then performed by dispatching new permission lists,<br>
transmitted selectively (by means of local identifiers) via the message<br>
transmission network.<br>
A drawback of these dispatchings of permissions via the network<br>
is that they are open to the risks of the pirating of lists, as well as to the<br>
fraudulent production of false permission lists aimed at remote control of the<br>
normally inaccessible functionalities of receivers. Moreover, each updating of<br>
lists requires a set of laborious operations, both at the sending and the<br>
receiving end, which in certain circumstances have to be repeated often.<br>
The subject of the present invention is a device for the<br>
transmission of control instructions for access to functionalities of one or<br>
more receivers, which allows simplified updating of the permissions granted<br>
to the receivers, both at send and at receive level.<br>
Moreover, the transmission device according to the invention<br>
allows increased security of such updates with regard to possible fraudulent<br>
actions.<br><br>
The invention also relates to a device for implementing control<br>
instructions which is able to modify the permissions within a receiver, tailored<br>
to the transmission device of the invention.<br>
The invention, which applies in particular in the field of interactive<br>
television, is also concerned with a sender and a receiver respectively<br>
comprising transmission and implementation devices in accordance with the<br>
invention, and with processes, a computer program and a corresponding<br>
message.<br>
To this end, the subject of the invention is a device for the<br>
transmission of control instructions for access to functionalities of at least one<br>
receiver. This transmission device comprises means for registering<br>
permission identifiers in messages intended for this receiver.<br>
According to the invention, the registration means are provided for<br>
registering the permission identifiers in service announcement messages.<br>
These permission identifiers consist of indicators each having a value chosen<br>
from an authorization value and a prohibition value relating to access to at<br>
least one of the functionalities of the receivers.<br>
The expression "service announcement message" is understood to<br>
mean a message dispatched upstream within the framework of a service,<br>
giving information and instructions relating to the subsequent dispatching of<br>
one or more other messages of this service. These other messages are<br>
bearers of content ("content messages") or of immediate-triggering<br>
instructions ("triggers"). The service announcement message comprises a<br>
header in the SAP format (standing for Session Announcement Protocol) and<br>
a payload in the SDP format (standing for Session Description Protocol).<br>
Surprisingly, the permissions are therefore not dispatched in a<br>
centralized manner, in the form of white or black lists, but specifically for each<br><br>
service concerned, within the actual service announcement message. This<br>
embodiment offers great flexibility of action, since it makes it possible to<br>
adapt specifically and in real time to each service. Moreover, it allows<br>
increased reliability since it avoids the need to dispatch lists containing in<br>
essence all of the access control information.<br>
In an advantageous form of deployment of the permissions, each<br>
of the service announcement messages comprises a variable-length<br>
authentication field, and the registration means are provided for registering<br>
the permission identifiers in this authentication field. This embodiment is<br>
beneficial through its simplicity, since it allows very flexible utilization of a field<br>
already provided in the service announcement message, without having to<br>
add a specific field.<br>
In another advantageous form of deployment of the permissions,<br>
each of the announcement messages comprises a payload field, and the<br>
registration means are provided for registering the permission identifiers in<br>
this payload field. In this way, greater flexibility is available in defining the<br>
permissions.<br>
The device of the invention also allows increased security, as set<br>
forth hereinbelow. In what follows, the following designations are employed:<br>
-	"authentication", a procedure relating to a guarantee of origin<br>
and of integrity of messages travelling through a network, relying on the use<br>
of digital signatures contained in the messages and produced by means of<br>
keys before sending the messages,<br>
-	"encryption", a procedure of substituting for a plain text, an<br>
unintelligible text which cannot be utilized as is,<br>
-	"decryption", a procedure for replacing an encrypted text with a<br>
plain text, obtained by returning the encrypted text to its initial form,<br>
-	"enciphermenf, a procedure for determining an encrypted text<br>
from a message or from a portion of a message, this encrypted text being<br><br>
used either as replacement for a plain text (encryption), or as a signature<br>
(authentication),<br>
-	"decipherment", a procedure of at least partial reconstruction of<br>
a plain text from an encrypted text, either for attesting the origin and the<br>
integrity of the message containing the text (authentication), or for replacing<br>
the encrypted text with the plain text (decryption),<br>
-	"securing", a procedure of enciphering a message or a part of a<br>
message, for authentication or encryption purposes,<br>
-	"identification", a procedure of using an encrypted text received<br>
in a message for identifying this message, either by its origin and its integrity<br>
(authentication), or by its content (decryption); in respect of authentication,<br>
the identification can comprise a deciphering of the signature, or an<br>
enciphering of the part of the message which served for the signature so as<br>
to compare the result with the signature received.<br>
The transmission device preferably comprises enciphering control<br>
means for signing at least a part of each of said messages, that part including<br>
the permission identifiers.<br>
It is thus possible to authenticate the origin and the content of the<br>
announcement messages, even as far as the permissions are concerned,<br>
thereby making it possible to considerably reduce the risks of interception of<br>
such an announcement message and of fraudulent modification of the<br>
permissions which it contains.<br>
Preferably, the permission identifiers of the announcement<br>
message are not encrypted, so as to allow fast identification of the control<br>
information. This makes it all the more advantageous to take them into<br>
account in the digital signature affixed in the message.<br><br>
Preferably, the announcement messages are ATVEF (i.e according to the<br>
Advanced Television Enhancement Forum standard) service and/or system<br>
service announcement messages.<br>
Each ATVEF announcement message of a service is followed by at least one<br>
HTTP (according to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol method) content message<br>
then by one or more service triggers. The system announcement messages of a<br>
service, generally private and multicast, are for their part followed by a binary<br>
file of the service. The latter announcement messages advantageously have a<br>
form similar to that of the ATVEF announcement messages.<br>
According to a first form of the permissions, at least one of the permission<br>
identifiers pertains to functionalities for access, preferably automatic, to a<br>
modem for initiating a connection to an online server of a server of a service<br>
operator. This service operator is advantageously connected to the transmission<br>
device.<br>
According to a second form of the permission, at least one of the permission<br>
identifiers pertains to functionalities for using a secure connection to an online<br>
server.<br>
According to a third form of the permission, at least one of the permission<br>
identifiers pertains to functionalities for access, preferably automatic, to at least<br>
one storage space for reading data or writing data permanently from or to that<br>
storage space. The storage space or spaces are preferably a hard disk, a flash<br>
memory and/or a chip card.<br><br>
According to a fourth form of the permissions, at least one of the<br>
permission identifiers pertains to functionalities for access to a tuner of the<br>
receiver so as to modify a current station.<br>
The various forms of the permissions are advantageously<br>
combined in the announcement messages.<br>
The invention also concerns a message sender, characterized in<br>
that it comprises a transmission device according to any one of the<br>
embodiments of the invention.<br>
It also applies to a device for the implementation of control<br>
instructions for access to functionalities of a receiver. This implementation<br>
device comprises means for reading permission identifiers in messages<br>
received thereby.<br>
According to the invention, the reading means are provided for<br>
reading the permission identifiers in service announcement messages, those<br>
identifiers consisting of indicators each having a value chosen from an<br>
authorization value and a prohibition value relating to access to at least one<br>
of the functionalities of the receiver. Moreover, the instruction implementation<br>
device is preferably provided for receiving the control instructions transmitted<br>
by a device for transmitting control instructions in accordance with any one of<br>
the embodiments of the invention.<br>
The invention also relates to a message receiver characterized in<br>
that it comprises an implementation device according to the invention. This<br>
receiver is preferably provided for receiving the messages originating from a<br>
sender of messages in accordance with the invention.<br>
The subject of the invention is moreover a computer program<br>
product. According to the invention, the latter comprises functionalities for<br><br>
implementing the means of the transmission device, or of the implementation<br>
device, for control instructions, in accordance with any one of the<br>
embodiments of the invention.<br>
The expression "computer program product" is understood to<br>
mean a computer program medium which can consist not only of a storage<br>
space containing the program, such as a disk or a cassette, but also of a<br>
signal, such as an electrical or optical signal.<br>
The invention also applies to a message intended to be dispatched<br>
over a network to at least one receiver, that message including at least one<br>
permission identifier.<br>
According to the invention, this message is a service<br>
announcement message, the permission identifier consisting of an indicator<br>
having a value chosen from an authorization value and a prohibition value<br>
relating to access to at least one facility of the receiver. Furthermore, it is<br>
preferably obtained by means of a transmission device according to any one<br>
of the embodiments of the invention.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is a process for transmitting control<br>
instructions for access to functionalities of at least one receiver. In this<br>
process, permission identifiers are registered in messages intended for the<br>
receiver.<br>
According to the invention, the permission identifiers are registered<br>
in service announcement messages, those identifiers consisting of indicators<br>
each having a value chosen from an authorization value and a prohibition<br>
value relating to access to at least one of the functionalities of the receiver.<br><br>
Moreover, this process for transmitting control instructions is<br>
preferably implemented by means of a transmission device in accordance<br>
with any one of the embodiments of the invention.<br>
Yet another aspect of the invention is a process for implementing<br>
control instructions for access to functionalities of a receiver. In this process,<br>
permission identifiers are read from messages received by the receiver.<br>
According to the invention, the permission identifiers are read from<br>
service announcement messages, those permission identifiers consisting of<br>
indicators each having a value chosen from an authorization value and a<br>
prohibition value relating to access to at least one of the functionalities of the<br>
receiver.<br>
Moreover, this process for implementing control instructions is<br>
preferably implemented by means of an implementation device in accordance<br>
with the invention.<br>
The invention will be better understood and illustrated by means of<br>

The figures are regarded as forming an integral part of the<br>
disclosure.<br><br>
In the figures, identical or similar elements are designated by the<br>
same references. Moreover, the functional entities described and illustrated<br>
do not necessarily correspond to physically distinct entities of the systems,<br>
but may for example consist of functionalities of one and the same piece of<br>
software or of circuits of one and the same component.<br>
In Figures 3 to 5, 9, 12 and 13, the numbers indicated give, in bits,<br>
the distributions of fields in the messages represented. Moreover, the suffixes<br>
A and C are used to designate authentication entities, the suffix B for<br>
encryption entities and the suffix A' for authentication entities after encryption.<br>
A send and receive assembly comprises (Figure 1) one or more<br>
senders 1 of MSG messages via a network 5 to one or more receivers 2. In<br>
the example detailed below, the network 5 is a broadcasting unidirectional<br>
transmission network and we concentrate on a general broadcasting server<br>
(associated with the sender 1) sending to a plurality of customers (associated<br>
respectively with the receivers 2). For simplicity, we concentrate on just one<br>
of the senders 1 and one of the receivers 2.<br>
Very diagrammatically, the sender 1 is provided so as to receive a<br>
message MO and transform it into the message MSG to be sent, by adding<br>
various items of information intended for transfer over the network 5 and for<br>
the reading of the message MSG and of possible subsequent messages by<br>
the appropriate receivers 2. Correspondingly, the receiver 2 is provided to<br>
extract from the message MSG received the meaningful content represented<br>
by the message MO. The message MO is preferably a message of a particular<br>
type (service announcement message), as detailed further below, the sender<br>
1 and the receiver 2 not processing all the types of messages in the same<br>
way.<br>
The sender 1 comprises in particular (Figure 1) various elements<br>
intended for this transformation of the message MO, such as in particular:<br><br>
a unit 14 for registering permissions, which is designed to<br>
insert permission identifiers PERM into the messages MO; these identifiers<br>
PERM make it possible to transmit control instructions to the receiver 2 for<br>
access to various functionalities of the latter;<br>
a device 3 for securing messages, for defining judicious modes<br>
of encipherment (signature or encryption) of at least a part of the message<br>
MO, for triggering this encipherment and inserting information for utilizing the<br>
enciphered parts, intended for the receiver 2, into the message MO; in the<br>
example chosen, the registration unit 14 is upstream of the securing device 3,<br>
in the sender 1; as variants, their positions are reversed, or at least one of<br>
these two subassemblies is upstream of the sender 1;<br>
and an encipherment library 15, for example a library of<br>
dynamic links or DLL (Dynamic Link Library), comprising an enciphering<br>
module 17; by convention, this library 15 is allocated to the sender 1,<br>
although in practice it may be a program simply accessible by the sender in<br>
the strict sense.<br>
More precisely, the encipherment library 15 is furnished with an<br>
indexed table 16 of enciphering keys K1, K2 ... Kn, the enciphering module 17<br>
being designed to perform the encipherment according to one of the<br>
enciphering keys K1, as a function of instructions given by the message<br>
securing device 3. Moreover, the latter comprises:<br>
an encipherment control unit 11, capable of triggering the<br>
enciphering module 17 by communicating the necessary information thereto,<br>
in particular regarding the choice of the enciphering key K1 to be used;<br>
- a unit 12 for changing current key, making it possible to modify<br>
the current key K1 to be used by dispatching corresponding information to the<br>
enciphering control unit 11; this unit 12 relies for example on random (both as<br>
regards the occurrences and the chosen values) modifications of the current<br>
key K1, with possibility of direct intervention by a user;<br>
and a unit 13 for registering in the message MO a key identifier<br>
KeylD, making it possible to indicate for the attention of the receiver 2 the<br><br>
current enciphering key K1 chosen; in the example presented, this registration<br>
unit 13 routinely performs the recording of the key identifier KeylD in the<br>
messages MO of the type concerned.<br>
Similarly, the receiver 2 comprises in particular:<br>
-	a unit 24 for reading the permission identifiers PERM in the<br>
message MSG received;<br>
a device 4 for identifying messages, for defining the relevant<br>
modes of identification (by deciphering/enciphering for authentication or<br>
decryption) of the enciphered part of the message MSG and for triggering this<br>
identification;<br>
-	and an identification library 25 comprising an identification<br>
module 27 and allocated by convention to the receiver 2.<br>
More precisely, the identification library 25 is furnished with an<br>
indexed table 26 of identification keys K'1 K'2 ... K'n, corresponding one to<br>
one to the enciphering keys K1, K2 ... Kn of the enciphering library 15. The<br>
identification module 27 is designed to perform the identification according to<br>
one of the identification keys K'j, as a function of instructions given by the<br>
message identification device 4. Moreover, the latter comprises:<br>
-	an identification control unit 21, capable of triggering the<br>
identification module 27 by communicating the necessary information thereto,<br>
in particular regarding the choice of the identification key K'j to be used;<br>
-	and a unit 23 for extracting from the message MSG the key<br>
identifier KeylD, giving the current identification key K'j chosen in<br>
correspondence with the current enciphering key K'j of the sender 2.<br>
The succinct account given above is essentially functional, and it is<br>
exclusively centred around specific features in conjunction with a particular<br>
assembly for securing and identifying messages. The sender 1 can in reality<br>
comprise several securing devices such as that referenced 15, possibly in<br>
combination For example, the securing of the messages combines<br><br>
encryption and signature, and/or distinct devices are applied respectively to<br>
various types of messages. Similarly, the receiver 2 can comprise several<br>
identification devices. Such possibilities will become more clearly apparent in<br>
the light of the examples hereinbelow of particular embodiments.<br>
A first embodiment of the sender 1, referenced 1A (Figure 2), is<br>
applied to authentication. In this embodiment, the sender 1A subjects only the<br>
service announcement messages MO to the operations for securing and<br>
registering the permission identifiers PERM, the other types of messages<br>
(such as content messages and triggers) not being subjected thereto. The<br>
service announcement messages considered are by way of illustration<br>
ATVEF announcement messages or system announcement messages, these<br>
two types of messages having a similar structure in the examples considered.<br>
The messages MSG produced, denoted MSG-A, are subjected to general<br>
broadcasting via the network 5.<br>
In the example set forth, the enciphering keys K1 (signature keys)<br>
are moreover private keys, and the identification keys K'1 (authentication<br>
keys) public keys which may be distributed to the customers, including<br>
possibly via the network 5 (transmission is then preferably made secure). By<br>
way of more specific example, the signature keys K1 have 596 bytes each and<br>
the identification keys K'1 are deciphering keys of 148 bytes each, these keys<br>
being created respectively from the signature keys K1 and transferred so as to<br>
reside at the customers' premises. The indexed tables 16 and 26 of<br>
respectively signature and authentication keys each comprise for example 10<br>
corresponding keys.<br>
The sender 1A essentially comprises:<br>
a server drive system 31, referenced 31 A, including the unit 12<br>
for changing current key, the unit 13 for registering the key identifier KeylD<br>
and the unit 14 for registering the permission identifiers PERM; this drive<br>
system 31A is designed to receive the message MO from an information<br><br>
source 10 and to produce a message M1, containing the key identifier KeylD<br>
for authentication, denoted KeylD[SGN], and the permission identifiers PERM<br>
but without signature;<br>
a broadcasting server 32A comprising in particular a control<br>
unit 37 controlling the operation of the assembly of elements of the server<br>
32A (links not represented in Figure 2 for simplicity) and a database 33<br>
designed to gather the messages M1 originating from the drive system 31A;<br>
this broadcasting server 32A is intended to transform the message M1 into<br>
the message MSG-A;<br>
and the enciphering library 15, in the form of an authentication<br>
library 15A.<br>
The broadcasting server 32A also comprises two modules acting<br>
successively on the message M1: a completion module 35 and an<br>
encapsulation module 36. The completion module 35, which contains the<br>
enciphering control unit 11 in the form of an authentication control unit 11 A, is<br>
responsible for registering complementary information (Internet addresses,<br>
ports, etc.) in the message M1 so as to produce a message M2, and for<br>
calling upon the authentication library 15A so as to produce a signature SGN<br>
and integrate it into the message M2, thus producing a message M3. The<br>
presence of the authentication key identifier KeylD[SGN] in the message M2<br>
dispatched to the library 15A allows the latter to select the desired key K1<br>
immediately so as to generate the signature SGN. Advantageously, the<br>
current enciphering key K1 is preserved in memory in the library 15A.<br>
The subcontracting by the broadcasting server 32A of the<br>
signature to the library 15A, as well as the possible recording of the current<br>
key K1 in the library 15A rather than in the server 32A, allow the latter to retain<br>
a character of a general nature. What is more, they allow the drive system<br>
31A and the library 15A to retain together control of the operations relating to<br>
the key identifiers KeylD[SGN) and permission identifiers PERM. Moreover,<br>
the addition of the signature SGN at the end of the chain, just before<br><br>
broadcasting by the broadcasting server 32A, is beneficial since the latter can<br>
thus be fed by numerous customers without it being necessary to duplicate<br>
the signature library 15A and the enciphering keys K1, and since the<br>
modification of the key identifier KeylD[SGN] can be centralized.<br>
Furthermore, in case of compression and/or encryption, the signature is<br>
effected after these operations.<br>
The signature SGN is calculated preferably over the whole of the<br>
announcement message M2, including the header (which contains in<br>
particular the identifiers KeylD[SGN] and PERM) and the payload, thus<br>
making it possible in particular to detect any external modification of the data<br>
relating to the current signature key KeylD[SGN] (hence for authentication by<br>
the customers) and to the permissions.<br>
The encapsulation module 36 is intended to transform the<br>
announcement message M3 by chopping and addition of layers for transport<br>
over the network 5. In the example presented, the module 36 generates IP<br>
(Internet Protocol) packets with UDP (Unidirectional Data Protocol)/IP/SLIP<br>
(Serial Line IP) layers. For content messages, the module 36 uses,<br>
beforehand, the UHTTP (Unidirectional HyperText Transfer Protocol) protocol<br>
and the MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) format.<br>
The message MSG-A thus signed allows each of the customers to<br>
verify the authenticity of the services provided: if the customer recognizes the<br>
signature SGN as valid, he opens listening sockets for the content messages<br>
and possibly for the triggers which have to follow. In the converse case, the<br>
customer declines to take the announcement message MSG-A into<br>
consideration. To authenticate the signature SGN, the customer uses the key<br>
identifier KeylD[SGN], which allows him immediately to select the appropriate<br>
identification key K'j from the corresponding identification library 25<br>
(authentication library). He is thus able to decide rapidly whether to open the<br>
sockets or not and thus avoid missing out on all or some of the content<br><br>
packets arriving subsequently. For example, when a first content packet is<br>
broadcast 500 ms after the announcement message, it is absolutely essential<br>
for all the signature verification and socket opening operations to have been<br>
executed during this time span.<br>
A specific implementation of the sender 1A is illustrated<br>
hereinbeiow. In this example, the announcement messages MSG-A of the<br>
ATVEF type are broadcast on a multicast IP address 224.0.1.113, port 2670,<br>
and those of the system type on a multicast IP address 235.0.1.113, port<br>
32670. Each of the messages MSG-A (Figure 3) consists of a header in the<br>
SAP format denoted SAP-A and a payload in the SDP format, the header<br>
SAP-A comprising the following fields:<br>
-	version V of SAP (3 bits, V=1);<br>
-	ARTEC (5 bits) composed of 5 items:<br><br>
-	type of address A (0 for the IPv4 protocol, 1 for IPv6);<br>
-	reserved field R (0);<br>
-type of message T (0 for a session announcement<br>
packet, 1 for a session erasure packet);<br>
-encryption field E (for "Encryption": 0 for SDP<br>
unencrypted, 1 for SDP encrypted),<br>
-compression C (0 for uncompressed payload, 1 for<br>
compressed payioad);<br>
-	length L-AUTH (unsigned value on 8 bits) of an authentication<br>
field AUTH referenced AUTH-A and inserted just before the SDP, and<br>
expressed as a number of 32-bit words;<br>
hash identifier (protection algorithm used by the Internet for<br>
digital signatures) MSG ID HASH (on 16 bits), the hash value having to<br>
change whenever a field of the SDP is modified; when this identifier equals 0,<br>
the customer must always subject the SDP to a parsing ;<br>
-	IP address denoted ORIG (1 word of 32 bits) of the sender 1 A,<br>
hence of the broadcasting server 32A; this address can be set to 0.0.0.0 for a<br><br>
zero value of the hash identifier and in the absence of passage through a<br>
proxy;<br>
and authentication field AUTH-A, whose length is determined<br>
by the parameter L-AUTH.<br>
The authentication field AUTH-A (Figure 4) comprises not only a<br>
signature field SGN of 128 bytes (size chosen as a function of system<br>
limitation), but also a specific authentication header denoted ENT-A<br>
occupying four bytes, which includes the following subfields:<br>
-	version V of protocol used (3 bytes, V=1);<br>
padding indicator P (1 bit), which serves to signal the presence<br>
of possible padding so as to culminate in an authentication field having a total<br>
length which is a multiple of double-words (32-bit words); in the present case,<br>
P=0 (no padding) since the authentication field has a total length of 132<br>
bytes;<br>
-	type of authentication used TYPE (4 bits); in this instance,<br>
TYPE=C) (PGP format, standing for Pretty Good Privacy);<br>
PERM permission flags (8 bits);<br>
field reserved (8 bits) for future use;<br>
-	key identifier KeylD[SGN] (8 bits).<br>
The header ENT-A therefore contains two bytes which are<br>
especially useful for the customers: those of the fields KeylD[SGN] and<br>
PERM, which respectively allow the customers to immediately determine the<br>
correct authentication key K'1 and to ascertain the appropriate permissions in<br>
respect of the subsequent messages of the service (content messages and<br>
triggers).<br>
In the example presented, the byte available for the permission<br>
flags PERM is utilized in the form of a mask of eight values. The permission<br>
flags PERM pertain to accesses to the following functionalities, relating to so-<br>
called critical resources of the receiver 2 (the authorization values are first<br>
given in hexadecimal notation):<br><br>
0x0001: access to a modem of the receiver 2 so as to initiate a<br>
connection to an online server of a service operator associated with the<br>
sender 1,<br>
0x0002: access to a modem of the receiver 2 so as to initiate a<br>
connection to an online server of any service operator;<br>
0x0004: use of a secure connection to an online server;<br>
0x0008: access to a hard disk of the receiver 2 so as to read<br>
data therefrom or write data thereto permanently;<br>
0x00010: access to a flash memory of the receiver 2 so as to<br>
read data therefrom or write data thereto permanently;<br>
0x00020: access to a chip card of the receiver 2 so as to read<br>
data therefrom or write data thereto permanently;<br>
0x00040: access to a tuner of the receiver 2 so as to modify a<br>
current station.<br>
In a variant embodiment, the byte available for the permissions is<br>
used in the form of a table with 256 entries, each of the entries corresponding<br>
to a unique permission level. As in the example above, eight permissions are<br>
obtained which can be inter-combined.<br>
The number of permissions can be extended without difficulty, in<br>
particular by incorporating the reserved field of one byte into the permission<br>
field (switch to sixteen permissions) and/or by allocating two double-words<br>
instead of one to the header ENT-A of the authentication field AUTH-A.<br>
While operational, the drive system 31 adds a header in the SAP<br>
format to the service announcement message M0, integrating therein in<br>
particular the permission flags PERM for this service and possibly a key<br>
identifier KeylD[SGN] (the latter is configurable by the drive system 31, but by<br>
default, is determined by the library 15A). The length L-AUTH of the<br>
authentication field AUTH-A is fixed at one double-word (L-AUTH=1), in such<br>
a way as to register the header ENT-A therein without the signature SGN.<br><br>
The message M1 obtained (Figure 5) then contains in the authentication field<br>
AUTH1 (reduced to a header ENT1) of the header in the SAP format<br>
(denoted SAP1) only the permission flags PERM and a reserved field,<br>
initialized to zero. This message is received in the database 33 of the<br>
broadcasting server 32A.<br>
The completion module 35 then verifies whether the header SAP1<br>
is present (if not, it adds it without signature), registers in M1 the<br>
complementary information required (so-called patch of the SDP with<br>
addresses and ports of the content messages and triggers), and calls upon<br>
the library 15A, passing as arguments a buffer memory containing the<br>
message M1 and a size of the buffer.<br>
The library 15A performs the following operations:<br>
-	verification of whether the permission flags PERM are present;<br>
if they are, normal continuation of operations; if they are not, return to the<br>
broadcasting server 32A with error code; in an improved version, should the<br>
permission flags PERM be absent, allocation of a default mask;<br>
-	verification of whether the service announcement message M1<br>
is already signed; if it is, return to the broadcasting server 32A;<br>
-	if it is not, updating of the length L-AUTH to 132 bytes (0x21<br>
double-words), addition and updating of the header ENT-A of the<br>
authentication field AUTH-A, calculation (with L-AUTH=1) and addition into<br>
the buffer of the signature SGN and updating of the size of the buffer; the<br>
signature SGN is determined from the header SAP1 as a whole (not<br>
containing the signature field SGN, since L-AUTH=1) and from the payload of<br>
the message M1; it is obtained by the RSA (Rivest - Shamir - Adleman)<br>
algorithm, by means of the calculation of a hash MD5 over this whole, of the<br>
recovery of the appropriate current signature key K1 and of the calculation of<br>
the RSA signature on hash with this key K1; in a variant embodiment, the<br>
authentication field AUTH-A is totally ignored in respect of the signature<br>
(L-AUTH=0 instead of a double-word);<br><br>
and return to the broadcasting server 32A.<br>
Next, the encapsulation module 36 encapsulates the message M3<br>
thus obtained, before general broadcasting over the network 5.<br>
With this technique, the signature is calculated just once per<br>
service (it is calculated on the announcement message), whether this service<br>
be dispatched as a carrousel or in one occurrence (one shot).<br>
To modify the key identifier KeylD[SGN], a message is for example<br>
dispatched to the broadcasting server 32A across an interface for the<br>
programming of applications or API (Application and Programming Interface),<br>
the server 32A then merely notifying the library 15A of the new value of this<br>
identifier - the modification is for example performed routinely every month.<br>
in an illustrative example hereinbelow of service announcement<br>
messages at input (M1) and at output (MSG-A) of the broadcasting server<br>
32A, the header SAP1 is indicated by bold characters between square<br>
brackets, the header (ENT1, ENT-A) of the authentication field (AUTH1,<br>
AUTH-A) being underlined, and the payload being indicated by normal<br>
characters (the notation is hexadecimal).<br>
The message M1, associated with L-AUTH=0x01, PERM=0x27<br>
and with three reserved bytes equal to 0x00, is as follows:<br><br><br><br>
The message MSG-A obtained after processing of the message<br>
MO by the broadcasting server 32A, associated with L-AUTH=0x21,<br>
PERM=0x27 and KeylD=0x07, is as follows:<br><br>
In a particular deployment of senders 1A (Figure 6), a central drive<br>
system 40 of a service operator, comprising a central server 45, is connected<br>
to broadcasters 41, 42 and 43 via leased lines 46.<br>
Each of the broadcasters 41-43 comprises a broadcasting server<br>
32, of the type of that 32A detailed hereinabove, as well as a device 47 for<br>
broadcasting audiovisual programmes and a VBI encoder referenced 48,<br>
responsible for encoding information originating from the server 32 and from<br>
the device 47 and for broadcasting it to the antenna 49. During operation, the<br><br>
central drive system 40 obtains from various sources (broadcasters,<br>
advertisers, content providers, etc.) information regarding services to be<br>
broadcast, programs their broadcasting and finally makes them available to<br>
the broadcasting server 32 slightly before their broadcasting. It guarantees in<br>
particular the authenticity of public keys through the delivery of digital<br>
certificates 51, 52 and 53 to the broadcasters 41 to 43 respectively. This<br>
central drive system 40 also fulfils the functions of the drive system 31<br>
described above, so that the service announcement messages MSG<br>
broadcast by the broadcasters 41 to 43 can be selectively advised of the<br>
permissions and be signed by means of variable keys, without giving rise to<br>
adverse delays of authentication on reception.<br>
Each of the receivers 2 comprises in particular (Figure 7):<br>
-	a VBI drive referenced 61, designed to extract a payload from<br>
information received from the senders 1A (such as the broadcasters 41 to 43)<br>
and comprising a field WST (World Standard Teletext), to calculate error<br>
control codes FEC (Forward Error Correction) and to control a decoding of<br>
SLIP frames of the payload;<br>
-	a module 62 for decapsulating layers for transport on the<br>
network 5, capable of receiving from the drive 61 the decoded SLIP frames<br>
and of extracting therefrom, after decoding, the content of the IP/UDP frames,<br>
in the form of a header in the SAP format and of a payload in the SDP format<br>
for the service announcement messages MSG;<br>
-	a browser 63, provided with an identification device 4 and with a<br>
permission reading unit 24 (referenced 4N and 24N respectively), of the type<br>
of those described above,<br>
-	a loader 67, provided with an identification device 4 and with an<br>
optional permission reading unit 24 (referenced 4C and 24C respectively), of<br>
the type of those described above,<br>
-	and an authentication library of the type of that referenced 25<br>
described above; the indexed table 26 of keys is stored in a permanent<br><br>
memory of the receiver 2, for example of the flash memory type, in a code of<br>
the library 25.<br>
The browser 63 is designed to perform the following functions on<br>
receipt of each service announcement message MSG-A:<br>
-	recover the header and the payload of the message MSG-A via<br>
a listening socket 64;<br>
-	call a signature verification function in the library 25, passing it<br>
as input a pointer to the message MSG-A;<br>
-	and should authentication succeed, open listening sockets 65<br>
and 66 respectively for the content messages and the subsequent triggers, by<br>
applying the permissions indicated by the permission flags PERM of the<br>
message MSG-A so as to specify access to the functionalities of the browser<br>
63 to be applied to the broadcast application.<br>
The library 25 signature verification function executes more<br>
precisely the following operations:<br>
-	calculation of a hash MD5 on the signatureless header SAP-A<br>
and payload as a whole, the indicator L-AUTH giving the length of the<br>
authentication field AUTH-A being set to 1; in a variant corresponding to that<br>
indicated for the signature calculation, the authentication field AUTH-A is<br>
ignored in respect of authentication, the indicator L-AUTH being set to 0;<br>
-	recovery of the key identifier KeylD[SGN] in the authentication<br>
field AUTH-A of the header SAP-A and selection of the appropriate<br>
authentication key K'1;<br>
-	verification of the signature SGN of the authentication field<br>
AUTH-A, of the RSA type, by recalculation on the hash of the signature by<br>
means of the selected key K'1; should the signature be invalid, return of the<br>
value 0;<br>
-	if the signature SGN is valid, return of the permission flags<br>
PERM.<br><br>
Thus, the payload of the message MSG-A is ignored except in the<br>
case where authentication succeeds. In the converse case, no listening<br>
socket is opened for the subsequent messages of the service announced and<br>
the customer remains deaf to the data which arrive.<br>
The operation of the loader 67 is similar in respect of a system<br>
announcement message, received via a listening socket 68: a socket 69 is<br>
opened only for subsequent content messages if the message is<br>
authenticated, by means of a call to the library 25.<br>
A second embodiment of the sender 1, referenced 1B (Figure 8), is<br>
applied to a combination of encryption and authentication. This embodiment<br>
differs from the previous essentially by the presence in the sender 1B of<br>
encryption elements, complementary to the signature elements and designed<br>
to act upstream of them. The encryption elements and the signature elements<br>
rely respectively on the selection of two current enciphering keys from two<br>
indexed tables 16 of keys (Figure 1), and call respectively on an encryption<br>
library 15B and a signature library 15A', of the type of the enciphering library<br>
15 described in a general manner above. The receiver 2 includes an indexed<br>
decryption table corresponding to the indexed table of encryption keys, these<br>
decryption keys being preferably private. The indexed encryption and<br>
decryption tables comprise for example 10 keys each.<br>
Thus, the drive system 31, referenced 31B, comprises units 12 for<br>
changing current key and also devices 13 for securing messages for<br>
encryption (respectively 12B and 13B) and for signature after encryption<br>
(respectively 12A' and 13A').<br>
Moreover, the broadcasting server 32, referenced 32B, comprises<br>
a completion and encryption module 34 including an encryption control unit<br>
11B and a signature module 38 downstream of the module 34, including a<br>
signature control unit 11 A', the control units 11B and 11A' being of the type of<br><br>
the enciphering control unit 11. This server 32B integrates an authentication<br>
field AUTH, referenced AUTH-B, into the header in the SAP format, in a<br>
similar manner to the first embodiment.<br>
The completion and encryption module 34 is responsible for<br>
adding complementary information required in the message M1 as in the<br>
previous embodiment, and for calling on the encryption library 15B so as to<br>
encrypt the message M4 thus obtained, transmitting an encryption key<br>
identifier KeylD[CRYPT] thereto. The enciphering module 17 of the library<br>
15B (Figure 1) then carries out the encryption of the payload, but not of the<br>
initial data of the header or of the authentication field AUTH-B. The key<br>
identifier KeylD[CRYPT] is for example generated randomly.<br>
The signature module 38 is designed to receive from the<br>
encryption library 15B a message M5 resulting from this encryption and<br>
comprising in particular an authentication key identifier KeylD[SGN], and to<br>
call on the signature library 15A' so as to obtain a signed message M6. The<br>
enciphering module 17 of the library 15A' (Figure 1) determines and affixes a<br>
signature pertaining to the message M5 as a whole, by means of the current<br>
key given by the key identifier KeylD[SGN], as in the previous embodiment.<br>
The encapsulation module 36 plays the same role as previously<br>
and makes it possible to obtain the message MSG to be broadcast, denoted<br>
MSG-B.<br>
By way of illustration (Figure 9), the message MSG-B comprises,<br>
in addition to its payload, a header in the SAP format referenced SAP-B<br>
which is structured as follows:<br>
-	fields V, ARTEC, L-AUTH, MSG ID HASH and AUTH-B similar<br>
to those of the first embodiment;<br>
-	encryption key identifier KeylD[CRYPT] (1 double-word);<br><br>
-	indicator of time exceeded TIMEOUT (1 double-word), useful<br>
when the payload is encrypted and when the sending of the announcement<br>
message involves a proxy;<br>
-	padding indicator P (1 bit), signalling padding before encryption;<br>
the last byte of the decrypted payload then gives the number of padding bytes<br>
added;<br>
-	and a random field (31 bits) containing a true random number<br>
and intended to be discarded after decryption.<br>
The set CRYPT of encrypted fields consists of the indicator P, of<br>
the random field and of the payload, while the identifier KeylD[CRYPT] and<br>
ihe field TIMEOUT form an unencrypted encryption header ENT-CRYPT.<br>
In a variant embodiment applicable to any one of the pairs of<br>
associated enciphering and identification libraries (Figures 10 and 11), the<br>
enciphering library 75 comprises an indexed table 76 of blocks B1, B2 ... Bn of<br>
enciphering keys, instead of a table of keys. Each of the blocks B1 itself<br>
includes several keys Ki,1, Ki,2 ... Ki,ii, whose number may vary according to<br>
the block considered. Similarly, the identification library 85 comprises an<br>
indexed table 86 of blocks B'1, B'2 ... B'n of identification keys, each of the<br>
blocks B'i including several keys K'i,1, K'i,2... K'i,ii corresponding respectively to<br>
the keys K'i,1, K'i,2... K'i,ii of the blocks Bi of the enciphering library 75.<br>
Knowledge of the key identifier KeylD does not therefore make it<br>
possible to ascertain in a one-to-one manner the key Kij chosen for the<br>
enciphering by the enciphering module 77, and hence the associated<br>
identification key K'ij which is to be used by the identification module 87 of the<br>
library 85, but only the blocks Bi, and B'i to which these keys respectively<br>
belong. All the keys of the identified block B'i must therefore be tried in<br>
succession until the decryption succeeds.<br>
According to a variant deployment of the identifiers, the<br>
authentication key identifier KeylD[SGN] and/or permission identifier PERM<br><br>
are exterior to the authentication field AUTH in the header of the message<br>
MSG. Thus, the messages for authentication can be enciphered while<br>
including these identifiers in the signature calculation SGN, but excluding the<br>
authentication field AUTH (L-AUTH=0) therefrom.<br>
In another embodiment (Figures 12 and 13), the permission flags<br>
PERM are disposed in the payload field. According to the example illustrated,<br>
the service announcement message MSG produced, referenced MSG-C,<br>
contains a header in the SAP format, denoted SAP-C, without permissions<br>
but with a reserved field of two bytes in the header ENT-C of the<br>
authentication field AUTH-C. Its payload in the SDP format, denoted SDP-C,<br>
includes the permission flags PERM on two bytes, for example at the start of<br>
the field. The permissions field needs more payload space than header<br>
space, since it now requires writing in text rather than binary format, and a<br>
permissions field identification label.<br><br>
