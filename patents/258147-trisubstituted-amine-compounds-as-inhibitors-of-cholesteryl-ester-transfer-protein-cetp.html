DESCRIPTION<br>
TRISUBSTITUTED AMINE COMPOUND<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a compound having an inhibitory activity against cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) and showing an activity of increasing HDL cholesterol level and an activity of decreasing LDL cholesterol level, thereby being useful for prophylaxis and/or treatment of arteriosclerotic diseases, hyperlipemia or dysllpidemia.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Hypercholesterolemia, especially high serum level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, has been revealed to be a risk factor of arteriosclerotic diseases by a number of epidemiological surveys. Actually, drugs capable of decreasing LDL cholesterol level such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors have been used with the aim of preventing coronary artery diseases, and demonstrated to have some benefits in many large scale clinical tests. However, their preventive effect on coronary diseases is limited to some extent, and is not satisfactory enough yet.<br>
Recently, low serum level of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol has been revealed to be a potent risk factor of arteriosclerotic diseases by a number of epidemiological surveys and large scale clinical tests. HDL is known to have various antiarteriosclerotic effects and attention is focused on the potentiality of drugs increasing HDL cholesterol level as a means for prevention or treatment of arteriosclerotic diseases. However, there are no drugs that can be used in a satisfactory manner for this purpose. Fibrates and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have only low activity of increasing HDL cholesterol level; nicotinic acid derivatives can<br><br>
significantly increase HDL cholesterol level, but have serious toleration issues. Accordingly, there has been a demand for a well-tolerated agent which can significantly elevate HDL cholesterol level, thereby preventing or reversing the progression of atherosclerosis.<br>
It is known that many proteins are involved in the regulation mechanism for catabolism of various lipoproteins. Among them, the role of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) became to draw attention. CETP is a protein responsible for transfer of cholesteryl ester (CE) and triglyceride between lipoproteins, and mediate the transfer of CE from HDL to LDL or to very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). Accordingly, CETP activity affects greatly the lipid composition in lipoprotein particles. For example, it is known that administration of an active neutralizing monoclonal antibody against CETP to rabbit or hamster elevates HDL cholesterol level and lower LDL cholesterol level. Furthermore, human being having decreased or eliminated CETP activity due to gene mutation shows raised blood HDL cholesterol level and lowered blood LDL cholesterol level. On the other hand, it is known that transgenic mice and rats made to express CETP show lowered HDL cholesterol level and raised LDL cholesterol level. Thus, it is considered that CETP greatly contribute to the regulation of serum lipids, and thereby affecting the change of serum lipid profile such as decrease of HDL cholesterol level and increase of LDL cholesterol level. Accordingly, it is assumed that a high value of CETP activity would induce arteriosclerosis.<br>
In fact, CETP activity varies depending on animal species. It is known that, arteriosclerotic lesions are readily formed by cholesterol loading in animals with high CETP activity such as rabbits, whereas such lesions hardly occur in animals with low CETP activity such as rats. Furthermore, it is confirmed that continuous suppressioii of CETP activity by administration of antisense oligodeoxynuclotide resulted in effects such as increase of blood HDL cholesterol level and reduction in arteriosclerotic<br><br>
lesions in cholesterol-fed rabbits.<br>
The above findings indicate that CETP activity is in negative correlation with HDL cholesterol, and that inhibition of CETP activity would decrease the degree of risk for arteriosclerotic diseases. It is therefore expected that compounds capable of inhibiting CETP activity can block the transfer of cholesterol from HDL to LDL or VLDL, and thereby increasing HDL cholesterol that tends to prevent arteriosclerosis while lowering LDL cholesterol that tends to promote arteriosclerosis. In this way, such compounds can serve as a useful preventive or therapeutic agent for arteriosclerotic diseases, hyperlipemia or dyslipidemia and provide effective medical treatment for the first time.<br>
Examples of compounds having CETP inhibitory activity include tetrahydroquinoline derivatives. See, PCT International Publication WOOO/17164 pamphlet, PCT International Publication WOOO/17165 pamphlet and PCT International Publication WOOO/17166 pamphlet.<br>
However, these compounds have defects. That is, they are poorly soluble in water and cannot be absorbed enough in vivo, a sufficient blood level for taking medicinal effect can hardly be achieved even when administered as an ordinary formulation for oral administration. See, WO03/63868.<br>
Accordingly, it has been demanded to find a novel compound which eliminates the above-mentioned defects and intensive studies have been done on dibenzylamine type compounds, and the like. See, PCT International Publication WO05/100298 pamphlet, PCT International Publication WO04/020393 pamphlet, PCT International Publication WO 06/056854 pamphlet and JP 2003-221376 A.<br>

25.	A compound of a general formula (1-1):<br><br><br>
wherein the sjnnbols have the same meanings as defined above, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof.<br>
When the compound (1) has one or more asymmetric carbon atoms, the compound (1) of the present invention encompasses racemate, racemic mixture, individual enantiomers or diastereomers. The present compounds also include all such isomers and a mixture thereof.<br>
Also, when the present compound has an alkenyl or all^Tiyl group, CIS (Z)- and trans (Ej- forms may occur. In addition, the present compounds include individual stereoisomer of the compound and optionally, individual tautomeric forms thereof and a mixture thereof.<br>
Separation of diastereomer or cis- and trans- isomers can be achieved by the conventional method such as fractional crystallization, chromatography and HPLC method, and the like. Also the drug containing the individual stereoisomer as needed can be prepared from a corresponding optically active intermediate or alternatively by resolving the corresponding racemate by using the suitable chiral support (e.g. HPLC) or by performing a fractional crystallization of diastereomeric salt formed by reacting a corresponding racemate and a suitable optically active acid or base. Alternatively, the resolution of the mixture of enantiomers can be done by forming on a novel covalently bounded species formed by means of reacting it with a suitable chiral compound. For example, at first, the coupling reaction between a racemic carbojQ^lic acid and a chiral amine or a chiral alcolol gives a mixture of diastereoisomers (amide or ester, respectively) and then it is isolated by the conventional technique such as chromatography, HPLC or fractional crystallization, and the like. Thereafter, the resulting one diastereoisomer can be converted into one enantiomer of the desired compound by cleaving the new covaJent binding with a suitable chemical reaction such as hydrolysis, and the like.<br>
As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable derivative" represents a pharmaceutical acceptable salt, solvate or prodrug (e.g. ester)<br><br>
of the present compound, and which can provide (directly or indirectly} the compound of the present invention or an active metabohte or a residue thereof. Such derivatives can be obtained by a person skilled in the art without undue experimentation. See, for example, Burger's Medicinal Chemistry and Drug Discovery 5th ed., vol. 1st, "Principles and Practice". Preferred pharmaceutically acceptable derivative is a salt, a solvate, an ester, a carbamlnic ester and a phosphoric ester. Especially preferred pharmaceutically acceptable derivative is a salt, a solvate and an ester. Most preferred pharmaceutically acceptable derivative is a salt and an ester.<br>
A person skilled in the art of organic chemisty knows that m^any organic compounds can be formed a complex with a solvent of reaction system and which can be precipitated out or crystallized out from the solvent. These complexes are widely known as a "solvate". For example, the complex with water is known as a "hydrate". The solvate of the compound of the present invention falls within the scope of the invention.<br>
As used herein, the "prodrug" represent a compound which convert to the active form having a pharmacological activity by a hydrolysis in vivo (such as in a blood). The example of the pharamaceutically acceptable prodrug is described in the literature: T. Higuchi and V. Stera, Prodrugs as Novel Delivery Systems, "Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design", Edward B. Roche ed., American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, A.C.S. Symposium Series, vol. 14th, (1987); and D. Freisher, S. Roman and H. Barbara, Improved oral drug delivery: solubility limitations overcome by the use of prodrugs, Adveinced Drug Delivery Reviews (1996) 19(2): 115-130).<br>
A prodrug is a carrier that releases the compound of the formula (1) which is bound covalently in vivo when administered to a patient. In general, the prodrug is prepared by the conventional m^ethod or by modifying a functional group such that the moidified moiety is cleaved in<br><br>
vivo to give a parent compound. Examples of the prodrug include the CQjnpound wherein a hydroJQ^, amine or sulfhydiyl group binds to an optional group such that provide a hydroxy, amine or sulfhydiyl group by cleaving it when administered to a patient. Thus the representative exam.ples of prodrug are the following ones, but not limited thereto; i. e. the derivatives with acetic ester, formic ester and benzoic ester at the functional groups such as alcohol, sulfhydiyl or amine of the compound of the formula (1). In addition, when the functional group is a carboxylic acid, esters such as methyl ester, ethyl ester and double ester, and the like can be used. The esters exhibit inherently the activity in a human body and/or are hydrolyzed under in vivo condition to the active sompound. The suitable pharmaceutically acceptable esters capable of hydrolyzing in vivo include those which are decomposed easily in the human body to release the parent acid compound or a salt thereof.<br>
The compound of the present invention may be a pharmacetically acceptable salt form thereof. The suitable salt is outlined in literature (Berge et. al., J. Pharm. Sci., 66: 1-19 (1977)).<br>
In general, the pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be easily prepared with a desirable acid or base as needed. The resulting salts can be recovered by filtering aifter precipitating it out from the solution or distilling the solvent off.<br>
The suitable additive salts may be formed with an acid forming a nontoxic salt. Examples of the salt include hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, sulfate, bisulfate, nitrate, phosphate, hydrogen phosphate, acetate, maleate, malate, fumarate, lactate, tartrate, citrate, formate, gluconate, succinate, pyruvate, oxalate, oxaloacetate, trifluoroacetate, saccarate, benzoate, methanesulfonate, ethane sulfonate, benzenesulfonate and p-toluenesulfonate.<br>
Examples of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt with a base include alkaline metal salts including ammonium salt, sodium salt and<br><br>
potassium salt; alkaline earth metal salts including calcium salt and magnesium salt as well as salts with organic bases including a primary, secondary and tertiary amine (e.g. isopropylamine, diethylamine, ethanolamine, trimethlamine, dicyclohej^lamine and N-methyl-D-glucamine).<br>
The term "halogen" refers to fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine.<br>
The term "alkyl group" or "alkyl" means a straight or branched saturated hydrocarbon chain having 1 to 10 carbon atoms and a cyclic saturated hydrocarbon chain having 3 to 10 carbon atoms. As a straight or branched hydrocarbon chain, those having 2 to 10 carbon atoms are preferred and those having 2 to 6 carbons are more preferred. More preferred exeimples are stradght chain alkyl groups having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, especially those having 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Examples of alkyl group include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, sec-bulyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, tert-penlyl, 1-methylbutyl, 2-methylbutyl, 3-methylbutyl, hexyl and isohexyl groups, and the like.<br>
The term "aUcoxy group" or "alkoxy" means a straight or branched alkyloxy group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms and a cyclic alkyloxy group having 3 to 10 carbon atoms. As a straight or branched hydrocarbon chain, those having 2 to 10 carbon atoms are preferred and those having 2 to 6 carbons are more preferred. More preferred examples are straight chain alkoxy groups having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, especially those having 1 to 4 carbon atoms.
