				<td>LCST POLYMER HAVING TERMINAL (METH) ACRYLIC ACID GROUPS AND<br>
PROCESS FOR PREPARING THE SAME<br>
Description<br>
15The invention relates to LCST (lower critical solution<br>
temperature) polymers. This term is used to refer to<br>
polymers which are soluble in a liquid medium at a low<br>
temperature but above a certain temperature (the LCST<br>
temperature) precipitate from the liquid medium. LCST<br>
20polymers have different chemical compositions. The<br>
best-known LCST polymers are polyalkylene oxide<br>
polymers, examples being polyethylene oxide (PEO) or<br>
polypropylene oxide (PPO) polymers, but also (PEO)-<br>
(PPO) copolymers, particularly PEO-PPO-PEO block<br>
25copolymers. Other LCST polymers are poly(N-isopropyl-<br>
acrylamide)-ethyl-(hydroxyethyl)-cellulose derivatives,<br>
poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) derivatives and poly(methyl<br>
vinyl ether) derivatives.<br>
30The first-mentioned polymers are described for example<br>
in WO 01/60926 Al. That publication relates to a<br>
process for coating substrate surfaces (particle<br>
surfaces and nonparticulate substrate surfaces) with<br>
LCST polymers, for which an LCST polymer is dissolved<br>
35in a solvent at a temperature below the LCST<br>
temperature, this solution is mixed with the substrate<br>
surfaces to be coated, and the resultant mixture is<br>
heated to above the LCST temperature until the<br>
deposition of LCST polymers on the substrate surfaces<br>
begins. The deposited LCST polymer can be immobilized<br>
by providing it with functional groups which allow<br>
substantially irreversible adsorption on the substrate<br>
surface. The functional groups may be selected from<br>
acid groups, hydroxyl groups, amino groups, phosphate<br>
groups, mercaptan groups, siloxane groups or<br>
hydrophobic groups. Further, the LCST polymers may be<br>
provided with functional groups which, following<br>
deposition of the LCST polymers on the particles, allow<br>
the crosslinking of the LCST polymers in a crosslinking<br>
reaction. Functional groups of this kind may be<br>
selected from carboxylic acid group derivatives,<br>
chloroformate groups, amino groups, isocyanate groups,<br>
oxirane groups and/or free-radically crosslinkable<br>
groups, with the crosslinking reaction being initiated,<br>
inter alia, by a change in the pH of the solution.<br>
Free-radical crosslinking is less preferred than cross-<br>
linking through a change in pH. The examples specify<br>
merely the enveloping of various pigment particles<br>
(TiO2, Fe2O3, Cu phthalocyanine blue, and semiconductor<br>
wafers with a silicon dioxide surface) with PEO-PPO-PEO<br>
block copolymers. Fixing of the copolymersdeposited on<br>
the substrate surfaces is not elucidated.<br>
The use of LCST polymers for enveloping superpara-<br>
magnetic particles is known, further, from WO 97/45202.<br>
These particles comprise a core of a first polymer, an<br>
inner layer of a second polymer, which coats the core<br>
and in which a magnetic material is dispersed, and an<br>
outer layer of a third polymer, which coats the<br>
magnetic layer and is capable of reacting at least one<br>
biological molecule, the second polymer at least being<br>
heat-sensitive and having an LCST temperature of 15 to<br>
65°C. The second polymer is obtained preferably by<br>
polymerizing (1) a water-soluble acrylamide monomer,<br>
such as N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM), (2) at least one<br>
crosslinking agent, such as N,N-methylenebisacrylamide<br>
and (3) at least one functional cationic and water-<br>
soluble monomer different than the monomer (1), e.g.,<br>
the chloride of 2-aminoethyl methacrylate. A further<br>
preferred polymer is [poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)]<br>
(PNIPAM).<br>
Patent Abstracts of Japan, Vol. 009 No. 188 (C295)<br>
(1985) page 107 = JP 60 058 237 A describes the<br>
encapsulation of inorganic particles. The aim is to<br>
prepare a stable particle dispersion. The inorganic<br>
particles are suspended in water and contacted below<br>
the LCST temperature with an aqueous solution of the<br>
LCST polymer. When the temperature of the resulting<br>
system is raised, a layer of the LCST polymer is<br>
deposited on the inorganic particles. The resultant<br>
particle suspension is admixed with a free-radically<br>
polymerizable monomer, an initiator and, if desired, an<br>
emulsifier, and an emulsion polymerization is carried<br>
out, giving encapsulated particles. Now, additionally,<br>
there is an outer layer, consisting of the polymerized<br>
monomer layer; accordingly, the function of the LCST<br>
polymer layer is only to facilitate, the penetration of<br>
monomer residues.<br>
The polymerizable monomer, then, is reacted with the<br>
LCST polymer that is already on the particles, or the<br>
water-soluble polymer is enveloped with a layer of the<br>
polymer obtained from the polymerizable monomer. This<br>
process has the disadvantage that the graft attachment<br>
takes place only on the active centers of the pre-<br>
deposited LCST polymer, and so the envelopment is<br>
nonuniform and heterogeneous and does not constitute a<br>
complete barrier.<br>
Moreover, it is necessary to add a monomer to the<br>
dispersion of the coated particles in order to initiate<br>
crosslinking. In the majority of cases the monomer is<br>
never fully consumed, and so a certain fraction of the<br>
monomer remains in the crosslinked structure.<br>
Subsequent emission of the "dissolved" monomers from<br>
the polymer is undesirable, since the monomer is<br>
injurious to health.<br>
Furthermore, disadvantages in the coating system are<br>
anticipated as a result of the detachment of the<br>
copolymerized emulsifier if the pigment comes into<br>
contact with solvents.<br>
WO 92/20441 describes a process for generating<br>
encapsulated particles, the particles comprising a core<br>
surrounded by a coacervate coating. In this process an<br>
aqueous solution of an LCST polymer is contacted, at a<br>
temperature of reversible insolubilization (TRI), of<br>
Tl, with a dispersion of the particles at a temperature<br>
of T2, which is lower than Tl, and then the dispersion<br>
is heated to a temperature above Tl, thereby depositing<br>
the LCST polymer as a coacervate around the particles.<br>
Subsequently an agent for lowering the TRI is added to<br>
the solution, thereby lowering the TRI of the LCST<br>
polymer in the solution to a temperature T3, which is<br>
lower than Tl, and then either the dispersion is cooled<br>
to a temperature between T3 and Tl and is held at this<br>
temperature, or the particles are separated from the<br>
dispersion at a temperature of more than T3. As agents<br>
for lowering the TRI it is possible to use electrolytes<br>
and water-miscible organic liquids in which the LCST<br>
polymer is not soluble.<br>
LCST polymers used are preferably synthetic polymers<br>
(homopolymers or copolymers) with hydrophilic monomers.<br>
Suitable LCST monomers are acrylic or vinyl compounds.<br>
Where LCST copolymers are used, the comonomer is<br>
commonly hydrophilic and may be nonionic or ionic.<br>
Suitable nonionic monomers are certain aryl or vinyl<br>
compounds. Examples of anionic or cationic monomers are<br>
acrylic acid derivatives or dialkylaminoalkyl<br>
acrylates. These compounds, however, are already<br>
saturated at the ends, and so crosslinking reactions<br>
are no longer possible.<br>
LCST polymers are also known, for example, from<br>
EP 0 629 649 Al. They are used as rheofluidizing<br>
additives and antisettling agents in diaphragm wall<br>
construction, for wells in the oil industry, and as<br>
hydraulic fluids and lubricants.<br>
EP 0 718 327 A2 discloses universally compatible<br>
pigment dispersants composed of methyl methacrylate and<br>
an acrylate or methacrylate. These polymers, however,<br>
serve only for dispersing pigments, but not for<br>
enveloping pigments.<br>
The object on which the invention was based was to<br>
provide LCST polymers which on cooling no longer detach<br>
from a substrate surface but instead remain firmly<br>
joined to it. The polymers are therefore intended to be<br>
used without added emulsifiers or monomers, so that no<br>
additives can leach from the defined polymer layer.<br>
This object is achieved in accordance with the<br>
invention by means of LCST polymers of the general<br>
formula:<br><br>
in which Rx (identical or different at each occurrence)<br>
is hydrogen or a methyl group, X1 and X2 (identical to<br>
or different from one another) = -O-, -S- or -NH- and Xx<br>
additionally is a single bond if the first atom in R2 is<br>
not a carbon atom, and R2 is one of the radicals<br>
indicated below:<br>
a) a copolymer radical (Cop) containing at least two<br>
structural units -(-O-C2H4)n- (ethylene oxide = EO)<br>
and - (-O-C3H6-)n- (propylene oxide = PO) or -(-O-<br>
C4H8)n- (butylene oxide = BuO) and -(-O-CH2-)n-<br>
(methylene oxide = MeO) in a molar ratio of 5 to<br>
95:95 to 5, in which n (identical or different for<br>
each structural unit) is approximately 1 to 1000;<br><br>
in which Cop is a copolymer radical as defined in (a) ,<br>
x = 1 to 5 and y = 1 to 20;<br><br>
in which R is an alkyl group, r = (identical or<br>
different at each occurrence) 1 to 1000 and s = 1 to<br>
500;<br>
d)<br><br>
in which o = 10 to 4000 and R3 (identical or different<br>
at each occurrence) is hydrogen or alkyl groups having<br>
1 to 5 carbon atoms;<br><br>
in which q = 10 to 4000.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that the polymers of the<br>
invention are irreversibly immobilized on the substrate<br>
surface after polymerization on the acrylic or<br>
methacrylic side chain. The immobilization is far<br>
greater than that of LCST polymers in which the end<br>
groups are composed, for example, of simple vinyl<br>
groups or other groups with double bonds.<br>
Other polymerized units, such as vinylacetic acid,<br>
oleic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid and polyethylene<br>
glycol monovinyl ether, are less suitable as end<br>
groups.<br>
The polymers of the invention commonly have an LCST in<br>
the range from 0 to 70°C, which is dependent on factors<br>
including the following:<br>
molar ratio of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic<br>
fractions of the LCST polymer,<br>
- molar mass of the LCST polymer,<br>
number of polymerizable and ionisable groups,<br>
concentration of the polymer,<br>
pH and ionic strength of the medium.<br>
The LCST polymers are composed of polar and nonpolar or<br>
hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments. The LCST can be<br>
tailored by varying these individual segments and also<br>
the overall chain length.<br>
Following the polymerization with the acrylic or<br>
methacrylic end groups, the LCST polymers of the<br>
invention can be used as dispersants fixed on the<br>
substrate surfaces. Among other things, this makes the<br>
expensive step of pigment dispersion cheaper, since the<br>
pigment carries its dispersant with it. Further, the<br>
pigments thus coated form agglomerates to a lesser<br>
extent than do untreated pigments, so that dispersion<br>
is easier to carry out, resulting in an additional<br>
reduction in costs.<br>
Dispersants are surface-active substances which<br>
facilitate the dispersion of a pulverulent substance,<br>
e.g., a pigment or filler, in a liquid dispersion<br>
medium, by lowering the surface tension between two<br>
components. In the course of pigment grinding they<br>
thereby facilitate the mechanical disruption of the<br>
secondary particles which are present in the form of<br>
agglomerates, into primary particles. Moreover, they<br>
protect the primary particles formed from<br>
reagglomeration or flocculation by virtue of complete<br>
wetting and the formation of a protective colloid shell<br>
or an electrochemical double layer.<br>
Since the LCST polymers of the invention are<br>
transparent or transluscent in visible light, they are<br>
able to form a complete envelope around particles,<br>
without the color of the particles themselves being<br>
affected. Further, in paints, the pigments thus coated<br>
display the full color strength, since by virtue of the<br>
LCST polymer coating they do not form agglomerates.<br>
Preferred LCST polymers fall into groups (a) and (c) .<br>
Preferably the radical -(C3H6)- radical in (a) and (c)<br>
is an isopropyl radical and the radical (C4H8)- in (a)<br>
is an isobutyl radical.<br>
The preferred LCST polymers in group (a) are block<br>
copolymers, the structural units -(EO)- and -(PO)- on<br>
the one hand and the structural units -(BuO)- and<br>
- (MeO) - on the other hand being present in blocks with<br>
n = 3 to 100.<br>
Block copolymers are composed of blocks of<br>
homosequences linked to one another via the ends. Graft<br>
polymers are composed of what is called a homopolymeric<br>
backbone, from which polymer chains of other<br>
homopolymers branch out.<br>
The blocks with the structural units -(-PO)- and<br>
-(-BuO-)- are preferably disposed between the blocks<br>
with the structural units -(-EO)- and -(-MeO-),<br>
respectively.<br>
These block copolymers are referred to for the sake of<br>
simplicity as PEO-PPO-PEO block copolymers. A triblock<br>
copolymer having the block sequence PEO-PPO-PEO<br>
customarily has a PEO weight fraction of about 5% to<br>
85% by weight and number-average molar masses (MN) of<br>
200 to 50,000 g/mol.<br>
Alternatively, the different structural units can be<br>
randomly distributed.<br>
The molar ratio between the -(EO)- structural units and<br>
-(PO)- structural units is preferably about 10 to 60 :<br>
40 to 90.<br>
The LCST polymers of the invention of versions (a) to<br>
(f) can be prepared by reacting a compound of the<br>
general formula HO-[R2]-OH, in which R2 is as defined<br>
above, with a compound of the formula<br><br>
in which R1 is as defined above and X is OH, halogen,<br>
preferably chlorine, or a lower alkoxy group, in a<br>
molar ratio of 1:2, or (b) with the anhydride of the<br>
corresponding acid in a molar ratio of 1:1.<br>
The starting polymers for the LCST polymers of product<br>
versions (a) to (c) are in some cases available commer-<br>
cially. Additionally, however, they can be prepared as<br>
follows:<br>
For version (a):<br>
The copolymers can be prepared by starting from a<br>
compound which is already present in macromolecular<br>
form and continuing the polymerization using a polymer<br>
of a different kind. The polymerization may take place<br>
either in solution in water or in an organic solvent,<br>
in emulsion or suspension or by direct reaction of the<br>
components in bulk or in powder form in the melt, with<br>
or without a catalyst, preferably in a one-stage<br>
process.<br>
For version (b) :<br>
These copolymers are star-shaped and contain as their<br>
central linking unit a glycoluril group. They can be<br>
prepared as follows:<br>
A glycouril unit (Powderlink 1774) is reacted with PEO<br>
methyl ether and PPO butyl ether so as to link one or<br>
more PEO units to one or more PPO units.<br>
Compounds of this kind and their use for coating<br>
substrate surfaces, such as pigments, are described for<br>
example in the following publications: DE 100 38 147<br>
Al, DE 100 64 240.3 and DE 101 63 985.6.<br>
For version (c):<br>
The copolymers are prepared with the aid of tosylates.<br>
As a result it is possible to link the OH-terminated<br>
polyethers (PEO/PPO) with amines. The polyethers are<br>
reacted in this case with tosyl chloride (p-toluene-<br>
sulfonyl chloride), giving polyether tosylates. Since<br>
the tosyl group is a very good leaving group, the<br>
polyether tosylates can be reacted with primary amines.<br>
Thus it is possible, by way of an aliphatic or aromatic<br>
diamine, to link, for example, a PEO unit with a PPO<br>
unit. Another possibility is the reaction of PPO<br>
diamine with PEO tosylate. In this way a three-block<br>
copolymer is obtained. In order to prevent advancement<br>
reactions, which would result in undefined products,<br>
the polyethers ought to contain only one free OH group.<br>
For versions (d) to (f) the corresponding monomers are<br>
used.<br>
The LCST polymers of the invention can be used for<br>
coating particles and nonparticulate substrate<br>
surfaces. The particles that are suitable in accordance<br>
with the invention include pigments, fillers, and nano-<br>
particles. Pigments are pulverulent or platelet-shaped<br>
colorants which in contrast to dyes are insoluble in<br>
the surrounding medium (DIN 55943: 1993-11, DIN:EN 971-<br>
1: 1996-09). Pigments influence or determine the<br>
coloring and for reasons of cost are used in as small<br>
amounts as possible. Owing to forces of interaction it<br>
is possible for the pigment particles to agglomerate,<br>
particularly during incorporation into the matrix<br>
material. This results for example, in quality<br>
detractions in the resulting paint, as a consequence,<br>
inter alia, of deficient color strength, sedimentation<br>
or phase separation.<br>
Preferred pigments are titanium dioxide, iron oxide,<br>
zinc oxide:, carbon black, Cu phthalocyanine pigments,<br>
platelet-shaped pigments, such as mica (with or without<br>
oxidic and metallic coatings) or aluminum. Fillers<br>
which can be used include, for example, barium sulfate<br>
and talc. Nanoparticles which can be used include iron<br>
oxide, titanium dioxide and silicon dioxide particles.<br>
The particles also include microfibers, such as glass,<br>
carbon, textile and polymer fibers.<br>
The substrate surfaces may also be nonparticulate<br>
surfaces, such as those of glass, metal and<br>
semiconductors, for example. Particularly preferred<br>
surfaces are silicon dioxide wafers which are used in<br>
the semiconductors industry.<br>
The LCST polymers of the invention are preferably<br>
contacted in a liquid medium (e.g., in an aqueous or<br>
organic medium) at below the LCST temperature with the<br>
particles or the nonparticulate substrate surfaces, and<br>
then the temperature is raised to above the LCST<br>
temperature and the polymers are polymerized by the<br>
double bonds at this temperature or a higher<br>
temperature on the surface of the particles or on the<br>
nonparticulate substrate surfaces.<br>
The synthesis of product version (a) takes place by<br>
reacting commercially available PEO-PPO-PEO block<br>
copolymers which have terminal OH groups with acrylic<br>
or methacrylic acid derivatives, thereby introducing<br>
polymerizable double bonds. The introduction can take<br>
place by means of the following derivatives: chlorides,<br>
esters, anhydrides, amides or free acids, and is<br>
acidically or basically catalyzed. This esterification<br>
or transesterification can be carried out in a solvent<br>
at about 0 to 100°C, but can also be carried out in<br>
bulk (without solvent). In order to inhibit unwanted<br>
polymerization, small amounts of a polymerization<br>
inhibitor are added to the reaction mixture.<br>
The synthesis of product version (b) takes place by<br>
reacting the polyether-modified glycoluril with<br>
acryloyl or methacryloyl chloride, thereby introducing<br>
polymerizable double bonds. This reaction can be<br>
carried out in a solvent at about 0 to 30°C, but can<br>
also be carried out in bulk (without solvent). One<br>
possibility of introducing a double bond is to react<br>
the product mixture, which ought to contain at least<br>
two PEO/PPO segments, with ethylene glycol. After the<br>
reaction of the first OH group with the glycoluril<br>
unit, the second free OH group of the ethylene glycol<br>
is sterically shielded by the polymer chains, and so<br>
there ought not to be any reaction with the second<br>
glycoluril unit. The free OH group that remains can<br>
then be reacted with compounds possessing less steric<br>
bulk, such as with acryloyl chloride, for example.<br>
The synthesis of product version (c) takes place by<br>
reacting the 3-block copolymer, obtained with a<br>
tosylate method, on the NH group with acryloyl or<br>
methacryloyl chloride, giving polymers containing<br>
polymerizable acrylic or methacrylic double bonds.<br>
Via this synthesis route it has been possible to link a<br>
PPO diamine (2000 g/mol) with PEO (750 g/ml) and to<br>
introduce double bonds with acryloyl chloride. In the<br>
reaction of PEO tosylate with PPO diamine the<br>
temperatures are about 150°C. The precise synthesis<br>
instructions are given in Example 5.<br>
The synthesis of product version (d) to (f) takes place<br>
by an anionic polymerization of the corresponding<br>
monomers in solution. In this case a sodium-naphthalene<br>
solution serves as initiator. As a result of the use of<br>
this initiator system, electron transfer to a fraction<br>
of the monomers results in the formation of what are<br>
referred to as free-radical anions. The free-radical<br>
anions formed combine very rapidly to form dianions,<br>
and so chain growth will take place on two sides.<br>
An advantage of this polymerization process is that the<br>
resulting polymer has a very narrow molar mass<br>
distribution. This can be influenced and predicted<br>
through the choice and composition of the reactants.<br>
The polymerization is terminated with electrophilic<br>
substances. The addition of acryloyl chloride or<br>
methacryloyl chloride to the reaction solution not only<br>
results in the ending of the polymerization but at the<br>
same time introduces the acrylic or methacrylic end<br>
group.<br>
The invention further provides particles or<br>
nonparticulate substrate surfaces that are coated with<br>
the polymerized LCST polymer.<br>
The invention is elucidated, without restriction, by<br>
the examples which follow.<br>
Example 1<br>
(Version (a))<br>
Modification of market-standard LCST polymers<br>
for immobilization<br>
In principle it is possible to react LCST polymers<br>
containing OH or NH2 groups with acryloyl chloride. The<br>
resulting modified LCST polymers contain double bonds<br>
via which they can be free-radically polymerized.<br>
The present example illustrates the modification of<br>
HOPEOPPOPEOOH copolymers.<br>
20 g of a PEO-PPO-PEO block copolymer (4400 g/mol, 2 OH<br>
end groups; commercial product Synperonic® L121) are<br>
weighed out into a two-necked round-bottomed flask and<br>
mixed with 3 ml of triethylamine (1.2-fold excess) with<br>
the aid of a stirrer. The mixture is conditioned to<br>
about 10°C (waterbath). Using a dropping funnel, 2 ml<br>
(1.2-fold excess) of acryloyl chloride are slowly added<br>
dropwise, with vigorous stirring and cooling, in the<br>
course of which the temperature ought not to rise above<br>
25 to 30°C. The vapors which form (HC1, a little<br>
acrylamide) are taken off into the waste-air system.<br>
The addition of the acryloyl chloride is followed by<br>
stirring, accompanied by cooling, until the evolution<br>
of heat and vapor is at an end (about 30 minutes) . For<br>
complete reaction of the acryloyl chloride, heating is<br>
then continued at 30 °C for 2 h more, with stirring,<br>
after which the mixture is cooled to room temperature<br>
and rinsed 3 times with water at room temperature and<br>
the product is isolated by centrifugation.<br>
The resulting product, with an LCST temperature of 8°C,<br>
can normally be used in the wet state; in other words,<br>
no further working up is normally necessary. The amount<br>
of polymer is determined as the solids content, and in<br>
the application the LCST polymer is used with a<br>
relative concentration of 5% to 10% by weight, based on<br>
solids content.<br>
The polymer can be dried under an oil-pump vacuum at a<br>
maximum of 35 to 40 °C, in order to prevent<br>
crosslinking. For complete drying it has proven<br>
appropriate to take up the polymer with ethanol and<br>
then to strip off the ethanol. Working up can also be<br>
carried out in the manner described for the reaction of<br>
PEONHPPONHPEO. In that case the polymer is dissolved in<br>
chloroform. The solution is extracted by shaking with,<br>
respectively, a little dilute HC1 solution, dilute NaOH<br>
solution and saturated NaCl solution. The organic phase<br>
is dried over sodium sulfate and the chloroform is<br>
removed on a rotary evaporator (waterbath 
Example 2<br>
(Version (a))<br>
The reaction of the block copolymer of Example 1 can<br>
also take place in accordance with the prior art by<br>
transesterification. This is done by mixing 1 mol of<br>
the polymer with up to 4 mol, preferably 2.4 mol, of<br>
methacrylate, or methyl acrylate. The ester can also be<br>
added in portions or continuously during the reaction.<br>
Further, the mixture is admixed with 0.1% to 5% by<br>
weight of transesterification catalyst (sulfuric acid,<br>
hydrochloric acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, dodecyl-<br>
benzenesulfonic acid, alkali(ne earth) (hydr)oxides or<br>
metal alkoxides). The transesterification is carried<br>
out at liquid-phase temperatures of 80 to 120 °C. In<br>
order to prevent unwanted polymerizations the reaction<br>
is carried out advantageously in the presence of small<br>
amounts of commercially customary polymerization<br>
inhibitors (e.g., hydroquinone monoalkyl ethers, 2,6-<br>
di-t-butylphenol, N-nitrosamines, phenothiazine or<br>
phosphoric esters). These compounds are used in amounts<br>
of 0.01% to 2.0%, based on the mass of the acrylic<br>
ester. The product obtained has an LCST of 8°C.<br>
Example 3<br>
(Version (a))<br>
The procedure of Example 2 is repeated with the<br>
difference that 1 mol of the block copolymer is reacted<br>
with 2.4 mol of acrylic acid. The esterification is<br>
carried out in the presence of a solvent with which the<br>
water can be removed azeotropically, such as n-hexane,<br>
n-heptane and cyclohexane, or aromatics, such as<br>
benzene, toluene and the xylene isomers, and what are<br>
called special-boiling point spirits, which have<br>
boiling limits of between 70 and 140°C. The product<br>
obtained has an LCST of 8°C.<br>
Example 4<br>
(Version (b))<br>
The glycoluril-LCST polymers can be synthesized either<br>
in solution or in bulk. In both cases the products<br>
obtained are the same.<br>
Synthesis in solution:<br>
A reaction vessel is charged with 105 g of PEO/PPO<br>
block copolymer having a molecular weight of about<br>
2000 g/mol; manufacturer: Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH,<br>
Deisenhofen; 3 g of glycoluril Powderlink® 1174,<br>
manufacturer: Cytec Industries B.V., Neus; and 400 ml<br>
of toluene, and this initial charge is heated to 135°C<br>
under nitrogen, and traces of moisture are removed by<br>
azeotropic distillation. After an hour the reaction is<br>
initiated by adding 0.2 g of p-toluenesulfonic acid<br>
under a vacuum of 530 mbar and continuously adding<br>
fresh toluene dropwise. After about five hours 1.45 g<br>
of ethylene glycol are added. The reaction mixture is<br>
left to react under unchanged conditions for a further<br>
five hours.<br>
After the mixture has cooled, 2.8 g of triethylamine<br>
are added and 2.5 g of acryloyl chloride are added<br>
dropwise with cooling to 25-30oC. The reaction solution<br>
is poured into trays and dried to constant mass in a<br>
vacuum drying oven at a maximum of 50°C. The product<br>
obtained has an LCST of 8°C.<br>
Comparative Example<br>
The procedure of Example 4 (glycoluril version) was<br>
repeated with the difference that the last reaction<br>
step, namely the introduction of the polymerizable<br>
double bond into the polymer, was carried out not with<br>
acryloyl chloride but instead with 4-pentenoyl chloride<br>
(manufacturer: Sigma-Aldrich Chemie, Deisenhofen). In<br>
this case 3.26 g were used for the reaction in solution<br>
and 3.26 g of 4-pentenoyl chloride for the reaction in<br>
bulk; the other reactant proportions were not changed.<br>
The product obtained has an LCST of 0 to 2°C.<br>
Example 5<br>
(Version (c))<br>
a) Synthesis of PEO tosylate<br>
25 g (33.3 mmol) of PEO monomethyl ether (750 g/mol)<br>
and 3.54 g (35 mmol) of triethylamine are dissolved in<br>
chloroform and the solution is cooled to about 0 to<br>
5°C. 6.6? g (35 mmol) of tosyl chloride (in solution in<br>
chloroform) are added dropwise, and the solution is<br>
stirred at room temperature for about 15 h. The<br>
solution is extracted by shaking with, respectively, a<br>
little dilute HC1 solution and saturated NaCl solution.<br>
The organic phase is dried over sodium sulfate and the<br>
chloroform is removed on a rotary evaporator.<br>
b) Reaction of PEO tosylate (a) with PPO diamine to<br>
give PEONHPPONHPEO copolymer<br>
A round-bottomed flask is charged with the PEO tosylate<br>
(4.5 g/5 mmol) , the PPO diamine (2000 g/mol; 5 g/<br>
2.5 mmol) and 2 ml of triethylamine (excess, because of<br>
the boiling point of 89°C). The mixture is heated under<br>
reflux with vigorous stirring at 150°C for 3 h. The<br>
product is dissolved in chloroform and extracted by<br>
shaking with, respectively, a little water, dilute HC1<br>
solution, dilute NaOH solution and saturated NaCl<br>
solution. The organic phase is dried over sodium<br>
sulfate and the chloroform (along with residual<br>
triethylamine) is removed on a rotary evaporator.<br>
c) Reaction of the PEONHPPONHPEO copolymer (b) with<br>
acryloyl chloride<br>
3 g (0.86 mmol) of PEONHPPONHPEO copolymer and 0.15 g<br>
(1.71 mmol) of acryloyl chloride are dissolved in<br>
chloroform and the solution is cooled to about 10 to<br>
15°C. 0.17 g (1.71 mmol) of triethylamine is added<br>
dropwise and the solution is stirred at room<br>
temperature for about 15 h. The solution is extracted<br>
by shaking with, respectively, a little dilute HC1<br>
solution, dilute NaOH solution and saturated NaCl<br>
solution. The organic phase is dried over sodium<br>
sulfate and the chloroform is removed on a rotary<br>
evaporator (waterbath at 25°C).<br>
The products synthesized were analyzed by means of 1H<br>
NMR spectroscopy and GPC, the protons of the CH=CH2<br>
group being clearly in evidence at between 5.5 and<br>
6.5 ppm. The GPC elution diagrams showed the higher<br>
molar mass of the products as compared with the<br>
reactants. The products still, however, contained a<br>
reactant fraction with a lower molar mass. The LCST<br>
temperature of a 0.5% strength aqueous solution is 1 to<br>
2°C; at higher polymer concentrations a slight<br>
turbidity is in evidence even at 0°C.<br>

(Version (d))<br>
Synthesis of N,N-diethylacrylamide LCST polymers<br>
a) Preparation of the initiator solution<br>
In a 2 1 three-necked flask with reflux condenser, on<br>
which a drying tube is mounted, and nitrogen feed line,<br>
1000 ml of tetrahydrofuran, distilled a number of times<br>
over sodium, 40 g of naphthalene and 6 g of sodium<br>
chips are stirred at 20°C under an absolutely dry<br>
nitrogen atmosphere. Over the course of 2 h the sodium<br>
passes into solution to form the addition compound,<br>
which is deep green in color. The solution prepared is<br>
then 0.25 molar with respect to sodium.<br>
b) Implementation of the polymerization<br>
The operations below must likewise be carried out with<br>
careful exclusion of air and moisture.<br>
A 1 liter three-necked flask is charged under a pure<br>
nitrogen atmosphere with 300 ml of tetrahydrofuran<br>
freshly distilled over sodium. Then 20 ml of the<br>
naphthalene-sodium solution from a) are transferred to<br>
a dropping funnel mounted on the flask, and the final<br>
impurities in the flask are removed using a few drops<br>
of this solution. As soon as the green color is<br>
maintained, 500 ml of this 0.25 M solution are run in.<br>
Subsequently, with vigorous stirring and over the<br>
course of 30 minutes, a solution of 317 g of N,N-<br>
diethylacrylamide (2.5 mol) in 1000 ml of<br>
tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise. The solution<br>
immediately changes color. By means of external cooling<br>
the temperature is held at 15-20°C, and the N,N-<br>
diethylacrylamide added dropwise undergoes<br>
polymerization practically within a few seconds. After<br>
- the end of the addition of N, N-diethylacrylamide the<br>
polymerization is terminated by addition of an excess<br>
of 12 g of acryloyl chloride. The reaction mixture is<br>
worked up by adding 10 ml of methanol before the<br>
solvent is stripped off. The product obtained has an<br>
average molar mass of about 4700 g/mol and an LCST of<br>
about 39°C.<br>

(Version (e))<br>
Synthesis of N-vinylcaprolactam LCST polymers<br>
The polymerization of 348 g (2.5 mol) of N-vinylcapro-<br>
lactam takes place in the same way as that of the N,N-<br>
diethylacrylamide. The product obtained has an average<br>
molar mass of about 5700 g/mol and an LCST of about<br>
32°C.<br>
Example 8<br>
(Version (f))<br>
Synthesis of methyl vinyl ether LCST polymers<br>
The polymerization of 145 g (2.5 mol) of methyl vinyl<br>
ether takes place in the same way as that of the N,N-<br>
diethylacrylamide. The sticky product obtained has an<br>
average molar mass of about 2500 g/mol and an LCST of<br>
28 to 30°C.<br>
Use Examples 1 to 6<br>
A pearlescent pigment (Iriodin Afflair® 504;<br>
manufacturer Merck KGaA, Darmstadt) is coated with the<br>
LCST polymers of product versions (a) to (f). An<br>
appropriate way of quickly investigating the<br>
effectiveness of the polymeric coating of particles has<br>
proven to be the use of platelet-shaped pearlescent<br>
pigments. Since the unmodified form is deposited<br>
relatively quickly in water, the improvement in<br>
stability as a result of treatment with the LCST<br>
polymer of the invention can be assessed within a short<br>
time. The altered color effects as well can easily be<br>
determined.,<br>
Use Example 1<br>
To treat Iriodin Afflair® 504 with the LCST polymer of<br>
Example 1 (version (a)) a 0.5% strength polymer<br>
solution is used. The pigment (10% by weight) is<br>
dispersed in water at 800 rpm for 15 minutes. The<br>
dispersion is subsequently cooled to a temperature of<br>
0.5°C. Following the addition of the polymer solution<br>
the pigment is coated with the polymer at 11°C for 30<br>
minutes and the precipitated polymer is then cross-<br>
linked for 3 h. The initiator system used is, per gram<br>
of polymer, 0.8 g of sodium pyrosulfite, 0.4 g of<br>
iron (II) sulfate and 0.8 g of potassium<br>
peroxodisulfate. The polymer concentration, based on<br>
pigment, was 5% by weight.<br>
Use Example 2<br>
In a similar way, Iriodin Afflair® is treated with the<br>
LCST polymer of Example 4 (version (b)), the<br>
temperature of the pigment dispersion being raised from<br>
0.5°C to 11°C in order to coat the pigment. The polymer<br>
layer is crosslinked using the polymerization initiator<br>
of Use Example" 1 over a period of 3 h.<br>
Use Example 3<br>
In a similar way, Iriodin Afflair® 504 is treated with<br>
the LCST polymer of Example 5 (version (c)), the<br>
temperature of the pigment dispersion being raised from<br>
0.5°C to 11°C in order to coat the pigment. The polymer<br>
layer is crosslinked using the polymerization initiator<br>
of Use Example 1 over a period of 3 h.<br>
Use Example 4<br>
In a similar way, Iriodin Afflair® 504 is treated with<br>
the LCST polymer of Example 6 (version (d)), the<br>
temperature of the pigment dispersion being raised from<br>
10°C to 50°C in order to coat the pigment. The polymer<br>
layer is crosslinked using the polymerization initiator<br>
of Use Example 1 over a period of 3 h.<br>
Use Example 5<br>
In a similar way, Iriodin Afflair® 504 is treated with<br>
the LCST polymer of Example 7 (version (e)), the<br>
temperature of the pigment dispersion being raised from<br>
10°C to 40°C in order to coat the pigment. The polymer<br>
layer is crosslinked using the polymerization initiator<br>
of Use Example 1 over a period of 3 h.<br>
Use Example 6<br>
In a similar way, Iriodin Afflair® 504 is treated with<br>
the LCST polymer of Example 8 (version (f)), the<br>
temperature of the pigment dispersion being raised from<br>
10°C to 48°C in order to coat the pigment. The polymer<br>
layer is crosslinked using the polymerization initiator<br>
of Use Example 1 over a period of 3 h.<br>
Use Example 7 (comparative)<br>
In a similar way, Iriodin Afflair® 504 is treated with<br>
the LCST polymer of the comparative example, the<br>
temperature of the pigment dispersion being raised from<br>
about 0°C to 5°C in order to coat the pigment. The<br>
polymer layer is crosslinked using the polymerization<br>
initiator of Use Example 1 over a period of 3 h.<br>
The stabilizing effect of the treatment of the pigment<br>
with the LCST polymer was assessed according to the<br>
sedimentation behavior, by monitoring the settling<br>
behavior of the 0.5% by weight pigment dispersion in<br>
water. The results of these investigations are depicted<br>
in Figures 1 and 2. Figures 1 and 2 show that both the<br>
untreated pigment and the pigment treated with the<br>
comparison polymer had settled to a high extent after<br>
60 minutes, whereas the pigment treated with the LCST<br>
polymers of the invention showed only slight settling.<br>
The treated pigments were incorporated into a 2-<br>
component hydroacrylic-melamine varnish at a<br>
concentration of 10% by weight, based on the solids<br>
content, by dispersion (peripheral speed 4 m/s, 15°C,<br>
10 min) and investigated for their color properties<br>
using an MA 68 Multi-Angle Spectrophotometer<br>
colorimeter from X-Rite. The results of these<br>
investigations are summarized in Table I.<br><br>
The figures given in Table I were based on the<br>
untreated pigment as reference. The state of dispersion<br>
and the orientation of the platelet-shaped effect<br>
pigments play a distinct role at low viewing angles. It<br>
is clearly apparent that the LCST treatment has a<br>
positive outcome for the color properties (lightness,<br>
hue) of the effect pigment. This can be attributed to<br>
the better state of dispersion and the flatter<br>
orientation of the pigment particles.<br>
The figures reported for AL, Aa and Ab in the inventive<br>
examples in Table 1 can be attributed to the<br>
orientation of the pigment particles. The pigment<br>
treated with the polymer from the comparative example,<br>
in contrast, showed lower orientation figures, which<br>
are comparable with the figures for the untreated<br>
pigment.<br>
Use Example 8<br>
A semiconductor wafer with a silicon dioxide surface<br>
measuring 1 * 1 cm is immersed in 3 ml of distilled<br>
water. The system is cooled to 2°C and 0.2 ml of a 10%<br>
strength by weight LCST polymer solution of Example 1<br>
is added. After two hours at 2°C the system is heated<br>
to 23°C over the course of an hour. Thereafter it is<br>
cooled to 2°C again, though only for a period of 10<br>
minutes, and within an hour is heated to 23°C. This<br>
cycle of cooling and heating is carried out a total of<br>
three times. After the final cycle the wafer remains at<br>
23 °C in the liquid coating medium for 24 hours and<br>
thereafter is rinsed off with distilled water. The<br>
polymer layer is subsequently crosslinked under thermal<br>
induction; for this purpose the wafer is heated in a<br>
drying oven at temperatures of 70 - 100°C for 5 hours.<br>
Another possibility for crosslinking the polymer layer<br>
is to irradiate the coated wafer with intense visible<br>
light for 5 hours.<br>
In a similar way the silicon wafer is treated with the<br>
LCST polymer of Examples 4 and 5, the temperature range<br>
of the polymer solution in the coating operation<br>
extending from 2°C to 23°C. The crosslinking operation<br>
takes place in the same way as for the polymer of<br>
Example 1.<br>
In a similar way the silicon wafer is treated with the<br>
LCST polymers of Examples 6 to 8, the temperature range<br>
of the polymer solution in the coating operation<br>
extending from 10°C to 50°C, 10°C to 40°C and 10°C to<br>
48°C, respectively. The crosslinking operation takes<br>
place in the same way as for the polymer of Example 1.<br>
The semiconductor wafer coated by the process described<br>
above with the LCST polymer now possesses a more<br>
strongly hydrophobic surface than a wafer without the<br>
coating. This can be documented experimentally by<br>
means of water droplets applied to the surface. The<br>
coated and therefore more hydrophobic surface is wetted<br>
less effectively by water than the unmodified surface.<br>
The water droplet beads off from the coated wafer; on<br>
the unmodified surface the droplet spreads out.<br>
