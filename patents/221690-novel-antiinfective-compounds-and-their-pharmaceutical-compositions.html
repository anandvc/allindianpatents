The present invention also relates to novel intermediates, methods for their preparation and their use in the preparation of compounds of formula (I).<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Since the discovery of penicillin, pharmaceutical companies have produced more than one hundred antibacterial agents to combat a wide variety of bacterial infections. In the past several years, due to the misuse of these antibiotics there has been rapid emergence of bacterial resistance to several of these antibiotics. The multidrug resistance among these bacterial pathogens may also be due to mutation leading to more virulent clinical isolation, the most disturbing milestone has been the acquisition of resistance to vancomycin, an antibiotic generally regarded as the agent of last resort for serious Gram-positive infections. This growing multidrug resistance has recently rekindled interest in the search for new structural class of antibiotic that inhibit or kill these bacteria possibly by novel mechanisms.<br><br>
A problem of larger dimension is the increasing incidence of the more virulent, Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureas (MRSA) among clinical isolates found worldwide. Many MRSA strains are resistant to most of the known antibiotics, but have remained sensitive to vancomycin. However, in view of the increasing reports of vancomycin resistant clinical bacterial isolates and growing problem of bacterial resistance, there is an urgent need for new molecular entities effective against the emerging and currently problematic Gram-positive organisms.<br>
Bacterial infections and antibacterial resistance are long term problems that call for innovative new therapeutics.<br>
There is an urgent need for novel antibacterial compounds. The wide spread use, rather misuse of antibacteria has led to an increase in multidrug resistant bacteria. This is further escacerbated by the use of antibacterials as feed supplements in farm animals and poultry. Yet new classes are unfortimately difficult to develop and any new drugs may quickly loose effectiveness, for example, the first entirely new antibacterial released in market over the past 30 years like Linezolid (Zyovx , Pharmacia Upjohn) proves the capacity for microorganism to develop resistance. Soon after introduction, clinics reported cases of resistance (Lancet 2001, 358(9277): 207-8) and resistant strains have been selected in the lab where a target site alteration was found to reduce drug binding (Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001, 3(3): 288-294)<br>
Advancements have been made by several firms in expanding oxazolidinons (Linezolide class of compounds) SAR (structure activity relationship) as well as the spectrum of activity to include the fastidious Gram negative organisms such as Hemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) and Morexella catarrhalis (M. catarrhalis).<br>
With this background we initiated our research program in the area of triazoles and invented new class of chemical entities such as 1,2,3-triazoles effective against wide variety of infectious pathogens including Gram positive/Gram negative and aerobic, anaerobic bacteria.<br>
Various l,2,3-tria2oles, 1,2,4-triazoles and benzotriazoles have been reported to show biological activities ranging from anti-inflammatory to antiproliferative and have therefore found applications in medicinal chemistry. The literature survey particularly reveals the use of 1,2,3-triazoles, for the treatment of neuropathic pain and associated hyperalgesia, including trigeminal and herpectic neuralgia,  diabetic neuropathic pain, migraine,  causalgia and<br><br>
deafferentation syndromes such as brachial plexus avulsion, an anticoccidiostat, as antiproliferative agents, for antimetastatic activity in a model of ovanan cancer progression, for anti-inflammatory effect, controlling activity against noxious organisms, for the treatment of ischemia, anti-human immunodeficiency virus activity etc.<br>
However, there are no reports of l,2,3-tria2ole derivatives of the present invention being used for treating bacterial infections, specifically against multidrug resistant strains.<br>
The new class of triazoles of the present invention is useful for the treatment of a number of resistant and sensitive gram-positive strains both in vitro and in vivo. (a)   Chem. Pharm. Bull. 48(12), 1935-1946 (2000) discloses the triazoles of formula (ia) and (ib), which are reported as antifungal agents,<br><br>
where X represents N, CH or CH2.<br>
U.S. 6,054,471 discloses fluorinated triazoles of the formula (ii), which are reported for the treatment of neuropathic pain and associated hyperalgesia, including trigeminal and herpectic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathic pain, migraine, causalgia and deafferentation syndromes such as brachial plexus avulsion,<br><br>
where Ph is an o-fluorinated phenyl group which may be additionally substituted by 1 or 2 halogen atoms selected from fluorine and chlorine; R11  is hydrogen, carbamoyl, N-(C2-C5) alkanoylcarbamoyl or N,N"di-(C1-C4)alkylcarbamoyl; R21 is carbamoyl, N-(C2-C5) alkanoylcarbamoyl or N,N-di- (C1-C4) alylcarbamoyl.<br>

Administration by the oral route is preferred, being more convenient and avoiding the possible pain and irritation of injection. However, in circumstances where the patient cannot swallow the medication, or absorption following oral administration is impaired, as by disease or other abnormality, it is essential that the drug be administered parenterally. By either route, the dosage is in the range of about 0.5 mg/kg to about 50 mg / kg body weight of the subject per day administered singly or as a divided dose. However, the optimum dosage whether for prevention or treatment for the individual subject being treated will be determined by the person responsible for treatment, generally smaller doses being administered initially and thereafter increments made to determine the most suitable dosage.<br>
It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
The manner in which the compounds of this invention can be prepared is illustrated in the following examples, which demonstrate the preparation of typical species of the invention. In these examples, the identities of compounds, intermediates and final, were confirmed by infrared, nuclear magnetic spectral analyses as necessary. The examples are for the purpose of illustration only and should not be regarded as limiting the invention in any way.<br><br><br>

A saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate (133mg, 1.58mmol) in water (5ml) was added to an ice cooled solution of C-[l-[4-(3,6-dihydro-2H-thiopyran-4-yl)-3-fluoro-phenyl]-lH-[l,2,3]triazol-4-yl}-methylamine (200 mg, 0.689 mmol), obtained in example-12, in dichloromethane (5 mL). Thiophosgene (0.068 mL, 0.895 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture and stirred at the same temperature for 0.5 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with dichloromethane (50 mL), washed the organic layer with water followed by brine and dried over sodium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated and the residue was refluxed with methanol (15 mL) for 16 h. After evaporation of methanol, the residue was purified by column chromatography over silica gel (methanol/chloroform; 1:25) to furnish the title compound as a creamy white solid (150 mg, 60%), mp 110-113 T.<br>

In vitro Data<br>
Minimum Inhibiton Concentrations (MICs) were determined by broth microdilution technique as per the guidelines prescribed in the fifth edition of Approved Standards, NCCLS document M7-A5 Vol 20 - No 2, 2000 Villinova, PA.<br>
Initial stock solution of the test compound was prepared in DMSO. Subsequent two fold dilutions were carried out in sterile Mueller Hinton Broth (Difco) (MHB).<br>
Frozen cultures stocks were inoculated into 50 ml sterile MHB in 250 ml Erlyn Meyer flasks.<br>
Composition of MHB is as follows: Beef Extract Powder - 2.0 s/litre Acid Digest of Casein - 17.5 g/ litre Soluble Starch - 1.5 e/litre Final pH 7.3 ±0.1<br>
Flasks were incubated for 4 to 5 h at 35 'oC on a rotary shaker at 150 rpm. Inoculum was prepared by diluting the culture in sterile MHB to obtain a turbidity of 0.5 McFarland standard. This corresponds to 1-2 x 10 CFU/ml. The stock was further diluted in sterile broth to obtain 1-2X10 CFU/ml. 50µ1 of the above diluted inoculum was added from 1-10 wells. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C.<br>
MIC is read as the lowest concentration of the compound that completely inhibits growth of the organism in the microdilution wells as detected by the unaided eye.<br><br><br><br>
