				<td>NOVEL POLYMER AND CEMENT ADMIXTURE USING THE SAME<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel polymer and cement admixture comprising the same.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
A cement admixture is usually added to a cement composition (including, cement paste prepared by adding water thereinto, mortar prepared by mixing sand as fine aggregate thereinto, and concrete prepared by mixing pebble as coarse aggregate thereinto) for enhancing the durability and strength by reducing of the unit quantity of water. A cement admixture also has function of preventing cement particles from being agglutinated by absorbed to the cement particles and enhancing the dispersibility of the cement composition in use.<br>
As a cement admixture, for instance, naphthalene series and polycarboxylic acid series are known. The Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2001-220417, for instance, discloses that a copolymer used for cement admixtures, prepared by copolymerization of an unsaturated carboxylic monomer and an unsaturated polyalkylene glycol monomer.<br>
This copolymer, used for cement admixtures, including a carboxylic group derived from an unsaturated carboxylic monomer can act as an absorbing group which is absorbed to the cement<br><br>
particles, and a polyalkylene glycol chain derived from an unsaturated polyalkylene glycol ether series monomer can act as a dispersing group which disperses the cement particles.<br>
However, a copolymer used for cement admixtures such as the one disclosed in the Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2001-220417,  can be a cement  admixture exhibiting certain dispersing ability by means of the steric repulsion of the polyalkylene glycol chain derived from the unsaturated polyalkylene glycol ether series monomer. In addition, it is required that the development of cement admixtures which can exhibit further higher dispersing abilities in order to reduce the quantity of cement admixtures.<br>
On the other hand, in Wako Technical Bulletin, "Polymeric azo initiators -VPS series and VPE series-", published by Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., polymeric azo initiators, having polyethylene glycol chains, and block copolymers consisting of polyethylene glycol chain unit and methyl methacrylate or styrene unit, are disclosed and explained.<br>
Furthermore, in "Block Copolymers Derived from Azobiscyanopentanoic Acid. VI. Synthesis of a Polyethylene glycol-Polystyrene Block Copolymer", J. Polym. Sci. : Part A, : Polymer Chemistry, (U.S.A.) published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc, on page 405-413, vol. 24 in 1986, Akira Ueda et al., and "Block Copolymerization Initiated with a Polyethylene Glycol Containing Scissile Azo Linkages in Its Main Chain", J. Polym. Sci. : Part A : Polymer Chemistry, (U.S.A.), published by John Wiley &amp; Sons,<br>
2<br><br>
Inc, on page 3495-3498, vol. 25, 1987, Akira Ueda et al., a production method of polymeric azo initiators with polyethylene glycol are disclosed and explained block copolymers consisting of polyethylene glycol chains and styrene, methyl methacrylate, methyl acrylate, vinyl acetate, or acrylonitrile.<br>

However, in the use of the block copolymers disclosed in the above three non-patent literatures, steric repulsion caused by the polyethylene glycol chain are, to some extent, expected but these block copolymers are not able to be used as cement admixtures because they do not have the structural segments adsorbed to cement particles.<br>

Hereinafter, a polyalkylene glycol chain described as PAG in the above formulae (1) to (4) is referred to as "polyalkylene glycol chain (1)", and a polyalkylene glycol chain derived from an unsaturated polyalkylene glycol monomer constituting a polymer segment represented by BL is occasionally referred to as "polyalkylene glycol chain (2)".  Polyalkylene glycol chain (1) and<br>
12<br><br>
(2) is preferably to be substantially linear.<br>
The mean molecular weight of the novel polymer in this invention is preferably more than 10, 000, more preferably more than 15,000, even more preferably more than 20,000, and especially more preferably more than 25,000, as well as, is preferably less than 300,000, more preferably less than 200,000, even more preferably less than 150,000, and especially preferably less than 100,000. The mean molecular weight is measured by the method described in Example.<br>
Regarding the novel polymer in this invention, the length of a polyalkylene glycol chain (1) is not limited because it depends on the kinds of the polymerization initiator and the chain transfer agent to be used. However, for instance, in the case of adding to a cement admixture composition, from a viewpoint of effectively dispersing the cement particles, the mean addition molecular number of alkylene oxide is preferably more than 10 mole, more preferably more than 20 mole, even more preferably more than 30 mole, further preferably more than 4 0 mole, more further preferably more than 50 mole, furthermore preferably more than 80 mole, moreover preferably more than 100 mole, and especially more preferably more than 130 mole, as well as, is preferably less than 500 mole, more preferably less than 4 00 mole, even more preferably less than 350 mole, and further preferably less than 300 mole, more further preferably less than 280 mole, furthermore preferably less than 250 mole, moreover preferably less than 220 mole, and especially preferably less than 200 mole.<br>
13<br><br>
The polyalkylene glycol chain (1) seems to have, as described in Example below, more enhanced steric repulsion effect when it is moderately long. On the other hand, when the length of the polyalkylene glycol chain (1) is too short, the steric repulsion effect is not enough and the dispersing effect is the same as the publicly known copolymers for cement admixture.<br>
Alkylene glycol constituting the polyalkylene glycol chain (1) is to be an alkylene glycol having 2 to 18 carbon atoms, however for instance, from a viewpoint of enhancing cement particle dispersibility or hydrophilicity, it is preferable that the alkylene glycol is to be one having 2 to 4 carbon atoms in the case of cement admixture compositions.<br>
Further,  alkylene glycol constituting the polyalkylene glycol chain (1) is required to have enhanced hydrophilicity from a viewpoint of effectively dispersing cement particles in the case of cement admixture compositions and is preferable to mainly be an ethylene glycol unit thereof having 2 carbon atoms. The ratio of ethylene glycol unit in polyalkylene glycol chain (1) is preferably more 50 mol%, more preferably more than 60 mol%r further preferably more than 70 mol%, especially preferably more than 80 mol%.<br>
The constituent unit of polyalkylene glycol chain (2) is preferable to be mainly ethylene glycol unit, and the ratio of ethylene glycol unit in polyalkylene glycol chain (2) is preferably more than 50 mol%, more preferably more than 60 mol%, further preferably more than 70 mol%, especially preferably more than 80<br>
14<br><br>
mol%.  As the other constituent units, for instance, propylene glycol unit or butylene glycol unit or so are applicable. The ratio of the other components is preferable to be less than 50 mol%, more preferably less than 4 0 mol%, further preferably less than 30 mol%, especially preferably less than 20 mol%.<br>
Regarding the novel polymer of the present invention, a polymer segment bonded to the polyalkylene glycol chain (1) is constituted by plural unsaturated monomers, wherein at least one of the monomers is unsaturated carboxylic acid monomer or unsaturated polyalkylene glycol monomer. Applicable unsaturated carboxylic acid monomers and unsaturated polyalkylene glycol monomers in the present invention are described in detail hereinafter.<br>
The novel polymer in this invention has carboxyl group(s) derived from unsaturated carboxylic acid monomers, or occasionally has polyalkylene glycol chain (2) derived from unsaturated polyalkylene glycol monomers. Therefore, the number of carboxyl groups, or the length or number of the polyalkylene glycol chain (2) depends on the kind or amount of unsaturated carboxylic acid monomers or unsaturated polyalkylene glycol monomers being used, so they are not limited.<br>
Since the novel polymer in this invention basically has carboxyl group (s). derived from unsaturated carboxylic acid at one or both end(s) of the polyalkylene glycol chain (1), for instance, it is thought that the polymer can be absorbed to cement particles at the carboxyl group and can effectively disperse the cement<br>
15<br><br>
particles; with steric repulsion derived from the polyalkylene glycol chain (1) .  Also the novel polymer in this invention occasionally has polyalkylene glycol chain (2)  derived from unsaturated polyalkylene glycol monomers at one or both end(s) of the polyalkylene glycol chain (1) , so steric repulsion derived from polyalkylene glycol chain (2) is added to that derived from polyalkylene  glycol  chain (1),  for instance,  the  cement dispersibility seems to be enhanced in a synergistic manner. <production of the novel polymer><br>
The novel polymer in this invention is obtained by<br>
polymerization  of  an  unsaturated  carboxylic  acid  monomer (hereinafter referred to as "monomer (A)") and an unsaturated<br>
polyalkylene glycol monomer (hereinafter referred to as "monomer (B)") in the presence of a polymerization initiator having a<br>
polyalkylene glycol chain and a radical generation segment, and/or<br>
a polymeric chain transfer agent having a polyalkylene glycol chain. As monomer (A), for instance, formula (5) shown below is<br>
applicable.<br><br>
(In the above Formula, R1, R2 and R3 are, being independent on each other, hydrogen atom, methyl group, or -(CH2)XCOOM2 (wherein, -(CH2)xCOOM2 is able to form anhydride with -COOM1 or the other -(CH2)XCOOM2) , and x is an integral number from 0 to 2, M1 and M2, being independent on each other, is hydrogen atom, monovalent metal<br>
16<br>
atom, bivalent metal atom, trivalent metal atom, quaternary ammonium group, organic amine group.)<br>
As concrete examples of monomer (A), for instance, monocarboxyl acid monomers such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid or crotonic acid; dicarboxylic acid such as maleic acid, itaconic acid or fumaric acid; anhydride or salt (for instance, alkaline metal salt, alkaline-earth metal salt, trimetallic salt, ammonium salt or organic amine salt) of these carboxylic acid. The monomers are used alone or in combination thereof. Among these monomer, from a viewpoint of polymerization ability, acrylic acid, methacrylic<br>
acid, maleic acid, maleic acid anhydride or the salt thereof is<br>
preferable, furthermore, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid or the salt<br>
thereof is more preferable.<br>
As monomer (B), for instance, formula (6) shown below is<br>
applicable.<br><br>
(In the above Formula, R4, R5 and R6 are, being independent on each other, hydrogen atom or methyl group, R1 is hydrogen atom or hydrocarbon group having 1 to 20 carbon atom, AO expresses , being independent on each other, one or more than two kinds of oxyalkylene group having 2 to 18 carbon atoms (wherein, more than two kinds of oxyalkylene group being introduced as block form or random form is applicable),and y is an integral number from 0 to 2, z is an integral number of 0 or 1, and n is an integral number from 1 to<br>
17<br><br>
300 expressing mean molecular number of added oxyalkylene group.) In the above Formula (6), as hydrocarbon group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms described as R7, aliphatic alkyl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, cycloaliphatic alkyl group having 3 to 20 carbon atoms, alkenyl group having 2 to 20 carbon atoms, alkynyl group having 2 to 20 carbon atoms, or aryl group having 6 to 20 carbon atoms are applicable.<br>
In the above Formula (6), group R7 is, from a viewpoint of cement particle dispersibility, preferably hydrophilic group, more concretely, hydrogen atom or alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, more, preferably hydrogen atom or alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, further preferably hydrogen atom or alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms.<br>
In the above Formula (6), the part described as -(AO)n- is the polyalkylene glycol chain (2) . The oxyalkylene group described as AO is required to have enhanced hydrophilicity from a viewpoint of effective cement particle dispersibility, and mainly to be oxyalkylene group having 2 carbon atoms- The ratio of oxyalkylene group having 2 carbon atoms in oxyalkylene chain having n numbers or oxyalkylene group is preferably more than 50 mol%, more preferably more than 60 mol%, further preferably more than 70 mol%, especially preferably more than 80 mol%.<br>
Further, in the case of preparation of a concrete composition by adding to cement admixture, from a viewpoint of reducing viscosity or stiffing of the concrete, it is preferable to make some network among cement particles by introducing oxyalkylene<br>
18<br><br>
groups having more than three carbon atoms into an oxyalkylene chain, and make it to some extent hydrophobicity.  However, too much introduction of oxyalkylene groups having more than three carbon atoms might cause reduction of cement particle dispersibility because of enhancing the hydrophobicity of prepared polymer. Therefore the ratio of oxyalkylene group having more than three carbon atoms in oxyalkylene chain is preferably more than 1 mol%, more preferably more than 3 mol%, even more preferably more than 5 mol%, and especially more preferably more than 7 mol%, as well as, preferably less than 50 mol%, more preferably less than 40 mol%, even more preferably less than 30 mol%, and especially more preferably less than 20 mol%. Oxyalkylene group having 3 carbon atoms in oxyalkylene chain is able to be introduced in block form or random form, but introduction in block form, such as: oxyalkylene chain having oxyalkylene group having more than 3 carbon atoms - oxyalkylene chain containing oxyalkylene group having 2 carbon atoms - oxyalkylene chain containing oxyalkylene group having more than 3 carbon atoms, is preferable.<br>
Oxyalkylene group having 3 to 8 carbon atoms is desirable as the oxyalkylene group having more than 3 carbon atoms, for convenience for introduction or affinity with cement particles. Oxypropylene group having 3 carbon atoms or oxybutylene group having 4 carbon atoms are especially desirable for the oxyalkylene group.

Among the above hydraulic compositions, cement compositions, using cement as a hydraulic material, are most general, and a cement composition contains a cement admixture in this invention, cement and water, as essential component. Such a cement composition is a preferable embodiment of this invention.<br>
Cement used for a cement composition is not limited, and is preferably, concretely, for instance, portland cement (normal, high-early-strength, super high-early-strength, moderate heat, sulfate-proof, or low alkali type thereof), mixed cement (blast furnace cement, silica cement, fly-ash cement), white portland cement, almina cement, rapid curing cement (1 clinker rapid curing<br>

Mortar test was carried out under the condition of temperature<br>
of 20°C ±1°C and relative moisture of 60 %+10 %.<br>
First, 550 g of Taiheiyo normal Portland cement, 220 g of solution containing a polymer of this invention or a comparative polymer described in Table 1 and an antifoaming agent (NMB Inc. "MA404") and water were charged to hobert type mortar mixer (N-50; Robert Inc.), and mixed at one-speed for 30 seconds. During the mixing procedure of 30 seconds, 1,350 g of standard sand for cement strength testing (5.1.3 of JIS R5201-1997 annex 2) was charged. After the sand charge, mixing at two-speed for 30 seconds, then the mixing stopped, 15 seconds of scratching and dropping, and 75 seconds of standstill were carried out. After the 75 seconds of standstill, further 60 seconds of mixing at two-speed was carried out and mortar was prepared. A half of the prepared mortar was immediately filled into a flow corn (JIS R5201-1997) on a flow table (JIS R5201-1997); then the filled mortar was hit 15-times with a stick for hitting; and the remained mortar was filled up to the top end of the flow corn; then the filled mortar was hit another 15 times with the stick for hitting; finally the flow corn was fully filled with the remained mortar; and after that, the top surface of the filled mortar in the flow corn was. flattened.  Subsequently, the flow corn was lifted perpendicularly, and the lengths at two<br><br>
points (respectively, the longest diameter of the spread mortar and the diameter of at angle of 90 degree against said longest diameter) were measured, and the average of said two points was referred to as 0 hit flow value. After measuring of 0 hit flow value, immediately 15 times of falling hits were charged to the flow corn in 15 seconds, and the lengths of two points (the longest diameter of the spread mortar and the diameter of at angle of 90 degree against said longest diameter) were measured, and the average of said two points was referred to as 15 hit flow value. The longer either 0 hit flow value or 15 hit flow value is, the more superior the dispersibility thereof is. The result is shown in Table 1.<br>

As is obvious from Table 1, any mortar, using a polymer of this invention is, regardless of the smaller blending quantity of the polymer compared with the publicly known mortars by using the comparative polymers as copolymers used for cement admixtures, can indicate the same or more 0 hit flow value and 15 hit flow value. In another word, in the case of mortars using comparative polymers, a larger blending quantity of a polymer would be required for indicating the same 0 hit flow value and 15 hit flow value as in the case of using a polymer of this invention. Therefore, it is suggested that a polymer of this invention has more enhanced dispersibility than that of the comparative polymers. <reference example><br>

In this comparative example, a comparative methacrylester polymer was prepared by not using a polymeric chain transfer agent, but using a low molecular weight polymeri2ation reaction initiator. First, as a monomer mixture solution, solution containing methacrylic acid  (MAA),  PGM-25E  (methoxypolyethylene glycol methacrylate ester, mean molecular number of added ethyleneoxide is 25), 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) was prepared. Also, as a reaction  initiator  solution,  solution  containing  ammonium persulfate (APS) as described in Table 3 was prepared.<br>

Subsequently, a monomer mixture solution was delivered by drops for 4 hours and reaction initiation solution was delivered by drops at a constant rate for 5 hours. Further, after the reaction initiator solution adding was finished, polymerization was completed by keeping the temperature at 80°C for 1 hour. Subsequently, after cooling at room temperature, neutralization was carried out by using 30% NaOH solution as occasion demands.  Finally, solutions of comparative polymers (B-1) to (B-3) having mean molecular weight by weight in Table 3 was prepared.<br>

Next, an evaluation method of dispersibility of typical polymers and comparative polymers among polymers (B-1) to (B-23) prepared in the above synthetic example 13, comparative polymers (B-l) to (B-3) prepared in the above comparative example 3,and polymers (C-1) to (C-3) prepared in the above synthetic example 14 is described below. <evaluation method of dispersing ability: mortar test><br>
A mortar test was carried out under the condition of temperature of 20°C ±1°C, relative moisture of 60 %±10 %.<br>
First, 550 g of Taiheiyo normal Portland cement, 220 g of solution containing polymer of this invention or comparative polymer described in Table 5 or 6, anantifoaming agent (NMB Inc. "MA404") and water were charged to hobert type mortar mixer (N-50; Hobert Inc.), and mixed at one-speed for 30 seconds. During the mixing procedure of 30 seconds, 1,350 g of standard sand for cement strength testing (5.1.3 of JIS R5201-1997 annex 2) was charged. After the sand charge, mixing at two-speed for 30 seconds, then the mixing stopped, 15 seconds of scratching and dropping and 75 seconds of standstill were carried out. After the 75 seconds of standstill, further 60 seconds of mixing at two-speed was carried out and then the mortar was prepared. A half of the prepared mortar was immediately filled into a flow corn (JIS R5201-1997) on a flow table (JIS R5201-1997); then the filled mortar was hit 15 times with a stick for hitting; and the remained mortar was filled up to the top end of the flow corn; then the filled mortar was hit another 15 times with the stick for hitting; finally the flow corn<br>
105<br><br>
was fully filled with the remained mortar; and after that, the top surface of the filled mortar in the flow corn was flattened. Subsequently, the flow corn was lifted perpendicularly, and the lengths at two points (respectively, the longest diameter of the   spread mortar and the diameter of at angle of 90 degree against said longest diameter) were measured, and the average of said two points was referred to as 0 hit flow value. After measuring of 0 hit flow value, immediately 15 times of falling hits were charged to the flow corn in 15 seconds, and the lengths of two points (the longest diameter of the spread mortar and the diameter of at angle of 90 degree against said longest diameter) were measured, and the average of said two points was referred to as 15 hit flow value. The longer either 0 hit flow value or 15 hit flow value is, the more superior the dispersibility thereof is. The result is shown in Table 5 and 6.<br>
In the above mortar test, for confirming uniformity of the state of each mortar, the volumes of air and temperatures of the mortars were measured. The volumes of the mortars were measured as follows.  First, about 200 mL of mortar was injected to 500 mL of measuring cylinder and after hitting with stick of 8 mm diameter, crude air bubble was removed by vibrating the measuring cylinder. Also, about 200 mL of mortar was added and air bubble was removed likewise, thereafter the mass was measured, then the volume of air in the mortar was to be calculated from the measured mass and density of each material. The results are shown in Table 5 and 6.<br>

1) mass% against cement blending quantity<br><br>
As is obvious from Table 5, in the case of using polymers in this invention of 0.08 mass% addition, larger 0 hit flow value or 15 hit flow value of the mortars compared with the mortars using comparable polymers of the publicly known copolymers for cement admixtures were indicated under an equivalent'condition of air volume contained in the mortar and temperature. In another word, in the case of the mortar using comparative polymers, a larger blending quantity, for instance 0.09 or 0.10 mass%, of polymer adding would be required for indicating the equivalent 0 hit flow value and 15 hit flow value than that in the case of using a polymer in this invention. Therefore,, it is clear that a polymer of this invention has superior dispersibility than that of comparative polymers.<br>

As is obvious from Table 6, in the case of using a polymer of this invention, comparatively good 0 hit flow value or 15 hit flow value of each mortar was indicated when the blending quantity of the polymer was 0.09 mass% under an equivalent condition of air volume contained in the mortar and temperature. Therefore, it is clear that a polymer of this invention can exhibit superior dispersibility<br>
