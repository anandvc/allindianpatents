				<td>SESSION CONTINUITY IN COMMUNICATION NETWORKS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to session continuity in communication networks comprising mobile nodes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A user equipment (UE) or a mobile node may be allowed to be registered to an IMS (jp Multimedia Subsystem) via different access technologies at the same time. For example WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) access and UTRAN (UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network) access may be allowed in parallel. The parallel use of different access technologies may allow service continuity for example when a mobile user moves out of WLAN coverage and at the same time enters UTRAN coverage.<br>
VCC (Voice Call Continuity) is a technology defined by 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) that provides a possibility to transfer a voice call ongoing in an IMS domain to a CS (circuit switched) domain and vice versa without disrupting the can. There are however unresolved issues relating to service continuity when transferring from one network access technology to another.<br>
Let's assume the following scenario: First, a UE_A is registered to an IMS via WLAN (A_WLAN). Then, the user of the UE_A moves into an area where the WLAN coverage gets weaker but UTRAN is available. Therefore, the UEâ€žA registers to the IMS via UTRAN GPRS (General Packet Radio Services) (AJ3PRS) in parallel with the WLAN registration, in result, the UE__A has two parallel IMS registrations.<br>
Now, the UE_A can start to transfer its ongoing SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) dialogs (that is, ongoing multimedia sessions, Subscriptions e.g. to presence<br><br>
2<br>
information, etc.) from A_WLAN to A_GPRS. This procedure may be referred to as PS-to-PS handover (packet switched-to-packet switched handover).<br>
The UE_A may aiso have an ongoing multimedia session (for example, SIP INVITE initiated) that includes an audio part, as well as another RTP (Real Time Transport Protocol) transported media, such as a video share. In this case, the UE_A may desire that the audio part of this session is to be handled via a CS domain, whilst the video part should be handled via IMS (A_GPRS).<br>
There are three major issues in this scenario:<br>
1.	IMS PS-to-PS handover,<br>
2.	Voice Call Continuity, and<br>
3.	splitting the voice from other media.<br>
It is not yet certain how these issues should be handled in order to ensure service continuity both for the voice and other media. It is likely that in current solutions one or the other of the voice and other media may be discontinued when performing the transfer. Thus further considerations are needed.<br>

DETAILED SPECIFICATION<br>
In the following description, like numbers denote like parts.<br>
Fig. 1A shows a flow chart of a method according to an embodiment of the invention. The shown method is meant to be performed for example in a communication device.<br>
First in phase 100, the communication device has an ongoing communication session through a packet switched network. Then in phase 101, the communication device transfers the communication session from the packet switched network to a network providing both packet and circuit switched access. The communication session may be transferred for example from a WLAN network to an UTRAN network, if the user of the communication device moves into an area where WLAN coverage gets weaker but UTRAN is available, in connection with the transfer, the communication device informs in phase 102 an application server maintaining the communication session that the communication session is to be split into a packet switched part and a circuit switched part in the network providing both packet and circuit switched access. The application server may be for example an application server handling procedures relating to continuity of voice calls.<br>
In order to effect the transfer and the split of the session the communication device sends to the application server a transfer request of the circuit switched part and a transfer request of the packet switched part. The informing may be effected as part of one or both of the transfer requests, or by a separate message. By being informed of the split the application server knows to wait for the transfer request of both the circuit switched part and the packet switched part. More specific examples of the process are discussed below in connection with Figures 2-4.<br><br>
9<br>
Fig. 1B shows a flow chart of a method according to an embodiment of the invention. The shown method is meant to be performed for example in an application server of a communication network, which may be for example an application server handling procedures relating to continuity of voice calls..<br>
In phase 110 an indication that a communication session between a first communication device and a second communication device is to be split into a packet switched part and a circuit switched part is received from the first communication device. This may be in connection with the first communication device transferring from one network access type to another network access type. Then in phase 111, the application server waits for to receive a transfer request of both the packet switched part and the circuit switched part, and after receiving them the application server informs the second communication device of the split in phase 112. In this way the application server is able to inform the second communication device of both the circuit switched part and the packet switched part, whereby both parts may be allowed to continue undisrupted. In some embodiments of the invention, the step 112 may precede the step 111.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a system 200 according to an embodiment of the invention. The system comprises a UE_A 201 and a UE_B 202 communicating with each other. The UE_A 201 may have communication network access via a WLAN network 203 or an UTRAN/GERAN (for example, a GSM Edge Radio Access Network) network 204. The WLAN network is connected to a P-CSCF1 (Proxy Call Session Control Function) element 205, which is connected to a S-CSCF (Serving Call Session Control Function) element 206. The S-CSCF element 206 co-operates with an application server AS 207. The application server may be for example a VCC AS (Voice Call Continuity AS). Also the UTRAN/GERAN network 204 has a P-CSCF element P-CSCF2 208, which is connected to the S-CSCF element 206. For the purpose of circuit switched connections the UTRAN/GERAN network 204 is connected to a MGCF (Media Gateway Control Function) element 209, which is also connected to the S-CSCF element 206. It should be appreciated that an actual implementation may comprise various other network elements, but they are not of importance with regard to this invention.<br><br>
10<br>
Now the operation of an embodiment of the invention in the system 200 of Figure 2 is discussed (depicted by the three arrows shown in Figure 2). First (1) there is an ongoing session between the UE_A 201 and the UE_B 202 via the WLAN network 203 and P-CSCF1 205J S-CSCF 206 and AS 207 elements. The ongoing session comprises a voice part and another media part. Then (2) the UEâ€žA transfers access to the UTRAN/GERAN network 204. The UE_A does not terminate the registration to the WLAN network (yet), but maintains parallel registration to the WLAN network and the UTRAN/GERAN network.<br>
in order to effect transfer of the voice part of the ongoing session to the UTRAN/GERAN network the UE_A sends (3) to the MGCF element 209 a CS SETUP message towards VDN (VCC Domain Transfer Number) according to known VCC procedures. On the basis of the CS SETUP message the MGCF sends (4) through the S-CSCF 206 to the AS 207 a SIP INVITE with Request URI=VDN. On receipt of this INVITE the AS sends to the UEâ€žB a Re-INViTE (5) informing the UEJ3 of the transfer of the voice part.<br>
In order to effect transfer of the other media part of the ongoing session to the UTRAN/GERAN network the UE_A sends (6) through the P-CSCF2 208 and S-CSCF 206 to the AS 207 a SIP INVITE with Request URi=VDI (VCC Domain Transfer URi) and a session identifier, for example a Replaces header or R-URI, pointing to the ongoing session. On receipt of this INVITE the AS sends to the UE__B a Re-INVITE (7) informing the UE__B of the transfer of the other media part.<br>
It should be noted that in prior art solutions, the Re-INVITE (5) removes the other media part from the ongoing session and the Re-INVITE (7) removes the voice part from the ongoing session. Thereby according to an embodiment of the invention, the AS should wait for both of the INVITES (4) and (6) before sending the Re-INVITES (5) and (7) in order to reduce discontinuity in the media flow. The AS may also combine the Re-INVITES (5) and (7) into one Re-INVITE informing the UE__B of the transfer of both voice and other media part, whereby a minimal disruption to the media flow may be achieved.<br><br>
11<br>
Embodiments illustrated in messaging diagrams of Figure 3 and 4 relate to possible ways of informing for example the AS 207 of Figure 2 about a need to split a communication session into a circuit switched and a packet switched part so that the AS knows to wait for INVITES (or other transfer requests) relating to both parts.<br>
In Figure 3 a UE_A first sets up via a WLAN network a communication session with a UE_B by sending a SIP INVITE 3-1 for a session comprising both audio and video. VCC AS forwards the SIP INVITE 3-2 to the UE_B. Later on the UE_A transfers to an UTRAN network. In order to effect the transfer the UE_A sends in parallel a SIP INVITE 3-3 for transferring the other media part and a CS SETUP message 3-5 for transferring the voice part.<br>
The SIP INVITE 3-3 comprises VDI as request URI and a session identifier (pointing to the ongoing session). The session identifier may be for example a Replaces header. The CS SETUP message 3-5 differs from corresponding messages known in prior art in that it includes an indication that media splitting is desired. A MGCF receives the CS SETUP message 3-5 and sends on the basis of that a SIP INVITE 3-6 comprising VDN as request URI. Also indication of the desired media split is included in the SIP INVITE 3-6.<br>
The indication included in the CS SETUP message 3-5 may be for example:<br>
a new indication within the User-to-User~Signa!ling Information Element of<br>
the CS SETUP message, or a specific VDN.<br>
Additionally the indication may be, for example, an agreed bit pattern, which the application server knows to be an indication of that media splitting is desired. However as is evident to the skilled person, there are an infinite number of equivalent possibilities to implement such indication. The only requirement is that the application server needs to be able to recognize that the indication is an<br><br>
12<br>
indication of that media splitting is desired. In some embodiments, a single bit in a field may suffice.<br>
The VCC AS receives the SIP INViTEs 3-3 and 3-6. It should however be noted that either one of the SIP INVITE 3-3 and the $\P INVITE 3-6 may arrive at the VCC AS first. If the VCC AS receives the SIP INVITE 3-3 first, the VCC AS knows on the basis of the session identifier, and the VDI included in the SIP INVITE 3-3 that in this scenario media splitting needs to be performed and thus knows to wait for the other SIP INVITE 3-6. That is, the session identifier and the VDI in the SIP INVITE 3-3 constitute an indication of that media splitting is desired. It should be noted that the SIP INVITE 3-3 may also include some other indication of that media splitting is desired.<br>
If the VCC AS receives the SIP INVITE 3-6 first, the VCC AS knows on the basis of the indication included in the SIP INVITE 3-6 that in this scenario media splitting needs to be performed and thus knows to wait for the other SIP INVITE 3-3. Herein one should note that if the CS SETUP 3-5 and the SIP INVITE 3-6 do not include an indication of the desired media split, the VCC AS would assume normal VCC procedure and wouid not expect the SIP INV|JE 3-3 to arrive. Therefore the VCC AS would drop the other media part of the ongoing communication session.<br>
After receiving both invites 3-3 and 3-6 the VCC AÂ§ sends a Re-INVITE 3-7 to the UE_B, the Re-INVITE 3-7 indicating transfer of both the voice part and the other media part of the ongoing communication session, it should be noted that the Re-INVITE 3-7 may be replaced by two parallel Re-INVITEs (one for the voice part and one for the other media part). A benefit achieved by combining the Re-INVITES is that it is likely to cause minimal disruption to the ongoing communication session.<br>
In summary, by having an indication of desired media split in both SIP INViTEs 3-3 and 3-6 the UE_A can be sure that the VCC AS always knows to wait for both invites. A benefit achieved by this embodiment is that the procedure may be fast.<br><br>
13<br>
In Figure 4 a UE_A sets up via a WLAN network a communication session with a UE__B the same way as in Figure 3 by means of SIP iNVITEs 3-1 and 3-2 and later on transfers to an UTRAN network.<br>
Now the UE_A first sends only a SIP INVITE 3-3 for transferring the other media part. The VCC AS receives the SIP iNVITE 3-3 and knows on the basis of the session identifier, and the VDI included in the invite that in this scenario media splitting needs to be performed. The VCC AS confirms to the UE_A that the SIP INVITE 3-3 has been received. The confirmation may be effected for example by responding with a reliably sent provisional response 4-4, such as a SIP 180 (Ringing) response or SIP 183 (Session Progress) response.<br>
On receipt of the response 4-4 the UE_A knows that the SIP INVITE 3-3 has been received and that the VCC AS is waiting for an invite for the voice part. Then the UE_A sends a CS SETUP message 4-5 for transferring the voice part. A MGCF receives the CS SETUP message 4-5 and sends on the basis of that a SIP INVITE 4-6 comprising VDN as request URI. No indication of the desired media split is needed in the CS SETUP message 4-5 and the SIP INVITE 4-6 as the VCC AS already knows that media split is desired.<br>
In a practical implementation as the response 4-4 is sent reliably, the UE_A may need to answer it with a PRACK (provisional response acknowledgement) request (not shown in Figure 4). A benefit of sending the response reliably is that thereby the VCC AS can make sure, that the response 4-4 is received by the UE_A.<br>
The same way as in Figure 3, the VCC AS sends a Re-INVITE 3-7 to the UE__B after receiving both invites 3-3 and 4-6.<br>
A benefit achieved by the embodiment of Figure 4 is that the CS SETUP message does not need to be modified and no additional protocol elements are needed.<br>
As an alternative to the specific example of Figure 4 the CS SETUP may be sent first and the SIP INVITE 3-3 only after receiving confirmation that the CS SETUP<br><br>
14<br>
has been received. In this case an indication is needed in the CS SETUP message as discussed above with reference to Figure 3. That is, in this embodiment the response 4-4 is sent in response to the CS SETUP and the SIP INVITE 3-3 is sent in response to receiving the response 4-4.<br>
As a further alternative to the embodiments discussed above, it is possible that a separate "indication message" comprising an indication of that media splitting is desired is sent first and both of the transfer requests (of the circuit switched/voice part and the packet switched/other media part) are sent only after a confirmation of the receipt of the indication message. In this way no changes are needed for the known transfer requests.<br>
Such an indication message may be any suitable message. The indication comprised in the message may be, for example, an agreed bit pattern, which the application server knows to be an indication of that media splitting is desired. However as is evident to the skilled person, there are an infinite number of equivalent possibilities to implement such indication. The only requirement is that the application server needs to be able to recognize that the indication is an indication of that media splitting is desired. In some embodiments, a single bit in a field may suffice.<br>
The invention may be implemented for example by means of a computer program running on a suitable hardware platform or by means of any other suitable combination of hardware, software, special purpose circuits and/or logic.<br>
