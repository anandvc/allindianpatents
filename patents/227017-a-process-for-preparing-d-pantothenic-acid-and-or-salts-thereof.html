Preparation of D-pantothenic acid and/or salts thereof as additive to animal feedstuffs<br>
The present invention relates to an improved	process<br>
for preparing D-pantothenic acid and/or salts	thereof<br>
and  to  the  use  thereof  as  additive  to	animal<br>
feedstuffs.<br>
As a starting material of the biosynthesis of coenzyme A, D-pantothenate is widely distributed in the plant and animal kingdoms. In contrast to humans who consume sufficient quantities of pantothenic acid via the diet, symptoms of D-pantothenate deficiency are frequently described not only for plants but also for animals. The availability of D-pantothenate is therefore of great economic interest, particularly in the animal feed industry.<br>
Conventionally, D-pantothenate is prepared by chemical synthesis from D-pantolactone and calcium p-alaninate (Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 6"" edition, 1999, electronic release, chapter "Vitamins"). The preparation of D~pantolactone requires complex, classical racemate cleavage via dieastereomeric salts. The commercial product resulting from the chemical synthesis is usually the calcium salt of D-pantothenic acid, calcium D-pantothenate.<br>
Compared with chemical synthesis, the advantage of biotechnological production processes using microorganisms is the selective (enantiomerically pure) production of the D form of pantothenic acid, which can be used for higher organisms. A complex racemate cleavage, as required in chemical synthesis, is thus not necessary.<br>
Numerous   fermentation   processes   for   preparing D-pantothenic  acid  using  microorganisms  are  known.<br><br>
including in EP-0 590 857, WO 96/33283, US 6,013,492, WO 97/10340, DE 198 46 499, EP 1 001 027, EP 1 006 189, EP 1 006 192 and EP 1 006 193.<br>
Thus EP 1 006 189 and EP 1 001 027 describe processes for preparing pantothenate in which a content of at most 1 g/1 of D-pantothenic acid in the fermentation solution is achieved. Such low pantothenic acid contents in the fermentation solution, that is to say of less than 10% by weight, based on the solids content, are unsuitable, however, for economic preparation of D-pantothenic acid-containing animal feed supplements. A further disadvantage with the processes described to date is that isolating the product from the fermentation medium requires numerous complex work-up steps. An economic preparation process on the industrial scale is not known.<br>
German Laid Open Application DE 100 16 321 describes a fermentation process for preparing a D-pantothenic acid-containing animal feed supplement. However, an important disadvantage of this process, as with the above-described fermentation processes for preparing D-pantothenic acid, is that the ' pantothenic acid precursor ^-alanine must be supplied to the microorganism via the fermentation medium in order to obtain economic yields of the desired product.<br>
In addition, US 6,013,492 and WO 96/332839 describe working up the D-pantothenic acid from the fermentation solution by filtering off insoluble constituents (for example cell material) from the culture medium, adsorbing the filtrate to activated carbon, subsequently eluting the D-pantothenic acid with an organic solvent, preferably methanol, neutralizing with calcium hydroxide and subsequently crystallizing calcium D-pantothenate. Important disadvantages are the losses of valuable product occurring during crystallization and the use of an organic solvent which<br><br>
can only be removed with difficulty from the product and requires a complex solvent recovery step.<br>
EP 0 590 857 describes a fermentation process for preparing D-pantothenic acid in which culturing a microorganism requires the feeding of p-alanine. ^ The fermentation solution is filtered to separate off the biomass, then passed through a cation exchanger and then an anion exchanger, following this neutralizing with calcium hydroxide, concentrating by evaporation, adding activated carbon, filtering once more and crystallizing with addition of methanol and calcium chloride. The resultant calcium pantothenate-containing product, in addi.ion to D-pantothenic acid in the form of the calcium salt, also contains calcium chloride in a molar ratio of 1:1, Decreasing the calcium chloride content requires electrodialysis with subsequent spray drying. This process has the disadvantage of being neither economical or ecological because of the multiplicity of complex process steps and the use of organic solvents,<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an animal feed supplement containing D-pantothenic acid and/or salts thereof and its preparation by an improved process for preparing D-pantothenic acid and/or salts thereof which does not have . the abovementioned disadvantages. For economic reasons, a process is desirable here in which supplying ^-alanine is greatly decreased or is not required at all. In addition, preparing D-pantothenic acid in the form of its divalent salts and, especially, the alkaline earth metal salts, is desirable, since the divalent salts have less hygroscopic characteristics than monovalent salts of pantothenic acid and thus have a less pronounced trend to aggregation for further application, for example as animal feed supplement.<br>
We  have   found  that   this   object   is   achieved<br><br>
advantageously by the present invention.<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing D-pantothenic acid and/or salts thereof which comprises<br>
a)	using at least one organism which produces D-pantothenic acid and in which the biosynthesis of pantothenic acid (pan) and/or isoleucine/valine (ilv) is deregulated and which forms at least 2 g/1 of salts of D-pantothenic acid by fermentation in a culture medium, 0-20 g/1 of free P-alanine and/or P-alanine salt being supplied to the culture medium,<br>
b)	passing the D-pantothenate-containing fermentation solution through an anion exchanger,<br>
c) eluting the D-pantothenate bound to the anion exchanger in the form of calcium and/or magnesium D-pantothenate using a solution containing inorganic or organic calcium and/or magnesium salts, or eluting the bound D-pantothenate in the form of free D-pantothenic acid using an HCl solution,<br>
d)	optionally adding calcium base and/or magnesium base to set the free D-pantothenic acid-containing solution to a pH of 3-10, a solution being obtained which contains calcium and/or magnesium pantothenate and<br>
e)	subjecting the eluate or the solution containing calcium pantothenate and/or magnesium pantothenate to drying and/or formulation.<br>
In a variant of the inventive process, the present process is distinguished by the fact that in step d) , or step e) , a suspension is obtained or is charged<br><br>
which contains calcium pantothenate and/or magnesium pantothenate.<br>
The fermentation taking place in step a) can be carried out using procedures which are known per se in the batch, fed-batch or repeated fed-batch mode or continuously. The resultant pantothenic acid is neutralized in this case using conventional buffer systems, for example phosphate buffer containing NaOH, KOH or ammonia.<br>
In other variants of the inventive process, in step a) at  least  10  g/1,  preferably  at  least  20  g/1, particularly  preferably  at  least  40  g/1,   very particularly  preferably  at  least  60  g/1,  and  in particular at least 70 g/1, of salts of D-pantothenic acid are formed in the culture medium by fermentation.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, the form of words "producing" means that the organism can synthesize larger amounts of D-pantothenic acid and/or salts thereof than are required for its own metabolic needs. In an inventively advantageous variant, the amount of D-pantothenic acid and/or salts thereof synthesized is not present in the interior of the cell, but ideally is completely released into the culture medium by the organism. This discharge can be active or passive by means of mechanisms which are known per se.<br>
According to the invention the D-pantothenic acid-producing organisms used are microorganisms. These include according to the invention fungi, yeasts and/or bacteria. According to the invention, preference is given to using fungi, for example Mucor, or yeasts, for example Saccharomyces or Debaromyces, and of these, preferably, 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Advantageously, coryneform bacteria or Bacillaceae are used according to the invention. Those which are within the scope of the invention are preferably, for example, bacteria of<br><br>
the  genera  Corynebacterium,  Escherichia,  Bacillus, Arthrobacter,  Bevibacterium,  Pseudomonas,  Salmonella, Klebsiella,   Proteus,   Acinetobacter   or  Rhizobium. Particular preference is given here,  for example,  to Corynebacterium  glutamicum,  Brevibacterium  breve  or Bacillus   subtills,   B,   licheniformis,   B.   amylo-liquef aciens ,  B .  cereus ,, .B .  lentimorbus,  B .  lentus , B. firmus,    B.    pantothenticus,    B.    circulans, B, coagulans,     B.     megaterium,     B,     pumilus, B. thuringiensis, B. brevis, B. stearothermophilus and other  Bacillus  species  of  group  1  which  are characterized by their 16sRNA,  or Actinum mycetalis. This listing serves for explanation and is in no way limiting for the present invention.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention also comprises the use of genetically modified organisms for the inventive preparation of an animal feed supplement containing free D-pantothenic acid and/or salts thereof. Such genetically modified organisms can be isolated, for example, by chemical mutagenesis and subsequent selection using a suitable "screening process". According to the invention, what are termed "production strains" are also included which are suitable for preparing the product in the meaning of the present invention and have genetic modifications with respect to the metabolic flux in the direction of D-pantothenic acid, modifications with respect to the discharge of D-pantothenic acid and/or salts thereof via the cell membrane also being included. This can be achieved, for example, by modifications at key positions in relevant metabolic biosynthesis pathways of the organism used.<br>
It is also conceivable to use transgenic organisms which result from the transfer of homologous and/or heterologous nucleotide sequences which are necessary, or can be required, for synthesizing the desired product. In this case, overexpression and/or deregulation of one or more genes individually and/or<br><br>
in combination localized in the genome and/or on a vector are conceivable.<br>
Transgenic organisms of this type can, advantageously, contain additional copies and/or genetically modified genes selected from the group consisting of panB, panC, panD,  panE  and/or  combinations  thereof  and/or  even organization units how contain the panBCD operon.  In addition,  other metabolic pathways,  for example the isoleucine-valine biosynthesis pathway can be advantageously  manipulated  in  the  organisms,   as  is described, for example, in EP 1 006 189, EP 1 006 192, EP 1 006 193 or EP 1 001 027. As a result, branched-chain  precursor  substances  of  pantothenic   acid biosynthesis  are  increasingly being made available. Advantageously,  if  appropriate,  the  genes  for  this biosynthesis pathway, i.e. ilvB, ilvN, ilvC and/or ilvD are overexpressed.<br>
In addition, genetic modifications of aspartate a-decarboxylase (panD), for example through overexpression and/or deregulation, in the D-panto-thenic acid-producing organism used are covered by the invention.<br>
The word "deregulation", for the purposes of the present invention, means changing or modifying at least one gene which codes for one enzyme in a bio synthetic metabolic pathway, so that the activity of the enzyme is changed or modified in the microorganism. It is preferred that at least one gene which codes for one enzyme of a biosynthetic metabolic pathway is changed in such a manner that the gene product is formed to an increased extent, or has an increased activity. The term "deregulated metabolic pathway" also includes a biosynthetic metabolic pathway in which more than one gene, which codes more than one enzyme, is changed or modified in such a manner that the activities of more than one enzyme are changed or modified.<br>
Changes or modifications can include, but are not restricted  to:  removing  the  endogenous  promoter or<br><br>
regulatory elements; introducing strong promoters, inducible promoters or a plurality of promoters simultaneously; removing regulatory sequences, so that expression of the gene product is changed; changing the chromosomal position of the gene; changing the DNA sequence in the vicinity of the gene or within the gene, for example the ribosomal binding site (RBS); increasing the number of copies of the gene in the genome or by introducing.a varying number of copies of plasmids; modifying proteins (e.g. regulatory proteins, suppressors, enhancers, transcriptional activators and the like) , which play a role in the transcription of the gene and/or in the translation to give the gene product. This also includes all other possibilities for deregulating the 'expression of genes which belong to the prior art, for example the use of antisense oligonucleotides, or the blocking of repressor proteins.<br>
Deregulation can also comprise changes to the coding region of genes which lead, for example, to removing feedback regulation in the gene product or to a greater or lesser specific activity of the gene product.<br>
Furthermore, genetic modifications to enzymes are advantageous according to the invention which affect the efflux of precursors of pantothenic acid and/or the flux of pantothenic acid to give coenzyme A. Examples of genes coding for such enzymes are: alsD, avtA, ilvE, ansB, coaA, coaX, etc. This listing serves for explanation and is in no way limiting for the present invention.<br>
In addition, genetic modifications are advantageous which secure the cellular production of cofactors (e.g of methylene tetrahydrofolate, redox equivalents and the like) in an amount which is optimum for pantothenic acid production.<br>
Advantageously, thus, P-alanine is already present in the cells in increased concentrations compared with<br><br>
correspondingly non-genetically modified organisms, and thus need not be added to the culture medium as precursor, as is required, for example, in EP-A 0 590 857. Microorganisms are advantageous in which the biosynthesis of pantothenic acid (pan) and/or isoleucine-valine (ilv) and/or asparate-a-decarboxylase (panD) is deregulated. Furthermore, additional overexpression of ketopanthoate reductase (panE) in the microorganisms is advantageous.<br>
It is additionally advantageous according to the invention if, if appropriate, the coaA gene which is required for the synthesis of coenzyme A is decreased in its activity, or is entirely switched off (for example in Bacillus species). This is because Bacillus, in addition to coaA, contains a further gene for this enzymatic function {= coaX) . The activity of this gene coaX or the corresponding enzyme can also be changed, preferably reduced, or even deleted, provided that coaA itself still has sufficient enzyme activity, albeit reduced enzyme activity, that is to say the enzyme activity of coaA is not entirely lost. In addition to the overexpression of the various genes, genetic manipulation of the promoter regions of these genes is also advantageous provided that this manipulation leads to overexpression of the gene products.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the bacterial strains described according to the annex (PCT/US application 0025993), for example Bacillus subtilis PA 824 and/or derivatives thereof, are used. In a further embodiment, according to the invention the microorganism Bacillus subtilis PA 668, as described in the annex (US. serial no. 60/262,995), is used in the inventive process. These strains Bacillus subtilis PA 824 and PA 668 were produced as follows:<br>
Starting from the strain Bacillus   subtilis  168 (Marburg strain ATCC'6051), which has the genotype trpC2   (Trp') ,<br><br>
the strain PY79 was produced via transduction of the Trp"" marker (from the Bacillus subtilis wild type W23) . Classical genetic engineering methods (as described, for example, in Harwood, C.R. and Cutting, S.M. (editors), Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus (1990) John Wiley £c Sons, Ltd. , Chichester, England) introduced mutations ApanB and ApanEl into the strain PY79.<br>
The resultant strain was transformed using genomic DNA of Bacillus subtilis strain PA221 (genotype P26P'3nBCD, trpC2 (Trp") ) and genomic DNA of Bacillus subtilis strain PA303 (genotype P26panEl) . The resultant strain PA327 has the genotype P26panECD, P26P5nEI, and is a tryptophan auxotroph (Trp") , Pantothenic acid titers of up to 3.0 g/1 (24 h) were achieved using Bacillus subtilis strain PA327 in 10 ml cultures containing SVY medium (25 g/1 Difco Veal Infusion Broth, 5 g/1 Difco Yeast Extract, 5 g/1 of Na glutamate, 2.7 g/1 of ammonium sulfate charged into 74 0 ml of water, the mixture was au toe laved then 200 ml of 1 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.0 and 60 ml of 50% sterile glucose solution were added), which had been supplemented with 5 g/1 of.p-alanine and 5 g/1 of a-ketoisovalerate.<br>
The production of Bacillus subtilis strain PA221 (genotype P26PanBCD, trpC2 (Trp^) ) is described in the following section:<br>
Classic genetic engineering methods were used to clone the panBCD Operon of Bacillus, with the aid of the sequence information of the panBCD Operon of E. coli (see Merkel et al. , FEMS Microbiol. Lett., 143, 1996:247-2 52) starting from a Bacillus subtilis GP275 plasmid library. For the cloning, use was made of E. coli strain BM4062 (bir^^) and the information that the Bacillus operon is close to the birA gene. The panBCD operon was introduced into a plasmid which can be replicated in E. coli. To improve the expression of the panBCD operon, strong constitutive promoters of Bacillus   subtilis   phages SP0l (P26 ) were used, and the<br><br>
ribosome binding site (=RBS) before the panB gene was replaced by an artificial RBS, A DNA fragment which is immediately upstream of the native panB gene in Bacillus was ligated in front of the 'P26PanBCD cassette on the plasmid. This plasmid was transformed into Bacillus subtilis strain RL-1 (derivative of Bacillus subtilis 168 obtained by classical mutagenesis (Marburg strain ATCC 6051), genotype trpC2 (Trp") ) and, by homologous recombination, the native panBCD bperon was replaced by the p26PanBCD operon. The resultant strain is called PA221 and has the genotype P26PanBCD, trpC2 (Trp') ,<br>
A pantothenic acid titer of up to 0.92 g/1 (24 h) was achieved using the Bacillus subtilis strain PA221 in 10 ml cultures containing SVY medium which had been supplemented with 5 g/1 of p-alanine and 5 g/1 of a-ketoisovalerate.<br>
Production of the Bacillus subtilis strain PA303 (genotype P26P3-nEl) is described in the following section:<br>
Using the E. coli panE gene sequence, the Bacillus panE sequence was cloned by analogy. It was found that in B. subtilis f two homo logs of the E. coli panE gene exist which were termed panEl and panE2. Deletion analyses found that the panEl gene is responsible for 90% of the pantothenic acid production, while deleting the panE2 gene had no significant effect on pantothenic acid production. Here also, similarly to cloning the panBCD Operon, the promoter was replaced by the strong constitutive promoter P26 and the ribosome binding site in front of the panEl gene was replaced by the artificial binding site. The P2ePanEl fragment was cloned into a vector which was constructed so that the P26Pan3-nEl fragment could integrate into the original panEl locus in the Bacillus subtilis genome. The strain resulting after transformation and homologous recombination is termed PA3 03 and has the genotype P2 epanEI.   <br><br>
A pantothenic acid titer of up to 1.66 g/1 (24 h) was achieved using the Bacillus subtilis strain PA303 in 10 ml cultures containing SVY medium which had been supplemented with 5 g/1 of β-alanine and 5 g/1 of α-ketoisovalerate.<br>
The strain was further constructed by transforming PA32 7 with a plasmid which contained the F2eilvBNC Operon and the marker gene for spectinomycin. The P2eilvBNC operon integrated into the amyE locus, which was demonstrated by PCR. One transformant was termed PA340 (genotype P26PanBCD, P26panEI, P26ilvBNC, specR, trpC2   (Trp~) ) .<br>
A pantothenic acid titer of up to 3.6 g/1 (24 h) was achieved using the Bacillus subtilis strain PA340 in 10 ml cultures containing SVY medium which had been supplemented only with 5 g/1 of β-alanine; in 10 ml cultures containing SVY medium which had been supplemented with 5 g/1 of β-alanine and 5 g/1 of a-ketoisovalerate, a pantothenic acid titer of up to 4.1 g/1 (24 h) was achieved.<br>
In addition, a deregulated ilvD cassette was introduced into strain PA340. For this, a plasmid which contains the ilvD gene under the control of the P26 promoter containing the artificial RBS2 was transformed into PA340. The F26ilD gene was integrated into the original ilvD locus by homologous recombination. The resultant strain PA374 has the genotype P26PanBCD, P2epanEI, PieilvBNC, P2eilvD, specR and trpC2 (Trp') . A pantothenic acid titer of up to 2.99 g/1 (24 h) was achieved using the Bacillus subtilis strain PA374 in 10 ml cultures containing SVY medium which had been supplemented only with 5 g/1 of β-alanine.<br>
In order to produce pantothenic acid using strain PA374 without feed of β-alanine, additional copies of the gene panD coding for aspartate-α-decarboxylase were introduced into strain PA3 74. For this, chromosomal DNA<br><br>
of  strain  PA401 was  transformed  into  PA374.  Strain PA377 was obtained by selection on tetracycline. The resultant strain PA377 has the genotype P26panBCD, P26panE1,  P26ilvBNC,      p26ilvD,      specR;  tetR  and trpC2 (Trp") .<br>
A pantothenic acid titer of up to 1,31 g/1 (24 h) was achieved without feed of precursors using Bacillus subtilis strain PA377 in 10 ml cultures containing SVY medium.<br>
Preparation of Bacillus subtilis strain PA401 (genotype P26P5nD) is described in the following section: The Bacillus subtilis panD gene was cloned from the panBCD operon into a vector which carries the tetracycline marker gene. The promoter P26 and an above-described artificial RBS were cloned in front of the panD gene. Restriction digestion produced a fragment which contained the tetracycline marker gene and the P25panD gene. This fragment was religated and transformed into the above-described strain PA221. The fragment integrated into the genome of strain PA211. The resultant strain PA401 has the genotype PaePaanBCD, P26panD, tetR and trpC2   (Trp").<br>
A pantothenic acid titer of up to 0.3 g/1 (24 h) was achieved using the Bacillus subtilis strain PA401 in 10 ml cultures containing SVY medium which had been supplemented with 5 g/1 of α-ketoisovalerate. In 10 ml cultures containing SVY medium 'which had been supplemented with 5 g/1 of D-pantoic acid and 10 g/1 of L-aspartate, pantothenic acid titers of up to 2.2 g/1 (24 h) were achieved.<br>
Starting from strain PA377,  a tryptophan-prototrophic strain was generated by transformation with chromosomal DNA  from  strain  PY79.  This  strain  PA824  has  the genotype P26panBCD,    F2ePaniEl,    'P26ilBNC,    PaeilvD, specR, tetR and Trp"". A pantothenic acid titer of up to 4.9 g/1  (48 h)<br><br>
without supply of precursors was achieved using Bacillus subtilis strain PA824 in 10 ml cultures in SVY medium (comparison PA377: up to 3.6 g/1 in 48 h) .<br>
The preparation of PA668 is described in the following section;<br>
The Bacillus panB gene was cloned from the wild type panBCD operon and inserted into a vector which, in addition to a chloramphenicol resistance gene, also contains B. suhtilis sequences of the vpr locus. The strong constitutive promoter P26 was introduced before the 5' end of the panB gene. One fragment which contains the P26panB gene, the marker gene for chloramphenicol resistance and also Bacillus subtilis vpr sequences was obtained by restriction digestion. The isolated fragment was religated and used to transform strain PA824. The resultant strain was termed PA668. The genotype of PA668 is: P26panBCD, P26PanEI, P26ilvSi^C, F2eilvD,   P26panB, specR, tetR, CmR and Trp"".<br>
Two colonies of PA668 were isolated and termed PA668-2A, and the other PA668-24.<br>
Using B. subtilis    strain PA668-2A_ pantothenic  acid titers of  1.5 g/1 are achieved in 48  h in 10 ml cultures in SVY medium without supply of precursors. In 10 ml cultures supplemented with 10 g/1 of aspartate, titers up to 5 g/1 are achieved.<br>
Using B. subtilis    strain PA668-24,  pantothenic acid titers  of  1,8 g/1 are achieved in 48  h in 10 ml cultures in SVY medium without supply of precursors. In 10 ml cultures supplemented with 10 g/1 of L-aspartate, titers up to 4.9 g/1 are achieved.<br>
The exact construction of the strains is to be taken from the annexes (PCT/US application 0025993 and US serial no, 60/262,995).<br>
Using the above-described strain PA377, in glucose-limited fermentation in SVY medium (25 g/1 of Difco<br><br>
Veal Infusion Broth, 5 g/1 of Difco Yeast Extract, 5 g/1 of tryptophan, 5 g/1 of Na glutamate, 2 g/1 of (NH4)2SO4, 10 g/1 of KH2PO4, 20 g/1 of K2HPO4. 0.1 g/1 of CaCl2/ 1 g/1 MgSO4, 1 g/1 of  sodium citrate, 0.01 g/1 of FeSO4 • 7 H2O and 1 ml/1 of a trace salt solution of the following composition: 0.15 g of Na2MoO4 • 2 H2O, 2.5 g of H3BO3, 0.7 g of C0CI2 . 6 H2O, 0.25 g of CUSO4 • 5 H2O, 1.6 g of MnCl2'4 H2O, 0.3 g of ZnSO4 • 7 H2O, made up to 1 1 with water) ) on a 10 1 scale with continuous supply of a glucose solution, pantothenic acid concentrations in the fermentation broth of 18-19 g/1 122-25 g/1) are achieved in 36 h (48 h).<br>
In the case of glucose-limited fermentation of PA824, the tryptophan-prototroph derivative of PA377, in yeast extract medium (10 g/1 of Difco Yeast Extract, 5 g/1 of Na glutamate, 8, g/1 of (NH4) 2SO4, 10 g/1 of KH2PO4, 20 g/1 of K2HPO4, 0.1 g/1 of CaClo, 1 g/1 of MgSO4, 1 g/1 of sodium citrate, 0.01 g/1 of FeSO4"7 H2O and 1 ml/1 of the above-described trace salt solution) the following pantothenic acid concentrations in fermentation broths are achieved in 36 h, 48 h and 72 h: 20 g/1, 28 g/1 and 36 g/1, on a 10 1 scale with continuous supply of a glucose solution.<br>
By means of further optimization of media, using strain PA824  in  glucose-limited  fermentation  in  a  medium consisting of 10 g/1 of Difco Yeast Extract, 10 g/1 of NZ  amine  A  (Quest  International  GmbK,  Erftstadt), 10 g/1 of Na glutamate, 4 g/1 of (NH4)2SO4, 10 g/1 of KH2PO4,  20 g/1 of K2HPO4,  0.1 g/1 of CaCl2,  1 g/1 of MgSO4/ 1 g/1 of sodium citrate, 0.01 g/1 of FeSO4 • 7 H2O and 1 ml/1 of the above-described trace salt solution, pantothenic acid concentrations of 37 g/1 (48 g/1) are achieved in fermentation broths in 36 h (48 h) on a 10 1  scale  with  continuous  supply  of  a  glucose solution-Further increases in the pantothenic acid concentration in the fermentation broth are conceivable by further optimization of media, by increasing the fermentation<br><br>
time, by process and strain improvement and by combinations of the individual steps. Thus the above-described pantothenic acid concentrations are also achievable by fermentation of strains which are derivatives of the above-described PA824. Derivatives can be prepared by classical strain development and b]y' further genetic engineering manipulations. By development of media, strain and fermentation process, the pantothenic acid titers in the fermentation broths can be increased to greater than 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85 and &gt; 90 g/1.<br>
An essential advantage of the inventive process is that the fermentation is carried out in a culture medium which, apart from at least one carbon source and nitrogen source, contains no other precursors as starting compounds. That is to say the biosynthesis of D-pantothenic acid is independent of the supply of other precursors. For the purposes of the present invention, such precursors are substances such as β-alanine and/or L-aspartate and/or L-valine and/or a-ketoisovalerate and/or combinations thereof. In a preferred variant of the inventive process, the fermentation of the D-pantothenic-acid-producing organism is . carried out in a culture medium which contains a carbon source and a nitrogen source, but to which no free β-alanine and/or (5-alanine salts is/are added or supplied in the course of the fermentation. That is to say for producing D-pantothenic acid in ranges of at least 10 g/1 of culture medium, preferably at least 20 g/1, particularly preferably at least 4 0 g/1, very particularly preferably at least 60 g/1, and in particular at least 70 g/1, no supply of free β-alanine and/or β-alanine salts is required according to the invention.<br>
Independence from feed of precursors is in particular an important economic advantage of the inventive process compared with known processes, since a multiplicity of precursors are very expensive.<br><br>
However, the invention does not exclude addition of β-alanine and/or β-alanine salts, so that therefore the yield of D-pantothenic acid can be further increased by adding β-alanine and/or β-alanine salts. If it is assumed, for example, that all of the required precursors of pantothenic acid are present in a sufficient amount, only the activity of the panD gene limits a further increase in pantothenic acid production, then the yield of pantothenic acid can be increased, for example, by a further 50% by adding free β-alanine and/or β-alanine salts.<br>
In an advantageous variant of the present invention, up to 20 g/1 of free β-alanine and/or β-alanine salts can be added to the culture medium for additional increase in the pantothenic acid yield by more than 50%. Preference is given to adding about 15 g/1 of free β-alanine and/or β-alanine salts to the culture medium.<br>
Examples of carbon sources which are suitable according to  the  invention  for use  in a  culture medium for fermenting  the abovementioned organisms  are  sugars, such    as    starch   hydrolysates    (mono-,    di-, oligosaccharides) , preferably glucose or sucrose, and also beet or cane sugar molasses,  proteins,  protein hydrolysates,  soybean meal,  corn steep liquor,  fats, free  fatty acids,  recirculated cells  from previous fermentations or hydrolysates thereof, and also yeast extract. This listing is not limiting for the present invention.<br>
In addition, the present process is advantageously distinguished in that the total sugar content is reduced to a minimum up to the end of fermentation, since this would otherwise make difficult later drying and/or formulation of the fermentation solution owing to sticking. This can be achieved according to the invention by continuing the fermentation for some further time after the carbon source is consumed (in<br><br>
the case of batch culture) or after the carbon feed (in the case of a process procedure in the fed-batch or repeated fed-batch mode) is interrupted and/cr regulated in such a manner that the concentration of the carbon source is virtually zero (in the case of fed-batch, repeated fed-batch or continuous process procedure).<br>
This is achieved according to the invention by the means that, after interrupting the addition of the carbon source (for example sugar solution) , the fermentation is continued until the dissolved oxygen concentration {p02) of at least 80%, preferably 90%, and particularly preferably 95%, of the saturation value is achieved in the fermentation solution.<br>
Examples  of  nitrogen  sources  which  are	suitable<br>
according  to  the  invention  are  ammonia,	ammonium<br>
sulfate, urea, proteins, protein hydrolysates	or yeast<br>
extract. This listing also is not limiting	for the<br>
present invention.<br>
In addition, the fermentation medium contains mineral salts and/or trace elements, such as amino acids and vitamins. The exact compositions of suitable fermentation media are known in abundance and accessible to those skilled in the art.<br>
After the fermentation medium has been inoculated with a suitable D-pantothenic-acid-preducing organism (at the cell densities known to those skilled in the art) , if appropriate with addition of an antifoam, the organism is cultured. Any necessary regulation of the pH of the medium can be achieved using various inorganic or organic alkalis or acids, for example NaOH, KOH, ammonia, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, formic acid, succinic acid, citric acid or the like.<br>
On  account  of  the  buffer  systems  used  during<br><br>
fermentation, which, as described above, can be, for example, NaOH, KOH, ammonia, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, formic acid, succinic acid, citric acid or the like, the D-pantothenic acid formed is present in the fermentation solution, depending on the buffer system used, in the form of the respective salt(s). Since in this case, in particular, the salts of D-pantothenic acid in the form of their monovalent cations are disadvantageous, the fermentation solution is prepared according to the invention with the use of an anion exchanger.<br>
The present invention comprises here all commercially available anion exchangers. These include all strongly or weakly basic resins;  preference is given to the strongly basic resins. It is advantageous according to the invention to use the following anion exchangers, the  listing  serving  only  to  describe  the  present invention and not to limit it: Lewatit M500, MP 500 from Bayer, Amberlite IRA 402,  IRA 410,' IRA 900 from Rohm £c Haas, Dowex 1x2, 1x8 from Dow Chemicals, Diaion PA 306, PA 316, PA 406, PA412 or PA 418 from Mitsubishi Chemicals Corporation,  and Lewatit MP 62 from Bayer, MWA-1 from Dow Chemicals, Amberlite IRA 67,  IRA 96SB, IRA 96 RF, Duolite A561 or A7 from Rohm &amp; Haas, Reillex 402 from Reilly Industries, Diaion WA 21 or WA 30 from Mitsubishi Chemicals Corporation.<br>
Using the anion exchanger It bine the D-pantothenate and other anions from the fermentation solution!, while the remaining compounds, in particular monovalent cations, for example ammonium, potassium or sodium, pass through the anion exchanger and are then discarded. In this manner the unwanted cations are advantageously virtually completely removed from the fermentation solution.<br>
The D-pantothenate bound to the anion exchanger is then eluted in the form of calcium and/or magnesium D-pantothenate by a solution containing- inorganic or<br><br>
organic calcium and/or magnesium salts, or is eluted in the form of free D-pantothenic acid by an HCl solution. According to the invention the salts can be acidic and/or basic inorganic and/or organic calcium salts and/or magnesi-um salts. For instance, in a variant of the inventive process of the present invention, it is conceivable to elute the D-pantothenate bound to the anion exchanger by a solution containing acidic inorganic and/or organic calcium salts and/or magnesium salts. Likewise, a variant is conceivable in which the elution solution in step c) contains inorganic and/or organic calcium bases and/or magnesium bases. The basic calcium salts and/or magnesium salts can be present instead of, or in addition to, the acidic calcium salts and/or magnesium salts. In further variants of the present invention, the elution solution in step c) of the inventive process can contain inorganic calcium salts and/or magnesium salts, acidic organic calcium salts and/or magnesium salts, in organic calcium bases and/or magnesium bases and/or organic calcium bases and/or magnesium bases and corresponding combinations thereof.<br>
Advantageously,  . for  the  purposes  of  the  present invention,  inorganic calcium salts and/or magnesium salts  are  the  corresponding  halides.  Preferably, according to the invention,  these are CaCl2 and/or MgCl2.  Examples  of  inorganic  calcium  bases  and/or magnesium  bases  are  calcium  hydroxide,   calcium carbonate,  calcium  oxide,  magnesium  hydroxide  or magnesium carbonate. For the purposes of the present invention, the organic calcium salts and/or magnesium salts are, for example, highly water-soluble salts of organic anions.  Preferably,  these are,  for example, calcium and/or magnesium formate, acetate, propionate, glycinate and/or lactate.<br>
In  a  variant  of   the  present   invention,   the D-pantothenate bound to the anion exchanger is eluted<br><br>
with a 5-10% strength CaCl2 solution, MgCl2 solution or aqueous  HCl  solution,   the  eluate  containing  a D-pantothenate in the form of calcium or magnesium D-pantothenate, or as free D-pantothenic acid. If  the  elution  is  performed  with  an  aqueous  HCl solution, the free D-pantothenic-acid-containing eluate is adjusted to a pH of 3-10 by adding calcium base and/or magnesium base. A pH of 5-10 is advantageous. Preferably,  the solution is adjusted to a pH of 5-9, particularly  preferably  6-9,  and  very  particularly preferably 6-8. In this manner a.solution is obtained which contains calcium pantothenate and/or magnesium pantothenate.<br>
After adding calcium base and/or magnesium base to adjust the pH of the eluate containing free D-pantothenic acid, according to the invention a suspension can also be obtained which contains calcium pantothenate and/or magnesium pantothenate.<br>
Preferably, for neutralization, calcium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, calcium oxide, magnesium hydroxide and/or basic magnesium carbonate is added to the eluate containing free D-pantothenic acid in the form of a solid and/or as aqueous suspension.<br>
It is preferred according to the invention in this case if the eluate containing free D-pantothenic acid is neutralized with a calcium base and/or magnesium base in the form of an aqueous suspension. As a result of using such an aqueous suspension the neutralization is performed more rapidly and without relatively ' large pH fluctuations than is the case when a corresponding solid is used.<br>
According to the invention the process is distinguished in that an aqueous suspension comprising 2-5 5% by weight, preferably 10-50% by weight, and particularly preferably 20-40% by weight, of calcium hydroxide is added to the eluate optionally in step d).<br><br>
The invention additionally comprises a process in which an aqueous suspension comprising 2-65% by weight, preferably 10-50% by weight, and particularly preferably 20-40% by weight, of calcium carbonate is added to the eluate optionally in step d). In a further embodiment of the present invention, an aqueous suspension comprising 2-60% by weight, preferably 10-50% by weight, and particularly preferably 20-40% by weight, of magnesium hydroxide is added to the eluate optionally in step d) of the inventive process. The invention also comprises a process in which an aqueous suspension comprising 2-25% by weight, preferably 10-20% by weight, of basic magnesium carbonate is added to the eluate optionally in step d),<br>
In the eluate or the solution or the suspension containing calcium D-pantothenate and/or magnesium D-pantothenate resulting from steps c) or d) of the inventive process, in a manner described above, by using an anion exchanger, the content of monovalent cations, preferably ammonium, potassium and/or soditim ions, is decreased to a concentration of 
The eluate or the solution or suspension containing calcium and/or magnesium pantothenate is dried and/or formulated using processes known per se,  for example spray drying, spray granulation, fluidized-bed drying, fluidized-bed granulation,  drum drying or spin-flash drying (Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 6*^^ edition, 1999, electronic release, chapter "Drying of Solid Materials") .  The gas inlet temperature in convection drying is in the range 100-280°C, preferably 12 0-210°C.  The gas  outlet  temperature  is  50-180°C, preferably 60-150^C. To establish a desired particle size   distribution   and   the   associated   product properties,  fine particles can be separated off and recirculated.  In  addition,  course  material  can  be ground in a mill and likewise then recirculated.<br><br>
According to the invention, in the process described above, the reduction of complex workup steps is advantageous, in particular the avoidance of the use of organic solvents, with simultaneous production of a desired product having high biological value. In addition, according to the invention the amount of waste water produced is significantly reduced. This thus results in further savings in complex work up and disposal plants. Thus the inventive process is advantageously distinguished in that it is simpler, less susceptible to faults, less time-consuming, markedly less expensive and thus more economical than conventional processes.<br>
However, this does not exclude the inventive process from being able to be varied. The inventive process steps a) to d) mentioned at the outset can be supplemented by one or more of the following process steps which are themselves familiar to those skilled in the art. In this case, all conceivable combinations of the additional process steps with the process steps a) to e) are covered by the invention.<br>
Thus the solutions or suspensions resulting from- the process steps a) - d) can be disinfected, for example by heating (sterilization) or other methods, for example pasteurization or sterile filtration.<br>
In other variants of the inventive process, before the drying and/or formulation of the solution or suspension, at least one of and/or combinations of the fallowing steps can be carried out, comprising lysis and/or sterilizing the biomass and/or separating off the biomass from the fermentation solution and/or adding further additives and/or concentrating the fermentation solution, preferably by removing water.<br>
The present invention thus also relates to a process in<br><br>
which the lysis and/or sterilization of the biomass is carried out still in the fermentation solution or not until after the biomass is separated off from the fermentation solution. This can be performed, for example, by a temperature treatment, preferably at 80-2OC^C, and/or an acid treatment, preferably with sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid, and/or enzymatically, preferably with lysozyme.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, the cells of the fermented microorganisms can be removed by filtration, separation (for example centrifugation) and/or decantation from the solutions or suspensions of the steps a), c) or d) of the inventive process. It is also conceivable that the solution from step a) are passed directly through an anion exchanger without separating off the organisms present.<br>
If the biomass is not separated off before the workup step via anion exchangers (step b) ) of the inventive process, the biomass-containing fermentation solution can also advantageously be passed through the ion-exchange bed from bottom to top, that is to say in the opposite direction to gravity.<br>
The solution resulting from the work up via the anion exchanger can, optionally following neutralization, be concentrated via a suitable, evaporator, for example falling-film evaporator, thin-film evaporator or rotary evaporator. Such evaporators are manufactured, for example, by the companies GIG (4800 Attnang Puchheim, Austria) , GEA Canzier (52303 Diiren, Germany) , Diessel (31103 Hildesheim, Germany) and Pitton (3 5274 Kirchhain, Germany).<br>
To improve the color properties of the end product, an additional filtration step can be carried out in which a little activated carbon is added to the solutions or suspensions obtained during the process and the resultant  suspension  is  then  filtered.  Or,   the<br><br>
solutions obtained during the fermentation can be passed through a small activated carbon bed. The amounts of activated carbon used which are required for this are in the range of a few % by weight of the solution and are within the knowledge and experience of those skilled in the art.<br>
These filtrations can be simplified by adding a commercial flocculating aid to the respective solution or suspension before filtration (for example Sedipur CF 902 or Sedipur CL 930 from BASF AG, Ludwigshafen),<br>
In an advantageous embodiment of the present invention, the fermentation output (fermentation broth) is sterilized by heating and is then freed from the cell mass by centrifugation, filtration or decantation. After addition of 50-1000 mg/kg, preferably 100-200 mg/kg, of a commercially conventional flocculating aid, based on the fermentation output, the mixture is filtered through a short bed of activated carbon and sand in order to obtain a biomass-free solution having a high D-pantothenic acid content. This treated solution is then passed through the ion-exchange bed.<br>
If the biomass is not separated off before the inventive workup step via an anion exchanger, the biomass-containing fermentation solution advantageously can also be passed through the ion-exchange bed from bottom to top, that is to say in the opposite direction to gravity. This procedure is generally advantageous if suspended matter is present in the solution or suspension to be purified.<br>
This solution or suspension can then be dried, for example by spray drying. This can be performed in cocurrent, countercurrent or mixed flow. For the atomization, all known atomizers can be used, in particular centrifugal atomizers (atomizer disk), single-fluid nozzle or two-fluid nozzle. Preferred drying temperature conditions are 150-250°C tower inlet<br><br>
temperature  and  7 0-13 0 C  tower  exit	temperature.<br>
However,  drying can also be performed	at higher or<br>
lower  temperature  levels.  To  achieve	a  very  low<br>
residual moisture, a further drying	step can be<br>
provided downstream in a fluidized bed.<br>
The spray drying may also be carried out in an FSD or SBD dryer (FSD: fluidized spray dryer; SBD: spray bed dryer) , as are manufactured by the companies Niro (Copenhagen, Denmark) and APV-Anhydro (Copenhagen, Denmark), which are a combination of spray dryer and fluidized bed.<br>
In the spray drying an antleaking agent can be added. This can reduce the deposition on the dryer wall and improve the flow behavior, precisely in the case of fine-grained powders. Antleaking agents which can be used are, in particular, silicates, stearates, phosphates and corn starch.<br>
In principle the drying can also take place in a sprayed fluidized bed, in which case this can be operated not only continuously but also batchwise. The solution or suspension can be sprayed in not only from the top (top spray) and from the bottom (bottom spray) but also from the side (side spray).<br>
The present invention further relates to a composition for use as animal feed additive and/or animal feed supplement, in which case it can be prepared by<br>
a)	using at least one organism which produces D-<br>
pantothenic acid and in which the biosynthesis of<br>
pantothenic acid  (pan)  and/or  isoleucine/valine<br>
(ilv) is deregulated and which forms at least 2 g/1 of salts of D-pantothenic acid by fermentation in a culture medium, 0-2 0 g/1, preferably 0 g/1, of free β-alanine and/or β-alanine salt being supplied to the culture medium,<br>
b)	passing the D-pantothenate-containing fermentation<br><br>
solution through an anion exchanger,<br>
c)	the D-pantothenate bound to the anion exchanger is eluted in the form of calcium and/or magnesium D-pantothenate using a solution containing inorganic or organic calcium salts and/or magnesium salts, or is eluted in the form of free D-pantothenic acid using an HCl solution,<br>
d)	optionally adding calcium base and/or magnesium base to set the free D-pantothenic acid-containing eluate to a pH of 3-10, a solution being obtained which contains calcium and/or magnesium pantothenate acid and<br>
e)	subjecting the eluate or the solution containing calcium pantothenate and/or magnesium pantothenate to a drying and/or formulation.<br>
In a variant of the present invention, in step c) , an elution solution can be used which contains acidic inorganic and/or organic calcium and/or magnesium salts and/or basic inorganic and/or organic calcium and/or magnesium salts.<br>
In a further variant of the present invention, in step d) or in step e) , a suspension can be obtained or charged which contains calcium pantothenate and/or magnesium pantothenate and results in the inventive composition after the further processing.<br>
According to the invention the composition is distinguished in that it comprises salts of D-pantothenic acid at a concentration of at least 1-100% by weight, preferably at least 2 0-100% by weight, and particularly preferably at least 50% by weight. The present invention relates to a composition which comprises salts of D-pantothenic acid in the form of   divalent  cations,   preferably  calcium  and/or<br><br>
magnesium D-pantothenate. According to the invention preference is given to a composition which is distinguished in that the content of salts of D-pantothenic acid in the form of monovalent cations is 
According to the invention by means of the above-described process a calcium D-pantothenate and/or magnesium D-pantothenate is obtained which meets the requirements for a feed additive. These requirements are, for example, a relatively high content of D-pantothenate and a high compatibility with the target organism and biological value in the meaning of "vitamin activity" of the inventive product.<br>
The present invention will be described in more detail by the following examples, which are not, however, limiting for the invention:<br>
Example 1:<br>
In a laboratory fermenter containing stirrer and gas-introduction device of 14 1 capacity, aqueous fermentation medium of the following composition is charged:<br><br><br>
The trace salt solution has the following composition:<br>
0.15 g of Na2MoO4 • 2 H2O, 2.5 g of H3BO3, 0.7 g of C0CI2 ■ 6 H2O, 0.25 g of CUSO4 • 5 H2O, 1.6 g of MnCl2 .4 H2O, 0.3 g of ZnSO4 • 7 H2O are made up to 1 1 with water. The trace salt solution is added via sterile filtration. The initial liquid volume is 6 1. The contents set forth above are based on this value.<br>
To this solution are added 60 ml of inoculation culture (OD = 10 )of Bacillus subtilis PA824 and the suspension is fermented at 43°C with vigorous stirring at a gas introduction rate of 12 1/min. This strain is described in accordance with the annex in PCT/US Application 0025993.<br>
Within the course of 47 h, 6.5 1 of a sterile aqueous<br><br>
solution are added, the composition of which is as follows:<br><br>
The fermentation is carried out under glucose-limiting conditions. During the fermentation the pH is regulated to 7.2 by adding 25% strength ammonia solution or 20% strength phosphoric acid. Ammonia serves simultaneously as nitrogen source for the fermentation. The speed of rotation of the agitator element is controlled to keep the dissolved oxygen content to 30% of the saturation value. After halting the addition of the carbon source, the fermentation is continued until the dissolved oxygen content (PO2) has reached a value of 95% of the saturation value. The fermentation is then ended and the organism is thermally destroyed. For this the fermentation solution is sterilized for 45 min. Successful destruction is demonstrating by plating out.<br>
The cells are then separated off by centrifugation. After cell separation the concentration of D-pantothenate after 48 h is 22.8 g/1.<br>
Similarly,  fermentation broths may also be produced which have β-alanine-feed-free pantothenic acid titers of greater than 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85 and &gt; 90 g/1.<br>
1000 ml of the fermentation broth are pumped from bottom to top through a 250 ml glass column in which are situated approximately 100 ml of the strongly basic ion exchanger Lewatit MP 500 (in the OH' form) . The flow rate is approximately 2 0 ml/min. The column is then washed at the same pumping rate with approximately<br><br>
1000 ml of deionized water. This solution contains cations in the form of NH4 , Ca2+, K+, Mg2+ and Na+ ions. The D-pantothenic acid bound to the ion exchanger is then eluted using approximately 1000 ml of a 10% strength calcium chloride solution. The eluate contains pantothenic acid in the form of calcium D-pantothenate, sulfate and phosphate ions of differing valencies. A 75 ml sample of the resultant calcium D-pantothenate solution was then dried by evaporating off the water on a rotary evaporator and 4.8 g of a light-brown calcium D-pantothenate powder are obtained which has a content of 3 5% calcium D-pantothenate. This powder has no tendency to stick together and has good product properties.<br>
Example 2:<br>
In a laboratory fermenter containing stirrer and gas-introduction device of 14 1 capacity, aqueous fermentation medium of the following composition is charged:<br><br>
After sterilization, the following sterile media components are additionally added:<br><br><br>
The trace salt solution has the following composition:<br>
0.15 g of Na2MoO4 ■ 2 H2O, 2.5 g of H3BO3, 0.7 g of C0CI2 - 6 H2O, 0.25 g of CUSO4 • 5 H2O, 1.6 g of MnCl2 • 4H2O, 0.3 g of ZnSO4 • 7 H2O are made up to 1 1 with water. The trace salt solution is added via sterile filtration. The initial liquid volume is 5.5 1. The contents set forth above are based on this value.<br>
To this solution are added 55 ml of inoculation culture (OD = 10) of Bacillus subtilis PA82 4 and the suspension is fermented at 43°C with vigorous stirring at a gas introduction rate of 12 1/min. This strain is described in accordance with the annex in PCT/US Application 0025993.<br>
Within the course of 48 h, 6 1 of a sterile aqueous solution are added, the composition of which is as follows:<br><br>
The fermentation is carried out under glucose-limiting conditions. During the fermentation the pH was regulated to about 7.2 by adding 25% strength ammonia<br><br>
solution or 20% strength phosphoric acid. Ammonia serves simultaneously as nitrogen source for the fermentation. The speed of rotation, of the agitator element is controlled to keep the dissolved oxygen content to 3 0% of the saturation value. After halting the addition of the carbon source, the fermentation ir&gt; continued until the dissolved oxygen content (PO2) has reached a value of 95% of the saturation value. The fermentation is then ended and the organism is thermally destroyed. For this the fermentation solution is sterilized for 30 min. Successful destruction is demonstrating by plating out.<br>
The cells are then separated off by centrifugation. After cell separation the concentration of D-pantothenate on stopping after 48 h is 24.1 g/1.<br>
Similarly,  fermentation broths may also be produced which have β-alanine-feed-free pantothenic acid titers of greater than 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85 and &gt; 90 g/1.<br>
