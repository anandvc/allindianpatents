				<td>ANTIMONY-FREE PHOTOGURABLE RESIN COMPOSITION AND THREE DIMENSIONAL ARTICLE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a low viscosity photocurable composition comprising (i) a cationically curable component (ii) a free radically active component (iii) an antimony-tree cationic photoinitiator and optionally (iv) a free radical photoinitiator and (v) optionally a toughening agent and its use in producing three-dimensional articles via rapid prototyping techniques.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Liquid-based Solid Imaging, for example, Stereolithography, is a process whereby a photoformable liquid is applied as a thin layer to a surface and exposed to actinic radiation such that the liquid solidifies. Subsequently, new thin layers of photoformable liquids are coated onto previous layers of liquid or previously solidified sections. The new layers are then exposed imagewise in order to solidify portions imagewise and in order to induce adhesion between portions of the new hardened region and portions of the previously hardened region. Each imagewise exposure is of a shape that relates to a pertinent cross-section of a photohardened object such that when all the layers have been coated and all the exposures have been completed, an integral photohardened object can be removed from the surrounding liquid composition.<br>
Photoformable resins currently used in generating the photohardened object generally contain a cationically polymerizable compound, such as an epoxy compound, and/or a radically polymerizable compound, such as an acrylate, together with cationic and/or radical photoinitiators. For example, JP 02075618A discloses a photocurable resin containing an epoxy, an acrylate, and an antimony-containing cationic photoinitiator and free radical photoinitiator.<br>
Antimony is a toxic heavy metal and its presence in photohardened parts makes resins containing antimony less useful in many applications.   In addition, because of their high<br><br>
reactivity, antimony hexafluoride salts are prone to instability and cause viscosity build-up in the resin over time. Removal of the cationically polymerizable compound so that the composition contains only radically polymerizable compounds is not an adequate solution since these resins produce objects having a much greater distortion due to acrylate shrinkage as well as insufficient green strength and brittleness. Adding stabilizers to the resin composition is also not an adequate solution since the stabilizers are consumed over time and must be continuously added to the resin in order to maintain a low viscosity.<br>
Therefore, it would be desirable to produce a low viscosity, stable, antimony-free photocurable composition which can be cured rapidly in a liquid-based solid imaging process to produce an article having a high green strength, toughness, dimensional accuracy and niinimal distortion.<br>
Asahi Denka described the composition of hybrid epoxy acrylate formulations for laser imaging (JP 02075618A). This document teaches that cycloaliphatic epoxy resins combined with triaryl sulfonium antimony hexafluoride are the preferred epoxy-cationic initiator systems in optical molding systems. Commercial resins since this patent have used this same cationic initator as well as one or more other features of this patent. Subsequent patent disclosures have also focused on formulations using the antimony salt. The current disclosure shows surprisingly that certain formulations can now be developed which do not use the antimony hexafluoride salt.<br>
Huntsman WO 03/089991 A2 describes SL resins containing reactive core shell particles, producing parts with smooth surfaces and good mechanical properties. In this patent, Huntsman uses triaryl sulfonium antimony hexafluoride salt as the cationic initiator. Reactive particles are stable and do not phase separate. In the current disclosure, formulations containing such reactive particules which, combined with a cationic photoinitiator that does not contain antimony hexafluoride, provide parts with improved and more balanced mechanical properties.<br>
WO 03/093901 Al describes the use of hydrogenated epoxy components in combinaison with oxetane components to give resins with "good water resistance".<br><br>
The current invention uses non-antimony containing initiator salts and describes novel compositions with broad range of acrylic content. Preferably, it was found that formulations with greater than 25% acrylate content, using cationic initiator that do not contain antimony hexafiuoride, yields surprisingly good overall properties.<br>
US2005/0228064 Al describes the use of tougheners.<br>
US 6,811,937 describe use of low MW polyTHF with specific acrylates to obtain high clarity. Dipentaerythritol hexaacrylate is used, whereas we demonstrated a similar improvement using dipentaerythritol pentaacrylate in our PF6 formulation. Preferably, in the compositions according to the invention, the free radically active component does not comprise dipentaerythritol hexaacrylate.<br>
US 6,379,866 describe the use of a reactive toughener made of a single reactive toughener.<br>
WO 2005/045525 describe the use of nanoparticules.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a low viscosity photocurable composition containing about 35-80% by weight of a cationically curable component, about 5-60% by weight of a free radically active component, about 0.1-10% by weight of an antimony-free cationic photoinitiator, 0-10% by weight of a free radical photoinitiator, 0-40% by weight of a toughening agent and one or more optional components, where the percent by weight is based on the total weight of the photocurable composition.<br>
The photocurable composition can be rapidly cured by forming a layer of the composition on a substrate or surface and exposing the layer imagewise to actinic radiation of sufficient intensity to cause substantial curing of the layer in the exposed areas so that an imaged cross-section is formed. A second layer of the photocurable composition may then be formed on the prior imaged cross-section and exposed to actinic radiation of sufficient intensity to cause substantial curing of the second layer and to cause adhesion to the prior imaged cross-section. This may be repeated a sufficient number of times for the purpose of building up a dimensionally accurate three-dimensional article which can be used in various applications.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to photocurable compositions containing a cationically curable component, a free radically active component, an antimony-free cationic photoinitiator and optionally a free radical photoinitiator, toughening agent and one or more other optional components. It has been surprisingly found that when these components are combined, a low viscosity, non-toxic photocurable composition can be produced which, under rapid laser curing, can produce a three dimensional article having an excellent balance of green strength, toughness, flexibility, dimensional accuracy, durability, improved water resistance, improved color stability, improved transparency, improved cured and non-cured stability, room humidity resistance and strength with the term "three- dimensional article" referring to an article made from at least two layers of the cured resin composition. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed the antimony-free cationic photoinitiator generates active cationically curable components via different kinetics as compared to those generated by antimony photoinitiators. Upon curing, the active cationically curable components generated by the antimony-free photoinitiator also follow a different cure process resulting in less residual stress in the cured article to therefore produce an article exhibiting reduced brittleness and more toughness.<br>
The invention permits to answer to several technical problems:<br>
1/ presence of heavy metals<br>
The commercially available SL resins based on hybrid acrylate/epoxy chemistry use a cationic photoinitiator containing antimony salts. Cationic photinitiators containing antimony salts are more reactive and have been used in SL formulations for many years. The presence of the toxic heavy metal makes them less useful for many applications. Phophorous salts are less reactive, and substituted in current formulations do not allow the formation of solid parts of sufficient strength through the stereolithography process.<br>
A solution is to use a sulfonium PF6 salt instead of the SbF6 salt. However, simply switching from the SbF6 salt to the PF6 salt in existing formulations does not work: green strength is extremely low and parts cannot be built through the  stereolithography process.  The<br><br>
formulation has to be modified in order to compensate for the lower speed of the PF6 salt. This disclosure describes surprising formulations that can provide high green strength while using a cationic photoinitiator containing no antimony salt. Additionally, it was found that the parts may have improved mechanical properties as compared to the currently available SL resins using antimony salt.<br>
2/ viscosity instability<br>
The very reactive antimony hexafluoride salts are also responsible for viscosity instability in the bath of resin. From the very process of stereolithography, the resin is regularly subjected to low levels of UV-irradiations that triggers photodecomposition of the photoinitiator and produces small amounts of active species. The cationic photoinitiator containing antimony salt is especially known to be prone to unstability, due to its higher reactivity. Several attempts have been made to stabilise the formulations by adding various types of low basicity compounds. In its literature, Dow Chemicals, supplier of both salts, specifies that formulations containing PF6 salts are more stable in time than formulations containing SbF6 salts.<br>
Several attempts have been made to answer the viscosity stability issues:<br>
US 5665792 (Du Pont de Nemours), describes the use of stabilisers having a limited solubilited in the formulation. They are present as a solid phase in the formulation in excess of their solubility limit. The concentration of the stabiliser is continuously replenished as the stabiliser reacts with undesired free acid.<br>
US 6 099 787 (Ciba Specialty chemicals) teaches the use of an organic viscosity stabiliser for filled SL resins.<br>
US 5 783 358 (Ciba Specialty chemicals) teaches the use of a basic ion exchanger brought into contact with the liquid radiation-curable composition, at least for a certain time.The ion exchanger is preferrably removed before commencement of the radiation curing.<br>
WO 03/104296 (Vantico AG), teaches the use of a boron-amine trichloride complex as a stabiliser of actinic radiation-curable compositions<br>
However, in these prior attempts, once the original amount of stabiliser has been consumed, viscosity starts to increase.<br><br>
3/ improved tougheness and flexibility<br>
SbF6 salts and PF6 salts generate the active species with different kinetics. The subsequent polymerisation of the epoxy species also follows a different cure process. It is the belief of the inventors that the different cure process induced by the PF6 salt results in less residual stress in the cured parts thus produces parts with reduced brittleness and better tougheness.<br>
US 5 476 748 (Ciba-Geigy Corporation) teaches the use of OH-terminated polyether, polyester, polyurethane to improve mechanical properties, especially elongation at break. I.e., addition of these polyols reduce brittleness<br>
US 6 413 697 (Vantico AT&amp;T US), teaches the use of cationically reactive modifiers and polyols to increase the flexibility and toughness of the cured articles.<br>
US 6379866 (from DSM) teaches the use of polyols and reactive tougheners to obtain flexible parts simulating the look and feel of polypropylene articles.<br>
All 3 aspects (presence of heavy metals, viscosity instability and desired improvement of mechanical properties) may be improved in the formulations described in this disclosure. The formulations disclosed here contain:<br>
A]	40 to 80% of a cationically component resin<br>
B]	5-60% of one or more acrylate component of functionality 2, or more<br>
C]	0-15% of one or more acrylate component of functionality &gt; 2. Preferred<br>
multifunctional acrylate will be a hyperbranched (dentritic) polyester acrylate. (such<br>
as CN2301 from Sartomer)<br>
D]	0-30% of the cationic component is an oxetane<br>
E]	optionally 0 to 40% of one or more toughening agent. This toughening agent can<br>
be a component containing one or more hydroxyl group or a reactive particule<br>
comprising a cross-linked polysiloxane core and a shell of reactive groups on the<br>
outer of the core, wherein the reactive group comprises epoxy groups, ethylenically<br>
unsaturated groups or hydroxyl groups.<br>
F]	0.1-10% of a free-radical photoinitiator<br><br>
G] 0.1-10% of a cationic photoinitiator that contains no antimony salts<br>
Cationically Curable Component<br>
As a first essential component, the photocurable composition of the present invention includes from about 35-80% by weight, based on the total weight of the photocurable composition, of a cationically curable component. The cationically curable component includes at least one cationically curable compound characterized by having functional groups capable of reacting via or as a result of a ring-opening mechanism initiated by cations to form a polymeric network. Examples of such functional groups include oxirane-(epoxide), oxetane-, tetrahydrofuran- and lactone-rings in the compound. Such compounds may have an aliphatic, aromatic, cycloaliphatic, araliphatic or heterocyclic structure and they may contain the ring groups as side groups, or the functional group can form part of an alicyclic or heterocyclic ring system. The cationically curable compound may be difunctional, trifunctional or may contain more than three cationically curable groups. The cationically curable component may include a single liquid cationically curable compound, a combination of liquid cationically curable compounds, or a combination of one or more liquid cationically curable compounds and one or more solid cationically curable compounds which are soluble in the liquid.<br>
In one embodiment, the cationically curable compound is an epoxy-containing compound. In general, any epoxy-containing compound is suitable for the present invention, such as the epoxy-containing compounds disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,476,748 which is incorporated herein by reference. Examples of epoxy-containing compounds include polyglycidyl epoxy compounds, non-glycidyl epoxy compounds, epoxy cresol novolac and epoxy phenol novolac compounds.<br>
The polyglycidyl epoxy compound may be a polyglycidyl ether, poly(P-methylglycidyl) ether, polyglycidyl ester or poly(P-methylglycidyl) ester. The synthesis and examples of polyglycidyl ethers, poly(P-methylglycidyl) ethers, polyglycidyl esters and poly(|3-methylglycidyl) esters are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,972,563, which is incorporated herein by reference. For example, ethers may be obtained by reacting a compound having at least one free alcoholic hydroxyl group and/or phenolic hydroxyl group with a suitably substituted epichlorohydrin under alkaline conditions or in the presence of an acidic catalyst followed by<br><br>
alkali treatment. The alcohols may be, for example, acyclic alcohols, such as ethylene glycol,<br>
diethylene glycol and higher poly(oxyethylene) glycols, propane-1,2-diol, or<br>
poly(oxypropylene) glycols, propane-l,3-diol, butane-1,4-diol, poly(oxytetramethylene)<br>
glycols, pentane-l,5-diol, hexane-l,6-diol, hexane-2,4,6-triol, glycerol, 1,1,1-<br>
trimethylolpropane, bistrimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol and sorbitol. Suitable glycidyl<br>
ethers may also be obtained, however, from cycloaliphatic alcohols, such as 1,3- or 1,4-<br>
dihydroxycyclohexane,	bis(4-hydroxycyclo-hexyl)methane,	2,2-bis(4-<br>
hydroxycyclohexyl)propane or l,l-bis(hydroxymethyl)cyclohex-3-ene, or they may possess aromatic rings, such as N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)aniline or p,p'-bis(2-hydroxyethylamino)diphenylmethane.<br>
Particularly important representatives of polyglycidyl ethers or poly(P-methylglycidyl) ethers are based on monocyclic phenols, for example, on resorcinol or hydroquinone, on polycyclic phenols, for example, on bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)methane (Bisphenol F), 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane (Bisphenol A), bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)S (Bisphenol S), alkoxylated Bisphenol A, F or S, triol extended Bisphenol A, F or S, brominated Bisphenol A, F or S, hydrogenated Bisphenol A, F or S, glycidyl ethers of phenols and phenols with pendant groups or chains, on condensation products, obtained under acidic conditions, of phenols or cresols with formaldehyde, such as phenol novolaks and cresol novolaks, or on siloxane diglycidyls.<br>
Polyglycidyl esters and poly(P-methylglycidyl) esters may be produced by reacting epichlorohydrin or glycerol dichlorohydrin or P-methylepichlorohydrin with a polycarboxylic acid compound. The reaction is expediently carried out in the presence of bases. The polycarboxylic acid compounds may be, for example, glutaric acid, adipic acid, pimelic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid or dimerized or trimerized linoleic acid. Likewise, however, it is also possible to employ cycloaliphatic polycarboxylic acids, for example tetrahydrophthalic acid, 4-methyltetrahydrophthalic acid, hexahydrophthalic acid or 4-methylhexahydrophthalic acid. It is also possible to use aromatic polycarboxylic acids such as, for example, phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, trimellitic acid or pyromellitic acid, or else carboxyl-terminated adducts, for example of trimellitic acid and polyols, for example glycerol or 2,2-bis(4-hydroxycyclohexyl)propane, may be used.<br><br>
In another embodiment, the epoxy-containing compound is a non-glycidyl epoxy compound. Non-glycidyl epoxy compounds may be linear, branched, or cyclic in structure. For example, there may be included one or more epoxide compounds in which the epoxide groups form part of an alicyclic or heterocyclic ring system. Others include an epoxy-containing compound with at least one epoxycyclohexyl group that is bonded directly or indirectly to a group containing at least one silicon atom. Examples are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,639,413, which is incorporated herein by reference. Still others include epoxides which contain one or more cyclohexene oxide groups and epoxides which contain one or more cyclopentene oxide groups.<br>
Particularly suitable non-glycidyl epoxy compound's include the following difunctional non-<br>
glycidyl epoxide compounds in which the epoxide groups form part of an alicyclic or<br>
heterocyclic        ring        system:        bis(2,3-epoxycyclopentyl)        ether,	l,2-bis(2,3-<br>
epoxycyclopentyloxy)ethane,	3,4-epoxycyclohexyl-methyl	3,4-<br>

dicyclopentadiene diepoxide or 2-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl-5,5-spiro-3,4-epoxy)cyclohexane-1,3-dioxane, and 2,2'-bis-(3,4-epoxy-cyclohexyl)-propane.<br>
Highly preferred difunctional non-glycidyl epoxies include cycloaliphatic difunctional non-<br>
glycidyl epoxies, such as 3,4-epoxycyclohexyl-methyl 3',4'-epoxycyclohexanecarboxylate<br>
and 2,2'-bis-(3,4-epoxy-cyclohexyl)-propane, with the former being most preferred.<br>
In another embodiment, the cationically curable compound is a poly(N-glycidyl) compound<br>
or poly(S-glycidyl) compound. Poly(N-glycidyl) compounds are obtainable, for example, by<br>
dehydrochlorination of the reaction products of epichlorohydrin with amines containing at<br>
least two amine hydrogen atoms. These amines may be, for example, n-butylamine, aniline,<br>
toluidine,	m-xylylenediamine,	bis(4-aminopbenyl)methane	or	bis(4-<br>
methylaminophenyl)methane. Other examples of poly(N-glycidyl) compounds include N,N'-diglycidyl derivatives of cycloalkyleneureas, such as ethyleneurea or 1,3-propyleneurea, and N,N'-diglycidyl derivatives of hydantoins, such as of 5,5-dimethylhydantoin.   Examples of<br><br>
poly(S-glycidyl) compounds are di-S-glycidyl derivatives derived from dithiols, for example ethane-1,2-dithiol or bis(4-mercaptomethylphenyl) ether.<br>
It is also possible to employ epoxy-containing compounds in which the 1,2-epoxide groups are attached to different heteroatoms or functional groups. Examples of these compounds include the N,N,0-triglycidyl derivative of 4-aminophenol, the glycidyl ether/glycidyl ester of salicylic acid, N-glycidyl-N'-(2-glycidyloxypropyl)-5,5-dimethylhydantoin or 2-glycidyloxy-1,3 -bis(5,5 -dimethyl-1 -glycidylhydantoin-3 -yl)propane.<br>
Other epoxide derivatives may be employed, such as vinyl cyclohexene dioxide, limonene dioxide, limonene monoxide, vinyl cyclohexene monoxide, 3,4-epoxycyclohexlmethyl acrylate, 3,4-epoxy-6-methyl cyclohexylmethyl 9,10-epoxystearate, and l,2-bis(2,3-epoxy-2-methylpropoxy)ethane.<br>
Also conceivable is the use of liquid pre-reacted adducts of epoxy-containing compounds, such as those mentioned above, with hardeners for epoxy resins. It is of course also possible to use liquid mixtures of liquid or solid epoxy resins in the novel compositions.

If used, the stabilizers may constitute from about 6.601% to about 5% by weight based on the total weight of the photocurable composition.<br>
Fillers, including inorganic or organic, powdered, flaky or fibrous materials, may also be added. Examples of inorganic fillers include mica, glass or silica, calcium carbonate, barium sulfate, talc, glass or silica bubbles, zirconium silicate, iron oxides, glass fiber, asbestos, diatomaceous earth, dolomite, powdered metals, titanium oxides, pulp powder, kaoline, modified kaolin, hydrated kaolin metallic fillers, ceramics and composites.

Examples include methacryloxy propyl trimethoxy silane, beta-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl)ethyl trimethoxy silane, gamma-glycidoxy propyl trimethoxy silane and methyl triethoxy silane. Mixtures of inorganic and organic fillers may also be used.<br>
Further examples of preferred fillers are micro crystalline silica, crystalline silica, amorphous silica, alkali alumino silicate, feldspar, woolastonite, alumina, aluminum hydroxide, glass powder, alumina trihydrate, surface treated alumina trihydrate, and alumina silicate. Each of the preferred fillers is commercially available. The most preferred filler materials are inorganic fillers, such as mica, Imsil, Novasite, amorphous silica, feldspar, and alumina trihydrate. These fillers preferably are transparent to UV light, have a low tendency to refract or reflect incident light and provide good dimensional stability and heat resistance. Nano fillers, such as exfoliated clays (nano clays), nano mica, aluminum borate whiskers, nano barium sulphate (Nanofine, available from Solvay), silica nanoparticules dispersed in UV-curable monomers (Nanopox and Nanocryl range of materials from Nanoresins), alumina<br><br>
nanoparticules dispersed in UV-curable monomers (Nanobyk from Byk Chemie) may also be used.<br>
The filler and nanofiller to be used for the resin composition for stereolithography according to the present invention must also satisfy the requirements that it doesn't hinder cationic or radical polymerizations and the filled SL composition must have a relatively low viscosity suitable for the stereolithography process. The fillers and nariofillers may be used alone or as a mixture of two or more fillers depending upon the desired performance. The fillers and nanofillers used in the present invention may be neutral, acidic or basic, with slightly basic being preferred. The filler particle size may vary depending on the application and the desired resin characteristics. It may vary between 50 nanometers and 50 micrometers. The nanofillers particle size may vary between 3 and 500 nanometers. Dispersants may be used to ensure good dispersion of these nanofillers.<br>
If present, the content of fillers in the photocurable composition may generally be about 0.5% by weight to about 30% by weight based on the total weight of the photocurable composition. The photocurable compositions of the present invention can be prepared in a known manner, for example, by premixing individual components and then mixing these premixes, or by mixing all of the components together using customary devices, such as stirred vessels. In one embodiment, the mixing is carried out in the absence of light and, if desired, at slightly elevated temperatures ranging from about 30°C to about 60°C. Furthermore, it is desirable for the photocurable composition to possess a viscosity at 25°C in the range of 50-1000 cps, preferably 70-700 cps.<br>
In one embodiment, the photocurable composition of the present invention is prepared by mixing from about 35-80% by weight of the cationically curable component, from about 15-60% by weight of the free radically active component, from about 0.1-10% by weight of the antimony-free cationic photoinitiator, from 0-10% by weight of the free radical photoinitiator, and from 0-40% by weight of the toughening agent where the % by weight is based on the total weight of the photocurable composition. In another embodiment, the photocurable composition is produced by mixing from about 45-70% by weight of the cationically curable component comprising a hydrogenated bisphenol epoxy-containing compound and an oxetane compound, greater than 25% by weight to about 40% by weight of the free radically active component comprising at least one poly(meth)acrylate having a<br><br>
functionality of 2, from about 0.5-8% by weight of the antimony-free cationic photomitiator, from about 0.5-4% by weight of the free radical photomitiator, and from 0-40%, preferably from about 0.01-40% by weight of the toughening agent where the % by weight is based on the total weight of the photocurable composition.<br>
The novel photocurable compositions can be polymerized by irradiation with actinic light, for example by means of electron beams, X-rays, UV or VIS light, preferably with radiation in the wavelength range of 280-650 nm. Particularly suitable are laser beams of HeCd, argon ion or riitrogen and also metal vapour and NdYAG lasers. This invention is extended throughout the various types of lasers existing or under development that are to be used for the solid imaging (stereolithography) process, e.g. solid state, argon ion lasers, etc, as well as to non-laser based irradiations . The person skilled in the art is aware that it is necessary, for each chosen light source, to select the appropriate photomitiator and, if appropriate, to carry out sensitization. It has been recognized that the depth of penetration of the radiation into the composition to be polymerized, and also the operating rate, are directly proportional to the absorption coefficient and to the concentration of the photomitiator. In stereolithography it is preferred to employ those photoinitiators which give rise to the highest number of forming free radicals or cationic particles and which enable the greatest depth of penetration of the radiation into the compositions which are to be polymerized.<br>
It is preferred that the photocurable compositions of the present invention, upon polymerization by irradiation, produce an article having a green strength at 10 minutes of at least 100 MPa. It is also preferable that the photocurable compositions, after 1.5 hours of postcure in a postcure apparatus, produce a photohardened article having at least one of the following properties:<br>
(i)       a flexural modulus in the range of between 1000-2300 MPa;<br>
(ii)       an average elongation at break of at least 5%;<br>
(iii)      a tensile strength of at least 30 MPa;<br>
(iv)      the liquid photcomposition used to fabricate the article has a viscosity of less than 500 cps;<br>
(v)       a notched izod impact of at least 0.5 ft. lbs/in; and/or<br>
(vi)      an ash content of less than 0.05%.<br><br>
Therefore, a further aspect of the present invention includes a process for producing an antimony-free three-dimensional article in sequential cross-sectional layers in accordance with a model of the article by forming a first layer of the photocurable composition; exposing the first layer to actinic radiation in a pattern corresponding to a respective cross-sectional layer of the model sufficient to harden the first layer in the imaged area; forming a second layer of the photocurable composition above the hardened first layer; exposing the second layer to actinic radiation in a pattern corresponding to a respective cross-sectional layer of the model sufficient to harden the second layer in the imaged area; and repeating the previous two steps to form successive layers as desired to form the antimony-free three-dimensional article which can be used in various applications, for example, the aerospace industry and the investment casting industry, or for medical applications.<br>
In principle, any stereolithography machine may be used to carry out the inventive method. Stereolithography equipment is commercially available from various manufacturers. Table I lists examples of commercial stereolithography equipment available from 3D Systems Corp. (Valencia, Calif.).<br>
TABLE 1<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br><br>
Most preferably, the stereolithography process for producing a three-dimensional article from the photocurable composition of the present invention includes preparing the surface of the composition to form the first layer and then recoating the first layer and each successive layer of the three-dimensional article with a Zephyr™ recoater (3D Systems Corp., Valencia, Calif.), or an equivalent thereof.<br>
It would be desirable to produce a low viscosity, stable, antimony-free photocurable composition which can be cured rapidly in a liquid-based solid imaging process to produce an<br><br>
article for use in medical applications having a high green strength, toughness, dimensional accuracy and niinimal distortion.<br>
The present invention relates to photocurable compositions containing a cationically curable component, a free radically active component, an antimony-free cationic photomitiator and optionally a free radical photomitiator, toughening agent and one or more other optional components. It has been surprisingly found that when these components are combined, a low viscosity non-toxic photocurable composition is produced which, under rapid laser curing, produces a three-dimensional medical article having an excellent balance of green strength, toughness, flexibility, dimensional accuracy, durability, improved water resistance, improved color stability, improved transparency, improved cured and non-cured stability, room humidity resistance and strength with the term "three-dimensional medical article" referring to a medical article made from at least two layers of the cured resin composition. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed the antimony-free cationic photomitiator generates active cationically curable components via different kinetics as compared to those generated by antimony photoinitiators. Upon curing, the active cationically curable components produced by the antimony-free photomitiator also follow a different cure process resulting in less residual stress in the cured article to produce an article exhibiting reduced brittleness and more toughness. Because the medical article is produced from a non-toxic photocurable composition free from any heavy metal-containing component, it may be used in medical applications. Thus, the medical article may be, for example, a medical device, a medical model and/or a medical implant, successfully meeting the requirements of USP 28, NF 23, for the biological tests of plastics, class VI, 70°C. As used herein, a "medical device' refers to any physical item used in medical treatment and may include a catheter, a stent, a fluid administration system, a drug delivery system, a chemotherapy tip, a syringe, a cardio-vascular device, a vascular access device, a surgical instrument, for example, an ergonomic surgical instrument, or a component part for medical equipment.<br>
As used herein, a "medical model" refers to a three-dimensional article produced from two-dimensional data, such as, CAT scan and MRI data, which can be used for surgical planning, prosthesis design and as a teaching aid. Examples include models of an organ, such as a liver, heart, lung, kidney, bladder, brain, eye, intestines, pancreas and reproductive organ; a<br><br>
bone, such as a skull, jaw, spine, ribs, collarbone, shoulder blade, humerus, radius, ulna, teeth, finger and hand bones, breast bone, femur, tibia and fibula; a joint, such as ball and socket joints for the hip and shoulder and hinge joints such as the knee and elbow; teeth; and, tissue such as tumors, muscle and cartilage.<br>
As used herein, a "medical implant" refers to a device that is fabricated for the purpose of embedding, or placing, within a body. Types of implants include implants suitable for the replacement, repair, support or modification of joints (such as those described above), bones (such as those described above), teeth, tissue (such as those described above) and the like. The present invention also provides a process for producing a three-dimensional medical article comprising the steps of forming a first layer of the photocurable composition of the present invention on a surface; exposing the layer imagewise to actinic radiation to form an imaged cross-section, wherein the radiation is of sufficient intensity to cause substantial curing of the layer in the exposed areas; forming a second layer of the photocurable composition on the previously exposed imaged cross-section; exposing the second layer from the previous step imagewise to actinic radiation to form an additional imaged cross-section, wherein the radiation is of sufficient intensity to cause substantial curing of the second layer in the exposed areas and to cause adhesion to the previously exposed imaged cross-section; and repeating a sufficient number of times in order to build up the three-dimensional medical article.<br>
Although the photocurable composition of the present invention is preferably used in a stereolithography process, it may also be used in three-dimensional jet printing or other rapid prototyping techniques to produce a three dimensional article.<br>
In jet printing, successive droplets of the photocurable composition are applied (e.g. using an ink jet print head such as a piezoelectric jet printing head) at targeted locations on a substrate and irradiated by exposing the droplets to electromagnetic radiation to cure the composition and build up a three dimensional article of a desired shape. The droplets are deposited in accordance with the desired shape which is stored in axomputer file, for example a CAD file. The substrate may include paper, textiles, tiles, printing plates, wallpaper, plastic, or paste. The photocurable composition may be irradiated pixel by pixel, line by line, layer by layer, and/or after several layers have been formed, and/or after all layers have been formed.  The<br><br>
electromagnetic radiation employed may be UV light, microwave radiation, visible light, laser beams, or other similar sources.<br>
Alternatively, it is possible to deposit the photocurable composition of the present invention onto a powder. The powder may be spread as a thin layer onto the substrate and the photocurable composition jet deposited onto the powder at desired locations in a desired pattern. The pattern may then be cured by exposing the photocurable composition to UV light. A further layer of powder may then be placed on top of the first layer and the process repeated to build up the three dimensional article. Any uncured powder may be removed after the three dimensional article has been built. A final heat and/or radiation cure may be provided for the three dimensional article after the non-cured powder is removed. The photocurable composition is therefore fully integrated with the powder. In another embodiment, the powder contains a reactive component that can react either with the photocurable composition or is facilitated by the photocurable composition to react with itself. The powder may contain organometallic polymers, oligomers, or monomers. Examples include polyacrylic acid, poly(acrylonitrile-co-butadiene, poly(allylamine), polyacrylic resins with functional acrylate groups, polybutadiene, epoxy functionalized butadienes, poly(glycidyl(meth)acrylate), poly THF, polycaprolactone diols, HEMA, HEA, maleic anhydride polymers such as styrene-maleic anhydride, polyvinylbutryals, polyvinyl alcohol, poly(4-vinylphenol), copolymers/blends of these compounds, and any of these compounds ehdcapped with epoxy, vinyl ether, acrylate/methacrylate, hydroxy, amine or vinyl moieties. The powder may further contain organic or inorganic fillers, a pigment, nanoparticles, a dye, and/or a surfactant.<br>
In one embodiment, the three dimensional article produced from the photocurable composition of the present invention is used as a foundry pattern in investment casting. In investment casting, a disposable foundry pattern produced from the photocurable composition of the present invention is used to produce a mold in which parts can be cast. The mold is built up around the foundry pattern by a well known process the details of which differ depending upon the type of metal to be cast in the mold. In general, and using the casting of ferrous alloys to illustrate the investment casting process, the foundry pattern is coated with, i.e., invested in, a refractory slurry, for example an aqueous ceramic slurry, which is drained of excess water to form a coating, and the coating is then stuccoed with fine<br><br>
ceramic sand. This step is usually repeated several times (10 to 20 layers are not uncommon) after the first coating is dry. The invested foundry pattern is then placed in an open ended metal container which is filled with a coarse slurry of ceramic back-up material which hardens. The foundry pattern which is invested in the ceramic is then placed into a furnace or autoclave causing the foundry pattern to be melted or burned out of the resulting mold. Removal of the foundry pattern leaves a cavity in the mold corresponding in shape and dimension to the final part, although the foundry pattern (and therefore the cavity) can be slightly larger to compensate for shrinkage or machining of the part which is produced by the subsequent casting operation. Molten metal is introduced into the mold cavity and solidified by cooling. After solidification, the ceramic mold is broken away to release the finished part. While metal castings are primarily contemplated, any liquid material which solidifies may be cast in this manner, e.g., plastic or ceramic compositions.<br>
Because the photocurable composition of the present invention is antimony-free, sensitive alloys can be cast in molds produced by the stereolithographically-made foundry pattern. Furthermore, complex foundry patterns can be accurately produced. Finally, it has been found that the foundry patterns have a low ash content (
Other applications where the photocurable composition of the present invention may be used<br>
include: as an adhesive, as a coating, for example, a photoimageable coating, such as a<br>
&gt;<br>
photoresist, or a coating for optical fibers, as a sealant for light emitting diodes, or in paints, inks or varnishes or any other application, process or method where a shelf-stable photocurable composition having stable mechanical properties on curing is desired.<br>
EXAMPLES A The general procedure used for preparing three-dimensional articles with stereolithography equipment is as follows. The photocurable composition is placed in a vat designed for use with the stereolithography equipment at about 30°C. The surface of the composition, either in its entirety or in accordance with a predetermined pattern, is irradiated with a ITV7VIS light source so that a layer of a desired thickness is cured and solidified in the irradiated area. A new layer of the photocurable composition is formed on the solidified layer. The new layer is likewise irradiated over the entire surface or in a predetermined pattern. The newly solidified<br><br>
layer adheres to the underlying solidified layer. The layer formation step and the irradiation step are repeated until a green model of multiple solidified layers is produced. A "green model" is a three-dimensional article initially formed by the stereolithography process of layering and photocuring, where typically the layers are not completely cured. This permits successive layers to better adhere by bonding together when further cured. "Green strength" is a general term for mechanical performance properties of a green model, including modulus, strain, strength, hardness, and layer-to-layer adhesion. For example, green strength may be reported by measuring flexural modulus (ASTM D 790). An article having low green strength may deform under its own weight, or may sag or collapse during curing.<br>
The green model is then washed in tripropylene glycol monomethyl ether ("TPM") and subsequently rinsed with water and dried with compressed air. The dried green model is next postcured with UV radiation in a postcure apparatus ("PCA") for about 60-90 minutes. "Postcuring" is the process of reacting the green model to further cure the partially cured layers. A green model may be postcured by exposure to heat, actinic radiation, or both. Tables A-II-VI list the components of each photocurable composition labeled as Examples A1-A23 and Comparative Example Al. The numbers in Tables AII-A VI refer to the weight percent of each component based on the total weight of the photocurable composition. Table A VII provides further identifying information for the trade names in Tables AII-A VI.<br>
TABLE AII<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Examples A1-A23 and Comparative Example Al were prepared by combining the components and mixing at room temperature until the mixture was a homogeneous photocurable composition. As shown below in Table A VIII, the photocurable compositions according to the present invention have a viscosity suitable for photofabrication:<br>
TABLE A VIII<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Three dimensional articles were then prepared from the photocurable compositions on a<br>
stereolithography machine. Examples A1-A20 and Comparative Example Al were prepared<br>
on an SLA350 machine while Examples A21-A23 were prepared on an SLA7000 machine.<br>
The articles, having a layer thickness of 0.1 mm, were built using a depth of penetration<br>
ranging from about 4.8-7.3 mil and a critical energy ranging from about 6.3-25.5 mJ/cm2. All<br>
articles generated by photocurable compositions according to the present invention had a<br>
green strength ranging from about 137-1337 MPa at 10 minutes and 243-1900 MPa at 60<br>
minutes. In comparison, the article produced by a commercially available resin according to<br>
Comparative Example Al had a green strength of 25 MPa at 10 minutes which did not<br>
increase with time.   However, when the resin according to Comparative Example Al was<br>
prepared using an antimony-containing cationic photoinitiator in place of the antimony-free<br>
photoinitiator, the article produced had a green strength of 50 MPa at 10 minutes which further increased to 150 MPA after 60 minutes. Thus, replacing commercially available photocurable resins containing an antimony cationic photoinitiator with an antimony-free cationic photoinitiator will not produce a buildable resin due to low green strength. The green strengths of the articles are summarized in Table A DC below:<br>

Mechanical properties of the articles were measured using a United Testing Systems Tensile Tester. Specifications for the United Tensile Testing Tester are as follows:<br>
Pre-Test Speed	5 mm/min<br>
Pre-Load	0.05 kg<br>
Test Speed	5 mm/min<br>
Maximum Load	500 lbs<br>
Extensiometer	1 inch<br>
"Pre-Test Speed" is the rate at which the three-dimensional article is pulled taut before the testing begins.<br>
"Pre-Load" is the amount of force that is applied to the three-dimensional article (at the Pre-Test Speed) before the testing begins.<br>
"Test Speed" is the rate at which the three-dimensional article is pulled apart during the test process.<br>
"Maximum Load" is the maximum amount of force that the United Testing Systems Tensile Tester can use when testing a specimen.<br>
"Extensiometer" is a device that grips the three-dimensional article between two teeth having a distance between the teeth of one inch.   A spring on the extensiometer measures the distance to which the three-dimensional article is stretched. The results are shown below in Tables A X-A XIV:<br>

The low viscosity photocurable composition of the present invention can produce cured products with minimal change in mechanical properties and deformation rate over time, high dimensional accuracy and green strength, and excellent mechanical strength, heat resistance, moisture resistance and water resistance. The cured product is therefore suitable for use as a three-dimensional article, such as for example, a trial product for mechanical parts.

The viscosity of several of the photocurable compositions was determined at 25° or 30° C using a Brookfield viscometer and the results are presented in Table B VII:<br>

Test models were then produced from the photocurable compositions on either a 3D Systems SLA 350 or 7000 stereolithography machine or using silicon molds. When using silicon molds, the liquid resin is cast in the mold and solidified under actinic radiation for 1 hour. Comparative Examples Bl and 4B and Examples B2, B3, B5, Bll and B14-B26 were prepared on an SLA 350 machine while Examples B3 and B6-B13 were prepared on an SLA 7000 machine. The photosensitivity of Examples B3 and B6-B13 was determined on a SLA 7000 machine.<br>
The photosensitivity was determined on "window panes" by measuring the layer thickness of single layer test specimens produced at different laser energies. The layer thickness was then plotted against the logarithm of the applied irradiation energy to produce a working curve. The slope of this curve was then determined to provide the depth of penetration (Dp, in mils). The energy value (Ec, in mJ/cm ), or the point at which the working curve passes through the x-axis was also determined. The Ec is the energy at which gelling of the material takes place<br>
as described in P. Jacobs, Rapid Prototyping and Manufacturing, Soc. Of Manufacturing<br>
Engineers, 1992, p. 270, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The green strength was determined by measuring the flexural modulus, at 1 mm deflexion, 10<br>
minutes and 60 minutes after the models were produced.   The glass transition temperature<br>
(Tg) was determined using dynamic mechanical analysis.  Water resistance was determined<br>
be immersing the models in water at room temperature and determining the retained, flexural<br>
modulus after 1 week.<br>
Other physical properties of fully cured test models (postcured in a PCA oven for 90 minutes)<br>
were determined according to the following standard ASTM and ISO procedures which are<br>
herein incorporated by reference:<br>

Comparative Example Bl (which is similar to a commercially available photocurable composition) and Example B2 above demonstrate that simply substituting an antimony cationic photoinitiator with an antimony-free photoinitiator produces an article having insufficient green strength. Furthermore, Example B3 demonstrates the improved impact resistance that is achieved from cured articles produced from the photocurable composition of the present invention as compared to Comparative Example B4. Moreover, Examples B3 and B5 demonstrate that the photocurable compositions of the present invention are much more stable since the DSC exotherm peak (which indicates thermal stability of the mixture) for these compositions is much higher than DSC exotherm peak for the composition containing antimony (i.e. Comparative Example B4).<br><br>

The viscosity of the photocurable composition and a commercially available acrylate-<br>
containing photocurable composition (hereinafter referred to as "Comparative Example C")<br>
were determined at 30° C using a Brookfield viscometer.  Test models were then produced<br>
from the photocurable compositions of Example CI and Comparative Example C on an SLA<br>
7000 stereolithography machine. The test models were conditioned for 3-5 days at 23°C and<br>
50% RH before mechanical testing.<br>
The photosensitivity of the photocurable compositions was determined as explained in<br>
Examples B description.<br>
Other physical properties of fully cured test were determined according to ISO standards<br>
explained in Examples B.<br><br>
TABLE C IV<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br><br>
The results above demonstrate that the viscosity of Example CI is much lower than Comparative Example C (which is similar to a commercially available acrylate-containing photocurable composition). Furthermore, the results demonstrate the improved impact resistance in the test model produced from the photocurable composition of Example CI as compared to Comparative Example C. The Example CI test model is therefore much less brittle than the test model of Comparative Example. Finally, the accuracy of the test model produced from the photocurable composition of Example CI is much improved when compared to the test model produced from the photocurable composition of Comparative Example C as demonstrated by the ten-fold reduction in the curl distortion.<br>
EXAMPLES D<br>
The formulations indicated in the examples D are prepared by mixing the components, with a stirrer at room temperature, until a homogeneous composition is obtained. The physical data relating to the formulations are obtained as described below.<br>
Test specimens have been manufactured using either SLA350 (examples D5 to D13) or SLA7000 (examples D1-D4, D32-D37) machines, both from 3D Systems, or cured in a mold at room temperature in a UV-oven for lh 30 min (examples D14-D31).<br>
After fabrication in the SLA machines, specimens are cleaned using isopropanol, dried, and post-cured in a 3D-Systems Post-Curing Apparatus (PCA) for lh 30 min to allow full cure of the resin. Test specimens are conditionned for 3-5 days at 23°C, 50%RH before mechanical testing.<br>
Mechanical testing of fully cured parts is being done according to ISO or ASTM standards. Examples D1-D4, D32-D37 have been tested according to ISO standards. Examples D5-D13 have been tested according to ASTM standards.<br>
