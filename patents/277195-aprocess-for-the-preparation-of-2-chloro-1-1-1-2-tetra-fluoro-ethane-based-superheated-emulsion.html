				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of 2-chloro-1,1,1,2-tetra fluoro-ethane based superheated emulsion, wherein the emulsion has applications such as neutron detector, refrigerant and fire extinguishant.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Neutrons are difficult to detect because, being uncharged elementary particles they do not ionize matter as they pass through it. It is, therefore, necessary to rely upon some other form of physical reaction to indicate the presence of neutrons. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are widely used as neutron detectors, apart from neutron detection they have many unique properties. They are low in toxicity, non flammable, non corrosive and compatible with other materials. In addition they offer the thermodynamic and physical properties that make them ideal for a Variety of uses. CFGs have been used as refrigerant in the manufacture of insulation, packaging and cushioning foams; as cleaning agents for metal and electronic components; and in many other applications. Superheated emulsion detectors for neutron detection consist of superheated drops of R-12 or R-114 or R-12 + R-114 refrigerants suspended in a gel or polymer matrix. When neutron interacts with the droplet, it converts into bubble. Number of bubbles formed are co-related to neutron dose.<br>
A superheated emulsion, known in the art, is based on freonl2 and freonl2+ freonl 14 suspended in a gel or polymer matrix.<br>
The disadvantage of the above emulsion is that the polymer gel matrix used for suspension is a chlorofluoro compound which causes depletion of earth's protective ozone layer.<br>
Another disadvantage of the known emulsion is that it's shelf life is only 3 months.<br>
A neutron detector as described in US Patent No. 5334840, utilizes a material enriched with boron nitride in Boron - 10, which emits light when acted upon by thermal neutrons.<br>
The limitation of the above method is that it requires an elaborate equipment for neutron detection and hence can not be used as a personal neutron dosimeter.<br>
Another neutron detector (US Patent No. 5973328) mark use of fissionable material like lithium, uranium, thorium, plutonium and neptunium incorporated in a sol-gel glass medium.<br>
The disadvantage of this neutron detector is that it requires fissionable material which is not easily available.<br>
Another disadvantage of the above neutron datector is that the set up required for netron detection is very cumbersome.<br>
OBJECTS OF PRESENT INVENTIN<br>
The main object of the present invention is to propose a process for the preparation of 2-chloro-l,l,l,2-tetra fluoro-ethane based superheated emulsion which is a highly sensitive neutron sensor for personal neutron dosimetry.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a process for preparation of 2-chloro-l,l,l,2-tetra fluoro-ethane based superheated emulsion which has 300 times less ozone depletion potential.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to propose a process for preparation of 2-chloro-l,l,l,2-tetra fluoro-ethane based superheated emulsion which is relatively less sensitive to ambient temperature.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to propose a process for preparation of 2-chloro-l,l,l,2-tetra fluoro-ethane based superheated emulsion which has higher shelf life of more than 6 months.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to propose a 2-chloro-l,l,l,2-tetra fluoro-ethane based superheated emulsion wherein the viscosity of the polyacrylamide gel is optimised so that the size of bubbles formed on detection of neutron is small to increase the neutron detection range.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to propose a 2-chloro-l, 1,1,2-tetra fluoro-ethane based superheated emulsion wherein the 2-chloro-l, 1,1,2-tetra fluoro-ethane based superheated emulsion wherein the bubbles formed on detection of neutron are trapped at site only.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Acording to this invention there is provided a process for the preparation of 2-chloro-l, 1,1,2-tetra fluoro-ethane based superheared emulsion comprising in the steps of&gt;<br>
(a)	preparing a polymer by mixing acrylamide solution with initiator such as solution of ammonium persulphate in a pressure reactor under vacuum followed by mechanical stirring.<br>
(b)	preparation of super heated emulsion by mixing HCFC-124 in liquid form to the polymer prepared in step (a) at high pressure followed by stirring and then releasing the pressure and keeping at low temperature.<br>
The process for preparation of 2-ehloro-1,1,1,2-tetra fluoro-ethane based superheated emulsion comprises of the steps of:-<br>
(a)	Preparation of solution acrylamide<br>
A solvent like ethylene glycol and water are mixed in 1:1 ratio in a beaker with stirring. In this solvent mixture acrylamide monomer is dissolved by mixing 20-30% w/v of the solvent mixture, preferably 22-25% w/v of the solvent mixture.<br>
(b)	Preparation of initiator<br>
8 - 12% preferably 10% solution of ammonium persulphate is prepared by mixing ammonium persulphate in water.<br>
(c)	Preparation of Polymer<br>
The mixture prepared by step (a) is taken in a pressure reactor. To this mixture initiator (prepared by step (b) taken in quantity 0.1 to 0.15% preferably 0.12 to 0.14% is added. Vacuum of the order of 10   is created in the pressure reactor followed by mechanical stirring for about 20 hours.<br>
Vacuum is then released and viscosity of the polymer is measured.<br>
The desired range of viscosity of the polymer is 15 to 25 lakh cp preferably<br>
20 lakh cp.<br>
(d)	Preparation of superheated emulsion<br>
After obtaining the polymer of required viscosity, vacuum of the order of 10"<br>
is again created in the pressure reactor. To this polymer, 7 to 10% by volume<br>
preferably 8% by volume of polymer solution, commercially available 2-<br>
chloro-l,l,l,2-tetrafluoro-ethane(HCFC-     	<br>
124) in liquid form is added. To this mixture nitrogen gas is passed till the pressure reactor shows a pressure around 100 psi. Addition of nitrogen helps in liquifying HCFC-124, if any is in gas form. The mixture is then mechanically stirred for about 3 hours at a speed of about 10-15 rpm. The pressure is then released at a slow rate. The pressure reactor is then kept in a freezer at a temperature of about -15°C. After about 20 minutes, the pressure reactor is connected to nitrogen cylinder and nitrogen is passed till pressure is increased to 100 psi. The nitrogen cylinder is then removed and emulsion can be taken out through the nozzle of the pressure reactor.<br>
The invention will now be illustrated with a working example which is intended to be illustrative example and is not intended to be taken restrictively to imply any limitation on the scope of the present invention.<br>
WORKING EXAMPLE<br>
50 ml of ethylene glycol and 50 ml of water were mixed in a beaker with stirring. In this solvent mixture 25gm of acrylamide monomer was dissolved. Next a 10% ammonium persulphate solution was prepared in distilled water. The solvent mixture of acrylamide was taken in a pressure reactor and 0.1 ml ammonium persulphate solution was added in it. Then a vacuum of 10"2 arm was created in the pressure reactor and the contents were stirred mechanically for 20 hours. The viscosity of the prepared polyacrylamide gel was measured by Brookfield viscometer, which was 20 lakh cp. Then 8.8 ml of commercially available 2-chloro-l,l,l,2-tetra fluoro-ethane (HCFC-124) in liquid form was added. To this mixture nitrogen gas was passed till the pressure reactor showed a pressure of 100 psi. The nitrogen cylinder was then disconnected and polyacrylamide solution with HCFC-124 was mechanically stirred for 3 hours. The pressure was released and the pressure reactor was kept in freezer at -15°C for 20 minutes. Hie pressure reactor was again connected to nitrogen cylinder and nitrogen was allowed to pass till the pressure was 100 psi. 2-chloro-l,l,l,2-tetra fluoro-ethane based superheated emulsion was transferred to glass vials under nitrogen pressure.<br>
2-chloro-l,l,l,2-tetra fluoro-ethane based superheated emulsion was tested with calibrated neutron sources like Am241-Be and Cf52. The super heated emulsion was found to be sensitive even at low temperatures of 5°C. The neutrons upto ljaR could be measured and it was found to be stable at ambient temperature.<br>
 <br>

Such modifications, changes, adaptations are intended to be within the scope of the present invention which is further set forth under the following claims:-<br>
