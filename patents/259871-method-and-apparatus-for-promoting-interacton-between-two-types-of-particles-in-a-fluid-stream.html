FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to a method and apparatus for promoting or<br>
increasing interactions between different types of particles in a fluid flow. The<br>
invention provides a method of designing a formation of vortex generators to<br>
generate particle scale turbulence to cause interactions between particular types<br>
of particles in a fluid flow in a highly efficient manner.<br>
The invention has particular application in air pollution control, by promoting<br>
agglomeration of fine pollutant particles in air streams into larger particles to<br>
thereby facilitate their subsequent filtration or other removal from the air<br>
streams, although the invention is not limited to that application<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Many industrial processes result in the emission of small hazardous particles into<br>
the atmosphere. These particles often include very fine sub-micron particles of<br>
toxic compounds which are easily inhaled. Their combination of toxicity and ease<br>
of respiration has prompted governments around the world to enact legislation<br>
for more stringent control of emission of particles less than ten microns in<br>
diameter (PM10), and particularly particles less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5).<br><br>
Smaller particles in atmospheric emissions are also predominantly responsible for<br>
the adverse visual effects of air pollution. Opacity is largely determined by the<br>
fine particulate fraction of the emission since the light extinction coefficient peaks<br>
near the wavelength of light which is between 0.1 and 1 microns.<br>
Various methods have been used to remove dust and other pollutant particles<br>
from air streams. Although these methods are generally suitable for removing<br>
larger particles from air streams, they are usually much less effective in filtering<br>
out smaller particles, particularly PM2.5 particles.<br>
Fine particles in air streams can be made to agglomerate into larger particles by<br>
collision/adhesion, thereby facilitating subsequent removal of the particles by<br>
filtration. Our international patent application Nos. PCT/NZ200/00223 and<br>
PCT/AU2004/000546 disclose energized and passive devices for agglomerating<br>
particles. The agglomeration efficiency is dependent upon the incidence or<br>
frequency of collisions and similar interactions between the particles.<br>
Many pollution control strategies also rely on contact between individual<br>
elements of specific species to promote a reaction or interaction beneficial to the<br>
subsequent removal of the pollutant concerned. For example, sorbents such as<br>
activated carbon can be injected into the polluted air stream to remove mercury<br>
(adsorption), or calcium can be injected to remove sulfur dioxide<br>
(chemisorption).<br><br>
In order for these interactions to take place, the two species of interest must be<br>
brought into contact. For many industrial pollutants in standard flue ducts, this is<br>
difficult for several reasons. For example, the time flames for reaction/interaction<br>
are short (of the order of 0.5 - 1 second), the species of interest are spread very<br>
sparsely (relative to the bulk fluid) through the exhaust gases, and the scale of<br>
the flue ducting is large compared to the scale of the pollution particles.<br>
Normally, exhaust gases from the outlet of an industrial process are fed into a<br>
large duct which transports them to some downstream collection device (e.g. an<br>
electrostatic precipitator, bag filter, or cyclone collector) as uniformaly and with<br>
as little turbulence loss as possible. Such turbulence as is generated en route is<br>
normally a large scale diversion of gases around turning vanes, around internal<br>
duct supports/stiffess, through diffusion screens and the like. This turbulence is<br>
of the scale of the duct and should desirably be the minimum disturbance, and<br>
hence pressure drop, possible to achieve the desired flow correction.<br>
Similarly, when mixing devices are employed for a specific application, e.g.<br>
sorption of a particular pollutant, they are usually devices that generate a large-<br>
scale turbulence field (of the order of the duct width or height) and are arranged<br>
as a short series of curtains that the gases must pass through.<br><br>
The aim of most known mixing devices is to achieve a homogenous mixture of<br>
two or more substances . Such devices are not specifically designed to promote<br>
interactions between fine particles in the mixture. In most industrial-scale<br>
devices involving the transport of particles, the turbulence generated by the<br>
mixing is of a large scale relative to the particles. Under such conditions the<br>
particles tend to travel in similar paths rather than in collision courses.<br>
It is also known that vortex generators can be used in mixing chambers to<br>
promote mixing of the fluids. However, such devices are not generally used in<br>
particle laden flows to create collisions between particles.<br>
Whether they be particulate (e.g. flyash), gaseous (e.g. So2), mist (e.g.NOx), or<br>
elemental (e.g. Mercury), the pollution species which are the more difficult to<br>
collect within industrial exhaust flues are those of the order of micrometers in<br>
diameter (i.e. 10-6 meters). Due to their small size, they occupy a very small<br>
volumetric proportion of the total fluid flow. For example, if uniformly distributed<br>
one million 1 urn diameter particles would occupy less than 0.00005% of the<br>
volume of 1 cm3 of gas (assuming that the particles are spherically). Even at 10<br>
urn diameter, this Mercury may only account for a few parts per million (ppm) of<br>
the total species present, it is apparent that at particle scale, there is a significant<br>
amount of space/distance between the species being transported by<br><br>
an industrial flue gas. Where particles are already "well-mixed" in a flow e.g.<br>
disbursed more-or-less randomly throughout a duct (as in an exhaust flue)<br>
turbulence of any scale will not be able to mix them more thoroughly.<br>
Furthermore, sufficiently small particles that are entrained in a flowing fluid will<br>
follow the streamlines in the fluid flow. This occurs where the viscous forces of<br>
the fluid dominate the inertial forces of the particle. Known turbulent mixing<br>
regimes of the scale of the duct are many orders of magnitude larger than the<br>
particle. When viewed from the perspective of the particle, they are far from<br>
being chaotic but rather, are relatively smooth. Whilst there may be many<br>
changes of direction for a particle in its passage through a turbulent flow in a<br>
duct or through a standard mixing region, they are all relatively long range<br>
compared with the size or scale of the particle. Consequently, particles in a<br>
stream under conditions typical of industrial dust-laden flows follow more or less<br>
the same paths as their neighbouring particles, resulting in few interactions with<br>
the surrounding particles. At particle scale therefore, there are relatively few<br>
turbulence-generated interactions, and consequently, the known mixing<br>
processes achieve poor efficiency in agglomeration.<br>
Systems intended to maximize the collision rate of very small pollution species<br>
which occupy a tiny proportion of the volume total fluid flow must cause them to<br>
move along different trajectories, and/or different speeds, to each other, as<br><br>
as often as possible. Additionally such difference in trajectory and/or speed must<br>
be brought to bear at the scale of the particle to have the most effect.<br>
Unfortunately, current design philosophies do not adequately address these<br>
criteria.<br>
It is an aim of the present invention to provide method and apparatus for<br>
achieving improved interaction of particles in fluid flows.<br>
It is another aim of this invention to provide a method of custom designing a<br>
formation to generate particle scale turbulence to cause interaction between<br>
particular types of particles in a fluid flow in a highly efficient manner.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is based on the recognition that two particles of different mass<br>
and/or aerodynamic properties in a flowing fluid will respond differently to a<br>
turbulence eddy of a predetermined size in the fluid flow. More specifically, if the<br>
eddy is of a particular scale, the different particles will be entrained in the eddy<br>
to different extents, and will therefore follow different trajectories. Consequently,<br>
the likelihood of collision or interaction between the particles is increased.<br><br>
Particles of similar mass and/or aerodynamic properties which are captured by,<br>
and entrained in, a turbulence eddy will follow roughly the same path and<br>
consequently do not impact with each other to any significant extent. A particle<br>
of larger mass and/or different aerodynamic property will not be entrained into<br>
the eddy, or will be entrained to a substantially lesser extent, and will therefore<br>
travel through the eddy on a different on a different trajectory and be impacted<br>
by many more other particles entrained into the same eddy.<br>
To improve the likelihood of collisions between two types of particles in a fluid<br>
flow e.g. to promote their agglomeration or the adsorption of the smaller particle<br>
by the larger particle, a formation is designed to generate turbulence of such<br>
scale that different particles are entrained to significantly different extents.<br>
In one broad form, the present invention provides a method of promoting<br>
interaction between at least two types of particles in fluid stream, comprising<br>
the step of generating turbulent eddies in the fluid stream to cause interactions<br>
between the two types of particles in the turbulent eddies, characterized in that<br>
the eddies are of such size and/or intensity that the two types of particles are<br>
entrained in the eddies to significantly different extents.<br><br>
In another form, the invention provides apparatus for promoting interaction<br>
between at least two types of particles in a fluid stream, comprising means for<br>
generating turbulent eddies in the fluid stream to cause interactions between the<br>
two types of particles are entrained in the eddies to significantly different<br>
extents.<br>
Preferably, the turbulent eddies are of such size and/or intensity that one type of<br>
particle is substantially fully entrained while the other type of particle is not<br>
substantially entrained, to thereby maximize relative slip and the likelihood of<br>
interactions between the two type of particles.<br>
In yet another broad form, the invention provides a method of custom designing<br>
a formation for generating turbulent eddies in a fluid stream to promote<br>
interaction between at least two types of particles in the turbulent eddies,<br>
comprising the steps of:<br>
(i) identifying relevant characteristics of the two types of particles,<br>
(ii) performing a Stokes Number analysis to determine the optimal<br>
characteristic eddy size to cause one type of particle to have a significantly<br>
higher slip velocity than the other type of particle, and<br><br>
(iii) designing a formation to generate eddies in the fluid stream having<br>
the optimal size determined in step (ii) above.<br>
The relevant characteristics to the two types of particles normally include the size<br>
and density of the particles.<br>
The determination of the optimal characteristic eddy size may involve an<br>
iteration process.<br>
As the standard equation for Stokes Number assumes that particles are<br>
spherical, an empirical 'shape factor' may be applied to account for the shape of<br>
the particles.<br>
For two given types of particles, e.g. a collector particle and a collected particle,<br>
the invention provides a method of custom designing a formation to generate<br>
turbulent eddies of such size and scale as to maximize the differential slip<br>
velocities of the particles and thereby maximize the likelihood of interactions<br>
between the particle. Preferably, the eddies in the generated turbulence will be<br>
of such size that the slip velocity of the collector particle is maximized, while the<br>
slip velocity of the collected particle is minimized.<br><br>
Throughout this specification where the context permits, the term 'particle' is<br>
intended to mean a constituent of a flow fluid that can be manipulated to effect<br>
its collision with another particle in the same fluid flow. The 'particle' can be solid<br>
(e.g. a fly ash particle), liquid (e.g. a suspended water droplet) or gaseous (e.g.<br>
SO3), Hg or N0X molecules). This invention can be applied to gas and solid<br>
particle interactions, gas and liquid droplet interactions, liquid and solid particle<br>
interactions, interactions between different sized droplets, and interactions<br>
between different sized particles. The different sized particles may be suspended<br>
in a gas or in a liquid, and the different sized droplets may be suspended in a<br>
gas.<br>
The term 'collector particle' is intended to mean the larger and/or heavier particle<br>
used to collide and/or interact with the 'collected' or 'collection' particle.<br>
The term 'interaction' is intended to mean that the particles collide or come into<br>
sufficiently close proximity so as to result in their agglomeration, sorption,<br>
coagulation, catalysation or chemical reaction.<br>
Additionally, the terms 'slip' and 'slip velocity' are used to describe the relative<br>
velocity between a particle and its surrounding fluid. Hence, if a particle is fully<br>
entrained in a turbulent flow, its slip velocity is zero. The more a particle's path<br><br>
diverges from that of its surrounding fluid, the greater will be its slip velocity.<br>
Therefore, in this context, if small particles follow the flow more closely than<br>
large ones, their slip velocity will be smaller and they will be said to have less<br>
'slip'.<br>
Typically, the fluid stream is a gas or air stream, and the particles of at least one<br>
type are pollutant particles of micron or sub-micron size. However, this invention<br>
is not limited to pollution control uses, and has wider application to other uses in<br>
which interaction between particles in a fluid stream is sough to be achieved in a<br>
highly efficient manner.<br>
Turbulent eddies typically comprise vortex motions with a plurality of different<br>
sizes and shapes.<br>
In one embodiment, a multiplicity of small, low intensity vortices are used to<br>
entrain fine (pollution) particles and subject them to a turbulent flow. One or<br>
more species of larger 'collector' particles are introduced into the gas stream for<br>
removal of the pollutant particles The larger collector particles are either not<br>
entrained into the vortices, or any entrained to a much smaller extent, so that<br>
they follow different trajectories to the fine pollutant particles, resulting in a<br>
higher likelihood of contact and/or interaction between the pollutant particles,<br>
and the larger species.<br><br>
When the pollutant particles contact the larger species, they tend to adhere<br>
thereto or react therewith. The removal species may be a chemical, such as<br>
calcium, which reacts chemically with pollutant particles, (such as sulphur<br>
dioxide) to form a third compound (e.g. gypsum). Alternatively, the removal<br>
species of particles may remove the pollutant particles by absorption, or by<br>
adsorption (carbon particles adsorbing pollutant mercury particles), or the<br>
removal species of particles may simply remove the fine pollutants by<br>
agglomerating with the pollutants through impact adhesion. The larger or<br>
agglomerated particles are subsequently easier to remove from the gas stream<br>
using known methods.<br>
Typically, a Stokes Number much less than 1 will ensure entrainment of the fine<br>
pollutant particles. The larger removal species of particles should have a Stokes<br>
Number much greater than 1 so that they are not entrained. In practice, the<br>
eddies or vortices generated in the gas stream are small, unlike the large scale<br>
multitude of components generating a multiplicity of small eddies or vortices.<br>
The multiplicity of small eddies or vortices entrain the (small) particles of<br>
interest and subject them to turbulent flow. Larger particles are not necessarily<br>
entrained by these small vortices, or are entrained to a much lesser extent.<br><br>
Relative movement between the small and large particles results in higher<br>
frequency of collisions between them, and more efficient removal of the fine<br>
(pollutant) particles by the larger (collector) particles.<br>
The use of multiplicity of small vortices is counterintuitive in flows where the<br>
particles are already well disbursed in a duct. Normally, it is desirable that the<br>
pressure drop in the gas stream be as low as possible. For this reason vanes are<br>
typically only used to maintain as uniform a distribution of particles as possible in<br>
a duct. Such vanes are therefore typically of a relatively large scale - only slightly<br>
smaller than the scale of the duct. For example, large-scale "turning vanes" may<br>
be used in a bend to prevent all of the particles from going to the outside of the<br>
bend and creating a non-uniform distribution after the bend.<br>
Alternatively, known mixers are used when two different substances are not<br>
initially well distributed in a vessel or duct, to generate a homogeneous mixture.<br>
Again, large-scale devices are typically used. They are generally used to<br>
promote collisions between substances that are already well distributed in a duct.<br>
The present invention, on the other hand, uses many vortex generators which<br>
create small scale vortices to increase interactions between the fine (pollutant)<br>
particles and collector particles that are already sufficiently well distributed<br>
throughout the flow.<br><br>
In order that the invention may be more fully understood and put into practice,<br>
an embodiment thereof will now be described, by way of example only, with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
In a preferred embodiment, this invention involves the use of turbulent eddies to<br>
manipulate the relative trajectories of very small pollutant particles and larger<br>
collector particles carried by a flowing fluid, which is typically an exhaust gas<br>
stream from a industrial process, to increase the probability of the particles<br>
colliding or interacting to agglomerate, or otherwise react with each other, to<br>
form more easily removable particles. A formation is designed to provide<br>
turbulence of the required size and scale to cause the different species of<br>
particles to have substantially differential slip velocities.<br>
The turbulence should be such that the Stokes Number (St) of the small<br>
pollutant particles is much less than 1 (St 
of the larger collector particles is much greater than 1 (St&gt;&gt;l).<br><br>
The Stokes number (St) is a theoretical measure of the ability of a particle to<br>
follow a turbulence streamline. The Stokes number is defined as the ratio of the<br>
particle response time to a fluid flow time and is characterised by:<br><br>
where; =TP is the particle response time, τf is the characteristic flow time, ρp is<br>
the particle density, U is the fluid velocity, dp is the particle diameter, µ is the<br>
fluid viscosity and L is the eddy dimension. Typically, for St « 1 a particle is able<br>
to respond fully to a turbulent eddy of scale L, and follows it closely. At the other<br>
extreme, where St » 1, a particle does not respond to turbulent motions of that<br>
scale at all and its trajectory is largely unaffected. In the intermediate range, for<br>
St«l, particles respond partially to the fluid motions, but there is still a significant<br>
departure of the particle trajectory from the fluid motions.<br>
When a Stokes analysis is performed for the common pollution species in the flue<br>
of, for example, an industrial coal fired boiler, it is found that for turbulence<br>
eddies at the scale of a typical duct (say 4m2) and velocity of the gas (8-16<br>
m/sec), all particles of all commonly found sizes will respond fully to the<br>
turbulence eddies, i.e. St«l for all particles. Even for turbulence of a scale<br>
corresponding to the dimensions of duct height/width mixers, turning vanes,<br>
stiffeners etc (say 400mm), the majority of particles below 100µm will respond<br>
fully to the turbulence eddies. It is not until the turbulence scales are reduced<br>
significantly below this size that the particles exhibit a range of responses from<br>
St«l to St»l for sizes ranging from 0.1µm up to 100µm. Under such conditions,<br>
the trajectories of the large and small particles diverge from those of the flow to<br>
different extents, causing increased probability of collisions.<br><br>
From the foregoing, it is evident that, if turbulent eddies are sized correctly, it is<br>
possible to increase the number of collisions between different sized constituents<br>
within the same fluid flow on the basis of their differing interaction with, and<br>
hence path through, a turbulent eddy of fixed size. Further, it is possible to tailor<br>
the dominant size of a turbulent eddy to maximise the interaction between<br>
specific constituents on the basis of their relative inertia and hence responses to<br>
the turbulent eddy. A suitable formation can then be designed to provide the<br>
desired combination of eddy sizes.<br>
Vortex generators can be used to create the eddies. Vortex generators are<br>
generally known in the art, and need not be described in detail in this<br>
application. A common vortex generator is a vane. A formation comprising a<br>
plurality of vanes can be used to generate a multitude of eddies in the fluid<br>
stream.<br>
In one embodiment, illustrated in Figs 1 and 2, an array of angle section vanes<br>
10 is used to generate the vortices. A vane 10 is shown in Fig.I and comprises a<br>
strip of Z-shaped metal having protrusions or "teeth" 12 spaced along its length.<br>
The teeth 12 may be formed by spaced cut-outs 11 along the edges of the strip<br>
10. The teeth 12 have a depth Td and the tooth pitch Tp.<br>
The vanes 10 are arranged in an array comprising a plurality of parallel rows<br>
each extending in the direction of flow, each row containing a plurality of spaced<br>
vanes, orientated transversely to the fluid flow, as shown in the section view of<br>
Fig. 2. (The rows of vanes are normally mounted in planar frames which have<br>
been omitted for clarity) The body portions of the vanes 10 extend Vi in the<br>
direction of fluid flow, and are spaced apart by a distance Vs. The body portions<br>
of the vanes 10 have a width Vw in the direction transverse to the flow.<br><br>
Turbulent eddies are formed in the wake of the folds and protrusions 12 of the<br>
vanes 10. The dominant sizes of eddies created by this design approximate the<br>
significant dimensions of the generator, and include the width of the vane Vw,<br>
the length of the vane V1, the tooth depth Td and the tooth pitch Tp. The<br>
separation distance between successive vanes Vs is selected so that the eddies<br>
may form fully in the inter vane region.<br>
The combination of dimensions determines the combination of eddy sizes that<br>
are formed. The optimal range of eddy sizes is selected, and the vane design is<br>
optimized to achieve this within other constraints, such as pressure drop.<br>
Although teeth are used on the illustrated vane 10 and the vanes are<br>
angled to the direction of fluid flow, other variations are possible because eddies<br>
will form in the wake of any planar cylindrical or other shaped body placed in the<br>
path of the fluid flow and the eddies formed will be approximately the same size<br>
as the obstructing vane.<br>
For example, as shown in Fig. 3, an array of flat strips mounted transversely to<br>
the fluid flow may be used. Alternatively, an array of flat strips with scalloped<br>
edges as shown in Fig. 4, or an array of round posts as shown in Fig. 5, may be<br>
used. An single transverse row of spaced wires or rods, orientated across the<br>
flow, may also be used.<br>
The multiple small scale vortices or eddies generated by the array of vanes<br>
extend across the entire duct as it is preferable for the turbulence field to<br>
encompass the entire flow path. However, although the vanes may be mounted<br>
in a duct in which the subject air stream flows, it is to be noted that the<br>
invention does not require that vanes to be mounted in a duct or other conduit.<br><br>
Thus, in one embodiment, a formation for causing turbulent flow of the desired<br>
size and scale in a fluid flow can be designed and constructed as follows:<br>
1.	Determine the size distribution and density of the particles to be agglomerated<br>
(both collector and collected particles), including the relative quantities of<br>
particles of each size.<br>
2.	Identify the distribution of size, density and shape and the number density of<br>
the particles to act as the "collector particle" (i.e. the particle that will have the<br>
greatest slip) These particles may be naturally present in the system (e.g. in the<br>
upper size fraction of particles in a pulverised fuel ash stream) or may be<br>
introduced (e.g. sorbent particles for mercury collection).<br>
In certain systems, it is possible for the collector and collection particles to have<br>
significantly different densities and shapes. Variation in the slip characteristics of<br>
the collector and collected particles may be achieved by differences in density or<br>
shape, as well as by differences in size.<br>
The collector particles will also be selected to ensure that there are sufficient<br>
numbers of them present to produce a significant number of collisions between<br>
collector and collection particles.<br>
3.	Perform a Stokes Number analysis of the system as defined in 2 (above) using<br>
equation (1) to determine the optimal characteristic eddy size (L) to cause the<br>
collector particles to have a significantly higher slip velocity than the collected<br>
particles. This would typically require the Stokes number for the collector particle<br>
to be at least an order of magnitude greater than that of the collected particle.<br><br>
In a preferred methodology, the Stokes number of spherical collector particles<br>
would be in the range 10"2 <st></st>
Note that once the critical particle sizes are determined, the Stokes Number<br>
analysis can be performed because St can be set (as St» 1 for high slip particles)<br>
and all other variables in the Stokes equation with the exception of L (the eddy<br>
size) are (or can be assumed to be) constant.<br>
An iteration process may be used to determine the optimal characteristic eddy<br>
size (L). Namely, using the eddy size (L) as determined in step 3 (above), check<br>
St for the desired "collected particle" size (for low slip particles, St«l). Using<br>
eddy size (L) as determined in step 3 (above) and St = 1, check the intermediate<br>
particle response. Iterate these steps, adjusting the eddy size (L) to obtain the<br>
desired particle response.<br>
The optimum eddy size will normally be small, e.g. much less than 400mm, and<br>
typically of the order of 10mm, but will depend on the species of particles and<br>
their relevant characteristics.<br>
4. Determine the required size of the dominant dimension of the vane(s), W, of<br>
the vortex generator to create an eddy of size (L), as determined in step 3<br>
(above). In one methodology, W would be estimated to equal L. In another<br>
preferred methodology, the size of the vane would be determined by Stokes<br>
number similarity. This requires scaling the size of the vane to match as closely<br>
as possible the Stokes numbers of the collector and collected particles found to<br>
perform well in a different set of conditions, i.e. with different distribution(s) of<br>
particle size, density, shape and flow velocity and/or dynamic viscosity.<br><br>
5. Design a vane with the appropriate shape and dimensions to generate eddies<br>
of the size determined in 4 above. A preferred shape of vane is shown in Fig 1.<br>
If necessary, an empirical "shape factor" could be applied to account for the<br>
shape of non-spherical particles.<br>
There may be a range of sizes for each of the critical vane dimensions as<br>
dictated by the physical properties of the system, the dimensional requirements<br>
of manufacturing, and the engineering constraints of the apparatus. However, in<br>
general, the variables Vw, V|, Vs, Tp and Td will determine the size, shape,<br>
intensity and frequency of the turbulence created, which in turn will control the<br>
degree to which individual particles will slip and collide in the turbulence behind<br>
the vanes. The important design criteria are the size and spacing of the vanes.<br>
In addition, the objective is to cause the collision of suspended particles for a<br>
useful purpose e.g. agglomeration, sorption, catalisation, condensation etc.<br>
Hence, sufficient particle interactions should occur that substantially all particles<br>
experience at least one (and preferably multiple) collision event/s while<br>
traversing the device. In a practical sense, this requires a multiplicity of vanes in<br>
the direction of flow as well as across the flow. A multiplicity of vanes across the<br>
flow ensures that there is no flow path through the device that is free of<br>
appropriately sized eddies, while a multiplicity of vanes in the direction of flow<br>
ensures the flow remains in the device for a sufficient time for a useful number<br>
of particle collisions to occur.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, the device is long enough in the direction of flow<br>
that the flowing fluid is treated by it for at least 0.1 second. For a typical<br>
industrial flow of (say) 10m/sec, this would require a device at least Im deep in<br>
the direction of flow.<br>
Separation between subsequent vanes in the direction of flow should be such<br>
that the eddies created by a vane are reinforced by the eddy creating action of<br>
the vane immediately downstream, as illustrated in Fig 6 in which vortices 1<br>
created by a vane are reinforced at 2 by the next successive vane. Fig. 6 also<br>
illustrates the different trajectories of a low slip particle 3 and a high slip particle<br>
4. In a preferred embodiment, the vanes are separated by a distance Vs<br>
equivalent to the vane width Vw.<br>
Alignment of the vanes is not critical and may be horizontal, vertical or at some<br>
angle between these two directions.<br>
The present invention has the advantage that mixing devices can be designed to<br>
suit particular applications. More specifically, turbulence of a desired scale can be<br>
achieved, so that small pollutant particles are entrained into the turbulent<br>
eddies and vortices, whereas larger collector particles are entrained to a smaller<br>
or negligible degree). The resultant differential slip velocities and trajectories of<br>
the small pollutant particles and the larger removal particles result in more<br>
collisions between the two types of particles. Consequently, there is greater<br>
interaction between the particles (e.g impact adhesion, absorption, adsorption or<br>
chemical reaction), improving the efficiency of pollutant removal.<br><br>
Conceptually, the invention involves generating turbulence of such a scale that<br>
the two species of interest are entrained to significantly differing extents, and is<br>
not limited to any particular apparatus and process. Optimum collision rates will<br>
occur for a system which maintains St«l for one species and St &gt; 1 for the other<br>
species. The turbulence itself may be generated in any suitable manner, and is<br>
not limited to known vortex generators.<br>
Although the invention has been described with particular reference to its<br>
application in pollution control, it can be used to design high efficiency mixers for<br>
other applications.<br>
Further, although the invention has been described with particular reference to<br>
the mixing of particles in a gas stream, it also has application to mixing in other<br>
fluid flows, e.g. liquids.<br>
The vanes need not be mounted in a rectilinear array. As shown in Fig. 7, the<br>
vanes may be mounted in successive rows transverse to the direction of flow,<br>
with the vanes in each row being staggered across the flow path relative to<br>
vanes in the adjacent rows.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, two or more turbulence generators are<br>
spaced successively along the flow path, generating progressively larger<br>
turbulence eddies to promote the impact of progressively larger particles.<br><br>
Such an arrangement accommodates agglomerates which are progressively<br>
increased in size along the flow path This embodiment has potential application<br>
in mist eliminators and fine particle agglomerators, as well as in chemical<br>
interaction or catalisation processes in which successively larger constituents are<br>
targeted to enhance the process efficiency.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
TITLE: 'METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PROMOTING INTERACTION BETWEEN<br>
TWO TYPES OF PARTICLES IN A FLUID STREAM'<br>
The invention relates to interaction between two different species of particles in<br>
a fluid stream is promoted by generating turbulent eddies in the fluid stream.<br>
The turbulent eddies are designed to be of such size and/or intensity that the<br>
two species of particles are entrained into the eddies to significantly different<br>
extents. Consequently, the different species of particles follow different<br>
trajectories, and the likelihood of collisions or interactions between the particles<br>
is increased. Optimum collision rates will occur for a system which maintains a<br>
Stokes Number (St) much less than 1 for one species, and or order 1 or greater<br>
for the other species. The invention has particular application in air pollution<br>
control, by promoting agglomeration of fine pollutant particles in air streams into<br>
larger particles to thereby facilitate their subsequent removal from the air<br>
streams.</td>
